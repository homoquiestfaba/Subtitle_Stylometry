1
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:02,761
Max?

2
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:02,761
Max, it's me.

3
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,200
Max, I want you
to come with me,
but I need you to be quiet.

4
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,702
And don't make
a sound no matter
what happens,

5
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,770
do you understand?

6
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,396
Everyone okay?

7
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,312
Damn it.

8
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,617
Dad!

9
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,857
No, dad.

10
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,860
Ari.

11
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,998
<i> All my life,</i>
<i> I've been running.</i>

12
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:05,671
<i> It's all I've ever known.</i>

13
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,409
<i> And I've always found</i>
<i> one thing to be true.</i>

14
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,109
<i> It's the only thing</i>
<i> you have to remember.</i>

15
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,555
<i> The only thing</i>
<i> you need to believe.</i>

16
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,876
<i>No matter how bad things get,</i>

17
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,779
<i> there's always a way out.</i>

18
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,091
Max, wake up.

19
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,726
I'm up.

20
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,178
Slow down.

21
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,480
I'm in a hurry.

22
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,855
Can I help you
with something?

23
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,825
No.

24
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:40,892
Okay.

25
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:45,797
And clean up after yourself.
You're not the only one
that lives here.

26
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,673
You got it, mom.

27
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:18,997
Good morning, sunshine.

28
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,735
Iggy wants to talk to you.

29
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:24,803
Inventory.

30
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:28,240
He's been calculating
his long-term projection
all morning.

31
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,775
Yeah, I'm gonna need
breakfast first.

32
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,514
Good choice.

33
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:39,918
You're right.
One cookie's a snack,
two is a meal.

34
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,192
Yes.

35
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,830
Five miles away.

36
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,832
I can't wait
to leave this house.

37
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,167
I mean, you've had
some bad ideas,

38
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,903
but this is by far
your worst.

39
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:00,138
Why? It's not like
anyone's gonna find out.

40
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,807
You're willing to put
your life in danger
for a jacket?

41
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:05,010
I'll be back before
anyone knows I'm gone.

42
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,078
Are you kidding me?

43
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,658
Really, nudge?

44
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,193
You're up.
Don't play with me.

45
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,764
What do you mean?
I know.

46
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,732
Don't look at her.

47
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,167
Get out of my head,
you little rat.

48
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:31,236
Hey, leave angel alone,
it's not her fault

49
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,938
you're planning
something stupid.

50
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,308
Coming from
the idiot making a bomb
at the breakfast table.

51
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,710
That's a bomb?
Like a real bomb?

52
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,011
No.

53
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,248
Don't worry.
It's not dangerous.

54
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,319
As long as these two
aren't connected,
it can't go off.

55
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,823
Oh, I see.
Never mind. Totally cool.

56
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,025
If they find us,
they'll send the erasers.

57
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,262
And those guys could
rip down these walls
with their bare hands.

58
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,665
So excuse me for wanting
a little extra firepower.

59
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,667
Yeah, well,
they're not gonna have to
send the erasers

60
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:04,869
if you do their job for them
and kill all of us first.

61
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,005
And you,

62
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:10,375
were you really
gonna put us all at risk
just to go shopping?

63
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,844
Relax. What's the big deal?
I would have been back

64
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:12,844
before you even
knew I was gone.

65
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:17,382
I'm just tired
of being cooped up
in this house all the time.

66
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,351
And what was your plan
if you got caught?

67
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,785
I'm too fast to get caught.

68
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,220
You think you're fast?

69
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,023
Well, let me tell you
something, nudge.

70
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,960
I'm faster,
I'm bigger, I'm stronger

71
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,364
and if you ever
even think about

72
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,032
leaving this house
on your own again,

73
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,969
I will take you down so hard
you won't know what hit you.

74
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,880
All right, John Wayne.

75
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,652
What are you looking at?

76
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,189
You don't have to
be so hard on them.

77
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,258
Someone has to be
in charge around here.

78
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,331
Sounds like that went well.

79
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,899
Eavesdropping again?

80
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:08,266
I might be blind,

81
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,336
but I can't help
that my hearing
is better than yours.

82
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,172
You wanted to
meet with me?
Right.

83
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:17,208
Well, uh, the verdict is
we won't starve tomorrow,

84
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,345
but between the food supply
and the money
that Jeb left us,

85
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,748
we're looking at
six months tops.

86
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,851
Great. That gives us time
to come up with a plan.

87
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:30,055
Like what? Stealing?
Becoming farmers?

88
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,956
Okay,
maybe it's time we leave.

89
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,024
We're not leaving.

90
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,993
We may not
have a choice, Max.

91
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,396
Change is going to come
whether we're prepared
or not.

92
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,831
Yeah, I'm with iggy on this.

93
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:41,866
I can't blame
nudge or the others

94
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,234
wanting to go out
and experience more.

95
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:45,837
These kids need things, Max.

96
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,941
Ordinary things,
like making friends
or seeing more than just

97
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,276
the inside of this house.

98
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,978
Well, at least
they're not in cages.

99
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:54,312
We're not leaving.

100
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:58,249
Jeb put us here
for a reason.
He knew we'd be safe.

101
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,187
You still think
he's coming back,
don't you?

102
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,958
How am I supposed to
do this without you?

103
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,395
<i> You're their leader, Max.</i>

104
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,766
<i> Show them the way,</i>
<i> they will follow.</i>

105
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,453
I'm going upstairs.

106
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,427
All right.

107
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,363
Where'd she put it?

108
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,934
Fine. I don't need your help.

109
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,869
I'll find it myself.

110
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,538
Or I'll just
make another one.

111
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,297
Hey.

112
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,102
Hey.
Hi.

113
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,308
You okay?

114
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,579
I'm fine.

115
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,249
I know you think
Max doesn't care,

116
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,585
but she does.

117
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,422
I didn't ask for
Max to be my mom.
I can take care of myself.

118
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,659
No. None of us can.

119
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,928
We all need each other.

120
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,930
I just want to be
a normal teenager.

121
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,366
I want to go out and have fun
and have a life.

122
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:37,135
We can't, nudge.

123
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,270
As much as we try,
we can't.

124
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,039
We can't risk the exposure.

125
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,345
Max only cares
about herself.

126
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:50,381
She has her own plan,
and I'm tired of
sticking to it.

127
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,518
You're wrong if you think
Max doesn't care.

128
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,219
She does.

129
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,956
Look, I know she cares.

130
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,460
I just don't want to stay here
because we're afraid.

131
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,030
I'm tired of being afraid.

132
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,977
<i> What are we waiting for?</i>

133
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,514
<i> Can they hear us?</i>

134
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,416
<i> Maintain position.</i>

135
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,332
Angel.

136
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,141
Angel!

137
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,510
Angel!
Angel!

138
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,048
Angel!

139
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,250
Angel!

140
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,158
Angel!

141
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,795
Angel!

142
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,131
Angel.

143
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,315
They don't want you
anymore, Max.

144
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,351
They just want your
sweet, precious angel.

145
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,089
Ari.

146
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,204
Hey.

147
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,307
Wanna play?

148
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:15,887
What you drawing?

149
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,224
This is where we're going
when we get out.

150
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,393
It looks cool.

151
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,562
Who are they?

152
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,430
That's my family.

153
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,700
Are they your parents?

154
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,438
We don't have parents.
It's just us.

155
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,844
Who's that guy?

156
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,646
That's Jeb.

157
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,950
Why would you draw my dad?

158
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,753
He takes care of us.

159
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,725
He takes care of everything.

160
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,795
He's working on
something really big.

161
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,531
He's gonna save the world.

162
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,434
His job is really important.

163
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,207
Do you see him much?

164
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,742
Every day.

165
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,748
Ari.
I have to go.

166
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,754
Ari...

167
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,757
This area is off limits.

168
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,526
But why?

169
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:29,627
You know the rules.

170
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,230
She's very special.

171
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,866
Do you understand? Now go.

172
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,673
Hello, Max.

173
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,000
Max!

174
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,675
Angel.
Where is she?

175
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:18,743
We don't know.

176
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,046
Did you find them?
No.

177
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,015
They must have had
some kind of aircraft.

178
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,416
How'd they find us?

179
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,951
Who cares?
We have to get her back.

180
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,387
Where are they taking her?

181
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,422
The school.

182
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:32,490
No.

183
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,492
We have to
go back there.

184
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:35,726
We don't even know
where that is.

185
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,529
Jeb did.

186
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,520
Hey, look at this.

187
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:03,587
What is it?

188
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:04,955
Look at this.

189
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,926
All right, he marked a path
ending at the house,

190
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:11,929
and starting
in death valley.

191
00:22:11,931 --> 00:22:12,997
There's nothing there.

192
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,832
Not according to Jeb.

193
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,469
I'm pretty sure that's it.
I remember us
driving over sand.

194
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,339
If we leave now,
we can be there
in a day and a half.

195
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:25,042
Here. There's campgrounds
off of lake mead.

196
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,078
That's the halfway point.
We'll stop there
for the night.

197
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,946
Who knows
what they'll have
done to her by then.

198
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,115
Angel's strong,
she'll find a way
to hold on until we get there.

199
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:32,983
So what are we waiting for?
Let's go.

200
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,454
You're not coming.

201
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,922
What? Why?

202
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,591
You and nudge can't fly
as fast as us.

203
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,627
Not yet.
You'll just slow us down.

204
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,963
No way.
Gazzy.

205
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:45,963
She's my sister.

206
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:50,034
I know.
And I'm gonna get her back,
i promise, okay?

207
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,703
But I can't do that
if I'm worried
about you, too.

208
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,839
I need you to stay here
where it's safe.

209
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,641
It's not safe, not anymore.
They know we're here.

210
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,143
And they left us here alive.

211
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,512
If they wanted to take us,
they could have.

212
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,780
They only wanted angel.

213
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:06,016
I'm sorry,
but this is how
it has to be, guys.

214
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,989
This isn't fair.

215
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,164
I'll look after them.
Thanks.

216
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,067
But that does bring up
the obvious question.

217
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:27,004
Why angel?
Why not all of us?

218
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,706
Maybe they know
what she can do.

219
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,841
How?

220
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:35,045
Well, we always
assumed they got Jeb.
So maybe they got him to talk.

221
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:36,814
Why would they wait
this long?

222
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,183
Maybe that's how long it took
to break him.

223
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:39,850
You guys
should get going.

224
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:43,487
I'll put together
some supplies for the road.

225
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,889
Thanks.
Yeah.

226
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,824
There's one other thing.

227
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,494
The guy who knocked
me out, it was Ari.

228
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,597
How is that even possible?
I know.

229
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,466
I barely
recognized him, but...

230
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,071
I can't believe
they turned him into
an eraser.

231
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,941
Well, they did.
And we're gonna
have to deal with it.

232
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:13,911
Where's Ari?

233
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,266
What are you doing in here?

234
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,902
Ever wonder who
your parents are?

235
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:14,638
We're not
supposed to be in here.

236
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,640
Says who? Max?

237
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,208
I don't see her around.

238
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,178
Look,
there's all these documents,

239
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,047
medical records,
personal information.

240
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,616
I think they're about us.

241
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,651
There's no names,
only numbers,

242
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,253
but we can match 'em up
by our ages.

243
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,059
I think this one's about me,
about where I came from.

244
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,197
What do you mean
where you came from?

245
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:41,699
I thought we were
test tube babies.

246
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,000
Not according to this.

247
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,071
Wait, seriously?

248
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,707
There's a name
along with an address
in New York.

249
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,745
I think... I think
it might be my mother.

250
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,756
Iggy...

251
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,229
Over here.

252
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,941
You're getting warmer, iggy.

253
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,714
Who's there?

254
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,083
Where's Max?

255
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,693
What was that? Wait.

256
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,010
No!

257
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,826
Now, where are you?

258
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,897
You want to play games?

259
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:22,833
Okay.

260
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,179
Is everyone all right?
I think so.

261
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,148
Nudge? Nudge?

262
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,119
Whatever I said
about making a bomb,
i take it back.

263
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,123
We need to find Max.

264
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,829
Come on.

265
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:24,214
We need more data.
I recommend
we increase the voltage.

266
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:27,284
That's enough for now.
Let her rest.

267
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:08,118
We shouldn't have
stopped yet.

268
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,553
We need to eat
and we need to rest.

269
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,221
We're no good
to angel otherwise.

270
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:14,591
I know. You're right.
I just keep thinking about

271
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:15,659
how she's all alone
and that they...

272
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:17,027
Stop.

273
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,596
Imagining the worst
won't get us there
any faster.

274
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,403
Thanks.

275
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,498
It's so quiet here.
It's weird.

276
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,634
Yeah.

277
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,170
It gives you time to think.

278
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,272
About what?

279
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,542
Anything you want.

280
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,113
Let go of me!

281
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,581
Just, stop!

282
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,184
- Get away!
- Hey, get back here!

283
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,786
No.
Yes.

284
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:17,254
We don't have time for this.

285
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,556
It's one guy.
It'll take five minutes,
tops.

286
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,691
We're supposed to be keeping
a low profile,

287
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,493
not drawing attention
to ourselves, remember?

288
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,696
By the time he realizes
what's going on,
we'll be long gone.

289
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,067
You don't know that.
You can't just jump in
without thinking.

290
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:31,435
Not this time.

291
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,537
You need to choose, Max.
Us or them?

292
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,305
Well, I can't think
like that.

293
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:38,075
You don't want to
think like that,
but it's the truth.

294
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,709
I know you feel
helpless right now,

295
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:39,709
and I know you want to
do something,

296
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:43,814
but saving one random girl
who could probably
take care of herself

297
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,582
is not gonna bring
angel back.

298
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,754
Fine. You're right.
It's not our problem.

299
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,768
Let go of me! Stop it!

300
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,269
Get off!

301
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:09,206
Hey, get back here!
Jake, stop!

302
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,579
Jake, stop!
You shouldn't have done that!

303
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:18,315
Get off of me!
Stop! Get off!

304
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,549
Get off! Help!

305
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,792
Go!

306
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,729
You're dead.

307
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,604
Make sure you tell
your friends you were
beat up by a girl.

308
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,912
Really?

309
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:53,617
What are you?

310
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,719
Oh, my god.

311
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,855
Oh, boy.

312
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:15,305
Max!

313
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,309
Oh, no, no, no.

314
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,211
Hang on, Max.

315
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,447
She needs to go
to the hospital.

316
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,284
No hospital.

317
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,752
My mom's a doctor.
She can help her.

318
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:31,855
No one can know about us.

319
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,757
I understand.

320
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:37,194
It's only a few blocks.
Come on. Come on, hurry.

321
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,978
I'm gonna go get my mom.

322
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,915
It's gonna be okay.
Stay with me.

323
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:06,523
All right. What do we got?
Come on. Max?

324
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,360
Stay with me. Max?

325
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:14,731
Max.

326
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,800
Damn it.

327
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:20,370
You're so stupid.
Why do you not listen to me?

328
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:22,339
You're selfish.

329
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,774
It's gonna be okay. Come on.

330
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,511
We'll get you
fixed up, Max.

331
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,547
Like nothing ever happened.

332
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,583
Max.

333
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:36,386
Damn it, Max.

334
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,623
- What's going on?
- Come in here.

335
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,691
Come on.
What's going on, Ella?

336
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,026
Just get in here, mom.

337
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:45,762
What happened to her?

338
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:47,964
She's been shot.

339
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,267
Mom, we have to help her.

340
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,937
But we can't call the police,
and we can't take her
to the hospital.

341
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,373
That's not how this works.

342
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:59,976
Please.
Mom, she saved my life.

343
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,748
I don't know
what's going on here,

344
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,316
but I can tell you
i don't like it.

345
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,387
Not at all.

346
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,801
Is she gonna be okay?

347
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,482
<i> Mom, she saved my life.</i>

348
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,384
We're almost there.

349
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,886
What are you doing to me?

350
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,688
Her heart's
beating too fast.

351
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,922
We need to slow it down.

352
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:47,657
Where's Jeb? Where is he?
I wanna see him.

353
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,359
Code purple.
She's starting to panic.

354
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,928
You need to calm down.

355
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,331
Please,
you don't have to do this.
I'm sorry.

356
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:58,735
Please. It wasn't my fault.
He started it. Please!

357
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:01,104
A little help here, please?

358
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,841
What are you doing?
Stop! Please!

359
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:04,841
It's all
going to be just fine.

360
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,078
When I get out of here,
you're going to be sorry!

361
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,913
You need to calm down.

362
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:11,948
Hurry.

363
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,883
Get off of me.

364
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,086
- Hold her down.
- I'm trying.

365
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,123
Calm down.

366
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,391
- No!
- Hurry!

367
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:24,694
Everything's
going to be just fine.

368
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,929
Keep her immobile.

369
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,497
Now take deep breaths.

370
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:28,932
You need to
calm her down.

371
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,433
Keep breathing.

372
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:31,901
Her heart rate
is increasing.

373
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,604
Calm down.

374
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,840
We need a sedative.

375
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:37,907
Got it.

376
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:39,075
No! Get off of me!

377
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,477
Calm down.

378
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,619
That's it, deep breaths.

379
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,790
Everything will be just fine.

380
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:54,858
Okay.

381
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,794
I just wanna be normal.

382
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:25,114
Um, I don't really know
what would have happened

383
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,249
if you weren't there.

384
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,986
At least stay for breakfast.

385
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,622
My mom really
wants to meet you.

386
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,025
Okay.

387
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:42,765
Okay, this one's,
like, a little well-done,
but here you go.

388
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:50,740
Okay, I don't get it.
Where do you put it all?

389
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,209
I have a really
fast metabolism.

390
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,512
Hey, girls. Laundry done.

391
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,213
Thank you, mom.
Yep.

392
00:41:58,215 --> 00:41:58,214
I washed your clothes.

393
00:41:58,216 --> 00:42:02,218
The shirt was a loss,
but you and Ella
are the same size.

394
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,656
Um, after breakfast,
why don't you go up
and take a shower?

395
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,525
I'll meet you in the clinic
when you're done.

396
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,261
I need to have
another look at you.

397
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,907
They are stopping
in lake mead,
we'll be right behind them.

398
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:27,277
There's a cabin
just north of there.

399
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,847
Pick up the pace
so that we can catch them
before they leave.

400
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,116
It's a solid plan.

401
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:34,951
I don't see any
other alternative,

402
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:37,554
unless you got
some bright idea.

403
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,556
She's gone.
What?

404
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,964
Seriously, nudge?

405
00:42:50,635 --> 00:42:51,834
Come on.
But I just...

406
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,274
Never, never do that again.

407
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,842
I was just looking.

408
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:01,177
We didn't know
where you were.

409
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,215
You're right.
You do heal fast.

410
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:07,016
What do you mean?

411
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:11,354
As far as I can tell,
your shoulder
is nearly fully recovered.

412
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,132
Did you know
that was there?

413
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,202
No, what is it?

414
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,738
I would say it looks like
a tracking chip.

415
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,240
Like the kind
people put inside their pets.

416
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:33,076
Can you get it out?

417
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:37,046
It must have been put in
when you were very little.

418
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,049
Your muscles, nerves,

419
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,752
even your blood vessels,
have grown
completely around it.

420
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,756
If I tried,
I'm afraid you'd lose
use of your hand.

421
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,626
Then there's this.

422
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:52,629
You see this long,
curved line?

423
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,998
It looks like bone.

424
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,002
Secondary skeletal system
underneath your muscle tissue.

425
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:01,771
Which just
doesn't make any sense.

426
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:06,342
The scar on your back.

427
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,144
That was recent.

428
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:08,778
Very recent.

429
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,716
Layered over and over again
in the exact same place.

430
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:18,321
Look, I don't know
what kind of
trouble you're in.

431
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,657
I'm not sure
if I even want to know.

432
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,761
But you're a brave girl,
and we owe you.

433
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,230
And we'll always
be here for you.

434
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:29,699
No questions asked.

435
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,235
Thank you.

436
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:33,302
Uh...

437
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:38,074
I don't feel very good.
Do you mind
if I just go and rest?

438
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,677
Of course.
We can talk later.

439
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,739
This isn't gonna work.

440
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:21,978
You can hurry up.

441
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,252
What?

442
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,921
Let's go. Come on.

443
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:43,065
I didn't mean for you
to walk ahead of me.

444
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,134
I just meant, like, you know,
you can walk next to me.

445
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,074
You say something?

446
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,545
Okay, I'm the one
that should be mad at you,

447
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:57,346
not you being mad at me.

448
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,186
Let's try
to find some power.

449
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,304
Well, I got power outside,
but I don't have power inside.

450
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,940
I found some candles.

451
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,946
How's your shoulder?

452
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:39,215
It's fine.

453
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,920
Seriously?

454
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,522
That's all you're gonna say?

455
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,459
What do you
want me to say?

456
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,229
Well, you're obviously
still mad at me.

457
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,367
Yeah, I am.

458
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,403
I have every right to be.

459
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,705
He caught me off guard.

460
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:06,175
I'm sorry for all the time
and trouble it cost us,

461
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:07,643
but I'm not sorry
that I helped her.

462
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,579
It was the right thing to do.

463
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:12,315
The right thing to do?

464
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:16,953
Max, we're beyond worrying
about the right thing to do.

465
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,957
They experimented
on us like lab rats.

466
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,493
And now we have to run,
hide and fight

467
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,496
every day
just to stay alive.

468
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,266
And you're willing
to risk angel's life,

469
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,501
yourself, everything,

470
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,470
just because it's
the right thing to do?

471
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,538
Yes.

472
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,342
Because if I don't,
that means
I'm exactly like them.

473
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,644
Well, if we
want to survive,

474
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:43,679
we have to be
just as ruthless.

475
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,349
That doesn't work for me.

476
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:49,385
If I can't be better,
then I should
just give up now.

477
00:49:49,586 --> 00:49:52,188
Maybe you should.
You'd live a lot longer.

478
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,161
I almost lost you.

479
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,263
Do you understand that?

480
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,433
Do you understand
how that feels?

481
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:19,382
There's someone out there.

482
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:36,766
It's nice to see you, too.
Iggy,

483
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,468
why aren't you
back at the house?
Max!

484
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,239
It's a long story.

485
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,108
The house is gone.

486
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:46,475
I kinda blew it up.

487
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,046
I guess it's not
that long of a story.

488
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,414
You have to be kidding me.

489
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:53,082
It's not his fault, Max.

490
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:56,118
There was an eraser.
Gazzy saved our lives.

491
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,520
We think it was Ari.

492
00:50:57,522 --> 00:51:00,523
What did he want?
He was looking for you.

493
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,326
All right,
let's get inside.

494
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,572
So far,
her physical responses,
though extraordinary,

495
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:51,273
are no different
than the other subjects.

496
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:54,376
Since we took subject 11,

497
00:51:55,178 --> 00:51:57,513
the others all have
increased levels of stress,

498
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:59,348
expected under
the circumstances.

499
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:03,586
But despite extensive testing
and a brain biopsy,

500
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,654
we're still unable to find
the source of the variance.

501
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,656
Here and here.

502
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,292
Then so be it.

503
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,596
We devise a new
series of tests.

504
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,766
Yes. Of course, sir.

505
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:37,286
She said it was
a tracking chip,

506
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:38,888
but I guess if he didn't
know where I was,

507
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,422
it must not work anymore.

508
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,458
Or it's not a tracking chip.

509
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,193
What else could it be?

510
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,564
Well, we can't worry
about it right now.

511
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:50,933
You said Ari came back?

512
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:52,868
Yeah.

513
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,637
He had that same scar.

514
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,706
Max is the one
that gave it to him.

515
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:01,177
He used to poke at her
while she was in the cage,
but...

516
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,712
There was nothing I could do
to stop him.

517
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,650
Why didn't you tell Jeb?

518
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,285
Ari was Jeb's son,

519
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,887
and I was nobody.
I didn't think
anyone would care.

520
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,956
So, how'd you
give him the scar?

521
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,325
It doesn't matter.

522
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,895
She grabbed his arm,
pulled him up to the bars,

523
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:24,266
and then took
the scissors he was using
and turned it around on him.

524
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:26,702
Whoa!

525
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,604
I think he hated all of us.

526
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,907
The only reason
Ari came to the lab
was to see Jeb,

527
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:34,543
and he spent
all his time with us.

528
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,712
He spent
all his time with you.

529
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:39,448
You were his favorite.

530
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,219
Maybe that's why
Ari became an eraser.

531
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,287
To be more like us.

532
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,456
Erasers
are nothing like us.

533
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,492
They don't keep erasers
locked away in cages.

534
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:53,495
I hope he died in the blast.

535
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,466
Yeah, well, I don't think
we got that lucky.

536
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,504
We should all get some rest.

537
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,540
We have a big day
ahead of us.

538
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,392
What are you
doing here again?

539
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,464
Does it bother you?

540
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,301
I can't figure it out,

541
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,536
why dad likes you so much.

542
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:12,808
Because there's nothing
special about you.

543
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,779
You're just
a bunch of chemicals
somebody cooked up in a lab.

544
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,386
If he wanted to,
he could make 100 of you.

545
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,857
The truth is,
you're a mistake.

546
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,527
An experiment gone wrong.

547
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,897
You're not even human.

548
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,537
How does it feel
to be a monster?

549
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,875
Things would be so much better
if you would just go away.

550
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,578
Would you like that?

551
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,450
Then we would never
have to see each other
again, right?

552
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,388
I mean I could
leave you in here
with no hope.

553
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,992
Or I could just let you go.

554
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:09,765
Come and get it.

555
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,501
Come and get it.

556
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,869
I was wondering
when you'd show up.

557
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,204
I've been
looking forward to this.

558
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,606
Well, I wouldn't
want to disappoint you.

559
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,746
Well, I guess
if you still hate me,

560
00:58:04,748 --> 00:58:05,948
you still have
feelings, huh?

561
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:10,085
I was wondering about that.
Are you still a person
or just an animal?

562
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:11,620
I didn't come here to talk.

563
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:17,993
Come on, Ari.
Jeb wouldn't want it
to be like this.

564
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:23,665
You still don't get anything!

565
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,968
We're the good guys.

566
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,886
Come on, Ari.
You should know better.
I'm never really alone.

567
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:47,189
Neither am I.

568
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,096
You chose
to become a monster.

569
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,198
I didn't have that luxury.

570
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,001
And that's a decision
I'm gonna make you regret.

571
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,836
And I might even enjoy it.

572
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,906
Max, I just couldn't
quite hear you.

573
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,888
Max, I don't know
if you can hear me,
but I can't hear you.

574
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,106
No!

575
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,841
No!

576
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,113
No!

577
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:19,948
Don't worry, angel.

578
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,387
Your whole family
will be reunited soon enough.

579
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,233
Is everyone okay?

580
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:41,670
I'm fine.

581
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:43,205
Iggy?

582
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:44,272
Present.

583
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,074
I'm okay, Max.

584
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:48,143
Gazzy?

585
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,178
Look.

586
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,116
Oh, my god. Angel.

587
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,252
Angel, it's me, Max.
Can you hear me?

588
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:58,387
Max?

589
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:02,891
Yeah.
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.
Everything's okay.

590
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:04,726
Max, I'm sorry.

591
01:01:04,728 --> 01:01:06,128
I'm so sorry.

592
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,730
It's okay, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

593
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,298
Don't listen to him, Max.

594
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,735
Please.
Please don't listen to him.

595
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:14,936
Listen to who?

596
01:01:33,322 --> 01:01:35,223
Somebody wants to
talk to you, Max.

597
01:01:57,013 --> 01:01:58,280
Hello, Max.

598
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:21,937
Why don't you
take a seat, Max?

599
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:24,139
We have a lot of
catching up to do.

600
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:42,023
I got you something to eat.

601
01:02:46,796 --> 01:02:48,096
You must be starving.

602
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,299
Chocolate chip cookies.

603
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,302
Your favorite.

604
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,208
You're not hungry?

605
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:06,414
I'm trying really hard
to come up with a story

606
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:08,116
that would explain
any of this.

607
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,253
And what have you
come up with so far?

608
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:15,190
That two years ago,
you were caught.

609
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,460
So to protect us,
you pretended
that we were dead.

610
01:03:19,162 --> 01:03:21,062
But you knew they'd
always be watching,

611
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:22,931
so you stopped
communicating with us.

612
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,501
But I'm guessing
that's just
wishful thinking, huh?

613
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:30,972
Anything else?

614
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,009
Option two,

615
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,145
that it was all a lie.

616
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:41,149
You never really rescued us,
and this is all part
of some master plan,

617
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,318
the experiments,
everything. It was you.

618
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,455
How am I doing, Jeb?

619
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,193
Warm? Cold?
Room temperature?

620
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:57,899
Both of those scenarios
are extremes.

621
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,535
Opposite extremes.

622
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:06,408
The truth usually lies
somewhere in the middle.

623
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:11,880
Like I'd believe
anything you had to say
after what you did to angel.

624
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:13,515
That was unavoidable.

625
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,220
We've been monitoring
your physical health,
all of you.

626
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,289
But angel
developed some anomalies

627
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:22,991
that required
closer inspection.

628
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:26,127
She's just a kid.

629
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:28,396
No. She's not.

630
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,267
She's extraordinary.

631
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,569
All of you are.

632
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,339
Then why
did you abandon us?

633
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,579
We kept you here
until we knew
that your DNA was stable.

634
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,549
I brought you to
the house so you could

635
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,117
develop physically
and emotionally,

636
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,520
and then I left.

637
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,891
So you could
learn independence.

638
01:04:58,027 --> 01:05:00,195
It's the same process
that every child goes through.

639
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,233
God, you actually
believe that, don't you?

640
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:08,303
You really think
that what you did
was for the best?

641
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:10,672
No, not for you, Max. No.

642
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,042
For everyone.

643
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,281
Why do you think
you were created
in the first place?

644
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,285
I don't know. Maybe
you were just really,
really bored one day.

645
01:05:25,554 --> 01:05:27,989
Most scientists
serve a larger purpose.

646
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,926
To help people,

647
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:34,262
to better the world,
to save it.

648
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,267
Their methods may differ,
but it's always
for the greater good.

649
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,404
And what about the people
you hurt along the way?

650
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:43,972
They don't count?

651
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:49,477
Variables.

652
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:55,317
There's only
success or failure.

653
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,087
And you, Max, are a success.

654
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:02,657
Lucky me.

655
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,127
So what happens now?

656
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:09,731
Unfortunately,
now that the illusion
has been shattered,

657
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11,333
we will have to
keep you here.

658
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,302
At least for now.

659
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,639
Home sweet home.

660
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:23,211
You really should
try the cookie, Max.

661
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:27,349
They're homemade.

662
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,393
I know you let Ari
become an eraser.

663
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,528
It was his choice.

664
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:42,697
You could have
stopped him if you tried.

665
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:45,567
There are some things
in life that are
out of our control.

666
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,372
Accepting that
is just another part
of growing up.

667
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:59,214
I don't like
chocolate chip
cookies anymore.

668
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:03,251
I've outgrown them.

669
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,337
I'm done.

670
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,110
Come on!

671
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,048
Get in the cage.

672
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,088
Get in the cage.

673
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,190
Or what?

674
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:45,326
Yeah, that's what I thought.

675
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:48,797
I'm not afraid of you.

676
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:50,432
I don't care
what you've done to yourself.

677
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:53,768
You're still the same weak,
pathetic little boy

678
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:55,804
desperate for approval.

679
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:58,840
And you're not
gonna lay a hand on me.

680
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,442
You know why?

681
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:04,079
Because daddy
wouldn't like it.

682
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,114
Get in the cage.

683
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:10,085
Get in the cage.

684
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:23,331
Is it true? Was it him?

685
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,470
Yeah, it's true.
Jeb's alive.

686
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:31,172
Alive and a traitor.

687
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:33,842
I'd rather he was dead.

688
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,578
So what do we do?

689
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:39,814
There's not much we can do.

690
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:41,816
They're out there
and we're locked in here.

691
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:45,687
So you have a plan, right?

692
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:48,256
No. I don't, actually.

693
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,361
And the thing is,
Jeb said some stuff about us,

694
01:08:53,696 --> 01:08:56,731
why we're here,
and it sounded
really important.

695
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:57,799
I think we should trust him.

696
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:01,202
- Trust him? We can't.
- Are you serious? No.

697
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,504
Are you out of your mind?

698
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,739
Max, he's gonna
turn us into an eraser.

699
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,875
What are you
talking about?
You can't keep...

700
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,512
<i> No, we can't...</i>

701
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,647
No, Max, no.

702
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,616
After everything
he's done.

703
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:16,451
Max! Max!
This isn't fair.
We can't trust him.

704
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,719
There is no way!

705
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:19,154
Oh, my god.

706
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,221
Look where we are.

707
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,358
It makes no sense, Max.

708
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,560
<i> Angel, can you hear me?</i>

709
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,930
<i> We're being watched.</i>
<i> And we can't trust Jeb.</i>

710
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:31,599
<i> We're getting out</i>
<i> of here tonight.</i>

711
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,434
<i> Tell the others.</i>

712
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,219
<i>How's Dr. batchelder</i>
<i>handling the reunion?</i>

713
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,289
<i>If you're not up to this...</i>

714
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:30,258
I...

715
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,362
I'm afraid he may be
losing his conviction.

716
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:35,863
<i>What makes you say that?</i>

717
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,801
His behavior indicates that

718
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:41,669
he's become emotional
with the subject.

719
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:41,669
He's grown attached.

720
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:44,973
<i> Well, she'll never</i>
<i> trust him again after this.</i>

721
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,810
And I'm not sure
if he's capable
of following through.

722
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:50,645
He's always been soft.

723
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,714
That's what makes him good
at what he does.

724
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:55,350
<i> Yes.</i>

725
01:10:55,352 --> 01:10:58,519
What he doesn't understand
is that they're not human.

726
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,323
The most dangerous mistake
is to think of them
as if they are.

727
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,459
They're expendable.

728
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,394
If this gets out of control,

729
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:10,765
we have other facilities,
other products.
We pick up and move on.

730
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:11,532
<i> Yes, madam.</i>

731
01:11:11,534 --> 01:11:16,504
If we fail here,
we need to be prepared
to walk away from a loss.

732
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:19,807
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> he sees it that way.</i>

733
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,645
This program is a failure
if we can't control them.

734
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,848
Jeb seems to have forgotten
that they are weapons.

735
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,052
<i>Very dangerous weapons.</i>

736
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:52,940
What do you want?

737
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,342
Just enjoying the view.

738
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,744
You know, I don't think
you're supposed to be in here.

739
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,846
Why don't I just
scream and find out?

740
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:00,548
Oh, I wouldn't,
if I were you.

741
01:12:01,784 --> 01:12:01,783
Wow.

742
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:05,320
Threatening a girl
while she's locked in a cage.

743
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,455
That's low, even for you.

744
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:09,724
You're such a coward.

745
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,996
Max, I could rip
your throat out
with my bare hands.

746
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:17,098
So what's stopping you?

747
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:20,001
It's just you and me.
Prove it.

748
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,003
You think
I'm gonna let you out?

749
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:25,740
How stupid do you think
i am, Max?

750
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,676
Pretty stupid.

751
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:53,968
Come on.

752
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,846
All right,
we all know the plan?

753
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:13,988
Come on.

754
01:13:16,993 --> 01:13:20,461
Nudge, you guys head
for the main power.

755
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:22,163
You know how to
shut it down, right?

756
01:13:22,165 --> 01:13:25,466
Take my hand.
I know
what I'm doing.

757
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:28,002
You know
where this place is?

758
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:31,706
Don't worry.
I know where
the chemical room is.

759
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:32,940
Come on,
we gotta move fast.

760
01:13:34,777 --> 01:13:38,646
There's been
a breach in sector five
and sector three and four.

761
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:40,415
Send in the erasers.

762
01:13:43,485 --> 01:13:44,619
Do you know
which switch it is?

763
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,857
Come on, quickly, hurry.

764
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,798
You know what?

765
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,833
I guess I'll shut down
the entire power source.

766
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:12,113
Run!

767
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,495
Please hurry.
I know.

768
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:38,873
How we doing?

769
01:14:47,649 --> 01:14:49,617
Gazzy?
I'm done.

770
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:50,718
Yeah?
Yeah.

771
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:57,718
This is the end.

772
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:09,230
You're never
leaving this place alive.

773
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:11,299
There's no way out, Max.

774
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:18,973
There's always a way out.

775
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,709
Ari!

776
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,241
Max. Don't.

777
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:30,311
You're not ready.

778
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,248
You don't understand
what's happening, Max.

779
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,384
Trust me.

780
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:38,819
Never again.

781
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:40,655
Max, please!

782
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:49,964
And don't bother
looking for us, Jeb.
This experiment's over.

783
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:26,067
You came.
Of course, I came.

784
01:18:26,435 --> 01:18:28,736
I'll always come for you
no matter what.

785
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:30,838
You scared me to death.

786
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,307
So what now?

787
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:38,179
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

788
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:44,985
Max.

789
01:18:46,321 --> 01:18:47,488
Max.

790
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,390
What's wrong? Max?

791
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,445
Hey, you're back.

792
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:47,381
What the hell happened?

793
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:49,784
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

794
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:51,919
Are you okay?

795
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,421
Yeah.

796
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:56,056
I think so.

797
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,893
I thought I lost you again.

798
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:01,195
You got to stop
doing that to me.

799
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,798
I'll work on it.

800
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:10,171
I thought you were blind.

801
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:11,405
Your breathing changed.

802
01:20:14,042 --> 01:20:15,342
What happened?

803
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,111
It looked like
you were having a seizure.

804
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:19,480
Yeah, you were shaking
and mumbling and stuff.

805
01:20:20,248 --> 01:20:25,519
My head felt like
it was gonna explode,
and then I saw things.

806
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:26,954
What kind of things?

807
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:29,223
Images, New York City.

808
01:20:29,457 --> 01:20:31,959
There was this building
filled with files,

809
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,495
and one of them
had my name on it.

810
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,897
New York?

811
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:40,601
What do you think it means?

812
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:42,536
I don't know.
It was like a memory,

813
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:44,138
but I've never
been there before.

814
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:46,006
We should go.

815
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:47,942
Sounds like a trap.

816
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:49,143
No, she's right.

817
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:52,346
We need answers,
and this is the first clue
we've ever had.

818
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:52,580
It couldn't hurt.

819
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:56,517
It's not like we have
anywhere else to go.

820
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,265
<i> So,</i>
<i> we're going to New York.</i>

821
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:20,541
<i> And don't bother</i>
<i> looking for us, Jeb.</i>
<i> This experiment's over.</i>

822
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:26,213
<i> And don't bother</i>
<i> looking for us, Jeb.</i>
<i> This experiment's over.</i>

823
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:31,352
<i> And don't bother</i>
<i> looking for us, Jeb.</i>
<i> This experiment's over.</i>

824
01:21:32,455 --> 01:21:34,188
<i> This experiment's over.</i>
