1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,995
We were promised change,

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,903
but it didn't come...

3
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:08,244
not the way they said
it would, at least.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,770
We wore pins and put stickers
on our cars and bikes.

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,506
We forwarded emails to our
friends and did everything we

6
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:16,382
were supposed to do.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:22,250
But in the end, nothing
much happened.

8
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,821
Here and
now we start something new,

9
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:30,192
something better.

10
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:38,192
We forge together and move
ahead, and we never look back.

11
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,631
I guess we'd
all talked and laughed and

12
00:00:41,636 --> 00:00:44,136
maybe even hoped that
someday it would all

13
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:45,538
come crumbling down.

14
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:52,639
We envisioned bankers in
expensive suits sobbing and

15
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:56,475
wandering through a mist of
thick, falling ash, knees torn

16
00:00:56,482 --> 00:01:00,422
and caked with blood, their
bonuses no longer of any

17
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:04,719
solace or consolation,
politicians suddenly lost

18
00:01:04,722 --> 00:01:08,462
alone without the support of
their corporate masters,

19
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:11,989
shivering in homemade foxholes,
drinking their own

20
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:15,695
pee and trying to gel up their
hair with ox blood.

21
00:01:15,698 --> 00:01:19,468
But even if we believed that
this would someday come, we

22
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:21,838
couldn't really have ever
prepared for the way it was

23
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:23,967
when it finally did.

24
00:01:39,754 --> 00:01:42,764
For it matters not how small the

25
00:01:42,757 --> 00:01:45,957
beginning may seem to be.

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,560
What is once well-done
is done forever.

27
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:56,404
I guess I should
have known right off

28
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,342
the bat that Daniel would
eventually break under the

29
00:01:58,337 --> 00:02:01,337
stress and go batshit crazy.

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,970
But I managed to keep quiet and
put my faith in him like

31
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,235
everybody else.

32
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:09,213
It felt good to believe in
something bigger than myself,

33
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:12,412
and I figured at the very least,
it'd make for a killer

34
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,775
blog entry.

35
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:48,452
When Daniel
first came to my school in the

36
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,580
second grade, he had this little
ponytail and he wore a

37
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:54,446
big Hawaiian shirt that
used to be his dad's.

38
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:57,255
Some of the other guys spit on
him and called him a fag and

39
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:00,727
made fun of him all the time,
but I liked him all right,

40
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:03,587
even if he did smell like
a fucking hamster cage.

41
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:09,673
He brought these fireworks that
he'd smuggled from the

42
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,268
state he moved from, and he kept
them in this shoebox at

43
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,100
his dad's house and
hid them from me.

44
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:16,735
I never knew where it was.

45
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,940
But he'd pull it out, and we'd
go light stuff on fire in a

46
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:21,112
wheelbarrow behind his house.

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,480
Sometimes we'd pour oil in the
wheelbarrow and then light

48
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,450
fireworks into it.

49
00:03:26,448 --> 00:03:29,348
This one time his dad came home
early, and we had to rush

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,420
to put it out.

51
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:34,588
We almost burnt this tree down,
but it just got singed.

52
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,695
He wasn't ever any good
at sports like I was.

53
00:03:46,697 --> 00:03:49,857
I was always kind of cool at
everything, and I got along

54
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:51,326
with everybody.

55
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,834
And that's why people wouldn't
pick on Daniel so much,

56
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,796
because they knew he
was my friend.

57
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,774
And if they said anything,
I'd probably

58
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:59,202
punch them in the face.

59
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,488
What
experience and history teach

60
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:25,161
us is that people and
governments have never learned

61
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:27,832
anything from history.

62
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:34,071
We have been saturated with
unbearable facts, assaulted

63
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:38,039
every morning with headlines
detailing our complicit

64
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,608
involvement in great
global crimes.

65
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,380
We have seen there is
nothing we can do.

66
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:52,109
And so our only choice is
to create something new,

67
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,516
something of our own.

68
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,390
Here, we can do what we want.

69
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:04,160
Here, we can create what
we all desire.

70
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,689
We can create real change.

71
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:13,297
We, a loose
confederation of strangers and

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,070
casual acquaintances, forged a
sacred bond and trust that

73
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,300
pushed forward into a limitless
destiny of hope and

74
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,666
possibility.

75
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:25,384
Like pure sunlight on the wings
of an aged dove, we

76
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,237
hoped and dreamed of
better days and

77
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:30,275
beautiful things to come.

78
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:07,082
- I
- feel really good...

79
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:09,111
really, really good.

80
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,216
I feel like the heart...

81
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:12,047
the heartbeat of the earth.

82
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,652
And I'm sure it's not mine.

83
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:16,353
This is not my own.

84
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:17,685
Um.

85
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:19,419
Back when my dad
was a kid, a bunch of guys

86
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:23,034
tried to start their own cities
in the woods and stuff.

87
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,157
Most of them just wanted to get
naked and roll around in

88
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:29,832
the mud, or wear overalls with
no shirts underneath, or milk

89
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:33,402
goats and play banjo
music and stuff.

90
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,942
Most of them moved back to the
cities before too long.

91
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,338
They got jobs at banks and
invented new microchips,

92
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,681
started collecting expensive
bottles of wine and carrying

93
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:47,407
canvas tote bags to the store,
trying to take a one-minute

94
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,414
shower, as if that was
going to do anything.

95
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:55,248
Their heads were probably in the
wrong places at the time,

96
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:57,694
or maybe they weren't dedicated.

97
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,089
Poor planning, perhaps.

98
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:06,225
This year,
according to "The Wall Street

99
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,259
Journal," the top first five
financial firms are...

100
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:11,925
These are
in no particular order, but,

101
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:16,874
uh, flag design, uniform
design, c crest,

102
00:07:16,872 --> 00:07:18,912
credo, group name.

103
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,837
We definitely need a
Wikipedia entry.

104
00:07:21,843 --> 00:07:27,953
An insignia, national anthem,
and a Facebook group as well.

105
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,248
So have we done the
Facebook group?

106
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,509
-Yesterday.

107
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,876
And, uh, we're definitely gonna
need some more pictures

108
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,645
on there, guys.

109
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:37,393
Beach ball thing, uh, was...

110
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:38,449
was great.

111
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,786
We got some really good
comments on that.

112
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,891
Anybody else?

113
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,832
A little inspiration?

114
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:46,227
Yes, Tanner?

115
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:51,469
- I was thinking maybe for the
name, The Resilience Alliance.

116
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:55,837
And then for the flag I was
thinking a hand with a fuckin'

117
00:07:55,838 --> 00:07:57,998
eyeball on there.

118
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:00,006
Big block letters say, Revolt.

119
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:04,837
I didn't know
the rest of them very well,

120
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:06,975
except that Lucas was
a cheese dick and

121
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,010
Genevieve had a hot ass.

122
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,246
I tried to get to know them and
make up secret handshakes

123
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:16,691
and stuff, and this was met with
a pretty good response.

124
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:22,058
I myself feel
despondent, very despondent,

125
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:24,729
about the situation
into which we...

126
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,328
Make sure
these are online first, then

127
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,700
the numbers.

128
00:08:28,698 --> 00:08:30,458
We set to work
on our assigned tasks while

129
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,526
Daniel asked that Lucas set up
our online bill pay accounts

130
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:35,474
and focus primarily on
administrative affairs.

131
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,140
-Did you press One?

132
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,069
-Yeah.

133
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,543
- You still gotta press
One first.

134
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:51,523
We made certain
all our jet skis and

135
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:54,777
dirt bikes were converted to
biodiesel and agreed to use

136
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:57,816
only Dr. Bronner's in
laser printers.

137
00:08:57,822 --> 00:08:59,762
Everyone did their part.

138
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:03,287
Anna Kate tweeted with a rare
strength and diligence, and

139
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,363
Maggie alphabetized the
anarchist literature,

140
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,162
hole-punching all the loose
pages and carefully placing

141
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:11,634
everything in a highly organized
three-ring binder.

142
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:16,702
We were in the best of
spirits and had not

143
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:18,204
a care in the world.

144
00:10:56,501 --> 00:10:58,131
I tried to get
started on the pledge of

145
00:10:58,135 --> 00:11:01,935
allegiance, originally
structuring it like a haiku,

146
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:04,138
but it was taking a little more
time than I anticipated.

147
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:23,715
Daniel told me
once when we were in junior

148
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,393
high that he was born with
this feeling like someday

149
00:11:26,392 --> 00:11:29,732
everyone was going to know his
name, like at some point he

150
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,598
would do something, and they
would all know who he was,

151
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:35,657
like people would look to him,
and he'd be known as the

152
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,766
source of something great.

153
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:40,898
- I have the people behind
me, and the

154
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:43,004
people are my strength.

155
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:51,942
(FORCEFULLY) I have the people
behind me, and the people are

156
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,576
my strength.

157
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,211
He knew not
from where his fame and

158
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,145
fortunes would come, but he
knew they were out there

159
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,851
somewhere, and he never
let this nagging

160
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,393
feeling leave his side.

161
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,417
-Daniel?

162
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,191
Are we putting these
anywhere special?

163
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,860
-Lucas!

164
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:10,828
Would you show Genevieve where
we're keeping the plastic

165
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:12,227
bags, please?

166
00:12:15,464 --> 00:12:18,634
Any news on the Wikipedia page?

167
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:20,503
Actually, that was rejected.

168
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:28,609
Yeah, those Wikipedian
guys are assholes.

169
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:45,847
My uncle, who
was more like my cousin

170
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:49,085
because he was only five years
older than me, loaned me this

171
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:51,621
book of scary stories
a long time ago.

172
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:54,256
And one of them was about a kid
whose parents give him a

173
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:57,061
dog they bought in Mexico,
but it turns out to

174
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:59,503
be a rat with rabies.

175
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:02,768
I asked Daniel if he thought
that ever really happened.

176
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:05,197
He said he wasn't totally sure,
and then read out of a

177
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,772
little red book he started
carrying in his back pocket.

178
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:12,172
"The people, and the people
alone, are the motive force in

179
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,175
the making of world history.

180
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,748
The masses have boundless
creative power.

181
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:20,547
They can organize themselves and
concentrate on places and

182
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,949
branches of work where
they can give full

183
00:13:22,951 --> 00:13:24,521
play to their energy.

184
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,319
They can concentrate on
production in breadth and

185
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,491
depth and create more and more
welfare undertakings for

186
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,890
themselves."

187
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:38,455
-Quick question.

188
00:13:38,463 --> 00:13:42,703
With whom of the following
pioneers of social change do

189
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:45,069
you mostly clearly identify?

190
00:13:45,068 --> 00:13:47,598
A, Thomas Jefferson.

191
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:49,943
B, Leon Trotsky.

192
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:53,568
C, Marcus Garvey or
W.E.B. DuBois.

193
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:55,714
D, Salvador Allende.

194
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:05,752
-Ha.

195
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,820
Yeah.

196
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,117
Gotta guard your stomach, chump.

197
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,287
I'm gonna work your
body every time.

198
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:25,425
Knockout!

199
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,874
A few years ago
I began to feel pretty

200
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,102
apocalyptic.

201
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,666
But I hesitated to use that...

202
00:14:41,645 --> 00:14:43,035
-Whew.

203
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,389
Daniel said the
best kind of government is

204
00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:00,990
that which governs least, so he
took a hands-off approach

205
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:03,563
and mostly let the people
do their own things.

206
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:06,902
But before too long, he became
concerned about waning

207
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:09,628
dedication and lack of focus.

208
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:12,304
He found Tanner down by the
creek, spray-painting a

209
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:15,743
diamond design on the back of
a beautiful six-point buck.

210
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,539
And Genevieve filled his desk
drawers with gallons of

211
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,511
strawberry cream cheese in an
act of solidarity with the

212
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,510
Congolese freedom fighters.

213
00:15:41,095 --> 00:15:43,495
You guys OK?

214
00:15:54,106 --> 00:15:57,706
- When liberty is mentioned, we
must always be careful to

215
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,439
observe that it is not truly
the assertion of private

216
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:06,176
interests which is thereby
designated.

217
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:07,552
Huh?

218
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,590
All our lives, we've been told
by society that we are free

219
00:16:12,587 --> 00:16:18,357
when in fact we've been trained
by all interests

220
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,789
except our own.

221
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:22,763
We've been bent to their will.

222
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:25,432
And they've convinced
us that is what we

223
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:28,371
ourselves truly desire.

224
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:32,137
If a plant cannot live
according to

225
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:36,607
its nature, it dies.

226
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,507
And so a man.

227
00:16:52,453 --> 00:16:54,153
According to
the World Glacier Monitoring

228
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:57,864
Service, glaciers across the
globe are continuing to melt

229
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,017
so fast that...

230
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,411
Sergio.

231
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:33,412
-Sergio?

232
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,880
-Luis-Fernando.

233
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,780
-Luis-Fernando.

234
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,180
-Luis-Fernando.

235
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,680
Are you gentlemen ready
to change the world?

236
00:18:46,454 --> 00:18:46,894
-Si.

237
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:47,487
-Yeah.

238
00:18:47,487 --> 00:18:48,917
Si.

239
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,561
- The falsehoods that men believe
are more culturally

240
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:57,888
significant than the facts
that they ignore.

241
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:02,034
And if a plant cannot
live according to

242
00:19:02,031 --> 00:19:05,531
its nature, it dies.

243
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:08,174
And so a man...

244
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:09,169
huh?

245
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:31,649
-OK.

246
00:19:31,656 --> 00:19:33,456
Uh, this way.

247
00:19:33,457 --> 00:19:34,117
Back this way.

248
00:19:34,124 --> 00:19:35,124
Let's...

249
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,829
- And this is something that we
see always throughout time.

250
00:19:39,828 --> 00:19:42,798
We can't escape.

251
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:00,137
-Yeah!

252
00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:01,935
When I first saw
her, I thought she was a

253
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:04,046
specter, a phantom or something.

254
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:06,718
She seemed lighter than air,
and sort of seemed to hover

255
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:08,517
out over the water.

256
00:20:08,518 --> 00:20:10,548
-Hey.

257
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:12,053
I like your dog.

258
00:20:14,556 --> 00:20:16,616
I like your dog.

259
00:20:16,624 --> 00:20:18,024
Is that a wolf?

260
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,533
What's his name?

261
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:22,957
Looks like a wolf.

262
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:24,291
Nadia had a
bad haircut and carried

263
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:26,495
sharpened bones and stuff,
like some kind of

264
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:28,597
bold fashion statement.

265
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,799
I don't know if we would have
stopped to talk if we met at

266
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,271
the mall or something.

267
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:35,139
But it was easy to get
distracted, and her eyes felt

268
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:38,268
like they had some kind of power
when you looked at them,

269
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:41,014
like some kind of rays,
like magnetic

270
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,710
rays like razor blades.

271
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:45,652
-Ooh, crawdad.

272
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,445
The
administration is intensifying

273
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,949
their push to expand government
wiretapping of

274
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:53,921
online communications, including
email, Facebook

275
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,250
postings, and internet
phone calls.

276
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,215
The administration wants
Congress to require immediate

277
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,664
compliance with wiretap
measures, including government

278
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,030
monitoring of encrypted message

279
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,628
methods on the internet.

280
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,029
The White House...

281
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,379
Some nights,
we stayed up for hours,

282
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:27,851
arguing about internet
browsers and playing

283
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,780
Chatroulette with sad
dog face masks on.

284
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:33,846
I was a Firefox man, while some
of the others were more

285
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:36,355
into Google Chrome.

286
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,757
We ended up talking with this
one guy in Korea or something,

287
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,859
but he kept screaming real loud
about fire in the streets

288
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:45,962
and stuff, so we nexted
him pretty quick.

289
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:26,172
on Monday
that the White House did have

290
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,500
unreviewable authority to
target and assassinate

291
00:22:28,505 --> 00:22:32,005
Americans anywhere in the world
if they posed a threat

292
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:33,568
to the United States.

293
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:35,036
The...

294
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:36,684
I picked up some
Spanish on a youth group

295
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:40,748
trip to Rosarito in the eight
grade, so I made small talk

296
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:43,648
with Sergio and Luis-Fernando.

297
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,180
They knew a lot about nature,
and they told me about how

298
00:22:46,185 --> 00:22:48,685
certain trees needed the heat
of forest fires in order to

299
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:53,617
reproduce, like a phoenix from
the ashes or something.

300
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:56,564
They were pretty cool dudes, and
they gave me the nickname

301
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,760
Cabroncito.

302
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,272
Markets around
the globe continued to

303
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:16,267
plummet despite indications from
the Federal Reserve chair

304
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,570
that he would lower
interest rates.

305
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:21,212
The chair describes the
financial crisis as a threat

306
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:22,307
of historic dimensions.

307
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:24,938
- Ooh, you missed all the stuff.

308
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,843
(SINGING) They don't
love you like that.

309
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:58,604
-Hey, how's it been going?

310
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:02,706
Hey, could I get your number
just to chit-chat, maybe go to

311
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,409
a Red Robin or something?

312
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:06,311
I like your tunic.

313
00:25:06,311 --> 00:25:07,311
You look great.

314
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:10,652
It's like Fifth Dimension,
real chic.

315
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:12,047
Fuck.

316
00:25:19,522 --> 00:25:20,752
I think Nadia was into me as

317
00:25:20,756 --> 00:25:22,256
soon as she saw me.

318
00:25:22,257 --> 00:25:25,417
But she didn't want to seem
too eager, so she kind of

319
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,686
played hard to get.

320
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,804
I guess I liked that OK at
first, but after a while it

321
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:33,497
got kind of boring, and I just
wanted to cut to the chase.

322
00:25:58,154 --> 00:26:00,624
After we took
care of business, had the

323
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:03,493
Tumblr page up and running, and
put our logo on a bunch of

324
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:06,562
bumper stickers and stuff, and
had thousands of followers on

325
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:10,331
our Twitter feed, our hands
began to grow idle, and we

326
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,930
searched for new ways to express

327
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:14,931
our dissent and passion.

328
00:28:00,435 --> 00:28:01,625
God!

329
00:28:04,872 --> 00:28:06,672
Before too long, Daniel became

330
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,343
frustrated.

331
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:11,341
Sergio and Luis-Fernando weren't
working out the way

332
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:12,414
he'd hoped.

333
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:14,481
And things weren't coming
together the way

334
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:17,379
he'd seen in his mind.

335
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:20,251
He started pacing around a lot
and scratching at his head and

336
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:23,450
balls like some kind
of nervous tic.

337
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:26,193
I don't know if anyone else
noticed it, but I had thought

338
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:27,959
it was kind of strange
and telling.

339
00:28:32,427 --> 00:28:35,157
-Whew.

340
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,503
Ah.

341
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:43,065
Riot police faced a

342
00:28:43,069 --> 00:28:46,799
crowd of at least 1,000.

343
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:48,395
Riot police...

344
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,754
- Does anybody know how to
program this fucking thing?

345
00:28:57,747 --> 00:28:59,247
Pelosi was on "Charlie Rose."

346
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:02,348
with rocks
and Molotov cocktails.

347
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:10,085
-Fuck.

348
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:28,097
After the fall
of the Roman Empire, everyone

349
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:29,866
was running around like chickens
with their heads cut

350
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:32,574
off, pissing and shitting
themselves and

351
00:29:32,576 --> 00:29:34,206
howling like wolves.

352
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,980
Some people went instantly
blind and lost the use of

353
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:39,149
their limbs.

354
00:29:39,147 --> 00:29:41,277
They should have seen it coming.

355
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:44,182
It wasn't like one thing at
once, like a magical button

356
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,954
was pressed on high like they
make it out to seem.

357
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:50,653
It was a convergence of forces,
overlapping waves of

358
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,786
breakdown built up over time.

359
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,931
Anyone else could have seen it
coming from over a mile away.

360
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,487
All the signs were there.

361
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,899
- Lucas is passing out some
handouts on our new

362
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,372
letterhead.

363
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,070
I'd love to get some feedback
from you guys on this.

364
00:30:11,072 --> 00:30:16,012
We went with Arial Black, all
caps, nice and crisp.

365
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:18,939
So take a look at those
while we get this

366
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:21,945
PowerPoint juiced up here.

367
00:30:21,948 --> 00:30:23,348
Hey, Dean?

368
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:27,419
How about no Virtual Boy,
just for the meeting?

369
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,589
Please put it away.

370
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:30,987
Thanks, man.

371
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:36,063
Lucas, excuse me.

372
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:39,688
Can you give me a hand
over here, please?

373
00:30:39,694 --> 00:30:41,094
Uh, am I doing something wrong?

374
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:49,733
All right, guys?

375
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:53,135
Actually, those pretzels were
an after-meeting treat.

376
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:55,568
If we could just round
those back up again.

377
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:57,573
Bryce, maybe...

378
00:30:57,575 --> 00:30:58,765
thanks.

379
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:10,024
All right, we seem
to be having some

380
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,650
technical issues up here.

381
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,045
Uh...

382
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:22,029
we should have this system fully

383
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,230
operational as of 1100 hours.

384
00:31:26,233 --> 00:31:27,503
Is that good for everybody?

385
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,730
Any possible conflicts?

386
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:31,795
All right, thanks, you
all, for coming.

387
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,743
We still have the pretzels
to look forward

388
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:37,168
to, so it'll be good.

389
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:47,853
All the bills were paid
on time and all

390
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,520
the connections secure.

391
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,289
Routers, plugged, unplugged?

392
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,218
Two or three times.

393
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:56,823
Well then,
you're going to have to go

394
00:31:56,824 --> 00:32:00,664
into town and have a talk with
these people, because this is

395
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:03,561
not going to fly.

396
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:04,963
-Sure.

397
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,379
Tanner climbed
this huge tree, and Bryce

398
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:30,524
helped him hoist the hang
glider up there.

399
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,951
Tanner took a deep breath and
jumped out, and sailed away

400
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:36,316
into a ravine a few miles down.

401
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:38,826
He saw some smoke in the
distance, but didn't think

402
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:40,188
much of it at the time.

403
00:32:40,196 --> 00:32:41,596
- The light doesn't
even come on.

404
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:40,053
Lucas came
back washed clean, like a

405
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:43,423
zombie or a mind gone wrong.

406
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:49,625
He'd seen things that no
man should ever see...

407
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:55,768
fire and brimstone, complete
chaos, like the End Times come

408
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,127
to pass before his very eyes.

409
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:07,405
All the Starbucks were up in
flames, and he saw a group of

410
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:10,752
kids crucify a German Shepherd
after beating it to death with

411
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:12,478
a "Guitar Hero" controller.

412
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,589
A Penske truck flipped over an
embankment and landed on a

413
00:34:19,589 --> 00:34:23,559
family carrying sniper rifles
and suitcases full of ground

414
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:24,759
beef and stuff.

415
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:30,832
He said there was nothing left.

416
00:34:30,832 --> 00:34:33,332
He said he barely got out alive.

417
00:35:29,754 --> 00:35:31,594
This is just
the sort of thing we've

418
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:34,659
been planning for, right?

419
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:37,388
Isn't this why we moved out
here in the first place?

420
00:35:41,164 --> 00:35:45,704
To create something new,
something different?

421
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:55,042
Maybe this is a push in
the right direction.

422
00:35:55,043 --> 00:36:00,513
Maybe this is fate.

423
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:01,714
Look around us.

424
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:08,154
Here, we are safe.

425
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:13,024
In the woods, we are kings.

426
00:36:13,025 --> 00:36:14,415
Just look at this encampment.

427
00:36:16,694 --> 00:36:20,464
This is our place, my friends.

428
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:25,204
This is our time.

429
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:29,401
History does nothing.

430
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:32,974
It does not possess
immense riches.

431
00:36:32,974 --> 00:36:35,044
It does not fight battles.

432
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,642
It is men...

433
00:36:36,643 --> 00:36:38,443
real, living...

434
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:39,784
who do all this.

435
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,751
We've lost a fond love,
my friends.

436
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,824
But we've inherited the Earth.

437
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:11,504
Daniel said he
saw it coming off in the

438
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:16,066
distance, like a giant
vulture or something.

439
00:37:16,076 --> 00:37:19,176
He acted tough in front of
everyone else, but before he

440
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:22,849
gave his big talk, he came
crying to me, sobbing and

441
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:24,248
bawling like a homo.

442
00:37:30,821 --> 00:37:34,221
I felt kind of numb, like I
heard what he was saying and

443
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:37,194
everything, but it wasn't
really getting through.

444
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:45,528
It was like a complete and total
shift of consciousness

445
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:49,403
all in one quick second, like
someone ripped off your head

446
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:51,743
and showed you your soul to you
while your heart was still

447
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:56,138
pumping good and strong, a
feeling of complete panic and

448
00:37:56,141 --> 00:38:00,311
terror not because of any
immediate threat or danger but

449
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:04,451
just because of the vast unknown
as suddenly everything

450
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,618
you ever believed or held true
and dear was proved wrong like

451
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:11,387
a card trick, like you just
got punked, but there's no

452
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:15,357
Ashton Kutcher to deliver the
good news, just the slightly

453
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:17,957
sinister smile of eternity
staring back

454
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:19,359
straight through you.

455
00:38:28,302 --> 00:38:30,502
- Hey, your sink isn't
working either?

456
00:38:35,875 --> 00:38:38,835
Is it safe to drink that?

457
00:38:38,844 --> 00:38:40,444
-River water?

458
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,805
-Yeah.

459
00:38:41,813 --> 00:38:43,813
-You have to boil it.

460
00:38:43,815 --> 00:38:45,645
-Oh, just boil it, huh?

461
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,050
Should have thought of that.

462
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:49,822
Yeah, we're gonna have
to make Ramen and

463
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,490
stuff, so good to know.

464
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:11,144
Sergio and
Luis-Fernando told me they

465
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:15,309
were going to take off, but
I didn't tell Daniel.

466
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:17,779
I asked how they were going to
survive out there, and they

467
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:20,248
said they wanted to find their
girlfriends if they were still

468
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:24,417
alive and maybe try to figure
their own thing out.

469
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:29,592
-OK, here's the score.

470
00:39:29,587 --> 00:39:34,057
They made off with a half-bag of
trail mix, couple chewies,

471
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:37,288
and the remainder of our Wild
Cherry Capri Sun stockpile.

472
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,334
Oh, shit.

473
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:41,059
-I know.

474
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:43,504
We should have seen this coming.

475
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:49,469
That Sergio always seemed
slightly uncommitted to me,

476
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:50,671
kind of shifty-eyed.

477
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:59,105
But, uh, you know, more
power to him, right?

478
00:39:59,112 --> 00:40:03,352
If they want to play with fire,
I also have to respect a

479
00:40:03,348 --> 00:40:05,248
risk-taker.

480
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:07,879
On the home front,
compliments...

481
00:40:07,884 --> 00:40:09,284
- We should boil the
river water.

482
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:40,109
- Tanner, do you mind passing
out some Dews to

483
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:42,482
whoever wants one?

484
00:40:46,184 --> 00:40:48,954
The loss of
power and connectivity was

485
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,553
something that none of
us could ever have

486
00:40:50,554 --> 00:40:51,754
truly prepared for.

487
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,889
Genevieve held an informal
funeral for her Facebook page,

488
00:41:00,896 --> 00:41:02,626
her status forever immortalized.

489
00:41:05,634 --> 00:41:08,534
Every Thursday night, when
"Project Runway" would

490
00:41:08,536 --> 00:41:11,966
normally have come on, Anna
Kate's eyes would well up

491
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:16,912
uncontrollably and she'd shiver
softly in the darkness.

492
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:14,855
- (SINGING SOFTLY) Life
is a highway.

493
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:21,535
I want to ride it
all night long.

494
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:29,538
If you're going my way, I want
to drive it all night long.

495
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:36,015
I want to ride it
all night long.

496
00:43:02,243 --> 00:43:04,543
- We can probably get maple
syrup from these trees.

497
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:26,631
-Anything?

498
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:31,625
-Not yet.

499
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,540
Bryce and Anna
Kate said they'd spotted a

500
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:45,445
bunch of rainbow trout in the
river, and hoped to try and

501
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:48,277
catch them in a laundry
basket or something.

502
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:51,283
But upon hearing this, Daniel
struck a somber tone and said

503
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:53,646
that the wild fish would most
likely be chock full of

504
00:43:53,655 --> 00:43:56,755
dangerous levels of mercury
and other heavy metals and

505
00:43:56,758 --> 00:43:58,488
toxins and stuff.

506
00:43:58,493 --> 00:44:00,563
He said they should be
avoided at all costs.

507
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:12,365
- So textile fabrication,
linens and leathers.

508
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:14,641
Seasonal beautification.

509
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:15,869
Mat-making.

510
00:44:15,873 --> 00:44:19,513
It would be nice to get
a sundial going.

511
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:20,609
Foraging.

512
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,980
Trapping.

513
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:23,608
Hunter-gathering.

514
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:31,083
-We brought gifts.

515
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,520
-Cool.

516
00:44:51,002 --> 00:44:52,872
I have a few things I'd
like to quickly

517
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,340
discuss with you guys.

518
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:56,338
If we're going to make this work
out here, we're going to

519
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,410
need to assign people
a specific position.

520
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:04,179
We're going to need a hunter,
a gatherer, a forager.

521
00:45:04,179 --> 00:45:06,579
We're going to need
a cartographer.

522
00:45:06,581 --> 00:45:07,611
We may also have...

523
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:09,752
need for...

524
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:10,750
Jesus.

525
00:45:36,574 --> 00:45:39,174
The power was
gone for good, but all the

526
00:45:39,176 --> 00:45:42,536
appliances were still there.

527
00:45:42,546 --> 00:45:45,146
After a while, it all started
to seem spooky or sort of

528
00:45:45,148 --> 00:45:51,118
haunted to me, like electro
ghosts from a distant past,

529
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,089
like the dishwasher had
a mind of its own.

530
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:59,059
And like Genevieve's iPad was
silently whispering to me,

531
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:02,989
hinting at its darkest fears and
deepest hopes that, sadly

532
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,556
but surely, would never
come to pass.

533
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:12,337
The beginning and end
of all things.

534
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:15,437
The ability to cast out
all doubts and fears.

535
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:35,688
OK, OK.

536
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,263
So should I call her?

537
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,231
-No!

538
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,988
This is a really critical time.

539
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:41,856
If you find yourself
reaching for that

540
00:46:41,864 --> 00:46:44,004
phone, go shoe shopping.

541
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,829
Get your butt in a bubble bath.

542
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:49,995
- She has to know that
you're not ready.

543
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:52,304
- So do you think that
I'll lose her?

544
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:55,506
- Oh, honey, you're not
a total loser.

545
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:59,209
- (EMPHATICALLY) I said, do you
think that I'll lose her?

546
00:46:59,211 --> 00:47:00,581
-Cut.

547
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:03,379
Tanner, I'm still not seeing
much change on that last line.

548
00:47:03,381 --> 00:47:04,911
Genevieve, where's the conflict?

549
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:06,445
We're going for another take.

550
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:11,075
-Do you think that she'll...

551
00:47:48,354 --> 00:47:49,554
-Mmm.

552
00:48:10,073 --> 00:48:12,543
One night,
Genevieve got a fever and

553
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:15,742
started shaking and writhing
around on the couch.

554
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:18,405
We covered her with the Tupac
blanket, and she started

555
00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:21,314
blurting out the names of
different Tom Hanks movies,

556
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:23,616
sometimes reciting the
plots and stuff in

557
00:48:23,618 --> 00:48:25,648
weird bursts and fits.

558
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,393
She spoke the lyrics of a 4 Non
Blondes song and listed

559
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:32,559
off, like, hundreds of brand
name candies and snack foods.

560
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,759
It freaked the shit out of me,
like some thing that you just

561
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:36,061
can't un-see.

562
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,402
And I was so disturbed,
I had to take a walk

563
00:48:38,397 --> 00:48:41,357
deep into the woods.

564
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:03,520
The true
courage of civilized nations

565
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,220
is readiness for sacrifice in
the service of the state.

566
00:49:09,225 --> 00:49:14,995
The important thing here is not
the personal medals but

567
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:17,227
aligning oneself with
the universal.

568
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:29,069
This is a dark time, but it
is surely not a Dark Age.

569
00:49:29,075 --> 00:49:36,505
We are a glowing sea, and soon
we will spread our light.

570
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:42,445
A revolution is not having a
dinner party or writing an

571
00:49:42,454 --> 00:49:46,424
essay or painting a picture
or doing embroidery.

572
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:02,639
- I don't know if your grandma
ever does this, but Daniel is

573
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,009
always trying to get me
to rake up, do stuff I

574
00:50:05,008 --> 00:50:06,408
don't want to do.

575
00:50:11,246 --> 00:50:14,906
Can I see your staff thing?

576
00:50:14,915 --> 00:50:17,375
Sweet.

577
00:50:18,718 --> 00:50:20,978
The road to
communal actualization is

578
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:26,156
paved with intention, attention,
invention,

579
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:31,327
selection, application,
and computization.

580
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:39,667
Has anybody seen Dean?

581
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:44,637
Dean?

582
00:50:49,008 --> 00:50:52,208
-It's like a abacus.

583
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:53,411
Sorry.

584
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:57,781
So.

585
00:51:00,885 --> 00:51:02,275
Is that a goat hoof?

586
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:07,189
That's pretty... sorry.

587
00:51:27,676 --> 00:51:32,746
- Bryce, which of the following
personal weaknesses is most

588
00:51:32,747 --> 00:51:35,677
damaging to collective
enterprise?

589
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:37,953
A, defiance.

590
00:51:37,951 --> 00:51:40,351
B, waning dedication.

591
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:42,453
C, demagogic
factionalism/partisanship.

592
00:51:45,157 --> 00:51:47,017
D, private indulgence.

593
00:51:51,996 --> 00:51:57,326
I've been sensing some tensions
within the group.

594
00:51:57,334 --> 00:52:03,804
And to be honest with you, Lucas
is not of much help to

595
00:52:03,806 --> 00:52:05,636
me anymore.

596
00:52:05,641 --> 00:52:09,511
You know some of these people
better than I do.

597
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:15,681
And in particular Bryce has been
making me uncomfortable.

598
00:52:15,683 --> 00:52:17,763
- I don't think you know Bryce
like you think you do.

599
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:26,493
- Listen, man, I heard him
calling me penis breath.

600
00:52:26,492 --> 00:52:27,262
-Did he say that?

601
00:52:27,259 --> 00:52:28,629
Yeah.

602
00:52:28,627 --> 00:52:32,187
And everybody was laughing
and slapping fives.

603
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:33,026
Well,

604
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,000
-I mean, it is kind of funny.

605
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:37,257
-Yeah, it's kind of funny.

606
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:40,866
It's nice to see people's
spirits high, but not when

607
00:52:40,869 --> 00:52:42,369
it's at somebody's expense.

608
00:52:49,476 --> 00:52:51,276
It's a shame.

609
00:52:51,277 --> 00:52:54,037
Man has forgotten the most
practiced form of

610
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,376
storytelling, the
oral tradition.

611
00:53:00,184 --> 00:53:04,894
One evening an old Cherokee
chief told his grandson a

612
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:09,958
story about a battle that
goes on inside people.

613
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:14,889
He said it's a battle
between two wolves.

614
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:16,826
One is evil.

615
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:23,971
It is greed, anger, arrogance,
and jealousy.

616
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,941
The other is good.

617
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:31,979
It is hope, love, generosity,
and faith.

618
00:53:31,977 --> 00:53:34,537
The grandson thought about
this for a minute.

619
00:53:34,546 --> 00:53:38,506
And then he asked his
grandfather, grandfather,

620
00:53:38,516 --> 00:53:41,446
which wolf wins?

621
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:47,562
The old Cherokee chief simply
replied, the one you feed.

622
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:12,308
Days turned to
months, weeks, maybe decades.

623
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:14,614
Who knows?

624
00:54:14,616 --> 00:54:16,676
Provisions wore thin.

625
00:54:16,684 --> 00:54:19,454
Tensions rose.

626
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:22,923
Tanner told me that he thought
Daniel was a cock suck, and

627
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:25,923
that he was ready to mutiny.

628
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:30,256
He said other people were
feeling the same way.

629
00:54:30,263 --> 00:54:33,103
I didn't know how to handle
the situation, so I just

630
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:37,029
wandered off to see Nadia again.

631
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,973
I told Nadia
about how stuff was getting

632
00:55:47,968 --> 00:55:50,398
pretty rough back at the camp.

633
00:55:50,403 --> 00:55:52,543
And it occurred to me that
I could maybe defuse the

634
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:55,808
situation by holding a secret
summit where I could introduce

635
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:59,137
Nadia to the rest of the group.

636
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:04,053
I figured her positivity and
optimism might be contagious.

637
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,947
Daniel would have to be
excluded, of course, so

638
00:56:06,949 --> 00:56:08,449
everyone agreed that
we'd keep Nadia's

639
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,650
presence secret from him.

640
00:56:18,326 --> 00:56:21,356
Over time, Nadia offered little
tips as to what could

641
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:24,302
and could not be eaten and
used in the forest.

642
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,228
- This has a Juicy Fruit
kind of taste.

643
00:56:26,233 --> 00:56:28,333
She knew a
lot of interesting stuff.

644
00:56:28,335 --> 00:56:30,635
She taught us how to collect
morning dew from the leaves of

645
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,537
the mighty Madrone and showed us
where we could dig up these

646
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:37,509
tubers that tasted sort of
like chili cheese Fritos.

647
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:38,709
-I'd like another.

648
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,520
-What day is it?

649
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:54,089
-Thursday, I think.

650
00:57:15,744 --> 00:57:17,384
One by one, people started

651
00:57:17,378 --> 00:57:19,078
doing their own things.

652
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:21,049
Tanner tried to build a
submarine, and Bryce drew up

653
00:57:21,047 --> 00:57:23,247
plans for a rock garden.

654
00:57:23,249 --> 00:57:25,619
I had this idea that we could
collect condensation in a

655
00:57:25,618 --> 00:57:28,348
satellite dish if we covered
it in old Doritos bags and

656
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:30,124
buried it a few feet
underground.

657
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:36,364
I found a frog with a beautiful
pattern on his back.

658
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,330
I named him Rascal.

659
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:40,458
He liked to hang out on
the Apple TV, and

660
00:57:40,463 --> 00:57:43,333
mostly kept to himself.

661
00:57:50,972 --> 00:57:53,712
-Well, seems pretty good.

662
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:55,308
I think Mossad uses these.

663
00:58:05,685 --> 00:58:08,945
You remember in the early '90s
when everyone was into those,

664
00:58:08,954 --> 00:58:13,194
like, big sleeping shirts with
the Tasmanian Devil on it?

665
00:58:13,191 --> 00:58:17,091
And he would be, like, wearing
clothes like Kris Kross, like

666
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,234
backwards jeans and
Raiders jerseys?

667
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:29,395
I bet you have to fend off
the guys all the time.

668
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:30,344
Where...

669
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:33,338
where'd you go on
your first date?

670
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:34,341
Oh.

671
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:35,542
Oh.

672
00:58:38,412 --> 00:58:42,752
You probably love your grandma
a lot, huh, seeing as how you

673
00:58:42,749 --> 00:58:44,149
guys live together?

674
00:58:46,085 --> 00:58:48,085
Your grandma must
be quite a lady.

675
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,800
I never had a grandma, but if I
did, I bet I'd be as psyched

676
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,397
on my grandma as you
are on yours.

677
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:08,396
Time moves
differently when a dim fog

678
00:59:08,404 --> 00:59:10,874
settles between the tallest
trees in the forest and

679
00:59:10,873 --> 00:59:13,613
everything's calm and still.

680
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:16,479
There's no buzzing or humming
to distract your ears or to

681
00:59:16,478 --> 00:59:19,848
pull away from your attention
from even the smallest details

682
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,248
around you.

683
00:59:23,684 --> 00:59:25,154
Everything seems bigger.

684
00:59:25,152 --> 00:59:27,522
Even the small things grow.

685
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:29,651
And little details that weren't
there before pop out

686
00:59:29,656 --> 00:59:32,986
at you, and you notice mystery
and wonder in places you used

687
00:59:32,992 --> 00:59:35,562
to look straight through.

688
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:38,361
The moss seems to move a little
on its own, and it's

689
00:59:38,363 --> 00:59:41,633
suddenly a deeper, more radiant
shade of green.

690
00:59:41,632 --> 00:59:44,372
Everything stops, and you can
get lost in the moment without

691
00:59:44,368 --> 00:59:48,868
any idea about how much
time has just gone by.

692
00:59:48,872 --> 00:59:51,572
You can look up at the sky and
try to figure out where the

693
00:59:51,574 --> 00:59:53,144
Sun is situated.

694
00:59:53,142 --> 00:59:56,382
Or you make your own sundial
using an old remote control or

695
00:59:56,378 --> 00:59:59,648
a twig, or maybe a dried-up
Red Vine or something.

696
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:05,147
-So we were excited.

697
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:07,051
We were... we were all excited
to go through.

698
01:00:07,052 --> 01:00:08,852
And then you get in there,
and it's just this

699
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:09,953
really small woman.

700
01:00:09,954 --> 01:00:11,424
She was probably 75.

701
01:00:11,422 --> 01:00:14,922
But she had her arms stuff here,
and her legs were just

702
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:16,455
steep coming out.

703
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:18,959
You know those globes where you
put your fingers and then

704
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:21,231
the... the electricity follows
your fingers?

705
01:00:21,229 --> 01:00:22,759
They were really tall ones.

706
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:26,363
Instead of trees, everything was
just really tall, sort of

707
01:00:26,366 --> 01:00:28,966
like branching off electricity.

708
01:00:28,968 --> 01:00:30,628
Like, the arms were

709
01:00:30,636 --> 01:00:32,236
electricity instead of branches.

710
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:34,967
And this woman was leading us,
but somehow she was walking on

711
01:00:34,973 --> 01:00:37,743
just these little feet.

712
01:01:44,674 --> 01:01:48,214
I was
driving in my brother's old

713
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,940
Volvo station wagon.

714
01:01:50,946 --> 01:01:54,206
And I was going on a long
trip by myself.

715
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:58,615
And I took off my shoes and put
them in the front seat.

716
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:00,649
And I got off...

717
01:02:00,654 --> 01:02:03,224
um, pulled off at a gas station.

718
01:02:03,223 --> 01:02:05,393
And I had to use the restroom,
so I wanted to put

719
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:06,721
my shoes back on.

720
01:02:06,725 --> 01:02:12,195
And, um, at that time the car
turned into my... my brown

721
01:02:12,197 --> 01:02:14,157
skirt, and I didn't notice that
it was any different.

722
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:16,625
I knew it was the same
sort of vehicle.

723
01:02:16,634 --> 01:02:19,104
Uh, and I needed to find the
shoes, so I reached into my

724
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:21,873
pocket and I pulled
out the sandals.

725
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:24,642
Then I was able to go
into the restroom.

726
01:03:28,502 --> 01:03:30,272
Sometimes you
get a feeling like something

727
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,470
is a religious experience, even
when it's not, when it's

728
01:03:33,473 --> 01:03:36,643
something simple, like maybe
you're just washing your car

729
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:39,542
or trying to focus your eyes
on some far-off image.

730
01:03:39,544 --> 01:03:42,244
It's like this spirit overtakes
you, and suddenly

731
01:03:42,246 --> 01:03:44,846
you're lighter and sort of
slowly rising up through the

732
01:03:44,848 --> 01:03:47,618
freshly-cut grass.

733
01:03:47,617 --> 01:03:51,017
Nothing can touch you,
just in that second.

734
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:56,189
Sometimes I feel like this
when I wander the halls,

735
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:59,391
calling out in the darkness,
all alone.

736
01:04:43,736 --> 01:04:45,796
I saw Daniel
standing by himself in the

737
01:04:45,804 --> 01:04:47,744
middle of this clearing.

738
01:04:47,739 --> 01:04:50,309
It looked like he was crying,
but when I asked him what he

739
01:04:50,308 --> 01:04:52,908
was doing, he said he saw the
spirit of this creature that

740
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,680
communicated with him.

741
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,949
He saw different shapes and
forms around him in the woods,

742
01:04:58,948 --> 01:05:02,818
looking after him and
his every move.

743
01:05:33,146 --> 01:05:34,646
-Om.

744
01:05:44,322 --> 01:05:45,522
-Om.

745
01:05:55,732 --> 01:05:57,132
Om.

746
01:06:18,052 --> 01:06:21,192
- Nobody puts anything away
in this fucking place.

747
01:06:21,188 --> 01:06:25,658
It is impossible to predict the
exact time and progress of

748
01:06:25,658 --> 01:06:27,118
revolution.

749
01:06:27,126 --> 01:06:32,086
It is governed by its own more
or less mysterious laws.

750
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:33,496
Where the fuck is Dean?

751
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:38,870
Huh?

752
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:40,268
Yeah!

753
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:00,248
-Brr.

754
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:01,453
Yeah.

755
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:58,709
What do you think was
better, Game Boy

756
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,180
Color or Game Boy Advance?

757
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,150
Your grandma sure is
a great cobbler.

758
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:13,245
-Oh.

759
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,160
-Hey, man.

760
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,560
-Hey, man.

761
01:08:20,561 --> 01:08:22,161
What's up?

762
01:08:22,162 --> 01:08:23,392
-Nothing.

763
01:08:23,396 --> 01:08:25,096
Just, uh, making a stick stack
here, chilling out.

764
01:08:25,097 --> 01:08:26,297
-Cute.

765
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:28,956
Hi.

766
01:08:28,966 --> 01:08:30,796
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

767
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:32,071
My name is Daniel.

768
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:35,898
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance

769
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,304
-Daniel, this is Nadia.

770
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:38,695
-Nadia?

771
01:08:38,706 --> 01:08:42,566
That was a really popular name
for a while there, wasn't it?

772
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:43,466
What you got?

773
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:44,806
Ooh.

774
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:46,710
Hip feather necklace.

775
01:08:46,711 --> 01:08:48,741
That's really ethnic.

776
01:08:48,746 --> 01:08:49,776
Huh?

777
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,380
So Dean, what's going on, man?

778
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:53,281
Everybody's wondering about you.

779
01:08:53,282 --> 01:08:54,912
Genevieve's nearly worried sick.

780
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:57,416
- I've only been gone for
half an hour, man.

781
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:58,648
-Oh.

782
01:08:58,652 --> 01:09:01,722
Well, doesn't really negate
their concerns, does it?

783
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:04,321
So, Nadia, was it?

784
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:06,623
Why is it that we haven't
met before?

785
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:08,155
Uh, she
doesn't go out much, man.

786
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:10,229
She lives with her grandma.

787
01:09:10,227 --> 01:09:11,757
-Oh.

788
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:13,291
Gosh.

789
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:16,055
Well, I don't know what, uh,
Dean's been telling you, but

790
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:17,764
actually at our camp we
have some pretty cool

791
01:09:17,765 --> 01:09:20,225
things going on.

792
01:09:20,234 --> 01:09:24,344
You look like, uh, kind of arty.

793
01:09:24,337 --> 01:09:26,897
You know what?

794
01:09:26,906 --> 01:09:29,106
Are you into live theater?

795
01:09:29,108 --> 01:09:34,378
Because this weekend, we have
the premiere performance.

796
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,679
A lot of our group members
have been working on it.

797
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:38,881
Big production.

798
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,283
You should come...

799
01:09:40,284 --> 01:09:42,554
both of you.

800
01:09:42,552 --> 01:09:43,922
Huh?

801
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,720
What do you think?

802
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,120
Will you come?

803
01:09:53,461 --> 01:09:56,201
OK, fantastic!

804
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:56,727
Great.

805
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:57,860
You hear that?

806
01:09:57,864 --> 01:10:00,304
Dean, see you this
weekend, then.

807
01:10:00,299 --> 01:10:01,669
Well, hey.

808
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:04,127
Dean, please try to make it to
dinner because Anna Kate has

809
01:10:04,136 --> 01:10:08,906
been slaving away all day on
this improv Mac and Jack fruit

810
01:10:08,907 --> 01:10:10,167
salad kind of thing.

811
01:10:10,174 --> 01:10:11,774
It's going to be kick-ass.

812
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:12,765
Be safe, though.

813
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:15,076
Have fun.

814
01:10:15,078 --> 01:10:19,348
For now, you know, hang, though.

815
01:10:33,196 --> 01:10:35,196
Nadia said
that Daniel made her feel

816
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,198
uneasy, but I assured her that
he was just going through a

817
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,101
rough time and that deep down he
really was a good guy, even

818
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:44,573
if he seemed like an asshole.

819
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,213
I told her about this time we
filled a two-liter bottle with

820
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,368
our pee and threw it out the
window of my cousin's Bronco

821
01:10:49,376 --> 01:10:55,446
at the side of a Carl's Jr. I
also told her about a time a

822
01:10:55,448 --> 01:10:58,248
few days prior when I found
Daniel all dazed down by the

823
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,120
creek, talking to himself
and weeping silently.

824
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,150
Later we went and swung on this
giant rope swing that

825
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:07,355
hung over a beautiful waterfall.

826
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:41,052
That episode
of "Law and Order...

827
01:11:41,056 --> 01:11:47,026
Special Victims Unit" you staged
was truly inspired.

828
01:11:47,028 --> 01:11:50,628
I'm going to be straight
with you.

829
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:53,301
We have a special visitor
coming to the camp this

830
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:57,130
weekend, and she's expecting
something big.

831
01:11:57,136 --> 01:11:58,596
I need you, Maggie.

832
01:12:01,807 --> 01:12:07,237
I'm really hoping that you can
commit to putting something

833
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:11,075
together that's more magical
than anything

834
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:12,481
we've seen thus far.

835
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:18,251
Can you do that, Maggie?

836
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:19,454
-Sure.

837
01:12:22,491 --> 01:12:25,161
-OK.

838
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,860
This is a happy time.

839
01:12:27,862 --> 01:12:30,932
Dean has a new love in his life.

840
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:34,171
Sure, she's had a rough
go at things.

841
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:37,227
Her eye is like, I don't know.

842
01:12:37,236 --> 01:12:39,866
But that's all the more
reason to show her

843
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:42,401
a good time, right?

844
01:12:42,406 --> 01:12:46,136
We've had some rough patches and
we've all made sacrifices.

845
01:12:46,143 --> 01:12:50,483
But we can pull this
off together.

846
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,750
Maggie's on board.

847
01:12:51,747 --> 01:12:55,047
We all have special talents
to bring to the table.

848
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:56,180
What do you guys say?

849
01:12:56,184 --> 01:12:58,584
We can make this something
magical.

850
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,160
-Hey, guys.

851
01:13:06,158 --> 01:13:08,928
Oh, I'm so glad that
you can make it.

852
01:13:08,927 --> 01:13:10,527
This is really exciting, huh?

853
01:13:10,528 --> 01:13:12,928
OK, why don't you come
in and grab a seat

854
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:13,960
right up front, OK?

855
01:13:13,964 --> 01:13:15,464
Oh, tickets?

856
01:13:15,465 --> 01:13:16,555
No?

857
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:18,830
-It's fine.

858
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:21,504
Just go sit down right there.

859
01:13:21,503 --> 01:13:22,843
Get comfortable, though.

860
01:13:22,837 --> 01:13:26,637
It's going to be a great show.

861
01:13:31,177 --> 01:13:32,477
-Yah!

862
01:13:32,478 --> 01:13:33,678
Yah!

863
01:13:41,652 --> 01:13:47,092
I'm in a world that's dead.

864
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:51,020
- We will not go quietly
into the night.

865
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:54,986
We will not vanish
without a fight.

866
01:13:54,995 --> 01:13:58,055
Tonight we fight back.

867
01:13:58,064 --> 01:14:03,004
Tonight we celebrate our
independence day.

868
01:14:11,841 --> 01:14:13,341
-I...

869
01:14:13,342 --> 01:14:15,462
I thought that you guys did
really well because, um...

870
01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:18,635
-What's that?

871
01:14:18,645 --> 01:14:19,535
-I'm freaked out, man.

872
01:14:19,545 --> 01:14:20,675
-Oh, it was just great.

873
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:22,679
-You were great, by the way.

874
01:14:22,681 --> 01:14:23,881
-Yeah.

875
01:14:23,882 --> 01:14:25,452
- The other people didn't
show up, though.

876
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:26,550
It left a little

877
01:14:26,551 --> 01:14:27,481
something to be desired.

878
01:14:27,485 --> 01:14:29,275
Am I right?

879
01:14:29,286 --> 01:14:30,286
Come on.

880
01:14:40,294 --> 01:14:42,064
I'm trying
to learn about her grandma.

881
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:50,328
Do your like plays?

882
01:14:50,335 --> 01:14:54,265
Are you... who's your
favorite writer?

883
01:14:54,271 --> 01:14:55,101
-Excuse me.

884
01:14:55,105 --> 01:14:57,035
Nadia, I have a question.

885
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,070
Everybody is curious.

886
01:14:59,075 --> 01:15:00,265
Everybody wants to know.

887
01:15:00,276 --> 01:15:02,906
Are you Greek?

888
01:15:02,911 --> 01:15:04,041
-What the fuck, man?

889
01:15:04,045 --> 01:15:05,405
What kind of thing
is that to say?

890
01:15:05,413 --> 01:15:07,083
Look, everybody wants to...

891
01:15:07,081 --> 01:15:09,411
everybody's made uncomfortable
by her presence, Dean.

892
01:15:09,416 --> 01:15:11,576
- Uh, I think we're all made
uncomfortable by your

893
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:12,424
presence, Daniel.

894
01:15:12,418 --> 01:15:13,118
You're fucked up.

895
01:15:13,118 --> 01:15:15,418
You should back off.

896
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,520
-You back off!

897
01:15:16,521 --> 01:15:18,691
You...

898
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:20,319
-Fuck off.

899
01:15:20,323 --> 01:15:21,523
-Fuck!

900
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,690
Fuck you, man.

901
01:15:26,695 --> 01:15:28,325
Fuck!

902
01:15:28,329 --> 01:15:32,929
Fuck this scene, you
boozy shit rags!

903
01:15:32,932 --> 01:15:35,832
Fuck this whole bullshit

904
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:40,004
anti-revolutionary cock teasing.

905
01:15:40,004 --> 01:15:43,274
You spoiled, whipped bastard.

906
01:15:43,273 --> 01:15:47,143
Just go home to the fucking
suburbs, you rat shit.

907
01:16:26,445 --> 01:16:29,445
In times of
great struggle and strife,

908
01:16:29,448 --> 01:16:33,418
some people shrink and fall and
falter while others gain

909
01:16:33,418 --> 01:16:37,018
momentum and grow and
get stronger.

910
01:16:37,021 --> 01:16:38,891
We are not victims.

911
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:40,289
We are not innocent bystanders.

912
01:16:46,695 --> 01:16:49,455
I want to become natural again.

913
01:16:49,464 --> 01:16:52,474
I want to be a force to
be reckoned with.

914
01:16:52,467 --> 01:16:55,027
I want to dump a glass of water
on my head and have a

915
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:58,436
tree grow out where my
hair used to be.

916
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:01,739
I want to be strong and
free and young.

917
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,412
I want to be breathe fire and
melt shit with the force of my

918
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,741
sheer will.

919
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:10,776
I want to stay alive forever,
and I want you here with me as

920
01:17:10,782 --> 01:17:12,522
we watch it build back.

921
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:45,579
I searched for Daniel
for many days.

922
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:48,182
I found some bones in a cave and
the remnants of some old

923
01:17:48,184 --> 01:17:49,954
clothing that didn't
belong to him.

924
01:17:53,588 --> 01:17:56,058
I stumbled across a serpent in
the brush, and it spoke to me

925
01:17:56,057 --> 01:17:58,457
in a cool and hollow tone.

926
01:17:58,459 --> 01:18:02,729
It whispered in a soft tuxedo
voice, the damned remain

927
01:18:02,729 --> 01:18:05,329
motionless, and slithered away.

928
01:18:54,712 --> 01:18:55,712
-Hey, man.

929
01:18:55,713 --> 01:18:57,153
Pretty deep out here, huh?

930
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:03,620
What are you working on?

931
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:05,019
-Several things.

932
01:19:07,088 --> 01:19:09,218
- Hey, we made some
acorn pancakes.

933
01:19:09,223 --> 01:19:11,263
They're pretty tart, but they're
still really good.

934
01:19:11,258 --> 01:19:14,828
- Tell your ching-chong
girlfriend to keep her filthy

935
01:19:14,828 --> 01:19:17,328
fuckin' hands off my
leather jacket!

936
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,600
-What the fuck, man?

937
01:19:18,597 --> 01:19:20,857
-What?

938
01:19:20,865 --> 01:19:22,225
I've seen her eyeing it.

939
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:24,533
I've seen everybody
eyeing my jacket.

940
01:19:27,905 --> 01:19:29,295
-All right.

941
01:19:31,441 --> 01:19:33,211
-Hey.

942
01:19:33,209 --> 01:19:36,079
Can't you see that
I'm busy here?

943
01:19:36,078 --> 01:19:39,608
Can't you see that I have many
things to attend to, in my

944
01:19:39,614 --> 01:19:41,954
office, as a professor?

945
01:19:44,418 --> 01:19:46,418
Huh?

946
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,450
As a doctor of science?

947
01:19:52,892 --> 01:19:57,392
Some of us are in pursuit
of a higher truth.

948
01:21:27,147 --> 01:21:29,747
I travel only in the shadows.

949
01:21:29,749 --> 01:21:32,579
And I'm not likely to be seen...

950
01:21:32,585 --> 01:21:33,815
whoo!...

951
01:21:33,819 --> 01:21:35,219
pussyfooting around.

952
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:54,800
I don't
believe that they knew what

953
01:21:54,803 --> 01:21:59,713
they meant when they called
for a city on a hill.

954
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:04,337
Because I myself have
constructed a shimmering city

955
01:22:04,344 --> 01:22:06,044
upon a hill.

956
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:12,145
And atop my city, I sent
lightning bolts raining down

957
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:14,950
to destroy your satellites.

958
01:22:14,952 --> 01:22:18,852
Your satellite television
reception!

959
01:22:18,855 --> 01:22:24,285
I am unstoppable with my
hammer and my blade!

960
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:34,802
I have held in the
palm of my hand...

961
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:46,743
-18 towers.

962
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:49,675
18 towers!

963
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:59,650
Adorned with gems and sapphires
and rubies and opals

964
01:22:59,656 --> 01:23:06,656
and tigers eyes and diamonds,
cut flare-cut, heart-cut.

965
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:07,962
Ribbons!

966
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:11,603
Ribbons of velvet.

967
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:33,753
I've taken a
suspension bridge and put it

968
01:23:33,752 --> 01:23:37,722
across a vast chasm.

969
01:23:37,722 --> 01:23:39,692
I bring down trees.

970
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:43,790
I've seen right through the
inside of an ancient tree

971
01:23:43,793 --> 01:23:46,533
older than Christopher Columbus.

972
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:47,729
Older than Christopher!

973
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:53,626
I'm on top of the game.

974
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:55,995
I'm on top of this right now.

975
01:23:56,004 --> 01:23:57,404
I'm capable.

976
01:23:57,405 --> 01:24:02,865
I build things and move
things with my mind.

977
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:05,236
I don't need assistance.

978
01:24:05,245 --> 01:24:08,805
I'm a one-man marching band.

979
01:24:08,815 --> 01:24:12,745
I have many proclivities
and hobbies.

980
01:24:12,751 --> 01:24:16,121
I'm a collector of
rare artifacts.

981
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:20,491
If you have a sarcophagus,
I'll outbid you.

982
01:24:20,491 --> 01:24:26,691
I'm not likely to go down
without a fight.

983
01:24:26,696 --> 01:24:30,756
I'm an unstoppable
force of nature!

984
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:35,936
And I'm bearing down like an
eagle on a herd of sheep!

985
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:40,137
I'm a raptor in disguise!

986
01:26:19,572 --> 01:26:21,512
I used to have
this dream that I was standing

987
01:26:21,507 --> 01:26:24,977
on the bank of a river with all
my dearest friends in a

988
01:26:24,977 --> 01:26:27,307
kind of halfway morning light.

989
01:26:27,312 --> 01:26:29,582
We heard a sound in the sky,
and I had this feeling like

990
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:33,150
something big was coming,
something unexpected but

991
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:36,550
familiar at the same time,
like I'd always secretly

992
01:26:36,553 --> 01:26:39,123
anticipated this moment since
before the very time I was

993
01:26:39,122 --> 01:26:44,062
born, but I never actually
knew it until now.

994
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,660
A bright light shone,
and something large

995
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:48,092
fell from the sky.

996
01:26:48,096 --> 01:26:50,626
And then in an instant, a bunch
of other flares and

997
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:54,901
shapes destroyed the towering
cityscape across the water.

998
01:26:54,901 --> 01:26:57,801
In this instant, everything
changed, but we

999
01:26:57,803 --> 01:26:59,243
weren't scared at all.

1000
01:26:59,237 --> 01:27:01,597
It was like we were surfing
on this massive wave of

1001
01:27:01,606 --> 01:27:05,036
possibility and destruction
pushing us forward into a

1002
01:27:05,042 --> 01:27:09,142
beautiful crest of
a future untold.

1003
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:12,406
We knew not what lay before us,
but with arms outstretched

1004
01:27:12,415 --> 01:27:16,415
we pushed ahead into the
gaze of a purple dawn.
