1
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:44,046
I am Neptune, the ruler of the seas and oceans, rivers, lakes, streams and wells.

2
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:51,260
Circling my vast possessions, I decided to visit this paradise

3
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,985
on the Black Sea.

4
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:15,147
- Once upon a time in Russia there really was a carefree,youthful generation

5
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:19,001
that smiled at the summer, the sea and the sun - and chose Pepsi.

6
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,715
In those days children were expected to direct their aspirations towards

7
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:24,825
a  gleaming fireman's helmet or a doctor's white coat.

8
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:30,045
But, we lounged on the seashore, gazing endlessly at a cloudless blue horizon,

9
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:34,342
drank warm Pepsi-Cola  decanted into  glass  bottles  in  the city of  Novorossiisk,

10
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:38,492
and dreamed that some day the distant forbidden world

11
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:44,055
on the far side of the sea would be part of our own lives.

12
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:47,315
I was by default a member of Generation 'P'.

13
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,550
My name Babylen was composed from the title of

14
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,660
Yevtushenko's poem 'Baby Yar' and Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.

15
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:56,765
In a sense, I justified my name -

16
00:02:57,164 --> 00:02:58,406
I entered the Literary Institute,

17
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:02,195
wrote verses and kept eyes fixed on eternity,

18
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:05,185
pretending that nothing was  actually happening.

19
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:23,526
No sooner had  eternity  disappeared than I found myself in the present.

20
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:28,465
I had no contacts that could help me, so I took a job as a sales assistant in a trading kiosk.

21
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,305
The work was simple  enough,  but quite hard on  the nerves.

22
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:46,475
In the evening I handed over the takings to Hussein,

23
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:49,875
a Chechen whose eyes were  always oily from the opiates he took.

24
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:56,470
While I was working in the kiosk, I acquired two new qualities: The first was a cynicism

25
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:59,380
as boundless as  the view from the  Ostankino  television tower.

26
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:04,515
- Hey, any complaints? - No. - The lack of complaints is not an excuse.

27
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:11,627
the second quality was something quite remarkable and inexplicable.

28
00:04:11,629 --> 00:04:17,718
- One cigarette West, please. - I only had to  glance at a customer's hands to know

29
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:20,206
whether I could  short-change him and by exactly how  much.

30
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:28,897
Hand over the cash.

31
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,532
46 000.

32
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:53,766
Life is a solitary journey, beneath a scorching sun or in then blistering cold.

33
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:59,585
Often the road we  walk along leads to nowhere. and no  one knows where death  lies in  wait.

34
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,740
Remembering this, everything in  the world seems empty and meaningless.

35
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,321
And  then -  enlightenment.

36
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:09,486
Tuborg - be prepared for anything!

37
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:12,386
Yes.

38
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,145
A pack of Davidoff cigarettes, please.

39
00:05:14,145 --> 00:05:15,646
Normal or lights?

40
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,585
Normal.

41
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:22,982
Listen, do you have condoms, good one, those which are not fake.

42
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,281
Durex. British quality. "Jaguar" of condoms.

43
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:28,075
Good slogan. How much?

44
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,566
145.

45
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:32,580
Fuck all the best!

46
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,801
- Babe? Is that you?

47
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,707
- Markovin?

48
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:49,985
Take the keys, I'm leaving.

49
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,606
Babe, this is a very special time.

50
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:57,467
There's never  been a time like it and there  never will be again.

51
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,825
It's  a gold-rush,  just  like the Klondyke.

52
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:03,140
Yes, In another two years everything'll  be all sewn up,

53
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,705
but right  now there's a real chance to get in  on the ground floor  straight of  the street.

54
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:08,582
Do you understand?

55
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,555
Well, you got there.

56
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:14,886
The process has started. Get in.

57
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:29,046
The only place where you can find really big money is advertising.

58
00:06:30,327 --> 00:06:32,572
Most of  the  time it goes like this:

59
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,147
A guy borrows money  on  credit.

60
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:38,347
He uses the credit  to rent an  office  and  buy  a Jeep Cherokee

61
00:06:38,347 --> 00:06:41,070
and eight crates  of  Smimoff vodka.

62
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,670
When the Smimoff runs out,it turns out

63
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:52,535
the jeep's  wrecked, the office is  awash with puke and the loan is due for repayment.

64
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:57,067
If the bank the guy owes to is  one of the mafia banks,

65
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:01,547
then some time or other he gets killed.

66
00:07:01,549 --> 00:07:05,035
But I still don't see what all this has to do with advertising.

67
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:08,790
Now, the most important  part.

68
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:12,841
When  there's still about  half the Smimoff  left,

69
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:18,881
A highly specific  chemical reaction occurs inside  the head  of that guy.

70
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:24,006
He develops   this  totally  boundless  megalomania

71
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:28,310
and   orders   himself  an advertising  clip.

72
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:35,835
At this moment we pop out of the bushes.

73
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,585
There  are only  a few studios that make  the videos

74
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,113
and they're  desperate for writers with nous.

75
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:48,766
OK, I'll call you back. Oh, Babylen Tatarsky.

76
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,606
- Hi. Meet Lena.

77
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:55,025
Tatarsky is your surname or nickname? - Surname.

78
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:59,297
- This is Sergey. Let's get straight to business.

79
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:03,966
- Babylen, the story is:

80
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:09,075
The mark's about fifty. Used  to work as  a teacher of physics.

81
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:11,350
Just when things started coming  apart

82
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,755
he set up a co-operative baking  bird's  milk' cakes.

83
00:08:15,757 --> 00:08:19,638
and in two  years made so much money

84
00:08:19,638 --> 00:08:22,545
that now he rents a half of Babaevsky confectionery plant.

85
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:26,825
Recently he took out a loan. ... A very big loan.

86
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:30,705
The day before yesterday he  went on the booze.

87
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:32,600
Where do you get that kind of information?

88
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,265
His secretary is a friend of mine.

89
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:35,276
Yeah?

90
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,955
So anyway, we have to get to him with the scenario  now,

91
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:40,875
before he  has time to sober up. When  he  sobers up, he gets greedy.

92
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:44,587
- Oh, hi.

93
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:52,446
- Club jacket ... Put it on.

94
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,126
You have to  hang  this thing on your belt.

95
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:59,806
 You're meeting the client at one, and at twenty past one I'll give you a call on the pager.

96
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,190
When  it beeps,

97
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,820
take  it off your belt and look at  it  like it's  something important. Got it?

98
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,870
All the  time the client's talking,  keep  making  notes in  the notebook.

99
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:17,387
Rolex... When you're talking  with the client,flash it around a bit, you know.

100
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:21,881
Careful, you'll chip off the gold plate.

101
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:40,825
The plant is wonderful. But can we get straight to business.

102
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:44,270
What corporate positions you want to advertise?

103
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:51,617
Well, I don't know ... We bought trays with fluoride coating ...

104
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,915
Is it from Video International?

105
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:59,425
- No, those  blockheads don't bother me any more, thank  God.

106
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:02,401
It's Slava Zaitsev. It's all off for today.

107
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,321
Surely he doesn't think we're that desperate for his business ...

108
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:06,606
Let's talk about that later.

109
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,870
Excuse me.

110
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:21,886
Aren't  you  afraid  that it  could  all just come  to  a  full stop?

111
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:29,240
You know what kind  of times these are. What if  everything suddenly collapses?'

112
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,161
I'm afraid. Who isn't?

113
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:43,617
Have you totally lost your marbles,  or what? Nobody asks questions like that.

114
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:47,001
it's all right. Now I know what he wants.

115
00:10:56,905 --> 00:11:02,595
One  generation passeth  away  and another generation cometh, but  the Earth abideth for ever.

116
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:11,670
MEDIIS TEMPUSTATIBUS PLACIDUS. Calm in  the  midst  of storms Lefortovo confectionery combine.

117
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,545
And  so  I became a copywriter.

118
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:18,985
I  didn't  bother  to  explain myself  to any of my old bosses. I hope that Hussein received the keys of the kiosk.

119
00:11:18,985 --> 00:11:21,030
there were rumours that the Chechens  demanded  serious compensation

120
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,155
when  anyone  left  one  of their businesses.

121
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:27,166
Hello. Yes, Andrei Ivanovich, i'm working. Creative as always.

122
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:32,185
There's always someone who cares, put your trust in our shares.

123
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:40,422
He didn't earn a really  large amount of money, but even so it was more than  he'd made in the retail trade.

124
00:11:40,424 --> 00:11:46,166
That night at the Vernadsky Prospekt director of Lefortovo confectionery combine Mr. Zhilin was killed.

125
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,425
His Jeep Grand Cherokee was attacked in a drive-by shooting.

126
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:53,430
The investigation suggests that the murder of Mr. Zhilin related to his professional activities.

127
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,625
Criminal proceedings have begun.

128
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:03,980
Dear audience, we've got breaking-news from the besieged Parliament building.

129
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,046
As it became known, the Congress of People's Deputies

130
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:10,305
dismissed the Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin.

131
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:20,366
Hi, girls! Hi, guys!

132
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:25,161
At the 13th page article with my photo.

133
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,420
Alexander Blo.

134
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,937
The Soviet mentality ... Yes, it must be squeezed out as a pimple, drop by drop.

135
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:37,222
What is a "Soviet mentality", in the old days I had possessed it myself, but I'd lost it  completely

136
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:40,275
while working for  a  few years as a  taxi-driver in New York.

137
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:44,745
As we say in the advertising business, the different "cultural references".

138
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,867
Bingo.

139
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:49,790
I didn't really understand completely what this Soviet mentality was.

140
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,761
But from the perspective of my new employer, Dmitry Pugin,

141
00:12:52,761 --> 00:12:55,060
 I wasn't supposed  to  understand anything anyway.

142
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,446
I was merely required  to possess this  mentality.

143
00:12:56,446 --> 00:13:01,235
Look, the country hardly produces anything at all,

144
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:04,766
but people  have to  have something to eat and wear.

145
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:09,660
So, soon goods will start pouring in here  from the West.

146
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,417
and massive amounts of advertising will come flooding in with them.

147
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,540
But it won't be possible

148
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,230
simply to translate this advertising  from English into Russian,

149
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,726
Because of different... Cultural references ...

150
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:28,025
You and I get straight on the job well in  advance. We prepare outline concepts

151
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,046
for all the serious brand-names.

152
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:31,942
Then, just  as soon as the right moment comes,

153
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:35,145
we turn up at their offices with a folder under our arms and  do  business.

154
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:42,241
For  a test-piece, try to develop an outline concept for Sprite they willing to penetrate the Russian market.

155
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:55,961
Given the numerous appeals to me from leaders of subdivisions of the Russian Federation,

156
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,638
groups of deputies, members of the Constitutional Council,

157
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:00,825
Russian citizens,

158
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,881
I have undertaken the following:

159
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,982
It  is  a well-known fact that in  the countries  of Eastern Europe Coca-Cola is more  of an ideological fetish

160
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,561
than a refreshing soft drink.

161
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:16,001
If, for instance, Hershi drinks are positioned as possessing the'taste  of  victory',

162
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,270
then  Coca-Cola possesses  the 'taste of  freedom'

163
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,132
In a few words.

164
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:20,070
OK.

165
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,995
Let  us take a classic positioning  slogan:  'Sprite - the Uncola'.

166
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:28,486
For  the  Russian consumer,  therefore,  the  term  'Uncola' has extensive

167
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:31,481
anti-democratic and  anti-liberal  connotations,

168
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:35,105
which  makes  it highly attractive in conditions of military dictatorship.

169
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:39,035
Translated into  Russian 'Uncola'would  become 'Nye-Cola'.

170
00:14:39,035 --> 00:14:44,190
The sound of the  word (similar to the  old Russian name 'Nikola')  and the  associations aroused by it

171
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,921
offer a perfect fit  with the aesthetic required by the likely future scenario.

172
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,825
A possible version of the slogan:

173
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:54,435
SPRITE. THE NYE-COLA FOR NIKOLA

174
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,121
A possible text for an advertising clip:

175
00:14:58,121 --> 00:15:05,265
Deep in the spring-time forest I drank my birch-bright Sprite.

176
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:12,470
"The Uncola" is Seven-Up's slogan, not Sprite's.

177
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,742
But that's OK. We can use  it.

178
00:15:20,742 --> 00:15:22,870
So you  can  consider you've passed  the test.

179
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,865
Now try some other brand.

180
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,006
Which one?

181
00:15:31,065 --> 00:15:34,710
It is quite clear that the first thing that has to be taken into consideration

182
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,081
 in the development of advertising concept for

183
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:41,441
cigarettes Parliament, is...

184
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:47,307
Exactly  what  was  the  first  thing   that  had  to   be  taken  into consideration   was   entirely  unclear.

185
00:16:08,247 --> 00:16:09,390
Parliament - Not "Java".

186
00:16:16,945 --> 00:16:20,742
Tihamat. I once found this folder in the waste paper,

187
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:23,478
we used to be sent to collect after classes in school.

188
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:28,102
I  was  sensitive  about  my  name,  and  whenever possible  I introduced myself as Vova.

189
00:16:28,102 --> 00:16:32,092
It appeared to be that the birth name

190
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:35,926
draw up with me when I had completely forgotten about the role

191
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,780
which, as I was telling friends,

192
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,547
secret doctrine of Babylon should have played in my life.

193
00:16:41,547 --> 00:16:45,806
I was particularly inspired by the legend of the Great Lottery.

194
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:49,052
A more precise translation would  be  'The Game without a Name'

195
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:53,385
According to tradition the path to wealth  and to supreme  wisdom

196
00:16:53,385 --> 00:16:57,705
was via sexual union with a  golden idol  of  the goddess Ishtar.

197
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:00,860
Any  inhabitant of Babylon  could become the  goddess's husband.

198
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,355
To achieve this he had to drink

199
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,766
ritual drink prepared from the heavenly fly-agarics,

200
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:09,217
then ascend the ziggurat and guess Three Riddles of the goddess.

201
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:12,675
Riddles of  Ishtar were  three symbolic objects

202
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:16,275
that were handed to a Babylonian who wished to become a Chaldean.

203
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:19,881
He had to interpret the significance of these items.

204
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,441
Anybody who got even one of  the  riddles  wrong

205
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,041
was  pushed  over  the edge  of the ziggurat  to  certain death by the soldiers of the  guard.

206
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:29,086
The man who answered all three  riddles correctly

207
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,766
would ascend to the summit and meet the  goddess,

208
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:34,337
following  which he became her ritual earthly husband.

209
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,705
Gireiev!

210
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:45,966
Tatarsky?

211
00:17:45,966 --> 00:17:48,206
Listen, you've changed so much! How are you?

212
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:52,438
I am in perfect harmony. How are you? Are you in a hurry?

213
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:56,430
I'm going through a difficult period right now.

214
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,097
Communicating mostly with businessmen and advertisers.

215
00:18:00,097 --> 00:18:02,540
The stress is just  incredible.

216
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,710
A couple of  those businessmen  came to see me

217
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,865
last winter.

218
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:10,630
Wanted to expand their  consciousness.

219
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,665
Afterwards they ran  off barefoot across the snow.

220
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,161
Come with me, you will see what I mean.

221
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:26,977
In his crazy gear Gireiev seemed like the final fragment of some lost universe -

222
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:31,115
not  the  Soviet  universe,  because  that  didn't  contain  any wandering Tibetan astrologers,

223
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:35,467
but  some other  world  that  had existed in parallel with the Soviet one,

224
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:38,985
even in  contradiction of it, and had perished together with  it.

225
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,105
- What's that? - Fly-agarics.

226
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:07,966
Are you going to drink that?

227
00:19:07,966 --> 00:19:10,526
Don't worry, there aren't any brown ones.

228
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,115
In ancient Babylon, people also prepared this potion,

229
00:19:23,115 --> 00:19:27,806
besides fly-agarics it included 'the urine  of a  red donkey'

230
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,921
That's right. To mitigate it.

231
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:37,875
- What do I do now? - Whatever you like.

232
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,406
- Is it OK to talk? - Try it.

233
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:43,545
Have you heard what happened to Lyosha Chikunov?

234
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:48,340
You know, he drank several bottles of Finlandia vodka

235
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,700
and  then frozen to death one starry  January  night in the toy house on a children's playground.

236
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,846
Gone to Valhalla, Scandinavian warriors paradise.

237
00:20:19,206 --> 00:20:20,915
Is there any more?

238
00:20:30,006 --> 00:20:31,966
The taste of the dried fly-agarics reminds

239
00:20:31,966 --> 00:20:34,955
of  potato  chips, except  that  it is nicer.

240
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,060
What if we start selling them in packets  like  potato  chips?

241
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,915
What's that?

242
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,145
It is Hum. That's how I travel.

243
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:51,915
Where to?

244
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:56,732
Where?... It is hard to explain.

245
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:03,710
Ohm-m-m-m ...

246
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:11,457
When you don't think, lots of things become clear.

247
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,886
Аdvertising  concept  for fly-agarics.

248
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:34,022
The supreme form of self-realisation for  fly-agarics is an atomic explosion -

249
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:40,500
something like the glowing non-material  body

250
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,678
that certain advanced mystics acquire.

251
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,081
Human beings  were simply a subsidiary form of life

252
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:48,686
that the fly-agarics exploited in order  to  achieve their supreme  goal.

253
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:54,673
This is very weird.

254
00:21:57,057 --> 00:22:00,985
Chikunov's dead, and we're alive. Only I suspect that

255
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:05,580
every time we lie down and sleep, we die just the same way.

256
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,635
Death  just  means  the replacement  of the  usual morning wakening

257
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:13,505
with  something else,

258
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:17,222
something  quite impossible  even  to think about.

259
00:22:17,222 --> 00:22:21,350
Because  our mind and our world

260
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,566
are the same thing.

261
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:26,001
That means there is no death.

262
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:29,398
Because the threads disappear, but the sphere remains!

263
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:30,780
Why?

264
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,230
Yes, because spheads reppear, but threre dismains!

265
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:39,481
What?

266
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,067
Li'd dratinker  wike  of wit!

267
00:22:50,812 --> 00:22:54,235
Confusion  of tongues ​​called the Tower of Babel!

268
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:57,046
They probably drank that mushroom tea

269
00:22:57,046 --> 00:22:59,865
and the words began to break apart in their mouths, just like mine.

270
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,945
Stan  gou thecation  totet  yell  he mow?

271
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:26,105
There  trun rewains?

272
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:29,542
Don't be a fool! Don't act like a fool, bitch!

273
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,665
- Trure thrun wareins? - Don't be daft!

274
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:40,100
What if I met Hussein now, I wonder if he'd be scared?

275
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,307
What did you want?

276
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:48,220
I just need a second. I  wanted to  ask  you,

277
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,860
as  a  representative  of  the  target  group:

278
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,595
what associations does  the word "parliament" have for  you?

279
00:23:56,241 --> 00:24:00,801
There is a poem called "The Parliament of Birds".

280
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,886
It's about how thirty birds flew off in search of the bird that is called Semurg -

281
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,926
the king of all birds and a great master.

282
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:12,166
How did it all end?

283
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,705
When  they  had endured thirty trials,

284
00:24:14,705 --> 00:24:19,617
they  learned that the word "Semurg" means "thirty birds".

285
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,577
But what is the Tower of Babel?

286
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:30,881
The creation of the pillar,

287
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:34,513
and not the construction, namely the creation.

288
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:41,225
When there is a confusion  of tongues, then the Tower of Babel starts to rise.

289
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:45,393
Or maybe  it's just that the  entrance to the  ziggurat opens up.

290
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:49,300
Yes,  of course. There's the entrance right there.

291
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,121
Nothing's quite as simple as it seems.

292
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:57,510
Still, it must be a multi-storey carpark.

293
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:05,790
Onwards to hanging gardens!

294
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:57,100
Three Riddles of  Ishtar. It all fits.

295
00:27:17,545 --> 00:27:20,481
The  poster  consists of a photograph  of  the  embankment of the river Moscow.

296
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:24,572
In the foreground - the bridge on which the  historic  tanks  stood in October '93.

297
00:27:24,572 --> 00:27:29,260
On the site of the Parliament building we see a huge pack of Parliament.

298
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,606
Palms are growing profusely all around it.

299
00:27:32,606 --> 00:27:33,905
Slogan:

300
00:27:33,905 --> 00:27:41,475
Sweet and dear Is the smoke of our Motherland. Parliament.

301
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:47,745
Brilliant, Tatarsky! You hit  the bull's-eye!

302
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:51,841
Pack of Parliament already costs the same as a pack of Marlboro.

303
00:27:51,841 --> 00:27:55,937
And after these events, I think it will cost twice as much.

304
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:57,670
Congratulations.

305
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:04,881
And so there  exist  two  methods for advertising  shares, but, in our opinion,

306
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:08,910
before the campaign begins it would make good  sense to think  about changing the  name of the firm.

307
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:12,385
"TAMPAKO" - a drink made from tampons?

308
00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:16,515
Agents of Rosgosstrakh fly over the city and help people in need -

309
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:18,220
guardian angels!

310
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,721
Start the Diesel-themed couplets (chastushka):

311
00:28:19,721 --> 00:28:22,510
(verse) Ivan Ilyich and I worked on a diesel train,

312
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,315
I'm asshole, and he is asshole, So, our train was stolen.

313
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:27,921
That's it - the youth is ours!

314
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:30,006
Here is the script of advertising clip.

315
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:32,385
A young man with a  serious expression  on his face

316
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,105
sits on a bench in the square. Change of  camera angle:

317
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:39,225
A well-dressed man with a depraved face emerges from the mansion

318
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:41,635
and looks  around in a frightened manner, then he runs to the car.

319
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:45,246
The young man drops 2 Tic Tacs in the palm of his hand

320
00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:48,870
throws them in his mouth and closes his eyes with pleasure.

321
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,950
Voice-over:

322
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,390
Bro preferred coolness, but fried all the others.

323
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,580
Tic Tac Menthol. The real taste explosion!

324
00:29:09,425 --> 00:29:11,126
- Hello? - Good morning.

325
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,865
This is  Vladimir  Khanin  from  the "Privy  Counsellor" agency.

326
00:29:14,865 --> 00:29:18,041
I  was  left your number by Dima Pugin.

327
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:21,521
Could we maybe get together some time today? Right away would be best.

328
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:23,595
What's happened?

329
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,235
Dima's  no  longer with us.

330
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,195
I know you worked with  him,

331
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:32,726
and he worked with me. So indirectly we're acquainted.

332
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,035
But how did it happen?

333
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:37,521
The robbery had obviously  been an  inside  job,

334
00:29:37,521 --> 00:29:39,910
the thief must  have  known

335
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:42,100
that Pugin had worked as a taxi-driver in New York.

336
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,620
46th and Broadway.

337
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:48,585
That  was all he had managed to tell the police and the doctors.

338
00:29:48,585 --> 00:29:51,937
Seven bullet wounds had  been found in  his body. Seven.

339
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:54,100
they'd fired straight through the back of his  seat.

340
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,950
One for the departed.

341
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,593
And now let's get to grips  with your  latest works

342
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:09,580
if  you have  no objection.

343
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,665
I presume you've understood that Dima was bringing them to me?

344
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:23,465
As  far as Parliament is concerned  I must admit,  it's good.

345
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:29,070
Yes, but... here I see you've got problems. Serious problems.

346
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,510
"Tampako". They took serious offense  at  one  of  your pieces of advice.

347
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,046
But the name Tampako really is appalling.'

348
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:39,633
You know that this business of ours is a lottery.

349
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:43,230
Just recently you haven't been doing too well in that lottery.

350
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,180
And I know why.

351
00:30:52,046 --> 00:30:52,446
Why?

352
00:30:56,075 --> 00:31:01,275
You don't believe in what you do. Your heart  isn't  in it.

353
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:04,270
No, it isn't. Of course it isn't. What do you expect?

354
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,406
Do you want me to give my heart  to Tampako?

355
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:10,721
here's not a single whore  on  Pushkin  Square would do that.

356
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:12,435
OK,  just drop  the pose.

357
00:31:12,435 --> 00:31:16,955
No, don't  get me wrong. We're all  in the same frame nowadays, right?

358
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:20,710
So  why  do I say  not a  single whore  would  do it? Not because  I'm disgusted.

359
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,740
It's just that a whore  always collects her money every  time -

360
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,782
whether she pleased the client  or not.

361
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,022
but I have  to ...

362
00:31:28,115 --> 00:31:28,726
You know  what I mean.

363
00:31:28,726 --> 00:31:32,918
There's no way any whore would work on those terms.

364
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:35,125
A  whore might not, but we will,

365
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:39,430
if we  want to survive in this business.

366
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,547
And we'll go even further than that.

367
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:45,585
Will you work for me full-time?

368
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:50,492
- What as? - A creative.

369
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,110
Is that a writer? Translated into ordinary Russian?

370
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:58,875
We don't need any fucking writers here.

371
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:02,201
A creative, Babelen, a creative.

372
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:06,185
Meet - Babylen Tatar! Please love and favor.

373
00:32:06,185 --> 00:32:09,190
"Every brand has its bend". What's this?

374
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,206
Bend.  That's the way  we  translate the  expression  "brand essence".

375
00:32:13,206 --> 00:32:15,086
Brand essence is ...

376
00:32:15,086 --> 00:32:18,022
the concentrated expression of  a comprehensive image policy.

377
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:20,273
The  Marlboro brand essence is...

378
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:24,540
Country of fucking real cowboys and oppressed indigenous peoples.

379
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,158
Do not be afraid. This is Malyuta. Malyuta, say "Hi".

380
00:32:27,158 --> 00:32:29,326
Well done, good boy.

381
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,337
Sergeant  in  our platoon was called Harley.

382
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:40,545
A real bull of a man.

383
00:32:40,545 --> 00:32:44,417
But he took to the drink.

384
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,678
- Why'd he do that? - You know.

385
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:48,646
No one gives a Russian a chance these days.

386
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,881
Just how long can  the  Davidsons  keep riding the  Harleys?

387
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,915
Russia, awake!

388
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,441
This is parody, Malyuta?

389
00:33:19,441 --> 00:33:25,670
You know, Tatarsky, I have seen your works.

390
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,761
Your concept for Sprite is good,

391
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:33,460
and all the other works are nothing special.

392
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:38,667
Stop playing to Atlantic values.

393
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:41,393
We are Eurasians!

394
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:46,033
A small Vietnamese village.

395
00:33:46,033 --> 00:33:49,555
We see the last American prisoners of war.

396
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:54,926
On the table in front of them  there are Nike runners

397
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:57,041
in various stages of completion.

398
00:33:57,041 --> 00:34:00,635
At first prisoners murmur quietly, then they start banging on the tables with the half-glued runners.

399
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:04,995
"We demand a meeting with the American consul!! Consul!"

400
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:10,406
Suddenly a burst of automatic rounds is fired,

401
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:16,566
The tall, handsome Vietnamese appears in the doorway, with a smoking automatic in his hands.

402
00:34:16,566 --> 00:34:20,185
And says in perfect English:

403
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:26,635
"Jasta do ita! Nike. Good wins!"

404
00:34:27,937 --> 00:34:28,910
Bravo!

405
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,897
And... what is that?

406
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:35,921
And you think the advertisers would like it?

407
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:40,118
we are the one who explains to the customers what they  like and  what they don't.

408
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:45,260
Tell me why does any advertiser give us an ad?

409
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,180
Well ... To sell product.

410
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,806
That's in America - to sell product.

411
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:57,166
Then so he can feel like a big-shot.

412
00:34:57,166 --> 00:35:00,660
Yes, but that was three years ago. Things are different  now.

413
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,980
Nowadays  the client wants to show the  big guys

414
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,150
who keep a careful  eye

415
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,905
on what's  happening  on screen and in real  life

416
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,806
that he can take a million dollars

417
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:12,060
and simply throw it in the trash.

418
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,155
And the worse his advert  is, the better.

419
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,350
- Complicated. - Sure it is!

420
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,926
There's more to it than reading your Al Rice.

421
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:47,825
Hello...

422
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,025
What sizes do  you have?

423
00:35:57,025 --> 00:36:01,366
There's only one left. Just your size. 3000 rubles.

424
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:02,435
I take it.

425
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:09,867
What are those things up there?

426
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:13,212
That's a ouija board.

427
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:18,017
You put the paper in through here. In  this slot here  you  put  a pen.

428
00:36:18,017 --> 00:36:22,195
You put your  hands on it like  this, see?

429
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:27,465
Then  you enter into contact  with the spirit and just let your hands move however they want.

430
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,905
The pen will write out the text that's received.

431
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:36,435
Listen, please  don't be angry,

432
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:38,822
I really want to know - what spirit am I supposed to contact?

433
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,326
I'll tell you if you're buying.

434
00:36:40,326 --> 00:36:43,635
I take it. How much? - 17 000.

435
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,390
Oh, 17 000 ...

436
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:50,401
What kind of job are you in? What do you do?

437
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,566
Advertising.

438
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,590
Yeah. It would be best for you to avoid any contacts.

439
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,406
That approach will be  less offensive to the spirits.

440
00:37:07,406 --> 00:37:08,470
Interesting...

441
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,486
But how will the spirits guess that I'm  in  advertising?

442
00:37:12,486 --> 00:37:13,921
Is it written on my forehead or something?

443
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:18,046
No. It's written in the adverts that came out of your forehead.

444
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:48,665
I  summon  the  spirit  of  Che Guevara.

445
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,526
I'd like to know ... let's say,

446
00:37:55,126 --> 00:37:59,385
something new about advertising, in order to understand more than anybody else.

447
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,307
Comrade, the future depends on you!

448
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:09,755
From the standpoint of bourgeois thought,

449
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:13,446
every man is a cell of an organism, which is called 	Economy.

450
00:38:13,446 --> 00:38:17,761
But we call it simply ORANUS. Which translates into  Russian as "moutharse".

451
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:19,300
Each of these cells,

452
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,265
that is, each individual, when regarded as an economic entity -

453
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:25,601
possesses a kind of social membrane

454
00:38:25,601 --> 00:38:28,246
that allows money to pass into and out of the cell.

455
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:31,270
This process is controlled by the nervous system of Oranus -

456
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,860
TV and mass media.

457
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,675
Person's identity is gradually displaced

458
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:40,150
and individual becomes a programme watching another television programme.

459
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,825
There are three types of pulses

460
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:45,387
transmitted by Oranus  throughout its virtual organism:

461
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:48,417
oral, anal and displacing wow-impulses.

462
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:51,305
from the commercial ejaculation 'wow!

463
00:38:51,305 --> 00:38:55,470
Homo homini lupus est,  as one inspired Latin saying has it.

464
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:58,195
But man has long ceased being a wolf to man.

465
00:38:58,195 --> 00:39:01,140
Man is not  even an image-maker,

466
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,310
not the dealer, not a killer and not an exclusive distributor to man.

467
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,166
as  some modern sociologists assume.

468
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,860
It is all far more terrifying and much simpler than that.

469
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,345


Man is wow to man.

470
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:14,220
Or if not to man, but to  precisely  another such wow.

471
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,001
So, projected on to the modem  system of cultural  coordinates

472
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:20,750
the  Latin saying becomes:

473
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,827
Wow Wow Wow!

474
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:48,522
One Smirnoff vodka, please.

475
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:51,265
You've got the shakes bad. Snorting?

476
00:39:52,278 --> 00:39:54,265
A bit. Just now and again.

477
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:55,886
It's disgusting,

478
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:59,705
the  mucous membrane of the nose - it's as good as the  exposed surface of the  brain.

479
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:03,425
And where that powder came from and  who's been  sticking  his body parts in it?

480
00:40:03,425 --> 00:40:08,550
Did you ever  think about that? Life should be lived cleanly.

481
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,475
Oh, yes? And how's that done?

482
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,057
Nothing but LSD.

483
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:16,755
Only via the empty gut and always with a prayer.

484
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,420
I'll be damned.Look at all those different ones.

485
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:29,945
- And you mean they all have different effects? - Yeah.

486
00:40:29,945 --> 00:40:31,046
But why?

487
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:33,601
Well, the most important thing  is the  drawing.

488
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:36,262
There's  no getting away  from the fact

489
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:39,633
that  you're swallowing Mel  Gibson or red carnation,  get  it?

490
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:41,675
These three here  all the same, what  are they?

491
00:40:41,675 --> 00:40:44,580
Who's this drawn on them? With the  beard and the  cap?

492
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,470
Who it  is that's drawn on them I don't know.  But it's really wild stuff.

493
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:51,286
The difference is  the acid's mixed with a metabolic.

494
00:40:51,286 --> 00:40:54,025
And the dose in  them is enough for a whole platoon  of soldiers.

495
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:56,075
- How much? - 150.

496
00:40:56,075 --> 00:40:57,686
All I've got left is a 150.

497
00:40:58,505 --> 00:41:00,566
Well, OK.

498
00:42:58,595 --> 00:43:01,540
Do you want to die? Sirruf has arrived.

499
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,561
- What d'you mean? - Just what  I say.

500
00:43:03,561 --> 00:43:06,521
Do  you at  least realise that  was a pass  for five people?

501
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:10,497
And you're here alone. Or are there really five of you?

502
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:19,115
Please, don't do that to me again.

503
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:19,966
I've  made  a mistake.

504
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,315
I  realise  it's not right to  look  at  the Tower of Babel.

505
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:23,032
But I didn't...

506
00:43:23,032 --> 00:43:27,515
You can't see the Tower  of Babel, you can only ascend it

507
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:29,940
I tell you that as its guardian.

508
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,753
And what you saw  was a tofet.

509
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:34,441
What's a tofet?

510
00:43:34,441 --> 00:43:37,020
It's a place of sacrificial cremation.

511
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,545
I don't understand.

512
00:43:39,545 --> 00:43:43,142
You can regard the tofet as an ordinary TV.

513
00:43:44,585 --> 00:43:47,465
- Do you mean I was inside a television? - In  a certain sense.

514
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:51,435
You saw the  technological space  in  which  your world is being consumed by fire.

515
00:43:51,435 --> 00:43:54,513
The fire in which you burn has to be maintained.

516
00:43:54,513 --> 00:43:57,566
And you are one of the service personnel.

517
00:43:57,566 --> 00:43:59,646
Service personnel?

518
00:43:59,646 --> 00:44:01,275
You  are a copywriter, aren't you?

519
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,425
That means you are one of those

520
00:44:03,425 --> 00:44:06,475
who force people to gaze into the consuming fire.

521
00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:10,420
You must admit that, it's better to warm yourself by the fire,

522
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,555
than to burn in it.

523
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:16,590
Listen, I'm in trouble.  I've done too much acid.

524
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,617
Gireiev: In cases  like that  I recite a mantra.

525
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:24,035
Om melafefon bva kha sha.

526
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:28,830
- On-em-em-e-l. - What does it mean?

527
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,881
That's not important. Have you got any vodka?

528
00:44:30,881 --> 00:44:37,161
Om melafefon bva ha sha, jm melafefon...

529
00:44:37,161 --> 00:44:40,892
bva kha sha.

530
00:44:48,515 --> 00:44:50,180
Om melafefon ...

531
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:56,641
Om melafefon bva kha sha.

532
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,358
Om melafefon bva kha sha.

533
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,585
Om melafefon bva kha sha.

534
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:14,835
Oh  no,  Gireiev,  this mantra of yours  isn't  doing the business.

535
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,625
I  have sinned  greatly against Thee, O Lord.

536
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,638
I live  a bad  life,  a wrong one.

537
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,585
But in my soul there are no abominable desires, cross my heart.

538
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:36,966
I'll  never eat any  of that junk again. I. .. I ...

539
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:44,721
I only want to be happy,  and I just can't manage it.

540
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:50,726
Perhaps it's what I deserve.

541
00:45:55,755 --> 00:45:59,180
I can't do anything else except write bad  slogans.

542
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:12,267
But for Thee, oh Lord, I'll write a good  one - honest I will.

543
00:46:15,225 --> 00:46:17,886
They do position Thee quite wrongly.

544
00:46:17,886 --> 00:46:20,745
They  haven't got a clue.

545
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:25,246
Take that  latest clip, where they're collecting  money for  that church.

546
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:26,921
There's this old woman  standing there with a box,

547
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:30,081
and first someone driving an old jalopy puts in  a rouble

548
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:33,372
and  then someone driving a Mercedes  drops in a  hundred bucks. The idea's clear enough,

549
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:35,473
but in terms  of positioning it's way off beam.

550
00:46:36,641 --> 00:46:41,955
The guy in the Mercedes wouldn't wait in the queue of jalopies. A blind horse could see it.

551
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:47,620
And the target group we need is all those guys in their Mercedes.

552
00:46:49,646 --> 00:46:50,470
Theme for a clip:

553
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:54,915
Long white limousine against the background including the Cathedral of Christ the Savior.

554
00:46:54,915 --> 00:46:58,086
The back door opened, the light hits out of it.

555
00:46:58,086 --> 00:47:02,801
Out of light appears sandal, which is slightly touches asphalt

556
00:47:02,801 --> 00:47:05,566
and the hand lying on the door handle.

557
00:47:06,275 --> 00:47:10,481
we do not see the face. Only light, arm and leg.

558
00:47:11,355 --> 00:47:17,372
Slogan: "Respectable Lord for respectable gentlemen."

559
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,742
Dost Thou like it. Lord?

560
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:43,921
Hello?

561
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:46,675
- Babe? How're you doing? - So-so.

562
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:49,435
- Did you get by OK? - More or less.

563
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:53,161
Why don't you just tell me what that mantra was you gave me?

564
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:57,006
It's not a mantra. It's a sentence in Hebrew from a textbook.

565
00:47:57,006 --> 00:47:59,260
It means "Please give me another cucumber".

566
00:48:00,526 --> 00:48:04,246
A natural  born  mantra.. And if you put "hum" at the end as well...

567
00:48:07,185 --> 00:48:10,081
OK, Cheers.

568
00:48:11,627 --> 00:48:13,801
I'm going out for some beer.

569
00:48:14,812 --> 00:48:16,902
Citizens come closer to trucks!

570
00:48:16,902 --> 00:48:19,158
Put your flags and banners in the truck!

571
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:21,721
Now, everybody take guns! Young man, take the gun!

572
00:48:21,721 --> 00:48:25,470
Let's get rid of the Democratic bastard!

573
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:30,406
Bring Yeltsin's gang to justice! Bring Yeltsin's gang to justice!

574
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:42,041
Come on.

575
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,035
And why couldn't  you  just explain what was going on?

576
00:48:52,035 --> 00:48:54,022
Why'd you just drop off the keys?

577
00:48:54,022 --> 00:48:55,321
I had a heavy drinking session.

578
00:48:58,497 --> 00:49:00,097
What are you up to nowadays?

579
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:04,102
- Working. - Where would that be?

580
00:49:07,622 --> 00:49:10,985
- Who's that? - Just a friend of mine.

581
00:49:11,627 --> 00:49:14,041
He's got nothing to do...

582
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:22,241
Hello.

583
00:49:22,241 --> 00:49:23,481
who  am I talking to?

584
00:49:24,705 --> 00:49:30,342
Khanin? How do  you  do, Khanin.

585
00:49:30,665 --> 00:49:32,081
Who am I?

586
00:49:32,081 --> 00:49:36,742
My name is Hussein, I'm calling from the Caucasian Friendly Society.

587
00:49:57,057 --> 00:49:59,340
So  that's where  you  got to,  you  bitch!

588
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,355
Wanted to hide, did you? Keeping out of sight, were you, you fucking merchant?

589
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:08,742
Hey now, don't get  carried  away. He's a merchant, OK, but he's my merchant.

590
00:50:08,742 --> 00:50:13,070
What? Yours? He was my merchant when you were still herding cows in the mountains.

591
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:17,635
I didn't herd cows in the  mountains, I herded bulls.

592
00:50:17,635 --> 00:50:22,220
And bulls like  you  don't bother me any more than they did. I'll soon set a ring through your nose, better believe it.

593
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,550
What did  you  say? What ring?

594
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,566
This one.

595
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:36,995
All right. We'll meet tomorrow to discuss it. Ten o'clock in the evening.

596
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:41,380
I take the young guy. He's one of mine. Come on.

597
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:48,180
Let me introduce  you. Babe Tatarsky, one of  our best specialists.

598
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,566
And this is Wee Vova, almost your namesake.

599
00:50:51,566 --> 00:50:53,926
Also known as the Nietzschean.

600
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,273
Ah,  that's all a  load of crap. That was a long time ago.

601
00:50:56,273 --> 00:50:58,470
He's our protection. You've got a commission from him to develop a concept.

602
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:02,110
Listen carefully to what he has to say.

603
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,020
Tell me. When you're abroad, d'you feel humiliated?

604
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,206
I've never been abroad.

605
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:14,270
And good for you. Cause if you do go you will.

606
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:20,510
I  tell you straight - over there they don't reckon we're  people at all.

607
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:24,046
They think we're all  shit  and animals.

608
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:26,310
But why do they treat us like that? What  d'you think?

609
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,310
Because we watch their films,

610
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:32,326
ride  their wheels,  even  eat their fodder.

611
00:51:32,326 --> 00:51:35,110
And we  don't produce  nothing, 'cept for mazuma...

612
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:39,121
Which is still only their dollars, whichever way  you look at it.

613
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:42,990
I ain't no economist, but  I  got  a  gut  feeling

614
00:51:44,286 --> 00:51:48,841
something's  rotten  here,  somehow something somewhere don't add up.

615
00:51:50,595 --> 00:51:53,515
It's  just that we've lost  our roots for the time being 'cause of all this crap that's going down.

616
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:55,830
But  what  we are, is Russia!

617
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,275
Makes you frightened to think of it! A great country!

618
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:01,806
Do you agree with me?

619
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,910
Well...

620
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:08,195
You  tell him what the job  is. He's my senior creative.

621
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:13,227
A minute of his time costs more than the two of us earn in a week.

622
00:52:13,227 --> 00:52:16,235
OK, listen up and  I'll lay  it out  for you just like counting on my fingers.

623
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,715
Our  national  business  is expanding  into the international market.

624
00:52:20,875 --> 00:52:25,190
Out there there's all kinds of mazuma doing the rounds - Chechen, American, Columbian -  you get  the  picture.

625
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:30,105
And if  you look at them like mazuma, then they're all the same.

626
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:34,740
But in actual fact behind every kind of mazuma there's a national idea.

627
00:52:35,953 --> 00:52:39,420
We used to have this communism stuff.

628
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,430
Now that's  all over,  and there's no idea  left at all 'cept  for mazuma.

629
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:49,755
But there's  no  way you can have nothing but mazuma behind mazuma, right?

630
00:52:49,755 --> 00:52:54,193
Cause then there's  just  no way to understand why some mazuma's up front and some's in behind, right?

631
00:52:54,193 --> 00:52:56,366
Spot on. Listen and leam. Babe.

632
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:59,875
The Chechens have one, but we don't.

633
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:02,801
That's  why they look at  us  like we're shit.

634
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:08,275
There's got  to be some clear, simple  Russian idea,

635
00:53:08,275 --> 00:53:12,926
so's we can lay it out for any bastard from any of their Harvards.

636
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:14,860
So that I could explain them:

637
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,886
one-two, tickety-boo, and screw all that staring.

638
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:21,580
So's they  won't  think...

639
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,193
all we've done in Russia  is heist the money and put up  a steel door.

640
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:30,521
So's they can feel the same kind of spirit

641
00:53:30,521 --> 00:53:34,115
like in '45 at Stalingrad, you get me?

642
00:53:35,355 --> 00:53:36,515
So there you go.

643
00:53:37,721 --> 00:53:40,737
At first  the  task hadn't seemed very complicated,

644
00:53:40,737 --> 00:53:43,155
but once I'd sat down to it I'd been horrified to realise

645
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:46,198
there wasn't a single idea  in my head.

646
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:54,195
Fyodor Dostoyevsky, tell me, what is the Russian national idea?

647
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:04,105
An  appeal to  the  spirit  of Dostoievsky,  in whom I had placed especially  high hopes,

648
00:54:04,105 --> 00:54:07,286
did  evoke certain interesting side-effects.

649
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,286
Although, of course,  I  could  console myself  with the thought

650
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:11,825
that the idea I was  seeking was so transcendent

651
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:15,475
that  this  was the  only way it could be expressed on  paper.

652
00:54:17,235 --> 00:54:19,121
Come in, come in.

653
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,841
I've written it. As best I could.

654
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:29,940
But I think I screwed up, and it's not something you should give to Wee Vova.

655
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,910
- In  general ... - Forget it.

656
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,955
Wee Vova's been taken out.

657
00:54:36,515 --> 00:54:38,430
- How? - Dead easy.

658
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,177
Yesterday  he had a shoot-out with the Chechens.

659
00:54:42,177 --> 00:54:47,526
Those  bastards dug a trench on  the hill opposite during the night

660
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:49,865
And as soon as he turned up they blasted him with a pair of "bumble-bee" flame-throwers.

661
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:52,545
Нou know what it is? It is fearsome fucking thing.

662
00:54:52,545 --> 00:54:53,980
Wee's  car was armour-plated,

663
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:57,820
but armour's  only good against normal people, not these abortions...

664
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:00,590
But what does it mean for us, in a practical sense?

665
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,158
Leave. Indefinite  leave.

666
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:05,873
- I already had two calls  since the morning. - The police?

667
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:08,427
Yeah. And then from the Caucasian Friendly Society.

668
00:55:08,427 --> 00:55:12,185
"We know  you've got diamonds,"  they said.

669
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:17,542
What kind of diamonds have I got? Tell me  that. What diamonds have I got?

670
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,566
I  don't  know,

671
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:20,918
OK, relax.

672
00:55:21,702 --> 00:55:25,820
Just carry on living, loving, working... Hello?

673
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:30,662
Yes, he is here. He is coming. There's someone waiting for you in the  waiting room.

674
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:40,113
- Hi. - Hi.

675
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:44,438
What a face, Babe! Do you need a job?

676
00:55:44,438 --> 00:55:45,886
Yes I do.

677
00:55:45,886 --> 00:55:48,475
Let's go then.

678
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,945
Wow ... What a car!

679
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,300
- Do you like it? - Sure.

680
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,041
It turns on oral wow-factor.

681
00:56:02,041 --> 00:56:06,321
Yes, it does. It's the only reason to drive it.

682
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:10,241
Wow! Wow! Wow!

683
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,265
Listen, where are we going?

684
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:14,198
I don't want to spoil the impression.

685
00:56:14,198 --> 00:56:18,425
Just act natural. But don't go saying too much.

686
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:20,438
What exactly does "too much" mean?

687
00:56:20,438 --> 00:56:23,486
What you just said  is a good example.

688
00:56:26,475 --> 00:56:28,020
Don't worry about looking stupid, Babylen.

689
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,830
In fact, be careful not to seem too smart.

690
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:35,110
And  pile on the cynicism.

691
00:56:38,833 --> 00:56:40,075
Join the club.

692
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:42,150
We're old members.

693
00:56:48,366 --> 00:56:50,017
- Wow. - You like it?

694
00:56:50,017 --> 00:56:54,155
Of course, Patek Philippe Possession, if I'm not mistaken?

695
00:56:54,155 --> 00:56:56,780
I think it costs 170 thousand dollars?

696
00:57:00,046 --> 00:57:03,515
Patek Philippe? Yes, so it is!

697
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:09,366
There's nothing  that  identifies  someone  as belonging  to the lower classes of society  so clearly

698
00:57:09,366 --> 00:57:13,980
 as knowing  all about expensive  watches and cars.

699
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,510
Don't teach us. Come on.

700
00:57:24,267 --> 00:57:25,321
Well, what do you think?

701
00:57:25,321 --> 00:57:27,675
Excellent. Simply excellent!

702
00:57:27,675 --> 00:57:30,686
One thing I don't understand, is why all this fancy technology?

703
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:33,281
It's all very elegant, but isn't it a bit unusual!

704
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:39,950
Didn't you see the sign on our premises? The Institute of Apiculture?

705
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,502
Well then. Here we are, making like bees.

706
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:52,075
Stop. So, you wait with alla.

707
00:57:52,075 --> 00:57:54,110
- OK. - I'll have a word with the man.

708
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:57,873
Have a seat. Come on, Have a seat.

709
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:05,721
- Leonid Azadovsky. - Vladimir Tatarsky.

710
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:09,500
You're   no  Vladimir;  you're  called  Babylen. I know all about it.

711
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:15,137
I've had a look at your  work

712
00:58:15,137 --> 00:58:19,910
and I liked  it.

713
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:24,790
Only in  a few places ... I don't  completely believe  it.

714
00:58:26,358 --> 00:58:30,193
Here,  for  instance;  you  write about  the "collective unconscious".

715
00:58:31,612 --> 00:58:32,926
Do you actually know what that is?

716
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,561
At the unconscious collective level.

717
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,590
Aren't you afraid someone might turn up who knows exactly what it is?

718
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,020
No, Mr Azadovsky, I'm  not afraid of that.

719
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:46,806
and the  reason I'm not is that for a long time now everyone who knows

720
00:58:46,806 --> 00:58:48,801
what the "collective unconscious" is

721
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:50,745
has been selling cigarettes outside the metro.

722
00:58:50,745 --> 00:58:52,780
One way  or another, I mean.

723
00:58:53,806 --> 00:58:55,275
Is there anything at all you believe in?

724
00:58:58,681 --> 00:59:00,587
No.

725
00:59:02,817 --> 00:59:04,075
Well, that's  good.

726
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,937
What's next ... Political views.

727
00:59:07,937 --> 00:59:15,315
It says "upper left" in English. I  don't get  it.

728
00:59:15,315 --> 00:59:18,001
Fuck, soon  every document  we have'll be written in English.

729
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:21,166
So what are your political views?

730
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,820
Marketer, quite radical.

731
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,830
And more specifically?

732
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,505
More specifically... Let's just say

733
00:59:29,875 --> 00:59:34,086
I like it when life has big tits,

734
00:59:34,086 --> 00:59:36,433
but  I'm  not  in  the  slightest  bit  excited

735
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:38,220
by  the  so-called  Kantian tit-in-itself,

736
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,646
no matter how much milk there might be splashing about in it.

737
00:59:45,355 --> 00:59:47,366
So keep looking!

738
00:59:50,825 --> 00:59:53,435
What was  that about titsr? Only keep it  short?

739
00:59:53,435 --> 00:59:58,673
To cut it  short, On  the  tit market the only tit that  gives  me a buzz is

740
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,852
the  Feuerbachian tit-for-us.

741
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:05,150
That's what  I think  too.

742
01:00:06,195 --> 01:00:08,780
Even if it's not so big,

743
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,785
so long as it's Feuerbachian.

744
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,806
Now that's what  I wanted  to hear! And the control shot?

745
01:00:22,606 --> 01:00:23,700
Great!

746
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:30,193
Ow!

747
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:34,401
Op-pa-pa-param ...

748
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,100
- 'What's that? - Rostropovich.

749
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:43,132
Come on, Take hold of his paws and  pull them apart.  Like  a little Jesus.

750
01:00:43,132 --> 01:00:47,420
A hamster of God Rostropovich is awarded!

751
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,292
- What did he get the medal for? - I'm in a good mood.

752
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:53,510
Why, are you jealous?'

753
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:55,601
Why does he have such a strange name?

754
01:00:55,601 --> 01:00:58,337
You know what,Babylen, Rostropovich could ask you the same thing.

755
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:01,926
- D'you think I could... - Shit-stupid question.

756
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,630
Crazy, where you go? Can't you see that I'm washing the floor?

757
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,918
Sorry. This Institute is really good.

758
01:01:24,427 --> 01:01:27,600
It happens so often:  you step outside on a summer's morning

759
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,905
and  come face to face with this immense, beautiful world hastening on its way to some unknown destination

760
01:01:30,905 --> 01:01:34,230
and filled with mysterious promise, and the blue sky is awash  with happiness,

761
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:38,806
and suddenly your heart  is  pierced  by  a  feeling, compressed  into a  single split second,

762
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:42,662
that  there life is in front of you and you can follow it on down the road without a backwards glance,

763
01:01:42,662 --> 01:01:45,270
gamble on yourself  and win,

764
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,355
go coursing across life's seas on a  white  speedboat

765
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:50,030
and hurtling along  her  roads in  a white Mercedes

766
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:53,870
and nobody will  ever dare to  use that American word 'loser' about you.

767
01:01:58,601 --> 01:01:59,990
Excuse me, please.

768
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:04,598
Excuse me, soldier, can you tell me this road leads to city center?

769
01:02:04,598 --> 01:02:07,515
Kandahar was way heavier!

770
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,350
I beg your pardon.

771
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:13,715
What a fucker, And they want to build a market economy with people like that.

772
01:02:16,006 --> 01:02:18,705
So  who will you believe -

773
01:02:18,705 --> 01:02:23,841
the heartless advertising or your  own family doctor?

774
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:24,721
Take it.

775
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,825
Just look at it fizz! So that's what an upgrade can do...

776
01:02:31,721 --> 01:02:34,662
It used  to take two days to render a report like this,

777
01:02:34,662 --> 01:02:35,995
but  now we do it  in a single night,

778
01:02:35,995 --> 01:02:39,500
which means  we can program more  gestures and facial expressions.

779
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,681
But what is it we render?

780
01:02:46,246 --> 01:02:50,726
Azadovsky said you  like life to have  big tits,

781
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:53,515
Hey, Arkasha, Don't laugh now, but we'll have to go again.

782
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:56,267
Well, this is the  biggest of the lot.

783
01:02:56,267 --> 01:02:57,155
Try another shot to loosen you up.

784
01:02:57,155 --> 01:02:59,270
So far it's still kind  of tight.

785
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:02,038
- How many more times? - Who's that?

786
01:03:02,038 --> 01:03:06,345
That's Arkady. He used to do Shakespeare at  the  Young  People's Theatre.

787
01:03:06,345 --> 01:03:07,860
But what does he do?

788
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,358
You'll see in a moment.

789
01:03:21,707 --> 01:03:23,110
What are those washers he's got on him?

790
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,675
Those are sensors.

791
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:28,020
When Arkasha moves, we record their trajectory,

792
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,857
superimpose it on the  model and...

793
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:34,502
When you lower your arm,  make it grander, more majestic.

794
01:03:44,545 --> 01:03:48,515
Listen, why do we show him pissed if he's only virtual?

795
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:50,190
Improves the channel's ratings.

796
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:53,558
Never  tried to figure out why it's forty thousand a minute during prime time news?

797
01:03:53,558 --> 01:03:55,961
Render-server 100/400.

798
01:03:55,961 --> 01:04:00,481
It can  render  up   to   one  hundred   primary  and  four  hundred  secondary politicians.

799
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:02,657
You say the Americans are doing the same?

800
01:04:02,657 --> 01:04:04,460
Sure. But scriptwriters are  ten  times  as  good.

801
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,315
Just look what rounded characters they  write.

802
01:04:07,315 --> 01:04:10,838
Yeltsin, Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky.

803
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:13,700
As good  as Chekhov.  The Three Sisters.

804
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,321
But it's such a massive scam.

805
01:04:16,321 --> 01:04:18,460
Aagh, no, please, not that.

806
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:21,867
By his very nature every politician is just a television broadcast.

807
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,385
Those who move - semi-stiffs.

808
01:04:24,385 --> 01:04:27,158
And those who do not move - stiffs.

809
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,235
- Tuborg, please. - Two.

810
01:04:30,235 --> 01:04:33,020
So copywriters write all their texts for them, but who sets a mission?

811
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,846
And  who decides which way national policy's going to move tomorrow? Oligarchs?

812
01:04:38,561 --> 01:04:40,630
The oligarchs are also our clients.

813
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:44,161
Half of them gave control over their lifes to us.

814
01:04:44,161 --> 01:04:47,622
We make them to go to cocktail parties. Show them in the news.

815
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:51,100
We even fuck their wives, figuratively speaking.

816
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,860
What do you mean?

817
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:00,286
Wait a minute, what about all the people who see them every day?

818
01:05:00,286 --> 01:05:01,915
I am Farsuk Farseikin.

819
01:05:01,915 --> 01:05:05,100
There's  a special service for that called The  People's  Will.

820
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,620
More than a hundred of them, former  state security agents, and  all Azadovsky's  men.

821
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,185
That's their job:

822
01:05:10,185 --> 01:05:15,158
to  go  around telling people they've just seen our leaders.

823
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:19,345
One at his three-storey dacha, one with an under-age whore,

824
01:05:19,345 --> 01:05:24,190
one  in a yellow Lamborghini on the Rubliovskoe Highway.

825
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,785
Then what's holding the whole lot up?

826
01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:29,390
Ouch! What are you doing?

827
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:34,886
Don't you ever, not ever, think about that!

828
01:05:39,446 --> 01:05:43,801
Oh! Can you turn on the sound?

829
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:45,355
My motherland gives me, For getting it right

830
01:05:46,886 --> 01:05:48,225
My fill of her fizzy,

831
01:05:48,225 --> 01:05:53,206
My son made this clip. I haven't seen it yet.

832
01:05:53,206 --> 01:06:00,115
Her birch-bright Sprite!

833
01:06:00,115 --> 01:06:07,065
Her birch-bright Sprite!

834
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:09,366
Motherfuckers.

835
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,940
Who?

836
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,540
If only I knew...

837
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,593
Blo!

838
01:06:28,593 --> 01:06:30,220
- Hi. - You're here too?

839
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,225
- In the dirt department? - How d'you know?

840
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:35,865
That's where everybody  starts out. Till they get their  hand  in.

841
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:36,585
So what're you doing now?

842
01:06:36,585 --> 01:06:39,470
I'm head of the Russian Idea department. There, in the wing.

843
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:40,315
Ah, yes I see.

844
01:06:40,315 --> 01:06:43,710
Drop in  if you have  any ideas, alright?

845
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:45,238
I'm  not  much good to you.

846
01:06:45,238 --> 01:06:47,425
I tried thinking about it, but it was a flop.

847
01:06:47,425 --> 01:06:51,313
You should try driving  around the suburbs and asking the guys on the street.

848
01:06:51,313 --> 01:06:52,945
I tried that at the  beginning.

849
01:06:52,945 --> 01:06:58,060
You  pour the vodka, look into their eyes, and then it's always the same answer:

850
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:02,246
"Bugger  off and crash your fucking  Mercedes!"

851
01:07:02,246 --> 01:07:05,867
Can't think of anything cooler than a Mercedes...

852
01:07:05,867 --> 01:07:09,670
And it's all so destructive. Is it yours?

853
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,292
Yes it is.

854
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:13,681
- 40 minutes of embarrassment  gets you to work.. - Huh?

855
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:18,700
Come on, Everything's still ahead of you.. Bye.

856
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:27,326
Replace "Judea" with "democracy" and add some black rhetoric.

857
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:30,286
- It will be very topical. - Malyuta!

858
01:07:30,286 --> 01:07:31,900
What you are doing here?

859
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:36,281
I write the image  menu  for the whole  cabal.

860
01:07:36,281 --> 01:07:41,865
Have you  ever heard of pelmeni  with kapusta? Or kvass with khrenok?

861
01:07:41,865 --> 01:07:43,510
Those  are  my hits.

862
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,140
You know each other?

863
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:49,398
Oh, we worked together  at  Khanin's place.

864
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:52,465
So you shouldn't have any  problems working together.

865
01:07:53,945 --> 01:07:55,595
Yes, in Mother  Russia, Monopoly's a bit dicey.

866
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:58,265
You buy a couple of streets, and then it turns out there are people living on them.

867
01:07:58,265 --> 01:08:01,926
Often people actually think the streets are theirs.

868
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:02,761
That's  not quite how it  is.

869
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:05,710
Nowadays people find out what they think from the television.

870
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:08,747
So if you want to buy up a couple of streets and still sleep well,

871
01:08:08,747 --> 01:08:11,780
first you have to buy a TV tower.

872
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:15,545
I'm selling off my TV announcer, I don't like television.

873
01:08:15,545 --> 01:08:16,540
I'm buying.

874
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,617
What's  wrong,  Salaman? I'll start getting worried if you keep this up.

875
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:21,766
Of course my head isn't armour-plated, that's  obvious.

876
01:08:21,766 --> 01:08:23,430
But then neither is yours, as you know very well.

877
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:26,425
And my  protection are all over the place... Aha... That's what they told you on your radio?

878
01:08:26,425 --> 01:08:30,595
They  wrote  in  Forbes  magazine  that  you  grasp everything instantly.

879
01:08:30,595 --> 01:08:33,606
But every person who catches everything instantly, -

880
01:08:33,606 --> 01:08:34,515
wrote Forbes, -

881
01:08:34,515 --> 01:08:36,825
should be prepared to situation in which someone would

882
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:39,060
instantly catch him.

883
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:41,385
Your people are already neutralized.

884
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:43,035
You subscribe to Forbes.

885
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:46,035
Why not? Chechnya's part of Europe now.

886
01:08:46,035 --> 01:08:48,985
If you're so cultured, then why you grab the gun?

887
01:08:48,985 --> 01:08:52,020
Let's talk like two European, Without all this barbarism?

888
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,681
Go on then.

889
01:08:52,681 --> 01:08:55,086
Tell me, by the way, who is it filming us with that hidden camera?

890
01:08:55,086 --> 01:08:56,025
What camera?

891
01:08:56,025 --> 01:08:58,345
What's  that  briefcase over  there  on the  window  sill?

892
01:08:58,345 --> 01:08:58,998
Ah, spawn of Satan.

893
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:07,745
Hey, Tatarsky, where  do  you work?

894
01:09:07,745 --> 01:09:09,265
In Berezovsky's "LogoVAZ" PR department,

895
01:09:09,265 --> 01:09:11,612
or in my dirt squad?

896
01:09:11,612 --> 01:09:13,955
In the dirt squad.

897
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:18,390
If we  didn't  produce  Berezovsky ourselves,

898
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,705
I  might imagine  you  were being  paid by him.

899
01:09:20,705 --> 01:09:25,067
And who's this Raduev of  yours? Some kind of professor of theology?

900
01:09:25,067 --> 01:09:27,473
He reads magazines even I've never heard of.

901
01:09:27,473 --> 01:09:31,235
But there has to be some development of the plot, some logic...

902
01:09:31,235 --> 01:09:35,710
I don't want logic,  I want dirt.

903
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:39,561
And this isn't dirt, it's just plain shit. Understand?

904
01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:44,355
But in general, there is a certain healthy core to it.

905
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:48,278
The first plus is that it makes you hate television.  You want to watch  it  and hate  it...

906
01:09:48,278 --> 01:09:52,758
The second plus is  that game of  Monopoly.

907
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,995
- Was that your own idea? - Yes.

908
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:58,657
That works.

909
01:09:58,657 --> 01:10:04,155
Terrorist and oligarch dividing up the people's wealth  at the gaming table...

910
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,140
The punters'll go raging mad at that.

911
01:10:08,755 --> 01:10:10,860
- But isn't  it  a  bit  too... - No.

912
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,345
The  most important thing is to keep brains occupied  and feelings involved.

913
01:10:14,345 --> 01:10:19,132
So  this move with the Monopoly  is  OK.

914
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:22,665
It'll  improve the  news rating by five per cent at least. Sit down.

915
01:10:23,595 --> 01:10:27,446
To cut  it short, let them play Monopoly

916
01:10:27,446 --> 01:10:30,305
and you tell the producer to inter-cut it with shots of

917
01:10:30,305 --> 01:10:35,100
queues  for the savings bank,  miners, old  women, hungry children,

918
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,022
wounded soldiers. That's it.

919
01:10:38,022 --> 01:10:39,710
Right, listen to the doctor's orders. Morkovin,

920
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,550
you give him Malyuta, who writes about geopolitics for reinforcements.

921
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:45,526
And do it now, urgent material.

922
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:48,505
What have  we got next?

923
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:50,635
Ads for televisions. A new type.

924
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:53,547
Get on  with  it. There's still twenty minutes to go.

925
01:11:02,161 --> 01:11:07,030
Rus-si-a - mo-ther-land.

926
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:12,761
Kol'-ya O-go-rod-ni-kov.

927
01:11:13,481 --> 01:11:15,041
What you think?

928
01:11:15,041 --> 01:11:17,985
What was  that? And what product is advertised?

929
01:11:17,985 --> 01:11:20,166
Yes, what product?

930
01:11:20,366 --> 01:11:21,155
Pickles.

931
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:26,993
There's one thing you don't understand. Only one thing.

932
01:11:26,993 --> 01:11:31,110
We implement patriotism, not prickles.

933
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:36,150
Sensation: Secret negotiations of Raduyev and Berezovsky.

934
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:40,435
You will see the oligarch and a terrorist planing to monopolize

935
01:11:40,435 --> 01:11:43,395
natural resources and human consciousness,

936
01:11:43,395 --> 01:11:47,142
what disasters they are preparing for Russia.

937
01:11:47,142 --> 01:11:52,252
Today at 22:00 in analytical program "Farseikin".

938
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:03,846
This is twenty from Berezovsky,

939
01:12:03,846 --> 01:12:05,532
Wow!

940
01:12:05,532 --> 01:12:10,860
ten from Raduev and another two from the Chechens.

941
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,390
Listen, I don't understand.

942
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:15,595
They give us the money in order we to compromise them?

943
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:19,641
Ouch! You again?

944
01:12:19,641 --> 01:12:25,155
I told you: Don't think of that! Never think of that!

945
01:12:25,155 --> 01:12:28,270
If we are getting money, it means that someone is interested in our work?

946
01:12:29,222 --> 01:12:31,806
But to pinch yourself is something that you should do on your own.

947
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:36,670
Just as something comes to your mind, pinch or prick yourself with something sharp.

948
01:12:37,995 --> 01:12:42,755
You know, I've got a safety pin specially for that.

949
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:46,630
I carry it since 1996.

950
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:53,521
If something comes to my mind, I just open it ...

951
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:56,590
And - Bang! Bang! Bang!

952
01:12:56,675 --> 01:12:59,601
- What.. - That's it.

953
01:13:00,438 --> 01:13:02,033
Hush!

954
01:13:05,486 --> 01:13:08,500
I'll explain. I'll explain everything.

955
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,241
Who edited Ivanov the last time?

956
01:13:10,241 --> 01:13:12,820
Seva, as usual. What's happened?

957
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:15,942
You changed Ivanov's cigarettes, bitch! It's you!

958
01:13:15,942 --> 01:13:19,020
You wanted to inter-cut it with Chirac, anti-American coalition.

959
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:22,265
Whom you're lying to, you bastard! Whom you're lying to?

960
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:25,862
We've got a two-year contract with Camel!

961
01:13:25,862 --> 01:13:27,478
And you're making black PR secretly?

962
01:13:27,478 --> 01:13:29,321
Wait I've got something important to tell you...

963
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:30,190
Take him away!

964
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:35,340
Wait! I want to say something... Something very important!

965
01:13:44,252 --> 01:13:44,900
Have you watched the material?

966
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,595
I have. He waves the pack around all through the interview.

967
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:49,140
When's the next broadcast?

968
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:50,761
- Tomorrow. - What can we do?

969
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:56,841
Well, thieves, got your money, yes? And you too, eh! And you!

970
01:13:56,841 --> 01:13:59,793
Exchange Camel for Gitanes!

971
01:13:59,793 --> 01:14:04,185
Go ahead, otherwise I'll kill you! Really kill you!

972
01:14:05,585 --> 01:14:06,833
Go away!

973
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:07,470
Go!

974
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,795
Any ideas?

975
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:16,105
Perhaps, we could put the arm  in plaster, so we get rid of the pack.

976
01:14:16,105 --> 01:14:18,347
Exactly. An assassination attempt.

977
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:20,686
They tried to blow him up in his car.

978
01:14:20,686 --> 01:14:22,950
What'll we say in the news?

979
01:14:22,950 --> 01:14:26,100
As little as possible. Clues pointing to Chechens.

980
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,081
- So. - The Islamic factor.

981
01:14:27,081 --> 01:14:27,550
OK.

982
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:33,780
The bomber on the old Mercedes bumps in the car.

983
01:14:35,366 --> 01:14:40,475
This is brilliant, but where'll we get an  old Mercedes by 10 am?

984
01:14:40,475 --> 01:14:42,025
- Maybe, Zhiguly? - Yes, I ...

985
01:14:42,025 --> 01:14:43,601
What?  We can't use Zhiguly.

986
01:14:43,601 --> 01:14:47,305
Mercedes SS. To be sure!

987
01:14:49,105 --> 01:14:51,555
Nobody is cutting expenditures during celebration.

988
01:14:51,555 --> 01:14:55,206
I've seen white Mercedes in the parking lot.

989
01:14:55,206 --> 01:14:57,697
There's someone here who drives one.

990
01:14:57,697 --> 01:14:58,652
Come on, come on.

991
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:03,350
- Give me the keys. - The seat-covers are new. Maybe...

992
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:07,137
Are you fucking crazy?  Seat-covers? What are you thinking about?

993
01:15:10,281 --> 01:15:13,155
So, now you are going out to film car accident between "Mercedes" and "Volga".

994
01:15:13,155 --> 01:15:14,750
Take that arse-hole Seva,

995
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,790
put him  in  the driver's  seat and blow him  up.

996
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:22,390
Make  sure there's blood and scraps of flesh.

997
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,075
Today at the Taras Shevchenko embankment

998
01:15:24,075 --> 01:15:26,081
an assassination attempt was made on General Ivanov,

999
01:15:26,081 --> 01:15:27,806
when he was going to attend the meeting in Parliament.

1000
01:15:27,806 --> 01:15:30,305
Mercedes, full of explosives smashed into Volga.

1001
01:15:30,305 --> 01:15:33,945
General miraculously survived, but his driver was killed ...

1002
01:15:33,945 --> 01:15:37,057
Criminal proceedings initiated.

1003
01:15:37,057 --> 01:15:40,235
I think that all the evidence found at crime scene

1004
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,566
are pointing to Chechen terrorists.

1005
01:15:42,566 --> 01:15:46,230
However, you will see, exclusive material, on our channel ...

1006
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:52,092
This week, in Murmansk

1007
01:15:52,092 --> 01:15:54,326
nuclear  cruiser The Idiot will slide down the slipway.

1008
01:15:54,326 --> 01:15:56,278
Its keel was laid to mark the hundred and  fiftieth anniversary

1009
01:15:56,278 --> 01:15:59,155
of the birth of Fedor Mikhailovich Dostoievsky.

1010
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:01,086
- Today in the State Duma ...

1011
01:16:01,086 --> 01:16:04,180
Listen, yesterday I saw Azadovsky  in another two clips.

1012
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,566
I see him every time I turn on the TV.

1013
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:08,761
What does it all  mean? Does he just like being filmed?

1014
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:10,945
Yes, it's a weakness of his.

1015
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:13,846
My advice to you is not to stick your nose into that for the time being.

1016
01:16:13,846 --> 01:16:16,585
Some time maybe you'll find out all about it. All right?

1017
01:16:16,585 --> 01:16:18,201
All right.

1018
01:16:18,201 --> 01:16:21,222
Turn on the TV. Urgent work, we have a crisis:

1019
01:16:21,222 --> 01:16:23,395
Seva deleted  the entire government.

1020
01:16:26,385 --> 01:16:28,681
What do you mean?

1021
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:31,766
He wrote a program that would delete the entire  directory

1022
01:16:31,766 --> 01:16:36,161
at the end of the month, and he planted  it in Kirienko's file.

1023
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:40,806
After that the program infected  the  entire government.

1024
01:16:40,806 --> 01:16:43,220
Then  everything  defaulted.

1025
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:46,347
Before his death he tried to say something important.

1026
01:16:46,347 --> 01:16:50,870
It's a pity that the bastard had such an easy death.

1027
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:54,900
Get dressed, driver is  waiting for you downstairs.

1028
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,721
Radio: (verse) No icons, no Berdyaev, no "Third Eye" technique,

1029
01:16:58,721 --> 01:17:02,406
would save us from bad guys, who have seized oil and gas!

1030
01:17:02,406 --> 01:17:03,921
Advertising Service of "Russian radio".

1031
01:17:08,281 --> 01:17:10,033
And now, breaking news  on the "Russian Radio".

1032
01:17:10,033 --> 01:17:12,425
We just received a message from the Kremlin.

1033
01:17:12,425 --> 01:17:15,460
President Yeltsin signed a decree on dismissal of the government of prime-minister Kiriyenko.

1034
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:19,147
A new prime minister has not yet been approved.

1035
01:17:19,147 --> 01:17:22,342
We can say that currently there is no government in Russia.

1036
01:17:23,401 --> 01:17:24,241
So.

1037
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:28,940
Babylen Vladimirovich, how should people live, if they don't believe in anything at all?

1038
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,945
If you've got good conscience

1039
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:36,860
you will give up a seat to an old lady in metro, yeah?

1040
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,742
Well, that's the truth of our life, eh?

1041
01:17:41,860 --> 01:17:47,321
As it is said: "Strong help the weak", right?

1042
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:49,857
And we say - no. If you strong - oppress the weak.

1043
01:17:49,857 --> 01:17:52,926
If you rich give to the poor. And we say - no.

1044
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:57,401
Grab all and hire security, to keep money safe.

1045
01:17:57,401 --> 01:17:59,305
You're marry fellow, Nicholai.

1046
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:04,001
Babylen Vladimirovich, a marry fellow is in my pants!

1047
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:10,041
- Maybe give a hint on revolution? - What?

1048
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,601
- Well, we will show something. - Show what?

1049
01:18:14,601 --> 01:18:17,940
Well, something usual, in such cases - "Swan Lake".

1050
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:19,790
Yeah, awesome!

1051
01:18:24,305 --> 01:18:29,161
By the way, according to prediction of Ilyin, Russia to revive authoritarian regime,

1052
01:18:29,161 --> 01:18:32,326
nationalistic in its mood. Do you understand what that means?

1053
01:18:32,326 --> 01:18:34,225
No, I do not understand.

1054
01:18:34,225 --> 01:18:38,686
We're the third Rome, which tellingly is on the Volga.

1055
01:18:38,686 --> 01:18:41,406
Hence our total historical self-sufficiency.

1056
01:18:41,406 --> 01:18:42,790
and national dignity.

1057
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:45,460
Yes, yes. that's neat.

1058
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,121
What?

1059
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:52,126
Well, do you remember that Philotheus said that "a fourth there will not be"?

1060
01:18:52,126 --> 01:18:56,755
And Jesus said: "And to drink that day".

1061
01:18:56,755 --> 01:18:58,620
And didn't say which day.

1062
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:02,177
So let us drink every day, so that not to miss that day.

1063
01:19:04,265 --> 01:19:08,345
Why you get pissed off all the time, little motherfucker? You didn't propose anything yet.

1064
01:19:08,345 --> 01:19:11,590
And I ... propose a toast in your honor Marlen.

1065
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,465
For your dull mind!

1066
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:20,721
What do you want? What do you want? Fucking spy?

1067
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:23,457
You're tough guy, yeah?

1068
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:26,865
- What did you say? What did you say? - OK, guys, calm down!

1069
01:19:26,865 --> 01:19:29,030
- Easy, Easy, Easy! Put away your hands...

1070
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,985
- What? - Calm down!

1071
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,300
Relax! Quiet!

1072
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:43,860
- Quiet! - That's it!

1073
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:47,110
Nice discharge, eh?

1074
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:48,740
Yes it is!

1075
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,705
That's it. If we go, than we go all the way.

1076
01:19:50,705 --> 01:19:55,161
Yes, we should give people the show, then they will forget about everything:

1077
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:57,601
they'll forget about mothers, about fathers, about work, about wifes.

1078
01:19:57,601 --> 01:20:00,732
And most important thing - they will forget about the government, eh?

1079
01:20:00,732 --> 01:20:06,601
By the way, a good fight can replace government.

1080
01:20:08,185 --> 01:20:11,715
But who is such a tough guy?

1081
01:20:11,715 --> 01:20:15,132
- Huh? - You didn't understand anything, right?

1082
01:20:15,132 --> 01:20:17,905
We can create him ourelves, can we?

1083
01:20:17,905 --> 01:20:19,310
Yes we can. We just need images.

1084
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:22,982
Yeah. We will draw him, and then we will place him to Kremlin, if we want to.

1085
01:20:27,297 --> 01:20:33,260
We're looking at the poor man, right? We say: Oh, I know, he is liar!

1086
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:35,100
I saw this program on TV - It's the Mafia.

1087
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,740
Just give him 50 cents, even if he is really a liar!

1088
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:42,580
Lord. Why you always believe in what TV box says to you?

1089
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:45,377
Real mafia is just a few guys

1090
01:20:45,377 --> 01:20:48,660
sitting at the joystick and manipulating us!

1091
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:50,540
They won't take over.

1092
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:54,017
This is Kolya - our prototype.

1093
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:58,681
Kolya, we need you for our campaign.

1094
01:20:58,681 --> 01:21:01,726
I'm not a "Snickers" I don't need any promotion.

1095
01:21:01,726 --> 01:21:03,478
- Name, name, name. - Ivanov?

1096
01:21:03,478 --> 01:21:04,561
Sucks.

1097
01:21:04,561 --> 01:21:08,566
- Vasilyev? - No, Vasya Podberezovikov.

1098
01:21:08,566 --> 01:21:10,502
What about Smirnov?

1099
01:21:10,502 --> 01:21:12,435
A good Russian name,

1100
01:21:12,435 --> 01:21:16,918
and most importantly - the world's leading brand.

1101
01:21:16,918 --> 01:21:19,401
During the election campaign

1102
01:21:19,401 --> 01:21:21,366
we begining an advertising campaign of vodka Smirnoff,

1103
01:21:21,366 --> 01:21:24,006
that will help to invade the city with Smirnoff vodka banners.

1104
01:21:25,857 --> 01:21:30,755
Nostrils a little anxious. No, no, not here.

1105
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:35,230
Movement must be more confident. Much more confident than in real life.

1106
01:21:39,366 --> 01:21:42,001
Yeah. And now spin it.

1107
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:44,526
Don't worry, all problems will be solved.

1108
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,185
Don't worry, all problems will be solved.

1109
01:21:49,185 --> 01:21:51,740
- Excellent. - Good looker. Apollo.

1110
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,790
Almost finished.

1111
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,875
Attacker appeared to be a former military pilot, Nikolai Smirnov,

1112
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,820
we found him in the vehicle ...

1113
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,670
Nicholai, why are you started to fight?

1114
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:08,430
Yes, I can't stand these ugly bureaucratic faces.

1115
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:10,830
You're planning to go to politics or maybe you're afraid?

1116
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,366
Don't talk to me this way, of course I'm not afraid ?

1117
01:22:13,366 --> 01:22:15,265
Communist Party remains the leader.

1118
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:20,185
According to new data by 14 hours 24% of people voted for it.

1119
01:22:40,918 --> 01:22:43,318
Add him a mustache and medal.

1120
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,766
Add more women.

1121
01:22:48,766 --> 01:22:51,326
Sveta, I asked you not to call in working hours.

1122
01:22:53,835 --> 01:22:57,166
Why is he smiling like an idiot? Take away the smile!

1123
01:22:57,166 --> 01:23:01,155
My friends, being a little Siberian boy I couldn't imagine

1124
01:23:01,155 --> 01:23:06,390
that someday I will be at the helm of such a huge colossus.

1125
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:10,515
But with a team as mine, I'm not afraid even of the devil himself.

1126
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,246
Incredible.

1127
01:23:15,246 --> 01:23:19,555
People wouldn't even understand that it's not Tampax we're promoting; it's alarm and uncertainty.

1128
01:23:19,555 --> 01:23:25,041
And then - bam! Smirnoff, the only way to stop unconscious anxiety.

1129
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:29,161
You're fuckin' genius, Babe.

1130
01:23:37,126 --> 01:23:38,110
- Hello.

1131
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:40,646
Markovin, Look quick to the left.

1132
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:42,505
D'you know what it is?

1133
01:23:42,505 --> 01:23:45,820
Oh, that... Azadovsky recently told me.

1134
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:49,867
They started building an Air Defence station here. Early warning or some such thing.

1135
01:23:49,867 --> 01:23:53,225
Then,  you know, there  was  no one left  to  warn.

1136
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:55,910
What's  this station we're going to called?

1137
01:23:55,910 --> 01:23:59,665
"Rastorguevo". This is classic dirty beer-hall near  Moscow.

1138
01:23:59,665 --> 01:24:04,601
Leonid likes to drink beer here at weekends. So's he can really appreciate what he's achieved in life.

1139
01:24:04,601 --> 01:24:09,601
Hello, people! Well, how are you doing?

1140
01:24:09,601 --> 01:24:12,900
OK guys take this.

1141
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,260
Babe, there's something I want  to talk to you about. Come on.

1142
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:19,585
Two of  my brothers  have  moved  up here  from Yerevan

1143
01:24:19,585 --> 01:24:21,380
and  decided to set  up business.

1144
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:28,747
They've opened an exclusive funeral parlour with top-class service.

1145
01:24:28,747 --> 01:24:33,686
Just for friendship's sake, write me a decent slogan for them,

1146
01:24:33,686 --> 01:24:38,606
something that'll actually  get to  the target group.

1147
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,441
What's the firm called?

1148
01:24:40,441 --> 01:24:45,401
The family name.  The  Brothers  Debirsian  Funeral Parlour.

1149
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:50,635
you'll laugh when I tell you, but they've already  had one  of your acquaintances  as a  client.

1150
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:53,235
Who's that?

1151
01:24:53,235 --> 01:24:55,795
It was Khanin from  the Privy  Councillor  agency.

1152
01:24:59,446 --> 01:25:00,220
Someone took  him out.

1153
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,625
Who did it?

1154
01:25:02,345 --> 01:25:05,041
A murky business. Something to do with diamonds.

1155
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:08,921
I'll get some beer, wait.

1156
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:13,641
There I was picking up half a litre in the vegetable shop at the Kursk station,

1157
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:20,257
and guess who comes into the shop? Smirnov! Fuck me...

1158
01:25:20,257 --> 01:25:24,806
He  was wearing this shabby grey coat and a red mohair cap, and not a bodyguard in sight.

1159
01:25:24,806 --> 01:25:28,715
There was just a bit  of a bulge in his right pocket, as though he had his gun in there.

1160
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:31,505
I'm  standing there  gawping at  him with my  mouth  wide open,

1161
01:25:31,505 --> 01:25:34,841
and he noticed, gave me a wink and hopped  out the door.

1162
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:38,190
Bugger me, eh, the  things that happen...

1163
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:41,585
Smirnov appeared to be normal guy. - "People's Will"?

1164
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:47,627
Come on, deal with him.

1165
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:51,617
Guys, everything is fine.

1166
01:26:10,987 --> 01:26:15,681
DIAMONDS ARE NOT FOR EVER! THE BROTHERS DEBIRSIAN FUNERAL PARLOUR.

1167
01:26:16,875 --> 01:26:20,257
"Diamonds are, fucking,  NOT forever!"

1168
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:38,601
- My friend, who are you? - "People's Will". Calm down.

1169
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:43,153
Babe! Tatarsky!

1170
01:26:43,153 --> 01:26:48,046
Tatarsky it's "People's Will"!

1171
01:27:02,187 --> 01:27:04,545
What is the choice of Russia?

1172
01:27:04,545 --> 01:27:08,110
Russia chooses Smirnov!

1173
01:27:09,233 --> 01:27:11,001
What's it doing upside down?

1174
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,513
Long story. Where are you from?

1175
01:27:15,281 --> 01:27:17,990
That's the long story too.

1176
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:19,670
Yes.

1177
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:21,590
Babe, Where are you? Are you alive?

1178
01:27:23,006 --> 01:27:24,190
I'm alive.

1179
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:28,190
We've given them a good working over, and now  we'll  probably send  them off to jail.

1180
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:30,670
After the interrogation Azadovsky  was laughing like mad!

1181
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:34,305
Said you'd  released all his stress.

1182
01:27:34,305 --> 01:27:37,875
Next  time you'll get a  medal together  with Rostropovich.

1183
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:39,150
Shall I send some wheels round for you?

1184
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:43,230
No thanks, I think I'll go home. My nerves are shot.

1185
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,950
Yeah? I can  understand  that.

1186
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:48,355
Get yourself fixed up, Only don't be late tomorrow -

1187
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:50,465
we have a very important occasion.

1188
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,915
You'll see Azadovsky's collection. The Spanish section. Cheers for now.

1189
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:58,401
So they take me me for a hamster, then.

1190
01:27:58,401 --> 01:28:00,790
- What? - It does not matter.

1191
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:04,582
Listen, have you  got  any of those fly-agarics left?

1192
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:10,806
Yes. But I won't take any with you, after what happened the last time...

1193
01:28:10,806 --> 01:28:11,947
I'm really sorry.

1194
01:28:14,025 --> 01:28:15,595
I'll give you some  vodka.

1195
01:28:15,595 --> 01:28:20,257
Softens the effect. They can bugger  up your brains  if  you  take them neat.

1196
01:28:20,257 --> 01:28:24,113
You know, Andrei, I  don't  want this  to  sound sentimental,

1197
01:28:24,113 --> 01:28:26,035
but thank you very, very much!

1198
01:28:26,035 --> 01:28:27,441
What for?

1199
01:28:27,441 --> 01:28:30,347
For sometimes allowing me to live a  parallel  life.

1200
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:33,035
Without  that the real one would be so disgusting!

1201
01:29:42,681 --> 01:29:44,585
Well, where is the goddess?

1202
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,950
Only don't be late tomorrow - we have a very important event.

1203
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:06,785
You'll see Azadovsky's collection. The Spanish section.

1204
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:13,726
- Arrived? - Where are we?

1205
01:30:13,726 --> 01:30:17,692
In the Ostankino. I'm sorry about  the  blindfold and  all the  rest -

1206
01:30:17,692 --> 01:30:20,526
you should understand it's the ritual. Traditions, fuck 'em.

1207
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,206
You scared?

1208
01:30:23,206 --> 01:30:27,075
Don't  let  it bother you, it's a bullshit.

1209
01:30:27,075 --> 01:30:30,860
Allia! Show him everything over here.

1210
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:33,641
I'll be back, I've got to have a word with a couple of people.

1211
01:30:33,641 --> 01:30:36,572
Who do you like best of the great Spanish artists?

1212
01:30:39,566 --> 01:30:40,980
Velasquez.

1213
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:45,660
I'm crazy about the old satirist too. Good afternoon, Farsuk Karlovic.

1214
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:50,550
It's a  Picasso. Ceramic figurine of a  woman running.

1215
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:54,481
This sculpture was bought for $17 million.

1216
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,340
And where's the actual statue?

1217
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:59,110
Well, if you  want to see what it looks like,

1218
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:02,086
the catalogue's over there on that table.

1219
01:31:02,086 --> 01:31:05,707
It's the cutting edge  in design.

1220
01:31:05,707 --> 01:31:08,681
Monetaristic minimalism. They say it was invented here in Russia.

1221
01:31:08,681 --> 01:31:09,212
D'you like it?

1222
01:31:09,212 --> 01:31:12,726
It's interesting. But I don't really understand it.

1223
01:31:12,726 --> 01:31:14,420
Then I'll explain. Take a walk.

1224
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:20,105
To be honest, after you've seen these pictures once - maybe twice -

1225
01:31:21,398 --> 01:31:23,235
what're you going to see that's new?

1226
01:31:23,235 --> 01:31:25,326
- Nothing. - That's  right.

1227
01:31:25,326 --> 01:31:29,065
We'll come back here afterwards. For some champagne.

1228
01:31:29,065 --> 01:31:33,070
Keep your head down: the ceiling's low in here.

1229
01:31:53,025 --> 01:31:54,115
Get changed.

1230
01:31:57,041 --> 01:31:59,110
Let's go.

1231
01:31:59,307 --> 01:32:00,225
Where?

1232
01:32:00,225 --> 01:32:04,097
Do not worry, it's an in gathering.

1233
01:32:10,657 --> 01:32:15,313
Just don't turn sour on us, OK; don't  you go thinking we're nothing but a set of fuckheads.

1234
01:32:15,313 --> 01:32:17,067
Personally I couldn't  give a toss for all this,

1235
01:32:17,067 --> 01:32:20,902
but if you want to  be in our business, you can't get by without it.

1236
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:22,846
Ever go to pioneer camp?

1237
01:32:23,153 --> 01:32:24,945
- Sure. - Well,

1238
01:32:24,945 --> 01:32:26,086
Did you have that business with the Day of Neptune?

1239
01:32:26,086 --> 01:32:28,121
When everybody got dunked in the water? - Yeah.

1240
01:32:28,121 --> 01:32:32,035
Well, you just figure like this  is another Day of Neptune. Tradition.

1241
01:32:32,035 --> 01:32:36,086
The  story goes that once there was this ancient goddess.

1242
01:32:36,086 --> 01:32:39,945
And the storyline says  the gods were  mortal  as well

1243
01:32:39,945 --> 01:32:42,046
and  carried their deaths around inside them, just like ordinary folks.

1244
01:32:42,046 --> 01:32:45,940
So when her time was up, this goddess had to die too;

1245
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,046
and  naturally enough,  she  didn't fancy  the idea.

1246
01:32:47,046 --> 01:32:50,177
So  then  she separated into  her  own  death

1247
01:32:50,177 --> 01:32:53,206
and the part of her that didn't want to die.

1248
01:32:53,206 --> 01:32:58,881
She became gold - not just  the metal, though:  in a metaphorical sense. You follow  me?

1249
01:32:58,881 --> 01:33:00,918
To  cut it  short,  she became the thing that all people desire.

1250
01:33:00,918 --> 01:33:03,777
All gold  in general.

1251
01:33:03,777 --> 01:33:07,766
And her death became this lame dog with five legs

1252
01:33:07,766 --> 01:33:11,787
who had to sleep for ever in this distant country in  the  north.

1253
01:33:11,787 --> 01:33:14,940
There  he  is  on the  right,  see him? Got a leg instead of  a  prick.

1254
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,905
I read  something  similar. In a collection  of university  articles.

1255
01:33:17,905 --> 01:33:19,985
What was the  article about, though?  Our  firm?

1256
01:33:19,985 --> 01:33:22,140
No, about the pagan gods.

1257
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:26,977
One  of these  gods  was  the  lame  dog  Phukkup  with five  legs.

1258
01:33:28,086 --> 01:33:31,985
Tradition says he  sleeps  somewhere  among the snow,

1259
01:33:31,985 --> 01:33:35,875
but  when he wakes up, he attacks.

1260
01:33:35,875 --> 01:33:40,630
And who is it this Phukkup attacks in this article?

1261
01:33:40,630 --> 01:33:46,595
Not anyone or  anything special - just everything  in  general.

1262
01:33:48,118 --> 01:33:50,110
Everything.

1263
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,140
So what do they call the goddess?

1264
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,177
They  don't  call  her  anything.

1265
01:33:55,307 --> 01:33:59,201
Once a long time ago they  used to call her Ishtar.

1266
01:33:59,555 --> 01:34:02,982
And the story's the same with  the lame  dog. But  you were right about  all the rest.

1267
01:34:02,982 --> 01:34:08,886
I guess you understand that we in Russia have a special responsibility,

1268
01:34:08,886 --> 01:34:13,755
because the dog is sleeping here.

1269
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:18,977
Kneel down and remove your mask.

1270
01:34:27,825 --> 01:34:31,915
Thou art the medium,

1271
01:34:34,075 --> 01:34:38,987
and thou art the message.

1272
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:42,180
What liquid is that?

1273
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,326
Dog's blood.

1274
01:34:44,326 --> 01:34:47,292
I trust I don't need to explain the symbolism?

1275
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:54,915
No. I'm not an idiot; I've read a thing or two. What next?

1276
01:34:54,915 --> 01:34:58,726
Now you must look into the sacred eye.

1277
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,580
Don't  be scared.

1278
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,300
Through this eye the goddess recognises her husband;

1279
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:09,862
and since she already has a husband, it's a pure formality.

1280
01:35:09,862 --> 01:35:12,665
For Leonid, it's naturally a rather tense moment

1281
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,486
when someone else looks into the sacred eye,

1282
01:35:16,486 --> 01:35:21,281
but so far it's been all right. Go on.

1283
01:36:09,190 --> 01:36:11,155
What is this? What's happening?

1284
01:36:13,246 --> 01:36:16,201
Nothing's  happening any more.

1285
01:36:16,201 --> 01:36:21,825
It's already happened.

1286
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:23,750
But why?

1287
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:30,625
At the  sacred divination in  Atlanta the oracle  foretold

1288
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:35,425
that in our country Ishtar would  have a  new  husband.

1289
01:36:35,425 --> 01:36:38,460
We'd been  having  problems with Azadovsky for ages,

1290
01:36:38,766 --> 01:36:42,521
but  it  took  us a long time to figure out  who the new husband could be.

1291
01:36:42,521 --> 01:36:44,321
All that was said about him was

1292
01:36:47,612 --> 01:36:49,646
that he was a man with the name of a town.

1293
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:53,726
We  thought  and thought about  it, we searched,  and  then suddenly

1294
01:36:53,726 --> 01:36:57,718
they brought in  your file from the  first section.

1295
01:36:57,718 --> 01:37:03,595
Everything adds up: you're the one, Babylen.

1296
01:37:03,595 --> 01:37:05,230
Me?

1297
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:07,995
But why me?

1298
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:09,785
I  don't know. Ask  yourself that  one.

1299
01:37:09,785 --> 01:37:11,881
For  some  reason the goddess didn't choose me.

1300
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:14,910
Will they strangle me some time too?

1301
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:17,966
Well, that goes with the job.

1302
01:37:17,966 --> 01:37:21,057
The main thing is, if you have any doubts about anything, you just  come to  me.

1303
01:37:21,057 --> 01:37:22,220
And here's a first advise:

1304
01:37:23,201 --> 01:37:25,345
when you will move to Azadovsky office

1305
01:37:25,345 --> 01:37:30,180
get  rid  of  that cocaine-polluted  carpet.

1306
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:35,270
Farsuk Karlovich, will you tell me something, in confidence?

1307
01:37:37,505 --> 01:37:39,590
Who actually controls all of this?

1308
01:37:40,595 --> 01:37:42,513
Here's a second piece of advice:

1309
01:37:42,513 --> 01:37:47,361
not to stick your nose in - That way you'll stay a living god for longer

1310
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:55,105
And to be honest about it,  I don't know. Even after all the years I've been in the business.

1311
01:38:04,825 --> 01:38:05,721
What's that?

1312
01:38:05,721 --> 01:38:10,441
A 3D-scanner. The newest model. We brought it just yesterday.

1313
01:38:11,545 --> 01:38:15,515
According to the ritual, the husband of the great goddess must be digitized.

1314
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:17,545
Come here!

1315
01:38:21,697 --> 01:38:25,686
Don't  be  afraid.  It  doesn't  hurt  to  be  scanned. Sit down.

1316
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:28,345
Back should be straight.

1317
01:38:28,345 --> 01:38:31,310
That's your main sacramental function.

1318
01:38:32,257 --> 01:38:37,070
Strictly speaking, your 3-D model will be her husband,

1319
01:38:37,070 --> 01:38:41,041
and you'll be... a regent, I suppose.

1320
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:43,305
Don't worry, it is calibration.

1321
01:38:44,427 --> 01:38:46,486
- Farsuk Karlovich. - Yes?

1322
01:38:46,486 --> 01:38:48,595
have you heard of  the bird Semurg?

1323
01:38:48,595 --> 01:38:51,700
No. What kind of a bird is it?

1324
01:38:51,700 --> 01:38:54,755
There was an oriental poem,

1325
01:38:54,755 --> 01:38:56,860
I haven't read it myself, only  heard about it.

1326
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:59,955
About  how  thirty birds flew off to search  for their king Semurg

1327
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:04,921
and then, after all kinds of different tests, at the very end they learned

1328
01:39:04,921 --> 01:39:08,913
that the word "Semurg" means "thirty birds".

1329
01:39:08,913 --> 01:39:10,035
So?

1330
01:39:10,035 --> 01:39:13,995
I just thought,  maybe

1331
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:16,990
that generation, the one that chose Pepsi...

1332
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:22,027
I thought: that dog with five legs - maybe it's all of us together?

1333
01:39:22,027 --> 01:39:25,035
And  now we're all on the attack, sort of.

1334
01:39:25,641 --> 01:39:29,195
Right, now hold dead still and don't blink.

1335
01:39:30,395 --> 01:39:33,446
- Ready? - Ready.

1336
01:39:51,105 --> 01:39:55,980
I bow before the living god.

1337
01:40:15,955 --> 01:40:19,841
- Hello? - Hello!

1338
01:40:19,841 --> 01:40:21,867
Alla: I bow before the living god.

1339
01:40:21,867 --> 01:40:23,795
What are your instructions for today, boss?

1340
01:40:23,795 --> 01:40:25,641
None yet.

1341
01:40:29,073 --> 01:40:33,035
Although, you know what. alla, there will be  a few after  all.

1342
01:40:33,035 --> 01:40:37,161
Firstly, have the carpet in the office taken up - I'm fed up with it.

1343
01:40:38,001 --> 01:40:41,867
Secondly, make sure that  from  today on

1344
01:40:41,867 --> 01:40:43,830
there's nothing but Coca-Cola in the buffet, no  Pepsi.

1345
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:47,452
Thirdly, Malyuta doesn't work for us any more.

1346
01:40:47,452 --> 01:40:48,572
Why?

1347
01:40:48,572 --> 01:40:51,646
Because he's about as much use to us as a fifth leg to a dog.

1348
01:40:51,646 --> 01:40:55,617
All he does is spoil other people's scenarios, and then the mazuma has to go back.

1349
01:40:55,617 --> 01:40:59,515
And you, Alla, remember: if I say something,

1350
01:40:59,515 --> 01:41:02,380
you  don't ask "why?", you just jot it down. You follow?

1351
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:03,147
Yes.

1352
01:41:03,147 --> 01:41:04,795
That's all right then.

1353
01:41:10,806 --> 01:41:12,907
And  one more  thing, I completely forgot:

1354
01:41:12,907 --> 01:41:14,955
Yes, I'm listening.

1355
01:41:14,955 --> 01:41:18,035
Take care of Rostropovich.

1356
01:41:52,113 --> 01:41:54,265
The second phase of advertising campaign "MegaFon".

1357
01:41:54,265 --> 01:41:58,475
Partisan unit in the jungle. Che Guevara is sitting in a  a circle of friends.

1358
01:41:58,475 --> 01:42:01,540
Mobile phone screen lit up with the words:

1359
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:05,635
"Roaming even in Bolivia. MegaFon."

1360
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:12,875
Babylen Tatarsky's 3-D double appeared on screen times  without number,

1361
01:42:12,875 --> 01:42:16,990
but Tatarsky himself only liked to rewatch

1362
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:20,140
a few of the tapes.

1363
01:42:22,545 --> 01:42:28,262
There they are in great dread, For God is with the Righteous Generation!

1364
01:42:28,262 --> 01:42:32,950
There were they in great fear; for God is in the generation of the righteous.

1365
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:35,075
Verse from Psalm 14.

1366
01:42:35,075 --> 01:42:36,257
Very few people suspected

1367
01:42:36,257 --> 01:42:39,385
that it was advertising campaign made for "Pepsi-Cola"

1368
01:42:39,385 --> 01:42:42,950
invented by Tatarsky wowrism advertising technology.

1369
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:46,497
American radical fundamentalists

1370
01:42:46,497 --> 01:42:50,500
stamping in fury on a can of Pepsi-Cola, as a symbol of liberalism.

1371
01:42:51,065 --> 01:42:55,041
In accordance with the Tsar's Will

1372
01:42:55,550 --> 01:43:00,220
Execute Stenka Razin as a thief!

1373
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:04,585
Many still  remember the appearance of the Babylen Tatarsky as Stenka Razin

1374
01:43:04,585 --> 01:43:07,166
in a monumental advertising of shampoo Head & Shoulders.

1375
01:43:07,166 --> 01:43:09,270
Well, Stenka?

1376
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:15,585
Why you trow Persian princess overboard?

1377
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:20,430
Persian you say?

1378
01:43:21,921 --> 01:43:24,486
and she had called me dandruffic goat!

1379
01:43:24,486 --> 01:43:28,646
A dandruff is really falls from your head, bastard!

1380
01:43:33,361 --> 01:43:38,652
It's no worth crying over lost hair, if you lost your head. Head & Shoulders.

1381
01:43:38,652 --> 01:43:41,740
famous ad for the Moscow chain of Gap  stores,

1382
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:45,910
in which  Tatarsky appeared together with  his deputy Morkovin,

1383
01:43:47,110 --> 01:43:50,235
Afghanistan was  heavier

1384
01:43:52,747 --> 01:43:56,940
Babylen Tatarsky's 3-D double participated in political life.

1385
01:43:58,505 --> 01:44:03,782
"FSB planned to  kidnap a brother of the well-known businessman".

1386
01:44:03,782 --> 01:44:07,081
He appeared at the funeral of  the  TV commentator

1387
01:44:07,081 --> 01:44:09,238
Farsuk Karlovich Farseikin,

1388
01:44:09,238 --> 01:44:13,537
who was  strangled  with a yellow skipping rope  in strange circumstances in Sandunovsky baths.

1389
01:44:16,577 --> 01:44:19,886
His slogan for "American Express" became a part of history of advertizing:

1390
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:23,313
"The world is a place where business meets money."

1391
01:44:27,966 --> 01:44:33,233
But  his  very favourite was video  clip for Tuborg,

1392
01:44:33,233 --> 01:44:36,907
the one -  as his  secretary alla used to  say in  a whisper -

1393
01:44:36,907 --> 01:44:40,070
that would bring tears to his eyes,

1394
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:42,353
Clip didn't pass the wow-test,

1395
01:44:42,353 --> 01:44:45,252
and was  never shown on television.

1396
01:44:45,252 --> 01:44:47,185
Stop. I don't like my eyes?

1397
01:44:47,766 --> 01:44:48,921
Why?

1398
01:44:48,921 --> 01:44:51,147
My eyes are not cheerful enough. Do something.

1399
01:44:52,326 --> 01:44:55,550
Oh, that's a different story. And a smile a little bit bigger.

1400
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:58,833
Yeah, bigger. That's it.

1401
01:44:58,833 --> 01:45:01,057
We do not advertise the product,

1402
01:45:01,057 --> 01:45:04,281
we advertise  human happiness.

1403
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:16,100
Life is a solitary journey

1404
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,326
beneath a scorching sun or in then blistering cold.

1405
01:45:19,601 --> 01:45:21,630
Often the road we  walk along leads to nowhere.

1406
01:45:21,630 --> 01:45:24,675
and no one knows where death lies in  wait.

1407
01:45:25,326 --> 01:45:29,441
Remembering this, everything in  the world seems empty and meaningless.

1408
01:45:29,441 --> 01:45:31,937
And  then -  enlightenment.

1409
01:45:33,025 --> 01:45:36,030
Tuborg - be prepared for anything!
