00:16:47,964 --> 00:16:50,131
which is this idea of, "Wait a
minute, you're creating it."

341
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:52,588
-And that was addicting. -Do
you want to play a game?

342
00:16:52,672 --> 00:16:54,505
Sure, let's play
Scrabble, okay?

343
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:56,547
Okay. You want to be
the board or the pieces?

344
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,380
-I'll be the board.
-Robin: Freeze!

345
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:07,089
-Esmeralda, why do you only
visit me on Sunday? -(laughter)

346
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:09,505
The feeling, the rapport
was incredible.

347
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:11,172
The instant meshing
with the audience.

348
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:13,172
It's like sex
without the guilt.

349
00:17:13,256 --> 00:17:15,630
And God created man.

00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:19,880
-I feel better now.
-(laughter)

352
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:23,880

workshop to actually clubs.

I'm too excited!

Squealer, Idaho, to be here.

Valerie Velardi: He was at the
Holy City Zoo, bartending.

358
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:42,547
He filled in as a bartender so that
he could get up on stage and play.

359
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,047
He had
a French accent,

360
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,547
offered me a drink,
chatted me up,

361
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,714

delightful.

for a ride home.

364
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,047
He was speaking French,
I was teasing him,

365
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:03,714
and we had a kiss,

366
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,797
mmm, and I just knew
I was going to see him again.

367
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:11,922
I was just finishing up
my masters degree

368
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:14,089
at Mills College in Dance.

369
00:18:14,172 --> 00:18:15,964
So I was free,

370
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,630
and I was supporting
myself as a waitress.

371
00:18:20,214 --> 00:18:22,714
He was always looking
for a connection,

372
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:27,131
And if he needed to pull out
another character or an accent,

373
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:29,964
he was shameless,
he would just do it.

374
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,505

(normal voice): Some of the
characters people really love.

378
00:18:39,797 --> 00:18:42,256
A character can be a comic
actor more than a comedian.

379
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:46,006
I don't tell jokes. I just use
characters as a vehicle for me,

380
00:18:46,089 --> 00:18:47,797
but I seldom
just talk as myself.

381
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,797
I was his personal audience,

382
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,172

I had moved from Indiana

and went immediately
to The Comedy Store.

399
00:19:45,338 --> 00:19:48,172
Here's what I loved
about California then:

400
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:51,839
Governor Jerry Brown was
dating Linda Ronstadt.

401
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:54,297
That's the California you want.

That's what California
is supposed to be,

403
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,006

We were kids, it was
silly and it was fun,

407
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:13,256
and it was
the best time of my life.

408
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,172
My name is Dave Letterman,

409
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,797
and originally, I am
from the State of Indiana.

410
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,297
And you know,
when I was growing up,

411
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,214
the one thing
that I'll never forget,

412
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:23,256
what I'll always remember
as long as I live,

413
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:26,797
is when Dad used to tease
me with the power tools.

Letterman: When we first
saw Robin on stage,

416
00:20:33,964 --> 00:20:35,214
we were skeptical,

417
00:20:35,297 --> 00:20:38,047
and we made
it kind of a project

418
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,380
to keep our eye on him.

419
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,964
(foreign accent) This is a quick
suppression, a Spanish fly.

In my head,
my first sight of him

426
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,922
was that he could fly

427
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,755
because of the...
the energy.

428
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,922
It was like observing
an experiment.

429
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:03,422
Something special.
First a little toot for me.

430
00:21:03,505 --> 00:21:05,006

Everybody, shake from side
to side, come on, now.

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,047
What's the matter? You would
do it if I was blind.

(mic feedback whines)

437
00:21:21,172 --> 00:21:22,922
(normal voice) One of the
first paying gigs I had

438
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:24,380
was this place called
The Laugh Stop.

439
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:26,256
It's their opening night.

440
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:28,089
The mics go down, they die,

441
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:29,463
and they're going
"What the fuck do we do?"

442
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:30,880
I think,
"I don't need a mic."

443
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:32,380
I just started
fucking around.

444
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:34,422
I'm going
in the audience,

445
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:36,256
and I was loud enough
because I'd been trained

446
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:37,380
to be loud that
I could survive.

447
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,297
I see a sister.

448
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,755

to be healed?

Dear sister,
give me your hand.

452
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:51,131
I hope to God
you're not a real cripple.

453
00:21:51,214 --> 00:21:55,338
All I could really do was hang on
to the microphone for dear life,

454
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:58,006
and here was a guy
who could levitate.

455
00:21:58,089 --> 00:21:59,964
Are you ready now
to walk for Jesus?

456
00:22:00,047 --> 00:22:01,256
Can you do it?

457
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:03,131
Oh my God!
Over here boys!

458
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:04,588
It's incredible!

459
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:07,797
Letterman: We knew that whatever
it was Robin was doing,

460
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,338
we weren't gonna
get close to that.

461
00:22:10,422 --> 00:22:13,172
And we were frightened
that, "Oh my,

462
00:22:13,256 --> 00:22:16,880
"maybe we've come out here
at just exactly the wrong time

463

"when everything was changing,

464
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,505
and all we had was
our stupid little jokes."

465
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,839
Come inside my mind
and see what it's like

466
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:25,172
when a comedian
eats the big one.

467
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,047

comedy and television...

Woman:
Ooh! Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:23:57,089 --> 00:23:58,588
Tramer: Being a writer
for Robin's standup

502
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,839
is like being a pinch
hitter for Barry Bonds.

503
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:02,880
You're not necessarily needed,

504
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:05,505
except for special
circumstances.

505
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:08,256
But it's interesting to see
how he would build a bit.

506
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,297
He had a lightning-fast mind,

507
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,964
but it wasn't like everything
he did came to him that night.

508
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:14,547
There was real work
and preparation.

509
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,588
There was a real thoughtful,
analytical process behind it.

510
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:21,131
It probably took him longer

Who are you?

680
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:27,714
I am Mork from Ork.
Que pasa?

Marshall: The episode, in
front of the live audience,

683
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:38,964
it got a standing ovation.

684
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:41,672
All 300 people stood up
and applauded Robin

685
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:43,755
when he finished
that episode.

686
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:47,630
♪ ♪

687
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:49,755
Robin: ABC has a
commitment to Paramount,

688
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:50,964
and they have
to honor it.

689
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:52,922
If they have a series
that falls out,

690
00:32:53,006 --> 00:32:56,672
they have to put something
on the air from Paramount.

691
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,630
No pilot, just...
you gotta put it on.

692
00:32:58,714 --> 00:33:00,922
And they went, "Oh fuck,"
so they scrambled.

693
00:33:01,006 --> 00:33:02,463
They'd say, "Okay,
we have this character,

694
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:04,131
Mork, which tested very well,"

695
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:06,714
and they had Pam, a series
where she played a nun...

696
00:33:06,797 --> 00:33:08,630
Pam Dawber:
Called Sister Terri,

697
00:33:08,714 --> 00:33:10,131
who had been
a gang leader,

698
00:33:10,214 --> 00:33:11,588
and kind
of talked like this.

699
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:12,630
And she was
a little tough,

700
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:13,797
but she was a nun.

701
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,839
(laughs) And it was terrible.

702
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:19,463
Marshall: My dad took footage
of Pam Dawber from the pilot,

703
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:21,505
in the nun outfit,
cut it together

704
00:33:21,588 --> 00:33:22,797
with Robin
on Happy Days--

705
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,172
just literally
spliced it together...

706
00:33:24,256 --> 00:33:27,131
and that was the pilot.
It was a $63 dollar pilot.

707
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,588
Robin: And they went, "Fine,
whatever, just throw it on the air."

708
00:33:29,672 --> 00:33:32,047
They didn't think it had a
fighting chance of ever living.

709
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:33,839
They're announcing
the fall line up,

710
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:35,922
and it says,
"ABC announces

711
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:40,630
"Mork & Mindy, starring Robin
Williams and Pam Dawber.

713
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:47,463
And I went, "Oh my God!
This sounds terrible.

714
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:50,089
Who is this
Robin Williams anyway?"

715
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,839
Howard Storm: Robin's
manager called Robin.

716
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:58,630
He said, "Robin, we got
22 shows, guaranteed,

717
00:33:58,714 --> 00:34:01,797
and you're gonna
get $1500 a week."

718
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,172
And Robin
went, "Wow!"

719
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:07,922
And then Buddy said,
"Schmuck, $15,000."

720
00:34:08,006 --> 00:34:09,880
(laughs)

721
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,047
Robin was happy
with the $1,500.

722
00:34:12,131 --> 00:34:14,047
He never made
that kind of money.

723

00:34:17,131 --> 00:34:18,089

-(helmet thuds)
-Shazbot!

726
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:33,006
Tramer: Robin was
a little nervous.

727
00:34:33,089 --> 00:34:34,755
"All of that energy
is sure to translate.

728
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,797
"My comedy
is so big, and...

729
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,839
you're sure it'll translate
onto a small screen?"

730
00:34:38,922 --> 00:34:40,047
(whistling)

731
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:42,547
Necrotons! Warning!
Mayday! Mayday!

732
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,672
Red alert! Dive! In the
bunker, in the bunker!

733
00:34:44,755 --> 00:34:47,463
Hit 'em up. We're going to Missouri.
Whoo!

734
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:49,172
Marshall: He would run
around the stage, you know.

735
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:51,630
He would run around and do
crazy things all the time,

736
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,089
and there was
union cameramen.

737
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:55,797
He would do something
great, my dad would go,

738
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,256
"Did you get that?
Did you get that?"

739
00:34:57,338 --> 00:35:00,131
The cameraman would say,
"He didn't come by here."

740
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:02,797
"You gotta capture this.
He's a genius."

741
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,964
And the cameraman said,
"If he's such a genius,

742
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:06,755
he could hit his mark."

743
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,880
And so my dad said, "Wow, this
is... gotta figure this out."

744
00:35:09,964 --> 00:35:13,047
The sitcom, up until then,
always three camera.

745
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,672
So he brought in
a fourth camera,

746
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:16,630
kind of a handheld camera,

747
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,214
just to follow Robin.

748
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:20,547
And that became
the standard.

749
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,922
Now, every sitcom

750
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:23,714
has four cameras now
because of that.

751
00:35:23,797 --> 00:35:26,089
Well, this week, sir,
I learned that on Earth

752
00:35:26,172 --> 00:35:27,797

Tramer: The taping of Mork & Mindy
became like the show to go to.

758
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,797
It was like a three-hour
Robin Williams marathon.

01:04:22,839 --> 01:04:24,547
Robin: I was learning
from him physical comedy

1348
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,006
and just the nuts
and bolts of timing.

1349
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:29,964
Because obviously when I do
my act, I don't have timing.

1350
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:31,964
Oh!

1351
01:04:32,047 --> 01:04:32,922
(audience laughs)

1352
01:04:34,755 --> 01:04:38,588

about the comedy of pause,

1353
01:04:38,672 --> 01:04:39,755
you know,
holding back.

1354
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,714
-Ack!
-Didi! Didi!

1355
01:04:42,797 --> 01:04:44,714

Zone theme music)

1357

1359
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,880

it's definitely theater.

1360
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:55,839
(reporter 2 speaks)

1361
01:04:58,463 --> 01:04:59,922
Martin: I-I... I don't
know how to answer that.

1362
01:05:00,006 --> 01:05:03,714
The differences are
obvious to me.

1363
01:05:03,797 --> 01:05:05,755
And to do this play, it's one
of the most powerful pieces

1364
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:07,422
of literature
in the 20th century.

1365
01:05:07,505 --> 01:05:08,714
I think it kind of helps.

1366
01:05:08,797 --> 01:05:09,839
Martin:
Except for Cruel Shoes.

1367
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:11,047
Cruel Shoes I think was

1368
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:12,797
one of the second most
powerful pieces of literature.

1369
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,380
You know, it really helps
to do something

1370
01:05:14,463 --> 01:05:15,672
that's so amazing,
that every night

1371
01:05:15,755 --> 01:05:18,547
you can do it differently,
but yet it's the same.

1372
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:20,505
You can get deeper
and deeper within this play

1373
01:05:20,588 --> 01:05:22,588
and find things,
every night you can change

1374
01:05:22,672 --> 01:05:24,588
because it's so amazing.

1375
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:25,714
Funny. For me,
I figured it out

1376
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,547
on day one,
and it never changed.

1377
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,006
(laughter)

1378
01:05:32,172 --> 01:05:33,463
Your turn.

1379
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:36,380
You think
God sees me?

1380
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:38,338
You must close
your eyes.

1381
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,505
God, have pity
on me.

1382
01:05:41,588 --> 01:05:42,672
And me.

1383
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:44,422
On me. On me.

1384
01:05:44,505 --> 01:05:45,922
Pity on me!

1385
01:05:46,006 --> 01:05:49,047
His character
was interestingly...

1386
01:05:50,797 --> 01:05:54,047
hurt, and he played it
very vulnerable,

1387
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:56,006
as I think
he was in life too.

1388
01:05:57,672 --> 01:06:01,714
Onstage he was
the master and in charge

1389
01:06:01,797 --> 01:06:04,338
and funny and quick.

1390
01:06:04,422 --> 01:06:06,922
And in life, you know,
he wasn't onstage anymore.

1391
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:09,880
I just felt a little bit of...

1392
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:14,047
I think he was really
comfortable onstage

1393
01:06:14,131 --> 01:06:17,006
and less comfortable offstage.

1394
01:06:18,797 --> 01:06:21,380
Always felt him holding...
holding himself together.

1395
01:06:24,172 --> 01:06:26,089
It was at a time
I think he was...

1396
01:06:27,547 --> 01:06:29,839
clean... and...

1397
01:06:29,922 --> 01:06:33,547
and it was
a very difficult... clean.

1398
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:34,922
You know, it's hard,
it was hard.

1399
01:06:38,214 --> 01:06:40,797
I don't mean that he slipped
or anything like that.

1400
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,047
He didn't. I just think he really
had to concentrate... on that.

1401
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:48,089
There you are. You've become
a reformed alcoholic.

1402
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:49,839
You've got a steaming
glass of Perrier, going,

1403
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:53,422
"I feel so much better
about myself! God damn it."

1404
01:06:54,797 --> 01:06:57,505
"I feel really healthy now!
(laughs)

1405
01:06:57,588 --> 01:06:58,839
"No, go ahead,
have your cocktail.

1406
01:06:58,922 --> 01:07:00,588
"I'll be over in the
corner hurting the cat.

1407
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:05,839
(maniacal laugh)
Oh God damn!"

1408

whose minds work faster than yours?

01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,422
Robin: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm
starting to meet them.

1411
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:18,172
Oliver Sacks, playing
him in Awakenings.

1412
01:07:18,256 --> 01:07:19,297
Man:
Right.

1413
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:20,672
Robin: He's such a
compassionate man,

1414
01:07:20,755 --> 01:07:21,964
and the idea
of treating the brain

1415
01:07:22,047 --> 01:07:24,006
as a subjective subject.

1416
01:07:24,089 --> 01:07:26,131
This is the idea
of the brain

1417
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:28,089
can be one thing and then
the other simultaneously.

1418
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:32,964
What about this?

1419
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:34,588
(laughs) What do you mean, this?

1420
01:07:34,672 --> 01:07:35,755
It's a strobe.

1421
01:07:36,797 --> 01:07:38,047
You're wrong.

1422
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:40,214
All of this before
is the strobe.

1423
01:07:40,297 --> 01:07:41,964
This is me saying
his name to him.

1424
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:47,463
Excuse me.

1425
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:54,047
Robin: Oliver is
someone who thinks

1426
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:55,964
on... on levels that
I've never dreamed of.

1427
01:08:01,131 --> 01:08:03,714
Man: He introduced you to a guy with
Tourette's syndrome named Shane.

1428
01:08:03,797 --> 01:08:05,964
It had a profound
influence on you.

1429
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:07,422
Robin:
Definitely.

1430
01:08:07,505 --> 01:08:08,922
I-I began-began
touching-touching,

1431
01:08:09,006 --> 01:08:10,131
you know,
touching-touching things.

1432
01:08:10,214 --> 01:08:12,047
You know, touching,
you know. (shouts)

1433
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:14,089
Robin: Here's a disease
that basically makes you

1434
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:16,755
do, physically, things
you have no control over.

1435
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:20,672
Along with it comes this
incredible mental acceleration,

1436
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:22,797
lets you think faster
than most people.

1437
01:08:29,297 --> 01:08:30,172
Pardon me?

1438
01:08:30,256 --> 01:08:31,547
Oh yeah, sure.

1439
01:08:34,338 --> 01:08:35,672
Robin: And the price you pay is

1440
01:08:35,755 --> 01:08:37,089
that you can't control
a lot of those movements.

1441
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:39,922
The complexity and
the total unpredictability

1442
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:42,172
of the human brain, that's what
I learned from meeting Shane.

1443
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,672
The brain is one thing that
controls bodily functions,

1444
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:51,006
and then there's this other thing
which is divine, called the mind.

1445
01:08:51,089 --> 01:08:53,672
There is deity within you,
there is that... that spark,

1446
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:56,214
that divine thing,
that thing that is soul.

1447
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,880
And that's what's exciting,

1448
01:09:00,964 --> 01:09:03,338
the idea you could explore
creativity at any price

1449
01:09:03,422 --> 01:09:05,089
is like... this is what
we're kind of dealing with

1450
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:08,256
as artists, comedians,
writers, actors.

1451
01:09:08,338 --> 01:09:09,714
You're going
to come to the edge,

1452
01:09:09,797 --> 01:09:10,964
you're going to look over,
and sometimes

1453
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:12,338
you're going to step
over the edge,

1454
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:13,922
and then you're going
to come back, hopefully.

McLaurin: Robin could
never let go of a role.

1462
01:09:31,047 --> 01:09:32,880
He would become
the role he was playing,

1463
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:34,588
and then it'd become

1464
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:37,797

1516
01:11:45,214 --> 01:11:47,797
you went to work, you did
what you needed to do,

1517

1518
01:11:50,588 --> 01:11:53,964

not leaving me in the dust.

01:11:54,047 --> 01:11:56,256
I'm going to be right here,
right next to you, running."

to play and keep up.

Romanek:
The urge to be funny

1656
01:18:49,922 --> 01:18:53,214
and to make people laugh
was so innate in him

1657
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:56,463
and so, like... almost
like breathing for him

1658
01:18:56,547 --> 01:18:59,630
that if he didn't get
that out of his system...

1659
01:18:59,714 --> 01:19:02,839
it would've infected his
performance in a bad way.

-(man chuckles)
-Hi.

1665
01:19:13,172 --> 01:19:15,588
Romanek: So I would just let him
go, as long as it was reasonable

1666
01:19:15,672 --> 01:19:17,214
for time in the day

1667
01:19:17,297 --> 01:19:18,505
to just get
it out of his system.

1668
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:19,880
And then,
actually, I realized

1669
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:22,297
that when he makes
people laugh that hard,

1670
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:23,672
he used to kind
of get high from it...

1671
01:19:23,755 --> 01:19:25,797
you know, like an endorphin
rush or something.

1672
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:29,922
And so if he was being really
funny one second before the take,

1673
01:19:30,006 --> 01:19:31,922
I would... he would,
you know, quiet down,

1674
01:19:32,006 --> 01:19:33,380
and I'd say, "Action,"

1675
01:19:33,463 --> 01:19:36,297
he almost had
this like glow of joy.

1676
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:38,714
Even though he was playing
this very serious scene,

1677
01:19:38,797 --> 01:19:41,422
that also kind of gave
this patina of weirdness

1678
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:43,297
