1
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,405
...who took care
of those around him.

2
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:40,243
And l know that
in this time of sadness,

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,478
he would have been glad,
to know of the support

4
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,486
that his friends
have provided.

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,284
Those who are here...

6
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,290
A friend of yours?

7
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:54,623
A customer.
Well, ex-customer.

8
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,027
Oh.

9
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:59,031
How old was he?

10
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,033
43.

11
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:04,195
43? That's young.

12
00:02:04,237 --> 00:02:06,205
What did he die of?

13
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,231
Blue ice.

14
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:12,803
Blue ice?
What is that then, blue ice?

15
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:16,111
He was sitting in his car
outside a warehouse

16
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,117
at Heathrow Airport

17
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:22,611
when this great big chunk of ice,
the size of a refrigerator,

18
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,318
broke off a jumbo-jet
toilet compartment

19
00:02:25,358 --> 00:02:28,327
and crashed straight through
the roof of his Jaguar.

20
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:30,295
Stone dead.

21
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,161
Oh.

22
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,167
You're joking!

23
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,328
Would l be joking
stood out here,

24
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,837
£20 out for a wreath?

25
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:42,569
43? That's tragic.

26
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:45,510
Not really.
He was a violent bastard.

27
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:47,513
The only reason
he was at the airport,

28
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:49,538
he was planning
a cargo heist.

29
00:02:49,583 --> 00:02:52,450
...the Son
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

30
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:57,252
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Harry.

31
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,757
You all right, luv?

32
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,760
Thank you for making it.

33
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,160
- Sorry about this.
- All right, mate.

34
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,901
Say, you was having me on,
wasn't ya?

35
00:03:14,941 --> 00:03:16,704
No.

36
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:22,715
''Waltham Stoneman
dies in freak accident.''

37
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:26,879
'''Blue ice nothing
to panic about,'

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,380
says airline spokesperson.''

39
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:34,985
- Oh, dear.
- You never know, do you?

40
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:36,996
Out of a clear sky,

41
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,464
bang.

42
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,467
lt doesn't bear
thinking about.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,615
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me, Kyle.

44
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,086
- l told you not to call.
- Listen, don't hang up!

45
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,645
lt's-- it's important, okay?

46
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:55,667
l don't need to see you.

47
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,234
l just want you to take
something down for me, okay?

48
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:00,838
Just hurry up, okay?
l haven't got much time.

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,180
X-P-L-A...

50
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:07,618
- Kyle--
- Yeah, just take it down.

51
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:10,088
C-l-F...

52
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:14,958
Refer number: CVH-7 43.

53
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:31,873
l do not believe this!

54
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,484
Look what you've done
to my bloody car!

55
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,250
What do you want me to do?

56
00:05:48,294 --> 00:05:51,195
l might have known, a woman driver
talking on her bloody car phone.

57
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,729
Kyle...

58
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,465
Kyle?

59
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:00,473
Jeez.

60
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,475
Hello?

61
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:04,739
Kyle, are you there?

62
00:06:06,613 --> 00:06:07,875
Kyle?

63
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,614
Finished our call now,
have we?

64
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:17,316
Can l help you?

65
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:19,723
Help me?
You've just destroyed my bloody car!

66
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,455
You see that?
That is a traffic light.

67
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:25,862
And when it turns red,
that means that the car in front of you

68
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,867
is going to stop!

69
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:29,869
- Are you hurt?
- Hurt? Oh!

70
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,463
Apart from whiplash
and a few broken ribs, l'm fine.

71
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:35,201
lt seems to me
the dent in my fender

72
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:38,233
cancels out your rear
broken lamp, so we're even.

73
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:40,576
- Even?!
- Bye.

74
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,516
Right!

75
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,663
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

76
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,665
Oh, hello!

77
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,667
lt's you again.

78
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,295
Let's say we look
at the damage you claim l did.

79
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,665
Fine.

80
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,044
See?

81
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:47,046
lt's just a nick!

82
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,640
The bumper's been buckled,
the brakelight's smashed,

83
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,479
the exhaust is split.

84
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:53,986
- lt will still go, won't it?
- Go? Of course it will go.

85
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,319
Well, l know you are
going to tell me-- Mister...?

86
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:58,984
Anders.
Harry Anders.

87
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:01,960
Well, Mr. Anders,
are you going to let me buy you off?

88
00:08:01,995 --> 00:08:04,463
- The correct course of action--
- Oh, dear!

89
00:08:04,497 --> 00:08:07,091
The bore-me-
with-procedure type.

90
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:11,331
l can't do it that way. The person who
owns that car would be very upset.

91
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:14,101
Oh, the person who owns
that car would be upset?

92
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,904
The person who owns this car
is bloody furious!

93
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,571
Mr. Anders,
my name is Stacy.

94
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,705
Would you like
to buy me a drink?

95
00:08:23,116 --> 00:08:24,583
Why would l do that?

96
00:08:24,617 --> 00:08:26,812
lf this argument's
going to be a long one,

97
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,878
l'd rather be somewhere
a little warmer.

98
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,652
Yeah.

99
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:34,023
lt's been a chilly
afternoon, hasn't it?

100
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,219
lf you send me the bill,
l'll pay for all the damages.

101
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:41,392
This guy you are involved with,
the one who owns the car,

102
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,629
are you that
frightened of him?

103
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,729
Nobody is frightened of Lewis.

104
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,797
He's a sweetheart.
lt's just that

105
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,036
it isn't exactly
my first accident.

106
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:53,011
And what does
''sweetheart'' do?

107
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,173
Goes to parties,
tells okay jokes,

108
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,513
and does what any
good diplomat does.

109
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,711
Diplomat? Oh.

110
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,152
l have a little problem
with diplomats.

111
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,817
Me and the Vienna Convention
have a few miles on the clock.

112
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,259
You don't seem like
the Foreign Office type.

113
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:11,058
l was...

114
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:13,998
sort of foreign office.

115
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,593
Refill?

116
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,206
You must know the owner
of this place pretty well.

117
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,676
You could say that.
He's a wonderful guy.

118
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,680
You?

119
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:32,811
l pay the bills,
and l get the headaches.

120
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:34,820
lt's the music
you really love, right?

121
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:37,322
A little blues,
or soul maybe?

122
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:39,325
- Jazz.
- Perfect!

123
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,656
Go on.

124
00:09:41,995 --> 00:09:43,963
You don't make much money,

125
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:47,330
and the apartment upstairs
has a kitchen that's... too small,

126
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,426
and a bedroom
that's too big.

127
00:09:49,469 --> 00:09:52,165
But after all the headaches
it's the one place

128
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:54,435
you value more than
anything else in the world.

129
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,705
l knew a girl like you once.

130
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,712
And l felt the same way about her

131
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:02,909
as l feel about you.

132
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:05,884
l didn't know whether
to love her or hate her.

133
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,978
So what did you do?

134
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,852
A little of both.

135
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:14,159
Evening, Harry.

136
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:17,253
- A little early, aren't you?
- Hi, Buddy.

137
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,765
That's Buddy,
the jazz piano player.

138
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:22,666
This is his rehearsal time.

139
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:25,637
He's a very bad
piano player.

140
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:28,300
lf he had a work permit
they'd kick him out of the country

141
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:30,309
but he doesn't,
so l'm stuck with him.

142
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:34,712
# Some day, we'll be
close together #

143
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:36,715
# Wait and see #

144
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:41,152
# Oh, by the way #

145
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:45,749
# This time
the dream's on me... #

146
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:49,455
- l'd better go.
- lf you go, you'll miss great jazz.

147
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:54,626
# And you look at me
adoringly... #

148
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:57,295
Stay.

149
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:59,703
# This time the dream's
on me. #

150
00:11:23,396 --> 00:11:25,489
Here you are, sir.

151
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:05,867
You really do love it,
don't you?

152
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:08,237
There are easier ways
of making a living.

153
00:12:08,274 --> 00:12:10,640
But jazz clubs are special.

154
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,803
l've got High Court judges
sitting out there,

155
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:16,008
alongside some of the worst
villains in London--

156
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,916
lords, hookers.

157
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:22,352
There's a guy over there
who drives a refuse truck.

158
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:24,686
There's a Chinese man
with one leg.

159
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:27,352
What do they all
have in common?

160
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:30,726
Loving jazz, like l do.

161
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,227
Tea leaf's been in again,
Mr. Anders.

162
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,428
Cleaned out three handbags
and a gent's wallet.

163
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:40,030
- Not now, George.
- All right, all right.

164
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,169
- What's a tea leaf?
- Thief.

165
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:46,678
Cockney rhyming slang.

166
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,579
Trouble and strife, wife.
Apples and pears, stairs.

167
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,379
So what are you going to do
with this tea leaf when you find him?

168
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:55,819
- Break his dairy farm.
- Arm.

169
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,922
Excuse me.
A bit of a squabble.

170
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,324
All right, lads, that'll do.

171
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,065
All right, leave the furniture
out of this.

172
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:20,169
How many times have l got to ban you
before you start taking me--

173
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:30,650
Shit!

174
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,558
You went for the stomach,
Harry. That's risky.

175
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:37,062
Hit a man in the chin
and he'll go down.

176
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,064
That's what my dad
used to say.

177
00:13:39,098 --> 00:13:41,965
Your dad was right, but Ronnie
is a steady customer,

178
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:44,731
and you never hit
a steady customer in the face.

179
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,432
They don't come back
till their bruises are gone.

180
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,247
Do you like
all music, Harry?

181
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,944
- Some of it.
- Classical music?

182
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:01,351
Everything
except Schoenberg.

183
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,288
Schoenberg always struck me
as being a bit of a wanker.

184
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,096
l'll be in touch.

185
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:25,443
Bye.

186
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:49,165
Hm, looks a bit fancy, Harry.

187
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:51,170
Opera, the Covent Garden.

188
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:54,935
Opera? Not exactly
your speed, Harry. Who's it from?

189
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:57,204
You're beginning to sound
like my mum, George.

190
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,302
Don't be ridiculous.

191
00:15:00,746 --> 00:15:02,577
Don't be too late
coming home, dear.

192
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,129
You're late.

193
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,873
But on account of that dress,
l'm prepared to forgive you.

194
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,706
Shh-hh.

195
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,583
Don't you just
love the opera, Harry?

196
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:52,155
You could say
l enjoyed it for the spectacle.

197
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,361
So where are we
going to eat?

198
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,995
l think l know just the place.

199
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:00,005
Wonderful ambiance,

200
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,666
great food...

201
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,470
Will it still be open?

202
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:05,443
24 hours a day.

203
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,082
How much longer?

204
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:13,279
l'd say about 14...

205
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,583
minutes.

206
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,623
l don't know how anyone
has the patience for cooking.

207
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,596
l can't handle
all that waiting.

208
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,031
Waiting, Stacy, is the key.

209
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,126
l remember my old man
used to say,

210
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:33,002
''Harry,'' he'd say,

211
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,634
''waiting is what cooking
is all about.

212
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:39,304
The longer you wait,

213
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:42,075
the better it tastes.''

214
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:49,020
l have a feeling
you're a wonderful cook, Harry.

215
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:51,649
l never met a man
who enjoyed waiting before.

216
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:11,172
Of course, a lot of what
my old man told me was crap.

217
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:56,712
You know what you are, Stacy?

218
00:17:56,756 --> 00:17:59,589
You're blue ice.

219
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,820
Blue ice?
What's blue ice?

220
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:04,830
lt's when--

221
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:07,697
it's when
something unexpected

222
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,169
and wonderful falls on you
out of a clear blue sky...

223
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:13,535
and changes your life.

224
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,699
What a great image.

225
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,506
You know something?

226
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:21,308
You are a very interesting
person, Harry.

227
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:24,316
- lnteresting?
- Yeah.

228
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,079
Very.

229
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:29,781
Parachute Regiment?

230
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:32,518
Military lntelligence?

231
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,085
Northern lreland,
Middle East, Eastern Europe.

232
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:39,586
And in 1982...

233
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,623
compulsory retirement.

234
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:45,034
Should l be flattered?

235
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,937
Or do you do this much
research on everyone?

236
00:18:47,973 --> 00:18:51,704
l have to be careful who l get
involved with, don't l?

237
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:59,215
You were a spy,
weren't you, Harry?

238
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,878
l adore you, Stacy.

239
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,888
And if l lie here long enough,

240
00:19:02,922 --> 00:19:06,085
l'd probably tell you everything
about my life anyway.

241
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:09,720
But l don't like you digging
in the nooks and crannies of my past.

242
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:13,654
Why did they fire you?

243
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:16,259
The Czech agent
broke the rules,

244
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,793
he hurt the wife
of one of my sources.

245
00:19:18,838 --> 00:19:21,329
They asked me to ignore it.
l couldn't.

246
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,867
So what happened?

247
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,811
l took him up onto the roof
of my office building.

248
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:32,412
- And?
- The Czech bounced.

249
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,617
l get a refill, please?

250
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,122
Hi.

251
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,036
Give me an hour, Harry,
and then we can sneak away.

252
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,198
l have to introduce some people
to the American Ambassador.

253
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,208
Of course you do.
l'll tell you what,

254
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:32,210
why don't l say hello?

255
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,644
lt's been a long time
since l've met an ambassador.

256
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,648
- You want to?
- Sure.

257
00:20:36,682 --> 00:20:38,343
Okay.

258
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,819
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye.

259
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,824
Lewis, this is Harry Anders,

260
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,758
owner of the best
jazz club in London.

261
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,818
l heard all about you, Harry.

262
00:20:49,862 --> 00:20:54,629
ln my college days l used to play
a little jazz myself-- soprano sax.

263
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:57,431
Bechet.
Sidney Bechet, he was my hero.

264
00:20:57,469 --> 00:20:59,994
Best soprano sax
player ever.

265
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:02,769
Harry, this is Lewis Mansdorf,
my husband.

266
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:04,639
Oh.

267
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:06,611
We seem to have
the same tastes, Harry.

268
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:08,875
Like minds, eh?

269
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:10,711
Great to meet you.

270
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:13,047
Now l gotta go and do
some gripping and greeting.

271
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:15,053
Please excuse me.

272
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,030
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

273
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:28,397
- You never asked.
- He knows about us.

274
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,402
He does and he doesn't.

275
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:32,404
He chooses
what he wants to know.

276
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,407
l am having an affair with the wife
of the American Ambassador.

277
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,739
l could wind up
in the Tower of London for this!

278
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:40,939
Wouldn't l be worth it?

279
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,813
Oh, no...

280
00:21:43,849 --> 00:21:45,248
What?

281
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,411
Oh, no!

282
00:21:47,453 --> 00:21:49,819
l don't like that look, Harry.

283
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,756
That gloopy look.

284
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,850
Don't go soft on me, please.

285
00:21:56,595 --> 00:21:58,085
Now what the hell
is ''gloopy''?

286
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,759
You don't fool me.
l know men like you, remember?

287
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,768
All that tough-guy talk,

288
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:06,236
and scar tissue
on the outside,

289
00:22:06,271 --> 00:22:08,398
and hopeless romantics
on the inside.

290
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:11,576
Well...

291
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,410
it's nice to know that you have
such a high opinion of me.

292
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:17,415
lt isn't that.

293
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:20,475
This has to be
strictly temporary, okay?

294
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,249
Mm-hm.

295
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,722
Strictly Temporary
is my middle name.

296
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,128
Lovely steak today!
l've got some lovely steak!

297
00:22:36,168 --> 00:22:37,795
Good morning, Harry.

298
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:39,804
Harry, l want to
ask you something.

299
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:43,740
l have a problem, l think, but l don't
know if l should involve you.

300
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:46,540
How fresh?

301
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:48,546
Today's catch, Harry.

302
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,775
You wouldn't try
to con me, would you, Marvin?

303
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,943
This sea-bass died
of old age.

304
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,884
- Are you in trouble, Stacy?
- Maybe.

305
00:22:57,923 --> 00:22:59,891
Trouble is
my middle name.

306
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,917
l thought ''strictly temporary''
was your middle name.

307
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,589
ln England, we're very big
on middle names.

308
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:07,258
Tell me what
your problem is.

309
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,099
When Lewis and l came here,
l had an affair with an American.

310
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:14,628
He took the relationship
much more seriously than l did.

311
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,971
He started writing
these crazy letters, and--

312
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,204
l'm afraid the tabloids
might get ahold of one

313
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:21,576
and make it really
difficult for Lewis.

314
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:23,979
You want me to find this guy
and have a chat with him?

315
00:23:24,016 --> 00:23:26,541
Well, no. l want you to find him
so l can talk with him.

316
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:32,618
You know, my fee
may be beyond your means.

317
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:37,425
l'm a very wealthy woman,
Mr. Anders.

318
00:23:37,463 --> 00:23:39,829
l'm still gonna require
a down payment.

319
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:11,726
l drew a blank
with the lmmigration people.

320
00:24:11,764 --> 00:24:14,790
Nobody of that name through
Passport Control in the past six weeks.

321
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:19,270
l checked the Special Branch
watch list. Nothing doing there either.

322
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:22,831
You and l should have
a word with the Yanks.

323
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,309
l know some of their
security people at the Embassy.

324
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,312
l don't think so, Ozzie.

325
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:29,473
This has got to be handled
with some finesse.

326
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:32,245
And finesse is not
one of their strong points.

327
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:35,276
Well, l do have an in
with a Fraud Squad guy

328
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,948
who works the credit card
beat, eh?

329
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,653
lf your man's in London, chances
are he's using genuine plastic.

330
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,628
Even if he's bought himself
a new passport.

331
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:48,360
Well, that sounds good.
Let's try that then.

332
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,960
Only it's, uh, 300 every time.

333
00:24:51,003 --> 00:24:53,972
Well, he's got to pay off
computer people.

334
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:56,873
lt's highly not legal.

335
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,605
What's the commission
on your favors these days, Ozzie?

336
00:24:59,645 --> 00:25:02,409
- Eh?
- Still 30%, is it?

337
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:04,415
Or have you
pushed it up to 50?

338
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,417
l wouldn't cheat you, Harry.

339
00:25:06,451 --> 00:25:08,419
l hate taking your money.

340
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,114
l know, Ozzie.

341
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:12,123
You're a good old pal.

342
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:20,757
Oy! Oy!
Busted. Come here!

343
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,098
Harry, we got him.
We got the tea leaf.

344
00:25:24,136 --> 00:25:26,195
Bastard!
Come here!

345
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:29,503
Watch your backs.
Stand away, luv.

346
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:36,781
Oy, you!

347
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:39,613
Don't be alarmed, that's just
part of the entertainment.

348
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:47,655
lt's a mistake!

349
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:50,287
lt's not what you think, Harry.
Honest it ain't.

350
00:25:50,329 --> 00:25:53,492
What do you prefer, Westy,
playing cards or playing football?

351
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:55,693
lf it's cards,
l'm gonna break your leg,

352
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:58,430
if it's football,
l'm gonna break your arm.

353
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,734
- Leg or arm?
- Harry?

354
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:02,672
- What?
- l got the old Bill on the phone.

355
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:05,074
- Tell him to wait.
- The bloke says it's urgent.

356
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,907
Name of Osgood.

357
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:10,409
This is your lucky day,
Westy.

358
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:12,417
Let him go.

359
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:27,860
- Are you sure it's him?
- Close it comes as will be.

360
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,926
lt's the Villa Venetia,
Critchley line.

361
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:32,937
Southeast London.

362
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:34,939
He likes it here.

363
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:37,771
He's used his card four times
in the past 10 days.

364
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,777
The maitre d'
eyeballed him for me.

365
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:42,279
Stay on him.
l'll be there in 20 minutes.

366
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:53,883
- Hello?
- Write this down.

367
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:55,894
The Critchley Hotel,

368
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:58,988
station approach,
Southeast London.

369
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:00,999
- Near London Bridge.
- You found him.

370
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:03,194
Write it down, Stacy.

371
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:06,068
''Critchley Hotel,

372
00:27:06,104 --> 00:27:08,698
station approach, near...

373
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,708
London Bridge.''

374
00:27:10,742 --> 00:27:13,506
What do you
want me to do?

375
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:15,672
Just make sure
he doesn't leave.

376
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,477
l'll be there as soon as l can.

377
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,831
Hello, Ozzie.

378
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:36,390
Christ, Harry.
l never saw you coming.

379
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:38,403
You must have been
a good spook in your day.

380
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:40,405
James bloody Bond, mate.

381
00:27:40,439 --> 00:27:42,304
Which one is he?

382
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:45,469
That's him-- good-looking kid
sitting on his own there.

383
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,035
There's gonna be
no rough stuff, is there, Harry?

384
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,173
l did this as a favor,
you know, off-duty.

385
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:52,445
You did this
for the 300 quid, Ozzie,

386
00:27:52,484 --> 00:27:54,714
so don't give me
the Good Samaritan stuff.

387
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:06,161
That's the sort of place
where defrocked vicars

388
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,792
take young boys
and hang themselves after.

389
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:16,129
Keep an eye on him, Ozzie.
l wanna make a phone call.

390
00:28:56,181 --> 00:28:57,808
Ozzie?

391
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:00,147
Ozzie!

392
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:51,429
Shit.

393
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:21,963
Osgood?

394
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:29,664
Osgood!

395
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,551
Jesus Christ!

396
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:29,423
Come on!

397
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,835
Fuck.

398
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:42,472
Critchley Hotel.

399
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:01,265
Want some milk
in that, mate?

400
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,994
A lot of milk.

401
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:08,167
Cheers.

402
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:14,571
You are in a world
of trouble, my friend.

403
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:17,081
l haven't done anything.

404
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,447
l've told you,
Ozzie was an old pal.

405
00:32:19,484 --> 00:32:21,679
lf l thought--

406
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,951
l don't know who the American guy was. l
know nothing about him.

407
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,958
- So who does?
- l wanna help you--

408
00:32:26,992 --> 00:32:30,428
You'd better had, friend, or you're
gonna get a smack in the gums.

409
00:32:30,462 --> 00:32:32,657
Ozzie was a cop.
He was one of us.

410
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,665
No offense, fellas...

411
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:36,997
but l'd feel a lot
more comfortable

412
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:39,230
talking about this
at a higher level.

413
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:40,795
Nothing personal.

414
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:43,239
l don't smoke,

415
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:45,004
l don't drink,

416
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:47,568
l don't particularly
like women.

417
00:32:47,612 --> 00:32:49,375
My primary pleasure

418
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:52,679
is writing my name on people's foreheads
with a baseball bat.

419
00:33:05,797 --> 00:33:07,765
Let's go through
this again, Anders.

420
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,767
Who were you
working for?

421
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,929
For the last time,
l wasn't working for anybody.

422
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,461
l was doing a favor
for a lady.

423
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:16,531
Oh, yeah-- the wife
of the American Ambassador.

424
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:18,804
And if l thought she had
anything to do with it--

425
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:20,834
You'd do what?
Kill her too?

426
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:23,746
- l didn't kill anyone.
- You're lying.

427
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,272
l am telling you the truth.

428
00:33:25,317 --> 00:33:28,343
How come when we checked
with the American Embassy, they said

429
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:31,822
they'd never heard of you, and told us
the American Ambassador's wife

430
00:33:31,856 --> 00:33:35,053
had been in Paris
since yesterday evening?

431
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:37,857
- They're lying.
- Oh, they're lying.

432
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:40,091
- The American Embassy is lying?
- Mm-hm.

433
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:42,861
Not the crooked cheapskate
club owner who's found

434
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:46,860
with the copper's blood
all over his hands. Oh, no.

435
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:49,601
You're allergic
to the truth, Anders.

436
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:51,609
Lock him up.

437
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,611
We'll do this the hard way.

438
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:56,136
Open up.

439
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,696
Oy, you. Out!

440
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,234
Morning, Officers.
What a beautiful day!

441
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:23,069
l don't know who you've
got pulling strings for you, Anders.

442
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:25,099
But this isn't over.

443
00:34:26,678 --> 00:34:28,646
l hate to see
an unhappy policeman.

444
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,648
l admire you.
Straight up, l do.

445
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:32,650
You've got big balls.

446
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:35,778
l couldn't put all my money
into a place like yours.

447
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,812
l'd be worried about
fire safety inspections,

448
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:42,054
keeping my drinks license,
drug busts,

449
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,721
add in a rap for letting
hookers use the place

450
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:46,822
in-between clients.

451
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,191
Now look what you've done.

452
00:34:51,236 --> 00:34:54,205
You've frightened me so much,
l'm spilling my tea.

453
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:07,082
# Don't worry about me #

454
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:08,779
# l get along... #

455
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,118
How many more people
have l got to tell?

456
00:35:11,156 --> 00:35:13,420
Anders, Harry Anders.

457
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,926
Mrs. Mansdorf is
not available--

458
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,928
lt's important.
l have to talk to her.

459
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:21,398
l'm sorry, sir, but she is
currently out of the country.

460
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,765
This is bullshit!

461
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,909
Afternoon.

462
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,538
l'm looking for the body
of one Kyle Belamy.

463
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:25,818
That's it.
Let's get out of here.

464
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:34,490
Thanks.

465
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:41,965
Stay close, stay close.

466
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:45,436
Oh, you shit! Move!

467
00:37:45,476 --> 00:37:48,104
Down! Get in!
Get the car rolling! Move!

468
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:57,687
Go! l said go!

469
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,556
Go go go!

470
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,898
Take the gap!
Take the gap!

471
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,803
Don't fight it.

472
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,867
Right, now go.
Reverse.

473
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,779
An eye for an eye.

474
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:32,513
That's it.
Keep moving.

475
00:39:02,186 --> 00:39:05,451
You sack of sweatin' soft git!

476
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,015
He's just tried to kill you!

477
00:39:08,059 --> 00:39:10,721
Blow his face off! Kill him!

478
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,601
That's it. Well done.

479
00:39:19,604 --> 00:39:22,004
Can we have
a tea break, guv?

480
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,735
Yeah yeah, fine.

481
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:26,573
- All right, fellas!
- Bring those two over here.

482
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:29,239
Tea break!

483
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,181
All right, lads,
that's an all clear.

484
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:36,109
A foreign banker in Brazil

485
00:39:36,154 --> 00:39:39,123
is a very tempting target
for a kidnapper,

486
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:41,785
or a sickero from the favelas.

487
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:43,794
lf you don't get better,

488
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:47,025
you'll have a very short career
and come home in a wooden box.

489
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:51,358
Go and have a cup of tea.

490
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,099
Thank God the world
is full of bad guys, eh, Harry?

491
00:39:58,142 --> 00:40:00,110
l'd never pay the rent
if they weren't.

492
00:40:00,144 --> 00:40:02,112
Hello, Garcia.
How are you?

493
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:03,773
l'm all right. And you?

494
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:05,783
Yeah, l'm fine.

495
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:08,285
Maybe l went into the wrong business
when l came out.

496
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,116
Yeah, you wanna swap?

497
00:40:10,154 --> 00:40:11,985
l'll have a nightclub any day.

498
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:15,083
You try teaching nervous businessmen to
be Machine Gun Kelly.

499
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:22,032
The hardest thing is teaching them
the killer instinct.

500
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:24,034
l had a problem with that.

501
00:40:24,068 --> 00:40:26,798
You? Leave off!

502
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,069
You were one of the rare ones--
always had it, you were born with it.

503
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,076
Maybe, maybe not.

504
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,273
- Have you got five minutes?
- Yeah. Here, come in here.

505
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:41,982
He wired an alarm system
into his hotel room

506
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:43,953
so he wouldn't
be taken by surprise.

507
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:46,923
- Either he knew the killer--
- Or he thought he could trust him.

508
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,825
- Or her.
- You think the woman's involved?

509
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:53,524
l don't know yet. l phoned her
that night, but she didn't show up.

510
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:56,089
Obviously got mixed up
in something very dodgy.

511
00:40:56,134 --> 00:40:58,432
Or somebody
you'd recognize again.

512
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:03,332
lt doesn't look very good
for the lady, Harry.

513
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:05,706
lt doesn't, does it?

514
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,711
The police were told to lay off?

515
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,736
They faked the inquest.

516
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:12,477
The body bag sent direct
to the United States,

517
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:15,145
courtesy of the U.S. Army.
lt's gotta be a spook, Harry.

518
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:17,620
Nobody else could pull
strings like that.

519
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:19,953
Do you know anyone
in the American Embassy?

520
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:21,788
Are you kidding?

521
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:24,693
l've got contacts
in the Secret Service, the ClA,

522
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:27,698
the N.S.A., the D.E.A., the l.R.S.,
Tobacco and Firearms,

523
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:30,929
and a few organizations
l don't even know the initials of.

524
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:33,198
Find out who it was,
and l'll take it from there.

525
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:35,705
- What, just like that?
- Yeah.

526
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,367
Harry Anders,

527
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:39,774
10 years retired and still
looking for trouble?

528
00:41:39,811 --> 00:41:42,837
You think l'm rusty?

529
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,440
lt's been a long time, pal.
Here.

530
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,816
Let's see if l remember.

531
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:52,477
Dropped a stitch.

532
00:42:57,488 --> 00:42:59,615
lf the nightclub
don't work out, Harry,

533
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,750
maybe you come see me, huh?

534
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,460
Great.

535
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,939
- What do you think of them?
- Looking good, Harry.

536
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:23,606
- Great.
- Good, huh? Don't you think?

537
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:28,050
- Hi, Joe.
- Hello, Harry.

538
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:38,662
Excuse me.

539
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:40,994
Um, the name is Stevens.

540
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:44,660
Um, you're Harry Anders,
aren't you?

541
00:43:44,702 --> 00:43:47,227
Yeah. Have you been
here before?

542
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:50,206
Oh, yeah. Not as often
as l'd have liked.

543
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,675
- Join me in a whiskey?
- Sure.

544
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,283
- Do you like them?
- Yep.

545
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,118
The horn player's a bit rusty.
He keeps missing the bridge.

546
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:08,191
He'll warm up.

547
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,557
He always starts a bit tame.

548
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,590
You seem to know
your music, Mr. Stevens.

549
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:17,931
l've got a set of...

550
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:20,335
Kid Ory's 1921 recordings
on the Sunshine label.

551
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:23,636
As far as l know it's the only full set
in the whole of England.

552
00:44:23,674 --> 00:44:25,938
The San Francisco sessions?

553
00:44:25,977 --> 00:44:29,572
Yeah! Yeah, including
''Society Blues,'' yeah.

554
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:32,411
l am impressed.

555
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:40,013
Like a code, isn't it? Music.

556
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:42,025
Especially jazz.

557
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:44,357
You take the notes of the tune
and you change them

558
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:46,363
according to
the rules of jazz.

559
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,365
Stride piano, say.

560
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:50,367
And you hope
that the message,

561
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:53,427
the... melody still
comes through.

562
00:44:53,471 --> 00:44:56,133
lt comes through if you
know how to decode it.

563
00:44:56,173 --> 00:44:59,370
For which you have to know
how to listen, what to look out for.

564
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:09,151
Which is what happens
in life sometimes, isn't it?

565
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:12,747
Something happens-- puzzling
because you don't have the key.

566
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,816
You don't know the rules
of what jazz it is that they're playing,

567
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,987
so the music doesn't
seem to make sense.

568
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:20,224
You can't figure out
what's going on.

569
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:24,526
lt's just noise.

570
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,399
Who sent you?

571
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:35,108
To find that out, Mr. Anders, you just
have to follow the music, won't you?

572
00:46:00,438 --> 00:46:02,497
l'm sorry, sir.
He's busy at the moment.

573
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,907
l don't care how busy he is, pal!

574
00:46:05,943 --> 00:46:08,639
Get him! lt's a priority.

575
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,979
No no, he's gone now, sir.
Disappeared. Don't know where he is.

576
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:54,484
15 Mapleton Drive.

577
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:56,493
You've been here before?

578
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,495
Yep.

579
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:01,862
l once babysat a Russian defector
here for three months.

580
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,527
About 20 years ago.

581
00:47:04,568 --> 00:47:07,366
He had very bad breath
and played with himself a lot.

582
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:23,987
l'll just go get us a drink.

583
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:26,080
Fine.

584
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,268
Hot chocolate.

585
00:47:38,302 --> 00:47:41,533
lt's very warming
this time of night.

586
00:47:41,572 --> 00:47:43,767
l never go to bed
without one.

587
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,375
So, what's going on?

588
00:47:55,553 --> 00:47:59,148
l'm not a field operative as
you've probably already realized.

589
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:03,091
l understand you were,
and a very good one too.

590
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:08,191
Until you overstepped
the bounds...

591
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,928
got a bit too physical
on an assignment.

592
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,900
This isn't ''This ls Your Life,
Harry Anders.''

593
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,237
No.

594
00:48:17,274 --> 00:48:20,505
So how come l'm suddenly
up to my ass

595
00:48:20,544 --> 00:48:23,638
in British and American security
and intelligence guys?

596
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:28,675
Think of all that's been
happening as music, as jazz.

597
00:48:31,689 --> 00:48:34,487
lt sounds jumbled.

598
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:37,323
Somebody upstairs is playing
a different tune entirely.

599
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:43,525
But if you listen hard enough,
somewhere...

600
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:45,865
somewhere in the middle...

601
00:48:47,538 --> 00:48:49,563
you can hear the melody.

602
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:02,786
Where is everybody?

603
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,788
No problem, Harry.

604
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:06,790
Tell them
what they wanna know.

605
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:08,792
Problem?

606
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:10,794
Who's got a problem?

607
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:13,456
Let me give you
a piece of advice, Harry.

608
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,601
Let go of me, you fucks!

609
00:49:20,804 --> 00:49:23,830
# Someday somewhere... #

610
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,638
# We'll be close together,
wait and see... #

611
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:29,111
You know your music,
don't you, Harry?

612
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:31,080
Don't let them hurt me!

613
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,083
# By the way #

614
00:49:33,117 --> 00:49:36,245
# This time
the dream's on me. #

615
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:54,137
l think we're gonna
have trouble here.

616
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:57,368
Stop harassing me.
l didn't know he was an agent.

617
00:49:57,408 --> 00:49:59,205
l just told him,
l don't know anything.

618
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:01,438
We're not gonna get
very far like this, are we?

619
00:50:01,478 --> 00:50:03,969
- You're lying.
- Why would l be lying?

620
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:08,045
Why are you doing this?
lt's all a mistake!

621
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:10,713
You'll just have
to follow the music.

622
00:50:10,754 --> 00:50:12,221
Tell them what
you did in there.

623
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:14,554
- l run a jazz club.
- My name is Harry Anders.

624
00:50:14,591 --> 00:50:17,492
- Come on, Harry, tell them.
- My name is Harry Anders!

625
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:20,554
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- lt's so easy.

626
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:22,531
l do not know anything!

627
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:27,503
- Respectful of the bloody training.
- l do not know anything!

628
00:50:27,538 --> 00:50:29,403
l do not know anything!

629
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,068
- You know the rules, Harry.
- l can't tell you anything.

630
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:34,077
Tell us what we want to know.

631
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:36,579
Tell us what we want to know
if you care about the girl.

632
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,618
Tell them what they
wanna know, Harry.

633
00:50:42,653 --> 00:50:45,383
- The horn player's a bit rusty.
- Stop, l can't see.

634
00:50:45,422 --> 00:50:48,687
You're a bit rusty, Harry.
You have to know how to listen.

635
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:51,593
Here we meet again.
Just fucking keep on doing it!

636
00:50:51,628 --> 00:50:54,620
l can do it all bloody night
if l want! Now tell me!

637
00:50:57,534 --> 00:50:59,798
l don't know anything!

638
00:51:00,804 --> 00:51:02,465
Harry?

639
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:09,212
You're a bit rusty, Harry.

640
00:51:09,246 --> 00:51:11,908
You're a bit rusty.
You're a bit rusty, Harry.

641
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:19,619
Fuck you!
C-V-H-7-4-3

642
00:51:19,656 --> 00:51:22,284
You should have
told them, Harry.

643
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:28,198
Fuck you!
l don't know anything.

644
00:53:14,872 --> 00:53:16,863
Bastards.

645
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:37,253
Hop in, sir.

646
00:53:55,145 --> 00:53:57,375
Driving is not too bad there
this time of day.

647
00:53:57,414 --> 00:53:59,439
We should make it
in 50 minutes nicely.

648
00:54:08,425 --> 00:54:11,622
Do you mind if l--?

649
00:54:11,662 --> 00:54:14,358
l do find it relaxing.

650
00:54:14,398 --> 00:54:15,922
Helps the day go by.

651
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,270
We're authorized
to the lounge.

652
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:35,444
Carry on, sir.

653
00:54:46,597 --> 00:54:49,088
We're here, Mr. Anders, sir.

654
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:57,532
The revised E.T.A. of the Minister's plane
is 11-0-0 hours.

655
00:54:57,574 --> 00:54:59,974
l've made arrangements
to put the press conference

656
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:02,808
and the reception at the Foreign Office
back by three hours.

657
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:04,814
No.

658
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,816
A little breakfast,
Sir Hector?

659
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:16,659
Better make that breakfast
for two, l think.

660
00:55:16,693 --> 00:55:20,151
What have you been up to, Harry?
You look absolutely ghastly.

661
00:55:20,197 --> 00:55:22,165
l wish l could say
the same about you, Sir.

662
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,030
Being a lord suits you.

663
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,968
Oh, no no, just a humble baronet,
dear boy.

664
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:29,165
l never thought of you
as the humble type, Sir.

665
00:55:29,206 --> 00:55:33,074
They felt l had to have something when
they put me out to grass.

666
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,578
Knighthood was probably
the cheapest.

667
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:38,581
Gave me compulsory
early retirement, you know,

668
00:55:38,615 --> 00:55:40,583
into the protocol division.

669
00:55:40,617 --> 00:55:44,451
l'm just a greaser now,
a handshake in a business suit.

670
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:46,456
Yes.

671
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,458
l've always admired
your handshake, Sir.

672
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,551
Very firm.

673
00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:55,525
Are you waiting
for somebody now?

674
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,533
Yes, the Finance Minister
of Nepal.

675
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:00,331
You're joking.

676
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,928
No, l'm not.

677
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:04,907
Why don't you have some
double kidneys? They're delicious.

678
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:06,203
No, thank you.

679
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:10,102
Do you still have that club?

680
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:11,671
Just about.

681
00:56:11,715 --> 00:56:13,876
l'll have to pop in there
one day.

682
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,408
Do that. Bring the Finance Minister
with you.

683
00:56:16,453 --> 00:56:18,421
Tuesday nights
is Nepalese night.

684
00:56:18,455 --> 00:56:19,717
Very popular.

685
00:56:25,862 --> 00:56:28,262
Are you gonna tell me what
the hell is going on, Sir?

686
00:56:28,298 --> 00:56:30,596
Or do l just
stand here guessing?

687
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:35,768
l had forgotten how insolent
you actually are, Anders.

688
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:42,238
The Americans are up to something.
They won't cut us in.

689
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:44,076
lt is thought
you might know.

690
00:56:44,114 --> 00:56:46,241
l couldn't have been
asked nicely?

691
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:48,945
Did it have to be
done like that?

692
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:50,748
Now, l wasn't party
to that decision.

693
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,755
l'm just a handshake
now, remember?

694
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:55,280
Have some toast.

695
00:56:55,325 --> 00:56:57,691
You recruited me,
and you ran me.

696
00:56:57,728 --> 00:56:59,696
lf you're so far
out of the loop,

697
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,698
how come l'm here
talking to you?

698
00:57:01,732 --> 00:57:03,962
That was rather
unnecessary, Anders.

699
00:57:07,037 --> 00:57:09,005
Look, you're here
unofficially,

700
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:11,269
l'm warning you unofficially.

701
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:14,410
Just stay out of this.

702
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:17,311
- Stay out of what?
- This is all above my head.

703
00:57:17,347 --> 00:57:19,315
All l know is that
you're a target.

704
00:57:19,349 --> 00:57:22,682
l don't want you to be any more
of one than you already are.

705
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:26,382
l don't have to do what you say.
l don't work for you anymore.

706
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:28,482
l don't think you have
any choice, dear boy.

707
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,493
That's where you're wrong,
Sir Hector,

708
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,392
because l have all kinds
of choices.

709
00:57:32,429 --> 00:57:35,660
l can go straight out of here around
to Grovener Square for example,

710
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:38,896
and kick up such a fuss that l get in
to see the American Ambassador--

711
00:57:38,935 --> 00:57:41,403
with whom, as it happens,
l am on first-name terms.

712
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:44,271
And l could tell him that something stinks
in his embassy,

713
00:57:44,307 --> 00:57:45,968
and that he ought
to know about it.

714
00:57:46,009 --> 00:57:48,705
That would mean the embassy's security
staff got involved.

715
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:50,872
- We don't want that.
- Well...

716
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:53,212
as a matter of fact, Sir Hector,

717
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,912
l get on pretty well
with Americans.

718
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:58,250
They're looking
for you, Harry.

719
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:02,254
They want to talk to you
about Sam Garcia.

720
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:17,732
Before he was shot,
he was worked over with a knife

721
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:20,265
to see what he knew.

722
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:22,642
The Americans are very angry
with you, Harry.

723
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,145
You see, Garcia had
a lot of friends here.

724
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,938
My name is Stacy.

725
00:58:48,972 --> 00:58:51,304
Would you like
to buy me a drink?

726
00:58:51,341 --> 00:58:53,901
Harry, l'm so happy.

727
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:56,469
You don't fool me.
l know men like you, remember?

728
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:58,879
- Come to bed, Harry.
- All that tough-guy talk...

729
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:01,611
- Harry, come to bed.
- ...scar tissue on the outside,

730
00:59:01,651 --> 00:59:03,983
hopeless romantics
on the inside.

731
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:49,060
l think you'd better tell me
what the hell is going on.

732
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:51,329
- Nothing is going on.
- What are you doing here!?

733
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:54,394
l'm not here. l never was.

734
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:56,428
l just came to get my things.

735
00:59:57,874 --> 01:00:01,071
- Who was Kyle?
- You just don't understand.

736
01:00:01,111 --> 01:00:04,171
l understand that you used me
to get two of my friends killed

737
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:06,375
and every spook
in London on my tail.

738
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:07,474
You're hurting me.

739
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:09,849
l'll hurt you even more
if l don't get some answers.

740
01:00:09,886 --> 01:00:11,444
Now who was Kyle?

741
01:00:11,488 --> 01:00:14,150
He was my ex-boyfriend,
like l told you.

742
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,681
What l didn't tell you was...

743
01:00:16,726 --> 01:00:19,820
he worked for Military
lntelligence.

744
01:00:19,863 --> 01:00:21,888
Christ.

745
01:00:28,705 --> 01:00:31,196
Then why didn't you even
show up at the hotel?

746
01:00:32,676 --> 01:00:35,770
l did come to the hotel,
but it was crawling with police.

747
01:00:35,812 --> 01:00:37,780
l knew something
must have happened.

748
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:39,782
You're damn right
something happened.

749
01:00:39,816 --> 01:00:42,944
l couldn't get involved.
lt would destroy Lewis.

750
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:45,045
Fuck Lewis. You left me
to swing in the wind!

751
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:48,421
lt was me who got you
out of jail!

752
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,086
lt was because of you l was
there in the first place.

753
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:55,327
What was Kyle
involved in?

754
01:00:57,934 --> 01:01:02,268
lt was some kind
of undercover operation.

755
01:01:02,305 --> 01:01:04,535
Then something happened,
some kind of trouble.

756
01:01:04,574 --> 01:01:06,542
What trouble?

757
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:08,544
l'm not sure.

758
01:01:08,578 --> 01:01:10,705
He had this information,
but there wasn't...

759
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:12,715
anyone he felt
he could trust enough

760
01:01:12,749 --> 01:01:15,013
to pass it on to.

761
01:01:18,722 --> 01:01:20,690
So he called you?

762
01:01:20,724 --> 01:01:22,692
Yes, but halfway
through the call

763
01:01:22,726 --> 01:01:24,694
the line went dead.

764
01:01:24,728 --> 01:01:27,526
l had to find him.
l had to know he was okay.

765
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:32,197
What information
did he give you?

766
01:01:39,776 --> 01:01:42,301
''X-P-L-A, C-l-F

767
01:01:42,345 --> 01:01:46,304
- Reefer.''
- Or, uh, ''refer.''

768
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:48,749
He was speaking so quickly,
l can't be sure.

769
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:53,688
That's when l banged
into your car.

770
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:56,123
That's exactly what happened.

771
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:01,957
''CVH-7 43.

772
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:03,966
KMF8.''

773
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,968
Have you any idea
what that means?

774
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:07,970
l don't have any idea.

775
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:10,404
You're the spy, Harry.
l thought you'd know.

776
01:02:18,415 --> 01:02:20,940
l am so sorry.

777
01:02:20,984 --> 01:02:23,179
l couldn't get
involved, Harry.

778
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:29,322
You aren't, Stacy.

779
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:33,092
What are you going to do?

780
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,324
l'm gonna find the people
who killed my friends.

781
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:44,662
''Ory's Creole Trombone''...

782
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,566
a collector's item.

783
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,607
What--

784
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:53,233
what is it you want?

785
01:03:53,276 --> 01:03:56,336
What does CVH-7 43
KMF8 mean?

786
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:58,438
l don't know.

787
01:03:59,616 --> 01:04:01,481
Try again.

788
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:04,214
- l told you, l don't know!
- You bastards know everything.

789
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:06,586
They train you to know--

790
01:04:06,623 --> 01:04:08,591
Stop it, please!

791
01:04:08,625 --> 01:04:10,593
You bureaucrats...

792
01:04:10,627 --> 01:04:12,595
you're funny.

793
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:15,564
l never know
when you're lying!

794
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:17,589
You bastard!

795
01:04:19,302 --> 01:04:21,668
What are you going to do?
Shoot me? You're crazy!

796
01:04:21,704 --> 01:04:23,797
What was that all about
last night?

797
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,173
l don't know. A 40-D came down,
l just executed it.

798
01:04:30,547 --> 01:04:33,607
- Let's try that again.
- l don't know!

799
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:35,845
Knee's next, Stevens.

800
01:04:39,956 --> 01:04:43,722
lt has something to do
with illegal arms.

801
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,728
Um...

802
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:48,322
the Americans aren't--
uh, sharing.

803
01:04:48,364 --> 01:04:50,298
People are getting worried.

804
01:04:53,403 --> 01:04:55,871
- lllegal arms?
- Yeah.

805
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,702
That's all l know!

806
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,503
No! No!

807
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:02,136
That's all l know! That's all l know!
That's all l know!

808
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:12,021
Absolutely fascinating.

809
01:05:12,055 --> 01:05:14,023
Thank you
for a lovely evening.

810
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:16,321
- See you next week.
- l look forward to it.

811
01:05:18,595 --> 01:05:20,825
Bye-bye.

812
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:23,093
Sir Hector!

813
01:05:23,132 --> 01:05:25,191
Sir Hector!

814
01:05:38,114 --> 01:05:40,082
What the hell
are you doing here?

815
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:42,084
- He shot me.
- Get out of the light.

816
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:44,109
Quickly!

817
01:05:46,155 --> 01:05:48,851
For God's sake,
what happened?

818
01:05:48,891 --> 01:05:51,689
l just came around
to my flat.

819
01:05:51,728 --> 01:05:53,491
He went crazy!

820
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:55,156
He shot me.
He could have killed me!

821
01:05:55,198 --> 01:05:57,166
Why come here?

822
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,998
l can't go to the hospital
with a gunshot wound.

823
01:06:00,036 --> 01:06:02,061
They'll report me
to the police.

824
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:06,675
l need a friendly doctor.

825
01:06:06,709 --> 01:06:08,677
l know one. Have you got
a piece of paper?

826
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:11,009
l'll jot down
the address for you.

827
01:06:28,298 --> 01:06:30,323
Goodbye, Stevens.

828
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,018
Harry...

829
01:07:56,052 --> 01:07:58,213
Harry!

830
01:08:01,257 --> 01:08:03,725
lt's gonna be all right.

831
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:12,866
Oh, Harry...

832
01:08:41,597 --> 01:08:43,861
ls something wrong,
my dear?

833
01:08:45,668 --> 01:08:48,296
Do you remember
Harry Anders?

834
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:51,329
- The jazz club owner?
- He's in trouble.

835
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:54,309
Anything l can do to help?

836
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:56,641
You are so wonderful.

837
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:01,282
l love you. You are always
so good to me.

838
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:05,784
l want you to make
a phone call for me.

839
01:09:13,563 --> 01:09:16,691
Harry, where have you been?
l've been looking for you everywhere.

840
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:19,633
- l know what Kyle was working on.
- So do l, illegal arms trade.

841
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:22,866
No, Harry, arms shipments. He was
working undercover at the docks.

842
01:09:22,905 --> 01:09:24,930
Docks?

843
01:09:26,175 --> 01:09:28,143
X-P-L-A.

844
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:30,145
Export of London.

845
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:32,807
P.L.A:
Port of London Authority.

846
01:09:35,251 --> 01:09:37,742
- Oh my God, Buddy!
- Buddy?

847
01:09:37,787 --> 01:09:40,085
Buddy is in there?

848
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:47,991
You'll be all right, luv.
Just hang on.

849
01:09:53,002 --> 01:09:56,403
Go back to the embassy and stay
there till l call, you understand?

850
01:09:56,439 --> 01:09:58,066
Where are you going?

851
01:09:58,107 --> 01:10:00,473
Stacy, stay there
and l'll call you.

852
01:10:05,181 --> 01:10:06,944
- l have been used--
- Excuse me, sir!

853
01:10:06,983 --> 01:10:08,848
--imprisoned,
lied to and blown up,

854
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:11,683
- and l've decided l've had enough, Sir.
- l beg your pardon?

855
01:10:11,721 --> 01:10:15,157
ln case the bastards responsible
get me before l get them,

856
01:10:15,191 --> 01:10:18,058
- l want you to have this.
- What is it?

857
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,528
l don't know exactly, Sir,
but l intend to find out.

858
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:24,363
lf l end up brown bread, l'm relying
on you to get that to the right people.

859
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,267
- ''Brown bread''?
- Dead, Sir. lt's rhyming slang.

860
01:10:27,303 --> 01:10:31,000
lf l end up dead, l'm relying on you
to get that to the right people,

861
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,531
and make sure that
whoever did me gets done.

862
01:10:33,576 --> 01:10:35,840
All right, Sir?
l've got to get going.

863
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:38,574
Uh, Anders...

864
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,221
Ring, damn it!

865
01:11:06,275 --> 01:11:08,243
To the docks.
Port of London.

866
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,438
Yes, ma'am.

867
01:11:18,788 --> 01:11:20,449
Base, this is Security One.

868
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:23,049
- We're moving proceeding west.
- Roger, Security One.

869
01:11:23,092 --> 01:11:25,993
Received and understood.

870
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:28,758
- You with the police then, mate?
- You'll be with the bloody

871
01:11:28,798 --> 01:11:31,596
National Health Service
if you don't tell me what this means.

872
01:11:31,634 --> 01:11:34,125
- All right. X.P.L.A., Export--
- Of London Authority.

873
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:36,035
l know that,
what about C.l.F?

874
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:39,473
Carriage lnsured Freight-- the load's
ready to be shipped immediately.

875
01:11:39,508 --> 01:11:41,772
''Reefer,'' that's
a refrigerated container.

876
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:44,439
- The rest of it is a serial number.
- So where will it be?

877
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,004
Ah...

878
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,676
out there, mate.
With all the others.

879
01:12:01,197 --> 01:12:04,689
Base, we've changed routes.
We're heading to the river. Over.

880
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:12,807
We're now approaching Waterloo,
do you copy?

881
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:15,367
Roger, stay in pursuit.

882
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:40,166
Look out!

883
01:12:45,007 --> 01:12:47,407
Security One to Base.
We've been deliberately hit.

884
01:12:47,443 --> 01:12:49,411
We've lost them.
Repeat, we've lost them.

885
01:12:49,445 --> 01:12:51,913
Damn it, they got away.

886
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,393
- Why isn't Gordon driving?
- Day off, ma'am.

887
01:13:08,798 --> 01:13:10,993
He takes Sundays off.

888
01:13:15,271 --> 01:13:17,296
You just sit back
and relax, ma'am.

889
01:15:09,018 --> 01:15:12,454
l see an unauthorized person
inside the perimeter. Over.

890
01:15:12,488 --> 01:15:15,013
Received, we'll notify
security immediately.

891
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:54,462
l'm still looking. l think he's
gone to the east side.

892
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,158
Yeah, L-1 3, l see it.

893
01:16:01,203 --> 01:16:03,933
Yeah, l'll come up and help you.
Roll up D-7.

894
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,669
Fine, l'll turn around
and roll back the other way.

895
01:16:13,482 --> 01:16:15,211
There he is!

896
01:16:16,452 --> 01:16:19,012
This is Car Two.
We're moving into Section D-7.

897
01:16:19,054 --> 01:16:21,045
We're in pursuit. Over.

898
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:24,548
l can't see him. The farter's got
to be around here somewhere.

899
01:16:24,593 --> 01:16:26,686
l'm looking.
l still can't see him.

900
01:16:26,729 --> 01:16:28,094
Well, neither can l!

901
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:37,801
That's it.
Come on, we'll get him.

902
01:16:40,676 --> 01:16:46,273
Transport to Seven,
please move to Cargo Area B.

903
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:50,945
Freight is now departing
from the north gate.

904
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,525
Attention, attention!

905
01:17:01,563 --> 01:17:04,862
Unauthorized person
still on premises.

906
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,630
Report immediately
if sighted.

907
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:09,865
Report immediately
if sighted!

908
01:17:17,947 --> 01:17:19,812
Come on.
You got it. Come on.

909
01:17:20,849 --> 01:17:22,817
This is L-1 3.

910
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:25,547
l'm gonna turn
into Section G-4.

911
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:29,016
Still no sign of him.

912
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:31,850
Wait a minute.

913
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:35,827
l've got him!

914
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:39,634
He's in G-4,
heading west!

915
01:17:39,668 --> 01:17:41,932
Repeat, G-4,
heading west.

916
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:48,098
l'm right up his ass!

917
01:17:48,143 --> 01:17:50,668
Look at that bleeder run.

918
01:17:58,921 --> 01:18:00,616
Shit!

919
01:18:18,407 --> 01:18:20,375
We're moving up
behind L-14.

920
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:22,240
What do you
want us to do? Over.

921
01:18:25,314 --> 01:18:28,340
Shit, l've lost him!

922
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:33,651
Say, ''He's over
the fence...''

923
01:18:36,959 --> 01:18:38,620
He-- he's over the fence.

924
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,185
''...in the railyard.''

925
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:42,925
ln the railyard.

926
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:49,396
Drop the container.
Drop it now!

927
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,040
Christ!

928
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:06,279
L-14, do you copy?

929
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:08,016
Come in, L-14.

930
01:19:08,057 --> 01:19:10,184
Go towards that ship.

931
01:19:12,161 --> 01:19:16,860
L-14, do you copy?
Are you in pursuit? What's going--

932
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:22,470
Stay right where you are

933
01:19:22,504 --> 01:19:24,472
or l will get very angry.

934
01:19:24,506 --> 01:19:26,940
Okay? Okay.

935
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:57,599
Going on your holidays, are you?
Put the guns down.

936
01:19:57,639 --> 01:20:01,075
Very slowly,
put 'em down!

937
01:20:01,110 --> 01:20:03,078
You at the back,

938
01:20:03,112 --> 01:20:04,773
put both hands
on top of the car.

939
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:11,783
So what's in
CVH-734 KMF8?

940
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,378
Warheads?

941
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:15,754
Nothing so glamorous,
l'm afraid, Harry.

942
01:20:17,192 --> 01:20:19,160
High temperature
aerospace furnaces

943
01:20:19,194 --> 01:20:21,219
for making missile
components.

944
01:20:22,798 --> 01:20:25,358
My customers are looking
to upgrade their medium range

945
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,630
and battlefield
delivery systems.

946
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:30,968
Some lunatic in the desert
replenishing his collection of toys?

947
01:20:31,006 --> 01:20:33,770
Oh, come on, Harry.

948
01:20:33,809 --> 01:20:37,245
They were using
poison gas 75 years ago.

949
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:40,612
lt was our side that actually
dropped the bomb, you know?

950
01:20:40,649 --> 01:20:43,709
Don't let's get
all moral about this.

951
01:20:43,752 --> 01:20:46,414
lt's not a question of morals,

952
01:20:46,455 --> 01:20:49,652
l'm just scared of being turned
into a french fry one morning.

953
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,893
- How much are these things worth?
- 10 million, Harry.

954
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,793
But that's not the only reason
l'm doing it.

955
01:21:03,472 --> 01:21:05,531
They fired me!

956
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:10,475
The pinstripes turned on me
like they turned on you.

957
01:21:10,512 --> 01:21:13,310
We don't owe them
a damned thing, Harry.

958
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:17,311
Five million.

959
01:21:20,556 --> 01:21:23,116
- l can't do that.
- We gave them everything!

960
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,861
What did they give us
in return?

961
01:21:27,896 --> 01:21:30,524
A wet handshake with a director
on a Friday afternoon--

962
01:21:30,566 --> 01:21:33,126
and he kept
looking at his watch.

963
01:21:33,168 --> 01:21:35,159
Five million, Harry.

964
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:39,140
l really hate to see you
like this, Sir Hector.

965
01:21:39,174 --> 01:21:41,802
l hate to see the man
who taught me everything...

966
01:21:41,843 --> 01:21:43,310
end like this.

967
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:46,977
But l'm not going to end up
like this, Harry.

968
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:50,177
Yes, l should, uh...

969
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:52,187
l should have known that
you would assume

970
01:21:52,221 --> 01:21:54,519
that you could get
the better of me.

971
01:21:54,556 --> 01:21:58,652
You always were
an arrogant bastard, Anders.

972
01:21:58,694 --> 01:22:00,753
Why don't we finish this
at Scotland Yard?

973
01:22:00,796 --> 01:22:02,320
l don't think so, Harry.

974
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:06,629
Oh, l admit you
forced my hand,

975
01:22:06,668 --> 01:22:10,934
made me start tying up
some loose ends.

976
01:22:10,973 --> 01:22:12,634
lncluding the girl.

977
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:15,108
Stacy's safe.

978
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:26,113
Depends what you mean
by safe, Harry.

979
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:30,052
Let her go, and l'll
put the gun down.

980
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,591
Harry!

981
01:22:37,366 --> 01:22:39,960
- Are you okay?
- Okay? Uh, yeah.

982
01:22:47,576 --> 01:22:48,907
Billiards shot.

983
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:54,777
Gotcha! Stay there.

984
01:22:54,816 --> 01:22:56,977
Okay.

985
01:24:26,408 --> 01:24:30,174
# Oh, l do like to be
beside the seaside #

986
01:24:30,212 --> 01:24:33,477
# l don't like to be-- #

987
01:24:38,854 --> 01:24:41,152
Why you, Harry?

988
01:24:45,127 --> 01:24:47,721
That's what l
couldn't understand.

989
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:56,098
You see, that's why
l couldn't kill her straightaway.

990
01:24:56,138 --> 01:25:00,040
l had to find out how she knew

991
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:02,908
to go to you.

992
01:25:02,944 --> 01:25:04,912
Why you, Harry?

993
01:25:04,946 --> 01:25:07,608
Why you of all people?

994
01:25:09,785 --> 01:25:11,753
Blue ice.

995
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:14,119
Just put it down
to blue ice.

996
01:25:19,461 --> 01:25:22,453
Your time's running out, Harry.

997
01:25:24,633 --> 01:25:26,533
l taught you...

998
01:25:26,568 --> 01:25:30,163
l know all about you.

999
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:33,834
Oh, you're good.

1000
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:37,868
But l'm better.

1001
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:41,713
l'll always be... better.

1002
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:45,379
How close was Sam Garcia getting
when you killed him?

1003
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:49,686
Too close. He was beginning
to ask the right questions.

1004
01:25:49,724 --> 01:25:52,420
He had to go.

1005
01:25:56,131 --> 01:25:58,793
l liked Sam.

1006
01:25:58,834 --> 01:26:02,099
l like all you boys.

1007
01:26:02,137 --> 01:26:04,128
lt was never personal.

1008
01:26:10,745 --> 01:26:12,508
Even when you used
the knife on him?

1009
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,251
lce pick, Harry.

1010
01:26:17,285 --> 01:26:19,116
lt goes deeper.

1011
01:26:43,912 --> 01:26:46,745
Well, Harry...

1012
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:49,841
l'm afraid it's time
for you to be brown bread.

1013
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:56,514
Nothing personal.

1014
01:27:00,161 --> 01:27:02,026
Whoa!

1015
01:27:11,106 --> 01:27:12,300
Harry!

1016
01:27:36,731 --> 01:27:39,529
Hut, hut, hut!

1017
01:27:46,808 --> 01:27:49,140
Present... arms!

1018
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:30,043
Goodbye, Sir.

1019
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:39,920
# Let there be me #

1020
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:43,226
# Let there be oysters #

1021
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:46,199
# Under the sea #

1022
01:28:46,234 --> 01:28:48,862
# Let there be wind #

1023
01:28:48,903 --> 01:28:52,839
# An occasional rain #

1024
01:28:52,874 --> 01:28:55,968
# Chile con carne #

1025
01:28:56,011 --> 01:28:58,479
# Sparkling champagne... #

1026
01:28:58,513 --> 01:29:00,743
Christ, Buddy,
aren't they suffering enough?

1027
01:29:00,782 --> 01:29:03,444
Have you no compassion
for your fellow patients?

1028
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:09,918
# But most of all, please... #

1029
01:29:09,958 --> 01:29:12,153
# Let there be love. #

1030
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:32,270
You look so deep
in thought, Harry.

1031
01:29:32,313 --> 01:29:35,476
l was doing
some serious thinking.

1032
01:29:35,517 --> 01:29:37,485
About what?

1033
01:29:37,519 --> 01:29:40,317
About the club.

1034
01:29:40,355 --> 01:29:42,323
l was thinking
about a new name.

1035
01:29:42,357 --> 01:29:45,019
lt was never intended
to call it ''Harry's.''

1036
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:47,756
That just stuck.

1037
01:29:47,796 --> 01:29:51,323
l thought maybe... ''Stacy's.''

1038
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:53,664
You know, more flash.

1039
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,898
You're being very kind.

1040
01:29:57,939 --> 01:30:00,237
But you know that's not
such a good idea.

1041
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:02,607
No?

1042
01:30:02,644 --> 01:30:04,111
Why not?

1043
01:30:04,145 --> 01:30:08,605
Lewis owns a couple of banks
the regulators are looking into.

1044
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,414
We gotta get back
to Washington.

1045
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,887
- When?
- Three days from now.

1046
01:30:15,924 --> 01:30:18,654
So you, uh... you won't be
staying on in London?

1047
01:30:18,693 --> 01:30:21,025
Not by yourself, say?

1048
01:30:21,062 --> 01:30:24,429
No, l can't.

1049
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:30,430
Well...

1050
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:33,566
''Harry's'' isn't such
a bad name after all, then.

1051
01:30:33,608 --> 01:30:36,236
l owe Lewis.

1052
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:39,644
Way back when my life
was a complete mess,

1053
01:30:39,681 --> 01:30:41,649
he was there for me.

1054
01:30:41,683 --> 01:30:44,174
And as much as l love you,

1055
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:46,187
and l do, Harry,

1056
01:30:46,221 --> 01:30:48,189
there's no way
l could ever hurt him.

1057
01:30:48,223 --> 01:30:51,021
That's okay, Stacy.

1058
01:30:51,059 --> 01:30:53,960
l wish it were different.

1059
01:30:53,995 --> 01:30:56,896
ln a couple of years,

1060
01:30:56,931 --> 01:30:58,899
who knows?

1061
01:30:58,933 --> 01:31:00,901
Yeah.

1062
01:31:00,935 --> 01:31:04,393
At least you'll always
know where to find me.

1063
01:31:04,439 --> 01:31:08,068
Third elbow from the left
at the bar.

1064
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:12,477
Will you still
keep your promise?

1065
01:31:12,514 --> 01:31:15,108
What promise is that?

1066
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:19,450
You said, when it was
time for me to go,

1067
01:31:19,487 --> 01:31:23,150
you'd have a glass of champagne
with me at the airport.

1068
01:31:25,126 --> 01:31:27,424
A promise is a promise.

1069
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,694
l love you.

1070
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:03,057
# East of the sun #

1071
01:32:03,097 --> 01:32:06,999
# And west of the moon #

1072
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:12,262
# We'll build
a dream house #

1073
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:16,835
# Of love, dear #

1074
01:32:16,878 --> 01:32:21,406
# Near to the sun
in the day #

1075
01:32:21,449 --> 01:32:25,385
# Near to the moon
at night #

1076
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:30,483
# We'll live
in a lovely way, dear #

1077
01:32:30,525 --> 01:32:34,962
# Living in love
and pale moonlight #

1078
01:32:34,996 --> 01:32:37,931
# Just you and l #

1079
01:32:37,966 --> 01:32:42,903
# Forever and a day #

1080
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:46,429
# Love will not die #

1081
01:32:46,474 --> 01:32:50,570
# We'll keep it that way #

1082
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:53,308
# Up among the stars
we'll find #

1083
01:32:53,348 --> 01:32:57,011
# A harmony of life
to a lovely tune #

1084
01:32:57,051 --> 01:33:02,284
# East of the sun
and west of the moon, dear #

1085
01:33:02,323 --> 01:33:08,284
# East of the sun
and west of the moon. #
