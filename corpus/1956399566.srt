1
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,370
MAN:
Battalion!

2
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:27,789
MAN:
Ready! Fire!

3
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,791
MAN:
Fire!

4
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,625
WOMAN:
Permiso. Permiso.

5
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,367
Permiso. Permiso.
Permiso.

6
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,890
Can I see your pass?

7
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,111
Okay.Meléndez!

8
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,678
Somebody took a shot
at the governor,

9
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:49,201
and you missed it.

10
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,813
He's still standing there
waving. Brave guy.

11
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:55,033
Happy Constitution Day.
We're going to the beach.

12
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,339
Are we
the last ones?

13
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:58,080
We work a little harder.

14
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,746
TOUR GUIDE :
Attention. Come to
the Constitution Day parade

15
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,357
in Old San Juan Plaza.

16
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,926
Free bus rides to the Constitution Day parade.

17
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:22,104
Hear the governor speak.
Let's celebrate.

18
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,235
Where's the fucking taxi?

19
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,628
It'll get here.

20
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:26,717
Alfredo, we've been waiting here
an hour already.

21
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,458
Hey, it's a holiday.What?

22
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:31,853
You assholes wanna back out
or something?

23
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,507
Chucho--

24
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,943
Because your enthusiasm's
killing me here, man.

25
00:05:34,986 --> 00:05:37,337
Hey, we're doing it,
all right? We're doing it!

26
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,164
We're not just bullshitting
anymore, you know?

27
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,738
Did you call for a cab,
muchachos?

28
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:50,045
This is going to be
a great day, my friends.

29
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,875
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let me out of here.

30
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,703
Take the cab.

31
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:57,835
Shut your face!

32
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:07,889
Puerto Rico's 26th anniversary
as a U.S. Commonwealth.

33
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,457
Although that's not good enough
for the campaigning governor.

34
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,633
He wants July 25th
to celebrate

35
00:06:12,676 --> 00:06:15,418
the day Puerto Rico becomes
the 51st state.

36
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,856
This is Kate Meléndez,
Channel 74 News.

37
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,732
Don't miss the band.
Here they come.

38
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,528
CROWD:
Que bonita bandera,
que bonita bandera ♪

39
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:42,445
Que bonita bandera,
la bandera puertorriqueña ♪

40
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,838
Que bonita bandera ♪

41
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,840
Our Commonwealth status
isn't good enough

42
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:47,755
for the Ponce Firehouse Band
either.

43
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,931
They're in favor
of independence.

44
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:52,412
As you can hear, they're playing
what's become their theme song

45
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,892
at these parades,
"Que Bonita Bandera."

46
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,634
The anthem of
the Independentistas.

47
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,817
We're not gonna hurt you.
Don't worry.

48
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,689
We're revolutionaries.Oh, my God!

49
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:11,082
Please, slow down.
My car, it's all I have.

50
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,301
Would you
just shut up?

51
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:13,520
But where are you
taking me?

52
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,391
What are you going
to do with me?

53
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,610
Hey, back off!

54
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:17,611
Hey! Hey!

55
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:18,960
I told him to shut up.

56
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,092
He didn't shut up.
He didn't listen.

57
00:07:21,136 --> 00:07:22,703
This is what happens, huh?

58
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:55,953
This won't take long.

59
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,434
Just in case you had
a good idea, huh?

60
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,373
Governor.
Huh?

61
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,725
Okay, pan to the man
over there.

62
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,946
MAN:
Your attention, please.

63
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,602
Please, I have an announcement.

64
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,649
Please, please.
I have an announcement.

65
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:43,131
Do you have sound?Yeah.

66
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,915
GOVERNOR:
I was just informed

67
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,656
that the police have beaten back

68
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,181
a group of
Independentista terrorists

69
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:54,708
who were trying to blow up
the communications towers

70
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:59,364
at Cerro Maravilla
in Toro Negro Forest.

71
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,803
The terrorists
refused to surrender,

72
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,414
and they were killed
in a gun battle

73
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,982
that they started
with the police.

74
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:12,073
One brave officer was wounded.

75
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:18,470
Now, this incident
in our Constitution Day

76
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:22,300
serves to put Mr. Castro
on notice

77
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:26,914
that he cannot export
his Communist terrorism

78
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:28,785
to Puerto Rico.

79
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,657
MAN :
Base reading you. Headed in?

80
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,659
Not if you want
the biggest story of the summer,

81
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,095
and I don't mean
the parade.

82
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:35,618
Don't tell me on the two-way.

83
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,751
The competition will be
all over your ass.

84
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,187
Nobody's listening, Howard.

85
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,971
Everybody's wrapped
for the day.

86
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:44,105
Don't you believe it.
They'll unwrap. How big?

87
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,324
Cops and bodies,
and it's better than it sounds.

88
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,935
Make the 6:00?

89
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,371
We always do.

90
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:11,496
The captain's
right over there.

91
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,411
You looking
for a statement?

92
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,683
Buenos días,Señora Meléndez.

93
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:27,469
¿Cómo estás?

94
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:29,950
Captain.

95
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:31,865
CAPTAIN:
The undercover agent

96
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,997
working with the terrorists
had alerted us of the plan.

97
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,217
The officers instructed them
to drop their weapons,

98
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,958
but they opened fire.

99
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,829
The officers hit the ground
and in self-defense,

100
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,744
from a prone position,
returned fire,

101
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,485
killing both of the men.MAN: Stop it.

102
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:44,660
What's that guy
doing there?

103
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,923
I never even
noticed him.

104
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,062
Well, pull him out.
He looks like a stray dog.

105
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,933
Okay. Keep going.

106
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,983
--defense,
from a prone position,

107
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,420
returned fire,
killing both of the men.

108
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:07,335
KATE:
The two dead men
were identified

109
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,816
as Alfredo Ruiz and Jorge Rey.

110
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,643
Both were students
known to be sympathetic

111
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,471
to the Independentista cause.

112
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:17,693
The undercover agent,
Jesus Fuentes, was also shot.

113
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,130
He's hospitalized tonight,
wounded in the abdomen,

114
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,784
but he is expected to recover.

115
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,831
This is Kate Meléndez,
Channel 74 News.

116
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:31,228
You didn't shoot
the explosives.

117
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:33,361
Yeah, well, they'd already
been taken down the hill.

118
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:35,232
Oh, yeah, and we couldn't
get any confirmation,

119
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,539
but we saw this older guy
looking kind of worked over

120
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:39,236
being brought down in a jeep.

121
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,890
Since nobody knows
what I'm talking about,

122
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:42,979
you know I'm talking
about something.

123
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,286
Kind of like
a third bad guy, you mean?

124
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,940
Oh, man, he wouldn't have
looked that good.

125
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,419
Maybe a witness.

126
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,000
WOMAN: Can you believe it?

127
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,186
KATE:
Hello!

128
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,799
Mommy!Hi, how's my girl?

129
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,322
I missed you.Oh. Where's your brother?

130
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:22,714
He's in his room.

131
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,152
Juanito!

132
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,460
KATE:
Juanito!

133
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:31,854
You ready for dinner,
Miss Kate?

134
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,377
Well...

135
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,989
when this show's over.

136
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:37,773
How's Blanca doing?

137
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,907
You never want to watch.

138
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,170
You could learn something
from her.

139
00:13:43,213 --> 00:13:44,954
She knows
how to have a good time.

140
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,913
So do I.

141
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,440
If I could get
married again...

142
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:54,616
Except I don't
want to.

143
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,836
You don't wanna
go out either.

144
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:00,883
You sound just like
my mother.

145
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,153
Hi, Mom.
Hi.

146
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,068
You didn't hear me
come home?

147
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:13,243
Uh-uh.

148
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,810
What'd you do today?

149
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,204
Nothing.

150
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,032
Did you go to the beach?Yeah.

151
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,686
Well, that's something.Mm-hmm.

152
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,732
Was it nice?Very nice.

153
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,867
JUANITO:
Really nice.

154
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:31,435
KATE:
Hmmm.

155
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:32,480
JUANITO:
Mom,

156
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,961
women can't see this.

157
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,809
MAN:
Okay, if you need any help,
you give me a call.

158
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:00,377
Thanks a lot.

159
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:01,944
Since you two almost know
each other,

160
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:03,554
I'll make it official.

161
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:06,949
Hi, Kate.Frank Curtin. He's, uh, FBI.

162
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,733
I'm one of
the good guys.

163
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,301
Then I'm glad to meet you.

164
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,390
HOWARD: Kate Meléndez.Oh, I watch the show.

165
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,783
Frank's a--

166
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:15,915
He's a source.Yeah?

167
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,568
Yeah. You need
a fact checked,

168
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,744
you need something reconfirmed
on background, you, uh...

169
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:20,832
You give me a call.

170
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,573
It's one of my services.

171
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:24,967
Thanks, Frank.See you, Frank. Bye.

172
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,751
Nice to meet you.Likewise.

173
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:32,932
Well...

174
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,325
It was just a courtesy.

175
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,545
Why didn't you tell me
he was FBI

176
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,808
when you had me
cut him out of the footage?

177
00:15:39,851 --> 00:15:42,071
He's one of the best sources
we have around,

178
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,117
okay?
You should've told me.

179
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,946
I hate
not knowing things.

180
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:50,819
KATE:
One of the students

181
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:53,691
killed at Cerro Maravilla
was Jorge Rey,

182
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,303
son of Professor Rey, head of the history department

183
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,218
at the University
of Puerto Rico.

184
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,133
My son, Jorge,

185
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,091
he was not a terrorist.

186
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,659
He was not a revolutionary.

187
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,966
He was an Independentista.

188
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,011
And so am I, as you all know.

189
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:10,882
It's not a capital crime.

190
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,363
The police also claim

191
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:17,193
that my son and Alfredo Ruiz
were killed instantly.

192
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:19,891
Then I want to know,
why was my son so bruised?

193
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:23,156
I want the medical examiners
to explain that to me.

194
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,113
What bruises,
professor?

195
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:27,856
He was battered.

196
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,862
KATE:
Alfredo Ruiz,
sociology student,

197
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:36,299
leaves a wife
and a 10-month-old baby.

198
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:46,353
Do you want to talk
about Alfredo's politics?

199
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:47,789
He loved to read.

200
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,532
Do you know the police
are calling him a revolutionary?

201
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,360
He was a good husband.

202
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:56,015
He was a real good father.

203
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,756
Him and Jorge
and I don't know who else,

204
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,497
they go to cafeterias
and bars,

205
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,847
and they talk.

206
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,849
But he always came home.

207
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,069
Except yesterday.

208
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,853
I want to
show you something.

209
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,072
Can I show you
something, missus?

210
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,558
That's what I have left.

211
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,474
The police came,
and they look everywhere.

212
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:22,519
That's okay.

213
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,043
But they took everything.

214
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,827
Open it.

215
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,922
CARLA:
That's the "personal effects,"
they call them.

216
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,706
I went to the morgue.

217
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,056
His father and I went.

218
00:17:38,753 --> 00:17:41,060
I wasn't even sure
it was Alfredo for a second.

219
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,194
His face...

220
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,675
the whole side of his face,

221
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,111
it was all busted open.

222
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:05,214
We just finished paying
for his glasses.

223
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:07,206
I went to the morgue.

224
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,991
His father and I went.

225
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:13,212
I wasn't even sure
it was Alfredo for a second.

226
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:15,910
His face...

227
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,043
the whole side
of his face,

228
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,350
it was
all busted open.

229
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,320
A spokesman
for the police department

230
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,322
says that the bruises
seen by the families

231
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,193
were caused when the two boys
fell down an embankment

232
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,325
when they were shot.

233
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:42,719
Insert the bit
with the governor here.

234
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:48,856
Cerro Maravilla was a triumph for the forces of law and order

235
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,294
over the forces of terrorism
and subversion.

236
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:54,775
How were we supposed
to meet them?

237
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:58,561
With white gloves,
a friendly greeting?

238
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:02,086
A message of surrender
with flowers?

239
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,654
It is a case of charges
and countercharges--

240
00:21:04,698 --> 00:21:06,917
I still don't like it,
Meléndez.

241
00:21:06,961 --> 00:21:08,702
It's aired.

242
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:11,618
I want a piece on the wounded
undercover again, okay?

243
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:14,316
I'm on the phone.

244
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,709
Fuck your preconceptions.

245
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,450
How many times do
I have to tell you,

246
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,016
there are two sides
to every story?

247
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,759
Now, you wanna pick one,
go work for editorial.

248
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:23,891
You still talking to me?

249
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:27,982
Okay, all right.

250
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:30,593
How about a piece
on the undercover agent?

251
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,292
Hey, you remember
the explosives?

252
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:35,555
I just found out the DA's office
is going to announce

253
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,600
there weren't any.

254
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,882
The guy said to just ask.
I'll be back.

255
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,462
¿Dónde vive Fuentes?

256
00:22:13,506 --> 00:22:15,290
Over there, señora.

257
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,857
Gracias.

258
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:08,055
I thought you were
going to be taller.

259
00:24:08,098 --> 00:24:10,057
Nope.

260
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,798
You ever see these?

261
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,669
Heard about it.

262
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:15,454
So they can draw blood
with every strike.

263
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,984
But you didn't come here
to talk about cocks, did you?

264
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:28,641
My 10-year-old likes
dirty words too.

265
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,817
Can someone go get
my crew for me?

266
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,166
Domingo.

267
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,213
All the other reporters
already interviewed me.

268
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:37,519
Where were you?

269
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,260
Other assignments.

270
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:40,609
Because I could
take that personally.

271
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,132
But why bother?

272
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:44,395
True.

273
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,397
So how you doing now?
You look pretty well recovered.

274
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:48,312
Oh, yeah?

275
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,923
You think so, huh?

276
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,712
Check it out.

277
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,029
Pretty impressive, huh?

278
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,815
They just took
the bandages off.

279
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:14,861
Doesn't look so bad to me.

280
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,471
What do you know?

281
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,995
The bullet grazed me.
I could have died, lady.

282
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,302
So you took a taxi up there?

283
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:23,957
How do you know that?

284
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,089
It's in the police report.

285
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,177
DOMINGO:
Here they are.

286
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,572
Let's just do it right here.

287
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,839
I never heard of

288
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:38,711
the Armed Revolutionary Movement
before.

289
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,582
It's a four-man cell,
including myself.

290
00:25:42,062 --> 00:25:43,846
Two are dead, you're a hero.

291
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,108
Who's missing?

292
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,675
Missing?

293
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,636
"Missing."
That's the right word for it.

294
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,333
He went underground
right after the attack.

295
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:54,030
I figure the radical students
are hiding him.

296
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,858
Didn't you
hear this already?

297
00:25:55,902 --> 00:25:57,468
Can you tell me his name?

298
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,993
How come I'm doing
your job for you, Kate?

299
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,995
His name is Nestor Chavez.

300
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,606
Do you ever notice how
it's the assholes in charge

301
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,955
who always get away?

302
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:07,261
That's off the record.

303
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,004
Ready.

304
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,964
You infiltrated
their group, Fuentes.

305
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,140
You knew all their plans.

306
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:19,186
How did they expect
to blow up the transmitter

307
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:20,361
without any explosives?

308
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,147
Without explosives?

309
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,933
According to
the district attorney's office.

310
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,239
They weren't planning
to blow up the tower.

311
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:30,937
They were planning
to sabotage it.

312
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,940
It's a...
It's a question of semantics.

313
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:36,638
They had the guns, the matches,
the fire starters.

314
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:38,814
They were gonna burn down
a metal tower?

315
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:40,424
FUENTES:
We weren't going to give them
the opportunity.

316
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,255
And nobody said
they were intelligent.

317
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,228
MAN:
--in spite of our hard-working
Latin American brother.

318
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:04,492
And therefore,
Puerto Rico must embrace

319
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:08,365
the political and social
aspirations of Latin America,

320
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,280
like in Salvador...MAN: Come to the meeting.

321
00:27:10,324 --> 00:27:12,065
...Cuba and Nicaragua.

322
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:14,720
Ya viva Puerto Rico libre.CROWD: !¡Viva!

323
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,635
!¡Ya viva la independencia
de Puerto Rico!

324
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:18,071
CROWD: !¡Viva!

325
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:24,468
I'm Kate Meléndez,
Channel 74 News.

326
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,035
Yeah, I know.

327
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,776
I'd like to talk
to Mr. Chavez.

328
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,517
I bet.

329
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,258
You and everybody else
in Puerto Rico.

330
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,347
I'm sure you don't know
where he is,

331
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,392
but if you happen to come in
contact with him...

332
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:37,743
You are
Juan Meléndez's widow?

333
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,006
Yes.
Okay.

334
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,661
I'll find out
if he wants to talk to you.

335
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,171
MAN:
Can I help you, miss?

336
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,217
You have a reservation,
right?

337
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,729
Let's talk fast.

338
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,299
You're the head
of the A.R.M.?

339
00:28:56,343 --> 00:28:59,128
Hmph. What a joke.
We didn't have a name.

340
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,782
I saw it in the papers,
I thought,

341
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,218
"What the hell
is that about?"

342
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,351
Fuentes making himself
look good.

343
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:07,093
That's a real Fuentes touch.

344
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,616
You wanna talk
to the guy in charge?

345
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:09,965
Talk to him.
It was his plan.

346
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:11,967
To sabotage the transmitter?

347
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,839
Hmph. Sure.

348
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,842
Except we were going
to sabotage their minds.

349
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,582
Constitution Day, right?

350
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:20,280
We were going to seize
the air waves

351
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:21,847
and broadcast
an Independentista communiqué

352
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,109
to all of Puerto Rico.

353
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,458
That's it?

354
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:25,415
That was the whole idea?

355
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,855
Your husband would have
liked the timing.

356
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,813
Great piece of propaganda, huh?

357
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,120
Fuentes thought it was a little
wimpy, not enough action.

358
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,382
He was always promoting action.

359
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:37,123
He's the one
who got us the guns.

360
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:39,865
He used to say that we were
all show, no go.

361
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,171
And you know what?

362
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,086
They shouldn't have gone.

363
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,566
Why didn't you go, Nestor?

364
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,614
I'd stayed out too late
the night before.

365
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:51,920
MAN:
Let's go, Chavez.

366
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,052
You too, Meléndez.

367
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,098
Let go of me!

368
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,326
No!

369
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:09,242
No! No!

370
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:13,855
No! No!

371
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:16,858
KATE:
No!

372
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,512
No!

373
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:30,306
MAN:
Kate Meléndez!

374
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,482
Kate Meléndez!

375
00:30:32,526 --> 00:30:35,746
WOMAN:
Is that the chick
on Channel 74?

376
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,227
WOMAN 2:
It's not her.

377
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:41,230
I need to call home.
I have children.

378
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,147
I have a right
to a phone call.

379
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:08,649
Is he dead?

380
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:11,173
He may as well be.
He's comatose.

381
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:17,266
Are you gonna cry?

382
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,879
I'm sorry too. I had my suspect
if you hadn't interfered.

383
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:25,318
I didn't interfere.
You used me.

384
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:28,756
Chavez knows a lot of
information that I need.

385
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,498
He was obviously afraid
of how you were going to get it.

386
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,240
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk.

387
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,633
This isn't Chile.
This isn't Cuba.

388
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,418
We're Americans.

389
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:40,420
We operate
under the American law.

390
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:42,378
So you gonna tell me
the charges, then?

391
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:45,991
Every citizen's duty is to
support enforcement of the law.

392
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,949
What are the charges
against me?

393
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,820
Because I've got two kids
at home,

394
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:51,953
and you have no right
holding me here.

395
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,131
I don't like you,
either.

396
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,133
You think you know
what's going on.

397
00:31:58,177 --> 00:32:00,048
But you don't know
a damn thing.

398
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:02,268
You didn't have grounds for
arrest, so resisting arrest--

399
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:04,226
Interfering with
a lawful arrest,

400
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,880
resisting arrest,

401
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,969
assault on a police officer.

402
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,580
So now you're gonna try
and cut me a deal?

403
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:15,977
Get her
out of here.

404
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,457
OFFICER: Sí, capitán.

405
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,071
I have a...

406
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,681
I got a big case
coming up.

407
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:26,422
Yeah. It's a...

408
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:28,598
It involves
a woman who was, uh...

409
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:29,643
Said she was...

410
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,953
COP:
What do you know
about that?

411
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,478
COP:
Yeah, that's
what I said.

412
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,219
But there's
some problem with, uh,

413
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:42,308
proving that it's,
you know, a burden.

414
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,312
COP:
The woman's saying
that there's foul play

415
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,183
between her husband
and the neighbor...

416
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,806
I'm sorry, Daddy.

417
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:07,724
The arrest report came
across at the base.

418
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,988
Mother wanted to invite you
and the kids to dinner.

419
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,077
You didn't tell her.I said you were busy.

420
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,817
I guess
that was the truth.

421
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,864
You're supposed to be
so damn smart.

422
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,561
What were you doing
in a nightclub

423
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,607
with a Cuban terrorist
almost getting yourself killed?

424
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,044
He wasn't Cuban,
he was Puerto Rican.

425
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,046
Right.
That makes sense now.

426
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,265
Daddy.You should've said so.

427
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,617
I was working on a story.

428
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,100
The police set me up
to find the guy for them.

429
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:38,103
My big mistake.
What a waste of money that was.

430
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:40,235
I should never have
sent you to college.

431
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,280
This started there.

432
00:33:42,803 --> 00:33:44,674
I didn't call you
to bail me out.

433
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:48,852
Nice normal kid. I just wanted
to get you out of Puerto Rico.

434
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,463
You came back
with a Puerto Rican.

435
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:52,595
Daddy, don't get started.
Please don't.

436
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:55,207
Not just a Puerto Rican,
a radical-left Puerto Rican.

437
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,340
He was a lawyer
with a cause, so--

438
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:00,255
Don't talk about him.

439
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,042
Was that the attraction?I mean it!

440
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,636
Mommy?

441
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,073
Right here, baby.

442
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,686
Where were you?

443
00:34:39,729 --> 00:34:40,948
You didn't call.

444
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:43,255
I couldn't call.

445
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:45,953
I didn't know
where you were.

446
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,868
I'm right here.

447
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:03,797
Mrs. Meléndez.

448
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,320
Teresa.

449
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:07,583
TERESA:
What brings you back here?

450
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:08,802
Nestor Chavez.

451
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,325
Is this for the news?

452
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,892
I was with him
when it happened.

453
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,589
Oh.

454
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,113
He's in Critical.

455
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:18,768
TERESA: That's the family.

456
00:35:18,812 --> 00:35:21,336
Teresa, will you call me
if there are any changes?

457
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,338
I know it's
against policy, but...

458
00:35:23,382 --> 00:35:25,384
Give me
your number again.

459
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:29,388
I remember how you called
every day.

460
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:32,260
Your husband was the favorite
in the whole unit.

461
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:47,057
I just wanted to ask
about what happened.

462
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,016
Go ask the police.

463
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:51,018
Except they weren't in the car
with you, Don Julio.

464
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,978
I don't want to get
into any more trouble.

465
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:57,459
I've had enough trouble.

466
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,331
See my cab?

467
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:02,116
I can't even work
with a cab like that.

468
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,858
It doesn't pass
regulation.

469
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,208
Police shot up your car,

470
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,992
they ought to pay
for the damage.

471
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:11,908
All I did was to pick up a fare,
and look what happened to me.

472
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,780
Every one of those boys
had a gun.

473
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,390
I wasn't going to argue.

474
00:36:15,434 --> 00:36:17,914
And they made you drive
to Cerro Maravilla?

475
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:19,655
Hey, hey!
No, no, no, no, no.

476
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:21,744
I'm just trying to
explain to you.

477
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,050
All right.
All right.

478
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,574
You guys go wait for me
in the truck.

479
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:30,666
So... you went up
to Cerro Maravilla.

480
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,278
That's my life savings.
That car.

481
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:35,105
Sorry. It's a nice car.

482
00:36:35,149 --> 00:36:38,065
Hmph, it used to be.

483
00:36:38,108 --> 00:36:40,720
I saw the police coming.
I didn't know they were police.

484
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,375
I just saw more guns.

485
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,246
Then...

486
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,813
I tried to get
under the dashboard.

487
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,337
I tried to hide.

488
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,948
Chevys didn't have
such a lot of sheet metal,

489
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,429
I'd be dead myself.

490
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,910
Then the police started
shooting, that first time.

491
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,391
I thought the whole car was
gonna fall apart all around me.

492
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,044
Well, did the police
identify themselves

493
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,873
or shout, "Halt,"
or anything like that?

494
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,788
I couldn't see anything.
I was hiding.

495
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,137
I didn't see anything.

496
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,402
W-well, did you
hear anything

497
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,534
before the police
started shooting...

498
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,362
that first time?

499
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:17,452
I already told the police.
Go. Ask the police.

500
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:19,454
I just--I don't have to talk to you.

501
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:22,022
No. You don't.

502
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:23,284
Thanks anyway.I-I-I--

503
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,720
I haven't said anything,
okay?

504
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:27,810
I don't blame you.

505
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:04,064
How do I look?You look great.

506
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:06,719
I won't be late. There's only
one band playing tonight.

507
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:08,155
Have fun.

508
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,060
We heard
all the shooting.

509
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:45,932
People started
to get scared.

510
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:49,065
Noise carries in the mountains.

511
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:53,200
Everybody had just calmed down when it started again.

512
00:38:53,243 --> 00:38:55,245
You heard
more gunshots?

513
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:57,465
Not as many as the first time.

514
00:38:57,509 --> 00:38:59,815
You couldn't count those.

515
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,296
The second time was

516
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,080
a "bang-bang," and then "bang-bang."

517
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,780
KATE:
Don Jaime,
how long was it

518
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:09,825
between
the two volleys of shots?

519
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:12,001
I had time to finish my lunch.

520
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,743
Ten minutes at least.

521
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:17,137
KATE:
Okay, that's it.

522
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,573
What do the police say?

523
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,183
That they must have
heard hunters.

524
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:23,578
Could've been.
Could've been.

525
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,014
You're gonna use this,
aren't you?

526
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:26,276
I mean,
it's great stuff.

527
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,582
And that's why
I'm gonna use it.

528
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,844
A blind man.

529
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:31,325
You know your two pals,

530
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,632
Professor Rey
and the widow Ruiz?

531
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:34,850
Together, they're suing
the government

532
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:36,417
for 2 and a half...

533
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,462
mil.

534
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:38,593
Good for them.

535
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:39,942
I just got a tip

536
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,379
that the grand jury's
about to be convened.

537
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,510
I don't air tips.

538
00:39:42,554 --> 00:39:44,164
I didn't ask you to,
Howard.

539
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:45,339
I'm just
keeping you informed.

540
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,472
Well,
that's decent of you.

541
00:39:47,515 --> 00:39:48,516
Bye-bye.

542
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,917
DON JAIME :
We heard all the shooting.

543
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,223
WOMAN:
Julio, your food
is getting cold.

544
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:02,269
Everybody had just calmed down when it started again.

545
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,705
You heard more gunshots?

546
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:05,185
Not as many as the first time.

547
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,057
The second time was

548
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:10,582
a "bang-bang," and then "bang-bang."

549
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,411
Don Jaime,
how long was it

550
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,500
between
the two volleys of shots?

551
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:17,458
I had time to finish my lunch.

552
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,505
Ten minutes at least.

553
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:23,421
For Channel 74 News,
Kate Meléndez.

554
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:44,529
Mommy's home!

555
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:48,184
Pepita?

556
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,667
What the hell are you doing
in my house?!

557
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:54,364
Hi, Kate.

558
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,975
Nice place
you got here.

559
00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:00,414
This is
Lieutenant Fuentes.

560
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,590
He's... the one that was
on the television with you.

561
00:41:02,634 --> 00:41:04,331
Pepita,
take them upstairs.

562
00:41:04,374 --> 00:41:05,637
Bye.FUENTES: Good night, Juanito.

563
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,335
Sophie,
sweet dreams, huh?

564
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,122
I just wanted to
talk to you, Kate.

565
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,515
You wanna talk to me,

566
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,343
we'll talk outside,
not in my house.

567
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,302
You're a very
disturbed lady, Kate.

568
00:41:19,346 --> 00:41:21,000
I thought I could try
to explain to you--

569
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,828
Hey, try.

570
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:24,220
Listen to me.

571
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:25,874
Ruiz and Rey
were Communists.

572
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:28,007
They were terrorists,
and you're taking their side.

573
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,443
Not if you're all
telling the truth.

574
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,271
We are supposed
to stop Communism.

575
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:33,752
We were doing our jobs.
Fidel got the word.

576
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:35,580
Now you're trying to make
out like we were murderers.

577
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:36,885
It was self-defense.

578
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,757
Then there's nothing
to worry about.

579
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,498
Okay.

580
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,937
Here's the headlines:

581
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,462
"Cerro Maravilla
is over and out."

582
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:52,597
It's old news. Nobody cares.
Forget about it.

583
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,861
I told them that I would
come to see you, Kate.

584
00:41:55,904 --> 00:41:57,602
Hey.

585
00:41:57,645 --> 00:42:00,605
It could've been somebody else,
you know?

586
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:02,955
How clear do you want me
to make it?

587
00:42:23,715 --> 00:42:26,631
The police dragged me
out of the car.

588
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:28,284
I didn't know
they were police right away.

589
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:30,156
Nobody said so.

590
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:33,115
He started hitting me
with a rifle butt.

591
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:35,596
He said he was going to
shoot me to pieces,

592
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,077
and, Mother of God,
I believed him.

593
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:41,602
He had me on the ground,

594
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:44,562
like the other
two muchachos.

595
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:47,739
They were being kicked
and hit worse than I was.

596
00:42:47,782 --> 00:42:50,132
Had they been shot already?

597
00:42:50,176 --> 00:42:51,569
Yes, but they were alive.

598
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,616
Wait a minute.
Are you saying--?

599
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,878
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.

600
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:58,314
One of the boys said,

601
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:01,056
"Don't hurt the old man.
He isn't involved."

602
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,710
So he stopped hitting me,

603
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,147
and then they brought me over
to a different tower.

604
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:07,367
And that's where I heard
the other shots.

605
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:12,067
Well, why did you
wait so long to talk?

606
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,417
I was afraid.

607
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:16,332
And the police said
they would fix my taxi.

608
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:17,899
KATE:
They didn't?

609
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:20,641
Cheap.

610
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:23,209
Aren't you still afraid?

611
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:25,690
Well, the blind man talked.

612
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,616
CAMERAMAN: Camera ready.PRODUCER: Stand by, Kate.

613
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,356
And...
three, two, one.

614
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,836
Go.The federal grand jury,

615
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,056
which has just been seated,
must now decide

616
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:46,624
whether or not the police action
at Cerro Maravilla

617
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,061
was an ambush that violated
the civil rights

618
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:51,019
of Jorge Rey and Alfredo Ruiz.

619
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,412
This is Kate Meléndez...

620
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:12,519
GOVERNOR:
Terrorists should
know they'll be

621
00:44:12,562 --> 00:44:14,695
received as what they are:

622
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:17,742
Enemies of the people
of Puerto Rico.

623
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,831
The police should be
congratulated

624
00:44:19,874 --> 00:44:22,311
for this act of courage.

625
00:44:22,355 --> 00:44:25,663
This investigation and
the grand jury will prove it.

626
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,708
ANCHORMAN:
Governor Villanueva
went on to call for a...

627
00:44:27,752 --> 00:44:30,798
Why don't you look
like that on air? Hmm?

628
00:44:30,842 --> 00:44:33,105
Because you didn't hire me
for my looks.

629
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:35,411
Well, they didn't hurt.

630
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,588
God, a compliment.

631
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:40,242
So...

632
00:44:40,286 --> 00:44:41,243
where you going?

633
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:42,418
It's my birthday.

634
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,682
My parents are
taking me out.

635
00:44:44,725 --> 00:44:46,422
Hot date.

636
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,079
Happy birthday, Meléndez.

637
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,951
You're kidding me.

638
00:44:54,779 --> 00:44:55,693
Open it.

639
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:08,053
God, it's beautiful.

640
00:45:09,663 --> 00:45:11,491
Did you pick this out?

641
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,145
Put it in your bag,
get out of here.

642
00:45:13,188 --> 00:45:14,363
Go have a happy birthday.

643
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:18,019
Thank you, Howard.

644
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,667
No! No! No!

645
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:48,893
You got me in
a lot of trouble, Kate.

646
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,076
No.

647
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:54,262
I'm not stupid.

648
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:58,919
I didn't
violate you, Kate.

649
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:08,929
Actually, I'm a pretty nice guy
when you're not around.

650
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,670
You don't bring out
my best side.

651
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:12,063
That's the truth.

652
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:15,457
And it's such a waste,
Kate,

653
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:17,764
because I'm gonna
come out of this clean.

654
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:21,333
Okay, sure, the grand jury's
a big embarrassment, but...

655
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:23,030
I'll figure that out.

656
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:26,686
That's how it is.

657
00:48:32,735 --> 00:48:34,433
I like you, Kate.

658
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:52,712
JUANITO & SOPHIE:
Happy birthday to you ♪

659
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:57,021
Happy birthday to you ♪

660
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:01,895
Happy birthday, dear Mommy ♪

661
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:06,160
Happy birthday to you ♪

662
00:49:06,204 --> 00:49:08,902
Make a wish, Mommy.
Make a wish.

663
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:27,703
I'm sorry about
the kids, honey.

664
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:30,097
They were just dying
to wake you up.

665
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:46,940
I'm going to
back off the story.

666
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,550
End of problem.

667
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:50,596
That's not like you, Kate.

668
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,428
If you're right about
what happened on the mountain,

669
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:58,038
then the truth
is bound to come out.

670
00:49:58,082 --> 00:50:00,040
Oh, Mom.

671
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:01,520
No, I believe that.

672
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:03,826
You're so American.

673
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,654
You're such an optimist.

674
00:50:05,698 --> 00:50:07,917
You gotta base your life
on positive values, baby.

675
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:10,877
Now, we've always done that.

676
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:38,818
Shit.

677
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:42,822
ANCHORMAN: We interrupt this program for a special WPRN news bulletin.

678
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:45,564
The U.S. Justice Department just sent home the grand jury,

679
00:50:45,607 --> 00:50:48,567
which has been hearing evidence
in the Cerro Maravilla case.

680
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,874
And so the investigation ends
without an indictment.

681
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,572
In Washington today,

682
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,878
a spokesman for
the Justice Department said,

683
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:58,838
"The allegations were not
supported by the evidence,"

684
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,536
which is welcome news to
the police officers involved.

685
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:04,017
Nestor Chavez, the student

686
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,975
who was shot
resisting arrest, died today.

687
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,542
The police were unable to get

688
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,370
a statement from him
for the grand jury.

689
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:12,591
This is Kate Meléndez
for Channel 74 News.

690
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,834
What are you doing here?

691
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,187
You don't belong here.

692
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,148
You killed him!

693
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:34,194
You killed him!

694
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,279
KATE :
I-- I kept watching

695
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:17,542
to see if anyone was following.

696
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:20,197
I didn't see anybody.

697
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,027
I led the cops straight to him.

698
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:28,074
I mean, Chavez would be alive
if he hadn't trusted me.

699
00:53:28,117 --> 00:53:31,512
Well, that's not
necessarily true.

700
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:35,386
I'm Juan Meléndez's widow.
The movement's main lawyer.

701
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:39,607
Juan would have known
he was being followed.

702
00:53:39,651 --> 00:53:41,435
All right,
Chavez went for the cop's gun.

703
00:53:41,479 --> 00:53:44,264
That was a decision, see?
That's not your fault.

704
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:46,223
No, but it wouldn't
have happened.

705
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:49,138
Somebody will break soon.

706
00:53:49,182 --> 00:53:51,750
I mean, too many people
know about it.

707
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:53,230
Well...

708
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:55,057
not when Frank Curtin's
a player, they won't.

709
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:56,885
Frank?

710
00:53:56,929 --> 00:53:58,800
Yeah. Let me tell you
something.

711
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:00,933
Why do you think he was
up at Cerro Maravilla?

712
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:03,283
Damage control.

713
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:06,634
Yeah, but how about damage?

714
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:09,115
You mean Frank Curtin
was involved in this?

715
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:10,595
Well, he sure as hell
wasn't

716
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:11,900
just taking
a walk in the woods.

717
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:17,166
I'm not backing
off the story, Howard.

718
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,516
Because of Chavez?

719
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:19,517
No.

720
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,996
O-okay, yes!

721
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,695
I mean, I don't give a shit
it was an accident!

722
00:54:23,738 --> 00:54:25,784
Rey and Ruiz weren't...

723
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,568
I mean, cops shouldn't
get away with murder

724
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:29,004
just because they're cops!

725
00:54:29,048 --> 00:54:32,181
Spare me the principles,
please. Please.

726
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:34,227
You're not listening.

727
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,229
Now, what do they have to do?
Kill you too?

728
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,231
For you to get five minutes
on the evening news?

729
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,277
This isn't about the news,
Howard!

730
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,017
Nothing is worth dying for.

731
00:54:42,061 --> 00:54:44,455
Guarantee. Nothing!

732
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:46,195
Nobody'd even remember you,
kiddo.

733
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,808
There'd be a long obituary
and a short investigation.

734
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:51,636
Now, your kids spend Sundays
at the cemetery,

735
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,334
and the lady selling flowers
makes a little extra change.

736
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:55,596
That's the only difference.

737
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,425
The story goes away,
in any case.

738
00:54:58,469 --> 00:55:01,646
Are you worrying about me,
Howard...

739
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:02,821
or Frank?

740
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:07,652
I don't give a fuck
about Frank Curtin!

741
00:55:08,957 --> 00:55:10,829
Except the guy's obviously...

742
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,787
cutting his own story.

743
00:55:12,831 --> 00:55:14,833
And I don't wanna see
anything else happen to you.

744
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,835
I hired you, I trained you.
Shit, I even like you.

745
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:18,924
You're not gonna die
while you're working for me.

746
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:20,926
That's it.

747
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:22,188
You're off the air.
That's it!

748
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,322
You're firing me?!
No!

749
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:27,149
I'm protecting you!

750
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:28,847
Come on, Howard!

751
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,632
And I shouldn't have told you
about him, should I?

752
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:35,506
I had the idea you were
a rational person.

753
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:37,377
Now, if you wanna work
as a news writer,

754
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:38,987
I'll hire you
as associate producer.

755
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,337
That's it.

756
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,164
But you're taking away
the mike.

757
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,907
I-I'll jump stations.

758
00:55:45,951 --> 00:55:47,561
Do it. Fine.

759
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:49,389
I'll give the eulogy.

760
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:02,315
I still think you're
looking out for him, Howard.

761
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,273
Okay.Not me.

762
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,287
To constitute a federal
civil-rights offense,

763
00:56:18,331 --> 00:56:20,159
it has to be proven

764
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:23,336
that the force used
was excessive, deliberate

765
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,599
and not the result
of accident

766
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:30,038
or mistake or negligence
or reasonable responsive action.

767
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:31,997
Now, especially since
the federal grand jury--

768
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,955
That's a pretty piece
of work, isn't it?

769
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:35,914
They heard
a lot of witnesses.

770
00:56:35,957 --> 00:56:37,742
They wanted to believe
the cops.

771
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:39,787
Maybe the cops
were more believable.

772
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:42,050
Except they had
a reason to lie.

773
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,617
The cab driver didn't.

774
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:46,490
Neither did the blind man.
You know about the bruises?

775
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:48,709
They fell down an embankment
when they were shot.

776
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:50,494
I was up there.
There's no embankment.

777
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:52,060
So, what are you
trying to tell me?

778
00:56:52,104 --> 00:56:53,758
That the police
were hot-doggers

779
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:56,674
who decided to save the public
the cost of a trial?

780
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,545
It's an election year.

781
00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:00,242
I think somebody decided

782
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:02,854
to scare the voters
into the governor's corner.

783
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:04,116
He's big on law and order.

784
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,902
Somebody like the FBI?

785
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:09,861
You know Frank Curtin?

786
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,080
Sure.

787
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:14,039
I taped him
up at Cerro Maravilla.

788
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:15,475
I still have the outtakes.

789
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,217
Okay, he was up there. So?
You were too.

790
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,001
Yeah, but you know him.

791
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,438
I think he took

792
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,222
a general directive
to back the governor

793
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:24,702
a little too literally.

794
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:26,486
What would happen

795
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:30,751
if an FBI agent is suspected
of civil-rights violations?

796
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:33,798
You know who investigates
for my division? The FBI.

797
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:38,367
I wanna jerk around,
I'll stay at home, lady.

798
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,336
Bye, sweetheart.Bye, Mom.

799
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:51,598
Sophie!

800
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:54,079
Where's my kiss?

801
00:57:54,122 --> 00:57:55,733
Thank you.Bye, Mom.

802
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:06,700
Wanna get a cup of coffee
or something?

803
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:09,311
Man, I don't even wanna be
on the same sidewalk with you.

804
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:11,705
I was at Cerro Maravilla
doing my job, you know?

805
00:58:11,749 --> 00:58:13,838
It went down,
they called me.

806
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:15,883
I work with the police.

807
00:58:15,927 --> 00:58:17,363
Now, you wanna know
something about that,

808
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,104
you could've come to me
and asked me.

809
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:21,846
You could've come to me.
You should've come to me, Kate.

810
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:25,327
I have to hear about it from
some... goddamn internal memo

811
00:58:25,371 --> 00:58:27,547
from the Civil Rights Division?
What were you doing?

812
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,027
To listen to Ms. Foster,

813
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:30,985
you implicated me
in a criminal act.

814
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:32,291
Would you please
just listen to me?

815
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:34,336
You don't get it,
do you?!

816
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,861
Maybe I do.

817
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:52,790
An update on the election results.

818
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,356
The latest precincts reporting in

819
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,880
now show the opposition candidate

820
00:58:55,923 --> 00:58:59,144
leading over Villanueva by 9,000 votes.

821
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:01,494
And with the polls closing in the next hour,

822
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,888
we should be getting closer to a final result.

823
00:59:03,931 --> 00:59:05,759
In other local news, a fire--

824
00:59:05,803 --> 00:59:07,326
Two milks, please.

825
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:08,675
Coke for me.

826
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:10,111
Two milks.

827
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:12,026
What--?
What happened?

828
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:14,638
Looks like
a power failure.

829
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:16,596
Hmmm, this is
kind of spooky.

830
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:21,427
Mom?
Hmm?

831
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,256
Why does Grandpa say
you're not Puerto Rican?

832
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,214
I'm Puerto Rican
by marriage.

833
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:29,348
Your dad's family lives
in New York now,

834
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:31,480
but he was born in San Juan,
just like you guys.

835
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:33,613
Does that make us
Puerto Rican?

836
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,223
Sure you are.

837
00:59:35,267 --> 00:59:36,660
I'm American.

838
00:59:39,097 --> 00:59:40,359
No, you're not.
You're not American.

839
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:42,230
Because I'm white.

840
00:59:42,274 --> 00:59:43,623
Pepita said.

841
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:45,407
Pepita made a mistake.

842
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:48,062
You're American because
every Puerto Rican is American.

843
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,673
ANCHORMAN: And as the computers

844
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:51,544
come back online,
a surprising development

845
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,286
has pushed
Governor Villanueva ahead.

846
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:56,114
And it seems only
a matter of time

847
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:58,638
before the opposition party
concedes.

848
00:59:58,682 --> 00:59:59,987
Governor Villanueva's supporters

849
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:01,423
are already beginning to celebrate

850
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:04,992
at the city hall in Plaza de las Almas.

851
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:16,743
Give me one!Give me one!

852
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:18,615
All right!

853
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,448
Hey, hey, guys.

854
01:00:26,492 --> 01:00:27,798
Look who's here.Where's Mommy?

855
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:29,147
How you doing?Over there.

856
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:33,325
ASENCIO: Hey.Hi. How are you?

857
01:00:33,368 --> 01:00:34,500
Surprise!

858
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:35,675
How are you?

859
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:36,894
How'd you like
the blackout?

860
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,635
Does it come
any more convenient?

861
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:39,810
They're not even waiting
for the opposition to concede.

862
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,550
Like he needs to.

863
01:00:41,594 --> 01:00:44,162
At least we're gonna have
an opposition congress.

864
01:00:44,205 --> 01:00:45,685
Let's go.

865
01:00:45,729 --> 01:00:46,991
This is Lila Torres.

866
01:00:48,514 --> 01:00:49,689
I-- I'm Kate Meléndez.

867
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,038
I know.

868
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:52,605
I recognized you.
Hi, Kate.

869
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,085
Hi.

870
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:56,217
Let's go.Bye, Kate.

871
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,871
Bye.

872
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,787
MAN:
Which kind do you prefer?

873
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,050
The $1,000 type
or the $999 type...

874
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:48,226
Mommy.

875
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,402
BULLWINKLE:
I'd like something
right in the middle...

876
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:51,620
It's good.

877
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:54,754
Like it?

878
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:57,365
BULLWINKLE:
...is bound to run into
an occasional obstacle.

879
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:59,237
MAN 2:
Yes, sir?

880
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,108
BULLWINKLE: I'd like a loan.MAN 3: Any collateral?

881
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:02,631
Ah!

882
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,764
Sophie, you watch cartoons
or you do my hair.

883
01:02:04,808 --> 01:02:07,114
Okay, Mom.

884
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:11,249
MAN 4:
This is a stick-up!

885
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,121
ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this program

886
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:16,167
for a special
WPRN news bulletin.

887
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:17,995
ANCHORWOMAN:
The Puerto Rican Senate
has passed a bill

888
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,213
to open public hearingsStop.

889
01:02:19,257 --> 01:02:21,128
into the shooting deaths

890
01:02:21,172 --> 01:02:23,348
of the two alleged terrorists
at Cerro Maravilla.

891
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:26,220
A special prosecutor will be appointed as there was

892
01:02:26,264 --> 01:02:28,353
for the Watergate hearings
in Washington.

893
01:02:28,396 --> 01:02:31,748
A comparison is being made
in the halls of the Senate.

894
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,272
Governor Villanueva immediately called the investigation

895
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:36,448
a political witch hunt.

896
01:02:36,491 --> 01:02:38,842
I'm Lila Torres.
This was a special newsbreak.

897
01:02:38,885 --> 01:02:42,019
ANNOUNCER:
And now back
to our regular program.

898
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:44,064
BULLWINKLE:
But, Your Highness,
this is all a mistake.

899
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:09,002
In his last nine appearances,

900
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:13,050
Yabucoa's Julio Chumbo
is 2-to-nothing, with two saves.

901
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:15,530
In another game,
Cataño's Marcos Rodriguez

902
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:17,837
allowed only one double hit
in the top of the ninth inning

903
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:21,232
and obtained victory
for his team over Vega Baja.

904
01:03:21,275 --> 01:03:23,843
This is Fernando Quinones
for WSTR-TV,

905
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:26,846
San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Buenas noche.

906
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,591
MAN: That's a wrap.MAN 2: Wanna kill the lights?

907
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:34,854
How you doing?
Good to see you.

908
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:35,986
Good to see you.

909
01:03:36,029 --> 01:03:37,770
Please,
come into my office.

910
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,511
MAN 3:
Okay, let's set up for...

911
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:40,729
It's certainly been hot,
hasn't it?

912
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,122
Yes.

913
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:43,471
Have a seat, please.Thank you.

914
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,694
Oh, I'm Fernando Quinones,
the station owner.

915
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:49,651
Kate Meléndez.

916
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:54,047
I was surprised to hear
from you, Kate.

917
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:55,744
I thought about
calling you, but...

918
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:57,703
I didn't think
I had a chance.

919
01:03:57,746 --> 01:04:01,359
This is not, uh,
Channel 74, you know.

920
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,664
No, thanks.

921
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:05,276
But I can
make you an anchor.

922
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:08,235
Which is more than
Howard ever did.

923
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:09,846
You can have my job.

924
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:13,240
Well, actually, I--
I've got a programming idea.

925
01:04:14,241 --> 01:04:15,416
When do you wanna start?

926
01:04:17,157 --> 01:04:18,506
What about airing
the Senate hearings?

927
01:04:19,899 --> 01:04:22,728
The Cerro Maravilla hearings?

928
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:24,904
I could do the commentary.

929
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,602
Huh.
Wouldn't I love to, but, uh--

930
01:04:27,646 --> 01:04:29,735
You don't run government ads.
I've been watching.

931
01:04:29,778 --> 01:04:32,085
I'm practically on
the subversive list right now.

932
01:04:32,129 --> 01:04:35,045
But I can't afford to cancel
any of my regular programming.

933
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:37,177
If you had a sponsor?

934
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:39,788
Like the opposition party.

935
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,185
KATE:
We put together
a budget to show you

936
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:46,926
what it would cost
to go live.

937
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,015
The hearings will become
a big media event,

938
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:51,713
and you, the opposition party,
will get the benefit of it.

939
01:04:53,715 --> 01:04:56,370
The thing with television is
you get 100-percent saturation.

940
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:57,850
You reach Puerto Rico.

941
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:00,026
And you're never quoted
out of context.

942
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:02,594
MAN:
Well, the numbers look good.
What do you think?

943
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,248
MAN 2:
Looks fine to me.

944
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,684
Kate...

945
01:05:05,727 --> 01:05:07,947
this is our special prosecutor,
Luis Angel Mora.

946
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:10,254
Kate Meléndez,
now from WSTR.

947
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,473
Channel 88.I'm still a fan.

948
01:05:12,517 --> 01:05:14,040
Luis, we have
the opportunity

949
01:05:14,084 --> 01:05:15,433
of airing the hearings
in their entirety.

950
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:18,131
Stop.Live. Without commercials.

951
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:20,481
I-it worked for Watergate.

952
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,225
The hearings have a chance,
don't they?

953
01:05:25,269 --> 01:05:26,966
Yes.

954
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,968
But if the police version
turns out to be true,

955
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,317
we're going to
have to endorse

956
01:05:30,361 --> 01:05:31,623
the Justice Department's
investigation

957
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:33,886
and close the case.

958
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,019
But I will admit,
in going over the reports,

959
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:37,759
I found a lot
of inconsistencies.

960
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:39,065
Such as?

961
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:41,894
Well, Alfredo Ruiz
was killed with a shotgun,

962
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,592
Jorge Rey with a .45.

963
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:46,507
That's according
to the autopsies.

964
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,901
Now nobody seems to know
where the guns are.

965
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,599
Did you know that there was
an FBI agent up there?

966
01:05:51,643 --> 01:05:52,731
Who?
Frank Curtin.

967
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,080
Frank Curtin was up there?Yep.

968
01:05:54,124 --> 01:05:55,299
Before or after?

969
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:56,822
Well, he was there
when I arrived,

970
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,302
and they hadn't even loaded
the bodies yet.

971
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:00,521
Did you see the bodies?They were covered.

972
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,567
Because either
they were killed instantly,

973
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:04,047
and that cab driver's lying,

974
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:05,962
or he isn't.

975
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,789
We'll soon find out.

976
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,880
Excuse me if I seem
a bit apprehensive,

977
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:14,883
but I'm used to the rules
of the court about publicity.

978
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:16,668
I don't like arguing my case
in the media.

979
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:18,409
You're not.

980
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,628
You're just getting the public
into public hearings.

981
01:06:20,672 --> 01:06:23,022
I mean, how many people
can you seat in a hearing room?

982
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:25,068
You're as glib
as a lawyer.

983
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:27,940
Yeah, well, my husband
was a lawyer.

984
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,857
Juan Meléndez?Yes.

985
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,946
Good attorney.

986
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,253
I'm, uh... sorry.

987
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,907
This is me.Yeah, uh, better go.

988
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,345
Pleasure meeting you.And you.

989
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:25,867
MAN:
This is your seat,
Professor Rey.

990
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,130
Thank you.

991
01:07:40,273 --> 01:07:42,710
What's this about?ASENCIO: Hey.

992
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:44,321
Job change.You guys quit?

993
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:46,062
Yep.

994
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:48,760
Coming out in 20 seconds.Good.

995
01:07:51,415 --> 01:07:53,808
Stand by.Coming.

996
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:54,809
I can't believe
you're here.

997
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:58,030
Three, two, one.
Go.

998
01:07:58,074 --> 01:08:00,554
On July 25th, 1978,

999
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:02,034
Jorge Rey

1000
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,862
and Alfredo Ruiz
were shot to death

1001
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:06,125
by the police
in Cerro Maravilla.

1002
01:08:06,169 --> 01:08:08,171
How and why are the questions

1003
01:08:08,214 --> 01:08:10,738
before the Senate committee
in these hearings.

1004
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:13,698
Were Rey and Ruiz
Castro-backed terrorists

1005
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,613
caught in an act of sabotage

1006
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:18,137
who tried to shoot it out
with the police and lost?

1007
01:08:18,181 --> 01:08:20,487
Or were they
Independentista students

1008
01:08:20,531 --> 01:08:23,273
set up by an undercover agent
and led into an ambush

1009
01:08:23,316 --> 01:08:25,362
that was politically motivated?

1010
01:08:25,405 --> 01:08:26,754
Was there a cover-up?

1011
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:29,714
And if there was,
how high did it go?

1012
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:35,023
Are you ready,
Mr. Prosecutor?

1013
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:36,808
Mr. Senate President,
point of order.

1014
01:08:38,505 --> 01:08:41,726
The chair recognizes
the honorable Senator Balboa.

1015
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:43,380
I want to call a floor vote

1016
01:08:43,423 --> 01:08:45,860
to end these proceedings
on constitutional grounds.

1017
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:48,428
SENATE PRESIDENT:
Noted and rejected.

1018
01:08:48,472 --> 01:08:50,126
Call your witness,
Mr. Prosecutor.

1019
01:08:51,518 --> 01:08:53,172
I call Julio Dominguez.

1020
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:33,560
Don Julio.

1021
01:09:33,604 --> 01:09:36,302
You told a reporter that Rey
and Ruiz were wounded but alive

1022
01:09:36,346 --> 01:09:37,782
when the shooting stopped.

1023
01:09:37,825 --> 01:09:39,392
Yes, sir."Yes, sir."

1024
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:41,786
Well, I have
a police report here

1025
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:43,962
stating that both men...

1026
01:09:44,005 --> 01:09:45,224
were killed instantly.

1027
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:47,400
Not unless dead men talk.

1028
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,482
What is that?

1029
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:27,919
Not unless dead men talk.

1030
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:29,921
Get out.
REY: Hey, don't
hurt the old man!

1031
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:31,705
He's not involved!

1032
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:35,535
Shut up!

1033
01:10:37,711 --> 01:10:40,148
BALBOA:
This is the first time we've heard about this finger.

1034
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:41,280
It's not in your statement,

1035
01:10:41,324 --> 01:10:42,977
Mr. Dominguez.

1036
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,762
Even when you changed
your statement for the press,

1037
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:46,764
you didn't mention
your finger.

1038
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,026
SENATE PRESIDENT:
Senator, would you

1039
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:49,419
lower your voice,
please?

1040
01:10:49,462 --> 01:10:50,942
You're berating
the witness.

1041
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:53,814
BALBOA:
Which finger did you say
was injured?

1042
01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:54,815
Was it this finger?

1043
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:56,077
What about this finger?!

1044
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:57,296
SENATE PRESIDENT: Senator!

1045
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,516
BALBOA: You are the number one liar.

1046
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:01,213
I am telling
the truth.

1047
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,475
BALBOA: Which finger?

1048
01:11:02,519 --> 01:11:04,303
You think he's
telling the truth?

1049
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:06,262
Sí, sí.

1050
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:14,661
I have no further questions.

1051
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:16,533
SENATE PRESIDENT:
You're excused,
Mr. Dominguez.

1052
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:25,237
These hearings are adjourned
until tomorrow.

1053
01:11:31,069 --> 01:11:33,550
MORA:
Dr. Salazar.

1054
01:11:33,593 --> 01:11:35,334
How many autopsies
would you say

1055
01:11:35,378 --> 01:11:37,162
you've performed
in your career?

1056
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:38,598
An estimate.

1057
01:11:38,642 --> 01:11:41,993
SALAZAR: More than 17,000.

1058
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:43,560
17,000.

1059
01:11:43,603 --> 01:11:45,910
Two of which were
the autopsies

1060
01:11:45,953 --> 01:11:48,913
for the police on Jorge Rey
and Alfredo Ruiz.

1061
01:11:49,957 --> 01:11:52,612
Correct.

1062
01:11:52,656 --> 01:11:55,398
Doctor, what would you say
was the cause of death?

1063
01:11:55,441 --> 01:11:57,661
Multiple gunshot wounds.

1064
01:11:57,704 --> 01:12:00,359
Multiple gunshot wounds.

1065
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:02,361
Were there any other
signs of trauma?

1066
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:03,928
No, sir.

1067
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:08,411
Excuse me? What?

1068
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:11,588
I found no other
antemortem trauma.

1069
01:12:11,631 --> 01:12:13,894
You found no cuts,

1070
01:12:13,938 --> 01:12:16,506
no lacerations, no bruises,
no abrasions?

1071
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:18,159
Mr. Senate President,

1072
01:12:18,203 --> 01:12:20,031
the prosecutor
is leading his own witness.

1073
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:22,381
I withdraw the question.
Doctor...

1074
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:23,948
let me refresh
your memory.

1075
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:26,994
Get the shot.

1076
01:12:48,146 --> 01:12:49,495
Is it true or no

1077
01:12:49,539 --> 01:12:51,192
that these injuries
are signs of trauma?

1078
01:12:51,236 --> 01:12:53,325
I said I found
no antemortem trauma

1079
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:55,196
other than the round,
penetrating wounds,

1080
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:57,373
"antemortem"
meaning "beforedeath."

1081
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,418
Oh, I think I understand
the word, doctor.

1082
01:12:59,462 --> 01:13:01,855
The postmortem injuries
are consistent

1083
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:03,509
with the bodies falling down
an embankment,

1084
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:05,598
as the police described!

1085
01:13:19,743 --> 01:13:21,788
Why did you join the
Armed Revolutionary Movement?

1086
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,792
I was never
an Independentista.

1087
01:13:25,836 --> 01:13:27,794
I was an informer

1088
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:29,622
and, after that,

1089
01:13:29,666 --> 01:13:33,670
an agent for the police.

1090
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:35,585
MORA:
So you were assigned
to infiltrate the group.

1091
01:13:35,628 --> 01:13:39,023
I was told to find
a terrorist group,

1092
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,416
and I did.

1093
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:42,113
By whom?

1094
01:13:43,244 --> 01:13:44,245
By whom?
Who told you?

1095
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,339
I'm not sure now. It's--
It's been a long time.

1096
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:53,124
MORA:
You're not sure.

1097
01:13:56,823 --> 01:13:58,651
Did you ever work
for the FBI?

1098
01:13:58,695 --> 01:14:00,348
BALBOA:
Mr. Prosecutor,
what's the object

1099
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:01,654
of this line of questioning?

1100
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:03,177
MORA:
Senator, I'm trying
to establish

1101
01:14:03,221 --> 01:14:04,962
whether or not
the police were acting alone.

1102
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:06,877
This is pure hysteria.

1103
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,183
The FBI is an unimpeachable

1104
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:11,098
federal institution.

1105
01:14:11,142 --> 01:14:12,535
Mr. Senate President,

1106
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,711
I ask for a vote of censure.

1107
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:15,973
Overruled.

1108
01:14:16,016 --> 01:14:18,802
MORA:
Thank you, Mr. President.

1109
01:14:18,845 --> 01:14:21,457
Is it true or no,
did you ever work for the FBI?

1110
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,373
No.

1111
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:26,636
I work for the police.

1112
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:32,598
You work for the police.

1113
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:38,648
So you set up Rey and Ruiz
for the police.

1114
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,479
You're trying to entrap me.

1115
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,089
No, that was your job, son.

1116
01:14:45,132 --> 01:14:47,352
Didn't you buy the guns
for Alfredo Ruiz and Jorge Rey?

1117
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:53,576
Everything I ever did
was out of patriotism.

1118
01:14:53,619 --> 01:14:56,056
I am an American,
and I love my country.

1119
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,363
Answer the question.
Is it true or no?

1120
01:14:58,406 --> 01:15:01,627
Sometimes, you have to
bend things a little

1121
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:02,976
to protect the public

1122
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:05,413
and--
And the national security.

1123
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:11,115
I have a purchase receipt here
for those guns

1124
01:15:11,158 --> 01:15:13,334
made out to your name.

1125
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:15,119
Could you answer the question?
Is it true or no?

1126
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,213
It's a simple question,
answer it. Is it true or no?

1127
01:15:52,373 --> 01:15:54,158
You're the one feeding him
that crap about the FBI.

1128
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,594
Let go.

1129
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,597
You should be careful, Kate.

1130
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:03,863
Who did you think
I was working for?

1131
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:05,735
You're never gonna nail Frank.

1132
01:16:05,778 --> 01:16:07,650
He's too smart.

1133
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,173
If he were real smart,

1134
01:16:09,216 --> 01:16:11,392
we wouldn't be
standing here in the Senate.

1135
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:16,746
Nice suit.

1136
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:31,456
MORA:
Dr. Martin.

1137
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:33,545
You're a professor
of forensic science

1138
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:36,069
at Texas A&M University.That's correct.

1139
01:16:36,113 --> 01:16:38,028
And you're a specialist
in gunshot wounds.

1140
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:40,639
I've just published a book
on that subject.

1141
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:44,643
Now, you've had a chance
to examine the autopsy reports

1142
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:46,950
and the clothing
of the deceased.

1143
01:16:46,993 --> 01:16:48,604
That's
correct.

1144
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:53,957
Can you summarize
your conclusions?

1145
01:16:55,698 --> 01:16:58,657
MARTIN:
Mr. Ruiz was killed by a shotgun

1146
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:01,529
used at a distance
of no more than 4 feet

1147
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:03,444
while he was...
kneeling on both knees.

1148
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,666
The clothes were soaked
with massive amounts of blood

1149
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:09,842
from the chest
down to the knees,

1150
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:12,976
but no blood below that.

1151
01:17:13,019 --> 01:17:15,021
The person who fired
must have been

1152
01:17:15,065 --> 01:17:17,763
standing over the deceased

1153
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:20,897
because of the downward
trajectory of the pellets.

1154
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,942
Doctor,
the police report states

1155
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:25,031
that they were firing
from a prone position.

1156
01:17:25,075 --> 01:17:27,425
No, I'm sorry, that's--

1157
01:17:27,468 --> 01:17:28,905
That's just not
physically possible.

1158
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,519
KATE:
Apparently,
the evidence just given

1159
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:36,826
by the American professor
of forensic science,

1160
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:38,828
Dr. Martin,
has angered some senators

1161
01:17:38,871 --> 01:17:40,786
of the investigating committee.

1162
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,788
It seems to be
the same group of senators

1163
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:44,094
who have opposed these hearings from the beginning.

1164
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:48,141
Excuse the interruptions,
doctor.

1165
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:53,059
What about Jorge Rey?

1166
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:55,801
Mr. Rey was struck by four shots
from a revolver.

1167
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:56,976
The first one broke

1168
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,022
the right femur
just below the hip,

1169
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:01,415
causing him
to fall to the right.

1170
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:04,201
The second struck
the left kneecap.

1171
01:18:04,244 --> 01:18:07,334
A third entered his chest.

1172
01:18:07,378 --> 01:18:09,685
And a fourth
penetrated his heart.

1173
01:18:15,647 --> 01:18:17,605
I have
no further questions.

1174
01:18:21,348 --> 01:18:24,134
I am very, very surprised.

1175
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:26,310
If the witness is not mistaken,

1176
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:28,747
then I have been deceived
by the police

1177
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,968
the same way the grand jury and the Justice Department were.

1178
01:18:32,011 --> 01:18:33,926
ANCHORMAN: Moving to international news,

1179
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:36,842
demonstrations continued today against the shah of Iran.

1180
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:38,757
Thousands of people flood the streets of Tehran...

1181
01:18:40,193 --> 01:18:41,586
...calling for an end to the shah's rule.

1182
01:18:43,153 --> 01:18:44,937
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the shah denied reports

1183
01:18:44,981 --> 01:18:46,460
that members of the government

1184
01:18:46,504 --> 01:18:48,811
were transferring assets out of the country

1185
01:18:48,854 --> 01:18:51,335
as the political stability has forced them to.

1186
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:54,207
Also in international news...

1187
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:01,345
I'm Nelson Machado.

1188
01:19:01,388 --> 01:19:03,564
I'm the cop
who hit the cab driver.

1189
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:06,263
Jesus, he looked like
he was part of it.

1190
01:19:06,306 --> 01:19:08,613
How was I supposed to know?

1191
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:13,400
I didn't think
I hit him that hard.

1192
01:19:13,444 --> 01:19:14,924
He can identify me.

1193
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:16,664
You've got a problem.

1194
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:18,797
Can I come in?

1195
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:21,539
I don't think so.

1196
01:19:21,582 --> 01:19:23,541
You're the only person
that I can talk to

1197
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:26,674
that I know won't
talk to the department.

1198
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:29,155
I didn't kill anybody.

1199
01:19:31,201 --> 01:19:32,506
If I can get immunity...

1200
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,209
Officer Machado,

1201
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:41,428
is it true or no
that you lied to the grand jury?

1202
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:43,126
He's lying
right this minute.

1203
01:19:44,344 --> 01:19:45,781
I was thinking
of my friends.

1204
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:48,174
So yes,
you did lie.

1205
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:51,177
They were involved
by accident.

1206
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:53,658
One of them is
my brother-in-law.

1207
01:19:54,877 --> 01:19:56,835
They're not evil.

1208
01:19:56,879 --> 01:19:59,098
These are agents who served
the police of Puerto Rico

1209
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:01,274
well over the years.

1210
01:20:01,318 --> 01:20:04,277
I was just thinking
of my friends.

1211
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,326
They're not responsible
for what happened.

1212
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:11,415
And what did happen?

1213
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:16,072
Everybody was firing.

1214
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:18,552
Fuentes got... shot up.

1215
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:20,337
!¡Basta! !Basta!

1216
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,338
MACHADO:
I thought we'd killed him.

1217
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:26,560
Rey and Ruiz threw
their guns out.

1218
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:30,303
I went over to them.

1219
01:20:33,219 --> 01:20:36,527
And Ruiz, he started to say
how he wanted to work for us.

1220
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,876
I could infiltrate-- Ah!

1221
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,705
He said,

1222
01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:42,707
"I can be an agent
for the police."

1223
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,144
This isn't testimony,
it's a performance.

1224
01:20:45,188 --> 01:20:47,407
The man has been coached.

1225
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,192
Aren't you trying
to save yourself

1226
01:20:49,235 --> 01:20:51,107
from a perjury charge,
officer?

1227
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,673
You're earning your immunity,
aren't--?

1228
01:20:52,717 --> 01:20:54,240
Senator!

1229
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:07,993
MACHADO: The both of them never even fired their guns.

1230
01:21:09,342 --> 01:21:12,302
We did that afterwards...

1231
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:14,260
for the ballistics tests.

1232
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:18,264
So the story would hold up.

1233
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:24,967
Somebody gave the order to fire.

1234
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,230
Who gave the order?

1235
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:36,674
Who gave the order to fire?

1236
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:39,329
I don't know.

1237
01:21:39,372 --> 01:21:42,201
I don't know
who gave the order.

1238
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:13,319
I'm an agent! Don't shoot me!
I'm an agent! Don't--

1239
01:22:21,327 --> 01:22:22,633
FUENTES: You shot me!

1240
01:22:22,676 --> 01:22:23,982
You shot me.

1241
01:22:26,724 --> 01:22:29,031
MAN: What about the other guy?RUIZ: I surrender.

1242
01:22:29,074 --> 01:22:30,119
I surrender.

1243
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:33,252
I surrender!You, get up.

1244
01:22:33,296 --> 01:22:35,167
Get up!
Get over here.

1245
01:22:38,562 --> 01:22:40,259
!¡Basta! !Basta!

1246
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:43,828
Get out.

1247
01:22:44,916 --> 01:22:46,657
Get out. Get out!

1248
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:47,614
Oh, my God.

1249
01:22:49,486 --> 01:22:50,791
Don't kill me, please.
I'm a victim.

1250
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:51,923
Shut up.Ai!

1251
01:22:54,665 --> 01:22:56,754
Oh, my...

1252
01:22:56,797 --> 01:22:58,495
Hey, don't hurt
the old man!

1253
01:22:58,538 --> 01:23:00,236
He's not involved!

1254
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,717
Oh...

1255
01:23:06,372 --> 01:23:08,287
MAN: Come on.MAN 2: Go, go, go, go, go.

1256
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:17,035
Oh, come on, man.

1257
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:18,602
Give me a chance.

1258
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:21,039
I could work for you guys.
I could be an agent.

1259
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:22,084
I could do anything-- Ah!

1260
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:42,539
N-- Noooo!

1261
01:23:42,582 --> 01:23:44,062
No! No!

1262
01:23:45,107 --> 01:23:47,848
Do it, man.

1263
01:23:47,892 --> 01:23:50,112
Hey, you all knew the plan.

1264
01:23:56,118 --> 01:23:59,686
Don't torture me!
Just sh-shoot me in the head!

1265
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:13,396
Well, you wanted
a couple of terrorists,

1266
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:14,353
there they are.

1267
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:20,664
MORA:
Who gave the order to fire?

1268
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,757
I don't know.

1269
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,106
Who are you looking at?!

1270
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:29,890
I don't know.

1271
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:31,283
It was too confusing.

1272
01:24:31,327 --> 01:24:32,415
Who gave the order
to fire?!

1273
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:33,807
I don't know.

1274
01:24:33,851 --> 01:24:35,592
Who gave the order to fire?!I don't know!

1275
01:24:35,635 --> 01:24:37,811
Who gave the order to fire?

1276
01:24:37,855 --> 01:24:40,249
I don't know!You do! Point him out!

1277
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:47,691
I have no further questions.

1278
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:53,392
KATE:
The truth about Cerro Maravilla
is now public record.

1279
01:24:53,436 --> 01:24:55,133
Why is not.

1280
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:57,831
The Senate ends its hearings
without discovering

1281
01:24:57,875 --> 01:25:00,921
who ordered the deaths
of Jorge Rey and Alfredo Ruiz.

1282
01:25:00,965 --> 01:25:02,271
Who knew?

1283
01:25:02,314 --> 01:25:04,664
Did the Justice Department
and the FBI

1284
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:07,189
conspire with the police,
at least in the cover-up?

1285
01:25:07,232 --> 01:25:08,842
How high did it go?

1286
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:10,888
The investigation now moves

1287
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:13,282
from the Senate to the courts
and continues there.

1288
01:25:13,325 --> 01:25:17,416
This is Kate Meléndez,
WSTR, Channel 88.

1289
01:25:20,767 --> 01:25:21,812
Whoo!

1290
01:25:21,855 --> 01:25:23,683
Let's wrap it up.

1291
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:26,556
MAN:
Snow cones,
we got all flavors.

1292
01:25:26,599 --> 01:25:27,513
Snow cones.

1293
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:36,740
Scare you?

1294
01:25:36,783 --> 01:25:38,220
I didn't see you.

1295
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:40,047
Yeah, well, to tell you
the truth, Kate,

1296
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:41,745
you never really
should have.

1297
01:25:41,788 --> 01:25:43,268
Late for that now.

1298
01:26:08,685 --> 01:26:11,775
MAN:
Snow cones, snow cones.
Go get your snow cones.

1299
01:26:11,818 --> 01:26:13,298
Snow cones.
We got all flavors.

1300
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:19,174
Snow cones.
Snow cones, everybody.

1301
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:28,531
Snow cones,

1302
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:30,141
snow cones.

1303
01:26:32,274 --> 01:26:35,668
Snow cones, snow cones.
Go get your snow cones.

1304
01:26:35,712 --> 01:26:37,931
Snow cones.
We got all flavors.

1305
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:40,151
Snow cones.

1306
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,066
Snow cones.
Snow cones, everybody.

1307
01:26:42,109 --> 01:26:43,676
Snow cones.
We got all flavors.

1308
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:46,331
Come get
your snow cones.

1309
01:26:49,334 --> 01:26:51,467
Do you have something
against me personally?

1310
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:52,903
I just think you got

1311
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:54,948
your hands dirty
this time, Frank.

1312
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:01,216
It was
a beautiful operation.

1313
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:02,521
But the whole thing
fell apart.

1314
01:27:04,175 --> 01:27:05,742
Not my fault.

1315
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:08,397
It's hard to find good help
these days, you know?

1316
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:10,007
KATE:
That's a problem.

1317
01:27:10,050 --> 01:27:11,356
If you just left
the whole thing alone,

1318
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:13,097
I could've kept
a lid on it.

1319
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:15,534
But you had to go and make
a fucking career out of it.

1320
01:27:15,578 --> 01:27:17,928
After a long parade
of witnesses

1321
01:27:17,971 --> 01:27:19,973
and thousands of pages
of testimony--

1322
01:27:20,017 --> 01:27:21,497
Just one moment.

1323
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,281
We have more coming in
live from the field.

1324
01:27:23,325 --> 01:27:26,893
I didn't know it was your plan, Frank.

1325
01:27:26,937 --> 01:27:29,635
Well, who the hell else
had the capability, huh?

1326
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:32,290
I don't know. I figured the police.

1327
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:33,987
Broke like bread sticks,
didn't they?

1328
01:27:34,031 --> 01:27:36,468
I made them into heroes.

1329
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:38,557
Shit. You know how tough it is

1330
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:40,429
to produce a genuine terrorist
on this island?

1331
01:27:40,472 --> 01:27:42,474
Those two suckers
were a gift from heaven.

1332
01:27:42,518 --> 01:27:44,215
Except they weren't
terrorists, Frank.

1333
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,608
I wish they had been,

1334
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:47,784
but sometimes
you just have to make do.

1335
01:27:47,827 --> 01:27:49,742
At least they had the right
spirit, though, didn't they?

1336
01:27:49,786 --> 01:27:52,267
Fuentes didn't have to tie the
guns into their hands, did he?

1337
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:54,225
Okay, but why'd you have
to murder them?

1338
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,923
You really are a dumb bitch,
you know that?

1339
01:27:56,967 --> 01:27:59,143
They'd have done a year
on kidnapping and been out.

1340
01:27:59,186 --> 01:28:01,754
I needed an event.
I had a directive.

1341
01:28:02,799 --> 01:28:04,279
To get the governor re-elected?

1342
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:07,717
The man's a damn good
anti-Communist.

1343
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,414
I sure as hell wanted him
re-elected.

1344
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:11,547
It's in America's interests.

1345
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:13,200
I knew how to get results.

1346
01:28:13,244 --> 01:28:15,202
Nobody had to tell me
what was necessary.

1347
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:17,117
You think I'm somebody's boy?

1348
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:18,597
I fly solo.

1349
01:28:18,641 --> 01:28:21,121
Yeah, but then you don't have
any protection, Frank.

1350
01:28:21,165 --> 01:28:23,298
Nobody's gonna look out for you.

1351
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,169
Well, it's not too late

1352
01:28:25,212 --> 01:28:26,953
for a little damage control
right here.

1353
01:28:26,997 --> 01:28:30,696
You'll end up hanging out to dry
on an indictment.

1354
01:28:33,177 --> 01:28:35,005
Shit.

1355
01:28:35,048 --> 01:28:37,834
I got too big a mouth.

1356
01:28:37,877 --> 01:28:40,445
Now I'm really gonna have to do
something about you, Kate.

1357
01:28:44,841 --> 01:28:46,146
It's not gonna happen.

1358
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:47,887
Trust me.

1359
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,106
You're dead.

1360
01:28:53,023 --> 01:28:55,155
And you're live.
