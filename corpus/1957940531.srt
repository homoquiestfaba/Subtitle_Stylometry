1
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,084
- I mean, $4 for a soda?

2
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,685
- I don't make the prices, sir.

3
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,187
- You and I both know
that the water and syrup

4
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,723
only costs 25 cents.

5
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,095
- Well, the movie you're about
to see

6
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,997
cost several million dollars to
make,

7
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,132
and you're seeing it for 10
bucks, so guess it evens out.

8
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,870
- Come on, let's just go.

9
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,206
- Enjoy the show.

10
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:35,183
- You know...

11
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:44,192
Why do we even give
people their ticket stubs?

12
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,195
Be easier if we just threw
them on the ground ourselves.

13
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,099
- Yeah, but if they didn't
throw 'em on the floor

14
00:03:51,132 --> 00:03:52,332
you wouldn't have a job.

15
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,402
- Sure I would. I'd be the one
throwing them on the ground.

16
00:03:58,573 --> 00:03:59,707
- Where's Sheila?

17
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,341
- Theater One.

18
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,476
- Have you stocked yet?

19
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,679
- No, I just had a
customer a few minutes ago.

20
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:05,780
- Hey, Fuller?

21
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:08,516
Why do we even give
customers their ticket stubs?

22
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,019
No one checks them and they
wind up on the ground anyways.

23
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,755
It'd be easier if we just dumped
them

24
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:15,388
on the floor ourselves.

25
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,160
- There you go, Kyle.

26
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,195
Now there's the question that
everyone

27
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:23,030
who's ever worked here has asked
me.

28
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,609
- This is so stupid.

29
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,978
- I knew this was coming.

30
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,247
I just wasted all of my money.

31
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,715
- Yeah, it was your choice.

32
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:43,316
- Well, it's not my fault. I
thought it was gonna be good.

33
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,520
- Well, it's not, so...

34
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,030
- Leave me
alone!

35
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,899
Go away! Please, stop!

36
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:09,210
- Hey, Alan. Where are
we at with Theater Three?

37
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:10,978
- It's on its last reel, man.

38
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,680
- Why do you still call it a
reel?

39
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,550
- 'Cause I'm old school. Digital
sucks.

40
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,218
- How's the bulb?

41
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,719
- It's about at max.

42
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,420
- All right, when it's done,
go ahead and change it out.

43
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,924
It was a little dim during the 7
o'clock.

44
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,058
- All right.

45
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,693
- I'm sorry, sir, we're closed.

46
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:28,162
- It's not that. Can I
talk to your manager?

47
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:29,897
- Yes sir, how can I help you?

48
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:30,998
- Look, I know you're busy,

49
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:32,066
and I don't want to waste your
time.

50
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,067
You got better things to do.

51
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,303
- Aw, it's no problem,
sir. What's going on?

52
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,704
- Well, there's some kids up
front.

53
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:38,706
The movie's almost over.

54
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,408
They won't shut the hell up.

55
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,810
- In Theater Three?

56
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:44,512
- Yeah, up front.

57
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,247
Waving their hands, acting all
crazy.

58
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,951
But look, can you do something
for me and talk to them?

59
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:54,487
'Cause if I do, it's not gonna
be cordial.

60
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,527
- Sir, we'll take care of it.

61
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,895
Please go enjoy your movie.

62
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,405
Kyle, please do a head
count in Theater Three.

63
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:15,576
- How many
other fucking customers

64
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,811
in this place do that?

65
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,513
And in the fucking bathroom,
ain't no fucking toilet paper.

66
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,715
How 'bout that soap?

67
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:23,584
That sand-ass soap that
kids have in high school.

68
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:24,919
I hate that shit!

69
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,255
Men's restroom ain't got
no fucking toilet paper,

70
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:29,724
but the women's, they got some
in there.

71
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:33,694
I know that for a fact.

72
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,929
I'm in a bar here!

73
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:37,698
I expect to have a glass
mug, cold glass mug!

74
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,668
You serve beer in plastic
cups and paper cups.

75
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:41,836
Who the hell does that shit?

76
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,371
I deserve that for being a
regular!

77
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,041
I want some fucking service!

78
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,042
- Good.

79
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:52,980
- Why don't you
tell me?

80
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:55,883
Does Charlie really have
a little dick?

81
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:56,884
- You can't
fucking hide from me!

82
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,057
- Can't you people watch a damn
movie

83
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,326
without trashing the joint?

84
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,761
It's bad enough you
lowlifes run your mouth

85
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,530
during this film, but this...

86
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,034
- Sheila, when you're finished
in here,

87
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,402
can you take care of Theater
Three?

88
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,369
It's about to drop.

89
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:16,570
- Come on, Fuller.

90
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:19,173
- Sorry. Tammy still hasn't
stocked yet.

91
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,709
- Well, how convenient. What
about Kyle?

92
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,911
- Nah, he's got the posters.

93
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:24,979
Look, the sooner it's clean,

94
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,181
the sooner we can watch
that new movie together.

95
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:28,883
- I've still gotta do Theater
Two.

96
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,885
- Nah, it's done. Kyle took care
of it.

97
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:35,523
- You know, Fuller,

98
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,692
I swear these people
were raised in a barn.

99
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,027
How many people?

100
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,262
- Alan said about eight.

101
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:43,030
- Okay.

102
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,335
- Look, tomorrow night
you can have box office.

103
00:07:47,368 --> 00:07:48,202
I promise.

104
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,404
- Thank you.

105
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:55,843
Oh, god.

106
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,913
What is this?

107
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,982
Oh god.

108
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:02,383
So gross.

109
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,260
- Ah!

110
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,702
- Oops!

111
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:24,205
- Yeah, that's what your
mom said when she had you.

112
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,109
You should leave it on.
It's an improvement.

113
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:30,911
- You know, Kyle, you could use
this

114
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,047
for more than just holding
popcorn.

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,548
- What are you talking about?

116
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,185
- I'm just saying, if you
make a certain modification,

117
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,720
say, right here...

118
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,891
Provides pretty good cover
for when you're fooling around

119
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,926
with a girl in a dark theater.

120
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,695
- A real woman wouldn't need it.

121
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,398
- Damn, man!

122
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,433
Have to start dating some of
your exes.

123
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,470
Yo, what the hell is the
deal with Theater Three, man?

124
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:59,673
- Everybody always shuts
up the moment you walk in.

125
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,376
- Yeah, well, I don't blame
that guy for complaining.

126
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,980
Hate that shit, when
somebody runs their mouth

127
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,014
during a movie.

128
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,082
Kill for less.

129
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:12,019
- Oh, did you get that new movie
prepped?

130
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,188
- Yeah. Camcorder's ready too.

131
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,390
I'ma bootleg this like a son of
a bitch.

132
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,925
- Well, you better not let
Fuller

133
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,693
catch on what you're doing.

134
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,928
- Shit.

135
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,897
Fuller doesn't give a shit, man.

136
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,398
Besides, I make more selling the
bootlegs

137
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:25,733
than I do working here.

138
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,868
- Is it any good?

139
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,671
- Meh.

140
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,541
Couple good-looking bimbos in
it.

141
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,542
Stoners'll like it.

142
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,879
Hey, did, uh,

143
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,215
you see that hot chick
during the 7 o'clock?

144
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,217
- You mean with the red
skirt and the boots?

145
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,885
- Oh my god, yes.

146
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,387
- She applied for a job here.

147
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:48,489
- Shut up, are you serious?

148
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:50,559
- Yours truly gave her the
application.

149
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:58,065
- That's great.

150
00:09:58,933 --> 00:09:59,867
I gotta go.

151
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:14,448
- Hello?

152
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,047
- Here it is.

153
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,152
- Lori.

154
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:53,087
Yeah, that's a pretty hot name,
huh?

155
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,054
- Mmm.

156
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,090
- What do you think
her porn name would be?

157
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,360
- Well, she brought her pretty
hot boyfriend with her today.

158
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:03,598
- What do you think
his porn name would be?

159
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:05,099
Dude, I'm not surprised, man.

160
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:07,301
She was way too good-looking to
be single.

161
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,938
- Oh, I got her profile. Check
it out.

162
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:13,340
- Oh, man!

163
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:15,042
Yeah, she's pretty hot.

164
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:15,910
- Hmm.

165
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:19,980
- Oh, shit.

166
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,483
It says here she works
at Dairy Queen right now.

167
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:25,419
- I suddenly have the
urge for a banana split.

168
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,689
- Well, perhaps we
should go to Dairy Queen

169
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:29,690
before work tomorrow, huh?

170
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:32,092
- Dude, we gotta get her a job
here.

171
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,030
- Oh, I'll give her a job.

172
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,401
Let's go talk to Fuller.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,374
- Can my friend Amy come
check out the movie?

174
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,710
She works with me at the clinic.

175
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,045
Please?

176
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,413
Please?

177
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:53,981
Please?

178
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:54,848
Please?

179
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,185
She's cool and she really wants
to see it.

180
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:02,557
She really loves horror movies.

181
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,625
Plus she's cute.

182
00:12:06,927 --> 00:12:09,930
- Okay, but you do the theaters
tomorrow.

183
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,498
- Deal.

184
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:12,800
- All of them.
- Fine.

185
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:14,802
- I mean it.

186
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,571
I don't want to hear any
complaining about it tomorrow.

187
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:17,838
- I promise.

188
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,140
- Hey, Fuller!

189
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:21,375
Fuller!

190
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,711
- Okay.

191
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:23,978
Tell her to hurry up.

192
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,580
- I'll call her right now.

193
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:27,314
- Hey, Fuller!

194
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:28,182
Fuller!

195
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,136
Hey, Fuller.

196
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,304
Fuller!

197
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,472
Yo, Fuller, check this out, man.

198
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,407
You have got to hire this chick.

199
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,209
- Dude, she is smokin' hot.

200
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,844
- Please! Please, man.

201
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,479
- She only wants part-time.

202
00:12:58,513 --> 00:12:59,714
- Yo, but her body?

203
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,782
Her body was full-time.

204
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:05,754
Could be Fuller-time.

205
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:10,525
- Is this her?

206
00:13:10,558 --> 00:13:11,392
- Yup.

207
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:19,967
- She's, uh...

208
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,040
She's hired.

209
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,344
- Aw!

210
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,412
- Walk it off, buddy.

211
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,428
- Amy.

212
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,530
Hey, yeah, it's cool.

213
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,767
Well, how soon can you get here?

214
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:56,870
- Uh, I don't know.

215
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,472
We're screening it tomorrow
night for one night only,

216
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:01,108
but we have to check it
first for glitches, you know?

217
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,414
No, we got that stuff
here. Just get here, okay?

218
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:08,282
Okay, bye.

219
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:48,389
- God, I hate these.

220
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,212
- Oh. Hey, Fuller.

221
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:15,015
Projector's ready to go, man.

222
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:21,088
- Ready to go? Okay, and
what about the, uh...

223
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:24,793
- Got it right here.

224
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,098
Careful, man. The ink's still
drying.

225
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:37,304
- You know, if you get caught
doing this,

226
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,773
you're on your own.

227
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,975
I don't know a thing about it.

228
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,210
- Get caught?

229
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,112
Fuller, I've already been
caught, man.

230
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,717
- What do you mean? When?

231
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:50,852
- About a month ago.

232
00:15:51,853 --> 00:15:53,253
- Uh, what happened?

233
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,423
- I was out driving with
some buddies of mine

234
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:57,592
and a cop pulled us over

235
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,561
and saw a box of bootlegs in the
back.

236
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:02,062
- And?

237
00:16:04,532 --> 00:16:05,633
- And he bought three.

238
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:07,569
- You're kidding.

239
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:09,369
- Nah, he says he works so
much he didn't have time

240
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:11,371
to go to the theaters that
often, so...

241
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm serious.

242
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,180
- Great story, but I need you

243
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:21,248
to hold off on this for a
minute.

244
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:23,551
Tammy's friend is on the way to
join us.

245
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,219
- Male or female?

246
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:27,722
- Female, and Tammy says she's
really hot.

247
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,225
- Nice. Do I have time to order
in?

248
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:35,295
- If you hurry, maybe.

249
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,573
Ask them how long it's gonna
take.

250
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:50,712
- Yeah, so can I get
like five cheeseburgers?

251
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:52,212
Mm-hmm.

252
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:54,549
Yeah, like, one of 'em with no
onions.

253
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:55,884
Yeah, one of 'em.

254
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,351
No, seriously, I'm allergic.

255
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,921
- How long?

256
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:01,923
- Yeah, so how long's the wait?

257
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:05,158
Okay.

258
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,026
I'm on hold.

259
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,735
- People have nothing better
to do then trash this theater.

260
00:17:16,504 --> 00:17:18,940
Sorry bunch of lowlifes.

261
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,847
That's good enough.

262
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:31,218
- You're sure they deliver this
late?

263
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:32,687
- Yeah.

264
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,354
It's a hefty delivery fee, man.

265
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:36,791
- Dude, where's your cell?

266
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,227
- I forgot it in the booth.

267
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,896
- He's too lazy to go get it.

268
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,698
- Hey, stop hating, fellas.

269
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:45,767
Remember, I'm buying here.

270
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,134
Oh, shut up.

271
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,937
Yeah, no. How long?

272
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,540
Right around the corner
at the Montwood Theater.

273
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:03,350
- Shit!

274
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:08,890
- Mm-hmm.

275
00:18:08,923 --> 00:18:09,891
20-25 minutes?

276
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:12,359
All right, thank you.

277
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,561
No problem. Thank you.

278
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,097
Food's on its way.
- How much?

279
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,866
- About 24 bucks.

280
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,002
Hey, no, no, no, no. I said I
got it, man.

281
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:22,235
- I said I got-
- Hey, Fuller.

282
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,005
Uh, Fuller-
- You're already finished?

283
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:25,873
- No, no, no, there's a guy in
there.

284
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:27,909
- In Theater Three?
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:28,776
- What's he doing?

286
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,444
- He's sleeping in one of the
seats.

287
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,481
- Hang on, I'll deal
with this.

288
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:35,282
- Yeah.

289
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:48,896
- Sir?

290
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:51,198
Sir.

291
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:56,070
Sir.

292
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,039
- What?

293
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,174
- Sir, the movie's
over,

294
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,711
so I'm sorry, but we're gonna
have to ask you to leave.

295
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:05,513
- The movie isn't...

296
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:08,549
The movie's still going, it's
not over.

297
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:11,019
Goddammit.

298
00:19:12,086 --> 00:19:15,089
- Jesus. How the hell did
he get that in here, Kyle?

299
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,392
- Who's gonna search him, Alan?

300
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:21,596
- I hope he didn't apply here.

301
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,462
- Hey.

302
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,298
You know what?
- Sir?

303
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:32,140
- Yesterday I was out back,
and you know what I found?

304
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,407
I found an owl.

305
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:35,843
- I'm sorry?

306
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,480
- I found this here owl.

307
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:41,348
- An owl?

308
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,383
You mean an owl?

309
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:46,554
- I got an owl, man.

310
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:49,256
I finally got my owl!

311
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:58,231
- That's really great, sir,
but we do need to close now

312
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,701
and I gotta ask you to leave.

313
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:05,540
- You're gonna have to ask me to
go?

314
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,411
Your movie theater.

315
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:13,681
Not my home.

316
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,062
- "Come on, Sheila,

317
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,698
there's only eight
people in Theater Three."

318
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:34,135
"Got this here owl."

319
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:39,173
Whatever, fuck.

320
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,760
- Aw, that guy smelled like
shit, man.

321
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,529
- How did he afford admission?

322
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,898
- Yo, Kyle, what the hell were
you doing

323
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,700
selling that guy a ticket?

324
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,668
- Hey, he had the money.

325
00:21:07,702 --> 00:21:09,237
Well, what was I supposed to do?

326
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,505
Tell him no?

327
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:14,842
- You shouldn't have
sold that guy a ticket.

328
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,177
- I'm surprised that angry
customer

329
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,278
wasn't complaining about him
instead.

330
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:20,748
- All right, Kyle.

331
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:23,184
Go Lysol that seat immediately,
please.

332
00:21:23,217 --> 00:21:24,051
- Sure.

333
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,622
- Spray a lot!

334
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:30,423
- Oh, and Kyle?

335
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,860
Next time, tell him we're sold
out.

336
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,497
Jesus.

337
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:40,067
Yo, but he did smell like shit
though.

338
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:41,334
You gotta fire that guy.

339
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,589
Hey, so Tammy, what's the deal
with this friend of yours?

340
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:03,090
She, uh...

341
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:03,925
She hot?

342
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:04,926
- Pretty much.

343
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:07,995
- Is she, like, actually hot,

344
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,897
or is she just one of these
average-looking chicks

345
00:22:09,931 --> 00:22:11,666
who thinks she's hot?

346
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:12,867
Hate that shit, man.

347
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,873
All right, how old is she then?

348
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:20,308
- 22.

349
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,442
She works with me in my other
job.

350
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:25,580
- Least she's drinking age, huh?

351
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:27,181
She got a boyfriend?

352
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,115
- What's it to you?

353
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,018
- Making conversation. Jeez,
Tammy.

354
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:32,687
We don't talk enough, you know?

355
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,290
Does she?

356
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,426
- Nothing serious.

357
00:22:41,262 --> 00:22:42,897
- What's she look like?

358
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,000
- Find out when she gets here.

359
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,002
- Maybe I'll take her out back
and, uh,

360
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,570
show her this here owl, huh?

361
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:51,072
- Think you mean hummingbird.

362
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,876
- I'ma grab some popcorn.

363
00:23:04,785 --> 00:23:06,320
- Hell yeah.

364
00:23:06,354 --> 00:23:09,156
Spray the hell outta that chair.

365
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,325
- Wonder if this guy had lice.

366
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,028
- He probably hasn't
showered in about a year.

367
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:17,231
- Aw, man! That's rank!

368
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:18,431
- Hey!

369
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,635
At least you only had to talk
to him through the glass.

370
00:23:20,668 --> 00:23:22,870
I had to take his ticket
from him face-to-face.

371
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:25,006
- I couldn't deny him admission.

372
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,774
I'd be on the news by now.

373
00:23:28,376 --> 00:23:30,410
- Did he pay with a bunch of
pennies?

374
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,546
- No, a $20 bill.

375
00:23:33,614 --> 00:23:35,683
- Well, where do you think he
got that?

376
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:40,187
- Who knows? Maybe someone gave
it to him.

377
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,822
Maybe he ripped someone off.

378
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,338
- Oh, hey, Tammy.

379
00:23:57,371 --> 00:24:00,141
Oh, remember that hot
chick in the 7 o'clock?

380
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:01,709
The one with the red dress?

381
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:04,745
- The blond one? Yeah, I
remember.

382
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,414
- Fuller's gonna hire her.

383
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,549
- No he's not.
- Oh yes, he is.

384
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,885
- Why, 'cause she's pretty?

385
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:13,521
- Pretty? Oh, she's not pretty,
Tammy.

386
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:16,958
She is the definition of hot.

387
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:22,229
- It was a business decision,
okay?

388
00:24:22,263 --> 00:24:24,765
Pretty girls are great for
business

389
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,134
and they bring in a lot of
customers.

390
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,604
- Good save.

391
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:35,009
- Can we find out if brawny
studs are good for business too?

392
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,758
- I just want to go home.

393
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,893
- You don't want to stay
and watch the movie?

394
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:54,295
- I'm not in the mood.

395
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,932
Darren and I had a fight.

396
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:00,701
Plus, it's that time of the
month.

397
00:25:00,735 --> 00:25:02,236
- Oh, thanks for sharing that.

398
00:25:04,538 --> 00:25:05,973
Come on.

399
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,808
It's gonna be fun.

400
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,377
There's food on the way.

401
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:14,115
- Maybe I should call Darren.

402
00:25:15,783 --> 00:25:17,385
- Hey, he can call you, right?

403
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,554
- I mean, yeah, I guess.

404
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,323
But he hasn't called or texted
all day.

405
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:23,190
- See?

406
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,192
- Screw it.

407
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:27,495
You're right.

408
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:28,896
- Tammy's staying.

409
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,765
- I don't blame her.

410
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:32,867
I hate watching movies with the
public.

411
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,734
- Mmm.

412
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:46,547
- Where's your friend?

413
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,016
- She should be here any minute.

414
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,884
- Mmm.

415
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:54,121
I want to get this show on the
road.

416
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:57,191
Gotta work swing shift tomorrow.

417
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:58,759
- I just called her a couple
minutes ago.

418
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,027
She should be here soon.

419
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,964
- Welp.

420
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:08,169
I'll be in the office for a bit.

421
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:09,837
- Okay.

422
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:13,307
- Come get me when she's here.

423
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,675
I'll let her in.

424
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:16,377
- Okay.

425
00:27:19,106 --> 00:27:20,542
- Can I help you?

426
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:25,713
- Come on, get here.

427
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,590
"Sorry, can't make it."

428
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:37,559
Well, why the hell not?

429
00:27:41,896 --> 00:27:44,899
- And he is such a cheapskate,
you know?

430
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:49,870
Like, his parents are
rich, and he's like that.

431
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:51,573
He doesn't even have to work.

432
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:52,873
- Is he an only child?

433
00:27:52,907 --> 00:27:54,175
- Yeah!

434
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,042
- Figures.

435
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:58,078
- Miserable skinflint.

436
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,481
- Rich people are so stingy

437
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:03,050
because they want to keep being
rich.

438
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,752
They don't like to spend
any of their own money

439
00:28:04,785 --> 00:28:07,622
because they have this
fear of someday being poor.

440
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,491
- Well, still.

441
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,159
He shouldn't be like that.

442
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,027
- Screw him.

443
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:15,763
Nobody likes a Grinch.

444
00:28:16,797 --> 00:28:19,366
Tightwads like him never change.

445
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,869
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,472
- Maybe you're right.

447
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:26,541
- I know I am.

448
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:58,339
- Hey, Fuller.

449
00:28:58,372 --> 00:28:59,206
You good, man?

450
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:03,043
Hey, those Russian prostitutes
you ordered are here.

451
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:05,412
- That was fast.

452
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:08,349
- Ah, just kidding. Burgers are
here, man.

453
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:09,216
- All right.

454
00:29:13,087 --> 00:29:15,389
So Tammy, where's your friend?

455
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,091
- Oh, she couldn't make
it.

456
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,694
- That sucks. Fuller said she
was hot.

457
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:21,829
- She is. You're missing out.

458
00:29:21,862 --> 00:29:23,732
- So what's this movie?

459
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,366
- It's a classic horror piece

460
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,736
that's never been released
on home media, ever.

461
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:31,305
- Eh, it's not on 35,
so...

462
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:32,172
- So?

463
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,309
- So? So it's just a digital
file.

464
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:36,745
- Alan's a film snob.

465
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:39,380
- Hey, movies look better on
film, man.

466
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:42,082
I mean, film projection used
to be a fucking art form.

467
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:45,754
- Sure, until you had missed
splices,

468
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,222
missing reels, and film burns.

469
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:49,390
- What's a film burn?

470
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,761
- Projectors' bulbs used to get
so hot

471
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:55,029
that the film can only pass in
front of it

472
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:59,066
for like a split second,
so if the projector jammed,

473
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,503
then the film would stop and
melt.

474
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,003
- Really?

475
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:03,871
- Yep.

476
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:07,374
Happened to every projectionist.

477
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:10,745
- Hey, Fuller. Hey.

478
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,079
Can I talk to you for a second?

479
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,887
- So Tammy, how about your
friend?

480
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:23,157
- Well, she's not answering her
cell.

481
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,825
- Her name's not Lori, is it?

482
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:26,994
- Oh, no. Who's Lori?

483
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,698
- Yeah, so Fuller. Hey, man.

484
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:33,000
Do you mind if I ask you a
favor?

485
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:33,867
- I might.

486
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,904
- All right, so check this out.

487
00:30:36,937 --> 00:30:38,839
Me and a buddy were at
the flea market on Sunday

488
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,074
and I bought this reel,

489
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:43,243
and it's really old
and it's kinda beat up.

490
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:45,714
And it was only like five bucks,

491
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:47,716
and I was just, like, thinking-

492
00:30:47,749 --> 00:30:49,883
- Mm-hmm?

493
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:52,252
- Maybe we can...

494
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,253
- Let me guess.

495
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:56,090
You want to pull out the
35 millimeter projector

496
00:30:56,123 --> 00:30:58,025
and take a look at it.

497
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,628
- I mean, yeah. I got no
other way to view it, man.

498
00:31:03,397 --> 00:31:04,231
- What's on it?

499
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:06,835
- I don't know.
- Don't give me that.

500
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:10,137
I know you've held it up
to the light at least once.

501
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,873
- Look, I don't know
'cause it's in Scope, so...

502
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,711
Come on, Fuller, it's just one
reel.

503
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:19,581
Not even a full reel, maybe
like five minutes long.

504
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:24,385
Dude, come on. It's not
gonna hurt the projector.

505
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:26,220
And, like...

506
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:28,690
Man, what if it's like a
snuff film or something?

507
00:31:32,092 --> 00:31:32,926
- A snuff film?

508
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:36,897
In CinemaScope?

509
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,539
- Yeah, I remember her.

510
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:45,906
Don't know why you're
making such a big deal.

511
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,040
She's not all that.

512
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:51,044
I mean, you guys don't
have a chance, but...

513
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,947
- You're gonna owe me for this.

514
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:56,250
- Yeah.

515
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:58,318
Yeah, big-time.

516
00:31:58,352 --> 00:31:59,386
- Damn right, big-time.

517
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,489
And I don't want anybody
in here knowing about it.

518
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,191
Not even Kyle.

519
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,860
- Deal.

520
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:08,095
- I'm serious, because if they
find out,

521
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:09,496
they're all gonna bring
their home movies in here

522
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:10,497
and I don't have time for that.

523
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:12,734
- Look, I won't say a word, man.

524
00:32:15,436 --> 00:32:16,970
- All right.

525
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:20,073
Tomorrow night, and I'm
going in there with you.

526
00:32:21,074 --> 00:32:21,910
- Yeah.

527
00:32:24,913 --> 00:32:26,146
- It's got a sound stripe?

528
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,347
- Yeah, man.

529
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:30,552
- Social media photos
can be very deceiving.

530
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:33,053
- Alan and I saw her with our
own eyes.

531
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,722
The pics are legit.

532
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,423
- Whatever.

533
00:32:37,525 --> 00:32:38,893
- Everyone finished?

534
00:32:40,795 --> 00:32:42,496
- "Thank you, Alan!"

535
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,765
- Hey, I pitched in.
- Yeah, gee, Alan.

536
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:45,065
Fine dining.

537
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,568
- Thanks, Alan.

538
00:32:46,601 --> 00:32:48,368
- All right, let's
get this show on the road.

539
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,971
Tammy, while Alan gets the movie
ready,

540
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:52,306
take care of this mess.

541
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,173
- Sure.

542
00:33:14,596 --> 00:33:16,497
- I really think
you're gonna love this movie.

543
00:33:16,531 --> 00:33:17,866
- Oh, you think so?

544
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,334
- I more than think, I know so.

545
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,169
- Do you think it's gonna keep
me awake?

546
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:24,506
- Oh, yeah. Yo, you're gonna
be screaming your head off.

547
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,073
- No way!

548
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:28,008
I don't believe you.

549
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:30,477
But hey, I am glad I stayed.

550
00:33:30,512 --> 00:33:31,980
- Cool.

551
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:33,848
- And I do love horror movies.

552
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,550
- Yeah, don't think about
whatshisname.

553
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:37,451
- I won't.

554
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:45,593
- Aw, dammit!

555
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:47,261
- What's the matter? No butter?

556
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:48,428
- I forgot my drink.

557
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,332
- Will you bring me a
box of Milk Duds, please?

558
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:53,902
- Yeah.
- Thank you!

559
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,849
- You want some popcorn?

560
00:34:07,882 --> 00:34:09,116
- I'm good, thanks.

561
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,188
- Are you coming?

562
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,423
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

563
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:17,357
- All right, well, you better
hurry.

564
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,593
The movie's about to start.

565
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:19,727
- Okay, Kyle.

566
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:02,302
- Roller King, this is Rachael.

567
00:35:02,336 --> 00:35:03,170
- Satan!

568
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,238
- Fuck off!

569
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,509
- He's the killer, you...

570
00:35:08,543 --> 00:35:09,409
Stupid.

571
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:27,595
- Wendy the ho.

572
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:29,530
- Alicia the slut.

573
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:37,672
- Aw, what the hell?

574
00:35:37,705 --> 00:35:39,974
- What happened?

575
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:43,343
- Alan, it's the bulb.

576
00:35:43,377 --> 00:35:44,545
- Shit.

577
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:48,181
- You didn't change it out, did
you?

578
00:35:48,215 --> 00:35:50,217
- I thought I'd make it
through another screening.

579
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:52,687
- You know we're
gonna have to start the movie

580
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,755
over again, right?

581
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:56,323
- Why?

582
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:59,527
- So Alan can continue
his illegal recording.

583
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,895
- Shut up, asshole.

584
00:36:00,928 --> 00:36:02,362
- No, no, we'll just
pick it up

585
00:36:02,396 --> 00:36:03,564
from where we left off.

586
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:07,334
Intermission, everyone.
- Fuck.

587
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:08,368
- How long?

588
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:10,605
- As long as it takes.

589
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:14,274
- And that's why
we do these test screenings.

590
00:36:16,276 --> 00:36:17,377
- Goddammit.

591
00:36:17,411 --> 00:36:19,614
Couldn't this have
happened two hours later?

592
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,282
I miss the days of film, man.

593
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:28,255
- So what do you think of it so
far?

594
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:33,027
- Well, the "please silence your
phone" ad

595
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:34,629
was very powerful.

596
00:36:42,036 --> 00:36:42,870
- Where's Tammy?

597
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,007
- I don't know. She
said she was coming in.

598
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,240
She was right behind me.

599
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:49,143
- Look at this, Kyle.

600
00:36:49,177 --> 00:36:52,379
It's 12:30 and the jerk
doesn't care where I am.

601
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,552
And my phone is about to die.

602
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:00,188
- Fuck him.

603
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:06,594
So Fuller, when are you gonna
hire Lori?

604
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:10,765
- I don't know. Um, sometime
next week.

605
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:14,869
Sheila, go check the ladies'
room.

606
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,470
See if she's in there.

607
00:37:16,504 --> 00:37:19,339
Kyle, check the other theaters.

608
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:41,294
- Tammy!

609
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:47,869
Hope you didn't leave a mess.

610
00:38:25,006 --> 00:38:25,840
- Meh.

611
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:40,988
- Good stuff, good
stuff.

612
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:43,090
- Did you find her?
- No.

613
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:44,759
- Well, she didn't leave.

614
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:45,893
All the doors are still locked.

615
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:48,129
- Well, maybe she's in the can.

616
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:52,365
- Bulb's replaced, man.
Picture's back up.

617
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,001
- All right, we gotta check the
print

618
00:38:54,035 --> 00:38:55,203
and make sure it's not damaged,

619
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:57,705
so let's get this show on the
road, yeah?

620
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,016
- Did you find Tammy?
- Nuh-uh.

621
00:39:10,051 --> 00:39:11,484
So what'd I miss?

622
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,321
- That guy's about to get
slashed.

623
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:16,356
- Oh, man!

624
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,793
He didn't even get to
finish his friggin' joint.

625
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:21,494
- I already know who the killer
is.

626
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:23,030
Want me to tell you?

627
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:23,898
- No!
- No!

628
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,200
- Fine.

629
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:33,040
- Makes the
back of my head tingle.

630
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,276
- Tastes better
than real cigarettes.

631
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:48,756
- Aw, shit!

632
00:39:48,789 --> 00:39:52,425
God, I hate it when
this happens.

633
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:57,598
"No, Kyle, we don't want to
know who the murderer is.

634
00:39:57,632 --> 00:40:00,701
We want to figure it out for
ourselves."

635
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:03,371
All these horror movies are the
same.

636
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,841
Some group of idiots don't even
know

637
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:09,010
what's going on right
underneath their nose.

638
00:40:17,618 --> 00:40:20,221
- I was obviously
talking about the kid that died.

639
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:21,923
- What happened?

640
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:24,992
- Yeah, a kid
died here back in the '80s.

641
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:26,861
- What happened?

642
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:28,396
- Well, he was
epileptic

643
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,398
and he had a seizure
because of the strobe light.

644
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,532
- What'd I miss?

645
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:32,967
- She took her shirt off.

646
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,635
- How was it?

647
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:36,469
- I mean, I've seen better.

648
00:40:36,504 --> 00:40:37,872
- Parents didn't
know about strobe lights

649
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:38,739
and seizures?

650
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:41,275
- Hey, Fuller.

651
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:43,377
Fuller.

652
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:45,880
Fuller!

653
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,083
Hey, man, can you, uh...

654
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,719
Can you go open the door for me,
man?

655
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:52,586
- For what?

656
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:54,722
- 'Cause I need to smoke.

657
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,326
- Uh, why don't you go fire
one off in the bathroom

658
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:00,261
like you don't think I know
you're doing every day?

659
00:41:00,294 --> 00:41:01,562
- Jeez.

660
00:41:03,698 --> 00:41:04,999
- Whatever happened
to the babysitter?

661
00:41:05,032 --> 00:41:07,401
- Go up to the booth and
check the audio levels.

662
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,042
- Goddamn piece of shit.

663
00:41:21,782 --> 00:41:23,784
Oh, god, I hate digital.

664
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:31,559
Except for you, my little
Japanese friend.

665
00:41:33,194 --> 00:41:34,862
- Did you see what
that bitch wrote about me

666
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:35,730
in the bathroom?

667
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,468
- Where is she?

668
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,669
- I'll be right back.

669
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:43,237
- Okay.

670
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,852
- Oh, you're so dead!

671
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,020
Dead!

672
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:00,221
Dead!

673
00:42:00,254 --> 00:42:01,355
Dead!

674
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,223
Dead!

675
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,927
- Bootleg this son of a bitch.

676
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:07,795
Goddamn!

677
00:42:08,763 --> 00:42:09,830
Fucking Fuller!

678
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:11,532
Jesus Christ, man.

679
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:13,467
Scared the shit outta me.

680
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:15,036
- Put those damn cigarettes
away.

681
00:42:15,069 --> 00:42:17,405
You know this is a no-fire zone.

682
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:19,206
- It's gone, it's out, it's
away.

683
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,207
- Great.

684
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:21,876
You know, I can let the piracy
slide,

685
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:25,346
but I can't have you burning
down the joint, you know?

686
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,382
- I'm not gonna burn
down the place, Fuller.

687
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:29,717
- I don't want to see those
again.

688
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,751
Get them outta here.

689
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,102
- Shit!

690
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:49,970
God!

691
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,746
Kyle!

692
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:00,181
That bum is outside.

693
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:01,882
- So?

694
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,484
- So?

695
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,219
He's banging on the door. Come
on.

696
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,187
- Oh, shit.

697
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:09,990
- My money says she's a
freak.

698
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:11,392
- Just think about how
much of your paycheck

699
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:13,094
goes out to the cigarettes every
week.

700
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:14,495
- Fuller! Fuller?

701
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:16,597
- What?
- There's a guy outside.

702
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,566
- What guy?

703
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:18,567
- I don't know, maybe the guy

704
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,035
that was sleeping in the
theater.

705
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:22,369
- The bum?
- Mm-hmm, yes.

706
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:24,038
- Oh, god. Could you smell him?

707
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:25,039
- Listen, I was by the phone,

708
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,407
I was making a call, and
the next thing you know,

709
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,008
somebody's trying to pound on
the door.

710
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,578
- Do you want me to call the
police?

711
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,245
- No, don't do that.

712
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:32,379
Is he still there?

713
00:43:32,413 --> 00:43:34,115
- Can you please get rid of him?

714
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:36,217
- Let's go take a look.

715
00:43:56,036 --> 00:43:57,071
- Dammit!

716
00:43:57,104 --> 00:43:58,706
You guys, he was right there, I
swear.

717
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,474
- It's okay, I believe you.

718
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,076
- Did you see him?

719
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:03,010
- Nope.

720
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,912
- Fuller, can I deny that guy
admission

721
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:06,480
next time he comes here?

722
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:07,748
- Uh, no.

723
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:08,916
- Well, we should at least go
out there

724
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,552
and take a look, man.

725
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:13,020
- Bad idea. You just want to
smoke.

726
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,489
- I mean, we should at least
make sure

727
00:44:15,524 --> 00:44:17,091
he's not hanging around.

728
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:18,560
- Relax, the door's locked.

729
00:44:18,593 --> 00:44:20,394
He's not getting back in.

730
00:44:20,427 --> 00:44:22,029
- Wait.

731
00:44:22,062 --> 00:44:25,299
So if the doors are
locked, then where's Tammy?

732
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:29,003
- Maybe she went out the back
door.

733
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:39,880
- See?

734
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:42,816
Locked.

735
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,653
I locked all the doors.

736
00:44:44,685 --> 00:44:47,221
- Well, then she has to be here
somewhere.

737
00:44:47,254 --> 00:44:49,990
- All right, go and see
if you can find her.

738
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:52,193
I'm gonna run to the
office and call her cell.

739
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,195
We're gonna be here all night.

740
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,636
- Goddammit.

741
00:45:34,669 --> 00:45:36,170
This whole thing's fucked now.

742
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,886
- You think she's in the
stockroom?

743
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,256
- I don't know, why don't
you two ladies go check?

744
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:58,459
Oh, I left my laptop running.

745
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,972
- Aren't you
supposed to mop in here?

746
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:13,575
- Yeah, we're supposed
to.

747
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,377
- Are we gonna finish
the film?

748
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:18,812
- Who knows at this point?

749
00:46:18,846 --> 00:46:20,914
- Where do you think Tammy is?

750
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:22,383
- Probably at home in bed.

751
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:26,387
Keys to the kingdom.

752
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:31,225
So you called whatshisname
on the payphone?

753
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:32,661
- Hmm?

754
00:46:32,694 --> 00:46:33,894
Oh.

755
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,095
Yeah.

756
00:46:35,129 --> 00:46:38,399
- You didn't want him
to know it was you calling.

757
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:39,601
You talk to him?

758
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:43,470
- No, I hung up.

759
00:46:43,505 --> 00:46:44,572
- Ah.

760
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:47,374
- And then I heard
the banging on the door.

761
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:49,410
- So he answered?

762
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:50,344
- Yeah.

763
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:52,714
Yeah, it sounded like he was in
a car

764
00:46:52,747 --> 00:46:54,716
with a bunch of people.

765
00:46:54,749 --> 00:46:56,584
- Sounded like he was having
fun.

766
00:46:58,285 --> 00:46:59,853
- Um, I...

767
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:02,489
- Wait. I'm sorry.

768
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:04,526
I didn't mean it like that!

769
00:47:06,093 --> 00:47:06,927
Shit!

770
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:09,863
He probably was having a good
time.

771
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,135
- Come on!

772
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:17,971
Come on, bring the camera
down six more inches, man.

773
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,873
Get her tits in the shot.

774
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:22,476
What kinda pussy director
doesn't show any skin?

775
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,512
It's a fucking horror film,
isn't it?

776
00:47:24,546 --> 00:47:26,013
Show some skin.

777
00:47:26,914 --> 00:47:29,049
Lame-ass fucking directors
nowadays.

778
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:46,433
What the fuck?

779
00:47:56,511 --> 00:48:01,516
- Hmm.

780
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,526
Ms. Lori Jae.

781
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:18,899
See you very soon.

782
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:36,885
- I shouldn't have called him.

783
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,252
I mean, he knows it was me.

784
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:40,454
- So what?

785
00:48:42,557 --> 00:48:44,559
- Well, I tried to...

786
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:46,728
I just don't know why I care so
much.

787
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,864
Like, I feel stupid.

788
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:54,401
- Hey, he's stupid if
he's cheating on you.

789
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:01,341
- Thanks.

790
00:49:03,511 --> 00:49:04,411
- Besides,

791
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:10,017
he ain't got no owl.

792
00:49:15,523 --> 00:49:17,357
- Oh my god, that guy smelled so
bad.

793
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,527
- Would you go out with him?

794
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:20,595
- No!

795
00:49:20,628 --> 00:49:21,696
- It's a valid question.

796
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:23,096
- It is not valid.

797
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,165
- Bums need lovin' too.

798
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:31,405
- Do it.

799
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:42,182
- Ta-da!

800
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:43,317
- Oh, you made it.

801
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:44,184
- Of course.

802
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:51,091
Alan?

803
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:53,227
- Wow.

804
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:56,463
Is that a dog?

805
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,305
- Oh, shit.

806
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:08,475
Fuller's gonna have Alan's head
for this.

807
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,277
- I am not cleaning this up.

808
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,881
- Where did he go?

809
00:50:12,914 --> 00:50:14,281
- Smoking, probably.

810
00:50:25,593 --> 00:50:27,127
- Kyle, Sheila.

811
00:50:28,596 --> 00:50:29,429
Where's Alan?

812
00:50:30,497 --> 00:50:32,000
- Probably smoking.

813
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:36,004
- And hey, um, he made a
major mess up in the booth.

814
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,071
There's popcorn all over the
place.

815
00:50:38,105 --> 00:50:40,040
- And I'm not cleaning it up.

816
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:41,475
- Me neither.

817
00:50:41,509 --> 00:50:43,176
- Did you find Tammy?

818
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,344
- No.

819
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:47,782
- Alan and Tammy are
probably getting it on.

820
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:50,752
- Dammit.

821
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,521
I still gotta finish checking
the movie.

822
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:55,255
- Can't we just go without
screening it?

823
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:56,456
- No, we can't.

824
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,191
I can't.

825
00:50:58,225 --> 00:50:59,994
- We have to see if there are
any flaws.

826
00:51:00,028 --> 00:51:03,363
It's part of our contract
with the studios.

827
00:51:03,397 --> 00:51:04,732
- That's right.

828
00:51:04,766 --> 00:51:06,801
Kyle, go look for Alan.

829
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:09,804
Check the bathrooms, the
closets, and the back door.

830
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,204
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

831
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:12,674
Sheila, go find Tammy.

832
00:51:12,707 --> 00:51:14,576
Search anywhere you
haven't searched already.

833
00:51:14,609 --> 00:51:15,710
- Okay.

834
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:17,712
- I'll be in the back parking
lot looking for her car.

835
00:51:17,745 --> 00:51:19,681
- I thought you said
all the doors were locked.

836
00:51:19,714 --> 00:51:21,081
- They are, I'm just gonna crack
'em open

837
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:22,517
and take a look to be sure.

838
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:25,085
All right, let's go.

839
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:26,788
Pronto.

840
00:51:36,129 --> 00:51:39,199
- Eight bucks for a tub of
popcorn.

841
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:41,869
Man, we really rip people off.

842
00:51:46,206 --> 00:51:47,041
- Tammy?

843
00:51:49,944 --> 00:51:50,778
Tammy?

844
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,413
Tammy!

845
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:04,391
- Huh!

846
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:09,129
Private Jones had one of these
in...

847
00:52:27,048 --> 00:52:29,017
- You find Tammy?

848
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,317
- Nuh-uh.

849
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:31,351
What are you doing?

850
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:32,854
- Just looking.

851
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,659
Got the munchies.

852
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:39,527
- Did you finish your burger?

853
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,728
- Long ago.

854
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:43,564
Besides, Tammy would've thrown
away what was left anyway.

855
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:50,138
- Hey, so what do you think
about Chelsea from box office?

856
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,573
- How do you mean?

857
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,008
- I mean,

858
00:52:55,275 --> 00:52:57,244
would you...

859
00:52:58,278 --> 00:52:59,647
- Would I tap that?

860
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:01,883
- I mean do you think she's
pretty.

861
00:53:04,852 --> 00:53:05,687
- Yeah.

862
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,090
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

863
00:53:10,223 --> 00:53:14,227
- So you would do it with her?

864
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,096
- Mm-hmm.

865
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:19,867
- So why have you not asked her
out?

866
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,036
- 'Cause I don't wanna.

867
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:25,405
- But you just said you'd bang
her.

868
00:53:27,675 --> 00:53:29,944
- Doesn't mean I want
her to be my girlfriend.

869
00:53:50,263 --> 00:53:52,133
Some of the people that work
with movies,

870
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:54,635
they gotta be like crazy
to do all that stuff.

871
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:56,003
- Well, they
are crackheads, right?

872
00:53:56,037 --> 00:53:57,972
- I guess so. They must
be.

873
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,406
- What I've heard.

874
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:00,508
You're it!

875
00:54:01,374 --> 00:54:04,377
- Oh, it's on.

876
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:19,227
- Just give up.

877
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,528
You won't catch me.

878
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:23,965
- You know, I never knew
how facetious you could be.

879
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:26,901
- So, you do give up.

880
00:54:30,403 --> 00:54:31,572
- Mmm...

881
00:54:31,606 --> 00:54:32,707
Nuh-uh.

882
00:54:44,919 --> 00:54:46,721
- Time out, time out, time out,
time out!

883
00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:47,855
- "Time out."

884
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:51,491
- No, seriously. I gotta
go to the bathroom.

885
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,027
- That's convenient.

886
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:55,395
- Oh, come on.

887
00:54:56,264 --> 00:54:59,200
I really gotta go. I drank a
lotta water.

888
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:01,969
- You think
I was born yesterday?

889
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,370
- Okay, trust me.

890
00:55:03,403 --> 00:55:07,175
I swear we will pick this
right back up right here,

891
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,109
when I'm finished.

892
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,179
Plus, I'm on my period.

893
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:14,916
- You said that before.

894
00:55:14,949 --> 00:55:16,117
- Thank you, Kyle.

895
00:55:17,685 --> 00:55:19,386
Are you gonna wait for me?

896
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:22,123
- You want me to?

897
00:55:23,758 --> 00:55:25,259
- Yes.

898
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:28,095
This is to be continued.

899
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:33,366
Kyle.

900
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:39,472
Kyle, Kyle.

901
00:55:39,507 --> 00:55:40,340
Kyle.

902
00:55:45,012 --> 00:55:50,017
♪ Fare thee well, River John ♪

903
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:55,455
♪ Every child's movin' on ♪

904
00:55:55,957 --> 00:55:58,159
♪ Every soul you ♪

905
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,492
- Huh?

906
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,729
- Dude, what are you doing?

907
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:03,798
- Uh, just, uh, waiting for
Sheila.

908
00:56:03,831 --> 00:56:04,665
- Mmm.

909
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,034
Where are Tammy and Alan?

910
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:08,903
- Oh, they're long gone, Fuller.

911
00:56:08,936 --> 00:56:10,972
- We don't know that.
- Yes we do.

912
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:12,874
If Tammy and Alan were having
sex,

913
00:56:12,907 --> 00:56:16,010
Alan would've finished
a long, long time ago.

914
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:17,979
- Okay, even if that were true,

915
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:19,513
their cars are still in the
parking lot,

916
00:56:19,547 --> 00:56:21,215
so they couldn't have gone far.

917
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,219
Go upstairs, check the
projection booth again.

918
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:26,220
- Alrighty.

919
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:31,859
- And Kyle, if I ever catch
you singing like that again,

920
00:56:31,893 --> 00:56:32,927
you're so fired.

921
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,909
These damn kids.

922
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:26,380
- Hello?

923
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:27,248
- Alan?

924
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:30,384
Where the hell are you?

925
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:31,752
- This is Kyle.

926
00:57:31,786 --> 00:57:33,521
I found Alan's phone in the
booth.

927
00:57:35,189 --> 00:57:36,223
- Goddammit.

928
00:57:37,925 --> 00:57:39,193
Well, keep looking.

929
00:57:39,226 --> 00:57:41,128
- Yeah, well, I just found him.

930
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:46,400
Yo, Alan.

931
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:50,237
Fuller is seriously pissed at
you.

932
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:52,974
Man, where you been?

933
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,942
We turned this place upside
down.

934
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,448
Wait a minute.

935
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,986
You were doing the deed with
Tammy, huh?

936
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:08,055
Oh.

937
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,857
Want your phone?

938
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:13,794
Fine, I'll just leave it right
here.

939
00:58:16,063 --> 00:58:19,333
Fuller wants that movie screened
ASAP.

940
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,268
He's getting seriously pissed
about it.

941
00:58:25,406 --> 00:58:26,507
- Kyle?

942
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:31,412
Yoo-hoo!

943
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:37,585
You gonna try to sneak up on me?

944
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:42,790
- Come on, Tammy.

945
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:45,126
Pick up the damn phone.

946
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,896
- Okay, Kyle, don't think
I won't come in there.

947
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:52,366
I'm giving you fair warning.

948
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:56,370
Here I come.

949
00:59:15,423 --> 00:59:16,757
- So?

950
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:19,026
- I told him to start it up.

951
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:20,861
- What was he doing when you
found him?

952
00:59:20,895 --> 00:59:24,465
- Messing around with that
popcorn tub on his head.

953
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:25,366
- All right, that's it.

954
00:59:25,399 --> 00:59:26,734
I'm cutting his hours next week.

955
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:29,303
If he wants to mess with me,
I'm gonna mess with his wallet.

956
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:30,671
- Well, why don't you just
accidentally

957
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:33,207
misplace his paycheck for a few
days?

958
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:39,480
It's not like he'd care or
anything.

959
00:59:39,514 --> 00:59:43,884
He makes more money off torrents
than he does actual work.

960
00:59:49,757 --> 00:59:50,559
- Okay.

961
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,761
So you're not in here.

962
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,131
I feel stupid.

963
00:59:58,499 --> 01:00:00,367
Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.

964
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:07,374
- Goddammit.

965
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:13,214
What a fucking mess.

966
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:16,585
The hell's going on up here?

967
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,955
Son of a bitch.

968
01:00:26,595 --> 01:00:27,428
Hey.

969
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:46,147
- Gotcha!

970
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:57,324
- That whole
popcorn-tub-on-the-head thing

971
01:00:57,358 --> 01:00:59,860
is a bit overplayed, don't you
think?

972
01:00:59,894 --> 01:01:02,597
That better be used, 'cause
those are 40 bucks a case.

973
01:01:03,931 --> 01:01:06,700
Where the hell have you been,
huh?

974
01:01:14,842 --> 01:01:17,178
You know, you are this
close to getting fired.

975
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:19,380
This close.

976
01:01:22,584 --> 01:01:23,951
I know you don't want that.

977
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:27,888
Your little gig here pirating
videos?

978
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:28,789
It'll all be over.

979
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:33,460
You'll be stuck flipping
burgers at a diner all day.

980
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:48,677
- Come on, Kyle.

981
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:51,212
Maybe I'll let you catch me.

982
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:55,783
Catch me, you can have me.

983
01:01:59,588 --> 01:02:01,222
Are you really that clueless?

984
01:02:22,209 --> 01:02:23,043
Kyle?

985
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:43,030
Shit!

986
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:06,353
Alan, stop it!

987
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:12,459
Who are you?

988
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:18,232
- Who am I?

989
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:20,669
I'm the guy that pays to see the
movie.

990
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:21,869
I'm the guy that has to put up
with

991
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:24,706
those inconsiderate pricks
on their cell phones

992
01:03:24,739 --> 01:03:27,308
when they can't take their
conversations elsewhere.

993
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:30,645
And your theater crew, you guys
are doing nothing about it.

994
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,580
So I'm doing something about it.

995
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:34,214
- But why us?

996
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:37,484
Why Kyle? He just works in the
box office.

997
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,187
- He sells the tickets to those
assholes.

998
01:03:42,691 --> 01:03:44,024
- I, um...

999
01:03:44,058 --> 01:03:45,694
Um, I don't know why...

1000
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:48,195
Why not the customers?

1001
01:03:48,228 --> 01:03:50,230
- They'll get theirs soon
enough.

1002
01:03:50,264 --> 01:03:51,633
And that one bum?

1003
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:54,502
The guy, the one you kicked out,
remember?

1004
01:03:54,536 --> 01:03:57,539
Nothing's gonna happen to him
because he didn't piss me off.

1005
01:03:58,939 --> 01:04:03,077
- But we had nothing to do with
it.

1006
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:05,045
- You have everything to do with
it.

1007
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,719
I don't sneak food into the
theater.

1008
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:14,689
I pay for your high-priced
concessions.

1009
01:04:16,725 --> 01:04:18,626
All I want is some peace and
quiet.

1010
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:24,164
I come to the theater
wanting to have a good time.

1011
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,433
I've been waiting for
this movie to come out.

1012
01:04:27,502 --> 01:04:29,804
I waited, I don't want
to do opening weekend

1013
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:32,507
because of all the problems
I would have with people.

1014
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:35,744
I came on a weeknight.

1015
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:38,412
Month after it's out,
weeknight. Can you...

1016
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:39,748
I can't believe this.

1017
01:04:41,014 --> 01:04:41,982
To the last screening

1018
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:44,652
and there's only eight
people in the theater.

1019
01:04:44,686 --> 01:04:46,153
Eight!

1020
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:48,288
But there's always an
asshole in the bunch.

1021
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:52,159
- Okay, I mean, I'm sorry, okay?

1022
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:54,395
Um, I'm really...

1023
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:56,196
I'm really sorry.

1024
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:03,705
But, um...

1025
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:04,572
Um...

1026
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:06,907
- Well, say it.

1027
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,543
I'm waiting. Say it!

1028
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:13,080
- I mean, I mean, I guess
if it's so bad, why...

1029
01:05:13,113 --> 01:05:14,248
Why...

1030
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:16,984
Why don't you just wait
for it to come out on DVD?

1031
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,821
- Fucking bitch.

1032
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:22,222
I don't want to see it on DVD.

1033
01:05:22,256 --> 01:05:25,359
I want to see it in the
theater like it was intended!

1034
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:26,694
Hey! Hey!

1035
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:29,062
You forgot to check my ticket!

1036
01:05:30,497 --> 01:05:32,966
And your popcorn sucks.

1037
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:49,249
Your silence is appreciated.

1038
01:06:24,686 --> 01:06:26,521
Oh, excuse me, guys.
Sorry, watch your feet.

1039
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:28,890
I got big feet, sorry.

1040
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:30,390
Sorry about that. Ooh.

1041
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:31,626
Excuse me. Pardon.

1042
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:34,762
Mmm, shoot, sorry.

1043
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,172
I hope y'all are gonna
enjoy this as much as I do.

1044
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:51,980
Finally.
