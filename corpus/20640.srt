1
00:02:18,173 --> 00:02:20,687
Mr. Burns, any comment
about your possible indictment?

2
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:22,969
I must get to the hospital .
My wife's ill .

3
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:27,248
I' m very sorry. Perhaps
you can empathize with the people. . .

4
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:30,166
. . .who have been wiped out
of their entire life savings.

5
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:32,051
-What about them?
-No comment.

6
00:02:32,293 --> 00:02:33,965
-How many people you hurt?
-No comment.

7
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:35,566
You know how many. . .

8
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:40,648
. . .senior citizens over the age of 65--?

9
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,771
Mr. Burns may have had
no comment for KXBD. . .

10
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,722
. . . but he may be compelled to find
his voice for the district attorney.

11
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,807
Inquiries made by this reporter
prompted an investigation. . .

12
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:55,410
. . .into Ralph Burns and his role
in the Foothill Federal Bank scandal.

13
00:02:56,013 --> 00:02:58,447
-We' re not using that.
-It's an exclusive.

14
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,365
-It's conjecture.
-It is not.

15
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,049
Let me have another crack at him .
Tell him to answer my questions.

16
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,410
-Why?
-You' re not a judge. We' re not a jury.

17
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:09,769
-You know him, right?
-Yes, I know him .

18
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:11,731
-You play golf with him .
-Occasionally.

19
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:15,045
His wife has cancer.
He's under pressure. Leave him alone.

20
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:16,567
Wait. Three questions.

21
00:03:16,813 --> 00:03:17,689
No, no and no.

22
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,651
He's a sleaze.
He stole money.

23
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:21,292
He took the savings of senior citizens.

24
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:24,047
We say that the man has no comment
and we finish the piece.

25
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:26,249
We don't ambush him at his work.

26
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:29,690
I don't want to ambush him .
I just want to ask him one question.

27
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,003
You are relentless, you know that?!

28
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,323
You seem to forget
we cover the news. . .

29
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:37,371
. . .of this area
for the people of this area.

30
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:41,891
And we are not going anyplace.
Are we going anyplace, Max?

31
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:45,083
-If they wanted me back in New York. . . .
-They don't.

32
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,367
You better come to terms with that.
I did .

33
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:53,323
In the 1 1 months that I've been here,
you've gone from a 3 share to a 9.

34
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:54,769
Excuse me!

35
00:03:55,013 --> 00:03:56,844
Excuse me, people!

36
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:00,324
Whose week was it to kiss Max Brackett's
ass for saving this station?!

37
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,768
The bank story might make you
look like network.

38
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:05,163
No, not here.
There's a line I won't cross.

39
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,244
-I' m not asking you to.
-Yes, you are.

40
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:10,644
I am not. I' m saying,
you move the line, you get the story.

41
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:12,326
You going out to the museum?

42
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,847
Yes, trying to get it on
at noon.

43
00:04:14,093 --> 00:04:16,163
Mr. Brackett's taking that assignment.

44
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:19,731
The state has let off
some people down there.

45
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,850
It's a great story.
You'll relate to it.

46
00:04:22,093 --> 00:04:24,891
-I must finish my edit.
-I'll do it. What are friends for?

47
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,652
You really are an asshole.

48
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,407
-What am l?
-A wonderful human being .

49
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,687
Why don't you go to the museum
with Mr. Brackett.

50
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,527
You could run tape while you' re there.
Maybe we'll use it tonight.

51
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:37,922
She's an intern!

52
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:41,802
Then you can be her mentor.
Teach her how to " move the line. "

53
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:47,688
I' m gay.

54
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:09,363
Mr. Brackett. . . .

55
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:10,648
Max.

56
00:05:11,173 --> 00:05:13,004
Can I put a microphone on you?

57
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:17,891
We'll get the curator to tell us why the
museum is facing drastic budget cuts.

58
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,245
And then we'll find
a couple of locals to tell us. . .

59
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,643
. . .that without a museum,
the city's a dog kennel .

60
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:28,727
Then, as a brilliant career move,
you' re taking me to lunch.

61
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,324
-You have to answer.
-You' re done.

62
00:05:33,573 --> 00:05:34,801
Is that the answer?

63
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:36,452
You did it wrong .

64
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:38,684
It's much better on the lapel .

65
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,128
Can you help me?
We' re looking for the curator.

66
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:44,728
I know you. TV, right?

67
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,406
-Right.
-You' re the TV guy.

68
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,048
You' re the museum guy.

69
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,045
No, I' m the guard .

70
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,444
-The museum has financial problems?
-Tell me about it.

71
00:05:53,693 --> 00:05:55,729
There were 2 of us.
The other guy got laid off.

72
00:05:55,973 --> 00:05:58,612
-Is that right?
-You never know who'll be next.

73
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:01,492
Stick around . Maybe we'll get you
to say that on camera.

74
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:02,688
Really?

75
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:05,006
Mrs. Banks' through there.

76
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,971
Right. We don't pay much.

77
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:08,766
More than I make here.

78
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:15,564
They' re not the Mohawks, Mr. Brackett.
The Miwoks are from northern California.

79
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:17,531
They have a very rich past.

80
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:21,812
We currently have on exhibition
the largest display of lndian baskets. . .

81
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:23,771
. . .ever assembled
by a museum of this size.

82
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,322
Some would say it's not responsible. . .

83
00:06:26,573 --> 00:06:28,848
. . .to pour money
into a dying institution.

84
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:32,165
Then let's close down the libraries,
museums and symphonies.

85
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:36,167
If we do not learn from our past,
we will be. . .

86
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,210
. . . doomed to relive it.

87
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:39,363
Yes, Mort.

88
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,682
I see dinosaurs.

89
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,687
The fear of today is that the museum
might share the same fate.

90
00:06:45,173 --> 00:06:46,811
That's right, Mort.

91
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,566
That is exactly the fear.

92
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:50,041
Very good . Thanks.

93
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:51,806
It's okay, Mort.

94
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:54,002
We' re clear.

95
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,724
Good .
You must've done this before.

96
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,089
Good heavens, no. I haven't.

97
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,087
I feel strongly about this museum .
My great-grandfather founded it.

98
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,564
Right. I thank you for your time
and wish you all the best.

99
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:09,964
Come on down from there.

100
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:13,523
In the next room we have a stuffed dodo.
Come and take a look.

101
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,923
Give me the mike.
Get some of this.

102
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:18,807
One's Cretaceous, the other's Jurassic.

103
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:20,691
I know .
Come on, let's go.

104
00:07:21,493 --> 00:07:23,324
Why are they together?

105
00:07:27,053 --> 00:07:29,009
Want to go outside and get B-roll?

106
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:31,323
Where's the bathroom?
I'll freshen up.

107
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:35,045
Get your cam ready.
I'll do a stand-up for tonight's news.

108
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,602
Sorry.

109
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:42,888
Sorry.

110
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:58,850
I' m standing in front of the museum . . .

111
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:02,085
. . .where the past collided
with the hardships of the present.

112
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:06,929
Actually, you' re standing at the urinal
at the museum and look who's here.

113
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:08,526
Your friend, dick.

114
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,331
A fine upstanding young man.

115
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:14,007
No, no longer young
and no longer upstanding .

116
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:17,764
Tell me, dick,
what's your comment on my situation?

117
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,810
Max, I think you should get packed.

118
00:08:20,893 --> 00:08:22,292
I can't. I got screwed there.

119
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,524
That's more than you' re getting here.

120
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,923
And as long as we' re on the subject. . .

121
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,403
. . . I kind of have a little tickle. . .

122
00:08:29,653 --> 00:08:32,042
. . .for that young camera girl
working for you.

123
00:08:32,293 --> 00:08:33,567
Really?

124
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:38,205
She 's young enough to be my daughter.
I know it. She 's just right for me.

125
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,091
You shouldn't be here.

126
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,169
Mrs. Banks, you must listen to me.

127
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:49,927
I don't have to do any such thing .

128
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:52,607
-One minute.
-I told you, there's nothing I can do.

129
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,730
I'd take a reduction, okay?

130
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:56,122
Do you have a hearing problem?

131
00:08:56,373 --> 00:08:57,726
No, no hearing problem .

132
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:00,168
This is completely out of my hands.

133
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,407
You' re wasting both of our times.
You must leave now . Now .

134
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:07,968
Get out of here!

135
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:11,287
Right now !

136
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,091
Now will you listen?

137
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,327
Will you listen?

138
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:29,729
Are you?

139
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:31,292
Are you going to listen to me?

140
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,171
You must be kidding .

141
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:35,205
No, I' m not.

142
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,404
All right, hold up. Hold up.

143
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,964
Now just stay there, okay?

144
00:09:45,213 --> 00:09:46,726
And hush up.

145
00:09:46,973 --> 00:09:48,804
And don't be scared of the gun.

146
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,771
I got to talk to her.

147
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,644
I need 5 minutes with you, that's all .

148
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:56,324
I hope you' re not pointing that at me.

149
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:57,972
Just be quiet.

150
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:00,847
Is this some kind of a joke?

151
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,011
Because it won't be so funny
when the police arrive.

152
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:05,768
Shut up!

153
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:07,886
Give me the keys.

154
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:09,882
Come on.

155
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:14,008
Damn.

156
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:18,362
This way.

157
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:19,762
Quietly.

158
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,123
I hope we get to see some shooting .

159
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:45,412
Van two, this is Laurie.

160
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:48,531
Will you accept a collect call
from Max Brackett?

161
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,364
Mr. Brack-- I mean, Max?

162
00:10:52,613 --> 00:10:54,808
There's a man with a gun in here.

163
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:56,649
Where are you?

164
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:57,723
The museum .

165
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,971
Okay, I' m going to call the police.

166
00:11:00,973 --> 00:11:03,965
Call Lou. We'll go live. The police
we'll call when it's their turn.

167
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:05,771
I think I should call--

168
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:13,403
We have some real news going on here.
Don't blow this.

169
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:15,651
Okay, I'll call Lou.

170
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:19,006
Lou, line 3.
It's Laurie. It's urgent.

171
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,244
It's Brackett again.
What do you got?

172
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,042
Gunman.

173
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:32,127
He's got a rifle and a canvas bag .
I' m guessing more firepower.

174
00:11:32,373 --> 00:11:33,931
He's holding 2 adults and some kids.

175
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,088
Laurie, how soon
before you can power back up?

176
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:39,524
2 minutes.

177
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:40,603
That's too long .

178
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:45,605
Tell Dohlen to get ready to go live
with Max. He's got a hostage situation.

179
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:48,925
Max, Mort's going to throw it to you.
Listen to me.

180
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:52,643
There are kids involved here.
We don't want any grandstanding .

181
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,009
Don't worry.
We got good stuff here.

182
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,288
Keep the line open.

183
00:11:58,453 --> 00:11:59,568
We' re live.

184
00:12:00,293 --> 00:12:03,569
We now go to Max Brackett, who is
inside the Museum of Natural History. . .

185
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:05,326
. . .with a hostage situation.

186
00:12:05,573 --> 00:12:06,483
Can you hear me?

187
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:09,008
Yes, I can.
I am inside the men 's room. . . .

188
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:13,245
Mobilize every camera
and audio crew you can get.

189
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:15,165
Most of them are children.

190
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,449
Do you know what his motives are?

191
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:21,129
I don't. But I can tell you
that the gunman does seem agitated .

192
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:24,928
Can you escape?

193
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:28,329
Can you hear me?

194
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:31,210
Think about what you' re doing .

195
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:32,806
Can you hear me, Max?

196
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:34,965
Does Jen know you' re here?

197
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:43,731
I don't know how much longer I can--

198
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,282
-I want you to be calm .
-No, you be calm .

199
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,727
I got 2 things to tell you.

200
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:51,807
I' m not listening to you as long as
you' re holding that stupid gun.

201
00:12:52,173 --> 00:12:54,448
Why should l? This is absurd .

202
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:57,245
Get that stupid thing away from me!

203
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:08,531
Oh, God !

204
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,568
- That was a shot, right?
-Cut the feed, now .

205
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:22,931
Someone was hit in front of the museum.
I didn 't get a good look at him.

206
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:24,811
What asshole pulled the plug?

207
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:26,327
We' re still live, Max.

208
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:35,128
You did it. You did it.

209
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,049
He's okay.

210
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:43,767
He's okay.

211
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:45,803
He could be dying .

212
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:47,725
-Listen to me.
-Want him to do that on camera?

213
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,327
They didn't pull the plug
when the Challenger blew up.

214
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,647
Our viewers don't need to see the blood .

215
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:57,965
We' re telling them what's happening .
Mort is.

216
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:01,444
We 've got live pictures
and you 're giving them radio.

217
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:02,962
He's right!

218
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,328
It's the story of your career.

219
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,883
In 24 hours, this turns into a gangbang .

220
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:10,921
There's 1 000 people with cameras here.
If you don't record it, they will .

221
00:14:11,173 --> 00:14:13,562
-Please don 't blow this.
-Go.

222
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:14,768
Yeah, move.

223
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:20,169
We have reestablished our live hookup
to the museum . Max, are you there?

224
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:22,529
Yes, Mort, I am still here.

225
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:40,572
Sorry, the camera 's not responding.

226
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,489
Wait a minute, I see a figure. . .

227
00:14:44,773 --> 00:14:46,809
. . .approaching the wounded man.

228
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:49,172
I can 't make him out.

229
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:51,292
Why are we on TV?

230
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,766
Oh, my God .

231
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:56,331
You' re bleeding .

232
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,167
Can you walk?

233
00:14:58,413 --> 00:14:59,641
I don't know .

234
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:03,523
I just called the ambulance.

235
00:15:05,853 --> 00:15:07,366
That's Laurie Callahan.

236
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:09,445
Max, how are the children?

237
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:12,685
These kids are very frightened.
They're terrified.

238
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,328
They' re together
in one corner of the lobby. . .

239
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:18,007
. . .with the curator
on the floor next to them .

240
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,845
The teacher is tending to them.

241
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:21,606
Trying to keep them calm.

242
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:26,051
Mort, the situation has shifted
dramatically. A man has been shot.

243
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,252
A line has been crossed.
We have a very dangerous situation here.

244
00:15:30,533 --> 00:15:31,682
It reminds me. . .

245
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,969
. . .two years ago. . . .
Oh, God .

246
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:41,765
We' re live on the air.
Max Brackett, KXBD News.

247
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,890
Want to tell us why you' re here?

248
00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:45,646
You don't? Okay.

249
00:15:49,373 --> 00:15:51,284
-We lost him .
-What happened?

250
00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:55,841
Can you hear me?

251
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,204
Max Brackett, are you there?

252
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:01,205
Max, are you there?

253
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:06,884
We 've lost contact momentarily with
Max Brackett, reporting from the museum.

254
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,124
This is not news, brothers and sisters.

255
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:14,368
Stories like this happen every day.

256
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:19,050
What we have here is news
for all time in the Word of God .

257
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:37,610
I want you people out of there!
Back up! There's an armed man inside!

258
00:16:37,853 --> 00:16:38,888
This is dangerous!

259
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,886
Franklin, Johnson,
I want those people off the steps now !

260
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,122
What happened?

261
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:46,889
Can you tell me who shot you?
How do you feel?

262
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:51,806
Sir, can you tell us who shot you?
Are you all right?

263
00:16:53,853 --> 00:16:57,129
Sir, can you tell us who shot you?
One man? Two men?

264
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:58,965
There's the chief!

265
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:02,091
Chief Lemke, do you
have any plans yet?! Do you know--?!

266
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:03,892
Do you have a statement?

267
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,891
What are you going to do?

268
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,770
Our cameraperson has informed us. . .

269
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,573
. . . that the victim 's name
is Clifford Williams. . .

270
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,451
. . .a security guard at the museum.

271
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:15,648
Mom !

272
00:17:15,893 --> 00:17:17,042
It's Dad .

273
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:22,407
Coming up. . .

274
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:27,363
. . .an unexpected role for pigeons here
in New York today at the United Nations.

275
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,485
We'll have that story and more. . .

276
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:31,007
. . .when we return.

277
00:17:31,253 --> 00:17:32,572
We' re back in two.

278
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:36,283
I heard you talking
during the broadcast. What's up?

279
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,205
Hostage situation.

280
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,123
Who's feeding it?

281
00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,489
It's our affiliate
in Madeline, California.

282
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,927
Guess who the reporter is?

283
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:46,888
-Who?
-Max Brackett.

284
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,966
I knew that bastard would pop up again
with something spectacular.

285
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:51,043
Absolutely.

286
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:54,331
Here's the tease you' re going to use
at the top of the hour.

287
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,406
I' m not sharing a broadcast with him .
He's a loose cannon.

288
00:17:57,653 --> 00:18:02,249
Say, "The situation's still unfolding .
Tune in tonight for an update. "

289
00:18:02,613 --> 00:18:06,401
I' m not saying that. I' m not
teasing a story I know nothing about.

290
00:18:06,773 --> 00:18:08,923
I promise them a story
and it evaporates.

291
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,733
How does that make me look?
How does that make the network look?

292
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:12,723
It's from above.

293
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,123
We' re back in 30.

294
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:21,649
Goddamn foolishness just because
somebody thinks this is a good lead-in.

295
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:24,209
With Brackett, it won't evaporate.

296
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:27,368
Kevin. . .

297
00:18:27,613 --> 00:18:29,649
. . .it's a guy getting shot. . .

298
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,451
. . . bunch of kids taken hostage.

299
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,172
It's good television.

300
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,812
And no other net has it.

301
00:18:35,053 --> 00:18:38,090
The man can't be trusted .
I' m not broadcasting . . .

302
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,608
. . .with that crazy son of a bitch.
Remember what he did?

303
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,923
It was before the beginning of time.

304
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,164
5 and 4, 3. . . .

305
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:51,561
Call Madeline.
Find out how Brackett got there.

306
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:54,043
I want to know
what the hell he's doing there.

307
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:58,161
Now that the gunman has shown
a willingness to use firepower. . . .

308
00:18:59,413 --> 00:19:00,766
It was an accident, moron.

309
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:04,641
-Boys!
-It's broken.

310
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,805
I just want my job back.

311
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,083
Now look at this.
Look at this!

312
00:19:15,413 --> 00:19:18,564
Look at this!
I' m never going to get my job back now .

313
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,123
Everybody knows who I am,
where l--

314
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,850
Your fault. Everyone knows where I am
because of you.

315
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:32,523
Everyone knows you' re here
because you shot someone.

316
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,092
Shut up, newsboy.

317
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:37,690
You really did this
to get your job back?

318
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:39,927
What do you think?

319
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:43,726
That's for you.

320
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:50,129
If you make contact. . .

321
00:19:50,573 --> 00:19:54,964
. . .tell them everyone is okay in here.
You'll buy yourself some time.

322
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:59,886
I'll tell them they better back off
because I will shoot someone.

323
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,727
This first one will be you.
I'll throw your body out the front door.

324
00:20:02,973 --> 00:20:04,406
I wouldn't do that.

325
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:05,689
Why not?

326
00:20:05,933 --> 00:20:10,404
That'll just make everybody jumpy. They
might do something we'll all regret.

327
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:16,841
Remember that hostage situation
in Torrance about 2 years ago?

328
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,970
Yeah, car dealership.

329
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:21,091
4 people died .
One was the gunman.

330
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,129
Shut up.

331
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,409
I was there.
I covered that story.

332
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,683
This is Chief Alvin Lemke.

333
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,686
Am I speaking to the man responsible
for this situation?

334
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:37,892
Yep, you are.

335
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:39,965
Could I have your name, please?

336
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:41,569
No.

337
00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,846
How's that guy? Cliff?
ls he all right?

338
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:50,210
No, he's in the hospital !
May I have your name, please?

339
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,212
Listen. . .

340
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,691
. . .you must know I didn't mean
to shoot him . That was an accident.

341
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,730
That's good .
That's a good thing .

342
00:20:57,973 --> 00:21:00,851
We will take that into account
if you give up now .

343
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:02,642
No.

344
00:21:04,653 --> 00:21:06,883
-I don't think so.
-No, he's a killer.

345
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,845
I don't think I can do that.

346
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:12,484
What do you want?
What are your demands?

347
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:13,449
My what?

348
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,365
What do you want?

349
00:21:17,413 --> 00:21:18,641
Hold on.

350
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:23,053
He said, "What are my demands?"

351
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:24,563
Tell him .

352
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:27,043
I don't have any.
I didn't plan on this.

353
00:21:28,373 --> 00:21:32,446
I don't wish to appear hostile,
but you' re making my job difficult.

354
00:21:32,893 --> 00:21:35,805
Tell them that you'll talk
when you' re good and ready.

355
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:38,009
And no bodies out the front door.

356
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,208
Right.

357
00:21:41,173 --> 00:21:45,485
I want everybody to back off and I' m
going to talk when I' m good and ready.

358
00:21:47,093 --> 00:21:48,970
Hello?
He hung up.

359
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:50,568
How was that?

360
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,121
Sounded good to me.

361
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:54,443
That was good .
That was good .

362
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,931
Why don't you sit down?

363
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:04,367
Just sit down.

364
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:08,562
All right now . . .

365
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,246
. . .what's next?

366
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:13,162
You give up
or you get yourself some demands.

367
00:22:13,813 --> 00:22:15,769
-Like what?
-Money.

368
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:19,210
-Ransom .
-No, I can't take money I didn't earn.

369
00:22:19,453 --> 00:22:20,442
I want my job back.

370
00:22:20,693 --> 00:22:25,289
No, you got to ask for a fast car,
or a Lear jet or a Greyhound bus.

371
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,969
You have to have a valid demand
or you'll make them nervous.

372
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:31,169
I came here to get my job back.

373
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:32,641
Why did you bring a gun?

374
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,406
-I want her to listen!
-Who?

375
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:35,529
Mrs. Banks!

376
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,527
Look. . .

377
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:42,402
. . . I can't go out there.
If I do, I'll be put in prison.

378
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,803
I can't take care of my family
in prison.

379
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:47,089
There's different ways of giving up.

380
00:22:48,053 --> 00:22:49,042
What?

381
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:51,443
-Which way?
-Can I show you something?

382
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,411
Here.
No, that's dangerous.

383
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:56,645
You got another window in this place?
Now, listen.

384
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,083
Slowly.

385
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,607
Slowly.

386
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,002
-Have you ever been arrested?
-No.

387
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:02,732
That's very good .

388
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:04,372
American bald eagle.

389
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:08,687
I want you to look at this.

390
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:11,168
See those people?

391
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,522
Not the cops, not the news media.

392
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:18,445
I want you to look. Go on.

393
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:19,569
See?

394
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:21,041
The people.

395
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,771
-That's public opinion.
-I guess so.

396
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:27,403
That's a powerful force.
You got a problem right now .

397
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,652
Those people hate your guts.

398
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:34,961
You' re holding kids hostage
and that's a no-no.

399
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,044
At best, they think you' re nuts.

400
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,362
But I' m not.

401
00:23:38,613 --> 00:23:42,083
I mean, not usually.
Jenny tells me I don't think.

402
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:44,043
Who's Jenny?

403
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:46,443
-My wife.
-And you' re--?

404
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:48,843
"Sam . "

405
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:52,529
I don't think you' re crazy.

406
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:55,367
You' re just an ordinary guy
who's popped his top.

407
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:57,888
But you must connect
with those people out there.

408
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:02,649
They know what it's like to lose their
job, or they know someone who has.

409
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,966
They'll understand
if you give them a chance.

410
00:24:07,453 --> 00:24:10,889
The one thing you might want to do
before you give yourself up. . .

411
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,125
. . .is let those people know
what you' re about.

412
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:15,529
How?

413
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:18,686
If I put a camera on you right now
and I interview you. . .

414
00:24:18,933 --> 00:24:22,812
. . .and you tell people what's going on,
I think they'll want to know .

415
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:25,481
Don't you?

416
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:27,002
No.

417
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:29,765
That's your jury pool out there.

418
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,242
All right.

419
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,089
Exchange the kids for the interview .

420
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:38,288
No.

421
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:42,411
You help them, they help you.

422
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:45,089
One.

423
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,732
One, that's it.

424
00:24:46,973 --> 00:24:47,962
One's good .

425
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,452
No, I can't do that. I can't put
a hostage-taker on television.

426
00:24:55,693 --> 00:24:56,489
I understand.

427
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:59,566
He's insisting
that I put him on right now .

428
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:05,252
"As a good faith gesture,
I will let one child go.

429
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:08,610
Once Mr. Brackett has put me on TV,
I will . . .

430
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,809
. . . I will consider
releasing the others. "

431
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,203
No, you let everybody go first.

432
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:14,363
Hold on.

433
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:18,572
-He said let everybody go first.
-He can't negotiate with your emotions.

434
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,246
Unacceptable!

435
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,843
Don't negotiate my emotions.

436
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:29,052
Hello Sheriff Lemke, Max Brackett.
I know the rules about these things--

437
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,170
Is he listening to us?

438
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:34,007
-No, sir, he's not.
-Is he pointing his weapon at you?

439
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:39,407
I can guarantee Mr. Baily's sincere. I
think that things'll become unstable. . .

440
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,166
. . .if you don 't grant him this.

441
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:42,402
Jesus!

442
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,282
I don't like this.

443
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:46,489
-I know you don't.
-Tell him I' m upset.

444
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:48,803
But this man is very upset, sir.

445
00:25:49,093 --> 00:25:52,130
Things are very unpredictable here.

446
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,166
All right, look. . . .

447
00:25:56,773 --> 00:25:59,526
Okay, but I want this over quickly,
understand?

448
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:03,842
Someone.

449
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:06,411
That's all you' re going to get.

450
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:12,252
They'll want to know what's in the bag .

451
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:14,563
Nothing .

452
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:15,723
May I look?

453
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,372
Oh, man!

454
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:27,166
My brother-in-law uses it
to clear stumps away on his farm .

455
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:28,482
Why'd you bring it?

456
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:31,691
Because I wanted
Mrs. Banks to believe I was serious.

457
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:33,605
The gun's not enough?

458
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:36,044
I wanted to impress her!

459
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:39,724
What are you going to do with it?

460
00:26:40,053 --> 00:26:41,532
I just want to go home.

461
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,843
You don't need it anymore.
I'll take it.

462
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,369
Now, go. Now, just go.

463
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:51,652
How do I know you' re coming back?

464
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,642
Because you' re the best show in town.

465
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,492
Wait a minute.
Wait!

466
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:57,643
Come here.

467
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:00,003
I need to ask you something .

468
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:04,173
I need you to talk to my wife, okay?

469
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:07,328
Because when she finds out about this. . .

470
00:27:07,573 --> 00:27:09,882
. . .she's going to be upset big-time.

471
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,164
The press will be all over her.

472
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:13,766
Oh, man!

473
00:27:14,413 --> 00:27:17,610
That's okay. Want me to fix it
so I' m the only one who talks to her?

474
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:18,883
-Only me?
-Just you.

475
00:27:19,133 --> 00:27:20,122
You got it.

476
00:27:20,853 --> 00:27:22,081
You watch yourself.

477
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:26,562
Chief!

478
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:32,612
Stay here.

479
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:45,008
Mr. Brackett,
are the children all right?!

480
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:47,608
Go get your camera.

481
00:27:47,853 --> 00:27:49,923
-How are the kids?
-The kids are fine.

482
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:51,162
What's the story?

483
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:55,884
The story is he has enough dynamite to
level the place, so don't piss him off.

484
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:56,883
Jesus!

485
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:57,963
Excuse me.

486
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,685
I' m Mr. Brackett's assistant.

487
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:01,809
Come here.

488
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:03,042
Don't get cocky.

489
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:06,524
You want to make your TV show,
then you cooperate with me.

490
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:08,126
You scratch my back. . . .

491
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:12,525
Notice all the cameras are on my back
and your face is on the channels.

492
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:15,890
When I go in front of the camera,
I'll say you' re in charge.

493
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:18,124
-May I go now?
-What's his name?

494
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:19,488
Sam Baily.

495
00:28:19,733 --> 00:28:20,848
Please?

496
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:22,526
-You may go.
-You' re hitting a pressure point.

497
00:28:22,773 --> 00:28:25,446
-I know I am .
-I got the parents right over here.

498
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:31,653
Can you tell us
what's going on in there?

499
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:34,083
I just want to say
that your children are fine.

500
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:39,009
We' re doing everything we can to resolve
the situation as soon as possible.

501
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:42,929
You won't believe this,
but your kids are playing inside.

502
00:28:43,653 --> 00:28:44,688
When will it end?

503
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:48,323
The police don't have any control
so some news guy's running things?

504
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:50,211
I' m not running anything .

505
00:28:50,733 --> 00:28:53,247
What would happen
if I decided to get my kid?

506
00:28:53,493 --> 00:28:54,846
That wouldn't be a good idea.

507
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:56,528
That's right.

508
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:59,685
You'd put everyone's kids in danger.
Mister Mayor.

509
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:04,207
Cochran and I are doing everything to
make sure your kids are home for dinner.

510
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:08,048
Don't talk to the press.
Network orders. We' re going national .

511
00:29:08,293 --> 00:29:09,408
What's going on?

512
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:11,405
Sorry, we've been promoted .

513
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:15,451
You 'll have to turn on the news
when I report it.

514
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:16,887
We go now to Max Brackett. . .

515
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:20,842
. . . for an exclusive report
on the situation in the museum.

516
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:25,803
It's good to see you safe.
This is a remarkable job you' re doing .

517
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:28,203
Thank you, Mort.
I was just. . . .

518
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:31,883
I'm just happy I was in a position
to help the children.

519
00:29:32,133 --> 00:29:33,771
I'm optimistic that Mr. Baily--

520
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:37,801
Should we bring Broyles down from
San Francisco if this takes hold?

521
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:40,684
We can ask, but what for?

522
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,771
Brackett was born for this job.

523
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:43,889
Look at him .

524
00:29:44,573 --> 00:29:45,767
He's a pig in shit.

525
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:48,846
Kevin, anyone ever feel him out
for anchor work?

526
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:50,287
That's an anchor?!

527
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:52,162
Look at him .

528
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:55,209
I wouldn't even
buy a new car from that guy.

529
00:29:55,453 --> 00:29:59,332
He'd never sit behind a desk. He wanted
to be where the bullets were flying .

530
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:02,804
Then he got too hot to keep around
after your little incident.

531
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,732
Little incident?

532
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,651
Are we suffering from memory loss?

533
00:30:07,253 --> 00:30:09,209
He did his two years in the sticks.

534
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:11,921
He learned his lesson.
He chilled .

535
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:16,609
Max, we understand you are going back
inside the museum.

536
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:19,731
Yes. Mr. Baily has agreed
to release one child.

537
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:22,933
What about that girl in the glasses?

538
00:30:23,213 --> 00:30:26,091
-You' re asking me?
-I got to choose somebody.

539
00:30:27,613 --> 00:30:29,490
-Do you have children?
-I have two.

540
00:30:29,933 --> 00:30:32,367
-Could you bear saving just one?
-Quiet.

541
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:37,647
Let all of them go. That's how you'll
get people to sympathize with you.

542
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:43,563
Everybody's going to get to go home.
You just got to take turns.

543
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:47,931
I would like to say I stand by to offer
whatever help I can give, and hope. . .

544
00:30:48,173 --> 00:30:51,882
. . .there will be a peaceful resolution,
without further violence.

545
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:54,126
Be careful, Max. . .

546
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:55,368
. . .and Godspeed.

547
00:30:55,613 --> 00:30:57,524
Thank you. Godspeed .

548
00:30:57,773 --> 00:31:00,412
-We' re clear.
-Mort has Shakespeare writing for him .

549
00:31:00,653 --> 00:31:01,881
We were number one.

550
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,009
What happened with the guard?

551
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:05,085
What do you mean?

552
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,085
You left the camera
and went to help him .

553
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,369
He was hurt.

554
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:11,968
Why didn't you take the camera
if you' re going to be so humane?

555
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:14,888
Because I can't--

556
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,931
I can't hold a camera
and help someone at the same time.

557
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:19,731
By not having your camera. . .

558
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:22,965
. . .we lost footage
nobody else would have had .

559
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:26,603
You must decide whether you are
going to be part of a story. . .

560
00:31:26,853 --> 00:31:28,411
. . .or record the story.

561
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:30,291
Max, it's Lou.

562
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:34,282
I want you with me
from the start to the end of the story.

563
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,131
Hi, Lou.
You having fun?

564
00:31:38,373 --> 00:31:41,763
I send you out for some fluff and
you come back with a hostage situation.

565
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:45,801
I guess I' m just not
one of your fluffy kind of reporters.

566
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:49,126
He's an average guy. He's married .
He's got kids. He flipped .

567
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:50,931
And now he's the Terminator.

568
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:52,162
What does he want?

569
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:55,132
Wants his job back. Wants to be heard .
A little dignity.

570
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:57,126
And we' re stuck in the middle.

571
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,728
It's a good place to be.
If you 're uncomfortable with it. . .

572
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:01,811
. . .we don't have a contract.

573
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:04,772
-I can go to another channel .
- The network called.

574
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:07,481
Looks like
you' re back in the big saddle.

575
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:09,692
There's nothing like old friends.

576
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:36,048
Look at this jerk.
What a showboat!

577
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,448
Zoom in.

578
00:32:51,293 --> 00:32:53,170
It's a military helicopter!

579
00:32:55,253 --> 00:32:57,050
Which one gets to leave?

580
00:32:58,133 --> 00:33:00,089
I was thinking of that girl
in the glasses.

581
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,288
Which one?

582
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:03,762
That one.

583
00:33:04,093 --> 00:33:05,287
Let's give them two.

584
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:07,728
-No, I said one.
-You shot a black man.

585
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:10,168
Some people
are going to make an issue of that.

586
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:14,292
Show kindness to a black, it's harder
to play the race card against you.

587
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:16,527
You understand?

588
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:18,604
Two kids are being released !

589
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,366
Hurry up!

590
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:27,725
All right, what happened?

591
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:33,090
Did he treat you okay?!
Let them say something !

592
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:35,563
Right next to the man.
There she is.

593
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,565
Maybe I'll see my mom .

594
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:39,212
I hope I see my mom .

595
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:40,169
Look!

596
00:33:40,413 --> 00:33:41,766
A bigger one.

597
00:33:43,253 --> 00:33:47,007
I came in. I don't know,
I was twenty minutes late and . . . .

598
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:51,402
You see, the night before
we had a softball game. We won.

599
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,645
I had a double and a triple.

600
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:58,610
So we were happy. We had a party
and I had, I don't know . . .

601
00:33:58,853 --> 00:34:00,844
. . .three beers,
something like that.

602
00:34:01,093 --> 00:34:05,609
The next day I came into work
and Mrs. Banks told me to come in--

603
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,413
Leave out the part about the ball game,
and the drinks.

604
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:13,329
-Yeah, but we drank. I mean, I drank.
-Sure, but that's not why you got fired .

605
00:34:13,693 --> 00:34:17,402
Let's not give them that impression.
Start from " Mrs. Banks. . . . "

606
00:34:17,653 --> 00:34:22,090
Mrs. Banks-- See, she didn't ask me.
She tells you what to do, okay?

607
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:26,645
It's like those dinosaurs.
Her great-granddaddy made, I mean. . .

608
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:29,646
. . . he just put them there
and that's enough for her.

609
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:32,009
I have no clue
as to what you' re talking about.

610
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:35,404
-She does.
-We can leave out the dinosaurs.

611
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,762
Mrs. Banks said . . . .

612
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:39,129
"We have two security guards. . .

613
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:42,251
. . .we don't need them
because we must cut back on money.

614
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:45,565
We only need one. So Cliff,
who's been around here longer. . .

615
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:47,212
. . .and he, you know . . . . "

616
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:51,731
So I said, "All right, fine. I'll take
less money or I'll take less hours. "

617
00:34:52,493 --> 00:34:53,528
She didn't listen.

618
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:57,402
Did it ever occur to you
that I might deal with problems. . .

619
00:34:57,653 --> 00:34:59,689
. . . bigger than your personal economics?

620
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,562
That my job is running the museum,
not my employee's careers?

621
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:05,929
I came to you twice, you didn't see--

622
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:07,447
I couldn't at that moment.

623
00:35:08,013 --> 00:35:09,969
Well, don't turn around .

624
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:12,285
You only want things your way.

625
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:17,169
Walk over there and make sure
the buffalo are grazing properly.

626
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:18,448
Bison.

627
00:35:18,693 --> 00:35:19,603
I stand corrected .

628
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,252
Let me ask you something .

629
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:25,327
Is this the first time you came
to see her? Today? Mrs. Banks?

630
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,723
No. The second time.

631
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:28,962
The second time.

632
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:32,410
I want you to tell me what
you were feeling when she fired you.

633
00:35:34,693 --> 00:35:37,526
-This will sound stupid but. . . .
-Go ahead .

634
00:35:37,853 --> 00:35:41,641
You know that thing in a car
that measures miles?

635
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:44,771
-The meter.
-It goes back to zero.

636
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,810
That's what was going on in my mind .

637
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:49,772
I couldn't tell my wife.

638
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,882
You couldn't tell her you were fired?

639
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:57,365
Then I'd get dressed for work every day,
like a fool, and . . .

640
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,764
. . . I'd just go to some movie theater
and just spend the day. . .

641
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:03,004
. . .sitting, eating popcorn, thinking .

642
00:36:03,253 --> 00:36:06,051
And today, when you came here,
what did you want?

643
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:07,885
I just wanted her to listen.

644
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:09,886
Did you want to hurt her?

645
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,521
Not really.

646
00:36:16,573 --> 00:36:20,407
Why would you grab a gun and explosives
if you didn't want to hurt her?

647
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:22,883
I don't know .

648
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:24,361
You have to know .

649
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:26,924
Sam, this is critical .

650
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:30,609
When you grabbed that gun,
what went on in your head?

651
00:36:33,293 --> 00:36:34,851
I thought about my babies.

652
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:37,129
That's a good point.
What about them?

653
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:41,685
You see, if I lose my job,
I lose my house and my benefits. . .

654
00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:44,731
. . .and I can't take care of them
if I lose my benefits.

655
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:49,524
I' m in front of Sam Baily's house,
and I' m joined by his best friend . . .

656
00:36:49,773 --> 00:36:51,411
. . .Travis Bartholomew .

657
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,562
That's right. I know Sam well .

658
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:56,166
We go fishing and stuff.

659
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:59,211
So, what's he like?
ls he weird or what?

660
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:01,643
Who is he?

661
00:37:02,413 --> 00:37:03,562
Who is this guy?

662
00:37:03,813 --> 00:37:05,690
You could say he 's pretty weird.

663
00:37:06,013 --> 00:37:07,571
Does he have a temper?

664
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:09,281
Temper?

665
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:12,332
If we could talk to a few of them . . . .

666
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:17,011
Mr. Brackett said that
we were only to talk just to him .

667
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:19,011
He says it's better for Sam .

668
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:20,527
Dangerous, yeah.

669
00:37:20,773 --> 00:37:21,808
Dangerous.

670
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:23,372
Whatever, you know?

671
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:26,606
You heard it
from the best friend of Sam Baily.

672
00:37:26,853 --> 00:37:28,002
Thank you very much.

673
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:30,562
How could Sam do this to us?

674
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:31,689
How could he?

675
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:35,892
There appears to be activity
in the house. Let's get a statement.

676
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:37,646
They' re standing in my flowers!

677
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:38,928
That does it!

678
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,367
That does it!

679
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:45,366
Would you get out of my flowers?
Do not stand in my flowers!

680
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:51,765
Has your husband been in contact
with you? Can we get a statement?

681
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:57,523
I' m here. Jackson is with the victim's
wife. I' m being completely blocked out.

682
00:38:05,013 --> 00:38:06,810
-Ready?
-Anytime.

683
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:08,768
Roll .

684
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:12,085
Your husband was kept on at the museum .

685
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:15,166
The man who was let go, a white man,
came back and shot him .

686
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:17,881
Do you feel
race had anything to do with that?

687
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:20,164
Cliff and Sam were friends.

688
00:38:20,413 --> 00:38:23,132
Sam didn't blame Cliff
for what happened .

689
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,568
At least, I don't think he did .

690
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:31,965
Christ, I' m going to hate this.

691
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:35,441
Chief, showtime.

692
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:36,808
Here we go.

693
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:42,086
It's about to start.

694
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:47,569
We take you now, live,
inside the Museum of Natural History. . .

695
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:49,132
. . . to meet the hostage-taker.

696
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:53,923
We now bring you an exclusive report.

697
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:56,687
Max Brackett is inside the siege.

698
00:38:56,933 --> 00:38:57,968
Key in the graphic.

699
00:38:58,213 --> 00:39:00,602
You are Sam Baily
and you 're a loving husband. . .

700
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:03,048
. . .and a devoted father of two.

701
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:06,410
You've got a mortgage,
car payments, medical bills. . .

702
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:11,363
. . .food bills, electricity bills,
gas bills, clothing bills. . .

703
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:13,646
. . .and, by the way. . .

704
00:39:14,013 --> 00:39:15,207
. . .you' re fired .

705
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,406
I just want to say that I' m . . . .

706
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:27,564
I didn't mean to shoot that guy, Cliff.

707
00:39:27,813 --> 00:39:29,485
That was an accident.

708
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:31,366
And . . . .

709
00:39:34,453 --> 00:39:36,887
I used to complain about my paycheck.

710
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,446
And then when. . .

711
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:41,490
. . .when I didn't get it no more. . .

712
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:44,486
. . . I realized that was the last. . . .

713
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,884
That little piece of paper
was the only thing . . .

714
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,691
. . . holding my life together.

715
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:51,452
And . . . .

716
00:39:52,213 --> 00:39:53,532
You know, when I seen. . .

717
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,731
. . . I seen
people out on the street living . . .

718
00:39:56,973 --> 00:39:58,645
. . .and . . .

719
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:00,249
. . . I thought. . .

720
00:40:00,493 --> 00:40:03,929
. . . they were maybe
like bums or like junkies.

721
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,524
And then one day. . .

722
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,491
. . .I seen this family live. . . .

723
00:40:08,893 --> 00:40:11,361
I seen this family living in a box
and. . .

724
00:40:12,213 --> 00:40:15,649
. . . I imagined my babies living
in that box and I couldn't stand it.

725
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,292
I went crazy.

726
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:20,481
And . . .

727
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:22,252
. . .about the gun. . . .

728
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:25,644
It's just a Remington gun.
It ain 't nothing, really.

729
00:40:25,893 --> 00:40:28,851
It's just. . . .
I've seen on TV shows. . .

730
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:32,972
. . .where they flash a gun
and it gets them attention.

731
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:36,011
I thought
maybe if I brought the gun in. . .

732
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:39,131
. . .that Mrs. Banks,
who's my boss. . .

733
00:40:39,373 --> 00:40:41,011
. . .she would . . .

734
00:40:41,253 --> 00:40:45,610
. . .she would listen, you know,
for maybe just even five minutes.

735
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:49,051
You know, but. . .

736
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,405
. . . I don't know
if people listen to guys like me.

737
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:57,363
I'm just a guy that has a job, goes to
work everyday and people don 't listen.

738
00:40:57,693 --> 00:41:00,730
We' re a good family.
We don't do drugs. . .

739
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:03,123
. . .and we don't cause trouble.

740
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:04,488
We go to church.

741
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:06,689
I go to church too,
with my family.

742
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:10,767
But I don't think anybody listens
to someone like me.

743
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,652
I don 't think anybody cares
about someone like us.

744
00:41:13,893 --> 00:41:15,690
This guy shot a man in cold blood . . .

745
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,766
. . .and I feel like bringing him home
for Christmas dinner.

746
00:41:19,573 --> 00:41:22,451
Let's run a nationwide poll
and see how this guy is playing .

747
00:41:25,813 --> 00:41:28,452
I don't know if anybody's listening .

748
00:41:28,693 --> 00:41:29,409
Are they?

749
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,847
Your name is Sam Baily. . .

750
00:41:31,093 --> 00:41:32,970
. . .and the law is pushing in on you.

751
00:41:33,213 --> 00:41:37,411
Because of one impulsive act, you' re
trapped in the fight of your life.

752
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:39,052
Your sole demand, Sam . . .

753
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:41,807
. . .is simple
to the point of absurdity. . .

754
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:44,328
. . .and yet dauntingly complex,
isn't it?

755
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:46,451
I just want the police to--

756
00:41:46,813 --> 00:41:49,725
I just want everybody
to forget about it. . .

757
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:51,247
. . .and let me go home.

758
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:53,492
Yeah, right.

759
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:57,410
I feel so bad about what I did to Cliff.
He 's my friend.

760
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:02,843
I'm praying for him.

761
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:06,287
And I know when he feels better,
he 'll forgive me.

762
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,012
I' m sorry, Cliff.

763
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:14,244
The kids, you know, they' re fine.
They' re happy.

764
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:15,448
Look.

765
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:17,366
They' re okay.

766
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:21,209
Look, we' re on TV!

767
00:42:23,093 --> 00:42:24,492
Kids, please sit down.

768
00:42:24,733 --> 00:42:27,247
The kids,
they' re seeing themselves on TV.

769
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:31,047
Start over right now about the kids.

770
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:32,521
Talk about the kids.

771
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:36,366
I'd never hurt them .
I would never hurt them .

772
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:39,411
I got kids of my own.

773
00:42:40,893 --> 00:42:45,489
I just don't have a job to take care
of them . I don't know how I will .

774
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:48,725
But ljust want to say I'm sorry.
I couldn 't be sorrier.

775
00:42:51,253 --> 00:42:53,972
-That's my daddy.
-Phillip, come back here.

776
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:55,607
Come here.

777
00:42:56,453 --> 00:42:58,444
Mommy wants to watch Daddy.

778
00:43:00,733 --> 00:43:03,770
I just want to go home, okay?
Just. . . .

779
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:07,088
I want to go.

780
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:11,087
And that's my demand .
That's it, right there.

781
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:15,248
Hey, wait.

782
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,006
Sam, wait.

783
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:19,403
I hope I don't have to
go through that again.

784
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:23,081
We' re not finished yet.
You know why?

785
00:43:23,333 --> 00:43:27,611
Because people watching this right now
are saying, "Yeah, right.

786
00:43:27,853 --> 00:43:30,447
This guy's holding a gun
on a bunch of helpless kids--"

787
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:34,288
I ain't holding no gun
on no helpless kids! They' re okay.

788
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:37,445
They think you are.
And they think you should be shot. . .

789
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:38,728
. . .executed . . .

790
00:43:38,973 --> 00:43:40,042
. . .strung up.

791
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:44,851
For the people who are saying this,
what do you have to say to them?

792
00:43:45,093 --> 00:43:47,084
I hope you never go through this.

793
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,891
You say it to them .

794
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:56,363
I hope nobody ever has to go through
what I' m going through now, that's all .

795
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,089
Your name is Sam Baily. . .

796
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:04,211
. . .and you' re asking
for the most poignant ransom of all :

797
00:44:04,453 --> 00:44:05,727
Forgiveness.

798
00:44:06,173 --> 00:44:08,733
And while we all have it
in our hearts to give. . .

799
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:09,883
. . .we' re not the law .

800
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:12,328
Why'd you bring up that shotgun stuff?

801
00:44:12,573 --> 00:44:15,963
Reporting exclusively for KXBD News,
I'm Max Brackett.

802
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,081
We' re clear.
I thought it was great.

803
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:23,563
-Why'd you bring up the shotgun?
-It was for your own benefit.

804
00:44:23,813 --> 00:44:25,041
It didn't seem like it.

805
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:26,851
Believe me, it was important.

806
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,446
All right, now what?

807
00:44:30,693 --> 00:44:31,921
Now what?

808
00:44:33,853 --> 00:44:35,047
Now we wait.

809
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,645
Take a look out there.

810
00:44:49,893 --> 00:44:50,882
Is anybody listening?

811
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:52,407
Is anybody listening

812
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:53,927
Careful .

813
00:44:55,133 --> 00:44:56,361
See what I mean?

814
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:01,284
-What do you got?
-Baily's all over the place.

815
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:03,364
Television, radio, newspapers.

816
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:06,127
Take a look
at the front page of the Times.

817
00:45:09,493 --> 00:45:11,006
Turn the radio up a little.

818
00:45:11,253 --> 00:45:14,928
This guy has never broken a law
in his life. He is under pressure.

819
00:45:15,173 --> 00:45:19,086
We can all understand,
and so I think we should let him walk.

820
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,768
The situation's a shame, isn't it?

821
00:45:22,253 --> 00:45:24,369
Man takes children hostage. . . .

822
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:28,565
This is America.
It can make you crazy.

823
00:45:29,173 --> 00:45:31,209
Hollander arrived the next morning and--

824
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:35,043
You'll see why Hollander
still hates Brackett's guts.

825
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:36,807
They were live.

826
00:45:37,053 --> 00:45:38,725
What's it like out there?

827
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,645
It's basically a mess.

828
00:45:40,893 --> 00:45:42,929
There 's a kind of a. . . .

829
00:45:43,613 --> 00:45:46,923
The wreckage is spread over a wide area.
I don 't know how many acres.

830
00:45:47,173 --> 00:45:49,289
-Any bodies?
- Yes, there are.

831
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:51,728
What condition are they in?

832
00:45:51,973 --> 00:45:53,247
Condition?

833
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:56,608
-Condition?
- Were they mutilated?

834
00:45:57,013 --> 00:45:59,846
See, we 're still looking for survivors
and we 're hoping. . . .

835
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:01,412
Were they--?

836
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:04,611
Did they suffer any trauma?
Were they broken up in any way?

837
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:06,491
They fell out of the sky.

838
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:08,851
Were there any body parts?

839
00:46:09,093 --> 00:46:12,130
You 're asking me if I saw body parts?
You want me to report--?

840
00:46:12,373 --> 00:46:14,125
I don 't mean to be grim. . . .

841
00:46:14,373 --> 00:46:17,046
But I understand there were reports,
sharks in the area.

842
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:20,763
I didn 't see any sharks.
But don 't let the fact that the. . .

843
00:46:21,173 --> 00:46:23,846
. . . family of the victims
are probably watching the show. . .

844
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:26,163
. . .I don 't want that to stop you.

845
00:46:26,293 --> 00:46:28,249
- You 've had a tough night.
-No, I feel great.

846
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:32,168
This is the best story in the year
for me, and probably for you.

847
00:46:32,413 --> 00:46:34,688
If you can see
all the vultures out there. . .

848
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:38,687
. . . that have flocked to the seashore
to see these collective body parts.

849
00:46:38,933 --> 00:46:41,447
If you want a body part,
I'll get a gaff--

850
00:46:41,693 --> 00:46:43,172
What do you want?

851
00:46:43,413 --> 00:46:45,802
An arm or a leg?
You can have your pick.

852
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,486
That went out over the air?

853
00:46:47,733 --> 00:46:48,927
Why don 't you have a seat?

854
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,242
All of it.

855
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:54,613
It'd be interesting
to see them together again.

856
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:57,092
I thought of that.

857
00:46:57,653 --> 00:47:00,121
One here, one there.
It'd be good for 2 or 3 points.

858
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,442
At least.

859
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:07,850
I want to show you something .

860
00:47:08,093 --> 00:47:09,446
It's going to be a tough sell .

861
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:10,921
Not for me.

862
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:12,083
Good morning .

863
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:14,289
-How are you?
-Just great.

864
00:47:16,373 --> 00:47:21,003
59'%' of the American people are showing
compassion for an armed felon.

865
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:23,562
He asks for forgiveness
and everyone says, "Sure. "

866
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:25,212
This is a fascinating story.

867
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:26,408
What do we do?

868
00:47:26,653 --> 00:47:28,052
We' re covering it, Kevin.

869
00:47:28,293 --> 00:47:30,363
Brackett's interview was brilliant.

870
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:33,650
Unless you want to double-team it?
You and Brackett.

871
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:35,724
I' m not sharing my time with him .

872
00:47:35,973 --> 00:47:38,646
I' m getting on a plane
and will cover the story from there.

873
00:47:40,773 --> 00:47:41,967
It could be over by tomorrow .

874
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:44,408
No, Brackett won't let it be over.

875
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:49,005
This has the potential
to be a huge story.

876
00:47:49,253 --> 00:47:50,971
We must jump all over this.

877
00:47:51,213 --> 00:47:55,491
The guy's a poster child
for the disenfranchised . Why? How?

878
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:56,688
It's good television.

879
00:47:56,933 --> 00:47:58,924
-No other net has it.
-It's a great story.

880
00:47:59,173 --> 00:47:59,969
What about Brackett?

881
00:48:00,973 --> 00:48:02,406
I'll take care of Brackett.

882
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:27,647
Special Agent Dobbins, FBI .

883
00:48:27,893 --> 00:48:29,565
The situation is stable, sir.

884
00:48:29,813 --> 00:48:33,010
We have televisions in Washington.
We know the situation.

885
00:48:33,253 --> 00:48:35,323
Every time I scratch my ass,
it's on TV.

886
00:48:35,573 --> 00:48:38,406
I'll drive.
Have the militias arrived yet?

887
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:43,091
No. At least I don't think so.

888
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:16,809
I was across the street all night.
How'd you do this?

889
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:18,281
We' re very sneaky.

890
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:20,649
-I guess.
-This way, sir.

891
00:49:20,893 --> 00:49:23,851
What's the plan?
I' m under pressure to do something .

892
00:49:24,093 --> 00:49:27,244
We don't move
until we get public opinion on our side.

893
00:49:27,493 --> 00:49:29,324
People are beginning to like him .

894
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:30,892
Wire him, please.

895
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:32,532
That'll change.

896
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:37,483
They'll get bored or he'll do something
to make them turn on him .

897
00:49:37,733 --> 00:49:40,167
By then we'll be in a position
to take him out.

898
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:43,769
Anything I should be afraid of saying?

899
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:47,926
Get in front of the cameras and say
we' re waiting as long as it takes.

900
00:49:48,173 --> 00:49:50,767
We' re not about to play games
when kids are involved .

901
00:49:51,013 --> 00:49:52,002
Good .

902
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:15,882
I got shots!

903
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:18,007
Must be his shotgun.

904
00:50:21,733 --> 00:50:22,768
What's going on?

905
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:24,691
-What?
-Calm down.

906
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:26,446
The phone--

907
00:50:28,573 --> 00:50:30,404
What was that?
What's that about?

908
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,121
Just forget it, all right?
Don't worry about it.

909
00:50:33,373 --> 00:50:34,965
Don 't worry?
Was anyone hurt?

910
00:50:35,213 --> 00:50:38,011
Nobody's been hurt.
It was just an accident.

911
00:50:38,253 --> 00:50:40,483
The phone rang and the gun went off
and that was it.

912
00:50:40,733 --> 00:50:44,009
You can't shoot and not expect me
to not storm the place.

913
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:45,572
You don't want that.

914
00:50:45,813 --> 00:50:47,326
We had a deal, right?

915
00:50:47,573 --> 00:50:48,847
Are you taping?

916
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,446
We kept up our end of the bargain.
Now it's time to end this.

917
00:50:52,693 --> 00:50:54,843
What about my end of the bargain?

918
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,971
The demand?
Do we get to forget about all this?

919
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,647
Sam, I can't let you go.

920
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,282
You won't be allowed
to walk away from this.

921
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:05,603
The only option you have is to give up.

922
00:51:07,173 --> 00:51:10,882
I' m going to make the options now .
You better come up with something else.

923
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:13,532
Take the shells out of the gun.

924
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:15,172
The plan didn't work, newsboy.

925
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:16,448
Did you hear me?

926
00:51:17,293 --> 00:51:18,362
What are those?

927
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:21,247
In the Air Force, I did night duty
and didn't fall asleep once.

928
00:51:21,493 --> 00:51:23,927
-Can I see them?
-It's just caffeine.

929
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:25,845
You don't want to lose control .

930
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:30,245
I' m sorry about that, okay?
I didn't mean to scare you kids, okay?

931
00:51:30,493 --> 00:51:31,482
I' m not scared .

932
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:33,291
You guys sleep good?

933
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,091
-Not really.
-Sort of.

934
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,563
I guess.
Now I' m kind of hungry.

935
00:51:37,813 --> 00:51:38,962
You' re hungry?

936
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:42,406
Sam, you got to let them go now .

937
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:43,722
Follow me!

938
00:51:44,973 --> 00:51:46,088
Where' re you going?

939
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:47,607
Let's go, quickly.

940
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,803
Look at all the animals.

941
00:51:57,053 --> 00:51:58,930
Now what's the magic word?

942
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:01,451
Open Sesame?

943
00:52:01,693 --> 00:52:02,569
Good guess.

944
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:08,529
What do you want?

945
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:11,333
-Nice, huh?
-Whose side are you on, Mr. Brackett?

946
00:52:11,573 --> 00:52:12,722
The good guys' .

947
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:15,132
Doesn't look that way.

948
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:16,726
Sam needs all the help he can get.

949
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:18,884
Oh, you' re so concerned about Sam?

950
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:21,806
Yes. You' re looking at the difference
between 1 and 1 0 years in prison.

951
00:52:22,053 --> 00:52:25,011
Is that because this insanity
benefits your career?

952
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:27,323
I hope so.
It benefits yours as well .

953
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,209
What?

954
00:52:29,453 --> 00:52:32,331
You' re running the most famous
little museum in the country.

955
00:52:32,573 --> 00:52:36,327
You'll have dodos
and dinosaur bones up the wazoo.

956
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:40,808
You can have a lot.
You can have two.

957
00:52:41,053 --> 00:52:43,408
T-shirts, right here.

958
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:48,606
Sam's T-shirts!

959
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:53,449
We' re providing Americans what they
were denied at Ruby Ridge and Waco:

960
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:57,447
Witnesses to the actions of the
so-called law enforcement establishment.

961
00:52:57,693 --> 00:53:01,322
But you agree with the calling for
the peaceful surrender of Sam Baily?

962
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,086
Is that a trick question?

963
00:53:04,333 --> 00:53:08,246
Of course we don 't approve
of his putting children in harm 's way.

964
00:53:08,493 --> 00:53:10,085
-They' re here.
-I know that .

965
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:11,732
Keep an eye on them .

966
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:15,372
A family man
put out of work by racial quotas.

967
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,331
What do you plan on doing?

968
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:18,922
What's he trying to say?

969
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:22,809
They fired you. They kept Cliff.
You shot Cliff. He's black.

970
00:53:23,053 --> 00:53:24,964
Some people might say
you' re prejudiced .

971
00:53:26,693 --> 00:53:28,172
I must get on TV and say I ain't.

972
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,973
No way they'll let you
do another interview .

973
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,882
I'll give them 1 kid .
I'll give them 5 kids.

974
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,322
Bad idea.

975
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:40,169
We just did an interview . We built what
is probably a positive image of you.

976
00:53:40,413 --> 00:53:41,971
Understand, the public's fickle.

977
00:53:42,213 --> 00:53:46,525
They' re on a very short leash of
sympathy. We have a narrow opportunity.

978
00:53:46,773 --> 00:53:50,686
Think of when you'll give up,
when you'll let the children go.

979
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:53,447
I can't have people saying bad things
about me on TV.

980
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:57,208
You want to go on and debate neo-Nazis?
Destroy everything?

981
00:53:57,453 --> 00:54:01,651
People got to start saying good things
about me! My friends, my wife.

982
00:54:01,893 --> 00:54:04,726
Okay, let's call her.
It's a good idea. Come on.

983
00:54:05,013 --> 00:54:06,685
I can't talk to my wife.

984
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,651
Why not?
She's probably worried .

985
00:54:08,893 --> 00:54:10,963
Oh, man!
She'll just yell .

986
00:54:11,213 --> 00:54:12,566
You should talk to her.

987
00:54:12,813 --> 00:54:16,010
You should talk to her
because you said you would before.

988
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,926
You go get her and tell her
to say good things about me on TV.

989
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,084
-When?
-And my friends too! Now !

990
00:54:23,613 --> 00:54:25,683
Someone's coming out!

991
00:54:26,613 --> 00:54:27,762
Chief.

992
00:54:28,013 --> 00:54:29,287
Brackett's out.

993
00:54:30,973 --> 00:54:32,645
How are the kids?

994
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,411
What's the condition of the kids?!

995
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:37,008
Are any more children
going to be released?!

996
00:54:37,293 --> 00:54:38,362
Anybody injured?!

997
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:41,133
-Over here!
-Whose side are you on?!

998
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,252
-You better tell me he's coming out.
-He wants another story.

999
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:48,291
-What? Absolutely not.
-He'll give you 5 more kids.

1000
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:52,128
He wants me to talk to his wife,
interview her and a few others.

1001
00:54:52,373 --> 00:54:54,204
You' re saying no to releasing 5 kids.

1002
00:54:54,453 --> 00:54:55,932
No, I want all the kids out here.

1003
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:57,925
How about 5 kids and a teddy bear?

1004
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:02,405
Don't get cute with me, Brackett.
I want him out here and arrested .

1005
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:04,564
He's not ready to give up.
Prison terrifies him .

1006
00:55:04,813 --> 00:55:07,088
TV keeps him calm .
I'll interview his wife. . .

1007
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,211
. . . with you standing there.
Pull the plug anytime you want.

1008
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:11,806
You 're walking in and out.

1009
00:55:12,053 --> 00:55:13,884
You' re supposed to be a hostage.

1010
00:55:14,133 --> 00:55:15,646
Let him do it.

1011
00:55:17,493 --> 00:55:20,849
You can do it, but you
and Baily better not be playing games.

1012
00:55:21,853 --> 00:55:23,172
Son of a gun.

1013
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:25,005
Who's the FBI guy?

1014
00:55:25,373 --> 00:55:26,806
Maybe I know him .

1015
00:55:28,093 --> 00:55:31,972
Do you know Sam Baily's making you
the most famous cop. . .

1016
00:55:32,213 --> 00:55:34,090
. . .in the United States of America?

1017
00:55:36,613 --> 00:55:38,729
On TV, with those sunglasses. . .

1018
00:55:38,973 --> 00:55:40,042
. . .you' re so sexy.

1019
00:55:46,973 --> 00:55:50,488
Mr. Williams is still unconscious
here in room 404.

1020
00:55:51,773 --> 00:55:54,446
Doctors are cautious
about the possibility of infection. . .

1021
00:55:54,693 --> 00:55:57,287
. . .caused by the bullet
still lodged in his abdomen.

1022
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,169
What about Cliff Williams?
He cannot know that his attacker. . .

1023
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:03,404
. . . became something of a folk hero. . .

1024
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:07,851
. . . his words tapping into a nationwide
movement of discontent among the public.

1025
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:09,765
What about Cliff Williams?

1026
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:12,243
But what about Cliff
What about Cliff

1027
00:56:14,853 --> 00:56:17,208
Cliff was the one
with the shattered dream

1028
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,090
Sam tries real hard .

1029
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:24,405
And sometimes he screws things up
because he's. . . .

1030
00:56:26,013 --> 00:56:28,891
It's okay. Tell me,
what kind of a husband is Sam?

1031
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:30,930
He's a good husband .

1032
00:56:31,773 --> 00:56:33,286
He's a good husband . . .

1033
00:56:34,253 --> 00:56:37,006
. . .as long as you--
You have to help to keep him . . .

1034
00:56:37,653 --> 00:56:38,881
. . . pointed in the right direction.

1035
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:41,408
And, you know .
But I don't understand that.

1036
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:43,609
That's not like him .

1037
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:47,129
Tell me, Jenny, did you
make him lunches the last few days?

1038
00:56:47,373 --> 00:56:48,249
He makes his own.

1039
00:56:48,493 --> 00:56:52,725
So he's already been fired and yet
he kept making himself lunches. . .

1040
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:57,012
. . . kept putting on his uniform
and kept pretending to go to work.

1041
00:56:57,253 --> 00:56:58,766
How do you feel about that?

1042
00:57:00,173 --> 00:57:01,288
About what?

1043
00:57:01,533 --> 00:57:04,172
That he was afraid
to tell you that he was fired?

1044
00:57:05,493 --> 00:57:06,767
Do you scare him?

1045
00:57:07,573 --> 00:57:10,087
I think that he didn't want to worry me.

1046
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:14,128
Because he was scared?
Think that's a sign of a good marriage?

1047
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:18,924
We had a good marriage.
We have a good marriage.

1048
00:57:20,493 --> 00:57:22,370
Did he tell you we didn't?

1049
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:26,606
I' m sure you have a good marriage. But
it seems at times you treat him . . .

1050
00:57:26,853 --> 00:57:27,763
. . .Iike a child .

1051
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,049
He is like a child sometimes.

1052
00:57:31,293 --> 00:57:34,763
And he likes calling himself
my third child .

1053
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:36,489
It's a bad question.

1054
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:38,405
I' m sorry, I didn't mean to--

1055
00:57:39,413 --> 00:57:41,005
Do you still love him?

1056
00:57:41,493 --> 00:57:43,404
Yes, I love my husband .

1057
00:57:43,653 --> 00:57:45,689
I love my husband very much!

1058
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,366
He's the most gentle. . . .

1059
00:57:47,613 --> 00:57:50,969
He's the kindest man I've ever known!
The parents of the children. . . .

1060
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:53,681
Grab her.
We'll put her on the line with Sam .

1061
00:57:54,453 --> 00:57:56,569
Jenny, we want you to talk to him .

1062
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:59,248
You have to be very careful about that.

1063
00:57:59,573 --> 00:58:01,643
He's stressed .
There's no telling how he'll react.

1064
00:58:01,893 --> 00:58:03,565
This doesn't concern you.

1065
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,451
He's very sensitive
about his wife.

1066
00:58:05,693 --> 00:58:06,603
Come with me.

1067
00:58:06,853 --> 00:58:08,127
Please don't do this now .

1068
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:09,806
You asked the right question.

1069
00:58:14,613 --> 00:58:16,808
I just got that sick taste in my mouth.

1070
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:18,930
So much for bubble gum .

1071
00:58:19,173 --> 00:58:21,164
That's too gross for me.

1072
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:34,291
I' m Max's assistant.
I need to get through now .

1073
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:39,924
What are you doing, Sam?

1074
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:43,644
I guess I got myself in a jam, huh?

1075
00:58:43,893 --> 00:58:46,453
You've got to come out right now .

1076
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:48,452
How' re the sprouts?

1077
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:51,685
They're wondering where their father is,
that's how they are.

1078
00:58:53,173 --> 00:58:55,209
They want to put me in prison.

1079
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,644
I don't want any more argument.

1080
00:59:00,973 --> 00:59:03,203
I want you to come out now.

1081
00:59:05,493 --> 00:59:07,245
Is that you on TV?

1082
00:59:07,613 --> 00:59:08,728
What?

1083
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:10,805
Put away the gun and come out!

1084
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:12,486
Get away from her!

1085
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:14,361
Put Brackett on the phone!

1086
00:59:14,773 --> 00:59:16,331
Forget about Brackett!

1087
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,045
Put the gun down. . . .

1088
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:22,531
You tell them right now
I ain't going to prison!

1089
00:59:22,773 --> 00:59:24,729
-Put the gun down!
-Go home!

1090
00:59:24,973 --> 00:59:26,406
Go home, Jenny!

1091
00:59:28,853 --> 00:59:31,287
Jeez, I'm going to get him out myself.

1092
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,285
I' m going to get him out myself!

1093
00:59:33,853 --> 00:59:35,332
Give me the horn.

1094
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:38,610
Speak into here.
Hold the button down. Talk into here.

1095
00:59:38,853 --> 00:59:41,367
Listen, I'd think twice about this.

1096
00:59:42,653 --> 00:59:44,166
Please don't do this.

1097
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:48,252
Listen to me!

1098
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:51,132
You 've got to stop this nonsense.

1099
00:59:51,573 --> 00:59:53,291
- Think about our kids.
-Shut up!

1100
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:55,524
They're waiting for you.

1101
00:59:55,773 --> 00:59:57,286
Please, come out.

1102
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:59,763
Please, listen to me.

1103
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:04,529
-Sam, please come out now.
-Shut up!

1104
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:06,843
Do you hear me, Sam?

1105
01:00:07,093 --> 01:00:08,128
Please. . .

1106
01:00:08,373 --> 01:00:09,726
. . . come out now.

1107
01:00:14,293 --> 01:00:15,328
That is enough!

1108
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:16,529
Stop it!

1109
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:19,489
-Sam, stop!
-Hold your fire!

1110
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:23,885
Sam, please,
that's enough now ! No!

1111
01:00:26,453 --> 01:00:28,205
-Stop it!
-This is on your head !

1112
01:00:33,293 --> 01:00:34,282
Get away!

1113
01:00:37,813 --> 01:00:39,883
Get away from the window !
They'll kill you!

1114
01:00:48,693 --> 01:00:50,092
-The lock.
-It's open!

1115
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:52,570
Why'd you let her
say those things on TV?

1116
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:54,804
You stand at the door,
they'll kill you.

1117
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:59,042
-What is the problem?
-Why'd you let her say those things?

1118
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:02,888
I didn't and that's not a good reason
to shoot over people's heads!

1119
01:01:03,133 --> 01:01:04,691
You said you'd talk to her alone.

1120
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:06,810
It was the police chief's idea.

1121
01:01:10,093 --> 01:01:14,803
People were beginning to like you, then
you start shooting out the window . . .

1122
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:16,964
. . .and your image is down the drain.

1123
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:22,724
I just got crazy when I seen her on TV,
okay? All the people around her. . . .

1124
01:01:22,973 --> 01:01:24,406
What have I done?

1125
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:31,164
Tell me you won't throw dynamite
out the window .

1126
01:01:32,093 --> 01:01:33,890
You know
I' m not going to do that.

1127
01:01:36,773 --> 01:01:38,047
I screwed up.

1128
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:40,168
I screwed up.

1129
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:42,324
I' m going to go outside. . .

1130
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,883
. . . I' m going to do damage control
and you'll be okay.

1131
01:01:49,093 --> 01:01:52,722
I'll send you to do interviews.
I'll give you the names. . .

1132
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:54,372
. . .and the questions to ask.

1133
01:01:54,613 --> 01:01:55,807
Why can't you do it?

1134
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:59,290
Because I need to be near Sam .
He's getting edgy.

1135
01:02:00,453 --> 01:02:03,445
And tell Lou to send over
the editing bay.

1136
01:02:03,813 --> 01:02:05,724
-I completely forgot.
-What's that?

1137
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:07,725
The editing bay is here.

1138
01:02:08,093 --> 01:02:10,288
Kevin Hollander is coming here.

1139
01:02:11,933 --> 01:02:12,683
What?

1140
01:02:13,173 --> 01:02:15,767
I think the editing bay is here for him .

1141
01:02:20,733 --> 01:02:23,566
-He's going to try to freeze us out.
-Why?

1142
01:02:23,813 --> 01:02:26,247
Because he'd love to steal
a story from us.

1143
01:02:26,893 --> 01:02:27,928
Kevin Hollander?

1144
01:02:28,053 --> 01:02:29,122
You like him .

1145
01:02:30,253 --> 01:02:33,051
It's our story.
He wouldn't do that.

1146
01:02:33,453 --> 01:02:34,966
Go to work.

1147
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:37,327
-Thank you.
-Listen, Laurie.

1148
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:40,087
This is our story
and it's nobody else's.

1149
01:02:40,333 --> 01:02:43,723
I' m depending on you.
It's too early to celebrate. Go on.

1150
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:46,282
Don't touch me.
I'll get arrested .

1151
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,452
Would you say Sam Baily
is a religious man?

1152
01:02:53,693 --> 01:02:55,570
Yes. Sam is religious.

1153
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:59,089
But when I say that
you should understand I mean proud . . .

1154
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:00,926
. . .and he's kind .

1155
01:03:01,173 --> 01:03:03,164
Do you think Sam is a fun guy?

1156
01:03:04,493 --> 01:03:07,371
Fun?
Yeah, he's a real fun guy.

1157
01:03:07,613 --> 01:03:08,966
In what way?

1158
01:03:10,093 --> 01:03:11,082
Gullible.

1159
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:13,569
You could always play jokes on him .

1160
01:03:18,413 --> 01:03:20,483
Is Sam Baily a violent man?

1161
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:25,527
You see any fishermen throwing fits?
No.

1162
01:03:25,773 --> 01:03:27,172
He 's not a violent man.

1163
01:03:28,573 --> 01:03:30,484
He was not a remarkable student.

1164
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:34,405
I'm sure you 'll find people
who 'll say we failed Sam Baily.

1165
01:03:34,653 --> 01:03:38,362
The system isn 't set up to provide
a safety net for men like him.

1166
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:42,242
But the only person accountable
for this situation is Sam Baily.

1167
01:03:42,493 --> 01:03:44,290
A compassionate bastard .

1168
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:49,210
We failed Sam Baily.

1169
01:03:51,813 --> 01:03:55,044
The system isn 't set up to provide
a safety net for men like him.

1170
01:03:55,293 --> 01:03:56,885
That's what I thought you said .

1171
01:04:05,453 --> 01:04:06,932
The parents won't speak to me.

1172
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:10,085
I'm keeping a hole open for this.
They must speak to you.

1173
01:04:10,453 --> 01:04:13,684
The mother's crying and the father has
a stutter. They won't talk on camera.

1174
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,049
You don 't get this,
don 't come back.

1175
01:04:16,293 --> 01:04:18,409
-Is that clear?
- Yes.

1176
01:04:19,253 --> 01:04:20,208
Good .

1177
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:24,171
Mrs. Baily,
I' m really sorry to bother you. . .

1178
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:26,768
. . . but I really am trying
to help your son.

1179
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:30,371
I was wondering if he has a horse. . .

1180
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:31,887
. . .or a dog .

1181
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,686
I want to use it in the story.

1182
01:04:34,933 --> 01:04:39,165
I want to show the people that Sam can't
be that bad if he has a dog he loves.

1183
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:42,812
Go, follow .

1184
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:49,968
We've had him since Sam
got back from the Air Force.

1185
01:04:51,373 --> 01:04:54,809
Old Rex.
He's almost fifteen years old now .

1186
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:58,241
We nearly lost him last year.

1187
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:00,892
Sam was a wreck.

1188
01:05:01,133 --> 01:05:02,646
He stayed up with him all night. . .

1189
01:05:02,893 --> 01:05:04,724
. . . made sure he kept warm .

1190
01:05:04,973 --> 01:05:07,203
He's really a sweet boy.

1191
01:05:07,893 --> 01:05:09,690
He's confused but. . .

1192
01:05:10,813 --> 01:05:13,281
. . .all he's trying to do is get by.

1193
01:05:13,533 --> 01:05:14,409
Sam was a wreck.

1194
01:05:14,653 --> 01:05:17,292
That's the most important interview
of the whole case.

1195
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,724
See that?
That's on the money.

1196
01:05:19,973 --> 01:05:21,042
You know what you did?

1197
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:23,887
You got that sweet old woman
saying how Sam loves. . .

1198
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:27,125
. . .that pathetic, mangy,
tick-ridden dog .

1199
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:33,209
Who's here?

1200
01:05:33,453 --> 01:05:35,603
-Who's coming?
-I have no idea.

1201
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:45,803
Max is over there.

1202
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:52,691
See if we can get them
something to drink.

1203
01:05:52,933 --> 01:05:54,412
I'll get it.

1204
01:05:54,853 --> 01:05:57,572
I see a great underlying theme here.

1205
01:05:57,813 --> 01:06:01,522
Baily is tapping into something
the working class can relate to.

1206
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:04,209
What's wrong?
Your numbers taking a dip?

1207
01:06:07,573 --> 01:06:10,246
Have a seat, Max.
Look, sit down.

1208
01:06:12,533 --> 01:06:13,932
Let's cut the crap.

1209
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:17,366
You and I have had our problems
in the past.

1210
01:06:18,013 --> 01:06:19,685
But you want back on the network.

1211
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:21,809
Yes, Kevin.

1212
01:06:22,053 --> 01:06:25,329
You' re talking to it.
If you can be a team player. . .

1213
01:06:25,573 --> 01:06:27,131
. . .this is your ticket back in.

1214
01:06:28,853 --> 01:06:29,922
When can I meet him?

1215
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:33,047
The network wants him
to do a one-on-one with me.

1216
01:06:33,293 --> 01:06:36,729
He can't do a one-on-one. He's
in the middle of committing a crime.

1217
01:06:38,133 --> 01:06:41,728
-You've done okay.
-I spent the day and a night with him .

1218
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:45,964
I think he'll talk to me.
I' m "the man America trusts for news. "

1219
01:06:46,213 --> 01:06:48,807
You really shouldn't let
a marketing slogan go to your head .

1220
01:06:49,053 --> 01:06:51,408
-Can I get some coffee?
-It'll be ready in 5 minutes.

1221
01:06:51,653 --> 01:06:55,282
Maybe you could both speak to him,
make it more comfortable for him .

1222
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:58,530
You' re the one
who saved the guard .

1223
01:06:59,253 --> 01:07:01,721
No. Yes.
I mean, I helped .

1224
01:07:01,973 --> 01:07:04,282
I understand you' re doing
a new piece on Baily.

1225
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,603
Yes, but it's Max's story.

1226
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:08,605
-Thanks.
-I want to see it.

1227
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:11,405
I mean, I want to see it now .

1228
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:15,248
Sam Baily stands firm to his appeal
for clemency but the law says no.

1229
01:07:15,493 --> 01:07:19,122
So the waiting continues.
This is Max Brackett reporting.

1230
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:21,961
That's a testimonial .

1231
01:07:22,213 --> 01:07:24,647
We don't judge people
before they go to trial .

1232
01:07:24,893 --> 01:07:28,408
We don't make them celebrities either.
He's committing a felony.

1233
01:07:29,373 --> 01:07:33,002
No, we' re just packaging what
people who knew Baily said about him .

1234
01:07:33,693 --> 01:07:35,888
I'll take care of the felonies
in the lead-in.

1235
01:07:37,093 --> 01:07:38,048
I own this story.

1236
01:07:38,293 --> 01:07:41,842
This story is the property of KXBD.
It's the network's.

1237
01:07:46,053 --> 01:07:49,966
I need to make some changes in this.
I want to see everything you shot.

1238
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:54,844
When am I going to have
my meeting with Baily?

1239
01:07:55,093 --> 01:07:56,412
I need to prepare my one-on-one.

1240
01:07:56,653 --> 01:07:59,087
What?
Yeah. Yeah, I know .

1241
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,642
I can't even guarantee he'll do it.

1242
01:08:01,893 --> 01:08:03,246
He'll jump at it.

1243
01:08:03,493 --> 01:08:04,721
They all do.

1244
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,488
Fine.

1245
01:08:08,173 --> 01:08:10,164
-Excuse me.
-One second .

1246
01:08:11,293 --> 01:08:13,887
Why don't you play nice?
This could be very good for you.

1247
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:15,692
Excuse me, Max.

1248
01:08:15,933 --> 01:08:17,366
-Coach Bob is arriving .
-What?

1249
01:08:17,613 --> 01:08:19,410
Coach Bob,
with the food for the kids.

1250
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:22,851
I'll keep it in mind .

1251
01:08:32,253 --> 01:08:34,084
-What about the kids?
-The kids are okay.

1252
01:08:34,333 --> 01:08:37,530
I' m worried about Hollander.
Why don't you get him off my back?

1253
01:08:37,773 --> 01:08:41,368
I can't.
I can't wrestle 300-pound gorillas!

1254
01:08:41,853 --> 01:08:43,445
You guys got the pizza?

1255
01:08:45,093 --> 01:08:46,242
That's it?

1256
01:08:48,173 --> 01:08:50,084
We' re dying here!

1257
01:08:52,013 --> 01:08:54,004
You can't keep this all to yourself!

1258
01:08:55,493 --> 01:08:57,006
Go to hell, Max!

1259
01:08:57,253 --> 01:08:59,164
-You' re an asshole!
-What's going on?

1260
01:09:18,173 --> 01:09:21,290
Get them
to take those skins off, please.

1261
01:09:21,533 --> 01:09:24,923
I need you to come back down here
and take the skins off.

1262
01:09:25,933 --> 01:09:30,165
These kids get bored just visiting
a museum . Imagine being trapped in one.

1263
01:09:32,653 --> 01:09:34,325
Have a hamburger.

1264
01:09:35,453 --> 01:09:38,331
You guys knock it off!
Get down here! I got to talk to you!

1265
01:09:41,693 --> 01:09:43,126
That was awesome.

1266
01:09:43,373 --> 01:09:45,170
Everybody, come here!

1267
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:46,402
Come here!

1268
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:47,881
Everybody, quick!

1269
01:09:51,573 --> 01:09:54,531
I can 't see very well.
The rain 's heavy.

1270
01:09:55,453 --> 01:09:56,772
Where are we going?

1271
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:58,969
Hey, Mr. Indian Man.

1272
01:10:00,253 --> 01:10:01,322
What's that?

1273
01:10:01,693 --> 01:10:03,285
You want me to tell them?

1274
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:05,492
I'll tell them the story.

1275
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:08,850
Get over there. He wants me
to tell you a story. Go ahead .

1276
01:10:09,093 --> 01:10:10,651
Sit down over there.

1277
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:16,411
Now you kids,
you know the name of this lndian?

1278
01:10:17,053 --> 01:10:19,009
This guy's name is Big John. . .

1279
01:10:19,253 --> 01:10:21,608
. . .and he's a friend of mine.

1280
01:10:24,893 --> 01:10:27,612
Do you know what kind of lndian he is?

1281
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,531
A Miwok lndian.

1282
01:10:36,093 --> 01:10:37,446
Do you know how to say " Miwok" ?

1283
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:39,648
That's good .

1284
01:10:39,893 --> 01:10:42,202
The lndians used to own this country.

1285
01:10:42,453 --> 01:10:45,047
They owned it.
This was their home.

1286
01:10:46,493 --> 01:10:49,485
I think I found
one of their arrowheads once.

1287
01:10:49,733 --> 01:10:50,722
You did?

1288
01:10:50,973 --> 01:10:53,441
Hold on to it. If Big John finds out,
he'll come and get it.

1289
01:10:55,773 --> 01:10:56,683
The Miwok lndians. . .

1290
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:58,924
. . .they lived off the land .

1291
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:02,290
They had, like, you know . . . .
They had their own crops.

1292
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:05,252
They hunted and built tepees
out of wood like this.

1293
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:08,724
And, you know,
they had kids just like you.

1294
01:11:09,053 --> 01:11:11,248
Big John was the chief of them .

1295
01:11:11,493 --> 01:11:13,051
Do you know what a chief is?

1296
01:11:13,893 --> 01:11:15,087
The chief is the boss.

1297
01:11:15,333 --> 01:11:17,005
Right.
The chief is the boss.

1298
01:11:17,253 --> 01:11:19,005
The chief is a good boss.

1299
01:11:19,413 --> 01:11:22,166
And a good boss knows
how to take care of his people!

1300
01:11:33,413 --> 01:11:35,210
He's too close to the kids.

1301
01:11:35,453 --> 01:11:37,171
The white man came along . . .

1302
01:11:37,413 --> 01:11:40,610
. . .and he wanted to take the land
away from the lndians.

1303
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:43,322
And so he killed
all of Big John's people.

1304
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,283
He killed his friends.

1305
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:49,483
He killed his family.

1306
01:11:52,733 --> 01:11:54,530
He's got his rifle drawn on the kids.

1307
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:58,686
That made Big John so sad, he stood
at the top of the valley, like this:

1308
01:11:58,933 --> 01:12:02,687
He looked down and saw everybody.
Everyone he loved was killed .

1309
01:12:02,933 --> 01:12:05,493
And he just started
to do an lndian dance. . .

1310
01:12:07,733 --> 01:12:09,325
. . .to bring them back to life.

1311
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:14,771
But it didn't work.

1312
01:12:16,053 --> 01:12:19,090
And he was so sad his heart froze.

1313
01:12:20,053 --> 01:12:21,281
Is he still alive?

1314
01:12:21,533 --> 01:12:22,807
You bet he is.

1315
01:12:24,053 --> 01:12:25,327
Museum found him . . .

1316
01:12:25,573 --> 01:12:27,882
. . . he was like this.

1317
01:12:31,853 --> 01:12:35,766
And then when I started to work here
his hand was up here like this.

1318
01:12:36,253 --> 01:12:39,563
And every day I noticed it went
like this, came down like this.

1319
01:12:41,173 --> 01:12:44,290
Then I realized he was just
waving goodbye.

1320
01:12:49,173 --> 01:12:50,731
Let's go! Come on!

1321
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,727
Pick him up!
Pick him up! Run!

1322
01:12:56,053 --> 01:12:57,805
Behind the buffalo!

1323
01:13:00,213 --> 01:13:02,010
I hope we get to see some more!

1324
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,891
That was cool !

1325
01:13:04,853 --> 01:13:06,605
Chief, it's for you!

1326
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:11,570
What the heck are you doing?
We got kids in here!

1327
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:14,281
Sam, it wasn't us.
No, it wasn't us.

1328
01:13:15,253 --> 01:13:17,721
Some nutcase made it
through the perimeter.

1329
01:13:18,413 --> 01:13:19,926
He says it wasn't him .

1330
01:13:20,573 --> 01:13:21,562
Listen.

1331
01:13:21,813 --> 01:13:24,168
If this happens again,
I' m calling a parents' conference. . .

1332
01:13:24,413 --> 01:13:26,927
. . .and tell them you' re taking potshots
at their kids.

1333
01:13:27,173 --> 01:13:31,769
And I suggest that you tell
the FBI agent you' re standing with. . .

1334
01:13:32,013 --> 01:13:33,366
. . .that I said so.

1335
01:13:33,613 --> 01:13:36,173
One moment, please.
Anything else, Sam?

1336
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:38,168
Thank you.

1337
01:13:40,053 --> 01:13:41,168
Shit!

1338
01:13:42,773 --> 01:13:44,570
Dobbins, you' re a jackoff.

1339
01:13:48,373 --> 01:13:50,762
Joke just gets funnier and funnier,
doesn 't it?

1340
01:13:52,173 --> 01:13:55,051
And up there in Madeline
we 've got this guy, Sam Baily. . .

1341
01:13:55,293 --> 01:13:56,772
. . . using the Steve Martin defense.

1342
01:13:57,013 --> 01:13:58,207
Leno just said my name.

1343
01:13:58,453 --> 01:13:59,966
Hasn 't been used in a few years.

1344
01:14:00,213 --> 01:14:02,044
Well, excuse me!

1345
01:14:02,573 --> 01:14:03,449
Please.

1346
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:08,486
Jay Leno knows who I am .

1347
01:14:10,013 --> 01:14:11,412
Oh, man!

1348
01:14:13,173 --> 01:14:14,652
He's a nice man.

1349
01:14:14,973 --> 01:14:15,803
You met him?

1350
01:14:16,053 --> 01:14:18,806
I did a story on antique cars.
He collects them .

1351
01:14:19,653 --> 01:14:21,325
Who else you met?

1352
01:14:22,653 --> 01:14:25,372
Everyone from the Pope to Mel Gibson.

1353
01:14:25,613 --> 01:14:26,568
Mel Gibson?

1354
01:14:26,813 --> 01:14:27,928
What's he like?

1355
01:14:28,853 --> 01:14:33,529
I threw him softball questions.
He threw me softball answers.

1356
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:35,252
He plays softball?

1357
01:14:36,573 --> 01:14:39,167
I play softball .
I'd get along good with him .

1358
01:14:41,693 --> 01:14:46,050
I bet your wife didn't know
she was getting a celebrity. . .

1359
01:14:46,573 --> 01:14:48,564
. . .when she said yes, did she?

1360
01:14:49,053 --> 01:14:51,886
No, I think she knew
exactly what she was getting .

1361
01:14:52,133 --> 01:14:54,283
35 years old and . . .

1362
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:58,323
. . .the only job I could get
is guarding a museum at $8 an hour.

1363
01:14:58,573 --> 01:15:01,849
-How long you been doing it?
-And I can't even keep that.

1364
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:03,407
5 years.

1365
01:15:05,093 --> 01:15:07,732
I was in the Air Force,
you know, but I left. . .

1366
01:15:08,453 --> 01:15:10,489
. . . because they wouldn't let me fly.

1367
01:15:10,733 --> 01:15:11,768
Why not?

1368
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:13,241
No college.

1369
01:15:13,853 --> 01:15:15,525
Why didn't you go to college?

1370
01:15:15,773 --> 01:15:17,206
No money.

1371
01:15:18,373 --> 01:15:19,328
But. . . .

1372
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:24,206
The results ain't in yet,
but it appears that I ain't too bright.

1373
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,330
Guess what.
I didn't go either.

1374
01:15:26,573 --> 01:15:28,131
Get out.

1375
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,052
I couldn't afford it.

1376
01:15:33,493 --> 01:15:35,802
Then how'd you get to be so smart?

1377
01:15:36,373 --> 01:15:37,965
The results aren't in yet. . .

1378
01:15:38,213 --> 01:15:41,011
. . . but rumor has it
I got by on my charm .

1379
01:15:41,893 --> 01:15:44,566
That's something
that you got a lot of:

1380
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:45,888
Charm .

1381
01:15:46,133 --> 01:15:47,202
Charm .

1382
01:15:47,613 --> 01:15:49,444
Charm . Personality.

1383
01:15:49,693 --> 01:15:51,046
I ain't got no personality.

1384
01:15:51,293 --> 01:15:54,126
Sure you do, otherwise people
wouldn't be responding to you.

1385
01:15:55,493 --> 01:15:57,723
Then I could do
one of those TV shows?

1386
01:15:58,453 --> 01:16:00,842
Why not?
You' re already famous.

1387
01:16:01,413 --> 01:16:02,641
Yeah, but. . .

1388
01:16:03,013 --> 01:16:04,844
. . . I' m famous in a bad way.

1389
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,130
It doesn't make any difference on TV.
People know who you are.

1390
01:16:08,733 --> 01:16:10,052
Like them fishing shows.

1391
01:16:10,293 --> 01:16:12,648
I heard that you were a great fisherman.

1392
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:14,645
I'd like to do a fishing show .

1393
01:16:16,093 --> 01:16:18,926
Fish all day on TV and you get to go. . .

1394
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:20,607
. . .see the best spots.

1395
01:16:20,853 --> 01:16:22,366
All the new equipment.

1396
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:24,447
I'd like that.

1397
01:16:24,693 --> 01:16:28,891
I'll tell you what. When this is over,
I'll recommend you to my station.

1398
01:16:30,173 --> 01:16:32,323
Nah. It's over for me.

1399
01:16:32,573 --> 01:16:36,009
Things are bad, but at least people
are sympathizing with you now .

1400
01:16:37,013 --> 01:16:38,412
Am I going to jail?

1401
01:16:38,653 --> 01:16:39,529
Best-case scenario. . .

1402
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:41,965
. . .you'll do a little time. . .

1403
01:16:42,213 --> 01:16:44,090
. . .you'll get some probation.
Then. . . .

1404
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,449
. . . "Sam Baily's Catfish Corner. "

1405
01:16:47,093 --> 01:16:48,367
Yeah, right.

1406
01:16:50,773 --> 01:16:52,365
Stranger things have happened .

1407
01:16:52,613 --> 01:16:54,569
I was up and I was down.

1408
01:16:54,813 --> 01:16:57,088
Now I' m up again,
thanks to you.

1409
01:16:57,493 --> 01:17:02,169
Who knows? You might be back in your
wife's arms sooner than you think.

1410
01:17:02,653 --> 01:17:04,848
They got too much light, them kids.

1411
01:17:07,093 --> 01:17:09,402
Back in my loving woman's arms again.

1412
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:18,044
-You married?
-Been there.

1413
01:17:18,293 --> 01:17:19,612
You got kids?

1414
01:17:19,853 --> 01:17:20,842
1 out of 3.

1415
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:22,242
What's that mean?

1416
01:17:22,493 --> 01:17:25,690
One kid, three wives.
My last wife didn't even wait. . .

1417
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:28,493
. . .for me to leave.
She took off with the kid .

1418
01:17:28,733 --> 01:17:31,042
I couldn't leave my family.

1419
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:34,524
You'd be surprised
what you can learn to live with.

1420
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:37,445
You don't want to take those.

1421
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:40,571
Sam, why don't you
get yourself some sleep?

1422
01:17:41,973 --> 01:17:43,964
Nothing's going to happen, I promise.

1423
01:18:02,653 --> 01:18:04,325
Can I go to the candy room?

1424
01:18:04,573 --> 01:18:05,642
We' re hungry.

1425
01:18:05,893 --> 01:18:07,292
Yeah. Go, go.

1426
01:18:09,773 --> 01:18:12,685
Well, Max,
they are suggesting that. . .

1427
01:18:12,933 --> 01:18:16,448
. . .if you have any control
over the situation. . .

1428
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:20,608
. . .it wouldn't be a bad idea
if Baily surrendered in the evening .

1429
01:18:20,853 --> 01:18:21,683
Prime time?

1430
01:18:21,933 --> 01:18:24,367
Their Thursdays are particularly weak.

1431
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,812
Oh, Jesus, Marty!

1432
01:18:27,053 --> 01:18:29,487
I know, Max. I know .

1433
01:18:30,733 --> 01:18:33,088
So let's forget about this.
They're asking--

1434
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:36,643
Tell them this is my story
and Hollander is trying to steal it.

1435
01:18:36,893 --> 01:18:38,451
They know that.

1436
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:40,764
They' re asking you
to let him have Baily.

1437
01:18:41,013 --> 01:18:43,925
In exchange,
they' re offering you your own show .

1438
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:46,482
Magazine, 60 Minutes format. . .

1439
01:18:46,733 --> 01:18:48,883
. . .investigative, in-your-face. . . .

1440
01:18:49,133 --> 01:18:51,169
They say,
and it remains to be seen. . .

1441
01:18:51,413 --> 01:18:53,973
. . .you will have editorial freedom,
whatever that means.

1442
01:18:54,213 --> 01:18:57,683
But it will be national and they
are talking about real money.

1443
01:18:58,933 --> 01:19:00,571
Do I lock the deal down?

1444
01:19:00,813 --> 01:19:03,373
--but I know what it's like to be angry.

1445
01:19:03,613 --> 01:19:05,808
I understand what it's like
to not have a future.

1446
01:19:06,053 --> 01:19:08,487
T-shirts, right here!
Get your Sam T-shirts!

1447
01:19:08,733 --> 01:19:10,451
One size fits all !

1448
01:19:26,853 --> 01:19:28,286
What a circus!

1449
01:19:30,013 --> 01:19:33,449
They tried to cut a deal in the Foothill
Federal fraud last night.

1450
01:19:33,693 --> 01:19:36,287
With this nonsense, they didn't think
anybody'd notice.

1451
01:19:36,533 --> 01:19:37,682
Brackett was right.

1452
01:19:37,933 --> 01:19:39,002
Banker's a crook.

1453
01:19:39,493 --> 01:19:41,563
Laurie, I'd like to assign you to--

1454
01:19:41,813 --> 01:19:44,008
There's something you can help me with.

1455
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:47,724
If Baily doesn't talk tonight,
I'll need a sidebar.

1456
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:51,365
Do you think you could plug me in
out in the field?

1457
01:19:51,613 --> 01:19:54,571
I was planning to free you up
to work on the bank fraud .

1458
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:58,928
People have lost their life savings.
Nobody's covering the story.

1459
01:20:03,773 --> 01:20:06,970
It's not the microphone.
You really must talk louder.

1460
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:09,612
Could you please come. . . .

1461
01:20:12,893 --> 01:20:14,485
-Don't touch me.
-No one's allowed in.

1462
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:18,851
I really must advise against this.
Your husband is just not strong enough.

1463
01:20:19,093 --> 01:20:20,606
Mrs. Williams. . .

1464
01:20:21,093 --> 01:20:22,811
. . . I saved your husband's life.

1465
01:20:23,173 --> 01:20:25,971
His first interview
should be with Kevin Hollander.

1466
01:20:27,613 --> 01:20:29,331
We really need the money.

1467
01:20:31,933 --> 01:20:33,571
3, 2. . . .

1468
01:20:34,293 --> 01:20:37,046
Cliff,
Sam Baily, the man who shot you. . .

1469
01:20:37,293 --> 01:20:40,808
. . .is pleading for forgiveness.
How do you feel about that?

1470
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:42,566
I've known Sam for a long time.

1471
01:20:42,813 --> 01:20:44,451
I don 't think he meant to hurt me.

1472
01:20:44,813 --> 01:20:45,962
That's right, Cliff.

1473
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:48,204
Doctor said it looks like I'll be okay.

1474
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:49,772
I got no problem with him.

1475
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:52,925
-See? You' re a very lucky man.
-How's that?

1476
01:20:53,173 --> 01:20:54,891
He just gave you his blessing .

1477
01:20:56,733 --> 01:20:58,963
Did Cliff get money to do that show?

1478
01:20:59,213 --> 01:21:00,692
Sure. It's a tabloid .

1479
01:21:00,933 --> 01:21:02,844
Big bucks. Show business.

1480
01:21:03,093 --> 01:21:04,003
How much?

1481
01:21:04,253 --> 01:21:05,766
I don't know . 1 0 grand .

1482
01:21:06,013 --> 01:21:06,923
1 0 grand?

1483
01:21:07,933 --> 01:21:10,572
If Cliff can get 1 0 grand,
I could get 50 grand .

1484
01:21:10,813 --> 01:21:12,292
I' m the whole deal .

1485
01:21:12,653 --> 01:21:14,803
I thought this wasn't about ransom .

1486
01:21:15,413 --> 01:21:16,926
This ain't about ransom .

1487
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:18,811
About show business.

1488
01:21:20,773 --> 01:21:22,684
Left, right, left.

1489
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:26,564
You shoot a guy, take kids hostage
and now you want money for it.

1490
01:21:26,813 --> 01:21:28,963
How do you think that'll look to people?

1491
01:21:29,213 --> 01:21:31,522
I don't care.
I got to make money for my family.

1492
01:21:31,773 --> 01:21:34,810
Maybe later you'll write a book,
we'll make a TV movie. . . .

1493
01:21:35,053 --> 01:21:37,613
I know people who might
help you with that. But not now .

1494
01:21:37,853 --> 01:21:42,131
I need to check out them shows to see
how much they pay. You go do that.

1495
01:21:47,733 --> 01:21:48,722
What?

1496
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:52,291
No, it's just the kids playing around .
What is it?

1497
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:54,888
Hollander wants to see you right away.

1498
01:21:55,173 --> 01:21:56,492
That's it? Fine.

1499
01:21:56,733 --> 01:21:57,563
What's up?

1500
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:02,963
You want to make money on this,
you call the tabloids.

1501
01:22:03,213 --> 01:22:07,047
You don't need me for this.
I got Kevin Hollander out there.

1502
01:22:07,293 --> 01:22:11,081
We planned to do an important show
on you, but you do what you want.

1503
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,122
Kevin Hollander?

1504
01:22:13,373 --> 01:22:14,647
He's here?

1505
01:22:29,333 --> 01:22:31,893
Listen,
Larry King wants to make you an offer.

1506
01:22:32,133 --> 01:22:34,044
A full hour tonight,
you and your boy.

1507
01:22:34,293 --> 01:22:36,329
-Talk to my agent.
-This is global .

1508
01:22:36,573 --> 01:22:37,562
The networks can't compete.

1509
01:22:37,813 --> 01:22:39,929
I have something else going for him .

1510
01:22:40,573 --> 01:22:41,483
Come here.

1511
01:22:42,653 --> 01:22:43,972
You know where to reach me.

1512
01:22:46,373 --> 01:22:47,772
What did Gottsegen want?

1513
01:22:48,013 --> 01:22:49,605
I'll give you 3 guesses.

1514
01:22:50,373 --> 01:22:52,887
The network wants you
to turn Baily over to me.

1515
01:22:53,173 --> 01:22:54,925
I' m doing a prime-time special .

1516
01:22:55,173 --> 01:22:57,892
You' re creative.
Maybe you could get him a variety show .

1517
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:06,444
You little fuck, if you want back on
the network, turn Baily over to me now .

1518
01:23:07,893 --> 01:23:10,123
Don't screw this up for yourself, okay?

1519
01:23:12,453 --> 01:23:14,648
Sam belongs to the network, okay?

1520
01:23:16,933 --> 01:23:18,252
You hired her.

1521
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:19,892
You taught her.

1522
01:23:21,493 --> 01:23:23,085
Oh, come on, Max.

1523
01:23:32,373 --> 01:23:34,284
How is this going to end?

1524
01:23:38,053 --> 01:23:39,486
I' m getting out of here.

1525
01:23:40,133 --> 01:23:41,885
Or what?

1526
01:23:42,733 --> 01:23:44,849
Because they' re not going to let you go.

1527
01:23:45,493 --> 01:23:46,448
Max Brackett said--

1528
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:49,082
Max Brackett is not your friend, Sam .

1529
01:23:52,053 --> 01:23:54,647
If you had listened to me for 5 minutes,
that's all I wanted .

1530
01:23:54,893 --> 01:23:57,407
I wish I had listened to you.

1531
01:23:58,573 --> 01:24:01,087
But this is much bigger
than you and me now .

1532
01:24:01,333 --> 01:24:04,131
They' re forcing you
to do something drastic.

1533
01:24:05,773 --> 01:24:08,048
I don't want to scare you,
but they' re. . . .

1534
01:24:09,053 --> 01:24:10,691
They' re ready to kill you.

1535
01:24:12,053 --> 01:24:14,806
And Max Brackett
is not going to stop them .

1536
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:21,924
You know what? You've been
so sweet to me, how can I say no?

1537
01:24:22,173 --> 01:24:23,845
You've got your show .

1538
01:24:24,573 --> 01:24:26,291
All right. That's smart.

1539
01:24:28,053 --> 01:24:29,406
-What?
-Congratulations.

1540
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:31,006
Okay, just a sec.

1541
01:24:32,733 --> 01:24:35,850
You were right.
The polls have turned against him .

1542
01:24:36,733 --> 01:24:41,249
It's flipped .
59'%' positive down to 32'%' and sliding .

1543
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:43,006
It's the kids' parents.

1544
01:24:43,253 --> 01:24:46,051
They' re all over television
and they' re just killing him .

1545
01:24:46,453 --> 01:24:47,329
I'll call you back.

1546
01:24:47,573 --> 01:24:48,767
Baily's polls. . . .

1547
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:53,729
I want to make this as objective
and balanced as we can.

1548
01:24:53,973 --> 01:24:57,807
I want to see more stuff
on the guy in the hospital .

1549
01:24:58,053 --> 01:25:00,931
Somewhere,
somebody says he's dangerous.

1550
01:25:01,173 --> 01:25:02,845
I want to see that.

1551
01:25:03,293 --> 01:25:06,251
I want to see pieces
on the racists out there.

1552
01:25:06,493 --> 01:25:10,008
Why are they piling on this bandwagon,
cheering him on?

1553
01:25:10,253 --> 01:25:12,608
Start pulling that material .
Get back to me.

1554
01:25:13,213 --> 01:25:15,852
It's going to be great
working in New York together.

1555
01:25:16,093 --> 01:25:19,369
You' re not being objective.
You want to sink him .

1556
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:20,682
We have a deal .

1557
01:25:20,933 --> 01:25:23,572
He's sunk. It's over.
It's another kind of story.

1558
01:25:23,973 --> 01:25:27,932
He's the same person.
You can't do this. He's an innocent.

1559
01:25:29,493 --> 01:25:31,848
-I'll put that angle in the story.
-Not an angle.

1560
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:34,049
It's not an angle,
it's the truth.

1561
01:25:34,773 --> 01:25:37,082
-He shot a guard .
-It was an accident.

1562
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:40,643
He didn't know the guard was there,
that the children would be there.

1563
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:42,770
He's an out of work husband .
He's--

1564
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:46,323
We' re all impressed with your humanity.
Really.

1565
01:25:47,533 --> 01:25:49,205
Where's yours?
You'll kill him .

1566
01:25:49,693 --> 01:25:53,049
Cut this stuff out. Get out of here.
Let's get back to business.

1567
01:25:53,293 --> 01:25:54,442
" Business" ?

1568
01:25:54,693 --> 01:25:55,808
Yeah.

1569
01:25:57,053 --> 01:25:58,088
Business.

1570
01:25:58,933 --> 01:26:01,527
Max, come here.
Let me give you a little advice.

1571
01:26:01,773 --> 01:26:03,445
Don't screw this up again.

1572
01:26:03,693 --> 01:26:05,684
You got a network deal here.

1573
01:26:06,093 --> 01:26:08,004
Don't blow it for some hick with a gun.

1574
01:26:08,253 --> 01:26:11,802
You know what?
I' m not going to let you destroy him .

1575
01:26:12,533 --> 01:26:15,366
Pal, if you don't deliver Baily to me. . .

1576
01:26:16,933 --> 01:26:20,812
. . .you'll be lucky to get a gig
giving the surfing report in Kansas.

1577
01:26:22,493 --> 01:26:25,212
Kansas is starting to sound
pretty good to me.

1578
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:33,648
Getting harder to move the line?

1579
01:26:33,893 --> 01:26:35,292
It doesn't move.
You cross it.

1580
01:26:35,533 --> 01:26:38,684
-That's not what you said before.
-I know it now, Lou.

1581
01:26:47,693 --> 01:26:49,092
It's time, Sam .

1582
01:26:50,933 --> 01:26:52,412
What do you mean, it's time?

1583
01:26:52,653 --> 01:26:54,564
It's time to give up.

1584
01:26:55,933 --> 01:26:59,482
What are you talking about? You said
you'd set up an interview with that guy.

1585
01:26:59,773 --> 01:27:02,731
Hollander's getting ready to hurt you.
He'll make you look bad .

1586
01:27:02,973 --> 01:27:06,045
-I ain't afraid of him .
-Be afraid . Be very afraid .

1587
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:09,244
I ain't afraid of anybody right now .

1588
01:27:10,053 --> 01:27:12,692
-I can take care of myself.
-No, you can't.

1589
01:27:15,173 --> 01:27:17,607
You told me that the people like me.

1590
01:27:19,053 --> 01:27:21,169
I also said the public's very fickle.

1591
01:27:23,013 --> 01:27:25,846
If you don't set it up with Hollander,
I will .

1592
01:27:26,093 --> 01:27:27,048
Fine.

1593
01:27:27,573 --> 01:27:29,052
Let's get someone else.

1594
01:27:29,893 --> 01:27:30,962
Is he as big as him?

1595
01:27:31,253 --> 01:27:32,288
Bigger.

1596
01:27:32,613 --> 01:27:33,887
And nicer.

1597
01:27:36,133 --> 01:27:37,088
Fine.

1598
01:27:40,933 --> 01:27:42,332
Set it up, newsboy.

1599
01:27:42,573 --> 01:27:44,006
Sam, I' m on your side.

1600
01:27:44,253 --> 01:27:45,686
After the interview . . .

1601
01:27:46,573 --> 01:27:48,131
. . .you and I will end it.

1602
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:51,361
You lost the exclusive.

1603
01:27:51,613 --> 01:27:53,046
No, I didn't.
I did not lose it.

1604
01:27:53,293 --> 01:27:54,965
-Made us look preposterous.
-I didn't.

1605
01:27:55,213 --> 01:27:59,684
After announcing all day your one-on-one
with Baily, now you want to what?

1606
01:27:59,933 --> 01:28:02,652
Just look stupid?
You want the network to look witless?

1607
01:28:02,893 --> 01:28:05,088
-Jeremy, listen to me.
-No, you listen to me.

1608
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,891
You' re done.
You' re coming home.

1609
01:28:07,133 --> 01:28:09,727
No, I am not coming back there.
I'm staying here.

1610
01:28:09,973 --> 01:28:10,883
It's Brackett's now .

1611
01:28:11,133 --> 01:28:14,842
I'll take care of Brackett. I won't let
anyone say I let the network down.

1612
01:28:15,093 --> 01:28:16,651
Nobody's going to say that.

1613
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:21,369
-Do you got everything I need?
-Everything is here.

1614
01:28:21,613 --> 01:28:23,205
How are the kids, Sam?

1615
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:31,167
You 've got a couple of your own,
don 't you?

1616
01:28:31,413 --> 01:28:32,323
I got 2.

1617
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:35,610
Are they friends, by the way,
with any of these kids?

1618
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:37,969
No. I mean,
they' re different ages.

1619
01:28:38,213 --> 01:28:42,889
Let's go to calls. Van Nuys,
California, you have a question?

1620
01:28:43,133 --> 01:28:47,843
What would you say to the people of the
former Soviet Union who are suffering. . .

1621
01:28:48,093 --> 01:28:50,766
. . .hardships greater than your own
in the United States?

1622
01:28:51,013 --> 01:28:52,685
I don't speak Russian.

1623
01:28:52,933 --> 01:28:55,003
Sam has a normal complement
of compassion.

1624
01:28:55,693 --> 01:29:00,005
Max Brackett, veteran newsman.
By the way, why are you here, Max?

1625
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:03,086
I' m just here to help.
Sam wants me here, so I' m here.

1626
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:06,643
Wichita, Kansas,
you 're on the air with Sam Baily.

1627
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:12,963
Liberals are saying guys like you
show why we need more gun control laws.

1628
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:14,726
I can't believe
they made us watch.

1629
01:29:14,973 --> 01:29:18,648
Everybody's got their own opinion
on that kind of thing .

1630
01:29:18,893 --> 01:29:21,930
To politicize this tragedy
is to go the wrong way.

1631
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:24,403
Max, this is my show.

1632
01:29:24,653 --> 01:29:27,611
Please. Sam 's doing well.
You don 't have to answer.

1633
01:29:27,853 --> 01:29:30,925
I know this is your show,
but I'm here to help.

1634
01:29:31,173 --> 01:29:33,562
I hope your show
helps this difficult situation as well.

1635
01:29:33,813 --> 01:29:35,326
Lubbock, Texas, go ahead.

1636
01:29:35,573 --> 01:29:37,928
How long are you going to hold out?

1637
01:29:40,293 --> 01:29:41,965
-He just needs space.
-He was talking to me!

1638
01:29:42,213 --> 01:29:43,168
It's been very. . .

1639
01:29:43,413 --> 01:29:45,085
. . .stressful . . .

1640
01:29:45,333 --> 01:29:46,448
. . .for him .

1641
01:29:49,013 --> 01:29:52,323
I don't think you know
the seriousness of this.

1642
01:29:52,573 --> 01:29:54,848
Okay?
Something's going to happen here.

1643
01:29:55,093 --> 01:29:57,846
You want to elaborate on that, Sam?

1644
01:29:58,293 --> 01:30:00,124
No, that's all . That's it.

1645
01:30:00,373 --> 01:30:01,692
From Madeline. . .

1646
01:30:01,933 --> 01:30:05,528
. . .I understand we have the mother
of one of the hostages.

1647
01:30:05,773 --> 01:30:06,728
Are you there?

1648
01:30:06,973 --> 01:30:10,010
Yes, I am. Thank you, Larry.
And thank you. . .

1649
01:30:10,253 --> 01:30:12,209
. . . for giving me a worldwide audience.

1650
01:30:12,453 --> 01:30:13,886
Hey, it's my mom .

1651
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:15,691
-Is it really?
-It's my mom .

1652
01:30:15,973 --> 01:30:19,602
This man has been pointing a gun
at my child for 3 days.

1653
01:30:19,853 --> 01:30:21,571
What about them?

1654
01:30:21,813 --> 01:30:26,568
Why do you deserve our sympathy after
what you 've done to those hostages?

1655
01:30:27,333 --> 01:30:29,563
I don't want no sympathy, all right?

1656
01:30:30,893 --> 01:30:33,327
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I' m not trying--

1657
01:30:33,813 --> 01:30:35,087
What're you trying to do?

1658
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,163
I think I know what I want to say.

1659
01:30:41,613 --> 01:30:42,648
Go ahead .

1660
01:30:45,093 --> 01:30:47,049
I was just taking care of my own.

1661
01:30:47,293 --> 01:30:51,252
Every man in my situation
would take care of his own.

1662
01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:52,892
That's all I was doing .

1663
01:30:53,133 --> 01:30:55,601
You don 't feel guilt
for what's gone down?

1664
01:30:55,853 --> 01:30:56,922
I feel bad .

1665
01:30:57,173 --> 01:30:58,845
You know, I feel bad .

1666
01:31:00,293 --> 01:31:02,807
But I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1667
01:31:04,893 --> 01:31:05,882
Quit.

1668
01:31:06,293 --> 01:31:08,329
You know, it ain't my fault.

1669
01:31:08,573 --> 01:31:10,723
Whose fault is it?
Who are you mad at?

1670
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:12,645
I ain't mad at anybody.

1671
01:31:12,893 --> 01:31:15,771
I mean, maybe,
you know, Mrs. Banks. . .

1672
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:17,366
. . .a little, that's all .

1673
01:31:17,613 --> 01:31:19,365
We don 't care about his excuses.

1674
01:31:19,613 --> 01:31:24,004
People like Max Brackett and the media
are turning him into some kind of hero.

1675
01:31:24,253 --> 01:31:28,644
We found this to be a good opportunity
to present all perspectives--

1676
01:31:28,893 --> 01:31:32,203
Since when do we need
all perspectives of a crime?

1677
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:33,522
Please. . .

1678
01:31:33,773 --> 01:31:35,445
. . .just let my child go.

1679
01:31:35,693 --> 01:31:37,172
Let them all go.

1680
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:39,804
Sam, response?

1681
01:31:41,013 --> 01:31:43,402
Just tell the lady I' m sorry, okay?

1682
01:31:44,853 --> 01:31:46,286
We 'll be right back.

1683
01:31:47,973 --> 01:31:49,008
We 're clear.

1684
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,492
We 'll be back in 2 minutes.

1685
01:31:52,733 --> 01:31:55,884
-If you' re uncomfortable, don't answer.
-Don't tell me what to do!

1686
01:31:56,133 --> 01:31:58,203
-Don't answer my questions.
-You' re not obligated .

1687
01:31:58,453 --> 01:32:00,842
People want to hear from me
what's on my mind !

1688
01:32:01,093 --> 01:32:03,971
-You need help sometimes.
-You don't need to sit here.

1689
01:32:05,093 --> 01:32:06,412
Fine. I' m outside.

1690
01:32:06,653 --> 01:32:09,042
-I'll take care of this.
-You' re in the shithouse.

1691
01:32:09,293 --> 01:32:10,726
And don't leave the building !

1692
01:32:11,173 --> 01:32:14,006
Everybody knows about it if I get mad !
Sit down!

1693
01:32:14,253 --> 01:32:17,689
You' re erasing everything we built!
You've buried yourself!

1694
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:26,443
Can I talk to that guy from Texas?

1695
01:32:27,013 --> 01:32:29,322
-You all set?
-Yes. It's all set.

1696
01:32:29,573 --> 01:32:31,450
I've got to talk to you.

1697
01:32:31,693 --> 01:32:34,287
She ought to have something
more upscale. More color.

1698
01:32:34,773 --> 01:32:38,049
New York is not happy you' re going on
without checking with them .

1699
01:32:38,293 --> 01:32:42,127
Brackett is a freelancer.
He's not with the network. Don't worry.

1700
01:32:42,373 --> 01:32:44,728
They need to know
what you' re planning on doing .

1701
01:32:45,813 --> 01:32:48,122
The other networks are leading
with Larry King .

1702
01:32:48,373 --> 01:32:50,933
Tomorrow they'll be leading
with my stuff.

1703
01:33:03,853 --> 01:33:06,003
Good evening
from Madeline, California. . .

1704
01:33:06,253 --> 01:33:07,527
. . .where the eyes of the nation. . .

1705
01:33:07,773 --> 01:33:11,846
. . . remain fixed on the events taking
place inside the museum behind me.

1706
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:16,650
But the real story I've uncovered since
I arrived here is even more troubling.

1707
01:33:16,893 --> 01:33:17,723
Quiet!

1708
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:21,648
I came to understand the unconventional
relationship between a reporter. . .

1709
01:33:21,893 --> 01:33:24,123
. . .and his subject,
and I began to worry.

1710
01:33:24,373 --> 01:33:28,969
And as I learned more about Sam Baily's
personality, I began to worry even more.

1711
01:33:29,413 --> 01:33:32,405
The testimonies on Mr. Baily
were not reassuring.

1712
01:33:32,653 --> 01:33:34,450
He 's really a sweet boy.

1713
01:33:35,253 --> 01:33:38,848
He 's confused,
but all he 's trying to do is get by.

1714
01:33:39,093 --> 01:33:42,210
Sometimes he screws things up
because he 's. . . .

1715
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:44,723
You could say he 's pretty weird.

1716
01:33:44,973 --> 01:33:46,201
Does he have a temper?

1717
01:33:46,453 --> 01:33:47,966
I don't even know that guy.

1718
01:33:48,213 --> 01:33:51,728
-I've seen him have a temper.
-So you 'd call him dangerous.

1719
01:33:51,973 --> 01:33:54,009
Dangerous, yeah. Dangerous.

1720
01:33:54,253 --> 01:33:56,562
This confused and dangerous man. . .

1721
01:33:56,813 --> 01:33:59,373
. . .is being advised by the reporter
covering the story.

1722
01:33:59,613 --> 01:34:01,729
Things are breaking down in there.

1723
01:34:02,893 --> 01:34:04,804
Let's get ready to move.

1724
01:34:05,813 --> 01:34:08,088
In his effort to tell
a more compelling story. . .

1725
01:34:08,333 --> 01:34:11,370
. . . the reporter, Max Brackett,
may have increased the danger. . .

1726
01:34:11,613 --> 01:34:14,047
. . .in an already critical situation.

1727
01:34:14,293 --> 01:34:16,329
I had hoped my suspicions were wrong.

1728
01:34:16,653 --> 01:34:17,802
Sadly, they were right.

1729
01:34:18,053 --> 01:34:20,647
I can guarantee
Mr. Baily is sincere in his offer.

1730
01:34:20,893 --> 01:34:24,772
I think things 'll become increasingly
unstable if you don 't grant him this.

1731
01:34:25,173 --> 01:34:29,803
Two little girls were set free,
supposedly at the behest of Baily.

1732
01:34:30,053 --> 01:34:32,965
But tapes of conversations
tell a far different story.

1733
01:34:33,213 --> 01:34:34,965
-Let's give them 2.
-I said one.

1734
01:34:35,213 --> 01:34:38,171
You shot a black man. Some people
are going to make an issue of that.

1735
01:34:38,413 --> 01:34:41,769
Show kindness to a black kid, it's hard
to play the race card against you.

1736
01:34:42,013 --> 01:34:44,766
A story that places a colleague
in an unfavorable light. . .

1737
01:34:45,013 --> 01:34:46,731
. . .is not one any newsman wants to tell.

1738
01:34:46,973 --> 01:34:48,565
Yeah, Kevin's the best.

1739
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,084
We had to improvise this
after Brackett sold us out.

1740
01:34:52,573 --> 01:34:53,688
Here he is.

1741
01:34:55,573 --> 01:34:57,291
The numbers are high.

1742
01:34:57,613 --> 01:35:01,322
There are children inside that building,
held hostage at gunpoint.

1743
01:35:01,693 --> 01:35:04,810
And inside that building
there is also the truth.

1744
01:35:05,173 --> 01:35:09,166
The facts of this story
are also held hostage, unfortunately. . .

1745
01:35:09,413 --> 01:35:10,562
. . .by Max Brackett.

1746
01:35:10,813 --> 01:35:13,885
And I'm sorry to say
they are all at great risk.

1747
01:35:14,133 --> 01:35:17,409
I'll be back with more
of our special report after this.

1748
01:35:23,093 --> 01:35:24,845
What did you do to me, newsboy?

1749
01:35:25,093 --> 01:35:28,085
I took a bad story
and made it good TV.

1750
01:35:28,333 --> 01:35:30,324
You' re still in better shape.
I' m screwed !

1751
01:35:30,573 --> 01:35:34,248
What you want to do now
is give up and let those kids go.

1752
01:35:37,053 --> 01:35:38,771
There's still people on my side.

1753
01:35:39,013 --> 01:35:43,723
You said you've seen these things
on TV before. Remember how they end?

1754
01:35:45,013 --> 01:35:47,243
The guy dies or he winds up in jail .

1755
01:35:48,613 --> 01:35:50,126
You ain't my friend .

1756
01:35:56,053 --> 01:35:57,008
Shoot.

1757
01:35:58,693 --> 01:36:02,083
You kill someone, you'll spend your life
in jail, or they'll fry you.

1758
01:36:02,333 --> 01:36:03,652
Please don't shoot him, Sam .

1759
01:36:06,773 --> 01:36:08,764
It's not over for you, Sam .

1760
01:36:09,453 --> 01:36:11,205
Will you get your act together?

1761
01:36:11,653 --> 01:36:12,373
You want to go home and be a daddy.

1762
01:36:12,373 --> 01:36:13,601
You want to go home and be a daddy.

1763
01:36:24,853 --> 01:36:26,002
Hey, kids.

1764
01:36:26,253 --> 01:36:27,368
Guess what?

1765
01:36:27,853 --> 01:36:29,684
I got some good news for you.

1766
01:36:30,853 --> 01:36:34,050
This is Lawrence Dobbins of the FBl.

1767
01:36:34,493 --> 01:36:36,404
You 're going to free your hostages. . .

1768
01:36:36,653 --> 01:36:38,769
. . .Iay down your weapons. . .

1769
01:36:39,013 --> 01:36:40,366
. . .and surrender.

1770
01:36:40,613 --> 01:36:41,841
Now!

1771
01:36:42,693 --> 01:36:44,046
I wanted it to be my idea.

1772
01:36:47,653 --> 01:36:51,487
You have five minutes
to lay down your weapons. . .

1773
01:36:51,733 --> 01:36:53,451
. . .and surrender.

1774
01:36:55,213 --> 01:36:58,922
Ijust learned Cliff Williams
is experiencing cardiac problems.

1775
01:36:59,173 --> 01:37:02,085
Doctors are working feverishly
to revive him .

1776
01:37:03,013 --> 01:37:05,846
Wait,
I see Mrs. Williams coming out now .

1777
01:37:08,013 --> 01:37:10,811
Would you like to make a statement
about your husband's condition?

1778
01:37:11,813 --> 01:37:13,883
Would you like to make a statement?

1779
01:37:14,213 --> 01:37:15,487
Please!

1780
01:37:15,973 --> 01:37:17,042
I want people to see. . .

1781
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:18,931
. . . what this is all about.

1782
01:37:20,933 --> 01:37:22,127
I want all the people. . .

1783
01:37:22,373 --> 01:37:25,171
. . . who 've been worrying
about Sam Baily's side. . .

1784
01:37:25,413 --> 01:37:27,449
. . . . to start thinking about my children.

1785
01:37:28,133 --> 01:37:30,567
Their father is dead!

1786
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:33,563
My husband is dead.

1787
01:37:36,733 --> 01:37:40,931
Mount Trinity Hospital has just
announced the death of Cliff Williams.

1788
01:37:41,173 --> 01:37:43,528
The tragedy of this simple man
started. . .

1789
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:48,130
. . . when Baily shot him because he tried
to help the children taken hostage.

1790
01:37:48,373 --> 01:37:51,092
After almost 3 days of the most unusual
hostage situation. . . .

1791
01:37:51,413 --> 01:37:56,009
Samuel Baily,
this is Lawrence Dobbins of the FBl.

1792
01:37:56,933 --> 01:37:59,811
You must free those hostages.

1793
01:38:00,893 --> 01:38:02,246
Lay down your weapon. . .

1794
01:38:03,333 --> 01:38:04,732
. . .and surrender. . .

1795
01:38:05,173 --> 01:38:06,447
. . .now!

1796
01:38:07,013 --> 01:38:08,571
Kids, come on.

1797
01:38:18,373 --> 01:38:19,328
Come on.

1798
01:38:24,573 --> 01:38:25,767
All right, go!

1799
01:38:26,013 --> 01:38:27,685
-See you, Sam .
-See you.

1800
01:38:27,933 --> 01:38:29,082
Good night, Sam .

1801
01:38:29,893 --> 01:38:31,246
I'll pray for you.

1802
01:38:31,493 --> 01:38:32,812
Good luck, Sam .

1803
01:38:35,653 --> 01:38:37,086
Thank you, Sam .

1804
01:38:39,253 --> 01:38:41,244
Look at all those lights.

1805
01:39:00,613 --> 01:39:02,729
You were great with the kids.

1806
01:39:02,973 --> 01:39:04,645
The court will remember that.

1807
01:39:08,733 --> 01:39:09,882
But I killed a man.

1808
01:39:10,133 --> 01:39:12,727
It was an accident.
I'll testify to it.

1809
01:39:13,933 --> 01:39:15,844
Nobody would believe you anymore?

1810
01:39:17,253 --> 01:39:18,811
That's a good point.

1811
01:39:19,973 --> 01:39:22,043
Would you like to talk to your wife?

1812
01:39:22,573 --> 01:39:24,131
Let me get her on the phone.

1813
01:39:26,813 --> 01:39:28,565
I heard about Cliff.

1814
01:39:29,533 --> 01:39:30,761
I killed him .

1815
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:33,646
I didn't mean to kill him .

1816
01:39:35,173 --> 01:39:38,051
You still have our kids to think about.

1817
01:39:38,453 --> 01:39:40,648
-How are they doing?
- They miss you.

1818
01:39:40,893 --> 01:39:43,168
I miss you so much.

1819
01:39:44,093 --> 01:39:45,765
They want you home.

1820
01:39:48,133 --> 01:39:51,762
Jen, I can't come home.
I ain't no good anymore.

1821
01:39:52,893 --> 01:39:53,803
Honey. . .

1822
01:39:56,373 --> 01:39:59,445
. . .it's time that we get this over with.

1823
01:39:59,693 --> 01:40:00,921
I know .

1824
01:40:02,013 --> 01:40:03,412
You mad at me?

1825
01:40:05,973 --> 01:40:07,804
No, I' m not.

1826
01:40:08,053 --> 01:40:09,645
I love you.

1827
01:40:10,293 --> 01:40:11,885
I love you too.

1828
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:15,722
This is Chief Lemke.
I'm asking you to come out now.

1829
01:40:18,453 --> 01:40:20,125
Oh, God !

1830
01:40:22,733 --> 01:40:23,882
Come on, Sam .

1831
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:25,407
Let's get out of here.

1832
01:40:25,813 --> 01:40:27,212
You go first.

1833
01:40:27,453 --> 01:40:29,489
-You go first.
-Okay. Sure.

1834
01:40:29,773 --> 01:40:34,449
I'll get them to put their guns away and
then I'll come back and get you, okay?

1835
01:40:37,853 --> 01:40:40,526
What actor do you want
to play you in the TV movie?

1836
01:40:42,413 --> 01:40:44,973
How about that guy Mel Gibson?

1837
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:47,364
Mel Gibson doesn't do television.

1838
01:40:47,653 --> 01:40:50,008
-Why not?
-You' re right. Why not?

1839
01:40:50,533 --> 01:40:52,888
Bad joke.
I'll explain it to you later.

1840
01:40:53,133 --> 01:40:55,010
Why? Television's good .

1841
01:41:20,693 --> 01:41:23,161
He's coming out now !
Unarmed !

1842
01:42:07,493 --> 01:42:09,165
Come away from the building !

1843
01:42:09,413 --> 01:42:11,210
No, I am not going to send him out. . .

1844
01:42:11,453 --> 01:42:14,172
. . .till I see you tell them
to put their guns away!

1845
01:42:14,413 --> 01:42:16,324
Step away from the door!

1846
01:42:16,693 --> 01:42:18,331
He's coming out!

1847
01:42:21,213 --> 01:42:22,726
What are you doing?

1848
01:42:22,973 --> 01:42:24,565
Sam, open up!

1849
01:42:24,813 --> 01:42:26,531
They' re going to let you come out!

1850
01:42:27,653 --> 01:42:29,132
We have a deal ! Come on!

1851
01:42:30,693 --> 01:42:32,251
Give me a few more seconds!

1852
01:42:32,493 --> 01:42:36,327
He is coming out! He's just
a little nervous! He's coming out!

1853
01:42:54,893 --> 01:42:56,212
We' re still rolling !

1854
01:42:56,453 --> 01:43:00,207
This is Oscar Harrington, live
on the scene in front of the museum .

1855
01:43:00,453 --> 01:43:01,852
There's been an explosion.

1856
01:43:06,693 --> 01:43:08,012
Debris is everywhere.

1857
01:43:13,893 --> 01:43:15,565
Somebody get the camera.

1858
01:43:23,373 --> 01:43:25,603
It looks like Max Brackett's alive.

1859
01:43:32,253 --> 01:43:33,925
Come on, I can walk.

1860
01:43:45,653 --> 01:43:47,371
Let me just go over there.

1861
01:43:51,933 --> 01:43:53,446
Stay with him .

1862
01:43:54,893 --> 01:43:56,167
I' m okay.

1863
01:44:07,093 --> 01:44:10,927
Get in there. Get as close as you can,
find out what he knows.

1864
01:44:12,253 --> 01:44:14,084
What were his last words?

1865
01:44:15,893 --> 01:44:18,407
I' m Max Brackett's assistant!

1866
01:44:19,893 --> 01:44:22,532
You'll go exclusive on this for me?

1867
01:44:22,773 --> 01:44:24,365
Sure. Where's Sam?

1868
01:44:25,013 --> 01:44:28,164
Sam? Sam is confetti .
No, don't wipe that.

1869
01:44:29,613 --> 01:44:31,092
How does that make you feel?

1870
01:44:31,373 --> 01:44:32,362
Where is he?

1871
01:44:36,213 --> 01:44:37,248
What did you say?

1872
01:44:37,493 --> 01:44:39,927
Sam's dead .
It's a bigger story now .

1873
01:44:44,173 --> 01:44:45,242
Don't wipe it.

1874
01:44:45,493 --> 01:44:46,687
It looks good .

1875
01:44:47,093 --> 01:44:48,287
Zoom in.

1876
01:44:49,093 --> 01:44:50,128
We killed him .

1877
01:44:50,373 --> 01:44:51,726
Could anybody have helped him?

1878
01:44:51,973 --> 01:44:55,522
-Did he say anything?
-Did he give you a message for his wife?

1879
01:44:55,773 --> 01:44:57,047
What are you feeling?

1880
01:44:59,493 --> 01:45:01,643
You don't understand !
We killed him !

1881
01:45:01,893 --> 01:45:03,008
We killed him !

1882
01:45:03,493 --> 01:45:05,006
We killed him .

1883
01:45:06,733 --> 01:45:08,451
You don't understand !

1884
01:45:09,253 --> 01:45:11,130
We killed him !

1885

GELULA & CO. , INC.

1886
01:50:22,869 --> 01:50:25,861
You be calm, because I got two things
I want to tell you.

1887
01:50:26,109 --> 01:50:28,748
I' m not listening to you as long as
you' re holding that gun.

1888
01:50:28,989 --> 01:50:30,661
Get that stupid thing away!

1889
01:50:32,429 --> 01:50:33,657
That was a shot.
Right?

1890
01:50:34,909 --> 01:50:35,898
Will you listen now?

1891
01:50:36,149 --> 01:50:39,107
We' re in a hostage situation
at the Museum of Natural History. . .

1892
01:50:39,349 --> 01:50:42,500
. . .where our correspondent,
Max Brackett, is being held hostage.

1893
01:50:42,749 --> 01:50:44,944
Do you want to tell us
why you' re here?

1894
01:50:45,589 --> 01:50:46,385
You don't.

1895
01:50:47,429 --> 01:50:49,385
I don't think you' re crazy.
I know you' re not a terrorist.

1896
01:50:49,629 --> 01:50:51,506
I know you' re just an ordinary guy
who popped his top.

1897
01:50:51,749 --> 01:50:53,102
People don't listen
to guys like me.

1898
01:50:53,349 --> 01:50:55,783
You got to connect
with those people out there!

1899
01:50:56,509 --> 01:50:59,182
I want everybody to back off,
and I'll talk when I' m good and ready.

1900
01:51:00,149 --> 01:51:01,662
-How's that?
-Sounded good to me.

1901
01:51:03,389 --> 01:51:06,028
With a simple demand,
the madness started.

1902
01:51:06,269 --> 01:51:08,305
You have to ask for a Lear jet
or a fast car.

1903
01:51:08,549 --> 01:51:09,345
I just want my job back.

1904
01:51:09,589 --> 01:51:11,739
I don't want him understood .
I want him out here and arrested .

1905
01:51:11,989 --> 01:51:14,583
With a reporter's ambition,
the story grew.

1906
01:51:14,829 --> 01:51:16,785
Mobilize every camera
and audio crew you can get.

1907
01:51:17,029 --> 01:51:18,906
Big bucks. Show business.

1908
01:51:19,149 --> 01:51:21,982
With the media 's power,
it became a spectacle.

1909
01:51:22,229 --> 01:51:24,220
You know that Sam Baily
is making you famous?

1910
01:51:24,589 --> 01:51:26,022
I just want to go home, okay?

1911
01:51:26,269 --> 01:51:29,944
Is getting the story
the same as getting the truth?

1912
01:51:30,189 --> 01:51:32,384
Police don't have any control, so
some news guy's running things?

1913
01:51:32,629 --> 01:51:34,540
Is the news what we need to know. . .

1914
01:51:35,029 --> 01:51:36,781
. . . or what we want to hear?

1915
01:51:37,029 --> 01:51:37,859
How do I know
you' re coming back?

1916
01:51:38,109 --> 01:51:40,543
Because you' re the best show
in town, Sam .

1917
01:51:40,909 --> 01:51:42,661
It may be unethical.

1918
01:51:42,909 --> 01:51:45,582
I don't want to cross the line, Lou.
I just want to move it a little.

1919
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:48,509
-It may be immoral.
- You know you 'll sink the guy.

1920
01:51:48,749 --> 01:51:50,819
I' m not sinking him .
He's sunk.

1921
01:51:51,189 --> 01:51:53,100
But it makes great television.

1922
01:51:53,349 --> 01:51:54,782
This insanity benefits your career.

1923
01:51:55,029 --> 01:51:56,587
Stop this nonsense!
Come out!

1924
01:51:56,829 --> 01:51:57,659
I hope it does.

1925
01:51:57,909 --> 01:51:58,705
No!

1926
01:51:58,949 --> 01:52:00,098
The world is watching. . .

1927
01:52:00,349 --> 01:52:02,419
In Madeline, California,
we've got this guy Sam Baily--

1928
01:52:02,669 --> 01:52:03,738
Jay Leno just said my name.

1929
01:52:03,989 --> 01:52:06,901
Why have you chosen to stay on
in this volatile situation?

1930
01:52:07,149 --> 01:52:10,061
. . .but is anybody listening?

1931
01:52:10,429 --> 01:52:13,023
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I' m not trying for this.

1932
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:16,306
When I go in front of the camera,
I will say that you' re in charge.

1933
01:52:16,549 --> 01:52:17,868
Say thank you.

1934
01:52:18,109 --> 01:52:19,178
You' re manipulating it.

1935
01:52:19,429 --> 01:52:23,183
I' m not manipulating anything .
I' m controlling the story.

1936
01:52:24,189 --> 01:52:28,068
I' m just kind of this guy
that has a job, goes to work everyday.

1937
01:52:28,309 --> 01:52:31,301
I don't know if anyone cares,
if anyone's listening to me.

1938
01:52:31,549 --> 01:52:32,618
It's my daddy.
