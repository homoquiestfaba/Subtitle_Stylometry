1
00:00:42,778 --> 00:00:45,778
resynchronization:
"R. Celeste"

2
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,412
SMALL INVADERS

3
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:20,650
RESTRICTED

4
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:29,550
- My God, Stewart!
- What?

5
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:31,650
Notes Tom finally
were posted.

6
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:37,601
- Look.
- Great.

7
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:40,226
- No A or B.
- No.

8
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:42,395
Even in
Health Program

9
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:47,579
- What is ...?
- It was a D.

10
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,223
How are they changing?

11
00:01:55,577 --> 00:01:57,549
A word and die.

12
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:00,652
Are you crazy?

13
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,735
- If your dad catches you, kill you.
- He will not catch me.

14
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,373
I do not understand. What you see
this guy?

15
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:13,960
Besides being beautiful, sweet,
sensitive, romantic,

16
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,093
funny and
absurdly athletic?

17
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,415
- Santa is coming and is angry.
- With whom?

18
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,880
- Tom!
- Tom!

19
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:29,625
- What?
- If you're so smart

20
00:02:29,626 --> 00:02:33,160
to hack the school site,
then you can pass in mathematics.

21
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:36,793
Do you think Bethany was accepted at
Michigan by carousing around?

22
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:40,029
Of course not. She entered
because it is perfect.

23
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,066
No, his sister worked hard
and that is what I expect from you.

24
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:47,974
You're right, Dad.
I do not deserve a family vacation.

25
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,058
I stay home tomorrow.
Learn.

26
00:02:50,059 --> 00:02:52,512
I will not fall for it, kid.

27
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:55,270
This is not you.
This attitude, these notes.

28
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,236
- What is happening?
- Nothing.

29
00:02:59,462 --> 00:03:02,986
I blame it all,
up between this right here.

30
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:06,030
Vacation antiquated
without technology

31
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:09,933
with close family
is exactly what we need.

32
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,948
Go to sleep. Hit the road
early tomorrow.

33
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:16,233
And you too.

34
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,584
Hannah, please
next time

35
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:41,490
you go in the middle, right?
- I'm going to throw up in the middle, remember?

36
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,093
... other news, it seems that there
more than fireworks night

37
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:06,851
since a meteor shower
adds excitement

38
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:09,938
- To our area this holiday.
- Legal. We will have a great show.

39
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,895
- It will be beautiful, people.
- Better wear hats tonight!

40
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:15,932
We do not want our heads
fire!

41
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:25,850
Wow. Your doll
is a complete idiot.

42
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:29,556
Ricky is not a doll.
We are in a serious relationship.

43
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:32,803
Talk a few years,
when you know what dating.

44
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,490
Type ... Ricky knows?

45
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,077
One more word about Ricky
and I swear I'll kill you.

46
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:41,920
Sure. No more fighting. Can stop.
We're almost there!

47
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,579
And there is the pool.
Bye!

48
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,211
Let's see Uncle Nate!
Yes!

49
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,711
Let me, Tom
Do not worry.

50
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,527
- Cool, huh?
- Very cool! He took it.

51
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:15,138
Had to book the discount
most boring place in the country?

52
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,805
We pertinho at least
a 6 fishing lakes in first!

53
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:22,409
We have the machine to go back 5 years
in time, when fishing was legal?

54
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,130
I bought a new reels,
technology antirreverso!

55
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,310
Pathetic.

56
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:41,847
Very pathetic ...

57
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,188
- Bela "landing", Nate!
- I said I could skid.

58
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:21,646
Nice try, little by
did not take my children.

59
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:26,213
But almost killed his mother
heart. Again!

60
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:27,754
- Grandma!
- Hi, Mom.

61
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,674
- Hi, honey.
- Grandma!

62
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,850
Sweetie!

63
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,639
- I brought something for you.
- I brought?

64
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,539
Brought, yes. Here it is!

65
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,694
- Thank you.
- It's so good to see you.

66
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:43,765
- I missed you.
- Hey, we.

67
00:06:45,301 --> 00:06:48,513
Well, one of the brothers Pearson
come have fun.

68
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:50,533
- This is at least legalized?
- No!

69
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,776
- Come on, Stu.
- Let's get him!

70
00:06:54,777 --> 00:06:57,432
- Nate, stop! What!
- Get him!

71
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,050
- Take his shirt.
- Mom

72
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:04,305
Whats up Stu is calling
a yummy mummy!

73
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:12,799
- Gemini, here.
- Hi, everybody.

74
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:15,751
- Put my bags on the bed.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:18,746
- Is it a wise guy?
- No! Definitely not.

76
00:07:18,747 --> 00:07:20,904
- Not the cause.
- Good

77
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:22,344
Now take it from here.

78
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:24,498
Wait. Why is
with the best room?

79
00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:26,654
- I came here first.
- I'm here now.

80
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,598
- I'm older.
- But I'm bigger.

81
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:34,571
- You have grown since Christmas?
- 5 centimeters, cousin.

82
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:37,933
I can get a card
Stop in without jumping.

83
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,517
- And the Mathematics Olympiad?
- Do not participate more.

84
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,643
Tired of being defeated?

85
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:48,799
Tom, come down here and help us
downloading. Fast.

86
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:51,374
Close my door to leave.

87
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:11,300
- Surprise, Princess!
- Ricky, what are you doing here?

88
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:15,089
I just came to spend the afternoon.
Or perhaps the night!

89
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:25,477
- What is it?
- What is what?

90
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,291
Ricky!

91
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:31,304
- Beware of the car.
- I do not believe you're here.

92
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:35,095
Is my girlfriend now,
then do everything for you.

93
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:37,290
Take a care for Dad!

94
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,658
Bethany! Please do not give
"affection for Dad!"

95
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,325
- Mr. and Mrs. P.!
- Ricky, what a surprise.

96
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,968
- I brought a gift.
- What love! He is not a love?

97
00:08:49,969 --> 00:08:52,698
- Yes! They are beautiful.
- They are wonderful!

98
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,067
Well patriotic, too.

99
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:56,650
Let's put the flags
the water and see if they grow!

100
00:08:56,651 --> 00:09:01,158
- Want to eat or drink something?
- That's very kind, I ...

101
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,138
like much, but my parents
have a house on the lake and

102
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:07,626
gotta get back before dark
if my car breaks down again.

103
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:11,913
- Problems with the car.
- Why not check for Ricky?

104
00:09:11,914 --> 00:09:13,925
I do not care
your hands dirty.

105
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,724
Try again, Ricky.

106
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:18,162
It should be obvious, Dad.

107
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:21,587
I have to be honest, mechanical
cars is not my forte.

108
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:25,374
If it were a spreadsheet or a book
accounting, I set off.

109
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:29,111
Why not stay here tonight
and take the car to the shop tomorrow?

110
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:31,997
- Mr. P. Very kind of you.
- Well ..

111
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,594
- Really? He can stay?
- Yes, in the office. On the couch.

112
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,575
- Sure.
- Not ready.

113
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:40,621
- Father!
- What slicker.

114
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,002
Yeah. Since no one sees it?

115
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:44,974
Man, parents have
"connections" different.

116
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,132
Their brains
are old. Moles.

117
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,121
Fried so
bad music of the 80s.

118
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:52,802
It is with you, Thomas. Must
defend the honor of your family.

119
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,442
As a man.

120
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:57,935
I call
"The Justiceira.

121
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:00,948
- Your father bought it?
- Profits of divorce.

122
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,971
Never underestimate the power of
feeling of guilt of a man.

123
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:07,177
Just the mention of the mother
already takes us straight to the mall.

124
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:11,933
It is all yours. Not
a coward forever.

125
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,004
I do not know, no, man.

126
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:21,482
Take a look at that face.
Really want to brother?

127
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:30,331
- No way.
- We prune the family tree.

128
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:33,867
This is quite funny,
is not, Ricky?

129
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,708
It? Well ..

130
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:38,271
You know, it's just the beginning.

131
00:10:39,335 --> 00:10:42,612
Wow, the sun beating
water e. ..

132
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,096
This cotton shirt
is ...

133
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:50,564
- Suffocating.
- I hate cotton.

134
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:54,389
Want to help pass
the sunscreen, baby?

135
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:02,257
I think I hit her boyfriend
with this is not the best idea.

136
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:05,419
It is not ideas,
but action.

137
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,378
Do not think. Do.

138
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:10,716
I can not believe I'm listening to you.
Is dressed in bush.

139
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:14,748
- Now, spread on my chest.
- Target is in action.

140
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,626
Bring it before
he goes further.

141
00:11:16,627 --> 00:11:18,125
I think not ...

142
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:28,260
- What? It caca head?
- Will compromise our position!

143
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,322
My God, she saw us.
What do we do?

144
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,036
She is coming.
Get down and stay hidden.

145
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,569
- Sorry, sorry.
- You shot my boyfriend.

146
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,327
Apology not even close.

147
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,258
When will grow
and stop being a shame?

148
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:52,871
- That's why we use camouflage.
- Shut up, Jake.

149
00:11:56,994 --> 00:11:58,716
I do not know what you
I was thinking.

150
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,551
- Yes I'll be okay ...
- A paintball gun?

151
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:03,051
Do not know what is dangerous?

152
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:06,338
And what next?
Bola? Pellet? Shock?

153
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,724
What will I do? What do you think?
I do not know what to do!

154
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,677
Leave it in the fourth
the rest of the week?

155
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:13,371
- But neither was I!
- Right.

156
00:12:13,372 --> 00:12:15,542
It was lucky he did not stay
seriously injured.

157
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:18,120
All right, Mr. P.,
has also been a child.

158
00:12:18,121 --> 00:12:22,274
What kind, Ricky. Thank you.
He is a nice guy.

159
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,062
But do not feel well
that.

160
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:27,003
We are here to fish, not to
hunt her boyfriend.

161
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:29,664
You could have him blinded,
would have been funny?

162
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,841
I think not.

163
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:37,335
Let's start from scratch.
Tomorrow, we fish.

164
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,552
- Seven o'clock.
- At seven?

165
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,742
- Are you kidding!
- I'm out. Nate!

166
00:12:41,743 --> 00:12:44,242
Yeah, Stu. Is not that
a little early?

167
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:48,492
How about this: 10 hours
the boat, without discussion?

168
00:12:48,621 --> 00:12:50,829
Good way to solve, Nate.

169
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:00,832
Hey, Stu?

170
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:06,364
- The TV blew up.
- Stu, the TV blew up.

171
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,046
Mother, stop it.
Must be the antenna.

172
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:11,207
After the rain
climb the roof and repair.

173
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,042
Wait, Mr. P.,
let me fix it.

174
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,445
It's the least I can do
for their hospitality.

175
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:18,921
- No, you're hurt.
- That was nothing.

176
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,937
No, dear, he is okay. Go there
Richard. Show your energy.

177
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:26,612
Absolutely.
But I need help.

178
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,994
What do you say, brother?

179
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,776
Our chance to bury
old hurts.

180
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:38,304
If hit with Ricky,
or not get off that roof.

181
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,493
Ladies first.

182
00:13:57,426 --> 00:13:59,192
Seems horror movie.

183
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:04,778
Sure. Let's go.

184
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,058
Look on the paintball ...

185
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:10,241
No questions asked.

186
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:13,000
Took! Too slow!

187
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:18,620
You know, thanks to his shot
I mean with their parents

188
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:21,528
and his sister is dying to be
my private nurse.

189
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,154
So thank you, champ.
It was a maneuver support perfect!

190
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,555
Come on, stop fooling around. Go on
and make me the hero of Grandma.

191
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:32,756
But I told my father
you to fix it.

192
00:14:32,757 --> 00:14:36,788
He said a lot of things to him.
Like, my car broke ...

193
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,919
My parents have
a house on the lake ...

194
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,919
I'm 18 ...

195
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:44,105
You are not forming?

196
00:14:45,121 --> 00:14:48,330
Not high school.
Now, go.

197
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,054
Go.

198
00:15:39,727 --> 00:15:41,082
Hello?

199
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,011
Hello?

200
00:15:59,285 --> 00:16:01,875
- Dude, you make too!
- Not funny!

201
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,350
What the hell happened
with the antenna?

202
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,879
I can not stand one weeks
no TV here.

203
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,693
I can not stand one weeks
here and point.

204
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:25,203
Hello, human!

205
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:27,452
Please say it is
saw it too!

206
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:32,193
- Not that I want, but yes.
- We came from up there.

207
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:35,374
- I take care of human contact.
- Yes, sir. Noted. Yes

208
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,945
Hello, human.

209
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:41,511
No need to call the army.
We come in "folders".

210
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:44,777
- In "peace." Repeat after me: "peace.
- What? What are you talking about?

211
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:48,460
Book idiot. Forget the book!
Attack humans! Attack!

212
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:50,232
With pleasure!

213
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:52,509
Human.
Submit yourselves!

214
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:57,006
- Why are they taking so long?
- No, come ...

215
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,047
Ricky!

216
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,690
- What is wrong with him?
- Now the fun begins.

217
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,613
Testing! Testing ...

218
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,266
Testing.

219
00:17:13,627 --> 00:17:17,884
Subjects insignificant.
We are the kind Zirconian.

220
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:21,737
And by this we demand
its lush planet like ours.

221
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:26,670
You have the choice between
servitude or ...

222
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:31,860
instantaneous death.

223
00:17:31,861 --> 00:17:33,985
- Run?
- For me is good!

224
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,168
You chose
instantaneous death.

225
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:40,042
- They are falling!
- It's locked!

226
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:41,665
Not escape me.

227
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:49,046
- And now?
- Get down!

228
00:17:55,556 --> 00:17:57,063
Unbelievable!

229
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:01,208
- Razor, go!
- Yes, sir!

230
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:09,753
- Can I play too?
- Thank God! Open! Fast!

231
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,570
Fast!

232
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:18,077
- Bichinhos disgusting!
- No! Back!

233
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,172
Care!

234
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,976
Hey, little toad!

235
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,336
What noise is that?

236
00:18:28,081 --> 00:18:29,408
Open the window!

237
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,511
- Open there.
- Open you.

238
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:33,648
- No, you open!
- Fast! Get them!

239
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:35,512
Someone open!

240
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,232
Let's right there.
They have to open ...

241
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:40,934
Fast!

242
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:42,881
Run, twins!

243
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,223
Fall everyone! Now!

244
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,958
- What?
- Come on!

245
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,287
Pets disgusting.

246
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:01,310
- Disgusting ...
- Go, go!

247
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:03,416
Down!

248
00:19:07,906 --> 00:19:10,628
Move! Fast!

249
00:19:16,144 --> 00:19:18,637
- Commander, be careful.
- What's up with that?

250
00:19:18,638 --> 00:19:20,445
- Beware!
- Fix.

251
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:22,773
I'll fix it!
This is very ...

252
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:24,837
- Are you a zombie?
- No.

253
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:26,928
- You?
- No.

254
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,555
- Prove it.
- What do you mean?

255
00:19:29,556 --> 00:19:32,574
- I mean, prove!
- He wet the bed up to 10 years.

256
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:34,575
- A zombie would not know it.
- There they are!

257
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:35,878
- Beware!
- Human ugly.

258
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:37,201
A rope!

259
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,298
- Tom, tie!
- I'm trying. Push strong!

260
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:44,511
God! God!

261
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:46,061
She scratched
with his claw.

262
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,563
Get out, idiot!

263
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,907
- He cut her nails!
- We gotta call 190!

264
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:02,556
- I can not sign.
- Me neither.

265
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:04,074
Mine too is dead.

266
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:07,675
Dwarves are Martians
be interfering.

267
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:09,088
It is never a good sign.

268
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,232
Working.

269
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:15,384
You do not have keys.
What is that thing?

270
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:17,553
It is a rotary phone.
You turn it.

271
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,336
What happened there? "Get them"
was not clear enough?

272
00:20:29,337 --> 00:20:31,448
Someone was
obviously distracted.

273
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:33,681
I was following
plan.

274
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,937
You kidding
with his toy.

275
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,502
- This is a deadly weapon.
- No.

276
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,320
- Yes.
- Those are deadly weapons.

277
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,951
Listen to what they say. So not
had success in the previous mission.

278
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:45,922
Not wanting to blame,
but it was the fault of the Razor.

279
00:20:45,923 --> 00:20:48,644
- What? It was you ...
- If we fail this time,

280
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,496
I lose my command.

281
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,101
Will learn
work together

282
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:55,445
or we all end up together,
collecting manure in Sector 7.

283
00:20:55,446 --> 00:20:59,625
We will not disappoint you, sir.
Come enslave some humans!

284
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,706
In fact, about that ...

285
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:04,578
I'm sure that enslave
is fun,

286
00:21:04,579 --> 00:21:06,179
- But because humans?
- What?

287
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,629
They do not seem so bad.

288
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,447
- Beginners ...
- "They do not seem so bad."

289
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:12,950
Funny, that's what our
former engineer said.

290
00:21:12,951 --> 00:21:15,108
- Former engineer?
- Well before the creature

291
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,868
"there seemed
bad "to eat it!

292
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:23,470
Humans are evil.
Peace is not an option.

293
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,934
Here is the sheriff.

294
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,886
There is an alien invasion
in our house.

295
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:33,388
Human small, short,
and violent.

296
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,337
- Baixinhos? Type ... a hobbit?
- No. Real.

297
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,605
I know it sounds crazy
but have to understand ...

298
00:21:38,606 --> 00:21:43,517
Listen son, do you know that a
false accusation is federal offense?

299
00:21:43,518 --> 00:21:46,344
- Is punishable ...
- Hello?

300
00:21:48,214 --> 00:21:51,622
Technical decent ...
for a female.

301
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,139
How about this technique?

302
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,468
Hello?

303
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,534
We must rely
our parents.

304
00:22:23,078 --> 00:22:25,140
Do you think he still
alien is a zombie?

305
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:34,968
You are useless. Because pins
mind control does not work?

306
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,285
You are the engineer,
discover. Fast.

307
00:22:38,286 --> 00:22:40,294
Fast. Fix it.

308
00:22:40,295 --> 00:22:42,298
He is not talking
with us, right?

309
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:47,343
I think you're getting the conversation
them. As a "bluetooth".

310
00:22:48,263 --> 00:22:51,342
Are you telling me that the pins
work only in mature subjects?

311
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:54,005
Why not plan it?
You failed me.

312
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,635
Your incompetent piece of ...

313
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,929
"Translation Unavailable".

314
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,385
These humans will pay.

315
00:23:05,683 --> 00:23:08,604
- Did you hear that?
- It seems that Ricky was the guy.

316
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:12,168
No. That they shot at us.
Control pins are mental.

317
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:15,569
Not work in children. Is like
said. We have "connections" different.

318
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:18,270
And Ricky? They got
and he has the age of Bethany.

319
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,173
He lied. Idiot
in college.

320
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:23,460
If you do not work in children,
means that we are saved.

321
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:26,864
- It means that we can fight.
- It means that our country will take up.

322
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,131
- They are walking targets.
- We have to tell them. Now!

323
00:23:30,132 --> 00:23:31,710
Hold on.
Think.

324
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,197
Se nossos pais chegarem perto,
will be caught and will turn zombies.

325
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:38,020
- Our fathers in the attack.
- We need the police.

326
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:41,125
- And a firepower heavy.
- Zombies armed. Better.

327
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,623
We lost.
Game over.

328
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:46,061
End game for adults.
But we can still fight.

329
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:48,910
Expected to prevent a
alien invasion alone?

330
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:51,570
He's right.
We are the only option.

331
00:23:51,755 --> 00:23:53,394
But we can not
tell anyone.

332
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:57,323
No police, no parents,
no exceptions, understood?

333
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:58,630
Hannah?

334
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,390
They are there in the attic. Now
same. Small aliens.

335
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,906
They are loud, are
scary and very bad.

336
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:12,347
- There are no aliens.
- There is. I saw them.

337
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:15,553
They broke the antenna and tried
break down the attic stairs.

338
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,370
I hope not,
for their own good.

339
00:24:17,371 --> 00:24:21,098
We pay a large deposit on the house.
It's good to keep in one piece.

340
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:22,934
You heard Tom,
No more problems.

341
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,589
It was just a video game.
We should not have let her see.

342
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,724
- Yes, video game.
- Scary.

343
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:31,468
Tommy, I'm afraid.
I do not like the evil aliens.

344
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,700
Do not worry, Hannah.
Pretend it's a great game.

345
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:38,554
A game that we win.
Think about how they are small.

346
00:24:38,555 --> 00:24:40,965
Small and deadly.
What we do now?

347
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:42,474
Found
their weakness.

348
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:45,581
They came from outer space
really think they have a weakness?

349
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:48,495
First rule
code warrior ...

350
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:50,715
"All enemies
have a weakness. "

351
00:24:50,716 --> 00:24:54,145
Sparks, because my map locator
not working yet?

352
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:56,808
I told you, I
parts to fix it.

353
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:05,405
Even on Earth
the male is dominant.

354
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:11,355
- Wait ...
- But the female always wins.

355
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:16,167
But what ...
Those rings Zirkon!

356
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:20,284
- It makes no sense!
- They were fighting ...

357
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,209
Now your lips are
is stroking?

358
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:25,124
- I never ... Never!
- Never.

359
00:25:25,125 --> 00:25:28,683
License, can I bring something?
Cold drinks or a snack?

360
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,190
Or would prefer to help me
to invade the planet?

361
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:38,193
Sure, there goes my
specialty. I rise.

362
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,197
- I'm with you.
- Tom, be careful.

363
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:54,979
Enemy ... seized.

364
00:25:57,043 --> 00:25:58,971
I asked him.

365
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,556
- Gross.
- What? Seriously, what?

366
00:26:07,557 --> 00:26:11,328
- Browser enabled, sir.
- Excellent, secure the goal.

367
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:14,567
Take a zoom.
Zoom!

368
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:20,392
- Zoom, zoom ...
- No need to be saying zoom.

369
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:26,664
- Zoom e. .. run.
- They're after something in the house.

370
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,156
- Running.
- Good

371
00:26:28,157 --> 00:26:30,144
- Let me see better.
- Stop.

372
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:36,945
- Turn, turn ... The basement!
- Tom, help me.

373
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:42,731
Must have hurt.

374
00:26:44,219 --> 00:26:47,165
Basement. We have to go
to the basement.

375
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,483
Ricky?

376
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,376
Ricky!

377
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:53,989
Personal expected.
Have you seen Ricky?

378
00:26:54,548 --> 00:26:57,173
Should be here,
somewhere.

379
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:59,006
- Beth ...
- He was not though, was it?

380
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:02,503
No. Him ..
said he was going to the lake,

381
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:06,706
tanning your abdominals.
He wants to see you there.

382
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,084
Hold on.

383
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:10,294
Talked about what
the roof?

384
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:13,030
- He said something about me?
- No.

385
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:16,787
No. He talked about
his car. E. ..

386
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,575
Almost exclusively on
his car.

387
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:21,776
- But you should go to the lake.
- It is the lake.

388
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:23,642
- It is there.
- The lake is there.

389
00:27:27,678 --> 00:27:30,409
I'm saying, map them
led to down here.

390
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,471
- Are you sure?
- Did you hear that?

391
00:27:33,472 --> 00:27:35,327
Sound of cornflakes ...

392
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:50,910
What is this?

393
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:55,733
They.

394
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,182
Something down here
is shooting it.

395
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:15,154
Whatever it is, we can not
let them be.

396
00:28:15,155 --> 00:28:16,843
Everyone, get ready.

397
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:19,340
- Come to my command.
- Wait a minute ...

398
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:23,858
If we go up there with a lot of
any crap we are screwed.

399
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,864
- We can do better.
- We are in the middle of a battle

400
00:28:26,865 --> 00:28:28,621
and wants to play
science fair?

401
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:31,181
Hardly.
Let's go back there now.

402
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:33,486
Before our parents
see zombies aliens.

403
00:28:33,487 --> 00:28:35,981
You're not thinking.
We need a plan.

404
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,155
I already have a great idea
for a weapon.

405
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:40,686
It? Come on.

406
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,071
Now!

407
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,515
Hannah, give me that tape.

408
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:53,921
- So?
- Hi, everybody!

409
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:55,774
Who wants a cupcake?

410
00:28:57,446 --> 00:29:00,968
Wow, that's a lot of tool
to try to fix the TV.

411
00:29:13,463 --> 00:29:16,757
They are trying to get out. Code
Warrior says "attack first".

412
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:18,166
Art, cover me.

413
00:29:18,578 --> 00:29:19,999
With the rake?

414
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:30,749
How do you feel now?

415
00:29:30,913 --> 00:29:32,400
Idiots.

416
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,785
Mission accomplished.

417
00:29:43,008 --> 00:29:44,318
Damn!

418
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:49,138
Failed.

419
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,451
But what ...

420
00:29:53,752 --> 00:29:55,820
- What's going on?
- We are floating.

421
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:59,233
They turned off the gravity,
as in "Halo".

422
00:29:59,234 --> 00:30:02,796
This is not an Xbox, Lee
It's real. As the Wii.

423
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,839
- What do we do now?
- I do not know.

424
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,266
Stay behind me.

425
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,687
- No. No!
- No, again ...

426
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:21,433
- Hello, humans.
- Enjoying the ride?

427
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:28,081
- They have gravity boots.
- Why do not we?

428
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:31,447
- "Boots of gravity" ...
- The door. Prevent them.

429
00:30:31,448 --> 00:30:32,831
Use your gun, Tom

430
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,428
- Go for it, meat sack.
- Today!

431
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:40,316
A potato gun?
This is your big idea?

432
00:30:40,317 --> 00:30:44,259
- My plan is working.
- My plan. That is my plan.

433
00:30:45,953 --> 00:30:47,853
Quick, Tommy.

434
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,026
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

435
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:10,498
- The door.
- I'm going.

436
00:31:11,197 --> 00:31:12,931
Jake, get the grenade.

437
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,304
Fast.

438
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:25,135
Fast. Play here.

439
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,513
What?

440
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,035
Monkey luck!

441
00:31:36,837 --> 00:31:38,388
You little ...

442
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,779
- Go. Stand back.
- Take them.

443
00:31:42,323 --> 00:31:44,659
- Shoot them.
- Go. will.

444
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,072
Shoot them.

445
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,782
- Venha!
- Okay.

446
00:31:48,815 --> 00:31:50,467
My ass is on fire!

447
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:55,007
This is the thing that use
to control Ricky.

448
00:31:58,164 --> 00:31:59,865
Cool. Let me see.

449
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,882
Good action buttons.

450
00:32:03,036 --> 00:32:04,757
What is this?

451
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,219
Let me see.

452
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,694
I got first.

453
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,179
Return.

454
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,184
Folks, this is not
a toy. It's real.

455
00:32:19,013 --> 00:32:20,376
- Ricky?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:23,557
Get it before someone else thinks.
I'll be watching the aliens.

457
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:35,943
I think that
will come out easy.

458
00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:39,598
- Where will he go?
- I'll find it.

459
00:32:51,241 --> 00:32:54,099
Cool, then these are the floor.
And these ...

460
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,144
Control arms.

461
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,160
Speaking of
gameboy supreme ...

462
00:33:08,546 --> 00:33:10,616
What does the big button?

463
00:33:17,004 --> 00:33:18,614
But what ...

464
00:33:18,615 --> 00:33:20,247
Car!

465
00:33:21,454 --> 00:33:23,121
It would be the button
on or off.

466
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:27,011
Press again.

467
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:33,082
- Who did this to my car?
- You did, you big idiot.

468
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,330
Ricky!

469
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:39,082
Where have you been?

470
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:42,106
Shut up, you little ...
Bethany?

471
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,424
What?

472
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,090
- Why are you hitting me?
- Why is it so lame?

473
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:49,623
Revenge
is so sweet.

474
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:52,865
I spent the last hour running
the lake. Where were you?

475
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:58,181
- I thought so.
- No, I do not know.

476
00:33:58,374 --> 00:34:00,805
- You want to take you back?
- I do not know ...

477
00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:03,067
Let him suffer.

478
00:34:12,488 --> 00:34:13,844
Where's Ricky?

479
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:18,519
- The aliens got him?
- No, worse ... my sister.

480
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:22,790
Some action up here?

481
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,630
It has been quiet.

482
00:34:24,973 --> 00:34:26,589
Too quiet.

483
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,076
Understand?

484
00:34:31,318 --> 00:34:33,032
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

485
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:34,794
What are you doing
ventilation?

486
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:37,143
The map of them. Thus
will arrive to the basement.

487
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:38,784
What do we do?

488
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:46,913
I hope that
work, Einstein.

489
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:50,728
I never got to thank
for having saved me there.

490
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,745
Why not needed
to do so.

491
00:34:52,746 --> 00:34:55,232
- That makes no sense.
- I do not like you.

492
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:57,170
- Cut the conversation.
- Right.

493
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,057
I'm sweating?

494
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:08,252
It's hot.

495
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,220
Hottest ...
Run!

496
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,372
Run!
Back!

497
00:35:17,485 --> 00:35:19,374
Sounds good ...

498
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,307
Good work.
I think it's working.

499
00:35:22,308 --> 00:35:24,855
Children. Come down here,
now.

500
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:28,683
Who turned on the heater?

501
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:31,672
I called.
We need it on.

502
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,588
- Are you crazy? It's July.
- Yeah, but is freezing here.

503
00:35:35,095 --> 00:35:38,924
- Wow. Arctic.
- I think Han is getting sick.

504
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,164
- Han, what's going on?
- We are fighting aliens.

505
00:35:44,165 --> 00:35:46,347
'm Pretending
is make-believe.

506
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,901
Quero dizer,
is make-believe.

507
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:52,233
Sure, but I'm not doing
account. Do not touch the thermostat.

508
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,891
- Tom, I'm not kidding.
- Me neither.

509
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:58,750
Tom, really. Want to spend the rest
the week in your room?

510
00:35:58,751 --> 00:36:01,322
Why not trust that there
a reason to do this?

511
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:04,024
One reason for melting
the boiler in the summer holidays?

512
00:36:04,025 --> 00:36:05,966
To shoot the boyfriend
your sister?

513
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:08,261
To discuss with me
this attitude?

514
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:09,916
To get low grades?

515
00:36:10,634 --> 00:36:12,168
So that's it.

516
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,480
I took grades
purpose.

517
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,541
It is my fucked
notes, okay?

518
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,098
I'm tired of being AZUCRINADO
to be a skull.

519
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:21,652
I was, it worked
me.

520
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:24,068
Not want to be like you.
I want to be cool.

521
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,568
Do not touch the thermostat.

522
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:39,491
Really? Are taking
grades on purpose?

523
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:41,787
Nobody likes a
Athlete of Mathematics.

524
00:36:42,693 --> 00:36:44,920
We can not fight them
with our parents here.

525
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:47,049
We can not simply
get rid of them.

526
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:48,833
Maybe we can.

527
00:36:49,514 --> 00:36:51,285
I want to do
the following ...

528
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,599
Send it.

529
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:00,781
I hate when we fight.

530
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:03,623
I can not fight with someone
as beautiful as you.

531
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,426
'm Glad
which made up.

532
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:07,892
Are not peace officers
without the kiss.

533
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,532
- Calm down, my family is there.
- And they are crazy for me.

534
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:14,390
- And you?
- You know I like you.

535
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,298
And we have all summer
before us.

536
00:37:16,827 --> 00:37:18,682
Perhaps we need not
go so fast.

537
00:37:19,508 --> 00:37:22,070
What?

538
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:29,718
This is a no?

539
00:37:30,328 --> 00:37:31,690
Ricky!

540
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,584
Ricky!

541
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:38,756
Caution, do not break.

542
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,737
- Ricky!
- Do you get the shirt.

543
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,052
Ricky!

544
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,378
Still no sign of them.

545
00:37:50,487 --> 00:37:52,963
- Where are they?
- Two options ...

546
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:56,972
We are dealing with a recession
or a surprise attack.

547
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,048
NO SIGNAL

548
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:06,596
Surprise attack.

549
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:14,788
Where's Tom?
I thought I'd help you.

550
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:17,203
- Me too.
- Bad news.

551
00:38:18,477 --> 00:38:19,964
The estate called.

552
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,969
They need to return there before
to close for the holiday.

553
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,678
- Really?
- Problems with the contract.

554
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,180
They insisted.

555
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:30,677
Ricky, are you okay?

556
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:36,119
It's just allergies, Mr. P.

557
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,630
But actually said
it is urgent.

558
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:41,215
Sure. I'll call
and will resolve it.

559
00:38:41,606 --> 00:38:43,226
What a strange thing.

560
00:38:46,701 --> 00:38:48,747
This is strange, Stu.

561
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:51,442
I think the phone
muted.

562
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:55,485
They cut our energy?

563
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:58,099
They will hear what I have
say! Come on

564
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,178
- We are going there right now.
- Hey, guys ...

565
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:03,375
We need more beer,
Snacks ...

566
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,782
Pass the market and I
light the barbecue.

567
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:08,526
- And take care of children?
- All right, whatever.

568
00:39:08,986 --> 00:39:10,402
No!

569
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,940
I mean, all you
have to go. They ...

570
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:18,131
They said that all their
names are on the list.

571
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:21,409
- I'll take care of children.
- I do not know if it's a good idea.

572
00:39:22,014 --> 00:39:23,969
Well, I think
could go driving.

573
00:39:25,204 --> 00:39:27,992
- Okay, okay.
- And, Mr. P.,

574
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:30,948
as it will go, can I bring
some adult diapers?

575
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:33,540
Mine is almost full ...

576
00:39:35,964 --> 00:39:40,635
- What is a bad allergy.
- Superabsorbent!

577
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:43,632
Look!

578
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,696
Fog deadly alien!

579
00:39:45,697 --> 00:39:48,168
- Do not breathe.
- Put it on pause.

580
00:39:52,425 --> 00:39:54,884
Happy 4th of July
worms space.

581
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,155
Jake, have smoke
ventilation.

582
00:39:57,156 --> 00:40:00,412
I did. They were moving
I have tracked down and amazed.

583
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:02,013
- Legal.
- Parents?

584
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:03,617
- If you have been.
- Legal.

585
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:06,795
Now we can take this
to a level above.

586
00:40:11,552 --> 00:40:14,632
This could get ugly.
Hannah, go into hiding.

587
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:15,983
- Yes
- Indo ...

588
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:17,326
You do not.

589
00:40:21,397 --> 00:40:23,860
- It's coming!
- Move! Go!

590
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:26,997
Swallow it, idiots!

591
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,015
- Ai ...
- Damn!

592
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:37,506
- Go! Run!
- Run!

593
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:45,519
I'm beginning to see
because the last engineer ...

594
00:41:08,995 --> 00:41:11,096
I see you put traps
in your room.

595
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:14,501
I got, got ...
I could not.

596
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,510
Trap human
despicable ...

597
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:33,223
I laugh a lot with you!

598
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,369
- It's okay, do not worry.
- We come in peace ...

599
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,307
It's okay,
I'll help you.

600
00:41:44,427 --> 00:41:46,855
Do not worry.
It's okay.

601
00:41:51,223 --> 00:41:54,289
It has a Machucadinho.
Do not move.

602
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:03,907
- All right?
- Thank you.

603
00:42:05,471 --> 00:42:09,047
Tazer. Razor.
Sparks ...

604
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:10,375
Sparks!

605
00:42:12,035 --> 00:42:13,904
It is essential
to our mission.

606
00:42:17,381 --> 00:42:19,772
- Beautiful sounds.
- It's music!

607
00:42:21,303 --> 00:42:24,454
- Music! I try?
- Sure!

608
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:54,493
Definitely the delay, but
those worms adapt fast.

609
00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:56,800
We enter
the big guns.

610
00:42:58,979 --> 00:43:02,711
Hissing black cat
or Fire Dragon?

611
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:05,459
That it would not set fire
the house?

612
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:15,083
He is armed ...
Enemy armed!

613
00:43:15,084 --> 00:43:17,436
Hannah, stay away
the alien.

614
00:43:18,373 --> 00:43:19,687
No.

615
00:43:20,354 --> 00:43:23,060
No! Leave him alone!
He is my friend.

616
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:25,569
He was pointing a gun
rays to his head.

617
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,499
It's my bubble blower.
He fixed it for me.

618
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,338
He is not
others. Look!

619
00:43:32,921 --> 00:43:35,357
At the first sign of
aggression, I will drop.

620
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:38,746
- With extreme damage.
- I have no training for it.

621
00:43:38,747 --> 00:43:41,615
- Training all.
- It's okay, Mr. Snugglelump.

622
00:43:41,616 --> 00:43:44,651
- Snugglelump?
- It was the name I gave to him.

623
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:47,102
- My name is Sparks.
- It's not your pet, Hannah.

624
00:43:47,103 --> 00:43:48,551
It is an alien weirdo.

625
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,720
He's my alien.

626
00:43:52,247 --> 00:43:53,549
Hi ..

627
00:43:57,017 --> 00:43:58,407
I mean ... yuck!

628
00:43:59,552 --> 00:44:02,699
Maybe she's right.
Look what his belt ...

629
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,209
It is to carry tools.

630
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:08,934
Okay, friend. Just want
talk to you.

631
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:10,513
Come, Snuggs.

632
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:12,731
Back.

633
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,385
Look.

634
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,968
Amazing!
How does he do it?

635
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,626
What was that?

636
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:04,135
Talking about feelings is
part of having a girlfriend.

637
00:45:04,136 --> 00:45:06,210
Had no reason
for that.

638
00:45:07,825 --> 00:45:11,108
Sure. Okay, understood. It will
talk while I scream.

639
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:13,894
Sorry, is ...
immature yelled.

640
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:20,856
Look, I'm so happy
to be his girlfriend.

641
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:24,490
But if you really care about me
like I care about you.

642
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:27,423
It should not be a problem
give me the time I need.

643
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:33,519
You may need to think about it.
I respect that, right?

644
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,998
Take the time you want.

645
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,604
I'll be here,
ready to talk.

646
00:45:42,747 --> 00:45:44,221
You.

647
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:53,707
So is this? I get the
silent treatment?

648
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:55,895
Who is in
school now?

649
00:46:01,083 --> 00:46:04,304
- Why are they trying to kill us?
- What is the plan of invasion?

650
00:46:04,305 --> 00:46:05,860
- What is your weakness?
- Water?

651
00:46:05,861 --> 00:46:07,443
- Earthworms?
- Women?

652
00:46:07,444 --> 00:46:10,132
- There are more of you coming from?
- We need the information.

653
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:14,059
- Do not be evil ...
- Hannah, we have to ask him.

654
00:46:14,317 --> 00:46:16,846
Whether the world ends?
Want?

655
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:19,594
No. ..

656
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,803
Home here.
Purpose of the mission here.

657
00:46:29,804 --> 00:46:33,000
What they seek is not in the basement,
is beneath him.

658
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,127
- Yes
- What to steal the planet?

659
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:38,651
This is not our planet.
Look at that, seems alien.

660
00:46:38,652 --> 00:46:40,337
Should be of their planet.

661
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:43,513
Is. The planet "Blossom."

662
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:46,513
Whatever it is, is huge.

663
00:46:52,815 --> 00:46:54,187
How does he do it?

664
00:46:57,007 --> 00:47:01,905
So this is what is in the capsule.
Some kind of giant machine?

665
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:04,511
Great. A huge
alien killing machine.

666
00:47:04,512 --> 00:47:07,775
- No one said anything about death.
- I doubt it is a copier.

667
00:47:07,776 --> 00:47:10,591
What! We can not rely
4 of this weird arms.

668
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,178
- He is one of them!
- It is not.

669
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:16,227
This guy does not match
others.

670
00:47:20,548 --> 00:47:21,904
He is ...

671
00:47:23,115 --> 00:47:24,429
else.

672
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:29,490
- Great. An alien "geek".
- Jake, he is not a "geek".

673
00:47:29,491 --> 00:47:31,782
It's better than one
alien assassin.

674
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,621
"Buenas Noches"
enrugadinha.

675
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,220
ESTATE
CREEK LANDING

676
00:48:02,649 --> 00:48:03,961
DESCULPEM,
ARE CLOSED

677
00:48:03,962 --> 00:48:05,401
This is ridiculous!

678
00:48:10,718 --> 00:48:12,157
What a mess!

679
00:48:18,142 --> 00:48:19,484
Modified!

680
00:48:22,596 --> 00:48:24,274
Beauty.

681
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:26,900
Beauty ...

682
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:30,908
Sorry.

683
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:37,184
- It's the strip. Hold up.
- Stay ... cold?

684
00:48:37,185 --> 00:48:38,493
Open up!

685
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:42,201
- Damn, forget Grandma.
- Wait. Hannah, fast.

686
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:45,141
- Hide your alien.
- Open the door now!

687
00:48:45,142 --> 00:48:46,787
Snuggs, enter here!

688
00:48:48,131 --> 00:48:51,332
- Wait a minute.
- Children of my children ...

689
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:55,715
entry requirement.
I have sweets!

690
00:48:55,716 --> 00:48:59,970
- Do not open. This is not Grandma.
- Are you sure?

691
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:07,401
Yeah, sure.

692
00:49:08,603 --> 00:49:11,027
Hand over the engineer
Sparks now!

693
00:49:11,028 --> 00:49:14,047
- Engineer? I do not know ...
- Move over, son of Earth.

694
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:15,392
- Move.
- Grandma ...

695
00:49:15,393 --> 00:49:17,341
Do not make me hurt you.
Grandma ... I ...

696
00:49:25,077 --> 00:49:28,877
- Return it to me.
- Tom, do something!

697
00:49:37,979 --> 00:49:39,880
Human disgusting.

698
00:49:43,265 --> 00:49:46,105
- Someone has to answer.
- Not to be, is dangerous.

699
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:49,248
- Here comes Grandma!
- Let my grandma alone!

700
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:51,302
Silence project
tiny human ...

701
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,279
I picked up the controller
Grandma!

702
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,682
Set me free! Or face
consequences ...

703
00:49:58,683 --> 00:50:01,190
- In here.
- You will not catch me. I got you!

704
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:02,505
You ...

705
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,150
Shake all you want,
we got him.

706
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:10,326
The suitcase. Go!

707
00:50:15,232 --> 00:50:16,595
It got me!

708
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:18,951
Stand still,
bastards of the earth.

709
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:22,766
- Got it! Let.
- Do not stop taking the Snuggles!

710
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:24,105
Art, fast.

711
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:26,719
- Shoot it.
- Shoot the humans!

712
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,863
- Shoot 'em up!
- Get down!

713
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,820
- You lost!
- It's ours forever!

714
00:50:37,169 --> 00:50:39,360
I, Han. Sorry
that got him.

715
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:43,414
- Beauty, eh?
- Very cool.

716
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:46,040
Here is the Sheriff's Department
of Creek Landing,

717
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,734
open this door immediately
will initiate or forced entry.

718
00:50:49,735 --> 00:50:52,004
- In 10, 9 ...
- Right.

719
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:54,927
You get rid of the strip,
I go after the aliens.

720
00:50:54,928 --> 00:50:58,410
- 5, 4 ...
- We can not leave it here.

721
00:50:59,035 --> 00:51:00,343
Um ..

722
00:51:00,344 --> 00:51:03,208
I do not know how much they know about
criminal codes,

723
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:06,181
but make phone calls with the intent
to annoy or disturb

724
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:07,610
is a serious offense.

725
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,567
Attention is criminal damage and may
mean 6 months in jail.

726
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,447
The 190 is only called
emergency

727
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:18,204
and any misuse of this system
compromises our line of defense.

728
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:22,464
And this defense is me.
Around here, I am the law.

729
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:26,337
Literally, I'm the only one. My
boss is on maternity leave.

730
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:29,491
Look, Sheriff, we apologize.
It will not happen again.

731
00:51:29,492 --> 00:51:31,650
Seriously ... You can go now
we behave.

732
00:51:31,651 --> 00:51:34,748
I "can" go?
Sure, we solve everything then.

733
00:51:38,123 --> 00:51:41,295
- What have you got?
- Squadron answer!

734
00:51:41,296 --> 00:51:43,252
- They are the Sparks?
- No!

735
00:51:43,253 --> 00:51:46,062
Do you have a job
you two do not go bad?

736
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:51,235
Answer. I'm sorry, I
excuses. That was unnecessary.

737
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:53,243
Still stuck in that
box, right?

738
00:51:53,804 --> 00:51:55,114
Yes, I am.

739
00:51:55,326 --> 00:51:57,814
- Get away, young man.
- No need.

740
00:51:57,815 --> 00:51:59,839
It's just the robot dog
my sister.

741
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,313
It is activated by sound.

742
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:05,490
- Okay, Han?
- Right! There is an alien.

743
00:52:07,266 --> 00:52:10,640
You know what? I'll take a look
inside. Please stay away.

744
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:25,907
It is the strip. Hold up.

745
00:52:27,505 --> 00:52:30,573
One hour. We were out for 1 hour.
What was, what they did?

746
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:32,826
Hi, I'm Nina Pearson
You all right?

747
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:34,876
- It's all right?
- No, ma'am.

748
00:52:34,877 --> 00:52:38,297
I would have to call the 190
about an alien invasion

749
00:52:38,298 --> 00:52:41,144
- Nothing is sure.
- They called the 190?

750
00:52:41,145 --> 00:52:44,458
Come on, buddy. Certainly can
release them with a warning.

751
00:52:44,459 --> 00:52:45,789
Look at them.

752
00:52:46,282 --> 00:52:48,054
Um, I'm not your buddy.

753
00:52:48,055 --> 00:52:50,841
Two, I noticed that his vehicle
is no license plate.

754
00:52:50,842 --> 00:52:54,976
- Three, that this will give you a fine?
- That it would not give?

755
00:52:54,977 --> 00:52:56,673
Nate, stop talking.

756
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:59,776
You tend to leave their children
so, without supervision?

757
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,213
No. No way.

758
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:04,758
We had to go to the estate.
They cut our electricity.

759
00:53:04,759 --> 00:53:06,885
For me, it seems
be all right.

760
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,777
Sheriff, I know that is something
difficult to explain.

761
00:53:09,778 --> 00:53:11,969
But honestly
there is nothing wrong here.

762
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:15,363
Why do not you and see for yourself?
Let's have a barbecue.

763
00:53:15,364 --> 00:53:16,920
- Stay with us.
- Mother ..

764
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:19,531
Thank you, ma'am, I would.
But I'm on duty.

765
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:21,514
The boys committed
a big mistake.

766
00:53:21,515 --> 00:53:23,549
And I guarantee that the
Tom will be punished.

767
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,341
But she's right. Have good
food. Why do not you?

768
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:29,663
I know it's service. But
no law against home cooking.

769
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,567
We have a lot of
hot dogs,

770
00:53:31,568 --> 00:53:33,456
burgers, steaks ...

771
00:53:34,792 --> 00:53:36,511
You'll love it.

772
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:39,126
Sure.

773
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:45,919
A decent meal.
I have not been as one.

774
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:48,499
- Okay, convinced me.
- Great.

775
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,949
I think one hour apart
not kill anyone.

776
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,357
Of course not.

777
00:53:53,994 --> 00:53:55,947
- Gotcha.
- Hey!

778
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:01,096
What was that?

779
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,939
- What was what?
- Something clicked.

780
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,031
- Come on, everybody. Dinner.
- We have dinner.

781
00:54:06,032 --> 00:54:08,353
Come.
I take dessert.

782
00:54:12,784 --> 00:54:15,632
- I'll get you, bastard.
- I'll get you, bastard.

783
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:17,537
- I said it.
- I said it.

784
00:54:17,538 --> 00:54:19,781
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

785
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:26,020
Fell in trivia!

786
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:29,793
Live the Zirkonianos!

787
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,826
Sure. Wait Mom, do not
I understand. What happened?

788
00:54:38,827 --> 00:54:43,978
One minute was cleaning
denture, the other was here.

789
00:54:44,356 --> 00:54:47,058
You know, may have a moment
those in their age.

790
00:54:47,059 --> 00:54:49,411
Sorry, I forgot.
Want cheese on a burger?

791
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:50,712
No.

792
00:54:50,713 --> 00:54:54,245
I think whoever invented love
and smash him with a hatchet.

793
00:54:56,387 --> 00:54:58,885
- Problems with boys.
- You and me both.

794
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,165
I do not know what to do about
the problem of Tom

795
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,726
We have a guest.
Put a smile.

796
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:07,470
- Nate, where's Jake?
- No idea.

797
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:10,306
Dinner is almost ready.
How about going for him?

798
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:14,034
Jake is an adult.
If you want to eat, come check.

799
00:55:14,417 --> 00:55:16,285
- Sorry.
- That was bad.

800
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:18,387
- Sorry.
- No, I'm asking.

801
00:55:18,388 --> 00:55:19,988
Oops Care
with his head.

802
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:25,943
There is nothing more American
a piece of meat in the stomach.

803
00:55:26,817 --> 00:55:28,946
- I bought the pickles.
- Really?

804
00:55:28,947 --> 00:55:31,274
If you think this will
rid it of that fine ...

805
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:32,883
No way, sir.

806
00:55:44,736 --> 00:55:46,788
It's my stomach.
I'm starving.

807
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:48,962
- Any news of Jake?
- Still no sign.

808
00:55:48,963 --> 00:55:51,688
- Where is he?
- Boys, none of the table.

809
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:53,441
- All right, Nate?
- Okay what?

810
00:55:53,442 --> 00:55:56,691
- They are playing with the phones.
- Yes, that is. Hit it.

811
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:02,238
- Can someone pass the mustard?
- Hey, Hannah?

812
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:04,446
Ate all
hot dogs?

813
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,419
No.

814
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:09,383
I mean, yes.

815
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:14,660
I say, walk by eating only
pasta, the police car.

816
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,513
Every day, alone.

817
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:22,454
- Are you comfortable up there?
- I hope so.

818
00:56:22,455 --> 00:56:24,783
Enjoy a little
land on your face.

819
00:56:27,929 --> 00:56:30,004
Attention, everyone.
Resistance is futile.

820
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:32,184
- I deem I need.
- Honey.

821
00:56:32,185 --> 00:56:35,398
- I knew you would.
- Back off, female hormone.

822
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:37,771
Wait. Are you
hormone calling?

823
00:56:37,772 --> 00:56:40,259
Get away. You irrelevant
for my mission.

824
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,564
Irrelevant?

825
00:56:41,986 --> 00:56:45,150
I do not care about your age.
Can not talk to me like that.

826
00:56:46,535 --> 00:56:49,597
- What is happening?
- Drama teenager. Think.

827
00:56:49,598 --> 00:56:51,882
The teen drama,
right, Ricky?

828
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:53,208
Snuggles!

829
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:55,567
- Turn it off.
- Not me.

830
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:57,867
Let. Bring Grandma.

831
00:56:58,275 --> 00:56:59,613
Stopped.

832
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:03,374
You have not
are released.

833
00:57:03,865 --> 00:57:05,310
Let them go.

834
00:57:07,163 --> 00:57:09,795
're Playing
a game, Uncle Stu ...

835
00:57:09,796 --> 00:57:12,907
I mean, Stu.
Are on vacation.

836
00:57:12,908 --> 00:57:16,633
I'm getting younger?
I think not.

837
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:19,844
Do you really want to deprive me
of my time with the children?

838
00:57:21,086 --> 00:57:23,372
Guilt is never tired.
Well, go ahead.

839
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,989
I think we should leave
Mom away from the wine ...

840
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,647
You lost!

841
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:51,259
And now the invasion
begin.

842
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,789
Invasion? There are
of you coming from?

843
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,299
More. And we
crush them like insects.

844
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,386
Do not crush them
first.

845
00:57:59,387 --> 00:58:01,595
I will not be defeated
by children.

846
00:58:01,596 --> 00:58:03,258
More signs of resistance

847
00:58:03,259 --> 00:58:06,436
and that they call
Jake will be deleted.

848
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:08,693
I want Snugglelump
back!

849
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,784
Basta. It's time to die.

850
00:58:14,035 --> 00:58:17,459
Richard
remember Grandma?

851
00:58:18,673 --> 00:58:22,230
- The game began.
- The game is over.

852
00:58:42,613 --> 00:58:46,119
- What a blow was that?
- Coup Samurai with twisted twist.

853
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,453
Grandma, get up!

854
00:58:53,508 --> 00:58:56,024
He is in the buff.
Have her get it!

855
00:58:57,545 --> 00:59:00,337
- Grandma!
- Lee, flying is their specialty!

856
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:25,300
- Get him, Lee
- I can not!

857
00:59:25,301 --> 00:59:26,638
Give me!

858
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,762
- Ricky?
- What the ...

859
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:52,512
Grandma?

860
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:06,093
This, human cry, for his
species no longer exist today.

861
01:00:09,266 --> 01:00:11,219
What the hell was
that thing?

862
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,964
An alien from space.
It's a long story.

863
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:16,758
We think they are here
to destroy the planet.

864
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:19,162
Come on, if not get down there
will be trouble.

865
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:22,121
I would say this is the
phrase of the century.

866
01:00:23,962 --> 01:00:26,356
Mother?
You okay?

867
01:00:28,983 --> 01:00:31,532
What happened?
How do I ... arrived ...

868
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:35,209
I need a glass of water.

869
01:00:35,941 --> 01:00:38,724
Sure. Somebody better
start talking.

870
01:00:38,725 --> 01:00:41,837
- Apparently it was a battle here.
- And there was.

871
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,848
- Grandma against Ricky.
- Not now, Hannah.

872
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,685
- Father, is not what it seems ...
- All of you up there.

873
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,997
- Now!
- Uncle Stu, it was not our fault.

874
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:50,366
Now!

875
01:00:55,815 --> 01:00:58,874
If you want to join them,
better cough up.

876
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,200
What the hell
happened here?

877
01:01:01,201 --> 01:01:03,151
I have no idea what
happened.

878
01:01:03,152 --> 01:01:06,453
But for years I did not feel
my column so good.

879
01:01:07,995 --> 01:01:10,623
Mother? Mother?
Where are you going?

880
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:12,235
Aliens.

881
01:01:21,418 --> 01:01:24,928
- Build a machine! Now!
- No!

882
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:36,472
My bad, guys.

883
01:01:37,509 --> 01:01:40,250
- It's all over.
- Finished?

884
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:45,079
As that is not finished.
Ricky're down with that ...

885
01:01:45,466 --> 01:01:48,029
- Rodent space.
- You do not understand.

886
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,337
An entire fleet that faces
is to invade.

887
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:52,682
So be a man and
Deal with it.

888
01:01:52,683 --> 01:01:55,009
I'm dealing with it ...
all day.

889
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,037
If he is afraid,
you can help me.

890
01:01:58,038 --> 01:01:59,702
Not without Tom

891
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:03,301
- Why?
- Because he is our leader.

892
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:09,615
Let. Not only is Ricky,
Jake also needs help.

893
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:13,165
- And Snuggles.
- And all the earth.

894
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:14,759
Even our parents.

895
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:25,078
Okay.

896
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,905
Let's save the planet.

897
01:02:29,398 --> 01:02:31,159
And her boyfriend silly.

898
01:03:01,057 --> 01:03:04,246
You want the monkey?
He is lucky.

899
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:05,566
I'm fine.

900
01:03:10,613 --> 01:03:13,538
Stay close. They can
be anywhere.

901
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:51,187
It's Jake!

902
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:56,272
He tied me up and Zirconian
Snuggles dragged out.

903
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,400
- God damn vacation!
- He saw the machine?

904
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:00,799
Yeah, you were right.
Sent here for years.

905
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,837
Some idiot built
this on top of it.

906
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,088
Personally, I found the first show.

907
01:04:05,089 --> 01:04:07,314
- He is waking up.
- Where the hell am I?

908
01:04:07,315 --> 01:04:10,013
Love, I'm glad
is well.

909
01:04:10,737 --> 01:04:12,291
Do not touch me!

910
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:16,782
- Stop!
- Okay.

911
01:04:16,783 --> 01:04:20,172
I know it has been a strange day,
but have to let me explain.

912
01:04:20,786 --> 01:04:22,174
Okay.

913
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:24,221
Sure.

914
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:26,572
I explain why
keep deleting,

915
01:04:26,573 --> 01:04:32,247
because I'm bleeding and because
his grandmother gave me a kick ninja.

916
01:04:32,248 --> 01:04:33,567
Sure.

917
01:04:34,019 --> 01:04:37,593
We are fighting against
aliens from space.

918
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:42,419
Yeah, they are small but
dangerous and very frightening.

919
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,048
Bright. I believe in you.
Why do not they?

920
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:48,376
Why waste time playing
hide and seek and kill aliens

921
01:04:48,377 --> 01:04:51,239
with his brother and stupid
their cousins stupid?

922
01:04:54,588 --> 01:04:56,806
Do not talk of
my family

923
01:04:56,807 --> 01:04:59,261
Well, look no further
worry about it.

924
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,600
Because we.

925
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:03,261
Should have stayed home and
out with Annie Filkins,

926
01:05:03,262 --> 01:05:05,973
is really good and not like
of talking about ...

927
01:05:05,974 --> 01:05:07,931
"feelings" all the time!

928
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:10,509
I'm going straight to
home of Annie.

929
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:21,441
I'm so sorry.

930
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,647
Do not.
Was right all along.

931
01:05:25,648 --> 01:05:27,669
If it's any consolation ...

932
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:29,658
he goes straight to
home of Annie

933
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:31,444
or anywhere
for a while.

934
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,048
Personally, this comes
"union brothers"

935
01:05:35,049 --> 01:05:36,682
are on alert
up here.

936
01:05:48,187 --> 01:05:49,720
My God.

937
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:52,150
- The forced to build it.
- Building what?

938
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:54,220
How will dominate the
world with that thing?

939
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:55,545
I do not want to find out.

940
01:05:55,546 --> 01:05:57,809
We must stop them before
the fleet arrives.

941
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:00,107
- Fleet?
- This is just the advance team.

942
01:06:00,108 --> 01:06:01,772
We need to rescue
Snugglelump.

943
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:03,668
- Snuggle what?
- Lump.

944
01:06:03,669 --> 01:06:06,218
The guy abroad.
He is on our side.

945
01:06:06,219 --> 01:06:08,373
The other three,
not so.

946
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:11,797
- This is not happening.
- We have to go there. Come!

947
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:13,363
Not so fast.
I have a plan.

948
01:06:13,857 --> 01:06:16,707
Help me here!
Someone has Mentos?

949
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,787
- Why?
- Pass here!

950
01:06:19,557 --> 01:06:22,063
- What? We shoot them?
- No.

951
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:24,222
We will projetinho
science.

952
01:06:30,216 --> 01:06:32,124
Bomb Mentos.
You're a genius.

953
01:06:32,671 --> 01:06:35,515
They should not do that.
Humans are friends ...

954
01:06:35,516 --> 01:06:37,000
It's coming!

955
01:06:38,135 --> 01:06:39,545
In my eyes!

956
01:06:39,987 --> 01:06:43,154
- Let's get them! Move!
- Come on. Go, go!

957
01:06:44,972 --> 01:06:47,373
- Snuggles!
- Traitor!

958
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:54,710
- Let me go!
- The powerful just been bagged!

959
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:57,814
He is unconscious.

960
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:01,096
- You!
- Get off my planet

961
01:07:01,097 --> 01:07:02,616
your child's blue ...

962
01:07:17,508 --> 01:07:21,784
- How do you feel now?
- We did it! We ended up with him!

963
01:07:22,779 --> 01:07:24,512
- How did it?
- Too bad ...

964
01:07:24,513 --> 01:07:27,828
Nothing beauty
Beauty is nothing ...

965
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:34,495
Hey, human ...

966
01:07:35,153 --> 01:07:39,795
machine ... expanded o. ..
Machine made Grand Commander ...

967
01:07:44,624 --> 01:07:48,425
Who is small now,
your worms of the earth?

968
01:07:48,426 --> 01:07:51,452
- Pretty cool, huh?
- We need a larger potato.

969
01:07:51,453 --> 01:07:54,268
Over. I won.

970
01:07:54,544 --> 01:07:56,826
- Where is he going?
- Where he wants.

971
01:07:56,827 --> 01:07:58,614
How so?
And Mom and Dad?

972
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,950
Guys, listen.
Not have much time.

973
01:08:12,951 --> 01:08:15,250
Sparks, anything
can go on that machine?

974
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:17,711
- Theoretically.
- Art, Lee, I control it.

975
01:08:17,712 --> 01:08:20,130
Bethany, I need to keep
the other prisoners.

976
01:08:20,131 --> 01:08:21,439
Sure.

977
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:26,772
Jake, come on. This
battle is not over.

978
01:08:27,076 --> 01:08:28,428
Others.

979
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:31,161
Ali!

980
01:08:31,418 --> 01:08:33,409
Cool! It was also higher.

981
01:08:35,893 --> 01:08:37,926
You are an alien
ugly.

982
01:08:40,294 --> 01:08:42,572
It can be ugly
but mine.

983
01:08:42,573 --> 01:08:44,441
You do not know when
give up, you know?

984
01:08:47,673 --> 01:08:49,838
We need a shot
clean his neck.

985
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,141
I rise.

986
01:08:57,577 --> 01:09:00,055
- Broke my nail!
- I do not care!

987
01:09:13,885 --> 01:09:15,736
My God, are signs!

988
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:17,573
He is calling
for the invasion.

989
01:09:20,977 --> 01:09:23,378
- My Madonna.
- Look at that ...

990
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:27,136
- God bless America.
- What is a patriotic act.

991
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:29,979
Not bad. But it is
nothing compared to this.

992
01:09:31,344 --> 01:09:34,133
These fireworks are there
Category 3!

993
01:09:34,134 --> 01:09:36,712
Think will win
another fine.

994
01:09:38,376 --> 01:09:41,257
Light them. Make that
there to shame.

995
01:09:43,668 --> 01:09:46,242
Got it.
Tom, come on, I thought.

996
01:09:48,122 --> 01:09:50,007
Make him turn around.

997
01:09:51,015 --> 01:09:54,717
Hey, down here, your
prehistoric garbage space.

998
01:10:01,558 --> 01:10:04,544
- Very good, Nate.
- It was great!

999
01:10:04,545 --> 01:10:07,925
They cost only U $ 1.99,
can you believe it?

1000
01:10:07,926 --> 01:10:11,309
- I guess it was not you, Nate.
- What is it?

1001
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:15,346
They.
They will arrive soon.

1002
01:10:15,688 --> 01:10:19,479
Open your eyes, folks.
There is only one answer.

1003
01:10:20,278 --> 01:10:22,786
- Rain of meteors.
- Really ...

1004
01:10:22,787 --> 01:10:24,608
- You are right.
- It's ... bright.

1005
01:10:30,187 --> 01:10:31,609
That's all you got?

1006
01:10:33,355 --> 01:10:35,634
- Oops!
- Come on ...

1007
01:10:37,424 --> 01:10:38,860
Tom shoots.

1008
01:10:39,545 --> 01:10:40,845
Shoot!

1009
01:10:40,846 --> 01:10:42,983
The collar it
remains disturbing.

1010
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:46,733
Care! The ugly
was great!

1011
01:10:47,464 --> 01:10:49,536
Hurry! Shoot, Tom!

1012
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:54,916
45 meters ... the aliens have an arc
of 20 with a volume of the square ...

1013
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,366
45 degrees.

1014
01:10:56,877 --> 01:10:58,196
What was that?

1015
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:04,693
Moved to the athlete
math wrong.

1016
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:14,769
- Yes!
- Get it closely ...

1017
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,455
- Comandante?
- Wait a minute!

1018
01:11:20,991 --> 01:11:23,560
Human unfortunate.
That's all you have?

1019
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:24,894
That's good.

1020
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:35,909
- See that?
- Sparks, revert the machine.

1021
01:11:46,186 --> 01:11:47,547
Very easy.

1022
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:53,425
- Nothing is working.
- Give it to me!

1023
01:11:57,070 --> 01:11:59,823
- Cruel, but effective.
- It was too much.

1024
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:07,130
- Reversed.
- Tommy, it's time!

1025
01:12:18,241 --> 01:12:19,864
You came back for me.

1026
01:12:19,865 --> 01:12:23,255
Let. We cherish
the lips Zirkon.

1027
01:12:34,329 --> 01:12:35,845
- Bethany!
- Han, okay?

1028
01:12:35,846 --> 01:12:37,196
- We are here.
- Bethany!

1029
01:12:37,197 --> 01:12:38,648
- Have you seen?
- Good work.

1030
01:12:38,649 --> 01:12:41,762
- Snuggs was great. You too.
- Tom, and others?

1031
01:12:42,506 --> 01:12:43,936
Many.

1032
01:12:51,114 --> 01:12:54,599
Backward. Back!
The machine is destroyed.

1033
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:57,466
We were overwhelmed
by humans.

1034
01:12:57,467 --> 01:13:01,882
The invasion failed! Back
to Zirkon immediately!

1035
01:13:01,883 --> 01:13:04,215
Backward. Back!

1036
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:13,415
Disappeared.

1037
01:13:14,884 --> 01:13:16,313
Over.

1038
01:13:16,701 --> 01:13:18,087
It's all over.

1039
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:20,726
We won.

1040
01:13:22,627 --> 01:13:24,999
Thanks Snuggs.
Everything.

1041
01:13:25,145 --> 01:13:27,898
You're a fine, for a
worm space. To miss.

1042
01:13:27,899 --> 01:13:31,950
Saudades? He will be here.
With us.

1043
01:13:32,585 --> 01:13:36,422
Please do not go.
Can be part of our family.

1044
01:13:48,552 --> 01:13:51,147
Han, I think he
already have a family.

1045
01:13:53,322 --> 01:13:54,936
My family.

1046
01:14:06,267 --> 01:14:08,148
Goodbye, Hannah.

1047
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:02,105
- Look over your notes ...
- Father, I'll spare you the sermon.

1048
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:05,580
You were right.
And I was wrong.

1049
01:15:05,911 --> 01:15:09,440
In the end, there are advantages
to be smart.

1050
01:15:10,629 --> 01:15:12,121
Sorry.

1051
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:18,449
Had a great sermon preparation.
Even trained in front of the mirror.

1052
01:15:25,356 --> 01:15:29,733
- Did you see the meteor shower?
- Yes, it was revealing.

1053
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:37,374
Beautiful shot, Grandma!

1054
01:15:38,593 --> 01:15:42,190
I got one!
It touches here!

1055
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:04,988
- Annie!
- Ricky ...

1056
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:07,850
- I was at the lake house?
- The vacation ended early.

1057
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:10,361
- This is for you.
- You are so cute ...

1058
01:16:10,362 --> 01:16:11,947
Is my girlfriend now,

1059
01:16:11,948 --> 01:16:13,953
then do everything for you.

1060
01:16:13,954 --> 01:16:16,165
Now take a caring
for pa ...

1061
01:16:17,943 --> 01:16:20,422
- Girls ...
- It's the night the girls.

1062
01:16:20,423 --> 01:16:23,489
But, you should come.
If you like to dance.

1063
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,891
Dance?

1064
01:16:25,892 --> 01:16:30,105
- You did not see what is dance ...
- Until I saw the Funky Ricky.

1065
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:42,320
Moment of underwear.

1066
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:45,943
- Ball bouncing ...
- I think that impressed.

1067
01:16:49,352 --> 01:16:51,412
Turn it off.

1068
01:16:52,847 --> 01:16:55,756
Ricky, is acting
strange.

1069
01:16:55,757 --> 01:16:57,294
What are you talking about?

1070
01:16:57,295 --> 01:16:59,495
Will turn it on again.

1071
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,396
I even get it!

1072
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:19,250
