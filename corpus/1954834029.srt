1
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:27,483
Another?

2
00:00:34,283 --> 00:00:36,249
Vodka tonic.

3
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,148
So, you think LA is going all the way this year?

4
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,013
Doesn't really matter.

5
00:00:45,548 --> 00:00:48,225
New York got knocked out in the first fucking round
by Jersey, so...

6
00:00:48,346 --> 00:00:50,210
Yeah, I know... Didn't even win a game.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,310
Sad.

8
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,309
You from out east?

9
00:00:55,546 --> 00:00:57,544
Cheering for New York, you gotta be from out east.

10
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,208
Staten Island.

11
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,238
Ah, yeah.

12
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:04,274
L.A.

13
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,272
Well... Thanks...

14
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,272
Anaheim. Close enough.

15
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,272
Texas, though. Jesus Christ.

16
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:12,271
Sick of this place already.

17
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,271
Been waiting 2 hours for this OKC flight.

18
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,338
It's like 4 hours for a 20 minute flight.

19
00:01:19,841 --> 00:01:21,807
You know, when I sat down...

20
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,625
I was afraid you'd be rooting for San Antonio...

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,600
Oklahoma City?!

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,533
Yeah, that's the one.

23
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:30,635
Hmmmm, you, too?

24
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:34,236
Yeah, well...

25
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,267
Guess I'll see you on the flight.

26
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:38,334
Guess so.

27
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,826
Come on.

28
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,646
Running it again isn't going to help. It's saying it's
declined.

29
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,146
That's... That's impossible. I have over $2,000 in that
account.

30
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:37,424
No, I have. I don't have anything“ I, um...

31
00:02:43,427 --> 00:02:45,288
You're gonna have to run it again. There's no-- Yeah,
I don't have any options.

32
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:47,286
Here.

33
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,286
Oh, you don't have to do that.

34
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:51,285
I was gonna rent a car anyway, and we're going to
the same place.

35
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,285
Don't worry about it.

36
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:55,285
Okay, well, thank you.

37
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:57,284
Oh... "Morris".

38
00:02:57,524 --> 00:02:59,284
Thanks.

39
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:01,284
Alright, here's your card.

40
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:03,351
Here's your broken card.

41
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:07,615
Have a safe trip or whatever.

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,687
I will.

43
00:03:21,453 --> 00:03:23,419
Yeah, I was at Rent OK...

44
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:25,616
And they declined my card...

45
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,614
I had them run it through again.

46
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:29,613
I've had problems with the stripe before.

47
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:31,647
But she said it was an actual "decline."

48
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,083
I should have at least $2,000 in there.

49
00:03:36,117 --> 00:03:38,082
Yeah, I can hold.

50
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:44,448
No, I know for a fact there's at least $2000...

51
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,494
Did you try what I told you.

52
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:34,593
last time?

53
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:40,995
Sort of.

54
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:44,492
We keep trying stuff...

55
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,591
Or, not trying stuff.

56
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,757
I just want to help...

57
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:53,857
And, I don't understand.

58
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,525
What do you not understand?

59
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,191
Well...

60
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,656
We've been together 3 years.

61
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,090
And it's not... It's not always this bad.

62
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:14,022
Sometimes whenever I touch her.

63
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:16,453
It feels like she...

64
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,601
She things I'm trying... I'm going to hurt her.

65
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:21,153
And I don't understand.

66
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,339
Hurting her is the last thing that I want to do.

67
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:29,253
Ada...

68
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,252
What's it like for you.

69
00:09:33,553 --> 00:09:35,519
Hearing Calvin say that?

70
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:38,382
That he...

71
00:09:38,618 --> 00:09:40,448
He doesn't want to hurt you.

72
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:43,151
Good.

73
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,716
Just good?

74
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,147
Yeah.

75
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,178
I000

76
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,178
I don't know.

77
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:56,245
Can you be more specific?

78
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,647
Does it...

79
00:10:00,214 --> 00:10:02,180
Make you sad... when he touches you?

80
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,669
Or...

81
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,044
Does it make you mad?

82
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,110
OranQYY?

83
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,978
Or scared?

84
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,710
What does it do?

85
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,235
I just wish he could read my mind...

86
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,901
Saying it makes it worse.

87
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,234
I just wish you could get it.

88
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,833
It's like this cloud of bad stuff.

89
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:19,733
It's around you all the time.

90
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,031
And it has nothing to do with you...

91
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,026
Or the person.

92
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:27,026
It's just there.

93
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,130
And it's following you...

94
00:11:30,832 --> 00:11:32,797
Sometimes it creates a storm.

95
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,230
Some psychologists believe that...

96
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,393
Things that happen to you as a child...

97
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,492
Or, even in the womb...

98
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,059
Stick with you, and...

99
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:53,156
Play out later in your life.

100
00:11:56,194 --> 00:12:02,387
I was reading the other day about this little girl that
had been molested.

101
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,225
By the time she got home...

102
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,958
She couldn't remember what had happened to her.

103
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,356
I couldn't believe it.

104
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:20,384
But there's... There's something about the human
mind.

105
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:26,388
Some memories are just to painful to keep.

106
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:31,119
Well...

107
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:33,217
Within reach.

108
00:12:39,486 --> 00:12:41,451
Does any of this mean anything for you?

109
00:12:43,218 --> 00:12:45,184
Do you think you...

110
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,716
Might be trying to not remember something?

111
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,216
No...

112
00:12:57,383 --> 00:12:59,348
I don't remember a lot of things, though.

113
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:02,773
It's just never been in my head,
so I would answer TI TI HO.

114
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,845
You don't remember a lot of things?

115
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,911
About being a kid? No.

116
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,278
I remember...

117
00:13:12,547 --> 00:13:14,309
Every second of childhood.

118
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,376
Everything.

119
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,197
I remember when I was in third grade there was
this...

120
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:22,442
Popular kid who had lost his bird.

121
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:24,472
And I wanted to be cool...

122
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,541
Or whatever. So I told him I had found it.

123
00:13:27,844 --> 00:13:29,809
He got really excited. And... and, he liked me.

124
00:13:34,176 --> 00:13:37,133
When I went home, his parents had called my
parents and they were so happy.

125
00:13:38,076 --> 00:13:40,041
But I didn't have it, so... whenever...

126
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,505
I had to get driven over to this trailer and apologize
to this crying kid.

127
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,570
That I had just crushed.

128
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:50,439
Jeremy... was his name.

129
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,505
Shuhhhh... Childhood was fucking agony.

130
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,038
I don't remember any of it.

131
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:07,993
Do you have any videos you could watch... Or photo
albums that you could look through?

132
00:14:09,304 --> 00:14:11,301
Maybe those would, you know... spark some
memories?

133
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,968
I have pictures from when I was a kid, yeah.

134
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:16,567
Why don't you...

135
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:18,564
Call your mom.

136
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:20,563
Ask her about it.

137
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,563
Or talk to your brother since you trust him.

138
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:26,664
And, maybe they would remember if something
bad happened to you.

139
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,954
Hey, I found a picture of me and Jay in a Power
Wheels.

140
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:47,895
He's wearing over-alls.

141
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,094
I think I found the “horrible thing."

142
00:14:50,362 --> 00:14:51,726
Maybe.

143
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,757
Did you call him yet?

144
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:55,757
No.

145
00:14:56,994 --> 00:14:58,858
I'm not gonna talk to my brother about.

146
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,207
Being molested or whatever.

147
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:02,825
Why not?

148
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,719
I don't... I don't know.

149
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:08,090
Did you call your mom yet?

150
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:09,358
No.

151
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,758
I don't want to get in trouble.

152
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:14,821
I don't want...

153
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:16,683
I don't want her to get upset.

154
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:21,135
I never figured out a way to talk to her about stuff
like that.

155
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,320
How do you spell it again?

156
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,919
Sheol?

157
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,188
Yeah.

158
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,880
SHEOL...

159
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:32,187
Oklahoma.

160
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,052
Wouldn't that be she-ole?

161
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:37,014
I don't know.

162
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:38,966
People say things a lot of different ways.

163
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,587
Like, we say "guad a loop“ for“Guadalupe."

164
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,581
Whatever you say.

165
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,418
Sheol, Oklahoma...

166
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,716
You're not going to find anything Googling it.

167
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,048
I already tried.

168
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,878
The only things that come up are...

169
00:15:55,118 --> 00:15:56,243
A picture of a church...

170
00:15:56,484 --> 00:15:58,348
And... a...

171
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:03,009
The arrest record of my uncle for selling pot and
trying to stab someone.

172
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:04,374
Jesus.

173
00:16:04,782 --> 00:16:07,272
I think he's actually the one who got stabbed.

174
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,140
Ohhh kay...

175
00:16:11,714 --> 00:16:13,680
It's like a population of 60 or something.

176
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:14,412
73.

177
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:15,647
73...

178
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:18,913
Yeah, there's not a lot on here.

179
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,278
Hey, here's me dressed as a cowgirl.

180
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,477
<i>HEY".</i>

181
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,476
It's only like 6 hours from Austin.

182
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,476
Like... 6 and change.

183
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:42,009
We should go up there.

184
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,372
See if it helps. See if...

185
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:45,938
You remember anything.

186
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,640
I don't want to go to Oklahoma.

187
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,473
If I'm going to drive 6 hours to some place, I want it
to be some place I like.

188
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:57,339
Well, we gotta do something, don't we?

189
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:00,572
Yeah...

190
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,828
I mean...

191
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:06,970
If you don't want to talk to anybody...

192
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:09,035
And, you don't want to go anywhere--

193
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:10,303
No, I know...

194
00:17:12,637 --> 00:17:14,603
Listen...

195
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,236
We'll... Make a big road trip out of it.

196
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,434
We'll... Pack stuff for a picnic.

197
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:23,465
Just go.

198
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,463
We'll make it a thing.

199
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:28,065
Do you really want to go to Oklahoma?

200
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,027
I love you.

201
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:31,960
I just want to help.

202
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,625
Worst case scenario: We go to some shitty place...

203
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:39,183
And we'll find out that the worst things that
happened to you...

204
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:42,497
Were church, and... and a knife fight.

205
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:46,561
And, then... We'll look for answers somewhere else,
right?

206
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,319
I guess.

207
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,896
Where will we stay?

208
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:56,728
No idea. No plans, whatsoever. Just fun.

209
00:17:57,996 --> 00:17:59,860
And you promise we'll have fun?

210
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:01,890
We will have the most fun!

211
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,161
And you won't let anyone stab me?

212
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,327
They would have to stab me first.

213
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,618
Did you really tell a sad boy that you had his lost
pet?

214
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:49,850
Yeah...

215
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,118
I did.

216
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:53,482
Um...

217
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:57,484
I guess I was kind of a total asshole to him.

218
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,749
I learned a valuable lesson about lying and decency
that day.

219
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,134
Probably the second biggest regret in my entire life.

220
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,315
What's number 1?

221
00:19:12,116 --> 00:19:14,081
Uh, not dancing with the Smurfs.

222
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:17,547
I'm sorry... what?

223
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:25,039
Whenever I was a kid... Uh... my family took me to
this amusement park in Cincinnati.

224
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:36,836
And, uh... They had this big Smurfs stage show where guys in Smurfs
mascot costumes danced around and, uh, did songs and shit on stage.

225
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:37,802
Okay"-

226
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,138
Um...

227
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:46,740
And, at the end, whenever the Smurfs were done
kicking Gargamel's ass or whatever...

228
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:50,060
They invited everybody up on stage to dance with
them.

229
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:51,438
Um...

230
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:57,898
And, so they were all like "hey kids do you want to come up
and dance with us and have fun and not be sad and shit."

231
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,970
And you didn't dance?

232
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,069
No. I... I didn't.

233
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:03,337
I didn't dance.

234
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,068
Uh, I'm... I'm probably remembering it as worse
than it was.

235
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,567
But, in my head...

236
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,670
An entire auditorium of a whole bunch of kids...

237
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:13,103
Like a thousand kids and their fucking happy
families...

238
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,228
Rush the stage and they all go up and they dance
with the Smurfs.

239
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,688
And, they dance and hug and do the fucking
Charleston.

240
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:23,800
Meanwhile, me and my dad are just sitting.

241
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,027
We are the last people left in the stadium seats.

242
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:28,368
And my dad... my dad turns to me and says...

243
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,624
“Cal, do you want to go dance?"

244
00:20:31,602 --> 00:20:33,567
And, I was just... I was 6.

245
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,700
And I was learning what being embarrassed was...

246
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,865
So, I say "no."

247
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,299
But, immediately, I knew I meant "yes."

248
00:20:43,832 --> 00:20:45,798
Because of course I do. Of course I want to fucking
dance with the Smurfs.

249
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,597
And, so I just sat there.

250
00:20:49,298 --> 00:20:51,264
With my dad, being bummed...

251
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:55,721
Watching a whole bunch of kids who weren't me
be... be happy.

252
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,928
And enjoy their fucking lives.

253
00:20:58,163 --> 00:20:59,630
That's horrible!

254
00:20:59,896 --> 00:21:01,054
It was!

255
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:02,557
It was... It was horrible.

256
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,795
But...

257
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,360
Yeah.

258
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,493
I don't know, that's...

259
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:13,386
Why I do shit like this.

260
00:21:13,627 --> 00:21:15,457
Impromptu road trips to Oklahoma.

261
00:21:16,293 --> 00:21:18,371
I don't ever want to not dance with the Smurfs
again.

262
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:21,154
I'm sorry, Cal.

263
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,425
I'm sorry, too.

264
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:25,192
If it makes you feel any better...

265
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:27,758
My parents never took me to an amusement park.

266
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,590
They mostlyjust did drugs.

267
00:21:34,123 --> 00:21:36,089
That doesn't make me feel better at all, Ada.

268
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,622
At all... Like not even remotely.

269
00:21:40,622 --> 00:21:42,740
I mean, I'm trying to remember all of these things...

270
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:45,687
And the one thing I do know...

271
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,419
I remember that both my parents did like a lot of
drugs.

272
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,450
I think my dad was a drug dealer.

273
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,719
Pretty sure.

274
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,783
We had one of those wicker chairs...

275
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,178
You know, those round wicker chairs.

276
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,283
Pa pasa n, yeah.

277
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,951
Like, the only people that have those chairs...

278
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:04,615
Are into a lot of drugs.

279
00:22:04,885 --> 00:22:06,681
They're into a lot of drugs!

280
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:08,747
My aunt had one of those chairs.

281
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:14,433
I guess... I guess I learned something about my aunt
today.

282
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,012
No, like the worst furniture we had was this glass that was
on top of these things that hold coffins up at funerals.

283
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,478
Ok, so what kind of Munsters shit is that?

284
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,110
I know!

285
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,845
Jesus.

286
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:39,477
Well, that's good, right?

287
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,777
It's good that you're like...

288
00:22:44,611 --> 00:22:46,543
Remembering things.

289
00:22:47,277 --> 00:22:49,141
Yeah, I remember things about Sheol.

290
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,274
I don't remember things about me.

291
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,074
Like, my mom was a crime scene cleaning lady.

292
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,504
In a town with 73 people?

293
00:22:58,741 --> 00:22:59,207
Yeah!

294
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:00,206
That's something that they need?

295
00:23:00,241 --> 00:23:01,240
Yeah, um...

296
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:04,938
No firefighters. But more than one person cleaning
up crime scenes.

297
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,206
Okay.

298
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,573
This one day, we woke up and...

299
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:15,435
This one guy poisoned all of the dogs in town and
then lined up the dead dogs all along the main road.

300
00:23:16,471 --> 00:23:18,403
Just dead dogs lined up.

301
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:19,331
Holy shit.

302
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:20,603
Yeah!

303
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:23,336
My mom cleaned this one murdered dude's house...

304
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:31,928
And, she found this drain in the bottom of his floor
for like collecting all the blood, and...

305
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:34,065
Sacrifice juices.

306
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:36,234
From whatever.

307
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:38,739
I guess he didn't want to get it moldy or whatever.

308
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:42,567
And, so we - right now - we are driving there?

309
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,499
Yeah, he had like deer legs glued to the wall...

310
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,336
Like some kind of House of a Thousand Deer Legs
bullshit.

311
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,129
And we are driving...

312
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:54,422
There?

313
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:57,230
Hey! You wanted to make it a thing!

314
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,586
My fault.

315
00:24:04,963 --> 00:24:06,929
Are you paying together?

316
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,791
I'm not sure. I may have to go check.

317
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,253
If you're interested.

318
00:24:34,591 --> 00:24:36,455
Did you find everything you were looking for?

319
00:24:36,724 --> 00:24:37,883
Yeah, thanks.

320
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:42,445
Where you headed?

321
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,216
Uh... Oklahoma.

322
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:46,580
Road trip.

323
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:49,255
Hmmm... sucks.

324
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,819
You look familiar.

325
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:54,883
Do you go to RHS?

326
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:57,418
No...

327
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,551
I'm from Cleveland.

328
00:24:59,786 --> 00:25:01,752
And, I'm like... 30.

329
00:25:03,352 --> 00:25:05,318
Oh... okay.

330
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:08,251
Okay.

331
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,181
Jay says "hi" by the way.

332
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,077
He's good.

333
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,180
Yeah.

334
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,517
<i>Mmmm hmmmnm.</i>

335
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,883
Tell Eddie I said "hi."

336
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:27,081
No, nothing, we're just on our way back home.

337
00:25:27,615 --> 00:25:29,580
<i>Mmmm hmmmnm.</i>

338
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,043
Hey, Cal's back so I got to go.

339
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,711
Okay.

340
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:37,513
Okay.

341
00:25:39,612 --> 00:25:41,578
Love you.

342
00:25:42,013 --> 00:25:43,876
Love you!

343
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:45,442
Say “I love you“ one more time.

344
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:48,811
It's fine. We'll meet up some time.

345
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:52,075
Okay, Mom...

346
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,832
I love you.

347
00:25:54,277 --> 00:25:56,141
Bye.

348
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,739
Bye!

349
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:07,785
Mom confirms, the Sacrifice Guy had a sacrificing
slab in his house.

350
00:26:08,008 --> 00:26:09,974
I don't believe it.

351
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,507
Did you tell her we were going to Sheol?

352
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:16,239
Hell no, I told her we were going to visit Jay!

353
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:18,738
Whatever.

354
00:26:19,439 --> 00:26:21,302
A slab!

355
00:26:21,572 --> 00:26:23,004
Cal.

356
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,802
So, now that we're getting close...

357
00:26:34,036 --> 00:26:35,900
Where do you want to start?

358
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,930
What do you want to see?

359
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:40,734
I mean the town is really small.

360
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,334
It's seriously like a post office and a church.

361
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:47,099
We could go by my old house. It looks like a barn.

362
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:50,899
Is it a barn, Ada? Did you grow up in a barn?

363
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:58,131
Thanks, Calvin.

364
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,297
For what?

365
00:27:00,732 --> 00:27:02,596
For doing this.

366
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:03,863
For...

367
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:06,561
Going with me. For driving. For...

368
00:27:06,831 --> 00:27:07,829
Being so sweet.

369
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,294
That's something I have to do.

370
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,562
I've got to be sweet.

371
00:27:14,329 --> 00:27:16,260
No, you really don't.

372
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:45,890
Sit down.

373
00:27:58,155 --> 00:28:00,121
I love you.

374
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,184
I'm sorry.

375
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,510
No, no...

376
00:28:05,753 --> 00:28:06,752
Kiss me.

377
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:07,852
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:08,977
You're okay.

379
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,485
You're...

380
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,616
It's okay.

381
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,472
Hi... uh...

382
00:29:20,707 --> 00:29:22,824
You wouldn't happen to know what's in this, would
you?

383
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,076
I cam in looking for Teddy Grahams, but I didn't see
any.

384
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:31,004
My girlfriend doesn't eat animal products so I have
to check everything.

385
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,503
What's that on your hat, boy?

386
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:35,033
My hat? Oh!

387
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:36,463
Cleveland.

388
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,669
Yeah, I know, they're fucking terrible.

389
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:42,468
But, I lived there for like 14 years so...

390
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:44,780
I don't know. Some stuff kind ofjust stays with you.

391
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:46,233
So, you're from Cleveland?

392
00:29:46,468 --> 00:29:47,901
Um... Bedford.

393
00:29:49,068 --> 00:29:50,932
But, the Tribe is from Cleveland proper.

394
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:52,200
So, yeah, in that area...

395
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,092
Tribe?

396
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:58,699
What, are you a damn Yankee?

397
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,265
Um... No, that's New York.

398
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,531
You know, what... I don't like your language.

399
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,435
You from goddamned Ohio, and you come into my
store?

400
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:15,868
Listen, I did not intend on offending anybody
whatsoever.

401
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:20,054
I just came into pee, and grab something to eat, so...

402
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:26,087
I tell you what, boy... You stand there one more minute, and
you're gonna see what I think about what you mean to do!

403
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:27,590
Fuck out of our town!

404
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,026
They didn't have Teddy Grahams?

405
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:41,991
Um, no... They didn't have anything.

406
00:30:41,992 --> 00:30:43,430
Um, no... They didn't have anything.

407
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:46,191
Acquiring satellites...

408
00:30:47,024 --> 00:30:48,888
I can tell you how to get to my house.

409
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:50,180
It's easy.

410
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,154
Is your phone getting any signal?

411
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,719
Can you like look it up?

412
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,688
The whole town is like S streets.

413
00:31:00,988 --> 00:31:02,954
Well, I can't... How can you even see where you're
going out here?

414
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:05,520
There's no street lights. Is that not a thing?

415
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:07,920
Are you sure you're okay?

416
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:10,187
I'm fine.

417
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,752
I said I was fine. I meant I was fine.

418
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,951
Let's just get to where we're going, okay?

419
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:19,818
Okay.

420
00:31:20,451 --> 00:31:22,417
Go up the road and take your first right.

421
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,017
Acquiring fucking satellites.

422
00:31:41,014 --> 00:31:42,980
Ada, I don't think this is it.

423
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,613
There's nothing here.

424
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:51,343
No, this is it. That's the dilapidated house. So my
house should be...

425
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:53,978
There. There's my tree!

426
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,809
There's not a house here.

427
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,511
No, this is it.

428
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,177
That's the tree my--

429
00:32:04,977 --> 00:32:07,671
My aunt told me that they used to hang people
from it.

430
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:09,875
We used to play on it all the time.

431
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,979
You should probably stop calling it "your" tree at
that point.

432
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,173
Jay fell out of it one night.

433
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,806
And I didn't know what to do.

434
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:30,537
So, I just poured Sprite in his mouth.

435
00:32:30,805 --> 00:32:31,828
He bit his tongue.

436
00:32:32,106 --> 00:32:33,866
Bleeding all over the place.

437
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,671
It just burned.

438
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:44,803
Ada, but there's not a house here.

439
00:32:51,802 --> 00:32:53,666
Did you have...

440
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:55,594
Did you have a basement?

441
00:32:58,534 --> 00:33:00,499
We had a crawl space.

442
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,596
This is a bad idea.

443
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,628
Why is it a bad idea?

444
00:33:21,863 --> 00:33:23,621
We're showing up in the middle of the night.

445
00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:25,391
I don't even know if she will recognize me.

446
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:27,628
And I'm knocking on a stranger's door.

447
00:33:27,862 --> 00:33:29,794
She's not a stranger. She's your aunt.

448
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,123
Davis Langston, this is the last time you're gonna do
this--

449
00:33:54,357 --> 00:33:56,221
Aunt Lindsay!

450
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,957
It's me, Ada. I'm sorry!

451
00:33:58,256 --> 00:33:58,722
I'm sorry.

452
00:33:58,989 --> 00:33:59,988
Oh, Ada!

453
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:04,286
Oh, baby... I haven't seen you in ages!

454
00:34:04,522 --> 00:34:06,045
What are you doing here?

455
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:07,685
We were---

456
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:10,151
We were here so we just thought...

457
00:34:10,421 --> 00:34:11,420
We'd stop by.

458
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,386
Your friend, is he okay?

459
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,319
Yes ma'am. Just startled me is all.

460
00:34:18,786 --> 00:34:20,718
It's been a bad night.

461
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,616
That's terrible.

462
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:24,851
Oh, that's terrible.

463
00:34:24,852 --> 00:34:26,010
Come in.

464
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:26,978
You come in.

465
00:34:27,251 --> 00:34:27,683
Come in now.

466
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:28,941
Come in. Come in.

467
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:30,480
Just, let's go.

468
00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:31,876
Come on in.

469
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,116
Come.

470
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:35,150
Oh, my god...

471
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:39,249
Are you alright?

472
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:04,811
Just wrap it up...

473
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:09,077
Make it all clean and nice...

474
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,708
Just get it inside...

475
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:14,136
Okay. Right there.

476
00:35:14,443 --> 00:35:16,409
That's gonna be good.

477
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:21,808
There.

478
00:35:22,075 --> 00:35:23,903
Sorry about the door...

479
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:25,335
And the lights...

480
00:35:25,607 --> 00:35:26,903
Gave you such a fright.

481
00:35:27,607 --> 00:35:29,471
I'm Ada's aunt, Lindsay.

482
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,262
And, you are?

483
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:32,505
My boyfriend.

484
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,406
What's going on with Davis?

485
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,469
Out.

486
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:38,738
Again.

487
00:35:38,806 --> 00:35:40,135
All hours.

488
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,302
I was just waiting for him there when you knocked,
so...

489
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,959
Sorry to scare you like that.

490
00:35:49,403 --> 00:35:51,369
Oh... You didn't give me a scare.

491
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:54,069
Nothing gives me a scare anymore.

492
00:35:54,502 --> 00:35:56,468
I live in Sheol.

493
00:35:59,468 --> 00:36:01,161
That's actually what--

494
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:02,233
Aunt Lindsay...

495
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:03,756
Would you mind if we stayed?

496
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:05,126
Oh...

497
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,230
No, not at all.

498
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,466
How long you thinking on staying?

499
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:12,599
We're just passing through.

500
00:36:13,332 --> 00:36:15,298
Calving, could you get the bags?

501
00:36:21,998 --> 00:36:23,862
Thank you.

502
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:31,884
I think I need to go to bed.

503
00:37:34,985 --> 00:37:36,950
Well, I'll put you two in Daddy's room.

504
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,716
I think I'm gonna stay out here for a while.

505
00:37:41,084 --> 00:37:42,947
Come with me.

506
00:37:43,216 --> 00:37:44,215
You sure?

507
00:37:45,283 --> 00:37:47,112
Alright.

508
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:48,381
Be careful.

509
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,382
Careful of what?

510
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:11,411
Don't mind Daddy.

511
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,347
Oh, you should be awfully comfortable here... uh...

512
00:38:20,476 --> 00:38:23,101
Calvin.

513
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:25,205
Is that French?

514
00:38:25,642 --> 00:38:27,506
I have no idea.

515
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:29,569
Well...

516
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:32,173
I don't know what you two do when...

517
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:34,340
You're in Texas...

518
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:38,872
But, while you're here in Daddy's house...

519
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,617
I expect that you're gonna respect Daddy's bed.

520
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:44,202
So...

521
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:45,530
Of course.

522
00:38:45,772 --> 00:38:46,465
Yeah.

523
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,416
You should be very comfortable right here.

524
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:56,769
Nice to have you, Calvin.

525
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:07,001
Does anyone have WiFi around here?

526
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:09,431
Does your mother know you're here?

527
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:11,360
No.

528
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:13,833
How's she doing?

529
00:39:15,366 --> 00:39:17,298
Never sends me a Christmas card...

530
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:19,124
Or talks to me...

531
00:39:19,366 --> 00:39:20,724
Get nothing for Easter from her...

532
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:26,731
What happened to our house?

533
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:30,496
Nothing, I suppose.

534
00:39:31,563 --> 00:39:33,761
We went there earlier to day and it's not there
anymore.

535
00:39:34,597 --> 00:39:36,562
I haven't been over to that house in years.

536
00:39:37,295 --> 00:39:39,261
Aunt Lindsay, it's two streets over.

537
00:39:42,628 --> 00:39:44,594
Where is your mother settling these days?

538
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:49,658
Hauls you and Jay off into Texas...

539
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:51,415
Leaves me here...

540
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:54,057
Well, that's like Del.

541
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,884
Never cares about nobody but Del.

542
00:39:57,292 --> 00:39:59,224
You know, I thought maybe it had been tom down
or burned down...

543
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:00,617
But, the tree is still there.

544
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:02,387
I mostly stay here.

545
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,148
By myself.

546
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:05,016
With Davis.

547
00:40:05,257 --> 00:40:06,587
When he's home.

548
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:07,948
Not injail.

549
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,781
Daddy...

550
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:11,387
Daddy's things.

551
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:17,988
What is that?

552
00:40:19,422 --> 00:40:21,387
Oh, my Fox?

553
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:24,153
Ada...

554
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:27,386
I just got it. It makes me feel stronger.

555
00:40:29,453 --> 00:40:31,317
When did you stop believing in God?

556
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:33,346
L\\ \\ \\\

557
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:37,751
You're so stupid.

558
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:41,917
Putting cuttings in your flesh is for the dead.

559
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:47,335
God said you're not supposed to put cuttings in
your flesh.

560
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,716
It says in The Bible!

561
00:40:51,383 --> 00:40:53,421
Aunt Lindsay, I never said I didn't believe in God.

562
00:40:55,116 --> 00:40:56,979
If you were my daughter I would throw you out!

563
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:59,112
Aunt Lindsay, it's a Fox.

564
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,325
No, don't go...

565
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:10,357
If you leave me, you'll never come back.

566
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,723
What should I do?

567
00:43:16,357 --> 00:43:18,323
She'll never get better.

568
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:20,420
I know.

569
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:23,688
What should I do?

570
00:43:25,255 --> 00:43:27,186
Send her to Hell.

571
00:43:27,421 --> 00:43:29,114
Or leave her there.

572
00:43:29,388 --> 00:43:30,717
When she finds it.

573
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:47,307
Oh, good morning.

574
00:44:48,007 --> 00:44:49,996
It's so nice to have you here.

575
00:44:50,473 --> 00:44:52,439
How'd you sleep?

576
00:44:53,672 --> 00:44:55,536
Davis is still asleep.

577
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:57,600
We have to keep it quiet.

578
00:44:57,838 --> 00:44:59,634
Would you like some breakfast?

579
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:00,803
I can make you some breakfast.

580
00:45:01,038 --> 00:45:02,504
I can make you some, um...

581
00:45:02,738 --> 00:45:03,862
I got some oatmeal...

582
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:06,401
We're probably just gonna...

583
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,669
Get out.

584
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:09,225
Take in the sights.

585
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,833
We'll be back later.

586
00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:15,335
It wouldn't take a minute...

587
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:28,997
Hey, why don't we just walk?

588
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:31,028
Are you sure?

589
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:33,265
The whole town is like five streets.

590
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:36,797
Whatever.

591
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,692
She wasn't always like that.

592
00:46:06,526 --> 00:46:08,390
Like what?

593
00:46:08,659 --> 00:46:10,250
Well, like that.

594
00:46:10,492 --> 00:46:11,530
She was always on drugs...

595
00:46:11,992 --> 00:46:13,981
But she wasn't always... like that.

596
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:16,988
Like, a weirdo?

597
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:18,223
Yeah, like a weirdo.

598
00:46:18,324 --> 00:46:19,688
I think, I'm pretty sure...

599
00:46:21,057 --> 00:46:22,921
If you're always on drugs and raising a kid...

600
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:24,678
That makes you always a weirdo.

601
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:28,020
I'm pretty sure everyone in this town is on drugs
and raising kids.

602
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,288
You would have to be!

603
00:46:29,488 --> 00:46:31,318
I mean, there's nothing here.

604
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:33,954
Yeah...

605
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:37,453
Everything feels like a weird dream...

606
00:46:39,653 --> 00:46:42,130
But, not real, you know? I feel like I've seen it in a
dream...

607
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,358
But, you know how sometimes you have those
dreams...

608
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:46,482
Where, like, I'm talking to Calvin...

609
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:48,349
But, really, you're a blue dog?

610
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:51,348
Wait, I'm a blue dog in your dreams?

611
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:53,414
Well, like, I don't know. It was an example, but
probably.

612
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:55,174
Is this a sexy thing?

613
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:57,516
No. No...

614
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,149
Wait, why am I a blue dog in your dreams?

615
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:03,727
I don't know. It just happens. It's how dreams work.

616
00:47:04,382 --> 00:47:06,246
Is it some weird Picasso thing?

617
00:47:06,516 --> 00:47:08,074
Being with me is a Blue Period for you?

618
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:09,213
Probably.

619
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:10,677
It's probably the Blue Period.

620
00:47:10,948 --> 00:47:11,606
Okay, great.

621
00:47:11,847 --> 00:47:12,846
Cool.

622
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:14,914
I'm probably gonna become a genius anytime now.

623
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,139
I hope so, and it's my fault.

624
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,146
Probably his most prolific period anyway.

625
00:48:13,304 --> 00:48:15,821
The only thing I remember about this place is the
ghost stories.

626
00:48:17,835 --> 00:48:19,824
There used to be train tracks over there...

627
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,601
Supposedly, some guy got off...

628
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:26,634
With a lantern.

629
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,864
And now you can just see it floating around...

630
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:31,429
At night.

631
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,566
That's colorful.

632
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,363
Yeah, I think the trick is...

633
00:48:37,632 --> 00:48:38,826
No one comes here at night.

634
00:48:39,465 --> 00:48:41,431
So, who knows?

635
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:44,430
Well...

636
00:48:44,831 --> 00:48:46,796
Your house is gone...

637
00:48:47,997 --> 00:48:49,963
Maybe you're supposed to wander?

638
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,495
That would explain my life.

639
00:49:22,158 --> 00:49:24,123
<i>HEY".</i>

640
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:26,723
You wanna go check it out?

641
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:29,388
It's Saturday.

642
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:31,487
I promised you church.

643
00:49:32,622 --> 00:49:34,588
We had Saturday service all the time.

644
00:49:34,822 --> 00:49:36,859
And, it's Oklahoma... I guarantee you they're open.

645
00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:38,385
Calvin...

646
00:49:57,018 --> 00:49:58,984
Guess I was wrong.

647
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:02,116
I feel really weird right now.

648
00:50:02,484 --> 00:50:04,348
Why, what's wrong?

649
00:50:04,617 --> 00:50:05,912
Excuse me.

650
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,014
Can I help y'all?

651
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:10,077
Um...

652
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:11,407
Yeah, uh...

653
00:50:13,116 --> 00:50:14,979
We were just trying to figure some stuff out.

654
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:16,247
And, uh...

655
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,545
We ended up here.

656
00:50:18,814 --> 00:50:20,439
So...

657
00:50:26,513 --> 00:50:28,478
And church...

658
00:50:29,412 --> 00:50:31,378
Is where you figure stuff out, right?

659
00:50:33,778 --> 00:50:35,642
Hello.

660
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:37,069
I'm Preacher Woodward.

661
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:38,674
How y'all doing today? You okay?

662
00:50:39,443 --> 00:50:41,307
You look a little pink, dear.

663
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:42,576
Y'all come on inside.

664
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,048
Sorry, if we're interrupting...

665
00:50:44,176 --> 00:50:44,607
No, no no.

666
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,976
It's why I'm here.

667
00:50:48,075 --> 00:50:49,939
Y'all come on in.

668
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:51,800
Nice and warm in here.

669
00:50:52,075 --> 00:50:53,073
Welcome.

670
00:51:09,572 --> 00:51:11,538
So, how can I help y'all?

671
00:51:13,005 --> 00:51:14,971
What's the matter?

672
00:51:16,471 --> 00:51:18,301
Oh, that's just Marlow, my daughter.

673
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,728
Sorry.

674
00:51:20,737 --> 00:51:22,601
She helps me with some of the busy work.

675
00:51:22,836 --> 00:51:24,630
We serve as the town's church...

676
00:51:24,903 --> 00:51:26,094
And mortuary.

677
00:51:26,836 --> 00:51:28,699
Telling people where to go...

678
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:30,331
And showing them how to get there.

679
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:31,123
Marlow, hunny...

680
00:51:31,401 --> 00:51:33,265
Say "hello." Be polite.

681
00:51:35,268 --> 00:51:37,131
It's okay.

682
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,399
Come on in.

683
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,659
I, um, God...

684
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:41,693
Do you have a bathroom I can use?

685
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:43,023
Is there a bathroom?

686
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:45,530
We have a bathroom in the fellowship hall...

687
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:47,730
There's a door in there, but it's locked.

688
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:50,661
There's another toilet downstairs, right through
them doors--

689
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:51,930
Okay, that's fine.

690
00:51:53,597 --> 00:51:55,563
Have a seat, bud.

691
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,895
So, tell me...

692
00:52:02,762 --> 00:52:04,728
You said you were looking for answers.

693
00:52:06,794 --> 00:52:08,760
Yeah, um...

694
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:11,898
I'm actually not sure how much you'll be able to
help us.

695
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:14,093
My girlfriend, Ada, grew up here...

696
00:52:15,493 --> 00:52:20,448
We're trying to find out if anything weird or bad
happened to her when she was a kid.

697
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:22,089
So, we drove up from Austin...

698
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:24,018
I don't know, to...

699
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,449
Visit, or whatever.

700
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,519
And... I don't really know.

701
00:52:28,258 --> 00:52:30,224
She lived here.

702
00:52:30,458 --> 00:52:32,321
She left.

703
00:52:34,056 --> 00:52:36,022
And she came back?

704
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,854
Yeah, is that...

705
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,213
Is that weird?

706
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:41,455
Marlow...

707
00:52:41,488 --> 00:52:43,012
Hunny...

708
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,087
Please... Give us a moment, okay?

709
00:52:49,287 --> 00:52:51,253
<i>I'm sorwngo on.</i>

710
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,786
Uh...

711
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:56,290
Things have actually been pretty weird since we got
here.

712
00:52:56,586 --> 00:52:58,551
The house that she grew up in is gone.

713
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:02,182
And, I got threatened at a gas station.

714
00:53:02,452 --> 00:53:04,145
And, and...

715
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,116
Found this outside of the post office.

716
00:53:11,117 --> 00:53:13,082
Some kind of ancient coin.

717
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:15,250
That's not a normal thing to find outside of a post
office, right?

718
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,847
That's not a normal thing to find outside of a post
office, right?

719
00:53:45,377 --> 00:53:47,343
You know...

720
00:53:49,043 --> 00:53:51,008
People come here to die.

721
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:54,175
I don't know why.

722
00:53:55,642 --> 00:53:57,472
Whether they've been here before or not...

723
00:53:57,742 --> 00:53:59,265
They show up on my door step...

724
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:02,740
Or, they...

725
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,173
Wander into the woods.

726
00:54:07,473 --> 00:54:09,439
And...

727
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,067
It's my job...

728
00:54:13,305 --> 00:54:14,771
To see them through.

729
00:54:15,905 --> 00:54:17,837
So...

730
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:24,703
How are you gonna do it?

731
00:54:27,036 --> 00:54:28,900
Um...

732
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:30,134
I'm sorry...

733
00:54:30,135 --> 00:54:31,226
Do what?

734
00:54:34,935 --> 00:54:36,900
Kill yourself.

735
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,366
It's alright.

736
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,897
It's okay.

737
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:46,291
It's nothing to be afraid of.

738
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:49,144
Something much bigger than you brought you
here, boy.

739
00:54:51,699 --> 00:54:53,665
Here.

740
00:54:57,131 --> 00:54:59,096
How about you go ahead and keep that?

741
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:12,661
Calvin, we need to go.

742
00:55:17,428 --> 00:55:19,393
This place is so fucking crazy.

743
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,526
He just asked me how I was gonna kill myself.

744
00:55:23,759 --> 00:55:25,725
Hey!

745
00:55:26,059 --> 00:55:27,923
Are y'all coming to service later?

746
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,715
Probably not.

747
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,423
Great! See you there!

748
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:35,456
This is the part where we say "fuck the plans“ and
bail, right?

749
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:37,555
Yes...

750
00:55:38,057 --> 00:55:39,921
I'm sorry. I am very sorry.

751
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,519
I don't know why we came here.

752
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:47,753
Let's just go by, say "goodbye" to your Aunt and go back to
Austin and forget any of this ever fucking happened to us, okay?

753
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:48,554
<i>This fina.</i>

754
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:49,887
That's awesome.

755
00:55:52,788 --> 00:55:54,754
What the fuck?

756
00:56:19,683 --> 00:56:20,979
I'm sorry.

757
00:56:21,216 --> 00:56:22,738
Aunt Lindsay, what the fuck?!

758
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:24,777
You shouldn't talk to me like that!

759
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:28,579
Who cares how I fucking talk to you.

760
00:56:28,848 --> 00:56:29,542
You just tried to stab my boyfriend... and my car?

761
00:56:29,781 --> 00:56:31,747
I thought he was you Uncle Davis.

762
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:34,445
Why is the car on fire?!

763
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:36,237
What did Davis do to you?

764
00:56:36,713 --> 00:56:38,679
Nothing.

765
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:40,976
He just... He was just...

766
00:56:41,246 --> 00:56:43,042
A little bit upset.

767
00:56:44,345 --> 00:56:46,343
Doesn't like Calvin staying here. He saw Calvin...

768
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,808
Is he here now?

769
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:50,477
No, I don't know... He...

770
00:56:51,844 --> 00:56:53,810
He left. He's out.

771
00:56:55,777 --> 00:56:57,640
So, what... He just beats the shit out of you?

772
00:56:57,909 --> 00:56:59,432
Is that how this works?

773
00:56:59,709 --> 00:57:00,903
It was my fault.

774
00:57:03,242 --> 00:57:05,207
She brought evil into our house.

775
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:08,145
This is bullshit. I'm calling someone and getting out
of here.

776
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:27,236
Mom?

777
00:57:27,904 --> 00:57:29,869
Mom, hello?

778
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,534
It's me. I'm in Sheol.

779
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:35,133
I'm at Aunt Lindsay's, and...

780
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:36,664
Hello?

781
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:40,201
Mom, can you hear me?

782
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:49,133
Aunt Lindsay, I need to use your phone.

783
00:57:53,666 --> 00:57:55,530
I don't have a phone.

784
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:56,425
What?

785
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:57,817
Why don't you have a phone?!

786
00:57:59,665 --> 00:58:01,631
Everybody that I need to talk to...

787
00:58:02,731 --> 00:58:04,594
Everyone that I'm supposed to talk to...

788
00:58:04,864 --> 00:58:06,557
Is already here.

789
00:58:09,397 --> 00:58:11,261
Ada, we have got to go.

790
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,017
The car?

791
00:58:13,262 --> 00:58:15,058
Seriously, we have to go now!

792
00:58:22,494 --> 00:58:24,460
Davis... and Daddy...

793
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:51,555
I'm gonna find you two.

794
00:58:52,489 --> 00:58:54,455
You can run, but you damn sure can't hide.

795
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:13,618
I know y'all are around here somewhere.

796
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:16,817
I heard you.

797
00:59:19,818 --> 00:59:21,783
Ada?

798
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,138
You know it's not safe to be out in these woods.

799
00:59:30,582 --> 00:59:33,538
I know I told your mama to tell you about that when
you were a little girl.

800
00:59:34,381 --> 00:59:36,245
You know this is not the place to be.

801
00:59:36,514 --> 00:59:37,513
Y'all come on out.

802
00:59:40,147 --> 00:59:42,112
Come on now.

803
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,346
I just wanna talk!

804
01:00:13,641 --> 01:00:15,607
What about your phone?

805
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,917
My phone's been dead since last night. I didn't even
think about it.

806
01:00:21,807 --> 01:00:23,738
Ada, wait!

807
01:00:24,806 --> 01:00:26,772
They probably have a phone!

808
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:28,937
They don't have a phone.

809
01:00:29,172 --> 01:00:31,036
No on here has a phone.

810
01:00:31,304 --> 01:00:32,303
Alright?

811
01:00:33,837 --> 01:00:35,701
We are in fucking Hell.

812
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,800
Okay?

813
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:39,933
They have to place orders and things.

814
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:41,841
If anyone has a phone, they have a phone.

815
01:00:44,536 --> 01:00:46,400
They pulled a gun on me last time I was in there for
no reason.

816
01:00:46,668 --> 01:00:47,862
Just for showing up.

817
01:00:48,135 --> 01:00:48,726
What, seriously?!

818
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:50,933
Yes, I...

819
01:00:52,534 --> 01:00:55,292
I didn't want to tell you last night because you were
already upset...

820
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,764
About the sex thing.

821
01:00:58,033 --> 01:00:59,158
So...

822
01:00:59,399 --> 01:01:01,229
Why wouldn't you tell me that?!

823
01:01:05,231 --> 01:01:07,197
Look, I'm just going to...

824
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:09,495
Go buy us some waters, make a phone call...

825
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:11,491
And come right back. You can stay here.

826
01:01:13,897 --> 01:01:15,761
Here.

827
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:17,723
Calvin..

828
01:01:18,862 --> 01:01:21,020
The only way I'm letting you go in that gas station...

829
01:01:21,029 --> 01:01:22,960
Is if you take this with you.

830
01:02:16,485 --> 01:02:18,349
Excuse me...

831
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:20,083
Can I help you with something?

832
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:21,977
Oh, I was just going to get a water--

833
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,741
I know what you're doing!

834
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:25,779
I know what you're doing in here!

835
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:27,695
You want to bring this evil into my store!

836
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:35,979
Ada!

837
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,011
Get the fuck off of her!

838
01:02:39,149 --> 01:02:41,012
Are you okay?

839
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:42,441
Fuck, shit!

840
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:01,910
Get the fuck out of the way!

841
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:21,973
Are you okay?

842
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,903
This is so fucked. I just stabbed somebody!

843
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:27,503
Yeah, well...

844
01:03:27,773 --> 01:03:29,739
You're gonna have to stab somebody else...

845
01:03:30,272 --> 01:03:32,270
If these assholes don't stop fucking following us!

846
01:04:39,826 --> 01:04:41,792
Shit.

847
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:44,592
Ada...

848
01:04:45,692 --> 01:04:47,658
Ada, we have to go back to the church.

849
01:04:50,024 --> 01:04:51,990
If I just close my eyes...

850
01:04:53,591 --> 01:04:56,148
And open them again, I will be home and all of this
will be gone.

851
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:02,233
It's the only place in this town where somebody
hasn't tried to kill us, okay?

852
01:05:03,323 --> 01:05:05,288
Just far away.

853
01:05:07,489 --> 01:05:09,454
Or, maybe he did try to kill us?

854
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:12,752
I don't know... But I know those people...

855
01:05:14,587 --> 01:05:16,451
Will not kill us inside the church.

856
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:17,982
Okay?

857
01:05:18,753 --> 01:05:20,719
It didn't work.

858
01:05:21,853 --> 01:05:23,716
If we stay out here, we are going to die.

859
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:25,863
If we stay in these woods, we are going to die.

860
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:27,541
It didn't work.

861
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:30,117
It didn't work.

862
01:05:30,617 --> 01:05:32,583
It never does.

863
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:40,881
Do you remember which way the church is?

864
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:47,114
If the gas station is over there...

865
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:50,913
Then, the church should be...

866
01:06:00,178 --> 01:06:02,144
Fuck.

867
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:05,410
Meet me there.

868
01:06:06,344 --> 01:06:08,310
Meet me there.

869
01:06:10,844 --> 01:06:12,842
Where the Tree of Life is blooming, meet me there.

870
01:06:16,509 --> 01:06:18,475
When the storms of life are over.

871
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,541
On the happy golden shore.

872
01:06:23,008 --> 01:06:24,973
Where the faithful part no more, meet me there.

873
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:29,573
Here are fondest hopes are vain.

874
01:06:30,973 --> 01:06:32,939
Dearest links are rent and twain.

875
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,705
But, in Heaven no throb of pain, meet me there.

876
01:06:40,938 --> 01:06:42,904
By the river sparkling bright.

877
01:06:43,938 --> 01:06:45,904
In the city of delight.

878
01:06:49,503 --> 01:06:51,469
Where our faith is lost in sight, meet me there.

879
01:06:53,403 --> 01:06:55,266
Hello?!

880
01:06:55,502 --> 01:06:56,501
Woodward!

881
01:06:57,968 --> 01:06:59,832
Woodward!

882
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:01,259
Hello?

883
01:07:01,501 --> 01:07:02,626
Anyone?!

884
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,566
Fellowship hall?

885
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:48,392
Woodward?

886
01:08:06,956 --> 01:08:08,820
Ada, I don't think this is the...

887
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:10,767
I don't think this is the fellowship hall!

888
01:08:44,649 --> 01:08:46,479
What's going on in here?

889
01:08:46,749 --> 01:08:47,772
Y'all okay?

890
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,413
Y'all can't stay here.

891
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:04,296
You're not gonna be any safer. You're only putting
me in danger.

892
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:07,778
Where are we supposed to go?

893
01:09:09,878 --> 01:09:11,742
No one has a phone. We're a hundred miles from
anywhere.

894
01:09:11,977 --> 01:09:13,410
Preacher Woodard...

895
01:09:14,977 --> 01:09:16,942
Earlier, we saw your daughter in the graveyard...

896
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,776
Is she okay?

897
01:09:27,542 --> 01:09:29,508
Everybody here makes sacrifices for their safety.

898
01:09:30,874 --> 01:09:32,840
What are we supposed to do?

899
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:36,740
I'll tell you what you're supposed to do, you're here
to die!

900
01:09:39,972 --> 01:09:41,938
The only way to live is to escape.

901
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,937
Or, to stay here... and leave.

902
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:49,303
I don't know what you do here...

903
01:09:49,937 --> 01:09:51,869
But it has nothing to do with us.

904
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,399
Please.

905
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:04,401
I can show you a way out.

906
01:10:06,867 --> 01:10:08,833
But, it's a long walk through them woods.

907
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:12,066
But, you...

908
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,766
Can never come back here, ever!

909
01:10:16,366 --> 01:10:18,332
Not to this world.

910
01:10:19,566 --> 01:10:21,531
Thank you.

911
01:10:26,564 --> 01:10:28,530
Where are we going?

912
01:10:28,898 --> 01:10:30,863
Well, Calvin, see that creek up there?

913
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,862
We're gonna come to this creek...

914
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,529
You gotta be quiet.

915
01:10:36,396 --> 01:10:38,361
This is as far as I can take you.

916
01:10:39,395 --> 01:10:41,361
Once we get to this creek...

917
01:10:41,595 --> 01:10:43,458
Listen to me.

918
01:10:43,728 --> 01:10:44,727
Very important.

919
01:10:45,394 --> 01:10:47,258
You keep walking through them woods...

920
01:10:47,528 --> 01:10:49,049
About a mile or two.

921
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,224
You're gonna come to a road.

922
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,051
And, whatever you do...

923
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:57,555
Make sure you look for somebody headed west.

924
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:58,791
Not east.

925
01:11:00,558 --> 01:11:02,524
And hope they stop, and that they're kind.

926
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:07,823
How do you know this path?

927
01:11:10,123 --> 01:11:12,160
Well, Ada, we baptize folks down here in the creek.

928
01:11:13,556 --> 01:11:15,544
Most times they come back with.

929
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,821
Other times...

930
01:11:20,621 --> 01:11:22,485
The Lord just... takes them away.

931
01:11:22,754 --> 01:11:24,220
Takes them away?

932
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:25,715
Yeah.

933
01:11:26,254 --> 01:11:28,220
In one way or another.

934
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,352
I don't remember being baptized.

935
01:11:32,585 --> 01:11:34,415
Well...

936
01:11:34,686 --> 01:11:36,049
If you were...

937
01:11:37,718 --> 01:11:39,684
It was here.

938
01:11:40,518 --> 01:11:42,109
I don't think I was.

939
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,314
I've had enough of this shit!

940
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:47,912
Stop!

941
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,780
Stay, Calvin!

942
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:52,538
No!

943
01:11:52,783 --> 01:11:54,044
Get off of her!

944
01:11:54,581 --> 01:11:56,513
In the name of The Father...

945
01:11:56,748 --> 01:11:57,941
The Son...

946
01:11:58,214 --> 01:11:58,839
And the Holy Spirit...

947
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,513
Stop now!

948
01:12:00,747 --> 01:12:02,235
Get the fuck off of her!

949
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,704
How far did he say the road is gonna be?

950
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:42,531
Like a mile or two?

951
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:43,772
But...

952
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:45,834
Why should we believe anything he said?

953
01:12:48,205 --> 01:12:50,171
Shhhh!

954
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,170
Where the fuck have we been walking?

955
01:13:55,227 --> 01:13:57,193
Ada...

956
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,025
The town is that way.

957
01:14:01,326 --> 01:14:03,315
So, if we go this way...

958
01:14:03,592 --> 01:14:05,558
To our left, we will be out of here.

959
01:14:06,891 --> 01:14:08,823
Does that make sense to you?

960
01:14:10,924 --> 01:14:12,787
Ada, does that make sense?

961
01:14:13,057 --> 01:14:14,376
I don't know where the fuck I am!

962
01:14:15,523 --> 01:14:17,489
Ada!

963
01:14:18,423 --> 01:14:20,287
Fuck it, come on!

964
01:14:20,555 --> 01:14:21,919
Come on!

965
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:39,552
Ada, I don't know what we're doing.

966
01:14:40,085 --> 01:14:42,051
I don't either.

967
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:48,284
Are you tired?

968
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,016
I am so tired.

969
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:58,881
What if we just...

970
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:01,114
Spend the night out here?

971
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,880
Rest.

972
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:07,180
Sleep if we can.

973
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:15,696
Not in these fucking woods with these fucking
crazy people, Ada.

974
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:18,478
We aren't... in the woods.

975
01:15:27,844 --> 01:15:29,708
You still got the knife, right?

976
01:15:29,976 --> 01:15:31,601
<i>Mmmm hmmmnm.</i>

977
01:15:36,643 --> 01:15:38,608
And, I've got this.

978
01:15:41,575 --> 01:15:43,405
Maybe...

979
01:15:43,674 --> 01:15:45,434
Wejust...

980
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:48,539
Sit here for as long as we can.

981
01:15:51,072 --> 01:15:52,936
And if anything...

982
01:15:53,206 --> 01:15:54,467
Comes out of the woods...

983
01:15:54,705 --> 01:15:55,967
We'll just...

984
01:15:59,372 --> 01:16:01,337
We'll just do what we're supposed to do, right?

985
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:07,859
Cal, I'm really sorry.

986
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:13,035
You don't have to be sorry.

987
01:16:14,669 --> 01:16:16,532
I am. I'm sorry about...

988
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:17,800
Everything.

989
01:16:20,668 --> 01:16:22,633
I love you.

990
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,966
And I want you. I really want you.

991
01:16:30,132 --> 01:16:31,996
It's just something just happens...

992
01:16:32,232 --> 01:16:34,062
It goes wrong.

993
01:16:36,998 --> 01:16:38,826
And I don't know...

994
01:16:39,064 --> 01:16:40,894
What to say...

995
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:43,027
How to explain it...

996
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:44,626
I'm sorry.

997
01:16:46,396 --> 01:16:48,385
I want you, too.

998
01:16:50,895 --> 01:16:52,759
Every d3)'-

999
01:16:53,028 --> 01:16:54,495
Every hour.

1000
01:16:55,362 --> 01:16:57,327
Every second of every day since I met you.

1001
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:01,425
I have never wanted anybody else.

1002
01:17:01,693 --> 01:17:02,784
Even

1003
01:17:03,127 --> 01:17:05,092
I know.

1004
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:11,124
I'm sorry.

1005
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:13,757
You have nothing to be sorry for.

1006
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:17,290
I do.

1007
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:22,523
I'm so terrified of you all of the time.

1008
01:17:25,289 --> 01:17:27,255
Terrified that you'll get hurt.

1009
01:17:28,389 --> 01:17:30,377
Terrified that you'll leave me.

1010
01:17:34,721 --> 01:17:36,585
I'm terrified that one day you'll wake up...

1011
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:38,718
And roll over and look at me...

1012
01:17:39,487 --> 01:17:41,452
And just think "what the fuck was I doing?!“

1013
01:17:42,986 --> 01:17:44,952
And then you'll just leave.

1014
01:17:48,218 --> 01:17:50,150
I wouldn't.

1015
01:17:50,385 --> 01:17:52,249
I would never leave you.

1016
01:17:52,784 --> 01:17:54,750
You saved me.

1017
01:17:58,184 --> 01:18:00,149
I can't believe I did that.

1018
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,515
Notjust then.

1019
01:18:04,782 --> 01:18:06,747
You never gave up on me.

1020
01:18:07,815 --> 01:18:09,781
And, that's why...

1021
01:18:11,981 --> 01:18:13,947
I'm sitting here holding a knife...

1022
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:16,112
In the middle of fucking Oklahoma...

1023
01:18:17,779 --> 01:18:19,937
And I'm gonna stab the shit out of anything that
moves!

1024
01:18:24,145 --> 01:18:26,111
That's all I've ever wanted in a girlfriend.

1025
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,276
Everything is going to be okay.

1026
01:18:38,942 --> 01:18:40,908
Everything is going to be okay.

1027
01:20:11,693 --> 01:20:13,659
Ada, come here.

1028
01:20:15,925 --> 01:20:17,891
Go ahead and pick out something.

1029
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,816
This is what it's like to be baptized.

1030
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,283
Let me show you again.

1031
01:21:08,449 --> 01:21:10,313
That's a good girl.

1032
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:12,104
Now, let's get you clean.

1033
01:21:17,281 --> 01:21:19,246
Oh, yeah, well all you do is drink!

1034
01:21:20,113 --> 01:21:21,977
Well, that's the only thing I gotta do because I gotta
put up with you!

1035
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:23,677
Always excuses!

1036
01:21:27,979 --> 01:21:29,945
Why don't you look in the mirror once in a while?

1037
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:32,311
Get the fuck out!

1038
01:21:32,778 --> 01:21:34,744
You're always leaving!

1039
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,710
Don't need you now, you piece of shit!

1040
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:58,206
Ada, come here. Come here.

1041
01:22:00,273 --> 01:22:02,239
I want you to go upstairs and get your toys.

1042
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:05,639
We're gonna stay with some friends for a little while
in Mansfield.

1043
01:22:05,972 --> 01:22:07,836
Maybe a long while.

1044
01:22:08,105 --> 01:22:09,264
Go one. Go get it.

1045
01:22:16,804 --> 01:22:18,667
Del!

1046
01:22:18,937 --> 01:22:19,936
Come back here!

1047
01:22:20,736 --> 01:22:22,725
You misunderstood me!

1048
01:22:24,602 --> 01:22:26,568
I would never hurt her.

1049
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,598
Whatever she said...

1050
01:22:29,834 --> 01:22:31,096
She's...

1051
01:25:37,767 --> 01:25:39,733
On the happy golden shore...

1052
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:42,533
Where the faithful part no more...

1053
01:25:45,066 --> 01:25:46,930
When the storms of life are over...

1054
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:48,721
Meet me there.

1055
01:25:52,265 --> 01:25:54,231
When the night dissolves away...

1056
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:57,997
Into pure and perfect day...

1057
01:25:59,764 --> 01:26:01,729
I am coming home to stay...

1058
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:04,529
Meet me there.

1059
01:26:06,029 --> 01:26:07,995
Meet me there.

1060
01:26:09,629 --> 01:26:11,595
Meet me there.

1061
01:26:14,761 --> 01:26:16,727
Where the Tree of Life is blooming...

1062
01:26:17,027 --> 01:26:18,993
Meet me there.

1063
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:24,425
Where the faithful part no more...

1064
01:26:26,192 --> 01:26:28,158
On the happy golden shore...

1065
01:26:30,791 --> 01:26:32,780
Where the storms of life are over...

1066
01:26:33,757 --> 01:26:35,723
Meet me there.

1067
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:00,052
My dad got it for us...

1068
01:27:00,553 --> 01:27:02,485
He had been gone for a while.

1069
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,651
And, he got it for us for Christmas.

1070
01:27:05,252 --> 01:27:07,218
I think he was trying to outdo my mother.

1071
01:27:09,551 --> 01:27:11,517
So, he got us this expensive thing.

1072
01:27:12,417 --> 01:27:14,406
And...

1073
01:27:15,184 --> 01:27:17,149
It was gigantic.

1074
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:22,580
He got it for both of us because he didn't know
either of us.

1075
01:27:24,449 --> 01:27:26,414
We were so happy.

1076
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:32,346
But then the longer I looked at it...

1077
01:27:33,614 --> 01:27:35,580
The more the happy went away.

1078
01:27:40,412 --> 01:27:42,344
And the more I just...

1079
01:27:42,578 --> 01:27:44,510
The bitterness...

1080
01:27:44,745 --> 01:27:46,710
I would have rather had my dad.

1081
01:27:55,343 --> 01:27:57,332
There's another one of me talking on a toy phone.

1082
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:03,885
My grandfather had gotten it for me for no
particular reason from K-Mart.

1083
01:28:06,075 --> 01:28:08,040
And, I used to pretend to call my dad...

1084
01:28:09,607 --> 01:28:11,573
Um...

1085
01:28:18,872 --> 01:28:21,110
I'm like four or five and I'm just smiling my ass off...

1086
01:28:21,872 --> 01:28:23,838
It's the stupidest toy.

1087
01:28:27,337 --> 01:28:29,303
The more I look at it...

1088
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,235
The more the smile faded...

1089
01:28:35,935 --> 01:28:37,924
I remembered...

1090
01:28:39,902 --> 01:28:42,334
My grandfather calling my mom a "bitch."

1091
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:43,897
And her...

1092
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:48,833
Driving me out of there and moving me to Texas.

1093
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:56,063
The only thing I can do to...

1094
01:28:56,332 --> 01:28:57,991
Remember to be happy...

1095
01:28:58,865 --> 01:29:00,831
Is to not think about it.

1096
01:29:02,231 --> 01:29:04,197
Never go back.

1097
01:29:10,829 --> 01:29:12,795
How do you feel now?

1098
01:29:13,195 --> 01:29:15,025
Good.

1099
01:29:15,262 --> 01:29:16,523
I think.

1100
01:29:18,528 --> 01:29:20,517
Good.

1101
01:29:23,228 --> 01:29:25,091
I'm not better. I'm still sad.

1102
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,190
And scared.

1103
01:29:29,526 --> 01:29:31,524
I don't know where I've been or where I'm going...

1104
01:29:32,092 --> 01:29:34,058
But I know it's going to be okay.

1105
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:37,558
Everything is going to be okay.

1106
01:29:42,057 --> 01:29:43,921
Excuse me for a second...

1107
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:45,519
I'm gonna go get a soda.

1108
01:29:45,756 --> 01:29:46,755
Do you want anything?

1109
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:48,819
A water, I guess.
