00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,101
[Radio Announcer]
It looks like the first
storm of the season

2
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:38,685
will be hitting us tonight,
and it's forecast
to be a big one.

3
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:40,894
Someone who doesn't
have to worry
about the weather

4
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:43,852
is our new President-Elect
William Jefferson Clinton,

5
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:45,602
or Bill,
as his friends call him,

6
00:00:45,626 --> 00:00:48,768
who is packing up
the Governor's mansion
in Little Rock, Arkansas,

7
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:50,810
and preparing
for his move
to the White House.

8
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:52,185
His wife Hillary
has already visited twice,

9
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:56,435
and is excited about
not only relocating
to Washington,

10
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:58,975
but also becoming
the new First Lady.

11
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,727
[Woman]
...number 11. So
color that one red.

12
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,310
There you go.
Just the number 11.

13
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:06,226
How many ones
in number 11?

14
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,226
[whispers] Two.

15
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,226
Two.

16
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,059
There you go.

17
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,209
Okay, just
the red, though.

18
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:21,975
I can't do it!
It's too small to fill in!

19
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,975
You're right, it is small,

20
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,310
But you can do it,
just go slowly.

21
00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:29,101
I can't. I tried.

22
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,560
You know the word "can't"
isn't in the dictionary?

23
00:01:32,584 --> 00:01:36,018
But I can't do it,
Mommy.

24
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:38,727
Do you know
what we're gonna do?

25
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,975
We're gonna get rid
of all those "can'ts".

26
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:42,852
Did you know
you could do that?

27
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

28
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:50,334
Okay, take
a deep breath.

29
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:54,975
Are you ready to blow
all the can'ts away?

30
00:01:54,999 --> 00:01:55,975
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:57,101
Do it.

32
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:59,000
[Mom blows a raspberry]

33
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:03,975
Did you see it?
They're going away.

34
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:04,975
There they go.

35
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,435
Adios.

36
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:11,185
Okay, now you can
do anything, right?

37
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,999
Right.
Right.

38
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,602
[doorbell rings]

39
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:17,852
It's Daddy!

40
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:18,975
Remember,
you have to clean up

41
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:22,584
and tidy everything away
before you can go.

42
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:30,560
Hey, Kris.

43
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,375
Quinn.

44
00:02:34,918 --> 00:02:36,268
Is the little man coming?

45
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,975
Yeah, he's putting
his paints away.

46
00:02:38,999 --> 00:02:40,768
Where are you
taking him this weekend?

47
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,185
Out on the boat,
like always.

48
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,226
No sailing.

49
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,435
There's a storm coming.

50
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,975
Okay, then we'll just
go down to the harbor.

51
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,393
We won't go out.

52
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:50,975
You promise me?

53
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:52,143
I've asked you
not to take him before.

54
00:02:52,167 --> 00:02:54,018
He told me
you went sailing anyway.

55
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,852
You know how much
he loves it.

56
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,059
It isn't safe, Quinn.

57
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,876
Okay, I promise.

58
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:04,268
I wish you'd have
tried to like the boat
a little bit.

59
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,975
[derisive laugh]

60
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:08,101
When was I supposed
to find time to do that?

61
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:09,560
I was raising a child,
going to school.

62
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:10,768
I didn't have
much time to play.

63
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:13,310
I'm not
talking about play.

64
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,310
You know, I bought
the boat for business.

65
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:18,727
That's why, you know,
I've got that dive shop
in the Keys.

66
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:19,975
For both of us.

67
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,143
Exactly.

68
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,685
You run off
and buy something

69
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,894
on the other side
of the country...

70
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,518
We talked
about that for years.

71
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,602
That was before
I had a child
to think about.

72
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,852
Well, I am thinking
about the child.

73
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,518
It's a great place
to raise a kid.
The Keys are beautiful.

74
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,768
Then I hope
you enjoy yourself,

75
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,751
but you're not
taking my son.

76
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,310
It could've been
so perfect.

77
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:47,768
I mean, you,
you could've gotten your
law degree in Miami,

78
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:49,310
open a practice
in the Keys.

79
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:51,935
Weekends,
we could've just enjoyed
the sand and the sun--

80
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,083
Perfect for you.

81
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,018
That's not the way
you felt when we met.

82
00:03:58,042 --> 00:04:01,226
I was younger then.
It was exciting.

83
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,226
Huh. So then I got
out of the Navy

84
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,976
and it wasn't
exciting anymore?

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,393
This is going nowhere.

86
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:11,185
Take Mark for the weekend,
show him the boat.

87
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:12,935
Yeah, while I have it.

88
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,435
I don't want
your damn boat.

89
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,935
And what about
the money and the house?

90
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,975
Look, that is not
what this is about.

91
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:21,059
I wanted to be fair.

92
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,143
Fair?

93
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,143
I put you
through law school,

94
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:29,268
and now you have
your attorney buddies
gang up on me.

95
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,518
I can't even
go to the mailbox

96
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:32,768
without getting
some legal mumbo-jumbo

97
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:33,975
from one of
your lawyers.

98
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:36,727
Quinn, get yourself
a lawyer.

99
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:38,894
You can't
do this by yourself.

100
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:41,435
I don't want one, okay?
I want my family back.

101
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,602
I get my son
one weekend a month.

102
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:46,810
When it's final,
it'll be different.

103
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:48,975
Yeah, probably
won't get him at all.

104
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:49,999
No.

105
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,459
How did we
end up like this?

106
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,768
Maybe it's because
we're so different.

107
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,935
I mean, we always were.

108
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,999
Then why'd you marry me?

109
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,999
Because I loved you.

110
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:15,810
I have to ask you this.

111
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:18,018
Please, can we
work this out?

112
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:23,894
Just the two of us,
without all these lawyers
confusing everything?

113
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:25,852
Please?

114
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:26,975
Daddy!

115
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:30,975
Hey! Yar!
How are ya, my man?

116
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,852
How are ya,
there, sailor?

117
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,143
Feeling good, Captain.

118
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,975
Well, that's good to hear.

119
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:37,975
Now let's see
if we can find us

120
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,351
some pirates
in that harbor.

121
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,059
What do you say, huh?

122
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:45,083
So you never did
answer my question.

123
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,667
You know the answer.

124
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,852
Alrighty, then.

125
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,059
Let's me and you
go have us a good time, huh?

126
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,852
Bye, Markie-poo.

127
00:05:58,876 --> 00:06:00,975
Call me
before night-night.

128
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,894
I love you.

129
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:03,918
Bye, Mommy!

130
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,975
[Radio Announcer]
Thanks, Laura,
Stay safe out there.

131
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,518
This storm front
is really giving
L.A. a bashing.

132
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:25,268
Winds are strong,
at 60 miles an hour...

133
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:27,584
[telephone rings]

134
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:46,125
[telephone rings]

135
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,999
[telephone rings]

136
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,334
Quinn?

137
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,477
Who is this?

138
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,852
Grab what's loose
back there.

139
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:16,143
Right this way.
Let's go.

140
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:17,709
Come on. Bring it over.
Bring it over.

141
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:40,643
Kristen Halloran.

142
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,727
Hi, I'm the Harbor Master
Bill Sellers.

143
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,976
I'd like to thank for
driving down all this way

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,101
under these conditions.

145
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:49,101
They said this storm
was gonna slow down
when it crossed Baja,

146
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,351
but it must've picked up
some off-shore moisture--

147
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,975
Have you found the boat?

148
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:54,143
Uh, not yet.

149
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,975
As I told you
on the phone,

150
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,560
we received a distress call
from theOcean Dreamer
about 8:45.

151
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:01,268
That is your boat,
right?

152
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,268
My husband's.

153
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:04,975
We received
a second radio message

154
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:09,185
about 15 minutes after that.
This one was a mayday.

155
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,018
What did he say?

156
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:14,143
That they'd lost their mast
and were taking on water--

157
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,393
Where are they now?

158
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:17,268
That's why
we asked you to come in.

159
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:19,059
Do you know how many people

160
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:21,226
might've been aboard the boat
and where they were heading?

161
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,101
This would help us
with our search patterns.

162
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,768
You mean,
you haven't found them?

163
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,226
No, ma'am.

164
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,602
We've had
one of our cutters out
since we got the call.

165
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:34,185
Dana Point and Catalina
have also got boats
looking for them.

166
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:39,975
So, once again,
do you know who was onboard
and where they were heading?

167
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:45,351
My husband
Quinn Halloran

168
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,976
and my son Mark.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,101
And they were going?

170
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:55,018
I told him
not to take the boat.

171
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:57,125
He promised me.

172
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,894
Was he an experienced sailor?

173
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:03,935
6 years, ex-Navy.

174
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,894
As soon as
these winds abate,

175
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:07,975
we'll have the helicopters
up running search patterns.

176
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:08,975
That'll help us
in locating--

177
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,894
No, you can't wait.

178
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,685
You have to send
the helicopters up now.

179
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:15,477
That's impossible.
They can't fly in this.

180
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,602
No! My little boy
is out there!

181
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:20,975
I'm sorry.
I really am.

182
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:22,059
We're doing all we can.

183
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,975
[telephone ringing]

184
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,542
Excuse me.

185
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:31,459
Harbor Master.

186
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,935
Where was it?
Was there anyone aboard?

187
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,018
There was a young child
as well.

188
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,477
How old was your son?

189
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:44,101
4. He's 4.

190
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,018
A young boy,
4 years old,
plus the captain.

191
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:50,209
Yeah.

192
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,810
Please. Please, tell me
what they're saying. Please.

193
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:58,975
Please, Mrs. Halloran,
I know this is difficult.

194
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,667
Give me one minute.

195
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,268
I understand.

196
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:07,268
No, absolutely not.

197
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,143
Give it another six hours
before changing parameters.

198
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,975
I know that.

199
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,975
So keep it
search and rescue
until we lose the light.

200
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:20,375
I don't care about that.
I've got the mother
here with me.

201
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,435
They found the boat.
It was capsized
about 7 miles out.

202
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:35,101
There's no one onboard.

203
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:37,852
I've ordered them
to continue
the search patterns

204
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,685
for the rest of the day.

205
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,560
And then what?

206
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:46,685
Then...it becomes
a recovery operation.

207
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:48,852
What does that mean?

208
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:51,584
It means we've done
all we can...

209
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,083
and under
these conditions...

210
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:02,518
I wouldn't be honest if
I offered you much hope.

211
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:05,209
All we can do is pray,
Mrs. Halloran.

212
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,727
[beep]

213
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,935
[Bill Sellers]
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Halloran.

214
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,310
I really am,
but it's been three days

215
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,185
and we still
haven't found them.

216
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,975
With the conditions
the way they are,

217
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,602
there's no way
they could've survived.

218
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:45,935
I have to call off
the search.

219
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:47,542
[sobbing]

220
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:02,185
I think I look
particularly good there.

221
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:05,125
Oh, it's...
[laughs]

222
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:08,976
Oh, you have
to see this.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,727
It's good.
See?

224
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,226
[Man]
I love this.

225
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,143
Running on the beach,
and the horse is
liking the pressure.

226
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,852
[Woman]
Watch out
for that rock! Oh!

227
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:22,975
Well, that's
the end of tape two.
Wanna see more?

228
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:25,226
Okay, Steve,
you talked us into it.

229
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,101
The rest of our
Caribbean vacation
coming up.

230
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,435
And I used to think
slide shows were bad.

231
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,584
We've got slides.

232
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,518
Kristen, can we
make more popcorn?

233
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:35,727
Sure.

234
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,975
Popcorn and movies.
Can't beat it.

235
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,975
How are the kids?

236
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,435
Well, Josh is living
with his mother,

237
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:43,310
but I get blamed
for any trouble
he gets in.

238
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:47,852
Rachel's back at college.
We'll see how that goes.

239
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:49,143
I've got an idea.

240
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:53,226
How about
if you and Steve
join us next year?

241
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,477
Nothing crazy.
We don't have to go far.

242
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,935
Just drive up the coast.

243
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,643
That sounds lovely,
but it's really difficult

244
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,477
for Steve to take
time off work right now.

245
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,185
Things are rough, huh?

246
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,975
Has the thing
worked out with his son?

247
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,226
No, it's been
really hard on Steve.

248
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,975
Josh has
a preliminary hearing
at the end of the month.

249
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,685
Steve wants
to be there for him,

250
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,560
so he's gonna have
to take some more
time off work.

251
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,101
When it rains...

252
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:24,975
Have you thought about
taking a home-study course
and taking the bar?

253
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:28,101
You were so close
to becoming a lawyer.

254
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,101
People told me--

255
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:30,935
I was a different
person then.

256
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,852
Kristen, that person
is still inside you.

257
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:37,351
Mwah! Beer run, baby.

258
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,975
Hey, Steve,
I was just saying

259
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,768
how we should
take a weekend away,

260
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:44,393
just the four of us,
do a little wine tasting.

261
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,935
Will Ronnie video
the whole thing?

262
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,975
Yeah, only the good bits.

263
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,518
But we could
do it really cheap.

264
00:13:49,542 --> 00:13:51,975
I know this hotel in Napa,
it's less than 200 a night.

265
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,310
You know,
I'd love to, but--

266
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,768
Like I said, Marge,
Steve is super-busy
right now.

267
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,975
Yeah, I'm super-busy
getting beer
for everyone.

268
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,852
Okay.

269
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:07,685
How about we start slowly?
A day out, just you and me?

270
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,852
We'll stay local,
maybe get a facial,

271
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:15,018
and definitely go shopping.

272
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:16,975
[microwave timer rings]

273
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,975
Ah, popcorn.

274
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:23,975
Welcome back toRonnie's
Funniest Home Videos.

275
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,975
We'll be watching
as Marge forgets

276
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,852
to charge
the camera batteries,

277
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,268
and I become the Pirate
of the Caribbean.

278
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:31,975
[Marge]
He thinks
he's Johnny Depp.

279
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:34,935
[Ronnie, recorded]
And we're a gazillion miles
from L.A.

280
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,685
We're...where the hell
are we, Marge?

281
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:38,685
[Marge, recorded]
Santa...

282
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,477
Santa Alicia. Santa Alicia.

283
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:44,101
A tiny Caribbean island,

284
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,560
and in the spirit
of Christopher Columbus,

285
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,975
Sir Francis Drake,
and our little buddy Gilligan,

286
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,975
we are going
on a four-day cruise
and diving adventure.

287
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,393
I'm king of the world!

288
00:14:56,417 --> 00:14:59,351
Let's see if I can
find our captain.

289
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,393
Father and son
run this boat

290
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:04,226
and they are
both gorgeous.

291
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,477
[Ronnie]
They're not
that good-looking.

292
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:06,727
[Marge]
Yes, they are.
No.

293
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,602
Hello, yes they are.

294
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,542
Hey, Ronnie, why
does this green light flash?

295
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,101
And here's our
first mate Matthew.

296
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,101
Marge, point
the camera at Matthew.

297
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,792
Hey.

298
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,518
Say hello to our friends
back home, Matthew.

299
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:25,393
Hi.

300
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:27,351
So, uh, you're Canadian,
right?

301
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:28,435
Yes, sir.

302
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,143
So how many languages
do you speak?

303
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:33,477
English, German,
Spanish, and French.

304
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,602
And you know
what they call someone who
speaks foreign languages?

305
00:15:36,626 --> 00:15:38,351
Quadralingual.

306
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,560
Poor kid.

307
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:43,685
And you know what
they call someone that
only speaks one language?

308
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,643
I have no idea, sir.

309
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,310
American. Ha ha. Marge.

310
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:50,435
She does that
when I crack her up.

311
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:51,643
When I'm embarrassed.

312
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,975
That's all there is.

313
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:54,975
Marge forget
to charge the battery.

314
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:56,059
I didn't forget.

315
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,709
Okay, I forgot.

316
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,852
[Steve]
What is it?

317
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,292
My son.

318
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,459
He's alive.

319
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:17,334
Unbelievable.
Could this really be him?

320
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:21,101
Will you just
talk to me about this
for one minute?

321
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,226
There's nothing else
to talk about.

322
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,602
I'm going
to Santa Alicia.

323
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:26,226
Okay, but you can
just slow down?

324
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,268
There's no flights
to Santa Alicia tonight.

325
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:31,250
Then I'll take
the first flight out
in the morning.

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,560
You know, Marge said
it took them forever

327
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:35,560
to figure out
how to get there.

328
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,999
It's, like, a world away.

329
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,999
Are you absolutely
sure this is him?

330
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,975
There hasn't been
one minute in 14 years

331
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,518
that I haven't
thought about him--

332
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:53,560
what he might be like,
what he might've become.

333
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:55,894
You think I wouldn't
recognize him?

334
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:59,894
Look, I'm just trying
to be supportive here.

335
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:02,975
But I don't know
what to do.

336
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,602
How about I--
How about I call
the dive shop?

337
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:06,975
And say what?

338
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:09,975
He could run,
and I'll never see him.

339
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:11,268
Then let's call
the local police.

340
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:13,810
No. I don't know
what they might do,

341
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,268
what they might
say to him.

342
00:17:15,292 --> 00:17:19,042
Kristen, I'm worried
this might be
too much for you.

343
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:24,975
What am I supposed to do?

344
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:28,768
Stay crippled by my grief
for the rest of my life?

345
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,685
Is that what you want?
Is that who I am to you?

346
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,125
Of course not.

347
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:40,810
I have to do this.

348
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,852
Then let me
come with you--

349
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:45,685
after Josh's hearing.

350
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:49,643
I can't risk
losing him again.
I have to go now.

351
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,000
This is my chance.

352
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,709
This is our chance.

353
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,560
I really think
you should get
cancellation insurance

354
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,975
just in case Eduardo
interrupts your trip.

355
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,435
Who's he?

356
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,810
Eduardo is a tropical storm.

357
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,894
Hopefully, it'll stay
out in the Atlantic

358
00:18:12,918 --> 00:18:14,393
and not bother you,

359
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,685
but I would
get the insurance
just in case.

360
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:17,935
Yeah, we'll take it.

361
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,709
Good. I'll issue
the tickets.

362
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,518
So what's the plan
once you get there?

363
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,768
Bring him back.

364
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,685
He's 18.

365
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,018
Yeah, I was there when
he was born, remember?

366
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:35,310
I'm not trying to be smart,
I'm just trying to help.

367
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:36,852
Sorry, it's just--

368
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,768
That's okay.

369
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:40,351
How about Quinn?

370
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,894
What?
What do you mean?

371
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:44,268
Well, you might still
be married to him.

372
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm married to you.

373
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:46,975
But your divorce
was never finalized.

374
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:48,975
If he's alive...

375
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:51,810
You think
I want him back?

376
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:53,310
Absolutely not.

377
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:55,351
Here are your tickets
and your boarding passes.

378
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,059
And, inside, you'll find
your hotel confirmation.

379
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,268
And don't forget
your passport.

380
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:02,018
I don't
have a passport.

381
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:05,268
Oh. Well, then you
might not be able
to use these tickets.

382
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,101
Where can I
get a passport?

383
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,435
Go to the post office,
fill out a form,

384
00:19:09,459 --> 00:19:11,768
send it in with
a photograph and a check--

385
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,435
Well, that's too long.
This is an emergency.

386
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,268
Isn't there something else
my wife can use?

387
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:17,852
You have
a driver's license, right?

388
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:18,975
Yes.

389
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:20,975
Well, you can
get on the plane with that,

390
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:24,393
and if you bring along
your birth certificate,

391
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:25,976
that may get you
into Santa Alicia.

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,351
If not, will they
send her back?

393
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,351
Hopefully.

394
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,477
Hopefully?

395
00:19:31,501 --> 00:19:33,059
It's possible
they may hold her

396
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,351
for awhile in custody.

397
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,393
That's ridiculous.

398
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:37,125
Please, just
give me the tickets.

399
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,876
Taxi's on its way.

400
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:53,935
You can do this, Kris.
I believe in you.

401
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,894
What if he doesn't...

402
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,975
want to know me
when I meet him?

403
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:03,560
Your mother and you're--
you're a great mother.

404
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:05,310
I haven't
been a great mother

405
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,560
to your children,
Steve.

406
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:07,976
They've always
gone to their mom

407
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,351
when they've
needed anything.

408
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,975
It's not your fault.

409
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:15,185
Don't second-guess
yourself.

410
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:17,059
Sometimes things just--

411
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,602
they don't turn out
the way you hope.

412
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,351
Will this turn out
the way I hope?

413
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:26,268
[car horn honks]

414
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:27,727
Taxi's here.

415
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,435
You ready to do this?

416
00:20:30,459 --> 00:20:33,351
Yeah. Yes, I am.

417
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,685
Then no matter
what happens,

418
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,876
you have a family here
waiting for you to come home.

419
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,334
Thank you.

420
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,435
[Announcer]
Attention all passengers,

421
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:27,975
this is
the final boarding call

422
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,143
for inter-island
flight 101 to Santa Alicia.

423
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,477
Would all
transit passengers
for Santa Alicia

424
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:38,975
proceed immediately
to gate three?

425
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,975
[buzzer rings]

426
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:46,143
The final boarding call
for inter-island
flight 101 to Santa Alicia.

427
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:49,250
All passengers should
be onboard at this time.

428
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,643
[Quinn]
It could've
been so perfect.

429
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,975
Kristen, how did we
end up like this?

430
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:59,226
Can we work this out,
just the two of us

431
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,518
without, you know,
all these lawyers
confusing everything?

432
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:03,894
So you never did
answer my question.

433
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:06,643
Go ahead, take a peek.

434
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,059
Such beautiful
scenery out there.

435
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:11,975
It's a shame
to fly over it

436
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,518
and not see it
as the angels do.

437
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,918
Just go ahead.

438
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:24,477
It's breathtaking.
You're right.

439
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:26,975
But I'll feel happier
when we land.

440
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,918
You and me both,
sister.

441
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:36,975
Thank you.

442
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,125
You're welcome.
Next in line.

443
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,226
Do you have a passport?

444
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,999
No, I...I lost it.

445
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,975
We need some assistance
at desk two.

446
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,334
Possible illegal entry.

447
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,185
We called your husband
and he vouched for you.

448
00:23:09,209 --> 00:23:10,975
Can I go now?

449
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,975
Not that quickly.

450
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:15,685
We don't have anyone
to vouch for him.

451
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,185
He's just a phone number
you gave us.

452
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,975
He's my husband.

453
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:21,393
So you say.

454
00:23:21,417 --> 00:23:22,685
I also called the airline

455
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:23,852
and they don't
have a record

456
00:23:23,876 --> 00:23:26,018
of a passport
being left on the plane.

457
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,518
Maybe they haven't
found it yet.

458
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,975
Maybe.

459
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:35,976
Listen...Mrs. Collins?

460
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,768
We have rules and laws
that have to be followed,

461
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:42,643
just like in America.

462
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:44,101
What do you think
would happen to me

463
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:47,310
if I tried to enter
your country with this?

464
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,477
I don't know.

465
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:52,643
I do.
It's my job to know.

466
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:54,143
I would be
refused admission

467
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:55,768
and deported
at my own expense.

468
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:57,643
Well, it was
an accident
that I lost it

469
00:23:57,667 --> 00:23:59,185
and you have
my driver's license.

470
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:03,185
Do I look like
Budget Rent-A-Car to you?

471
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:04,894
I need a passport.

472
00:24:04,918 --> 00:24:07,393
Your license
and this can be bought
on any street corner

473
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:09,602
or printed up on any
home computer these days.

474
00:24:09,626 --> 00:24:12,018
And it's not even
a certified copy.

475
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,852
Please, you have to
let me in.

476
00:24:14,876 --> 00:24:19,459
I think my son is here,
and I haven't seen him
in so long.

477
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,935
Don't you have children?

478
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:28,852
Yes, I do. And my eldest
is away working.

479
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:30,602
I haven't seen him
in two years.

480
00:24:30,626 --> 00:24:34,501
Well, I haven't
seen my son in 14.

481
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:43,268
Okay.

482
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:44,975
We're a small island,

483
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,310
and we can bend the rules
from time to time,

484
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:50,435
so this is what
I'm prepared to do.

485
00:24:50,459 --> 00:24:52,351
You fill out
the lost passport form

486
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,268
and I'll submit it
to your local consulate.

487
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:58,935
Once filed, I'll admit you
into Santa Alicia for 48 hours,

488
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,059
during which time

489
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,935
you must report
to the local police officer

490
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,894
and have him
extend your visa.

491
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:08,643
Miss that deadline,
and I will come
and get you myself--

492
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:11,975
and I know
where you're staying.

493
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,975
Thank you.
I'll take care of it.

494
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:17,042
Good. And say hello
to your son for me.

495
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:23,975
Yes, ma'am?
Which hotel?

496
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,768
No, do you know
where Caribbean
Dive Adventures is?

497
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:27,768
Yes, I do.

498
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:28,999
Okay, good.

499
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:26,792
[sigh]

500
00:26:55,999 --> 00:26:56,975
G'day!

501
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:58,894
You're Kristen Collins,
right?

502
00:26:58,918 --> 00:27:00,975
The American lady
who got in last night?

503
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:01,975
Yeah.

504
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,976
Welcome to the islands
and to my hotel.

505
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,018
I'm Patrick.

506
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,643
Let's get you
a nice table, shall we?

507
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,435
I don't think
I'm going to
have breakfast.

508
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:10,852
I just wanted
to find someone

509
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:13,768
who might know something
about Caribbean
Dive Adventures.

510
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,226
Captain John's outfit?

511
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,018
His boat, thePhoenix,
is the busiest on the island.

512
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:20,226
They have a dive shop
not too far away from here.

513
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,975
I went there last night.

514
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,518
There was a sign saying
they were closed
until Wednesday.

515
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,643
They're probably out
on a charter, then.

516
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:28,643
Lucky for you
they weren't closed up
for the season.

517
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,226
A lot of folks already are.

518
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,975
You're not gonna hook up
with them today so...

519
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,999
let's get you that table
and start the morning off right.

520
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,018
Come on.

521
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,435
Well, I haven't
eaten in awhile.

522
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:43,852
You'll like this--

523
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:45,226
a lovely view of the beach.

524
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,226
It's right up here.

525
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,018
See?

526
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,852
This suit your fancy?

527
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:52,018
You're
not from around here.

528
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:53,852
Me, no.
I'm from all over,

529
00:27:53,876 --> 00:27:55,643
but originally from Oz.

530
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:56,852
Australia?

531
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,226
That's a long way
from the Caribbean.

532
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,852
Yeah, it makes for
a hell of a commute
in the morning.

533
00:28:00,876 --> 00:28:02,226
Nah, I'm just
joshing with you.

534
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,852
I've been here
for six years now.

535
00:28:03,876 --> 00:28:05,852
Let me get you
an orange juice.

536
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:06,976
Where are you from?

537
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,018
California.

538
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:09,059
I know it well.

539
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,852
Used to work
on a cruise line

540
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:12,975
that sailed out
at San Pedro
and down to Mazatlan.

541
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:16,018
But my favorite place
in all of California,

542
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,852
it's Malibu.

543
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:19,018
You ever go there?

544
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,435
Yeah, I've been there.

545
00:28:20,459 --> 00:28:23,226
That surf is almost
as good as back home,

546
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,018
and the birds
are amazing.

547
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,435
There's something
about an Aussie accent

548
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,918
that works wonders
with an American girl.

549
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:32,975
Huh.

550
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,852
[Man]
Stack them all over there!

551
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:36,975
What are they doing?

552
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,268
They're getting ready
to board up

553
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,975
in case we get any
weather coming through.

554
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,975
After what happened
last year,

555
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:43,975
the folks around here
don't want to take
any chances.

556
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:44,975
You had a bad storm?

557
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,435
No, we were fortunate.

558
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:47,975
Ivan just grazed us.

559
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:50,435
But other places
weren't so lucky.

560
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:51,975
It's gonna
be days at least

561
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:54,351
until we get any
weather coming in,
if we do at all.

562
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:56,018
Until then,
it's going to be
just like this--

563
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:59,018
clear, sunny.

564
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:02,643
Tell me some more
about Captain John
and his son.

565
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:05,643
They're good people,
and that boy Matthew,

566
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,018
he is shaping up
to be a real heartbreaker

567
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:11,268
with the holiday girls
that come here
during the season.

568
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,643
He's giving me
some stiff competition.

569
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,435
Now, see if there's something
that catches your eye.

570
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,975
My tip is the eggs Benedict.

571
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,975
They are the most wicked
thing on this island,

572
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,209
apart from me, of course.

573
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:33,477
[telephone rings]

574
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:34,727
Hello?

575
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:35,975
[operator]
Miss Collins?
Yes, it is.

576
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:36,975
Your call.
Thank you.

577
00:29:36,999 --> 00:29:38,768
[Steve on telephone]
Hey, honey.

578
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,643
Thanks for calling
me back, Steve.

579
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:42,894
These hotel phone calls
cost a fortune.

580
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:44,185
That's okay.

581
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:46,643
I was so worried when I heard
from immigration yesterday.

582
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:48,435
I have to report
to the local police

583
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,643
if I'm gonna stay.

584
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:50,852
And are you?

585
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,435
I have to.
I found their shop.

586
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,018
But they're
off the island.

587
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,876
They'll
be back in two days.

588
00:29:58,459 --> 00:29:59,975
Thanks for watching my back.

589
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,643
It's worth watching.

590
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,975
So now Rachael's in trouble.

591
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,143
She was called down
to the Dean's office.

592
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:08,268
Why?

593
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:11,393
Same as before--
drinking, boys.

594
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:14,435
How about Josh?

595
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,810
He's doing his best.

596
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:16,975
He's scared about
what might happen

597
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,226
when he goes to court.

598
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,643
Tell him not to worry.

599
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:22,226
Just make sure he
dresses appropriately,

600
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:24,643
and have him listen
to the judge,

601
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,975
and the most he'll get
is a few hours
of community service.

602
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:31,435
I'll tell him. Thanks.

603
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:33,435
How are you doing?

604
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,435
Good.

605
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:35,435
Really?

606
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:36,975
Yeah.

607
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:37,975
Good.

608
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:40,101
You call me
if you need anything.

609
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:43,226
I will.

610
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,477
I love you, Steve.

611
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:45,477
I love you, too.

612
00:30:45,501 --> 00:30:47,810
Always have,
always will.

613
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:48,810
You be careful.

614
00:30:48,834 --> 00:30:50,042
Okay.

615
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:37,999
[lock clatters]

616
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:04,042
Hello!

617
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,584
Anyone on board?

618
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:26,226
Hey, American lady!
Kristen!

619
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,226
It's me, Patrick,
from the hotel, remember?

620
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,268
Where you going?

621
00:32:30,292 --> 00:32:32,477
The boat's back.
Have you seen them?

622
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,435
Well, I'll tell you what.

623
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,975
Instead of us
yelling at each other,

624
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:38,727
why don't you come up
for a drink

625
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:40,018
and I'll see
if I can figure out

626
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,417
which boat
you're talking about.

627
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,226
Seems like I'm always
showing you to a table.

628
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,975
Now you're gonna
have to tell me

629
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:54,852
what boat
you're talking about.

630
00:32:54,876 --> 00:32:56,852
Captain John's,
thePhoenix.

631
00:32:56,876 --> 00:32:58,435
Yeah.

632
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,852
It was parked on the, uh...

633
00:33:00,876 --> 00:33:02,226
The dock.
Yeah.

634
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,435
Yeah?

635
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,435
But it wasn't due back
until tomorrow.

636
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,101
He probably came back
for Junkanoo.

637
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,143
What's that?

638
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,018
Junkanoo.
That's a carnival.

639
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:11,435
It starts at sundown.

640
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:12,976
Everyone on the island's
going to be there.

641
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,059
Everyone?
Everyone.

642
00:33:15,083 --> 00:33:16,727
If they're back,
they'll be there.

643
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:18,143
Where is it?

644
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:19,643
It's a street festival,
so it's everywhere.

645
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,852
It's up and down.

646
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,643
I'll tell you what,
I'll take you,

647
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,393
but first
you have to tell me,
what's your poison?

648
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:27,101
What?
Your poison.

649
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,768
What are you drinking?

650
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:29,975
Oh, no, thanks.

651
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:32,351
If you want me to
take you to Junkanoo,

652
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,685
you have to let me
buy you a drink.

653
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:36,143
It's the local custom.

654
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,101
Come on.
We got an hour to kill.

655
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:43,310
Maybe I can tempt you
with the finest brew
known to man.

656
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:44,602
I don't drink beer.

657
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:45,810
Wine it is.

658
00:33:45,834 --> 00:33:47,810
Melvin, can you bring me
a glass of red wine

659
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:48,975
for the lady?

660
00:33:48,999 --> 00:33:50,685
You know,
you're kind of different

661
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:52,810
from the regular tourists
that we get here.

662
00:33:52,834 --> 00:33:54,393
For start,
you're an American,

663
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,602
and we get mostly
Europeans.

664
00:33:56,626 --> 00:33:59,976
Plus, I noticed on your hand
you got a wedding ring,

665
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,143
but you're traveling
alone.

666
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,975
So what's that about?

667
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:05,810
My husband couldn't make it.

668
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:06,975
I see.

669
00:34:06,999 --> 00:34:07,975
Your husband
couldn't make it.

670
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:08,976
So you're here alone,

671
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,602
slap in the middle
of hurricane season...

672
00:34:11,626 --> 00:34:13,685
you sure you're not here
for something else?

673
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,975
Like what?

674
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:17,975
Like finding a man,

675
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:19,685
looking to get
your groove back?

676
00:34:19,709 --> 00:34:21,975
No, I'm not looking
to get my groove back.

677
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:23,185
[scoffs]

678
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:25,417
[Man]
Red wine for the lady.

679
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,810
Cheers.

680
00:34:30,834 --> 00:34:33,125
Are you always this...

681
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:36,417
persistent?

682
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,393
Business on the island
is quiet this time of year,

683
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:48,602
and there's a bunch
of bloody storms
out there already.

684
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:50,393
What do you do
when there are no tourists?

685
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:52,975
Some people work
on their shops

686
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,393
and some people
fix their boats.

687
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:56,602
And some, like me,
just hang out

688
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:58,185
and talk the days
and nights away.

689
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,976
Now, your guy,
Captain John,

690
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,810
he set up
a lifesaving program
in the local schools,

691
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:04,976
and his teaching
has probably saved,

692
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,810
like, 20 kids over
the last couple of years,

693
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,810
so everyone
on the island loves him.

694
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:11,101
He's better in the water
than I am,

695
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:12,810
and that's saying something.

696
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:14,810
[cheers, fireworks]

697
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:15,975
What is that?

698
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,250
Junkanoo's starting.

699
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,976
It's Fourth of July,
Caribbean style.

700
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,226
Everyone is here?

701
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,976
On one of these
streets, yeah.

702
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,185
I'm gonna look around.

703
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:35,501
For Captain John?

704
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:03,975
Quinn?
What?

705
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:06,626
Oh, I'm sorry.

706
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,501
All right.

707
00:36:22,334 --> 00:36:24,975
It's full of sweets
and candies for the kids

708
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,250
so they can break it open
like a piñata.

709
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,518
Here.

710
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:40,935
What is that?

711
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,059
It's a lucky charm.

712
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:45,542
Put it on
and make a wish.

713
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:56,334
[no audible dialogue]

714
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,125
[lock clatters]

715
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:04,643
Thanks for the lift.

716
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,042
I'll see you
when you get back.

717
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,018
[telephones ringing]

718
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:42,209
[sighs]

719
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:49,852
[Man]
Make sure you
check that out.

720
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,975
Can I help you?

721
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:52,975
Um...

722
00:38:52,999 --> 00:38:54,435
Can I help you?

723
00:38:54,459 --> 00:38:55,643
Are you all right?

724
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,852
You look like you've
just seen a ghost.

725
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:00,226
Are those for me?

726
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:02,018
Yeah, I have to get
my visa extended.

727
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,351
I didn't have
the right papers.

728
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,018
Ah, you're the lady
with the lost passport.

729
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:07,226
I've been expecting you.

730
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,709
Sit down, please.

731
00:39:10,999 --> 00:39:13,810
Immigration sent over
your papers.

732
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:18,852
So you filed
a lost passport form
at the U.S. consulate,

733
00:39:18,876 --> 00:39:24,143
and your birth certificate
isn't a certified copy?

734
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:28,935
I think we can
let it slide this once.

735
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:31,643
You don't look
like a spy to me.

736
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,351
But if you're gonna be
doing much traveling--

737
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,685
No, I'm not. Just here.

738
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,852
Fine, then I'll sign
an extension for you.

739
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,059
Is two weeks long enough?

740
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,975
Yeah, it should be.

741
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,643
Okay.

742
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,250
Make a copy of this
for my files.

743
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:54,852
I'll let you know
what the consulate says

744
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,685
when I hear back from them.

745
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:58,018
I'd like
to stamp it for you,

746
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,975
but we're out of ink.

747
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:02,852
My friend's picking some up
while he's off-island.

748
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:05,226
Is that the person
who dropped you off?

749
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,351
Captain John?

750
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:08,975
Maybe I was wrong.

751
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:11,852
Perhaps you are a spy.

752
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:13,226
No, I'm just kidding.

753
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,226
Yes, Captain John's
on the Cay seas

754
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,226
picking me up
some printing supplies

755
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,435
while he's in Puerto Rico.

756
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,643
When will he be back?

757
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:22,226
About a week.

758
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,059
Did his son go with him?

759
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,643
No, Matthew
just dropped him off
at the airport.

760
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:29,975
Why?
Do you know them?

761
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,852
No, I don't.

762
00:40:31,876 --> 00:40:32,975
Thank you, um...

763
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:34,226
Officer Bodden.

764
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,226
Officer Bodden,
thank you.

765
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,018
Miss Collins,
if you don't know
Captain John,

766
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,975
how did you know
his name?

767
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,727
And how did you know
the other person
in the car

768
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:45,935
was his son?

769
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:49,643
Some friends of mine
were here in the summer...

770
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:52,999
diving, and they told me
about him.

771
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:56,542
I see.
Well, have a good day.

772
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:08,975
Hello.

773
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:10,018
How are you?

774
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,101
Good.

775
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:14,560
I was just looking
at your boat.

776
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:16,975
Oh. It's no problem.

777
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:17,975
Would you like
to come on board?

778
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:18,976
No, no.

779
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,810
I can see fine
from here, thank you.

780
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:22,975
So where you from?

781
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,042
The hotel--
the Grand Vista.

782
00:42:27,584 --> 00:42:30,059
I know that.
I mean what country?

783
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:34,351
Oh, the U.S.

784
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,351
California.

785
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,894
Oh, that's awesome.

786
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:39,560
We don't get many
Americans around here.

787
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:41,602
I'm actually Canadian myself.

788
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,975
Haven't been back there
since I was 4.

789
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:46,560
My name's Matthew--
or Matt.

790
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:47,975
I even respond to "Hey, you!"

791
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,602
Sorry about that.

792
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:52,226
What should
I call you, ma'am?

793
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,143
Kristen.

794
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,560
We just got in last night
for the Junkanoo.

795
00:42:56,584 --> 00:42:58,351
You were there.

796
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,975
I think everybody
on the island was.

797
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:02,143
Did you go?

798
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,959
Yeah.

799
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,560
Can I charter the boat?

800
00:43:08,584 --> 00:43:09,768
Is that possible?

801
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:10,975
Oh, of course, yeah.

802
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:12,560
Just not today.

803
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:14,602
I need to wash her down.

804
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,560
But how about tomorrow?
Tomorrow's fine.

805
00:43:16,584 --> 00:43:18,143
Great.

806
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,143
Where would you want to go?

807
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:21,143
Anywhere.

808
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:22,768
I don't mind.

809
00:43:22,792 --> 00:43:24,975
That's good.
We kind of need
to stay close to shore.

810
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,351
We had some problems
with the radio
on the last trip,

811
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:29,768
and I wouldn't want
to go too far
without a radio,

812
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,518
at least not
this time of year.

813
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,894
Really?
Oh, yeah.

814
00:43:32,918 --> 00:43:34,768
There's nothing wrong
with thePhoenix,though.

815
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:37,143
She's the best boat
in the Caribbean.

816
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:39,975
We'll just have to stay close
on these inshore reefs here,

817
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:41,268
but there is
excellent diving--

818
00:43:41,292 --> 00:43:42,975
I don't want to dive.

819
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:45,975
Then why would you
want to go out?

820
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:53,975
Just to see everything
that there is to see.

821
00:43:53,999 --> 00:43:55,435
That makes it real easy.

822
00:43:55,459 --> 00:43:57,976
We'll just give
thePhoenixa rest
and take theZodiac.

823
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,975
So how many?

824
00:43:59,999 --> 00:44:01,059
How many what?

825
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:02,351
Passengers.

826
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,685
You, your husband--

827
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:04,768
Just me.

828
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:05,975
Okay.

829
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:08,643
Isn't there something
you want to ask me?

830
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,768
What?

831
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,894
Something important?

832
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:14,975
I don't know. What?

833
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:16,351
[laughs]

834
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:18,059
How much it'll cost.
Oh.

835
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:19,975
How much will it cost?

836
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:21,310
$400 U.S., please.

837
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:23,560
That's fine.

838
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:25,768
Can you leave a deposit?

839
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:27,975
You take credit cards?

840
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,334
Sure do.

841
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:42,560
Actually, could I see
your passport, please?

842
00:44:42,584 --> 00:44:43,560
The bank insists
that we write--

843
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:44,975
I don't have a passport,

844
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:46,975
but I do have
a birth certificate

845
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:49,351
with my maiden name,
Shepard,

846
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:53,435
and a driver's license
with my current
photograph,

847
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:56,351
and I have
a visa extension

848
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:57,768
which I just got
from the local police.

849
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:00,143
Is that going to
work for you?

850
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:02,999
That's more than enough,
thank you.

851
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,143
Thank you.

852
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:25,768
Can you sign this,
please?
Sure.

853
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,768
We're gonna have
a great day tomorrow.

854
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:29,560
Any special requests?

855
00:45:29,584 --> 00:45:31,975
Fishing rods, wine,
or anything?

856
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,975
No, I'll leave that
up to you, Captain.

857
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:36,351
Great.

858
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,351
Well, in that case,
I'll get her ready.

859
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:39,975
Just be here around 8:00

860
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:42,768
and don't forget
your sunscreen
and your swimsuit.

861
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:43,976
Swimsuit?

862
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,101
Yeah.

863
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:47,792
Right.

864
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,876
Woosh!

865
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:44,959
Woosh!

866
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:00,768
You find the view
interesting?

867
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:04,560
Do you have a problem
with the truth,
Mrs. Collins?

868
00:47:04,584 --> 00:47:07,351
I saw you down at the dock
earlier with young Matthew,

869
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,310
and you've been sitting here
watching him for hours.

870
00:47:09,334 --> 00:47:13,685
I don't mean to pry,
but do you mind
telling me why?

871
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,351
Isn't that prying?

872
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:19,143
We just heard back
from the U.S. consulate.

873
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:22,975
They couldn't understand
why you had us file
a lost passport form.

874
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:25,768
They say you've never
been issued a passport.

875
00:47:25,792 --> 00:47:27,560
So unless
you can explain to me

876
00:47:27,584 --> 00:47:29,975
how you can lose something
that never existed,

877
00:47:29,999 --> 00:47:31,975
you're gonna be spending
the night in a cell,

878
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:34,334
and you're gonna be
out of here on the first
flight in the morning.

879
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,351
Well, I...

880
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:40,876
Allow me to escort you
to the station.

881
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,185
You're telling me that this
man that everybody loves

882
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:50,976
faked his own death,
stole your son,

883
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,810
and moved to a tiny island
in the Caribbean?

884
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:55,393
Yes.

885
00:47:55,417 --> 00:47:57,393
It would help
if you had something
to back up your claim,

886
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:59,999
like a marriage license,
anything.

887
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:04,209
All I have is this.

888
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:07,477
How old is this photograph?

889
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:08,975
15 years.

890
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:12,435
Mrs. Collins,
that child could be anyone.

891
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:13,975
I couldn't tell you
what he looked like now

892
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:15,018
any more than
you could tell me

893
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:17,226
what my children will
look like in 15 years.

894
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,518
It would help
if you had a photograph
of your ex-husband.

895
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:20,643
I don't.

896
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:22,792
I got rid of everything
when...

897
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,560
Why would I make this up?

898
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:28,852
You have my word.

899
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:31,351
You gave me your word
that you lost your passport.

900
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,685
We both know
that that was a lie.

901
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:38,018
I keep copies
of everyone's files
who comes through here,

902
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:39,643
including yours.

903
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:43,667
Here,
take a look at these.

904
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:49,643
This is your supposedly
dead husband's passport
and Matthews.

905
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:52,226
But the name isn't
Quinn Halloran.

906
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,602
It's John Williams,

907
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:55,768
and he's from Canada,
not Los Angeles.

908
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:57,435
That's a forgery.

909
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:59,059
Which is more likely,

910
00:48:59,083 --> 00:49:01,852
that he created
an entire life
for himself and his son,

911
00:49:01,876 --> 00:49:04,975
or that this is just a case
of mistaken identity?

912
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:07,852
After all,
he has the documents
to prove who he is.

913
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:11,852
You don't.

914
00:49:11,876 --> 00:49:15,018
I know that this
is how it seems.

915
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:16,852
I know you're upset,

916
00:49:16,876 --> 00:49:19,083
so I'm not gonna
force you to leave
the island right now.

917
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,643
Thank you.

918
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:24,894
We'll
check on his passport,

919
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:27,018
the same
as we did with yours,

920
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:31,852
but I don't want you
telling young Matthew
any of this,

921
00:49:31,876 --> 00:49:34,435
because if what you're
telling me is true,

922
00:49:34,459 --> 00:49:38,643
Quinn may be dangerous,
and he could run again.

923
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:41,975
If I find out you've done
anything to jeopardize
this investigation

924
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:43,435
by telling Matthew,

925
00:49:43,459 --> 00:49:46,226
I'll have you off
of Santa Alicia
within the hour,

926
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,018
and this will be all over.

927
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:49,667
Understood?

928
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,975
Do you have
all the details you need?

929
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:57,042
Names, numbers--
I'm on it.

930
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:03,792
Remember,
not one word to Matthew.

931
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,226
[ringing]

932
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,975
[Man on answering machine]
Hello, you've reached
Caribbean Dive Adventures.

933
00:50:20,999 --> 00:50:22,560
We're under water
right now

934
00:50:22,584 --> 00:50:24,059
and obviously can't
get to the phone,

935
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:25,768
so leave a message
after the beep.

936
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,560
[beep]

937
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:28,975
[Bodden on speaker]
Hey, John, call me
as soon as you get back.

938
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:30,935
I had this woman
Kristen Collins in here

939
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:33,643
telling me this crazy
story about you.

940
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:36,667
I'll tell you all about it
over that beer you owe me.

941
00:50:47,876 --> 00:50:49,435
Ahoy, there, Matthew.

942
00:50:49,459 --> 00:50:50,852
Ahoy, yourself.

943
00:50:50,876 --> 00:50:51,975
Come on board.

944
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:55,351
You know,
I haven't been on a boat

945
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:56,975
in nearly 20 years.

946
00:50:56,999 --> 00:50:58,602
Really?
Yeah.

947
00:50:58,626 --> 00:51:00,268
You have life jackets,
right?

948
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:02,042
Oh, yeah, definitely.

949
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,852
Here you are.
Thanks.

950
00:51:06,876 --> 00:51:08,435
When you're getting
on theZodiac,

951
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:10,852
just sit in the back
next to the outboard.

952
00:51:10,876 --> 00:51:12,852
You got to be real careful.

953
00:51:12,876 --> 00:51:14,852
Keep all your weight
inside the boat.

954
00:51:14,876 --> 00:51:16,435
Otherwise,
if we hit a big wave,

955
00:51:16,459 --> 00:51:19,018
I might have to come
and fish you out.

956
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:21,226
Don't worry, though.
Just relax.

957
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,852
I'll do all the work.

958
00:51:22,876 --> 00:51:24,209
Good.

959
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,584
Ooh!

960
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:50,852
All right,
your turn to drive.

961
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,226
Yeah.

962
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,226
Come on, it's easy.

963
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,852
Look, twist it this way
to go faster,

964
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:57,018
and back to slow down.

965
00:51:57,042 --> 00:51:58,435
Piece of cake.

966
00:51:58,459 --> 00:51:59,685
Just put this on first.

967
00:51:59,709 --> 00:52:00,727
What is it?

968
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:01,975
It's called a kill switch.

969
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:03,810
It's just a cord
connected to the engine.

970
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:06,310
That way, you fall overboard,
it pulls out and cuts off,

971
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:08,643
and your boat won't
sail off into oblivion.

972
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,727
Huh.
You can swim back.

973
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:11,975
How's that sound?

974
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:13,975
You want me to let go
of these ropes?

975
00:52:13,999 --> 00:52:16,226
You're gonna have to
to drive this boat.

976
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,018
Here, you promised.

977
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,101
I never did.

978
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,975
There you go.

979
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:23,560
Okay.

980
00:52:23,584 --> 00:52:25,185
Remember, twist it
towards me to go faster

981
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:27,709
and back to slow down.

982
00:52:29,999 --> 00:52:31,584
Head out that way.

983
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,435
See? You're doing great!

984
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:37,584
You're a natural.

985
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:41,435
[Matthew]
Good.

986
00:52:41,459 --> 00:52:42,975
Good, good!

987
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:44,542
Keep it up!

988
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,709
Check it out.

989
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:18,975
Did you build this?

990
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:20,975
Yeah, me and my dad.

991
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:22,852
No one knows it's here.

992
00:53:22,876 --> 00:53:24,375
Now I do.

993
00:53:37,209 --> 00:53:38,393
Oh, no.

994
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:39,393
Remember, I said
I didn't want to dive.

995
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,185
Come on,
you have to try it--

996
00:53:41,209 --> 00:53:43,643
just on the surface
for now.

997
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,834
I'll put air in your jacket,
and you won't sink.

998
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:45,975
Here's your wetsuit.
I'll put air in your jacket,
and you won't sink.

999
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:45,999
Here's your wetsuit.

1000
00:53:45,999 --> 00:53:47,185
Here's your wetsuit.
It's just like snorkeling,
only water doesn't
get into your mouth.

1001
00:53:47,185 --> 00:53:49,435
It's just like snorkeling,
only water doesn't
get into your mouth.

1002
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,975
It's perfect, right?

1003
00:53:50,999 --> 00:53:53,975
I can't.
You can,
I promise you.

1004
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:54,975
Trust me.

1005
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,226
You'll just be
suspended, floating,

1006
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:57,975
looking down
on the fish
and the coral.

1007
00:53:57,999 --> 00:54:01,000
Really, Matthew,
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

1008
00:54:03,876 --> 00:54:04,852
There's no such word

1009
00:54:04,876 --> 00:54:07,643
as "can't"
in the dictionary.

1010
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:11,643
Just relax,
take a deep breath,

1011
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:13,852
hold it for
a couple seconds,

1012
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:16,226
and blow all
the "can'ts" away.

1013
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,852
[exhales]

1014
00:54:17,876 --> 00:54:20,226
My mother
taught me that once.

1015
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:22,727
You know what? She's right.
It always works.

1016
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:25,226
I do it to all
the nervous divers.

1017
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,518
You just got to try it.

1018
00:54:26,542 --> 00:54:27,999
[inhales]

1019
00:54:35,876 --> 00:54:36,999
Good.

1020
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:17,435
It's beautiful.

1021
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:19,975
It was awesome.

1022
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:21,459
Oh, man.

1023
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:26,250
Woo!

1024
00:56:28,042 --> 00:56:29,542
Woo!

1025
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:32,292
Got it.

1026
00:56:54,459 --> 00:56:56,459
[no audible dialogue]

1027
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:18,975
This is wonderful.

1028
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:20,667
I know.
Isn't it?

1029
00:57:22,999 --> 00:57:25,975
How did you end up here?

1030
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:28,018
My dad bought the shop
three years ago.

1031
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:31,018
Before that,
we had a charter yacht
in Honduras.

1032
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:33,435
We've been all over.

1033
00:57:33,459 --> 00:57:34,435
Are you in school?

1034
00:57:34,459 --> 00:57:35,894
Yeah.

1035
00:57:35,918 --> 00:57:36,894
Everywhere we went,

1036
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:38,643
Dad made sure
I was in school.

1037
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,435
He helped me out
with classes at night

1038
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:45,975
and always insisted
that I finish my semester
before we changed ports.

1039
00:57:45,999 --> 00:57:49,435
Why did you keep
moving around?

1040
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:51,727
Dad's sort of a genius.

1041
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:54,226
He'd buy a small business
in an out of the way place,

1042
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:58,018
and pretty soon
he'd build it up until
it was a huge success.

1043
00:57:58,042 --> 00:57:59,477
Then he'd just sell it.

1044
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:01,852
Then we'd start
all over again.

1045
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:04,226
That's
how I ended up here.

1046
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,975
Why not keep the business
if it's doing so well?

1047
00:58:06,999 --> 00:58:10,018
I don't know.

1048
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:13,643
It's not really
what Dad's all about.

1049
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:17,018
Your childhood,
do you remember
where you grew up?

1050
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:19,417
Oh, yeah, sure do.

1051
00:58:25,459 --> 00:58:28,975
I remember my mother.

1052
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:32,852
She was so beautiful,
in every way, too.

1053
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:34,435
She just...

1054
00:58:34,459 --> 00:58:36,018
[sigh]

1055
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,226
I can remember her
pushing me on the swing

1056
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,226
in the backyard
when I was small.

1057
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,852
She was always so kind,
reading me stories and books.

1058
00:58:44,876 --> 00:58:47,852
She called me "Little Markie."

1059
00:58:47,876 --> 00:58:51,975
Mark's my middle name.

1060
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:52,975
[sigh]

1061
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:58,435
Do you have
a picture of her?

1062
00:58:58,459 --> 00:58:59,999
I wish I did.

1063
00:59:07,999 --> 00:59:12,417
My mom died
in a terrible fire
when I was little.

1064
00:59:13,999 --> 00:59:17,435
I can remember it
like it was yesterday.

1065
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:20,018
My father took me out.

1066
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:21,894
It was so stormy
on the boat.

1067
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:23,876
It was raining and cold.

1068
00:59:26,876 --> 00:59:28,226
When we got back,

1069
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:31,975
we heard that the house
had burned down
to the ground

1070
00:59:31,999 --> 00:59:34,226
with everything in it--

1071
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:39,459
pictures, our furniture,
toys. We lost everything.

1072
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:47,643
My dad was...so upset.

1073
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:51,018
We just never went back.

1074
00:59:51,042 --> 00:59:54,477
He used to talk about her
all the time, though.

1075
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:55,975
What did he say?

1076
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:58,560
That she was an angel

1077
00:59:58,584 --> 01:00:00,999
and we should never
forget her.

1078
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:06,975
We still go to church
the first Sunday of the month

1079
01:00:06,999 --> 01:00:08,975
and light three candles--

1080
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:12,375
one for her
and two for me and Dad.

1081
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,375
They represent our family.

1082
01:00:17,999 --> 01:00:20,727
If she were still
alive today,

1083
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:22,999
we'd all be together.

1084
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,999
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make you cry.

1085
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:55,975
Here you go.

1086
01:00:55,999 --> 01:00:57,768
Thanks.

1087
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:59,143
Can we do this
again tomorrow?

1088
01:00:59,167 --> 01:01:00,310
Really?

1089
01:01:00,334 --> 01:01:02,768
Tomorrow's on me,
no charge.

1090
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,143
You already paid double.

1091
01:01:04,167 --> 01:01:05,975
I did?
Yeah.

1092
01:01:05,999 --> 01:01:07,560
When you asked me for 400,

1093
01:01:07,584 --> 01:01:09,351
you should have
bargained me down
to the real price,

1094
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:10,975
which is 200,

1095
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:13,059
but you said yes
too quickly.

1096
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:14,768
It was worth every cent.

1097
01:01:14,792 --> 01:01:16,975
The last American couple
we took out

1098
01:01:16,999 --> 01:01:18,768
argued about
every single penny.

1099
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:20,185
Marge and Ron Satrum.

1100
01:01:20,209 --> 01:01:21,810
You know them?

1101
01:01:21,834 --> 01:01:25,975
That's how I found out
about you and your boat.

1102
01:01:25,999 --> 01:01:28,999
I hope I lived up
to my reputation.

1103
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:34,975
Matthew, there's something
that I have to tell you.

1104
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:36,768
I'm not here as a tourist.

1105
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:39,560
I came here for a reason.

1106
01:01:39,584 --> 01:01:41,602
Don't say it.
I got it.

1107
01:01:41,626 --> 01:01:44,143
You figure that if I
can get Marge to dive,

1108
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,768
then I can get you
to become a pro, right?

1109
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:48,975
Well, hey,
we'll go deeper tomorrow.

1110
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:50,999
How's that sound, okay?

1111
01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:54,560
Okay.

1112
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:55,975
All right.

1113
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:57,167
8:00 A.M. sharp.

1114
01:02:02,999 --> 01:02:04,975
[Kristen]
Oh, my God, Steve.

1115
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:08,351
He's incredible.

1116
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:12,351
He's everything
I could have
ever dreamed of.

1117
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:14,975
I had the most
amazing day.

1118
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:15,975
[indistinct phone chatter]

1119
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,768
I know.

1120
01:02:17,792 --> 01:02:20,560
No, Quinn isn't here.

1121
01:02:20,584 --> 01:02:23,560
It was just Mark and me.

1122
01:02:23,584 --> 01:02:24,999
It was perfect.

1123
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:28,542
[telephone ringing]

1124
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:31,143
Hello.

1125
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,143
[Quinn on telephone]
Hey, son.

1126
01:02:32,167 --> 01:02:33,975
Hey, Dad.
How's Puerto Rico?

1127
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:34,975
Hey, hey!

1128
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:35,975
Everything's good here.

1129
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:39,226
Jose and Maria
send their best.

1130
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,560
How's things going?

1131
01:02:40,584 --> 01:02:41,643
Great.

1132
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:43,393
Just rented a day charter
in theZodiac

1133
01:02:43,417 --> 01:02:45,185
up to Gibbs Key
for a dive and a picnic.

1134
01:02:45,209 --> 01:02:47,310
Hey, that's cool.
What else is going on?

1135
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:49,975
Officer Bodden left you
a pretty strange message.

1136
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,351
It was actually about
the American woman
I took out today.

1137
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,477
Said that she had
some crazy story about you

1138
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:57,351
and you should probably
call him back.

1139
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:58,560
What was her name?

1140
01:02:58,584 --> 01:03:00,167
Kristen.

1141
01:03:04,999 --> 01:03:06,351
Kristen what?

1142
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:07,975
Collins.

1143
01:03:07,999 --> 01:03:09,975
But she had another name
on her birth certificate.

1144
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:11,975
I wrote it down
when I called her charge in.

1145
01:03:11,999 --> 01:03:12,975
Hold on.

1146
01:03:12,999 --> 01:03:14,250
Her other name was Shepard.

1147
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,143
Well...

1148
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:19,268
how old was she?

1149
01:03:19,292 --> 01:03:22,351
Uh, a little bit
younger than you.

1150
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:23,935
[Quinn]
Did she say anything else?

1151
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:24,975
About what?

1152
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:26,975
About anything.
Think.

1153
01:03:26,999 --> 01:03:30,477
She said some friends
recommended our boat.

1154
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:32,143
[Matthew]
It was that crazy
American couple

1155
01:03:32,167 --> 01:03:34,975
we took out
about six weeks ago.

1156
01:03:34,999 --> 01:03:35,975
The ones from L.A.?

1157
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:37,310
Yeah, yeah.

1158
01:03:37,334 --> 01:03:38,768
It was a bit weird.

1159
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:40,351
She was acting
really nervous,

1160
01:03:40,375 --> 01:03:42,268
and she said that she
had hated boats

1161
01:03:42,292 --> 01:03:44,560
even though
she had been married
to a sailor before.

1162
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:47,143
I don't know.

1163
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:49,560
Did I do something
wrong, Dad?

1164
01:03:49,584 --> 01:03:50,560
No, no, no.

1165
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:52,975
It's not you, it's her.

1166
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:54,351
Listen, Matthew,

1167
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:57,768
you have to do
exactly as I say.

1168
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,143
I want you
to wake Mavis up,

1169
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,975
tell her to get all of our
savings out of the bank,

1170
01:04:02,999 --> 01:04:05,975
and then I want you
to go over to the boat

1171
01:04:05,999 --> 01:04:08,560
and head out to Salt Cay.

1172
01:04:08,584 --> 01:04:09,852
I will meet you there.

1173
01:04:09,876 --> 01:04:11,143
Dad, wait,
I don't understand.

1174
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:12,975
She already paid
to go sailing
again tomorrow, Dad.

1175
01:04:12,999 --> 01:04:14,059
Don't worry about that.

1176
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:15,351
We will refund her money.

1177
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:16,768
Just do what I say.

1178
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:17,975
Why? What's wrong?

1179
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:19,894
I will tell you
when I get there.

1180
01:04:19,918 --> 01:04:21,602
But, Dad,
what if I want to stay?

1181
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:23,768
You don't want to stay
if that woman is around.

1182
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:25,685
But she was nice!

1183
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:27,999
I don't care
how nice she is.

1184
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:33,143
Please, just leave now.

1185
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:34,999
I will explain it
to you later.

1186
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:43,560
Are you still there?

1187
01:04:43,584 --> 01:04:46,560
Matthew, are you there?

1188
01:04:46,584 --> 01:04:48,560
Yeah, I'm still here.

1189
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,768
Please, son, just do
this one thing for me.

1190
01:04:52,792 --> 01:04:53,975
Okay.

1191
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:56,584
I'll see you tomorrow.

1192
01:06:23,792 --> 01:06:26,975
Hey, Kristen, I have something
for you at the desk.

1193
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:28,351
Is there a storm?

1194
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,975
More than a storm.

1195
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:31,351
Eduardo out in the Atlantic

1196
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,975
took a right-hand turn
last night.

1197
01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:35,351
It's not a category 3
hurricane and building,

1198
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,975
and it's making a beeline
right for us.

1199
01:06:36,999 --> 01:06:38,975
But the weather's
so beautiful.

1200
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:40,768
You heard about
the calm before the storm?

1201
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,975
Eduardo's pushing
all the good weather before it,

1202
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,975
but when it hits,
all hell is going to
break loose.

1203
01:06:45,999 --> 01:06:47,143
But you don't have to worry.

1204
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,143
The old Grand Vista,
she's a hurricane shelter.

1205
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:51,226
In fact, we're gonna
open the doors to the locals

1206
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:52,768
in just a few minutes,

1207
01:06:52,792 --> 01:06:54,351
and they can ride
the storm out here.

1208
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:56,143
Is this a refund
because of the hurricane?

1209
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,975
No, it's
from young Matthew.

1210
01:06:57,999 --> 01:06:59,143
He came by last night.

1211
01:06:59,167 --> 01:07:01,602
It's the leftover money
from your charter.

1212
01:07:01,626 --> 01:07:04,560
Did he cancel
because of the storm?

1213
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:05,768
I shouldn't think so

1214
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:07,768
because he came over
before 10:00,

1215
01:07:07,792 --> 01:07:09,351
and the hurricane hunters
didn't get the word out

1216
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:12,143
about Eduardo's new track
till after midnight.

1217
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:14,560
He said something about
he was leaving the island.

1218
01:07:14,584 --> 01:07:17,167
He had to join his dad
at Salt Cay.

1219
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,975
Did he say anything else?

1220
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:24,918
Yeah, he said good-bye.

1221
01:07:28,792 --> 01:07:30,935
Right there,
come on.

1222
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:32,999
[chattering]

1223
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:04,101
[Announcer on TV]
You are advised to evacuate

1224
01:08:04,125 --> 01:08:07,975
to your nearest
hurricane shelter
immediately.

1225
01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:08,975
The storm is expected...

1226
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:10,518
He's gone.
Who's gone?

1227
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:12,310
Matthew!
He's left the island.

1228
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:13,518
When did he leave?

1229
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:14,935
Last night.

1230
01:08:14,959 --> 01:08:16,101
His father must have
found out that I'm here

1231
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,143
and told him to go.

1232
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:19,101
You have a very active
imagination.

1233
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,518
I am not imagining
that the boat is gone

1234
01:08:21,542 --> 01:08:23,268
and the shop is closed up.

1235
01:08:23,292 --> 01:08:24,518
If you haven't noticed,

1236
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:26,727
we have a hundred-year
storm coming our way.

1237
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,518
By this time tomorrow,
it's going to be
pounding this island.

1238
01:08:29,542 --> 01:08:32,852
Maybe Matthew just took
the boat someplace safer
to ride it out.

1239
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,975
Safer than the harbor?

1240
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:38,310
Where else around here
could be safer than that?

1241
01:08:38,334 --> 01:08:40,518
There could be any number
of reasons why.

1242
01:08:40,542 --> 01:08:43,852
Or maybe his father
told him to run.

1243
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:45,393
Oh, please.

1244
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:49,101
You never even called
about his passport, did you?

1245
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,018
I have a thousand
residents on this island
to worry about right now,

1246
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,518
not just one tourist.

1247
01:08:55,542 --> 01:08:57,101
Maybe tomorrow, when
this hurricane is gone,

1248
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,975
we can deal with this.

1249
01:08:58,999 --> 01:09:00,727
No, it will be
too late by then!

1250
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:02,542
He will have gone again.

1251
01:09:03,959 --> 01:09:07,310
What kind of
police officer are you?

1252
01:09:07,334 --> 01:09:08,999
I'll find him myself.

1253
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:14,935
[Kristen on telephone]
I found him, Steve,
and now he's gone.

1254
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:16,101
Let him go for now, honey.

1255
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:17,518
It's all over the news

1256
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:18,976
about a hurricane heading
straight for the islands.

1257
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,975
I can't. Not now.

1258
01:09:20,999 --> 01:09:21,975
What about the police?

1259
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,310
No. The police?

1260
01:09:23,334 --> 01:09:25,685
They don't even believe me,
and I have no proof.

1261
01:09:25,709 --> 01:09:27,143
Maybe I can dig something up.

1262
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,935
Did you get
the police officer's fax

1263
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,975
or email or something?

1264
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,059
No, just the hotel's,

1265
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:33,560
but I don't know how much
longer I'll be here.

1266
01:09:33,584 --> 01:09:34,975
I'm going to find Mark.

1267
01:09:34,999 --> 01:09:36,268
Kristen, please,
stay where you are.

1268
01:09:36,292 --> 01:09:37,975
If this hurricane's
as bad as they say,

1269
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:39,334
it's gonna
be a monster.

1270
01:09:41,792 --> 01:09:44,042
Okay. I love you.

1271
01:09:48,999 --> 01:09:51,083
Hold all my calls.
I'm going home.

1272
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:54,975
It's in the back,

1273
01:09:54,999 --> 01:09:56,894
but it should be sheltered
from the hurricane.

1274
01:09:56,918 --> 01:09:58,351
Is that all right
for you girls?

1275
01:09:58,375 --> 01:10:00,209
I've got two beds
in there, okay?

1276
01:10:01,459 --> 01:10:02,435
Excuse me.

1277
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:04,143
Patrick,
I need your help.

1278
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,685
Kristen, you're
gonna have to wait.

1279
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:06,935
I need to find Matthew.

1280
01:10:06,959 --> 01:10:08,560
Matthew?
Not Captain John?

1281
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:11,101
Matthew is my son,
and I need to find him now.

1282
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,435
Your son?

1283
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,768
He told you Salt Cay?

1284
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:14,975
Yeah, Salt Cay.
Where is it?

1285
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:16,018
It's due south of here.

1286
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:17,602
Where's south?

1287
01:10:17,626 --> 01:10:18,975
South is straight
out the harbor.

1288
01:10:18,999 --> 01:10:21,018
You keep the land
to your back.

1289
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:22,268
You can't go there now.

1290
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:23,810
It's 20 miles of open ocean.

1291
01:10:23,834 --> 01:10:25,727
I realize that.
I have to find him.

1292
01:10:25,751 --> 01:10:27,602
You can't survive
a hurricane there!

1293
01:10:27,626 --> 01:10:28,709
It's a flat salt marsh!

1294
01:10:39,167 --> 01:10:40,792
What the--

1295
01:10:45,999 --> 01:10:47,310
Check the moorings
in South Harbor.

1296
01:10:47,334 --> 01:10:49,852
Make sure that
they're all secure,
all right?

1297
01:10:49,876 --> 01:10:50,852
Officer Bodden?

1298
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:52,143
What can I do for you?

1299
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:53,876
I just received this.

1300
01:11:00,999 --> 01:11:02,810
She was telling the truth.

1301
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,810
I guess she was.
Where is she now?

1302
01:11:04,834 --> 01:11:06,727
She said she was
going to Salt Cay.

1303
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,999
With a hurricane
coming in?

1304
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:02,999
[panting]

1305
01:13:58,626 --> 01:14:00,393
Kristen?

1306
01:14:00,417 --> 01:14:02,393
You bastard!

1307
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:06,560
Damn!
You stole my son!

1308
01:14:06,584 --> 01:14:08,768
Calm down!

1309
01:14:08,792 --> 01:14:09,975
I didn't have a choice,
okay?

1310
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:12,351
You were taking him
away from me!

1311
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,768
Ehrrr!

1312
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:14,976
Kris--
Where is he?

1313
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,393
He's out
getting fresh water.

1314
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:18,518
He's gonna be back
any minute now. Calm down!

1315
01:14:18,542 --> 01:14:19,751
[sobbing]

1316
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:25,999
Get off me,
you son of a bitch!

1317
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:33,975
They told me he was dead!

1318
01:14:33,999 --> 01:14:35,185
Look, I'm sorry.

1319
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:37,560
Your attorneys were gonna
take him away from me.

1320
01:14:37,584 --> 01:14:39,975
So instead of trusting me,
you took him and ran!

1321
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,975
Look, I gave you
everything you need, okay?

1322
01:14:41,999 --> 01:14:43,975
I gave you the house,
the money, the car,

1323
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:46,018
everything you needed
to continue with your life.

1324
01:14:46,042 --> 01:14:47,999
My life?

1325
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:50,751
My life was over
when you took Mark.

1326
01:14:54,209 --> 01:14:56,393
I'm sorry. I wanted
to give him a chance.

1327
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:58,894
I didn't want him
to grow up in the city

1328
01:14:58,918 --> 01:15:00,185
with the crime
and the drugs.

1329
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:02,101
That is crap!

1330
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,310
You just didn't want him
to be with me!

1331
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:05,810
That's not true.

1332
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:08,393
I wanted him to have
a chance at a good life.

1333
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,751
Without a mother?

1334
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,000
Would he have had a father
if he'd stayed with you?

1335
01:15:26,918 --> 01:15:28,250
He's a good kid.

1336
01:15:29,999 --> 01:15:31,751
He's a great kid.

1337
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,393
Kristen, I did not do this
to hurt you, okay?

1338
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,709
I just could not take
a chance on losing my son.

1339
01:16:01,459 --> 01:16:02,976
So what do we do now?

1340
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,292
I want Mark.

1341
01:16:07,999 --> 01:16:09,975
What about me?

1342
01:16:09,999 --> 01:16:12,209
You can go to hell
for all I care.

1343
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:15,584
[Matthew]
Dad?

1344
01:16:19,709 --> 01:16:21,918
Matthew.

1345
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:26,810
That's the woman.
She's the one.

1346
01:16:26,834 --> 01:16:28,975
I told him
you're from the IRS.

1347
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:29,975
Huh?

1348
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:32,143
Come on board, Matthew.

1349
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:34,000
We need to talk.

1350
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:43,976
Matthew, son...

1351
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,393
I know I told you
that, uh...

1352
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:50,975
that this woman
was from the IRS,

1353
01:16:50,999 --> 01:16:54,602
but that wasn't true.

1354
01:16:54,626 --> 01:16:55,602
Why would you--

1355
01:16:55,626 --> 01:16:57,209
She...

1356
01:17:01,999 --> 01:17:05,560
She's your mother.

1357
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:08,685
She came here
to bring you home.

1358
01:17:08,709 --> 01:17:10,876
My mother?

1359
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:17,751
You're my mother?

1360
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,999
I thought you were dead.

1361
01:17:27,334 --> 01:17:29,894
Dad?

1362
01:17:29,918 --> 01:17:32,167
I'm sorry. I, uh...

1363
01:17:34,459 --> 01:17:35,975
When you were a little boy

1364
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:38,999
your mother and I were--
were getting divorced.

1365
01:17:40,626 --> 01:17:42,602
I was scared
I was gonna lose you,

1366
01:17:42,626 --> 01:17:45,792
so I--I
just took you away.

1367
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,375
I made a mistake,
a big mistake.

1368
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:58,792
I did it for all
the right reasons.

1369
01:18:06,667 --> 01:18:08,018
I'm gonna fix the radio,

1370
01:18:08,042 --> 01:18:11,602
so why don't you two, um...

1371
01:18:11,626 --> 01:18:12,975
go down to the beach,

1372
01:18:12,999 --> 01:18:14,999
take a little walk on shore?

1373
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:26,226
Everything
she said was true.

1374
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:27,768
Matthew even closed
their bank account

1375
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:28,975
before he left.

1376
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:30,101
So what are you gonna do?

1377
01:18:30,125 --> 01:18:32,101
I have a helicopter
coming over from Provo.

1378
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:34,975
It's picking me up,
and then I'm going
to Salt Cay.

1379
01:18:34,999 --> 01:18:37,518
And then what?

1380
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:38,602
You tell me.

1381
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:40,975
Kidnapping,
immigration fraud,

1382
01:18:40,999 --> 01:18:42,518
false passports.

1383
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:44,999
It's a laundry list
of charges.

1384
01:18:46,999 --> 01:18:48,975
Our Captain John
could be going to jail

1385
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:50,975
for a very long time.

1386
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:52,918
Is that really necessary?

1387
01:18:54,834 --> 01:18:55,834
I hope not.

1388
01:18:59,459 --> 01:19:00,975
Why didn't you
tell me yesterday?

1389
01:19:00,999 --> 01:19:03,584
I wanted to. I tried.

1390
01:19:06,584 --> 01:19:09,975
All these years, I tried
to remember your face,

1391
01:19:09,999 --> 01:19:11,768
what you looked like,

1392
01:19:11,792 --> 01:19:15,810
the things you taught me.

1393
01:19:15,834 --> 01:19:18,268
Now you're here.

1394
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:21,167
It must have been
really hard for you.

1395
01:19:25,167 --> 01:19:27,435
I would wake up...

1396
01:19:27,459 --> 01:19:29,876
to your scent
every day.

1397
01:19:31,584 --> 01:19:34,768
And then I would bury
myself in the pillow

1398
01:19:34,792 --> 01:19:37,975
and try to...
breathe you in.

1399
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:39,975
But it only lasted
for a second,

1400
01:19:39,999 --> 01:19:41,751
and then it was gone.

1401
01:19:43,999 --> 01:19:46,667
I couldn't stand
to open my eyes.

1402
01:19:53,709 --> 01:19:55,975
I can't believe
you're here.

1403
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:58,727
"Can't" is not
in the dictionary, remember?

1404
01:19:58,751 --> 01:19:59,959
[both chuckle]

1405
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:18,042
Matt! Kris!

1406
01:20:20,334 --> 01:20:22,101
Let's go.
We got to get back
to the boat.

1407
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:23,310
Dad, what is it?

1408
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:24,685
The hurricane,
it's coming.

1409
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:25,685
Eduardo?

1410
01:20:25,709 --> 01:20:26,727
It's way
north of us.

1411
01:20:26,751 --> 01:20:28,518
Well, not anymore.

1412
01:20:28,542 --> 01:20:30,643
It turned last night
and it's speeding up.

1413
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:32,727
It's already
a category 4.

1414
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:34,310
I didn't hear
anything about it.

1415
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:36,101
The radio was broken,
but I, uh--

1416
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,518
I fixed it.

1417
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:39,310
It's on every frequency.

1418
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,727
Maritime posted a warning.

1419
01:20:41,751 --> 01:20:42,975
It's stretched out
500 miles.

1420
01:20:42,999 --> 01:20:43,975
It's true.

1421
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:45,518
They were boarding up
in Santa Alicia.

1422
01:20:45,542 --> 01:20:46,975
There's no shelter
on this island.

1423
01:20:46,999 --> 01:20:49,101
Maybe we can make a run
for Ambergris Cay.

1424
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:50,393
They got a harbor.

1425
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:51,518
Santa Alicia's
way closer.

1426
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:52,894
I know, but I can't
go back there.

1427
01:20:52,918 --> 01:20:54,059
They'll be looking for me.

1428
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,518
You're just gonna
keep running?

1429
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:56,935
I got no choice, son.

1430
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:57,959
Now come on.

1431
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:17,518
[Man on radio]
Dive boatPhoenix,

1432
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:19,393
this is Provo air rescue.

1433
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:20,935
We're approaching Salt Cay.

1434
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:21,975
Come in if you are
receiving us.

1435
01:21:21,999 --> 01:21:23,435
Come in, please.

1436
01:21:23,459 --> 01:21:25,310
There's a helicopter
coming to take us out.

1437
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:26,876
We can beat the storm.

1438
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:31,518
Phoenix,this is
Officer Bodden onboard
Provo air rescue.

1439
01:21:31,542 --> 01:21:34,435
[Bodden on radio]
What is your exact
location on Salt Cay?

1440
01:21:34,459 --> 01:21:36,852
Are you on the north end
or the south end?

1441
01:21:36,876 --> 01:21:39,435
Dad, they've got
the police with them.

1442
01:21:39,459 --> 01:21:41,101
If you tell them
how to find us,
you'll go to jail.

1443
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,975
Matthew, if I don't,
we could all die out here.

1444
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,852
But you'll die in prison.

1445
01:21:45,876 --> 01:21:46,976
You can't live locked up.

1446
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,975
Look, I couldn't--

1447
01:21:49,999 --> 01:21:51,435
I couldn't live
the rest of my life

1448
01:21:51,459 --> 01:21:53,435
if anything happened
to the two of you.

1449
01:21:53,459 --> 01:21:55,999
I've already caused
enough pain.

1450
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:02,018
Provo air rescue,
this is thePhoenix.

1451
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:05,435
I repeat,
this is thePhoenix.

1452
01:22:05,459 --> 01:22:07,435
We're on the southwest
end of Salt Cay

1453
01:22:07,459 --> 01:22:09,975
awaiting your
instructions, over.

1454
01:22:09,999 --> 01:22:11,975
[Man on radio]
Stay where you are,
Phoenix.

1455
01:22:11,999 --> 01:22:14,268
We should be with you
in six minutes.

1456
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:15,667
Is that you, John?

1457
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,852
No, Officer Bodden.

1458
01:22:20,876 --> 01:22:24,643
It's Quinn Halloran
with my son Mark
and his mother.

1459
01:22:24,667 --> 01:22:26,435
We're, uh...

1460
01:22:26,459 --> 01:22:28,292
we're awaiting
your arrival.

1461
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:40,226
Well, son,
we had a good ride.

1462
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,643
Dad, please,
just take the boat.

1463
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:43,018
Go, please.

1464
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:45,226
I can't.

1465
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:48,018
Bodden will have alerted
every port in the Caribbean,

1466
01:22:48,042 --> 01:22:49,852
and I'd rather
serve my time here

1467
01:22:49,876 --> 01:22:52,000
than rot in some
jail cell in Haiti.

1468
01:22:56,459 --> 01:22:57,834
We had a good ride, son.

1469
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:04,810
Then take the key
to theZodiac.

1470
01:23:04,834 --> 01:23:05,975
They'll never
find you on it.

1471
01:23:05,999 --> 01:23:07,768
It's too small.

1472
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:09,185
You sure?

1473
01:23:09,209 --> 01:23:11,042
Don't ask me. Just take it.

1474
01:23:13,709 --> 01:23:16,185
Take care of our boy.

1475
01:23:16,209 --> 01:23:18,792
Be seeing you around,
sailor.

1476
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:25,018
Dad, wait.

1477
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:27,226
Please, you don't
have to do this, Dad.

1478
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:29,375
Don't go, please.

1479
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:38,435
I'm sorry, son.
There's just no other way.

1480
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:40,518
Your mother needs you
now, okay?

1481
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:42,626
And you need her, too.

1482
01:23:44,999 --> 01:23:46,226
I love you.

1483
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:48,018
I love you, Dad.

1484
01:23:48,042 --> 01:23:49,918
I know.
I love you, too.

1485
01:23:52,999 --> 01:23:54,250
I've got to go.

1486
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,209
[Matthew sighs]

1487
01:24:51,667 --> 01:24:53,226
I'll be seeing you.

1488
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:56,018
All right, man.

1489
01:24:56,042 --> 01:24:59,542
All right.
Keep in touch.

1490
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,643
I hope you don't mind.

1491
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,852
I left your Los Angeles
number with some locals

1492
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:07,643
just in case anything,
you know--

1493
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,018
You didn't give it
to Patrick, did you?

1494
01:25:09,042 --> 01:25:10,975
No, no.
Good.

1495
01:25:10,999 --> 01:25:12,852
[both laugh]

1496
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:15,852
It's gonna be
so different.

1497
01:25:15,876 --> 01:25:17,643
America, you know?

1498
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:20,852
It's your home.
Yeah.

1499
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:22,852
But your husband--
Steve.

1500
01:25:22,876 --> 01:25:24,975
Yeah, you think
he's going to--

1501
01:25:24,999 --> 01:25:27,975
Like a beach bum
like you?

1502
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,852
He has been wanting
to learn how to surf
ever since we met.

1503
01:25:31,876 --> 01:25:34,602
Did I tell you
how we met?

1504
01:25:34,626 --> 01:25:37,975
Well, once upon a time...

1505
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:39,975
you're in for
a long ride home.

1506
01:25:39,999 --> 01:25:41,250
