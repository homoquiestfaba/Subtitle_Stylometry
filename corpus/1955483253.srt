1
00:00:00,506 --> 00:00:02,697
(clicking)

2
00:00:02,697 --> 00:00:05,780
(gentle piano music)

3
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:23,329
- Today we're gonna talk
about Frederick Douglass.

4
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,986
The Union was falling apart.

5
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,313
The South was seceding.

6
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:31,577
It was a very young country.

7
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:33,817
Frederick Douglass was an abolitionist,

8
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:37,729
and he believed it is morally
wrong to have slavery.

9
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,384
And people were like, "Hey Lincoln!

10
00:00:39,384 --> 00:00:41,109
This guy's talkin' a good game.

11
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,324
You should meet with him."

12
00:00:42,324 --> 00:00:44,588
And Lincoln wasn't a douchebag.

13
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:47,755
He's like, "Okay. I'll meet with him."

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,966
Frederick Douglass comes
to the White House.

15
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:55,140
Senator Pomeroy, he's like,

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,390
"Da da-da! Abraham Lincoln,

17
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:01,140
let me introduce you
to Frederick Douglass,

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,393
a black former slave,

19
00:01:03,393 --> 00:01:06,643
a good black man who has some speeches.

20
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,030
He would like to talk to you.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,176
I'm not being prejudice.

22
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,009
I just--

23
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:12,842
he's black.

24
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:15,009
I'd like to let you know."

25
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,868
And he was asking--

26
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:20,589
He was asking Frederick Douglass,

27
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:22,849
"What do I do about slavery?

28
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,291
What do I do about the black population?"

29
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,402
And Frederick Douglass comes over to him.

30
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:32,597
He's like, "Hoo! Well,
okay. Abraham Lincoln,

31
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:34,041
I am Frederick Douglass.

32
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,848
I am a former slave who--"

33
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:40,185
And he's like, "Shhhh, I get it.

34
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:42,376
I know. I know who you are.

35
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:43,711
It's been explained to me.

36
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,359
I've been following your career forever.

37
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:49,276
Be quiet. I'm into it. Let's talk."

38
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,529
I will do more about
him, but I will lay down.

39
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,681
My legs are showing.

40
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,888
I wanted to lose weight before this.

41
00:01:57,888 --> 00:02:01,015
Wait, don't show, it's too white.

42
00:02:01,015 --> 00:02:03,431
I wanna lay down and have a drink.

43
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,636
No! You know what I'm gonna do?

44
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:07,594
Frederick Douglass, he's like,

45
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,044
"Guess what, Abraham Lincoln?

46
00:02:09,044 --> 00:02:10,884
I have to tell you three things.

47
00:02:10,884 --> 00:02:13,884
Blacks should fight in the war, too.

48
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:17,869
Black soldiers who do fight in the war

49
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,614
should get equal pay as whites.

50
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:24,093
Three, if they're prisoners of war,

51
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,490
don't fucking kill them."

52
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,847
And Lincoln's like, "Yeah.
I think we can do this,

53
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:33,026
but I just wanna let you know that

54
00:02:33,026 --> 00:02:35,977
I'm just into preserving the Union."

55
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,681
There's a thing about,

56
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:38,906
about,

57
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:39,739
about,

58
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:43,080
about Richard Dreyfuss.

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,369
(laughs) What is his name?

60
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:46,209
(laughs) Frederick Douglass.

61
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,876
I knew it was something similar.

62
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,319
The thing about Frederick Douglass.

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,318
They were good friends.

64
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:55,151
And he--

65
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:57,941
and Frederick Douglass remained an advisor

66
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,524
to President Clinton for years.

67
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:05,649
And word gets back to him like,

68
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,757
"Abraham Lincoln is dead."

69
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,305
Why do I feel like my--

70
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:15,761
I didn't take my pants
off or anything, did I?

71
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,594
- [Man] No.

72
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:17,427
- 'Cause I feel like

73
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:20,220
- I don't have pants on.
- You took your shoes off.

74
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,565
- Oh, 'cause I'm in a dress,

75
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:23,837
but there was a moment
where I took my pants off.

76
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,126
Okay, good.

77
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:28,051
A couple years later,
they're in Washington, D.C.

78
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:28,884
and they're like,

79
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:33,351
"Alright, it's the Lincoln
Emancipation Memorial."

80
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:34,279
And then someone says,

81
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,195
"Hey, Frederick Douglass
is in the audience!

82
00:03:36,195 --> 00:03:37,153
He should speak!"

83
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:38,795
He's an orator.

84
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:41,362
I mean, this is his livelihood.

85
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:43,171
And he gets up.

86
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:45,546
So he did that for awhile
and he did a good job.

87
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,835
Then I--

88
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,315
would go on and do a good job.

89
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:50,148
- [Man] (laughs)
- (laughs)

90
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:53,511
Wait, that was different than that.

91
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:57,011
He says, "I gotta be honest with you guys.

92
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:01,714
Abraham Lincoln was a
white man's president."

93
00:04:01,714 --> 00:04:05,122
Mary Todd Lincoln,
Abraham's wife, is there.

94
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:07,122
And she was there when
he got his head blown off

95
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,146
in the theater, so she's a badass,

96
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:12,634
but it doesn't mean
she's immune to feelings.

97
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:13,467
She's there.

98
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:17,384
So he says, "We had
different views on slavery.

99
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:21,044
We had different views on the
Emancipation Proclamation.

100
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:24,665
We had different views on the war.

101
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:26,751
But he's a great guy, and I respect him

102
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,463
because he listened.

103
00:04:28,463 --> 00:04:32,562
Even if he knew he
couldn't fulfill my wishes.

104
00:04:32,562 --> 00:04:36,526
He brought me in and he fuckin' listened.

105
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,804
Nobody does that."

106
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:39,197
Mary Todd Lincoln comes up to him

107
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:42,697
and goes, "He would've fuckin' loved that.

108
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:47,742
That is exactly his style."

109
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:50,064
And she goes, "Douglass, come 'ere.

110
00:04:50,064 --> 00:04:51,991
I have something for you."

111
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:54,574
Now my head is shutting asleep.

112
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:59,786
Mary Todd said, "I want you
to have Abe's walking stick.

113
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:04,135
His favorite walking stick."

114
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:07,937
I was like, "Thank you
much for the walking stick.

115
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:11,664
I'm gonna do my best to
preserve the honor of it.

116
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:15,241
And I just take it more of
a symbol as a friendship

117
00:05:15,241 --> 00:05:18,158
between you, me, and your husband."

118
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,584
And then he died a few months later,

119
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:31,301
doing what he loves
sticking up for ladies.

120
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,864
And you can't fault him for that.

121
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:41,786
Did I need to do a more story about them?

122
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,900
(dramatic orchestral music)

123
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:11,552
I have a mental illness.

124
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,089
But I don't.

125
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,089
He's the father of the civil rights!
