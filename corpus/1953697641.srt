1
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:42,561
What?

2
00:00:42,663 --> 00:00:44,526
l can't hear you.

3
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,160
Tell me there's no range
in this fucking place.

4
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,717
Yeah, great.

5
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,452
l really need it some way.

6
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,047
Listen, Mike.

7
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,183
l'm stopping in a city
five minutes from here

8
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:01,621
so l can try and call you
back from a fixed phone line.

9
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,013
Jack Stone.

10
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,016
35 years old.

11
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,482
Four of which
spent in lraq.

12
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:52,348
Medal of the Congress.

13
00:04:53,053 --> 00:04:55,677
An expert in
high-risk missions.

14
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,441
A capable man in
every aspect.

15
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,949
So tell me, General.

16
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:04,647
What on earth
makes you think this

17
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:08,041
capable man will accept
a mission like this?

18
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:12,974
ln exchange
for his freedom.

19
00:05:14,484 --> 00:05:18,110
Stone is currently detained
in a six-by-nine-foot cell

20
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:20,183
where he's
serving a life sentence.

21
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,678
What could a man
in his position

22
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,648
desire more
than his freedom?

23
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:28,473
And what's he been
charged with?

24
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:31,472
Treason and murder,
Mr. Secretary,

25
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,773
but l'll spare
you the details.

26
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:39,310
A widower with a
seven-year-old daughter

27
00:05:39,383 --> 00:05:41,372
he hasn't seen
since he was detained.

28
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,048
Still...

29
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:47,981
a capable man with
great strategic skills

30
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,845
a natural leader.

31
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,107
But as l said...
a Mr. Nobody

32
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,546
with no one
left waiting for him.

33
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,442
No one apart
from his daughter.

34
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:03,146
Why do you think he
accepted the mission, sir?

35
00:06:06,382 --> 00:06:09,041
So you're absolutely sure

36
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:10,638
that Stone will carry out
this mission

37
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,806
without
suspecting anything?

38
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:14,712
Absolutely.

39
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,309
l will personally
travel to Romania

40
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,280
and follow the situation closely.

41
00:06:19,982 --> 00:06:22,277
The Romanian government
has already been informed.

42
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,114
Everything will proceed
as planned.

43
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,308
Rojznov is...

44
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,710
nothing more than
a small dormitory town,

45
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:34,374
with the power plant workers

46
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,878
and theirfamilies
in the middle of nowhere.

47
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,708
The explosion will erase any trace
of the laboratory

48
00:06:39,814 --> 00:06:40,871
in the building.

49
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,810
But how can we be sure

50
00:06:42,881 --> 00:06:45,870
that Stone can carry out
this mission on his own?

51
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:47,674
Well, that's simple.

52
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,269
Because he won't be
on his own.

53
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,246
John ''Mad Dog'' McKellen...

54
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,946
AKA, The Specialist,

55
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,374
expert in
explosives and firearms.

56
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,311
He could build
a lethal weapon

57
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:11,311
just with a glass
and a pencil sharpener.

58
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:14,339
To Mr. McKellen, we owe
the explosion

59
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:18,469
of the Congress Palace
of Johannesburg in 1997.

60
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,635
More than 50 people died
in the bombing.

61
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,808
Dragan llic...

62
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:28,702
the sniper.

63
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:31,809
They say during
the Kosovo War,

64
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:34,208
Mr. llic killed
more than 300 people

65
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:37,971
without ever leaving his position, ever.

66
00:07:39,978 --> 00:07:43,137
He could shoot a mouse dead
from over a mile away.

67
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,966
Eden Shizuka.

68
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,935
Unbeatable in
hand-to-hand combat.

69
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:05,873
Now, she will be
indispensible

70
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,806
should our men find themself

71
00:08:07,877 --> 00:08:10,536
in a difficult situation
and low on ammo.

72
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,139
She learned how
to fight from some

73
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,498
scatter brained
monk in Japan

74
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,007
where she'd moved from
Northern lreland

75
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,440
with her mother--
but that's not important.

76
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,207
So l guess
you're gonna tell me that

77
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:23,536
they all have a daughter

78
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,768
- waiting for them at home.
- No.

79
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:27,533
l will tell you,

80
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,632
they will each have
$2 million

81
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,673
waiting in
their bank accounts.

82
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:35,967
They are soldiers of fortune,
Mr. Secretary.

83
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,474
Mercenaries.

84
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,473
They would do
anything for money.

85
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:40,600
So the money we offer them

86
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,675
will help keeping
their mouth shut.

87
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:46,074
At least until they
have left for the mission.

88
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:49,500
How can we be sure that
there will be no survivors?

89
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,041
There could be a family somewhere

90
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:53,131
hidden away,
waiting to be rescued.

91
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:55,169
With all due respect, sir,

92
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:57,002
l would be more worried
should someone divulge

93
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:59,165
what we did to that city.

94
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:01,137
Theoretically, we should not
have been active

95
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,106
in that part of Europe.

96
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:06,866
l urge you to bear in mind
we are very short on time.

97
00:09:08,307 --> 00:09:10,137
We would not be
able to sustain

98
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,433
a possible
virus propagation.

99
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,496
Those... monsters

100
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,367
could eventually
find a way to escape

101
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,996
the security perimeter,

102
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,800
and we don't have a cure.

103
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:24,362
Not since our dear
Doc Neumann passed away.

104
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,136
And there's no trace
of his daughter.

105
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,632
Oh, yes, we
we did search for her,

106
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,798
but, well, the situation
was already critical.

107
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,797
But should we find
that she is still alive,

108
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,702
then we will bring her in.

109
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,795
You can be
sure of that.

110
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:43,438
Now is the time to act.

111
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,802
The ground water
tables have been sealed

112
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:49,898
and the toxicity of the cloud
has vanished.

113
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:54,299
Rojznov has now
been quarantined.

114
00:09:54,372 --> 00:09:56,361
But those things are infected.

115
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:58,295
One would be
enough to infect

116
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:00,338
the whole country in
a matter of hours,

117
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:02,132
and in a few days,
the world!

118
00:10:15,704 --> 00:10:17,330
May God forgive us all.

119
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:35,535
Look at them run.

120
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,596
Just like chickens.

121
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:41,527
Uh-huh.

122
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:43,364
Why run when,
just around the corner,

123
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,799
someone is about to blow up
a nuclear power plant

124
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,424
to exterminate the whole or
whatever them things are?

125
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:53,261
ln fact, they're like
a bunch of rabid dogs.

126
00:11:00,802 --> 00:11:02,791
- Do you know what, Dragan?
- Eh?

127
00:11:03,969 --> 00:11:07,957
This is turning out not to
be a picnic in the park.

128
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,998
You're getting soft,
my friend.

129
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,531
Remember Laos?

130
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,965
lt's never gonna be
worse than that.

131
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:15,998
Aye, l remember.

132
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:20,030
But every time we seem to get
ourselves in bigger shit.

133
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:21,863
C'est la vie,
mon ami.

134
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,798
Just think
about big bucks.

135
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,458
That should set up your
mind with ease.

136
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,761
All soldiers
get ready for evacuation.

137
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,300
Aye, l'll think about it.

138
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:31,994
You know what?
What?

139
00:11:32,102 --> 00:11:33,465
This is my last gig.

140
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:37,657
Let's just blow up
these shitheads,

141
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,265
level this place.

142
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,697
And then l can
get my ass

143
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,831
in a first-class seat...

144
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,123
all the way to
the mountains.

145
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:53,261
l'm gonna open a restaurant
on the beach.

146
00:11:53,768 --> 00:11:54,859
You?

147
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,661
l cannot picture you
wearing a bermuda,

148
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,925
some flowery
Hawaiian shirt.

149
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:02,865
But you do like my haggis
and leeks, don't you?

150
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:03,990
Hell no.

151
00:12:04,134 --> 00:12:05,861
The only thing
your slop is good

152
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:07,830
is for maneuvering
the fields.

153
00:12:08,034 --> 00:12:09,124
Seriously.

154
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,028
l'm no longer
subject for your

155
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:13,861
exotic culinary
experiments.

156
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,364
They always ended up
in a hurricane of shit.

157
00:12:17,966 --> 00:12:19,829
Do you know what?

158
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,695
lt's always with
a skinny-ass like you,

159
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:25,523
as you didn't like eating.

160
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:27,962
l'm so sorry to spoil
your self-glorification,

161
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:30,121
but l love eating,

162
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,890
as much as l care
what happens after.

163
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:34,826
l don't like when
your ''cookings''

164
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,431
get from
my mouth to my guts.

165
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,524
lt's some nasty shit,
believe me.

166
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:42,029
You don't want to know.

167
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:44,360
All personnel
prepare for evacuation.

168
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:46,328
You're right.

169
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:48,359
You're full of shit.

170
00:12:50,964 --> 00:12:52,294
Do you know
there's a saying?

171
00:12:52,364 --> 00:12:53,852
No.

172
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:55,954
lf you do not like eating,

173
00:12:56,431 --> 00:12:58,760
then you probably
don't like fucking, either.

174
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,319
Your mother
never complained.

175
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:07,056
And l'm pretty sure
it was something like,

176
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,127
if you can't cook...

177
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:10,763
you can't fuck.

178
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,928
Well, my friend...

179
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:15,688
l can cook.

180
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:16,956
Yup.

181
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,291
And l can
lick my own balls.

182
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,351
Really?

183
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:24,360
What do you say,
princess?

184
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:29,592
Do you like cooking?

185
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:34,788
l'd love to see you
in the kitchen,

186
00:13:35,196 --> 00:13:37,058
jumping
from pot to pan,

187
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:40,325
with nothing on...

188
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,589
but a teeny-weeny apron.

189
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:48,783
Save a bullet, will you?

190
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,327
Give up, my friend.

191
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:53,087
Women are never very
talkative people like us.

192
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:56,359
Deep down, they know we can
show them paradise

193
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,324
beneath the sheets,

194
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,024
and they feel it
in their guts.

195
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,523
Give up?

196
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,116
Me?

197
00:14:09,427 --> 00:14:10,757
Are you kidding?

198
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,358
Right.

199
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,624
What do you say,
princess?

200
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,656
How about you and me

201
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:28,284
get something on
together...

202
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,690
between the sheets?

203
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,590
All soldiers get ready
for evacuation.

204
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,549
Who the hell is this guy?

205
00:14:56,259 --> 00:14:57,782
Good flight, Lieutenant?

206
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,117
Let's not waste
any more time.

207
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:19,983
We let you in
from here.

208
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,151
You'll be escorted up to

209
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:25,121
the security
containment perimeter.

210
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,490
Once inside, you're on
your own.

211
00:15:30,358 --> 00:15:31,846
Just the way l like it.

212
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,617
The bomb will be
primed by our engineers.

213
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:37,348
You will need to get as close
as possible to the reactor

214
00:15:37,456 --> 00:15:39,184
and get there
as quickly as you can.

215
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,417
Why don't we
go in through there?

216
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:45,422
lt looks a damn sight
easier to me.

217
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,316
lt's too risky.

218
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:50,253
That's the most
populated area,

219
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,650
hence the more likely to be polluted
with the infected.

220
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,255
lt gets better and better.

221
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,283
Obviously,
the area you'll pass through

222
00:15:59,356 --> 00:16:01,686
should be considered safer,
but not safe,

223
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:03,313
so watch your backs.

224
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,387
Be on alert
at all times.

225
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:09,312
You'll take this
side street,

226
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:11,615
which leads directly to
the nuclear power plant.

227
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:17,784
Should everything go as planned
once the bomb is placed,

228
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:21,515
you'll have about an
hour to get back to this base.

229
00:16:21,622 --> 00:16:22,814
One hour?

230
00:16:22,955 --> 00:16:24,148
Bloody hell.

231
00:16:24,288 --> 00:16:26,253
And what happens
if you're late?

232
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,851
The school bus will
come and collect us?

233
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,682
Here, you will find a helicopter
waiting to take you to

234
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,651
a safe military depot.

235
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:36,317
There you will be
held until the dust

236
00:16:36,421 --> 00:16:38,284
from the explosion
is settled.

237
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:40,985
Only at that point...

238
00:16:41,454 --> 00:16:43,579
will the mission be classed
as accomplished.

239
00:16:46,286 --> 00:16:48,684
The answer to your
question, Mr. llic...

240
00:16:49,954 --> 00:16:51,318
if you are late...

241
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:52,579
you die.

242
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:55,986
Considering the sum
we're paying you,

243
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:57,812
a delay
cannot be accepted.

244
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,118
Oh, talking about money.

245
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:09,514
As we agreed,
one million now,

246
00:17:09,952 --> 00:17:12,181
the rest once the mission
is accomplished.

247
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:14,574
Any questions?

248
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,648
Very well.

249
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,011
Mr. Stone, if you please.

250
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,645
l hope at least
you care about

251
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,615
this mission, Lieutenant.

252
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,551
Should the virus propagate,
it would be the end.

253
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:41,846
You must move quickly,

254
00:17:41,953 --> 00:17:43,941
place the bomb
and get out.

255
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:48,182
lt must be made to look
like a terrible accident.

256
00:17:52,285 --> 00:17:54,148
The power plant explodes,

257
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,642
the Rojznov
inhabitants die.

258
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,342
Their country mourns
their loss

259
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,076
and the United States
share in their sorrow.

260
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,016
Nobody will know
any different.

261
00:18:07,284 --> 00:18:09,112
This is your mission.

262
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:11,844
l'm sure you fully
comprehend the situation.

263
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,442
l'm not here to comprehend
anything, General.

264
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,748
l'm here
for my daughter.

265
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:21,946
Of course.

266
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,483
You have my word,

267
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:24,947
you will
hug your daughter

268
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,915
once the mission is accomplished.

269
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:30,612
The case will be closed,
all files will be lost.

270
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:32,340
You'll have
a new beginning, Jack.

271
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,578
Don't try to pull
any smart moves.

272
00:18:38,082 --> 00:18:41,071
We will be watching your
every step via satellite.

273
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,677
Accomplish the mission

274
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,075
and you'll be a free man.

275
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,242
This doesn't look good.

276
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:47,101
What did you expect?

277
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,609
Balloons and bouquets?

278
00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:00,475
Abandon all hope...

279
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:02,773
ye who enters here.

280
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:26,274
l still don't understand

281
00:20:26,344 --> 00:20:28,333
what l'm supposed
to be shooting.

282
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,575
Are they
people or what?

283
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:32,572
Oh... come on, Dragan.

284
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:35,572
Does it make
a difference anyway?

285
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:39,675
Don't tell me you've...

286
00:20:39,778 --> 00:20:42,437
developed a conscience
since we last worked together.

287
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,241
Just trying to make conversation,

288
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,940
considering our
chief, and this one here,

289
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:49,341
talking is going to be

290
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:51,399
the hardest part
of the mission.

291
00:20:51,777 --> 00:20:53,470
You talk enough
for everyone, Dragan.

292
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,802
Say that again?

293
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,103
lf everything goes
according to plan,

294
00:20:56,244 --> 00:20:58,209
we won't have to
shoot anybody.

295
00:20:58,577 --> 00:20:59,974
We go in, we drop the bomb,

296
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:03,599
we get out
and forget about this place.

297
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:05,574
What a bummer.

298
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:07,806
Eh, Dragan?

299
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,932
l bet you were
looking forward

300
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:12,902
to blowing the heads off
some poor, innocent

301
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:15,240
women and children,

302
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,138
like you guys do...

303
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:20,231
in that shitty country
of yours.

304
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:22,898
Right?

305
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:24,463
Why don't you go
and fuck yourself

306
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,802
with a Viking helmet?

307
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:33,407
So what brings
you here, chief?

308
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,471
No offense.

309
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:38,771
But you do not
look like one of us.

310
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:42,438
You look more like...

311
00:21:43,341 --> 00:21:45,329
one of those
Mr. Nice Guys

312
00:21:46,173 --> 00:21:48,765
that helps little old ladies
across the street.

313
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,906
The only
difference is...

314
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,804
you got muscle.

315
00:21:53,907 --> 00:21:55,270
lt has nothing
to do with money

316
00:21:55,307 --> 00:21:56,772
if that's what you're asking,
soldier.

317
00:21:57,741 --> 00:21:59,570
Come on, man.

318
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:01,807
We're all in
this shit together.

319
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,501
The least you can do

320
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:07,663
is tell us what brought you
into this fucking mess.

321
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,103
l was promised
a clear criminal record.

322
00:22:10,407 --> 00:22:12,134
l bring home the mission...

323
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,001
and they cancel
my conviction.

324
00:22:14,106 --> 00:22:15,299
Conviction for what?

325
00:22:15,406 --> 00:22:16,769
Stealing a candy?

326
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,101
Leave him alone,
Dragan.

327
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,163
Come on, chief.

328
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,135
What did you do?

329
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,837
Everything is
allowed in war.

330
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:26,268
Well, almost.

331
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:29,066
Let's share
some secrets, huh?

332
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,468
Want to know what was
the worst thing

333
00:22:30,605 --> 00:22:31,628
l did during a mission?

334
00:22:31,772 --> 00:22:34,738
Will you shut
your big mouth?

335
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:37,101
All right.

336
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:38,237
Have a go.

337
00:22:38,338 --> 00:22:39,804
l jerked off on a goat.

338
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:42,598
Jesus fucking Christ,
Dragan.

339
00:22:43,105 --> 00:22:44,934
Do not swear.

340
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:01,992
There's something wrong.

341
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,057
You can hear
a pin drop.

342
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:10,291
McKellen,
open the gate.

343
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:12,401
And you two stay on board.

344
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,429
Hey, what the hell
he's doing?

345
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,396
The first lesson
of the perfect bomber:

346
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:59,762
always save the explosion
'til the very last.

347
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,821
Come on, man,
where is the fun?

348
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:03,796
Would you cut
the bullshit?

349
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,429
We're sitting on
a prime nuclear weapon.

350
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:08,329
lt's best we get
going, then.

351
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,228
Carter, you remember me?

352
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,761
l'm the president
of the United States.

353
00:25:35,264 --> 00:25:37,593
I'm on my farm here in Texas

354
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:39,989
and instead of playing golf
or whatever,

355
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:41,824
fucking some hookers,

356
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,988
uh, l think about you,
and not in a good way.

357
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:46,427
l hope everything is okay.

358
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,693
Yes, Mr. President.

359
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:52,060
Everything is
going as planned.

360
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:53,952
Any press around,
whatever,

361
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:56,756
l don't want another
CNN feature about me.

362
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,153
And, Carter, don't
fuck it up again,

363
00:25:59,262 --> 00:26:00,592
as in Korea and Vietnam,

364
00:26:00,663 --> 00:26:02,322
almost in
the Second World War.

365
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,952
You remember your father
almost lost the whole war.

366
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,925
No, sir.

367
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:08,922
There won't be
any problems.

368
00:26:08,996 --> 00:26:10,155
l assure you.

369
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:12,124
Everything
will go as planned.

370
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:14,486
Okay, go back to your work,
just forget it.

371
00:26:14,596 --> 00:26:15,993
And maybe l just
push the red button

372
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:17,459
and blow it all up.

373
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:18,585
Bye.

374
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,455
Dragan, get to position

375
00:26:24,595 --> 00:26:26,254
and keep your eye
on everything.

376
00:26:26,395 --> 00:26:27,758
Don't shoot unless
absolutely necessary,

377
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:28,794
and please...

378
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,617
don't fuck it up.

379
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,454
No worry, chief.

380
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:35,618
This what
l do for a living.

381
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,591
And what might
that be?

382
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,323
Fucking things up?

383
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:07,757
McKellen, you take
care of the bomb.

384
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,486
Eden and l will
patrol the area

385
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,253
to make sure there's
no surprises.

386
00:27:11,327 --> 00:27:12,485
Come on.

387
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:13,956
Let's get out of here ASAP.

388
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,390
Just give me
five more minutes, chief,

389
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:19,653
and we'll be strolling away
from this shithouse.

390
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,915
Happy as
a pig in shit.

391
00:27:22,326 --> 00:27:24,155
And rich.

392
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:25,919
And filthy rich!

393
00:28:19,257 --> 00:28:21,222
What the fuck?

394
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,221
Oh, shit.

395
00:28:28,323 --> 00:28:29,755
Shit.

396
00:28:29,823 --> 00:28:30,811
Shit!

397
00:28:30,923 --> 00:28:32,150
Chief!

398
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,282
John?

399
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:44,452
l don't believe it.

400
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,581
l'm gonna kill that
son of a bitch.

401
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:50,144
You want to tell me what
the fuck's going on?

402
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:51,914
We're screwed.

403
00:28:51,989 --> 00:28:53,648
We are royally
screwed.

404
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,482
That's
what's going on.

405
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:56,576
Take a look at this.

406
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:02,418
Jesus.

407
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:04,581
Can't you do
anything about this?

408
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:07,246
Not only is it welded
to the chassis,

409
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,787
but the primer is
deep inside the engine

410
00:29:09,921 --> 00:29:12,217
and that's linked direct
into the timer.

411
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,283
Any interference by me...

412
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,787
and l could slow,
if not stop the program.

413
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,286
Even to look at
this thing...

414
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,818
could cause a problem.

415
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,079
Hey!

416
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:27,982
What are you waiting?

417
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:30,212
Eden...
check the area.

418
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,811
John, if we
can't use this car,

419
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,943
then we need to
find a vehicle

420
00:29:34,053 --> 00:29:35,609
in order to get out of here.

421
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,447
Let's check these warehouses
and see what we can find.

422
00:29:38,553 --> 00:29:41,077
Let's get back to Carter
to show him in full detail

423
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,949
with whom he just
tried to fuck.

424
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:51,814
General, they're in.

425
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,909
Do they have the situation
under control?

426
00:29:53,987 --> 00:29:55,475
Not exactly, sir.

427
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:57,313
Look.

428
00:29:57,419 --> 00:29:59,476
Sir, l think we should
send a message--

429
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:02,746
Don't waste your
energy thinking, Private.

430
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,648
This mission is a success.

431
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:10,082
Those monsters will just
make things easier.

432
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:12,616
Pack everything up.

433
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,115
We're leaving.

434
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:15,207
Yes, sir.

435
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:29,781
Stone, McKellen...

436
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:31,877
20 incoming, 3:00!

437
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:10,143
Come on, come on...

438
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:24,882
Come on...

439
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:53,364
steady, chief.

440
00:33:54,076 --> 00:33:55,939
There are more
of them coming.

441
00:33:56,042 --> 00:33:57,303
How much ammo you got?

442
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:02,636
l got about 12 cartridges
for this piece of shit.

443
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:04,264
That's better than nothing.

444
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,466
Dragan!

445
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:08,872
Move it,
we're out of here.

446
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:15,873
Oh, shit, Jack.

447
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,402
Look!

448
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:23,201
What are you
looking at?

449
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:25,698
Come on.

450
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,970
Decide who's gonna put
a bullet in my head.

451
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,535
l'll do it myself.

452
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,896
l don't want to hurt
your chances of meeting...

453
00:34:39,907 --> 00:34:41,236
my Lord.

454
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,869
Don't make me beg.

455
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:46,697
Do it now.

456
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:54,565
My brother.

457
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,027
So many wars.

458
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:06,893
So many women.

459
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:11,727
We will fight again.

460
00:35:13,305 --> 00:35:15,270
We will fight...

461
00:35:19,138 --> 00:35:20,694
Forgive me,
my brother.

462
00:35:22,638 --> 00:35:23,967
Forgive me.

463
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:29,034
We will meet again.

464
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:46,301
John, let's move out.

465
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,434
John!

466
00:35:49,571 --> 00:35:50,867
We're not gonna
die here today.

467
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:53,764
At least not
before Carter does.

468
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:59,433
lf we're gonna make it to base
before the bomb blows up,

469
00:35:59,538 --> 00:36:00,901
we're gonna have to
go through the city.

470
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:25,734
We're gonna die
in that city, chief.

471
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,360
And we both know it.

472
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:32,535
We have to
get a vehicle.

473
00:36:33,135 --> 00:36:34,465
lt's the only chance we've
got to get back

474
00:36:34,568 --> 00:36:36,262
to the military base
and get the hell out of here

475
00:36:36,368 --> 00:36:38,061
before the shit really
hits the fan.

476
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:42,424
Granted, that is if
we have a working helicopter

477
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:44,398
when we get there.

478
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,428
l seriously doubt Carter
hasn't thought about

479
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:48,557
every single
possible escape route.

480
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:52,125
Aye.

481
00:36:52,234 --> 00:36:55,257
And l swear, if l come
across the son of a bitch,

482
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:57,925
he's gonna have a close
and deep encounter

483
00:36:58,068 --> 00:36:59,090
with my knife.

484
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:09,532
Sir, you should see this.

485
00:37:14,534 --> 00:37:15,624
You're a dreamer, Stone.

486
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,890
Sir?

487
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:22,630
What is it, Private?

488
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:24,460
We just received
a call from the runway.

489
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:27,396
There's a technical problem
with the blades of our helicopter.

490
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:29,828
The mechanic has
already left the base.

491
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:31,928
Damned idiots!

492
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,259
Sir, l alerted the pilot

493
00:37:33,399 --> 00:37:34,592
and he's already
working on it.

494
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,391
He says he can fix it,
he just needs a little time.

495
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,565
Time?

496
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:41,464
That's exactly what we don't have,
you stupid fool.

497
00:37:41,566 --> 00:37:43,622
Do you want us to end up
like those things out there?

498
00:37:43,732 --> 00:37:44,789
No, sir,
but l thought

499
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,455
Then save your excuses

500
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:48,428
and get the helicopter
fixed,

501
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,429
unless you want to
face a court martial.

502
00:37:50,531 --> 00:37:51,555
Yes, sir.

503
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:05,194
lt's a wee bit classy...

504
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,893
but l think it'll do.

505
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:12,195
Of course...

506
00:38:12,564 --> 00:38:14,189
providing the owner's
all right with it.

507
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:17,726
Well, if that
guy's the owner,

508
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,285
l think he'll be just
fine about it.

509
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:20,419
Son of a...

510
00:38:22,063 --> 00:38:25,224
Princess,
you do talk.

511
00:38:25,296 --> 00:38:28,057
The wise only speak
when it's time to speak.

512
00:38:28,129 --> 00:38:29,890
The fool never shuts his
goddamn sewage hole.

513
00:38:32,563 --> 00:38:33,722
Oh, fuck you.

514
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:37,056
Do you know what?

515
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:39,354
My lips get
a little bit loose,

516
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:41,052
especially when
l'm nervous.

517
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:44,424
You must have a very bad case
of chronic nervousness.

518
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:45,893
All right, kids,
shut up and get in,

519
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,258
we're running
out of time.

520
00:38:47,362 --> 00:38:48,726
l'll drive.

521
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,961
lf we just
get out of the city,

522
00:38:57,063 --> 00:38:58,290
we might just have
a chance.

523
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:03,561
And how many of those
ugly bastards

524
00:39:03,629 --> 00:39:04,959
do you think
there are out there

525
00:39:05,063 --> 00:39:06,222
just waiting for us?

526
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,850
There's a lot more of those
than we have ammo for, John.

527
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:14,425
l like your optimism, chief.

528
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:16,085
They don't call me

529
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,693
Mr. Fucking Sunshine
for nothing.

530
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:20,891
These don't need ammo.

531
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:22,523
See?

532
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,026
No problem.

533
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,257
Jesus, chief.

534
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:31,551
This is getting serious.

535
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:36,454
Hey, Scotty.

536
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:37,683
A gift for you.

537
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,518
And what am l supposed
to do with this?

538
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,382
Luckiest son of a bitches
l've ever seen.

539
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,050
lt's no wonder
this government

540
00:41:11,122 --> 00:41:13,111
wants to blow this
shithole up.

541
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:16,787
Going any further without
weapons or ammo is suicide.

542
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,412
Another run-in with a bunch
of those wild creatures

543
00:41:18,523 --> 00:41:19,614
and we're
gonna be joining

544
00:41:19,722 --> 00:41:20,949
their fucked-up family.

545
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:23,851
And where are we gonna
find any ammo around here?

546
00:41:25,188 --> 00:41:27,155
l've got a funny feeling,
chief.

547
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:30,855
A local gun store,
if there ever was one,

548
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,953
is not gonna be
open today.

549
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:34,021
Bingo.

550
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:38,248
Okay, chief.

551
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,479
Watch where
you're driving.

552
00:41:51,954 --> 00:41:52,942
Get inside!

553
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:56,316
Chief!

554
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,710
Who took the smile
off his face?

555
00:42:18,387 --> 00:42:20,046
That's definitely
not a rat.

556
00:42:21,454 --> 00:42:22,441
We've got you
covered, chief.

557
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:23,780
Go get the ammo.

558
00:42:40,553 --> 00:42:41,609
Come on, baby.

559
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:45,382
Where have you been
all my life?

560
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:56,382
For fuck's sake!

561
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,213
Christ...

562
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:26,271
Die!

563
00:44:25,347 --> 00:44:26,574
Who are you?

564
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:29,010
Open the cell
and l'll tell you.

565
00:44:29,614 --> 00:44:31,603
l'm not gonna
ask you twice.

566
00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:34,373
Then we're in a stall,
don't you think?

567
00:44:34,514 --> 00:44:36,377
l'm not saying anything

568
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:38,409
unless you
free me first.

569
00:44:39,047 --> 00:44:40,239
Listen, lady.

570
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:41,538
ln just a little while,

571
00:44:41,646 --> 00:44:43,510
this place is gonna be
like the 4th of July

572
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:44,579
and that cell is gonna be

573
00:44:44,713 --> 00:44:46,679
the last place you
wanna be.

574
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,678
So for the last time...

575
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:49,867
who are you?

576
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:51,171
You know what?

577
00:44:51,246 --> 00:44:52,542
Fuck you!

578
00:44:52,613 --> 00:44:54,875
You men are always
all and now, aren't you?

579
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,178
My name is
Samantha Neumann.

580
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:02,268
Doc Neumann's daughter?

581
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:07,274
Although l doubt you even
know who l'm talking about.

582
00:45:07,379 --> 00:45:11,004
Dr. Herbert Neumann,
toxicologist, immunologist.

583
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,402
Surgeon leader for
Project ''K''

584
00:45:13,513 --> 00:45:15,342
for the US Army.

585
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,977
Another brilliant mind

586
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:19,872
in the bacteriological
warfare.

587
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,978
My father
is not a murderer.

588
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:23,872
Really?

589
00:45:23,946 --> 00:45:25,605
Jesus Christ.

590
00:45:25,712 --> 00:45:27,678
Okay, are you
letting me out or not?

591
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,941
Hey!

592
00:45:34,046 --> 00:45:35,375
Hey, where are
you going?

593
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:37,701
Asshole!

594
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:41,538
l knew it.

595
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:49,738
A "thank you"
would be nice.

596
00:45:50,944 --> 00:45:52,069
Thank you.

597
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,402
Daddy.

598
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:57,001
Now if you'd be so kind
as to introduce yourself

599
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:58,939
and telling me what the hell
is going on here.

600
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,041
Whoa!

601
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:07,871
Nice catch, chief.

602
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:18,765
Hello?

603
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,467
ls anybody gonna bother explaining
to me what's up?

604
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:29,870
lt's a pretty straightforward
fucked-up situation, babe.

605
00:46:31,375 --> 00:46:34,363
Either we get ourselves
300 miles away from here

606
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:35,899
or we're gonna look like

607
00:46:36,009 --> 00:46:37,372
those people
from Hiroshima.

608
00:46:39,042 --> 00:46:40,406
No offense.

609
00:46:40,508 --> 00:46:41,599
We'll explain it
to you later.

610
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:43,541
Right now,
there's no time.

611
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:45,269
Let's move.

612
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:46,897
Not a good idea, chief.

613
00:46:56,374 --> 00:46:58,203
Call the secretary, now!

614
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:00,340
Yes, sir,
right away, sir!

615
00:47:16,874 --> 00:47:18,271
Ah, we're running
out of time, chief.

616
00:47:18,373 --> 00:47:19,532
You're right.

617
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:20,936
Let's get busy.

618
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,437
Can you shoot?

619
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,198
l'm a fast learner.

620
00:47:24,272 --> 00:47:25,762
What?

621
00:47:25,873 --> 00:47:26,861
Come on.

622
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,530
Oh, fuck.

623
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,502
This is my
favorite gun.

624
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:31,999
Let's go.

625
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:34,838
Come on, princess.

626
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,197
Okay.

627
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:46,931
Pay attention.

628
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,595
Check the mag,
make sure you're loaded.

629
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:50,227
Click it back into place.

630
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:52,201
Check the barrel,
you got one loaded,

631
00:47:52,271 --> 00:47:53,362
safety's off.

632
00:47:53,438 --> 00:47:55,336
Point, you're ready to fire.

633
00:47:55,504 --> 00:47:57,368
Don't hit
the convertible.

634
00:47:57,505 --> 00:47:58,493
l'll be careful.

635
00:48:03,705 --> 00:48:05,534
Why were you in there?

636
00:48:05,672 --> 00:48:06,729
A brawl.

637
00:48:06,872 --> 00:48:08,735
ln a bar.

638
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:09,997
You?

639
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:11,071
ln a brawl?

640
00:48:13,837 --> 00:48:15,269
What's so funny?

641
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:17,599
Nothing, ljust can't see you
in a brawl or a bar.

642
00:48:17,705 --> 00:48:19,500
Yeah, well, that's
'cause you don't know me.

643
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,330
l'm Jack Stone.

644
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:35,661
You're wounded.

645
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:36,736
Hang on.

646
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:37,996
Let me look at this.

647
00:48:40,704 --> 00:48:42,431
Jack.

648
00:48:42,536 --> 00:48:44,502
A regular name
for a regular guy.

649
00:48:46,036 --> 00:48:47,866
You sure don't look like
a regular guy, though.

650
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,166
You don't look like
a regular girl.

651
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:53,699
l'll take that
as a compliment.

652
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:59,192
Would you mind telling me
what's going on, Jack?

653
00:49:00,703 --> 00:49:02,566
Sure.

654
00:49:02,769 --> 00:49:05,031
The government wants to
nuke this whole place.

655
00:49:05,102 --> 00:49:07,397
So we brought in
an atomic bomb,

656
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:08,832
put it in
the nuclear power plant

657
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:10,993
and it's gonna go off in
about 30 minutes.

658
00:49:11,102 --> 00:49:12,567
You what?

659
00:49:12,669 --> 00:49:13,657
lt's the only way
they could be sure that

660
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:15,394
the virus wouldn't
propagate.

661
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,397
lt's not a virus.

662
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:19,835
Come again?
lt's not a virus.

663
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:24,266
lt's a cytotoxic toxin

664
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:27,197
secreted by
a "microbiotic" organism

665
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:29,097
synthesized in a lab.

666
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:34,193
My dad is the leader
of the operation.

667
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:35,927
His studies in immunology

668
00:49:36,034 --> 00:49:37,693
had drawn
the attention of the army,

669
00:49:37,767 --> 00:49:39,666
who has funded
his research

670
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,325
with millions of dollars.

671
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,966
The problem is, my father
wanted to save lives

672
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,596
while they just
wanted to destroy them.

673
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:24,322
Anything to report, Doctor?

674
00:50:27,264 --> 00:50:28,696
l'm afraid nothing good,
General.

675
00:50:30,164 --> 00:50:31,892
We succeeded in
controlling the toxin,

676
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:33,395
but the specimens
are showing

677
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,259
an uncontrollable aggressiveness.

678
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:42,020
We're experiencing an
irreparable side effect.

679
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:44,921
The toxin somehow acts on
the cerebral tissues,

680
00:50:45,031 --> 00:50:46,724
destroying any
ability of the specimen

681
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,159
to keep the control over
its own aggression.

682
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,992
lt basically acts on
the nervous connectors,

683
00:50:51,097 --> 00:50:53,063
enhancing ferocity at
an exponential level.

684
00:50:54,697 --> 00:50:57,356
Try putting a steroid rat
into this cage

685
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,093
and in a manner of seconds,

686
00:50:59,196 --> 00:51:01,185
nothing will be left of it.

687
00:51:01,263 --> 00:51:03,594
These other animals are afraid
of this infected specimen,

688
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:05,220
so l must
keep it covered.

689
00:51:05,331 --> 00:51:06,921
Not to mention the...

690
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:08,894
postmortem physical degeneration.

691
00:51:09,363 --> 00:51:11,226
Explain, Doctor.

692
00:51:11,864 --> 00:51:13,727
Well...

693
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:16,989
the toxin kills every
organism at a touch

694
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,086
and at our
current stage of research,

695
00:51:19,196 --> 00:51:20,889
our experimental specimens
are nothing more than

696
00:51:20,996 --> 00:51:22,860
walking dead bodies.

697
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:24,394
Very good, Doctor.

698
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,223
Very good indeed.

699
00:51:26,363 --> 00:51:28,056
Did you not hear what
l just said, General?

700
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:29,718
Of course l did.

701
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:31,725
But people
die in wars,

702
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:33,726
or did you forget that?

703
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,757
Thanks to your discoveries,
Doctor,

704
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:38,851
we can now say we're
working ahead of schedule.

705
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:41,184
And this way, we can avoid
the boring procedure

706
00:51:41,261 --> 00:51:43,592
of notifying
the families of the deceased,

707
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:45,422
am l right?

708
00:51:45,529 --> 00:51:47,517
l'm impressed
by your work, Doctor.

709
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:50,250
You most certainly
are our man.

710
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:54,053
But now the time has
come to take your research

711
00:51:54,162 --> 00:51:55,991
to the next level.

712
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:57,118
Soldiers.

713
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:05,551
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Carter?

714
00:52:05,694 --> 00:52:07,217
The infection rate
is extremely high,

715
00:52:07,328 --> 00:52:08,418
and don't forget,

716
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:09,754
we haven't succeeded
in controlling

717
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:11,849
the cytotoxin's
reaction to oxygen yet.

718
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,750
Do you have any idea
what would happen

719
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:17,759
if the substance comes
into contact with the air?

720
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:18,917
The slightest inattention

721
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:20,754
and the infection
would spread.

722
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,418
Are you out of your mind?
Watch your tongue, Doctor.

723
00:52:23,527 --> 00:52:25,186
Surely you didn't
believe the millions

724
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,249
our government invested
into your research

725
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:29,322
were unsecured, did you?

726
00:52:29,626 --> 00:52:31,887
We want results,
Neumann,

727
00:52:32,026 --> 00:52:34,425
and you seem
ready to give us some.

728
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:37,854
Now... proceed.

729
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:01,554
Carter, for God's sake.

730
00:53:03,091 --> 00:53:04,557
God?

731
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:06,488
Don't be stupid, Doctor.

732
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:08,989
God didn't
create any of this.

733
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:11,916
You did.

734
00:53:16,925 --> 00:53:18,550
What are you
going to do?

735
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:19,918
l don't know, Sam.

736
00:53:20,024 --> 00:53:21,580
l just don't know.

737
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,849
All l know is that l must
put an end to this madness.

738
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,215
l cannot allow that
man to use

739
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:27,914
my research
the way he wants to.

740
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:29,183
l just can't.

741
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,154
Yeah, but how, Dad?

742
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,882
lt's dangerous.

743
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:35,320
Listen, Sam.

744
00:53:35,391 --> 00:53:37,050
Get on the first plane out of here,
just leave the country,

745
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,485
go back to the States,

746
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,055
to your mum's
But, Dad

747
00:53:40,156 --> 00:53:41,213
You don't understand, Sam.

748
00:53:41,356 --> 00:53:42,480
lt's my fault.

749
00:53:43,756 --> 00:53:45,221
lt's my fault,

750
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,185
and l'm the only one that
can do something about it.

751
00:53:47,256 --> 00:53:49,585
l have to do something
about it.

752
00:53:49,689 --> 00:53:52,382
l need you to get as far
away from here as possible.

753
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:54,250
lt's not safe here
anymore.

754
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:56,185
That madman is
liable to do anything.

755
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:58,850
Just leave, please!

756
00:54:00,155 --> 00:54:01,246
And don't try

757
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:03,344
and contact me
for any reason.

758
00:54:04,022 --> 00:54:05,010
l'll stay in touch.

759
00:54:05,088 --> 00:54:06,248
Okay.

760
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:09,118
Okay.

761
00:54:10,489 --> 00:54:11,546
l know l can't
say antyhing

762
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:12,655
to make you
change your mind.

763
00:54:12,756 --> 00:54:15,721
Just... promise me

764
00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:17,083
you'Il be careful.

765
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:20,553
l promise.

766
00:54:31,755 --> 00:54:34,380
My father tried to stop
the research at any cost.

767
00:54:35,687 --> 00:54:37,086
But it was already too late.

768
00:54:38,688 --> 00:54:40,517
He'd created
what they wanted.

769
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:42,150
A deadly weapon.

770
00:54:44,353 --> 00:54:46,251
So he secretly synthesized
a vaccine,

771
00:54:46,353 --> 00:54:48,183
certain that,
sooner or later,

772
00:54:48,254 --> 00:54:49,844
it would have been indispensable.

773
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:48,979
So thanks to your father,

774
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:50,176
that bite mark
didn't turn you

775
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:52,045
into one of those things.

776
00:55:52,184 --> 00:55:53,877
He injected me
with a vaccine

777
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,142
when he realized
how dangerous

778
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,477
what he was doing was.

779
00:55:58,516 --> 00:56:00,415
l know he's got
a solution

780
00:56:00,517 --> 00:56:02,380
for what's
happening here, too.

781
00:56:03,484 --> 00:56:05,382
My father can stop all this.

782
00:56:05,483 --> 00:56:06,915
He's probably working
at it this very moment.

783
00:56:07,017 --> 00:56:08,881
Sam.
Believe me, Jack.

784
00:56:09,183 --> 00:56:10,842
He can stop it all.
Sam.

785
00:56:13,983 --> 00:56:15,039
Yourfather's dead.

786
00:56:16,516 --> 00:56:17,742
He killed himself.

787
00:56:19,016 --> 00:56:20,880
lt was in the file
General Carter gave me.

788
00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:22,209
Freeze!

789
00:56:24,182 --> 00:56:25,807
Drop the gun!

790
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,814
You don't understand.

791
00:56:28,081 --> 00:56:29,206
l have to do this.

792
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:46,537
He probably couldn't accept
the responsibility

793
00:56:46,648 --> 00:56:48,012
for what he caused.

794
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:51,740
l'm sorry.

795
00:56:52,848 --> 00:56:53,871
Chief!

796
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,139
l've got a good idea!

797
00:56:55,214 --> 00:56:56,646
What's the plan?

798
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,145
You know what
a pile of shite looks like

799
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,180
with flies around it?

800
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:02,646
l'm gonna create
a big pile of shite.

801
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,577
You're gonna have to
trust me on this one.

802
00:57:17,514 --> 00:57:18,672
Go!

803
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:36,510
Have you got
any aspirin, chief?

804
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,603
l think they're gonna need it.

805
00:57:37,713 --> 00:57:38,679
Sam.

806
00:57:38,812 --> 00:57:40,005
Are you all right?

807
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,543
l think so.

808
00:57:43,847 --> 00:57:45,709
You did good back there.

809
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:47,535
We're gonna make it,
you'll see.

810
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:48,669
Are you wounded?

811
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:49,734
No, l'm okay.

812
00:57:49,846 --> 00:57:51,209
lt's just
a scratch.

813
00:57:51,312 --> 00:57:53,302
lf you don't mind me interrupting

814
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,542
you two lovebirds,

815
00:57:56,145 --> 00:57:57,475
l think we've got
a wee problem.

816
00:58:14,845 --> 00:58:16,367
What do you think?

817
00:58:16,478 --> 00:58:17,569
Aye.

818
00:58:17,678 --> 00:58:19,234
Of course l can do it.

819
00:58:19,344 --> 00:58:20,900
But you need to
give me some time.

820
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:23,170
John, time is one thing
we do not have.

821
00:58:23,244 --> 00:58:25,335
Two minutes, that's all
l need is two minutes.

822
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:44,142
What brought you here?

823
00:58:44,243 --> 00:58:46,141
lt's a long story.

824
00:58:46,477 --> 00:58:48,999
l bet you don't
have time to tell me, right?

825
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:50,735
l don't think you want to
know why l'm here.

826
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:52,831
lf l didn't
want to know...

827
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:54,502
l wouldn't have asked.

828
00:58:59,476 --> 00:59:00,635
lt's about her.

829
00:59:02,575 --> 00:59:03,974
lt's all for her.

830
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:07,140
You saved my life.

831
00:59:09,109 --> 00:59:10,301
l'm good with it.

832
00:59:21,508 --> 00:59:22,996
lncoming!

833
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:26,568
John, my friend,
whatever you're doing,

834
00:59:26,675 --> 00:59:27,731
do it fast!

835
00:59:31,141 --> 00:59:32,663
Will ya slow down, chief?

836
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:33,729
l'm getting old.

837
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:49,405
Time's up, John!

838
00:59:49,506 --> 00:59:50,529
Everyone in the car!

839
01:00:02,339 --> 01:00:03,634
Fuck!
Oh, shit!

840
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:04,797
Everybody out!

841
01:00:04,873 --> 01:00:05,861
Now!

842
01:00:22,006 --> 01:00:23,472
No!

843
01:00:35,238 --> 01:00:37,670
No, no, no!

844
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,133
Jack... Jack!

845
01:01:05,837 --> 01:01:07,736
l can't hold them off
for long, guys!

846
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,303
Eden, come on!

847
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:20,993
lf we don't stop
for gas soon,

848
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:23,296
we're gonna run out
and we'll be on foot.

849
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:26,864
Jack, there!

850
01:01:27,004 --> 01:01:28,196
Ah, so easy.

851
01:01:52,868 --> 01:01:54,629
Sam, get out
and fill up the tank!

852
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:55,826
John, help me push!

853
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:16,360
Zombies!

854
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,323
Shit!

855
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:26,859
Get back, Sam.

856
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,063
Grab the dog
and follow me!

857
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:40,894
Shit!

858
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,465
Come on, get inside!

859
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,527
So who the fuck
are y'all?

860
01:02:55,632 --> 01:02:57,824
l said who
the fuck are y'all?

861
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:03,824
You got a problem?

862
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:05,793
lt's nothing
l can't fix.

863
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:09,058
Don't play with him.

864
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:11,027
Come on,
it's okay.

865
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:13,024
l'm Jack Stone.

866
01:03:13,131 --> 01:03:14,528
This is Eden.

867
01:03:14,631 --> 01:03:16,064
This is Sam.

868
01:03:16,164 --> 01:03:18,130
This irresistible bastard
is Mad Dog.

869
01:03:20,065 --> 01:03:21,724
What about you?

870
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,025
You don't exactly
look like

871
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:24,563
a Romanian
factory worker to me.

872
01:03:24,665 --> 01:03:25,721
Doug.

873
01:03:25,831 --> 01:03:27,888
Doug Mulligan,
entrepreneur.

874
01:03:28,964 --> 01:03:30,521
Shit.

875
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:33,597
We was on vacation 'til
those freaks turned up.

876
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:35,862
And, hell, we was
having a good time, too,

877
01:03:35,998 --> 01:03:37,827
weren't we, sugar pie?

878
01:03:38,063 --> 01:03:39,154
This here is Claire,
by the way,

879
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:41,161
and the dog's lndiana.

880
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:43,362
She don't
talk a whole bunch,

881
01:03:43,464 --> 01:03:45,952
but believe me, she got many fine
hidden qualities.

882
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,486
Don't take it personally,
big fella.

883
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,994
She's been the silent type
since her psycho brother

884
01:03:56,063 --> 01:03:58,392
killed her entire
family with a hammer.

885
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,493
Ma, Pa, little brother.

886
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,352
Yeah, it's some
pretty bad shit

887
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:03,724
and she's a brave girl.

888
01:04:05,563 --> 01:04:07,529
l want to thank you again
for what you did outside.

889
01:04:07,629 --> 01:04:09,152
l appreciate that.

890
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:11,125
Secondly,
and most importantly,

891
01:04:11,463 --> 01:04:13,452
we've got to get
out of here.

892
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:15,119
Now, what's your
van situation like?

893
01:04:15,229 --> 01:04:16,319
Well, shoot.

894
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:18,724
The tank's as empty as
your friend's skull here.

895
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:20,488
l was hoping to fill her up

896
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:22,528
and those freaks
turned up again.

897
01:04:22,629 --> 01:04:24,322
l know if we wait it out
and stay real hushed

898
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:25,725
that they're gonna fuck off.

899
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,294
They don't seem
too bright.

900
01:04:27,362 --> 01:04:28,827
That's not an option.

901
01:04:28,895 --> 01:04:31,360
l wasn't joking when l said
we have to get out of here soon.

902
01:04:37,728 --> 01:04:39,353
An atomic fucking bomb?

903
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,657
Here?

904
01:04:43,061 --> 01:04:44,959
You're shitting me, right?

905
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:47,556
Well, what the fuck
are we going to do now?

906
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,523
General Carter's plans
include our deaths,

907
01:04:49,627 --> 01:04:51,490
so here we are.

908
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,151
l'm sorry we got
you and Claire

909
01:04:53,227 --> 01:04:55,125
involved in this, Doug.

910
01:04:55,227 --> 01:04:56,817
Shit.

911
01:04:56,894 --> 01:04:58,189
l thought this was
gonna be a nice,

912
01:04:58,293 --> 01:04:59,554
relaxing trip,

913
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:02,956
but no, those goblin
donkey fuckers...

914
01:05:03,894 --> 01:05:06,451
Always gotta mess with an
honest man's piece of mind!

915
01:05:09,059 --> 01:05:10,888
Shit!

916
01:05:10,993 --> 01:05:12,823
lf we're gonna die together,

917
01:05:12,926 --> 01:05:14,983
we might as well die with
no hard feelings.

918
01:05:15,093 --> 01:05:16,422
Drink up, my friend.

919
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:20,956
The amber nectar.

920
01:05:26,225 --> 01:05:27,815
l didn't have
any hard feelings.

921
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:31,454
Friend.

922
01:05:34,992 --> 01:05:36,821
What now?

923
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:38,323
l don't know.

924
01:05:40,224 --> 01:05:41,485
l really don't know.

925
01:05:43,157 --> 01:05:44,987
l guess l'm never gonna
open that restaurant.

926
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:48,484
Sorry, Dragan.

927
01:05:48,591 --> 01:05:49,851
At least
we die with honor.

928
01:05:51,657 --> 01:05:53,179
You guys
being serious?

929
01:05:54,658 --> 01:05:56,520
No.

930
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,789
No, we can't give up.

931
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:02,116
Not while that timer
is still counting down.

932
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:04,122
lf we die here,

933
01:06:05,224 --> 01:06:07,553
Carter will have it
all his own way

934
01:06:07,657 --> 01:06:09,350
and nobody...

935
01:06:09,457 --> 01:06:11,945
no one will ever
know the truth.

936
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,483
The airport is close.

937
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:19,148
We still have enough
time to get to it.

938
01:06:19,223 --> 01:06:20,280
We have to get to it!

939
01:06:21,624 --> 01:06:23,453
The world needs to know
what happened here.

940
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:27,289
Please.

941
01:06:28,657 --> 01:06:29,623
Please?

942
01:06:29,723 --> 01:06:31,349
She's right.

943
01:06:31,456 --> 01:06:33,718
Fuck, l don't even know who
this Carter guy is,

944
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,153
but if this
fucked-up shit is down to him

945
01:06:36,223 --> 01:06:37,348
then l certainly want to
give him

946
01:06:37,457 --> 01:06:39,513
a very large
piece of my mind.

947
01:06:39,623 --> 01:06:41,486
Fuck, l hate uniforms!

948
01:06:41,989 --> 01:06:43,614
They're all
fucked in the head!

949
01:06:46,156 --> 01:06:47,553
No offense, fellas.

950
01:06:47,656 --> 01:06:49,383
But you gotta put yourself
in my shoes, okay?

951
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:52,454
l-- l nearly
died today, hmm?

952
01:07:02,455 --> 01:07:04,716
Honey pie, you still
pointing that thing at me?

953
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:06,310
My God, the way
you carrying on,

954
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:07,887
the only memory you're gonna

955
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:11,477
have of this entire trip
is gonna be my ugly mug!

956
01:07:15,454 --> 01:07:18,216
Well, at least it looks
like this goddamn rain

957
01:07:18,321 --> 01:07:20,014
is finally quitting.

958
01:07:20,121 --> 01:07:21,848
Ahh...

959
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:23,714
You should
point this thing out,

960
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,309
get some of this amazing
foreign scenery,

961
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:29,113
'cause, you know-- you know,

962
01:07:29,187 --> 01:07:31,948
l think we are very
close now, you know.

963
01:07:32,053 --> 01:07:33,518
l think we're
almost there.

964
01:07:33,653 --> 01:07:34,812
Are you ready?

965
01:07:34,953 --> 01:07:36,715
l said,
"Are you ready?"

966
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,843
To meet the one,

967
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:41,044
the only,
Count Dracula!

968
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,812
Oh, what is this now?

969
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,316
Shit.

970
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:57,941
Stay in the van,
honey pie.

971
01:08:05,651 --> 01:08:07,447
Can you hear me,
sweetheart?

972
01:08:13,684 --> 01:08:14,877
You okay?

973
01:08:19,318 --> 01:08:21,806
Oh, what the fuck?!

974
01:08:28,118 --> 01:08:29,447
Honey pie!

975
01:08:37,116 --> 01:08:38,105
Oh, Jesus, God!

976
01:08:39,317 --> 01:08:40,782
What the fuck?!

977
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:44,213
Get the shit out of my life,
you fucking crazy

978
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:48,209
You...

979
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:56,947
Next time, honey...

980
01:08:57,315 --> 01:08:58,646
keep your eyes open!

981
01:09:04,982 --> 01:09:06,811
l kid you not.

982
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,676
l almost did a little poo.

983
01:09:10,382 --> 01:09:11,678
We're gonna have to
thin down their number

984
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:12,803
if we're gonna get
out of here alive.

985
01:09:14,315 --> 01:09:15,780
Doug, how many bullets
do you have left?

986
01:09:18,314 --> 01:09:19,974
Just two, l'm afraid.

987
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:23,376
Maybe we could
draw their attention

988
01:09:23,482 --> 01:09:25,277
like we did back at
the police station.

989
01:09:26,948 --> 01:09:28,209
How?

990
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:34,145
Holy shit!

991
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:35,373
l can't get a clear shot!

992
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:36,469
Fuck you!

993
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,013
Oh my God,
sweetness!

994
01:09:38,114 --> 01:09:40,672
No, no, fuck you!

995
01:09:42,448 --> 01:09:43,778
Honey pie!

996
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:46,978
No!

997
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:52,212
Jesus Christ, put the gun down,
darling, please?

998
01:09:52,314 --> 01:09:54,143
Please, sweetheart,
put the gun down,

999
01:09:54,214 --> 01:09:56,009
we'll be fine, we'll
we'll get you to a doctor,

1000
01:09:56,114 --> 01:09:58,102
l swear, you'll be fine,
sweetheart, please!

1001
01:09:59,814 --> 01:10:00,871
No!

1002
01:10:00,981 --> 01:10:02,810
Sweetie pie, no!

1003
01:10:04,447 --> 01:10:06,208
Nothing l can do...

1004
01:10:06,313 --> 01:10:08,176
Oh, God.

1005
01:10:08,447 --> 01:10:09,673
Sweetie pie.

1006
01:10:10,147 --> 01:10:12,135
Oh, please...
oh, God.

1007
01:10:12,213 --> 01:10:14,008
Jesus.

1008
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:15,136
lf you got any good ideas

1009
01:10:15,247 --> 01:10:17,576
left in that
brain of yours, chief,

1010
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,936
now is the time to
come up with it.

1011
01:10:20,045 --> 01:10:21,012
Without gassing up
the truck,

1012
01:10:21,146 --> 01:10:22,611
we're not going anywhere.

1013
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:25,539
Maybe we can find
a vehicle around here

1014
01:10:25,646 --> 01:10:27,635
to get out of here with.

1015
01:10:27,812 --> 01:10:28,869
Maybe...

1016
01:10:30,278 --> 01:10:31,870
just maybe

1017
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,206
we've still got a chance.

1018
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,039
l still love you
so much, my sweetie.

1019
01:10:35,145 --> 01:10:37,043
What do you have
in mind?

1020
01:10:39,311 --> 01:10:41,210
You're gonna have to
trust me on this one, chief.

1021
01:10:44,478 --> 01:10:46,137
Princess.

1022
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:47,677
How far to
the airport?

1023
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,004
Five miles at the most.

1024
01:10:50,644 --> 01:10:53,668
l'm gonna try and buy you
as much time as possible.

1025
01:10:53,812 --> 01:10:55,674
Godspeed, my friend.

1026
01:10:56,278 --> 01:10:57,334
John...

1027
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:01,440
Oh, God, no...

1028
01:11:02,311 --> 01:11:04,038
Mad Dog.

1029
01:11:04,144 --> 01:11:05,302
l'll be fine.

1030
01:11:06,943 --> 01:11:09,341
How are we gonna
know when to get out?

1031
01:11:09,444 --> 01:11:11,306
You'll know.

1032
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:12,875
My friend...

1033
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:14,204
you'll know.

1034
01:11:17,977 --> 01:11:19,772
Jesus Christ.

1035
01:11:21,009 --> 01:11:22,169
No!

1036
01:11:35,476 --> 01:11:37,805
And what are you
doing here, Princess?

1037
01:11:38,142 --> 01:11:39,630
Time to get
serious, John.

1038
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,197
Serious?

1039
01:11:41,308 --> 01:11:43,104
Don't you think the timing's
a little bit off?

1040
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,440
l think you should go,

1041
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:52,231
before l get...
other ideas.

1042
01:11:56,108 --> 01:11:58,165
General Carter will get
what he fucking deserves.

1043
01:11:58,308 --> 01:11:59,500
Come on, now.

1044
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:01,334
Get it together, man,
get it together.

1045
01:12:01,474 --> 01:12:03,338
Oh...

1046
01:12:03,608 --> 01:12:04,869
Fuck!

1047
01:12:07,307 --> 01:12:09,136
Come on,
you motherfuckers!

1048
01:12:09,207 --> 01:12:10,298
Come on!

1049
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:14,304
Jack, just go!

1050
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:15,601
Go!

1051
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,197
All right, let's go!

1052
01:12:47,607 --> 01:12:49,470
Doug!

1053
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,628
l'm gonna cut your friend
the General's eyelids off,

1054
01:12:53,706 --> 01:12:56,036
staple this here photo
to his forehead,

1055
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,166
while l gut
him like a boar!

1056
01:12:59,273 --> 01:13:00,431
We'll get him.

1057
01:13:12,205 --> 01:13:14,103
Ugh, Dragan...

1058
01:13:14,873 --> 01:13:16,429
l think l'm gonna
need you on this one.

1059
01:13:24,104 --> 01:13:27,162
Come on then!

1060
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:28,702
Ya wee shits!

1061
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:32,164
Run, Eden, run!

1062
01:13:32,271 --> 01:13:33,429
Never!

1063
01:13:35,571 --> 01:13:36,968
John, Eden,
come on!

1064
01:13:37,104 --> 01:13:39,661
Get out of here!

1065
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:40,997
God, God

1066
01:13:45,136 --> 01:13:47,000
lt is...

1067
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:50,793
time to meet again!

1068
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:04,624
Drive!

1069
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:36,266
General!

1070
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,657
What is it, Private?

1071
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,097
They stopped just outside
the city's perimeter.

1072
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,697
Orders, sir?

1073
01:14:46,801 --> 01:14:49,131
Tell the special forces
to be ready.

1074
01:14:49,467 --> 01:14:51,330
l want the girl.

1075
01:14:51,434 --> 01:14:53,195
Kill the others.

1076
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,856
ls the helicopter ready?

1077
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,521
Yes, sir.

1078
01:14:56,633 --> 01:14:57,691
Let's go.

1079
01:14:57,801 --> 01:14:59,027
We're running
out of time.

1080
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:00,429
Yes, sir.

1081
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:41,822
How many shots
do you have left?

1082
01:15:41,932 --> 01:15:43,522
Still just the two, Jack.

1083
01:15:43,632 --> 01:15:45,291
God, l tried to get 'em
to breed, but, you know,

1084
01:15:45,432 --> 01:15:47,125
they just ain't
in the mood.

1085
01:15:47,232 --> 01:15:48,426
Damn.

1086
01:15:48,499 --> 01:15:49,590
You have more
in common with John

1087
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:51,494
than just a shitty attitude.

1088
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:52,892
What's the plan?

1089
01:15:54,631 --> 01:15:56,859
l say we get out there,
we kill Carter.

1090
01:15:58,799 --> 01:16:00,196
Let's go.

1091
01:16:32,697 --> 01:16:33,663
Well, well.

1092
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,353
l'm impressed.

1093
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:37,792
l've got to give you
credit, Stone.

1094
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:39,827
l underestimated you.

1095
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,123
lt's a pity.

1096
01:16:42,196 --> 01:16:43,786
l could have
used a man like you.

1097
01:16:47,028 --> 01:16:49,017
And who's this...
hero?

1098
01:16:50,462 --> 01:16:52,485
Put the toy down.

1099
01:16:54,062 --> 01:16:55,153
Put it down, Doug.

1100
01:17:01,262 --> 01:17:02,319
lt's all right, girl.

1101
01:17:02,462 --> 01:17:03,791
He gonna get his.

1102
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:06,625
You let her go.

1103
01:17:08,294 --> 01:17:09,521
Or l will kill you.

1104
01:17:12,294 --> 01:17:14,953
You're in no position
to be giving orders.

1105
01:17:15,294 --> 01:17:17,123
We placed the bomb.

1106
01:17:17,194 --> 01:17:19,250
My mission...
is accomplished.

1107
01:17:21,294 --> 01:17:23,192
Give me back my daughter
and let us go.

1108
01:17:24,527 --> 01:17:25,993
What more do
you want from us?

1109
01:17:26,094 --> 01:17:27,320
Her.

1110
01:17:28,427 --> 01:17:29,620
What?

1111
01:17:29,759 --> 01:17:30,885
You're much more precious than

1112
01:17:30,994 --> 01:17:33,118
you think you are,
Ms. Neumann.

1113
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:34,453
You hold within yourself

1114
01:17:34,627 --> 01:17:36,956
the secret of your
father's great work.

1115
01:17:37,126 --> 01:17:38,989
l don't understand.

1116
01:17:39,093 --> 01:17:40,956
Your blood.

1117
01:17:41,193 --> 01:17:43,125
From that,
we will synthesize

1118
01:17:43,193 --> 01:17:44,954
your father's vaccine

1119
01:17:45,026 --> 01:17:47,514
and Project "K" can continue
without any more

1120
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:49,455
unfortunate accidents.

1121
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:52,857
lsn't it
a pity there's no room

1122
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,925
for your new friends
in our helicopter.

1123
01:17:57,292 --> 01:18:00,155
l think we can allow
the little family reunion.

1124
01:18:03,426 --> 01:18:05,085
Christine...

1125
01:18:05,192 --> 01:18:06,919
in exchange
for Ms. Neumann.

1126
01:18:07,959 --> 01:18:09,618
After all, we're not
monsters.

1127
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:14,613
Ms. Neumann.

1128
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:19,449
Jack.

1129
01:18:20,924 --> 01:18:22,082
Shit.

1130
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,454
Come here.

1131
01:18:38,124 --> 01:18:39,646
Well...

1132
01:18:39,791 --> 01:18:42,154
l think it's time we were
leaving, gentlemen.

1133
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:48,284
Jack, run!

1134
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:51,020
Go, get them!

1135
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:17,280
All right, honey.

1136
01:19:17,423 --> 01:19:18,854
You stay right here,
and remember,

1137
01:19:18,956 --> 01:19:21,319
be really quiet, okay?

1138
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:22,786
Jack.

1139
01:19:24,289 --> 01:19:27,846
You hold lndiana, she's
gonna keep you safe, okay?

1140
01:19:27,956 --> 01:19:29,114
They're a-comin'.

1141
01:19:29,188 --> 01:19:30,620
We gotta go.

1142
01:20:09,087 --> 01:20:10,609
Let's do this
Alabama style!

1143
01:20:29,853 --> 01:20:30,841
Come on!

1144
01:20:30,953 --> 01:20:32,316
You bastard!

1145
01:20:49,252 --> 01:20:50,581
l told you
l hate uniforms.

1146
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:00,716
Come on!

1147
01:21:03,617 --> 01:21:04,674
Okay, honey,
you go with Doug

1148
01:21:04,784 --> 01:21:06,113
and run to the chopper.

1149
01:21:06,183 --> 01:21:07,445
l'm gonna go
look for Sam.

1150
01:21:09,851 --> 01:21:11,612
Jack, run!

1151
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,806
No!

1152
01:21:21,916 --> 01:21:22,973
Shit!

1153
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,946
Come on,
gotta keep up!

1154
01:21:37,417 --> 01:21:39,110
Go, Sam,
get to the helicopter!

1155
01:21:45,949 --> 01:21:47,779
Holy shit!

1156
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:00,781
l don't know
where the hell you from,

1157
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,179
but l know this is
gonna hurt!

1158
01:22:14,248 --> 01:22:16,111
Take that,
you son of a bitch!

1159
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,441
Yeah!

1160
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,943
You know, in the end...

1161
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,773
that bastard got
what he wanted.

1162
01:22:46,179 --> 01:22:48,077
How do you mean?

1163
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:49,935
The general's dead.

1164
01:22:50,013 --> 01:22:51,501
Ain't shit left of him.

1165
01:22:51,613 --> 01:22:53,340
Or the evidence.

1166
01:22:53,446 --> 01:22:55,309
l mean, come on, Doug.

1167
01:22:55,779 --> 01:22:57,642
Who's gonna
believe our story?

1168
01:22:58,179 --> 01:23:00,577
l wouldn't be so sure
of that, little miss.

1169
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:06,411
l'd sure as hell like
to see 'em deny this.

1170
01:23:07,479 --> 01:23:08,774
Ahh, Jesus, God...

1171
01:23:10,012 --> 01:23:11,279
What the fuck?!

1172
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,744
Get the shit out of my life,
you fucking--

1173
01:23:15,245 --> 01:23:17,836
You know, my old man
always used to say,

1174
01:23:17,945 --> 01:23:19,844
men don't learn shit
from their mistakes.

1175
01:23:21,278 --> 01:23:23,141
Anything
that happened once...

1176
01:23:24,412 --> 01:23:26,309
bound to happen again
sooner or later.

1177
01:23:26,411 --> 01:23:28,673
Well, Doug,
l don't know if a few men

1178
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:30,301
can make a difference,

1179
01:23:30,412 --> 01:23:32,434
but sometimes it can be enough
to just kick the right ass

1180
01:23:32,544 --> 01:23:33,737
at the right time.

1181
01:26:08,806 --> 01:26:12,267
Come on, ladies.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
