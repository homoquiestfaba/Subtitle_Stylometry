1
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:29,013
What's wrong with you?

2
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,791
Sometimes I dream.

3
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,349
Dream? About what?

4
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,957
It's dark

5
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,058
there's a woman crying.

6
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,495
Do you wanna do it again?

7
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,199
OK

8
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,578
Phil!

9
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,555
Aw! Sick.

10
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,903
Still got it.

11
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,902
Stay back.

12
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,310
You, you killed him!

13
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,470
Shut up.

14
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,429
Who are you?

15
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,160
Who was that large cocked man?

16
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,997
That was no man.

17
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,972
That was something far worse.

18
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,405
What was it?

19
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,111
How the hell are you still alive ?

20
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,479
What are you talkin' about?

21
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,912
The water!

22
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,850
The water.

23
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,717
What water?

24
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,919
You don't know about the water?

25
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,591
What are we gonna do?

26
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:43,062
The first thing you gonna do is shut the
fuck up and sit down.

27
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,931
Let me think what we gonna do.

28
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,998
Stay right here ladies.

29
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,125
Who are you?

30
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,423
Misandra

31
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:25,731
They call me Phil

32
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,734
Phil O'Ginny

33
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,861
It's Irish.

34
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,796
When did it happen?

35
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,745
Twelve days ago

36
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,081
Everything I ever loved...

37
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,151
Everything anyone ever loved...

38
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,346
It all went to hell.

39
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,010
We are so in love

40
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,511
To us,

41
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,147
Fuck anybody who's not in love like we are

42
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,782
Must be fags

43
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,444
Total fuckin' queers

44
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,468
Yield beast!

45
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,513
Hey babe,

46
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,219
Can you fix me a glass of water please?

47
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,187
Of course.

48
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,484
Thank you.

49
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,431
Thanks babe.

50
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,137
So how was your day?

51
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,372
It was good, it was good.

52
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,041
Hey you know that uh...

53
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,810
that picture I have of you in my wallet?

54
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,277
Yeah?

55
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,117
I totally beat off to it during my lunch break.

56
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,957
Ugh...

57
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,492
What's wrong?

58
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:17,997
I... I don't feel so good.

59
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,760
I don't...

60
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,966
I hate women!

61
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,664
Ugh... I'm so fucking thirsty

62
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,838
I'm almost out.

63
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,146
I know of a well,

64
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,815
It might be un-tainted.

65
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,283
You can come with me...

66
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,218
but you've gotta pull your weight.

67
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,254
If all shit goes to hell,

68
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:53,817
I will not hesitate to kill you and eat your
dead body for sustenance. Understand?

69
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,263
You'll eat my corpse if you have to...

70
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,027
Good. Lets go.

71
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,312
That nice-boobed girl! We have to help her.

72
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,520
No!

73
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:30,385
No!

74
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,332
Nooooo!

75
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,701
She was so hot!

76
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,636
Damn you!

77
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,263
You son of a bitch!

78
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,250
Get some rest.

79
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,454
Ah!

80
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,082
Shut up Pussy!

81
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:24,369
Fuck! I'm so fucked!

82
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,499
How long until we get to that well you were
talkin' about?

83
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,368
Soon, maybe a day.

84
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:35,669
I just really don't want to have to drink my
own piss.

85
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,082
I'm going to look for food, stay here.

86
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:17,483
Phil? Phil O'Ginny?

87
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,985
Mr. Johnson?

88
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,162
They call me Houdini now.

89
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,763
Who?

90
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,594
Meet my crew!

91
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,129
Browneye!

92
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,896
Balloon Knot!

93
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,534
Chili Dog!

94
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,368
Suave Daddy!

95
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,942
Pink Sock!

96
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,738
and Alligator Fuckhouse!

97
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,743
It's nice to meet you.

98
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:57,558
I have proven my leadership abilities by
excelling in various forms of hand to hand
combat.

99
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,165
This fist is legend.

100
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,934
A legend in fisting!

101
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:06,939
Yes. This fist has gotten me
out of many tight jams,

102
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,941
and into them,

103
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,009
repeatedly,

104
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,911
again and again.

105
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,277
It is a good fist.

106
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:19,785
So! How did a boy like Phil O'Ginny,

107
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,154
never suited up a day in his life,

108
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,624
possibly survive the end of society?

109
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,626
Ironic isn't it?

110
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,027
I guess

111
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,197
Must of been luck that's
kept you alive this long.

112
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,866
Yeah? Well what about you?

113
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,265
Me ?

114
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,641
I've been training for this day my whole life.

115
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,538
Broken hearts and lonely eyes

116
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,675
are raining down from the empty skies

117
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,078
I didn't see the imminent demise

118
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,415
of our love once on the rise.

119
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:26,618
Lightning striking in the
depths of my soul

120
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,222
cracking thunder waking ghosts of old

121
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,358
now the thoughts of the love you sold

122
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,020
are driving me crazy and taking hold.

123
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,832
I tried to tell you

124
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:43,335
but you didn't listen.

125
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,172
You can only push it so far
(that's what she said)

126
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,572
I'll bury you in the sky.

127
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,613
I fuckin' told you!

128
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,449
I can be a mean man.

129
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,353
You crossed me for the last time.

130
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:07,292
Again, I'll bury in the sky!

131
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,067
We'll meet

132
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,231
within the shadows of love.

133
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,078
Shirts and skins boys!

134
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,815
Shits and skins...
Hey Anderson take your shirt off!

135
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,385
I said take it off!

136
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,012
Mmmm!

137
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,556
Mr. O'Ginny,

138
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:14,320
n o uniform again.

139
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:19,064
Do you know what grade you have in this
class O'Ginny?

140
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,867
You have a zero,

141
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:25,604
a fucking zero.

142
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:30,075
Do you have any idea how insanely
pathetic that is?

143
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,600
How many years you been held back now?

144
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,684
What the fuck is wrong with you?

145
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:43,142
Seriously, I wanna know.

146
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:50,984
You are a limp-dick pathetic husk of a man!

147
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:55,634
I just thought you should know that.

148
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,904
Hey Anderson I swear to god
you chubby fuck

149
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:01,239
if you don't fix that corner

150
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:04,697
I'm gonna fucking ram my fist up your ass!

151
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,283
It's about time bitch!

152
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,930
Are we gonna be alright Papa?

153
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,433
It's ok son, we'll be alright.

154
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,835
But I'm scared.

155
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,236
I'm scared too,

156
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,572
but don't worry, we'll get out of here

157
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:36,174
You're mother didn't die just so we could be
stuck in this...

158
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,211
No!

159
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,546
I have to get my son out of here!

160
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:44,850
I have to get my son!

161
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,984
No!

162
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,315
Papa!

163
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,877
Fuckin' stupid shit,

164
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:15,480
God damn ridiculous fucking... shit.

165
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,182
So did you like the movie ?

166
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,783
No.

167
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,656
What?

168
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,459
Yeah. It's your fucking grandpa.

169
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,227
I hate that asshole.

170
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:30,785
Hello?

171
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:36,432
Oh my god. Oh my god.

172
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,113
What's wrong babe?

173
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,944
Are you hurt?

174
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,474
My grandma died.

175
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,757
I loved her so much.

176
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,792
So you're not hurt?

177
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,267
No, why do you keep asking me that?

178
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,202
I just want to make you feel better.

179
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,610
But you're not...

180
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,477
What?

181
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,612
Hurt.

182
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:24,049
No, what the hell is wrong with you?

183
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,985
I know, I know what'll help.

184
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,183
What are you doing?

185
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,949
I'm gonna give you something to cry about.

186
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,097
Don't worry, don't cry
I promise it'll make you feel better

187
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,065
I love you.

188
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,192
Get the fuck away from me!

189
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:45,370
Bitch!

190
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:51,673
If I fucking give you something to cry about
you won't have a reason to cry anymore.

191
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,814
Daddy?

192
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:28,905
Daddy.

193
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,217
Are you hurt?

194
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,645
Why are you crying?

195
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,365
I'll give you something to cry about.

196
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,822
Look a girl!

197
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:11,982
Let's gang rape her!

198
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,260
Woh woh woh, she's with me.

199
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,296
You guys are joking right?

200
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,231
Gang rape is not a joke.

201
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,567
We take it very seriously.

202
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,401
Have you ever gang-raped before?

203
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,962
Out of this world...

204
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,970
Houdini...

205
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:34,779
You see Phil, there is no society anymore

206
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,041
Gang rape's OK now.

207
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:39,410
Back off! Back off bro!

208
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,386
You know what you are man?

209
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,989
You're a cock blocker, a filthy cock blocker.

210
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:48,481
You're right, I am a cock blocker.

211
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:54,356
I'm the best cock blocker that I know.

212
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,097
And you know what?

213
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,630
All your cocks

214
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,867
just got blocked.

215
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,612
Nobody blocks my cock!

216
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,266
Shirts and skins boys

217
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,600
Shirts and skins...

218
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,163
It's just not an apocalypse without a circle
of death!

219
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,823
Who are you?

220
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,729
They call me Ludas!

221
00:31:44,335 --> 00:31:47,099
I guess I should thank you.

222
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:49,733
You could.

223
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,610
Thanks.

224
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:57,570
You are in need of water,
come with me if you want to get it.

225
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,045
Did you really need to rip off his face?

226
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,159
Justice is cruelty and pain.

227
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,787
I'm sorry if you don't like it!

228
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,390
Well... to the water then?

229
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,769
I guess I don't have a choice.

230
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:06,005
This, is my friend's parent's basement.

231
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,684
This place...

232
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,420
This place has been my sanctuary
and my savior.

233
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:26,137
I lied. There is no water here.

234
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,940
Only wine.

235
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,900
This wine has nourished my body and
drowned my soul.

236
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,115
It is untainted.

237
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,084
A gift from god perhaps.

238
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,388
Life is a dark chasm,

239
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:47,191
No hope, no light.

240
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:52,196
In the world before it was easy with our
distractions and laws,

241
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,927
to think of the world as a good place.

242
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,803
The truth,

243
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:03,763
the truth is that the world is
cold, dark, and loveless.

244
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,866
I would have killed myself...

245
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:12,305
had this wine not taken the
edge off of my madness.

246
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,576
The horror that I bore witness.

247
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:22,126
That unfathomable, unknowable,
illimitable, insidious...

248
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,696
ultimate horror paralysis that I experienced,

249
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:30,401
was truly of a hideous dream nature.

250
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,599
Do you have any of that wine you were
talking about eariler?

251
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,842
Very well.

252
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:46,539
Let us partake of this winey goodness.

253
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,111
Let us not forget our sins.

254
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,568
It is aged and good.

255
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,062
Totally.

256
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:11,768
And now my fellow travelers,

257
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:16,443
I will tell you my story.

258
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,349
I must.

259
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,216
You will hear, you will hear and take heed.

260
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,754
It all started...

261
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:27,747
back when I had a face.

262
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,235
So I've uh...

263
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,906
been thinking about the future a little bit...

264
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,374
Hey! Hey look at this bro.

265
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:23,073
Holy shit, this is some great fucking work!

266
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,583
We're close,

267
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,312
very close.

268
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,991
You never seise to amaze me my friend.

269
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,925
Yeah,

270
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,096
thanks, yeah.

271
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:51,801
Fuck! Fucking gay pen.

272
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:55,141
Here, use mine.

273
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,329
Oh, is this a gel pen?

274
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:12,296
Yeah.

275
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,798
Gel pens are great.

276
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,288
Yeah.

277
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,858
Thanks.

278
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,746
Dude.

279
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,387
Yeah?

280
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,422
When we're famous scientists,

281
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,858
We are gonna get some
mad fucking pussy.

282
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:44,395
Really?

283
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,464
Oh yeah,

284
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:51,424
fucking girls will be like lining up in droves
to suck our cocks.

285
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,771
I don't know if that's true.

286
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,573
I mean,

287
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:58,167
how many girls want to
suck your cock now?

288
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,313
Uh, probably none.

289
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:06,350
Maybe uh, Gina kinda likes me.

290
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,352
Oh no, fuck that bitch.

291
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,555
I'm talking about super hot bitches.

292
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,559
Girls that really know how to suck a cock.

293
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,129
I don't really know any women like that.

294
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,687
You will,

295
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,701
when we're rich and famous...

296
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:27,471
it will be some serious, total...

297
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,907
balls-to-the-wall cock sucking.

298
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,604
It's just the way it is.

299
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,349
Alright, I'm gonna do it.

300
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,817
Are you ready?

301
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,352
Yeah, yeah OK.

302
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,386
Are you sure?

303
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,622
This, this is gonna hurt.

304
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,352
Nah no just a little... little tickle.

305
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,382
Alright, OK.

306
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:54,332
Alright, I'm gonna do it on three.

307
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,959
One...

308
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,392
Two...

309
00:38:58,636 --> 00:38:59,637
Alright I can't do this.

310
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,305
No I'm not gonna do this. Never...

311
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,174
What are you a fucking pussy?

312
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,768
You wanna be a famous scientist?

313
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,206
Yeah.

314
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,642
You promise this isn't gonna hurt?

315
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,714
I promise.

316
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,159
Alright just do it.

317
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,685
Just do it quick.

318
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,113
First off I want to make sure that none of
you are faggots.

319
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,116
Are you a faggot?

320
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,054
No? OK good.

321
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,698
What do you have ?

322
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,066
You see...

323
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:07,470
we extracted the chemical from the male
body that controls penis function.

324
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,074
With it we can...

325
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:13,210
stimulate the dick receptors inside the balls

326
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:16,747
and therefore super-charge the cock itself.

327
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,308
Astronomically increasing
the subject's chances

328
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,855
of getting his cock sucked.

329
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,720
Here's our initial findings.

330
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,496
Whow, that's amazing.

331
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:33,564
I mean...

332
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,362
I'm not saying I have a small dick or
anything, cause I don't!

333
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,894
But uh.. man, this is good.

334
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,007
I have this friend, his name is Jim,

335
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:46,544
Jim, Jim, lets call him that.

336
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,612
Well he's got this litte tiny rod

337
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,214
of a piece of shit dick that

338
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,205
no woman would ever want to fuck!

339
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,409
And he, I mean I, I mean he, fuck!

340
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,657
He would love it,

341
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:01,215
I'll give you the funding.

342
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:51,698
That's us! That's our penis enhancer!

343
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:02,778
I just wanted to let you know I accepted a
job at Questor University

344
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,723
It was a really good opportunity and...

345
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,248
I can't be a lab assistant forever

346
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,623
I just wanted to let you know.

347
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,898
I won't forget you.

348
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,072
Gina wait...

349
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,605
Wait.

350
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:43,883
Sure, yeah, go, that's good.

351
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:53,537
You know I'm really starting to doubt your
commitment to the project.

352
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:56,006
I'm just saying theoretically,

353
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:59,543
couldn't we just find a chick who would
bang us both at the same time without

354
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,845
actually having to be rich and famous.

355
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,248
Like uh... like a skank or something.

356
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,383
Everybody knows

357
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,185
that the existential mysteries of life

358
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,521
are revealed though material possessions

359
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,455
and monetary gain.

360
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,757
You fucking idiot!

361
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,017
Sometimes you're so stupid.

362
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:29,039
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

363
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,337
Yeah, it's ok.

364
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:33,735
Bro...

365
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,606
Yeah?

366
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,911
I love you.

367
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,680
What was that?

368
00:43:44,588 --> 00:43:45,816
Drew?

369
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,658
Drew are you down here ?

370
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:48,692
No.

371
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,060
Listen uh, Drew...

372
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,463
were you and your friends
messing around with my wine collection?

373
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,831
No dad.

374
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:58,902
You know how much I was
looking forward to drinking that
1983 Campbell Farms Merlou.

375
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,371
Fuck you.

376
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,239
What have I told you about language son?

377
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,069
Come on.

378
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,464
So anyway...

379
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,303
How are the experiments going?

380
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,049
We're only on the verge of a major
scientific break-though.

381
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,448
Mmhmm...

382
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,087
So you say all this stuff's gonna help me
grow a bigger Johnson huh?

383
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,757
No dad, you don't get any.

384
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:21,392
Well I mean I've got a pretty good one now,

385
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,493
but uh,

386
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,596
I could stand to use another eight
or nine inches right?

387
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,697
Yeah...

388
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:28,932
I mean who couldn't? Right son?

389
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:29,633
But uh,

390
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:31,435
when you guys get rich and famous,

391
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,469
send over some of those hot ladies

392
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:33,404
you're always talking about

393
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:34,462
to your old man alright?

394
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:39,510
You don't get any of my rich guy pussy
when I'm rich, you're done with pussy.

395
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,778
Oh come on son,

396
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,871
now watch the language alright?

397
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:45,641
No!

398
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,444
We have to put a stop to Cockzantium.

399
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,378
Oh really?

400
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,249
I have a vision,

401
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,912
a dream of what could be
thanks to Cockzantium.

402
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,657
And I'm not just stroking egos here boy
we're creating a whole new world.

403
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:03,927
A utopian society where all men
are of equal value

404
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,996
and all women will tremble before the

405
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:09,796
might of our raging, throbbing, cockage.

406
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,398
Collective bonerage.

407
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:16,373
And all will be well,

408
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,042
and everyones cock will be sucked!

409
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,043
People are dying!

410
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,078
We have to put a stop to it.

411
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,273
No one's gonna stop anything ever again.

412
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,111
I've seen what Cockzantium can do.

413
00:46:27,017 --> 00:46:30,214
We must thrust it upon every oraphus of
society immediately.

414
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:35,647
This remote will double penetrate
Cockzantium into the water supply.

415
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,762
Rendering huge boners,

416
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:39,630
raging cocks...

417
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,397
Don't you do it!

418
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,265
But I must.

419
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,163
You don't have to!

420
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,636
I can't, but I will.

421
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,967
Why?

422
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:49,199
Because...

423
00:46:57,915 --> 00:47:00,440
I was too late.

424
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,734
Hey this is Gina I'm not home right now

425
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,603
so leave a message and I'll call you back,

426
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,331
thanks.

427
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,431
Hey gina, it's Ludas,

428
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,870
I know we haven't talked in a while,

429
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,913
I just wanted to call and check up on you

430
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:31,505
see if you're doing good.

431
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,115
and I wanted to say that uh...

432
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,256
I just wanted to tell you,

433
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:42,054
I just, I wanted to tell you that,

434
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,961
that you're the most

435
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,930
beautiful girl in the whole world.

436
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:53,529
That I love you, I love you Gina, I love you.

437
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:59,498
Donald, No! I love you!

438
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,181
Oh my god!

439
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:16,827
They did it, they poisoned the water!

440
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:20,228
They did it, they poisoned the water!

441
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,225
Who did it? Who tainted the water?

442
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:29,706
It was me, I caused The Taint.

443
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,074
We should kill him.

444
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,709
You're a two faced snake!

445
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:33,911
Double-crosser.

446
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,046
You're gonna die two-face.

447
00:48:36,046 --> 00:48:39,277
Do you know how much piss I'm gonna
have to drink because of you?

448
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,942
His punishment should fit the crime.

449
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,981
He can't be two-faced without a face.

450
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,216
That is the end of my story.

451
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,290
I caused The Taint

452
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:03,727
Why didn't they fucking kill you
you fucking lesbian?

453
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,028
You fucking deserve to die

454
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,897
You think I don't know that?

455
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,399
I searched for a cure

456
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,635
But you wouldn't like what I found

457
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:14,037
My dreams are filled with terror

458
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:17,165
What fills your dreams with dread, Phil?

459
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:23,368
Nothing, nothing at all

460
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,272
Anderson, what the fuck

461
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,907
you chubby piece of shit

462
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:58,670
keep your eye on the ball!

463
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,003
So what've you got for me today O'Ginny?

464
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,683
Wow.

465
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,088
Do you know what I think of this?

466
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,025
Do you know what I think of this

467
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,686
note from your doctor?

468
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:27,598
That's what I think of it you lazy bitch.

469
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,235
Seriously,

470
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,768
what the fuck is wrong with you O'Ginny?

471
00:53:35,345 --> 00:53:36,835
Gym,

472
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,347
it just ain't my subject.

473
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,392
Let's take a walk.

474
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,010
Phil.

475
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,170
Sandy.

476
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:09,638
Oh,

477
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,640
your shoes are looking good today.

478
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,510
Phil, um, I need to talk to you.

479
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,922
OK, what?

480
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,925
Um, not here.

481
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:26,294
Listen uh,

482
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,760
I think you just gotta let it go babe.

483
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,661
Phil we need to talk alone, now.

484
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,074
Ugh, god.

485
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:42,012
All you bitches, all of em, all the time.

486
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:45,846
Always fuckin' giving me shit and... fuck.

487
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:50,086
Ugh... god.

488
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:51,888
Fine!

489
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:53,981
Lets fuckin' uh...

490
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,556
Lets go!

491
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,757
Talk to you later.

492
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,969
Um can we go to your house ?

493
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,808
Sure, sure.

494
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:18,279
Listen Sandy, we're over.

495
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:22,146
We've been over for a long time now,

496
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:24,714
but if you want,

497
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:25,816
I'll fuck you.

498
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,717
Shut up.

499
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,283
I'm serious.

500
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,292
Yeah, no thanks.

501
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,211
So, Sandy,

502
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,406
what is the big deal?

503
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,650
What is this secret?

504
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,685
You love me ?

505
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,525
I'm pregnant.

506
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:38,895
With what?

507
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,988
Your baby asshole!

508
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,730
But...

509
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,198
We can still can still fuck right?

510
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:52,939
Fuck you.

511
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:00,784
Are you sure that it's?

512
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,981
Some of us don't sleep around.

513
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,339
I want an abortion.

514
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:26,509
But,

515
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:29,612
the government just made abortions illegal,

516
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,978
how's that gonna work?

517
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,745
You're gonna have to do it.

518
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,191
I don't want to.

519
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,326
You did this, you do it!

520
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:45,794
This is such bullshit.

521
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:01,735
OK, I'll do it.

522
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:05,839
My dad gets home in two hours.

523
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,248
Do you have any coat hangers?

524
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,664
All plastic... fuck.

525
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,141
What kind of a loser doesn't have metal
coat hangers?

526
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,006
Don't judge me.

527
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:38,004
Oh wait...

528
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:45,889
Alright go wash it off.

529
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,291
What you think I got filthy coat hangers?

530
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:51,260
Well if it's going in my pussy go wash it off.

531
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,067
Make sure to use anti-bacterial soap.

532
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,600
What?

533
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,633
Make sure to use anti-bacterial soap.

534
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,209
I don't have any.

535
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,770
Ultra-Concentrated is gonna have to do.

536
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:18,776
It's time.

537
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,417
You know,

538
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,113
I really believed me when
you said you loved me.

539
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:54,389
If it makes you feel any better,

540
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,483
I believed me too.

541
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:13,102
Oh sick.

542
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,877
Where'd the condom go?

543
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:25,421
We're all Misogynists.

544
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,724
I love women, I love them.

545
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:31,455
Men do two things exceedingly well,

546
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:34,389
Busting a nut, and killing people.

547
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,890
If you can't do one, you do the other,

548
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:43,206
and if we're lucky
we do both at the same time.

549
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:47,043
It was my arrogance and my sin

550
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,841
that brought this plague onto the earth.

551
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:52,281
But it was here long before

552
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,112
and will be here long after.

553
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,343
We can't fight it, no.

554
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:58,454
Not anymore.

555
01:00:58,454 --> 01:01:01,457
Phil, there's something I have to tell you.

556
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,982
That wine we drank tonight,

557
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:05,928
It's...

558
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:06,763
tainted!

559
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:07,491
No!

560
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,399
I'm not a Misogynist.

561
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,498
I'm not, I can't be.

562
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,002
I don't crush women's heads with rocks.

563
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,306
I can't.

564
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,317
I won't.

565
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,080
Oh god.

566
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,183
You're not a Misogynist.

567
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,055
You did what she wanted you to do.

568
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:41,489
You're not like those monsters out there.

569
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:45,430
But you will be, you will be.

570
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,428
I will.

571
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,477
How did you become such a cool and
amazing woman?

572
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,069
When I was a kid,

573
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:00,917
My father told me, that I was just as smart,

574
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:04,478
as strong and talented as any man.

575
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:10,093
That I, as a woman, can be a statement.

576
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:14,030
That my personality, my character

577
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:18,990
Can be the solution to all sexual
inequalities in American society

578
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,538
That I, as I stand here

579
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:26,743
can embody everything any woman could
ever possibly achieve.

580
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:28,941
You're right!

581
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:46,017
You misogynistic son of a bitch.

582
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:48,906
(Sad music)

583
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,863
If you're tired of having a

584
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:31,066
withered, shriveled, pathetic, tiny penis,

585
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,668
cal your doctor today

586
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,837
and ask him about Cockzantium

587
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:37,704
It's about time you did something about
your penis.
