1
00:00:38,355 --> 00:00:42,355
* SAVATE *

2
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:06,805
Stand up!!

3
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:42,040
You lost your hat, Yankee.

4
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:36,975
I am not a yankee.

5
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,599
Go away.

6
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,179
Bravo! Bravo!

7
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:10,448
Thank you very much, sir.

8
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:18,568
Attention!

9
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:47,038
He is alive! Thank God.

10
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,035
Can he get up?

11
00:09:59,423 --> 00:10:05,020
Damn Yankees.
Kane, the war is over.

12
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:07,656
Give me some water.
Water...

13
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:10,154
Give me water.

14
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:18,425
Maybe Benedict should know.

15
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:22,049
He's a human being,
he deserves help.

16
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:26,597
Thank you. It's ok

17
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:30,013
I am very happy, miss.

18
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:31,346
What did he call you?

19
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:33,897
I don't understand,
in a foreign language.

20
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:37,327
He must be a bandit,
crossed the border.

21
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:38,838
Very well, thank you.

22
00:10:38,864 --> 00:10:41,153
I don't think he's French.

23
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:44,875
French, Mexican,
everything is the same for me.

24
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:49,034
Will you help me or not?

25
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:46,177
When I get back,
he better go.

26
00:12:00,598 --> 00:12:04,768
Thank you Madam.
Here if you get hungry.

27
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:11,042
Sorry,
you must have dropped this.

28
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,337
That's weird.

29
00:12:37,745 --> 00:12:39,090
Everything is good.

30
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,552
You will get hurt,
Miss Mary.

31
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:48,837
You need help?

32
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:52,267
No, thank you.

33
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,771
Now, a beautiful lady like you,
shouldn't be working.

34
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,405
Do not be shy.

35
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:04,496
Lift it up!

36
00:13:09,586 --> 00:13:14,227
Come, I will help you.
No!

37
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:17,603
I do not accept negative responses.
Please stop.

38
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,636
Leave her alone, Mitch!

39
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:22,943
I just wanted to help.

40
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:28,371
I told you to leave her
alone and get out of there!

41
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:32,021
How do you intend to carry
out that command, like that?

42
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:52,882
I'm moving, no!

43
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,736
Bastard!

44
00:14:25,587 --> 00:14:28,101
Blow up, Slim! Ah!...

45
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,787
Don't interfere, stranger.

46
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:04,040
Come back. Let me go?

47
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,610
Come on, stranger.

48
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:38,140
I will show you now.

49
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:51,257
High! Stay where you are!

50
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,908
Give up Mitch.

51
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:09,355
Miss Mary, Kane.

52
00:16:09,997 --> 00:16:13,050
I hope you will accept my offer.

53
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:15,722
I am not selling.
Everything is for sale.

54
00:16:15,748 --> 00:16:18,886
Forget Benedict.
The answer is no"!

55
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,190
Why don't you make a deal,
Kane?

56
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:24,889
You, I don't know you!
What's your name?

57
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:28,754
Charlotte,
sir. Joseph Charlerogne.

58
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,809
Charlerogne, French, huh?

59
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:33,156
And what are you looking
for here in my city?

60
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:36,333
Maybe you would come
to my tournament?

61
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,137
Well interested sir.

62
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:43,563
Yes, I'll make sure you
don't do anything else.

63
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,570
Thank you, Mr. Charliogran.

64
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,733
And what are you looking at?

65
00:17:00,772 --> 00:17:03,723
We saw this
in a soldier's fight.

66
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:09,278
Last month, another stranger,
a blue guy,

67
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,837
he killed three while
playing poker at Carson.

68
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:13,608
Lots of spider!

69
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:17,387
Are you sure?
She said, she said.

70
00:17:17,632 --> 00:17:21,399
Why don't you do
something smart?

71
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,773
Mr. Charlotte!

72
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:33,083
I want to thank you.
Glad you stopped me.

73
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:36,566
Otherwise, he would have
killed them. No doubt.

74
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:42,984
Sir, are you hungry?

75
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,691
Maria is a great cook.

76
00:17:50,546 --> 00:17:52,831
What is the name
of this foreign boxing?

77
00:17:53,717 --> 00:17:55,036
"SAVAT"

78
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,800
How? Savat.

79
00:17:59,366 --> 00:18:00,686
Shopping!

80
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:04,595
Yes it is!...
It's French boxing.

81
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:08,896
Did the French invent?
Boxing like boxing.

82
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,744
There is nothing good
in a fight.

83
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,182
Female business.
He doesn't understand anything.

84
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:21,109
Thank you God,
for the food you give us.

85
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:24,662
Help me to know
your commandments

86
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:27,118
and don't give up on kindness.

87
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:32,664
Help me to avoid greed
and to serve you with humility.

88
00:18:33,148 --> 00:18:36,725
Bless us a new friend,
who saves us from the bullies.

89
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,022
We will live in peace forever.

90
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:41,983
Amen. Amen.
Amen.

91
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,691
Maria, you will make
the future groom happy.

92
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,724
I know I need to take
care of my own life...

93
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,801
but what about you
in the desert and Rio Grande?

94
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,671
There he howls at deserters.

95
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:59,106
I assure you that
I am not a deserter.

96
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,822
What are you doing
in San Miguel?

97
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:04,397
Because of the tournament?

98
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,126
I'm just passing.

99
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:09,681
Too bad, the reward is great.

100
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,275
Hm!

101
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,977
Dinner was great, miss!

102
00:19:26,093 --> 00:19:28,900
Especially an apple
pie from the ground.

103
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,944
Earth apples?

104
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,958
Ah...
of potatoes.

105
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,094
Many! Well many!

106
00:19:38,484 --> 00:19:41,113
All food comes from
the land of this farm.

107
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:44,707
Not much, but it's ours.

108
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:46,300
What is your goal?

109
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:52,003
I do not!...

110
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:57,497
I'm looking for a friend.

111
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:00,502
Are you sure, he's here?

112
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:07,089
Nowhere else.

113
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,500
Kane! Zakarias is coming.

114
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:40,550
Zakarias, Riel, yes...

115
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,569
It's okay, he's our friend.

116
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:49,341
We have to tell you something.
What Zakarias...

117
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,373
We sold our land
to Benedict.

118
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:54,703
Damn it! And now?
How much did he pay you?

119
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:57,054
100 silver dollars.

120
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,234
100 dollars?!

121
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:02,347
Zakarias did you sell your soul,
for 100 dollars? Kine!

122
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:08,026
Otherwise, we would not have
property taxes for the season.

123
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,595
In the morning you will understand,
if you were afraid!

124
00:21:12,621 --> 00:21:16,027
Can't you wait one day?
Who will guarantee me,

125
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:19,407
Won't he poison our water
and steal our winnings?

126
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,435
You don't understand anything!
Damn Benedict!

127
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:26,696
Without evidence, we are helpless.
Don't start again!

128
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:29,990
With or without Benedict,
I'm sorry.

129
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,777
What gives this.
We're leaving.

130
00:21:34,262 --> 00:21:38,316
Take care, okay.
God blessed you.

131
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:41,707
And you. Bye!

132
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:46,364
We will!

133
00:21:54,684 --> 00:21:56,542
What are you doing,
Kane?

134
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:02,211
The colonel is asking us,
100 dollars.

135
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,343
Otherwise, I lose the country.

136
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,599
There is no one to complain to.

137
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,515
Jim, we survived the war.

138
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,557
We will survive this too.

139
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,827
Did you turn to the law?

140
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,725
We filed a complaint
a month ago.

141
00:22:20,613 --> 00:22:23,262
The colonel should,
give us an answer tomorrow.

142
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:28,889
However, nothing from the Great Dane.
I will not leave the country.

143
00:22:34,743 --> 00:22:36,210
Benedict.

144
00:22:36,717 --> 00:22:39,256
Jim, don't touch the gun!

145
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:42,392
I do not allow shots to
be fired on my property.

146
00:22:58,052 --> 00:23:01,779
What do you want, Benedict?
I come with the latest offer.

147
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:06,198
I'm not asking for $ 100.
It won't be worth 50 tomorrow.

148
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,198
You are very confident.

149
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,971
Look, you are insignificant
in comparison to all of Texas.

150
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:13,459
And I don't care,
what makes the difference to me!

151
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:15,982
He is trying to help you,
as well as others.

152
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:17,227
We are natives.

153
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:19,768
We don't need your help,
thank you.

154
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,234
Get off my land!

155
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,574
Dress on my property.
Leave her!

156
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:30,151
Mitch, come on?

157
00:23:43,282 --> 00:23:45,601
Mitch!
Get off the property!

158
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:47,827
Mitch, I'm moving,
I'm warning you!

159
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:55,949
It's the end!
Now you will see...

160
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,635
Stop! No, you will hurt.

161
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:14,208
Son of a bitch!

162
00:25:23,727 --> 00:25:27,132
This one broke my arm!
Break my arm!

163
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:34,366
Wait! But why!

164
00:25:35,505 --> 00:25:37,827
I am a businessman,
not a murderer.

165
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:42,090
My patience has a limit.

166
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:44,878
The people told you:
get out of your land.

167
00:25:44,904 --> 00:25:46,578
I'm trying to be reasonable.

168
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:50,298
If any blood is spilled,
it certainly won't be mine.

169
00:25:51,265 --> 00:25:52,768
Keep that, Mitch.

170
00:25:56,985 --> 00:26:00,560
For horses.
Let's get out of here, now

171
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:23,292
We have to be tougher with them.
Watch out, Mary!

172
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:29,980
People are panicking.
Power is strength. Aou.

173
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:32,897
Why is Benedict going
to need so much land?

174
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:34,732
I dont know.

175
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:39,635
It came to an end after the war,
full of money.

176
00:26:40,304 --> 00:26:42,143
Thinking,
you can buy everything.

177
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:47,259
Do you have, as they say, a Sheriff?
Sheriff?

178
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:51,743
A single law, which sold its
own weapons and land.

179
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:58,339
I'm going to sleep.
I'm too tired.

180
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:08,443
Give him my clean clothes.

181
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,749
Good night. Good night.
Good night.

182
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:25,929
I think it will do, for you.

183
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,555
Where did you get that?

184
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:35,170
I was bitten by a shark.

185
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:40,385
Let me, wash your shirt.

186
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,039
Thank you and good night,
Miss Mary.

187
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:52,434
Put that knife away before
it hurts anyone, Slim.

188
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:56,568
Do you think French
is dangerous?

189
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:58,718
I will beat him.

190
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,398
You think? Yes.

191
00:29:03,106 --> 00:29:06,600
If you hadn't stopped me,
I would have killed you already.

192
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:13,496
Do not.

193
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:16,433
I want you on our side.

194
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,863
This is my plan,
so we can have everything!

195
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,556
For him.

196
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,016
No, give it to me.

197
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,459
We will. Oh...

198
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:31,934
Oh, ah! We will.

199
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,308
Come on, come on!

200
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:18,716
April 11 Reference
to the Texas Court.

201
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:23,459
Considered by a federal court
responsible for Texas territory

202
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,553
She's distracted. No!

203
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:30,497
How legally dispensed?

204
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:33,208
Quietude! Quietude!

205
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:35,847
Under Texas law,

206
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:39,576
which allows me to make
the following decision:

207
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:46,250
Gains are taxed,
for red skins and others,

208
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,568
The state of Texas,
increasing properties,

209
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,416
for all the locals,

210
00:31:52,442 --> 00:31:55,479
in 1,000 dollars

211
00:31:59,074 --> 00:32:00,724
This is too much.

212
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:05,372
I cannot pay much.
Sit down!

213
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:12,576
Texas's failure to pay rights
leads to land confiscation,

214
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:17,660
which will be confiscated,
in favor of Texas and resold.

215
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:24,967
How do you dare!

216
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:28,866
Worked, cultivated, and now
you're taking my land away?

217
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:36,824
I tried everything,
but that is Washington's order.

218
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:42,377
Taxes must be paid by
the 4th of July holiday.

219
00:33:06,712 --> 00:33:08,605
You heard the colonel.

220
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:14,650
Now, my offer is $ 50,
per family.

221
00:33:21,545 --> 00:33:24,166
You know where to find me.

222
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,867
I will sell.

223
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:58,068
At least I want to go,
to Clifornia.

224
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,396
People! Think!

225
00:34:04,118 --> 00:34:07,214
All of you just know,
how to farm the land.

226
00:34:09,003 --> 00:34:10,469
In dreams.

227
00:34:10,711 --> 00:34:14,409
Where did I get 1,000 dollars?
How many do you have?

228
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:18,820
I maybe 200 bucks!

229
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,457
Then another 800.
Another 8000.

230
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:27,402
Maybe you know where to get it,
the rest of the money.

231
00:34:29,808 --> 00:34:32,093
I know where 500 is.

232
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,622
Kane, you are crazy.
You cannot go to a tournament.

233
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:47,378
I can.
It's like fighting a Yankee.

234
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:50,770
No anger, Cheney.
No hard feelings.

235
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:54,814
In addition to my sincere wishes,
you are losing another $ 300 right

236
00:34:55,732 --> 00:34:57,265
Not if you bet on me.

237
00:34:59,004 --> 00:35:02,177
What if you lose?
Then we will have nothing.

238
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:04,309
People think about it.

239
00:35:07,585 --> 00:35:10,863
I will fight.
Do whatever you want.

240
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:24,545
Distance is important.
It's English boxing.

241
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:32,651
And like this Frenchman or Savat.
You shoot low.

242
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,428
Oh!... Or aside.

243
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:37,529
Different blows.

244
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,135
Ah!...

245
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:43,545
In the end...

246
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:49,603
That's how you fight.

247
00:35:50,805 --> 00:35:53,437
But always fair.

248
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:59,090
Like this?
Now it's your turn.

249
00:35:59,237 --> 00:36:04,072
I pick you up
and throw you on the floor.

250
00:36:17,068 --> 00:36:18,375
Kane...

251
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:22,354
how can you fight,
if you've been a farmer all your life.

252
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,236
You will suffer.
I will not.

253
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:30,333
I am not trained by Joseph.
Kane!

254
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,516
Someone needs to stop them.

255
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:37,255
I have the right
to defend, my own.

256
00:36:37,438 --> 00:36:39,154
Where's your dignity?

257
00:36:41,302 --> 00:36:45,580
You would fight, wouldn't you?
It is a professional wok.

258
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:47,554
Fighting is your life.

259
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,723
You can go to a tournament.

260
00:36:58,565 --> 00:37:00,802
It's not that simple,
that's why...

261
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:28,565
We are born!

262
00:37:32,366 --> 00:37:33,581
Stable!

263
00:37:35,606 --> 00:37:36,869
Kane!

264
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,367
Kane, here!

265
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,688
Skirt!

266
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:11,667
This afternoon.

267
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:19,227
Benedict!

268
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,121
Oh my God!

269
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:37,392
Gentlemen, I saw a fire from a distance.
Someone wants to scare us.

270
00:38:37,418 --> 00:38:40,488
You know, who else can
you ask, Benedict.

271
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,303
What will you do?

272
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:44,867
Make a new barn.

273
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,381
It cannot be so.

274
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,667
It cannot be so.

275
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:52,106
It cannot be so.

276
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:16,932
Well, it won't work!

277
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:57,841
Hell, come on, girl.

278
00:40:33,787 --> 00:40:36,103
Are you a lonely cowboi?

279
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,299
I believe this is yours.

280
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,020
And I think you are very
wrong.

281
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:59,907
I am not mistaken.
It's yours.

282
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:03,649
What job did you get, boy?

283
00:41:03,675 --> 00:41:05,553
This man attacked,
my farm.

284
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:08,707
But it wasn't just that!

285
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:13,811
This is a serious charge.
I hope you have evidence.

286
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:15,844
This man attacked,
my farm.

287
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,740
You are accusing me,
we need to clear this up now!

288
00:41:36,148 --> 00:41:38,799
Solve your problems here.

289
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:44,363
Fair and honorable.
If you are a man.

290
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,508
Go Go!

291
00:42:01,135 --> 00:42:02,440
Oh!

292
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:06,549
What happened?
Didn't your corset unbutton?

293
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:09,601
Hya, oh!...

294
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:20,749
Oh my gosh!

295
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,399
Keep your weapons!

296
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,554
Kane, no!

297
00:42:43,452 --> 00:42:45,128
Don't give this...

298
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:50,069
I am truly sorry, Miss Mary.

299
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:52,795
I tried to stop him, but...

300
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,935
You know what he was like,
he didn't hear me.

301
00:42:58,074 --> 00:43:02,306
Take it and take care of it.
Nobody wants to bother you.

302
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:04,102
I give you my word.

303
00:43:11,648 --> 00:43:15,667
As for you, Frenchman,
I have nothing to do with you.

304
00:44:04,624 --> 00:44:08,603
He was a good man.
Watch out, Mary.

305
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:14,008
If you decide to come to California,
you can live with us.

306
00:45:01,443 --> 00:45:05,482
I don't know what he wants.
Talk to him.

307
00:45:06,363 --> 00:45:07,668
Listen to me.

308
00:45:16,723 --> 00:45:20,037
Please.
Don't give up on the country.

309
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:24,412
An honorable man is
being buried today.

310
00:45:25,865 --> 00:45:30,532
As a friend and officer,
I will defend your honor.

311
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,584
I will take Kane's
place in the tournament.

312
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:44,033
with him we have a chance.

313
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,642
I'm...

314
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,995
What is happening?

315
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,300
Come here.

316
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:31,069
Sir!...

317
00:47:27,368 --> 00:47:30,287
Benedict,
write to me for tomorrow.

318
00:47:35,605 --> 00:47:40,440
You see, Mr. Zachariah.
It's my pleasure.

319
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:45,179
Congratulations,
Hern Benedict.

320
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:48,465
You made two old friends.

321
00:47:49,925 --> 00:47:52,393
He is known for his
grace in Europe.

322
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:55,407
They think he is the best.

323
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:58,248
Can you beat him?

324
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,172
Who do you think you are, Mr?

325
00:48:46,196 --> 00:48:47,445
Great...

326
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:50,571
we thought we had a decent one,
and it would end up falling out the window.

327
00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:53,996
Shut up Jenki!

328
00:49:07,134 --> 00:49:09,272
Damn French is good.
Yes!

329
00:49:10,908 --> 00:49:13,316
Von Trot too. Yes.

330
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:18,900
I want to hold on.

331
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:30,199
What kind of man is that?
His name is Siegfield Von Trot.

332
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,386
The murderer of some
civilians in Mexico.

333
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:36,272
And he had no mercy on what he did!
That was it Mr!

334
00:49:38,947 --> 00:49:40,730
He was taken
to a military court.

335
00:49:43,226 --> 00:49:47,653
He said he suffered
from chicken blindness.

336
00:49:49,717 --> 00:49:51,643
He was demoted.

337
00:49:52,967 --> 00:49:57,536
From that day on,
he vowed to paint.

338
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:42,601
Shit!

339
00:51:43,078 --> 00:51:48,889
Philip!...

340
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:16,092
The medallion saved
me from the bullet.

341
00:52:16,584 --> 00:52:19,859
I would be dead now.

342
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,954
I will not.

343
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:47,434
I can't watch this.

344
00:53:09,044 --> 00:53:12,080
I want to bet on...
Everything.

345
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:16,577
Everything for Charlemagne.
All.

346
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:26,004
$ 197 for French.
Start, we need to start.

347
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:27,660
Come on!

348
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,938
Come on,
today is your lucky day.

349
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,085
On the 4th of July,
we opened a fighting tournament,

350
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,990
with the elimination
of the opponent.

351
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:16,591
The winner received
$ 500 in silver.

352
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:22,480
Tournament rules?
None.

353
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:30,472
In the first round I see,
a terrible great Bruno...

354
00:54:33,881 --> 00:54:37,918
and the mysterious French...

355
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:41,328
He's closing!

356
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,049
God, this one is really huge!

357
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:51,767
David defeated Goliath.
David had a stone.

358
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,245
I blew up, French.
French!

359
00:56:01,332 --> 00:56:04,236
The winner is Charlie Grand!

360
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:19,668
Give me your hand.
You fight well.

361
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:21,103
Come on!

362
00:56:35,173 --> 00:56:37,467
The next fight will...

363
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:17,351
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mary.

364
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:20,447
Go ahead.

365
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:13,333
Are you lost, Pance?
Yes, Benedict.

366
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,001
Don't worry, Miss Mary.

367
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:22,228
I'll make sure there's nothing
wrong with your little head.

368
00:58:22,254 --> 00:58:26,296
I need to know...
that's all.

369
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:36,753
Be a gentleman.

370
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:12,723
The following participants are:
Mr. Kang Wu,

371
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:17,382
coming up from China...

372
00:59:18,975 --> 00:59:24,224
and the invincible Prussian
Siegfield von Trot!

373
00:59:48,636 --> 00:59:51,469
He's a real beast.
Ah!...

374
01:00:18,052 --> 01:00:20,435
You have to lose,
the next match.

375
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:22,426
Otherwise he will die

376
01:00:58,513 --> 01:01:02,481
The magnificent knockout
winner is Von Trot!

377
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:08,402
Now the semifinals.

378
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,052
The winner will fight
in the final,

379
01:01:11,078 --> 01:01:15,630
for a grand prize
of $ 500 silver.

380
01:01:15,917 --> 01:01:20,896
The great duel between,
the Brazilian Sartana.

381
01:01:21,063 --> 01:01:23,861
And Mr. Charlie Grand!

382
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:07,322
What is his attitude?

383
01:02:22,328 --> 01:02:23,625
I dont know.

384
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:29,523
Wonderful.

385
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,870
That's better!

386
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:44,629
Get him away from me!
Get him away!

387
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:53,668
Stay away from me!

388
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:57,968
Sit on his lap!

389
01:04:20,686 --> 01:04:25,571
The position of the peoples
in the next battle is Duke von Trot

390
01:04:25,619 --> 01:04:31,629
and the horrible Justin Creole
from New Orleans!

391
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:34,733
Ring that bell!

392
01:04:41,746 --> 01:04:44,000
The German will crush
your head.

393
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:09,456
that you are in heaven,
hallowed be your name,

394
01:05:09,694 --> 01:05:14,156
so that your kingdom may come,
both in heaven and on earth.

395
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:22,027
Forgive us our debts, for we...

396
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,869
Share the menu too.

397
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,757
Since I've been
waiting for this.

398
01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:08,290
You're breaking my arm!
Ah!...

399
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:17,623
Look that...

400
01:06:19,114 --> 01:06:21,345
Who said he was dead?

401
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:24,567
Yes, a sad untruth.

402
01:06:26,738 --> 01:06:29,534
It's a real pleasure for
a man to see you fight.

403
01:06:31,202 --> 01:06:34,533
Hello Major! Sergeant
with pleasure.

404
01:07:14,258 --> 01:07:18,162
Please sir.
As you can see, not very well.

405
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:19,887
Oh yeah!

406
01:07:22,043 --> 01:07:25,922
Elegant player.
This is not true.

407
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:27,690
What did you say?

408
01:07:27,716 --> 01:07:31,037
The verdict is false.
He wanted the land,

409
01:07:31,063 --> 01:07:33,727
where the railroad will go.
The railroad?

410
01:07:35,662 --> 01:07:39,128
This will be announced shortly.
Coming soon.

411
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,966
Did you know that
all along?

412
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:48,652
I hope you burn in hell!

413
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:22,259
Your leg!

414
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:25,475
You are hurt.

415
01:08:29,484 --> 01:08:31,000
It's all over.

416
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:37,600
Not yet.

417
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:44,863
If I don't win,
you will lose all your money.

418
01:08:59,966 --> 01:09:02,166
It's my time to say goodbye.

419
01:09:05,383 --> 01:09:06,762
Yes Mery...

420
01:09:28,944 --> 01:09:30,338
Milost!

421
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,078
Now the long-awaited
moment arrives.

422
01:10:06,104 --> 01:10:11,733
The final fight,
for 500 dollars of silver.

423
01:10:42,814 --> 01:10:45,155
Mr. Charlie Grand is
coming any minute now.

424
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:46,572
At least I hope so.

425
01:10:47,585 --> 01:10:50,779
I told you not to invest
all the money in French.

426
01:10:51,745 --> 01:10:54,419
He will come.
You need to have faith.

427
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:13,395
Last call,
for Mr. Charlie Grand!

428
01:11:17,905 --> 01:11:19,267
He will come.

429
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,573
He has to come.

430
01:11:44,688 --> 01:11:46,229
This is for Kane.

431
01:11:57,288 --> 01:11:58,768
And that for me.

432
01:13:13,192 --> 01:13:17,505
That person cannot fight.
I don't see how.

433
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:20,679
How did he leave us?
Will see.

434
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:28,306
When Napoleon entered
the battle, wearing a red ribbon.

435
01:14:46,868 --> 01:14:48,268
He will fight!

436
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,087
His name is
Siegfield Von Trpota.

437
01:17:10,642 --> 01:17:14,076
Then he said he would suffer
from blindness in the hens.

438
01:17:14,186 --> 01:17:15,756
Chicken blindness...

439
01:18:28,587 --> 01:18:31,101
Come, you see.
Ah!...

440
01:21:22,137 --> 01:21:24,467
It's because of Philip.

441
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:14,431
Winner!
Take him there.

442
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,972
Very well friend.
I knew it.

443
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:19,631
I always knew that.

444
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:33,767
How are you?

445
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:44,276
Winner, Mr. Charlie Grand,

446
01:22:44,302 --> 01:22:46,439
deservedly won,
500 silver dollars!

447
01:22:58,995 --> 01:23:00,409
This is for you.

448
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:03,994
Thank you.
