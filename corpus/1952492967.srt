1
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,425
Clem?

2
00:02:46,632 --> 00:02:50,432
Turn down that thing, will ya?
You're gonna wake Scotty.

3
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,666
- What's that?
- The RCA.

4
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,572
- Scotty's got school tomorrow.
- All right.

5
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,701
Say, you haven't
seen my glasses, have you?

6
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:01,371
On the table next to the clock.

7
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:07,277
Yes, you're such a pretty girl,
aren't you?

8
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,774
- No, they're not here.
- Try the washroom.

9
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:43,014
What's gotten into Jack?

10
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:45,522
Anderson's bitch
must be in heat again.

11
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:48,082
I'll go run her up the road.

12
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:57,535
What is it, Jack?
That old bitch doggin' you again?

13
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,537
Lulu, is that you out there?

14
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:02,972
You go on home, now, you hear?
Go on. Get.

15
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,111
What the devil?

16
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,788
Still dead?

17
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,728
I don't understand it.

18
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,858
County ran a new wire
just last month.

19
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,903
You can drive him into town
in the mornin'.

20
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,769
He looks like he could use
a good night's rest anyway.

21
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,740
You get anything more
out of him?

22
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:40,108
No. He just
keeps saying he's lost.

23
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,030
Scotty, what are you doing
down here?

24
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,714
You don't know this here boy,
do you, son?

25
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:24,454
- Hush.
- I'll put him in the barn. Come on.

26
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,185
Come on.

27
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,562
You get out.

28
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,657
Why don't we go upstairs
and run you a bath?

29
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,328
Didn't your mama think
to give you a haircut?

30
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,571
Now, what is this?

31
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:47,203
My God.
Who'd do such a thing to a boy?

32
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,282
They're supposed to be asleep.

33
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,513
You always know
they're supposed to be asleep.

34
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:12,693
Somebody else in this house
beside that baby?

35
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:14,705
Somebody else in this house?

36
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:25,707
Boy, I am your father...

37
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,718
and you answer your father.

38
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:33,724
Is there somebody else
in this house?

39
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:39,111
Is this one as smart
as the other one?

40
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,947
Afraid so.

41
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:49,489
How come they're all
named Betty?

42
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:53,759
Well, now,
that is a good Question.

43
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:59,168
Maybe they're not as smart
as we think.

44
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:01,736
Here.

45
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,831
Stick with the jukebox.

46
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:15,676
My bird's fryin' her ass
out there in the hot sun, Theodore.

47
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:18,483
Yeah, well, County Health's gonna
fry my ass if I put her back inside.

48
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:21,953
- I serve food here, Arlis.
- So to speak.

49
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:24,358
And by the way,
some 14-year-old kid...

50
00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:26,294
bought a pack of cigarettes
out of your machine there...

51
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:28,889
and his parents
are threatening to sue me.

52
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,162
- You want me to take it out?
- Hell, no.

53
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,204
I'm just tellin' you
what I'm up against.

54
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:36,297
Your mangy chicken's the least
of my problems.

55
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:39,366
You should have heard the stink
over the rubbers last week.

56
00:14:39,444 --> 00:14:43,744
Do we have to have a prophylactic
machine in the ladies' toilet?

57
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,875
We are doing 2-to-1
compared to the men's room.

58
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:49,249
I know, Arlis,
but this ain't Abilene.

59
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,585
We're a small town.
We got small-town values.

60
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:54,488
- Am I right, Cindy?
- Amen.

61
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:33,661
Like I said,
you just missed him.

62
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:36,097
We were preparing
to close the casket.

63
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,964
Well, it's probably best.

64
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,596
I was sort of the black sheep
of the family.

65
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:44,733
Well, as they say,
"In death, all is forgiven."

66
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:49,540
That's a nice sentiment.
I'll have to remember that.

67
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:52,650
Exactly what relation are you?

68
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,277
It's complicated.

69
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:03,160
Would you mind
giving us a moment alone?

70
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,525
Of course.

71
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:08,429
The book is here
if you care to sign.

72
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,091
Thank you.

73
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:44,460
God bless, whoever you are.

74
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:09,551
You know, my face breaks out
about two days after you leave town.

75
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:12,391
Every time,
like some goddamn teenaged girl.

76
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:18,559
- It's the chocolate.
- I know. I just can't help myself.

77
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,035
How come you don't have those cheese
and peanut butter crackers anymore?

78
00:17:25,643 --> 00:17:27,736
They pick up pinworms
in the heat.

79
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,904
Pinworms? Jesus.

80
00:17:31,983 --> 00:17:34,349
Too bad.
My kids love those things.

81
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,349
You want a carton of Kools
for Nathan?

82
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:41,688
No. He's Quit. Again.

83
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:49,058
Jesus. I never get used
to these chickens.

84
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:44,280
- About twenty-five.
- Twenty... Twenty-five late?

85
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,617
Lay it down.

86
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,591
You heard about Lou Jamison?

87
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,220
I heard his widow was lookin'
to unload his machines.

88
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,289
Was. Pudge Riley
got to her Friday last.

89
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:57,334
He get the Remingtons?

90
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,836
Two dozen electro-slots.

91
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:02,839
Says he's got a buyer
for 'em in Oklahoma.

92
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:08,971
All I know is
Lou Jamison's widow is sittin'...

93
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,845
on all the Texaco stations
in Benson County...

94
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:15,784
and most of the Dairy Queens,
with no machines.

95
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:17,582
I don't want Benson County.

96
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:22,024
But Arlis, I had to drive
through Benson to get here.

97
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:24,323
- Why not expand a little?
- I'm big enough.

98
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:26,829
- I don't need Benson.
- But Arlis...

99
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:29,332
Just make a note
about the machines, Elliot.

100
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,947
Say, Arlis, I almost forgot.

101
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,478
There was a fella askin'
about you over in Woodlake.

102
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:55,685
- Denny Harris?
- No. Just some fella.

103
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,955
Said he knew you from way back.

104
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,998
I figured he must've
worked for you sometime.

105
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,692
- Why is that?
- He had one of our dimes.

106
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:06,896
You know, the blue juke dimes?

107
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:11,999
- You get a name?
- He didn't offer. I didn't ask.

108
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:16,069
Said he wanted to look you up.
Anyway, I stayed vague.

109
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,874
You did right.

110
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:23,045
I'll see you on the 7th.

111
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:11,028
Looks like I'm gonna
be stretchin' felt in the mornin'.

112
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:13,195
You're gonna be stretchin' your luck
if you're thinkin' about take-out...

113
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,863
anytime soon.

114
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:17,499
It is a slight feverish tonight.

115
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:20,169
Just wait till that damn cake
pops its lid.

116
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,474
Unless that little pastry inside
comes with a bicycle pump...

117
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:27,075
and two sisters, there ain't gonna
be a farm animal safe tonight.

118
00:22:33,417 --> 00:22:35,476
Go! Go! Go! Go!

119
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,183
Three, two, one!

120
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,226
Christ Almighty.

121
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,830
Just put her in my pickup.

122
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,594
- Lookin' good.
- Here's to ya, honey!

123
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:34,273
Feel like knockin' a few sins
off your ledger, Arlis?

124
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:39,510
You want me to find out
if she's got a home.

125
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,518
And take her there.

126
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:45,779
What's the damage?

127
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:48,017
Well, put it this way.

128
00:23:48,092 --> 00:23:51,027
Feed this girl a cucumber,
it'd come out pickles.

129
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:02,555
Jesus.

130
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,293
I figure the bed's one
of those vibratin' numbers...

131
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,887
so that explains the Quarters.

132
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,866
Nobody could possibly
fancy pretzel twists that much...

133
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:39,664
so I figured you won some kind
of weird contest.

134
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,741
As for the condoms, well,
either you got a yen...

135
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,074
for cheerleading squads,
or we had the night of all nights.

136
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,341
Whatever.
There's an explanation.

137
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,484
As for the blue chicken,
I need a little help with that one.

138
00:25:57,388 --> 00:26:00,755
- You passed out.
- Who wouldn't?

139
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:05,222
The coins just need
to be papered for the bank.

140
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:06,888
The condoms and the twists
are inventory.

141
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:08,431
The chicken's Brainy Betty.

142
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,365
I take it Betty's one
of the exotics?

143
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,374
She plays tic-tac-toe.

144
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,843
What makes her so brainy?

145
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,278
She wins nine times out of ten.

146
00:26:24,949 --> 00:26:26,917
You want some coffee?

147
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:29,282
You got a machine for that too?

148
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:32,186
Half a dozen
in the next three counties.

149
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:35,419
But given the circumstances
of your immediate past...

150
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,791
I would suggest the real bean.

151
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:43,525
You wouldn't happen to have a pair
of chinos and a belt, would ya?

152
00:26:47,905 --> 00:26:49,395
"Boo-boo"?

153
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,410
Story of my life.

154
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,560
Wait. Don't forget Lorraine.

155
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:20,995
Peek's Beauty Academy,
right outside Red Grove...

156
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,267
near Green Gene's Pickle Factory.

157
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:26,572
Buy a burger around here, chances
are it's Green Gene's under the bun.

158
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:29,570
Anyway...

159
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:34,276
seein' as the beauty academy was
next door to the pickle factory...

160
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:36,513
we always had plenty of people
to practice on.

161
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:40,380
So one day I'm doin'
this tint job on this lady...

162
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,656
and my instructor comes over
and is giving me...

163
00:28:01,712 --> 00:28:02,940
The collar picked up
a little perfume...

164
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,847
so if you got a suspicious wife,
I'd run some soap through it.

165
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:09,685
I don't need to worry about that.

166
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:13,548
Headin' home?

167
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,326
I don't think so.
I got a girlfriend up in Bayview.

168
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,829
That oughta be enough for now.

169
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:22,127
- You got a coat?
- Yeah.

170
00:28:23,434 --> 00:28:25,664
- Money?
- Sure.

171
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,600
Well, thanks for the eggs.

172
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:33,701
Everything.

173
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,246
Thanks for the company.

174
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:41,378
It must get lonely
on the road sometimes.

175
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,387
Like anything else,
you're born to it.

176
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,657
Well, you're a born listener,
that's for sure.

177
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,629
Depends on who's talkin'.

178
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,742
- What's your name?
- Kay.

179
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:15,751
All right, Kay.
You girls watch yourselves.

180
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:08,635
- You're sure this is no trouble?
- No use you waitin' seven hours...

181
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,266
on a bus to Bayview when I can
get you there in two.

182
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,402
I just hate to take ya too far
off the beaten path.

183
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:18,915
There's a man I can see on the way,
if you don't mind a detour or two.

184
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:38,935
- It's greased.
- Huh?

185
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,402
The wristband.

186
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:44,168
By the way, I get those novelties
straight from Korea.

187
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:47,642
I can do you ten on the dollar,
as many as you want.

188
00:30:50,247 --> 00:30:53,273
Bayview's a little south for you,
ain't it, Arlis?

189
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,375
Who said anything about Bayview?

190
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,997
'55, '56, somewhere in there.

191
00:31:18,075 --> 00:31:20,509
Eisenhower days.

192
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,012
- '57.
- Whatever.

193
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,979
- How'd you know about Bayview?
- Reese Davies.

194
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,488
- Who's Reese Davies?
- A moron.

195
00:31:33,557 --> 00:31:35,616
Used to own a movie theater
down that way.

196
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,854
At least, his father did,
till he died.

197
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,328
Reese ran it into the ground
in about 18 months.

198
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:45,099
I had a couple of cigarette machines
in the lobby from his old man's day.

199
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:48,969
Then when the theater went south,
Reese tried to claim 'em as assets.

200
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:58,004
It's his wife. Reese's.

201
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,218
Ugly as sin, ain't it?

202
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:40,490
Maybe some music'll
take the bite out of it.

203
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,659
Keep going. Sometimes you can
pick up K-MOO drivin' south.

204
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:53,829
Or here. Big Lake's got a station
plays George Jones most afternoons.

205
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,408
You like George Jones?

206
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:01,411
You spend much time
out this way?

207
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,706
Who? Me? No.

208
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,979
Like I said, my girlfriend...

209
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:14,256
There's no girlfriend.
It's just me.

210
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:20,363
See, if I hadn't have
gotten my money stolen...

211
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,127
I wouldn't have been jumpin' out of
the cake, and we never would've met.

212
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,363
And you wouldn't be wastin' time
drivin' me back to Bayview.

213
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,467
I'm sorry I lied.

214
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,503
That's all right.

215
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:37,705
It's just...

216
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,644
I'm really not myself
right now.

217
00:33:44,521 --> 00:33:46,148
That's all right.

218
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,448
And I'm married.

219
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,691
That's all right too.

220
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,409
America's number-one
shop-at-home television service...

221
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,543
bringing you 24 hours of savings,
fun and excitement every day.

222
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:17,109
Jesus. Will you look at this.

223
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,122
Two days.

224
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,852
Think if I'd been gone a week.

225
00:34:22,926 --> 00:34:24,689
If you’re just joining us,
you're not too late.

226
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,220
Don't worry. We're alone.
It's always on.

227
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:32,234
Reese goes through a picture tube
every six months.

228
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:34,736
I make it a rule not to trespass...

229
00:34:34,805 --> 00:34:37,638
especially in a man's house
I don't know.

230
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,303
Well, believe me, it's more my house
than it is his.

231
00:34:41,378 --> 00:34:44,313
Drop that anywhere.
I'll be right back.

232
00:34:44,381 --> 00:34:47,407
You're welcome to a beer
if you can find one.

233
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:51,412
- I oughta be pushin' off.
- What's that?

234
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:58,689
I said, "I left my smokes
in the truck."

235
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:02,959
What the hell?

236
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,273
Afternoon, Mr. Davies.

237
00:35:17,347 --> 00:35:20,145
I'm Earl Logan,
Ned Foster's man.

238
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:23,743
Is that your truck?

239
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,220
Yeah. I mean...

240
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,917
Well, I was wondering if we could
get you to move it.

241
00:35:27,991 --> 00:35:30,619
See, it sure would make our job
a whole lot easier.

242
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:35,324
And I need you to sign here 'fore
we can start. Watch your finger.

243
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:39,600
Son of a bitch.

244
00:35:42,706 --> 00:35:44,799
Son of a bitch!

245
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,574
They're...

246
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:54,312
Hello? Hubie?

247
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:58,320
This is Kay Davies.
Does my husband happen to be there?

248
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,421
Don't lie to me, Hubie!

249
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:04,259
Shit!

250
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,665
What the hell is that
in the driveway?

251
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,761
I think that they're lookin'
for your husband.

252
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:17,136
Well, they're not the only ones.

253
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,109
Can I help you?

254
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:24,841
Ma'am, I need the gentleman's
signature so we can begin.

255
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:27,179
You're not takin' my furniture.

256
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,617
Ma'am, I'm not
emotionally involved.

257
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:32,154
Well, I am!

258
00:36:32,222 --> 00:36:33,348
Christ!

259
00:36:36,426 --> 00:36:37,358
"Boo-boo"?

260
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:51,166
Since it looks like
I'm not needed here anymore...

261
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:54,574
Hey, Darlene. You haven't
by any chance seen Reese, have you?

262
00:36:55,445 --> 00:36:57,208
You have.

263
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,083
Really?

264
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,719
Who are you?

265
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,586
Never mind, Darlene.
Here he is.

266
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,060
Sorry to bother you.

267
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,326
This don't look like a good time
for introductions, so I'm gonna...

268
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,391
Where'd you put that duffel?

269
00:37:18,468 --> 00:37:19,560
There.

270
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,070
I understand all about schedules.

271
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,006
Just give me a minute
to get my ducks in line.

272
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,767
Quack, Quack.

273
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,973
Jesus, Kay, where in the hell
have you been?

274
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,779
Just what in the hell
are you wearin'?

275
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,876
And just who in the hell is this?

276
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,819
You're askin' me Questions?

277
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:41,858
Exactly what the hell is that truck
doin' outside?

278
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,193
Well, if you'd been here, Kay, maybe
I wouldn't have to explain it to ya.

279
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:48,390
I'm gone two days,
and you sell the furniture?

280
00:37:49,466 --> 00:37:51,900
Well, if it makes you feel better,
I sold it two weeks ago.

281
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:57,572
Well, shit, Reese, that makes me
feel a whole lot better.

282
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,609
Look, I don't wanna talk about
no goddamn chest of drawers, anyway.

283
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:02,406
I wanna know
who in the hell this man is.

284
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,606
None of your fuckin' business.

285
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,149
Hell, no.
He's in my house with my woman.

286
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,813
- Are you cheatin' with my wife?
- Actually, I just...

287
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:14,516
That's right, Reese.
Not two hours ago...

288
00:38:14,591 --> 00:38:19,358
we were sweatin' over each other in
the back room of the Shady 8 Motel.

289
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,420
He don't mind it in the mornin'.

290
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:24,592
And guess what, Reese.
I haven't showered...

291
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,068
or brushed my teeth.

292
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,663
Actually,
I just gave her a ride...

293
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,400
in the truck.

294
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,707
Now, you listen to me, darlin'.

295
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:40,307
There are two men on our front lawn,
and they got a job to do.

296
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,852
Now, I'm gonna open that door,
and you're gonna let 'em do it.

297
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,244
Ain't that right?

298
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,917
Fuck you.

299
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,190
Go for it, Slick.

300
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:05,104
You got yourself
a real lionheart, Kay.

301
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,645
Fuck my pretty wife now.

302
00:39:18,388 --> 00:39:19,980
Fuck this.

303
00:39:24,661 --> 00:39:27,425
- That's my gun.
- Very good, Reese.

304
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:30,830
It's your gun, in my hand,
pointed at you. Get the picture?

305
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,995
Christ, Kay, you don't even know
how to use that thing.

306
00:39:39,142 --> 00:39:41,076
I got a pretty good idea.

307
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:49,982
Now, Reese, darlin', I suggest
you take your sorry ass outside...

308
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,647
and tell the gentlemen on the lawn
that the deal is off.

309
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,021
I can't do that.

310
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:00,663
- Christ, Kay!
- Trust me, Reese.

311
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,063
That clock ain't the only thing
runnin' out of time.

312
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:07,263
I took money. I shook hands, Kay.
The deal is done.

313
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,763
How much?

314
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,533
Seven hundred dollars.

315
00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:15,908
- Where is it?
- You know them bills we had to pay!

316
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:19,938
Shit, Reese, you haven't paid a bill
in three years. Where is it?

317
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:23,015
Kay, I just told you.

318
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,919
For God's sake, Kay.

319
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,895
All right. It's gone.
I lost it.

320
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,732
Poker?

321
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:42,237
Mostly.

322
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,711
You sell that too?

323
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:57,153
The piano?

324
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:02,651
Hell, no. I bought you that
for your birthday, Kay.

325
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,952
- All right then. We'll take it.
- Take it?

326
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:08,156
You got room
in the truck there, Arlan?

327
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:11,131
- Wait just a second here.
- It's Arlis.

328
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,470
You don't even know his name?

329
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,237
For Christ's sake, Kay, what
in the hell has happened to you?

330
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,904
Excuse me.
Who's holding the gun here?

331
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:25,809
You are.

332
00:41:27,417 --> 00:41:31,547
So I guess I can call anybody
any damn thing I damn well please.

333
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:33,111
Am I right?

334
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:35,720
That's right.

335
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:47,769
Sorry.

336
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,634
Back there. Your name.
Mixing it up.

337
00:41:53,643 --> 00:41:56,339
That's a horrible thing
to do to a person.

338
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,975
You were close enough.

339
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,645
It's just I have a habit
of doin' it when I get nervous.

340
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,280
I got so mad at a boss of mine
one time, I was screamin' at him...

341
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:09,655
a full three minutes 'fore I
realized I was callin' him Leroy...

342
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:11,421
and his name was Ed.

343
00:42:13,263 --> 00:42:14,525
Not even close.

344
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,864
It sort of took the sting
out of it.

345
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,538
Scary sometimes.

346
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:30,042
What's that?

347
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,682
Moments.

348
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:35,217
Little split-seconds of time
where you find yourself capable...

349
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:38,277
of things you would never even think
of doing normally.

350
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,915
Like back there,
holdin' that gun.

351
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,152
There was a moment
when my finger twitched.

352
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:46,389
Not so you could see.
More like inside, under the skin.

353
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,534
Some crazy little muscle.

354
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:55,128
And I could've done it. I could've
shot him right in the face.

355
00:42:57,274 --> 00:43:00,209
My whole life would've changed
in one tiny little second.

356
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,683
It's not in your blood.

357
00:43:19,996 --> 00:43:21,930
Ain't that a kick?

358
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,791
Yeah, it's a real tickler.

359
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,531
You mind tellin' me
what you got in here?

360
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:31,904
Seven years of bad luck,
at least what's left.

361
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,648
Well, thank God
the furniture's spoken for.

362
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:41,741
Believe me, sooner or later, he'd
have slapped a price tag on my ass.

363
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,515
To hell with him.
He's just taillights to me now.

364
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,721
Not that he didn't
leave a few dents behind.

365
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,004
Let me see.

366
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,310
You take a hell of a punch.

367
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:14,340
Practice makes perfect.

368
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:18,687
We'll get you some ice.

369
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,588
Arlis, you're tellin'me this now?

370
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,252
I've been settin'here
all afternoon.

371
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:27,888
I've been settin'here for
three hours waitin'for you to call.

372
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:30,432
Rosie, I told ya,
something's come up.

373
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,695
Something's come up, huh?
Well, I know what's come up.

374
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:35,135
You got another woman over there
with you, don't you?

375
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,969
- Don't you, Arlis?
- Rosie, listen to me.

376
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:41,477
You know what I'm gonna do? I'm
gonna go to town, go into a bar...

377
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:42,705
and pick up the first man I see.

378
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:44,474
I'm gonna pick up
the first two men I see.

379
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:47,346
I don't think that's such
a good idea, do you, Rosie?

380
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:49,544
You know what, Arlis?
I don't care.

381
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,595
Are you still there,
or did you hang up on me?

382
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,860
No, I'm still here.

383
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,734
You're sort of an odd fellow,
you know that?

384
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:18,212
You don't ask many Questions...
personal, I mean.

385
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:21,612
I figure people share
what they want to.

386
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:23,915
No sense crowdin' 'em.

387
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,016
Women must love you.

388
00:45:30,393 --> 00:45:32,361
Put that on your face
once you're out.

389
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,927
You mind grabbin' me
another one of these?

390
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,633
- Ever been married?
- Nope.

391
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,640
Ever been in love?

392
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,143
- Am I crowdin' you?
- No.

393
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:54,478
- I've never been in love.
- Me either.

394
00:45:56,586 --> 00:45:58,816
What about your husband?

395
00:45:58,888 --> 00:46:01,721
Hell, no. I mean,
you saw his hair, right?

396
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,896
Besides, he's no different
than any of the others.

397
00:46:08,064 --> 00:46:11,465
I was 13 when the first one
pulled my blue jeans off...

398
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,537
and ever since, they seem
to pass me off, one to another...

399
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:19,006
my whole life.

400
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:21,976
Like they're all members
of the same club or something.

401
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:30,777
You know, you look good
without that hat.

402
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,651
But you're gonna bald.

403
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,086
See how high your peaks are?
That's from wearin' the hat all day.

404
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:41,255
You have to
let your scalp breathe.

405
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:48,463
Besides, you shouldn't hide
your head. You got a nice shape.

406
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,137
I'll keep that in mind.

407
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:56,008
It's not 'cause of that, is it?
The tattoo?

408
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,577
I bet that was one crazy night.

409
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:04,849
No more than any other.

410
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:08,657
Well, whatever.
Nothin' to feel shy about.

411
00:47:11,794 --> 00:47:14,354
You hardly notice it's there.

412
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:18,242
Come on. Let's go
for a little walk, okay?

413
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,590
Why can't you sleep?

414
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,996
The night air usually calms her.

415
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:15,242
This stuff is awful.
You sure you asked for Cover Girl?

416
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:18,280
Yes, I asked. They were out.

417
00:50:18,347 --> 00:50:21,441
Well, my skin
does not take to this.

418
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:24,782
How I could forget my beauty bag,
I do not know.

419
00:50:24,854 --> 00:50:26,981
Probably wouldn't fit
in the suitcase.

420
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,424
How do you abide this seat?

421
00:50:30,493 --> 00:50:33,394
Ten more miles,
my ass'll be flat as a pancake.

422
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:37,997
Seats take breakin' in.

423
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:43,034
All right. I get the message.

424
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,806
I'm not usually like this. If we'd
met under normal circumstances...

425
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:53,974
you'd probably like me.

426
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,248
Most people do,
or I guess they do.

427
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:02,883
I didn't say I didn't like you.
Hell, I like you.

428
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:06,921
It's just that there's been
a whole lot of...

429
00:51:09,365 --> 00:51:12,095
activity
in the past couple of days.

430
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:18,267
I go from one town to the next,
you understand?

431
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:21,936
I see the same faces.
I hear the same talk.

432
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:24,571
I sleep in the same beds.
I eat the same food.

433
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:29,016
Then I start all over again.
I like it that way.

434
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:32,077
I don't like walkin'
into people's houses I don't know.

435
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,123
I don't like guns
comin' out of nowhere.

436
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:36,954
I don't like lookin'
over my shoulder for angry husbands.

437
00:51:37,026 --> 00:51:39,790
I don't like surprises, period.

438
00:51:43,032 --> 00:51:44,556
You really like me?

439
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,365
What's not to like?

440
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:21,827
Arlis, that stew of yours...

441
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:24,168
has got to where it's nothin'
but potatoes and carrots.

442
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,538
I don't make it, Kyle;
I just stock it.

443
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:29,703
Hell, Homer and I are about the
only ones who buy the damn stuff.

444
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,509
We get up to our elbows
in John Deere, we got no choice.

445
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,847
I can go back to the chili
if you want.

446
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,408
Shit, no.

447
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:40,387
We work close enough Quarters
in that pit as it is.

448
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:43,357
All I need is Homer's ass
in my face after two cans of that.

449
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:57,105
Now, I could stand a little
of that in my face.

450
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:03,845
She'd steal you blind.

451
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:13,154
So old Sam found you, did she?

452
00:53:13,222 --> 00:53:16,817
- Came right up.
- Yeah, she knows the truck.

453
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:19,453
Here. Introduce yourself.

454
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:24,759
You like that, don't you?

455
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,860
Better than that scratch
old Charley feeds you.

456
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:30,735
- She'll follow you all day now.
- What happened to her throat?

457
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,874
She ran herself through a fence
couple of years back...

458
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:37,435
tore herself up pretty good.

459
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:39,708
- Hey, girl.
- But you're still here, ain't ya?

460
00:53:42,785 --> 00:53:44,377
You ride?

461
00:53:44,453 --> 00:53:47,786
Once or twice. County fairs,
stuff like that.

462
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:51,091
You?

463
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:54,186
Once or twice.

464
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:34,433
I bet you can't swim neither.

465
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:36,300
That?

466
00:54:36,372 --> 00:54:38,966
Beginner's luck.

467
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:44,775
Well, there was a cowboy a while
back who showed me a thing or two.

468
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,386
Comin' in?

469
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,786
I'm fine.

470
00:54:55,024 --> 00:54:56,787
Suit yourself.

471
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:01,655
So who showed you about horses?

472
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:07,096
When I was about 12, 13, I worked
at a little horse farm like this.

473
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,970
I shoveled stalls during the day,
got a roof over my head at night.

474
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:15,645
Well, where was your mother?

475
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,311
She died.

476
00:55:25,421 --> 00:55:27,514
How 'bout your father?

477
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,455
Long story.

478
00:55:32,895 --> 00:55:34,692
He still alive?

479
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:39,030
You ask all your cowboys
this many Questions?

480
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,597
Why don't you come on in here
and cool off?

481
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:50,703
We gotta go.

482
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,145
I don't wanna go.

483
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,451
Storm's comin'.

484
00:56:01,223 --> 00:56:03,054
There's no storm.

485
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:05,455
I can feel it.

486
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,035
How come some of them are blue?

487
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,901
- Those dimes?
- They're juke dimes.

488
00:56:50,606 --> 00:56:52,369
Juke dimes?

489
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:55,101
What's that?

490
00:56:55,778 --> 00:56:59,805
I give the boss man a roll of these,
he'll start up a jukebox.

491
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:03,215
You play your own jukebox?

492
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:05,219
That don't make sense.

493
00:57:06,555 --> 00:57:08,489
People don't make sense.

494
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,160
Man walks into a place
with a jukebox, right?

495
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:16,130
Nine times out of ten,
if that box isn't already playin'...

496
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:19,861
he'll be shy about startin' it up
or won't even know it's there.

497
00:57:19,935 --> 00:57:22,369
But you get it goin' for him...

498
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:24,633
nine times out of ten,
he'll keep it goin'...

499
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,107
with his own money.

500
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:29,804
Trick of the trade.

501
00:57:33,816 --> 00:57:35,750
How come you paint 'em blue?

502
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:38,582
This keeps 'em separate from
the boss man's money, that's all.

503
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:41,349
You go east...

504
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:46,224
Billy Breckins paints his green.

505
00:57:46,295 --> 00:57:48,286
Drop down two counties...

506
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,664
Buddy Clarke, his are red.

507
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,138
Me, I'm just partial to blue.

508
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:12,887
You could use a trim.

509
00:58:15,057 --> 00:58:17,924
I got a man in Blackwell does me
every third Wednesday of the month.

510
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,330
I could do ya.

511
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,737
A couple of snips here.

512
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:32,340
Couple there.

513
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:39,770
I think your hands
are a couple of beers past steady.

514
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:42,712
Yeah, I'd do you better blind
than you been gettin'.

515
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:45,983
Your man in Blackwell
doesn't understand your head.

516
00:58:47,756 --> 00:58:50,190
Besides, I'm not drunk.

517
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,194
I know exactly what I'm doin'.

518
00:59:15,784 --> 00:59:17,911
Looks like you were right...

519
00:59:21,657 --> 00:59:23,591
about that storm.

520
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,666
What?

521
01:00:07,069 --> 01:00:08,502
Nothing.

522
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,992
What? Did you say something?

523
01:01:16,138 --> 01:01:18,072
Is there somebody out there?

524
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,977
Shit!

525
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:29,875
Maybe it's Reese come.

526
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:37,825
Jesus.

527
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:51,204
Oh, thank God.

528
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:56,006
I'm sorry to bother you,
but the night man's gone to bed...

529
01:01:56,078 --> 01:01:59,138
and I'm having some trouble
with my car.

530
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:02,681
You try the bell?

531
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,380
- The bell?
- For the night man.

532
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:12,551
Sure, but no one came.

533
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:14,721
And no one along here
would open their door to me.

534
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:19,024
- You're the only one.
- What's wrong with your car?

535
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,635
Hell if I know.

536
01:02:22,704 --> 01:02:28,108
I am lost when it comes
to anything mechanical.

537
01:02:28,877 --> 01:02:33,371
But you look like you might know
something about motors.

538
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,610
Am I right?

539
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:50,231
- You got the keys?
- Inside.

540
01:03:01,877 --> 01:03:03,777
- You got it in gear.
- What?

541
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:06,947
You got it in gear.

542
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:13,952
Well, damn.

543
01:03:15,624 --> 01:03:18,058
You'd follow a mouse
into the mouth of a snake...

544
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,719
wouldn't you, Junior?

545
01:03:21,897 --> 01:03:24,263
He's hurt bad.

546
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:27,092
Hurt bad?

547
01:03:27,936 --> 01:03:31,167
Honey, I cut my lip worse
than this when I'm whistlin'.

548
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,437
See, it's just that
I can't fix it myself...

549
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,536
and my sweet pea there,
she don't know how.

550
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,916
How long has it been, boy?

551
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,430
Well, long time...

552
01:04:00,536 --> 01:04:02,128
no see.

553
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,946
Ugly little bastards, ain't they?

554
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:21,087
How's it look?

555
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:23,215
I've seen worse.

556
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,782
Yeah, I guess
my whole life's back there.

557
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:29,256
A good portion of yours too,
huh, son?

558
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,925
Be glad it's just bird seed
chasing you this time.

559
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:36,762
Not like that night in Kilgore, huh?

560
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:46,844
Hell, come winter...

561
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:48,849
it get cold enough...

562
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:53,150
the pinch'll get somethin' fierce.

563
01:04:55,957 --> 01:04:59,188
Sometimes you can't get it all out.

564
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,785
Sometimes you got to
carry it with you.

565
01:05:01,863 --> 01:05:05,230
Now, don't get me wrong.
You was always a good boy.

566
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:07,234
You always did what you was told.

567
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,596
Well, most of the time.

568
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:15,006
I managed to raise the night man,
and I have a key...

569
01:05:15,076 --> 01:05:16,509
Shit!

570
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:22,082
Shouldn't we get a doctor?

571
01:05:23,251 --> 01:05:27,347
Little darlin', I don't believe
there's a pill peddler alive...

572
01:05:27,422 --> 01:05:29,390
got a better touch
than my boy here.

573
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:33,154
And best of all,
he don't ask no Questions.

574
01:05:33,228 --> 01:05:35,492
Practice makes perfect.

575
01:05:46,708 --> 01:05:48,869
You got an injured man here, boy.

576
01:05:53,882 --> 01:05:55,474
Easy, easy.

577
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:02,316
That's nice.

578
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,324
That's nice, that smell.

579
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:08,361
You've got the smell
of love on you, boy.

580
01:06:08,429 --> 01:06:10,989
Tell me...

581
01:06:11,065 --> 01:06:13,033
does she taste as good?

582
01:06:16,004 --> 01:06:18,905
Come here, boy.
Get your father's boots off.

583
01:06:18,973 --> 01:06:20,907
That's the least a son can do...

584
01:06:23,177 --> 01:06:25,611
till he's ready
to wear them himself.

585
01:06:39,994 --> 01:06:42,895
Get yourself out of those clothes
before you catch a chill.

586
01:06:42,964 --> 01:06:45,432
Don't worry yourself.

587
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,764
I never caught anything in my life.

588
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,562
Everybody catches something.

589
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:53,436
Not me.

590
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:56,204
Well, I broke a finger once...

591
01:06:56,277 --> 01:06:58,268
but I don't figure that counts.

592
01:07:02,917 --> 01:07:04,282
Shit.

593
01:07:08,423 --> 01:07:09,947
This is too fucking weird.

594
01:07:10,024 --> 01:07:12,959
Wish I could say the same.

595
01:07:13,027 --> 01:07:15,723
I'm always catching a cold.

596
01:07:15,797 --> 01:07:17,856
Had one just last month.

597
01:07:17,932 --> 01:07:20,492
I'm sorry to hear it.

598
01:07:22,036 --> 01:07:24,834
You can't sleep in those.
Find yourself something of mine.

599
01:07:24,906 --> 01:07:26,840
I'll hang yours up to dry.

600
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:35,274
Come on.

601
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:40,278
What's your name?

602
01:07:41,522 --> 01:07:42,489
Ginnie.

603
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:44,821
With a J or a G?

604
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:48,522
You plannin' on writin' me a letter?

605
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:53,531
All right, keep it a mystery.
It's a nice name either way.

606
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:58,097
Yeah, well...

607
01:07:58,172 --> 01:08:00,197
I'm not a nice girl.

608
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:04,339
But I'll bet that you are,
aren't you?

609
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:08,381
I'd like to think so.

610
01:08:08,449 --> 01:08:10,917
And the guy
who did that to your face...

611
01:08:10,985 --> 01:08:12,714
did he think you were nice?

612
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,824
Not at the time.

613
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:22,054
But you stay with him anyway,
don't you?

614
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:25,029
Who, Arlis?

615
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:27,829
He didn't do this to me.
He's not like that at all.

616
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:30,496
Don't kid yourself.

617
01:08:30,571 --> 01:08:33,768
Eventually,
they are all like that...

618
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:35,274
evil.

619
01:08:36,377 --> 01:08:39,869
But once you know that...

620
01:08:39,947 --> 01:08:41,938
you can turn it back against 'em.

621
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:44,275
Use it.

622
01:08:45,887 --> 01:08:48,321
Arlis doesn't have
an evil bone in his body.

623
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:52,050
But...

624
01:08:52,126 --> 01:08:53,559
What?

625
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,657
I don't know.
I get the feeling...

626
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:00,724
he's been close to it,
felt the heat of it.

627
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,506
I think that you're the one
that's felt the heat of it.

628
01:09:08,576 --> 01:09:11,044
And not too long ago at that.

629
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:17,615
There's a pretty cotton nightshirt
in there with tulips on it.

630
01:09:17,685 --> 01:09:19,676
I know you'll love that.

631
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:23,885
You don't exactly travel light,
do you?

632
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:26,688
Long story.
Take anything you want.

633
01:09:31,265 --> 01:09:33,199
Well, how about this?

634
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:39,769
That was my mother's.

635
01:09:42,677 --> 01:09:45,111
I'm sorry.

636
01:09:50,251 --> 01:09:52,481
This her?

637
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:00,824
She's pretty.

638
01:10:02,964 --> 01:10:04,898
Yeah, I guess she was.

639
01:10:36,164 --> 01:10:37,597
Fuck.

640
01:10:39,934 --> 01:10:41,595
You lookin' for something?

641
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:44,262
Three guesses.

642
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:48,131
I had some serious shit
in that car.

643
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:53,044
- Your shit's still in it.
- You mind telling me where?

644
01:10:54,549 --> 01:10:56,676
Across the tracks over there
in Mesquite.

645
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:03,884
You mind telling me why?

646
01:11:04,792 --> 01:11:06,953
Anybody see you last night?

647
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:10,020
Last night? No.

648
01:11:10,097 --> 01:11:12,565
- You sure?
- Yeah.

649
01:11:13,301 --> 01:11:14,461
You sure?

650
01:11:14,535 --> 01:11:18,130
Are you deaf?
Yeah, I'm sure.

651
01:11:18,206 --> 01:11:21,300
Then whose pepper was I pickin'
out of my father's shoulder?

652
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:25,141
That?
Some half-wit pump owner...

653
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:28,444
stumbled onto us in the rain,
took a wild shot and hit something.

654
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,781
It was fluke luck.
Nobody saw the car.

655
01:11:31,853 --> 01:11:33,844
I guess I just wasted my time.

656
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:36,822
I guess you did.

657
01:11:37,925 --> 01:11:40,416
I'm his kin, you understand?

658
01:11:40,494 --> 01:11:42,223
I got no choice.

659
01:11:42,296 --> 01:11:45,424
So don't think this is some game
that you're playin'.

660
01:11:45,499 --> 01:11:48,195
Last night, it could have just
as easily been you out there...

661
01:11:48,269 --> 01:11:50,931
bleedin' in the rain.

662
01:11:51,005 --> 01:11:53,235
Only difference is,
he'd have left you behind...

663
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:56,778
or finished the job himself.

664
01:12:00,414 --> 01:12:02,712
Well, shit.

665
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:05,048
No wonder old black eyes loves you.

666
01:12:06,187 --> 01:12:09,281
You wouldn't have the balls
to shoo a fly off a steak.

667
01:12:18,766 --> 01:12:20,427
Warm you boys up?

668
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:24,866
Is that one at a time
or both together?

669
01:12:25,773 --> 01:12:27,400
You're a little devil, aren't you?

670
01:12:28,609 --> 01:12:32,045
I'd damn sure put the curl in your
hair if you'd give me half a chance.

671
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,072
I don't need a man for that.

672
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:38,141
- There you go.
- Thank you, ma'am.

673
01:12:42,623 --> 01:12:44,250
Oh, my God.

674
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:47,351
Where you from?

675
01:12:47,428 --> 01:12:48,918
Why do you wanna know that?

676
01:12:48,996 --> 01:12:50,930
Who gave her that mask?

677
01:12:53,434 --> 01:12:54,731
Does it matter?

678
01:12:56,337 --> 01:13:00,296
I suppose you're right.
People get what they deserve.

679
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:04,406
What do you want?

680
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:06,241
- If it's money, l...
- Money?

681
01:13:06,314 --> 01:13:08,248
Money? Hey, boy...

682
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:11,575
I don't need your money.

683
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,682
Well, why are you here?

684
01:13:19,627 --> 01:13:23,791
I got shot. You fixed me up.
I'm havin' some eggs.

685
01:13:23,865 --> 01:13:26,299
Does that seem strange?

686
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:28,631
Just like old times, huh?

687
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:30,295
Just coincidence.

688
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:35,267
I had a loose end to take care of
up north Oklahoma way...

689
01:13:35,343 --> 01:13:37,277
around Ardmore, them parts.

690
01:13:40,181 --> 01:13:42,547
An associate of mine...

691
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:44,346
got a little greedy.

692
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:47,588
Started threatenin'.

693
01:13:49,824 --> 01:13:52,622
Started to weigh on me...

694
01:13:52,693 --> 01:13:57,062
stole my sleep, and you know
how I feel about loose ends.

695
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:00,794
Being one myself.

696
01:14:01,636 --> 01:14:03,570
That's true, isn't it, Junior?

697
01:14:04,538 --> 01:14:07,200
He bought me lunch, and...

698
01:14:07,275 --> 01:14:09,539
he bought me a pack of cigarettes.

699
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:13,478
After Oklahoma, I was working north,
drifted on down...

700
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:16,277
and run into this little girl
over here.

701
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:19,751
And I saw her...

702
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,119
switching tickets at this diner
in Cherry Spring.

703
01:14:24,525 --> 01:14:27,085
She had a full rancher's breakfast,
and she pulled a switch...

704
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:29,095
with this little old lady
had coffee and a piece of pie.

705
01:14:30,898 --> 01:14:33,025
Little low-rent for you, ain't it?

706
01:14:34,435 --> 01:14:37,131
Well, it was the way she did it.

707
01:14:37,204 --> 01:14:39,172
Smooth as glass.
Real nerve.

708
01:14:40,474 --> 01:14:43,841
Well, at least you won't go hungry.

709
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:45,037
Well...

710
01:14:45,112 --> 01:14:47,103
she's a little bigger than that.

711
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:52,948
The last couple months, she's been
runnin' this slick little game.

712
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,181
Thing of beauty.

713
01:14:55,256 --> 01:14:57,520
She steals from the dead.

714
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:02,420
She's been sloppy about it,
of course.

715
01:15:02,496 --> 01:15:04,487
Would've got caught
if I hadn't come along.

716
01:15:06,701 --> 01:15:09,795
But she's got grit in spades.

717
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,735
I'll have to watch my back
with this one.

718
01:15:13,074 --> 01:15:14,905
Heart beats about twice a minute.

719
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:18,544
At least it beats.

720
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:24,909
Don't you kid yourself, Junior.

721
01:15:27,388 --> 01:15:29,379
You see, you and me...

722
01:15:32,326 --> 01:15:34,260
we're flesh and bone.

723
01:15:36,497 --> 01:15:39,694
The same blood
that runs my veins...

724
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:43,595
runs yours.

725
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:01,746
- You seen my duffle?
- Maybe in the truck.

726
01:16:07,361 --> 01:16:09,295
What happened last night...

727
01:16:09,363 --> 01:16:10,955
with your father?

728
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:16,002
He just has a habit
of puttin' himself...

729
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:18,095
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.

730
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:21,165
What's all that?

731
01:16:22,777 --> 01:16:25,371
She hardly has a thing to wear
from what I gather.

732
01:16:25,446 --> 01:16:27,778
Lord knows I got enough.

733
01:16:27,848 --> 01:16:31,807
Besides, most of these
are full of bad memories.

734
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:34,480
Not too many spring picnics here.

735
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:44,823
This may not be
none of my business, but...

736
01:16:44,899 --> 01:16:47,333
I run into that
little scarecrow you got...

737
01:16:47,401 --> 01:16:50,495
runnin' that north territory
up there.

738
01:16:50,571 --> 01:16:53,039
- Did he mention that?
- He mentioned it.

739
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:54,972
Yeah.

740
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:57,533
- His name Eddie?
- Elliot.

741
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:59,977
Elliot, right.

742
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:02,413
He's a nervous little
son of a bitch, ain't he?

743
01:17:02,483 --> 01:17:04,713
Got a real strange way of walkin'.

744
01:17:04,785 --> 01:17:08,380
Them ankles so close together.
You ever notice things like that?

745
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,651
What's your point?

746
01:17:10,724 --> 01:17:12,749
Well...

747
01:17:14,195 --> 01:17:16,561
it might not be my place.

748
01:17:18,799 --> 01:17:22,098
It looked to me like
he's stealin' from you, son.

749
01:17:22,169 --> 01:17:23,568
Elliot's an honest man.

750
01:17:23,637 --> 01:17:26,265
You sure know him better than I do.

751
01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:28,774
But it's just that, you see...

752
01:17:28,843 --> 01:17:32,438
I watched him at this fillin'
station outside of Paint Rock.

753
01:17:32,513 --> 01:17:35,073
This one afternoon,
he had him two sacks...

754
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:37,413
and he was runnin' Quarters
in the both of them.

755
01:17:39,787 --> 01:17:42,221
I guess it don't take
no great genius...

756
01:17:42,289 --> 01:17:45,417
to count Clark Bars and
figure out that you're short.

757
01:17:47,194 --> 01:17:49,628
He has been short, hasn't he?

758
01:17:49,697 --> 01:17:51,426
Short don't mean he's stealin'.

759
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:53,831
No, I guess not.

760
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:57,428
But then again,
what else would it mean?

761
01:18:05,079 --> 01:18:06,671
Bye, y'all.

762
01:18:10,518 --> 01:18:12,315
You sure you're fit to travel?

763
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,820
Hell, this ain't nothin', darlin'.

764
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:17,722
I'm what you call a Quick healer.

765
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:21,090
You ask Arlis there.
I'd wreck my shoulder on a Sunday...

766
01:18:21,162 --> 01:18:22,595
and still give him a smack
on a Monday.

767
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:23,823
Ain't that right, son?

768
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:26,731
There's a Texaco station
about ten miles east.

769
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,461
That'll be your last chance
for a while.

770
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:30,265
I appreciate that.

771
01:18:30,337 --> 01:18:33,204
Truly, l... Except I think
we're gonna head up north there...

772
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:35,105
around Benson County.

773
01:18:35,176 --> 01:18:37,337
You remember Benson County,
don't you, Junior?

774
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,475
I'm just needlin' him.
Boy always hated it up there.

775
01:18:43,551 --> 01:18:47,078
Them locusts liked to drive him
crazy. You take care, now.

776
01:19:06,774 --> 01:19:08,571
Get yourself packed.

777
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:10,234
We're leavin'.

778
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:29,291
It's funny. I'd have never
put it together... him and you.

779
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:32,855
If I'd met you separate,
I'd never see the tie.

780
01:19:33,968 --> 01:19:36,570
I guess we don't get
much choice in it, do we?

781
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:49,040
What was all that talk
about Benson County?

782
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:52,042
Just talk.

783
01:19:53,653 --> 01:19:55,883
I don't remember the locusts at all.

784
01:20:15,208 --> 01:20:17,335
Pass me that bottle again, will ya?

785
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:19,241
We finished the last we had.

786
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:25,179
We or you?

787
01:20:25,251 --> 01:20:27,116
What's the difference?

788
01:20:27,187 --> 01:20:28,779
It's gone.

789
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:38,390
Next place you see, you stop.

790
01:20:38,465 --> 01:20:40,399
You're the boss.

791
01:20:51,144 --> 01:20:52,304
That's strange.

792
01:20:52,379 --> 01:20:54,404
What?

793
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:57,279
Look at that house up there.

794
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:58,908
Looks familiar.

795
01:21:07,894 --> 01:21:10,158
Sure, that's the one
in the photograph.

796
01:21:13,466 --> 01:21:15,127
Photograph?

797
01:21:15,201 --> 01:21:17,499
The one that lady had.

798
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:22,098
I saw it in her suitcase when
I went looking for a nightshirt.

799
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:24,735
- You're wrong.
- No.

800
01:21:24,811 --> 01:21:28,975
That roof was just the same.
And the trees. And the windmill...

801
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:32,917
There's dozens of houses
look just like that up here.

802
01:21:32,986 --> 01:21:34,214
I'm positive.

803
01:21:34,287 --> 01:21:37,279
No one has lived in that house
for years.

804
01:21:43,496 --> 01:21:46,556
Well, looks like
it was a nice place once.

805
01:21:48,168 --> 01:21:51,865
I think whoever lived there
would have kept it up.

806
01:21:51,938 --> 01:21:54,031
Not that house.

807
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:58,300
What do you mean?

808
01:21:58,378 --> 01:22:01,541
Years ago,
they say some Mexican...

809
01:22:01,614 --> 01:22:05,345
shot the man
he was working for...

810
01:22:07,153 --> 01:22:11,351
and then shot the whole family
right after.

811
01:22:11,424 --> 01:22:13,585
Jesus.

812
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:16,652
I mean, that's the story I heard.

813
01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:19,096
It changes over the years.

814
01:22:22,035 --> 01:22:24,094
Who knows what the truth is anymore?

815
01:22:26,873 --> 01:22:30,866
No matter what the story is,
it all comes back to one thing.

816
01:22:30,944 --> 01:22:32,775
What's that?

817
01:22:32,846 --> 01:22:34,438
Well, the house.

818
01:22:37,984 --> 01:22:39,918
They say it's haunted.

819
01:22:45,759 --> 01:22:48,421
But then,
I don't believe in ghosts.

820
01:22:56,803 --> 01:22:58,703
All right, Darlene. Thanks.

821
01:22:58,772 --> 01:23:01,570
No, I'm glad you told me.

822
01:23:02,675 --> 01:23:05,269
Yeah, you too.

823
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:06,778
Bye.

824
01:23:08,948 --> 01:23:11,416
I can't believe it.

825
01:23:11,484 --> 01:23:14,180
He filed for divorce, Reese did.

826
01:23:20,059 --> 01:23:21,083
I'm sorry.

827
01:23:22,495 --> 01:23:25,293
Sorry? I'm just amazed he could do
the paperwork by himself.

828
01:23:28,601 --> 01:23:31,297
I wanna celebrate.

829
01:23:32,806 --> 01:23:34,068
Celebrate?

830
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:37,200
Yeah, I feel free...

831
01:23:37,277 --> 01:23:39,609
for the first time in my life,
I think, and I wanna celebrate.

832
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,079
I wanna put on a pretty dress,
get you out of that damn hat...

833
01:23:42,148 --> 01:23:43,775
and go have a nice big fat steak.

834
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,283
What do you say?

835
01:23:50,723 --> 01:23:53,248
Any suggestions?

836
01:23:53,326 --> 01:23:54,884
Try C-17.

837
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:59,188
C-17.

838
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:07,501
How come this place is closed
in the middle of the week?

839
01:24:07,574 --> 01:24:10,168
Pete's boy plays baseball
for the local school.

840
01:24:11,477 --> 01:24:14,571
Anytime Tommy's set to pitch,
Pete throws a lock on the place...

841
01:24:14,647 --> 01:24:16,615
and he rides the bus with the team.

842
01:24:18,051 --> 01:24:20,281
That's how come I got the key.

843
01:24:21,621 --> 01:24:23,350
He must trust you.

844
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:26,191
I guess he does.

845
01:24:30,063 --> 01:24:33,055
You play this for all the girls,
old C-17?

846
01:24:36,402 --> 01:24:37,960
First time.

847
01:24:39,505 --> 01:24:41,439
You an honest man, Arlis Sweeney?

848
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:44,643
Yes, ma'am.

849
01:24:48,314 --> 01:24:50,111
You like the dress?

850
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,518
I like the dress.

851
01:24:56,589 --> 01:24:58,523
You like the girl?

852
01:25:02,161 --> 01:25:04,391
I'd say she's the prettiest one
in the room.

853
01:25:07,667 --> 01:25:09,498
Pretty enough to dance with?

854
01:25:14,173 --> 01:25:16,573
Well...

855
01:25:18,678 --> 01:25:20,737
Now, don't tell me you don't.

856
01:25:25,618 --> 01:25:28,052
Well, don't you think
it's about time you learned?

857
01:25:29,389 --> 01:25:31,880
Dancin'...

858
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,550
frees the soul.

859
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:55,124
Howdy, partner.

860
01:27:59,638 --> 01:28:03,335
That's all I get after last night?

861
01:28:05,444 --> 01:28:07,378
Mornin'.

862
01:28:09,681 --> 01:28:11,171
Good mornin', darlin'.

863
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,878
Why don't you shake on
into the kitchen...

864
01:28:13,952 --> 01:28:15,920
and crack me a beer?

865
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:19,481
Need some help?

866
01:28:22,561 --> 01:28:25,462
Get me two cases of Milky Ways
by 9:00 a. M...

867
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:27,795
'cause that's what my hired man's
gonna be lookin' to take with him...

868
01:28:27,866 --> 01:28:29,925
back to Crockett County.

869
01:28:30,002 --> 01:28:32,266
I haven't even got me one case.

870
01:28:32,337 --> 01:28:34,498
Hell, I ain't got
a Milky Way, period.

871
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,208
Well, I'm sure the good people
of Crockett County...

872
01:28:37,276 --> 01:28:40,040
can do without a Milky Way
for a day or two.

873
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,414
It's my job, all right?

874
01:28:46,785 --> 01:28:49,276
We're a little surly
in the morning, aren't we?

875
01:28:50,589 --> 01:28:52,955
That's okay.
It runs in my family too.

876
01:28:53,025 --> 01:28:54,856
What's that?

877
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:59,227
The morning bear.
I said it runs in my family too.

878
01:29:00,466 --> 01:29:02,127
What else runs in your family?

879
01:29:06,538 --> 01:29:09,098
Your family.
You never talk about 'em.

880
01:29:11,076 --> 01:29:13,442
Believe me, there's a lot more
interesting things to talk about...

881
01:29:13,512 --> 01:29:15,673
than my family.

882
01:29:15,747 --> 01:29:19,148
I already told you everything
that's worth tellin' anyway.

883
01:29:19,218 --> 01:29:22,085
Besides, I haven't
seen them in years.

884
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:24,088
Not since I got married.

885
01:29:25,424 --> 01:29:28,552
But when you were a kid growin' up,
what were they like?

886
01:29:28,627 --> 01:29:31,994
What'd your mother do?
What'd your father do?

887
01:29:33,732 --> 01:29:37,099
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you were crowdin' me.

888
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,732
Maybe you don't know me.

889
01:29:45,444 --> 01:29:47,742
What'd my father do?

890
01:29:47,813 --> 01:29:51,340
Drink mostly. Gamble.

891
01:29:51,416 --> 01:29:54,078
Lost everything we had eventually.
That's how I met Reese.

892
01:29:56,488 --> 01:29:59,150
Went to go collect my father one
night at this place in the woods...

893
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:01,158
where there was always
an all-night game...

894
01:30:01,226 --> 01:30:03,854
and there they were,
sittin' shoulder-to-shoulder...

895
01:30:03,929 --> 01:30:06,056
two drunks...

896
01:30:06,131 --> 01:30:08,964
Losing money faster than
one sober fool ever could.

897
01:30:10,435 --> 01:30:13,336
Of course, I was a real fool.

898
01:30:13,405 --> 01:30:18,342
Ended up takin' Reese home.
Stayed to make his breakfast.

899
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:20,002
Never left.

900
01:30:21,747 --> 01:30:23,442
Why the sudden interest?

901
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:27,977
Nothin'. I'm just...

902
01:30:30,956 --> 01:30:34,187
I happened to see that photograph...

903
01:30:34,259 --> 01:30:36,227
in your suitcase.

904
01:30:36,295 --> 01:30:38,160
Well, that's not me.

905
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:40,357
It is me, but it isn't.

906
01:30:42,234 --> 01:30:44,896
See, my parents...
The only parents I've ever known...

907
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:47,461
are really my aunt and uncle
by blood.

908
01:30:47,539 --> 01:30:49,837
I mean...

909
01:30:49,908 --> 01:30:52,468
the people in the photograph
I never knew.

910
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:55,172
They were lost when I was a baby.
Killed.

911
01:30:56,882 --> 01:30:58,474
Car accident.

912
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,153
Car accident?

913
01:31:04,223 --> 01:31:07,715
When I was old enough to know, I was
given the picture and told about it.

914
01:31:10,362 --> 01:31:12,956
I don't know why I hang onto it.
It's just...

915
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:22,763
You grow up in an ugly house
the way I did...

916
01:31:24,676 --> 01:31:26,940
sometimes you wonder
how it might have been...

917
01:31:29,114 --> 01:31:31,275
if things hadn't happened
the way they did.

918
01:31:32,384 --> 01:31:35,876
It's funny.
Your father the other day...

919
01:31:35,954 --> 01:31:37,717
mentioned Benson County.

920
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:41,115
That's where they lived,
I'm pretty sure.

921
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:45,096
The people in the picture.

922
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:50,457
My family.

923
01:32:07,953 --> 01:32:09,545
I'm about ready.

924
01:32:12,891 --> 01:32:14,324
Listen.

925
01:32:17,362 --> 01:32:20,297
I think maybe it'd be better
you stay here.

926
01:32:23,635 --> 01:32:26,297
Stay here?

927
01:32:27,606 --> 01:32:29,767
While I run up the road
to tend to Elliot.

928
01:32:37,716 --> 01:32:39,911
There's some money over there.

929
01:32:39,985 --> 01:32:42,647
Get yourself something to eat
while l...

930
01:32:42,721 --> 01:32:44,313
while I'm gone.

931
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,628
Well, they must make
one hell of a Spanish omelette.

932
01:33:01,273 --> 01:33:03,207
All right, I'll wait for ya.

933
01:33:15,854 --> 01:33:18,186
You don't want to be
going anywhere without this.

934
01:33:24,229 --> 01:33:26,663
Earl's Truck Stop
over in Coke County...

935
01:33:26,732 --> 01:33:28,666
run out of Cheez-Its again.

936
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:31,532
Cheez-Its and truckers.
They sure go together.

937
01:33:32,671 --> 01:33:34,662
And Phil Pritchard wants you
to ring him up...

938
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:37,766
about puttin' another Coke machine
in his ice rink.

939
01:33:37,843 --> 01:33:39,868
I can't figure why
he waited so long.

940
01:33:39,945 --> 01:33:43,574
- Two years I've been tellin' him.
- You're a little light here.

941
01:33:43,648 --> 01:33:46,549
Yeah, well, I had trouble
with the Mexicans again.

942
01:33:46,618 --> 01:33:48,017
They hurt the machines?

943
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:50,646
Nothin' I couldn't put right
with a crowbar.

944
01:33:50,722 --> 01:33:53,020
I had to replace the brace on one.
Slung it with...

945
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:54,991
a three-Quarter inch York.

946
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,119
- That should solve your problem.
- Should.

947
01:33:57,195 --> 01:33:59,561
But those boys are strong.

948
01:33:59,631 --> 01:34:02,259
Hell knows I couldn't pop her.

949
01:34:02,334 --> 01:34:05,462
- Without the key?
- Yeah.

950
01:34:05,537 --> 01:34:08,438
Well, that's what I meant...
without the key.

951
01:34:12,344 --> 01:34:15,438
You look like you had
one too many cups of coffee, Elliot.

952
01:34:15,514 --> 01:34:17,448
It's the chill, I guess.

953
01:34:20,085 --> 01:34:22,019
Are you stealin' from me?

954
01:34:27,058 --> 01:34:30,152
You know I did time in Big Spring.

955
01:34:30,228 --> 01:34:32,465
I told you that
right off day we met.

956
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:36,632
But I did the time.

957
01:34:36,702 --> 01:34:39,500
I'm out now...

958
01:34:39,572 --> 01:34:41,540
and I want to stay that way.

959
01:34:43,142 --> 01:34:46,373
I'm not sure
that answers my Question.

960
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,618
You don't know...

961
01:34:56,689 --> 01:34:58,623
'cause you've never been in trouble.

962
01:34:59,725 --> 01:35:02,193
But once you been in trouble...

963
01:35:02,261 --> 01:35:04,855
and people know it...

964
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:07,558
you feel guilty for things
you never done.

965
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:11,435
Just because you know...

966
01:35:11,504 --> 01:35:13,438
they think you got it in you.

967
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:17,133
That potential.

968
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,314
Is that why your hands are shaking?

969
01:35:25,918 --> 01:35:28,011
That's why my hands are shaking.

970
01:35:30,422 --> 01:35:32,515
I like my job, Arlis.

971
01:35:34,994 --> 01:35:36,791
I like you.

972
01:35:42,868 --> 01:35:45,496
I like you too, Elliot.

973
01:35:45,571 --> 01:35:47,505
I'll see you next week.

974
01:35:55,281 --> 01:35:58,876
And Elliot,
that business about the machines...

975
01:35:59,985 --> 01:36:01,919
It ain't the Mexicans.

976
01:36:03,289 --> 01:36:05,723
Up there they blame everything
on the Mexicans.

977
01:36:35,888 --> 01:36:39,881
We asked 100 women this question.
Give me the most popular answer...

978
01:36:39,959 --> 01:36:42,120
from the 100 women who answered.

979
01:36:42,194 --> 01:36:45,823
Tell me a reason why
women leave their husbands.

980
01:36:45,898 --> 01:36:47,160
Infidelity.

981
01:36:47,232 --> 01:36:49,257
Did our women say infidelity?

982
01:36:50,502 --> 01:36:52,333
It's number one!

983
01:37:16,862 --> 01:37:18,796
Who needs him anyway?

984
01:37:43,822 --> 01:37:45,289
Stardust Motel.

985
01:37:45,357 --> 01:37:47,985
Emma, it's Arlis.

986
01:37:48,059 --> 01:37:50,027
Ring 12 for me, will you?

987
01:37:51,229 --> 01:37:54,892
Not unless you wanna talk to
Theresa. She's pulling the sheets.

988
01:37:54,966 --> 01:37:57,560
Speaking of which, what do you
want me to do with the suitcase?

989
01:37:57,636 --> 01:37:58,796
Suitcase?

990
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:02,431
I'll have Jimmy put it in
Maintenance. Just give me the word.

991
01:38:02,507 --> 01:38:04,134
I don't follow you.
Where's the lady?

992
01:38:04,209 --> 01:38:06,871
Gone. Been gone
about an hour now.

993
01:38:06,945 --> 01:38:09,914
They just got in the car and left.

994
01:38:09,981 --> 01:38:12,541
They? Who's they?

995
01:38:12,617 --> 01:38:15,279
She and her friend.
A young lady in sunglasses.

996
01:38:15,353 --> 01:38:16,877
A real stinger, that one.

997
01:38:16,955 --> 01:38:19,583
Asked me for directions
three times...

998
01:38:19,658 --> 01:38:21,819
then liked to take half
the guest mints from the bowl.

999
01:38:21,893 --> 01:38:24,088
I swear, some people
just have no manners.

1000
01:38:24,162 --> 01:38:26,027
They say where they were goin'?

1001
01:38:26,097 --> 01:38:29,498
Up north, I guess. The young one
had gotten turned around.

1002
01:38:29,568 --> 01:38:31,695
Wanted to know how
to get back on the farm route.

1003
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:35,604
That doesn't help much. They
could be anywhere in the county.

1004
01:38:41,646 --> 01:38:43,580
It suits you... the dress.

1005
01:38:45,584 --> 01:38:47,677
Well, you can have it back
if that's what you mean.

1006
01:38:47,752 --> 01:38:50,084
I'm just sayin' it suits you,
that's all.

1007
01:38:52,557 --> 01:38:55,219
You might think about doin'
something with your hair.

1008
01:38:55,293 --> 01:38:57,784
You got a nice face.
You should let the boys see it.

1009
01:38:59,864 --> 01:39:02,765
It ain't my face
the boys wanna see.

1010
01:39:04,869 --> 01:39:06,803
Maybe you haven't met
the right boy.

1011
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:09,772
- And you have?
- I thought so.

1012
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:12,469
Last night, at least,
but now l...

1013
01:39:12,544 --> 01:39:14,705
I don't know what to think.

1014
01:39:14,779 --> 01:39:17,612
Look, you can't figure men.

1015
01:39:17,682 --> 01:39:19,877
So don't run yourself
ragged tryin'.

1016
01:39:19,951 --> 01:39:22,351
I guess. I don't know why
he just didn't call me himself.

1017
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:24,445
I told you, it's a surprise.

1018
01:39:25,523 --> 01:39:27,616
I don't even know
what's goin' on myself.

1019
01:39:33,298 --> 01:39:35,596
I'm just doin' what I was told.

1020
01:39:54,686 --> 01:39:57,621
Well, here we are.

1021
01:39:59,391 --> 01:40:00,790
This is where we're goin'?

1022
01:40:04,829 --> 01:40:06,421
I don't...

1023
01:40:11,903 --> 01:40:13,427
Oh, my God.

1024
01:40:16,441 --> 01:40:18,432
Surprise.

1025
01:40:47,839 --> 01:40:49,272
Howdy.

1026
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,414
She's some old dame, ain't she?

1027
01:41:02,153 --> 01:41:05,122
Look at that face, sweet pea.
Does that break your heart?

1028
01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:06,782
To pieces.

1029
01:41:10,562 --> 01:41:12,496
First time you've seen it?

1030
01:41:14,032 --> 01:41:16,330
- How did he know?
- What's that now?

1031
01:41:16,401 --> 01:41:18,562
The house.

1032
01:41:18,636 --> 01:41:21,264
How did he know where it was?

1033
01:41:21,339 --> 01:41:23,307
Oh, Arlis.

1034
01:41:23,374 --> 01:41:25,604
He knows a lot more
than he lets on.

1035
01:41:25,677 --> 01:41:28,339
Anyway, sweet pea saw it and...

1036
01:41:28,413 --> 01:41:30,574
said something about a photograph.

1037
01:41:30,648 --> 01:41:32,582
- That about right?
- Right.

1038
01:41:36,387 --> 01:41:38,048
Where is he?

1039
01:41:38,123 --> 01:41:39,715
He'll be along.

1040
01:41:41,559 --> 01:41:45,859
Say, you wanna take a little look
inside there, look around?

1041
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,522
Well, go on.

1042
01:41:48,967 --> 01:41:50,730
But you be careful, now.

1043
01:41:54,439 --> 01:41:56,373
Watch yourself,
especially on them stairs there.

1044
01:41:56,441 --> 01:41:59,035
There's more termites
than there is timber by now.

1045
01:42:12,223 --> 01:42:14,953
How was the movie?

1046
01:42:15,026 --> 01:42:17,426
I got here as fast as I could.

1047
01:42:19,164 --> 01:42:20,825
You talk to that clerk there
at the motel?

1048
01:42:22,634 --> 01:42:25,262
Dropped enough crumbs
for a flock of geese.

1049
01:42:26,805 --> 01:42:29,171
That's ten minutes.
Where the hell you been?

1050
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:32,971
She had to pee twice...

1051
01:42:33,044 --> 01:42:35,740
and I had to make
a little stop of my own.

1052
01:42:39,083 --> 01:42:42,052
I know how grim you get,
you don't get your breakfast.

1053
01:42:48,459 --> 01:42:50,518
You're smarter than I thought.

1054
01:42:50,595 --> 01:42:52,688
I'm not smart enough to figure out
what we're doin'...

1055
01:42:52,764 --> 01:42:55,756
wastin' our time out here
in cracker land.

1056
01:42:57,535 --> 01:42:59,969
I'm gonna tell you all about
loose ends some day.

1057
01:43:01,673 --> 01:43:04,369
And you'll want to listen careful.

1058
01:43:47,218 --> 01:43:50,210
You look like you've seen
a ghost there, Junior.

1059
01:43:50,288 --> 01:43:52,518
I hope you brought some food.

1060
01:43:57,195 --> 01:43:59,720
You all right?

1061
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:03,458
Hell, he's fine. Just fine.

1062
01:44:05,336 --> 01:44:08,430
Cat's got his tongue is all.

1063
01:44:09,173 --> 01:44:12,438
Come on up.
There's something I wanna show you.

1064
01:44:19,984 --> 01:44:22,179
Watch your step, son.

1065
01:44:41,873 --> 01:44:43,807
It's like heaven, isn't it?

1066
01:44:43,875 --> 01:44:47,311
My mother must have stood
right here...

1067
01:44:47,378 --> 01:44:49,107
brushin' her hair...

1068
01:44:51,082 --> 01:44:52,515
daydreamin'.

1069
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:00,987
I think I figured it out.

1070
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:06,459
I must've slept in here...

1071
01:45:08,199 --> 01:45:09,791
or there.

1072
01:45:13,905 --> 01:45:16,874
No. In front.

1073
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:27,641
In those days, houses like these...

1074
01:45:27,719 --> 01:45:30,779
they used to put the baby
in the front of the house.

1075
01:45:30,855 --> 01:45:33,449
That way, if a woman was hangin'
laundry and the baby cried...

1076
01:45:33,525 --> 01:45:35,686
she could hear.

1077
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,524
Maybe my mother hung laundry
out back.

1078
01:45:40,799 --> 01:45:42,733
Sun's strongest in the front.

1079
01:45:44,069 --> 01:45:48,028
You seem to know more about me
than I do, so why don't you tell me.

1080
01:45:48,106 --> 01:45:52,509
Were my parents good people?
Were they nice to baby Kay?

1081
01:45:56,081 --> 01:45:57,844
I'm sure they were.

1082
01:46:01,219 --> 01:46:05,622
- What makes you so sure?
- 'Cause you're good people.

1083
01:46:07,225 --> 01:46:10,752
And good people
come from good people.

1084
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:14,364
Ain't that right, son?

1085
01:46:14,432 --> 01:46:17,492
- That's right.
- I'm not so sure that's true.

1086
01:46:20,405 --> 01:46:22,305
But it's nice of you to say.

1087
01:46:22,373 --> 01:46:24,705
No, I'm...

1088
01:46:24,776 --> 01:46:29,338
I'm not just saying it.
I know it, and that's a fact.

1089
01:46:29,414 --> 01:46:31,746
I'm gonna go outside.

1090
01:46:31,816 --> 01:46:34,478
That's a good idea.
Would you do me a favor?

1091
01:46:34,552 --> 01:46:36,520
Would you take Ginnie
while you're at it?

1092
01:46:36,588 --> 01:46:39,614
She's probably down there
bitin' on her nails by now.

1093
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:44,954
- I'll go with you.
- No.

1094
01:46:45,029 --> 01:46:48,863
I need to talk to you.
Father to son, you know.

1095
01:46:50,268 --> 01:46:52,736
Let the girls get some wind
in their hair.

1096
01:47:03,948 --> 01:47:08,351
We could walk for days, I bet,
and never see anything but this.

1097
01:47:08,419 --> 01:47:10,410
Wouldn't that be a thrill.

1098
01:47:12,857 --> 01:47:16,293
See, it was the girl, sweet pea,
that first mentioned it...

1099
01:47:16,361 --> 01:47:18,761
the house being the same and all.

1100
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:21,526
I thought she had it all wrong,
naturally.

1101
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:25,262
See, I knew I never seen
this woman of yours before...

1102
01:47:25,336 --> 01:47:28,567
'cause I never forget a face.

1103
01:47:30,275 --> 01:47:31,708
But...

1104
01:47:34,212 --> 01:47:37,579
Still, there was something
doggin' me. A sound.

1105
01:47:38,716 --> 01:47:43,619
Halfway to Shreveport, I see a lady
standin' by the side of the road.

1106
01:47:43,688 --> 01:47:45,485
A mother.

1107
01:47:45,557 --> 01:47:47,525
And that's when I knew what it was.

1108
01:47:49,260 --> 01:47:52,718
That sound in my head...

1109
01:47:52,797 --> 01:47:54,389
her cryin'.

1110
01:47:56,634 --> 01:47:59,102
You see, I had forgotten...

1111
01:48:01,005 --> 01:48:02,495
about the baby.

1112
01:48:11,249 --> 01:48:14,241
What's that sound?
You hear it?

1113
01:48:17,622 --> 01:48:19,055
Bugs.

1114
01:48:26,397 --> 01:48:29,127
She doesn't know.

1115
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,328
There's no reason for her to know,
no reason for me to tell her.

1116
01:48:33,271 --> 01:48:35,330
I realize that.

1117
01:48:35,406 --> 01:48:37,636
I truly, truly do.

1118
01:48:40,078 --> 01:48:41,705
But this woman, she's different.

1119
01:48:41,779 --> 01:48:46,045
See, I noticed that
the first time I seen her.

1120
01:48:46,117 --> 01:48:49,575
The way she looked at you
and the way you looked at her.

1121
01:48:49,654 --> 01:48:51,679
It was touching, truly.

1122
01:48:51,756 --> 01:48:54,748
She'll never know.

1123
01:48:54,826 --> 01:48:58,353
I swear it on my life.

1124
01:48:58,429 --> 01:49:01,193
Damn, I wish I could believe that.

1125
01:49:03,534 --> 01:49:06,196
But as much as we are the same...

1126
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:08,205
you've always been
a little too emotional.

1127
01:49:08,273 --> 01:49:11,709
I left her this mornin'.

1128
01:49:11,776 --> 01:49:15,405
I only came back 'cause of you.
This little game.

1129
01:49:17,615 --> 01:49:19,549
This ain't no game, Junior.

1130
01:49:21,986 --> 01:49:23,920
You know me better than that.

1131
01:49:29,727 --> 01:49:32,662
I must be out of my fuckin' mind.

1132
01:49:37,835 --> 01:49:40,929
It's not gonna change, you know!

1133
01:49:41,005 --> 01:49:43,872
They don't grow this stuff
but one color.

1134
01:49:48,646 --> 01:49:50,876
It's a shame, really.

1135
01:49:50,949 --> 01:49:54,350
She's so sweet.
Almost innocent.

1136
01:49:54,419 --> 01:49:58,446
She is innocent. But I'm not.

1137
01:50:01,259 --> 01:50:02,851
Take me...

1138
01:50:04,929 --> 01:50:06,624
and she can't know.

1139
01:50:06,698 --> 01:50:09,098
I couldn't do that.

1140
01:50:11,302 --> 01:50:14,328
What kind of man
would that make me?

1141
01:50:14,405 --> 01:50:16,532
A man who'd shoot his own kin.

1142
01:50:17,809 --> 01:50:22,212
I couldn't sleep with that,
and I do prize my sleep.

1143
01:50:23,715 --> 01:50:26,548
There's really only
one Question here, son.

1144
01:50:26,617 --> 01:50:29,177
Do I do it...

1145
01:50:29,253 --> 01:50:31,221
or you?

1146
01:50:47,405 --> 01:50:49,339
I could hear 'em.

1147
01:50:51,242 --> 01:50:53,472
You don't mind if I smoke,
do you?

1148
01:50:55,847 --> 01:50:58,975
You know how I always enjoyed
a good cigar.

1149
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:03,487
That's what separates me from other
men... I can tell the difference.

1150
01:51:03,554 --> 01:51:06,819
A good cigar's not what
separates you from other men.

1151
01:51:06,891 --> 01:51:11,328
What separates you, Junior?
You fuck their wives?

1152
01:51:11,396 --> 01:51:13,364
I don't shoot their children.

1153
01:51:13,431 --> 01:51:16,832
You'd done what you were told, there
would have been no blood that night.

1154
01:51:18,036 --> 01:51:19,697
I didn't pull the trigger.

1155
01:51:19,771 --> 01:51:23,036
But you opened the door,
and they were supposed to be asleep.

1156
01:51:23,107 --> 01:51:25,041
And you know they're always
supposed to be asleep.

1157
01:51:25,109 --> 01:51:29,569
Besides, wasn't me that shot first.
I had no choice.

1158
01:51:32,617 --> 01:51:36,553
And the boy?
Did he have a choice?

1159
01:51:36,621 --> 01:51:39,784
Fuck that little boy!
He almost got your daddy killed.

1160
01:51:56,707 --> 01:51:59,175
We had one bad night.

1161
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:02,472
It was 30 years ago.

1162
01:52:05,183 --> 01:52:07,913
There was more than one bad night.

1163
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:11,548
But that was your night,
wasn't it, Junior?

1164
01:52:16,594 --> 01:52:18,585
You're right.

1165
01:52:18,663 --> 01:52:20,927
You didn't pull the trigger.

1166
01:52:20,998 --> 01:52:23,193
You did open the door.

1167
01:52:23,267 --> 01:52:27,101
And now, you brung her to me.

1168
01:52:32,343 --> 01:52:36,177
You're stupid.
You've always been stupid.

1169
01:52:36,247 --> 01:52:39,683
You was stupid
when you were a little kid.

1170
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:42,275
As a man, shit,
you're being stupid now.

1171
01:52:42,353 --> 01:52:45,288
Who's got the gun, boy? Me?

1172
01:52:46,557 --> 01:52:50,425
Go ahead, son.
Put it on me and pull the trigger.

1173
01:52:51,395 --> 01:52:52,987
Come on.

1174
01:52:58,002 --> 01:53:01,130
See, you can't.
You just can't.

1175
01:53:01,205 --> 01:53:05,107
You can't because we're kin.

1176
01:53:05,176 --> 01:53:06,609
Blood.

1177
01:53:13,951 --> 01:53:18,115
Look, you go ahead and run along
and fill up them candy machines.

1178
01:53:20,558 --> 01:53:22,492
It's only right that I do it.

1179
01:53:24,529 --> 01:53:26,929
This way, we both will sleep easy.

1180
01:53:39,944 --> 01:53:41,275
Dad?

1181
01:53:41,346 --> 01:53:43,814
Son?

1182
01:53:46,151 --> 01:53:47,584
Sweet dreams.

1183
01:54:46,511 --> 01:54:49,275
- What happened?
- Get in the truck.

1184
01:54:49,347 --> 01:54:51,281
- But...
- Get in the truck!

1185
01:55:24,482 --> 01:55:26,416
Everything he told you...

1186
01:55:30,221 --> 01:55:31,688
it's a lie.

1187
01:56:01,819 --> 01:56:03,548
Thanks for the advice.

1188
01:57:03,081 --> 01:57:05,345
Don't be in a hurry to leave.

1189
01:57:07,485 --> 01:57:11,012
They know me here for years, so
you just stay as long as you want.

1190
01:57:13,624 --> 01:57:15,615
Until you figure out
your next step.

1191
01:57:19,931 --> 01:57:21,796
You got your key?

1192
01:57:25,002 --> 01:57:26,026
Yeah.

1193
01:57:27,171 --> 01:57:29,105
I got my key.

1194
01:57:33,644 --> 01:57:35,976
What was I doin'
in that house today?

1195
01:57:40,718 --> 01:57:43,482
Or am I crowdin' you?

1196
01:57:48,459 --> 01:57:50,393
There are some things that...

1197
01:57:52,497 --> 01:57:54,431
are better left unsaid.

1198
01:57:57,168 --> 01:57:59,762
It just does no good
to talk about 'em.

1199
01:58:02,673 --> 01:58:04,607
No good at all.

1200
01:58:08,579 --> 01:58:11,639
It's like I said.
I'm a creature of habit.

1201
01:58:13,584 --> 01:58:17,350
Each town I go,
there's a place to eat...

1202
01:58:17,422 --> 01:58:19,014
place to sleep.

1203
01:58:21,926 --> 01:58:24,861
And in each town,
there's also a woman.

1204
01:58:26,731 --> 01:58:28,665
I'm startin' to miss 'em.

1205
01:58:31,102 --> 01:58:32,694
Sure, I understand.

1206
01:58:34,205 --> 01:58:37,265
I just sort of
fell into your life anyway.

1207
01:58:37,341 --> 01:58:40,538
There wasn't any reason to it.
God knows I've been a burden.

1208
01:58:43,181 --> 01:58:44,773
It's just...

1209
01:58:51,022 --> 01:58:53,582
I really haven't been myself
these last few days.

1210
01:58:53,658 --> 01:58:55,319
Yes, you have.

1211
01:58:57,562 --> 01:59:00,224
You've been fine.

1212
01:59:04,402 --> 01:59:05,994
Better than fine.

1213
01:59:12,777 --> 01:59:15,109
Looks like they're almost gone.

1214
01:59:16,781 --> 01:59:18,373
The bruises.

1215
01:59:37,668 --> 01:59:39,260
I better go.

1216
01:59:43,908 --> 01:59:47,309
I got a jukebox up the road
that's only playin' George Jones.

1217
01:59:50,348 --> 01:59:52,282
That ain't so bad.

1218
01:59:56,487 --> 01:59:59,047
I guess not.

1219
02:00:12,303 --> 02:00:14,737
I stumble on any of those
blue dimes of yours...

1220
02:00:14,805 --> 02:00:17,740
maybe I'll use a couple of'em...

1221
02:00:17,808 --> 02:00:19,867
give you a call,
let you know how I'm doin'.

1222
02:00:22,346 --> 02:00:24,473
You know where to find me.

1223
02:00:28,886 --> 02:00:31,684
What's that on your pocket?

1224
02:00:39,630 --> 02:00:41,222
That's nothin'.

1225
02:00:43,334 --> 02:00:45,268
It's just a little blood.

1226
02:06:12,334 --> 02:06:13,268
{{{the end}}}
