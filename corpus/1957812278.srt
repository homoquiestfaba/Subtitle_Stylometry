19
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,760

"Thank you for flying...

21
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
the number one on-time airline"...

22
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,360
rolling in two hours late.

23
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,320
Speaking of delays,
did you call him yet?

24
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
No, I didn't call him.

25
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,120
I don't want to call him
from an airport.

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,400
Catherine, just get it over with.

27
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,880

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,040

29
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,040
I'll try. I'm gonna try standby.

30
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,440
The flight is delayed.
It gets in at...

31
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,840

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,440

33
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,600

00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,760
I'm going to the gate right now.

35
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Don't worry. I'm gonna make it.

36
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,800

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,040
No, that's okay.

39
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,600
- I'll try him later.
- Leave your name.

40
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,440
Could you just tell him that
Catherine Parmel called?

41
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,560
No. Don't page him.

42
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,360
- I'm gonna try him later.
- When is he home?

43
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,320
I was just wondering, is he home
this weekend by any chance?

44
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,280
Okay. Alright. Thanks.

45
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,480
- Why did I do that?
- Is he home?

46
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,480
Yes, he's home. Okay, you know what?

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,480
I've just got to go to D.C.
and see him.

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,800
- Yeah, you should.
- Right, Maybe I should call him.

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,440
No, go see him tonight.

50
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,400
But my flight
doesn't get into Atlanta until 6.00.

51
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,640
Switch with me.
I've got the Chicago-D.C. flight.

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,920
You'll be in by eight o'clock.

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,760
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

54
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,800
Go.

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,120
Okay.

56
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,440
Thanks a lot. Alright.
I'll call you later tomorrow.

57
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,600
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.

58
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,760
This is your final boarding call.

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
Sorry, folks, about this delay.

60
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,400
As you know. Global is
the number one on-time airline.

61
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,200
Air traffic control has us on hold.

62
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
We're now looking at...

63
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,040
a departure time at about 12.20.

64
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Our flight path will take us...

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,280
northeast over Las Vegas...

66
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,720
eastbound over Denver,
and just south of Omaha, and then...

67
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,920

- How ya doin', sweetheart?

68
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000

69
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
- Good.
- Flight time today is just under...

70
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
four hours and that should put us...

71
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,640
- into Chicago at about 6.30.
- Color in the lines.

72
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
- I'll try.
- Again,

73
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,600
we apologize for the delay
and thank you for choosing Global.

74
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
Tower, this is Global 1025.

75
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,040
We're gonna have to refuel
if we wait much longer.

76
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,760
Southwest 876 out of gate 9.

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
Southwest 876, hold short...

78
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,720
we'll try and get ya out to taxi.

79
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,200

80
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560

82
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,720
Global 1025 on the roll.

83
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
Flight attendants prepare for...

84
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
take off.

85
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,160

86
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,920

Reaching.

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

91
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
if you'd like to listen in...

92
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,480
on our voice communication

93
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,240
you'll find it on channel nine.

94
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,200
Northern 343, radar contact lost,
can you make the airport?

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
- We got a double flame out.
- Tower...

96
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
you gotta find us a highway here.

97
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,360
What the hell happened to the fuel?

98
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
Northern 343 Des Moines airport...

99
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,280
is twelve o'clock, eight miles.

100
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,160
Can't make that tower.
Let's get the next clear...

101
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,320
- over to...
- There's a highway over there.

102
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,440
- No cars.
- Is that straight?

103
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
No.

104
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,080
- We're gonna have to take it.
- Flaps.

105
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,080
- They're all the way down.
- I hope we can do it.

106
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,720
We're gonna do it. I've got it.

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
- I've got it.
- Gonna land over that guy. That guy.

108
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,080
See that guy? Don't stall it.

109
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,400
We're gonna do it right here.

110
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,280
We're gonna feel it.
We're gonna put it down. Here we go.

111
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,760
What's the cause?

112
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,520
Pilot error. Ran out of fuel.

113
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,920
Details, details.

114
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,840
Catherine called.

115
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,200
- Catherine? Catherine Parmel?
- Yeah.

116
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,320
What'd she want?

117
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,280
She didn't say.
Are you still seeing each other?

118
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,920
No. She moved to Atlanta.

119
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,560
What'd she say?

120
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,680
She wanted to know if you're
gonna be home this weekend.

121
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,800
And you said?

122
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
You're seeing her.

123
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
No, I am not seeing her.

124
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,840
- What'd you tell her?
- I told her that...

125
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
I thought you'd be around.

126
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,160
So do you want me to go back
to Des Moinesand finish this up?

127
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,760
No. Just get a statement from
the maintenance crew and close it.

128
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,920
I need that file by next week.

129
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,480
How do you run out of fuel?

130
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,840
Karen. Mack.

131
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Here ya go.

132
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,080
American 3721...

133
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,280
fly heading zero niner zero, vectors
for traffic. Expect direct buckeye.

134
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,760
- Who needs caffeine?
- Yeah, a coffee run!

135
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,440
- Where's the rookie?
- I got it. Right here.

136
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,120
Black, sugar, tea,
low fat, don't tell me.

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Man, you gonna work the busiest
airspace in the country...

138
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,800
and you can't take a coffee order?

139
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Nonfat, extra sugar.

140
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,920
Nice guess.

141
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,080
You're regular and...

142
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,160
- Decaf.
- God. I knew that.

143
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,640
- I knew that.
- We're going the wrong way.

144
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,080
Jack. I need fifteen,
I can't handle ten mile spacing.

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,960
I've got severe turbulence
into Chicago.

146
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,160
We need to be slowing traffic down,
not speeding it up.

147
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,120
Alright, fine.

148
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,240
D.C. central flow has ordered
ten mile spacing.

149
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,360
Ten? Frank, we're backed up as it is.

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,880
I've gotta pull
some of these guys off soon.

151
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,520
Just do it.

152
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,560
Where the hell is Drake?

153
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,240
Harold, you know the rules.

154
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,480
Henry, you son of
a miserable pissant...

155
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,480
pain in the ass.

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Come on. We need you
out on the floor.

157
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,840
Apparently you've forgotten,
once again, we've a union contract.

158
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,240
Henry, do not give me grief today,
alright? Let's go.

159
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,520
Breaks over in...

160
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,920
- one minute and forty seconds.
- Look, I don't make the rules.

161
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,520
Just get on the floor
and do your job.

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
Hey, rookie.

163
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,960
What's goin' on? Still bein' hazed?

164
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
No, not too bad.

165
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,960
See, they can't fire me.
You know why?

166
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,480
No, man, I don't know. I'm tryin'
to keep the order straight.

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
I know too much.

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,360
Black, sugar, nonfat,
half-and-half, regular...

169
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,960
- November 63, possible traffic...
- cream.

170
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
- eleven o'clock, eight miles...

- Helen.

175
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,520
- the last one, Henry.
- No, this is great.

176
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
It's about this computer system
that wakes up one morning...

177
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,640
not only alive and
a conscious being, right?

178
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
But so independent that it rebels...

179
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,520
against the human masters here
on Earth.

180
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,680
Henry, I want escape.

181
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,760
We'll escape together.

182
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,720
How many flights a day
did you have in training?

183
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,960
About one fifty.

184
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
Now you got almost eight thousand.

185
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,520
Watch me,
I'm gonna make a sandwich here.

186
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,000
Put this guy to twenty-three
and move this guy to twenty-one...

187
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,840
and squeeze this guy in
at twenty-two.

188
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
A lot of people in that sandwich.

189
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,080

193
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,760
I told you, man,
you cannot think in this job.

194
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,520
Tristate 602, reduce speed at 280.

195
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
You start thinkin' about passengers,
you'll hesitate.

196
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,760
If you hesitate, you're goin' down.

197
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,400
Good evening. Global 1025.

198

You know, not having
a team of your own and all.

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520
At least we don't have the Cubs.

203
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,560
Is that right? Bunch of losers.

204
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,400
Hand off Global 1025.

205
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,640
I got 'em.

206
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,280

324
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,320
Karen, what happened to the plane?

325
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,720
Why won't anybody tell me
what happened to the planes?

326
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,680
God, no.

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,480
Use it as a temporary morgue.
Move bodies only.

Don't touch the wreckage
till I say so.

333
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,080
What? Yeah, it could be
an air traffic control problem.

334
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
Make sure the controller at Midwest
is secured. Get his name...

335
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,240
his statement, have the F.A.A.
test him for drugs and alcohol.

336
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
- I'll check in later.
- Who's missing?

337
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,000
Kim Garfield. I spoke to her
a half hour ago.

338
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,320
She was at a conference in New York.

339
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,680
- She'll meet us in Chicago.
- Does she know this is my case?

340
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,040
She does now.
She wasn't too happy about it.

341
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,520
That's just too bad, isn't it?

342
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,560
- Yes. More this way.
- In here?

343
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,240
I'll meet you on board.

344
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,440
- I don't wanna see this.
- Alright.

345
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,880
We got a family here.

346
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
- How long?
- Please. My God!

347
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,600
Come on. Who's on that plane?

348
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
You'll all know as soon as I know.

349
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,560
If you need to make a call.

350
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,440
We'll have phones set up
in fifteen minutes.

351
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,280
Looks pretty bad.
There's the cockpit.

352
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,960
- John Dantley.
- Jack Colson.

353
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,560
- Kim Garfield, Paul Roth.
- Jack Colson.

354
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
- Search and Rescue. Listen.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

355
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,800
We gotta hike in
a ways to the crash site.

356
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,560
It's just up over that crest,
so follow me and I'll take ya up.

357
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,520
Alright, we think the left wing...

358
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,160
clipped the top of
these tall trees here.

359
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,360
We've got the main impact area here.

360
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,560
Let's go.

361
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,440
Kim, note this.

362
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,720
It looks like complete destruction
of the aircraft...

363
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,880
behind the cockpit
with subsequent post-crash fire.

364
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,800
Jack, get the local police. I want
that area below the ridge sealed off.

365
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,320
N.T.S.B. only. No press, no public.
Just Search and Rescue.

366
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,960
How many bodies
have we recovered so far?

367
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,080
We got seventy.

368
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,760
Let's start documenting the wreckage.

369
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,720
Find the tail section wherever
the hell that is. Get the black box.

370
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Guess we'll start over here...

371
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
- with the cockpit first.
- Mr. Dantley.

372
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,320
- Yeah?
- I'm Stephen Royer.

373
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,440
F.A.A. Regional Director.

374
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,680
- Hello.
- Look I know... Hi.

375
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,160
I know you people at N.T.S.B.
don't like to speculate.

376
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,040
But it's been six hours
since this crash occurred.

377
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,600
- Nobody's talked to the press.
- We don't speculate.

378
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,880
Look, we got rumors on the Internet.
The Mayor has publicly condemned...

379
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,800
- the air traffic control system.
- We don't speculate.

380
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,720
I'm not asking you to do that.
But two planes...

381
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,920
flying into each other is
not supposed to happen.

382
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
Now, there are a lot of people
out there...

383
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
that are very nervous. I just need...

384
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,480
- some reassurance from your...
- I'll tell you what.

385
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,960
If you wanna reassure somebody...

386
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,040
why don't you go and talk to some of
the families of the victims? Okay?

387
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,920
- That's not what I'm here for.
- Let me work with him.

388
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,160
- We don't work for the airlines.
- I said...

389
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,400
- We don't work for the F.A.A.
- "with him." I'm not...

390
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
- Let's... Everyone's got...
- Look, he's...

391
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,720
an agenda right now. Let's just be
clear about what ours is. Alright?

392
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,200
Kennedy just arrived at International
Here's the passenger list for Global.

393
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,360
How many on board?

394
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,760
A hundred and eighty-two on Global.
Three on P.D.O.

395
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,080
When you're ready,
we can check out the cockpit.

396
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,280
John, you alright?

397
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,400
Is something wrong?

398
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,880
- Catherine was on this flight.
- Catherine? Catherine Parmel?

399
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,440
Are you sure?
I just spoke to her this morning.

400
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,320
I've no comment.

401
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,760
I'm meeting
my chief investigator now.

402
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,600
I'll be happy to answer
questions later.

403
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,880
We haven't interviewed
the controller at Midwest yet.

404
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,800
But we're looking into
the possibility that there may...

405
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
have been a mis-communication
between him and the pilot.

406
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,680
It's up to you, if you
want to release that to the press.

407
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,720
Right now our priority is
the recovery of...

408
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,520
- the bodies of the victims.
- Do we expect any survivors?

409
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,840
It'd be a miracle.

410
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,640
Kim will brief you daily.

411
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,680
Alright, it's very late. I think
we should all try and get some sleep.

412
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,960
Excuse me, sir.

413
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,240
I...

414
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,080
I need to disclose something to you.

415
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,160
I knew one of the victims of
this crash, a flight attendant.

416
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,120
John, I'm sorry.
Why didn't you say something?

417
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Was she a close friend?

418
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,720
Yeah. She was someone
I was seeing in D.C.

419
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,320
but we'd stopped seeing each other
well over a year and half ago.

420
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
I think you should recuse yourself.

421
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,160
- I agree.
- Kim can take care over.

422
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,520
- She's a senior investigator,
- I'd rather not. I'd like to...

423
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,840
- and you can go back to D.C.
- stay on. I can handle...

424
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,800
the investigation, sir.

425
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,840
I don't believe that
my having known this woman...

426
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,160
will in any way interfere with...

427
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,080
- my ability to do my job.
- You don't think ...

428
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,360
- it poses a conflict?
- No, sir, I do not.

429
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,560
- Come on, John.
- It's not a conflict for me.

430
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,280
And frankly, I don't think that
anyone else...

431
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,040
- even has to know about it.
- The last thing that...

432
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,080
we need is the appearance that
this investigation's been...

433
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,400
- compromised.
- Give me a little credit

434
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,800
- will you?
- The appearance, John.

435
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,920
Okay. Look, you can stay on.

436
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,440
But if it becomes a conflict,
professionally, emotionally.

437
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,880
I want you to recuse yourself.

438
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,160
- I will.
- Now, I'm gonna trust you on this.

439
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,040
It won't be a conflict, sir.
Thank you. I promise.

440
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,120
- Hello.
- Hi, Lori, it's John Dantley.

441
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,080
I don't know if you know this
or not, but...

442
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,360
but Catherine was on flight 1025.

443
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,760
I know.

444
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,800
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I was.

445
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,240
I can't...

446
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,280
I can't talk to you right now, John.

447
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,720
Yeah, Lori, do you know what
she was doing on a flight to D.C.?

448
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm sorry, I've to go.

449
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,320
Wait, Lori?

450
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
After being brought to...

451
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,680
- an undisclosed hotel last night...
- Yeah.

452
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,840
- air traffic controller...
- Okay, good.

453
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,200
- Henry Drake arrived home...
- Alright, take one...

454
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,320
- early this morning under...
- and go.

455
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,440
the watchful eye of...

456
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,560
- news cameras and reporters.
- The controller's name is...

457
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,360
Henry Drake.
Neighbors describe him...

458
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,080
as a quiet introspective man
who keeps to himself.

459
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,400
Even his next door neighbor
didn't know his name.

460
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,920
He's forty-six years old, unmarried,
mechanical engineering...

461
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,720
- graduate of Purdue University.
- Electrical engineering!

462
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,320
Right now he's inside his house.

463
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,760
Look, you people are getting it...

464
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,320
- all wrong.
- Mr. Drake, would you like...

465
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,440
- No. I've been told...
- to make a statement?

466
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,840
- that specifically I cannot talk...
- Was it controller error...

467
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,000
- to anybody.
- that caused this crash?

468
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,080
- No. I can't hear.
- Was there a mis-communication?

469
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,760
- You're all talking at once.
- Global had turbulence in the area.

470
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,840
But weather
doesn't seem to be a factor.

471
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,440
Our priority is radar
and voice communication...

472
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,280
between the pilots and
air traffic control.

473
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,680
Here's what I want.
Controller tapes from the facility...

474
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,360
cockpit voice recorder,
and the flight data reorder.

475
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,840
Also, find out if that cargo plane...

476
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,560
had a collision avoidance system
on board.

477
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,920
- Why wouldn't it?
- Not an F.A.A. requirement.

478
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,400
Kim, I want a look at
all the medical and...

479
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,120
training records on that controller.
Interview his friends, family

480
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
other controllers working
with him at the time. Anyone.

481
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,920
We'll meet here every morning
at 8.00am sharp for updates.

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
No one speaks to the press.
Understood?

483
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,240
Alright.

484
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,720
That's it.
Let's remember why we're all here.

485
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,760
We might actually learn something
from all this. Thank you.

486
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,800
I got that D.O.S.T.S.

487
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,160
John, about last night, I apologize.

488
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,200
But I had to call it
the way I saw it.

489
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,760
I understand.
Do we know where the controller is?

490
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,680
- Right behind you.
- I cannot talk about that.

491
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,200
I can't explain that to you.
I cannot talk to you.

492
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,160
First of all. I'm forty-eight,
right? I'm not forty-six.

493
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,000
And second of all, it's
an electrical engineering degree

494
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,320
- not a mechanical engineering degree
- I spoke to one of the F.A.A...

495
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,560
supes off the record about this guy.

496
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,480
Management's been trying to
fire him for the last five years.

497
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,760
- Why?
- Personality conflicts.

498
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,680
He files complaints
compulsively.

499
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,160
- About what?
- Equipment malfunctions...

500
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,520
union grievances. According to them,
he looks for problems.

501
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,560
This could be
a very short investigation.

502
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,040
There's the post-computer,
there's the C.D.C., and there's...

503
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,240
- the direct access radar.
- Can we come in and talk to you...

504
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,360
- inside your house?
- No, you can't come in...

505
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,800
- my house.
- Contact Frank Wyatt.

506
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,560
He's the facility manager at Midwest.

507
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
- I want him to work with us on this.
- No, I'm sorry.

508
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,880
Don't you think the facility manager
might have an agenda here, John?

509
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,160
No, not him.

510
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,720
- He's an old friend.
- Frank, good to see you.

511
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,960
It's been a long time, John.
I'm honored that you brought me in...

512
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,440
- on the investigation.
- No one else knows...

513
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,920
- the facility better than you do.
- Well...

514
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,880
this has sure turned us upside down.

515
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,640
Twenty-two years
and not one black mark.

516
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Just be a minute, Henry.

517
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,720
How many planes were you
in communication with...

518
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,480
at the time of the accident?

519
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,760
- Ten.
- And how long...

520
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,360
had you been on your scope?

521
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,480
About two hours and
thirty-five minutes.

522
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,320
I wish I could hear what the hell
he was sayin' in there.

523
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,480
He's sayin' I worked him
overtime yesterday.

524
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,760
Him and ten other guys.

525
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
Drake is not ten other guys.

526
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,240
- He's gonna blame me.
- And I handed him off...

527
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,680
too many planes.
He could say anything he wants to.

528
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,960
The truth is, he screwed up, right?

529
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,320
- Yes, he did.
- Guys, we don't know that.

530
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Karen, I saw that cargo jet
on my screen...

531
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,840
and I saw it on his screen, okay?
You saw it, right?

532
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,240
I don't know, man.

533
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,520
Don't say you don't know.
We gotta get the story straight.

534
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,080
- I'm just a trainee.
- No. You're there.

535
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,480
- I think I should go to the shrink.
- Shrink?

536
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,840
This has got nothin' to do
with a shrink.

537
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,440
This is about what you saw.

538
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,840
Now, what I saw were two planes
on a collision course...

539
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,760
that Drake did not separate in time.

540
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,680
When did you
first encounter the P.D.O.'s?

541
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,320
P.D.O. was westbound
at 21,000 feet...

542
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,480
and requested permission
to climb to 28,000.

543
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,520
Didn't you see tine P.D.O.
climbing into Global at 26,000 feet?

544
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,320
When I climbed P.D.O.,
Global was not a factor.

545
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,320
I had sufficient separation.

546
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,520
Obviously, I didn't see P.D.O.
climb into Global.

547
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,160
- Why not?
- P.D.O. data block...

548
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,600
disappeared from my screen.

549
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,040
- Why did you take...
- Excuse me.

550
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,040
What do you mean it disappeared?

551
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,320
Before the collision, I had a glitch.

552
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,040
A blackout on my screen.

553
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,320
After the blackout,
the data block vanished.

554
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,720
So you're telling us you never
even saw the P.D.O. at 26,000 feet.

555
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,280
The data block came back on
my screen just before the collision.

556
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,560
How long was your screen blacked out?

557
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,120
Two, maybe three seconds.

558
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,760
And did the outage occur
in the entire facility?

559
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,480
I've no way of knowing that.

560
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,520
According to the preliminary report,
there was no blackout reported.

561
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,080
Did the supervisor see it?

562
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,120
- I haven't spoken to the supervisor.
- Did you alert your supervisor?

563
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,560
I requested an unsatisfactory...

564
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,440
- condition report.
- But to your knowledge...

565
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,280
he didn't see it happen?

566
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
Did anyone see it?

567
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,800
I'm telling you,
I had a blackout on my screen!

568
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,240
I tried to establish radio contact
with the P.D.O.

569
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,800
but I didn't see it!
You didn't see it...

570
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,440
- or it wasn't there?
- It wasn't there.

571
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,000
Alright, let's go back
to the instructions...

572
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,720
- that you gave 1025. If I may?
- Please.

573
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,200
T-CAS, the pilot's on-board
warning device...

574
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,200
indicated conflicting traffic to 1025
and instructed the pilot to descend.

575
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,720
But you denied his request and
told him to maintain altitude.

576
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,160
- It's correct?
- I had other traffic.

577
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,760
I didn't know where
the P.D.O. jet was.

578
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,200
Why would you climb P.D.O from
21 to 28 when you had a 757 at 26?

579
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,480
I've warned this facility about
the sub-standard equipment we have.

580
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,280
I've warned this facility
about deficiencies in the system.

581
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,480
Radar blackouts,
communication outages.

582
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,280
I've telephoned
the F.A.A. Administrator's hotline.

583
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
I filed two unsatisfactory
condition reports...

584
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,240
in the last two months
on the very same scope...

585
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,160
- I was using!
- Answer his question, Henry.

586
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,360
Why'd ya climb P.D.O.
from 21,000 feet to 28,000 feet...

587
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,280
when you had a 757 at 26?

588
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,360
I told you the Global's not a factor.
I could see both of those planes.

589
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,680
So you became confused when P.D.O.
as you allege, disappeared.

590
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
No. Yes! Fie, yeah, I was confused!

591
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,320
No, see what do you mean "allege?"
you're putting words in my mouth now.

592
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
I don't allege anything.
The system...

593
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,240
- is unsafe. It's in jeopardy!
- According to the data we've...

594
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Henry, according to the data we've...

595
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
you say one thing,
the radar printout says another.

596
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,200
You're confused and you contradieted
the computer's instructions.

597
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,840
Let's talk about that for a minute.

598
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,880
It's accepted practice that if
it's your word against the computer

599
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
the computer has precedence.

600
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,520
That's ludicrous! How can you
give the computer precedence...

601
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,680
when you can't even believe
what it's saying?

602
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,920
Ask the pilots.

603
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,200
Even the T-CAS system
makes mistakes sometimes.

604
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,160
I warned you. Mr. Wyatt.
I warned you!

605
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,040
We've to trust the technology.

606
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,880
You gave the pilot improper
instructions.

607
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,520
- Is that true or not true?
- You're warned that...

608
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,160
- this was gonna happen.
- Is it true or not true?

609
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,560
- You're warned!
- Did you give the pilot...

610
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,480
improper instructions?

611
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,640
This is the scope that Drake used.

612
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,560
He's finishing up
a diagnostic check on it right now.

613
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,840
Test panel looks okay.
Character generator functions.

614
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,640
Character gen...
How old is this scope?

615
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,600
- Older than you.
- We're in transition.

616
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,720
We're due for new equipment
in two years.

617
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,720
- So they say.
- I've hooked into a sector...

618
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,120
for the last five hours. This is
the same traffic Drake had yesterday.

619
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,160
It seems to be functioning fine.

620
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,680
How long do you want me
to stay on it?

621
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,120
Five hours isn't long enough.

622
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,360
Hook up a video monitor to it
and record it.

623
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,000
Drake says he reported two
unsatisfactory condition reports...

624
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,520
on this scope. I wanna see 'em.
All the maintenance records, too.

625
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,160
Did anybody
touch this scope last night?

626
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,720
I run the department.
Nobody touched it.

627
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,480
Let me know what happens.

628
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,400
- What's Henry Drake's status here?
- I'm sure...

629
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
he'd like to have his job back,
but he's not gonna get it though.

630
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,440
I gotta find something else
for him to do.

631
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,280
- Union rules.
- That glitch he talked about...

632
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,440
the data disappearing from the screen
that ever happen to you before?

633
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Not to my knowledge. I'll go through
the reports and check.

634
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
- Did you see the radar data?
- Yeah, but that doesn't...

635
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,040
prove him wrong. Missing data's
not gonna show up on a radar report.

636
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,000
We need the black box to show if
there's a problem with the avionics.

637
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,880
- How long has Drake worked here?
- Twenty years.

638
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,800
Most of my controllers
burn out after ten...

639
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,600
and move upstairs into management,
but Henry, well, ya know.

640
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,040
Henry Drake's not exactly
what ya call management material.

641
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,880
This equipment is what,
1960s' military?

642
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,680
1950s.

643
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,320
My dad says you guys had more
sophisticated equipment back...

644
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,480
when you're in the Navy.

645
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,360
There's nothing wrong
with the technology, John.

646
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,800
We may have a few more airplanes
in the sky...

647
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,640
but that's not the system's fault.
It works.

648
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,080
Yeah, Barbara, is he there?

649
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Yeah, sure. I'll hold.

650
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,280
Hey, what'd you find out?

651
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,920
Drake's scope checked out.

652
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
Really?

653
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,560
- What about those reports he filed?
- They weren't there.

654
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,040
- What do mean they weren't there?
- They weren't there.

655
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,480
The F.A.A. has no record of any
unsatisfactory reports being filed...

656
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,920
or any service on the scope
in the last two months.

657
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,040
That's weird.

658
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,800
- Did we check the D.C. office?
- It's not there.

659
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,520
But I did find out
something interesting.

660
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,720
What?

661
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,360
There're five power outages
in the facility.

662
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,840
Blackouts? Caused by?

663
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,080
Software glitch, power interruption,
stuck computer key...

664
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,280
that one knocked him out
for fifteen minutes.

665
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,520
What's falling out of
that helicopter?

666
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,880
Flowers.

667
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,920
From the families of the victims.

668
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,080
That's as close as they could get.

669
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,440
I saw Catherine a couple months ago.

670
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,920
- I thought you guys broke up.
- Yeah, we did.

671
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,480
But I was in Atlanta,
so I called her.

672
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,720
We got together a couple times.
It's great.

673
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,040
I don't know why, maybe 'cause
there was no pressure on us...

674
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,920
or something,
but it was really, really nice.

675
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,600
I called her a couple of times
when I got back to D.C., but...

676
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,080
she never called me back.

677
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,080
Mr. Dantley.

678
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,280
Park that loader right here.

679
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,800
- How many are there right now?
- All done.

680
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,360
- Bring it down.
- Let's go.

681
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,560
- How's that?
- That's good.

682
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,600
- Mr. Dantley.
- I'm not supposed to talk to you.

683
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,040
- I just want to talk.
- You want this incident reported?

684
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,840
It's not gonna help you out.

685
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,760
Why won't anybody listen to me?

686
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
I'm not crazy, I know what I saw.

687
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,440
That plane was not on my scope.

688
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,240
Did you find the unsatisfactory
condition reports...

689
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,800
- I filed?
- They weren't there.

690
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,680
- How? I filed those reports.
- They weren't there.

691
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,680
- They buried them.
- Who?

692
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,040
They'll bury reports.
They'll do whatever...

693
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,200
- they want!
- Tell me something. How come...

694
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,320
out of thirty-five unsatisfactory
condition reports...

695
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,360
filed in the last couple years,
you filed thirty-two of 'em?

696
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,680
Because I speak up.

697
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,360
Just because you speak up
doesn't mean anyone's gonna...

698
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,280
- believe you
- Listen.

699
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,240
Could I look you in the eye like this
if I killed all those people?

700
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,120
Good night. Mr. Drake.

701
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,400
A little higher.

702
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,560
- John!
- Yeah.

703
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,120
- We found the black box.
- They got it.

704
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,880
- Traffic.
- Now you can see the P.D.O...

705
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,040
- Traffic.
- approaching in the computer...

706
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
- recreation.
- Traffic.

707
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,480
What the hell are they waiting for?

708
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,920
Traffic, descend now. Traffic...

709
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
The crew is getting impatient.

710
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,240
The controller's telling
the Global pilot to maintain...

711
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,800
T-CAS is telling him to descend.

712
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,200
The Global pilot's
receiving conflicting commands.

713
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,760
- Center, we've traffic somewhere.
- Traffic, descend now.

714
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,320
- T-CAS is telling us to descend.
- Traffic, descend now. Traffic.

715
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,080
- Negative, 1025, do not descend.
- Traffic.

716
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,480
- Maintain flight level 260.
- Traffic, decend...

717
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,800
Again the controller gives him
the wrong command.

718
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,520
P.D.O. cargo is now at twenty-five...

719
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,640
and climbing directly into
the path of the Global.

720
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,280
- Center, we're not on visual.
- Traffic, decend now.

721
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,800
- Where's the traffic?
- I don't see him.

722
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,640
- Where's the P.D.0.?
- Traffic, decend.

723
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,320
The controller was keyed up
on his mike.

724
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,360
He seems irritated, confused,
he cant find P.D.O...

725
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,560
Or it's not on his screen.

726
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,400
Or it's not on his screen.
What we do know from the data...

727
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,280
is that the P.D.O. cargo
is almost at 26,000 feet.

728
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,720
Now, somehow the controller
realizes his mistake...

729
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,960
and quickly tries to descend Global.

730
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Global 1025, traffic alert.
Descend immediately to...

731
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,200
- flight level 210.
- 1025 expediting a descend.

732
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,280
He was giving the right commands
to Global.

733
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,080
- But it's too late.
- Traffic...

734
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,880
- descend now.
- We've impact.

735
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,080
- What the hell was that?
- That's not right.

736
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,200
What we got here...

737
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,160
- Traffic. Descend...
- We're hit, man! We're hit!

738
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,000
The next segment of this tape...

739
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,360
is the cockpit recording
after the collision.

740
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,880
This isn't easy to listen to.

741
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,160
Play it.

742
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,160
Center, mayday, mayday!
We're going down!

743
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,480
- We're going down!
- Something hit us back there!

744
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,960
- This is Global 1025.
- Traffic, decend now.

745
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,600
- We're going down!
- Talk to the cabin!

746
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,000
Flight attendants,
assume crash positions.

747
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,480
- Traffic, desend now.
- I can't hold it.

748
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000
Left rudder.

749
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,040
- We're losing hydraulics!
- On fire, engine two!

750
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,280
- Blow the bottles!
- Hang on!

751
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,960
- I...
- Pull it up.

752
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,160
- Emergency request! Can't...
- Traffic.

753
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,080
God, I can't!

754
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Look at that form.

755
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,440
Come on!

756
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,560
- Score it.
- I tried, man. It was...

757
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,560
- Where are you goin'?
- Goin' home to my kids.

758
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
- Come on, one more.
- Come on.

759
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,280
- Tim wants you to stay.
- No. I don't.

760
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,800
See ya.

761
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,680
Henry.

762
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,520
I was gonna call you.

763
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,880
Yeah, but you've been so busy.

764
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,000
Don't do that to me.

765
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,360
Sorry. But under the circumstances...

766
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,800
I think that maybe an ounce of pity
might be appropriate.

767
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,160
Come on, Karen,
I'm drownin' out here.

768
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,280
That's ridiculous.
There's no conspiracy.

769
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,440
Everybody is just tryin' to cover
their own ass.

770
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,400
Karen, what do you think
a conspiracy is?

771
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,520
God! I file the complaints.

772
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,120
I fight for the union,
I put my ass on the line...

773
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,600
for everybody else
and who comes to my defense?

774
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,640
Everybody is suffering.

775
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,120
What did you guys say to the NTSB?

776
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,840
Who?

777
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,080
Lafia, Mack, Conners, you.

778
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,640
I know you guys all talked.
What did you say?

779
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,880
This is great. You don't remember.

780
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,480
Don't get sarcastic with me, Henry.

781
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,000
You know we're not supposed to
talk about...

782
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
- what we said.
- Karen, it's me for God's sake!

783
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,280
I went through your divorce.

784
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,440
- I know your children.
- Henry, what do you...

785
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,240
want me to do, lie?

786
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,720
Whatever happened on your scope,
I didn't see it!

787
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,880
But ya know that what
I'm talking about could've happened.

788
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,760
Karen. Listen. I know
it's hard for you to complain.

789
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,520
But you've gotta speak up now!
Those guys, they're not gonna do it.

790
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,920
But you're not them.

791
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,560
You've gotta speak up
and tell people about the system.

792
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,800
Henry...

793
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,960
I'm not you.

794
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,080
We can't keep the black box findings
from the press.

795
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,680
We've to release that information.

796
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,160
- I agree.
- I don't have a problem with that.

797
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,120
I'll schedule a press conference
in two days.

798
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,320
Excuse me, but if you release
this tape to the press...

799
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,640
then the whole world's gonna think
that Henry Drake was responsible...

800
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,680
for the crash of 1025.

801
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,920
Let's not kid ourselves here.
These investigations are now...

802
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,280
public trials played out
in the media.

803
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,800
We release these findings...

804
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,160
- he's guilty.
- John, we've listened to...

805
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,400
all the tapes, we've analyzed
all the data that we have...

806
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,120
we've interviewed and
re-interviewed anyone...

807
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,040
who was even remotely
attached to the crash.

808
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,240
Now, yes the pilot will share
some responsibility

809
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,360
but the cold hard fact is
Henry Drake...

810
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,200
- did not see the cargo plane.
- True.

811
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,080
But he says that it wasn't there
on his scope.

812
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,760
How does that prove he's innocent?

813
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,480
- How does that prove he's guilty?
- You're lookin' to find...

814
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,680
- some fault with the system.
- No.

815
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
- I'm not lookin' to find anything.
- Look. If there is...

816
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,240
even the slightest hint
of a remote possibility...

817
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,840
that there's something wrong with
the air traffic control system...

818
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
there'll be
international repercussions.

819
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,920
Yes, but what if there is
something wrong with the system?

820
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,400
What if it is flawed?
And if that flaw still exists...

821
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,440
what are we gonna do about it?
Ignore it?

822
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,440
- Wait for it to happen again?
- Of course not.

823
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,160
Then tell me how a guy
with a fairly spotless record...

824
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,440
over twenty years of experience
as a controller...

825
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,760
- puts two planes together.
- His spotless record...

826
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,560
and his experience
are completely irrelevant.

827
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,920
Alright.

828
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,440
What about the unsatisfactory
condition reports he filed?

829
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,120
John, we've been over this before.
They aren't there.

830
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,920
- I looked for 'em myself.
- So he's lying.

831
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,000
We're not making a value judgement
against this guy's character.

832
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,120
Sure we are.
That's exactly what we're doing.

833
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,560
If those reports don't exist,
then Drake is a liar.

834
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,560
Have we double checked
the maintenance logs?

835
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,400
Double checked and triple checked.
There've been no problems reported...

836
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,880
with that scope
for the last several months.

837
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,080
Does anybody else
have a bad feeling about this?

838
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,120
John, I wanna get to the truth of
this matter as much as you do...

839
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
- as much as anybody.
- How many blackouts...

840
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,480
did your facility have last year?

841
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,320
We've had occasional power failures.
We installed...

842
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
- new software, new equipment.
- Yeah. But how many blackouts?

843
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,440
- Five. We've a backup system.
- And what happens...

844
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,400
- if that backup system goes down?
- It doesn't.

845
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,560
- If. If it did.
- John, this has absolutely...

846
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,320
nothing to do with what happened to
Henry Drake's scope.

847
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,720
Five blackouts.

848
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Now, is that how many really
happened or is that just...

849
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,560
- how many gets reported?
- If a power interruption duration...

850
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,120
is less than one minute,
no report is filed.

851
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,280
- Why not?
- Because it's not required by...

852
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,040
federal air regulations, John.

853
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,280
- I do not make the rules.
- Why does it take something...

854
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,520
like this to happen
before the rules get changed?

855
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
People... people die.

856
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,600
John.

857
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,760
You got a call. You need to go to
the crash site right away.

858
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Believe it or not, we're almost
two miles from the crash site.

859
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,440
A couple a hikers found the bodies
early this morning.

860
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,880
We found the last six remaining
bodies in this general area here.

861
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,520
Where was
Catherine Parmel's body found?

862
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,280
I believe she was over here
in this clearing.

863
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,840
Who...

864
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,840
Who was this she was with?

865
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,320
144, that would be, Paulette Oster.

866
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
She was a little five year old girl.

867
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,920
Her mother's body was already
recovered, wasn't it?

868
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,440
Yes, sir. Ya know, strangest thing

869
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,320
her mother'sbody wasn't found
anywhere in this area.

870
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,960
We're pretty sure that
she was holding on...

871
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,320
to the little girl
when the plane crashed.

872
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,880
Excuse me, sir, if you don't mind
me asking, did you...

873
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,080
Did you know this woman somehow?

874
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,800
Yeah.

875
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,320
Listen, why don't you
just take your time here and...

876
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,360
if you need me.
I'll be back at the truck.

877
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,360
You okay?

878
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,160
Yeah

879
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,120
You know, you do this for ten years,
you just...

880
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,440
walk by these little flags...

881
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,760
they're just bodies, not a life.

882
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,480
It's...

883
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,760
It's a little different
when you know the person.

884
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,920
You guys want kids, Paul?

885
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,440
Yeah, we've talked about it.

886
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
Catherine wanted kids.

887
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,280
She wasn't sure when,
but she knew she wanted them.

888
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,440
I need to go home,
take a couple days off.

889
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,760
I promised Catherine's mom
I'd bring her body back home to D.C.

890
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,840
This isn't right.

891
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,040
This just isn't right.

892
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,920
John?

893
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,520
- Lori.
- Can we talk?

894
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,240
It's about the best I can do.

895
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,480
I haven't been home
since I left for Chicago.

896
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,880
Thanks.

897
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,200
I spoke to Catherine's mom yesterday.

898
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,440
I know. It really meant a lot to her
that you could...

899
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,920
bring Catherine's body back.

900
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,400
Yeah

901
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,920
You know I'm still a little confused.

902
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
About what?

903
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,760
About why she was on that flight.

904
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
I know that D.C. wasn't on her route
since she moved to Atlanta.

905
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,720
I thought that maybe
she was cornin' home...

906
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,200
to visit her mom, but that wasn't it.

907
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,680
No, she was coming here to see you.

908
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,440
- Me?
- There's something...

909
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,960
I've to tell you. It was my fault.

910
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,600
I was with Catherine in L.A.

911
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,680
I switched flights with her and
she took my route. I killed her.

912
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,040
It should've been me.

913
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,680
No.

914
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,760
No. Don't say that. It shouldn't...

915
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,760
- It shouldn't have been anyone.
- I've to go.

916
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,280
Wait. Why did she want to see me?

917
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,440
It doesn't matter anymore.

918
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
John, Mark. I've in my possession
two tickets to the Redskins game.

919
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,320
If you're interested, call me, okay?

920
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,200
Hi, John, it's your mom.

921
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,880
- Hi, Mom.
- I know you're busy.

922
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,320
Call me back when you've a chance.

923
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Dad and I're trying to make plans
for Thanksgiving.

924
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,240
- Yeah.
- I love you. Bye.

925
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,400
Hi, it's Catherine.
I'm calling from L.A.X. and I...

926
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,640
I've to see you. I've something
I've to talk to you about...

927
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,120
and I just... I wanna talk to you
about it in person.

928
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,600
I'm coming into D.C. tonight. I know
you're in town, I called your office.

929
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I hope that was okay.

930
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,640
I need to see you, John.

931
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,360
Would you please be there for me?

932
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,960
Tell me why she was coming to...

933
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,280
- see me.
- I don't know.

934
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,960
Yes you do. Come on,
why'd she wanna see me?

935
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,080
- It doqesn't matter.
- Why'd she wanna see me?

936
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,120
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

937
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,640
Lori, come on. Please just...

938
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,600
- Tell me.
- She was pregnant.

939
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
She loved you, John.

940
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,480
She always loved you.

941
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,280
Didn't you know that?

942
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,960
John?

943
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,040
John?

944
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,000
Hi, it's Catherine.
I'm calling from L.A.X. and I...

945
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,280
I've to see you. I've something
I've to talk to you about...

946
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,840
I just... I wanna talk to you
about it in person.

947
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,720
I'm coming into D.C. tonight.

948
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,360
I know you're in town,
I called your office.

949
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,200
I hope that was okay.

950
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,480
I need to see you, John.

951
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,200
Would you please be there for me?

952
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I used to work in maintenance.

953
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,240
And, well technically.
I'm not a controller just yet.

954
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,040
- I'm still a trainee.
- When do you start?

955
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,040
In about an hour.

956
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,120
A little nervous?

957
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,080
I should actually get back out there.

958
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,760
Did you ever
service Henry Drake's scope?

959
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,720
Any scope that came down to us
was just a number. We checked it...

960
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,360
repaired it
if it needed repair and...

961
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,960
logged it in the book.

962
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,320
- This book, right?
- Yes, sir.

963
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,920
When you service a scope,
it's logged into this, right?

964
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,080
Yes, sir.

965
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,520
Tell me, did anyone ever ask you...

966
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,400
not to log something or
to take something out?

967
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,840
- No, sir.
- Is it possible that a data block...

968
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,520
can disappear from a radar screen?

969
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,800
- It could.
- How?

970
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,960
The scope could overheat, maybe.

971
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,280
That could cause the character
generator to malfunction...

972
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,920
that could cause
the display to malfunction.

973
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,960
Could I go now?

974
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,480
How would we
cause a scope to overheat?

975
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,560
Just turn off the fan.

976
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,800
Can I go now? Please?

977
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,160
Yeah.

978
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,320
How ya doin', buddy?

979
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,120
Good. I'm good.

980
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,120
First day pushin' tin. Ya nervous?

981
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,440
No. I just dropped my pen.

982
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,320
Let me tell you a secret
and don't tell anybody here.

983
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,360
My first week on the scopes
puked my guts out for the whole week.

984
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,320
Man, are you kiddin' me?

985
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,760
This is a true story.
Lighten up, rookie.

986
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,480
Got an easy shift.
Light traffic. No pressure.

987
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,480
What'd he ask you about?

988
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,720
- Who?
- Who?

989
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,880
The N.T.S.B.

990
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,760
- You're just upstairs.
- Nothin', man.

991
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,160
It was just maintenance stuff.

992
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,160
Rock steady. You'll do fine.

993
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,920
You nervous about the job or...

994
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,160
- did somethin' happen up there?
- I...

995
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,720
- I'm not nervous.
- Confidence, man.

996
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,320
That's what this job is all about.
You get into a rhythm...

997
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,280
- and you're in control.
- You're in control.

998
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,960
No, you're in control.

999
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,720
- I'm in control.
- That's right. See ya on the floor.

1000
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,600
I'm in control.

1001
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,480
I'm in control.

1002
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,160
Make six copies of
these arrival route maps...

1003
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,080
and then distribute them
to the appropriate control stations.

1004
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,560
And then come back.

1005
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,200
Don't you use the same maps
every week?

1006
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,440
- Yes.
- Why not make six hundred copies?

1007
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,000
And then you don't have to
make copies every week, right?

1008
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,960
Because I don't do it that way.

1009
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,880
Consider yourself
lucky to even have this job.

1010
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:54,280
United 723. Midwest Center.
Resume normal speed.

1011
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,240
Descend and maintain
flight level 280.

1012
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,360
Rookie. The pilots aren't dogs.
Loosen up.

1013
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,720
Southwest 116, turn left heading 280.

1014
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,760
Vector for traffic,
expect direct Mason City...

1015
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,120
traffic at your two o'clock,
fifteen miles.

1016
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,440
Beautiful! Look at that separation.

1017
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,160
Okay, let's hear it for the rookie!

1018
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,880
Get your own coffee from now on.

1019
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,960
Tristate 723
maintain maximum forward...

1020
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,760
Southwest 116,
contact Midwest Center...

1021
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,000
I'll be back in a minute.
Get that scope running.

1022
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,320
Southwest 116,
contact Midwest Center 123.4.

1023
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,120
Watch your sequencing
and separation, man...

1024
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:53,120
- or you'll get yourself cornered.
- Where?

1025
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,720
Right there, left of Tristate.

1026
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,400
You got two planes coming into
each other in about three minutes.

1027
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,120
- Tristate.
- Don't panic.

1028
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,960
Just talk to him and
put him somewhere.

1029
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,160
Tristate 723,
this is Midwest Center.

1030
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,480
Turn left heading 210,
reduce speed to 250 knot.

1031
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,040
There you go.

1032
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,880
Continental 301, traffic ten o'clock,
one mile northbound.

1033
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,720
- How you doin'?
- Pretty good.

1034
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,960
Pan Atlantic 234...

1035
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,440
traffic eleven o'clock,
two zero miles east...

1036
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,840
What the hell is this?

1037
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,520
I'm goin' down.

1038
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,840
What do you got?

1039
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,480
Come on.

1040
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,560
We got a blackout!

1041
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,360
- Let's go
- Got nothing!

1042
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,520
Switch to backup!

1043
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,000
- Switching.
- Come on. Back up is down.

1044
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,600
Start the backup radios.

1045
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
Radio is down.

1046
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,760
What the hell is goin' on?

1047
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,720
We've got a blackout.

1048
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,760
Find a phone.

1049
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,360
That's right. Saint Louis

1050
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,080
- can't you see him?
- No.

1051
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,840
No, not here. Yes!

1052
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,480
- Radio change.
- What do I do?

1053
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:06,600
Keep the picture in your head.
Call in the positions...

1054
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,360
- to International.
- Keep it in my head?

1055
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,400
- I got ten planes!
- Just get another phone.

1056
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,640
I got two of 'em about to crash...

1057
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,720
- in two minutes!
- And I've got four.

1058
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,640
I'm sorry, man, I can't help you
right now. Just get to a phone...

1059
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,600
any phone. Have Chicago tower
take over your airspace.

1060
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,920
- Williams' got the number.
- Code five.

1061
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,080
Tell 'em we've got no contact. What?

1062
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,040
What's the number
for the Chicago air tower?

1063
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,440
- 5552320. Are you still there?
- You gotta find him...

1064
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,600
- because he's in heavy traffic.
- Who's that?

1065
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,240
- backup.
- facilities...

1066
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,680
radar on...

1067
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,960
Do you see it?

1068
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,600
Heavy traffic.

1069
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,600
- He's at 22,000. At about...
- I need a phone.

1070
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,760
- a hundred and twenty miles east.
- Where is there another phone?

1071
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,640
Try downstairs. Last altitude known,
flight level 223.

1072
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,520
- twenty-six fourteen miles
- Please! I need the phone!

1073
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,560
- and that's to...
- I got two and a half minutes!

1074
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,400
- to 2803.
- Sorry.

1075
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,720
Excuse me! I need a phone!

1076
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,240
- Emergency, I need a phone!
- Join the club.

1077
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,720
I got a disaster in two minutes!

1078
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,960
Upstairs, outside.

1079
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,520
Zero, should be pickin'
'em up right now.

1080
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,440
Where's he goin'?

1081
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,880
I need the phone.

1082
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,320
- I'm sorry, I got planes in the air.
- Hey, what the hell?

1083
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,320
American 22 heavy,
cancel take off clearance.

1084
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,880
All flights out of Chicago cancelled.

1085
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,320
Pick up the traffic from Center.
Ground stop everything.

1086
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,200
- International.
- This is Tim Conners. Midwest Center

1087
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,760
I got a Tristate 723 squawk 7127
climbing Eastbound...

1088
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,760
Westbound three miles
east of the airport.

1089
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,280
I got a Pan Atlantic 234
squawk 1017...

1090
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,120
eastbound climbing fifteen
for twenty-five in its path.

1091
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,920
It's been a good minute and a half.
I just hope...

1092
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,440
- they can see each other.
- I'm tryin' to find 'em.

1093
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,440
- What frequency are they on?
- 118.55

1094
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,800
11855. Pan Atlantic 234...

1095
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,680
this is Chicago International,
do you read?

1096
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,960
Pan Atlantic 234...

1097
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,880
Not on that frequency.
They're talkin' to somebody...

1098
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,120
- I just don't know who.
- Can't you just see it?

1099
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,280
I don't see it.

1100
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,120
It's gotta be there.

1101
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,560
I see a vector on the west.
Let me talk to somebody else.

1102
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,520
American, you've traffic
on your right...

1103
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,440
could be Tristate 723. You've visual?

1104
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,000
Well, they're flyin' straight
into traffic. Do you have...

1105
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,440
a frequency for 'em? Got it.

1106
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,120
Tristate 723,
this is Chicago International...

1107
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,000
taking over your airspace.
You've traffic at your altitude.

1108
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,720
A jet eastbound at twenty thousand.
Descend immediately.

1109
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,760
Descend immediately. Descend!

1110
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,960
Please.

1111
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,800
Pan Atlantic don't descend with 'em.
Come on.

1112
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,360
Come on. Yes! We got 'em.

1113
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,680
We got 'em separated.
You're okay. Midwest Center.

1114
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,360
Thank you.

1115
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,000
- Thank you, God.
- We all done now?

1116
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,960
Yes.

1117
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,320
Attention all aircraft,
ground stop still in effect...

1118
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,240
delays to metered airports
are expected.

1119
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,960
We're back! We are back on line!

1120
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,240
- Get right on it.
- Hey, Buzz

1121
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,160
Alright!

1122
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,120
Alright,
let's get back up to speed.

1123
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,720
Come on.

1124
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,000
Thank you very much.

1125
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,160
And you can keep it.

1126
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,200
I was robbed. It should have fallen.

1127
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,160
- Should have fallen.
- Hey, Lafia, since when you buyin'?

1128
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,400
I'm not, these are for me,
get your own.

1129
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,800
- Come on.
- Too good to be true.

1130
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,120
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

1131
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,360
- Hey, to us.
- This is to us.

1132
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,880
I gotta take this.

1133
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,160
Hey, if it's Tristate...

1134
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,680
- tell 'em to keep circlin'.
- Tell 'em to keep circlin'.

1135
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,640
Rookie, you okay?

1136
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,560
Yeah. I'm alright.

1137
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,400
There're tense moments
at the Midwest Center...

1138
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,640
- Air Traffic Control...
- We're on the news!

1139
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,920
earlier this morning when
a power outage caused a blackout.

1140
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,200
All radar and communications
were down for almost five minutes.

1141
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,960
No accidents or near midair
collisions were reported.

1142
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,920
Frank Wyatt, facility manager
of Midwest Center responded.

1143
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,560
It was tense,
there's no question about that...

1144
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,720
- but this is the point that...
- There he is.

1145
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,320
- I wish to emphasize is that...
- Hey, Frankie. Come on...

1146
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,480
- even though we experienced...
- come on, tell 'em Frankie...

1147
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,600
- a major power outage at a...
- tell it like it is!

1148
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,000
very important air traffic
control facility, the system worked.

1149
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,360
The system worked because we've
well-designed contingency plans...

1150
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,360
and we've well-trained,
highly skilled professional...

1151
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,840
- air traffic controllers.
- And that would be us.

1152
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,600
- The system failures rarely occur.
- Yeah, Dan.

1153
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,880
- Gentlemen!
- Yes?

1154
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,240
And if they do, they present
no problem to the flying public.

1155
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,480
- We continue to do our job,
- Does Kennedy know about...

1156
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,880
- to minimize delays
- the blackout at the facility today?

1157
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,320
- to ensure the smooth flow of...
- Well...

1158
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,520
- air traffic control...
- yes, it is urgent, actually.

1159
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
- and of course the safety...
- I need to speak to him before...

1160
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,280
- Today's particular...
- his press conference.

1161
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,040
- system failure did cause...
- Can you make that happen?

1162
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,520
- delays at Chicago International...
- Thank you.

1163
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,040
however, and this is a point
I want to emphasize...

1164
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,960
at no time was public
safety compromised.

1165
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,160
This was
essentially a non-event.

1166
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,520
What the hell is he talkin' about?
It was chaos!

1167
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,240
They had planes flying
with no communication...

1168
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,560
or radar for four minutes!

1169
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,040
- Do they know what caused it?
- No.

1170
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,520
But I'm gonna find out.
Kim, bring Henry Drake back in.

1171
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,040
They're gonna nail him for 1025...

1172
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,800
in two hours and I wanna
talk to him again first.

1173
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,360
Paul, get me a printout of
every blackout reported at Midwest.

1174
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,680
In fact, every center and Tracon...

1175
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,880
- in the country.
- Call Wyatt.

1176
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,720
- No.
- He's the facility manager.

1177
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,280
I know who he is, Kim.
Go outside the agency.

1178
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,760
Get it from NASA. The aviation
reporting systems control base.

1179
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,800
I wanna know about any and
all blackouts from now on.

1180
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,520
What the hell happened out there?

1181
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,440
It could be a commercial
power failure.

1182
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,600
Could be a switching mechanism.
I may need to swap a circuit breaker.

1183
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,360
- I don't know yet.
- I cannot manage a system...

1184
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,120
that I've to piecemeal together
with paper clips and chewing gum.

1185
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,560
We'll fix the problem.

1186
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,400
And then what?

1187
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,840
- Sir?
- We're busy.

1188
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,560
I think you should look at this
right away.

1189
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,720
According to F.A.A. facility manager
Wyatt, there was no correlation...

1190
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,280
between today's blackout and
the Global 1025 midair collision...

1191
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,840
three weeks ago which claimed...

1192
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,960
- one hundred eighty-five lives.
- Of course not.

1193
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,360
F.A.A, officials did not disclose
the cause of today's blackout.

1194
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,440
National Transportation
Board director, Dr William Kennedy...

1195
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,280
has scheduled a press conference
to address recent findings...

1196
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,680
in the crash of Global 1025.

1197
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,720
Though officials insist that
the cause of the crash...

1198
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,160
is still under investigation,
there are unconfirmed reports...

1199
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,040
that the N.T.S.B.
will find that controller error...

1200
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,520
was ultimately responsible for
the midair disaster.

1201
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,760
Come on, what do I've to do?
They're there, the N.T.S.B.

1202
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,360
They saw the blackout!

1203
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,560
- The release of the transcript...
- Henry...

1204
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,040
- from the flight's data recorder...
- you're scaring the kids.

1205
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,800
confirmed what investigators
have suspected since the crash.

1206
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,880
Federal officials today indicated
that data from the flight recorder...

1207
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,400
clearly established that...

1208
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,920
Henry Drake the Midwest Center...

1209
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,360
- air traffic controller...
- I didn't cause the crash of 1025.

1210
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,440
- failed to communicate...
- I didn't cause... No

1211
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,600
- the correct flight position...
- I can't explain it.

1212
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,680
- and altitude during the final...
- Hello?

1213
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,440
Karen, this is Harold.

1214
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,280
- Where's Henry?
- Why?

1215
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,280
If you hear from him at all,
let me know.

1216
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,720
We got a problem. A big problem.

1217
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,040
What?

1218
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,920
Always. Question authority.

1219
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,360
You see this,
they lie and they lie...

1220
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,680
and then they lie to cover the lies.

1221
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,320
Girls, can you go play
in the other room for a minute?

1222
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,280
critic of the system,
claiming that...

1223
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,920
the antiquated equipment
at the center failed him.

1224
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,080
- Henry.
- There was...

1225
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,960
a memorial service today
in the small town...

1226
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,120
- of Norfolk, California.
- What were you doing...

1227
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,360
- in the basement?
- Perhaps the town...

1228
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,400
most devastated by the crash of 1025.

1229
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,080
Henry...

1230
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,880
were you in the basement
this afternoon before the blackout?

1231
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,840
Yeah, I was in the basement
before the power went out.

1232
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,240
Why?

1233
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,520
I was lookin' for somethin'.

1234
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,200
Behind the power supply unit?

1235
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,440
I was looking for
something in the room...

1236
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,880
then somebody came in and I hid
behind the power supply unit...

1237
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,600
and then the power went out,
but I didn't touch anything.

1238
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,800
Why did you hide behind
the power supply unit?

1239
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,960
Because I know how people are, Karen.

1240
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,280
- Why are you attacking me?
- Henry, they've got...

1241
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,320
a security camera
in the power supply room.

1242
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,920
You're on the tape!

1243
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,480
So, they've got me on tape.
I work there, don't I?

1244
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,600
Girls.

1245
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

1246
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,160
Henry...

1247
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:03,720
that was Harold on the phone.
They're looking for you.

1248
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,120
That's management. They're...

1249
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,200
- trying to intimidate you 'cause
- Look, Henry, no, that's...

1250
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
- they know that we're friends...
- not what it is. Henry...

1251
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,200
- and they...
- just be quietl

1252
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,240
Wait a minute.

1253
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:16,040
They couldn't possibly think that
this is intentional?

1254
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,600
They think that
I caused the blackout?

1255
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,560
My God!

1256
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,680
They called the F.B.I.

1257
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,160
God.

1258
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,840
The F.B.I., they called the F.B.I.
for me. I've gotta go.

1259
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,160
- My God!
- Just call them and you explain...

1260
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,720
- to them or you explain it to me.
- I can't explain!

1261
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,880
I can't explain! I've done that.

1262
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,240
Nobody is gonna help me now. Nobody!

1263
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,880
- Unbelievable.
- What?

1264
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,320
Blackouts in the national database.

1265
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,880
And this is just for this year.

1266
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,160
Look at the times on some of these,
a minute and a half, three minutes...

1267
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,880
- four minutes?
- Are you ready for this?

1268
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,440
I just spoke with Midwest.

1269
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,640
They think that Henry Drake is
responsible for the blackout today.

1270
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,920
What? How?

1271
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,720
They caught him on security tape...

1272
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,960
- near the power supply.
- What the hell...

1273
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,320
- was he doing?
- I don't know.

1274
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,400
- Did anybody ask him?
- They can't. He's gone.

1275
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,920
I need more time.

1276
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,240
I'm not cancelling
this press conference, John.

1277
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:24,560
What is it you expect to find?

1278
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,640
Last year there're over 1,500 outages
across the country.

1279
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,920
I just experienced one today.
Now, how is it that this facility...

1280
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,400
is so damn sure that one little
three second glitch didn't happen?

1281
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,520
I've got two unsatisfactory
condition reports...

1282
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,960
that no one seems to be able to find.

1283
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,200
I've got a lab technician
who used to work at that facility...

1284
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,040
who's telling me that he's seen
a data block disappear from a scope.

1285
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,280
He's seen it happen.
Now why are we...

1286
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,040
rushing to blame a hundred and
eighty-five deaths on one guy...

1287
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,200
- when we're not sure?
- You're not sure.

1288
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,200
Yes, and I'm the lead investigator
of this case, sir.

1289
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,680
Let me tell you something, John.

1290
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,280
I speak to the American public,
I speak to the U.S. Congress...

1291
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,000
and today I spoke to the President
of the United States.

1292
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,920
Now, if you expect me
to publicly indict...

1293
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,520
the air traffic control system
based on a couple of...

1294
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,840
missing documents and one ex-lab
technician, you're very wrong.

1295
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,560
We had a deal, John. I'd allow you
to stay on this case if you could...

1296
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,280
handie it professionally,
emotionally. If you can't

1297
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,920
then I'll take you off.
Do you understand me?

1298
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,520
Yes, sir.

1299
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,440
With me tonight is Frank Wyatt...

1300
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,640
the facility manager
at Midwest Center.

1301
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,200
From the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Jim Travis...

1302
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,280
and Stephen Royer from the F.A.A.

1303
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,840
Now, our efforts have
focussed on communication...

1304
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,040
between the air traffic controller
at Midwest Center...

1305
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,680
and the Global pilot.

1306
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,520
Voice communication, black box data
have confirmed that...

1307
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,120
serious errors in judgement
were committed by...

1308
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,560
the air traffic controller who was in
contact with Global 1025...

1309
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,400
and the P.D.O. cargo jet.

1310
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,680
- I don't know.
- As to any findings that...

1311
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,000
the air traffic control system
itself was...

1312
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,160
compromised or deficient
in any way,...

1313
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,640
the N.T.S.B. has been unable
to make that determination.

1314
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,240
Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Royer
will answer questions...

1315
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,760
- regarding that.
- Mr. Wyatt, were there other...

1316
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,760
power outages at the facility that
may have been caused by Henry Drake?

1317
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,480
At this time, we've no idea.

1318
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,680
- What did they make?
- Come on.

1319
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,040
- Mr. Travis from the F.B.I...
- Four...

1320
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:09,800
- will now make a statement.
- five, six...

1321
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,560
As of 5.00pm tonight, the F.B.I.
has launched a nationwide...

1322
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,520
search for Henry Drake.

1323
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,120
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight...

1324
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,680
He's wanted for questioning in
regards to the crash of Global 1025

1325
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,440
as well as the blackout
which occurred today...

1326
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,040
at the Midwest Facility.

1327
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,560
We're notifying all local
law enforcement agencies...

1328
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,880
to assist us in his apprehension.

1329
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,840
Do you see this as an act of revenge
by Henry Drake?

1330
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,280
That's certainly possible,
though we can't comment on...

1331
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,840
his motives until we question him.

1332
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,240
Is there any speculation that
the crash of 1025...

1333
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,240
was not an accident,
but somehow a deliberate act?

1334
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,120
We can't speculate right now

1335
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,520
but we're certainly
looking into that possibility.

1336
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,600
Look at this.

1337
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,200
This is a tape of the traffic
we plugged into yesterday.

1338
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,480
The scope overheated for four hours.

1339
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,680
Now, keep your eye on this.

1340
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,160
That is a Tristate jet 624
and now it's at ten thousand feet.

1341
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,960
It disappeared.

1342
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,080
Now watch. It's not there...

1343
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,360
It's not there...

1344
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,520
There it is. Now it's at 15,000 feet.

1345
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,240
That's exactly what Drake said
happened to his scope.

1346
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,440
Did we check the fan
on Drake's scope?

1347
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,160
It functioned.

1348
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:26,120
You don't think this guy is guilty?
I mean, come on!

1349
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,360
Look at the guy! Total loser.

1350
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,560
Ticking time bomb.

1351
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,280
- He's guilty.
- He's like that guy you wanted...

1352
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,160
to beat up in high school, right?
Now he's like in the spotlight.

1353
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,000
This is his fifteen minutes of fame.

1354
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,160
Right, like killing a bunch of
people wasn't enough.

1355
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,080
Watch this!

1356
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:42,080
You know, I wanna hear from callers.

1357
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,560
Where do you think
Henry Drake is right now?

1358
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,320
Did anybody check his Mom's house?

1359
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,640
I need your help.

1360
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,360
I told you yesterday, man,
I quit that place.

1361
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,920
Lot of pressure around there lately?

1362
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,720
Yeah, a little bit.

1363
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,240
What else?

1364
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,360
Look, I'm paying someone by
the hour to ask those questions.

1365
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,760
Listen, there's a guy out there that
everyone thinks may have killed...

1366
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:12,160
a hundred and eighty-five people.

1367
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:16,000
And maybe he did. But if he didn't,
do you want that on your conscience?

1368
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,640
Gimme a break, man.

1369
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,600
As the intensive manhunt
for Henry Drake increases...

1370
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,800
more questions arise.
The unthinkable.

1371
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,480
Could Henry Drake have deliberately
caused the crash of 1025?

1372
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,960
Who is Henry Drake?

1373
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,520
Kicked off the student council
at Dunbar High School...

1374
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:34,400
fellow students recall the straight-A
nerd as hotheaded and argumentative.

1375
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,800
Fellow chess club member, Tom Brown
says he was stickler for details...

1376
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,840
and an avid science fiction...

1377
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,520
I bet ya didn't think
you'd be back down here so quick?

1378
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,160
When I worked down here,
we're afraid to take...

1379
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,000
this stuff apart,
the connections were so old.

1380
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,000
That's a relic?

1381
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,560
We're the number one buyer of
vacuum tubes in the world.

1382
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,800
We're the only buyer of vacuum tubes
in the world.

1383
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,560
I can never figure out why they
haven't tried to update the system.

1384
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,720
They tried. They gave
an outside company...

1385
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:17,440
a contract to redesign the software.
Three billion dollars later...

1386
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,040
they still hadn't come up
with anything better.

1387
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,880
- They just scrapped the project.
- They come up with nothing?

1388
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,200
Zip.

1389
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,760
Three billion dollars.

1390
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,320
Look at this.

1391
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,720
What?

1392
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,400
See this part right here?
There's soot...

1393
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,200
on the connections from the wires...

1394
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,720
- to the fan.
- These are all old parts, right?

1395
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,960
Yeah, except for this right here.

1396
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,560
The fan.

1397
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,720
It's too clean. This is a new part.

1398
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,720
How do we find out
when it was replaced?

1399
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,280
Every part has a serial number.
Every serial number's gotta be...

1400
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,480
logged in the maintenance log book.

1401
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:49,760
Do you mind if I hang onto this
for a while?

1402
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,840
- No, not at all.
- Thanks.

1403
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,680
I know I'm just one of many
overdressed strangers...

1404
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:57,560
asking you where Mr. Drake is
right now, correct?

1405
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,720
And if you don't know where he is
or if you're lying about it, then...

1406
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,080
I'll be honest with you,
there's nothing I can do about it.

1407
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,520
I'm not a cop or the F.B.I.
or the F.A.A.

1408
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,240
All I wanna know is
what happened to 1025.

1409
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,720
So...

1410
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,240
if and when you do
speak to Mir. Drake...

1411
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,840
will you please tell him that
I am his only hope?

1412
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:24,080
It sounds corny,
but he'll know what it means.

1413
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:32,680
Ms. Garfield?

1414
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,680
This is a maintenance log
from the Midwest Center.

1415
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,200
Would you do an analysis on it
as soon as you can?

1416
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,280
An analysis? What are you...

1417
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,640
- looking for?
- I don't know. Anything...

1418
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,080
- out of the ordinary.
- John, it was human error.

1419
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,560
- You know it.
- Just do it. Thank you.

1420
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,080
- John. The Midwest Center...
- Yeah?

1421
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,040
has no record of this.

1422
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,320
And we don't know
when it was installed?

1423
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,240
How about when it was
shipped from the manufacturer?

1424
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:55,720
They don't know.

1425
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,640
Are you telling me that no one
at Midwest Center...

1426
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,920
has any record of this part at all?

1427
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,200
That doesn't sound like
human error to me.

1428
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,520
No.

1429
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,640
Yeah, get me Frank Wyatt, please.

1430
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,160
I don't wanna have the discussion
anymore. I'm sick and tired of it.

1431
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,600
I know what you're gonna say anyway.

1432
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,040
Alls I'm saying is you can't say
the '94 Bulls...

1433
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,360
could beat the '83 Celtics
or the '88 Lakers.

1434
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,000
- It was a different game back then.
- So what? That's not my fault!

1435
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,560
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Why are you taking it so personally?

1436
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,240
Yeah? Who is it? Yeah, hang on.

1437
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,640
Karen, it's for you. It's "some guy."

1438
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:31,760
He's goin' after that pension,
baby, you know it!

1439
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,680
- You guys give me a headache.
- Careful.

1440
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,720
- Hello?
- Karen, it's me, Henry.

1441
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,360
- Where are you?
- I'm just gonna ask you...

1442
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,320
to do one thing, okay?

1443
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,680
Karen? Would you just do
this one thing for me?

1444
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,520
Do not go to work at the facility
on Wednesday.

1445
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,520
- And don't fly.
- What are you saying?

1446
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,960
Just do what I'm telling you to do.

1447
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,160
Do not fly or go to work
at the facility on Wednesday.

1448
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,240
Listen, they wanna help you.

1449
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,600
Tag that and get a copy to Paul Roth.

1450
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,720
- As soon as ya can. Thanks.
- Will do.

1451
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,320
I think Henry's gonna do something.

1452
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,440
- What?
- I don't know what.

1453
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,760
But he called me and
told me not to go...

1454
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,680
near the facility or
fly on Wednesday.

1455
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,880
This Wednesday? Two days from now.
Did he say why?

1456
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,160
No.

1457
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,200
That's the day before Thanksgiving.
Excuse me.

1458
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,080
He told her not to fly
or go to the facility.

1459
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,880
Now, I'd take that
as a serious threat.

1460
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,600
You don't know Henry Drake like I do.
He's all talk.

1461
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,320
You're the one that accused him
of shutting down the system.

1462
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,320
He doesn't work here anymore. As long
as he's out there and not in here...

1463
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,560
- he's not a threat.
- Is there any way that he could...

1464
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,200
- get in here?
- How? The facility's...

1465
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,360
guarded twenty-four hours a day.

1466
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,640
We've changed the security codes.
How can he get in?

1467
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:54,960
We're meeting with the F.B.I.
We're taking this seriously.

1468
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,960
You handle the N.T.S.B.
investigation, John.

1469
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,600
We'll worry about Henry Drake.

1470
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,480
- Okay.
- Alright, let's get started.

1471
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,400
There's nothing unusual
about any of the entries.

1472
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,800
Except for two.

1473
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,280
This entry was made
three months ago, August 8th.

1474
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,360
"Scope serviced, check data display,
results pass."

1475
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:16,160
Now, everything looks normal
to the naked eye.

1476
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,320
Writing's the same, ink's the same.

1477
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,240
The scope I.D. number is 5321.

1478
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,960
But, under infrared,
the entry looks like this.

1479
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,000
Everything still looks the same
except for the scope I.D. number.

1480
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,240
5321 is now 58273.

1481
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,960
The three's been altered to
look like an eight...

1482
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:40,000
the one to a seven,
and somebody's added a three.

1483
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,920
5321.

1484
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,240
That was Drake's scope.

1485
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,160
- And the other entry?
- Same complaint...

1486
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,760
same service, also passed.

1487
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,400
Keep that log secure.

1488
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,080
John. You're right.

1489
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,320
I knew you'd find it.
Thanks, Ms. Garfield.

1490
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,600
I'm not workin' traffic tomorrow
if you're thinkin' of bustin' me.

1491
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,040
A draft. Want another one?

1492
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,360
- I'm good, thanks.
- Just one.

1493
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,360
What do you wanna talk about now?

1494
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:28,800
Is there a question
you've not asked me?

1495
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,160
Yeah.

1496
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:34,880
Who altered the two entries
in the maintenance log book?

1497
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,720
Can't help you on that one.

1498
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,120
I think you can.

1499
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,800
And I'm not gonna leave till you do.

1500
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,800
Thanks.

1501
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,680
You listen to me.

1502
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,840
I've cooperated with you.
I've answered your questions.

1503
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,520
You don't disrespect me
by cornin' in here...

1504
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,560
and accusin' me of something
I know nothing about.

1505
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,640
Were they changed before or after
the crash?

1506
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't know what the hell
you're talkin' about.

1507
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,280
You guys.

1508
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,680
You guys think they're just
blips on a screen, don't you?

1509
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,400
You don't know what I think.

1510
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:11,520
There is nothing you or I could
ever do to bring those people back.

1511
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,800
Were they changed before or after
the crash?

1512
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,560
How would I know anything
about entries in the program log?

1513
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,160
'Cause you're the supervisor.

1514
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,360
Only you and the lab technician
have access to it.

1515
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,720
Then you should
talk to the lab technician.

1516
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,360
I just did.

1517
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,120
I already know you did it.
I just don't know why.

1518
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,120
I got thirty years on this job.

1519
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,320
I tell somebody below me
to do something, they do it.

1520
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,720
Somebody above me tells me
to do something, I do it.

1521
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:46,680
That's the way it works, man.

1522
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:49,280
How come you don't understand that?

1523
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,720
Who told you to change the log?

1524
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,920
Frank Wyatt please.
It's John Dantley calling.

1525
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,440
Yes, I'd. Would you please
tell him to meet me...

1526
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,400
tomorrow afternoon at the crash site?
It's urgent. Thank you.

1527
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,400
Okay.

1528
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,280
Great.

1529
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,960
The whole system's fried.

1530
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:30,080
Repeater scope, console,
radios, everything.

1531
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,720
I've never seen anything like it.

1532
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,000
- Thanks, George.
- Yeah.

1533
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,000
- How do you fry an entire system?
- HERF.

1534
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,400
- Beg your pardon?
- High energy radio frequency.

1535
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,120
They used something like it
in the Gulf War.

1536
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,920
It'd shut down communications,
radar, it fries everything.

1537
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,400
- Name?
- Jim Hale.

1538
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:56,680
ID?

1539
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,280
Maintenance from International?

1540
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,720
Yes, sir.

1541
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:13,520
Do you know where to park?

1542
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,080
- Sure do.
- Alright, then.

1543
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,480
Jim Hale from International.

1544
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,960
Okay.

1545
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,160
We gotcha here.
If you could just sign in for me...

1546
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,120
- please.
- Yes, ma'am.

1547
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,840
How's Jenny?

1548
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,680
Jenny Glass? She's fine. Yeah,
she works weekends now.

1549
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,440
- Well, you tell her I said hi.
- I sure will.

1550
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,160
You know the code, right?

1551
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,120
No actually. You know,
they had changed it...

1552
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,600
after the last time
I was here, I think.

1553
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,200
- Do you mind?
- Sure, no problem.

1554
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,400
Thank you so much.

1555
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,120
- Tell Jenny I say hi.
- I will.

1556
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,680
- Meadows, I'm back.
- So, what is it...

1557
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,160
you wanted me to see, John?

1558
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,160
You ever been to a crash site before?

1559
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,400
No.

1560
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,640
Quite a smell, isn't it?

1561
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:12,080
Each crash site
has a very unique smell.

1562
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:18,400
Can't get rid of it. Gets on you.
Your clothes, your shoes.

1563
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,440
I've never gotten used to it.

1564
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,040
The 757 didn't explode on impact.

1565
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,760
The tail section tore off
from the sheer force of the fall.

1566
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,880
But it didn't explode.
It just spiralled down...

1567
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,160
- My God.
- for two minutes.

1568
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,080
Everyone was still strapped in
and alive till it hit the ground.

1569
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,960
For two minutes.

1570
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,400
Can you imagine what those
two minutes must've been like...

1571
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,200
for those passengers?

1572
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,920
No.

1573
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,720
No, I can't, John.

1574
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,040
See this little fan?
It's part of a scope.

1575
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,800
It has one function only
to cool the unit.

1576
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:02,920
You see, what happened the night
of the crash, a little wire...

1577
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,880
connected to the fan arced.
The fan stopped working.

1578
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,000
And that caused
the character generator to overheat.

1579
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,320
So the scope blacked out.

1580
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,920
When the scope blacked out,
the data block vanished...

1581
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,440
which caused the controller to give
the wrong information to the pilot...

1582
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,680
which caused the two planes
to fly into each other...

1583
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,400
and kill a hundred and
eighty-five people...

1584
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,800
including a woman
I knew and loved.

1585
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,040
Because of this little part,
you recognize it?

1586
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,000
It's from Henry Drake's scope.

1587
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,560
It was replaced
the night of the crash.

1588
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,520
Of course it should've been replaced
months ago when Drake said...

1589
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,320
"Hey, there's something wrong
with my scope," but...

1590
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,480
nobody's gonna listen to
a guy like that.

1591
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,240
But after the crash...

1592
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:43,320
somebody listened
and replaced this part.

1593
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,880
And destroyed
the unsatisfactory reports he filed.

1594
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,920
And nothing was said to the N.T.S.B.

1595
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,080
Nothing was said when
an innocent man was blamed.

1596
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:52,880
Nothing was said when a hundred
and eighty-five people were killed!

1597
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:55,800
Wait a minute. Do you think that
if I knew that this would happen...

1598
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,120
that I'd allow it to happen?

1599
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,400
But you did allow it to happen.

1600
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,200
I did not know, John.

1601
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,920
- You don't understand.
- Well, tell me.

1602
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,680
- Tell me what I don't understand.
- Every day, every single day...

1603
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,280
I'm responsible for keeping
thousands of planes in the sky.

1604
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,960
That's my job.

1605
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,600
People spend longer
'n twenty minutes...

1606
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,520
on the tarmac in Chicago,
John, I hear about it.

1607
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,080
But I only have so much
control of airspace.

1608
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,200
So many controllers, so many scopes

1609
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,480
so many technicians and equipment
that breaks down.

1610
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,480
I've to keep the planes
running on time...

1611
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,640
with a system that
I'm just trying to keep afloat.

1612
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,160
Now, I know that that's not right.

1613
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,160
We make do with what we have.

1614
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,600
But if it's not right,
then why do you protect it?

1615
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,160
Because it's what we do.

1616
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:52,840
Frank...

1617
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,560
Yeah, Bill Kennedy, please.
It's John Dantley calling.

1618
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:11,160
Yeah, I'll hold.

1619
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,320
I don't care what time it is. Do it.

1620
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,640
- Just do it.
- Right over there...

1621
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,640
I want agents spread out
in a two mile radius of the facility.

1622
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,320
Go!

1623
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,760
- Dantley.
- Go on inside.

1624
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,720
- They're expecting you.
- Thanks.

1625
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,160
I say we do what he says.

1626
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,480
We're running out of time, gentlemen.

1627
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,200
What did the Department of
Transportation say?

1628
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:04,840
I spoke to the Secretary
an hour ago. It's our call.

1629
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,280
We shut the Midwest Center down,
that means we ground the planes...

1630
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,480
the day before Thanksgiving.

1631
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,960
- We're gonna ground the planes?
- Chaos.

1632
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:11,920
We already have it.
We got two hour delays.

1633
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,040
People are cancelling flights.
Phone lines are overloaded.

1634
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,360
- Airports are a mess.
- Ground the planes.

1635
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,880
Think of our priorities here.

1636
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,760
I understand your instinct to be
cautious. It's mine, too.

1637
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:22,280
But the threat is not
specific enough.

1638
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:23,600
How much more specific can he be?

1639
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,320
He said "ground the planes in an hour
or I'll shut this system down."

1640
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,720
How?

1641
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,800
He can't get inside the building.
I couldn't get inside the building.

1642
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,280
He can't do it outside the building.

1643
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,520
We got built-in E.M.I.
shielding that blocks frequencies.

1644
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,960
What, Frank, up to ten gigahertz?

1645
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,520
Radar's off-site and heavily guarded.

1646
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,360
So, you'd put your wife on a plane
right now?

1647
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,520
That's not the issue.

1648
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,480
- That is the issue.
- Unless Henry Drake...

1649
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,480
is some kind of a genius,
I cannot believe this man...

1650
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,200
can shut this system down.
I cannot, in good conscience...

1651
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,160
stop fifty million people from
travelling today. I can't do it.

1652
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,360
He is a genius, Royer.
Ground the planes.

1653
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,760
Hello?

1654
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,280
John, I think you better take this.

1655
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,720
- Hello?
- I'm shuttin' it down.

1656
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,000
You've five minutes.

1657
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,320
He's here. We've got five minutes.

1658
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,600
Excuse me.

1659
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,040
Watch it, coming through!

1660
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:17,280
Check the microwave links
upstairs on the roof.

1661
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,600
Got it.

1662
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:47,720
Henry.

1663
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:49,440
Don't come any closer.

1664
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,360
Stay right there.

1665
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,520
So, is anybody listening to me now?

1666
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,160
Yeah, we're listening.

1667
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,480
- We're all listening.
- Haven't shut it down though

1668
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,880
have they?

1669
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,360
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna shut it down myself.

1670
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,800
You see this?

1671
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,360
I can fry this whole system.
You'd never get it back up.

1672
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:12,760
They'd have to ground the planes
for a week.

1673
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,680
And, what about the ones
up there right now?

1674
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,120
What happens to them?

1675
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,720
I can't think about them.

1676
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,120
Well, think about it.

1677
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,560
Henry, you want more people to die?

1678
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,080
How many more innocent people
have to die?

1679
01:21:28,160 --> 01:21:29,720
Five hundred? A thousand?

1680
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,480
- Two thousand.
- No. Don't come any closer!

1681
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,360
Stay right where you are.

1682
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:41,360
Well... what you're gonna
kill yourself and me?

1683
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,840
For what? You're innocent.
I proved it.

1684
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:48,520
You're lying.

1685
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,320
There was a flaw in the system.
We found it.

1686
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,600
And I promise you,
I'll do everything within my power...

1687
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,360
- to fix it.
- It can't be fixed!

1688
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:02,480
Maybe not, but I can at least try.

1689
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:05,240
And I need your help.

1690
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,840
Henry, don't let...

1691
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:10,280
those hundred and eighty-five people
die in vain.

1692
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,400
Make their lives count for something.

1693
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,800
- I didn't...
- Make their families think that...

1694
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,880
that something...

1695
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,560
- decent can come out of all this.
- I...

1696
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,520
- I didn't...
- Don't take that away from them...

1697
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,520
or me.

1698
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,360
I didn't kill those people.

1699
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,080
I didn't kill those people.

1700
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:35,200
I know.

1701
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,840
I just... I didn't kill them.

1702
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,040
I didn't kill them.

1703
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:44,800
I didn't kill those people...

1704
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,240
I know.
