Well, right now,
it's to make sure you do yours.

watch 'em grow up

and become a full person.

554

And then they leave.

555

They go off and do things
you'll never see.

Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

557

But then somehow
you find yourself,

558
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:00,289

Carl! Where you headed?

877
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:04,888
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

878
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:06,289
at the playground
on Main Street.

879
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:08,155
Rumor has it
they got two pinatas.

880
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,823
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!

Uh, no,
I can't, sir.

885
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:21,755
Bo, I need to get
back to my kid.

886
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,356
- ALL: What?
- You got a kid?

887
00:39:23,455 --> 00:39:24,755
Yeah.

888
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,854
COMBAT CARL: Way to beat
the odds, soldier.

889
00:39:26,955 --> 00:39:28,155
Meet you at the
playground, Peep.

890
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,989
Combat Carl's got
a pinata party to crash.

891
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:34,155
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

892
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,954
So, you're, uh,
with a kid?

893
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:38,189
It's not Andy, is it?

894
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:40,121
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

895
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:42,089
But he gave us to Bonnie.

896
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:44,088
- You have a little girl?
- No way!

897
00:39:44,188 --> 00:39:45,822
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

898
00:39:45,922 --> 00:39:47,055
Her other toy is trapped

899
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,389
in this antique store,
and I have to...

900
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,322
Second Chance Antiques?

901
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,787
We know that store.

902
00:39:51,888 --> 00:39:53,155
That's great.
That is great!

903
00:39:53,255 --> 00:39:54,922
If you know the store,
you could really

904
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:56,321
- help me find him...
- No way.

905
00:39:56,421 --> 00:39:57,854
We wasted years there,

906
00:39:57,955 --> 00:39:58,988
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

907
00:39:59,088 --> 00:40:00,755
Oh, Bo, that's awful.

908
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:01,855
But I don't have a choice.

909
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:03,788
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

910
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:05,254
Whoa. Steer clear
of that weirdo.

911
00:40:05,354 --> 00:40:07,722
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

912
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,022
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

913
00:40:10,122 --> 00:40:12,623
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

914
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:14,088
No, no...

915
00:40:14,189 --> 00:40:17,788
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

I didn't know you had a kid.

920
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,122
That was a long time ago.

921
00:40:26,222 --> 00:40:28,656
Oh, Bo's kid was
something special.

922
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,322
She was the cutest thing...

923
00:40:30,421 --> 00:40:32,356
but so afraid
of the dark.

924
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,888
It was just a phase.

925
00:40:33,988 --> 00:40:35,155
Oh, you weren't there
in the beginning.

926
00:40:35,255 --> 00:40:37,222
Hearing Molly cry
each night...

927
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:40,154
it broke every
toy's heart.

928
00:40:40,255 --> 00:40:43,055
And then,
Bo came into the room.

929
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:47,022
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

930
00:40:47,121 --> 00:40:49,089
Mom would let her
keep Bo on all night.

931
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:51,121
Ha! Who knew you were
such a softy?

932
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:52,356
And Molly would
fall asleep

933
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,854
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

934
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,155
- Okay! Okay. I get it.

I don't know.
Couple years.

1439
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:56,721
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

1440

Aw, Sheriff.

You're selling
yourself short.

I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

you'll ever be in

You'd be surprised.

1457
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,886
So, how'd you end up in this
store in the first place?

1458
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:37,187
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

1459
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:41,120
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

1460
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,153
and so I, uh...

1461
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:48,187
Wow.

01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:01,520
Forky's still in there.

1556
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,054
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

1557
01:06:03,153 --> 01:06:04,653
You want us
to go back in there?

1558

We barely
got out alive.

1559
01:06:05,987 --> 01:06:07,621
Woody, it's better
if we wait.

1560
01:06:07,721 --> 01:06:08,821
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

1561
01:06:08,921 --> 01:06:10,021
But I saw Bonnie's...

1562
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:10,953
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

1563
01:06:11,053 --> 01:06:11,987
But the backpack...

1564
01:06:12,086 --> 01:06:13,253
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

1565
01:06:13,352 --> 01:06:14,886
Woody, look at us!

1568
01:06:20,786 --> 01:06:23,053
No. No, no, no. We are wasting time.
We can do this.

- Just because!

01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:32,121
Why?

1575
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:33,921
Because it's all
I have left to do!

1576
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,253
I don't have anything else.

1577
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,252
So, the rest of us
don't count?

1578
01:06:42,385 --> 01:06:44,353
That's not what I meant.

1579
01:06:44,454 --> 01:06:45,887
Bonnie needs Forky.

1580
01:06:45,987 --> 01:06:48,621
No. You need Bonnie!

1581
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:49,853
Open your eyes, Woody.

1582
01:06:49,954 --> 01:06:51,720
There's plenty of kids
out there.

1583
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:56,021
It can't be just about the
one you're still clinging to.

1584
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,020
It's called loyalty.

all you could.

1597

I don't leave

Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

1602

Not now. Not ever.

1603
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,987

But I do.

1622
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:37,953
You were left in the
closet, feeling useless...

1623

wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

I'm not leaving
without Forky.

1625

Can we agree
on just one thing?

1626
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:46,053
What?

1627
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:47,920
That being there for a child

1628
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:51,319
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1629
01:08:52,853 --> 01:08:54,053

I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you.

1632
01:09:04,218 --> 01:09:07,786
All that time you
spent with Andy...

1633
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:11,920
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

1634
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:15,621

when he skinned his knee...

1635

proudly watching him
grow up.

1636
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,954
And then you got a second
chance with Bonnie...

1637
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:24,853
giving her comfort when
she's scared at school...

she needs it most.

as it sounds?

just one of those moments.

loved the way you have.
