And now, introducing our

00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:25,695
(audience cheering)

10
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,528
On your mark, get set,

11
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:29,510
go!

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,677
(upbeat techno music)

13
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,344
Move it!

14
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:54,664
- [Woman] Hey.

15
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:57,831
(upbeat techno music)

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:14,833
- [Voiceover] Go!

17
00:01:21,068 --> 00:01:24,151
(speaking inaudibly)

18
00:01:26,944 --> 00:01:28,289
- What?

19
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,026
- I said I closed early,
we're a hundred over capacity.

20
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:32,397
- Get the hell back
down there and open up,

21
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:34,310
there's a line around the block.

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,876
Fire Marshall doesn't give
a shit about this place.

23
00:01:36,876 --> 00:01:40,209
- Okay, okay, don't lift your leg on me.

24
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:45,742
(upbeat techno music)

25
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:51,478
- Geno.

26
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,668
- You wanna shut that curtain over there,

27
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,585
that beat's killin' me.

28
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,832
- Five GHB, three Special
K's, six hits of Rex,

29
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:02,408
and two eight-balls.

30
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:11,871
- You are cleared for takeoff.

31
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,915
(giggling)

32
00:02:20,423 --> 00:02:21,539
- Haven't I already done you?

33
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,898
- Uh huh, three times, Johnny,
but you're the most action

34
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,486
this old girl's gonna get tonight.

35
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:27,680
- Get outta here.

36
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,740
- Oh please, just frisk me
one more time, I'm so close.

37
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,698
- [John] Next in line.

38
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,374
(huffing)

39
00:02:34,374 --> 00:02:37,541
(upbeat techno music)

40
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:47,105
♫ I'm rising, rising above the clouds

41
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,948
♫ Nothin' can keep me down

42
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:54,115
♫ I'm tryin', keepin' the hope alive

43
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,597
♫ I'm goin' higher, higher ♫

44
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,564
- [John] It's Miller time.

45
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,314
(woman laughing)

46
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,376
(upbeat techno music)

47
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:24,755
(water dripping)

48
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:58,429
(faucet running)

49
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,254
Hello, gorgeous.

50
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:19,004
(punching noise)

51
00:04:20,253 --> 00:04:23,086
(punching noises)

52
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:39,264
(police siren)

53
00:04:39,264 --> 00:04:40,713
(squealing tires)

54
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,247
- Shit!

55
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:43,773
- [Officer] Just talk to 'em.

56
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:46,356
(police siren)

57
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:51,269
Put your hands up, turn around,

58
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,852
and place them above your head.

59
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:57,601
This should be fun.

60
00:04:57,601 --> 00:05:00,589
- Let's just give him a warning
and cut him loose, okay?

61
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:02,256
- You kiddin' right?

62
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,658
(doors slamming)

63
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:23,153
Gimme your ID.

64
00:05:23,153 --> 00:05:25,524
- Look, I know what we
were doin' is wrong,

65
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:27,857
I'm not that kind of person.

66
00:05:29,405 --> 00:05:31,826
- You disgust me, you know that?

67
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:32,659
- Sir?

68
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,826
- I said, you disgust me,
what, can't you hear me?

69
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:40,858
Well?

70
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,286
- Please...

71
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,410
- No please.

72
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:58,452
Okay.

73
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:00,383
- [Man In Brown Vest] Okay.

74
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:04,132
- Mike, take it easy, let's
just let him go, okay?

75
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:05,698
- Well maybe he likes a little pain, huh?

76
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,219
Look at that, see?

77
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,719
- Leave him alone!

78
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:12,340
- Johnny?

79
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,829
- Do you two know each other?

80
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:23,977
- Go, get the hell outta here, man, go.

81
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:36,724
(shower running)

82
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,253
(people chatting)

83
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:41,336
- [Passers-By] That's the
guy I'm talkin' about.

84
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:42,408
Can you believe it?

85
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:43,828
(wolf whistling)

86
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:45,411
That really is sad.

87
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,450
(showers running)

88
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,391
(men laughing)

89
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:56,736
- [Men In Showers] Here it comes.

90
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:58,425
Boys, look who's just arrived.

91
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,755
(wolf whistles)

92
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,816
Hey, baby.

93
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:04,566
(kissing noises)

94
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,119
Don't drop the soap.

95
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,420
(shower turning on)

96
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:30,948
- [Man Off-Screen] We
got a problem here, John.

97
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:32,321
Nobody wants to be your partner,

98
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:35,321
and I can't fire you for being uh...

99
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:37,251
How you are.

100
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:41,933
And I'd never even try, you know that.

101
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:42,850
- Yes, sir.

102
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:45,794
- [Man In White Shirt]
(sighing) Your private life

103
00:07:45,794 --> 00:07:48,200
is your own business, but this is a small,

104
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,700
conservative town.

105
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:53,875
Why do you want to do police work here?

106
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:55,042
- Because, um,

107
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,010
because I grew up here.

108
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,053
- Have you ever considered relocating to

109
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:08,528
an environment more compatible
with your lifestyle?

110
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,340
Aren't you lonely, son?

111
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:19,869
- Yeah.

112
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:25,322
(door slamming)

113
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:26,655
What's goin' on?

114
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,928
- [Mike] Hey, John.

115
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:31,088
- What's this, oh Jesus Christ, man.

116
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:32,886
(men laughing and jeering)

117
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,016
Mike, this is bullshit.

118
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,997
I'm not gonna fight you tonight.

119
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:41,195
(punching noises)

120
00:08:41,195 --> 00:08:43,778
(men cheering)

121
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:07,271
Hey, okay, you sure that when I get to LA

122
00:09:07,271 --> 00:09:10,440
I can stay with you guys for a while?

123
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,021
Okay, I mean like, Gil won't mind?

124
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,733
- [Man On Phone] I'm your
cousin, girl, we sisters.

125
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,920
- Tad, if you call me girl, so help me God

126
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,048
I am not coming.

127
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:21,195
- [Tad] Okay, okay, okay.

128
00:09:21,195 --> 00:09:24,193
You don't belong in that world,
John, you can chill here.

129
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,360
- Okay, so um,

130
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:32,569
are you sure you won't
mind my bird friends?

131
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:34,373
- Of course not.

132
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,111
Believe me, I've got friends who fly, too.

133
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,278
(upbeat techno music)

134
00:10:13,468 --> 00:10:15,801
(chuckling)

135
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,291
- Does anybody work in California?

136
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:43,421
Tomkat.

137
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,675
- [Tad] Hey!

138
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:56,974
How are you?

139
00:10:59,183 --> 00:11:01,415
Um, so, some things have changed, since

140
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:03,311
last time we spoke.

141
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:04,728
- Since Saturday?

142
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,703
- Um, Gil and I are sort of, over.

143
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:14,024
This is Julian, he's my new boyfriend.

144
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:17,274
- [Julian] Hey, hey man, welcome to LA.

145
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,828
I really wanna be your friend.

146
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:22,661
- Okay.

147
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,471
- Hey John, I can see
by the look on your face

148
00:11:27,471 --> 00:11:29,221
Tad's fillin' you in.

149
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,476
(crickets chirping)

150
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:40,652
- [John] I always thought you
two were the perfect couple.

151
00:11:40,652 --> 00:11:45,375
- Well, I guess I'm hoping it's
a phase Tad's going through.

152
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:48,730
Julian is a psycho guru DJ we met

153
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,035
out dancing the other night.

154
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:52,368
He wanted to do a three-way.

155
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,940
And we were bored.

156
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:00,596
That's the last time I get high.

157
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:05,407
(dishes rattling)

158
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,229
- So, they're both living in your house?

159
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,018
- It's Tad's house, too.

160
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,351
For seven years.

161
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:14,383
I'm a wuss, huh?

162
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:15,642
(laughing)

163
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:19,486
- Look, Gil, um, if there's
not enough room here

164
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:20,372
I can work somethin' out--

165
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,571
- No, no no no no, I insist you stay here,

166
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,735
I've been looking forward to your company.

167
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:25,991
- Oh, thank you.

168
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:26,824
- I have.

169
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,463
- (laughing) Okay.

170
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,296
(water splashing)

171
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:48,022
- Hey, what's with the camera?

172
00:12:48,022 --> 00:12:50,128
- I'm doing a documentary.

173
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:51,879
You ever heard of Circuit parties?

174
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,731
- Yeah I've heard of 'em.

175
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,835
Hey, are you a party boy now?

176
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:58,953
- No, and I never get involved
with any of my subjects.

177
00:12:58,953 --> 00:13:01,258
- [John] Is that why you're dating a DJ?

178
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,297
- (laughing) Eat me, baby.

179
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:07,592
So John, tell us, what are
your expectations of LA?

180
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:09,092
What's the allure?

181
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:12,852
- [John] Uh, I dunno.

182
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:15,685
I just um, wanna simplify my life.

183
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:21,253
- [Tad] Hey, we're invited
to a party tonight.

184
00:13:21,253 --> 00:13:23,316
- What? What party?

185
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:24,652
- It's up in the Hills.

186
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:27,761
I told some friends about you.

187
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,357
- I should definitely change then, huh?

188
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:31,774
Okay, well, I got

189
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,236
I got, is this okay?

190
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:38,397
- It's cute.

191
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:42,231
- [John] Wow, whose house?

192
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:44,624
- [Tad] Some studio exec.

193
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:47,827
Most of the Hollywood Gay
Mafia's gonna be here tonight.

194
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,639
- [Gil] Hey, John, when was the last time

195
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,858
you were at the aquarium?

196
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:53,936
- [John] I don't remember, why?

197
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:56,470
- [Gil] Welcome to the shark tank!

198
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,537
It's feeding time! (laughing)

199
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:02,054
Move out of the way.

200
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,842
(people talking)

201
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,183
(funky jazzy music)

202
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:08,016
Come on.

203
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,584
- Hi.

204
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,733
(men talking and laughing)

205
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:29,301
♫ Just close your eyes

206
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:31,829
♫ And follow me ♫

207
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,038
- Do I have spinach on my teeth?

208
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:35,940
- Keep smiling, and
don't be seduced by any

209
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,639
shiny objects like credit cards, okay?

210
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,972
(chuckling)

211
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:45,256
Hey, Mark.

212
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:47,133
- Gil, good to see you!

213
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,790
- [Gil] This is my friend
John I was telling you about.

214
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,373
- Oh, are you really en ex-cop?

215
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:56,235
(chuckling)

216
00:14:57,783 --> 00:15:00,783
(funky, slow music)

217
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:05,789
(people talking and laughing)

218
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:44,045
(water splashing)

219
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,113
(funky, slow music)

220
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:03,142
- Uh-uh, this stuff clouds my aura, man.

221
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:07,475
I gotta keep my system
clear to spin my tunes.

222
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,423
- You know, I totally dig
that about you, you are so

223
00:16:09,423 --> 00:16:12,987
committed to your music, you
know, it's like me and films.

224
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:17,126
- Oh my God, man, I was just
about to say the same thing.

225
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,959
(water splashing)

226
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,517
- Nice entrance.

227
00:16:25,114 --> 00:16:26,114
You workin'?

228
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:28,539
- Excuse me?

229
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,348
- You know, hustlin'.

230
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:34,207
- (laughing) Uh, look, if this

231
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:36,748
is your territory, not to worry.

232
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:40,325
- Even if you were
working, I wouldn't worry.

233
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:42,742
I'm one type, you're another.

234
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,286
- What type are you?

235
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,545
- You'll never know.

236
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:53,619
- Why is that?

237
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:56,915
- I only have sex for money.

238
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:02,512
Would you ever have sex for money?

239
00:17:02,512 --> 00:17:06,640
- (laughing) Hopefully
I'm not that hard up.

240
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,659
- What, you think only hard
up guys buy and sell sex?

241
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:10,659
Look around.

242
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:15,390
I've had sex with most
of the men at this party.

243
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,807
I even get paid to stay here.

244
00:17:22,528 --> 00:17:24,361
Want a little of this?

245
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:26,904
You look a little uncomfortable.

246
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,071
- What's that?

247
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:29,972
- It's GHB.

248
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,841
But it's a little dangerous, you have to

249
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:36,178
make sure that you take the right amount.

250
00:17:36,178 --> 00:17:39,193
- Why would I wanna risk that?

251
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:42,500
- Oh, it's worth the the risk, baby.

252
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,096
It's the most incredible
high you'll ever feel.

253
00:17:46,096 --> 00:17:48,875
It'll turn your whole body
into a raging hard-on.

254
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:52,514
- (laughing) Well, thanks, but uh,

255
00:17:52,514 --> 00:17:55,931
I think I'll keep my hard-on where it is.

256
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:57,895
- Okay.

257
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:02,096
Listen, uh, this is my card.

258
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:05,554
Call me if you get bored.

259
00:18:05,554 --> 00:18:07,637
I love beautiful friends.

260
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,634
- I appreciate you guys
helpin' me find this place,

261
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:20,954
I really do.

262
00:18:20,954 --> 00:18:22,621
- No problem, buddy.

263
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:27,842
- Hey, here, I brought you a
copy of our local yellow pages.

264
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,380
In case you get a little bored.

265
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,071
- Yeah. (laughing)

266
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:35,193
Welcome to a whole new
chapter of your life.

267
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:36,838
Hey, don't look so worried.

268
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,088
We live just down the hill.

269
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,996
- Hi, how you doin'?

270
00:18:43,996 --> 00:18:44,829
- Hi.

271
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,253
- (laughing) There you go.

272
00:18:50,253 --> 00:18:51,232
- Shut up.

273
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,815
- (laughing) Go for it.

274
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:53,648
- Shut up.

275
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:58,082
(birds chirping)

276
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:19,248
(birds chirping)

277
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:21,108
Come on.

278
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,230
(birds chirping)

279
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:57,989
(light, cheerful piano music)

280
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,501
(crickets chirping)

281
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:20,051
(shower running)

282
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:23,301
(swelling piano music)

283
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,315
(water splashing)

284
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:31,944
- Coffee.

285
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:32,777
- Thank you.

286
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:34,345
- Uh-huh.

287
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:35,178
- Thanks.

288
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:36,011
- Mhmm.

289
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:45,362
What's going on, what's eating you?

290
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:47,361
- You know, uh,

291
00:21:47,361 --> 00:21:51,211
I've been more than generous
with you Hector, I mean,

292
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:53,840
I never really planned on our regular

293
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,549
monetary commitment here, I mean,

294
00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:00,180
my lawyer says that uh,
I've opened myself up

295
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,224
to all sorts of...

296
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:03,974
- You've met someone.

297
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:10,362
- My therapist says I need to find someone

298
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,029
who likes me for me.

299
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:15,616
That I'm never gonna find true intimacy

300
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:18,146
until I try monogamy.

301
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:21,236
- Oh, baby, I agree to that.

302
00:22:21,236 --> 00:22:23,072
You know, you're getting
all this advice I mean,

303
00:22:23,072 --> 00:22:24,572
what do you think?

304
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:28,697
- I think, I think that we
care for each other a lot

305
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,547
but it's not gonna work.

306
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,722
I mean, I'm a public figure,
this town, they won't let it

307
00:22:32,722 --> 00:22:34,830
you know, it's still a
very homophobic town.

308
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,436
- Yeah, yeah, you're right
it is a very homophobic town.

309
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,459
So it's better you date someone

310
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,292
that you can pass off as your son.

311
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:07,943
(thumping dance music)

312
00:23:13,165 --> 00:23:16,165
(car door slamming)

313
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:23,436
(thumping dance music)

314
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,080
(grunting)

315
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:50,771
(thumping dance music)

316
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,332
(dialing phone)

317
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:16,876
Is Dr. Montel in?

318
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:17,876
It's Hector.

319
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:22,459
Yeah, well I need to see him.

320
00:24:23,639 --> 00:24:27,121
No, it's horrible, it's fucking horrible.

321
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:30,121
(crickets chirping)

322
00:25:02,829 --> 00:25:05,746
(papers shuffling)

323
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,075
(phone dialing)

324
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,885
- [Hector] Hello?

325
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:28,739
- [John] So I uh, finally
figured out what type you are.

326
00:25:28,739 --> 00:25:31,156
- Hi, John, what type's that?

327
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,607
- [John] Um, well, you're versatile.

328
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:38,774
Smooth, nine uncut, no
fats, no fems, no redheads.

329
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:43,265
(laughing)

330
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:52,343
- Fine, he's cutting me
off, what am I gonna do?

331
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:55,260
You know, I really liked Mark, too.

332
00:25:57,921 --> 00:25:59,366
I don't know what it's
like out there, John,

333
00:25:59,366 --> 00:26:01,436
I'm not 18 anymore.

334
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,502
- I'm not too worried about you.

335
00:26:03,502 --> 00:26:07,226
You seem like the kinda guy
that always lands on his feet.

336
00:26:07,226 --> 00:26:08,976
- [Hector] I do okay.

337
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,653
You're lucky you found
me, I'm a great host.

338
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:18,236
Party treats, baby?

339
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:20,439
- [John] No thanks, man.

340
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,909
I don't need that shit
to have a good time.

341
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:22,826
- Whatever.

342
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:36,506
That shirt looks good on you.

343
00:26:36,506 --> 00:26:39,528
(laughing)

344
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:40,361
- [Man In Glasses] They're cutting.

345
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:42,630
- [Man In Line] Hey,
guys, end of the line.

346
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,059
- [Club Worker] End of the line, fellas.

347
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:45,150
- [Hector] No, but I know Rick.

348
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:49,000
- Rick is in rehab, back of the line.

349
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,739
- Don't you know who I am?

350
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:53,076
- Darling, I don't even
know who you think you are.

351
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,224
Back of the line.

352
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:55,312
- I'm Hector, that's who I am.

353
00:26:55,312 --> 00:26:56,299
- [John] Come on, let's go,

354
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,223
- [Hector] No no, fuck
that, man, come on, no!

355
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:01,223
Ah, shut up.

356
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm not gonna stand out here
tweaking, John, alright?

357
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,248
I can feel, I can feel
it kickin' I'm not gonna

358
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:13,415
stand out here tweakin',
it's a waste of good drugs.

359
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,615
Take your shirt off.

360
00:27:17,615 --> 00:27:18,958
- No way, it's cold out here.

361
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,211
- Come on, I can see the DJ's assistant,

362
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:21,544
take your shirt off.

363
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:22,377
- No way!

364
00:27:22,377 --> 00:27:26,544
- [Assistant] Come on I gotta
get through, comin' through.

365
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,378
Hello.

366
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:31,259
- We don't like waiting, man.

367
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,654
- Man, I could play
your nipples like CD's.

368
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:36,598
- [Hector] Play, baby, play.

369
00:27:36,598 --> 00:27:39,802
Come on, you need to get us in.

370
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:40,635
- [Assistant] Follow me.

371
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,302
- Come on, let's go.

372
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,530
(men in line complaining)

373
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,467
What now, bitch?

374
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,550
- Get inside.

375
00:27:53,244 --> 00:27:56,494
(strobing dance music)

376
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:03,469
♫ From one to another,
they're movin' their feet

377
00:28:03,469 --> 00:28:07,034
♫ From one to another
they're buildin' the beat

378
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:10,487
♫ From one to another
come join all the fun

379
00:28:10,487 --> 00:28:14,332
♫ Leave your worries behind
'cause the party's begun

380
00:28:14,332 --> 00:28:17,482
♫ From one to another
they're here in the room

381
00:28:17,482 --> 00:28:22,432
♫ From one to another
they're getting too warm ♫

382
00:28:22,432 --> 00:28:25,813
- [Man In Hat] What's up Hector?

383
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:28,980
(men greeting Hector)

384
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:37,095
- [Man In Blue Shirt] Hey
Hector, what's up, hey.

385
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:39,760
- Hey, baby.

386
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,835
- [Woman] Hey, Hector.

387
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:41,681
Go on in.

388
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:43,913
- Oh this is my friend
John here, he's a virgin.

389
00:28:43,913 --> 00:28:45,212
- Welcome, John.

390
00:28:45,212 --> 00:28:46,045
- Hi.

391
00:28:46,045 --> 00:28:48,370
- [Woman In Blue Shirt] Well,
you boys have a good time.

392
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,620
- [Hector] What's up, Geno?

393
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:57,666
- What in the fuck?

394
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,821
You let everybody in here for free?

395
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,988
(pulsing dance music)

396
00:29:31,714 --> 00:29:33,166
- Someone needs to lighten up.

397
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:33,999
- What?

398
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:37,014
- Someone needs to lighten up!

399
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:39,408
- I guess I just feel out of place.

400
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:41,670
- Did your boyfriend
leave you alone tonight?

401
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,043
- No, he's just a friend.

402
00:29:44,043 --> 00:29:44,876
- [Man In Green Shirt]
Well, let me introduce you

403
00:29:44,876 --> 00:29:46,959
to a good friend of mine.

404
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,191
- [John] What is it?

405
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:51,191
- Trail mix.

406
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,264
- [John] No thanks.

407
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:58,322
I don't need that to have a good time.

408
00:29:58,322 --> 00:29:59,322
- Let's see.

409
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,603
- Whoa.

410
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:04,227
Not so fast.

411
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:20,406
You know what, maybe
I'll just try one hit.

412
00:30:28,876 --> 00:30:30,459
How do you work it?

413
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:48,242
♫ You're only mine to have

414
00:30:48,242 --> 00:30:51,984
♫ And you hold me like a glass

415
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:55,269
♫ I'm only yours to have

416
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:58,269
♫ If you want me to

417
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:05,055
♫ Put your faith in me

418
00:31:06,682 --> 00:31:09,349
It hasn't, hasn't kicked in yet.

419
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:20,337
♫ Put your trust in me

420
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:24,504
♫ What will be, will be ♫

421
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,259
Let me try another one.

422
00:31:33,256 --> 00:31:36,756
(drumbeat music building)

423
00:31:48,553 --> 00:31:50,612
- Has it kicked in yet?

424
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:52,976
(laughing)

425
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:56,169
♫ One pill makes you larger

426
00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:00,557
♫ And one pill makes you small

427
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:05,051
♫ And the ones that mother gives you

428
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:08,933
♫ Don't do anything at all

429
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:11,516
♫ Go ask Alice

430
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,863
♫ When she's 10 feet tall

431
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:21,975
♫ And if you go chasing rabbits

432
00:32:21,975 --> 00:32:26,583
♫ And you know you're going to fall

433
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:30,578
♫ Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar

434
00:32:30,578 --> 00:32:33,828
♫ Has given you a call

435
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,537
♫ Call Alice

436
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:42,774
♫ When she was just small

437
00:32:42,774 --> 00:32:45,727
♫ When the men on the chessboard

438
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:50,055
♫ Get up and tell you where to go

439
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:54,102
♫ And you've just had
some kind of mushroom

440
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:58,666
♫ And your mind is moving, oh

441
00:32:58,666 --> 00:33:01,249
♫ Go ask Alice

442
00:33:02,693 --> 00:33:05,860
♫ I think she'll know

443
00:33:07,624 --> 00:33:11,841
♫ When logic and proportion

444
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:15,863
♫ Have fallen sloppy dead

445
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:20,022
♫ And the white knight
is talking backwards

446
00:33:20,022 --> 00:33:24,800
♫ And the Red Queen's off with her head

447
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,967
♫ Remember what the doormouse said ♫

448

(crickets chirping)

449
00:33:46,216 --> 00:33:47,966
- [John] That was um,

450
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,732
uh, wow. (laughing)

451
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:54,803
Can I have your number?

452
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:58,136
- Uh, I'm not ready to get serious, man.

453
00:33:59,101 --> 00:34:01,881
- A telephone number means serious?

454
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:04,213
- In this town it does.

455
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:05,796
But you were great.

456
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:10,009
- Too skinny for you, aren't I?

457
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,759
- [Man Getting Dressed] No. Well,

458
00:34:14,823 --> 00:34:17,421
look, I'm not gonna give
you the typical LA bullshit.

459
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:21,588
To be honest with you, I do
date bigger guys, bodybuilders.

460
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:24,239
No offense, Jim.

461
00:34:25,336 --> 00:34:26,886
- It's John.

462
00:34:26,886 --> 00:34:29,803
- (laughing) Oops.

463
00:34:33,302 --> 00:34:35,915
- [Hector] What are we wasting
our time for, I hate theatre.

464
00:34:35,915 --> 00:34:38,719
- [John] I'm just doing it as
a favor for my cousin, Tad.

465
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,969
He's filming a documentary.

466
00:34:45,158 --> 00:34:46,197
- [Hector] The way Bobby treated you,

467
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:50,177
I can't stand this guy,
he's so into himself.

468
00:34:50,177 --> 00:34:53,109
Been after my ass for years.

469
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:56,124
- So I'll show him he didn't
get under my skin, come on.

470
00:34:56,124 --> 00:34:57,465
- [Bobby] Well, when I studied law,

471
00:34:57,465 --> 00:35:00,865
it was my job to remind
people they were in trouble.

472
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,032
Now I uh, help 'em forget.

473
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:05,362
- [Tad] Yeah, well you
said you were closeted

474
00:35:05,362 --> 00:35:06,945
for like, 10 years.

475
00:35:08,328 --> 00:35:11,328
Why would you come out so radically?

476
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:16,708
- Found out I was HIV positive and um,

477
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:20,375
thought I had a limited
amount of time left.

478
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:26,490
- Alright, I mean I'll
buy that but like, what,

479
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:28,845
why would you go to the Circuit?

480
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:30,816
- It's a gay man's Superbowl.

481
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:33,149
It's tribal, it's fraternal.

482
00:35:34,614 --> 00:35:37,470
Circuit's been my family.

483
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,294
I'm proud to be a leader
of the Circuit community.

484
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:43,294
I've never felt so loved or so free.

485
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,912
Turn around if needles make you nervous.

486
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:55,536
- Oh, no fuckin' way.

487
00:35:57,443 --> 00:35:58,860
Why do you do it?

488
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,713
- Do it for my fans.

489
00:36:02,713 --> 00:36:05,130
Expect a certain image of me.

490
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,691
They pay good money and I
don't like to disappoint 'em.

491
00:36:09,691 --> 00:36:12,515
It's faster than Viagra, believe me.

492
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:15,297
- If I had a dollar for
every blowjob I've given,

493
00:36:15,297 --> 00:36:16,930
oh actually, I do have a dollar

494
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,620
for every blowjob I've given.

495
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,620
(audience laughing)

496
00:36:32,037 --> 00:36:33,803
- Are you filmin' the show?

497
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:37,560
- Uh, just the main act,
I'm doin' a documentary.

498
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,349
- [Woman] What is the main act?

499
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,101
I don't know, I was just
hired to do a little stand-up.

500
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:42,934
- Stand-up.

501
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:43,767
- Yeah.

502
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:44,600
- In this club?

503
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,222
You don't know what kinda
place this is, do you?

504
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:50,598
Hey, can I pan to you
occasionally during his routine?

505
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:53,003
I'm gonna be filming backstage.

506
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,300
- Sure, I'd love it.

507
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,133
- Cool, okay.

508
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:55,966
- See you out there.

509
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:56,799
- Okay.

510
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,710
- Thank you, you've been a great audience.

511
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,877
(audience applauding and cheering)

512
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,853
- Thank you, Linda Tripp.

513
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,159
I drove up here tonight in
my new car, it's incredible.

514
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,765
It's got it's electronics up the gazazz.

515
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:19,010
Amazing, I mean, it's got a radio,

516
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,082
you tell it what you wanna
hear, and the station comes on.

517
00:37:22,082 --> 00:37:24,720
I said country music and
Garth Brooks came on.

518
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,287
I said oldies and Smokey Robinson came on.

519
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,120
Then a woman cut me off.

520
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,396
I said you fucking rude bitch!

521
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:32,737
And Dr. Laura came on.

522
00:37:32,737 --> 00:37:36,904
(audience laughing and applauding)

523
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:43,430
Oh I see we're in the
right room. (laughing)

524
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,987
Well you're gonna love this
next act, unbelievable guy.

525
00:37:46,987 --> 00:37:49,235
He's amazing, he's brought his two

526
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:51,386
politically correct friends with him,

527
00:37:51,386 --> 00:37:54,366
to do a number that was cut
from Annie, Get Your Gun,

528
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:55,671
when Eric Rulen discovered that

529
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:57,690
you can get a man with a gun.

530
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,690
Here he is, Bobby Rocks!

531
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:03,148
(audience cheering)

532
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:06,481

00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:19,962

00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:24,053
♫ You say, you say, you
say that I'm the one thing

538
00:38:33,889 --> 00:38:37,889
♫ You say to everything you say

539
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,150
♫ And I promise you

540
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,257
♫ Before the night is through

00:38:47,257 --> 00:38:51,565
♫ I'll have you singin' songs

542
00:38:51,565 --> 00:38:55,643
♫ We'll be the morning chums

00:38:55,643 --> 00:38:59,728

♫ But are you ready for

545
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:07,142
♫ Assume the position

546
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,447
♫ Assume the position

547
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,119
♫ You say, you say, you say
you need a little somethin'

548
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,210
♫ You say, you say, you

00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:28,098
♫ Need a little somethin'

551
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:31,598
♫ Need a little somethin'

552
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,247
- That was bad.

553
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,238
- And maybe you're right here.

554
00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:43,238
(audience laughing)

555
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:48,913
(wolf whistling)

556
00:39:50,273 --> 00:39:52,759
(laughing)

557
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:53,592
Oh!

558
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,879
(laughing)

559
00:39:58,515 --> 00:40:00,015
- [Tad] Oh my God!

560
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,942
(audience cheering)

561
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:13,940
- Woohoo!

562
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:17,815
- [Stage Manager] Come on, you're on!

563
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:18,648
- [Woman] I have to follow that?

564
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:19,481
- Of course, Donna Pelvic, come on,

565
00:40:19,481 --> 00:40:21,280
they've had enough dick,
they're hungry for comedy.

566
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,397
Go out there, kill the people.

567
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:23,230
- [Women] My jokes!

568
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,419
- That's alright, do mime.

569
00:40:25,419 --> 00:40:28,815
(audience clapping)

570
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:30,065
- [Woman] Guys!

571
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:36,697
The grocery store doesn't
have a meat section that big.

572
00:40:36,697 --> 00:40:37,780
Hi, I'm Nina.

573
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:41,170
I'm your stand-up comic for the evening.

574
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,436
Perhaps you saw my name out on the poster,

575
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:45,183
the one that read, "Big
dick, and then Nina,"

576
00:40:45,183 --> 00:40:47,577
(audience laughing)

577
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:51,252
I have to tell you though,
after seein' that thing,

578
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:54,502
feel a little hurt, feel kinda lied to.

579
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,698
Makes me wanna go home and
just slap my boyfriend,

580
00:40:57,698 --> 00:41:01,365
just smack him, motion
of the ocean, my ass.

581
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:05,454
(audience laughing)

582
00:41:05,454 --> 00:41:06,547
You know, I used to go out with this guy.

583
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,709
He was like, "Yeah baby, I got 10 inches."

584
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:10,626
And he did.

585
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,902
In the drawer, next to his bed.

586
00:41:13,902 --> 00:41:16,902
(audience laughing)

587
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:22,745
Johnny?

588
00:41:22,745 --> 00:41:23,797
- Hey.

589
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:25,130
- [Nina] Johhny!

590
00:41:26,702 --> 00:41:29,952
I know you. (laughing)

591
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:32,371
I know him.

592
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:37,222
- Well.

593
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:38,873
- Come on, look at you.

594
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:39,905
- Why, do I look different?

595
00:41:39,905 --> 00:41:40,790
Changed a lot?

596
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,040
- No, you look,

597
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,474
exactly the same as in college.

598
00:41:45,474 --> 00:41:47,725
Except, maybe a little better.

599
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:49,975
- It's good to see you too.

600
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:52,710
Come on, I'll walk you to your car.

601
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,647
- No way, so that's fine,
I'm close, you don't have to.

602
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,383
- I'm walkin' you.

603
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:58,216
- Okay.

604
00:42:00,528 --> 00:42:02,278
This is so wonderful.

605
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:06,215
You make me feel like home again.

606
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:07,336
- You know we should, I wish we could have

607
00:42:07,336 --> 00:42:08,419
some coffee or something.

608
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:11,352
I got here with a friend, Hector.

609
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:13,240
- A boyfriend, Johnny?

610
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,389
- John, come on.

611
00:42:15,389 --> 00:42:16,472
- [John] I'll be right there.

612
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:18,371
- [Nina] An impatient boyfriend?

613
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:19,872
- No, he's just a friend.

614
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:21,068
- Okay, well thank you.

615
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:21,954
- Okay.

616
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:22,871
- I'm here.

617
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,596
And we'll see each other.

618
00:42:26,596 --> 00:42:27,929
- Wait a minute.

619
00:42:29,753 --> 00:42:31,806
Do you need a place to stay?

620
00:42:31,806 --> 00:42:32,723
- What? No!

621
00:42:34,957 --> 00:42:36,501
Of course not.

622
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:39,882
Oh the cat, I bring the cat
with me to all of my shows.

623
00:42:39,882 --> 00:42:41,645
She's a good luck charm.

624
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:44,478
- Then what about all the clothes?

625
00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:50,769
- I'm goin' to the dry cleaners?

626
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:54,502
- You can stay with me as
long as you want, okay?

627
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:56,570
- What gave me away, the cat?

628
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,320
- No, the litter box.

629
00:42:59,591 --> 00:43:01,841
(laughing)

630
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:06,132
The cat'll have to stay
indoors, I'll explain later.

631
00:43:06,132 --> 00:43:06,965
- Okay.

632
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:09,639
(pager beeping)

633
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,070
Thank you for helping, Hector,
it's really sweet of you.

634
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,619
- This is the last one.

635
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:17,090
Listen, my pager just went
off, can I use your phone?

636
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,173
- Yeah, it's right there.

637
00:43:21,547 --> 00:43:23,746
- Who pages someone at
11:15 on a Sunday night,

638
00:43:23,746 --> 00:43:25,303
what is he, a doctor?

639
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,053
- No, he's a hustler.

640
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:30,185
- That was my second guess.

641
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:33,401
Guy just stares right through me,

642
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:35,441
it makes my fell like Claude Rains.

643
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:37,507
- [John] Hey, don't worry about it.

644
00:43:37,507 --> 00:43:39,676
Just be friendly to him.

645
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:41,506
- Oh I get it, Hector's
like tofu, he just kind of

646
00:43:41,506 --> 00:43:44,705
adapts to whatever flavor is nearby.

647
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,538
- Exactly.

648
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:59,453
- Granted, you could serve a three-course,

649
00:43:59,453 --> 00:44:01,409
sit-down meal on his chest.

650
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:04,024
Aside from that, what do you see in him?

651
00:44:04,024 --> 00:44:05,121
- Haven't you ever loved somebody that

652
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,538
no one else could understand?

653
00:44:08,618 --> 00:44:09,451
- Yeah.

654
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:11,350
My Mom.

655
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:13,936
- You must be a comedienne.

656
00:44:13,936 --> 00:44:17,550
(laughing sarcastically)

657
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,883
(brushing teeth noises)

658
00:44:31,855 --> 00:44:34,605
(birds chirping)

659
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:53,722
These babies are thirsty.

660
00:45:13,638 --> 00:45:16,138
(cat meowing)

661
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:34,673
- [Doctor] Your test results are in.

662
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:37,271
These new drugs are really promising.

663
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:39,404
Your viral log, is undetectable.

664
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:43,571
You could be around for a
really long time, Bobby.

665
00:45:49,255 --> 00:45:50,714
- You can get this in Mexico.

666
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:53,297
You bake it at 375, 20 minutes.

667
00:45:58,028 --> 00:46:00,628
You see, I made peace with
the prospect of dying,

668
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:04,361
I decided to fulfill every
fantasy that ever I had.

669
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,778
Holy man, I have.

670
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:10,265
I decided to live for today,
the videos, the shows,

671
00:46:10,265 --> 00:46:12,870
the pictures, that's
why I started dancing.

672
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,914
- [Tad] You call what you do, dancing?

673
00:46:14,914 --> 00:46:18,031
- [Bobby] Absolutely, dancing
with everyone in the audience.

674
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:20,780
Making love to a hundred men at a time.

675
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:22,505
And for all the ones I miss,

676
00:46:22,505 --> 00:46:24,589
I have my own line of greeting cards

677
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:26,690
and refrigerator magnets.

678
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,207
Selling yourself to the
media is an art form, really.

679
00:46:29,207 --> 00:46:31,874
(timer ringing)

680
00:46:33,103 --> 00:46:37,177
Yes, now that's a perfect
batch of Special K.

681
00:46:37,177 --> 00:46:38,756
- [Tad] What are you
gonna do with that, Bobby?

682
00:46:38,756 --> 00:46:42,021
- (laughing) I'm gonna sell
it, and I'm gonna snort it

683
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:45,074
and we're gonna party all night, baby!

684
00:46:45,074 --> 00:46:46,741
Let's rock and roll!

685
00:46:51,087 --> 00:46:53,004
- Pretty powerful, huh?

686
00:47:07,943 --> 00:47:09,857
Why would he just walk out on me?

687
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:11,881
- Maybe he doesn't like Special K.

688
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:13,326
That shit doesn't mix with alcohol.

689
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:14,909
- Are you for real?

690
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:19,011
You left me for this guy?

691
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:22,622
- Hey, you can't insult
me with your negativity.

692
00:47:22,622 --> 00:47:24,736
I don't give you the power.

693
00:47:24,736 --> 00:47:25,883
- [Tad] Julian, you know
him better than I do,

694
00:47:25,883 --> 00:47:27,872
can you at least talk to him?

695
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:30,539
I need like, 10 grand to finish.

696
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,493
Thanks.

697
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:51,577
- [Gil] What steps have you taken

698
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,309
to see if that work's secure?

699
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,094
- From what, from you?

700
00:47:56,094 --> 00:47:57,844
Philosopher gardener?

701
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,725

♫ Now I'm lookin' in your eyes

716
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:08,982
♫ I know that things have changed

717
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:11,358
♫ 'Cause all my gloves are down

718
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,441
♫ And I have no fear of the pain

719
00:49:16,335 --> 00:49:20,502
♫ I'm better since you came ♫

720
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:27,215
- That was the risk you took,
there were no guarantees.

721
00:49:27,215 --> 00:49:28,132
- Sit down.

722
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,210
Now, no one's happier than I am that

723
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,592
you've been given a second chance.

724
00:49:36,592 --> 00:49:38,380
But I bought your life insurance policy

725
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,559
because you said you were gonna die.

726
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,000
- I needed the money.

727
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,080
- You needed the money.

728
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,352
I wanted a nice return on my investment.

729
00:49:47,352 --> 00:49:50,040
I think, under the circumstances,
you owe me a refund.

730
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,426
- (scoffing) A refund?

731
00:49:53,426 --> 00:49:55,663
- I put up my own blood.

732
00:49:55,663 --> 00:49:57,580
At great personal risk.

733
00:49:59,695 --> 00:50:03,862
I paid all the premiums on
life and on health, hmm?

734
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:08,487
You had insurance.

735
00:50:10,071 --> 00:50:10,988
You had um,

736
00:50:12,341 --> 00:50:13,174
cash.

737
00:50:15,081 --> 00:50:18,581
You could do whatever the fuck you wanted.

738
00:50:19,911 --> 00:50:21,925
- Look, a deal's a deal, I'm sorry,

739
00:50:21,925 --> 00:50:24,008
you gambled and you lost.

740
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:30,442
I don't even have the money
to give you if I wanted to.

741
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,434
(pages flipping)

742
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:54,523
- [Hector] I thought
this wasn't your scene.

743
00:50:54,523 --> 00:50:57,465
- Well, maybe my scene is changing.

744
00:50:57,465 --> 00:51:01,901
I mean, everybody seems
so big in this town.

745
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:04,306
- [Hector] You think you're ready.

746
00:51:04,306 --> 00:51:05,806
Let's go upstairs.

747
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,199
(laughing)

748
00:51:23,362 --> 00:51:27,595
- You know, you know
what I don't know, papi.

749
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:30,767
- You're only young a
beautiful once, baby.

750
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:33,600
Just a few golden years.

751
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,350
With a little more size,

752
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:39,683
you are gonna be a star out there, John.

753
00:51:40,649 --> 00:51:41,482
So hot.

754
00:51:45,815 --> 00:51:47,982
Know what that feels like?

755
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,540
Everyone wanting you.

756
00:51:52,807 --> 00:51:54,890
God, I love that feeling.

757
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:58,775
So nobody will ever mess
with you again, okay?

758
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:00,678
These are pharmaceutical.

759
00:52:00,678 --> 00:52:02,261
They're very clean.

760
00:52:03,387 --> 00:52:04,220
Like gold.

761
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,143
Lay down.

762
00:52:09,364 --> 00:52:12,032
- Okay, I'm gonna try one cycle only,

763
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:13,527
just to put on a little size.

764
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:15,388
- [Hector] Yeah, right.

765
00:52:15,388 --> 00:52:16,471
Don't be shy.

766
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:22,823
Alright, I want you to breathe in.

767
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:25,570
You're gonna feel a tiny prick.

768
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,277
You know how we hate those, baby.

769
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,527
(laughing)

770
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,107
- God that hurts.

771
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:47,860
What's with the face?

772
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:52,881
- Seein' if my implants are moving.

773
00:52:56,529 --> 00:52:58,967
Look like a Picasso.

774
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,967
You are gonna be so beautiful, John.

775
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,914
I may end up breaking my rule.

776
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:12,446
- What rule is that?

777
00:53:16,747 --> 00:53:17,664
- Oh, baby.

778
00:53:18,712 --> 00:53:21,521
We've gotta upgrade your image.

779
00:53:21,521 --> 00:53:24,688
(upbeat, funky music)

780
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:24,359
- [Tad] Come on, let me just
get some pictures of you--

781
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:26,343
- Hey, just cut it out, I don't
wanna be interviewed, okay?

782
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,271
- Come on, I just wanna shoot you walking,

783
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:29,104
I just wanna shoot you walking.

784
00:54:29,104 --> 00:54:30,007
- [Hector] Tad, I don't
wanna be interviewed.

785
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:34,232
- I know, let me just ask you
one personal question on tape.

786
00:54:34,232 --> 00:54:35,776
- No.

787
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,252
- [Tad] Alright, good.

788
00:54:38,252 --> 00:54:40,768
You're pretty open about
your career, right?

789
00:54:40,768 --> 00:54:43,230
Do hustlers ever fall
in love with their John?

790
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,243
- Is that thing on?

791
00:54:44,243 --> 00:54:48,012
- [Tad] Can a hustler
really fall in love at all?

792
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:49,630
Are you desensitized?

793
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:50,823
Hey, do you have a crush on John?

794
00:54:50,823 --> 00:54:52,184
- What the fuck you prick.

795
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:53,517
- Come on, what?

796
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,723
- [Nina] John was just this
plain, skinny guy, unassuming.

797
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:00,640
Who wanted to be a cop.

798
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:06,092
He was not just nice, he was kind.

799
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,503
He treasured me.

800
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:15,038
And it killed him to
tell me that he was gay.

801
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:17,705
Because he didn't wanna hurt me.

802
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:21,095
And I've not found that
again with another man.

803
00:55:21,095 --> 00:55:23,345
(knocking)

804
00:55:32,439 --> 00:55:34,476
- Oh, it's you.

805
00:55:34,476 --> 00:55:37,476
- [Nina] Hey, Hector, you know what?

806
00:55:38,328 --> 00:55:40,239
I'm Nina, I'm the person standing

807
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,315
right in front of you,
who's talking to you.

808
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:44,767
Cool, huh?

809
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:45,829
- Well is John here?

810
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:46,662
- No.

811
00:55:47,673 --> 00:55:49,015
But you can come in and wait if you like--

812
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:49,848
- Thanks.

813
00:55:51,102 --> 00:55:53,519
- Cooking, you can have some.

814
00:55:56,256 --> 00:55:57,603
(knocking)

815
00:55:57,603 --> 00:55:59,103
'Scuse me, Hector?

816
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:04,178
Why don't you come out
here and keep me company?

817
00:56:04,178 --> 00:56:06,725
Look, I don't care what you're doing,

818
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:07,975
I really don't.

819
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:12,885
Besides, Johnny tells me everything.

820
00:56:12,885 --> 00:56:15,792
And I'm not one to judge.

821
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:18,194
What the hell are those?

822
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:20,169
- [Hector] Steroids.

823
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,316
- Are those safe?

824
00:56:22,316 --> 00:56:23,357
I mean, you always hear about how

825
00:56:23,357 --> 00:56:27,113
they're messing with your personality.

826
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:29,651
- Well I've been using 'em
on and off for six years.

827
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,068
I'm no different.

828
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:35,088
- So you've always been this funny.

829
00:56:35,088 --> 00:56:37,338
(laughing)

830
00:56:41,716 --> 00:56:43,716
Can I ask you something?

831
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,319
Are you jealous of me?

832
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:52,338
Because my relationship with
John was over years ago.

833
00:56:53,304 --> 00:56:55,304
Well that and, he's gay.

834
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,039
- If John tells you anything,

835
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,645
he probably told you
that I don't like women.

836
00:57:00,645 --> 00:57:01,645
Or ugly men.

837
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,890
It's nothing personal.

838
00:57:10,813 --> 00:57:13,564
- [John] Hey sweetie, hey you look cute.

839
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:15,931
- [Nina] You know, hot date.

840
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:17,594
- Has he been waiting long?

841
00:57:17,594 --> 00:57:19,571
- [Nina] Oh, he's on pins and needles.

842
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:20,904
Needles, mostly.

843
00:57:27,399 --> 00:57:30,732
- Johnny, let me introduce you to Carol.

844
00:57:31,825 --> 00:57:33,341
- I'm a little hopped-up.

845
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:35,841
- [Hector] Oh, it's the juice.

846
00:57:36,872 --> 00:57:38,970
Here, take a Xanax.

847
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,765
You can coast until we get to the club.

848
00:57:41,765 --> 00:57:42,682
- Now what?

849
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:46,051
- Is the door locked?

850
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:50,418
- [John] Yeah, she won't come in.

851
00:57:50,418 --> 00:57:51,251
- Good.

852
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:57,565
Because nobody can know about this.

853
00:57:57,565 --> 00:58:02,205
- Wait, hey, shit, caught
me, I don't do heavy drugs.

854
00:58:02,205 --> 00:58:03,668
Okay, I really don't.

855
00:58:03,668 --> 00:58:06,001
This is just too much, okay?

856
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:08,896
I'm an ex-cop for Christ's sakes.

857
00:58:08,896 --> 00:58:10,563
- Would you shut up?

858
00:58:11,874 --> 00:58:13,870
It's not heroin.

859
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,703
You little bitch. (chuckling)

860
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,162
- What is it, makeup?

861
00:58:21,162 --> 00:58:22,043
- [Hector] No no no, these are the

862
00:58:22,043 --> 00:58:24,460
best cosmetics money can buy.

863
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,543
I have a friend who worked for Cher.

864
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:30,609
- Anyway, blah blah blah.

865
00:58:30,609 --> 00:58:32,755
Enough about me.

866
00:58:32,755 --> 00:58:34,816
How long have you been a lawyer, Andy?

867
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:36,697
- Well, for three--

868
00:58:36,697 --> 00:58:38,947
(laughing)

869
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,913
- Guys, I would like you to
meet my date, Andy French.

870
00:58:48,913 --> 00:58:50,211
- Hi, nice to meet you.

871
00:58:50,211 --> 00:58:51,879
- [Andy] Hello.

872
00:58:51,879 --> 00:58:53,269
- [Nina] This is my roommate, John.

873
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:54,519
And his friend.

874
00:58:55,685 --> 00:58:57,441
- Nice to meet you.

875
00:58:57,441 --> 00:59:00,705
- And they're on their
way to a um, bar mitzvah.

876
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:02,411
(laughing)

877
00:59:02,411 --> 00:59:05,319
Actually no, they're gonna be in the

878
00:59:05,319 --> 00:59:08,443
community production of CATS?

879
00:59:08,443 --> 00:59:12,610
- Actually, Andy French,
we're going to the Probe.

880
00:59:13,812 --> 00:59:17,218
- Oh, well, nice to meet you gentlemen.

881
00:59:17,218 --> 00:59:19,234
- Yes, nice to meet you too, Andy.

882
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:20,762
Hey take good care of her, okay?

883
00:59:20,762 --> 00:59:22,070
- [Andy] Oh yeah.

884
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,903
- See you later, Nina.

885
00:59:25,034 --> 00:59:26,951
- What's um, the Probe?

886
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,975
(thumping music)

887
00:59:41,997 --> 00:59:42,830
- Okay.

888
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:01,534
Fuck.

889
01:00:03,236 --> 01:00:04,191
Shit.

890
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:06,123
Fuckin' can't.

891
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:08,373
(groaning)

892
01:00:10,686 --> 01:00:14,519
(crowd cheering and clapping)

893
01:00:19,888 --> 01:00:24,055
(crowd chanting) Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

894
01:00:41,614 --> 01:00:43,781
Okay, let's rock and roll!

895
01:00:46,763 --> 01:00:47,830
Fuck.

896
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,663
(yelling in pain)

897
01:00:52,137 --> 01:00:53,470
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

898
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:58,052
Fuck!

899
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,816
- [Woman] A little
hypocritical, don't you think?

900
01:01:13,816 --> 01:01:16,196
- What are you getting at, Louise?

901
01:01:16,196 --> 01:01:20,109
- You sell the drugs,
which compromise judgement,

902
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,812
which causes the unprotected sex,

903
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:26,663
that contributes to AIDS
in these younger kids.

904
01:01:26,663 --> 01:01:29,368
- We give them the condoms, don't we?

905
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:32,368
- They throw the condoms away, Geno.

906
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,193
(water trickling)

907
01:01:41,928 --> 01:01:44,845
(light, fun music)

908
01:01:59,876 --> 01:02:03,660
- [Tad] How'd you feel when
you heard about the HIV, Bobby?

909
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,660
- Like shit.

910
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:09,446
Year that followed I
maxed out my credit cards.

911
01:02:09,446 --> 01:02:11,946
I started writing my own will.

912
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,564
I declared bankruptcy.

913
01:02:16,773 --> 01:02:20,089
Started planning my own funeral.

914
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:21,479
But now I'm not goin' anywhere,

915
01:02:21,479 --> 01:02:24,307
so I wanna start over again.

916
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,807
Get outta the sex scene, quit doin' drugs.

917
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,999
Maybe even, go back to school.

918
01:02:34,394 --> 01:02:36,061
Oh, this is perfect.

919
01:02:36,984 --> 01:02:39,938
This is perfect, I wanna
wear this at a White Party,

920
01:02:39,938 --> 01:02:42,473
What do you think, Tad, huh?

921
01:02:42,473 --> 01:02:44,306
Yeah, this is perfect.

922
01:02:45,869 --> 01:02:47,202
This is perfect.

923
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:59,629
- What a rich character.

924
01:03:03,908 --> 01:03:07,874
I want to apologize for
my behavior from before.

925
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:09,982
I've just been so damn frustrated

926
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:12,834
by this horrible plague, you know?

927
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:15,917
Lost so many of my wonderful friends.

928
01:03:18,361 --> 01:03:21,944
I'd be happy to advance
you the five grand.

929
01:03:22,998 --> 01:03:25,018
In fact, I wanna see
every piece of footage

930
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:27,685
that you shoot from here on out.

931
01:03:28,631 --> 01:03:31,464
His story is, terribly compelling.

932
01:03:42,849 --> 01:03:45,016
- [Tad] I have great news!

933
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,451
- We have to talk.

934
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:50,869
- [Tad] Okay, okay, well let me go first.

935
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,209
- That's what I wanna tell you.

936
01:03:53,209 --> 01:03:54,626
I want you to go.

937
01:03:58,244 --> 01:03:59,539
- What?

938
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:02,434
- I want you guys to move.

939
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:04,184
I want my house back.

940
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:07,512
- We can't afford to live
like this on our own!

941
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:10,990
- Well then tell that to Stevie Wonder.

942
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,701
- Can I at least finish my film?

943
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:17,264
- Tad, you've been working on
a documentary for two years.

944
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:18,287
- I know, but now I almost have

945
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:19,797
all the money I need to finish it!

946
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:23,868
- Great, then I know
you have first and last.

947
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:25,717
- Can we at least wait
'til after the White Party,

948
01:04:25,717 --> 01:04:28,023
he makes a fortune on that weekend.

949
01:04:28,023 --> 01:04:29,512
Look, I'm not asking
you as a friend, okay,

950
01:04:29,512 --> 01:04:33,679
I'm asking you as an artist,
I gotta finish my project.

951
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,898
(sighing)

952
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:44,420
(groaning)

953
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:49,636
- [Hector] Yo Geno,

954
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:55,163
I need to talk to you about a loan.

955
01:04:55,163 --> 01:04:58,099
- [Geno] The fuck am I,
the Bank of West Hollywood?

956
01:04:58,099 --> 01:04:59,688
Why are you limping?

957
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,771
- [Hector] Calf implants.

958
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,350
Geno, I need another operation.

959
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:12,468
- What is it this time, a
penile implant? (laughing)

960
01:05:12,468 --> 01:05:16,017
- (laughing) We can't all be
as naturally hung as Bobby.

961
01:05:16,017 --> 01:05:18,050
- [Geno] How well do you know Bobby?

962
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,495
- [Hector] He's always been after my ass.

963
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:23,048
Even wants me to perform with him.

964
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:25,381
With or without an audience.

965
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:29,060
- [Geno] You ever have sex with him?

966
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,569
- [Hector] No.

967
01:05:30,569 --> 01:05:33,425
I don't have sex for free.

968
01:05:33,425 --> 01:05:36,425
- I'll pay you to have sex with him.

969
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:41,197
- Why, you wanna watch?

970
01:05:41,197 --> 01:05:43,530
I thought you were straight.

971
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:51,443
- I'll front you the
money under one condition.

972
01:05:51,443 --> 01:05:54,670
You have sex with him at the White Party.

973
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:56,920
Sometime over that weekend.

974
01:05:58,662 --> 01:06:01,079
You let me supply the treats.

975
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:15,335
- [Nina] You seem kinda
different than his other friends.

976
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:18,235
- You've been friends with
John for a long time, right?

977
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:19,068
- Yep.

978
01:06:20,649 --> 01:06:22,931
- Then I guess you know he's in trouble.

979
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:23,764
- Yeah.

980
01:06:25,473 --> 01:06:27,255
Never looked better.

981
01:06:27,255 --> 01:06:29,255
Or seemed more unstable.

982
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:35,862
(upbeat dance music)

983
01:06:42,213 --> 01:06:43,384
- Haven't I already done you?

984
01:06:43,384 --> 01:06:45,742
- Uh-huh, three times Johnny,
but you're the most action

985
01:06:45,742 --> 01:06:48,232
this old girl's gonna get tonight.

986
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:49,459
- Get outta here.

987
01:06:49,459 --> 01:06:52,105
- Oh please, just frisk me
one more time, I'm so close.

988
01:06:52,105 --> 01:06:54,105
- [Johnny] Next in line!

989
01:06:55,971 --> 01:06:58,138
Wait wait wait, come here.

990
01:07:00,294 --> 01:07:01,127
'Scuse me.

991
01:07:02,454 --> 01:07:04,775
You know we don't allow drugs here.

992
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:07,365
- Oh come on, give me a break.

993
01:07:07,365 --> 01:07:10,198
You know what kinda party this is.

994
01:07:15,215 --> 01:07:16,882
- Very sexy, though.

995
01:07:19,058 --> 01:07:22,141
(upbeat dance music)

996
01:07:29,623 --> 01:07:30,985
- It's Miller Time.

997
01:07:30,985 --> 01:07:33,235
(laughing)

998
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:45,167
(toilet flushing)

999
01:07:49,928 --> 01:07:51,011
- Caught you.

1000
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:55,754
- Would you believe um, allergy medicine?

1001
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,500
- We've um, met

1002
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:01,267
before, you know.

1003
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,453
Yeah.

1004
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,083
You're Johnny Webster, from Illinois.

1005
01:08:08,938 --> 01:08:11,438
You don't remember me, do you?

1006
01:08:17,115 --> 01:08:17,948
Remember?

1007
01:08:19,403 --> 01:08:23,570
You caught me with my pants
down in an alley one night.

1008
01:08:25,616 --> 01:08:26,605
- That wasn't me.

1009
01:08:26,605 --> 01:08:30,945
- You let me off, but I never
got the chance to thank you.

1010
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:31,875
For that.

1011
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:35,802
- I'm tellin' you it wasn't me, okay, so.

1012
01:08:35,802 --> 01:08:38,476
You should get outta here, huh?

1013
01:08:38,476 --> 01:08:39,675
- Yes it was you.

1014
01:08:39,675 --> 01:08:41,842
- Get the fuck outta here!

1015
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:16,229
(birds chirping)

1016
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:21,783
- You didn't come home again last night.

1017
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,917
- [John] I was at a party.

1018
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:24,779
- Hey, John!

1019
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:26,297
- [John] Hey!

1020
01:09:26,297 --> 01:09:28,895
- Lately it seems like
you're always at a party.

1021
01:09:28,895 --> 01:09:31,340
Maybe you should take some down time.

1022
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,288
- Johnny boy, yo, how's it goin'?

1023
01:09:34,288 --> 01:09:36,288
- [John] Good, man, you?

1024
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:40,075
- My man!

1025
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,359
- [John] Ah, forever!

1026
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,442
- Great party last night.

1027
01:09:47,685 --> 01:09:50,095
- You know there's some
really good movies out lately,

1028
01:09:50,095 --> 01:09:51,523
I was thinkin' that maybe we could go--

1029
01:09:51,523 --> 01:09:54,055
- Hey, bud, what you know?

1030
01:09:54,055 --> 01:09:55,979
- [John] Not much, boss, the same.

1031
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:59,432
- Okay, how do you know so many people?

1032
01:09:59,432 --> 01:10:01,222
- They're Circuit boys.

1033
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:04,302
- [Nina] So what does that make you?

1034
01:10:04,302 --> 01:10:05,548
- I guess one of 'em.

1035
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:06,705
- [Nina] No no.

1036
01:10:06,705 --> 01:10:09,698
You are so much more than a circus boy.

1037
01:10:09,698 --> 01:10:10,837
- Circuit boy.

1038
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:12,657
- [Nina] Whatever.

1039
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:14,896
You're a peace officer.

1040
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:16,336
You graduated with honors, you have

1041
01:10:16,336 --> 01:10:18,522
skills that can save lives.

1042
01:10:18,522 --> 01:10:22,689
And thus far, have been one
of the great loves of my life.

1043
01:10:25,724 --> 01:10:27,307
I can give that up.

1044
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:30,289
I can support you.

1045
01:10:30,289 --> 01:10:31,836
Living your life whatever
way you wanna live it,

1046
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:34,279
but not this, not the circus.

1047
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:35,112
- Circuit.

1048
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:37,846
- Circus.

1049
01:10:37,846 --> 01:10:40,189
- Um, I remember going to
my very first Circuit party

1050
01:10:40,189 --> 01:10:43,107
in Atlanta, called Hotlanta.

1051
01:10:43,107 --> 01:10:47,880
And I remember being in
this sea of gorgeous men.

1052
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:51,738
And out of the corner of my
eye, I spotted my shrink.

1053
01:10:51,738 --> 01:10:53,071
Doing Special K.

1054
01:10:54,204 --> 01:10:55,807
How do you go back to your shrink

1055
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,640
after you've seen him in a K hole?

1056
01:11:01,467 --> 01:11:02,550
- [Tad] Okay.

1057
01:11:06,835 --> 01:11:09,030
Okay, so, just act natural.

1058
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,124
- Okay.

1059
01:11:10,124 --> 01:11:13,032
- [Tad] Ask you questions.

1060
01:11:13,032 --> 01:11:14,762
About the Circuit, okay?

1061
01:11:14,762 --> 01:11:15,845
- Yeah, okay.

1062
01:11:17,463 --> 01:11:18,630
Wait a minute.

1063
01:11:20,691 --> 01:11:21,524
Cool?

1064
01:11:22,414 --> 01:11:23,247
Okay.

1065
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,482
- So, John, what's the biggest difference

1066
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:29,565
between back home and LA?

1067
01:11:30,432 --> 01:11:31,515
- [John] Wow.

1068
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:36,458
I mean, it's like, it's like um.

1069
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:42,872
It's like LA. (laughing)

1070
01:11:44,693 --> 01:11:47,860
It's the, so it's like the guys, as a,

1071
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:53,440
what are those jokes
real quick, so funny uh.

1072
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,120
And the music, you know?

1073
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:06,075
(incoherent mumbling)

1074
01:12:06,075 --> 01:12:07,908
The gyms, you know uh,

1075
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,820
everybody's always workin'
out, and fuckin' ripped

1076
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:16,070
(mumbling)

1077
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:24,206
What?

1078
01:12:26,334 --> 01:12:29,478
(laughing) What did you ask me?

1079
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:30,311
- [Tad] John, it's one o'clock

1080
01:12:30,311 --> 01:12:32,271
in the afternoon, are you high?

1081
01:12:32,271 --> 01:12:33,104
- No!

1082
01:12:36,196 --> 01:12:38,298
Oh well yeah, I had a little bump.

1083
01:12:38,298 --> 01:12:41,798
(laughing) It's strong K.

1084
01:12:44,132 --> 01:12:45,203
- [Tad] John, it's okay to party, man,

1085
01:12:45,203 --> 01:12:46,824
but you gotta learn to deal
with this stuff in small doses--

1086
01:12:46,824 --> 01:12:50,768
- I've worked my fuckin'
ass off my whole life, okay?

1087
01:12:50,768 --> 01:12:53,721
This is my time, this
is my summer vacation.

1088
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:56,796
I just wanna have a little
fun, is that so wrong?

1089
01:12:56,796 --> 01:12:59,030
- [Tad] No, but that
shit is dangerous, okay?

1090
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:00,540
Look, I at least know how to handle it.

1091
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:01,457
- Fuck you!

1092
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:06,002
Yeah you handled it real well!

1093
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:09,002
Cost you your relationship with Gil.

1094
01:13:10,257 --> 01:13:12,353
- I think John was clearly not ready

1095
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:15,114
for what he was gonna face in LA,

1096
01:13:15,114 --> 01:13:19,125
and he came with a small town,
this is fuckin' ridiculous.

1097
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:22,208
(upbeat dance music)

1098
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,757
- Where are you going?

1099
01:14:00,757 --> 01:14:02,939
- Green Party, goodnight.

1100
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:04,414
- You're not driving, are you?

1101
01:14:04,414 --> 01:14:05,247
- Sure.

1102
01:14:15,143 --> 01:14:17,393
(knocking)

1103
01:14:26,589 --> 01:14:27,997
- Come in.

1104
01:14:27,997 --> 01:14:29,330
Do a rat's tail.

1105
01:14:37,158 --> 01:14:37,991
- Hey.

1106
01:14:39,228 --> 01:14:40,645
Did you do these?

1107
01:14:42,606 --> 01:14:44,600
- In another life.

1108
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,433
- These are beautiful.

1109
01:14:47,803 --> 01:14:49,586
Why'd you give it up?

1110
01:14:49,586 --> 01:14:52,445
- Every client I had wanted to fuck me.

1111
01:14:52,445 --> 01:14:56,667
That way I still charge,
but I save on film.

1112
01:14:56,667 --> 01:15:00,334
Come over here, lemme
introduce you to Tina.

1113
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,959
- Thank you, sir.

1114
01:16:07,847 --> 01:16:09,476
- Nothin'.

1115
01:16:09,476 --> 01:16:13,059
(fast-paced, upbeat music)

1116
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:35,888
- I'm still flyin', I'm
not ready to go home yet.

1117
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:37,055
How you doin'?

1118
01:16:40,144 --> 01:16:42,681
(laughing)

1119
01:16:42,681 --> 01:16:45,598
- Oh God, I feel so good right now.

1120
01:16:51,622 --> 01:16:52,455
Hey.

1121
01:16:59,193 --> 01:17:01,943
(swelling music)

1122
01:17:20,972 --> 01:17:24,142
(pager beeping)

1123
01:17:24,142 --> 01:17:26,512
- Oh it's just my favorite hotel.

1124
01:17:26,512 --> 01:17:29,522
My best customer's in town.

1125
01:17:29,522 --> 01:17:32,272
He likes to watch another couple.

1126
01:17:33,945 --> 01:17:34,945
You into it?

1127
01:17:37,162 --> 01:17:40,495
- Uh, it's kinda late, I'm pretty tired.

1128
01:17:42,286 --> 01:17:45,119
- Alright, I'll call someone else.

1129
01:17:47,422 --> 01:17:49,224
- What's he look like?

1130
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:50,443
- You won't see him.

1131
01:17:50,443 --> 01:17:52,526
I've never even seen him.

1132
01:17:54,217 --> 01:17:55,717
But it's 500 each.

1133
01:17:57,032 --> 01:17:58,615
To make love to me.

1134
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:01,589
- I don't know, man.

1135
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:04,420
Alright.

1136
01:18:06,171 --> 01:18:08,983
- Listen, you don't mind if I call.

1137
01:18:08,983 --> 01:18:11,267
Only be like an hour.

1138
01:18:11,267 --> 01:18:13,877
Then you can pick me up later.

1139
01:18:13,877 --> 01:18:14,960
- Gimme that.

1140
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,273
Let's go.

1141
01:18:25,051 --> 01:18:26,669
- [Hector] Alright, it's
a suite, we're gonna

1142
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:29,108
go into the bedroom and
take our clothes off.

1143
01:18:29,108 --> 01:18:29,944
He'll be in the bathroom.

1144
01:18:29,944 --> 01:18:33,491
Don't say anything, and don't look at him.

1145
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:35,574
He likes me to be on top.

1146
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,274
- [John] Yeah, right, bastard.

1147
01:18:39,274 --> 01:18:41,089
What makes you think I can be a bottom?

1148
01:18:41,089 --> 01:18:42,710
(laughing)

1149
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:44,185
- [Hector] Just a hunch.

1150
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:45,764
Listen, remind me to lead, when it's over,

1151
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:47,248
we'll get dressed, we'll
get our clothes on,

1152
01:18:47,248 --> 01:18:49,831
we'll get the fuck out of here.

1153
01:18:51,797 --> 01:18:55,964
Listen, babe, don't worry,
I'll take care of you, alright?

1154
01:19:05,496 --> 01:19:08,829
(fast-paced drum music)

1155
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:57,434
It's okay, baby.

1156
01:21:00,411 --> 01:21:01,244
It's okay.

1157
01:21:06,119 --> 01:21:07,614
It's okay, John.

1158
01:21:07,614 --> 01:21:08,531
Just relax.

1159
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:13,280
Oh yeah.

1160
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:18,427
(fast-paced drum music)

1161
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,507
What's wrong?

1162
01:22:20,507 --> 01:22:22,287
- Nothin', nothin'.

1163
01:22:22,287 --> 01:22:24,417
This is, thanks.

1164
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:25,584
This is great.

1165
01:22:27,407 --> 01:22:28,437
- You sure you're okay?

1166
01:22:28,437 --> 01:22:29,937
- Yeah, of course.

1167
01:22:31,247 --> 01:22:36,057
I mean, it was fun, it was,
it was a lot of fun, right?

1168
01:22:36,057 --> 01:22:36,890
- Alright.

1169
01:22:38,207 --> 01:22:42,397
I mean, we finally made it together, baby.

1170
01:22:42,397 --> 01:22:44,147
You are so hot, John.

1171
01:22:47,097 --> 01:22:48,475
You wanna go to an after-hours?

1172
01:22:48,475 --> 01:22:50,537
- Ah, no thanks, man, I just,

1173
01:22:50,537 --> 01:22:53,047
I just got this splitting headache,

1174
01:22:53,047 --> 01:22:56,537
so I think I'm just gonna head home.

1175
01:22:56,537 --> 01:22:57,370
- You wanna come in?

1176
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:59,620
You won't be able to sleep.

1177
01:23:03,077 --> 01:23:06,577
- You actually like doing this, don't you?

1178
01:23:08,301 --> 01:23:10,500
This is like, the only
way you can get off.

1179
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:12,124
- I don't do anything I don't wanna do,

1180
01:23:12,124 --> 01:23:14,374
I'm not ashamed of my life.

1181
01:23:29,231 --> 01:23:32,731
(fast-paced techno music)

1182
01:23:34,598 --> 01:23:36,765
(yelling)

1183
01:23:47,023 --> 01:23:48,187
(crashing)

1184
01:23:48,187 --> 01:23:50,600
- [John] Hey, hey, get out!

1185
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,536
Get the fuck outta there!

1186
01:23:52,536 --> 01:23:54,095
What are you doin' in
there, get the fuck out!

1187
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:55,915
(cat yowling)

1188
01:23:55,915 --> 01:23:57,390
God damn it!

1189
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:58,223
(cat yowling)

1190
01:23:58,223 --> 01:23:59,056
Son of a bitch!

1191
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:00,486
- Johnny?

1192
01:24:00,486 --> 01:24:02,670
- [John] God damn it!

1193
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:04,841
What are you doing, what are you,

1194
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:06,398
what did you do, God damn it.

1195
01:24:06,398 --> 01:24:08,151
(cat yowling)

1196
01:24:08,151 --> 01:24:09,406
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

1197
01:24:09,406 --> 01:24:13,289
- [Nina] John, stop it, leave him alone!

1198
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:15,554
- You stupid cat, fuck you!

1199
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:17,348
- [Nina] Johnny, stop it!

1200
01:24:17,348 --> 01:24:21,098
Johnny it's my cat,
Johnny it's all I've got!

1201
01:24:22,418 --> 01:24:24,751
- Fuck, he's just a fuckin'.

1202
01:24:25,926 --> 01:24:27,936
- Just gimme my cat.

1203
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:30,186
I had an abusive boyfriend.

1204
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:35,179
And it was safer on the streets,

1205
01:24:35,179 --> 01:24:38,787
you know, that way he couldn't find me.

1206
01:24:38,787 --> 01:24:39,958
- [Tad] Do you think you could ever

1207
01:24:39,958 --> 01:24:43,125
end up in a situation like that again?

1208
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,393
- Impossible.

1209
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,462
(crying)

1210
01:25:04,214 --> 01:25:06,797
Like I got anywhere else to go.

1211
01:25:25,991 --> 01:25:28,658
(dialing phone)

1212
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,579
(phone ringing)

1213
01:25:32,579 --> 01:25:33,643
- Hello?

1214
01:25:33,643 --> 01:25:35,060
- Hey, it's John.

1215
01:25:37,321 --> 01:25:39,820
- What's wrong with your voice?

1216
01:25:39,820 --> 01:25:43,543
- Um I thought, you know,
you might like to come over.

1217
01:25:43,543 --> 01:25:44,981
- [Gil] Well I was about to go for a run,

1218
01:25:44,981 --> 01:25:47,025
you wanna come with me?

1219
01:25:47,025 --> 01:25:50,192
- [John] Run over here if you want to.

1220
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:03,865
(knocking)

1221
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:06,744
It's for me.

1222
01:26:12,146 --> 01:26:13,146
- [Gil] Hey.

1223
01:26:25,943 --> 01:26:27,526
What are you doing?

1224
01:26:28,735 --> 01:26:30,939
- What do you think I'm doing?

1225
01:26:30,939 --> 01:26:32,522
I think you're hot.

1226
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,653
- You're tweaking.

1227
01:26:35,653 --> 01:26:38,940
Do you really think this is flattering?

1228
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:40,342
- What's the matter, baby?

1229
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:42,176
Huh, what are you playing hard to get?

1230
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:45,215
- Johnny, you are a terrific person,

1231
01:26:45,215 --> 01:26:49,382
if you only knew how I dreamed
about getting close to you.

1232
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:56,131
- [John] So go ahead.

1233
01:26:56,131 --> 01:26:57,464
Get close to me.

1234
01:27:00,289 --> 01:27:01,622
- Not like this.

1235
01:27:11,785 --> 01:27:14,452
(water running)

1236
01:27:22,258 --> 01:27:23,591
We have to talk.

1237
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:29,254
You guys have 'til the end of
the month to find a new place.

1238
01:27:30,397 --> 01:27:32,447
- You said we could wait
'til after the White Party.

1239
01:27:32,447 --> 01:27:35,192
- We'll I'm changing
it to the Plaid Party.

1240
01:27:35,192 --> 01:27:36,942
And that's next week.

1241
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:40,425
Thank God I came to my senses.

1242
01:27:49,302 --> 01:27:52,719
- There's no such thing as a Plaid Party.

1243
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:08,666
- Could you help me here?

1244
01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:27,942
- [John] Hey.

1245
01:28:29,121 --> 01:28:32,531
Nina, I said I was sorry, okay?

1246
01:28:32,531 --> 01:28:36,364
I mean this, this hasn't
been me lately so um,

1247
01:28:37,239 --> 01:28:39,867
just come on back inside.

1248
01:28:39,867 --> 01:28:40,700
- Is this everything?

1249
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:41,533
- Yeah.

1250
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:46,278
- Why are you doin' this?

1251
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:48,163
I mean I don't,

1252
01:28:48,163 --> 01:28:49,470
I don't want you to move out, I mean,

1253
01:28:49,470 --> 01:28:50,751
you don't have to move out.

1254
01:28:50,751 --> 01:28:51,828
- [Nina] Yes, I do.

1255
01:28:51,828 --> 01:28:53,369
You're getting worse, and I'm not

1256
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:55,160
gonna hang around and watch.

1257
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,202
- I have a couple of bad days,

1258
01:28:56,202 --> 01:28:57,873
and all of sudden you're bailing?

1259
01:28:57,873 --> 01:29:01,716
- You are fucking fooling
yourself, you know that?

1260
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:04,477
Your life is going to shit.

1261
01:29:04,477 --> 01:29:06,405
You're trashing your body.

1262
01:29:06,405 --> 01:29:08,405
You're out all night, every night,

1263
01:29:08,405 --> 01:29:12,572
and all you can think about
is when the next party is.

1264
01:29:13,986 --> 01:29:16,603
You don't want my help, fine.

1265
01:29:16,603 --> 01:29:17,770
Don't take it.

1266
01:29:19,165 --> 01:29:20,887
But you know what, get it from somebody.

1267
01:29:20,887 --> 01:29:22,268
Because at the rate you're going,

1268
01:29:22,268 --> 01:29:25,935
there's not gonna be
very many parties left.

1269
01:29:28,851 --> 01:29:30,542
- I can show you addicts in the Circuit,

1270
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:33,200
and addicts in the Catholic Church.

1271
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,340
I get tired when people
pinpoint drug addiction

1272
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:37,416
on Circuit parties.

1273
01:29:37,416 --> 01:29:38,571
I get pissed when the critics all

1274
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:41,438
blame everything on the sex and the drugs.

1275
01:29:41,438 --> 01:29:43,809
My lover and I are completely monogamous.

1276
01:29:43,809 --> 01:29:46,601
And we don't even touch narcotics.

1277
01:29:46,601 --> 01:29:49,434
- On a scale of one to ten, a ten.

1278
01:29:51,485 --> 01:29:53,326
- This is really good, Tad.

1279
01:29:53,326 --> 01:29:56,159
How much do you need to finish it?

1280
01:29:57,404 --> 01:29:59,154
- Another five grand.

1281
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:05,564
- [Geno] Ah, gee Tad, I'm
sorry, I'm all tapped out.

1282
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:10,777
But I would like to see some
more footage of Bobby, though.

1283
01:30:26,697 --> 01:30:29,697
(breathing heavily)

1284
01:31:34,077 --> 01:31:34,910
- [Voiceover] Well
you're just gonna have to

1285
01:31:34,910 --> 01:31:37,056
take care of Mommy 'til I get there.

1286
01:31:37,056 --> 01:31:39,806
Tomorrow, yeah, in the afternoon.

1287
01:31:40,716 --> 01:31:43,530
Uh, ask Mommy if you
can come to the airport.

1288
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:44,363
Um.

1289
01:31:45,701 --> 01:31:47,811
Okay, yes, alright.

1290
01:31:47,811 --> 01:31:49,819
Look, when I get back tomorrow, we'll

1291
01:31:49,819 --> 01:31:53,670
go to FAO Schwartz, you can
pick out anything you want.

1292
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:55,574
Okay, within reason.

1293
01:31:55,574 --> 01:31:58,485
Uh, yeah, you can go on the website now.

1294
01:31:58,485 --> 01:32:02,037
Uh, listen, sport, I gotta go now um.

1295
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:04,148
No, just tell Mommy that uh, that I'll

1296
01:32:04,148 --> 01:32:06,681
see her at the terminal tomorrow.

1297
01:32:06,681 --> 01:32:09,283
I love you too, okay, bye.

1298
01:32:09,283 --> 01:32:11,450
Um, this isn't gonna work.

1299
01:32:12,675 --> 01:32:14,258
You're way too old.

1300
01:32:26,019 --> 01:32:27,519
Well fuck you too.

1301
01:32:29,009 --> 01:32:30,755
You're a fuckin' hooker.

1302
01:32:30,755 --> 01:32:31,588
(phone beeping)

1303
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:34,210
- [Hector] John, it's me pick up.

1304
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:36,877
John, pick up the fucking phone!

1305
01:32:37,998 --> 01:32:42,165
John please, you gotta pick
up, I'm desperate here.

1306
01:32:44,338 --> 01:32:45,829
Look, I'm sorry I blew it with you John,

1307
01:32:45,829 --> 01:32:49,442
but you gotta understand
you've got everything.

1308
01:32:49,442 --> 01:32:51,609
You know, you're educated,

1309
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:53,550
you're smart.

1310
01:32:55,371 --> 01:32:57,187
You have friends.

1311
01:32:57,187 --> 01:32:59,187
Now I never had any of--

1312
01:33:00,603 --> 01:33:02,436
I don't feel anything.

1313
01:33:10,232 --> 01:33:12,565
I don't feel anything, John.

1314
01:33:19,581 --> 01:33:21,414
I don't feel anything.

1315
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:33,463
(crying)

1316
01:33:53,594 --> 01:33:55,927
- I came to apply for a job.

1317
01:34:10,687 --> 01:34:13,453
Gil, thanks for helpin' me, man.

1318
01:34:13,453 --> 01:34:16,194
I really needed the work.

1319
01:34:16,194 --> 01:34:19,361
- [Gil] You are welcome, I needed you.

1320
01:34:20,553 --> 01:34:22,720
I mean, I needed the help.

1321
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:28,804
- So, how did you get through it?

1322
01:34:28,804 --> 01:34:30,054
- Through what?

1323
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:33,478
- I don't know.

1324
01:34:33,478 --> 01:34:34,311
Being gay.

1325
01:34:36,557 --> 01:34:39,474
Having all this incredible freedom.

1326
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,029
How come you didn't get caught
up in the big, bad Circuit?

1327
01:34:46,029 --> 01:34:48,859
- I had my party days, believe me.

1328
01:34:48,859 --> 01:34:50,109
Remember disco?

1329
01:34:54,816 --> 01:34:58,416
Things were more covert back then.

1330
01:34:58,416 --> 01:35:02,934
You really felt like you were
getting away with something.

1331
01:35:02,934 --> 01:35:05,344
Nowadays you have to party harder.

1332
01:35:05,344 --> 01:35:09,011
Get higher just to
capture the same feeling.

1333
01:35:11,696 --> 01:35:14,863
- Do you ever wanna relive those days?

1334
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:20,573
- It gets repetitive after a while.

1335
01:35:20,573 --> 01:35:24,490
And I wanted to focus on
more long-term things.

1336
01:35:25,697 --> 01:35:28,447
That's when I started dating Tad.

1337
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:32,284
(laughing)

1338
01:35:35,858 --> 01:35:39,275
(fast-paced dance music)

1339
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,382
(coughing)

1340
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:55,624
(horse whinnying)

1341
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,736
- I'm a bottom, why is there such a stigma

1342
01:35:57,736 --> 01:35:59,609
about being a bottom?

1343
01:35:59,609 --> 01:36:03,580
I think 90% of West Hollywood, bottoms.

1344
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:06,830
(calm, relaxing music)

1345
01:36:15,496 --> 01:36:18,329
(water splashing)

1346
01:36:37,803 --> 01:36:39,553
- What, what's wrong?

1347
01:36:40,911 --> 01:36:45,078
- I just, I quit the juice,
so my body feels soft.

1348
01:36:47,215 --> 01:36:49,382
- Doesn't feel soft to me.

1349
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:56,843
- Fuck.

1350
01:36:58,531 --> 01:37:01,329
I can't make love unless
my body's perfect,

1351
01:37:01,329 --> 01:37:02,829
it's so fucked up.

1352
01:37:05,029 --> 01:37:05,862
- Well.

1353
01:37:08,316 --> 01:37:10,509
We can just hold each other for now.

1354
01:37:10,509 --> 01:37:11,342
Okay?

1355
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,213
Simple.

1356
01:37:17,273 --> 01:37:20,273
(crickets chirping)

1357
01:37:46,997 --> 01:37:50,597
- It is so good to have you back, baby.

1358
01:37:50,597 --> 01:37:52,321
You wanna go out later?

1359
01:37:52,321 --> 01:37:55,904
- No thanks, I can't,
I got plans with Gil.

1360
01:37:57,084 --> 01:37:59,667
(upbeat music)

1361
01:38:04,789 --> 01:38:08,039
(slow, romantic music)

1362
01:38:24,269 --> 01:38:25,936
I like this chapter.

1363
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:33,077
(laughing) I think I'd like to reread it.

1364
01:38:42,911 --> 01:38:43,744
Hey.

1365
01:38:46,731 --> 01:38:49,859
- I take it you're not
diggin' ditches today.

1366
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:53,686
- [John] Oh I got my meeting with Geno.

1367
01:38:53,686 --> 01:38:54,519
The White Party's next week,

1368
01:38:54,519 --> 01:38:57,701
I told him I'd supervise security.

1369
01:38:57,701 --> 01:38:59,625
- You're workin' another party?

1370
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:01,668
- Yeah, I mean, I can make over two grand.

1371
01:39:01,668 --> 01:39:03,896
- [Gil] Jesus, Johnny.

1372
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:04,905
You won't survive the weekend,

1373
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,072
you'll be right back where you started.

1374
01:39:07,072 --> 01:39:08,778
- You don't get it, I
need to pay rent, Gil.

1375
01:39:08,778 --> 01:39:12,222
- [Gil] I'll loan you the money for rent.

1376
01:39:12,222 --> 01:39:14,743
- It's the old patterns, man, like,

1377
01:39:14,743 --> 01:39:15,767
no matter how low I've sunk,

1378
01:39:15,767 --> 01:39:18,835
I'm just not gonna borrow money.

1379
01:39:18,835 --> 01:39:20,364
I'm a big boy.

1380
01:39:20,364 --> 01:39:22,440
- Yeah, I've noticed that.

1381
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:24,978
- And I'm not looking for a daddy.

1382
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:27,561
- Screw you, I am not that old.

1383
01:39:31,582 --> 01:39:33,665
- I'm gonna be okay, Gil.

1384
01:39:35,244 --> 01:39:36,411
And so are we.

1385
01:39:38,634 --> 01:39:39,467
Hey.

1386
01:39:45,543 --> 01:39:49,293
(calm, soothing piano music)

1387
01:40:24,645 --> 01:40:28,174
- You clearly don't know how
to deal with this, do you?

1388
01:40:28,174 --> 01:40:29,174
- With what?

1389
01:40:30,045 --> 01:40:33,664
- With this, with this
crummy apartment, with me,

1390
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:36,295
with your whole fuckin' phony spiritual

1391
01:40:36,295 --> 01:40:39,275
new-age millennium bullshit.

1392
01:40:39,275 --> 01:40:41,325
You know you spin records for a bunch of

1393
01:40:41,325 --> 01:40:43,003
drugged out circuit queens,

1394
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:45,905
you might as well be
dancin' to a train wreck!

1395
01:40:45,905 --> 01:40:47,795
- You know what, you're one of them,

1396
01:40:47,795 --> 01:40:50,295
but you're afraid to admit it.

1397
01:40:51,735 --> 01:40:53,465
- No, I'm not.

1398
01:40:53,465 --> 01:40:56,215
(water bubbling)

1399
01:41:00,836 --> 01:41:02,169
I'm a filmmaker.

1400
01:41:03,994 --> 01:41:05,460
- No, you're one of them.

1401
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:08,268
You know what's sad, is
you're getting old, Tad.

1402
01:41:08,268 --> 01:41:09,162
You hide behind your camera because

1403
01:41:09,162 --> 01:41:11,556
you're afraid to face people.

1404
01:41:11,556 --> 01:41:13,660
- [Tad] Fuck you.

1405
01:41:13,660 --> 01:41:15,126
- Why are you even making this movie?

1406
01:41:15,126 --> 01:41:17,959
- I'm watching guys die out there.

1407
01:41:19,576 --> 01:41:21,576
We're killin' ourselves.

1408
01:41:24,026 --> 01:41:26,026
That's why I'm doin' it.

1409
01:41:30,171 --> 01:41:32,754
(horn honking)

1410
01:41:34,631 --> 01:41:35,631
- Come here!

1411
01:41:40,299 --> 01:41:41,259
- Louise?

1412
01:41:41,259 --> 01:41:42,738
- [Louise] Hi, honey, listen, I was

1413
01:41:42,738 --> 01:41:45,098
out running some errands today, and I um,

1414
01:41:45,098 --> 01:41:47,441
wanna give you this.

1415
01:41:47,441 --> 01:41:48,274
- [Tad] What is it?

1416
01:41:48,274 --> 01:41:50,963
- Use it for your little
documentary, okay?

1417
01:41:50,963 --> 01:41:52,364
I gotta go, I got a lot more to do, but,

1418
01:41:52,364 --> 01:41:55,717
do me a favor, would you
keep this between us?

1419
01:41:55,717 --> 01:41:56,550
- Okay.

1420
01:42:05,287 --> 01:42:09,454
♫ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♫

1421
01:42:10,473 --> 01:42:12,618
(laughing)

1422
01:42:12,618 --> 01:42:15,101
- [Geno] A car is picking
you up in 10 minutes.

1423
01:42:15,101 --> 01:42:17,416
You have a suite at the hotel.

1424
01:42:17,416 --> 01:42:21,583
Security's ours, but you have
to be very, very discreet.

1425
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,340
- [Hector] I'm always discreet, baby.

1426
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:27,098
- [Geno] About that other
matter, the Bobby thing?

1427
01:42:27,098 --> 01:42:29,009
Can you take care of that,
make the arrangements?

1428
01:42:29,009 --> 01:42:30,186
- [Hector] The arrangements are made.

1429
01:42:30,186 --> 01:42:31,353
- [Geno] Okay.

1430
01:42:32,232 --> 01:42:36,135
Now this, you gotta be very,
very careful with this.

1431
01:42:36,135 --> 01:42:38,052
This is for Bobby only.

1432
01:42:45,632 --> 01:42:49,715
- [Hector] I bet this
could kill somebody, right?

1433
01:42:50,765 --> 01:42:52,493
And what do you have for me?

1434
01:42:52,493 --> 01:42:54,352
- [Geno] A post-dated wire transfer order

1435
01:42:54,352 --> 01:42:56,281
and an airline ticket.

1436
01:42:56,281 --> 01:42:59,531
Discretion is of the utmost importance.

1437
01:43:01,768 --> 01:43:04,768
(fun, upbeat music)

1438
01:43:16,096 --> 01:43:19,446
- Would you miss me if I left you?

1439
01:43:19,446 --> 01:43:22,060
- Where do you think you're goin'?

1440
01:43:22,060 --> 01:43:24,951
- Nowhere, I was just wondering.

1441
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:26,718
Did a lot of thinkin' about my life

1442
01:43:26,718 --> 01:43:29,301
when we had our little problem.

1443
01:43:30,903 --> 01:43:32,598
- We worked it out.

1444
01:43:32,598 --> 01:43:34,276
- [Hector] Yeah, we did.

1445
01:43:34,276 --> 01:43:37,651
I think this is my last Circuit party.

1446
01:43:37,651 --> 01:43:38,484
- Good.

1447
01:43:39,785 --> 01:43:42,574
You should concentrate
on your photography, man.

1448
01:43:42,574 --> 01:43:44,991
You're very talented, Hector.

1449
01:43:47,266 --> 01:43:52,115
- I really fucked things
up between us, didn't I?

1450
01:43:52,115 --> 01:43:52,948
- No.

1451
01:43:58,403 --> 01:44:01,320
- Have you heard Manny's new track?

1452
01:44:13,829 --> 01:44:15,246
I love you, John.

1453
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:27,041
(upbeat music)

1454
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:04,569
- Well, I'm an ER nurse and uh,

1455
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:07,660
you know I deal with tragedy all day long.

1456
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:11,493
So, I like to come here,
kick back, relax and,

1457
01:45:12,573 --> 01:45:16,319
you know, be in an environment
where I'm not judged.

1458
01:45:16,319 --> 01:45:20,486
And uh, you know, the Circuit
works for me. (laughing)

1459
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:28,184
- Well like the drugs,
they make me feel horny.

1460
01:45:28,184 --> 01:45:31,536
But they gimme a lot of energy.

1461
01:45:31,536 --> 01:45:35,703
But frankly, they inhibit my
sexual, like, performance.

1462
01:45:37,138 --> 01:45:40,099
Well, thank God for the drugs. (laughing)

1463
01:45:40,099 --> 01:45:43,130
I mean, drugs promote safe sex.

1464
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:46,130
(fun, upbeat music)

1465
01:46:13,699 --> 01:46:16,699
- [Man In Gray Shirt] Baby, what's up?

1466
01:46:16,699 --> 01:46:17,532
- [Hector] Alright, sweet babies,

1467
01:46:17,532 --> 01:46:19,379
who wants to place an order?

1468
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:20,949
(laughing)

1469
01:46:20,949 --> 01:46:23,616
(phone dialing)

1470
01:46:26,069 --> 01:46:27,759
- [Gil] Hello?

1471
01:46:27,759 --> 01:46:29,586
- What am I doing here?

1472
01:46:29,586 --> 01:46:31,280
- [Gil] What am I doin' here?

1473
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:34,553
- [John] You're making good
sense, it's mobbed here.

1474
01:46:34,553 --> 01:46:36,771
- Anybody better-lookin' than me?

1475
01:46:36,771 --> 01:46:40,002
- Uh, yeah, pretty much everybody.

1476
01:46:40,002 --> 01:46:41,460
- [Gil] Oh, good, well I know you

1477
01:46:41,460 --> 01:46:44,190
could never make up your mind.

1478
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:46,470
- What would you say if
I asked you to join me?

1479
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:48,299
- Well having nothing to do
with what I really wanna do,

1480
01:46:48,299 --> 01:46:51,414
I think we should stick
to the original plan.

1481
01:46:51,414 --> 01:46:52,894
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1482
01:46:52,894 --> 01:46:55,605
- I'll be home if you wanna talk.

1483
01:46:55,605 --> 01:46:57,793
- [John] I'll be in the
bar with about 6,000

1484
01:46:57,793 --> 01:47:01,067
gorgeous, horny men if
you need to talk, okay?

1485
01:47:01,067 --> 01:47:01,900
(laughing)

1486
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:03,410
(phone ringing)

1487
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:04,970
- Hello?

1488
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:06,810
- Is it hard yet?

1489
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,458
- [Bobby] Hector.

1490
01:47:08,458 --> 01:47:09,503
So why don't you come over and uh,

1491
01:47:09,503 --> 01:47:11,722
warm me up before my show?

1492
01:47:11,722 --> 01:47:15,441
- I'll come over afterwards
to cool you down.

1493
01:47:15,441 --> 01:47:17,671
We'll have more time then.

1494
01:47:17,671 --> 01:47:20,429
- Okay, my little prick tease.

1495
01:47:20,429 --> 01:47:21,929
I'll see you then.

1496
01:47:37,387 --> 01:47:41,304
(upbeat, drumming dance music)

1497
01:47:52,716 --> 01:47:53,549
- [Person In Line] Hi.

1498
01:47:53,549 --> 01:47:55,015
- Hey, nice to see you.

1499
01:47:55,015 --> 01:47:56,371
- Nice to see you, too.

1500
01:47:56,371 --> 01:47:58,038
- You have fun, now.

1501
01:47:59,534 --> 01:48:00,630
- [Man In Line] Hey.

1502
01:48:00,630 --> 01:48:02,613
- Thank you, have a good time.

1503
01:48:02,613 --> 01:48:03,446
- Thanks.

1504
01:48:05,292 --> 01:48:09,209
(upbeat, drumming dance music)

1505
01:48:23,195 --> 01:48:26,215
- Definitely, yeah, uh, uh uh.

1506
01:48:26,215 --> 01:48:29,465
(strobing dance music)

1507
01:49:19,636 --> 01:49:20,889
- [Stage Manager] Okay, folks, we've got

1508
01:49:20,889 --> 01:49:23,722
two minutes for the show to start.

1509
01:49:24,695 --> 01:49:27,028
- [Bobby] I'm not ready yet.

1510
01:49:28,154 --> 01:49:28,987
- [Stage Manager] Okay,
the show is starting

1511
01:49:28,987 --> 01:49:30,175
in a minute and 30 seconds,

1512
01:49:30,175 --> 01:49:32,155
I'm gonna have the DJ cue the music.

1513
01:49:32,155 --> 01:49:34,629
Um, yeah, can you hear me out there?

1514
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:37,962
Dj, cue the song and, on my, there we go

1515
01:49:39,788 --> 01:49:41,522
just cue it now, just cue it now,

1516
01:49:41,522 --> 01:49:43,303
he'll be out in a minute.

1517
01:49:43,303 --> 01:49:44,136
- Bobby, what's the matter, man,

1518
01:49:44,136 --> 01:49:46,453
can you use the needle?

1519
01:49:46,453 --> 01:49:48,790
- Can't handle that shit anymore.

1520
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:49,698
- [Stage Manager] Are you ready
back there in the bathroom?

1521
01:49:49,698 --> 01:49:50,810
- I need more time.

1522
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:52,077
- [Stage Manager] Okay,
thanks Bobby, okay,

1523
01:49:52,077 --> 01:49:55,198
we're gonna go in one minute.

1524
01:49:55,198 --> 01:49:56,720
Everybody okay, everybody
got everything you need?

1525
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:59,226
Everybody get their makeup on.

1526
01:49:59,226 --> 01:50:03,926
Okay, gettin' ready, okay
Bobby, how's it coming?

1527
01:50:03,926 --> 01:50:05,977
Are you ready to go?

1528
01:50:05,977 --> 01:50:07,672
Dancers, no no, put that down,

1529
01:50:07,672 --> 01:50:10,770
that does not go out on
stage, it stays here.

1530
01:50:10,770 --> 01:50:13,901
- [Bobby] Hey, Tad, I need your help.

1531
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:14,734
- Yeah--

1532
01:50:26,812 --> 01:50:27,645
- Woo-hoo!

1533
01:50:31,854 --> 01:50:36,265
- [Stage Manager] Okay,
I'm opening the door.

1534
01:50:36,265 --> 01:50:40,662
Five, four, three,
everybody let's go let's go!

1535
01:50:40,662 --> 01:50:43,000
Come on, high energy, get

1536
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,167
Let's go, everybody outside,

01:50:53,025 --> 01:50:54,442
Okay, here we go.

1539
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:59,597
Let's go, let's go, go go go

to the South Stage, please.

1553
01:51:31,401 --> 01:51:33,393
The White Party proudly welcomes

1554
01:51:33,393 --> 01:51:36,238
the King of the Circuit
in his final performance.

1555
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:37,938
Bobby Rocks.

1556
01:51:37,938 --> 01:51:41,521
(fast, upbeat dance music)

1557
01:51:50,244 --> 01:51:53,411
(calming piano music)

1558
01:51:57,879 --> 01:51:59,374
- [Louise] We're nearly sold out,

1559
01:51:59,374 --> 01:52:02,653
there's even more people than last year.

1560
01:52:02,653 --> 01:52:05,432
- [Geno] Jesus, you dumb fuck.

1561
01:52:05,432 --> 01:52:07,033
Come on, help me pick this up.

1562
01:52:07,033 --> 01:52:08,489
- [Louise] You pick it up.

1563
01:52:08,489 --> 01:52:11,489
And I know about Bobby, too.

1564
01:52:11,489 --> 01:52:13,074
- What do you know about Bobby?

1565
01:52:13,074 --> 01:52:15,665
- I know you bet on his
life like a fast horse.

1566
01:52:15,665 --> 01:52:16,784
And you lost.

1567
01:52:16,784 --> 01:52:18,204
- I helped Bobby out of a jam.

1568
01:52:18,204 --> 01:52:19,545
A hundred other insurance companies

1569
01:52:19,545 --> 01:52:21,511
would have done the same thing!

1570
01:52:21,511 --> 01:52:22,847
- And there were others, too!

1571
01:52:22,847 --> 01:52:24,986
- You don't know shit about Bobby!

1572
01:52:24,986 --> 01:52:27,777
- Oh yes I do, he told me everything.

1573
01:52:27,777 --> 01:52:30,926
I hate you, I'm leaving you, Geno.

1574
01:52:30,926 --> 01:52:32,865
- You're leaving me?

1575
01:52:32,865 --> 01:52:35,845
- [Louise] I'm leaving you.

1576
01:52:35,845 --> 01:52:39,095
If you touch me, I swear I'll kill you.

1577
01:53:01,966 --> 01:53:05,383
(fast-paced dance music)

1578
01:53:15,711 --> 01:53:18,771
(deep breathing)

1579
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:21,938
- [Bobby] It's tribal, it's fraternal,

1580
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:26,193
it's like the gay man's Superbowl.

1581
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:29,808
They're like my family.

1582
01:53:31,635 --> 01:53:32,635
What a rush.

1583
01:53:40,738 --> 01:53:42,071
- [Tad] Alright.

1584
01:53:43,576 --> 01:53:46,192
So that's it for you, Bobby, man.

1585
01:53:46,192 --> 01:53:49,043
The rest happens in the editing room.

1586
01:53:49,043 --> 01:53:50,995
- Well, all I've done
is talk about myself.

1587
01:53:50,995 --> 01:53:53,527
I didn't ask anything about you.

1588
01:53:53,527 --> 01:53:57,257
What about you, Tad, you Circuit boy too?

1589
01:53:57,257 --> 01:53:58,424
- No, I'm not.

1590
01:53:59,609 --> 01:54:01,377
I'm a filmmaker.

1591
01:54:01,377 --> 01:54:03,794
You know, I'm recording them.

1592
01:54:08,124 --> 01:54:09,916
Okay, I love it out there.

1593
01:54:09,916 --> 01:54:13,235
You know, you're out
there with your friends,

1594
01:54:13,235 --> 01:54:14,652
I mean even the guys
who aren't your friends

1595
01:54:14,652 --> 01:54:16,663
are all of a sudden your friends.

1596
01:54:16,663 --> 01:54:19,229
It's like flying, you know?

1597
01:54:19,229 --> 01:54:20,062
- Yeah.

1598
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:28,973
- So yeah.

1599
01:54:32,185 --> 01:54:35,315
Yeah, I guess I'm a Circuit boy.

1600
01:54:35,315 --> 01:54:38,447
You know what man, there's
nothin' wrong with that.

1601
01:54:38,447 --> 01:54:42,116
- Damn right, there's
nothin' wrong with that.

1602
01:54:42,116 --> 01:54:45,449
Fuck all those judgmental bastards, man.

1603
01:54:50,077 --> 01:54:51,800
(laughing)

1604
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:55,383
(fast-paced, upbeat music)

1605
01:55:04,525 --> 01:55:06,775
(knocking)

1606
01:55:09,648 --> 01:55:11,507
- Worth the wait?

1607
01:55:11,507 --> 01:55:12,340
- You bet.

1608
01:55:14,192 --> 01:55:15,109
Come on in.

1609
01:55:25,099 --> 01:55:26,599
- A few surprises.

1610
01:55:27,619 --> 01:55:29,234
You wanna party first?

1611
01:55:29,234 --> 01:55:30,484
- [Bobby] Yeah.

1612
01:55:39,170 --> 01:55:40,753
- Start with the K.

1613
01:55:51,012 --> 01:55:52,595
Come here, big boy.

1614
01:55:55,626 --> 01:55:59,126
(building drumming music)

1615
01:56:24,335 --> 01:56:27,418
(upbeat dance music)

1616
01:56:41,143 --> 01:56:42,872
- [John] Hey, have you seen Hector?

1617
01:56:42,872 --> 01:56:43,872
He okay?

1618
01:56:43,872 --> 01:56:46,951
- Just saw him a minute
ago, out back by the pool

1619
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:49,868
He's fine, relax, go have some fun.

1620
01:57:14,531 --> 01:57:17,698
- It isn't a good party without an OD.

1621
01:57:22,686 --> 01:57:24,632
- What the fuck, it looks like a God damn

1622
01:57:24,632 --> 01:57:26,465
GHP epidemic out here.

1623
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:30,693
- John!

1624
01:57:33,525 --> 01:57:36,984
He says it's some sort of an emergency.

1625
01:57:36,984 --> 01:57:37,817
- Hello?

1626
01:57:38,837 --> 01:57:40,420
- [Gil] I love you!

1627
01:57:44,281 --> 01:57:47,781
(intense throbbing music)

1628
01:57:58,914 --> 01:58:00,497
- That's for later.

1629
01:58:04,645 --> 01:58:05,698
- [Paramedic] I'm gonna get Geno,

1630
01:58:05,698 --> 01:58:07,948
he's got a serious problem.

1631
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:13,453
- [Officer] Alright I want everybody

1632
01:58:13,453 --> 01:58:14,344
out of this filth right now!

1633
01:58:14,344 --> 01:58:15,302
- [Geno] No way you're not,

1634
01:58:15,302 --> 01:58:19,469
talking to this bozo right
here, he's gonna shut us down.

1635
01:58:21,095 --> 01:58:23,852
(ambulance sirens)

1636
01:58:23,852 --> 01:58:27,019
(intense dance music)

1637
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,642
I have a deal with the city,
you can't shut me down.

1638
01:58:30,642 --> 01:58:31,475
- [officer] I want everybody

1639
01:58:31,475 --> 01:58:32,770
and all your pretty-boys outta here!

1640
01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:33,836
- You can't shut me
down, you mother-fucker!

1641
01:58:33,836 --> 01:58:35,253
- Stop the music!

1642
01:58:39,324 --> 01:58:41,824
- The party, I feel the party.

1643
01:58:43,904 --> 01:58:47,321
It's beatin'. (laughing)

1644
01:58:49,984 --> 01:58:53,396
That's one for each of us, baby.

1645
01:58:53,396 --> 01:58:55,597
- So what are we celebrating?

1646
01:58:55,597 --> 01:58:58,000
- It's my birthday today.

1647
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,443
Surprise!

1648
01:58:59,443 --> 01:59:00,276
- Yeah?

1649
01:59:02,587 --> 01:59:04,062
How old?

1650
01:59:04,062 --> 01:59:05,645
- I just turned 30.

1651
01:59:20,766 --> 01:59:22,431
- So beautiful.

1652
01:59:22,431 --> 01:59:25,335
You saved my life tonight.

1653
01:59:25,335 --> 01:59:28,381
- More than you'll ever know.

1654
01:59:28,381 --> 01:59:31,548
(intense dance music)

1655
01:59:57,591 --> 01:59:59,008
The party's over.

1656
02:00:20,687 --> 02:00:22,187
- Hector, wake up.

1657
02:00:25,947 --> 02:00:27,280
Hector, wake up.

1658
02:00:28,147 --> 02:00:28,980
Oh, fuck.

1659
02:00:30,087 --> 02:00:32,087
Hector, can you hear me?

1660
02:00:37,687 --> 02:00:40,547
- [Woman] Dios mio, Dios, mio!

1661
02:00:40,547 --> 02:00:43,464
(speaking Spanish)

1662
02:00:44,637 --> 02:00:46,804
- [Man In Black] Overdose.

1663
02:00:49,037 --> 02:00:51,427
- I'm so sorry, Bobby and
I were such good friends,

1664
02:00:51,427 --> 02:00:53,094
I don't know what...

1665
02:00:58,986 --> 02:01:00,403
He was, we were--

1666
02:01:11,864 --> 02:01:13,947
I just assumed that uh...

1667
02:01:25,876 --> 02:01:29,209
(train whistle blowing)

1668
02:01:38,023 --> 02:01:41,106
(pulsing drum music)

1669
02:01:45,393 --> 02:01:47,560
(sobbing)

1670
02:01:58,508 --> 02:02:00,667
- Hey doll. (laughing)

1671
02:02:00,667 --> 02:02:05,128
- [Tad] How are you, wow,
glad you guys could be here.

1672
02:02:05,128 --> 02:02:06,795
- This may be tough.

1673
02:02:11,469 --> 02:02:12,386
I love you.

1674
02:02:19,759 --> 02:02:20,842
- [Nina] Hey.

1675
02:02:30,123 --> 02:02:31,040
- Go ahead.

1676
02:02:33,803 --> 02:02:35,119
- [Julian] Circuit save my life.

1677
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:37,685
I mean, a regular person
wouldn't understand that.

1678
02:02:37,685 --> 02:02:41,852
But, the music and the
people really keeps me goin'.

1679
02:02:42,782 --> 02:02:46,032
- It's validating, it's sexy, it's hot.

1680
02:02:49,157 --> 02:02:51,195
Get anybody I want.

1681
02:02:51,195 --> 02:02:54,199
- Well, I'm out of it now, but uh,

1682
02:02:54,199 --> 02:02:57,539
I really liked the way it
made me feel, you know?

1683
02:02:57,539 --> 02:03:00,039
It was, it was very seductive.

1684
02:03:01,113 --> 02:03:04,030
(slow piano music)

1685
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:12,907
♫ You saw me standing alone in the dark

1686
02:03:16,052 --> 02:03:20,219
♫ Lost in the silence of my heart

1687
02:03:23,603 --> 02:03:27,770
♫ Crying for angels, crying for light

1688
02:03:31,071 --> 02:03:34,821
♫ Crying for someone tonight

1689
02:03:46,281 --> 02:03:50,448
♫ No time for wasting, no time for truth

1690
02:03:53,692 --> 02:03:57,359
♫ No time for innocent lies

1691
02:04:01,185 --> 02:04:05,352
♫ Touched me like heroes
straight from your eyes ♫

1692
02:04:09,515 --> 02:04:11,432
- Sometimes I feel like

1693
02:04:14,653 --> 02:04:18,320
I feel like there's
nothin' goin' on inside.

1694
02:04:20,955 --> 02:04:21,955
I hate that.

1695
02:04:24,032 --> 02:04:25,699
I hate that feeling.

1696
02:04:28,493 --> 02:04:30,533
- [John] Haven't you ever loved someone

1697
02:04:30,533 --> 02:04:34,004
that no one else could understand?

1698
02:04:34,004 --> 02:04:37,171
