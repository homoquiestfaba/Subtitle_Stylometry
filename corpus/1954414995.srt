1
00:00:25,709 --> 00:00:28,660
( Audience applauding )

2
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,530
Man:
You see, it's these factors,
ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:34,366
that lead to
a widespread shortage

4
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,502
of clean drinking water
in the region,

5
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,571
leaving thousands
upon thousands

6
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:43,475
of diseased, dying people.

7
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,445
Your support

8
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:49,148
may be the last
chance we have

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,550
of ending this suffering.

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,687
We are not
gonna miss it.

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,793
Not on my watch!

12
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:03,762
I remember when a dear
friend of mine, Sam atwell,

13
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:08,100
when he first approached me
about joining this mission,

14
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:12,538
and it was his
determination

15
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,375
that sparked my passion
to make a difference.

16
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,411
His actions
have saved lives,

17
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,280
his message--

18
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:24,216
well, it's brought people
all over the world

19
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,553
closer to our lord,
our savior.

20
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,224
He is a leader.
He is a servant.

21
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,861
He also just happens
to be my best friend.

22
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:40,132
It is now
my distinct pleasure

23
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,836
to introduce to you the man
behind this mission.

24
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:47,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
my good friend,
Mr. Sam atwell!

25
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:50,275
( Applauding, cheering )

26
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,148
( Snoring )

27
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,587
Man:
Beep, beep,

28
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,689
beep, beep,

29
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,892
beep, beep, beep

30
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,827
beep, beep,

31
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,330
beep, beep, beep.

32
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,532
( Groans )

33
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,301
Morning, Baker.

34
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:19,438
High is 97,
and your low is 75.

35
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,373
( Groans )

36
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,611
( Men laughing )

37
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,646
Sam, buddy, you can't
bail on me. I mean it.

38
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,749
Yes, I can.
No, you can't, Sam.
Uh-uh.

39
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,851
What did she say exactly?
Okay, she said,

40
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,554
"Abby and I are going to
go to worship service
this afternoon."

41
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,189
Don't know why
this is funny.

42
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:40,626
"Bring Sam along,
and we'll meet at church."

43
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,328
You know what?
You need to take Baker.
I'm not taking Baker.

44
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,764
No way. I need
somebody who
can party, Sam.

45
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,333
Somebody like me,

46
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,802
and you're closest...
At church?

47
00:02:50,804 --> 00:02:54,840
Oh, yeah.
( Vocalizes, whistles )

48
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,377
Phil, I'm just sensing
the gloomy skies over you, man.

49
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,646
Look alive.
The floor's lava.

50
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,284
Next time you can
do that with a smile.

51
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,252
Tyler, I'm gonna leave in a sec
if you want to come with me.

52
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,522
I got to bail, man.
Still got to finish
these internship apps.

53
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,891
Why are you going
so early, anyway?

54
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,426
I got a meeting
before class.

55
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,562
Give this to Baker
if he gets up, okay?

56
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,765
What time...
What time does
this class end?

57
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,800
4:30, Pierce.

58
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,502
Which is
just crazy

59
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,471
because this church thing's
popping off at 6:00 P.M.

60
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,942
All right, what are
we even wearing--

61
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,444
hey, all right!
That's great! Good!

62
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,346
Okay, listen,
if you want to
be colorful,

63
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,748
Moses apparently had
a whole bunch of colors
on his coat,

64
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,650
so I got something
made out of fuchsia--

65
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,620
maybe a skinny black tie.
Have a bit of edge.

66
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,255
Phil, grab my keys
in my bag, please.

67
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:45,257
I owe you, man.
I do. Appreciate that.

68
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,527
As long as
everybody's happy.
I'll see you guys later.

69
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,430
It is not that bad.
It is that bad.

70
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,666
No, it's not.
Sam, I haven't slept
in three weeks.

71
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,602
Okay, I've got
stats homework

72
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,837
growing out of
my backseat.

73
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,640
And to top it all off,
I've got to go in front
of the I.F.C. Tonight

74
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,543
and deny all of
the hazing allegations
they have on you guys.

75
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,980
I-I-I--
I'm not like you all.

76
00:04:07,982 --> 00:04:11,883
I can't just get up
in front of people
and just lie to their faces.

77
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:15,554
Okay. Who's your
stats Professor again?

78
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:18,357
You're in Elliot's
class, right?
Yeah.

79
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,892
And did he start off
the year talking about

80
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,362
how even Einstein
failed math as a kid?

81
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:26,632
Yeah.
Yeah, pretty
amazing story, right?

82
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:28,333
Only problem is,

83
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,302
that story
never happened.

84
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,004
Einstein didn't fail
math as a kid.

85
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:36,642
He mastered differential
calculus before he was 15.

86
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:39,811
Teachers still tell
their students that
today because it...

87
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,813
It inspires a sense
of hope that their students

88
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:46,785
can overcome obstacles
and achieve their dreams.

89
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,422
Sometimes people do
want to be lied to.

90
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,811
So you want me
to sell out?

91
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,350
No, I want you
to buy in.

92
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:20,452
Look, Phil,

93
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:22,621
I think you're
bad-ass, dude.
I really do.

94
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:25,757
But if you want to join
a fraternity, make sure
there's one to join.

95
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,595
You're gonna be all right.
You know that, don't you?

96
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,735
Morning, gentlemen.
Morning, sir.

97
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,571
Grab Phil's stats book
along with my bag, please.
Yes, sir.

98
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,974
Boys, Phil has fallen
deathly ill.

99
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,010
When you get back
to the dorms,

100
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,079
see that he goes straight
to sleep and isn't disturbed.

101
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,081
Understood?
Yes, sir.

102
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:52,784
I'll leave this
on my porch for you
when I finish it.

103
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,953
Have a good day, Mr. atwell.
Have a good day, Mr. atwell.

104
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:57,055
What are you doing?
I just said that.

105
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,770
Come on!

106
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,976
All righty.

107
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,911
Your transcript

108
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,747
and your application
to graduate.

109
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:23,515
Thank you.

110
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,517
Pretty darn
exciting.

111
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,960
You're cool, right?

112
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,599
Yeah, you're cool.

113
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:43,168
Uh, for my address,

114
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,105
should I put
my current address
or permanent address?

115
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,941
Here's what's gonna happen.
The business office is going to

116
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:54,079
to whatever you put
in the blank under "address."
What-- sorry.

117
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,748
I'm gonna be switching
houses is all,

118
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,517
because I'm going
to law school
here in the fall.

119
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:03,121
So I'm wondering
if I should...
Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:06,124
I was supposed to
go to law school.

121
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:09,895
It was the end
of my last semester

122
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:11,930
as a political
science major--

123
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,733
I'm a poli sci major.
And my therapist

124
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:17,169
convinced me to take
a semester off.

125
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:21,139
Just thought it might
help me find myself.

126
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,543
My therapist
and I went to

127
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,978
cabo San Lucas,

128
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,147
and they found her with...

129
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,190
Shut up, shut up,

130
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,825
shut up!

131
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,726
Shut it!

132
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,568
Are you okay?

133
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,204
I'll put my
permanent address.

134
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,709
It says here
there's

135
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,145
a hold on
my application

136
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:03,715
for $9,211,
but my scholarship
should cover that.

137
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,650
Hmm?

138
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,853
Would you mind just
checking on that?

139
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,188
Check to see
if we made a mistake?

140
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,825
Have a real
quick look?
Now?

141
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,760
Yeah.

142
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,933
You took summer school
last year?

143
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,035
Yes. Some of
my professors

144
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,171
were saying that
it'd be a good way
to make time

145
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,240
to prepare for
the lsat's, so...

146
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:30,642
Mm, that makes sense.

147
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:33,278
Yeah, I know.
That's why I shouldn't
be penalized.

148
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
No, this tuition bill.

149
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:38,517
It all seems to be
adding up correctly.

150
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,788
Your scholarship expired
last semester.

151
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,894
I'm gonna pour you
a drink.

152
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:52,831
Uh, hold on. That's not
gonna work for me.
I can't pay that.

153
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,134
Oh, shoot. I guess that
makes you the only student
who can't afford college.

154
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,538
Hold on, hold on.
I'm not gonna be
able to come up

155
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,107
with nine grand
in three weeks.

156
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,210
Then take a semester off.
I'm not taking
a semester off.

157
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,547
Son, stop thinking about
your dreams being crushed
as a bad thing.

158
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,615
It's fantastic.

159
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:13,118
This is the first day
of the rest of your
pathetic life.

160
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,288
Take the advice
my father gave me:

161
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,692
Life is difficult.

162
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,703
<i> ( People applauding ) </i>
Jesus.

163
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:34,606
Amen. You guys
can be seated.

164
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:38,577
We're gonna continue
to fan the flames
of the spirit,

165
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,846
but first off,
we're gonna hear
from Macy

166
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,883
about our missions team.

167
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,655
Hi everyone.
I want to talk
to you this evening

168
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:53,325
about our annual
summer mission trip.

169
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:56,027
After a lot of
prayer and fasting,

170
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,664
our group has felt
the lord's calling to
go and make disciples

171
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,166
in Hawaii!

172
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,804
Now, reaching the Hawaiians
with the gospel of Jesus

173
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,608
will be impossible
without the financial
support of our church.

174
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,177
I'd love to answer
any questions you may have

175
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,747
after the service,
and we just really
appreciate your support.

176
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:17,616
Thanks.

177
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,221
We have decided
to give tonight's offering

178
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:26,691
towards our missionaries
in their efforts.

179
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,927
As the ushers
come forward,
all that I ask

180
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:33,098
is that you give
in a way that reflects

181
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,833
the faith

182
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,168
that you claim.

183
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,205
Let's continue to
worship together.

184
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,644
Look alive, look alive.
Here we go.

185
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,092
Hey, Macy.

186
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,962
Hey! How are you?
Good!

187
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:07,065
Sam atwell.
I didn't know you
went to this church.

188
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,068
I don't. I came with
some friends, so...

189
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,736
Oh.
Yeah.

190
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:14,973
How's it going?
How's the fundraising going?

191
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,742
It's going well.
It's definitely

192
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,778
a challenge, though,
to raise 20,000.

193
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,981
Yeah, geez.
That's a lot.

194
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,384
So, uh, how much
have you all got
left to raise?

195
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,119
Well, let's see...

196
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,455
$4,000 as of
Wednesday, which,

197
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,224
you know, we started
a week ago, so...

198
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,226
Wait, you've
raised 16,000--

199
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:39,297
you raised $16,000 in--
where did you get
all that money?

200
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,866
God has been so good
to us in our mission.

201
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,202
Hasn't he?
My gosh!

202
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:47,706
Actually, a lot of my friends
have had success raising
money for mission trips.

203
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,441
My cousin Allison
is in ruhongo

204
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,409
for living water,
drilling Wells.

205
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,977
There was a flood
in Lesotho,

206
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,746
so I'm pretty sure
she moved there,

207
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,448
but, ah,
she's everywhere.

208
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,384
So what kind of
accountability is there?

209
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,953
What do you mean?
Oh, I guess...

210
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,189
I guess I'm just
thinking, like, how
do these people know

211
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,291
that you're not, like,
running off to Vegas

212
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,293
with the money?

213
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,895
Right, yeah.
Obviously,
that's ridiculous.

214
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,800
Um...

215
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:19,204
Well, I'm...
Bringing my camera.

216
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,212
I don't get it.

217
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:30,515
Okay. Okay.

218
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,852
What do you not get?
Guys,

219
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:36,821
we only have three months
left together before
we have to graduate.

220
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:41,059
I'm having
a quarter-life crisis here,
and you're talking to Africa?

221
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:44,295
No. No. We're not
going to Africa.

222
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,431
But you want to dig Wells.

223
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,300
Well, it's this
big thing right now.
It's about clean water.

224
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,470
We're not actually
gonna be digging any.
You're dipping again, huh?

225
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,473
Yeah, I'm trying
to quit smoking.
That a boy.

226
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,010
It's a healthy choice.
Guys, why do people
go to charity events?

227
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,980
'Cause they want
to help people.
Wrong. Because

228
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,015
they want to feel like
they're helping people,

229
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,051
and that feeling
comes with a price.

230
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:10,188
The sadder the cause,
the higher the price.

231
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,792
And what's sadder
than kids in Africa
without clean water.

232
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,430
So I've been
doing my research.

233
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,267
It seems that now,
saving Africa

234
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,804
is as popular with christians
as Jesus Christ himself.

235
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,841
So if we can challenge
christians to prove
their faith through giving,

236
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:33,411
they're gonna give
whatever they have to
to not feel guilty.

237
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,313
Basically,
we're going to--
steal.

238
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,483
Yeah.
You want to
steal from christians.

239
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,186
( Clears throat )
Yeah?

240
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:44,489
Pierce clovins.
Long-time listener,
first-time caller.

241
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,126
Uh, presentation looks great.
It's really cute.

242
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:51,563
The idea is awful.
It's just terrible.

243
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:54,032
But I appreciate the brewskis
and I appreciate the bro-skis.

244
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,835
I got things to do...
Pierce, you'd be doing me
a real solid here.

245
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,970
I don't think so.
You'd be
helping me out.

246
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,939
Sorry, buddy.
There might be money
in it for you.

247
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,341
Would you all just
listen to Sam? Really!

248
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,610
Sam, please continue.
Thank you.

249
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,446
Very well-
thought-out idea.
Thank you. Guys,

250
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:12,450
look, all I'm asking
you to do is help me
put on one event.

251
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:15,620
Sam, I think Pierce
was trying to say

252
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:17,956
was that there has
to be something else--
there isn't, dude!

253
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,525
I can't get
a tuition loan
fast enough,

254
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,594
I can't get
an emergency loan
big enough.

255
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,562
All the scholarships
are way past due.

256
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,965
And I'd be lucky to get
two grand for my car.

257
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:30,602
A lot of people take
a year off to pay for college.
It's no big deal.

258
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,438
What do you know
about paying for college?
Hey, hey.

259
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,342
I'm sorry
my parents love me,
decided not to be poor.

260
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,344
Guys, everyone that
takes a year off

261
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,479
either moves home
or they lose momentum.

262
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:43,181
I'm not gonna
be that guy.

263
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,183
I'm going
to law school.

264
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,020
( Sighs )
Okay.

265
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,089
Okay.
Okay.

266
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,158
You know what?
Screw it.
Yes!

267
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,628
I don't really get it.
Well...

268
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,997
But, guys, how many more
chances are we gonna get

269
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,532
to steal from people
under false pretenses
as a family?

270
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,569
That's not really...
Huh? College, no parents.

271
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,971
I'm in.

272
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:09,173
And I know
Tyler's in.

273
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,975
No, I'm not in.
Tyler?

274
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,343
I couldn't live with myself
if we weren't giving

275
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,046
most of the money
to charity.
Okay.

276
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,448
You know that I don't
do public speaking.
That's fine.

277
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,284
We can give 20%
to a real charity.

278
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,120
Plus, we need
someone on sound.
Perfect. Pierce.

279
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:26,124
Sam! I do not
care about charities.
Not one bit.

280
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:28,993
But I will take
a percentage
of those profits.

281
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,529
Yes, you will. Perfect.
But, guys, listen.

282
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,265
If we're gonna
do this,

283
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,267
we're gonna need
to go all the way.

284
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,270
And I mean,
we're gonna need
some serious help.

285
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,073
( Clears throat )

286
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,077
Baker, you don't
think that...

287
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,112
Oh, I do think that.
I was hoping
you'd say that.

288
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,150
You are the worst
pledge trainer ever.

289
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:55,653
Certainly
the most handsome.
Thank you kindly.

290
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,224
Amen.

291
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,060
<i> ¶ I was tangled ¶</i>

292
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,962

297
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,481
It is. It's just
the craziest thing.
I know.

298
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,985
But then I thought about it,
and I realized, how could
I not get involved?

299
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:30,088
You know what I mean?
It's just a cause
so close to my heart.

300
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:33,291
Hey, could you just get,
like, two more jars
for table two?

301
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,060
Thanks, dude. Appreciate
all your hard work.
Hey, excuse me.

302
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:39,097
Sorry. Could you
just tell me who's
running this event?

303
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:41,466
Uh, yeah. I am.

304
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,368
Sorry. Hi.
I'm Sam.
Oh!

305
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,703
Oh, my gosh. Hi.
That's awesome.
How are you?

306
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,106
I actually worked
in Lesotho a few
summers ago.

307
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,575
No way. Wow. Wow.

308
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:54,078
What district
are you guys in?
I think it's game time.

309
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,648
Hello.
I wish I could
stick around.

310
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,185
I got to go
and do this show.
Sam!

311
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,488
Yikes. Yeah.
But, uh, yeah,

312
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,758
any questions you got,
just check your pamphlet.
Should break everything down.

313
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,761
No, no, no.
That's...
It's confusing.

314
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,563
( People applauding )

315
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,301
He has given us
so much,

316
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,771
and we think that
it's time to give
a little back.

317
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,106
Project
"get Wells soon"

318
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:25,476
would like to
challenge you
to give

319
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:30,081
in a way that reflects
the faith that you claim.

320
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,384
So, before you go
to the donation tables,

321
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,454
I want to ask you,

322
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,489
will you give today

323
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,558
for a better tomorrow?

324
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:45,496
Praise God.
Thank you all so much
for coming out!

325
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,498
We really appreciate it.

326
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,301
Please be careful
going home.

327
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,670
Good night!

328
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,849
I looked down,
and there were two
benjis sitting there.

329
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,851
No way.
So way.

330
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,821
I think we hit
the frickin' jackpot.

331
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,823
Hey, wake up,
you lucky bastard.

332
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,525
You are really
gonna graduate.
No, I am not.

333
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,628
No, no!

334
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,364
We got to help
these kids!

335
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,835
Saw that coming.

336
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,341
It's not enough.
It's not enough.
I couldn't agree more.

337
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:34,312
Ken Hopkins,
executive director,
cross country.

338
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,748
Good to meet you.
I've got to tell you,

339
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:42,687
I was out there listening,
and, boys, I was impressed.

340
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,356
I would like to--
( Sneezes )

341
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,758
Bless you.

342
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,129
Thank you.

343
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,332
I would like to take
you boys to dinner,

344
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,467
and I would like
to discuss

345
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,469
your future plans.

346
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:01,639
I have every intention
of putting you on
the national stage

347
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,876
to make all the money
you need for your charity.

348
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:07,378
I really want this
mission of yours

349
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,914
to succeed.

350
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,183
One dinner?

351
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:16,387
Ken:
27 cities, 27 shows.

352
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:19,323
We've been doing
cross country
for 15 years,

353
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:22,760
and we've seen
thousands of people
come to know Christ.

354
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:25,496
Last year,
the<i> holy herald </i>
ranked us

355
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,333
the second-most impactful
ministry in the country.

356
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,537
So why, uh...
Why us?

357
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:35,373
I absolutely love
what you guys are doing

358
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,708
with project
"get Wells soon,"

359
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,180
and I love you guys.
You're just...
Cool christians.

360
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,282
I am so sorry that
that took so long.

361
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:46,584
Hi, everyone.
Sit, please.

362
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,553
Ken:
Gentlemen, this is
Callie Edwards,

363
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,222
the best
tour coordinator
we ever had.

364
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:54,559
Callie ( Whispering ):
Hey, Joe's not gonna budge. He
said we could only afford one.

365
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,195
That's what I thought
would happen.

366
00:19:57,197 --> 00:20:00,231
Fellas,
here's the deal.

367
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,367
We can only afford
to offer you one
signing bonus,

368
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,337
but it is $15,000,
and we can cover

369
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,639
all of your food
and lodging expenses
while you're on tour.

370
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,677
"On tour"?
We would be doing
what, exactly?

371
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:15,913
Well, obviously,
you would be
getting donations,

372
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,516
but primarily
you'll be preaching.
Oh.

373
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:21,419
Uh, well, I'm not--

374
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,455
you're not-- yeah.
You're not doing that.

375
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,325
He's actually
our tech guy.

376
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,794
He's actually
interning with us
this year,

377
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,297
aren't you, Tyler?
But he's as much a part
of the team as anybody.

378
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,567
Tyler, are you
from South Africa?
What's that?

379
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,570
Quick question, Ken,

380
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,240
just because you had
mentioned fundraising--

381
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:46,010
how much money
could we expect to make?

382
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,246
Uh, for Africa?

383
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:50,014
Um...

384
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:52,416
Safely, quarter
of a million.

385
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,757
Now, I know you've probably
already discussed this,
but I'm curious.

386
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,693
We would love to hear more
about your work in Lesotho.

387
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,729
Ah.

388
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,999
Well, uh, yeah.

389
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,034
Uh, I mean,

390
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:13,404
really, uh, if you're
boiling it down,

391
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:15,773
if you're really
just...

392
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,776
Let's really look
at the base facts.

393
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,811
I mean, this is...

394
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,747
This is really
the lord's work,

395
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:25,650
wouldn't you say?
Amen.

396
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:27,718
Amen.

397
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,321
And you guys,
are you all set up

398
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,390
to handle your own
accounting for the...
Oh!

399
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,859
Well, yeah.
We recently
switched to a

400
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,894
quarterly based
accrual system,
right.

401
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,696
Which is going to...
Perfect.
Good enough.

402
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:41,065
Our only requirement
is that 100% go to
the mission work.

403
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,968
Sounds great.
Tyler: Yeah.

404
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,637
But we can't
actually, um...
We can't--

405
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,973
yeah, we can't
make a decision

406
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,609
without talking
it over first.

407
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:55,846
Right? This guy...

408
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:58,316
Would you mind if we just
discussed it real quick?

409
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,884
Oh, certainly.
Certainly.
Take a minute?

410
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,653
I've got tough
decisions of my own.

411
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,691
¶ Jesus ¶

412
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:09,860
so Callie's
a smoke shell.
Intern, huh?

413
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:13,030
Yeah, let me
just explain.

414
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,334
Uh, okay, guys?
I think we can do this.

415
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:18,869
Oh, absolutely.
Oh, he's joking.

416
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,738
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought I heard him say,

417
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,374
"quarter of
a million dollars."
You guys hear that?

418
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,844
What if project "get Wells soon"
was a legitimate nonprofit?

419
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,813
We can't do it.
Why?

420
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,782
You heard what the guy said:
100% percent of the proceeds...

421
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,118
Has to go to
the charity work.
Yeah, sure.

422
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,821
But I'm talking about cash.
They're gonna be keeping records
of the card swipes

423
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,890
and the checks,
but most of this money
is gonna be cash.

424
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:43,627
All I'm saying is,
at the end of every night,
we're adding up the total...

425
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,497
We just skim off the top.
No one's gonna know
the difference.

426
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,734
And then the rest,
we can give to
a legitimate charity.

427
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:52,970
I already know one.
It's called "living water."
This would really help them.

428
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,507
Real noble, Sam.
Will that bonus
top off your tuition?

429
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,876
I'm not even thinking
about that right now.

430
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,413
Okay, yeah, all right.
It would, okay?

431
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,081
But you guys got to
think bigger than this.

432
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:06,650
This could be great
for all of us.

433
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:10,521
Ty, I know you don't
want to be someone's
coffee bitch all summer.

434
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:12,690
Become an intern for
project "get Wells soon."

435
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,426
Baker, what are you
gonna do after graduation?

436
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,162
Huh? You want to
kill yourself at
someone's desk job,

437
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:21,599
or do you want to
get paid to come have
a wild time with us?

438
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:24,135
It's stealing.

439
00:23:24,137 --> 00:23:26,070
I don't know, Sam.

440
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,105
Baker, trust me.
Okay.

441
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:31,409
Pierce:
Guys, I think we can do
a lot of good with this one.

442
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,745
Okay, why are you
so into this?

443
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,481
Why do you always think
I have ulterior motives?

444
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:41,152
Huh? There's a lot of good
I want to do in this world.

445
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:44,488
Okay, full disclosure:
I lost all my summer
rent money.

446
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,891
If I ask my dad for
any more, he's gonna
make me work for him,

447
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,893
and I just
can't have that.

448
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,429
So technically,
it is my only option,

449
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,498
but it is a plan
I believe in.
It's a good plan.

450
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,467
Great plan.
Great plan.

451
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,837
Great plan.

452
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,840
Look, dude,
if you don't trust me,
if you're not feeling it,

453
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:05,142
that's fine,
I'll stop talking about it.

454
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,478
All I'm asking is,

455
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,613
give me one good reason
why the hell not.

456
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,883
Hell is why not. Sam!
Tyler, you--

457
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,023
come on, dude.

458
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,628
You'd better write me
one hell of a recommendation.

459
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,831
( All cheering )

460
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,936
<i> ( Music playing,</i>
<i> man singing indistinctly )</i>

461
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,289
<i> ( People cheering )</i>

462
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:31,795
Hey, could one of y'all
just turn off
the sun, please?

463
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,101
I heard you won
big last night.

464
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,005
Could I see
your bag real quick.

465
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,842
Callie:
I know I'm throwing
a lot at you guys,

466
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:47,611
but any questions you have
should be answered
in those packets.

467
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,613
Oh, um...

468
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,715
Those are just the tour
policies you agreed to.

469
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,218
You're strict about
the no-alcohol policy?
Definitely.

470
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,920
That's good, definitely.

471
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,656
Okay, so this will be
your typical green room.

472
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:02,026
This one kind of sucks,
but every place is different.

473
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:04,795
This is where we'll get
your makeup and microphone
on beforehand.

474
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,797
Guys, this is awesome.

475
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,800
Sam: Dude,
it's a microwave.
Yeah, but we've, like, made it.

476
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,703
( Gasps )
You guys are the guys!

477
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:14,038
Hey, we're the guys.

478
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,173
You're Sam, Baker,
Tyler, Pierce!

479
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,009
Oh, I totally
friend-requested
you guys last night.

480
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,779
I'm kind of the eyes
and ears backstage.

481
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,948
Hey, you might
want to change
your privacy setting.

482
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,184
Okay, I got three
wireless and a headset.
Who's running graphics?

483
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,219
That'd be me.
Sweet. Yeah, okay.

484
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:31,989
Be careful with those
rascals in the back.
They don't get out much.

485
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,692
Okay. You all know how
these work, right?

486
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:37,728
It's pretty simple.
You just hold this
button right here

487
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,830
and it turns on,
and to turn it on,
it's the same.

488
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:43,701
You just hold it.
It's great. And make sure
you don't mess that up.

489
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:46,036
Hey, Tyler, do you
want to go up to the booth
and meet the team?

490
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,038
Uh...
Do it, dude.

491
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,174
Go up to the booth, dude.
Yeah, that'd--

492
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:53,310
awesome. It was great
meeting you guys.
Seriously.

493
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,914
Bye, Yale.
Have fun in the booth.

494
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,382
Okay.

495
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,051
Let's just keep going
with this.

496
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,320
All right.
I like this guy.

497
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,322
Yale must be
a decaf man.

498
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,791
So this is
the best part

499
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,294
of our already
amazing tour, yes?

500
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,998
Um, you know what?
You guys should meet Gabriel.

501
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,866
He's the worship leader,

502
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,935
and his whole
band's here.

503
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,170
It's our only song.
It's not that hard.

504
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:22,206
Every moment
is a teaching moment.

505
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:26,710
Fellas!
This must be
the God squad.

506
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,278
Hey, Sam.
How are ya?

507
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,248
Hey, Gabriel, obviously.
Friends call me Gabe.

508
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,084
Let's keep it at
"Gabriel" for now.

509
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,919
Like the archangel.
That's cute.
What's that

510
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,354
so, uh, yeah--

511
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:40,724
oh, Gabriel's your--
that's your real name.

512
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:44,261
You weren't kidding.
No.

513
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:46,697
This is Gabriel,
the worship leader.

514
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:50,334
Well, now,
I wouldn't call
myself that.

515
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,771
I mean, my life
is worship,

516
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:56,807
and, uh, I am
a bit of a leader.

517
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,411
I see how that label
would fit, but, no, no.

518
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:04,214
No, I'm just
an artist.

519
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,819
Wow.
Yeah.

520
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,055
But I'm also really busy,
so I got to get back to it.

521
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,457
By the way,
big fan of you guys.
Love your work.

522
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:16,093
I mean, stay sweet.

523
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,429
Hey are we still
on for 8:00?
Yeah.

524
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,866
Can I talk to you
for a second?

525
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,970
Just two seconds.
Hey, scales, scales.

526
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,939
G-c-d.
G-c-d is for...

527
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,141
I mean, do you think
he still wakes up

528
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,177
watching vh-1?

529
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:35,179
Because the goo-goo doll--

530
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,314
whoa.

531
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,754
<i> ( Guitar strumming,</i>
<i> people cheering )</i>

532
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:05,008
¶ Jesus ¶

533
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,012
¶ Jesus ¶

534
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,482
¶ Jesus ¶

535
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:14,051
¶ Jesus ¶

536
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,856
all I'm saying is,
just know your talking points
before you go in there.

537
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,324
Dude, relax.
You're over-thinking it.

538
00:29:20,326 --> 00:29:23,160
All I got to do is walk out,
say a couple verses,

539
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:25,763
teach the word
of the lord.
No, dude,

540
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:29,066
the only thing you
should be focusing on is
having an emotional response.

541
00:29:29,068 --> 00:29:32,202
Yeah, don't go out there
and try to teach

542
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,104
what you don't understand.

543
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,106
It's fine.
It's covered. Seriously.

544
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,042
Baker, you're talking about
the problems in Lesotho.

545
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,512
Pierce, you are...
Gonna show 'em
how to fix 'em.

546
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:42,913
Exactly.

547
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:45,182
What do you
need from me?

548
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:47,518
Uh, nothing.

549
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,853
Just do your thing
in the booth.

550
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:52,322
I will take care
of the rest.

551
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,094
Ten bucks says we don't
make it through this show.

552
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:59,463
Twenty.
Guys, guys, okay.

553
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,300
Ready to have some fun?

554
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,838
All right. This is it.

555
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,007
Battle stations, everybody.
Now transitioning

556
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,544
from the charity portion
into the message sequence.

557
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,479
All hands on slides.

558
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,882
Plus, we're saving lives.

559
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:23,453
I mean, how neat is that?

560
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,192
Ladies and gentlemen,
a man who

561
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:32,262
needs no introduction,
Mr. Sam atwell.

562
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,598
( Music plays,
tepid applause )

563
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,936
Yeah!

564
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:41,071
This place is dead.

565
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,842
Wow!

566
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,978
Praise God!

567
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,347
Praise God!
Am I right, Atlanta?

568
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,482
( Smattering of applause )

569
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,354
My name is Sam atwell,

570
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:01,992
and welcome to
cross country.

571
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:05,963
Tonight, I, uh,

572
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,632
I want to talk to you

573
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,501
about God's plan for you.

574
00:31:11,503 --> 00:31:15,405
I think the big
question is,

575
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,407
was Jesus really

576
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:20,244
walking on water here?

577
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,613
No. No.

578
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:25,182
This is obviously
a story--

579
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:27,251
a story--

580
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,519
a story to represent

581
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,256
these moments
when the fear

582
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:37,127
and-and... and, uh--

583
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:39,196
I mean, yes,

584
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:42,466
we all know that Jesus
did walk on water.

585
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,369
He can do that.
We know that.

586
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,038
But I think the question
we have to ask

587
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,474
is why? Why?

588
00:31:50,476 --> 00:31:54,511
You don't think that God
couldn't have just
sent a row boat?

589
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,947
"Row boat"?
What the hell
is he talking about?

590
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,449
My best guess,

591
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,618
uh--

592
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,422
that is, uh--

593
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,224
that's--

594
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,563
move over.
Yeah.

595
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:15,399
Danica, switch
the lights to cyan

596
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,501
and bring them up
to 70% on my count.

597
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:19,503
Camera, get me some
ambient guitar.

598
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:22,439
This is
the master, right?
Yeah, yeah.

599
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,541
All right.
Everybody ready?

600
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,593
But you know what
more than that?

601
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,565
More than that...

602
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,204
I believe that God has

603
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,708
amazing plans
for your life.

604
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:03,447
Do you believe that?

605
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,117
I believe

606
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,219
that God wants to

607
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,356
change the world

608
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:15,125
through the christians
in this room.

609
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:20,097
Do you believe that?

610
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,466
I believe--
I believe that,

611
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,135
through project
"get well soon,"

612
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:29,039
we can make
the water crisis history.

613
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:34,144
But do you
believe that?

614
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:37,247
If you believe
that God

615
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:40,717
still does miracles,

616
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:44,788
I'm gonna ask you to
join us in our efforts.

617
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,793
Will you give today

618
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,063
for a better tomorrow?

619
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:56,166
And as the ushers
are coming forward,
all I ask,

620
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:59,403
all I ask is that
you just--

621
00:33:59,405 --> 00:34:02,606
just give in a way
that reflects the faith
that you claim.

622
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,794
( No audible dialogue )

623
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,548
Looks like they had
over $1,000 in that bag.

624
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,517
I can't believe it.
Hey, you saved
our ass out there.

625
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,221
Congratulations
on your first show,
you guys.

626
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,490
Callie, you had us thinking
there was a no-alcohol policy.

627
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:56,126
Oh, yeah, this is
all non-alcoholic.

628
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:59,796
Do you guys throw
a party like this
after every show?

629
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,232
Yeah, pretty much.

630
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,668
We try to plan fun things
for the whole tour.

631
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,403
This should be on
all of your lanyards.

632
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:09,573
I took a closer
look at the song,

633
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:13,310
and I realized,
"this is supposed
to be about Jesus,

634
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,513
so what are all
those other words
doing in there?"

635
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,484
Ken:
Ladies and gentlemen,

636
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:24,588
congratulations on
a successful first show!

637
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:27,457
Ow!
Hey! Hey-hey!

638
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,160
Whoo!

639
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:34,698
Honestly, I couldn't have
asked for a better way
to kick off the tour.

640
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,601
I think we have
a few kinks to work out.

641
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,504
Gabriel, we have to see
if we can get you

642
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:43,373
to quit preaching sermons
between every song.

643
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,576
Hey, okay.
All right.
Take it easy.

644
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:50,347
But seriously,
you guys were very
flexible and considerate,

645
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,549
and I couldn't be
more proud.

646
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:55,252
If we keep this up,
we really will be

647
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:57,621
the most impactful
ministry

648
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,756
in the nation.

649
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,930
Now, as we wind down
the first

650
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,166
of many celebrations
to come,

651
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,169
I'd like to get someone
to close us in prayer.

652
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:16,473
And who better than
our very own God squad.
What-- God--

653
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:22,712
Baker, would you mind?

654
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:25,282
All right, guys.
Look, I'm sorry!

655
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:29,252
Bake, half of your prayer was
ripped from<i> Jerry mcguire.</i>

656
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,656
No! No, I was saying
the-the-the lord's prayer.

657
00:36:32,658 --> 00:36:35,859
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, Sam, do we have
a tax I.D. Number?

658
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,928
Um, yeah,
I got it right here.

659
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,230
All right,
and don't let me forget
to have you sign this.

660
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,465
Mm-hmm.
How much do you
want to report?

661
00:36:42,467 --> 00:36:44,701
Uh...
Hey, guys,

662
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,537
I think we did
pretty good.

663
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,814
Yeah, we're gonna need
a bigger bag.

664
00:36:57,816 --> 00:37:00,450
Bake, you brought
that extra bag, right?

665
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,686
Yeah.
Wait,
hold on, guys.

666
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:06,990
We aren't really gonna
carry this around like
drug dealers, are we?

667
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:09,960
Uh, Tyler, it's just
like you said--

668
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:12,996
we can't deposit the money
because technically
it doesn't exist.

669
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,866
Okay.
Hey, hold on,
hold on

670
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,836
just one second, Baker,
before you get into that.

671
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,906
Guys, real talk--

672
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:26,643
I would've blown it
for us tonight if it
hadn't been for Tyler.

673
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,913
I really would've.
And I can't
ignore the fact

674
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:33,516
that we might be a little
in over our heads,

675
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:36,920
but all we got to do
is just get through
this tour,

676
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:40,790
and if we're going to be
playing Sunday school
for the next two months,

677
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,293
we got a lot of
homework to do.

678
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,331
<i> The goal is</i>
<i> to blend in,</i>

679
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,467
<i> but to do that,</i>
<i> we're gonna have to learn</i>

680
00:37:50,469 --> 00:37:53,370
<i> everything we can</i>
<i> about these people.</i>

681
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,405
<i> How do they worship?</i>

682
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,741
<i> What are their mannerisms?</i>

683
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,776
<i> What do they like to</i>
<i> eat and drink?</i>

684
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,312
<i> How do they pray?</i>

685
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:05,949
<i> What do</i>
<i> christians love to wear?</i>
<i> What's their sense of humor?</i>

686
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:10,020
<i> Do they have any hobbies</i>
<i> other than God?</i>

687
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:13,757
<i> How do they socialize?</i>
<i> How do they interact?</i>

688
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:16,326
<i> We all need to read up</i>
<i> on some Bible stories,</i>

689
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,628
<i> maybe even memorize</i>
<i> a few verses.</i>

690
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:23,066
<i> If we can do that,</i>
<i> we're good.</i>

691
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:25,602
<i> We're gonna get together</i>
<i> every night</i>

692
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,704
<i> and teach each other.</i>

693
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,773
<i> Sound good?</i>

694
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,008
<i> Let's get to work.</i>

695
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,645
All right. Yeah!
Yeah!

696
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,049
Who's ready to
worship and pray? Okay.
Worship and pray.

697
00:38:39,051 --> 00:38:41,885
Starting off
with worship,
this is basically

698
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:45,055
the best way to
advertise your faith.

699
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,590
And from what I can tell
so far, there are four

700
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:50,593
essential
hand-raising techniques.

701
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:53,363
First one--

702
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,931
the gecko.

703
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,067
It's just hands
by the side,
palms open.

704
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,369
( Inhales )

705
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,404
Just going for God,
like this.

706
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,473
This one's really good
for blending in,

707
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:05,475
'cause no one can tell
if you're worshiping or not.

708
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:07,777
It's just like this.
Could go either way.

709
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,412
Your mom could...

710
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:11,614
Play it out,
play it out.

711
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:15,018
Your mom could--
whenever she--
stop. You're dead.

712
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,420
Second--

713
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,422
call this one
"casual five."

714
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,025
One hand in the pocket,
one hand up in the air.

715
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:25,829
High-fiving God.
Subtle. Simple.

716
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:28,098
The next one:
The straightjacket.

717
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,534
This is very, very, simple.
You're literally gonna hug

718
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,837
yourself.

719
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,438
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

720
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,941
I recommend this one
when worship goes acoustic.

721
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:40,610
I don't need to hug
anybody else?
It's just me?

722
00:39:40,612 --> 00:39:42,579
Last but not least,

723
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,914
my favorite--

724
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,551
the Shawshank.
Now, this one,

725
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,654
this is a little intense--
maybe too intense.

726
00:39:51,656 --> 00:39:54,724
Do we jump up and down
while Shawshank-ing?
No.

727
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,060
How do you know?
Right? No. Please.

728
00:39:57,062 --> 00:40:00,397
Look, again,
if the situation calls for it,
if everyone's going to town,

729
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:02,399
I recommend

730
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:05,402
just little calf raises,
balls of your feet.

731
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:09,072
You don't want to force it.
You don't want to be Shawshank
in a room full of geckos.

732
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,141
Got it? Okay.

733
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:13,143
Let's talk about prayer.

734
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,979
The idea is
to say these words

735
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:19,616
as many times as is
humanly possible
within one prayer.

736
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:22,986
Oh, and the word "just,:
This is your saving grace.

737
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:26,823
This the crutch word.
Sprinkle this in anywhere.

738
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:30,160
Other ingredients
include metaphors,
self-degradation--

739
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,628
very popular.

740
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,765
Dramatic pauses.
Pierce:
That's nice.

741
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,901
What is?
I saw what
he did there.

742
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:40,904
What'd he do?
And also, of course,
old English.

743
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,772
Got that one?
And as long
as you finish

744
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,442
with an "amen"
or an "ah-men,"
you're solid.

745
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,710
Questions?

746
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:50,980
And that's how messed up
everything is in Africa.

747
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,918
Let's pray.

748
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,023
Father God,

749
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,858
lord,

750
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,528
Jesus Christ,
God,

751
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,730
father,

752
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,133
we ask that you just

753
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:14,037
break our sinful hearts
and just...

754
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,639
Just...

755
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,908
Just help us.

756
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:23,079
Please help us
help you...

757
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,548
Help Africa.

758
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,551
Okay? Please?

759
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,691
Okay. Now, when we're
done highlighting,

760
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:38,561
we're gonna dip it
into the water to give it
that distressed look.

761
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:41,197
While these dry,
let's talk vernacular.

762
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,900
Now, the first thing
you need to know
is that christians

763
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:46,636
hate swear words
but love swearing.

764
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,072
If you want to swear
like a Christian,
you either

765
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:52,809
spell out the word
or make it into a letter.

766
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:57,247
"F" that.
Exactly. This'll help you sound
edgy while you're preaching.

767
00:41:57,249 --> 00:41:59,816
All you have to do
is preface it with
something like,

768
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:03,786
"now, I know I might
get in trouble
for this, but..."

769
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:06,856
Sam:
So here's this guy,

770
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:11,227
and he's traveling around,
persecuting christians.

771
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:14,163
Now, I know I'm gonna get
an e-mail about this,

772
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,767
but he's being
kind of an a-hole.

773
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:22,005
Am I right?
He is.

774
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,908
But this is the thing--
and I'm gonna keep going
back to this point--

775
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,876
Baker:
Granola bars.
Sam: No.

776
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,947
Fast food.
It depends on
how much you spend.

777
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,249
What about pie?
Now we're talking desserts.

778
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:36,119
If the dessert is part
of the meal, it's probably
already been prayed for.

779
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:40,023
If the dessert is the meal,
best bet's to pray for it.

780
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:44,027
And then I said,
"what's a calvinist doing
in a buffet line?"

781
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,129
Whoa.
Allow me,
all right?

782
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,965
Heavenly father,
thank you for
blessing us...

783
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:56,272
Bartender, can I get

784
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,274
two Shirley temples,
hold the fruit?

785
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,209
Gabriel:
Check it out.

786
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:02,579
It's Hebrew.

787
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,981
What?
Hebrew.

788
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:07,684
It's an ancient language.

789
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:11,020
What does it mean?
I'm not sure.

790
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,089
So, uh, how long

791
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,658
have you
and Gabriel been...

792
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,194
You and Gabriel?

793
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,930
Um, like, a year.

794
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,232
Wow.
That's something.
Yeah.

795
00:43:23,234 --> 00:43:25,034
Actually,
he's been talking

796
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:27,971
about starting his own
nonprofit someday,

797
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:31,207
and I think
that's great.
That's great. Yeah.

798
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,676
It is great.

799
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,380
Great.
Baker:
Who is it?

800
00:43:37,382 --> 00:43:40,283
Don't worry about it.
Do you have somewhere
to be?

801
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,151
Uh, no.

802
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:45,054
It's nothing.
It's just a guy.

803
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,361
Were you just
drinking surge?

804
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:54,097
Okay.
He's trying to
quit dipping.

805
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,933
Stained-glass windows,
organ players,
church hymnals--

806
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:59,302
all these things
are dead.

807
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,839
Christians have traded
them out for smoke machines,
hipster fashions,

808
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:04,273
and fair-trade coffee.

809
00:44:04,275 --> 00:44:06,709
Now, with this change comes
new revenue streams,

810
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,746
including,
and most importantly,
Christian apparel.

811
00:44:09,748 --> 00:44:13,650
Which is why I propose
we start a clothing line,
and we're gonna call it...

812
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:18,755
"Cross dressing."

813
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,762
Pierce, don't give me--
I like it.

814
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:28,164
Really?
Yeah.

815
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,001
Thank you. Every t-shirt
that Yale kid wears has

816
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,203
has a Christian brand name
or positive slogan,

817
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,840
so if we come up with our own
name or message, we'll kill it
with merchandise.

818
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:41,377
You know what I say
about little African babies,

819
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,413
like ( Indistinct ),

820
00:44:43,415 --> 00:44:48,051
who's born in the filth
with flies in his face,

821
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:51,354
nothing to drink
but dirty sewer water,
and I think,

822
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:53,990
not on my watch.

823
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,425
Yeah.

824
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:58,394
Not on my watch!

825
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,430
Not on my watch!

826
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:03,700
( All cheering )
Not on my watch!

827
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:05,334
All chanting:
Not on my watch!

828
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:07,170
Show me the money!

829
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:09,105
Not on my watch!

830
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,716
Cross dressing's all about
making a statement.

831
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:23,019
"Abstinence is bad-a!"
( Whooping )

832
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,488
Yeah, it's looking
at you, kid!
Right in the face!

833
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,491
"F Satan!"

834
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,294
Yeah!
Look at that, girl!

835
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,932
( Men chuckling )

836
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,237
Okay, now,
to the left.

837
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,743
One more time
to the right.

838
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:03,793
So what does he do?
He goes crawling around,

839
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:06,362
all around the desert,
only to fall plumb

840
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:08,865
smack-dab in the middle
of quicksand!

841
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,801
Ladies and gentlemen,
we can get this baby

842
00:46:11,803 --> 00:46:13,836
out of the quicksand!

843
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,107
Sam:
Brothers,

844
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,209
I only ask you
one question:

845
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,348
God may love you,

846
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,952
but does he like you?

847
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,207
Ken:
All right. Good morning.

848
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,076
Hey.

849
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,577
( Mouths word )

850
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:03,946
Shall we?

851
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,950
Let's join hands.

852
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,021
Heavenly father,

853
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:14,290
we thank you for
this wonderful day,

854
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:17,994
and thank you for
all the blessings

855
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,296
that you've given us.

856
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:23,232
Father--
father God--

857
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,135
as we live out
this day,
what are you doing tonight?

858
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:28,671
Please remind us
of all your
unyielding love

859
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,640
and endless grace.

860
00:48:30,642 --> 00:48:34,010
Got to come get some barbecue
with us when we're in Austin.

861
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:37,346
I'll try.
,..As we head
to Austin.

862
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:38,915
It's kind of
non-negotiable.

863
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:41,484
...that you continue to
build this ministry up,

864
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:45,388
that we would fulfill
your calling

865
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,324
to be the biggest
faith event
in the whole world.

866
00:48:48,326 --> 00:48:51,027
Let me talk to Gabriel,
and maybe we can
meet up with you guys.

867
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,663
Yeah?

868
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:55,398
Amen.

869
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,999
All: Amen.
All right.

870
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,601
I'm sure most of you
know about

871
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:01,504
the recent tragedy
in Zambia,
the earthquake,

872
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:04,307
and as we pair up,

873
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:07,443
pray for the victims
of that tragedy

874
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,279
and that God's name
be praised throughout.

875
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,982
And be ready to leave
for Austin at 1:00.

876
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:14,717
Break it up.

877
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:25,194
Sam, would you like to be
prayer partners with me?

878
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,037
Do you want to--
dear lord,

879
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,740
first of all,
I want to thank you
for this day

880
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,509
and for all
the blessings

881
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,012
that you've
given us.

882
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,147
Father God, in all this
tour craziness,

883
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,317
I want to pray
for Sam.

884
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,454
I pray that
you stop anyone
and anything

885
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:54,256
that might distract him
from helping people

886
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,759
reach you.

887
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:01,030
Father, throw out
all temptation,

888
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,101
and please give me
the courage

889
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:09,205
to do whatever
is necessary to
hold him accountable.

890
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,575
Oh, and I want to echo

891
00:50:12,577 --> 00:50:16,145
what Ken said earlier
about Zimbabwe.

892
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,114
Amen.

893
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,019
Sam, would you
like to pray?

894
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:25,354
Did I--
did I do something?

895
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,356
Good chat.

896
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:30,659
Tyler:
Oh, no, man.

897
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,496
Sam, you have to
stay away from her,
all right?

898
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:36,332
The last thing we need
is that guy running around
playing detective.

899
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,367
I got it.
Because if he figures out
about the bag--

900
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,369
I said I got it.

901
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,471
Okay, I'm almost
ready for you.

902
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:45,207
Sam, Brent's
almost ready for you.

903
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,743
All right, look.
We have to do something
with that bag.

904
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:51,380
Get it out of here.
Maybe we should drop it
at the house before--

905
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,816
no. Yeah.

906
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,085
Check one.

907
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,755
Check one, check one.
Keep going.

908
00:50:59,757 --> 00:51:02,291
Sam, he's not
getting anything!
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

909
00:51:02,293 --> 00:51:06,162
Check, one, two.
I swear, I can never
get this thing.

910
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:08,831
It always sticks.
Check one.

911
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:10,833
You got something?

912
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,668
Uh, hi, I'm Sam atwell.

913
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,538
Hello.
This is Tyler.
We're good.

914
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,742
We're good? Good.
Are we good?

915
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:24,680
( Scoffs )
All right.
Tyler.

916
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:28,184
No, you know what?
Just stay focused, Sam.

917
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:29,652
Okay?

918
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:32,588
Hey, Sam, hey.

919
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,623
I need to check
the pickups
in your mic.

920
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:37,393
Yeah, it's fine,
it's fine.

921
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,628
That's what I thought too,
but the pickups--
let me just...

922
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,730
Yale, it's fine.
I said I got it.

923
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,566
I can handle it.
Okay?

924
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:47,503
Yale:
Yeah, you can
handle it.

925
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:50,372
( Indistinct )

926
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:53,509
Hey, you know what?
You could lighten up
a little bit.

927
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:57,813
We're putting on
a pretty amazing show.
It's not just a show anymore.

928
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:01,117
Hey. Hey, Sam.
Hey!

929
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,219
How are you?
Fantastic, thank you.

930
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:06,655
I just had to tell you
how truly inspired

931
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:08,791
I have been by
your last two sermons.

932
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,627
That's great, dude.
That's awesome. Thanks.
I appreciate it.

933
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,730
Hey, Sam...
Yeah?

934
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:17,800
I think God wants me
to go to Africa.

935
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:20,703
Just forget about school.
Drop everything here

936
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,139
and just go.

937
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:27,243
I know there are missionaries
leaving from Houston
in a few days.

938
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:31,247
I understand that money
may be a huge issue
and everything, but...

939
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:34,583
I just had to ask you,

940
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,354
how do you know
what it is that God
wants you to do?

941
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,691
Well, I mean,

942
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:46,795
if you think about it,
why wouldn't God want you
to go to Africa, you know?

943
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:49,365
I say if you feel

944
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:51,634
in your heart that
God's calling you
to do that,

945
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:53,802
just go for it, dude.

946
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:56,805
Yes, yes, yes!
Definitely.

947
00:52:56,807 --> 00:53:00,242
I-- I just wish that
God would just pick up
the phone, you know,

948
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:02,411
and give me a call
and tell me what to do,

949
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:06,282
but maybe if
you wouldn't mind
praying for me.

950
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,617
Of course, dude. Yeah.
I'd really appreciate that.

951
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:11,687
I would really, really
really appreciate that.
I got to get back to the booth.

952
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,722
Okay.
Thank you, guys.
Thank you, thank you.

953
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:16,258
Hey, congratulations.

954
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,728
You're awesome.
Thanks.

955
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,571
Baker:
What's up, you d.B.?
What up?

956
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,506
Brought you all some
breakfast taquitos.

957
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:33,275
Hey, guys, you got to read
some of these fan letters.

958
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:35,778
"Dearest God squad,
you are my heroes,

959
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,247
and I'd love to
make your sidekick.
Unrighteousness?"

960
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:42,651
All: Not on my watch.
Four exclamation marks.

961
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:44,587
What the hell is that?
Ty, you got to
check these out.

962
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,422
What?

963
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,358
Why did you
do that?
What?

964
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,729
Oh, you d--
you didn't see how
excited that kid was?

965
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,931
That kid's name
is Cameron.

966
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:58,801
And you can't just push
a decision like that on
someone you don't know.

967
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:01,704
I'm not pushing anything
on anyone, okay?

968
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,672
I'm just-- he--

969
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,941
he believes that God
wants him to go to Africa.

970
00:54:05,943 --> 00:54:09,778
I can't help if he's convicted.
That's not my fault.
Are you kidding me?

971
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,681
You keep saying you're
supporting people who believe
in God, but you're not.

972
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:15,951
All you're doing is
pushing God on people
that believe in you.

973
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,587
You have to chill, okay?
I'm not doing anything

974
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:22,324
except saying what
people expect me to say--
that's it.

975
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:26,262
And if people want to
give money to a good cause,
what's so bad about--

976
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:28,731
what we're taking is
worse than their money.

977
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,833
You just turned Cameron's
life upside down

978
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,835
for something you don't
even believe in.

979
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:35,371
It doesn't matter
if I believe it,
if you believe it.

980
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,940
It doesn't matter
if any of us believe it.
We're here to facilitate--

981
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:41,677
no, we're here because
you got backed into a corner.
That is it.

982
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,846
That's it, man.

983
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,816
It was you that
needed them,

984
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,019
not the other
way around.

985
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:53,822
Let me get this straight.
So you think that Cameron
shouldn't go to Africa?

986
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:56,458
You think that
christians shouldn't make

987
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,827
the world
a better place,
is that right?

988
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:00,963
Not if they're doing it
for bullshit reasons.
It's not bullshit to Cameron.

989
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:04,933
He believes in Jesus.
Why does that bother
you so much?

990
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:06,935
He only believes it
because people like you

991
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,937
stand on that stage
and sell it to him.

992
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:10,939
He doesn't know any better
than to buy it.

993
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:13,409
Hey, Tyler,
chill out, man.

994
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:16,045
Just simmer down.
Sam:
Guys, we're all tired.

995
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:18,881
We're all stressed.
We've been on the road
a long time.

996
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,850
Okay? Look,
what I want you to do--
I'm done.

997
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:23,319
What?

998
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,321
I'm done, man.

999
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,489
What do you mean?
I'm not doing
this anymore.

1000
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,959
I can't do this
anymore.

1001
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,062
And, guys, maybe
we don't have to.

1002
00:55:33,064 --> 00:55:35,631
Maybe we can just
leave the tour.

1003
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:38,934
We all heard about
the earthquakes
in Zambia, right?

1004
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:41,103
And Cameron was just
telling us about
some missionaries

1005
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:43,572
that are going there
in the next few days.

1006
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:47,076
We could just go to Ken
and tell him that God
called us there.

1007
00:55:47,078 --> 00:55:50,079
How could he
argue with that?

1008
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:53,415
We made enough money,
and the time to get out
couldn't be better.

1009
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,718
( Ringing )

1010
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,953
What's going on
in Zambia?

1011
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,689
( Ringing continues )
Don't worry about
Zambia, Baker.

1012
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,791
We're not going to Zambia.
We're not going to Zambia.

1013
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:05,361
'Cause there's plenty
of money to be had
right here.

1014
00:56:05,363 --> 00:56:08,397
For once, this is
the perfect time for you
to quit while you're ahead.

1015
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:11,133
I didn't ask for your opinion.
I'm not lying to
these people anymore.

1016
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:14,737
Good, then leave, get out.
You just forfeit your share
for somebody else.

1017
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:17,373
Okay? Go find some
other internship.

1018
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,475
Why don't you think about
someone other than yourself
for a second?

1019
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,544
Quiet!
( Phone stops ringing )

1020
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,081
No one's leaving.

1021
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,484
We're gonna finish
what we started.

1022
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,621
Works for me, Sam.

1023
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:35,891
Okay?

1024
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,527
Tyler? Tyler!

1025
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,463
Sam,

1026
00:56:41,465 --> 00:56:44,099
I am not trying to put
you guys in a tough spot,

1027
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:48,804
but tonight is
my last show, man.

1028
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:52,408
And if y'all want to
keep going, then...

1029
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:57,112
Well, then,
that's on you.

1030
00:56:57,114 --> 00:56:59,014
It's on me?

1031
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:00,582
Hold on. Tyler.

1032
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,518
Tyler!

1033
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:07,189
( Phone ringing )

1034
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:36,151
<i> ( Woman singing )</i>

1035
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,043
( No audible dialogue )

1036
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:29,037
So I know this is
just the worst timing.

1037
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,240
Oh, no, no. No.

1038
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,542
I understand.
I do.

1039
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:36,879
Well, these are the total
donations from Dallas,

1040
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:39,648
and Sam will be coordinating
with our offices

1041
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,617
for the remaining shows.

1042
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,254
Well, fantastic.
We sure will miss you
around here.

1043
00:58:45,256 --> 00:58:47,656
Thank you
for everything,

1044
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,725
and God bless you.

1045
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,166
( Bell dings,
door opens )

1046
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:01,703
Hey.
( Shouts )

1047
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:05,774
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?

1048
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:08,977
I'm sorry.
Thanks for that.
I really appreciate it.

1049
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:11,313
What are you doing?
What's up?

1050
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:13,649
Awesome job tonight.

1051
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:15,617
That was...
That was...

1052
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:18,754
Oh, high five. Okay.
I'm going for it. Yep.

1053
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:22,024
So, Gabriel has
to meet with Ken
about something,

1054
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:25,794
and I think it's gonna
be a while, but...

1055
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:29,264
I would still be up for
hanging out with you guys
if you want.

1056
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:31,600
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:59:31,602 --> 00:59:35,571
Uh, I don't know if
the guys are gonna be
able to make it anymore,

1058
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,072
so...
That's fine.

1059
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,608
But I'm still happy to

1060
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,310
show you the city
if you want.

1061
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:44,179
Uh...
I'd be up for it.

1062
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,014
Yeah.
Yeah?

1063
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:48,083
Yeah, sure.
Are you ready now?

1064
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,986
The trailer park's
just down the street.
( Laughing ) Okay.

1065
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:54,056
Wait, what?

1066
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:57,759
Honestly, I spent
more time playing soccer

1067
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,962
with the kids than
I ever did teaching.
Yeah?

1068
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:03,332
Yeah.
Why am I not surprised?

1069
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:05,067
Here, I want you
to see them.

1070
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:08,103
Oh, wow.

1071
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,973
Oh, he's a good-looking guy.
I know.

1072
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:13,175
He's strapping.
( Laughs )

1073
01:00:15,311 --> 01:00:17,779
Hey, I know
you hear this enough,

1074
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,848
but I have to say it:

1075
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:23,151
You're really
making a difference
over there.

1076
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:30,225
It's just, it matters,

1077
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,927
that's all.

1078
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,898
He's a cool kid.

1079
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,067
Mm-hmm.

1080
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,905
You really miss
Lesotho, huh?

1081
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,807
Yeah.

1082
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,744
How come
you came back?

1083
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:57,185
I wanted people here
to know Jesus too.

1084
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:59,354
You know,
I wanted them

1085
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,356
to come to things
like this and not miss

1086
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,860
the whole point
of it all.

1087
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,765
I don't know.
I just...

1088
01:01:09,767 --> 01:01:11,733
I'm not sure

1089
01:01:11,735 --> 01:01:14,803
if I've really
changed anything.

1090
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,674
Callie,

1091
01:01:18,676 --> 01:01:21,810
you are not
responsible

1092
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:24,413
for changing
everybody.

1093
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:27,082
You can't be.
Yeah.

1094
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:29,217
The truth is,

1095
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:31,887
some of these people
are gonna show up,

1096
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:34,823
and they're gonna miss
the point of it all,
they just are.

1097
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:38,760
But, you got to believe
that these events

1098
01:01:38,762 --> 01:01:43,065
inspire hope,
and that is better
than being hopeless.

1099
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,235
That's something.

1100
01:01:47,237 --> 01:01:49,971
I guess I just
feel like

1101
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:52,874
if your hope's
not in Jesus,

1102
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:54,710
then....

1103
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:57,079
Maybe you are hopeless.

1104
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,451
Don't you?

1105
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,176
( Phone ring tone )

1106
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,882
Hey.
Hey, good morning.

1107
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:36,084
<i> Good morning.</i>

1108
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:39,454
<i> You sound tired.</i>

1109
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:42,958
You weren't driving some
poor girl around the city
till 1:00 A.M., were you?

1110
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,027
Hey, uh, do you want to
grab breakfast with me
or something?

1111
01:02:46,029 --> 01:02:49,297
( Knock on door )
<i> I just, uh...</i>

1112
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,900
I just wanted to talk
to you about something.

1113
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:54,770
Hold on a second.
Can you hold on?

1114
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,306
Hey.
Hey.

1115
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:00,008
You got a sec?

1116
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,819
Hey, did Baker sleep
in here last night?

1117
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:12,320
Uh, I don't know.

1118
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,990
Where is he?

1119
01:03:14,992 --> 01:03:16,992
I think he went to
some party near campus,

1120
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:19,828
but I'm not sure.

1121
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,997
Where are you going?
<i>Okay, that sounds fine.</i>

1122
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:24,900
What's that?
<i> I said that sounds fine.</i>

1123
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:27,002
Uh, great, okay.

1124
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:29,905
Why don't I
meet you downstairs
at a quarter till?

1125
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:33,575
<i> Okay. </i>
Okay,
see you in a bit.

1126
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:36,077
Hey, have you seen
my keys anywhere?

1127
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,813
Uh, no.

1128
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:39,815
What are you doing?

1129
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:43,451
Uh, big Russ got
a glimpse of my
credit card statement

1130
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,453
showing where my
allowance money went,

1131
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,989
so he said I got
48 hours to get it
back to him,

1132
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,158
or I'm gonna have
to work for him
to pay it off.

1133
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,495
So I'm gonna need
my share of the cash.

1134
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:57,866
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna need
to talk to you about that.
What's up?

1135
01:03:57,868 --> 01:04:00,902
I think we should
give the money back.

1136
01:04:00,904 --> 01:04:02,504
That's great.

1137
01:04:02,506 --> 01:04:05,240
I think we should give it
to a real charity.
Uh-huh.

1138
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:09,177
I'm serious.
Look, I get that
this was my idea.

1139
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,081
I get that. I get
that I said it didn't
matter where the money went,

1140
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,917
because it's not about
money to these people,
and it's probably not,

1141
01:04:15,919 --> 01:04:18,587
but there's a whole other
group of people

1142
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:21,289
that are just dying,
hold on.

1143
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:23,558
And that depend
on this money
just to survive.

1144
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,362
I can't-- we got to
do the right thing here.

1145
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,398
Sam, that's just not
gonna work for me.

1146
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,635
Pierce, just--
just listen for a second.
That's not happening.

1147
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:36,338
Sam, you make decisions
based off what's right for you.

1148
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,609
Okay? And that's fine.
That's what everybody does.

1149
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:43,879
But you're not the authority
on what is right
and what is wrong.

1150
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,881
You do whatever you want
with your share, okay?

1151
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:47,916
Give it away.
I don't care.

1152
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:51,152
Just don't all of
a sudden pretend like
you're some good guy

1153
01:04:51,154 --> 01:04:53,255
I'm not acting like
because you had
a conviction last night.

1154
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:56,191
I'm a good guy,
I just--
anyone would agree

1155
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:58,126
that this is
wrong, okay?
No shit.

1156
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:00,228
No shit, Einstein.

1157
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,265
Where was this
four months ago?

1158
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:07,068
Huh? Wasn't so obvious
when you needed the money.

1159
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,537
And now I'm in a bind,

1160
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,674
and you just leave me
hanging to dry?

1161
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:15,911
I'm not leaving you
out to dry, okay?
That's just unreal!

1162
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:19,514
You talk about doing
the right thing. Why stop
at giving the money back?

1163
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,516
Why don't you
stand there on stage,

1164
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:23,952
tell those thousands
of people you lied to
who you really are.

1165
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:27,689
Maybe I should!
Mm-hmm, but you won't.

1166
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,527
'Cause you only tell the truth
when it's convenient...

1167
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,529
To you.

1168
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:37,165
So do whatever
you want with your share,

1169
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,636
but I'm taking mine.

1170
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,581
Thank you.

1171
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,461
We got a problem.

1172
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,564
He's just trying
to freak us out.
He's doing a pretty good job.

1173
01:06:09,566 --> 01:06:12,567
Tyler wouldn't take--
we don't know that!
Find him, okay?

1174
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:15,036
All right.
Where are you going?
Just meet me at the house.

1175
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:17,172
And find out
where Baker is!
All right, all right.

1176
01:06:17,174 --> 01:06:19,441
These guys have been
pretending to be christians

1177
01:06:19,443 --> 01:06:22,310
so they can scam
money off people.
What?

1178
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,180
The prayers,
the sermons, the charity,
none of that is real!

1179
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:28,149
Oh, my gosh,
you're being ridiculous!
Callie, listen.

1180
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,252
Sam has never
drilled any Wells.

1181
01:06:31,254 --> 01:06:32,988
He's never even
been to Africa,

1182
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,590
and he certainly
does not believe in God.

1183
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:38,660
I found a whole bag
of donations hidden
in his closet.

1184
01:06:38,662 --> 01:06:40,595
How did he--

1185
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:43,431
he's been playing
all of you.
Sam: Hey, Callie?

1186
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,039
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1187
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:54,476
Hear it from him.
Gabriel...

1188
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:56,745
Now, I know you don't
believe me, and he
will never tell you,

1189
01:06:56,747 --> 01:07:00,048
but you can hide
in the bathroom.
You sound crazy!

1190
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,716
I know, I know.
I'm sorry.
( Knocking )

1191
01:07:01,718 --> 01:07:04,519
Hey, uh...

1192
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:09,057
Hey, listen, something's
come up. Just call when
you get a sec, okay?

1193
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:18,633
Sam,
are you lost?

1194
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,635
Where's Callie?

1195
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:23,772
Sam, I thought
we had an understanding.

1196
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:25,774
All right, Gabriel.

1197
01:07:25,776 --> 01:07:28,376
Sam, did you
lose something?

1198
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:40,455
What did you do?

1199
01:07:40,457 --> 01:07:42,657
I didn't do anything.

1200
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:45,760
You're the one stealing
from the tour, Sam.

1201
01:07:45,762 --> 01:07:49,197
Where did you hear that?
I heard it from you.

1202
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:51,466
You're gonna want Yale
to replace that microphone,

1203
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:55,103
which, by the way,
I got to side with Tyler
on your argument.

1204
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,305
Cameron would not last
a week in Africa.

1205
01:07:57,307 --> 01:07:59,340
I don't care what
you think you heard,

1206
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:02,811
but you've stolen
what belongs to me.
I need that back.

1207
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,480
What I found does not
belong to you.

1208
01:08:05,482 --> 01:08:07,382
Prove it.

1209
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:09,250
I did.

1210
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,286
You see, I knew Ken
wouldn't believe me,

1211
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:13,288
so I had him count
last night's donations

1212
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,156
before he handed them
off to you,

1213
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,158
and suffice to say,
there were some

1214
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,661
significant
accounting errors.

1215
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,367
What do you want,
Gabriel?

1216
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:30,472
It's not about what

1217
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:32,507
I want, Sam.

1218
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:37,345
It's about what's right.

1219
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:39,814
Your fans deserve
the truth.
My fans?

1220
01:08:39,816 --> 01:08:42,717
You really think people
come to see me or see you?

1221
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,254
They're here to worship God,
not to get your autograph.

1222
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:50,358
Are you really gonna
lecture me about God?

1223
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,495
You and your friends
are going to jail, Sam.

1224
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,632
You are.

1225
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:02,170
And you have
no one to blame
but yourself.

1226
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,775
Let's get breakfast.

1227
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:17,752
Ken, if there's anything
that I can do--
don't.

1228
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:20,722
I think you're
done talking.

1229
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:24,325
This is fraud

1230
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:28,229
and embezzlement, Sam,
the kind of thing that will
put you away for a long time,

1231
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:30,431
and I can't even
begin to tell--

1232
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:32,500
excuse me.

1233
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,741
Gabriel:
None for me, thanks.

1234
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:46,614
I won't be
pressing charges, Sam.

1235
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,953
What?

1236
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,955
I was part of a church

1237
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:56,724
where the pastor was exposed
for having an affair.

1238
01:09:56,726 --> 01:10:00,628
It was a good ministry,
but it slowly fell apart

1239
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:04,465
once the news hit.

1240
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:06,467
As long as
I'm in charge,

1241
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:08,937
we are gonna stay 100 feet
from either side of a scandal,

1242
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:11,239
because there is
no winner.

1243
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:13,841
Ken, you're not gonna
let these guys get
away with this--

1244
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,711
my mind is made up.
You need to think
about how this could

1245
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,713
ruin people's faith,

1246
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:21,583
not to mention
our donor list.

1247
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:24,719
I can take over the charity.
I actually care
about these people.

1248
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:28,523
We are not having
this conversation again.

1249
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:30,758
You play the songs.
Be grateful

1250
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,595
for what God's given you.

1251
01:10:33,597 --> 01:10:35,630
If people want
the God squad,

1252
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,299
then that's what
they're gonna get.

1253
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:42,303
How are we gonna go about
getting the money
to the charity?

1254
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,276
It turns out the money
you stole is nothing short
of an answered prayer.

1255
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:50,845
See, it's just enough

1256
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:53,815
to cap off the funding
for cross country's
fall campus tour.

1257
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:57,418
Ken, you cannot--

1258
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:00,888
you are gonna sign over
all ownership and rights

1259
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,591
for project "get Wells soon"
to cross country.

1260
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,593
You are gonna travel
with the crew,

1261
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,996
you are gonna preach
through the summer,

1262
01:11:07,998 --> 01:11:11,266
and you are going to be
very wise with your words,

1263
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:13,301
because discretion,
Mr. atwell,

1264
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:16,271
is the only thing keeping
you boys out of jail.

1265
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,540
Now,

1266
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:22,310
is there anyone else
who knows anything about this?

1267
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,419
Let's keep it that way.

1268
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:33,621
So we're not
going to jail?

1269
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:37,025
We lost
the money, bake.

1270
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:39,927
Are you kidding
me, man?

1271
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:43,464
Just forget about the money.
We're lucky to have a way
out of this.

1272
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:47,302
Look, I can still fix this.
Maybe we do have to
stay on tour--

1273
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:48,936
Sam. Hey, Sam,

1274
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:51,973
we don't have to
do anything.

1275
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:54,075
Do you want to go
to prison? No.

1276
01:11:54,077 --> 01:11:56,544
It's over.

1277
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,049
Baker:
I had a best friend
growing up.

1278
01:12:01,051 --> 01:12:03,451
We were super tight.

1279
01:12:03,453 --> 01:12:05,586
He went to prison.

1280
01:12:05,588 --> 01:12:07,789
He said he hated it.

1281
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,392
Sam:
Look, guys,
maybe if we can just--

1282
01:12:11,394 --> 01:12:14,329
Taylor:
Stop. Just stop.

1283
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:18,666
I'm gonna finish this tour,
and I'm gonna get back
to my life.

1284
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,705
Me too.

1285
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:31,079
I'm sorry, man.

1286
01:12:31,081 --> 01:12:33,348
I'm sorry.

1287
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,889
Heard this movie
is so bad-egg.

1288
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:43,958
Did anybody invite
the God squad
to the movie?

1289
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,127
I did,
but they were saying...

1290
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,396
You can't just invite
those guys to a movie.

1291
01:12:48,398 --> 01:12:50,465
They're probably busy
doing charity work right now.

1292
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,533
Really?
Oh, yeah.

1293
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,370
You see how tense they are?
They're sold out for the spirit

1294
01:12:55,372 --> 01:12:57,472
in ways you guys
would never understand.

1295
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:05,780
Man:
That's my daughter in there.
Man #2: Pull yourself together.

1296
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,416
Her brain is in a coma,
not her heart.

1297
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:11,386
Man:
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to forgive?

1298
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:14,055
I don't even know
where to begin.

1299
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,791
Begin with God.

1300
01:13:16,793 --> 01:13:20,461
Your whole life
you've been
building houses,

1301
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:24,165
but you've never thought
about your own foundation.

1302
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,936
It's too late
for me now.

1303
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:30,972
It's just too hard.

1304
01:13:30,974 --> 01:13:34,108
It's never easy
to forgive.

1305
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:37,111
We have to give up
our advantage,

1306
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:39,680
like Christ did
for us.

1307
01:13:39,682 --> 01:13:43,885
Oh, it's a terrifying
and vulnerable thing,

1308
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:46,120
but it sets us free.

1309
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,592
You're never
gonna save grace

1310
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:54,529
if you don't let
grace save you.

1311
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:56,831
<i> ( Man singing )</i>

1312
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,754
All right, all right.

1313
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,059
Sam:
Can you just talk
to me for a second?

1314
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:28,129
Just give me five minutes?
Callie:
I won't give you two minutes.

1315
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:30,665
Okay, I'm fine
with just one.
What do you want, Sam?

1316
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:33,501
I just want to
explain myself
so you don't think I'm--

1317
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:35,736
I think you're
a liar and a thief

1318
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:38,639
because you lied and stole
from thousands of people.

1319
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:40,942
Is that about right?
Is that pretty much
what happened?

1320
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:44,011
I did lie about
what I believe,
and I did lie--

1321
01:14:44,013 --> 01:14:46,147
Sam, stop, okay?

1322
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,884
I am forgiving you,
all right?
And that's it.

1323
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:53,888
You're forgiving me?
Just like that?
Yep, just like that.

1324
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,656
I don't accept.
Excuse me?

1325
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,658
You're playing the Christian
card and don't mean it.

1326
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,861
Just be honest with me!

1327
01:14:59,863 --> 01:15:02,763
Why do you assume that
acting like a Christian
means not being honest?

1328
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:06,667
Because I know you're upset.
I know that I let
everybody down.

1329
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,837
Yeah, Sam, that's
what happens when you
try to please everyone.

1330
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:12,640
You have to lie
to keep them happy,
and then eventually

1331
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:15,643
you run out of lies
and everyone hates you.

1332
01:15:15,645 --> 01:15:17,979
Wow. Okay. Okay.

1333
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:20,114
Did you ever hear
that Einstein failed
a math class?

1334
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:22,550
Yeah, that's
actually not true.
Yeah, I know,

1335
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:25,620
but the point is,
teachers still tell
students that today

1336
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:28,189
because it inspires
a sense of hope.

1337
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:30,791
Well, those teachers
are stupid,

1338
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:32,894
because there's plenty
of other stories out there

1339
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:34,929
that are inspirational
and actually true.

1340
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:37,899
Yeah. Yeah.

1341
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:40,034
Look, Sam, if you
want to live right,

1342
01:15:40,036 --> 01:15:43,037
if you want to
do right by people,
just be honest.

1343
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,008
You want me to be honest?
You want me to be honest
and go to jail.

1344
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,210
You want me to be honest
and go to jail--

1345
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:52,680
what about all the people
that are gonna walk away from
their faith because of me?

1346
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:54,815
Is that what I should do?
You have no problem lying

1347
01:15:54,817 --> 01:15:56,951
and letting an entire
village suffer for it?

1348
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,986
Of course I have
a problem with--

1349
01:15:58,988 --> 01:16:00,922
Sam, listen, listen.

1350
01:16:00,924 --> 01:16:03,257
I am not trying
to tell you what
to do, okay?

1351
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:07,895
But if anyone's faith
is in you, they should
walk away from it.

1352
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,031
And this isn't me
trying to make some

1353
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:13,034
come-to-Jesus
moment, okay,
it's just...

1354
01:16:13,036 --> 01:16:16,671
It seems like you don't
even know what you believe,

1355
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:20,007
and I think
until you do know,

1356
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:23,110
your best answer is that
you don't have one.

1357
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:32,119
I just think you should
put your hope in something
that's worthy of you.

1358
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,090
That's all.

1359
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,913
Callie...

1360
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,620
I'm so sorry.

1361
01:17:05,622 --> 01:17:07,722
For everything.

1362
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:11,258
I hope
you know that.

1363
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,196
I hope that's true.

1364
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,979
( Knocking at door )

1365
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,821
You got a minute?

1366
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,823
We're not getting
to the money.

1367
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,760
I can get to the money.
That's not the problem.
What is?

1368
01:17:45,762 --> 01:17:47,828
Ken will never let me--
Ken cannot stop you.

1369
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,131
Then somebody else will.
You don't understand.

1370
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:53,668
These people put me
in this box, like the only
thing I can do is music.

1371
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,137
And then they resent me
'cause they're jealous.

1372
01:17:56,139 --> 01:17:58,305
They don't resent you
because they're jealous,

1373
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,341
they resent you because
you're kind of a dick.

1374
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,678
No, no, look.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look. Listen.

1375
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,014
You need to cut
this rock-star crap,
dude, okay?

1376
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:11,318
Listen, I think you're
the perfect guys to run
project "get Wells soon."

1377
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,888
I know that your heart
is in the right place,

1378
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,824
but, man, you got to
change your attitude.

1379
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:22,363
I think we can
really help each other,
but you got to trust me.

1380
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,406
Now, do you know
any other songs?

1381
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,778
Mm.

1382
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:39,814
Aha! Come in!
Come in, come in.

1383
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:42,717
I'm just getting
my stuff ready.
Yeah. Yeah.

1384
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,253
I about fell out of my chair
when you called and said
you had a new song.

1385
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,355
Yeah, well, I'm just
experimenting with
a few new words.

1386
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:51,358
Ah, I get it.
Artist thing.

1387
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,294
I understand.
( Phone ringing )

1388
01:18:53,296 --> 01:18:56,464
One second.
Hello.

1389
01:18:56,466 --> 01:19:00,301
Yes, it's him.
Huh?

1390
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:03,170
Oh. Uh...

1391
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,239
Wh-- uh...

1392
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,208
Absolutely.

1393
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:10,878
And you are here
right now?

1394
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,013
Well, yeah,
I can come
down right now.

1395
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:16,784
Sounds great. Thank you
see you soon.

1396
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:18,986
Gabriel, this is it!

1397
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:21,021
You just tune up,
do what you need to do,

1398
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:23,023
warm up, whatever.

1399
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:25,292
I'm gonna run
downstairs real quick.

1400
01:19:25,294 --> 01:19:27,762
Apparently someone
from the<i> holy herald </i>
is here

1401
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:29,797
talking about rankings.

1402
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:32,333
All right.
I'll just do some
scales or something.

1403
01:19:32,335 --> 01:19:34,835
Great. Bye-bye.

1404
01:19:34,837 --> 01:19:37,371
( Door opens, closes )

1405
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,443
( Crowd cheering,
organ playing )

1406
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:54,388
Good evening.

1407
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:57,558
I can't tell you
how happy we are to be
back here in Houston.

1408
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:03,364
Tonight,

1409
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:06,467
let's get rid of
every distraction

1410
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:12,973
and focus on
praising Jesus.

1411
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:15,242
Amen?
Crowd: Amen!

1412
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:17,511
All right.
Here we go.

1413
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:26,887
¶ Jesus ¶
yo!

1414
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:29,056
What's up, dude?
How you doin'?

1415
01:20:29,058 --> 01:20:32,927
Hey, dude,
you never told me about

1416
01:20:32,929 --> 01:20:35,462
the party the other night.
How was it?

1417
01:20:35,464 --> 01:20:39,333
You don't even...
It was a disaster.

1418
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:42,002
Really?
Yeah.

1419
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,238
I drank 19 beers,

1420
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,007
and three months ago,
that's bad-ass.

1421
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,610
And now it was
just like,

1422
01:20:49,612 --> 01:20:52,446
"who's the old guy
with the drinking problem?"
( Laughing )

1423
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:56,617
Still, college,
no parents.
Right?

1424
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:59,553
No.

1425
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:01,288
Nope.

1426
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,558
I got to get a life.
( Tyson singing )

1427
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,927
Yo!

1428
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:09,029
Yo, yo, what's up?
What's up, you d.B.'S?

1429
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:11,365
You guys just
making out, or...

1430
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,467
Baker, we've got
a real love.

1431
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,469
Yeah.
Something you
wouldn't understand.

1432
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:18,973
Hey, uh, guys?
I just wanted to say,

1433
01:21:18,975 --> 01:21:21,876
I'm really, really sorry
about everything.

1434
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:24,578
If I could do this
whole summer over again,
you know--

1435
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,047
ah, you're good, Sam.

1436
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:30,317
Yeah.
I mean, the idea,
from the onset,

1437
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:32,186
terrible.
Thank you.

1438
01:21:32,188 --> 01:21:33,954
But you got to
see it to the end.

1439
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:36,891
I did you get you
a hell of a recommendation.

1440
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:40,494
Don't worry about that, man.
Unless you already wrote it.

1441
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:43,397
'Cause, then, yeah.
Yeah, I'll take it.

1442
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,332
I did. You will.

1443
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:47,501
I just wish all y'all
could've got
something out of it.

1444
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:50,537
Uh... we got
something out of it.

1445
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:52,940
Check this out.

1446
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:56,644
Boom, for you.
Boom, for you.

1447
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:58,946
Thanks. What is it?
What is this?

1448
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:02,549
Our fat stacks, yo!
Royalty checks
from cross dressing!

1449
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:05,319
Baker, this is $6,500.

1450
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:09,056
Guys, I'm the frigging man.
This happened.

1451
01:22:09,058 --> 01:22:11,125
Yeah, yeah.
You know what?

1452
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:12,693
You should just
take my check.

1453
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:15,262
All of y'all,
just split it up.
What?

1454
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,364
I got to work for my dad
anyways after this

1455
01:22:17,366 --> 01:22:19,700
to pay back some debts,
so I already got a job.

1456
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:23,304
I don't need-- although,
with all these checks,

1457
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:25,339
I could pay him
back right now

1458
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:27,107
one fell swoop,
which would be great

1459
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,676
for me and him,
probably you guys too.

1460
01:22:28,678 --> 01:22:31,979
Tyson:
You know what, Pierce?
None of us

1461
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,981
could thank you enough.

1462
01:22:33,983 --> 01:22:36,717
( All talking at once )

1463
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,486
That's very sweet
of you. That's...

1464
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,022
Are you serious?
All: Yeah.

1465
01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:44,091
You're supposed to say,
"no, we couldn't,"
and then you give me my--

1466
01:22:44,093 --> 01:22:46,293
forget it.
Just give me my--

1467
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:48,429
are you gonna go down?
All right, you're going
down right now.

1468
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:49,730
Hey, you guys,
Gabriel's...

1469
01:22:49,732 --> 01:22:52,366
Uh...

1470
01:22:52,368 --> 01:22:55,069
Gabriel's on
his last song.

1471
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,371
Hey, Baker,

1472
01:22:57,373 --> 01:23:00,174
let's finish
what we started.

1473
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:02,543
You got it, Pierce.

1474
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:09,550
Yeah, man, I'm gonna
get to the booth.

1475
01:23:09,552 --> 01:23:11,986
Okay.

1476
01:23:16,358 --> 01:23:19,326
Hmm?

1477
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:22,997
Will you give today
for a better tomorrow?

1478
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:36,677
Pierce:
You know, if you make
$25,000 a year,

1479
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:40,280
you're in the top 10%

1480
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:43,217
of wealth in this world.

1481
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:47,454
I mean, we are blessed
beyond belief,

1482
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:51,525
and yet I don't think
there's anybody in this
room who cares.

1483
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,496
That's it.

1484
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,464
All right.

1485
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:02,102
It's heavy.

1486
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:04,371
Hey, what are you
gonna say?

1487
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:07,041
Uh...

1488
01:24:07,043 --> 01:24:09,610
I don't know.

1489
01:24:09,612 --> 01:24:12,679
Just...
I'll just get out there

1490
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:16,350
and say the first thing
that pops into my head,
I guess.

1491
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:24,391
Hey, can you...
Can you deliver
something for me?

1492
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,527
Uh, yeah.
Sure.

1493
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,271
Thanks.

1494
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,512
Callie?

1495
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:48,115
Yeah?

1496
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,352
You...

1497
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:56,090
You know how the other night
you were talking about
how you feel like

1498
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:58,459
you're on tour, and...

1499
01:24:58,461 --> 01:25:02,563
You haven't
changed anything?

1500
01:25:02,565 --> 01:25:06,467
You really shouldn't worry
about that so much.

1501
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,436
( Exhales )

1502
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,358
Pierce:
It is now
my distinct pleasure

1503
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,693
to introduce
to you the man

1504
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:08,896
behind this mission.

1505
01:26:08,898 --> 01:26:12,533
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Sam atwell!

1506
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,801
( Applause, cheering )

1507
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,279
Thank you guys.

1508
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:28,749
Thank you all
so much.

1509
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:33,754
I was just reading Matthew,

1510
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,558
and, uh,

1511
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:43,230
there's this story

1512
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:47,234
about a rich, young guy

1513
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:52,206
who meets Jesus,

1514
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:55,309
and he asks him,

1515
01:26:55,311 --> 01:26:59,279
"how do I get
into heaven?"

1516
01:26:59,281 --> 01:27:01,315
And Jesus is like,

1517
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:03,517
"have you obeyed
the commandments?"

1518
01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:06,420
And the guy's like,
"yeah, I have."

1519
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:10,924
But Jesus told him

1520
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:13,927
that he had
something missing,

1521
01:27:13,929 --> 01:27:16,964
so he asked him
to give up everything,

1522
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:19,466
sacrifice everything,

1523
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:24,371
and follow him.

1524
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:29,876
But the guy
couldn't do it.

1525
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,613
And it says that

1526
01:27:32,615 --> 01:27:35,415
the rich, young guy

1527
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:37,551
walked away sad,

1528
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,922
because

1529
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:45,025
he had too much
to lose.

1530
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:53,000
This guy believed in Jesus
right up to the point

1531
01:27:53,002 --> 01:27:56,670
that it was gonna
cost him something,
and then he just bailed,

1532
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:00,507
which makes me wonder
if he ever really,

1533
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:04,278
really believed
in the first place.

1534
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:12,319
Sometimes a decision
comes your way,

1535
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:13,987
and it's...

1536
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:20,294
It's a hard decision.

1537
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:22,729
But it shows you

1538
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:25,065
in that moment

1539
01:28:25,067 --> 01:28:29,069
what you really believe.

1540
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,656
I, uh...

1541
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,898
( Sighs )

1542
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:19,453
<i> ¶ Morning prayer</i>

1543
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:23,557

1544
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:27,094

1545
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:30,797

1546
01:29:30,799 --> 01:29:35,736
¶<i> and a patch of sun fell</i>

1547
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:43,377
¶<i> she put her head</i>

1548
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:49,583
¶<i> the lesson today was</i>

1550
01:29:53,122 --> 01:29:56,890

¶<i> no cars, no mobiles,</i>

1552

1553
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:13,006

1554
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:18,645

1562

1563

¶<i> the choirmaster,</i>

1564
