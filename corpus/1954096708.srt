Well

11
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,360
Well, now works.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,640
You say the same
thing at half time.

13th
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,760
The light went off this time.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,560
Look at that!

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,480
This is my mother,
my niece Rosie.

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
Who is playing a
early music on the piano.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,160
- That was fun, Grandma.
- Plays very well, dear.

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,400
Time to wash your hands.

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,800
- Belo Peru, Kurt.
- Thanks!

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,040
Yes, of course like
you have done!

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I paid for it,
this account?

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,560

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,280
Mom, let's wait
Melany's fiance?

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,320
Son, do not place
this about me again.

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,440
How will you know who

27
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:44,600
I think it's great.

28
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,840
- Rosie, honey, go wash your hands.
- Have you washed your Daddy.

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Let me see.

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,720

31
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,400

35
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,680
- Wait, wait!
- Give me the tape!

36
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
- Stay calm!

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,600
No!
Relax, man!

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,520
I'll delete it!
Wait.

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,520
- Swear you'll delete this?
- Yes, I'm going out.

44
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,080
- Let me see.

45
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
Mom goes for the table
and it will cool.

46
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,040
Okay?

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,920
Melanie and Matthew here.

48
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,960
Matthew!

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,360
- Has un new boyfriend?
- Yes.

50
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,680
- And what does he do?
- Brian.

51
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,480
I do not know. He teaches
science or something.

52
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,840
Tommy, could leave
to burn for one night?

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,920
- This is my job, Mom.
- Which profession?

54
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,440
Director of music videos.

55
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,640
Yes, of course. Barely
let the camera stop.

56
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,920
Oh.

57
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,640
- What was that?
- What's this?

58
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,440
What the hell ...?

59
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,960
- It was a lightning?
- I did not hear any thunder.

60
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
- Rosie, okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,000
Great!
He cut the power.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
- You can grab a flashlight, Tommy?
- Can I use the camera light.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right.

64
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,320
We will return soon.

65
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,640
Where to go?

66
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
Let's take a look at the fuses in the house.

67
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
Good but fast.
I do not want supper cool.

68
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,240
- Come on, baby!
- Hello!

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,640
Hello honey, what is it?

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,200
I am saying that goes
the best scene happen.

71
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
- Hello Tommy!
- How are you?

72
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,080
- Nice shirt, dropped him very well.
- Oh, thank you!

73
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
To the camera?

74
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,560
I am making a video
Christmas supper.

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,240
Ah, cool.

76
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,240
Matthew, this is my brother
new Tommy. Tommy, this is Matthew.

77
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,400
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello, nice to meet you.

78
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,920
What's happening?
Why the lights are out?

79
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,960
The fuses seem to have
burned, or something.

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,080
- Ah, saw the lightning?
- Yes, it was amazing.

81
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,400
Where you been?

82
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,000
Nice to see you, Kurt.

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,200
- What was that? Fought?
- Yes, of course. With a lamp.

84
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,960
Matthew, this is my brother
old Kurt. Kurt, this is Matthew.

85
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,320
Matt ...

86
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,320
- Mm .. yes, it's Matthew.
- Matthew.

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Hello Brian ... this is my
another younger brother Brian.

88
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,160
- Hello, how are you?
- How are you?

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,640
Right. Let's see what
happened to light.

90
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,120
Do not worry about it.
We will return in a few minutes.

91
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,000
- Right. See ya, Tom
- Bye.

92
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,000
Hello Rosie!
Hello Mom!

93
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,160
I believe that will paint
the stairs to the entrance, Tommy.

94
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,120
- Yes, I paint.
- When?

95
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,760
I already told mom that I paint this week.

96
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,840
And the guest room too?

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,280
I'll paint, Brian.

98
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,200
Should have done it
since last week.

99
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
I'll do.

100
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,080
Heavens!

101
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,200
And what you do during the week?

102
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,520
- I go to school, crazy.
- I go to school, crazy.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,520
Already concluded.

104
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,200
- They believe that honey?
- What about it?

105
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,640
That Matthew

106
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,200
Because he is black?

107
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,800
- It's "Matthew"
- Shut up.

108
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,880
- This guy made you weird.
- Yes, because our sister is taking us.

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,640
- You think it's funny?
- Yes.

110
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,800
- It's cool, it's just jealousy.
- It's not. Is still connected?

111
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,280
- Yes.
- You can erase.

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,600
I will not delete, no one will see.

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,040
I know, everything should be
dark. It's everything I say.

114
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,840
- What difference does it make?
- Make a difference.

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,640
- Are you leaving smoke.
- Yes.

116
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Look at this.

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,400
- Shit!
- Careful.

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,200
That's concerted
"the boy's school."

119
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,480
- Look at this.
- Let me see.

120
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,240
Melted everything.

121
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,800
It stinks.

122
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
- What could cause this?
- A lightning.

123
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,200
- Can you fix this?
- Do not know.

124
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,680
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

125
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
What was that?

126
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Lightning.

127
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,800
- It looked like lightning.
- It came from the barn.

128
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,480
- Lie.
- Truth! Saw me on camera.

129
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,760
Reached the transformer
downstairs. Let's see.

130
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,120
Better not.

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,920
Come on, anyway we will have
to call the electric company.

132
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,440
It's true. Tell mama
let's take a little longer.

133
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,920
- Come on, Brian, go there.
- Come on, Brian.

134
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,680
You go, Tommy.

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,960
- Come on, Brian!
- Tommy!

136
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,640
- You asshole!
- Tommy, come on.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,880
Ready?

138
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,960
Guys!
Wait!

139
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,080
- Mom is on her second glass of wine.
- What?

140
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,760
- I thought I had spoken with her.
- Yes, I said. But she did not stop.

141
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,920
Drink vodka like it was over.

142
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,680
And why did not
something about it?

143
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,400
- Whatever I do, Brian?
- Why did not remove the bottles?

144
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,840
She'll buy more.

145
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,480
Told him about the "support group"?

146
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,280
Told me to shut up.

147
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,800
Still closed?

148
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,240
Yes.

149
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,160
The death of my father left her so close.

150
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,880
Hell, Tommy! It has to do
something before things get worse.

151
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm ...

152
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,440
... doing. You are never here.

153
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,600
Give me a break, Tommy.
I take care of business.

154
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,040
I have no time for anything. And now
I think the problem Mom?.

155
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,640
Well now you know Ben?
Mom is drinking again.

156
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,920
Like when Dad died.

157
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,480
- Did you see that?
- Yes!

158
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Shoots it!

159
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
- Care
- How strange!

160
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
- We have to call someone.
- This does not cause a fire. Right?

161
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,560
- I do not know.
- We should call someone.

162
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,800
Yes.

163
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
What is this?

164
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,960
- What?
- Ali

165
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,760
What?

166
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,960
What the hell is that?

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,440
- It's something from space.
- Yes, it's huge.

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,960
What the fuck!

169
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,640
- I think it's a UFO.
- What?

170
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,160
- You are lying.
- It's true.

171
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
- Shut up.
- Give me the camera.

172
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,560
- A UFO?
- Wait!

173
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,000
How does this work?
I can not see.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,640
- I swear! This is a UFO!
- What? Okay. Where is it?

175
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,840
What he said!

176
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,760
Keep quiet.

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,040
Who is this guy?

178
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,440
- What he's doing?
- Silence!

179
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,240
- Shit!
- My God!

180
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
- Come on, give me the camera.
- It's an alien.

181
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,840
- I return!
- What?

182
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,520
- I swear, it's an alien!
- Oh My God!

183
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,520
Hush, Tommy.

184
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,360
- I'm not believing.
- There is no other.

185
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
- What?
- There is no other.

186
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,120
My God, it's two!

187
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Quietly,
say nothing.

188
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,760
What are you doing?

189
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,880
What are you doing? Let me
We will see, is my camera.

190
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,520
Give me, let me see!

191
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,000
- Damn!
- Right, right!

192
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,320
Take it.

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,520
Shit!

194
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,680
- Shoots them!
- What?

195
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,480
- That the cow.
- What?

196
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,280
What they are doing, Brian?

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,000
- They are opening it!
- My God!

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,880
- What are they doing?
- Cutting it!

199
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
Silence!

200
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,880
- What are you doing, Brian?
- Cutting her.

201
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,240
Brian

202
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,120
- What?
- We saw it!

203
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,800
- One is looking at me.
- Shit!

204
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,400
Saw us!

205
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,680
What was that?

206
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,600
I am not according to the report, I am not
confirming or denying the possibility of ...

207
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
that McPherson was
abducted by aliens.

208
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,520
Found tape
Section of McPherson

209
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
And do not see this
people ever since.

210
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,920
Now, about that
I have nothing to say.

211
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,480
- What was that?
- Brian, get up!

212
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,520
- Come on! Let it go, Tommy!
- Get the camera!

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,440
- Leave the damn camera! Come on!
- Sure! Come on!

214
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,040
- Brian, come on
- My God!

215
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
- Brothers!
- Come, run! run!

216
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,600
- Come on! continue!
- Over there!

217
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Brian!

218
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,520
Tommy!

219
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,240
Come on, Brian!

220
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,440
Go on, Tommy!

221
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,360
Careful there!

222
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,200
- You. ..
- I know, I know!

223
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Quick!

224
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,080
- Shit!
- Come on, gotcha!

225
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,720
We need to go over there!

226
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,680
Grab your clothes.
We go now!

227
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,480
- What happened?
- Call the emergency!

228
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,040
- Why?
- Move!

229
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,840
- What?
- There are some damn aliens out there!

230
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,920
Be careful what you say, Tommy.

231
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,080
- You what?
- They shot in the hand of Brian!

232
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,000
A shot?

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,080
Extreterrestres, UFOs.
We gotta go!

234
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
UFOs?

235
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,080
The telephone does not work.

236
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,480
Wait, threw in a hand?

237
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,240
They threw something,
we need to go now.

238
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Brian, please, dear.

239
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Their ship just
with the transformer.

240
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,400
- You lie!
- Mommy, we need to go!

241
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,920
They saw us, we need to go!

242
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,320
- Linda, take the jacket Rosie.
- Right.

243
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,720
- This drug?
- No, you're fucked!

244
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,840
- We go well?
- Please, Brian, show your hand!

245
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,520
Brian, please, may I see your hand?

246
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,240
My God!

247
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,400
Oh, my God.
Need for cool water.

248
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
No, you will not leave!

249
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,800
- You are telling me not to quit?
- Yes, leave all.

250
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,480
- What are you talking about?
- Please speak more slowly.

251
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,400
Are leaving Rosie scared.

252
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,760
This is not funny.

253
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,760
This is no joke ...

254
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,840
We should go before
come to the house.

255
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,480
A UFO?

256
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,360
It's scary, a ball
black giant, over the River.

257
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,720
Saw us and shot us!

258
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,960
Okay, you've seen aliens.
We have dinner now?

259
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,680
- Sorry, I can not believe.
- See for yourself.

260
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,200
- I'll see.
- Nobody is going to leave alone!

261
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,320
- What was that?
- What is happening?

262
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,040
- Let me see!
- Let me see.

263
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,840
This thing

264
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Gone.

265
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,000
- Kurt, are leaving.
- You think so?

266
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,120
- What was that?
- It's what we're trying to say.

267
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,920
UFO space, the same.
But whether or not?

268
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,960
- I think so.
- Shit!

269
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,120
- We lost them.
- Ah, what a pity.

270
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,480
Let's all calm down.
Light the candles and dinner.

271
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,600
- Good idea, Grandma.
- We have to warn someone.

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,360
- Yes.
- Yeah, nice try siblings.

273
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,920
- No joke, Mel.
- Rosie, sit.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,480
Kurt, we must do something.

275
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,680
Should we light the candles and dinner
is this what we should do.

276
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,000
Come on, Brian. need
cold water in your hand.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,240
Brian, go!

278
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,240
But ...

279
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,640
Even though they are gone.

280
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,800
- The rifles are in the Bedroom?
- Yes, in the closet. Kurt?

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,960
Kurt.

282
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,240
Kurt, come on.

283
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,400
I will not sit after what I saw.

284
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,080
So ...
What do you think of doing?

285
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,120
Look, Mommy, I always wanted
do this long ago.

286
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,040
Wants everyone to do part of it.

287
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,480
They are gone, you said.
Come on.

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,120
Gone.

289
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Okay, let's go.

290
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Come on, baby.

291
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,400
Okay, sit, come on.

292
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,520
Brian, Renee, let's ...

293
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,560
- We are ready for dinner?
- Yes.

294
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,320
- Kurt, you get.
- Yes

295
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,120
I start.

296
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,480
Thanks, Linda.

297
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,400
I thank my husband ...

298
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,720
that is always in charge of his family
even though so much time at work ...

299
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,400
... And for being so strong
this year it was so difficult.

300
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Te amo.

301
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:29,200
Honey, I thank you for ...

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,560
Can not make it.

303
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,280
of course you can.

304
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,240
Come on, Kurt.

305
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,440
Mel ...

306
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,160
- I thank you for ...
- Kurt!

307
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,480
I think I saw something in the window.

308
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,040
Tommy, please.

309
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,760
There's something there.
I'm not lying, he had something.

310
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,040
- Where, Tommy?
- I do not know.

311
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,080
- Where was it?
- Do not know.

312
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,440
Just saw something was very fast.

313
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,640
Hide. If latch
inside the rooms. Come on!

314
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,520
- Take, Brian.
- I think that guns are not necessary.

315
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,040
Where is Rosie?
Rosie!

316
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,800
What is the plan, Kurt?
What do we do?

317
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,040
Why have to walk with this weapon
the house? Rosie is frightening.

318
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,000
Not now, Linda.

319
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,320
- What is happening?
- He knew his family have these strange habits?

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,280
What did you say?

321
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,240
What the hell did you say?

322
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,080
- You do not know what to say, then shut your mouth.
- Stop.

323
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,560
- What is happening to you?
- Look, do not talk to me, nor about ...

324
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,360
... This idiot.

325
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,160
yo this is not done,
go ...

326
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,200
You can say all that?

327
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,200
What do you mean?

328
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,200
It is not their importance.
does not match with this family.

329
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,280
- That's exactly what you want, right?
- Who thinks it is?

330
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,400
Want to start a fight,
this is what you want?

331
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,920
- C'mon, Kurt.
- Stay calm.

332
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,280
Matthew, stay calm.
is only uncomfortable.

333
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,880
And when we're uncomfortable, say
the truth about what we think.

334
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,080
- Bitch!
- Kurt, stop it!

335
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,640
Take this gun in my face
What's happening?

336
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,520
- Come on, forget it.
- Oh, my God.

337
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
Me sorry.

338
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,400
Stop playing, Rosie!

339
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,080
Matthew, look, we all
startled. you were not here.

340
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,400
You're right, I was not here.
I do not know what is happening.

341
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,840
Listen, we have no time
to resolve this now.

342
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Come on, brothers. It's Christmas.

343
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,040
Come on. Kurt.
Drop that gun and feels.

344
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,040
Come on, baby.

345
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,080
Larque this weapon.

346
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you for always
help me, Linda.

347
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Tommy, drop this camera for a second.

348
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,520
Why? I will record everything
What will happen tonight.

349
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,480
- Kurt!
- Easy!

350
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
- You did everything?
- What?

351
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,640
- You can return to show what we saw?
- Just give me ... a second.

352
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,680
Wait ...

353
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,920
Come here, baby.

354
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Never seen anything like it in all my life.

355
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
I said.

356
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,120
I can not believe it.

357
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,080
- I want to see! I want to see!
- Not now, dear.

358
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,080
Come on, be some pranksters.

359
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,120
Mom, I said, they are real!

360
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,080
Come on, Brian.
Let me take care of that wound.

361
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,840
Brian ... I'm afraid.

362
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,720
- I feel.
- Okay.

363
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,720
Love, everything will end well.
Right?

364
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,720
I think it scared them.
Me paracer be good.

365
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:39,201
Hello? They shoot at you.

366
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,800
Perhaps they felt that the
Tommy's camera was a weapon.

367
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,800
They saw the camera light
and shot.

368
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Tommy, you did not record everything, right?

369
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,720
Since the beginning not.

370
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,240
- Tommy, leave us alone.
- Right.

371
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,520
- We need to get out.
- Rosie must be hungry.

372
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,520
Linda, look at the phone, please.

373
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,520
I've looked, still mute.

374
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,520
- Kurt, we're not leaving.
- Mama!

375
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,840
- What?
- What was that?

376
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,800
- Over here! Over here!
- I did! I said that I saw one!

377
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Dad! Beware of this,
can hurt someone!

378
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,280
Shut the doors.

379
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
See that?

380
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,280
- Is already closed ...
- Who the hell did this?

381
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,600
- What the hell is that?
- I do not know where it came from.

382
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,560
- Do you copy?
- My ears are hurting.

383
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,600
Come here.

384
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,720
My God!

385
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,520
No, Mel!
Come here!

Over.

402
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,800
- Okay?
- Yes.

403
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,520
My ears still hurt.

404
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
- Mel?
- Ugh.

405
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,960
Everything is closed, Kurt

406
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
They are all well?

407
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,440
My ears still hurt.

408
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,760
Mommy, what are you doing?

409
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,800
Do not want to tread on anything.

410
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,520
Let it go, we'll leave.

411
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,280
- What do they want?
- How the hell should I know?

412
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,400
We can not stay here.

413
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,520
The phone remains silent.

414
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,760
They may say something on the radio.

415
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,720
Has no energy, Tommy.

416
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,520
Shit.

417
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,080
Mommy, I need the
keys to the truck.

418
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,720
Why?

419
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,000
It's bigger than mine.

420
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,920
I'll bring it up to
door, and go up ...

421
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,640
What we do with food?

422
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,160
Let the food go.

423
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,400
- Where are you?
- I'm with you.

424
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,320
No, it will not.

425
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,440
I guess I should not go alone.

426
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,120
And I do not think I should go with me.

427
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,240
- Mel.
- I'm with you.

428
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,480
Wait here.

429
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,840
Be careful!

430
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,120
- Stay tuned.
- I do not think they were gone, Kurt.

431
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,480
- Just keep your eyes open.
- Yes, I know.

432
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,680
God!
I think I peed my pants.

433
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,760
What?

434
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,360
I peed my pants!

435
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,600
- I peed my pants!
- Okay.

436
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,880
I will not tell anyone.

437
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,560
Okay, let's go.

438
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,040
- Damn!
- What?

439
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,600
The battery is running low.
When was the last time you looked?

440
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,160
I do not know.

441
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,640
Should be the cables or something.

442
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,720
Great.

443
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,760
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell?

444
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,520
Illuminates here.

445
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,040
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

446
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,120
Give me the gun.

447
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,200
What do we do?

448
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,120
We removed the battery,
and put another one.

449
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,320
- It's closed.
- Have the keys?

450
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
The mother has.

451
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,920
Shit!

452
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,480
We need a
battery for the truck.

453
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,800
What is the truck?

454
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,680
Damaged.

455
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,840
As the damaged?

456
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,920
The damaged, do not care.

457
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,480
But the truck right?

458
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,640
I do not know.

459
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,960
I hope you have not seen.

460
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,800
If everything alright,
back in five minutes ...

461
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
And we left here, right?

462
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,000
What time you looked
phones, Linda?

463
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,760
I do not know, my watch has stopped.

464
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,520
- The mine also.
- What?

465
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,720
The mine also.

466
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,040
The mine also.
How strange.

467
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
What?

468
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,400
Kurt, are on the ceiling.

469
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,840
What do we do?
Are on the ceiling!

470
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
Close the chimney!

471
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,800
It's hot.

472
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,560
Chances are raccoons,
like to paw the trash.

473
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,800
Yes, it can be.

474
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,040
Tommy, no!

475
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,720
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

476
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,120
Hush, Hush!

477
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,840
Oh my God, are in the house!

478
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,760
- Where?
- In the bathroom at the end of the corridor.

479
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,040
- What do we do?
- Silence.

480
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,480
Everyone is here.

481
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,600
Turn off the light.

482
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,440
Oh, God.

483
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,240
Oh, shit!

484
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,920
Have one here! Have one here!

485
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,600
Julian Bond
Musician

486
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,240
It's still funny when they speak it, but ...

487
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,000
When I saw the tape, I realized
I was wrong.

488
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,240
The light, the smells ...

489
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,480
The skin of fearful about me,
when I was so scared.

490
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,920
Even to speak.

491
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,360
It is not something easy to forget.

492
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,040
Do not know what it is, when one of these ...

493
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,720
Starts its life,
I put in this situation.

494
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,280
It is very scary.

495
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,800
When I see the family
In this situation,

496
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,880
lose faith, just thinking.

497
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,200
If they understand me?

498
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,320
- You have one here!
- What?

499
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
Have one here, take a rope.
Come on!

500
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,960
Quick!

501
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
- Tommy, what's going on?
- We have some rope?

502
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,440
We have some rope?

503
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,920
- Has one of the trash.
- Why?

504
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,360
- What's happening?
- Here, here.

505
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,480
What's happening?

506
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,360
Kurt locked one
Mom's room.

507
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,440
And shut the door.

508
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,400
- Do you have another string?
- No, to Take.

509
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,600
- Come on, Tommy!
- Coming!

510
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,440
It's here.

511
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
- It's the only one.
- Now close here.

512
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,920
- Help me close the door.
- Right, right.

513
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,240
How do you know that still there?

514
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,560
Continue around.
Close the bathroom window.

515
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,840
Come on, Brian.

516
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,640
Leave, I close.

517
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,360
- Has a ai?
- Yes.

518
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,640
What will they do with it?

519
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,480
Leave there until
talking with someone.

520
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,800
Will leave it there?

521
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,080
So we wait?

522
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,160
It is not good to leave.

523
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,640
They can not leave it there.

524
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,160
Honey, we've done.

525
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,080
- Kurt is trying to leave.
- Silence!

526
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,960
Oh, my God.

527
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
- My God.
- Shit.

528
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,800
Not going anywhere.

529
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,760
C'mon, bastard.

530
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,000
What's happening?

531
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,920
We're fine, honey.
i get on the ladder.

532
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,080
- This does not work, Kurt
- Back off, back!

533
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,120
Drop the rope and walk away!

534
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,920
- Kurt!
- Do not!

535
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,240
No, Kurt!

536
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,600
Do not.

537
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,920
See?

538
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,360
Now go down to the first floor, come on.

539
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,000
Kurt, the light!
The light!

540
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,640
- My God!
- What the hell is that?

541
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,040
Silence.

542
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,000
- Stop it.
- Mel, behind.

543
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,240
Matthew, remove the battery.

544
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,560
Opened?

545
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,560
The weapon has not done anything?

546
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,320
What the hell is he?

547
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,880
Can not be, I shot him.

548
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,520
It's the same light as
Brian injured his hand.

549
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,760
Are you okay?

550
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,880
We're fine.
Stay on the ladder.

551
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,240
Look at that hole.

552
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,920
- Mel gone.
- Lie. Listen ...

553
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,720
- Gone.
- Yes, or are regrouping.

554
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,560
- How do you know who is dead, Kurt?
- Because I shot him, Brian.

555
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,800
Kurt, your nose.

556
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,240
- You are bleeding.
- What?

557
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,240
- I do not know.
- What?

558
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,640
What's happening?
Okay?

559
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm fine, dear.

560
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280
He died, Kurt?.

561
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,760
I do not know.

562
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,160
I can not see anything.
Come on, give me space.

563
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,800
Got to get it recorded.

564
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,320
Now he's dead.

565
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,280
- Back off, Tommy.
- Come on, let me see.

566
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,240
Do not know if he's dead.
Stay here.

567
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,960
It may not have survived.

568
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,520
Do not touch.

569
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,680
Come on, depart.

570
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,000
Do not scare me, Matthew.

571
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,280
Where is your weapon of light, Kurt?

572
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,400
- Failure to meet.
- It's so small.

573
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,320
I can not find his wrist.

574
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,360
We'll cover it.

575
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,960
Why?

576
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,680
Sure, Mel.

577
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,280
I can not believe it.

578
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,600
Take it.

579th
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,720
You are the best.
Now cover.

580
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,440
Come on out.
Out, out.

581
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,320
- What? OK?
- Kurt threw the door.

582
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,120
Oh, my God.

583
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,720
Should see.

584
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,440
I do not want to see.

585
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,280
What are you doing here, Rosie?
I spoke to stay downstairs.

586
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,880
Grandma, it's okay.
be not afraid.

587
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,920
Kurt, the cover.
I do not want to see what Rosie.

588
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,080
Close with key.

589
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,920
The mother has no room key.

590
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,720
What do we do it
come down the aisle?

591
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,480
Oh, God ...

592
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,040
- Brian!
- What?

593
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,160
- Woe is great, looked like new.
- Yes, there was fine.

594
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,160
Dad, it's time to descend.

595
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,200
Okay, let's go.

596
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,080
Everything will be fine.

597
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,600
Brian, it's time to go.

598
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,920
Come on, Rosie.
We go to the bathroom.

599
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Mom, everything is fine now.

600
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,480
What do you have?

601
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,720
Nobody will do anything,
until Brian and I ...

602
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
down the truck.

603
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,040
Where will you dear?

604th
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,120
He picked her?

605
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,160
Got it.

606
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,720
What does she have?

607
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,480
Wherever he went?

608
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,720
Want to see it.

609
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,400
No, it will not.

610
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,880
Go to the bathroom.

611
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,120
Come on, baby.

612
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,640
- What is she?
- Do not know what she has.

613
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,440
That's it.

614
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,200
Well, listen ...

615
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,960
Honey, what is it?

616
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,480
- What?
- Your nose.

617
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,120
Is bleeding, Mel.

618
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,480
Oh my God!

619
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,240
My God!
I'm bleeding!

620
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,080
I feel very bad.

621
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,240
They are all well?

622
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,760
Bring a bit of ice.

623
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,320
- Why is this happening?
- Here, Renee.

624
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,840
Es only nosebleed.

625
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,200
Do not stop.

626
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,160
Bring some ice, baby.

627
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,800
Okay, Renee?

628
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,440
We gotta get outta here.

629
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,520
Okay, okay.
Come on.

630
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,040
Let me see.

631
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,320
All right.

632
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,960
- Okay.
- Right.

633
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,400
- Brian, we must go now.
- Right.

634
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,840
Stay here.
We will return soon.

635
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
I'll go with you, brothers.

636
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,480
We take care of it, right?

637
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, I forgot.
I am a woman.

638
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,560
This has nothing to do.

639
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,040
It's just that we do not want
everyone outside.

640
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,800
The more the merrier.

641
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,240
- Kurt, listen to me.
- Stay here.

642
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,680
Matthew, you take care
door, right?

643rd
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,160
- I want to go.
- Tommy, You wait here.

644
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,840
What was that?

645
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,160
What is this?

646
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,360
To the ground, they all play on the floor.

647
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,240
- Pro floor!
- Where was it?

648
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,960
Oh, God!

649
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,320
- My God!
- Renee!

650
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,800
Renee, wake up!

651
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,640
Jason Arnett
Laboratory Videometria.

652
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,320
This video be false,
was very well done ...

653
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,280
... But I think it goes.

654
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,000
The analysis in this
tape shows images ...

655
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,000
... More than a pixilated
video normal and ordinary.

656
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,120
This can be done
by digital effects.

657
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,920
The only likelihood of
be real is the fact ...

658
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,320
the image is so intense ...

659
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,400
It is possible, but ...

660
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,560
... Be the first to do it.

661
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,840
- Oh God!
- Okay?

662
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,240
Silence!
I can not know if it's breathing.

663
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,400
A pulse?

664
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,600
What the hell was that?
Went out the window!

665
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,080
She's okay, Brian?

666
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,400
- Has wrist?
- Yes.

667
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,040
Very slow, but is breathing.

668
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,520
take it off the ground.

669
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,800
You should keep your back right.

670
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,000
I can not believe it.

671
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,560
- Honey, what do we do now?
- Okay.

672
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,400
Packed their things and leave.

673
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,600
- It's all your fault.
- What?

674
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,440
- You shot in cold blood.
- Brian, came into our house.

675
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,360
Maybe we scared them.
Never thought about it?

676
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,200
Easy, easy.

677
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,640
- Give me the gun!
- Stop it!

678
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,080
Stop!

679
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,120
- Stop!
- Stay calm.

680
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,720
Does not work that way.
I was quiet.

681
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,960
We need to get
Renee to a hospital.

682
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,720
Look at the phone, watch phone.

683
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,760
- Get off the phone.
- Brian, try to calm down.

684
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,880
Put down the phone.
We'll leave here.

685
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,040
- Do not go without Renee.
- Put it behind the truck.

686
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,600
And take it to the city.
Right?

687
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,560
If you can not turn the truck ...

688
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,000
We will come back here ...

689th
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,880
And wait till dawn.

690
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,120
Where is Rosie?

691
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,720
In the bathroom.

692
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,840
- Mom.
- Okay, I see.

693
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,640
Let us listen all ...

694
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,120
'll be fine.

695
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,880
let us all help.

696
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,760
We will continue the plan ...

697
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,040
I will leave. Matthew, close the
door after I leave.

698
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Stand in here and
protect the door.

699
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,000
- Do not let anyone enter.
- Right.

700
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,040
- And when you ...
- I listen.

701
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,920
Beat three times.
When you hear three beats ...

702
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,800
... Know that I am.
Right?

703
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,600
- And what if you do?
- There it to anyone else.

704
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,400
- Not against Rosie!
- What?

705
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,360
- It's in the bathroom.
- No, Not!

706
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,880
- Rosie.
- No, Linda, where are you?

707
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,600
Wait! wait!

708
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,640
- Going up?
- Rosie!

709
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,520
Rosie, what are you doing?

710
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,280
- Rosie, come.
- Move away from the door.

711
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,800
What happened?

712
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,880
- Come, walk.
- It should not be here.

713
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,080
- Let's go down, right?
- Yes.

714
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,560
- She okay?
- Yes.

715
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,480
- I want to go right now.
- Okay, we'll go.

716
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,000
Makes me worried.
not want to talk about it.

717
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,480
Mama, I'm fine. Not
need to worry.

718
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,040
She wanted to see the extraterrestrial.

719
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,320
Come on, baby.

720
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,560
How are you?

721
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,520
I'm fine.
Nothing happened.

722
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,040
- Come on.
- Calm down, Linda.

723
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,600
Mom can stay with Rosie?

724
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,640
- Okay.
- Yes, it is in shock.

725
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,080
- It will be fine.
- Right.

726th
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,240
Let's turn on the truck.

727
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,840
- Come on, brother.
- Right.

728
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:35,000
The sooner we start,
soon arrive at the hospital.

729
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,760
Come here, Matthew.

730
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,800
Can use?

731
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,920
Yes, I have a general notion.

732
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,160
Right.

733
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,800
If something going, do not think twice.

734
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,160
Not a good idea, Daddy.

735
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,880
Dad will be fine, honey.
'll Be fine.

736
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,120
Brian, come on.

737
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,240
Be careful, right?

738
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,880
- Take care of Renee.
- Right.

739
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,240
- Come back quick.
- We will.

740
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,600
Care of girls and breast, Tommy.

741
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,480
Yes, I will take care.

742
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,080
Return.

743
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,160
We went out and shut the door.

744th
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,880
I think we should go out together.

745
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,880
No mom, it is better.

746
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,120
Do not know what is out there.

747
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,240
Nobody knows what's out there.

748
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,280
I do not know, got
a bad feeling.

749
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,560
Has a rifle and a rifle.

750
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,920
They'll be fine.

751
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,760
Right. Only be a few minutes.

752
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,160
Why do not we sit down?

753
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,200
I am hungry.

754
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:13,280
Well, why not eat some?

755
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,120
- What are you talking about?
- Mom, not now.

756
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,960
This is no time to eat.

757
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,200
It will take awhile.

758
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,960
Why can not we get something to eat?

759th
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,840
Right.

760
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,440
Pick up something for Rosie.

761
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,160
Come on, baby.

762
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,320
Want something?

763
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,440
Yes, just one dish.

764
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,160
- Okay?
- Yes, I got it.

765
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,120
Here we go, Rosie.

766
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:58,080
A big chunk and
nice for you.

767
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,480
Eat it?

768
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,920
A bit of grandma's mashed potatoes.

769
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,680
Tommy, want some?

770
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,760
No, I'm not hungry.

771
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,480
This is very good.
Want some?

772
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,400
Just a little butter.

773
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,720
A piece of turkey, honey?

774
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,160
Mom, you know
I do not eat meat.

775
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,440
- Only one piece.
- Yes

776
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,440
- Linda?
- No, I'm fine.

777
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,120
Why not hear the truck?
should have returned to her.

778
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,440
again within minutes.
Do not worry.

779
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,120
I worry, right?
I care if you like.

780
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,560
And do not tell me to
do not worry.

781
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,080
- I should have returned.
- Linda, sit.

782
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,280
- We must be prepared.
- I will be prepared.

783
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,720
Only spent a few minutes.

784
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:01,160
- Sat.
- Mommy, Daddy will come back.

785
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,960
Right.
How are you, darling?

786
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,760
- What was that?
- My God!

787
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,280
It was a shot!

788
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,720
what is happening?

789
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,360
What was that?

790
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,600

It is the light that hurt
Brian's hand!

802
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,160
- Come here!
- Linda!

803
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,320
Kurt said not to go out.

804
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,160
Linda, I promised him.

805
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,520
I need to see if he is okay.

806
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,960
Look, I said
we would expect the beats.

807
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,360
Three strikes.
So we know that they are ..

808
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,680
I'm sure are fine.
Must have been the minivan.

809
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:34,520
- Right Linda?
- What?

810
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,720
- The pickup truck was the truck.
- Right.

811
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,800
It has to be fine.

812
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,440
Yes, Linda, are fine.
We do not hear screams or anything.

813
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:50,880
Need to let me out.
I gotta go see if they're good.

814
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,760
- Listen to me, you better stay here.
- No, let me out.

815th
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,160
C'mon, is not entitled.
No part of this family.

816
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,400
Linda ...

817
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,400
Easy, easy.

818
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,440
You'll feel better sit down.

819
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,760
- Everything will be fine.
- Right ...

820
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,040
I think everyone
We must stay calm.

821
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,680
You're right.

822
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,560
Rosie has to touch it now?

823
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,840
Rosie?

824
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,040
Mom, you taught her to play like that?

825
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,800
What?

826
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,040
No.

827
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,080
Rosie, is not so, dear.

828
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,880
Where did you learn that?

829
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,200
I do not know ...

830
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,120
what are you doing?

831
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,920
- What you have?
- Sorry ...

832
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,400
- I can not believe it.
- What are you doing?

833
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,720
- I thought it was you!
- Yeah, sure!

834
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,680
- I felt as if I were you!
- Oh, God.

835
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,040
Oh, God.

836
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,240
- I did not mean they do not understand?
- Yes

837
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,600
Mama, calm.
Everything will be fine, trust me.

838
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,920
Look, I said
We should have gone ...

839
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,120
- Shit!
- What?

840
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,680
- The battery is almost over.
- Ah, finally.

841
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,480
I have another in my room.
Wait a minute.

842
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,960
Honey, that's fine.

843
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,720
Matthew, I pass the
bottle of wine that is there?

844
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,400
Please.

845
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,400
Mama, I think I drank too much.

846
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,800
A cup was all I took.

847
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,440
He had been drinking ...
just think that maybe ...

848
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,520
Sure. 16 years
And think they know everything.

849
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,720
You have no idea.

850
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,320
Mom, I just say ...

851
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,920
Tommy, if you want a little time
in a while, just to relax.

852
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,600
There is nothing in it.

853
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,360
Not once in a while.
It would be better if only it were wine.

854
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,880
To treat me
as an alcoholic.

855
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,800
Could turn the heat?
I'm freezing.

856
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,680
maybe we should put
covered in another Renee.

857
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,280
How is she?

858
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,400
- I do not know.
- I do not think I heard?

859
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,680
Honey, come see this.

860
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,960
- Look, Look at that.
- My God!

861
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,960
What is she?

862
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,920
Mommy, My God!

863
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,080
Matthew, What is she?
What is it in your mouth?

864
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,040
Oh, my God.

865
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,080
Take it.

866
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,600
This is disgusting.

867
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,440
Okay?
Gonna be okay?

868
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,480
'll Be fine.

869
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,280
What was that?

870
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,800
I do not know, was a kind of ...

871
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,720
Help me with it.

872
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,560
What does she have?
You said it was fine.

873
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,840
Got something.

874
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,000
Tommy, bring another
cover of the closet.

875
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:36,200
- Should I go with you?
- I look like a baby?

876
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,720
Do not scare me.

877
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,680
Do not you dare
to come here, damn ...

878
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,760
Do not you dare.

879
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,640
Oh, God!

880
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,680
You idiot, I
break your head.

881
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,200
Oh, God! Mommy!

882
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,280
Mom, it's gone!

883
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,960
Mommy, he's gone!

884
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,000
- Listen!
- What?

885
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,480
He's gone.

886
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:47,960
Who was it?

887
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,880
He is not there.

888
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,120
How can you say that was?

889
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,480
I do not know, I think I did not kill.

890
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,240
The cabinet on
door is removed.

891
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,160
- Kurt! It's Kurt!
- No!

892
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,640
Open the door.

893
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,400
Were only two hits.
He said three.

894
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:20,440
I do not care what he said is.

895
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,560
Open the door.

896
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,920
Open the door!

897
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:31,000
'm Not opening the door, Linda.

898
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,920
Matthew, they can be there.

899
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,840
I think they want to enter.

900
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,920
- Please, Matthew.
- Right.

901
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,480
Get away from the door.
Clear.

902
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,480
Come on back.

903
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,400
Kurt!

904
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,000
We have not heard the
sound truck.

905
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,200
- What?
- Let's sit down.

906
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,040
I need to see him out there.

907
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,720
Let Linda, calm down.

908
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,160
Feels.

909
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:15,040
- No, I need to leave.
- Listen to me, you will not leave!

910
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,840
Give me my coat.

911
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:24,920
Listen.

912
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,920
No big deal.

913
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,960
If you are out there.

914
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:34,760
I will walk my
car, bring it here.

915
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:38,280
We went, we left here
and end of story.

916
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,160
Matthew, I think not
should leave us alone.

917
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,720
Listen, everything will be fine.
I will not go very far.

918
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,000
Will go there, get in my car.

919
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,040
and I bring up here.
Everything will be alright.

920
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:53,200
Honey, gotta go.

921
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,960
Need it.

922
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,880
No, they may need.

923
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,520
- You can use, no?
- I know.

924
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,840
- Mel?
- Yes.

925th
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,520
Right.

926
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,560
Te amo.

927
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,480
Wait, Matthew ...

928
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,560
Well Linda, gets the
Rosie. Mama, Tommy ...

929
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,360
Wake up to Renee.

930
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,800
- That was fast.
- What was that?

931
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,600
Matthew!

932
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:59,160
Aileen burchess Ph.D.
Cultural anthropologist.

933
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,920
From the anthropological point of view ...

934
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,480
the behavior of these beings ...

935
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,160
could be considered very logical.

936
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:10,800
Done, sequestration of McPherson ...

937
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,840
Could be interpreted
as an inferior species

938
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,440
Taking samples
of a minor species.

939
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,800
They may actually have had the
intention of capturing or not McPherson.

940
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,800
Or felt so threatened ...

941
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,560
that attacked them.

942
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,680
If the brother had not iinterrompido ...

943
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,480
The process that made the cow ...

944
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:30,920
nothing would have happened.

945
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,400
- Where is it?
- Matthew? Mel!

946
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,960
- It was not Matthew?
- No, nobody.

947
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,440
Nobody?

948
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,120
See Renee

949
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:53,960
- The phone.
- The Radio.

950
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,840
- What?
- I do not know.

951
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,600
He looked at everything? What?

952
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,400
I do not understand. Makes no sense.

953
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,640
The breaker never did.

954
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,240
No, Linda, stay calm.

955
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,960
The start times for the light and back.

956
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,800
Nothing makes this circuit function.

957
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,160
- They are playing with us.
- Scott.

958
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,880
Scott, where were you? We wait.

959
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,880
Mom, okay?

960
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:42,840
I'm fine, but could
appear from time to time.

961
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,440
- Mom, with you talking about?
- Turn on the television, Tommy.

962
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,160
I'll get a beer
for you, dear.

963
01:08:50,523 --> 01:08:53,920
Melanie, do not interrupt me
when I'm talking with his father.

964
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,520
Oh no no, Mom.

965
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,440
Do not you dare raise your hand ...

966
01:08:59,446 --> 01:09:00,760
to his father.

967
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,880
let us all sit down.

968
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:22,440
'm Hot, very hot.

969
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,480
Yes, here it is very hot.

970
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,320
The heating must be bad.

971
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:33,840
Mom has no energy.

972
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,200
Not talk to me like that.

973
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:40,640
I'm also hot.
Give me water mama?

974
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,040
Sure honey.

975
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,840
All right.

976
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:00,960
- They cut the water.
- Okay. I do not need.

977
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,680
Do not cut the water,
no electricity.

978
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,400
You must drink in the refrigerator.

979
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,800
Still should be cold.

980
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,400
Think there's a spider stabbing me.

981
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,280
What's here? What is this?

982
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,560
You are burning me!

983
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,880
See if you also have
a? I?

984
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,000
Better water.

985
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:48,080
- They cut the water.
- It's burning!

986
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,720
It hurts!

987
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,000
I have a burn on his neck.

988
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:55,960
It has cream for burns?

989
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,280
- In the bathroom.
- My God!

990
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,360
Mama, stay calm.
Do not scratch that.

991
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,320
Rosie, your neck? It has nothing?

992
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,840
- Okay.
- Also is burning?

993
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,560
Yes, it burns too.

994
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,400
- Rosie, and his neck?
- Okay, Mom.

995
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,800
What are you doing, Honey?

996
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,520
Put ice.

997
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,240
Will stop burning, Melanie.

998
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,240
I hope so, because very doi.

999
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,600
Will stop burning.

1000
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,840
Passed.

1001
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:49,840
Has passed.

1002
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,800
It was only for a few minutes.

1003
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,840
It is impossible.

1004
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,560
Turned on the dishwasher?

1005
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,320
- What?
- God!

1006
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,920
- What are they doing?
- I do not know.

1007
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I'm in heat again.

1008
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:22,640
- God, Linda!
- Kurt!

1009
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,720
Oh, shit!

1010
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,880
- What?
- My God!

1011
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,520
Come on, Rosie, come home.

1012
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,960
Let's go home, Grandma.
Everything will be fine.

1013
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,520
Linda ...

1014
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,120
- It is not safe.
- My God!

1015
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,840
The lead my God

1016
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,480
Because if they put them?

1017
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,160
- It's all your fault.
- Do not do anything.

1018
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:17,800
Kurt! Answer me,
where are you?

1019
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,400
Mom, okay.
come home.

1020
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:22,320
Stay calm.
Honey, help me?

1021
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,280
Rosie is right, we'll come back.

1022
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:26,520
Should be on the road.

1023
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,520
Back in a minute.
Come, dear.

1024
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:32,320
Are dead. I know.

1025
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,360
Please ...

1026
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,120
Linda ...

1027
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:55,040
All back inside, already.

1028
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,160
Run, run!

1029
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,400
- Who did?
- Do not look at me.

1030
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,200
Do not touch.

1031
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,920
Tommy, break.

1032
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,960
The light!
We must go!

1033
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,600
Run, come on.

1034
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,520
Stay here.

1035
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,720
Tommy, do nothing.

1036
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,840
- Okay.
- What?

1037
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,560
Para.

1038
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,680
Honey, we can not stay here.

1039
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,360
- What was that?
- The door opened.

1040
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,120
- We may enter.
- No, let's go.

1041
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,240
- Wait - Rosie ...
- Wait.

1042
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,000
Honey, I think is right.

1043
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:28,520
Is the phone.
Must be Kurt.

1044
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,360
- Stay here.
- Mel!

1045
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,120
Come on!

1046
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,560
- Who was that?
- Nobody. - What?

1047
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,120
Never fade.
Are already cleared.

1048
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,240
Honey, tell me.
What do we do?

1049
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,280
- The door!
- Did you hear that beat?

1050
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,240
- Want to get.
- It's Kurt!

1051
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,880
Not the Kurt! Back off!

1052
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,480
Do not open.

1053
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,600
Help me close the door.

1054
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,480
Tommy drop the camera ...

1055
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,520
for a second and help me!

1056
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,720
Now this.

1057
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,320
The front door!

1058
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,680
Yes, I clasp.

1059
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,880
What are you doing?

1060
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,040
We can not let them leave.

1061
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,560
- We should not leave.
- We tried to protect you!

1062
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,280
They should not leave. Stop it!

1063
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:40,000
Renne died.

1064
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,240
And demonstrate that they are creatures of that size.

1065
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,040
And how.

1066
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,880
Renee died.

1067
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:24,840
How can?
It was alive a minute ago.

1068
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,840
- It makes no sense.
- Silence.

1069
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,400
I can not hear your heart.

1070
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,600
Can not because she's dead.

1071
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,000
Honey, Rosie, come here. Stay away.

1072
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,200
Why?

1073
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,240
It's so cold.

1074
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,320
Tommy, I do not know what to do.

1075
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,320
- Mel
- God, Renee.

1076
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,680
Mel ...

1077
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,720
Honey, come on.

1078
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,720
Honey, come on!

1079
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,200
Died!

1080
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,240
Come on, let it, is dead!

1081
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,520
Come on.

1082
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:02,960
Drink up.

1083
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,040
Come on, Mom, come on.

1084
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,800
Tía Honey, can you do?

1085
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:15,520
Have hot water in the kettle.

1086
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,200
Come on, we will have something to do.

1087
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:32,800
Kurt and I when we were teens ...

1088
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:34,480
used to play ...

1089
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:40,760
Please Linda, do not continue.

1090
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:45,000
We played cards.

1091
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,840
Good idea, Rosie.

1092
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,560
We can play "The Fish".

1093
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,400
- Tommy, get the cards.
- Mommy ...

1094
01:20:58,160 --> 01:21:00,600
Requests to do so.

1095
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm not hungry.

1096
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:12,680
I do not want ...

1097
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,600
Take the cards.

1098
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:30,760
I was thinking in
a beautiful white tone ...

1099
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,960
to Tommy's room.

1100
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,680
What?

1101
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,320
The room.

1102
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,760
I guess I wanted the same color ...

1103
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,360
that has the rest of the house.

1104
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,600
No, think white would look better.

1105
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,120
I'm having migraines.

1106
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,320
I think it was by looking for
this camera all day.

1107
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,080
It was all day with
this camera. Her wide.

1108
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,600
Bring an aspirin.

1109
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,960
My name is Thomas McPherson

1110
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,480
We are attacked by
Extraterrestrials.

1111
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,080
I think they killed my brothers ...

1112
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,800
Kurt and Brian McPherson.

1113
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,920
Renee killed ...

1 114
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,200
The bride of my brother Brian.

1115
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,480
Matthew, the groom of my sister Mel ...

1116
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:27,040
Are still out there.

1117
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,720
I guess we'll wait
here until dawn.

1118
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,240
Do not want to die.

1119
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,600
I'm very afraid.

1120
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,440
I do not think we will succeed.

1121
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,080
Daddy is not here is strange.

1122
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,480
I can not believe
in what is happening.

1123
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,360
I want it to end soon.

1124
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,480
Love you mom, love you Linda.

1125
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:36,520
Love you honey, love you Rosie.

1126
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,880
Uncle Tommy, it's time
to drop the camera.

1127
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:30,080
I remember the pickup of Brian.

1128
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:44,000
Uncle Tommy, take it.

1129
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:01,800
- What are you playing?
- "Fishing".

1130
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,960
- How many cards?
- Seven.

1131
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:28,360
- What to play?
- "Fishing".

1132
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,360
Tommy, okay?

1133
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:34,240
Yes, my head.
You are killing me.

1134
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,760
Take an aspirin or something.

1135
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,240
It's killing me is serious.

1136
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:47,200
You can stop, Rosie?
'm With migraine.

1137
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,600
Rosie? Do not see that
Tommy is a migraine?

1138
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,400
Come on Rosie, stop.
The mother is also sick.

1139
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:04,040
Rosie, can you stop? Hurts me head.

1140
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,480
- I'm not supporting.
- Come on, Rosie.

1141
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,280
Uncle Tommy is now better?

1142
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,400
- Yes, much better.
- Leave now.

1143
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,080
Not Rosie, is not going anywhere.

1144
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,600
Dad will wait here.

1145
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,320
I do not want him back
and not find us here.

1146
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,320
Not return.

1147
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,480
Complete splitting.

1148
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,760
- How many letters?
- Seven.

1149
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:44,360
Rosie will not play?

1150
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,920
Gotta take care of other things.

1151
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,680
A good rest in the
guest room.

1 152
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,440
Daddy would like that, huh?

1153
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,880
Dad died Mom.

1154
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,480
- Give me five.
- It will not win.

1155
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,400
My God!

1156
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,640
We must go, go!

1157
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,680
Come on!

1158
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:49,760
Come on Linda! Come on, what was it?

1159
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,400
Linda!

1160
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,000
Rosie!
