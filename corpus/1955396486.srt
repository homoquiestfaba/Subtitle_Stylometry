          SALLY: Well,          

121
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,011
   don't have another one.      
   You're going to              
   be a father soon.            

122
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,346
               I know.

00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,248
          That guy was a nurse? 
 Yeah.                          

124
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,450
 He was in John's               
 class in high school.          
                    Who was?

          Jason.                
          Jason... Jason Owens? 

126
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,721
 He married Gwen.

                  JOHN: Really? 

130
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:10,796
              I can't believe I 
              didn't know that.

       in high school.

 They were engaged,             
 for God's sake.

00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,107

                a girlfriend

  Nothing.

  your CAT scans.

 a pretty big brain tumor       
 near your frontal lobe.

00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,262
 Shit, I'm late for work. Shit. 

343
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:05,363
 JOHN: No,                      
 don't worry about it.          

344
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,965
 Look, I got your               
 briefcase right here.          

345
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,299
         Coffee.                

346
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,869
    Thank you, John.            
 Yeah, you got it.              

347
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:14,739
 So, just go to work            
 and I'll stay here             
 with Mom.                      

348
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,542
         DON: You sure?         
          JOHN: Yeah.           

349
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,845
     I just don't know what     
     I'd do if I lost her.      

350
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,013
            (CRYING)            
  Dad.                          

351
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,482
 Dad, you can't                 
 think like that.               

352
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,619
            I know.             

353
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,388
 It's gonna be okay.            

354
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,256
 It's gonna be okay.            
 You'll see.                    

355
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,059
            I know.             

356
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,060
               (SNIFFLES)       

357
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,265
             Yeah.              

358
00:16:48,742 --> 00:16:51,209
 And he's gone,                 
 so you can stop pretending.    

359
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,710
                Thank God.      

360
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,179
        How you doing?          

361
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,215
            He cried all night. 
            If I didn't know    
            any better,         

362
00:16:57,217 --> 00:17:00,218
          I'd think             
          he was the one        
          with the brain tumor. 

363
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,487
 I think he might be            
 going through                  
 a little something, so...      

364
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,822
          Ron told you we're    
          about to go bankrupt? 

365
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,157
 Come on.                       
 He said no one knew.           

366
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,692
       I keep the books.        

367
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,030
 Is he gonna be all right?      

368
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,731
                I don't know.   

369
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,201
                I don't know.   

370
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,104
 Well, I brought breakfast.     

371
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,443
        Pretzels and ice cream? 

372
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,912
   If you don't want it,        
   I can just...                
           No, no, no.          

373
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:28,679
      I'm not saying that.      

374
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,384
 So, how you doing?             

375
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,120
                  I feel great. 

376
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,489
 You know, I've been            
 googling brain tumors.         

377
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:40,058
 A lot more common              
 than you'd think.              

378
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,259
                     Yeah?      
       Yeah.                    

379
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,361
 Did you know                   
 Bob Marley had one?            

380
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,864
            How'd that work out 
            for him?            

381
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,533
    Well, he sold               
    a lot of records,           

382
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,535
 so... Got a little             
 catching up to do.             
         (BOTH CHUCKLE)         

383
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:53,538
 You're gonna be okay, Mom.     

384
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:55,773
 You'll get through this.       

385
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:59,143
 I mean, even                   
 the procedure seems simple.    

386
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:01,012
 Just a tiny little hole        
 in your skull,                 
 and they go in and...          

387
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,146
                    John.       

388
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,817
                 How's Rebecca? 

389
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,753
 She's good, you know...        
           JASON: Oh.           

390
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,156
                Hello. (LAUGHS) 

391
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,958
                   What's this, 
                   Mrs. Hollar? 

392
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,694
       We're having some        
       ice cream for breakfast? 

393
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,930
 Ice cream and pretzels,        
 one of my mom's                
 favorite things.               

394
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,799
           Yeah. Hey, how 'bout 
           heart attacks?       

395
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,468
          Is that one of her    
          favorite things, too? 

396
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,204
    No. What? Why?              

397
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,773
         Why? Well, because     
         your mother's          
         a borderline diabetic. 

398
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,241
 That's not true, is it?        

399
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:31,843
                   Maybe.       
             JASON: Yeah. Yeah. 

400
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:35,113
    No, it is. So this          
    probably wasn't             
    the best idea, was it, pal? 

401
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,048
          I'm gonna take these. 

402
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,950
  And, believe it or not,       
  we actually keep our patients 

403
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,885
        on a pretty strict diet 
        for a reason.           

404
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,621
 Sorry. I was just trying to do 
 something nice for her, so...  

405
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,223
          Next time,            
          like, try a gift card 

406
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,058
         or something harmless, 
         you know?              

407
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,892
              (LAUGHS)          

408
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,762
 I'm sorry, do you have         
 a problem with me or...        

409
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,399
           I don't know. Maybe. 

410
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:56,901
          Want... Want a little 
          chat in the hall?     

411
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:57,802
                We'll find out. 

412
00:18:58,571 --> 00:18:59,604
   I'll be right back.          

413
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,211
 What's going on, man?          

414
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,413
    Uh, "What's going on, man?" 

415
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,617
            Well, Gwen has been 
            asking about you,   
            like, nonstop       

416
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,218
            since she found out 
            your mom was here.  

417
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,653
 Yeah. No, I heard              
 you guys were...               

418
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,721
                   Married?     
       Yeah.                    

419
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,023
                 Yeah. Yeah.    
 Congratulations.               

420
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,260
            She just had a kid, 
            too, so...          

421
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,562
 Well, you both                 
 have a kid, so that...         
 That's awesome.                

422
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,330
 Congratulations for            
 both of you, right?            

423
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,567
            Dude, please,       
            can we cut the shit 
            here for a second?  

424
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,036
    Yeah.                       
          I mean, like, are you 
          gonna try anything?   

425
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,905
     What?                      
              Are you gonna try 
              anything with her 

426
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,940
          while you're in town? 
  No, no, no.                   

427
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,441
 No. No, no, no.                
                  Yeah?         

428
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,278
 No, I... I have                
 a great girl in New York,      

429
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,713
 and we're actually             
 about to have a baby, so...    

430
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:44,515
             Oh, great.         
             So you're married. 

431
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,984
  Uh, no.                       
  No, we're not.                

432
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,620
      I thought you said you... 
      You're gonna have a baby. 

433
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,956
 I did say I was                
 gonna have a baby, but...      
 I'm not married.               

434
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,125
    Well, why aren't            
    you getting married         
    if you're gonna have a kid? 

435
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,561
 Well, it's a long story.       
 You know, we talked about it.  
 But, uh...                     

436
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,062
 Why does that matter?          
                  I don't know. 

437
00:19:58,064 --> 00:19:59,297
          I'm just saying,      
          like, don't you think 

438
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,065
    your kid's gonna resent you 
    for making it a bastard?    

439
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,967
 It's not gonna be              
 a bastard.                     

440
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,802
      Technically,              
      the kid will be a...      
      That's what a bastard is. 

441
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,270
 Point is, I...                 
 I haven't had any              
 feelings for Gwen.             

442
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,405
 Not for a long, long time.     

443
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:08,639
   So...                        
                  Yeah.         

444
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,609
          She still looks good. 

445
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:13,611
 I... Bet she does.             

446
00:20:13,613 --> 00:20:16,314
               Like, great.     
 Okay.                          

447
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,416
      You know,                 
      maybe better than before. 

448
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,318
 I don't even know              
 what that means, but...        

449
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,552
        In that case,           
        you want to get dinner? 

450
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,421
       What?                    

451
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,224
                Tomorrow night. 

452
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,226
           Gwen wanted me       
           to invite you to     
           dinner at our house. 

453
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,260
       That's why               
       we're chatting out       
       here in the hall.        

454
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:34,498
 Um, yeah, no, I...             
 Yeah, that would be nice.      

455
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,701
            All right, good.    
            Well, I'll let her  
            know you're coming. 

456
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:39,003
 Great. All right, well,        
 it was good to see you.        
                This is good.   

457
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,204
 Yeah? Glad you like it.        

458
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,505
             It's a nice combo. 

459
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:51,949
            (SIGHS)             

460
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,753
  Where is everyone?            

461
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,021
                    Not here.   

462
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,189
 Well, where are they?          

463
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,024
                Called in sick. 
        Everyone?               

464
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,393
            Mmm-hmm.            
              Why?              

465
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,594
      I'm guessing it           
      had something to do with  

466
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,696
            not getting paid    
            for two weeks.      

467
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:08,666
 Well, don't they               
 know about Sally?              

468
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:12,470
        Unfortunately, guilting 
        people into free labor  
        only works on family.   

469
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,039
 I wish I had more sisters.     

470
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,507
                 Yeah, me, too. 

471
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,676
               How's she doing? 

472
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,346
 (SOBS) I don't know.           

473
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,348
 I better go check on her.      

474
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,751
      No, I'll go check on her. 
      You need to get to work.  

475
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,753
       We got an order          
       this morning, thank God. 

476
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:31,322
 All right. Here.               

477
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,562
 Take this card                 
 and pay everyone               
 for last week.                 

478
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,731
         You can't afford that. 
 Just do it anyway.             

479
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,700
 And tell 'em to get            
 their asses back to work.      

480
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:46,470
                    Okay.       

481
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,541
 What about your                
 cartoon story?                 

482
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,011
         They don't call it     
         a cartoon story, Mom.  

483
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,981
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.          

484
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,049
 I mean, what's it called?      

485
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,718
               A graphic novel. 

486
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,987
      How is it?                

487
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,258
                     (SIGHS)    

488
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,727
            Let's face it, Mom, 
            I made a mistake.   

489
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,498
             I'm not an artist. 

490
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,937
 And that's okay.               

491
00:22:24,277 --> 00:22:25,543
                Rebecca sent me 
                some of it.     

492
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:28,979
    Oh, my God,                 
    she did not.                

493
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,981
          She says she thinks   
          you should try        
          and get it published. 

494
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,184
 Yeah. I bet she does.          

495
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,186
                 Why don't you? 
    Because, Mom,               

496
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,121
 you know, sometimes            
 things aren't good enough.     

497
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,825
                I like Rebecca. 

498
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:41,892
                 She's pushy.   

499
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:42,860
      Yeah.                     

500
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,730
         Men need to be pushed. 

501
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,202
           You know,            
           when your father and 
           I first got married, 

502
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,603
           we lived in Detroit. 

503
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,575
        He worked in            
        a small office downtown 

504
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,510
               next to          
               the Fox Theatre. 

505
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,149
     I'd pick him up every day. 
     He never really knew why.  

506
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,586
     Your father would          
     get off work at 5:00,      

507
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:11,589
        and I'd leave our       
        apartment at 3:00       

508
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,791
   and walk down to the Fox.    

509
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:18,996
    There was never             
    a show on at that time.     

510
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,733
         And I'd go in          

511
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,102
      and I'd sit in            
      one of those seats.       

512
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:31,642
        And I'd look up         
        at the ceiling.         

513
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:36,113
                      It was... 

514
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,516
                Unlike anything 
                I'd ever seen.  

515
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,620
 And this enormous chandelier.  

516
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:46,690
           It was breathtaking. 

517
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:49,894
                 And every day, 
                 I'd go back,   

518
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,730
           I'd go in,           

519
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,033
         and I'd look up.       

520
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,105
      You've never              
      told me that story.       

521
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:09,013
   I never really got a chance  
   to pursue anything creative. 

522
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:11,816
    I was so young when I       
    married your father,        
    and then Ronnie came along. 

523
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,785
             So...              

524
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,456
    Do you ever wish you        
    did anything different?     

525
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,424
      Oh, yeah, big-time.       

526
00:24:20,426 --> 00:24:22,793
 Really?                        
        Definitely. Definitely. 

527
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:24,728
           Like what?           

528
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,532
         I'm not sure           
         I ever should have     
         married your father.   

529
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,635
         Wait. What?            

530
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,838
            Grandma!            
            Grandma!            

531
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,874
 Girls! Oh, my goodness!        

532
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:39,477
           Oh, what are you two 
           doing out of school? 

533
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:41,579
 I don't want you               
 to die, Grandma.               

534
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,180
 Don't you worry                
 about that.                    

535
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,648
    But, Dad said you will.     

536
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,317
    Well, what does he know?    

537
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,718
        We brought              
        pretzels and ice cream. 

538
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,454
     Oh, that is so sweet.      

539
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,890
      CONSTANCE:                
      Whoa, grandma,            
      is that your tumor?       

540
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:56,327
          Oh, come here, honey, 
          and give me a hug.    

541
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,697
       Okay. I'm gonna go       
       for a drive, so...       

542
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,599
     Do you need anything?      
              I wouldn't mind   
              a bag of Doritos. 

543
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,868
              I was asking Mom. 
 No, honey, I'm fine.           

544
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,504
      Okay. Great.              
      I'll be right back, okay? 

545
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,072
               See you guys     
               in a little bit! 
    Bye-bye!                    

546
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,375
                      Ta-da!    
        Ah!

548
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:17,581
             Hello?             

549
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:20,384
  Oh, thank God you're there.   

550
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,520
 It is so good to               
 hear your voice.

         Dad is... Gonna lose   
         his business, I think. 

555
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:38,569
      And... Mom said           
      she actually thinks       
      she regrets marrying him.

00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:45,009
          Wait, why does your   
          mom's nurse hate you? 

558
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,878
       Who knows?               
       It's just some jackass   
       from high school.        

559
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,747
      Well, what's his problem? 
      You need me to            
      come down there?

          <i> Right? So...</i>         

566
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:07,998
 Well, no, yeah, but...         

567
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,300
 Oh, boy.                       

568
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:11,268
    Look, Rebecca, don't worry. 
    Nothing is gonna happen.    

569
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,238
         I don't feel anything  
         for her anymore, okay? 

570
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,206
   I mean, she just had a baby, 
   for God's sake.              

571
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,710
         Oh. Yeah.              

572
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,279
 Oh. What an incredibly...

 say to me right now.

00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:27,851
             No, that's not

       that out, please,        

580
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,664
          and just call me      
          a little later?       

581
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:43,467
 Okay, Rebecca,                 
 I didn't mean to...            

582
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:45,369
          No, I... It... I'm... 

583

    I'm fine. I just...         
    I need to get back to work. 

584
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,207
      Okay.

588
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,118
 I don't think I can get them   
 to give you another loan,      

589
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,354
 given your current             
 financial status.              

590
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:06,423
        Business is picking up. 
        Oh, yeah, no,           
        I should've told you.   

591
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,793
       Yeah. In fact, I'm gonna 
       hire a new salesman.     

592
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:11,962
            Soon, to drum up    
            some more business. 

593
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,499
           Jim, I need to cover 
           payroll for a month  

594
00:27:15,501 --> 00:27:17,534
                 and that's it.

 Well, I...                     
 I wish there was               
 something I could do.

                   Jim,         

597
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,275
       I'm a member of          
       the chamber of commerce. 

598
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:27,645
         I can't even take      
         my own kids out        
         for dinner. (CHUCKLES) 

599
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,079

600
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,981
 you may be uncomfortable       
 talking about this, but...

00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,687
 it might be                    
 your safest option.            

603
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,355
                 Bankruptcy?    
      Yeah.                     

604
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,428
           I gave my life       
           to this business.

                   I don't call 

684
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,621
          just because          
          I don't use the phone 
          that much anymore.    

685
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,289
 You used to call               
 Gwen all the time.

687

     It's okay.                 

688
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,862
 It's okay.                     
 I understand. Leave it.        

689
00:32:45,864 --> 00:32:47,297
               Understand what? 

690
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:49,366
    You're jealous.

            and Dad's basement. 

693
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:58,208
 You resent me, don't you?      
 You resent all of us.          

694
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,743
 That is why you                
 moved so far away.             

695
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:01,311
            I moved to New York 
            because there's     
            nothing here.       

696
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,646
 There's nothing here?

00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,752
                Well, whatever. 

698
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:10,721
 Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,523
 I don't care, either.

 Just don't offend              
 this guy, okay?                

701
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:20,397
      How can I help you?       
 Yes, thank you                 
 for taking the time.           

702
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,898
 My brother and I               
 were just wondering            

703
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,233
          if you could          
          explain the procedure 
          a little bit more...  

704
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,334
 I wasn't wondering.

707
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:31,475
      Um, well, thank you.      

708
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,378
         The procedure.         
          JOHN: Yeah.           

709
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,146

 as a kid.

712
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:41,918
 My instructor                  
 was actually black,            

713
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,155
 but I'm pretty sure            
 he spent some time in China.   

714
00:33:45,157 --> 00:33:47,224
                   Why?         
 With the Chinese.              

715
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:51,762

          So, doesn't apply.    

717

  do you do?

      here is

    that book's depressing.     

798
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:48,305
       Oh, you think            
       everything's depressing. 

799
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,675
        Well, you've seen       
       <i> Seven,</i> right?           

800
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,476
                  I have, yeah. 
           Whatever.            

801
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,778
     How did you get            
     Quinn to stop crying?      

802
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,047
                  Oh, I didn't. 
                  John did it.  

803
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,951
    Oh, what, are you, like,    
    some kind of baby           
    whisperer guy, or...        

804
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,920
                   Mmm. No. No. 

805
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,755
 Jason can never get            
 her to stop crying.            

806
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,791
    JOHN: Oh, really?           
    Well, that's                
    probably just bad luck.     

807
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,759
        Yeah, I mean...         

808
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:11,995
      It's just bad luck.       

809
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,131
 You hungry?                    
                      Starving. 

810
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:16,733
 Yeah, let's eat.               
                 Okay, great.   

811
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,169
          Here you go.          
                  Thanks.       

812
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:22,539
     Okay, kiddo,               
     it's bedtime for you.      
     You want...                

813

      Are you kidding me?       

814
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,477
      It was really good.       
      Thank you very much.      

815
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:30,380
 So, uh, what's the story       
 with your girlfriend?          

816
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,482
 Why didn't she                 
 come back with you?            

817
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,617
          Girlfriend?           
   Mmm.

00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,853
  Oh, yeah,                     
  I didn't tell you?            
              No.               

819
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,755
 Yeah. No, they're gonna        
 have a kid together            
 and everything.                

820
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,259
            Oh, wow.            

821
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,893
     Wow. Congratulations.      
                   Thank you.   

822
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,095
                 Thank you.     

823
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,129
      So, when's she due?       

824
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,464
               Soon, very soon. 

825
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,566
 They're not even married.      

826
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:50,667
                     Hmm.       

827
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:52,068
          Well, you know, we... 

828
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:55,438
   Really wanting a bastard,    
   so we got it.                

829
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,141
 I proposed to Gwen the second  
 I saw the pregnancy test       
 in the trash.                  

830
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,542
 I jumped on it,                
 'cause you don't               
 want to, you know...           

831
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:00,810
               That's romantic. 

832
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,545
     Yeah.                      
        So, how'd you meet her? 

833
00:38:02,547 --> 00:38:04,648
       At a comic book store,   
       actually.                

834
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,883
 Oh, she like a...              
 Like a nerd or...              

835
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:11,888
               No, she's, uh... 
               Adorable.        

836
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,591
 Okay. (CHUCKLES)               

837
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,992
 What she do?                   

838
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,762
         She has her            
         own company, actually. 

839
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,196
                Oh, doing what? 

840
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,798
      She designs pet clothing. 

841
00:38:25,103 --> 00:38:27,871
      So, just collars and hats 
      and sweaters and...       

842
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,473
                      Nice.     

843
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,975
 JASON:                         
 Oh, you can make a living      

844
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,943
 designing pet clothing         
 in New York?                   

845
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:36,413
 That's...                      
         No, not... Not really. 

846
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:41,184
 Um, I don't                    
 understand then.               

847
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:43,520
                  Her parents   
                  are rich-ish. 
      Hmm.                      

848
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,655
     How rich?                  

849
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,557
                They bought her 
                a brownstone    
                for graduation. 

850
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,193
              Wow.              

851
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:53,430
 Okay. Well, now I see          
 why you don't want             
 to get married.                

852

                   (LAUGHING)   
                   Why is that? 

853

 Mmm. Well, it's like,          
 what's the point, really?      

854
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,537
 Going through                  
 all that, you know?            

855
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,871
 Getting everything             
 you want out of it,            

856
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,340
 and she's taking               
 care of you, so...             

857
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,175
          GWEN: Jason.          
  What?                         

858
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,010
      Well, no, no, it's not... 
      It's not like that.       

859
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,279
          I mean, we keep our   
          money separate, so... 

860
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,613
 But you don't have             
 any money.                     

861
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:11,614
                  You're drunk. 

862
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,883
 So?                            

863
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,618
              So go do          
              the dishes, okay? 

864
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:18,521
      Okay.                     

865
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,024
 Right. Okay. Sure.             

866
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,994
 You don't have                 
 any money, right?              
                Jason.          

867
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:26,963
    Okay.

00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,749
       I went over to her       
       house for dinner,

      she kissed me!

                   Okay.

00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,094
                Okay, so...     
                You kissed her?

  you didn't have               
  feelings for her anymore,     

882
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,304
        and she just had a kid.

 I don't. She did.

 Oh, by the way,                
 she still looks great!

 about your mom.                

1023
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,397
       And...                   

1024
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:16,432
 Honestly, with everything      
 you've been going through,     

1025
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:18,734
  I can't even tell             
  if you want to                
  have a baby at all.           

1026
00:47:18,736 --> 00:47:20,403
 So I thought                   
 if you knew that               
 it was two, you'd...           

1027
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:22,972
 It would be too much.          

1028
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:25,107
            Wait. "Everything   
            I'm going through"? 

1029
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:27,276
 You're not happy, John.        
 It's obvious.                  

1030
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:31,247
 At work, in your life and...   

1031
00:47:31,249 --> 00:47:33,049
  I don't know,                 
  maybe with me.                

1032
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,052
 And I know that you're...      

1033
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:37,954
                 No, I...       
 Just going                     
 through something and          

1034
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:40,256
 maybe everything               
 in your life isn't             

1035
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:43,226
 exactly what you               
 want it to be right now.       

1036
00:47:43,228 --> 00:47:45,995
 Um, and you're scared          
 and I get that.                

1037
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:47,730
 Having a baby is scary.        

1038
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:50,466
 And you think that             
 everything's                   
 gonna change and...            

1039
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:53,236
 We're not gonna be fun anymore 

1040
00:47:53,238 --> 00:47:54,537
 and you're not gonna           
 drink beer with your friends   

1041
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,072
 and you're gonna               

1042
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:58,441
 have to be stuck in            
 this job that you hate         

1043
00:47:58,443 --> 00:47:59,842
 and you're not gonna           

1044
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:01,611
 kiss your                      
 high school sweetheart         
 ever again...                  

1045
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:03,079

   No, I'm saying...            

1046
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:04,146
 I'm saying it's fine.          

1047
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,285
 And we're gonna                
 work through all of it         
 and you don't need to worry.   

1048
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:10,319
      Okay?                     

1049
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,122
             That's not what    
             I'm worried about. 

1050
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:18,294
     Okay. It's not?            

1051
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:19,195
                         No.    

1052
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,065
             I don't care       
             about any of that. 

1053

             Having twins is... 

1054
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:29,171
      Is one more person and... 

1055
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,642
              That's one more   
              person that...    

1056
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:38,514
          I'm gonna be failing. 

1057
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,249
          And I just don't know 
          if I can take that.   

1058
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:44,754
         What?                  

1059
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:45,922
  Is that what you think?       

1060

            I don't know, yeah. 

1061
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:58,100
 I didn't drive eight hours     
 'cause you were failing me.    

1062
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,136
 I came here 'cause I need you  

1063

       so much.                 

1064

 for you to come back.          

1065

                    Okay.

              (SNIFFLES) Okay.  

1067
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,029
 I need you                     
 to get me out of               
 this hospital, though.

 know where else to go,

              to talk about it? 

1096

        No. No.
