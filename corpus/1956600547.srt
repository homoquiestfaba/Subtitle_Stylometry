[Lionel]
<i>Frank always used to say,</i>

4
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,482
<i>"Tell your story walkin',
pal."</i>

5
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:43,982
<i>He was more philosophical
than your average gumshoe,</i>

6
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:46,315
<i>but he liked to do his talkin'
on the move,</i>

7
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:48,649
<i>so here's how
it all went down.</i>

8
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:50,948
<i>I got somethin' wrong
with my head.</i>

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,282
<i>That's the first thing
to know.</i>

10
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,482
If!

11
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:55,048
<i>It's like having glass
in the brain.</i>

12
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,515
<i>I can't stop
pickin' things apart...</i>

13
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,282
<i>twistin' 'em around,
reassembling 'em.</i>

14
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,649
<i>Words and sounds, especially.</i>

15
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:04,748
<i>It's like an itch
that has to be scratched.</i>

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,084
Quit pullin' at it. You're gonna
make a fuckin' mess out of things.

17
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:12,148
I got threads in my heads.

18
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,748
I got threads in my heads!

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,517
I got threads in my heads,
man!

20
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:19,748
<i>And I twitch a lot.</i>

21
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,182
<i>It's hard to miss.</i>

22
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:23,215
<i>It makes me look
like a goddamn spastic,</i>

23
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:26,082
<i>but if I try to hold it back,
it just makes it worse.</i>

24
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:27,282
Ah.

25
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:29,515
Shit, just help me out,
will ya?

26
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:32,249
Like I said, a fuckin' mess!

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,082
Jesus, Freakshow,
ruin another sweater.

28
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,050
No, cut it closer.
Cut it closer.

29
00:01:37,817 --> 00:01:39,982
<i>Fuckin' mess is right.</i>

30
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:43,482
<i>The nun said my soul wasn't at peace
with God and I should do penance.</i>

31
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:45,249
<i>Frank said anyone
teaching God's love</i>

32
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:46,881
<i>while they hit you
with a stick</i>

33
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:48,750
<i>should be ignored
on every subject.</i>

34
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,115
<i>Frank Minna.</i>

35
00:01:51,117 --> 00:01:53,549
<i>If you had to pick just
one guy to be on your side,</i>

36
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,182
<i>he's the one you'd want.</i>

37
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:58,215
<i>It's Minna's game.
We're all just in the lineup.</i>

38
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,349
- Boys.
- [Coney] Boss.

39
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:01,449
Frank.
Frankly Frankady Franko!

40
00:02:01,451 --> 00:02:02,848
[Frank] All right, listen.

41
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,415
Here's the shot.
I'll be up on the third floor.

42
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,415
Lionel will go to the payphone
in about 20 minutes.

43
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,848
When they come, probably
three or four of them,

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,215
when they come,
you call me here.

45
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,815
I'll buzz 'em in.
Coney waits at the door.

46
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,915
I buzz him in,
he stays inside.

47
00:02:16,917 --> 00:02:18,716
Lionel's listening,
sharp on the line.

48
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:22,048
If you hear me say, "We have
a problem," hustle over.

49
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,282
Coney lets you in.
The two of you come upstairs,

50
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:26,515
back me up quick.

51
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:27,915
What's going down here, Frank?

52
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,182
[sighs]

53
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:31,549
I gotta keep this
under my hat, boys.

54
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,982
Fat cats in hats!

55
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:34,415
Them's the ones, pal.

56
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,015
Let's catch a big score
and get fat ourselves.

57
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:39,015
- Boss, we're not carrying.
- What?

58
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:41,148
A piece. I don't have a piece.

59
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,682
"A piece"? Say "gun," Gilbert.

60
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,182
- Okay, I don't have a gun.
- That's what I count on.

61
00:02:46,184 --> 00:02:49,549
That's how I sleep at night,
you with no gun.

62
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,682
I got a gun. You just show up.

63
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:52,815
I wouldn't want
you chuckleheads

64
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:53,982
coming up a staircase

65
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:55,382
with a hairpin
and a harmonica.

66
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,082
Hairy chin, harmony harp!
Quit windin' me up.

67
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,915
With an unlit cigar
and a chicken wing.

68
00:02:59,917 --> 00:03:01,115
- Right, Brooklyn?
- Chicky wing ding.

69
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:02,515
I wing that chick in the ding.

70
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,048
- [laughing]
- [Lionel] Come on, seriously.

71
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,282
Don't throw me off.

72
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:07,649
Just give us the rest of it,
all right?

73
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:08,948
[Frank] All right, all right.

74
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,649
Now, if I say,
"Let me use the can,"

75
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,015
it means we're comin' out.

76
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:14,382
Get Gil, get in the car,
get ready to follow.

77
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:17,215
I might need to give
someone the slip. Got it?

78
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:18,515
Yeah. Problem up the stairs.

79
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,515
"Use the can,"
start the car. Got it.

80
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:22,082
Get, gotten, got, gotcha!

81
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,716
Lionel's got it,
just follow his lead.

82
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,616
Oh, come on,
you gotta be kiddin' me.

83
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:28,449
Coney, what did I say when I came
into the office last Tuesday?

84
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,349
- What?
- Lionel?

85
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:32,449
You hung up your coat, you put
your hat on the third hook,

86
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:33,716
you said, "I just saw
a girl on the ferry,

87
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:35,015
and the smile she gave me

88
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,515
is gonna get me
through the winter."

89
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,781
Then you threw your notebook
to Danny, and said,

90
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,182
"How's a guy supposed to keep

91
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,415
a marriage together
with 22 on the menu?"

92
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:42,417
Like I said,
Lionel's on point.

93
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,817
[indistinct chatter]

94
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,616
[Lionel]
Sit on it, Bailey!

95
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:49,682
<i>Fuckin' Bailey.</i>

96
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,048
If!

97
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,549
<i>Bailey's what my head
calls me.</i>

98
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,881
<i>It calls me out
whenever I try to resist it.</i>

99
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,815
<i>There's things
that calm it down.</i>

100
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,649
<i>Gum, weed.</i>

101
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:01,315
<i>Sometimes, something a little
stronger if I'm in bad shape.</i>

102
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,582
<i>But if I try to put
a lid on it, it gets worse.</i>

103
00:04:03,584 --> 00:04:05,449
<i>If I get nervous,
it gets worse.</i>

104
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:07,249
<i>If I get excited,
it gets worse.</i>

105
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,115
If!

106
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,115
<i>It's the argument I can't win.</i>

107
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,184
Hey!

108
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,315
Another Minna classic.

109
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:16,282
Freezin' our asses off.
Don't even know the score.

110
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:18,781
- What, you have big plans this weekend, Coney?
- Yeah, maybe.

111
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:21,249
- Hot date?
- Maybe. Maybe I do.

112
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,716
Coney Island!

113
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:24,315
Coney Island hot dogs!

114
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,082
Coney Island hot dogs
right here!

115
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:28,616
All right, Freakshow,
just a little quieter, please.

116
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,182
[siren blaring in distance]

117
00:04:30,184 --> 00:04:31,848
[ticking]

118
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,351
That's it. We're on.
Be ready.

119
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,117
[phone ringing]

120
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,716
- [Frank] Hey.
- [Lionel on phone] <i>Hey, boss.</i>

121
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:53,482
Bossy, bossy bitch!

122
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,115
<i>You keeping it together,
Brooklyn?</i>

123
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:57,148
No, no, no. [stammers]
I got my gum.

124
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,881
I'll keep it under control
when it counts.

125
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:01,082
Like we said,
stay tuned in, pal.

126
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:02,649
I might need
that head of yours later.

127
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:04,215
<i>Yeah, I got you covered, boss.</i>

128
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:07,050
- I know you do.
- [horn honks]

129
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:13,781
Hey, I think
your friends are here.

130
00:05:13,783 --> 00:05:15,582
[Frank] <i>All right, how many?</i>

131
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,184
[Lionel] <i>There's two walkin' up
the block, two out the car.</i>

132
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,716
- <i>You see 'em?</i>
- Yeah, I see 'em.

133
00:05:20,718 --> 00:05:24,082
[Lionel] Jesus Christ,
look at the size of that guy.

134
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,415
They got... They got
serious muscle with them.

135
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,515
Is everything cool, boss?

136
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:30,783
Cool as can be.
Just a little chat.

137
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,249
[doorbell buzzing]

138
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,948
[Lionel] <i>"Here lies
Frank Minna. Cool as can be."</i>

139
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,616
- <i>They'll carve that on his fuckin' tombstone.</i>
- [whistles]

140
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:41,748
<i>I don't know if it was
growin' up in Greenpoint</i>

141
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,382
<i>or fightin' the Japanese,</i>

142
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,182
<i>but he was cool under pressure
in a way you can't teach.</i>

143
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:48,349
<i>I was just happy to
have a job on his team.</i>

144
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,815
<i>And if there's one thing my
pain-in-the-ass brain does know how to do,</i>

145
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:53,251
<i>it's listen
and remember things.</i>

146
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:01,148
[Frank] Gentlemen,
thanks for coming. Drink?

147
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,716
[Lou] We're not gonna
be here that long.

148
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:04,082
Now explain this crap.

149
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:05,549
[Frank] Which part
didn't you understand?

150
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:07,781
[Lou] <i>How about the part
where you got the idea</i>

151
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,349
<i>to go poking around after some
colored broad, for starters?</i>

152
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,781
[Frank]
<i>She works for the committee.</i>

153
00:06:10,783 --> 00:06:12,048
[Lou]
She's a fuckin' secretary.

154
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,449
We told you
to dig in on Horowitz,

155
00:06:13,451 --> 00:06:14,781
find something
we can shut them down with.

156
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,182
There's nothing there, Lou.

157
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:18,382
<i>You wanna know what's goin' on
in that report,</i>

158
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:20,781
<i>that "colored broad" is doing most
of the legwork on Hamilton for 'em.</i>

159
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:22,848
So I put some time
into that, too.

160
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,349
[Lieberman] You looked in
some funny places.

161
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,015
What can I tell ya?
I'm a snoop. It's what I do.

162
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,148
It's called being thorough.

163
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,349
[Lou] It's called
wasting our time.

164
00:06:29,351 --> 00:06:30,948
This is fucking Chinese,
Frank!

165
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,415
If you need a roadmap
to wipe your ass,

166
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:33,549
I can't help you, Lou.

167
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,948
[Lieberman] Walk us through it,
Mr. Minna,

168
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,549
just to be sure
we're very clear.

169
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:38,048
It's right there in ink.

170
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,517
- [siren blaring]
- [horn honks]

171
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,082
[Frank] <i>Anybody else like to
offer a different interpretation?</i>

172
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:53,582
[Lieberman] <i>None of this
can be proved.</i>

173
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,015
[Frank] <i>That signature
is the real deal.</i>

174
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,415
[Lieberman]
If you knew the man,

175
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,982
you'd know why that seems
highly implausible.

176
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:58,915
[Frank] I checked it
against the others.

177
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,382
That is his John Hancock.

178
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:01,982
And the paper trail
backs it up.

179
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:02,848
[Lieberman] Think Horowitz
knows all of this?

180
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,148
[Frank] No.

181
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,682
<i>Or you'd already
be eating shit.</i>

182
00:07:05,684 --> 00:07:07,482
<i>It'd have been in the paper
the next day.</i>

183
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:09,215
[Lieberman] <i>The girl,
she married? Got family?</i>

184
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,649
[Frank] <i>It's all in my file.</i>

185
00:07:10,651 --> 00:07:12,382
<i>Her mother's dead.
No brother or sisters.</i>

186
00:07:12,384 --> 00:07:14,582
- What about her father?
- Father's a busted-up vet.

187
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,415
He runs a jazz club up here.
He drinks too much.

188
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,315
[Lieberman] <i>Mr. Minna,
I'll assume</i>

189
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:21,815
<i>you're aware of what occurs
a week from Thursday?</i>

190
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,082
[Frank] <i>I am.</i>

191
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:24,482
[Lieberman] So then,
you understand

192
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:25,881
our firm determination
to keep such information

193
00:07:25,883 --> 00:07:27,415
out of the hands
of our detractors?

194
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,015
[Frank] <i>Sure,
it's the nature of the game.</i>

195
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,515
[Lieberman]
<i>But these are all photos.</i>

196
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,249
May I hope you're in
possession of the originals?

197
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:34,082
- [Frank] I am.
- [Lieberman] Excellent.

198
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:35,781
Well, we'll need to
get those from you.

199
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:37,117
I figured as much.

200
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,140
I thought we could
talk about terms.

201
00:08:09,142 --> 00:08:11,075
[Lou] What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

202
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:13,940
Have you lost your mind?

203
00:08:13,942 --> 00:08:15,773
[Frank] Let's not kid
each other, fellas.

204
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:18,040
You got the biggest gravy train
of the century pulling out.

205
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,107
I'm just asking for a seat
here in the rear.

206
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:21,440
[Lieberman]
That's quite impossible.

207
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:23,476
I'd double this
at any paper in town.

208
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:27,107
[Lou] I'm gonna pretend
you didn't say

209
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:28,440
what you just said,
and we're gonna get...

210
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:29,674
[Frank]
<i>It's just an observation.</i>

211
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,173
<i>I'm here in good faith.</i>

212
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,507
- <i>Just assessing value...</i>
- [Lou] <i>You can forget it!</i>

213
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,140
Jeez, Lou.

214
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:36,207
What is your beef with a guy
gettin' paid for good work?

215
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,707
As far as I can see,
you get paid

216
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,507
- for doin' nothing.
- [groans]

217
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:40,906
- [Giant Man] <i>Watch your mouth.</i>
- [Frank] <i>Jesus, take it easy.</i>

218
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:42,107
- Shit.
- [Lou] <i>Open up your coat.</i>

219
00:08:42,109 --> 00:08:43,574
- What?
- Are you carryin'?

220
00:08:43,576 --> 00:08:45,207
- You bring a gun to a meeting?
- [Frank] I had it

221
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:46,607
- since the war, Lou...
- [Lou] What the fuck?

222
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,140
Listen, motherfucker,
I'm gonna have my friend

223
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:49,507
<i>shove that right up your ass.</i>

224
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:50,741
[Lieberman] <i>Enough.
Lou, a word.</i>

225
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:53,173
[indistinct conversation]

226
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:56,040
[Frank] Oh, come on, fellas,
don't get in a twist.

227
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:57,340
It's just business.

228
00:08:57,342 --> 00:08:58,674
[Lieberman] Mr. Minna,
we do appreciate

229
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:00,107
the service you've rendered.

230
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,374
And these gentlemen

231
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:02,741
will take you
to get the originals

232
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,240
and if all is in order,

233
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,207
we'll arrange an appropriate
resolution for you.

234
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:09,173
[Frank] <i>Of course.
Like I say, good faith.</i>

235
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:11,209
<i>Just let me use the can first.</i>

236
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,442
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on!

237
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:18,207
Shithead hitter!

238
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,741
- Hit him in the shitter!
- What happened?

239
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,440
They hit him. They hit him.
I think that they hit him.

240
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:22,873
Well, Jesus, Freakshow,
what are we doing here?

241
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,407
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

242
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:26,007
He said, "Use the can."
He wants us to follow him.

243
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:28,542
Can the man!
Can the loose man!

244
00:09:33,609 --> 00:09:35,376
And this fucking guy.

245
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,741
- I don't like it.
- Me, neither. Let's go.

246
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:40,840
[horn blares]

247
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,209
[Coney] Shit!

248
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,173
[quietly] No, no. No.

249
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,540
Shit. We gotta go,
we gotta go!

250
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:56,440
Come on, come on, come on!

251
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,140
Go, go, go! Fire it up!

252
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,342
Fire it up, come on!

253
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:02,374
[Coney] This fucking guy!

254
00:10:02,376 --> 00:10:04,641
Eat me, Mr. Dickey Weed!

255
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,775
Eat me, Mr. Dickey Weed!

256
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,107
Come on.

257
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,908
Left, left, left.
Lick me, Loose Lucy!

258
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:21,674
There, there, there.
That's them. That's them.

259
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:23,540
Don't blow past them,
don't blow past them.

260
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,109
Slow down, slow down.

261
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:29,507
- Watch out! Watch out!
- [brakes screeching]

262
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:30,875
[Coney] Shit!

263
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:34,940
[taxi driver]
You fuckin' blind?

264
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:36,309
[horn blares]

265
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:41,009
[horn blaring]

266
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:49,707
- The fuck?
- How'd we lose them?

267
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:51,940
There, there! There!

268
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,873
- [both grunt]
- [tires screeching]

269
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,242
[Coney grunts]

270
00:10:57,975 --> 00:10:59,374
[Coney] Where's he goin'?

271
00:10:59,376 --> 00:11:01,140
The ramp, he's goin'
to Queens. Queenie Coney.

272
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:04,307
Queenie Coney. Queenie Coney.

273
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,474
In the right lane.
Get to the right.

274
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:07,775
Where the fuck are they?

275
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,207
Son of a bitch, that's them!

276
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,542
Come on,
we're gonna lose them.

277
00:11:18,142 --> 00:11:19,173
Come on!

278
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,607
- Quacker, quoter, quarter!
- What?

279
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:21,906
Quacker, quoter, quarter!

280
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:23,140
- What?
- Quarter! You need a quarter!

281
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:24,240
Get a fuckin' quarter out,
Coney!

282
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:25,509
Why didn't you say something?

283
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:28,842
Go, go, go! Go, go!

284
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,442
There, there, there.
Go left, go left.

285
00:11:46,743 --> 00:11:48,073
They gotta be somewhere.

286
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:51,276
I'd say they're somewhere,
Gil, yes. Where?

287
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:00,374
- [gunshot]
- Stop, go back! Go back!

288
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:01,376
Jesus!

289
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:12,140
Shit! Drop it!
We gotta get out of here!

290
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:14,107
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

291
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,309
[Coney] God damn it.

292
00:12:18,743 --> 00:12:19,942
Frank!

293
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:21,542
Pull it up!

294
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:24,875
[groans]

295
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:27,474
You wanna
help me out here, please?

296
00:12:27,476 --> 00:12:30,140
- [Lionel] Yeah.
- [Coney] Oh, shit!

297
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:32,509
- Can you stand?
- Yeah. [groaning]

298
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,940
[Frank] Coney, you lug wrench,
get my hat!

299
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,040
Forget the hat, Frank.

300
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,509
Get my hat, you fucking mook.

301
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:44,075
Get my gun, too.

302
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,574
[Lionel] Where the hell
are you going?

303
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,107
I don't know around here.

304
00:12:52,109 --> 00:12:53,274
- Give me something.
- Well, head for the hospital.

305
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,906
Jesus!
Hospitable herpetologist!

306
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,073
[groaning] Mercy Hospital.

307
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,040
Up McGuinness,
you cabbageheads!

308
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,840
[Frank grunts]

309
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,540
- Ah, sorry.
- Pay attention!

310
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,140
- If, if!
- Easy, pal.

311
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:04,474
- [groans]
- [Lionel] Sorry. Sorry.

312
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:06,440
Put my watch and my wallet
in my hat

313
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,440
and leave it in the car.

314
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:08,574
Don't want anybody
stealin' it.

315
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:10,274
The fuck happened, Frank?

316
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:11,873
I took 'em on a wild goose
chase and I tried to slip 'em.

317
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,173
Ah, we should have
jumped in sooner.

318
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,574
I thought
you were signaling me off.

319
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,540
[Frank] No, not your fault.
I almost made it.

320
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,973
I forgot they had my gun.

321
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:20,474
Got through Guadalcanal
without a scratch,

322
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:23,340
and I get shot with my own gun
in Queens.

323
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:25,073
- [Coney] You gonna be okay?
- [Frank] Yeah, yeah.

324
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:26,574
They clipped me in the side,
but nothin' important.

325
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:28,873
- Who? Who were they?
- Well, don't worry about it.

326
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,274
Talk to me, Brooklyn.

327
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,873
- I need one of your jokes.
- [Lionel] What?

328
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,806
[Frank] I need a joke.
Just tell me a joke.

329
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:34,107
Guy walks into a bar.

330
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,806
Guy walks into a bar
with an octopus

331
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:37,173
and he says,
"I'll bet 50 this octopus

332
00:13:37,175 --> 00:13:38,173
can play any instrument
in the joint."

333
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,407
Funny. Already in the black.

334
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm gonna fucking...
Fuck! Shit!

335
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:43,007
Don't blow the punchline,
Lionel.

336
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,773
- [horn blaring]
- Watch out! Watch out!

337
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,140
[screams]

338
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:47,741
[groans] Jesus,
what are we doing here?

339
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,009
[Coney] Almost there.

340
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,607
What do you think you're
doing? Get this car out of...

341
00:13:56,609 --> 00:13:59,376
We're an ambulance today, pal.
Get someone!

342
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:05,574
[doctor] What do we got?

343
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,242
[nurse] Gunshot in the back.
Went out through the stomach.

344
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:13,307
Hey, hey. Okay,
they're gonna fix you up.

345
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:14,274
[groaning]

346
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,307
Squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.

347
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:17,374
[doctor] Clamp.

348
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,973
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

349
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:21,307
Oh, shit, Brooklyn,
she's in trouble now.

350
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:22,873
Who? Who was that
in that room, boss?

351
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,340
Played out of my league.

352
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:26,240
I should have kept her
under my... [screaming]

353
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,507
Easy, easy. They're gonna give
you something now, right?

354
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:29,574
[doctor] Hand me two units.

355
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,107
[nurse] Morphine in.

356
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:33,707
- Hey, Brooklyn...
- Yeah, I'm here, Frank.

357
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:35,942
You're no freak.

358
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,173
Yeah, okay.

359
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,641
Stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

360
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,175
You were working for
those guys. Who were they?

361
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,173
For... Formosa...

362
00:14:46,175 --> 00:14:47,542
Formosa? What is that?

363
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:51,540
Formosa...

364
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,140
- [nurse] I don't have a pulse.
- [doctor] Move!

365
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,674
- [nurse] You can't be here.
- [doctor] Get out!

366
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:57,509
[nurse] Get out.
Get out! Get out!

367
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:00,875
[high-pitched ringing]

368
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:09,173
[Lionel]
<i>A guy walks into a bar...</i>

369
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,140
A guy walks into a bar...

370
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,507
A guy walks into a bar...

371
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:15,374
- A guy walks into a bar...
- We did the best we could.

372
00:15:15,376 --> 00:15:16,973
- A guy walks into a bar...
- He lost too much...

373
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,107
Too much blood.

374
00:15:18,109 --> 00:15:19,973
- He didn't make it.
- [exhales]

375
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:22,773
- I am so sorry.
- So sorry, Bailey!

376
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:24,442
So sorry, Bailey!

377
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,507
Frankly Frankady Franko!

378
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:31,674
Frankly Frankady Franko!

379
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,741
Frankly Frankady Franko!

380
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:35,476
Frankly Frankady Franko!

381
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,775
Frankly Frankady Franko!

382
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:42,906
[Lionel] Then he said
he would take 'em

383
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,507
to get this thing
and that was our signal.

384
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:45,973
So, he's takin' them to get
somethin' that they want,

385
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:47,040
and they off him.
That doesn't track.

386
00:15:47,042 --> 00:15:48,641
No, I don't know. [stammers]

387
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:50,607
It all happened so fast.
And we were just catchin' up.

388
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:51,940
We barely saw 'em.

389
00:15:51,942 --> 00:15:53,607
How the fuck did you drop
so far off them?

390
00:15:53,609 --> 00:15:55,741
I told you, we lost them at
the bridge. They had a badge.

391
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,440
They got waved through.
There was nothin' we could do.

392
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,773
Freakshow's right.
It was a mess.

393
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,207
So, who were they?

394
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:03,440
He wouldn't say.
Even after, in the car.

395
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:05,276
That's great, Frank!

396
00:16:07,376 --> 00:16:09,276
If, if, if!

397
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,374
We gotta tell Julia.

398
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:15,707
I told her already.

399
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,140
When?

400
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,773
She called looking for him.

401
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,107
How'd she take it?
Timbuk-take it!

402
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,040
How the fuck you think
she took it, Freakshow?

403
00:16:24,042 --> 00:16:25,840
Hey! Don't say that again!

404
00:16:25,842 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm not in the fuckin' mood.

405
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:28,842
Yeah, all right, take it easy.

406
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,209
I'm just sayin'...

407
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,542
We all know how she can be.

408
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:39,075
Somebody's gotta
take her his things.

409
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:45,009
I'll do it.

410
00:16:58,242 --> 00:16:59,276
Hey.

411
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,274
Take his, huh?

412
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,509
You can't go out
lookin' like that.

413
00:17:07,676 --> 00:17:09,109
It's freezin'.

414
00:17:11,643 --> 00:17:14,474
- Thank you.
- [Danny] You sure you wanna do this?

415
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:17,342
Maybe she'll wanna know what
happened at the end, you know?

416
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,309
He say anything about her?

417
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,142
No.

418
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:31,209
Help him out one last time.

419
00:17:31,942 --> 00:17:33,476
Lie a little.

420
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,040
- Oh. Lionel.
- Hey, Julia, I...

421
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,674
Yeah, don't bother.
The hospital already called.

422
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:50,376
No, I got some of Frank's
things that I brought.

423
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,340
Oh.

424
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:54,175
I thought you were gonna
break the news to me again.

425
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,240
Jeez, Julia, I'm...

426
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:02,207
- I'm really sorry.
- Nice twist, huh?

427
00:18:02,209 --> 00:18:05,741
Didn't see that one coming,
I gotta say.

428
00:18:05,743 --> 00:18:08,240
Twisty, twitchy, twinky!
[sighs] Shit.

429
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:10,574
Look, I just want to be alone,
okay?

430
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:13,140
Sure, sure. Yeah.

431
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,274
You can give me that watch,
I guess.

432
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:16,873
I don't want
the rest of that stuff.

433
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm gonna keep his gun,
if that's okay.

434
00:18:18,842 --> 00:18:20,942
- You want the hat?
- For what?

435
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,142
You should have that.

436
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,607
Was somebody with him
when he...

437
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,109
Yeah, I was.

438
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,274
Uh...

439
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:46,173
[stammering] He was talkin'
about you, you know?

440
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:49,340
Yeah, don't bullshit me, okay?
I'm pissed at him.

441
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:51,806
- No, don't be.
- Okay, well, I am.

442
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:53,075
Pissing bitch!

443
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,075
[quietly] I'm sorry.

444
00:18:55,576 --> 00:18:57,274
Julia...

445
00:18:57,276 --> 00:19:00,007
did Frank say anything about
who he was meeting today,

446
00:19:00,009 --> 00:19:01,407
or what he was into?

447
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:02,806
No, he didn't. No.

448
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,906
- You got no idea who did this?
- No.

449
00:19:04,908 --> 00:19:07,507
If I figure it out, I'm gonna
make 'em regret it, though.

450
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:08,873
I promise you that.

451
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,407
Don't promise me.

452
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:12,908
It makes no difference
to me one way or the other.

453
00:19:28,442 --> 00:19:29,442
If!

454
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,142
If!

455
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,142
[clatters]

456
00:19:56,409 --> 00:19:57,775
[crying]

457
00:20:07,676 --> 00:20:08,875
If!

458
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:13,908
If!

459
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,075
If!

460
00:20:24,676 --> 00:20:26,209
- If!
- [cat meows]

461
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:32,142
If!

462
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:50,875
[switch clicks]

463
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:41,042
[thunder rumbling]

464
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:48,376
Here you go, sir.

465
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:05,240
[Moses] Let 'em in, Charlie.

466
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:06,842
All right, gentlemen.
Come on in.

467
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,307
Watch your step. It might
be a little bit slippery.

468
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,707
[Mayor] <i>I humbly accept the
responsibility of the office of mayor,</i>

469
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:18,574
<i>and I accept the challenge of
serving the people of New York City</i>

470
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:20,873
<i>faithfully and well.</i>

471
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,641
Limited only
by our own vision,

472
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:25,140
our own audacity,

473
00:22:25,142 --> 00:22:28,140
we will build the legacy
of our time.

474
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:31,307
A legacy for future
generations to look upon

475
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:33,540
and say, "Here was boldness.

476
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:38,240
Here is the greatest
of what man can create."

477
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:39,773
[applause]

478
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,607
God bless you. Thank you.

479
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:46,540
Thank you, my fellow
New Yorkers! Thank you!

480
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,973
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

481
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:50,607
and uphold the integrity
of the office

482
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:53,374
of Deputy Mayor
of Community Relations?

483
00:22:53,376 --> 00:22:54,440
I do.

484
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:56,242
[applause]

485
00:23:00,908 --> 00:23:03,307
Ah. Mo. Splendid.

486
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,906
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

487
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:07,274
and uphold the integrity
of the office

488

489
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:09,908
I do.

490
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:14,307
Do you solemnly swear to serve
the people of New York

491
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,274
and uphold the integrity

492

of Commissioner
of Building and Construction?

493
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,507
I do.

494
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:22,574
Good to have you aboard, Mo.
Keep up the good work.

495
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:24,109
[applause]

496
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:27,806
Well, I'll be damned,
he did it.

497
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:29,173
I told you.

498
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:31,007
He's no pushover, this one.

499
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,307
[Mayor] Ladies and gentlemen,

500
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:34,309
your New York City
commissioner.

501
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:38,842
10 bucks
it won't last past noon.

502
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,407
[man chuckles]

503
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:43,540
- Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
- [reporters clamoring]

504
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:44,842
This way.

505
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:49,309
[laughter]

506
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:52,240
[Mayor] And after all that,

507
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,540
he voted for the wrong guy
in three different precincts.

508
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,507
[laughter]

509
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:58,073
[Moses] What is this shit?

510
00:23:58,075 --> 00:24:00,173
What about City Planning?

511
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:02,107
See here now, Mo.
What is all this?

512
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,707
Don't you play games
with me, you fuckin' mutt.

513
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,274
Either I get City Planning
or I quit the other two.

514
00:24:06,276 --> 00:24:07,307
Right now!

515
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:09,140
The reporters are still here.

516
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:11,940
Easy now, it's nothing
to get hot about.

517
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:14,207
It's probably
just an oversight.

518
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,806
They forgot to
give me the blank.

519
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,741
Just give us a day
to get settled in,

520
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:19,009
and I'll see to it.

521
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,175
Now sign it.

522
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:47,842
Now give me.

523
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:54,641
Right.

524
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:56,975
Bunch of fuckin' amateurs.

525
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:02,374

What the hell happened here?

541
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,840
Danny had
an early run out to Belmont,

542
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,073
came in, it was like this.

543
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,906
Cops were at Frank's place,
too,

544
00:25:43,908 --> 00:25:45,340
- going through everything.
- If!

545
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:46,707
They were going through
my underwear drawer

546
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,240
and they were grinnin' at me

547
00:25:48,242 --> 00:25:49,507
while they were going through
my underwear drawer.

548
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:50,973
We're gonna find out
who did this,

549
00:25:50,975 --> 00:25:51,940
get to the bottom of it.
Right, boys?

550
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:53,007
I don't even want to know.

551
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,674
Always with this cryptic shit,

552
00:25:54,676 --> 00:25:57,207
telling me he's into
something big this time

553
00:25:57,209 --> 00:26:00,240
and that he's gonna
change our situation,

554
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,540
and then he goes
and gets whacked,

555
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:06,107
and leaves me $4,000
in a savings and loan,

556
00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:09,806
and a drafty shithole
at Lookout Point,

557
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:12,973
and this thriving operation!

558
00:26:12,975 --> 00:26:15,409
The fuck am I supposed to do
with this?

559
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,276
[exhales]

560
00:26:19,175 --> 00:26:20,040
[sighs]

561
00:26:20,042 --> 00:26:22,607
Look, the way I see it,

562
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:25,073
you guys work for me now.

563
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,540
I know you all go way back
with him, longer than me,

564
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,507
but that's just the way
it is for now.

565
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:31,607
I know the car service
was mainly for the books,

566
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:35,873
but we didn't talk much about
how he ran the snoop work.

567
00:26:35,875 --> 00:26:37,873
And I ain't interested.

568
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,007
So, I'm puttin'
Tony in charge.

569
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:42,906
He's gonna run
the business of it,

570
00:26:42,908 --> 00:26:44,773
and then he'll keep me
in the loop. Right?

571
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:47,540
Sure, doll.
It's the right thing.

572
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,107
Sure.

573
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,940
You want me to walk you home?

574
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,707
No, thanks.

575
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:55,940
I'm gonna go stay with
my sister for a little bit.

576
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:58,440
I have to go figure out
my future.

577
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,942
But give me a call. Okay?

578
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:03,409
You know, for an update?

579
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,773
- Hey, Julia.
- Hey, Lionel.

580
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:11,107
Can't you ever cut that out?

581
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,240
Touch it, Bailey!
I'm sorry.

582
00:27:13,242 --> 00:27:14,440
For once?

583
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:15,374
If!

584
00:27:15,376 --> 00:27:17,442
- [stammers] I'm...
- Jesus.

585
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:21,175
[Lionel] What?

586
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,307
[Lionel sighs]

587
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,908
Fuckin' assholes even took
the tank off the john.

588
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,340
All right, forget that,
do it later.

589
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:32,374
Right now,
just the four of us...

590
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:34,340
Does anybody know
what Frank was into on this?

591
00:27:34,342 --> 00:27:36,073
He just said to meet him
for a sit.

592
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:37,741
He didn't even make it
like it was a big thing.

593
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:38,906
- He was nervous, though.
- Nervous how?

594
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,140
He wasn't nervous.

595
00:27:40,142 --> 00:27:41,574
Were you on that line,
dumb shit?

596
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,707
I'm telling you, I heard it,
he was nervous.

597
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,407
Nervous Nellie!

598
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:45,607
It was in his voice.

599
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:47,641
He was trying to make a play
on those guys.

600
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:49,374
There's somethin' goin' down a
week from Thursday that's big.

601
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,107
And they were not happy
about what he found.

602
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,773
Obviously.
They whacked him for it.

603
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:54,374
Crack whacker! No,

604
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,340
I don't think they meant to.
I think it was a mistake.

605
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,173
When they shot him,
I think they fucked up,

606
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,007
now they're stuck
looking for what he found.

607
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:02,042
[Tony] Big fuckin' riddle.
Jesus H.

608
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:04,542
All right, I'm gonna say this.

609
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,073
I loved the guy.

610
00:28:08,075 --> 00:28:09,940
And when we were
in that fuckin' hellhole,

611
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:11,274
he saw somethin' in us,

612
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,207
threw us a line,
taught us how to operate,

613
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,707
but he never cut us in
all the way.

614
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,307
And he played his own games.

615
00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:18,207
And I'm not stickin' my nose
around his dead cards,

616
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:20,476
risk ending up
on a slab for it.

617
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,906
I say we got
a lot of bills to pay,

618
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:26,707
and we ought to
just get at it.

619
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:28,073
You owe him
more than that, T.

620
00:28:28,075 --> 00:28:29,707
Yeah, well, you figure out
what the fuck

621
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,641
it was all about,
you let us know.

622
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:35,040
All right? Meantime, I gotta
finish up on the rabbi's wife.

623
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,707
She's banging a butcher
who ain't kosher

624
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:38,407
and I think he's really gonna
give her the boot this time,

625
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,307
and that's gonna be
the last of that ride.

626
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,073
I want Gil sitting on
that Gunderson fraud thing.

627
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:45,474
- I'm on Gunderson.
- Yeah, well, I want Gil on it!

628
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:46,707
- Why?
- Because

629
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:48,274
when we make that bust,

630
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,940
the insurance company's gonna
want us to go down there,

631
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:51,173
show the pictures
to his lawyer,

632
00:28:51,175 --> 00:28:52,607
and I wanna make
a good impression.

633
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:53,940
Okay? Frank ain't here
to cover for you anymore.

634
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:55,340
- Fraud fag!
- Like I said,

635
00:28:55,342 --> 00:28:57,240
Gil's on it.
Danny will back me on nights,

636
00:28:57,242 --> 00:28:59,240
and, Lionel, you pick up
the car slack for him,

637
00:28:59,242 --> 00:29:01,075
just until something new
comes in.

638
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,806
It's cold. We're gonna have
a lot of calls,

639
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,840
and we need that business.
Fuck!

640
00:29:05,842 --> 00:29:07,775

- [Danny] Lionel?
- If!

684
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,873
Oh, Jesus Christ!

685
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:21,274
You scared the hell out of me.

686
00:31:21,276 --> 00:31:22,674
I thought
I was lookin' at a ghost.

687
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:25,040
- What are you doin'?
- Spinnin'.

688
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,140
- You back already?
- Nah, I'm on a round trip.

689
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:28,842
I gotta go back soon.

690
00:31:29,342 --> 00:31:31,007
You okay?

691
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:33,973
I should have never let him
get in that car.

692
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,540
I think I blew it, Danny.

693
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:38,240
I had a sergeant once
in the Bulge. Told me,

694
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:40,374
"Sometimes you do everything
you're supposed to,

695
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:43,075
and it all still goes
to shit." Hmm?

696
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:45,540
It ain't on you, bud.

697
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,908
Thanks, D.

698
00:31:47,476 --> 00:31:48,509
Any calls?

699
00:31:49,442 --> 00:31:50,808
Yeah. Oh, shit!

700
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:53,540
I gotta go.

701
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:54,875
I got a 2:30.

702
00:31:56,242 --> 00:31:57,707
Hey...

703
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,440
did you ever hear Frank mention
anything about "Formosa"?

704
00:32:00,442 --> 00:32:01,607
Like the Jap island?

705
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,942
Nah. He was wounded
and out before then.

706
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:06,040
Hmm.

707
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:09,007
There is that joint, Formosa,
in, uh, Midtown.

708
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:11,542
I took Linda there
to see Chet Baker once.

709
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:15,973
[Lionel] <i>Frank didn't have
to cover for me.</i>

710
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,940
<i>He just never put me
into situations</i>

711
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,773
<i>that were gonna
punch my buttons.</i>

712
00:32:19,775 --> 00:32:22,540
<i>Talkin' to people, gettin'
information out of 'em,</i>

713
00:32:22,542 --> 00:32:24,274
<i>that's the bread and butter
of the trade,</i>

714
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,107
<i>but never my strong suit.</i>

715
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,674
<i>Especially if a girl shows up
in the mix</i>

716
00:32:28,676 --> 00:32:31,274
<i>and, in this line of work,
they usually do.</i>

717
00:32:31,276 --> 00:32:32,641
[bartender] Music's at 7:00.

718
00:32:32,643 --> 00:32:35,040
Yeah, could I get
an early one? Whiskey, neat?

719
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,040
- Irish?
- Sure.

720
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,474
Say, are you in here regular?

721
00:32:39,476 --> 00:32:41,040
Most of my life.

722
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,007
You ever seen this guy
come in?

723
00:32:43,009 --> 00:32:44,973
Name's Frank Minna.

724
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:46,207
Seen him around?

725
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:48,773
Everybody looks like
everybody to me,

726
00:32:48,775 --> 00:32:50,574
but I don't think so.

727
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:51,942
She's good with faces.

728
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:54,574
Seen that guy?

729
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,075
- Friend of yours?
- Yeah.

730
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,309
- Nice face.
- If!

731
00:33:00,942 --> 00:33:02,342
Nice yourself.

732
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:04,542
You got a light?

733
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:07,875
[Lionel clears throat]

734
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:14,175
A tease. [chuckles]

735
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:18,109
Sorry.

736
00:33:21,975 --> 00:33:25,007
Jesus. Forget I asked.

737
00:33:25,009 --> 00:33:28,340
- Ass-talk, Bailey!
- [woman] Classy!

738
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,906
You got somethin'
against blondes?

739
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,209
It's gotta sound right
or I can't stop doing it.

740
00:33:34,908 --> 00:33:36,806
Must be inconvenient.

741
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,240
Buddy, you don't know
the half of it.

742
00:33:40,242 --> 00:33:42,474
That uptown shit's
the real deal, huh?

743
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:44,173
You get up there much?

744
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:45,674
- Sorry?
- King Rooster.

745
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:48,207
- [Lionel] I don't know it.
- Jazz joint in Harlem.

746
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:49,741
Lucky's is a good time, too,

747
00:33:49,743 --> 00:33:51,009
but all the guys playing hard
are at the Rooster.

748
00:33:53,975 --> 00:33:55,276
Thanks a lot.

749
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:13,142
[indistinct chatter]

750
00:34:14,576 --> 00:34:15,973
[bartender] We ain't open yet.

751
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:17,908
Yeah, could I get
an early one? I'm freezin'.

752
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:22,342
I'll take a whiskey, neat.
Keep it.

753
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,073
Hey, you the manager?

754
00:34:26,075 --> 00:34:28,376
- I look like the manager?
- [chuckles]

755
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,307
Who's playin' tonight?

756
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:32,873
Hey, Billy, who's on tonight?

757
00:34:32,875 --> 00:34:34,440
Mr. Bigshot.

758
00:34:34,442 --> 00:34:36,107
[bartender] I hope they don't
think they drinkin' free.

759
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,906
[Billy] Well, you know they do.

760
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,840
[bartender] You know who's
gonna say somethin' about that.

761
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,042
You caught this cat?

762
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:43,574
I seen cool.

763
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:45,407
This brother rewritin' cool.

764
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:47,840
- I'll catch him next time.
- [bartender] Don't wait long.

765
00:34:47,842 --> 00:34:49,806
These French girls
keep lovin' him up,

766
00:34:49,808 --> 00:34:51,040
he's gonna move over there
for good.

767
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:52,842
French kissin' cats!

768
00:34:53,376 --> 00:34:54,442
Thanks, pal.

769
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,908
[soft jazz playing on record]

770
00:35:02,042 --> 00:35:03,641
[Lionel]
<i>On my average day,</i>

771
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,173
<i>the weed will handle
my twitching and shouting,</i>

772
00:35:05,175 --> 00:35:07,040
<i>let me get to sleep.</i>

773
00:35:07,042 --> 00:35:10,574
<i>But it makes
my thinking fuzzy.</i>

774
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:14,309
<i>In my dreams, I'm calm and clear
like I was when I was a kid.</i>

775
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:18,207
<i>Even after my head
started messin' with me,</i>

776
00:35:18,209 --> 00:35:20,407
<i>my mother
could settle it down.</i>

777
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,040
<i>She'd sing soft songs,</i>

778
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:23,574
<i>stroke the back of my neck,</i>

779
00:35:23,576 --> 00:35:26,007
<i>and it would leave me
for a while.</i>

780
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:27,574
<i>We'd lie on the bed,</i>

781
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,975
<i>talk about all the places
we were gonna go.</i>

782
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:52,142
[Frank] That "colored broad" is doing
most of the legwork on Hamilton for 'em.

783
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:58,773
Christ, Coney,
did you get the shot or not?

784
00:35:58,775 --> 00:36:00,674
What? Doing what?

785
00:36:00,676 --> 00:36:03,307
Gettin' the... Gettin'
the paper ain't worth shit.

786
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:05,073
The fuck's got to do
with his back?

787
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:06,540
"Bendin' over," my ass.

788
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,340
Look, I need him
liftin' the lawnmower

789
00:36:08,342 --> 00:36:10,040
out of the car
or playin' tennis,

790
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,507
or spinnin' around the room
with some broad

791
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:14,407
up on his tent pole
and his arms out wide.

792
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,942
I don't give a shit as long as
it involves his back.

793
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:18,973
Yeah.

794
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:20,274
I know he's fakin' it, Gil.

795
00:36:20,276 --> 00:36:22,240
That's why he's won
three claims.

796
00:36:22,242 --> 00:36:25,107
Look, just wait him out
or set him up.

797
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,274
I know it's cold. That's why
they call it winter!

798
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:30,173
Fuck. [sighs]

799
00:36:30,175 --> 00:36:31,641
I'm givin' him
till the end of the week.

800
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:34,207
Hell, the guy could
lift a cow into a truck...

801
00:36:34,209 --> 00:36:36,040
Coney's still gonna
miss the shot.

802
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,707
He still can't remember
to wind the film.

803
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:39,240
He thinks it's a Tommy gun.

804
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:42,007
I keep tellin' him, "Click,
advance. Click, advance."

805
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:43,773
Can it! I'm givin' him
the rest of the week.

806
00:36:43,775 --> 00:36:45,173
[phone ringing]

807
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:47,940
Give me a fuckin' break, Gil.
What?

808
00:36:47,942 --> 00:36:50,007
Oh. Yeah, no, excuse me.
L&L.

809
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:51,741
- We gettin' any rides?
- [Danny] No.

810
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:54,840
Nobody ever needs a ride on
Tuesday, you ever notice that?

811
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:56,474
Never. What is that about?

812
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:58,040
Tits on a Tuesday!

813
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,209
[Tony] Okay, thank you.

814
00:36:59,808 --> 00:37:00,873
Job?

815
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,440
For me.

816
00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:04,040
[Danny] Well, don't go gettin'
all mysterious now, T.

817
00:37:04,042 --> 00:37:05,942
You ain't no Minna.

818
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:08,040
Yet.

819
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:10,107
I'm going to pick up a prescription
for my mother, clam brain.

820
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:11,674
You want all the details?

821
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:13,040
- [exclaims]
- All right.

822
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,773
I'm goin' out for coffee.
You want?

823
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:15,873
[Danny] Yeah, cream and sugar.

824
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:17,607
Oh!

825
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:19,307
Okay.

826
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:21,873
- [door closes]
- Meet the new boss.

827
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:23,307
Mmm-hmm.

828
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:25,274
Hey, D, if it's slow,
you up for something?

829
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,342
Like what?

830
00:37:27,676 --> 00:37:31,407
Will you go sit on that place
for me? It's up in Harlem.

831
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:32,440
I don't know it.

832
00:37:32,442 --> 00:37:33,741
I think Frank was there
that day,

833
00:37:33,743 --> 00:37:35,107
or maybe the day before,

834
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:36,906
but it was in his pants,
it was almost full.

835
00:37:36,908 --> 00:37:38,374
- Fullsie pants!
- Yeah, well,

836
00:37:38,376 --> 00:37:39,540
maybe he just stopped in

837
00:37:39,542 --> 00:37:41,207
- for a book of matches.
- I don't think so.

838
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:42,574
He was talkin'
about the colored girl

839
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,107
who found somethin'
they were unhappy about,

840
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:45,641
and he said her father's
a busted-up vet

841
00:37:45,643 --> 00:37:46,707
who runs a joint in Harlem,

842
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,240
and this place is three blocks

843
00:37:48,242 --> 00:37:49,840
from where they had
that meeting.

844
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:52,374
[Danny] Mmm-hmm.
So, you went there?

845
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:53,906
Yeah, and guess
who the manager is?

846
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:55,574
He's a colored guy
with a bum arm.

847
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:58,240
Oh, okay, what do you want me
to do about it?

848
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,773
Just get in there, you know,

849
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:02,040
see if you can get her name
off of them or something.

850
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,474
Use your liquor board bit.
Lick Broader!

851
00:38:04,476 --> 00:38:05,773
I get her name.

852
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:07,307
- That's it?
- No, sit there a while.

853
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:09,040
See if she comes in.
Get her picture or somethin'.

854
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:11,741
See if a colored girl
walks into a jazz joint?

855
00:38:11,743 --> 00:38:13,240
Let me make a prediction.

856
00:38:13,242 --> 00:38:15,107
Hey, asshole, I'm workin' it
from another angle, too.

857
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:17,407
We'll put 'em together.
We'll figure out who she is.

858
00:38:17,409 --> 00:38:20,040
All right. Can I ask
why we're doin' this?

859
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,773
'Cause he'd have
done it for us.

860
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:23,009
You're right.

861
00:38:25,676 --> 00:38:27,641
Ah, it's fuckin' cold
for a sit.

862
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:30,007
No, take the Bel Air.
That heater'll roast you like a brisket.

863
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,073
Bet on the bris!

864
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,574
What are you, a rabbi now?

865
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,507
You don't want me handling
your bris, believe me.

866
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:35,906
[laughing]

867
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,109
[horn honks]

868
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:53,641
[Betty] Can I help you?

869
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:55,340
- Yeah. If!
- Bless you.

870
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,007
Thank you.
I'm here to see Mildred.

871
00:38:57,009 --> 00:38:59,240
Mildred? There's nobody
by that name here.

872
00:38:59,242 --> 00:39:00,906
I'm pretty sure
it was Mildred.

873
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:02,641
- Myrna.
- My mynah bird's Myrna.

874
00:39:02,643 --> 00:39:05,875
No. No, it was a colored girl
that I was speaking to.

875
00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:08,674
Uh... Josephine?

876
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:10,540
Or Laura?

877
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:11,806
- Mary.
- No,

878
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,407
I'm pretty sure
it was Mildred.

879
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:14,674
I was talking to her on
the phone about my application.

880
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:15,840
What's your name?

881
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,607
Betty.
What sort of application?

882
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:20,173
For my vendor's license.

883
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:21,806
Is this not
the licensing office?

884
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:25,007
It's the Committee on Racial
Discrimination in Housing.

885
00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:26,140
Well, then,
you can't very well

886
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:27,507
help me sell hot dogs,
can you?

887
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:29,307
I'm so sorry.

888
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:31,906
Wait. Mr. Horowitz
isn't here today, is he?

889
00:39:31,908 --> 00:39:34,173
- You mean Miss Horowitz?
- Either one.

890
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:36,409
- She's in the back.
- Can you point her out to me?

891
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,175
There she is.

892
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,009
[Lionel] Hmm.

893
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:45,875
You've been more helpful
than you know.

894
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,840
[mutters]

895
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:58,040
[Lou] We told you
to dig in on Horowitz.

896
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,442
Horse a whip!

897
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:01,476
Horse a whip!

898
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,276
[camera shutter clicking]

899
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:43,073
[Tony] Shit, what happened?

900
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:44,140
[Coney] Jesus, Danny.

901
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,806
[Tony] Come on. All right.

902
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:47,109
Come.

903
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:51,274
- [Danny grunts]
- Shit. You need ice?

904
00:40:51,276 --> 00:40:54,207
No, no. I'll take a shot.
You got one of those?

905
00:40:54,209 --> 00:40:55,209
Yeah.

906
00:40:57,209 --> 00:40:59,641
- Yeah, thanks.
- [Tony] Who was it, D?

907
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:00,842
[Danny] Hmm.

908
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,707
There was a couple of 'em.

909
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,040
One was a giant.

910
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,474
- A what?
- [Danny] A fuckin' giant.

911
00:41:07,476 --> 00:41:09,574
I'm tellin' ya,
the biggest guy I ever saw.

912
00:41:09,576 --> 00:41:11,707
Worked me over pretty good.

913
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:13,140
Murdered the camera.

914
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:15,073
- Fuck. Did they say anything?
- [Danny] Yeah.

915
00:41:15,075 --> 00:41:17,073
Uh... "Stay out
of Minna's garbage.

916
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,607
Tell your crew the same."

917
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,574
They had a big nasty knife
to my throat for that part.

918
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:22,707
Those sons of bitches!

919
00:41:22,709 --> 00:41:25,242
But they didn't get this.

920
00:41:26,842 --> 00:41:28,307
- Assholes.
- The fuck is it?

921
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:31,073
Giant-ass dog!
Ah, D, you're the tits.

922
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:32,509
What are you two into?

923
00:41:37,775 --> 00:41:39,042
[door opens]

924
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:45,540
- You get 'em all?
- These are yours,

925
00:41:45,542 --> 00:41:47,242
- these are mine.
- Yeah.

926
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,340
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

927
00:41:49,342 --> 00:41:51,407
- That's the same guy I saw.
- [Danny] Yeah, yeah.

928
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,274
- The bum arm.
- Forget all that, though.

929
00:41:53,276 --> 00:41:55,707
She doesn't show up till
sort of the end of the roll.

930
00:41:55,709 --> 00:41:57,040
Yeah.

931
00:41:57,042 --> 00:41:59,007
- Look, they come out together.
- Yeah.

932
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:00,940
No, wait, but I saw her.
That's, uh...

933
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:03,374
- Laura, they called her Laura.
- Laura Rose?

934
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:05,507
Maybe that's Billy Rose,
if he's her father.

935
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:07,940
She lives on the same corner
as the club.

936
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,207
They must have made me early,

937
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:10,507
as soon as I got out
to check it out,

938
00:42:10,509 --> 00:42:11,674
bam, they were on me.

939
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:13,173
Yeah. That's her.

940
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:16,040
That's the colored girl
that Frank was following.

941
00:42:16,042 --> 00:42:17,773
All right, I'm with you, okay?
It's just,

942
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:19,474
- it's still a little thin.
- Skeletal.

943
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:20,873
Thin? What?

944
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,007
We already ID'd her.
We've been at it one day.

945
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,374
Well, you know,
whatever it is, it's...

946
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,940
It's gotta be big,
they're goin' this far, right?

947
00:42:28,942 --> 00:42:32,240
So, it's gotta be
worth something, then.

948
00:42:32,242 --> 00:42:34,374
I'll tell you what, Freakshow,
Gil and I,

949
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:36,140
we'll stay on the money work,
just to keep us afloat,

950
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:37,641
you and Danny
keep sniffin' this.

951
00:42:37,643 --> 00:42:38,707
Let's see what we get.

952
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:39,873
- Fuck 'em!
- Yeah.

953
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:41,140
- [Tony] Right?
- [Coney] Yeah.

954
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,540
- If!
- I hope these mugs poke around

955
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,007
'cause I got something
for them if they do.

956
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:45,242
What do you say, D?

957
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:47,875
Fellas, I...

958
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:50,641
I loved him, you know.

959
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:52,906
I mean, I'll, uh...

960
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:55,107
I, uh...
I'll handle the car stuff.

961
00:42:55,109 --> 00:42:57,840
I'll work some domestic shit,

962
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:59,240
but I got Linda.

963
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:02,973
No, hey, hey,
that's the right thing.

964
00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:04,374
Get on home,

965
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:06,073
- throw a steak on that eye.
- [Danny] Yeah.

966
00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,109
[Coney] I'll give you a lift.

967
00:43:10,709 --> 00:43:12,908
- So long.
- [Danny] Yeah, yeah.

968
00:43:14,743 --> 00:43:16,140
[door closes]

969
00:43:16,142 --> 00:43:18,540
What do you mean,
it might be worth something?

970
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,507
I don't know, I thought maybe
we'll get something out of it.

971
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:22,207
I ain't looking to make a deal
with these fucks.

972
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:23,773
Forget that, then.
Look, I'm just...

973
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,140
Don't you think I wanna
find out who whacked Frank?

974
00:43:26,142 --> 00:43:27,173
Yeah.

975
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:28,507
Just don't hold out on me,
okay?

976
00:43:28,509 --> 00:43:30,340
We're workin'
on this thing together.

977
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,674
We find who did this,
and we square accounts.

978
00:43:33,676 --> 00:43:35,109
If you say so, yeah.

979
00:43:36,442 --> 00:43:37,940
Wanna get a beer?

980
00:43:37,942 --> 00:43:39,674
- Nah.
- Come on.

981
00:43:39,676 --> 00:43:41,040
Come on. Let's get a beer.

982
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:42,540
- [chuckles]
- Come on, let's get a beer.

983
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:43,773
Okay, leave me alone,
leave me alone. [chuckles]

984
00:43:43,775 --> 00:43:45,806
[Tony] All right.

985
00:43:45,808 --> 00:43:47,440
Don't stay up too late,
kemosabe.

986
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:49,875
[door opens and closes]

987
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:42,107
[Lionel] Give up the seat,
asshole!

988
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:43,775
Give her the seat!

989
00:45:04,908 --> 00:45:06,975
[inaudible conversation]

990
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,242
[gate closes]

991
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:08,342
[horn honks]

992
00:46:10,276 --> 00:46:11,707
Hey, Gabby, they're closed.

993
00:46:11,709 --> 00:46:13,040
[Gabby] Oh,
you gotta be kidding me!

994
00:46:13,042 --> 00:46:15,376
- [Laura] Yes...
- [Gabby] At 3:30? Ugh.

995
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:29,509
[indistinct chatter]

996
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,075
[applause]

997
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:58,540
Hey, pal,
I'm new to this beat.

998
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:59,940
What's the story here?

999
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,973
Stories of injustice
and despair,

1000
00:47:01,975 --> 00:47:03,407
nodding assurances,

1001
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:07,307
and back to business as usual.
The American way.

1002
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:09,307
Though this one
could make things interesting.

1003
00:47:09,309 --> 00:47:12,407
Hey, who's the, uh,
guy on the far right?

1004
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:14,207
It's Brooklyn
borough president.

1005
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,773
What are you,
a television reporter?

1006
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:17,040
No, just new.

1007
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,507
We'll commence
this public comment.

1008
00:47:18,509 --> 00:47:20,741
State your name, address,
and affiliation, please.

1009
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:22,040
I'm William Lieberman,

1010
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:23,540
Mayor's Commission
on Slum Clearance.

1011
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:25,973
We'll arrange an appropriate
resolution for you.

1012
00:47:25,975 --> 00:47:27,340
Resident of East...

1013
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:28,409
- Lieberman.
- ...65th Street, Manhattan.

1014
00:47:31,276 --> 00:47:34,840
Cindy Fleming,
homemaker, Yonkers.

1015
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:36,407
Formerly East Tremont.

1016
00:47:36,409 --> 00:47:38,207
My family was forced to move
when they seized

1017
00:47:38,209 --> 00:47:40,240
our building for the Bronx
Expressway and I want

1018
00:47:40,242 --> 00:47:41,840
- people to know that...
- Mrs. Horowitz.

1019
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:43,307
Miss.

1020
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:45,607
Miss Horowitz, you may not
hijack these proceedings

1021
00:47:45,609 --> 00:47:47,274
- to air out old complaints...
- Gabby Horowitz,

1022
00:47:47,276 --> 00:47:48,806
Committee for Racial
Discrimination in Housing,

1023
00:47:48,808 --> 00:47:51,274
552 Clinton Avenue, Brooklyn.

1024
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:52,773
I thought that this was
a community hearing?

1025
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:54,240
On housing, not highways.

1026
00:47:54,242 --> 00:47:56,140
You're making the same
promises to Fort Greene

1027
00:47:56,142 --> 00:47:57,906
you made in East Tremont,

1028
00:47:57,908 --> 00:48:00,806
where your so-called
"relocation services"

1029
00:48:00,808 --> 00:48:02,340
vanished into thin air

1030
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:05,073
and left families like
the Flemings utterly adrift.

1031
00:48:05,075 --> 00:48:06,674
People have a right to know
what they're in for.

1032
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,574
We are totally committed
to the welfare of families

1033
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:10,906
displaced by necessary

1034
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:13,007
community improvement programs

1035
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:16,574
and the past has been
instructive, miss,

1036
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:18,173
but our new contractors

1037
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,374
will ensure
all find adequate homes...

1038
00:48:20,376 --> 00:48:22,240
This isn't Long Island,
you know.

1039
00:48:22,242 --> 00:48:24,040
It's not just a blank canvas

1040
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:25,507
you can paint on
anywhere you like.

1041
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:28,674
There are people here,
established communities.

1042
00:48:28,676 --> 00:48:29,741
[applause]

1043
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,140
Bill, if I may...

1044
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:33,073
I hope you all know my name.
I'm the mayor,

1045
00:48:33,075 --> 00:48:35,009
newly residing
in Gracie Mansion.

1046
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:37,107
Uh, Miss Horowitz,

1047
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:39,574
thank you for your work
and your passion.

1048
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:41,040
Surely we can all agree that

1049
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:43,274
even in a city as great
as ours we have slums,

1050
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:46,340
and that slums are not to be
romanticized or preserved.

1051
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,574
You tear them down

1052
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:48,840
and improve quality of life
for everyone...

1053
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,173
A neighborhood is not a slum,

1054
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:52,540
because poor people
and minorities

1055
00:48:52,542 --> 00:48:55,073
- live there, Mr. Mayor.
- [applause]

1056
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:57,674
East Tremont wasn't a slum,

1057
00:48:57,676 --> 00:48:59,440
Third Avenue wasn't a slum,

1058
00:48:59,442 --> 00:49:02,040
and Fort Greene isn't a slum,
either.

1059
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,140
These are working-class
communities.

1060
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:07,540
Your developers are making
them slums, Mr. Randolph!

1061
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:10,340
That is unsubstantiated
and unmitigated bunk!

1062
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:11,973
[Gabby] We have
got it on paper.

1063
00:49:11,975 --> 00:49:13,407
We got 20 people here tonight

1064
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,674
and scores behind them

1065
00:49:14,676 --> 00:49:17,973
who can testify to
a scandalous fraud underway.

1066
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:19,407
Which way
do you want it first?

1067
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:20,476
[loud applause]

1068
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:22,873
Hey, hey, hey!

1069
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,307
We are embarking

1070
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:25,906
on the most ambitious
slum clearance program

1071
00:49:25,908 --> 00:49:27,607
in American history,
Mrs. Horowitz,

1072
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:30,440
and you are gumming it up
with your molasses!

1073
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:32,207
A Niagara of molasses!

1074
00:49:32,209 --> 00:49:34,440
[Paul] Make him say his name!

1075
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:36,540
Name and place of residence
like everyone else!

1076
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:39,940
Now, see here, we all know
perfectly well who this is.

1077
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:41,806
Mo Randolph is one of our
greatest public servants.

1078
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:43,173
He's a living legend.

1079
00:49:43,175 --> 00:49:45,806
Name and residence,
like everybody else!

1080
00:49:45,808 --> 00:49:47,207
Shiver shitty self!

1081
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:49,307
He's led the Parks Department
for over 30 years.

1082
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:50,641
He's Commissioner
of Construction.

1083
00:49:50,643 --> 00:49:52,173
He's got
too many jobs to name.

1084
00:49:52,175 --> 00:49:54,507
And he lives right across
the street from me on 88th.

1085
00:49:54,509 --> 00:49:56,474
Make him say it!

1086
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:57,940
[Mayor] So, let's stick to the
issues concerning the citizens of...

1087
00:49:57,942 --> 00:49:59,507
- [all clamoring]
- [Paul] Name, address!

1088
00:49:59,509 --> 00:50:00,507
[Mayor] See here now,
if we can't keep this civil...

1089
00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:01,641
[Paul] Say it!

1090
00:50:01,643 --> 00:50:03,674
...we'll have to ask you
to leave!

1091
00:50:03,676 --> 00:50:04,875
[Paul] Say it!

1092
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:06,806
Hey!

1093
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:08,342
[all booing]

1094
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,674
Two fuckin' pigs in a blanket!
Ow!

1095
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:17,307
Hey! Say it, Hammy House Head!

1096
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:20,476
[people chanting]
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1097
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:28,175
[Lionel] I got a condition.
Easy!

1098
00:50:28,975 --> 00:50:30,840
"Hammy Ham House Head"?

1099
00:50:30,842 --> 00:50:32,507
That's good.
I gotta remember that one.

1100
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,007
- If!
- Yeah, well,

1101
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:36,840
that's the rub in life,
all right, if. If only.

1102
00:50:36,842 --> 00:50:38,274
[Lionel] Hey...

1103
00:50:38,276 --> 00:50:39,940
You know things about
that guy, Bill Lieberman?

1104
00:50:39,942 --> 00:50:41,274
Is he in charge of
this whole housing deal?

1105
00:50:41,276 --> 00:50:43,073
[Paul] Charge?
No, he's not in charge.

1106
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:45,240
More in charge than that guy
calling himself the mayor,

1107
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,908
but they all work for Moses.

1108
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:51,173
Hey, hey, stop, stop,
wait a second.

1109
00:50:51,175 --> 00:50:52,906
- Let me go. You nuts?
- You just said Formosa.

1110
00:50:52,908 --> 00:50:54,374
- What is that?
- What's Formosa?

1111
00:50:54,376 --> 00:50:56,140
You said, "Working Formosa."
What does that mean?

1112
00:50:56,142 --> 00:50:58,873
No, Jesus, I said, "They're
all working for Moses."

1113
00:50:58,875 --> 00:51:00,509
Moses Randolph.

1114
00:51:01,842 --> 00:51:03,641
Mo Randolph?
The guy who walked in late?

1115
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,374
He who will not speak his name
like one of the rabble.

1116
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:07,507
What do you care?

1117
00:51:07,509 --> 00:51:09,173
Hey, hey, um...

1118
00:51:09,175 --> 00:51:11,607
I'm Jake Gleason.
I'm with the <i>Post.</i>

1119
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:13,973
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

1120
00:51:13,975 --> 00:51:16,542
I'm hungry.
You can buy me dinner.

1121
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:20,207
[Lionel] Okay,
that means the one guy

1122
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:21,607
answers to the other guy,
but they all

1123
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:23,040
- gotta answer to the mayor.
- The mayor?

1124
00:51:23,042 --> 00:51:24,440
That clown is so green,

1125
00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:26,374
he doesn't even know
what he doesn't know yet.

1126
00:51:26,376 --> 00:51:28,840
He'll be out the door
before he even realizes

1127
00:51:28,842 --> 00:51:30,374
that every person
he turns to for advice

1128
00:51:30,376 --> 00:51:31,973
- is on Randolph's payroll.
- I thought he was

1129
00:51:31,975 --> 00:51:33,507
- the parks commissioner.
- He is.

1130
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:35,007
But they called him
the construction commissioner

1131
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,340
- in there.
- He's that, too, now,

1132
00:51:36,342 --> 00:51:38,073
but they didn't even
have that position

1133
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:40,507
until the Feds decided
to get in the housing game.

1134
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:42,140
There was no defined power,

1135
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:44,407
so he defined it,
they approved it

1136
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:45,574
and now how much control

1137
00:51:45,576 --> 00:51:47,173
over that money
has the city got? Zero.

1138
00:51:47,175 --> 00:51:48,540
He's got it all. You know

1139
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,073
- what "eminent domain" is?
- I think, yeah...

1140
00:51:50,075 --> 00:51:52,607
Yeah, if he says it's a slum,
it goes.

1141
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,073
He used to have to fight

1142
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,707
to put his highways and parks
where he wanted,

1143
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:57,940
and now, he goes anywhere,
tears anything down.

1144
00:51:57,942 --> 00:52:01,007
He can condemn
a whole section of the city,

1145
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:02,073
evict everyone
who lives there,

1146
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:03,374
and put up what he wants.

1147
00:52:03,376 --> 00:52:05,040
And he'll go at it
with an axe.

1148
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,440
Smacks with an axe!

1149
00:52:06,442 --> 00:52:08,073
But he'd be the most
hated guy in the city.

1150
00:52:08,075 --> 00:52:09,574
I mean,
he'd piss everybody off.

1151
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:11,009
They love him.

1152
00:52:11,842 --> 00:52:13,806
That's what makes me so...

1153
00:52:13,808 --> 00:52:16,307
He flies above it.
They revere him.

1154
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:19,307
- Why?
- Because he built the parks.

1155
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:22,574
As long as you're the guy
that brings people parks,

1156
00:52:22,576 --> 00:52:24,840
you walk with the angels,
you can't lose.

1157
00:52:24,842 --> 00:52:26,507
The day that
Rockaway Beach opened,

1158
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:29,307
Moses Randolph became
a folk hero in this town.

1159
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:31,906
People don't realize
how much he hates them.

1160
00:52:31,908 --> 00:52:34,840
"The hero of the public
who hates people."

1161
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:36,073
That's your headline.

1162
00:52:36,075 --> 00:52:39,173
And you know
who he hates especially?

1163
00:52:39,175 --> 00:52:40,240
Negroes.

1164
00:52:40,242 --> 00:52:41,973
He's going to seize
every neighborhood

1165
00:52:41,975 --> 00:52:43,574
in this city that's not white

1166
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:46,173
and turn it over to his
handpicked private developers.

1167
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:47,440
So, you're saying
he's getting rich,

1168
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:49,007
he's taking kickbacks
on all this?

1169
00:52:49,009 --> 00:52:50,607
No, he doesn't want money.
He wants control.

1170
00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:53,374
And he brokers money
to get it and guard it.

1171
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:56,440
Some guys aren't satisfied
unless they have filet mignon.

1172
00:52:56,442 --> 00:52:59,240
Moses Randolph
would be satisfied

1173
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:01,707
with a pastrami sandwich
and power.

1174
00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:03,973
Hey, uh, excuse me.

1175
00:53:03,975 --> 00:53:05,207
Could I get
a slice of cheesecake?

1176
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:06,574
Could you make it warm?

1177
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:08,107
I'd like it warm.

1178
00:53:08,109 --> 00:53:11,073
Half the city is getting
a ride on one of his horses.

1179
00:53:11,075 --> 00:53:12,607
For God's sakes, he controls

1180
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,674
every fuckin' construction job
in the city.

1181
00:53:14,676 --> 00:53:16,840
But you said they just
created the position.

1182
00:53:16,842 --> 00:53:19,140
No. Construction,
slums, parks.

1183
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,374
He's got 14 appointments.

1184
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,407
It's all just ink
on a glass door.

1185
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:24,407
None of it matters.
It's all BA.

1186
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:25,973
BA?

1187
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:28,207
Borough Authority.

1188
00:53:28,209 --> 00:53:30,773
You call yourself a reporter?
On what?

1189
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,440
- The arts beat?
- Beet farts!

1190
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:34,207
- You read Emerson?
- No, should I?

1191
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:37,107
- Yeah, you fucking should.
- All right.

1192
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:40,207
Emerson said that
"an institution

1193
00:53:40,209 --> 00:53:43,140
is the lengthened shadow
of one man."

1194
00:53:43,142 --> 00:53:45,474
<i>This town is run
by the Borough Authority</i>

1195
00:53:45,476 --> 00:53:49,276
<i>and the Borough Authority
is Moses Randolph.</i>

1196
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,509
[Lionel] If!

1197
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:37,507
Fucking Lieberman.

1198
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:39,142
If! [clears throat]

1199
00:54:49,342 --> 00:54:50,973
[Lionel]
<i>That quack in the diner</i>

1200
00:54:50,975 --> 00:54:52,741
<i>with pork chop
and peas in his beard</i>

1201
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:55,440
<i>was one of the most talented
engineers of his generation.</i>

1202
00:54:55,442 --> 00:54:57,973
<i>Ivy League.
Big awards.</i>

1203
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,507
<i>Walkin' right next
to his brother</i>

1204
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:01,607
<i>toward being
someone important.</i>

1205
00:55:01,609 --> 00:55:04,274
<i>Then, sometime
after the Crash, just...</i>

1206
00:55:04,276 --> 00:55:05,173
<i>nothing.</i>

1207
00:55:05,175 --> 00:55:08,040
<i>Like he got erased.</i>

1208
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:10,806
<i>Maybe it was bad luck,
maybe booze.</i>

1209
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:13,806
<i>There was all kinds of
casualties in those days.</i>

1210
00:55:13,808 --> 00:55:15,407
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

1211
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:16,741
please welcome

1212
00:55:16,743 --> 00:55:20,340
the president of the Gotham
Builders Association,

1213
00:55:20,342 --> 00:55:23,376
- Joe Pompano!
- [applause]

1214
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:28,840
Gotta show this
to Bill Lieberman.

1215
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:32,376
He's gonna want to see this before
Randolph speaks, believe me.

1216
00:55:36,476 --> 00:55:37,973
[union boss speaker]
Thank you. Thank you,

1217
00:55:37,975 --> 00:55:40,940
ladies and gentlemen.
Please settle down

1218
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:43,773
and lend
your serious attention.

1219
00:55:43,775 --> 00:55:45,140
Don't worry. We'll celebrate.

1220
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:48,607
We're gonna eat like
only we know how to eat.

1221
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:51,707
Tonight's celebration
is made very special

1222
00:55:51,709 --> 00:55:53,407
by our guest of honor,

1223
00:55:53,409 --> 00:55:54,973
a brother to our trade...

1224
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:56,407
- Hey, Gleason, right?
- Hey.

1225
00:55:56,409 --> 00:55:57,973
...who would rightly be hailed
this country's

1226
00:55:57,975 --> 00:55:59,641
- master builder...
- Nice threads.

1227
00:55:59,643 --> 00:56:03,307
...or "the Great Dirt Mover"

1228
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:04,973
- as he likes to be called.
- [laughter]

1229
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:06,973
Don't let them see you
pull out a notebook.

1230
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:11,207
Tonight, it's
"Press: Forget about it."

1231
00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:13,307
[union boss speaker] We'd have
to look to the Caesars

1232
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:17,574
and pharaohs to find men
with a scale of vision

1233
00:56:17,576 --> 00:56:19,073
to compare with his.

1234
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,707
- A great man.
- If!

1235
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:22,240
A man of history,

1236
00:56:22,242 --> 00:56:26,773
serving the people of
this city for over 25 years,

1237
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:29,674
Moses Randolph!

1238
00:56:29,676 --> 00:56:31,542
[applause]

1239
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:41,607
Jeez, you'd think
Patton showed up.

1240
00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:44,940
He pays one and a half times
union rate on all of his jobs.

1241
00:56:44,942 --> 00:56:47,175
They'd pave over
their mothers for him.

1242
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:49,808
Thank you, Joe.

1243
00:56:50,576 --> 00:56:53,140
Tonight, over 300 years

1244
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:55,407
since the founding
of this great city,

1245
00:56:55,409 --> 00:56:59,173
we recommit ourselves
to the ancient truth

1246
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:01,440
that it is not knowledge,

1247
00:57:01,442 --> 00:57:03,274
but action and enterprise

1248
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:07,474
which are the engine
and objective in life.

1249
00:57:07,476 --> 00:57:09,374
Clever men come and go,

1250
00:57:09,376 --> 00:57:13,140
but for every dozen of them
with their big ideas,

1251
00:57:13,142 --> 00:57:15,942
there is not more than one
that can execute them.

1252
00:57:16,775 --> 00:57:18,007
I look around this room,

1253
00:57:18,009 --> 00:57:19,707
I don't see
a lot of bright boys

1254
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:23,507
or goodie-goodie progressives
with their paralyzing ideals.

1255
00:57:23,509 --> 00:57:25,042
[laughter]

1256
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,042
I see the men of my tribe.

1257
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:31,073
The men who get things done.

1258
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:33,840
The doers that make
this country great!

1259
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:35,908
[applause]

1260
00:57:36,709 --> 00:57:38,674
To be honored by you

1261
00:57:38,676 --> 00:57:42,808
is all the affirmation or
payment I shall ever seek.

1262
00:57:43,808 --> 00:57:45,342
I celebrate you

1263
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:47,440
and I thank you.

1264
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:49,207
[men] Hear, hear!

1265
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,542
[applause]

1266
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:08,342
[inaudible conversation]

1267
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:15,075
[whispering indistinctly]

1268
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:23,440
I'll catch you
on the next one.

1269
00:58:23,442 --> 00:58:24,442
All right.

1270
00:58:56,276 --> 00:58:57,540
You finished it?

1271
00:58:57,542 --> 00:58:59,340
Best work I've done.

1272
00:58:59,342 --> 00:59:02,973
A total modernization of
the state's electrical grid.

1273
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:05,975
And it's a scale
that only you can get done.

1274
00:59:11,242 --> 00:59:12,641
Clean yourself up,
for Christ sakes.

1275
00:59:12,643 --> 00:59:14,240
How? With what?

1276
00:59:14,242 --> 00:59:15,973
Hey, not a fuckin' word
out of you about any of that.

1277
00:59:15,975 --> 00:59:17,307
You bring that up to me
ever again,

1278
00:59:17,309 --> 00:59:18,574
I'm gonna close you out
for good.

1279
00:59:18,576 --> 00:59:20,173
Moses, I'm so far out,

1280
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:22,707
I'm doing piecework
for kids fresh out of school.

1281
00:59:22,709 --> 00:59:25,073
[Moses] You whip up a crowd
against me like that ever again,

1282
00:59:25,075 --> 00:59:26,440
I'm gonna take your big idea,

1283
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:27,873
I'll throw it
on the fuckin' scrap heap.

1284
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,940
- Is that what you want?
- No, no.

1285
00:59:29,942 --> 00:59:32,540
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1286
00:59:32,542 --> 00:59:34,340
None of that matters.

1287
00:59:34,342 --> 00:59:36,842
Just read it.

1288
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:39,975
I'll read it.

1289
00:59:41,709 --> 00:59:44,242
[Lionel] <i>What makes a person
go against their own brother?</i>

1290
00:59:45,376 --> 00:59:47,007
<i>All my life,
I'd never had a family,</i>

1291
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:48,607
<i>so I never could
understand people</i>

1292
00:59:48,609 --> 00:59:51,140
<i>who did and let it get ugly.</i>

1293
00:59:51,142 --> 00:59:55,107
<i>My crazy brain was tellin' me I
should keep pullin' on that thread,</i>

1294
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:56,507
<i>but whatever Frank found,</i>

1295
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,407
<i>he found it
following the girl.</i>

1296
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:01,009
<i>So, I just kept chasin'
his footsteps.</i>

1297
01:00:19,626 --> 01:00:20,825
Hello?

1298
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:23,992
Hello?

1299
01:01:03,584 --> 01:01:05,651
- [woman sobbing]
- [indistinct chatter]

1300
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,550
If!

1301
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,217
Keep it together, Freakshow.

1302
01:01:42,851 --> 01:01:43,851
Jesus.

1303
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:48,815
- You lookin' for somethin'?
- Help, Bailey!

1304
01:01:48,817 --> 01:01:50,148
Ah, shit.

1305
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:51,415
What, you think you can just
walk into people's homes?

1306
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:52,815
No, I was lookin' for someone.

1307
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:54,082
I didn't think
anybody lived here.

1308
01:01:54,084 --> 01:01:55,248
Oh, someone lives here.

1309
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,482
- My momma lives here.
- Sure.

1310
01:01:56,484 --> 01:01:58,248
- At least, she's tryin' to.
- If!

1311
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,548
Who you with?

1312
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,049
- Huh?
- I hope you're with Belmont.

1313
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,851
Yeah, yeah, Belmont.
Who else?

1314
01:02:03,717 --> 01:02:04,784
[thuds]

1315
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:08,615
[Laura] What is going on?

1316
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:10,417
[man] We got ourselves
an intruder.

1317
01:02:11,951 --> 01:02:14,315
- How hard did you hit him?
- I barely tapped him.

1318
01:02:14,317 --> 01:02:15,749
Fool slipped
and hit his own head.

1319
01:02:15,751 --> 01:02:16,751
[Lionel] If!

1320
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:19,615
"If" what?

1321
01:02:19,617 --> 01:02:21,448
I'll tell you what, "if"...

1322
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:23,148
you better explain who you are

1323
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,684
if you want to
walk out of here.

1324
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:27,548
Have I seen you before?

1325
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:29,049
[Lionel] Yeah,
my name is Jake Gleason.

1326
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:30,148
It's a misunderstanding,
all right?

1327
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:31,749
I'm a reporter.

1328
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:34,415
I was at the Hamilton Housing
hearing the other night.

1329
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,049
I called the committee
this morning.

1330
01:02:36,051 --> 01:02:37,882
I came out here
looking for you.

1331
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:40,482
He the one that said he's with
those racketeering sons of bitches.

1332
01:02:40,484 --> 01:02:42,016
They stole her fridge.

1333
01:02:42,018 --> 01:02:44,749
They stole her copper pipes.
Man, what you expect?

1334
01:02:44,751 --> 01:02:47,382
First, they put up a notice says
the house will be condemned.

1335
01:02:47,384 --> 01:02:49,215
It's not true,
but that scares out

1336
01:02:49,217 --> 01:02:50,849
about half
and they sell for cheap.

1337
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,348
Then they come in and take
the nice old family homes,

1338
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,148
chop 'em into four
and rent 'em up.

1339
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:56,982
Folks who don't leave,
they harass,

1340
01:02:56,984 --> 01:02:58,548
turn the heat off,

1341
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,749
come in to do repairs
and steal copper pipe instead.

1342
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:04,281
The city sold property worth
$15 million for 500,000

1343
01:03:04,283 --> 01:03:07,215
to take the risk of having to
build the federal projects.

1344
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:08,815
They haven't even
submitted plans,

1345
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:10,882
just milked it
till it really is a slum.

1346
01:03:10,884 --> 01:03:12,882
Slammer for the slum lords,
Bailey!

1347
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:14,448
- Ah...
- Oh, what?

1348
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:15,982
You're one of those who thinks
we're just agitating?

1349
01:03:15,984 --> 01:03:18,382
Making it up like some
Negro propaganda conspiracy?

1350
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:20,315
No, no, look, look, look.
I got a condition, okay?

1351
01:03:20,317 --> 01:03:23,417
It makes me say funny things,
but I'm not trying to be funny.

1352
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:55,234
I'm really not. I'm listenin'.

1353
01:03:56,234 --> 01:03:57,598
Where's everybody go?

1354
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:01,399
[sighs] Mostly just disappear.
Fade away.

1355
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:03,032
200,000 in two years,

1356
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:04,999
just from this part
of Brooklyn.

1357
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:07,299
- Mostly Negro. Latino.
- Yeah,

1358
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,132
but Horowitz said they did it
up in East Tremont, too.

1359
01:04:09,134 --> 01:04:10,865
- Same thing?
- Yeah, they did it

1360
01:04:10,867 --> 01:04:13,165
to a few Jews, too,
but not systematic like this.

1361
01:04:13,167 --> 01:04:14,798
How many parks, do you think,
have been built

1362
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,832
in this city since
he's been commissioner?

1363
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:18,598
255.

1364
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:21,001
How many of those in Harlem,
you think?

1365
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:22,965
One.

1366
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:25,432
You build a new beach
for the people,

1367
01:04:25,434 --> 01:04:26,732
but the ones with no cars,

1368
01:04:26,734 --> 01:04:28,165
the poor ones,
the black and brown ones,

1369
01:04:28,167 --> 01:04:30,399
how are they gonna get
to the parks and beaches?

1370
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:32,232
Public bus.

1371
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:36,032
Guess how high they just built
the overpasses on the new parkway?

1372
01:04:36,034 --> 01:04:38,865
One foot too low
for a bus to clear.

1373
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,032
Come on.

1374
01:04:40,034 --> 01:04:41,765
Look, forget whether
it's discrimination.

1375
01:04:41,767 --> 01:04:43,366
The federal government and
the city are being scammed.

1376
01:04:43,368 --> 01:04:45,631
There's supposed to be
relocation services,

1377
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:47,299
company's got
a $2 million contract

1378
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:49,598
to handle it, but nobody
even answers the phone.

1379
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,165
Call the city,
they say these folks

1380
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:52,832
are on the list for
the new public housing,

1381
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:54,199
- but then it never gets built.
- You know more

1382
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:55,798
than any secretary
I ever met in my life.

1383
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,498
Secretary? Who told you that?

1384
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,132
I got a law degree, you know?

1385
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:02,466
I'll pass the bar
first time I sit, too.

1386
01:05:02,468 --> 01:05:04,332
Okay, then. Sorry.

1387
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:05,932
How are you gonna write about it
all if you don't even take a note?

1388
01:05:05,934 --> 01:05:07,732
What, "$2 million
for relocation services,

1389
01:05:07,734 --> 01:05:09,299
bridges a foot too low
for the buses,

1390
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:10,798
one out of 255 parks,

1391
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,665
15 million in property
for 500K,

1392
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:15,898
200,000 people
in Fort Greene alone." That?

1393
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,765
I never forget anything,
believe me.

1394
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:19,201
Not a single word.

1395
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:24,165
I'm really sorry. [stammers]
I can't help it, I got a...

1396
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:25,531
It's okay. [sighs]

1397
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:28,265
Just write about it, please.

1398
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:29,932
What happens to poor people
in this city

1399
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:32,432
wasn't news yesterday
and it won't be tomorrow,

1400
01:05:32,434 --> 01:05:35,732
but you'd think somebody'd
care what happens to Brooklyn.

1401
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:38,034
It's only the biggest city
on Earth.

1402
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,032
[sighs]

1403
01:05:41,034 --> 01:05:42,067
Where you live?

1404
01:05:43,334 --> 01:05:45,199
- Harlem.
- Hmm.

1405
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:47,199
This is me.

1406
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:48,867
You want me
to give you a ride?

1407
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:51,565
Come on,
the trains will be mobbed.

1408
01:05:51,567 --> 01:05:52,767
I'll give you a ride.

1409
01:05:54,034 --> 01:05:55,034
Come on.

1410
01:06:26,034 --> 01:06:29,165
Bebop, Bailey, in the
Metropolitan Bopera House!

1411
01:06:29,167 --> 01:06:30,965
[sighs] Oh, God.

1412
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:33,498
- [chuckling]
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1413
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,865
Don't be sorry.
It's kinda funny.

1414
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:39,900
Yeah? Well, hang around a little
while, and see what you think.

1415
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:45,267
If!

1416
01:06:46,201 --> 01:06:47,832
What is all that, anyway?

1417
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:51,199
I don't know.
I never got a name for it.

1418
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:53,832
It's like a piece in my head broke
off and got a life of its own

1419
01:06:53,834 --> 01:06:56,867
and then just decided to
keep joyridin' me for kicks.

1420
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,598
Kicks and tics!

1421
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,232
Licks and tics!
Sorry. [inhales deeply]

1422
01:07:02,234 --> 01:07:03,598
- It's okay.
- [sighs]

1423
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:06,466
It's like living
with an anarchist, you know,

1424
01:07:06,468 --> 01:07:10,366
but the funny thing is, it also has
to have everything in its right place.

1425
01:07:10,368 --> 01:07:14,399
Like, things have to be ordered
and lined up just right.

1426
01:07:14,401 --> 01:07:17,299
Everything has to sound
just right or else it really,

1427
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:19,999
it'll really put me into knots
until I fix it.

1428
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:22,466
Like, I'm talkin' to you
right now, right?

1429
01:07:22,468 --> 01:07:23,932
But that part of my head,

1430
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:26,698
it's worryin' that the bills
in my wallet

1431
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,498
aren't lined up all in
the right sequence,

1432
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,032
and it's sayin',

1433
01:07:30,034 --> 01:07:31,432
"Stop talkin' to this girl,
and deal with this."

1434
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:33,232
It's not fair.

1435
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:37,001
Hey, we all got
our daily battles, right?

1436
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:40,201
Yeah, fair enough.

1437
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,165
Kiss her face all night,
Bailey!

1438
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:49,099
- [laughing]
- Oh, God. [groans]

1439
01:07:49,101 --> 01:07:50,199
[sighs deeply]

1440
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:51,432
I'm...

1441
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,798
- I really am sorry.
- It's okay.

1442
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,032
- I don't mean nothin' by it.
- Don't be sorry.

1443
01:07:55,034 --> 01:07:56,700
It's okay.

1444
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:21,165
This is me.

1445
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:23,466
What, up from that?
That must keep you up nights.

1446
01:08:23,468 --> 01:08:25,698
[chuckles]
My father owns the place.

1447
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,965
I grew up falling asleep
in the back of clubs.

1448
01:08:28,967 --> 01:08:30,999
It's pretty hoppin'
for a Monday night.

1449
01:08:31,001 --> 01:08:33,201
Hottest band in the world,
all week.

1450
01:08:34,567 --> 01:08:36,132
Listen...

1451
01:08:36,134 --> 01:08:39,099
I gotta check
on one or two things,

1452
01:08:39,101 --> 01:08:42,500
but are you really interested
in what I was telling you?

1453
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,765
Yeah, I came lookin' for you,
didn't I?

1454
01:08:46,767 --> 01:08:49,700
If you wanna come in,
I could give you a lot more.

1455
01:08:51,867 --> 01:08:55,265
I don't tend to do so good
in places like this.

1456
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:57,065
Come on, you can't exactly
disturb the peace

1457
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:59,267
in a small club
with a hot band.

1458
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:02,234
All right.

1459
01:09:03,434 --> 01:09:05,101
- It's your party.
- [chuckles]

1460
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,466
[Laura] Keep an eye on it
for me, all right?

1461
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:16,667
[jazz music playing]

1462
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,533
[indistinct chatter]

1463
01:09:23,434 --> 01:09:24,700
[Laura] Hey, Vance.

1464
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:35,867
Hey, you, out.

1465
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,132
- Hey, George.
- Hey, girl.

1466
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,134
Welcome.

1467
01:09:43,434 --> 01:09:44,767
I'll be right back.

1468
01:09:45,867 --> 01:09:46,867
If!

1469
01:09:48,368 --> 01:09:50,999
Excuse me? Sir?

1470
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:53,565
I'm sorry. Um...
I'm a player, too.

1471
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:54,898
And, you know what, man?

1472
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,199
I really, really admire
your tremolo.

1473
01:09:57,201 --> 01:09:58,466
And I'm just curious,

1474
01:09:58,468 --> 01:10:01,565
how did you develop
that tremolo?

1475
01:10:01,567 --> 01:10:04,299
Suckin' off little
white boys like you.

1476
01:10:04,301 --> 01:10:06,366
Get the fuck out of here.

1477
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,898
So what?
Whitey White suck stick!

1478
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:09,765
[scoffs]

1479
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:11,500
"So what" is right.

1480

You sure you don't wanna
sit in the back?

Vance?

Trumpet player's a jazzmatazz!

[laughing]

1496
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,199
Can we just sit in the back?
Let's sit in the back.

1497
01:11:10,201 --> 01:11:11,533
No one cares.

1498
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:23,767
Ah!

1499
01:11:25,368 --> 01:11:27,898
It's better 'cause I can
control what's on it.

1500
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:30,067
Okay, you need
to get out more.

1501
01:11:34,934 --> 01:11:35,934

I can do this. It's not...

It's okay. It's okay.

01:16:08,034 --> 01:16:10,533
- Shut up!
- [Billy] Hey, I got this.

1535
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,698
You think I don't know
who you work for, cracker?

1536
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,132
[Lionel] Black cracker,
crack-whacker!

1537
01:16:16,134 --> 01:16:17,965
Hey... I made it through
Iwo Jima, motherfucker!

1538
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:19,432
You think your boss scares me?

1539
01:16:19,434 --> 01:16:20,898
Now you tell him that if I see

1540
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,232
any of you snoops
around her again,

1541
01:16:22,234 --> 01:16:24,466
I will kill you off
one at a time,

1542
01:16:24,468 --> 01:16:27,265
and I will mail what he's
lookin' for to the <i>Post</i> for free!

1543
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:29,967
Do you hear me?
I will mail it to the <i>Post!</i>

1544
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:32,600
Let's go.

1545
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,132
[Lionel] If!

1546
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:37,134
If!

1547
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,034
[panting]

1548
01:16:49,201 --> 01:16:50,734
[cat meowing]

1549
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:54,700
Meow, the tomcat!

1550
01:16:55,533 --> 01:16:57,500
Scarlet, the scared cat!

1551
01:16:58,401 --> 01:16:59,767
[lighter clicks]

1552
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:06,034
Trumpet, my man!

1553
01:17:10,134 --> 01:17:11,267
Hep cat needs help!

1554
01:17:12,267 --> 01:17:13,667
Help for the hep cat!

1555
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:17,432
You were pretty hep in there
tonight yourself, cat.

1556
01:17:17,434 --> 01:17:18,598
Help!

1557
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,201
The hep cat needs help!

1558
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,800
If!

1559
01:17:30,633 --> 01:17:33,265
What, your head need fixin',
too?

1560
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:34,698
- Yeah.
- Oh, whoa, whoa.

1561
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,498
Wait, now, this ain't
just no marijuana.

1562
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,900
It's all right.

1563
01:17:40,267 --> 01:17:41,533
[lighter clicks]

1564
01:18:12,201 --> 01:18:14,065
You remember what I said.

1565
01:18:14,067 --> 01:18:15,934
[trumpet playing]

1566
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,067
[music continues]

1567
01:18:38,401 --> 01:18:39,667
Oh, God.

1568
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:42,034
Shit.

1569
01:18:43,034 --> 01:18:44,798
Sorry.

1570
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,132
Sorry, I don't even know
what happened.

1571
01:18:47,134 --> 01:18:49,201
You had a good time,
that's what happened.

1572
01:18:50,234 --> 01:18:51,798
Had a little party.

1573
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,999
Different mix of people
than the usual.

1574
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:58,867
She called it
a <i>étrange mélange.</i>

1575
01:18:59,934 --> 01:19:01,299
Thought you could
use some rest,

1576
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:03,865
so we just let you be.

1577
01:19:03,867 --> 01:19:05,399
Oh!

1578
01:19:05,401 --> 01:19:06,765
Yeah.

1579
01:19:06,767 --> 01:19:08,032
That guy left his footprint
on my ribs,

1580
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:09,698
- I remember that part.
- [scoffs]

1581
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,598
Thanks for bailin' me
out of there.

1582
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,099
Sarge is a good man,

1583
01:19:14,101 --> 01:19:16,832
but you gotta watch how you
are around a man's family,

1584
01:19:16,834 --> 01:19:18,165
you know what I'm sayin'?

1585
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:19,232
Who's Sarge?

1586
01:19:19,234 --> 01:19:21,366
- Billy.
- Why you call him "Sarge"?

1587
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:23,832
You don't know how he got
his arm all fucked up?

1588
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:26,065
- Mmm-mmm.
- Colored Marine Unit,

1589
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:27,165
carryin' ammo,

1590
01:19:27,167 --> 01:19:28,732
and one day,
he picked up a gun

1591
01:19:28,734 --> 01:19:32,065
tryin' to stop a Jap
suicide attack, got hit.

1592
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:34,898
Came back from that war
bitter as hell.

1593
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:37,201
Damn shame, too,
'cause he could play.

1594
01:19:38,101 --> 01:19:39,099
Trombone.

1595
01:19:39,101 --> 01:19:40,765
- Hmm.
- He used to jam with us

1596
01:19:40,767 --> 01:19:43,167
down at Minton's
back in the '40s.

1597
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:46,498
You ever met his wife?

1598
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,965
Sarge ain't never married.

1599
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,531
What about Laura's mother?

1600
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:51,531
I don't know nothin'
about that.

1601
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:53,432
It was just Laura and him.

1602
01:19:53,434 --> 01:19:55,199
She was a tiny little thing,

1603
01:19:55,201 --> 01:19:58,167
always in the kitchen,
readin' while we was playin'.

1604
01:19:59,434 --> 01:20:00,999
You play?

1605
01:20:01,001 --> 01:20:03,598
- Music? No.
- Now, I'm not so keen

1606
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,101
on people bein' vocal
while we playin'...

1607
01:20:07,434 --> 01:20:09,466
but you was on the line.

1608
01:20:09,468 --> 01:20:10,865
I could hear it.

1609
01:20:10,867 --> 01:20:13,299
On the line, Lionel.
Lionel's on the line.

1610
01:20:13,301 --> 01:20:15,132
[sighs] Sorry, I...

1611
01:20:15,134 --> 01:20:18,132
I got somethin' wrong
with my head...

1612
01:20:18,134 --> 01:20:21,565
and the music really, really
set it off. I'm sorry.

1613
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,965
Don't be sorry.

1614
01:20:22,967 --> 01:20:25,466
You got a head
just like mine,

1615
01:20:25,468 --> 01:20:28,132
always boilin' over.

1616
01:20:28,134 --> 01:20:29,934
Turnin' things around.

1617
01:20:31,134 --> 01:20:32,199
But that's music.

1618
01:20:32,201 --> 01:20:34,399
Controls you
more than you control it,

1619
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:35,798
once it gets in you.

1620
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,199
Some people call it a gift,

1621
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:39,165
but it's a brain affliction
just the same.

1622
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,099
Yeah, well,
I just twitch and shout.

1623
01:20:41,101 --> 01:20:43,531
At least you got a horn
to push it through,

1624
01:20:43,533 --> 01:20:45,332
make it sound pretty.

1625
01:20:45,334 --> 01:20:48,466
Yeah, but there's a lot of
other hours in the day, though.

1626
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,232
You know what I'm sayin'?

1627
01:20:50,234 --> 01:20:51,700
Too many.

1628
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:57,201
[pen scratching]

1629
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,132
Look, thanks
for helpin' me out.

1630
01:21:02,134 --> 01:21:04,800
You ever need anything,
you give me a call.

1631
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,065
[woman] Excuse me.

1632
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,498
Miss Horowitz...

1633
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,199
- Jake Gleason with the <i>Post...</i>
- You're not Jake Gleason.

1634
01:21:17,201 --> 01:21:19,199
- I know Jake Gleason.
- [stammers] Jake Gleason

1635
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:20,999
took me to the Hamilton
hearing the other night.

1636
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,765
- I heard you speak.
- Oh.

1637
01:21:22,767 --> 01:21:24,865
I'm a new writer
with the <i>Times.</i>

1638
01:21:24,867 --> 01:21:28,099
I got a very illuminating tour
from your aide, Laura Rose.

1639
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:30,698
She showed me everything
that's goin' on in Fort Greene.

1640
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:32,399
I'm very interested
in this story.

1641
01:21:32,401 --> 01:21:34,698
Really? I thought that
the <i>Times</i> was more interested

1642
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:36,299
in being the press office
for the BA.

1643
01:21:36,301 --> 01:21:38,299
I'm not saying
I can make it A1 tomorrow,

1644
01:21:38,301 --> 01:21:39,865
but if I don't get some help
on the legwork,

1645
01:21:39,867 --> 01:21:41,366
how can I try, right?

1646
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:43,332
Well, someone's gonna win
a Pulitzer off that story.

1647
01:21:43,334 --> 01:21:44,732
Maybe it'll be you.

1648
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,565
If!
Sorry.

1649
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:49,498
She's already gone ahead
to the protest.

1650
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:51,232
You wanna come with me?

1651
01:21:51,234 --> 01:21:53,698
[reformer over mic] I want
you to hear this next speaker

1652
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:55,498
and listen
to what she has to say.

1653
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,099
She has taught me more about

1654
01:21:57,101 --> 01:21:58,732
fightin' the good fight
than anyone else.

1655
01:21:58,734 --> 01:22:00,399
Look, I brought
<i>The New York Times.</i>

1656
01:22:00,401 --> 01:22:02,665
[reformer] She wears granny
glasses, but don't be fooled!

1657
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:03,865
[crowd agrees]

1658
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:06,865
She is a pit bull
for the people!

1659
01:22:06,867 --> 01:22:09,865
And let me just say this,
let me just say this...

1660
01:22:09,867 --> 01:22:12,531
I want you to hear this.

1661
01:22:12,533 --> 01:22:15,299
- Let's not mince words.
- [crowd] No!

1662
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:17,565
'Cause we are livin' in a time

1663
01:22:17,567 --> 01:22:20,665
that calls for naming things
as they are.

1664
01:22:20,667 --> 01:22:21,965
[crowd] Yes!

1665
01:22:21,967 --> 01:22:25,698
This is not a program
for slum removal.

1666
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:26,932
[crowd] No!

1667
01:22:26,934 --> 01:22:30,399
This is a program
for Negro removal!

1668
01:22:30,401 --> 01:22:31,631
[crowd] Yeah!

1669
01:22:31,633 --> 01:22:32,965
And we're not
gonna accept that!

1670
01:22:32,967 --> 01:22:34,099
[crowd] No!

1671
01:22:34,101 --> 01:22:36,466
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gabby Horowitz!

1672
01:22:36,468 --> 01:22:38,533
[cheering and applause]

1673
01:22:40,867 --> 01:22:42,565
[Gabby] What is a city?

1674
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:44,665
Is it a place
where people slave

1675
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:47,332
for the lords
of steel and concrete?

1676
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:48,898
[crowd] No!

1677
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,432
A corral for the druids of
finance to fleece mankind in?

1678
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:53,531
[crowd] No!

1679
01:22:53,533 --> 01:22:55,732
A city is its people!

1680
01:22:55,734 --> 01:22:57,032
[crowd] Yeah!

1681
01:22:57,034 --> 01:23:00,466
- It is its community!
- [crowd] Yeah!

1682
01:23:00,468 --> 01:23:02,665
Who's gonna stand up
for the city?

1683
01:23:02,667 --> 01:23:04,032
[crowd] We are!

1684
01:23:04,034 --> 01:23:05,965
Who's going to remind
the politicians

1685
01:23:05,967 --> 01:23:08,366
and the power brokers
and the profiteers,

1686
01:23:08,368 --> 01:23:13,132
that the city belongs to
the people who live in it?

1687
01:23:13,134 --> 01:23:14,299
[crowd cheers]

1688
01:23:14,301 --> 01:23:18,032
[crowd chanting]
Mo must go! Mo must go!

1689
01:23:18,034 --> 01:23:20,999
I've never seen such horseshit
in my life.

1690
01:23:21,001 --> 01:23:24,299
Mo must go!
Mo must go!

1691
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:27,265
We may have an issue
with our friend from Brooklyn.

1692
01:23:27,267 --> 01:23:28,598
He's asserting himself.

1693
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,932
How so?

1694
01:23:29,934 --> 01:23:31,498
Well, he's not here
for this <i>mishigas.</i>

1695
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,965
He's not that brave,

1696
01:23:32,967 --> 01:23:34,265
but he still might not
go along with the vote.

1697
01:23:34,267 --> 01:23:35,732
Says his constituency
is up in arms.

1698
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:37,132
We made him
the borough president.

1699
01:23:37,134 --> 01:23:38,798
We put him
on the Board of Estimate.

1700
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,065
We're his constituency.

1701
01:23:40,067 --> 01:23:41,900
Don't tell me
he's not gonna go along.

1702
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:44,265
Hey...

1703
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:47,533
I'm gonna hand him this
the day before the vote.

1704
01:23:48,167 --> 01:23:49,167
He'll go along.

1705
01:23:50,567 --> 01:23:51,999
He's a louse.

1706
01:23:52,001 --> 01:23:55,234
[chanting continues]
Mo must go! Mo must go!

1707
01:23:58,134 --> 01:23:59,667
[laughing]

1708
01:24:01,434 --> 01:24:02,800
Let's go have lunch.

1709
01:24:04,401 --> 01:24:05,600
[Laura] Jake?

1710
01:24:06,468 --> 01:24:07,834
Hey, Jake!

1711
01:24:08,867 --> 01:24:10,432
Ah,
it's the disappearing lady.

1712
01:24:10,434 --> 01:24:12,032
I'm so sorry. I owe you an...

1713
01:24:12,034 --> 01:24:13,631
Oh, you don't owe me nothin'.
I'm used to it.

1714
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,765
No, no, [stammers]
I tried to find you. I...

1715
01:24:15,767 --> 01:24:17,865
- I want to explain...
- [Gabby] Laura!

1716
01:24:17,867 --> 01:24:19,399
You gotta go. It's all right.

1717
01:24:19,401 --> 01:24:20,832
Yeah, listen, I...

1718
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:22,101
I'll be at the club tonight.

1719
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,265
Come find me.

1720
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:25,834
- I'll, uh, I'll see if I can.
- [Gabby] Laura, come on!

1721
01:24:27,134 --> 01:24:28,134
Come.

1722
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,332
Hey, hey, hold up.

1723
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:35,065
[Paul] The reporter
that never reports.

1724
01:24:35,067 --> 01:24:36,932
Do I gotta write it for you?
Jesus.

1725
01:24:36,934 --> 01:24:38,232
You're not too ambitious,
are you?

1726
01:24:38,234 --> 01:24:39,965
I'm still puttin'
the details together.

1727
01:24:39,967 --> 01:24:42,199
- Tell me somethin'.
- Here's your next headline...

1728
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:43,598
"New expressway

1729
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,698
will be the world's
biggest parking lot."

1730
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:47,999
- What? Why?
- Because cars are a cancer

1731
01:24:48,001 --> 01:24:50,332
and roads make them
metastasize,

1732
01:24:50,334 --> 01:24:51,732
not shrink. We need trains.

1733
01:24:51,734 --> 01:24:53,832
- But he's killin' the trains.
- Why?

1734
01:24:53,834 --> 01:24:56,432
Always with the "why."
Because he doesn't control

1735
01:24:56,434 --> 01:24:57,932
the revenues from the trains.

1736
01:24:57,934 --> 01:25:01,299
He controls the tolls
for the bridges and roads.

1737
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:02,531
Borough Authority.

1738
01:25:02,533 --> 01:25:03,665
You know
what an "Authority" is?

1739
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:05,432
- No.
- Neither did anyone else.

1740
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:08,498
He invented it.
A fourth branch of government.

1741
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,698
A shadow branch.

1742
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,965
All controlled by him,

1743
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:12,498
meaning he controls
everything,

1744
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,165
but nobody voted for him,
and they can't vote him out.

1745
01:25:15,167 --> 01:25:17,366
Wait, wait, wait.
What could stop him?

1746
01:25:17,368 --> 01:25:18,631
[Paul] Almost nothing.

1747
01:25:18,633 --> 01:25:19,598
And he's more dangerous now
than ever.

1748
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,898
[Lionel] Why now?

1749
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:22,466
[Paul] 'Cause
the Board of Estimate

1750
01:25:22,468 --> 01:25:24,265
votes on his highway and slum
clearance plans this week,

1751
01:25:24,267 --> 01:25:26,366
so he's bullyin' everyone
into submission!

1752
01:25:26,368 --> 01:25:29,466
He's the most powerful man
in the history of the city!

1753
01:25:29,468 --> 01:25:32,631
He's an autocratic Caesar,
but nobody realizes it.

1754
01:25:32,633 --> 01:25:34,832
They are just
all walking around,

1755
01:25:34,834 --> 01:25:36,466
calm as Hindu cows,

1756
01:25:36,468 --> 01:25:37,798
thinking they live
in a democracy,

1757
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,165
so what could happen?

1758
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,432
Are you gonna write
about this or what?

1759
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:41,732
If you know so much about him,

1760
01:25:41,734 --> 01:25:43,531
why haven't you
taken him down?

1761
01:25:43,533 --> 01:25:44,798
Because it can't be me.

1762
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,567
No, 'cause you're his brother.

1763
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:53,900
No, because I still
have dreams.

1764
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,898
That's why.

1765
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,099
Dreams that I am this close
to realizing.

1766
01:25:58,101 --> 01:26:01,399
It's my contribution
to society.

1767
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:03,265
My legacy!

1768
01:26:03,267 --> 01:26:04,631
I'm...

1769
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:06,201
I'm not gonna risk it.

1770
01:26:07,401 --> 01:26:08,900
All right.

1771
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:14,332
Okay, here...

1772
01:26:14,334 --> 01:26:19,067
look at Belmont Developers
and Inwood Residential.

1773
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,965
What's all that?

1774
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,598
Oh, God, I'm givin' the goods.

1775
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,299
A map to the scoop
of the decade!

1776
01:26:25,301 --> 01:26:27,332
Do your damn job!

1777
01:26:27,334 --> 01:26:28,665
Do the job!

1778
01:26:28,667 --> 01:26:30,967
I got enough problems.

1779
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,631
[receptionist] Records Office.

1780
01:26:35,633 --> 01:26:37,531
Sorry, I'll need to
see your identification

1781
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:38,798
and have you
sign into the log.

1782
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,332
I'm just gonna read it
right here, pal.

1783
01:26:40,334 --> 01:26:41,565
I'm not checkin' it out.

1784
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:43,132
See, parties wishing to review

1785
01:26:43,134 --> 01:26:44,898
incorporation materials
of city contractors need to

1786
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,132
register with the construction
commissioner's office.

1787
01:26:47,134 --> 01:26:48,665
That can't be legal.

1788
01:26:48,667 --> 01:26:51,199
Not really a law,
more of a rule, Mister...

1789
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:52,600
[Lionel] Gleason.

1790
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:22,734
[doorbell tinkles]

1791
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:26,165
- Good evening.
- Hey...

1792
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:28,765
so I can get my housing
relocation forms here, yeah?

1793
01:27:28,767 --> 01:27:30,299
Yeah, just there.

1794
01:27:30,301 --> 01:27:31,698
And you can mail those in?

1795
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,366
Uh, in-person relocation
applications only.

1796
01:27:34,368 --> 01:27:36,832
- Over there.
- Oh.

1797
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:40,598
So, they left you runnin' this whole
operation by yourself, did they?

1798
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,199
Mmm, they did, indeed.

1799
01:27:42,201 --> 01:27:43,999
Big tits! [clears throat]

1800
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:46,065
- Bless you.
- [sighs]

1801
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:48,234
You have a good evening.
Thanks for your help.

1802
01:27:49,067 --> 01:27:50,067
Wait, your form!

1803
01:28:28,633 --> 01:28:30,001
[Lionel groans]

1804
01:28:31,434 --> 01:28:32,867
[Lionel coughing]

1805
01:28:34,667 --> 01:28:37,199
People's trash
remains private property

1806
01:28:37,201 --> 01:28:38,999
until it's been collected.

1807
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:40,867
Didn't anybody
ever tell you that?

1808
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:42,865
Wait a minute.

1809
01:28:42,867 --> 01:28:45,332
We've seen each other before,
ain't we?

1810
01:28:45,334 --> 01:28:46,832
Ain't we seen him?

1811
01:28:46,834 --> 01:28:49,299
Yeah, we seen him.

1812
01:28:49,301 --> 01:28:51,466
You keep stickin' your nose
in people's trash,

1813
01:28:51,468 --> 01:28:53,167
and we're gonna see you again.

1814
01:28:58,201 --> 01:29:00,399
[Lionel] Giant,
faggot munchkin meat!

1815
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:02,267
[Lou] Oh. Okay.

1816
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:05,598
See...

1817
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,965
I was told to go easy,
and I did...

1818
01:29:08,967 --> 01:29:12,865
and now, you gotta go
and make me do this!

1819
01:29:12,867 --> 01:29:14,065
[Lionel]
They're not even pretending,

1820
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:15,765
they're just collecting
the checks

1821
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:17,165
and throwing these people's
lives in the trash.

1822
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,732
These guys make Tammany

1823
01:29:18,734 --> 01:29:20,432
look like Double-A ball,
I'm tellin' you.

1824
01:29:20,434 --> 01:29:22,132
People make deals
with politicians

1825
01:29:22,134 --> 01:29:24,132
for contracts all the time.
All right?

1826
01:29:24,134 --> 01:29:25,698
Kickin' it up the chain.
It's the nature of the thing.

1827
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,466
They're not makin' deals
with people,

1828
01:29:27,468 --> 01:29:28,832
they're makin' deals
with themselves!

1829
01:29:28,834 --> 01:29:30,299
They own the companies,

1830
01:29:30,301 --> 01:29:31,765
they're given contracts
through it and kickbacks.

1831
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:33,099
It's grand larceny.

1832
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,366
Land a farce on me!

1833
01:29:34,368 --> 01:29:35,732
- [Tony] Calm down.
- Don't fart on my land, man!

1834
01:29:35,734 --> 01:29:37,065
You got any weed?
Give him a smoke.

1835
01:29:37,067 --> 01:29:38,498
Minna said it was
the biggest gravy train

1836
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,832
of the century, and he said...

1837
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:41,399
And this all goes down
in two days.

1838
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:44,165
So, it's big stuff, but how's
Frank mixed up in it?

1839
01:29:44,167 --> 01:29:45,665
Every officer
of the Borough Authority

1840
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:46,999
is gonna make millions
on this deal,

1841
01:29:47,001 --> 01:29:48,732
- but none of it ties to him.
- To Frank?

1842
01:29:48,734 --> 01:29:50,565
- To Randolph.
- The parks commissioner?

1843
01:29:50,567 --> 01:29:51,798
Yeah, Moses Randolph.

1844
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,032
He's behind everything.

1845
01:29:53,034 --> 01:29:54,898
He's the one
who controls it all.

1846
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:56,832
Okay, listen, the girl had
the line on the scam, right?

1847
01:29:56,834 --> 01:29:58,598
She was the one diggin'
into all these companies

1848
01:29:58,600 --> 01:29:59,932
for the committee
and Horowitz.

1849
01:29:59,934 --> 01:30:01,299
I think she found something

1850
01:30:01,301 --> 01:30:03,232
that ties Randolph
straight to the money.

1851
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:05,366
Frank was followin' her,
and he figured it out,

1852
01:30:05,368 --> 01:30:06,665
and he took it in to Lieberman
and his goons,

1853
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:07,932
and he showed them,

1854
01:30:07,934 --> 01:30:09,432
he had his signature
on somethin'.

1855
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:13,001
I think Frank had somethin'
that nails Randolph.

1856
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:17,531
Come on! Come on!

1857
01:30:17,533 --> 01:30:18,865
Where did...
Where did we lose 'em?

1858
01:30:18,867 --> 01:30:20,732
- On the bridge.
- On the Borough Bridge.

1859
01:30:20,734 --> 01:30:22,199
Those guys were
Borough Authority!

1860
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:24,265
The Borough Authority
killed Frank!

1861
01:30:24,267 --> 01:30:25,665
Fuckin' Lionel.

1862
01:30:25,667 --> 01:30:27,631
I think you're really
on the sniff, I do.

1863
01:30:27,633 --> 01:30:28,832
All right, but one thing,
what's the angle

1864
01:30:28,834 --> 01:30:30,498
on this other guy
with the club?

1865
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,999
Her father? The fuck was Frank
talkin' to him about?

1866
01:30:33,001 --> 01:30:35,165
I don't know. That part,
I haven't figured out.

1867
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:38,165
It doesn't make any sense,
but he knows somethin'.

1868
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:39,665
He knows somethin'.

1869
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,001
All right, go home.

1870
01:30:42,134 --> 01:30:43,865
I'm gonna make some calls
around town.

1871
01:30:43,867 --> 01:30:46,199
Wait, who? What?
Who you gonna call?

1872
01:30:46,201 --> 01:30:48,667
Would you just trust me,
and let me run with it?

1873
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:54,399
[door opens]

1874
01:30:54,401 --> 01:30:55,932
[Lionel] <i>Frank was
the only person I knew</i>

1875
01:30:55,934 --> 01:30:57,366
<i>who thought
the way we won the war</i>

1876
01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:59,698
<i>was gonna cause us problems.</i>

1877
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:01,265
<i>He said, after the Crash,
we were diggin'</i>

1878
01:31:01,267 --> 01:31:03,832
<i>ourselves out
by taking care of each other.</i>

1879
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:05,265
<i>Now that we'd seen
what we could do</i>

1880
01:31:05,267 --> 01:31:06,598
<i>with our brute strength,</i>

1881
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:08,432
<i>there was no goin' back.</i>

1882
01:31:08,434 --> 01:31:10,132
<i>He said, from here on out,</i>

1883
01:31:10,134 --> 01:31:12,700
<i>the game's gonna be about
power from top to bottom.</i>

1884
01:31:15,134 --> 01:31:16,667
[phone ringing]

1885
01:31:25,201 --> 01:31:26,565
Yeah?

1886
01:31:26,567 --> 01:31:28,065
[Billy on phone]
<i>I know who you are.</i>

1887
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:28,999
Who's this?

1888
01:31:29,001 --> 01:31:31,366
<i>You're one of Minna's boys.</i>

1889
01:31:31,368 --> 01:31:32,531
Who's Minna?

1890
01:31:32,533 --> 01:31:34,132
<i>Don't bullshit me.</i>

1891
01:31:34,134 --> 01:31:35,999
<i>You gave your number
to the man with the horn.</i>

1892
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:37,665
<i>Sorry about roughin' you up.</i>

1893
01:31:37,667 --> 01:31:39,565
<i>I thought
you was one of 'em BA goons.</i>

1894
01:31:39,567 --> 01:31:41,832
Yeah, okay. So, what?

1895
01:31:41,834 --> 01:31:43,500
<i>Where's the envelope?</i>

1896
01:31:44,468 --> 01:31:46,332
I don't know. What's in it?

1897
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:48,332
[chuckles] <i>Hold on.</i>

1898
01:31:48,334 --> 01:31:50,698
<i>Look, we can't talk
about it like this.</i>

1899
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,565
<i>It's too complicated.</i>

1900
01:31:52,567 --> 01:31:54,065
<i>Meet me up at the club.</i>

1901
01:31:54,067 --> 01:31:56,299
<i>Park up the block
and come in the back.</i>

1902
01:31:56,301 --> 01:31:57,466
<i>I'll let you in there.</i>

1903
01:31:57,468 --> 01:31:59,600
- What, now?
- <i>Yeah, now.</i>

1904
01:32:01,034 --> 01:32:02,034
Okay.

1905
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:07,533
[groans]

1906
01:32:14,434 --> 01:32:15,967
[dog barking in distance]

1907
01:32:22,201 --> 01:32:23,267
[gunshot]

1908
01:32:26,434 --> 01:32:27,800
[door closing]

1909
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:37,867
[Lionel] Billy?

1910
01:32:46,034 --> 01:32:47,034
Hey.

1911
01:32:54,967 --> 01:32:55,967
Billy.

1912
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:05,134
Shit.

1913
01:33:10,633 --> 01:33:12,065
[car engine starting]

1914
01:33:12,067 --> 01:33:13,134
Son of a...

1915
01:33:15,334 --> 01:33:16,867
[tires squealing]

1916
01:33:21,533 --> 01:33:23,898
All right, so, uh,
he told you to come,

1917
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:26,099
then he bumped himself
so you could find him

1918
01:33:26,101 --> 01:33:27,665
before the staff came,
probably.

1919
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:29,232
No, I told you,
I didn't just find him,

1920
01:33:29,234 --> 01:33:30,732
I heard it happen, okay?

1921
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:32,765
He didn't shoot himself...
Shoot my shit, Bailey!

1922
01:33:32,767 --> 01:33:34,332
Sorry. Look,
someone else did this.

1923
01:33:34,334 --> 01:33:35,865
They tried to make it look
like he did it to himself,

1924
01:33:35,867 --> 01:33:37,165
but I heard 'em leave.

1925
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:38,932
Okay, we got powder burns
on the shirt,

1926
01:33:38,934 --> 01:33:40,999
point-blank, neighbors saying
he got money problems.

1927
01:33:41,001 --> 01:33:42,332
Seems pretty straightforward,
my friend.

1928
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:44,332
The gun was in his right hand.

1929
01:33:44,334 --> 01:33:45,598
So?

1930
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,765
His right arm
is like a dead fish.

1931
01:33:46,767 --> 01:33:48,665
He has a war wound, ace, okay?

1932
01:33:48,667 --> 01:33:50,832
He couldn't lift a Zippo,
let alone a .38.

1933
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:52,598
So, explain to me,
how'd he shoot himself

1934
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,832
in the heart
with his left hand

1935
01:33:53,834 --> 01:33:55,165
and then hand it off
to his right

1936
01:33:55,167 --> 01:33:56,167
before he punched out?

1937
01:33:57,533 --> 01:33:59,132
Look, guy went out on

1938
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:01,199
his own joint's center stage
with the lights and all...

1939
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:04,631
Gotta give him credit,
give him respect.

1940
01:34:04,633 --> 01:34:08,698
They usually send Division dicks up
to Harlem at 3:00 a.m. for a suicide?

1941
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,267
We go wherever we're needed.

1942
01:34:11,633 --> 01:34:12,965
Can I go now?

1943
01:34:12,967 --> 01:34:13,967
Yeah.

1944
01:34:15,368 --> 01:34:16,565
Oh, no!

1945
01:34:16,567 --> 01:34:19,099
- [Lionel] No, no, no.
- No, no!

1946
01:34:19,101 --> 01:34:20,633
[sobbing]

1947
01:34:45,167 --> 01:34:46,600
[Laura sighs]

1948
01:34:53,767 --> 01:34:56,834
I can't remember the last time
I saw him smile,

1949
01:34:58,468 --> 01:35:00,167
but why would he do that?

1950
01:35:01,567 --> 01:35:03,932
- To himself?
- He... He didn't.

1951
01:35:03,934 --> 01:35:06,598
He didn't. Someone killed him.

1952
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,999
What?

1953
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:10,565
They tried to make it
look like he did it,

1954
01:35:10,567 --> 01:35:11,834
but someone killed him.

1955
01:35:13,301 --> 01:35:16,132
No, no, nobody hated him
like that. No one.

1956
01:35:16,134 --> 01:35:17,565
I promise you,
I'm tellin' you the truth.

1957
01:35:17,567 --> 01:35:19,099
Who would do something
like that?

1958
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:21,034
The same people that did it
to a friend of mine.

1959
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:26,001
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1960
01:35:27,134 --> 01:35:29,600
You got someone
that you can call?

1961
01:35:32,468 --> 01:35:33,867
You all alone?

1962
01:35:36,734 --> 01:35:38,500
You got no idea.

1963
01:35:42,567 --> 01:35:43,934
It's okay.

1964
01:35:51,934 --> 01:35:55,034
Can you stay with me a while?

1965
01:35:57,401 --> 01:35:58,934
You want me to?

1966
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:14,598
If!

1967
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,399
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1968
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:17,600
- It's okay.
- Shit.

1969
01:36:19,067 --> 01:36:20,067
I'm...

1970
01:36:21,267 --> 01:36:22,631
I'm sorry. I...

1971
01:36:22,633 --> 01:36:23,898
- I don't know what happened.
- It's okay.

1972
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,734
- You fell asleep.
- It's okay.

1973
01:36:28,767 --> 01:36:30,567
Thank you for staying.

1974
01:36:31,967 --> 01:36:33,101
Yeah, sure.

1975
01:36:38,967 --> 01:36:41,067
I know how you're feelin'.
I really do.

1976
01:36:43,834 --> 01:36:47,232
Pretty soon, you're gonna hear
his voice in your head.

1977
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:49,165
He's gonna tell you
to pull yourself together

1978
01:36:49,167 --> 01:36:50,234
and get movin'.

1979
01:36:51,700 --> 01:36:53,299
And when you do,

1980
01:36:53,301 --> 01:36:55,498
you're gonna feel him smilin'
at you again, I promise.

1981
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,867
[sobbing]

1982
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:06,667
I really am sorry.

1983
01:37:11,834 --> 01:37:14,700
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1984
01:37:16,034 --> 01:37:18,267
Because I think
you're a good person.

1985
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,932
You're tryin'
to make a difference.

1986
01:37:21,934 --> 01:37:24,132
You actually care about
what happens to other people.

1987
01:37:24,134 --> 01:37:25,631
I just...

1988
01:37:25,633 --> 01:37:27,667
Not many people can say that.

1989
01:37:28,734 --> 01:37:30,600
It's a good way to be.

1990
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:35,600
You're sweet.

1991
01:37:39,167 --> 01:37:40,698
I don't think
that's how most people

1992
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,999
usually describe me
when they meet me,

1993
01:37:42,001 --> 01:37:43,498
but I'm glad
that you think so.

1994
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:44,932
[Laura chuckles]

1995
01:37:44,934 --> 01:37:47,232
[sniffles]

1996
01:37:47,234 --> 01:37:51,267
Anybody ever tell you
you talk in your sleep?

1997
01:37:54,368 --> 01:37:56,800
Um, I never slept
with anyone.

1998
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:01,832
You never slept with anyone?

1999
01:38:01,834 --> 01:38:05,167
I mean, I've been with
a few girls, but just not...

2000
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:10,900
not the kind who wanna stay
and sleep with me.

2001
01:38:16,533 --> 01:38:17,934
Who's Frank?

2002
01:38:22,034 --> 01:38:23,631
What?

2003
01:38:23,633 --> 01:38:26,099
You said that name
when you were asleep.

2004
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:27,867
You seemed upset.

2005
01:38:28,667 --> 01:38:30,631
Was he your friend who...

2006
01:38:30,633 --> 01:38:31,967
Yeah, I...

2007
01:38:32,767 --> 01:38:34,366
I worked with him, I...

2008
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:38,265
I worked for him,
but I met him when I was 12.

2009
01:38:38,267 --> 01:38:42,531
I was at that Catholic home
for boys on DeKalb.

2010
01:38:42,533 --> 01:38:44,232
They threw me in there
when I was six,

2011
01:38:44,234 --> 01:38:45,667
after my mother died.

2012
01:38:46,867 --> 01:38:48,765
Frank...

2013
01:38:48,767 --> 01:38:52,633
Frank kind of took me
under his wing.

2014
01:38:55,067 --> 01:38:57,034
You know, he never
called me my name.

2015
01:38:58,468 --> 01:38:59,967
He called me Brooklyn.

2016
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:03,065
Say, "Look at you,
Motherless Brooklyn,

2017
01:39:03,067 --> 01:39:05,767
you got no one
lookin' out for ya."

2018
01:39:08,001 --> 01:39:10,201
We all need someone
lookin' out for us.

2019
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,533
[water running]

2020
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,565
Is that your mother?

2021
01:39:34,567 --> 01:39:36,732
She's beautiful.

2022
01:39:36,734 --> 01:39:38,934
[Laura] She died
a long time ago.

2023
01:39:40,633 --> 01:39:42,234
I don't remember her.

2024
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,531
I guess we both
got nobody now.

2025
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:49,598
Listen, I gotta ask you,

2026
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,299
is there something
you're not tellin' me?

2027
01:39:51,301 --> 01:39:52,865
What?

2028
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:54,332
Is there something you're
holdin' out, you and Horowitz?

2029
01:39:54,334 --> 01:39:55,967
On all this housing deal?

2030
01:39:57,267 --> 01:39:58,531
Look, the...

2031
01:39:58,533 --> 01:39:59,798
Those goons at the BA,

2032
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,999
they're scared of something,
okay?

2033
01:40:01,001 --> 01:40:03,132
There's something big
out there

2034
01:40:03,134 --> 01:40:04,531
that has to do
with all this fraud

2035
01:40:04,533 --> 01:40:05,932
that you've been
diggin' around in.

2036
01:40:05,934 --> 01:40:08,565
I think it ties it right up
to Moses Randolph.

2037
01:40:08,567 --> 01:40:10,265
Do you know what it is?

2038
01:40:10,267 --> 01:40:12,432
No, no, I mean,

2039
01:40:12,434 --> 01:40:15,734
somebody's getting rich,
but no.

2040
01:40:16,934 --> 01:40:18,199
You gotta take this seriously.

2041
01:40:18,201 --> 01:40:19,665
If you're holdin' on
to some card

2042
01:40:19,667 --> 01:40:20,732
and you're waitin' to play it

2043
01:40:20,734 --> 01:40:21,898
to try to block that vote,

2044
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,698
you're playin'
a dangerous game.

2045
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,965
They already killed Frank,
they killed your father,

2046
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:27,165
they did this to me
last night,

2047
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,565
these people
aren't gonna stop.

2048
01:40:28,567 --> 01:40:29,665
What's Billy
got to do with it?

2049
01:40:29,667 --> 01:40:30,932
He knows something about it.

2050
01:40:30,934 --> 01:40:32,765
No. No, wait,
that's not possible.

2051
01:40:32,767 --> 01:40:34,565
He and my friend Frank
were working together on it.

2052
01:40:34,567 --> 01:40:35,965
He doesn't even...

2053
01:40:35,967 --> 01:40:39,065
He didn't even know
what I'm working on.

2054
01:40:39,067 --> 01:40:40,732
I have an uncle
who knows Gabby.

2055
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:42,001
He got me that job.

2056
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,265
You're not a reporter,
are you?

2057
01:40:45,267 --> 01:40:47,565
No, and my name's not Jake.
It's Lionel.

2058
01:40:47,567 --> 01:40:50,199
Look, Frank is
an investigator, okay?

2059
01:40:50,201 --> 01:40:51,698
That's who I worked for.

2060
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:53,765
They hired him to keep tabs
on your committee.

2061
01:40:53,767 --> 01:40:55,898
He was following you.

2062
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,498
I... I wasn't trying
to expose anything.

2063
01:40:58,500 --> 01:40:59,798
I just was poking into it

2064
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,865
to try to figure out
who killed him,

2065
01:41:01,867 --> 01:41:03,498
and now there's
so many goddamn pieces,

2066
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,665
it's like I got
glass in my brain

2067
01:41:05,667 --> 01:41:08,001
and I don't even know
what I'm after anymore.

2068
01:41:09,368 --> 01:41:10,698
I'm sorry for lyin' to you,

2069
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,965
but you gotta believe
what I'm sayin'.

2070
01:41:12,967 --> 01:41:14,466
You're webbed up
in this somehow,

2071
01:41:14,468 --> 01:41:15,932
and you're in danger.

2072
01:41:15,934 --> 01:41:17,565
Can you stay around
here today?

2073
01:41:17,567 --> 01:41:18,798
Gabby's expecting me.

2074
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,598
We're preparing our testimony.

2075
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,101
It's important, but...

2076
01:41:22,633 --> 01:41:24,299
[sighs]

2077
01:41:24,301 --> 01:41:26,765
I need to make arrangements.

2078
01:41:26,767 --> 01:41:28,165
- A funeral.
- Look,

2079
01:41:28,167 --> 01:41:30,065
none of that matters, okay?
If I'm right,

2080
01:41:30,067 --> 01:41:31,665
they're gonna keep a tight lid
on it and they won't even let

2081
01:41:31,667 --> 01:41:33,201
the coroner's office
release his body. Just...

2082
01:41:33,967 --> 01:41:35,032
Please.

2083
01:41:35,034 --> 01:41:36,332
Get one of the guys
from the club

2084
01:41:36,334 --> 01:41:37,965
to take you down to work.

2085
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:40,531
Stay around people that you
know for the next few days.

2086
01:41:40,533 --> 01:41:42,101
I'll come and find you.

2087
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:44,034
Okay?

2088
01:41:47,401 --> 01:41:48,965
Ah, okay, okay.

2089
01:41:48,967 --> 01:41:50,999
All right, all right,
all right.

2090
01:41:51,001 --> 01:41:52,032
Take it easy.

2091
01:41:52,034 --> 01:41:53,498
Jeez, they sent
the pros today.

2092
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,767
I must have...
I must have hit a nerve.

2093
01:42:16,567 --> 01:42:18,067
Oh, jeez, thanks.

2094
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:25,134
Hold this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

2095
01:42:45,234 --> 01:42:47,598
You know who I am?

2096
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,366
I've been asking around
about that.

2097
01:42:49,368 --> 01:42:51,965
Everyone seems to have
a different answer, though.

2098
01:42:51,967 --> 01:42:52,898
[Moses chuckles]

2099
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,366
Spoken like a true snoop.

2100
01:42:55,368 --> 01:42:57,234
Well, what's your take on it?

2101
01:42:58,134 --> 01:42:59,134
Easy.

2102
01:43:01,067 --> 01:43:02,267
I'm a builder.

2103
01:43:03,767 --> 01:43:05,267
Yeah, I can see that.

2104
01:43:06,101 --> 01:43:07,932
When I was a boy,

2105
01:43:07,934 --> 01:43:08,999
you know how many
bridges there were

2106
01:43:09,001 --> 01:43:10,531
on and off Manhattan Island?

2107
01:43:10,533 --> 01:43:12,232
Two.

2108
01:43:12,234 --> 01:43:14,332
A shitty little train trestle
here and the Brooklyn Bridge,

2109
01:43:14,334 --> 01:43:15,798
and when you crossed that,

2110
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,165
you were stepping over manure
much of the way.

2111
01:43:17,167 --> 01:43:19,232
People mostly scuttled
into New York

2112
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:21,101
off of docks, like rats.

2113
01:43:21,867 --> 01:43:24,531
I built that, and that...

2114
01:43:24,533 --> 01:43:25,800
and that...

2115
01:43:26,234 --> 01:43:27,466
and that.

2116
01:43:27,468 --> 01:43:29,798
And now,
people vault over rivers

2117
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,001
on the spans
and parkways of...

2118
01:43:33,434 --> 01:43:35,898
- Olympus.
- Olympic rat-man!

2119
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:36,965
Sorry.

2120
01:43:36,967 --> 01:43:38,265
Hmm.

2121
01:43:38,267 --> 01:43:39,598
They're some pretty bridges,
I'll give you that.

2122
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:40,999
Thank you.

2123
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:42,466
I want you to give me
something else

2124
01:43:42,468 --> 01:43:43,834
if you can find it.

2125
01:43:45,301 --> 01:43:46,765
Have you found it?

2126
01:43:46,767 --> 01:43:48,099
What's in it?

2127
01:43:48,101 --> 01:43:49,798
Slander, falsehood,

2128
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,232
forgery, most likely.

2129
01:43:51,234 --> 01:43:52,765
Well, then,
the law's on your side.

2130
01:43:52,767 --> 01:43:53,999
You got nothin'
to worry about.

2131
01:43:54,001 --> 01:43:55,732
Very little
I've achieved in my life

2132
01:43:55,734 --> 01:43:57,999
has relied on legality.

2133
01:43:58,001 --> 01:44:01,099
I'm not about to lean
on that slender branch now,

2134
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:03,065
when things matter most.

2135
01:44:03,067 --> 01:44:04,965
So, you're above the law?
That it?

2136
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:06,199
No.

2137
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:07,332
I'm just ahead of it.

2138
01:44:07,334 --> 01:44:08,531
What's the difference?

2139
01:44:08,533 --> 01:44:09,965
Well, the law's a rule book

2140
01:44:09,967 --> 01:44:12,232
we make for the times
we find ourselves in.

2141
01:44:12,234 --> 01:44:14,065
You rebuild the city,
in my experience,

2142
01:44:14,067 --> 01:44:17,032
the law will follow you
and adapt to what you do.

2143
01:44:17,034 --> 01:44:19,199
Yeah, a lot of people like
the city the way it is.

2144
01:44:19,201 --> 01:44:20,267
Who you rebuildin' it for?

2145
01:44:21,234 --> 01:44:22,267
The people to come.

2146
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,631
Fifty, 100 years from now,

2147
01:44:25,633 --> 01:44:28,099
what will matter
of what we've done now?

2148
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:32,165
What will help people
to make science fiction real?

2149
01:44:32,167 --> 01:44:33,965
The laws of today?

2150
01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:36,199
Or roads and bridges
and tunnels

2151
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:38,399
for commerce
to move swiftly over?

2152
01:44:38,401 --> 01:44:39,932
Beaches and parks
to let people

2153
01:44:39,934 --> 01:44:42,165
escape the rat race
and inspire the mind?

2154
01:44:42,167 --> 01:44:45,898
Palaces of culture where
hellish slums used to be?

2155
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:48,565
It all sounds pretty grand,
I guess,

2156
01:44:48,567 --> 01:44:50,466
unless you happen to be
one of the people

2157
01:44:50,468 --> 01:44:53,201
whose house is in the way
right now.

2158
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,867
[scoffs]

2159
01:44:55,533 --> 01:44:57,099
Central Park,

2160
01:44:57,101 --> 01:44:58,832
the greatest urban park
in the world.

2161
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,165
When they started
work on that,

2162
01:45:00,167 --> 01:45:02,265
there wasn't even a city
above 57th Street.

2163
01:45:02,267 --> 01:45:06,199
They kicked out farmers
and tenant squatters,

2164
01:45:06,201 --> 01:45:09,832
sheep-herders out
of muddy fields and filth.

2165
01:45:09,834 --> 01:45:11,466
They moved a few trees.

2166
01:45:11,468 --> 01:45:15,732
And people protested about
the loss of the countryside.

2167
01:45:15,734 --> 01:45:18,698
And if one man hadn't seen
ahead to what we'd need,

2168
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:21,834
this city would be unlivable,
would it not?

2169
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:23,700
Yes, it would.

2170
01:45:25,034 --> 01:45:28,032
Most people don't even know
Fred Olmsted's name,

2171
01:45:28,034 --> 01:45:30,101
yet they should thank him
every day.

2172
01:45:31,900 --> 01:45:33,001
I do.

2173
01:45:39,934 --> 01:45:42,999
The important thing in this
life is to get things done.

2174
01:45:43,001 --> 01:45:45,999
Those who can, build.
Those who can't, criticize.

2175
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:48,765
And I will not obstruct
the great work of this world,

2176
01:45:48,767 --> 01:45:50,531
while some chipmunks
are screeching

2177
01:45:50,533 --> 01:45:52,132
about having to relocate
their nuts.

2178
01:45:52,134 --> 01:45:53,798
Screech a nut, munk-chip.

2179
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,001
Chip a munk's love nuts, man.

2180
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,767
Uh...

2181
01:45:58,734 --> 01:46:00,466
I can't control it, I'm sorry.

2182
01:46:00,468 --> 01:46:01,667
It's all right.

2183
01:46:03,167 --> 01:46:06,798
Talent and brains are rewarded
in this building, Lionel.

2184
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,466
If you're with us,
I'll see to it personally

2185
01:46:09,468 --> 01:46:12,734
that your gifts
are appreciated.

2186
01:46:14,934 --> 01:46:16,834
But that's the offer today.

2187
01:46:18,934 --> 01:46:21,201
You let me know
where you stand by tonight.

2188
01:46:33,567 --> 01:46:35,399
It's funny. We read it wrong.

2189
01:46:35,401 --> 01:46:36,798
[Lionel] How's that?

2190
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,932
We didn't make you for the ace
in Minna's deck.

2191
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,165
Ace-hole!

2192
01:46:40,167 --> 01:46:41,700
Ace-hole!

2193
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,165
- You good?
- No.

2194
01:46:50,167 --> 01:46:52,765
Loosey, goosey,
thread-head fuck!

2195
01:46:52,767 --> 01:46:54,798
Jesus, Lionel. Calm down.

2196
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:56,332
[Lionel]
It's a missing piece, Danny.

2197
01:46:56,334 --> 01:46:58,032
It's a missing piece
and I can't see it.

2198
01:46:58,034 --> 01:47:00,700
It's makin'
my fuckin' brain hurt.

2199
01:47:14,533 --> 01:47:16,065
Where's the rest?

2200
01:47:16,067 --> 01:47:17,698
- Where's the rest of these?
- They're in the desk,

2201
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,765
but those are the only ones
with her in 'em.

2202
01:47:18,767 --> 01:47:20,032
No, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em.

2203
01:47:20,034 --> 01:47:21,732
These are all
from before she arrived.

2204
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:22,898
There was ones of Billy.

2205
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,665
- Yeah, look...
- Shutterbug shit!

2206
01:47:24,667 --> 01:47:26,732
God. Jesus, Lionel.

2207
01:47:26,734 --> 01:47:28,232
That's her father,
comin' out of the door.

2208
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:29,798
We saw all these.

2209
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,798
That's some bum
hustlin' for money.

2210
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,934
He yelled at him for a second,
but she's not in these.

2211
01:47:35,667 --> 01:47:37,832
That son of a bitch!

2212
01:47:37,834 --> 01:47:38,999
Where's the car keys?

2213
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:40,665
Coney and Tony got 'em both...

2214
01:47:40,667 --> 01:47:41,900
Wait, where...

2215
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:44,867
What'd I miss?

2216
01:47:46,267 --> 01:47:47,432
Where are we going?

2217
01:47:47,434 --> 01:47:48,567
I need you
to look at something.

2218
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,698
Who's that with your father?

2219
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,765
- Where did you get...
- Answer the question!

2220
01:47:53,767 --> 01:47:55,565
Do you know who that is?

2221
01:47:55,567 --> 01:47:57,065
Paul.

2222
01:47:57,067 --> 01:47:58,299
Paul Morris.

2223
01:47:58,301 --> 01:48:00,199
Paul, your uncle Paul,
who got you this job.

2224
01:48:00,201 --> 01:48:01,932
Don't shine me.
I already know who he is.

2225
01:48:01,934 --> 01:48:03,565
- My father...
- Yeah, your father

2226
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:04,965
and your uncle Paul,
and my friend Frank,

2227
01:48:04,967 --> 01:48:06,366
put all this together somehow.

2228
01:48:06,368 --> 01:48:07,698
- No...
- Yes, God damn it!

2229
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:08,832
Just tell me
what the hell is goin' on.

2230
01:48:08,834 --> 01:48:10,032
- No!
- Are you involved in this

2231
01:48:10,034 --> 01:48:11,366
- or not?
- No, that's not my father

2232
01:48:11,368 --> 01:48:12,765
with my uncle Paul.

2233
01:48:12,767 --> 01:48:14,667
It's my uncle Billy
with my father, Paul.

2234
01:48:15,368 --> 01:48:17,099
Pull it farther!

2235
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:18,898
What did you say?

2236
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,199
Remember that picture
of my mother?

2237
01:48:21,201 --> 01:48:24,167
Now look at Billy.
Now look at me.

2238
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:25,967
You see?

2239
01:48:27,368 --> 01:48:29,366
The rest of the world might
look past me without seeing,

2240
01:48:29,368 --> 01:48:30,832
but I don't.

2241
01:48:30,834 --> 01:48:32,832
- Wait, they told you this?
- They never said so,

2242
01:48:32,834 --> 01:48:34,932
but it doesn't take much
to put it together.

2243
01:48:34,934 --> 01:48:36,865
Why else would he take
such an interest in me?

2244
01:48:36,867 --> 01:48:38,732
Take care of me
when Billy was in the war?

2245
01:48:38,734 --> 01:48:40,598
Pay for law school
when he's got nothin'?

2246
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,999
Whoever he is,
he's using you now.

2247
01:48:43,001 --> 01:48:45,432
He's using you to get back
at his own brother.

2248
01:48:45,434 --> 01:48:47,032
I don't think he's got family.

2249
01:48:47,034 --> 01:48:50,432
Yeah, look, his name's not
Morris, okay? It's Randolph.

2250
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:52,565
Moses Randolph is his brother.

2251
01:48:52,567 --> 01:48:54,065
And he's using you
to blackmail him.

2252
01:48:54,067 --> 01:48:57,199
- That's not...
- It is. It is, I'm sorry.

2253
01:48:57,201 --> 01:48:59,765
Just wait here, all right?

2254
01:48:59,767 --> 01:49:01,633
Wait here until I get back.

2255
01:49:03,434 --> 01:49:05,399
That's not possible!

2256
01:49:05,401 --> 01:49:06,767
[doorbell buzzes]

2257
01:49:09,967 --> 01:49:11,332
You know what that tells me?

2258
01:49:11,334 --> 01:49:12,898
That tells me you and Billy
set this up

2259
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:14,165
with Minna to blackmail
your brother.

2260
01:49:14,167 --> 01:49:15,432
Where'd you get this?

2261
01:49:15,434 --> 01:49:17,265
It's you who figured out
the scam they're running.

2262
01:49:17,267 --> 01:49:18,765
It's you who found whatever
it is they're so scared of,

2263
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:20,366
but you made it look like
it came from Laura

2264
01:49:20,368 --> 01:49:21,765
- and the committee...
- No.

2265
01:49:21,767 --> 01:49:23,165
...so you could hide
behind her and Frank.

2266
01:49:23,167 --> 01:49:24,832
- That's not true.
- People are getting killed.

2267
01:49:24,834 --> 01:49:25,965
- You got it wrong.
- You got your own daughter's

2268
01:49:25,967 --> 01:49:27,498
- life at risk...
- You don't...

2269
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:29,765
You don't know what
you're fucking talking about!

2270
01:49:29,767 --> 01:49:31,765
[Paul breathing heavily]

2271
01:49:31,767 --> 01:49:35,598
I could have sunk him
so many times.

2272
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:37,598
- He sunk me!
- Sing a song of sunk men!

2273
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:39,732
- He sunk me!
- Sing a song of sunk men!

2274
01:49:39,734 --> 01:49:41,201
Hide behind her?

2275
01:49:42,633 --> 01:49:43,898
I gave up everything for her.

2276
01:49:43,900 --> 01:49:46,299
Everything I could
have accomplished

2277
01:49:46,301 --> 01:49:47,665
my whole goddamn life.

2278
01:49:47,667 --> 01:49:49,132
That's what happened
between you and him?

2279
01:49:49,134 --> 01:49:50,199
You were with her mother,

2280
01:49:50,201 --> 01:49:52,032
and he hates colored people
so much...

2281
01:49:52,034 --> 01:49:55,032
I will not discuss
such things with you!

2282
01:49:55,034 --> 01:49:56,498
[panting]

2283
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:59,500
I knew you weren't a reporter.

2284
01:50:00,134 --> 01:50:01,366
Load of shit.

2285
01:50:01,368 --> 01:50:02,531
You're Minna's guy.

2286
01:50:02,533 --> 01:50:04,265
Fuckin' right.
He was my friend.

2287
01:50:04,267 --> 01:50:06,734
I'm sorry, but it's not me.

2288
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:09,132
Frank put it all together.

2289
01:50:09,134 --> 01:50:11,531
He and Billy thought they
could get something out of it.

2290
01:50:11,533 --> 01:50:14,199
Foolish greed.
I tried to stop them.

2291
01:50:14,201 --> 01:50:18,399
Told them that it would
put her at risk, all of them.

2292
01:50:18,401 --> 01:50:19,798
Now look, Frank gets killed,

2293
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,832
Billy panics and calls me
for help,

2294
01:50:21,834 --> 01:50:23,332
that's your picture.

2295
01:50:23,334 --> 01:50:26,698
You're into something
that you don't understand.

2296
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:28,832
If you just stand up to him,

2297
01:50:28,834 --> 01:50:31,867
on principle, like I did...

2298
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:35,732
he will ruin you for spite,

2299
01:50:35,734 --> 01:50:37,665
but if you threaten his work,

2300
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:39,299
he will destroy you.

2301
01:50:39,301 --> 01:50:40,500
Destroy.

2302
01:50:42,134 --> 01:50:43,700
Find Minna's file.

2303
01:50:44,334 --> 01:50:45,934
[horns blaring]

2304
01:50:49,067 --> 01:50:51,267

01:50:53,734 --> 01:50:57,067
Frank.

2306
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,399
[sighs]

2307
01:50:59,401 --> 01:51:01,399
What's it all about, Frank?

2308
01:51:01,401 --> 01:51:02,934
[horns continue blaring]

2309
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:04,967
[sighs]

2310
01:51:07,633 --> 01:51:08,834
You remember what I said.

2311
01:51:10,334 --> 01:51:11,867
[distorted chatter]

2312
01:51:17,834 --> 01:51:19,201
I gotta keep this
under my hat, boys.

2313
01:51:20,101 --> 01:51:21,832
[gunshot]

2314
01:51:21,834 --> 01:51:23,432
Get my hat, you fucking...

2315
01:51:23,434 --> 01:51:24,498
...kept her under my hat...

2316
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:25,700
If!

2319
01:51:50,567 --> 01:51:52,600
Hey, take me to Penn Station.

2320
01:52:01,468 --> 01:52:03,667
[indistinct announcements
over PA]

2321
01:53:01,134 --> 01:53:03,201
- [man] Hey, look out!
- [woman] No, no, no!

2322
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:25,800
If!

2323
01:53:32,500 --> 01:53:34,034
[people clamor]

[door opens and closes]

2326
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:36,767
You found it?

2327
01:54:38,567 --> 01:54:39,767
Yeah.

2328
01:54:41,867 --> 01:54:45,732
There's only one way I can
make sense of that, though.

2329
01:54:45,734 --> 01:54:48,167
He didn't sign that
birth certificate, you did.

2330
01:54:51,434 --> 01:54:52,633
Yes.

2331
01:54:54,967 --> 01:54:56,067
I signed it.

2332
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:00,932
Billy brought her
to our family home.

2333
01:55:00,934 --> 01:55:03,531
Our servants tried
to send them away,

2334
01:55:03,533 --> 01:55:05,065
but Billy started yelling.

2335
01:55:05,067 --> 01:55:07,932
We were having dinner with
our mother, for God's sake.

2336
01:55:07,934 --> 01:55:09,900
I followed Mo to the door.

2337
01:55:10,434 --> 01:55:11,698
He scorned them.

2338
01:55:11,700 --> 01:55:13,832
Refused to acknowledge.

2339
01:55:13,834 --> 01:55:16,432
But I saw the truth
on her face

2340
01:55:16,434 --> 01:55:19,366
and his,
the way he looked at her.

2341
01:55:19,368 --> 01:55:22,631
- You confronted him about it?
- I begged him!

2342
01:55:22,633 --> 01:55:25,631
I invoked every principle
and value

2343
01:55:25,633 --> 01:55:28,201
that we had been raised
to champion.

2344
01:55:29,034 --> 01:55:30,700
I was in anguish.

2345
01:55:31,567 --> 01:55:33,065
You can't understand.

2346
01:55:33,067 --> 01:55:36,466
Our whole young life,
he was my hero.

2347
01:55:36,468 --> 01:55:37,832
We wrote a creed.

2348
01:55:37,834 --> 01:55:41,199
We were going to
fix the world together.

2349
01:55:41,201 --> 01:55:44,498
But to serve people,
you have to love people.

2350
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,900
Mo tried,

2351
01:55:46,867 --> 01:55:49,032
but he was so brilliant,

2352
01:55:49,034 --> 01:55:51,631
that he resented lesser minds

2353
01:55:51,633 --> 01:55:53,665
and became hard.

2354
01:55:53,667 --> 01:55:58,132
Obsessed with winning,
addicted to power,

2355
01:55:58,134 --> 01:56:00,865
totally contemptuous
of ideals.

2356
01:56:00,867 --> 01:56:04,366
This phony
"man of the people."

2357
01:56:04,368 --> 01:56:08,932
When someone isn't seen
for what they truly are,

2358
01:56:08,934 --> 01:56:10,934
that's a very dangerous thing.

2359
01:56:12,667 --> 01:56:14,165
Nobody else knows who she is?

2360
01:56:14,167 --> 01:56:16,432
- Not even Horowitz.
- Why not tell her?

2361
01:56:16,434 --> 01:56:17,965
'Cause she would have used it.

2362
01:56:17,967 --> 01:56:21,099
She would've used it
to good effect, but... [sighs]

2363
01:56:21,101 --> 01:56:23,667
that would have
destroyed Laura totally.

2364
01:56:24,401 --> 01:56:25,832
[sighs]

2365
01:56:25,834 --> 01:56:30,134
Satisfaction won't unburden
a tortured heart.

2366
01:56:31,434 --> 01:56:32,633
So...

2367
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:35,001
I can hold it.

2368
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:37,500
So can you.

2369
01:56:38,934 --> 01:56:39,934
Please.

2370
01:56:41,368 --> 01:56:42,567
Yeah.

2371
01:56:50,667 --> 01:56:53,034
It's all in a locker
in Penn Station.

2372
01:56:54,334 --> 01:56:56,698
If anything happens to me,
you send that

2373
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,798
- to Jacob Gleason at the <i>Post.</i>
- The <i>Post?</i>

2374
01:56:58,800 --> 01:56:59,999
He'll know what to do with it.

2375
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:01,631
The <i>Post</i> is a rag.

2376
01:57:01,633 --> 01:57:04,067
Yeah, but the <i>Times</i> is in
your brother's pocket, too.

2377
01:57:05,967 --> 01:57:08,201
I gotta get her out of town
before that vote.

[train passing overhead]

2379
01:57:16,401 --> 01:57:18,332
- [gasps]
- Oh!

2380
01:57:18,334 --> 01:57:19,565
[sighs]

2381
01:57:19,567 --> 01:57:21,165
What are you doin' here, Tony?

2382
01:57:21,167 --> 01:57:22,934
Watchin' your back.

2383
01:57:24,101 --> 01:57:25,165
Come on.

2384
01:57:25,167 --> 01:57:27,067
What do you say
we go get a drink?

2385
01:57:28,267 --> 01:57:29,665
If!
Sorry.

2386
01:57:29,667 --> 01:57:30,932
[Tony] How's the eye?

2387
01:57:30,934 --> 01:57:32,665
Gonna hurt for a while.

2388
01:57:32,667 --> 01:57:34,466
How long you been
following me?

2389
01:57:34,468 --> 01:57:36,032
I wasn't.

2390
01:57:36,034 --> 01:57:37,299
They put me on his building,
and I seen you come up.

2391
01:57:37,301 --> 01:57:38,765
"They"?

2392
01:57:38,767 --> 01:57:40,399
Yeah, let's not bullshit
each other, Lionel, okay?

2393
01:57:40,401 --> 01:57:41,665
You been talkin' to 'em, too.

2394
01:57:41,667 --> 01:57:43,631
Yeah, not workin' for 'em.

2395
01:57:43,633 --> 01:57:44,865
I was gonna tell ya.

2396
01:57:44,867 --> 01:57:46,399
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2397
01:57:46,401 --> 01:57:48,232
Okay.

2398
01:57:48,234 --> 01:57:51,498
Was that you outside
the club that night?

2399
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:53,665
I thought I saw
someone in the alley

2400
01:57:53,667 --> 01:57:54,965
when the owner of that place

2401
01:57:54,967 --> 01:57:55,999
was roughin' me up,
makin' threats.

2402
01:57:56,001 --> 01:57:57,265
Did you tell 'em about that?

2403
01:57:57,267 --> 01:57:58,999
They just pay me to keep tabs.

2404
01:57:59,001 --> 01:58:00,432
So, that's what I did.
I keep tabs.

2405
01:58:00,434 --> 01:58:02,299
- What we do, we keep tabs.
- If! If!

2406
01:58:02,301 --> 01:58:05,332
T, he was bluffing.

2407
01:58:05,334 --> 01:58:07,099
He didn't even have it,
and they killed him for it.

2408
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:08,932
But why try
to figure it out, right?

2409
01:58:08,934 --> 01:58:10,965
- You're just movin' up.
- All right.

2410
01:58:10,967 --> 01:58:12,531
Sell it and tell it,
letter man!

2411
01:58:12,533 --> 01:58:13,598
- Take it easy.
- Tell it and sell it!

2412
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:15,032
Take it easy. Have a drink.

2413
01:58:15,034 --> 01:58:16,865
Bring me a whiskey up.
What are you drinkin'?

2414
01:58:16,867 --> 01:58:18,265
- I'll have a tea.
- A tea?

2415
01:58:18,267 --> 01:58:20,232
Very hot water
with the teabag on the side.

2416
01:58:20,234 --> 01:58:22,865
And milk and sugar
on the side. Very hot, okay?

2417
01:58:22,867 --> 01:58:24,565
Hot tits on my milky tea face!

2418
01:58:24,567 --> 01:58:26,498
- Don't pay him no mind, doll.
- Sugar tits on my milk face!

2419
01:58:26,500 --> 01:58:27,832
Something wrong with his head.

2420
01:58:27,834 --> 01:58:29,898
[waitress] Mmm-hmm.

2421
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:31,132
There's nothin' wrong
with my head.

2422
01:58:31,134 --> 01:58:32,900
Well, you could have
fooled me.

2423
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,234
How long you been
fucking Julia?

2424
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,067
After all the things
he did for you...

2425
01:58:41,334 --> 01:58:43,165
you couldn't go find
someone else to bang?

2426
01:58:43,167 --> 01:58:46,767
Everybody gotta find their
own way in this world, Lionel.

2427
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:49,199
What, you think
I was just gonna

2428
01:58:49,201 --> 01:58:52,498
stay in Frank's shadow
all my life? [scoffs]

2429
01:58:52,500 --> 01:58:55,067
Okay for you, not for me.

2430
01:59:04,267 --> 01:59:05,267
[waitress] Careful.

2431
01:59:09,334 --> 01:59:10,631
[Tony sighs]

2432
01:59:10,633 --> 01:59:11,898
Come on, can we just have
a real drink here?

2433
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:13,432
I don't wanna have a drink.

2434
01:59:13,434 --> 01:59:15,165
Well, what's the big fuckin'
deal, Lionel? He's gone.

2435
01:59:15,167 --> 01:59:17,965
Okay? There's nothin'
we can do about it.

2436
01:59:17,967 --> 01:59:19,598
We help 'em
get what they want,

2437
01:59:19,600 --> 01:59:21,631
and we get on a new ride.

2438
01:59:21,633 --> 01:59:23,734
An easier ride, maybe?

2439
01:59:25,001 --> 01:59:26,631
What, after all
we've been through,

2440
01:59:26,633 --> 01:59:28,565
after all we had to do
to fuckin' survive

2441
01:59:28,567 --> 01:59:29,865
just growin' up?

2442
01:59:29,867 --> 01:59:32,399
Come on.
We're due an easy gig.

2443
01:59:32,401 --> 01:59:33,865
You, especially.

2444
01:59:33,867 --> 01:59:36,631
Come on,
I know you got a real talent.

2445
01:59:36,633 --> 01:59:38,432
I'll make sure
there's a place for you.

2446
01:59:38,434 --> 01:59:40,667
Be real partners.

2447
01:59:44,301 --> 01:59:46,832
Let's talk about it
after tomorrow, all right?

2448
01:59:46,834 --> 01:59:48,165
I got somethin'
I gotta take care of.

2449
01:59:48,167 --> 01:59:50,165
Don't go up to Harlem tonight,
Freakshow.

2450
01:59:50,167 --> 01:59:51,698
Stay out of it.

2451
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:54,232
- What?
- Just don't do it.

2452
01:59:54,234 --> 01:59:57,134
See, I'm not so far out
of the loop as you think.

2453
01:59:57,967 --> 01:59:59,498
We're closin' it up tonight.

2454
01:59:59,500 --> 02:00:02,232
- No, no. Okay, listen to me.
- Just don't get involved.

2455
02:00:02,234 --> 02:00:03,965
I found what they're lookin'
for, all right? I got it!

2456
02:00:03,967 --> 02:00:05,399
- It's the last loose end.
- No, no, no,

2457
02:00:05,401 --> 02:00:07,299
you gotta call 'em, you gotta
call 'em right now

2458
02:00:07,301 --> 02:00:08,366
- and tell 'em to call it off.
- It's already out of my hands.

2459
02:00:08,368 --> 02:00:09,466
Tony, I've got it.

2460
02:00:09,468 --> 02:00:11,032
Come on,
let's just have a drink.

2461
02:00:11,034 --> 02:00:12,432
[yells] Fuck!

2462
02:00:12,434 --> 02:00:13,800
[Tony grunting]

2463
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,565
You son of a bitch!

2464
02:00:26,567 --> 02:00:28,567
I tried to help you.

- Come on!
- [Betty] <i>Committee on Housing.</i>

2468
02:00:52,867 --> 02:00:54,165
Can I speak to Laura Rose,
please?

2469
02:00:54,167 --> 02:00:55,432
<i>I'm sorry,
she's gone for the day.</i>

2470
02:00:55,434 --> 02:00:56,898
- What?
- <i>She went home.</i>

2471
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:58,165
- <i>She wasn't feeling well.</i>
- Where'd she go?

2472
02:00:58,167 --> 02:00:59,531
- When?
- <i>I'm sorry, who is this?</i>

2473

Take me to Harlem! Step on it!
I got money!

No, no, come on, run it,

Yeah, up St. Nic's,
up St. Nic's.

If!

She doesn't know!
She doesn't know.

2521
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:23,299
Makes no difference
one way or the other.

2522
02:05:23,301 --> 02:05:25,631
But I found what he's
looking for. Just tell him.

2523
02:05:25,633 --> 02:05:26,865
Tell him I got it.

2524
02:05:26,867 --> 02:05:29,034
No, no, no.
That offer expired.

2525
02:05:30,101 --> 02:05:32,734
And they told me
you were smart.

2526
02:05:35,067 --> 02:05:36,500
Motherfucker.

2527
02:05:37,234 --> 02:05:38,466

2530
02:05:46,734 --> 02:05:48,631
No, I want to see him alone.

2531
02:05:48,633 --> 02:05:51,132
Yes, right now.

2532
02:05:51,134 --> 02:05:53,099
Let me tell you something.
You try anything funny,

2533
02:05:53,101 --> 02:05:54,531
and tomorrow's gonna be
the worst day

2534
02:05:54,533 --> 02:05:55,598
that you've had
in a long time,

2535
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:56,834
you understand?

2536
02:05:58,633 --> 02:05:59,900
[receiver clicks]

2537
02:06:06,934 --> 02:06:08,567
Do you know where that is?

2538
02:06:10,034 --> 02:06:11,165
I heard of it.

2539
02:06:11,167 --> 02:06:13,600
Think you can get her
out there tonight?

2540
02:06:15,434 --> 02:06:18,134
I always did enjoy
a night drive.

2541
02:06:24,834 --> 02:06:26,700
[Lionel]
Go with them, okay?

2542
02:06:27,334 --> 02:06:29,265
You'll be safe.

2543
02:06:29,267 --> 02:06:30,800
I'll come in the morning.

2544
02:06:32,468 --> 02:06:35,399
What don't I know?

2545
02:06:35,401 --> 02:06:37,965
[Lionel] <i>It wasn't the story
she wanted to hear.</i>

2546
02:06:37,967 --> 02:06:39,732
<i>No good was gonna
come from tellin' it,</i>

2547
02:06:39,734 --> 02:06:41,898
<i>so I wanted to say,
"It doesn't matter.</i>

2548
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:43,832
<i>It's got nothin'
to do with you."</i>

2549
02:06:43,834 --> 02:06:45,732
<i>But there's no upside
in lyin' to a woman</i>

2550
02:06:45,734 --> 02:06:47,399
<i>who's smarter than you,</i>

2551
02:06:47,401 --> 02:06:48,700
<i>so, I told her the truth.</i>

2552
02:06:49,934 --> 02:06:51,498
<i>Frank told me once,</i>

2553
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,132
<i>if you're up against
someone bigger than you,</i>

2554
02:06:53,134 --> 02:06:55,631
<i>someone you can't beat
toe to toe,</i>

2555
02:06:55,633 --> 02:06:57,399
<i>make 'em think
you respect their size</i>

2556
02:06:57,401 --> 02:07:00,265
<i>and then cut a deal that lets
you walk out in one piece.</i>

2557
02:07:00,267 --> 02:07:02,232
<i>Then figure out a way
to stick it to 'em later</i>

2558
02:07:02,234 --> 02:07:04,700
<i>without leaving
your prints on the knife.</i>

2559
02:07:05,900 --> 02:07:07,299
<i>Even walkin' in there,</i>

2560
02:07:07,301 --> 02:07:09,099
<i>I wasn't exactly sure
how to play it.</i>

2561
02:07:09,101 --> 02:07:11,265
<i>I was just hoping,
in all that steam,</i>

2562
02:07:11,267 --> 02:07:12,700
<i>he wouldn't see me sweat.</i>

2563
02:07:18,767 --> 02:07:20,500
If! [echoing]

2564
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:30,065
Who's the fucking boss now,
Bailey?

2565
02:07:30,067 --> 02:07:31,633
Who's the boss?

2566
02:07:32,401 --> 02:07:33,932
So, what is it with you?

2567
02:07:33,934 --> 02:07:35,299
I told you I can't control it.

2568
02:07:35,301 --> 02:07:36,965
Didn't your goons
fuckin' fill you in already?

2569
02:07:36,967 --> 02:07:38,765
I don't care
about your fuckin' affliction.

2570
02:07:38,767 --> 02:07:39,898
What's your angle with this?

2571
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,665
What do you want
for that file?

2572
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:43,265
I wanna hear your side
of what's in it.

2573
02:07:43,267 --> 02:07:44,865
Why?

2574
02:07:44,867 --> 02:07:46,999
Let's just say an unfinished
puzzle makes my head hurt.

2575
02:07:47,001 --> 02:07:48,698
All right?
More than most people.

2576
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:50,065
I smooth it out for
your pain-in-the-ass brain,

2577
02:07:50,067 --> 02:07:51,798
we're puttin' this
to bed tonight?

2578
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:53,700
Yeah, it's your best shot.

2579
02:08:00,567 --> 02:08:01,834
[Moses inhales sharply]

2580
02:08:03,167 --> 02:08:04,932
I was young.

2581
02:08:04,934 --> 02:08:06,531
I was the
"get things done" man

2582
02:08:06,533 --> 02:08:09,232
for the greatest governor
in the history of this state.

2583
02:08:09,234 --> 02:08:10,865
We had a party.

2584
02:08:10,867 --> 02:08:12,498
It was the good times,
before the Crash.

2585
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:15,698
The Tammany parties were like
nothing before or since.

2586
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:18,500
We had a whole fuckin' hotel.

2587
02:08:19,468 --> 02:08:20,531
[sighs]

2588
02:08:20,533 --> 02:08:22,134
I saw her there, working.

2589
02:08:23,334 --> 02:08:24,533
She was...

2590
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:30,099
I'd never felt lust
like that before.

2591
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:31,765
Twenty-five years later,
I think about her,

2592
02:08:31,767 --> 02:08:34,798
it still makes my blood move.

2593
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:38,099
I followed her
into a service hallway.

2594
02:08:38,101 --> 02:08:39,565
She knew I had.

2595
02:08:39,567 --> 02:08:40,999
She looked back.

2596
02:08:41,001 --> 02:08:44,132
She went into a supply room.
I went in.

2597
02:08:44,134 --> 02:08:46,900
I took her
against the spare towels.

2598
02:08:48,167 --> 02:08:49,267
You raped her.

2599
02:08:51,034 --> 02:08:52,765
I moved on her
that first time,

2600
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:55,965
but I treated her well,
bought her things.

2601
02:08:55,967 --> 02:08:57,898
Saw to it that the Party
used that hotel

2602
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:00,065
lots for a few years.

2603
02:09:00,067 --> 02:09:01,999
She could have disappeared
any time,

2604
02:09:02,001 --> 02:09:03,900
stopped working there,
but she didn't.

2605
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:09,698
She was shy, but she knew
how things worked,

2606
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,965
and she was always grateful.

2607
02:09:10,967 --> 02:09:12,399
Rape?

2608
02:09:12,401 --> 02:09:17,332
Do you have the first inkling
how power works?

2609
02:09:17,334 --> 02:09:19,798
Power is feeling, knowing,

2610
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:21,199
that you can do
whatever you want,

2611
02:09:21,201 --> 02:09:24,099
and not one fuckin' person
can stop you.

2612
02:09:24,101 --> 02:09:26,898
And if someone else has a dumb
idea that you don't like,

2613
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:28,565
well, that's the end
of that idea,

2614
02:09:28,567 --> 02:09:31,565
or the end of that person,
if you want.

2615
02:09:31,567 --> 02:09:33,132
And if I wanna build highways

2616
02:09:33,134 --> 02:09:34,765
while the rest of the country
is broke,

2617
02:09:34,767 --> 02:09:37,732
I'll punch through
any damn neighborhood I want.

2618
02:09:37,734 --> 02:09:39,232
If some Negro slum

2619
02:09:39,234 --> 02:09:41,765
is where I'm going to put
my federal project,

2620
02:09:41,767 --> 02:09:43,332
or the off ramp of my bridge,

2621
02:09:43,334 --> 02:09:45,631
well, the goodie-goods can
shriek and moan all day long.

2622
02:09:45,633 --> 02:09:47,598
And if some chump
wants to blackjack me,

2623
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,265
threatening to move
our baseball team,

2624
02:09:49,267 --> 02:09:51,165
well, buddy,
the Dodgers can take it

2625
02:09:51,167 --> 02:09:52,898
on the arches
to the fucking coast.

2626
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:55,598
I'll find another team
that will play ball with me

2627
02:09:55,600 --> 02:09:57,865
in my stadium.

2628
02:09:57,867 --> 02:09:59,732
And if I want to fuck
some colored girl

2629
02:09:59,734 --> 02:10:01,132
in a hotel room now and then,

2630
02:10:01,134 --> 02:10:03,299
because I'm feeling
like a wrecking ball,

2631
02:10:03,301 --> 02:10:05,167
then, pal, I'm gonna do it.

2632
02:10:06,967 --> 02:10:09,132
And if you think
I'm gonna let some

2633
02:10:09,134 --> 02:10:11,798
chip who never should have
been born,

2634
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:14,865
or your small-time boss,
or my brother with his ideals

2635
02:10:14,867 --> 02:10:16,965
and his forgeries in my name

2636
02:10:16,967 --> 02:10:19,965
slow down the work
I'm getting done in this city,

2637
02:10:19,967 --> 02:10:23,165
then you've got a lot to learn
about how power works.

2638
02:10:23,167 --> 02:10:25,565
Because those people
are invisible.

2639
02:10:25,567 --> 02:10:26,767
They don't exist.
[snaps fingers]

2640
02:10:28,334 --> 02:10:31,667
See if you feel that way
tomorrow after your big vote.

2641
02:10:37,301 --> 02:10:38,533
She know?

2642
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:42,867
Huh.

2643
02:10:43,633 --> 02:10:44,865
Interesting.

2644
02:10:44,867 --> 02:10:47,265
So, it's you and Paul?

2645
02:10:47,267 --> 02:10:48,665
Well, I know what he wants.

2646
02:10:48,667 --> 02:10:50,032
If he had any balls,
he would have used it

2647
02:10:50,034 --> 02:10:51,565
before to box me in
and take it from me,

2648
02:10:51,567 --> 02:10:53,199
which I would have respected,
actually,

2649
02:10:53,201 --> 02:10:55,765
but he thinks the way
that you do things matter,

2650
02:10:55,767 --> 02:10:57,800
which is why
he'll never be anybody.

2651
02:11:00,301 --> 02:11:02,366
You an idealist, too?

2652
02:11:02,368 --> 02:11:06,598
You wanna trade that file to
save the block you grew up on?

2653
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:09,898
Make me move my lines for some
committee of childless women,

2654
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:12,765
howling about
their Negro adoptees?

2655
02:11:12,767 --> 02:11:15,631
Or are you just another
blackmailing gumshoe

2656
02:11:15,633 --> 02:11:17,500
who wants to transact with me?

2657
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:19,732
Come on, name it!

2658
02:11:19,734 --> 02:11:21,667
Name it, claim it, shame it!

2659
02:11:23,533 --> 02:11:24,734
[scoffs]

2660
02:11:25,567 --> 02:11:27,898
That gumshoe was my friend,

2661
02:11:27,900 --> 02:11:30,734
and the girl's the only reason
you're still breathin'.

2662
02:11:32,468 --> 02:11:34,199
Do whatever you want
to this city,

2663
02:11:34,201 --> 02:11:36,232
go build your pyramids
on the Nile,

2664
02:11:36,234 --> 02:11:38,432
just leave her alone.

2665
02:11:38,434 --> 02:11:40,834
Anything happens to her,
I mail it.

2666
02:11:41,533 --> 02:11:42,999
That's it.

2667
02:11:43,001 --> 02:11:44,633
That's all of it.

2668
02:11:50,234 --> 02:11:51,765
Let me make something clear.

2669
02:11:51,767 --> 02:11:54,165
If you or my brother messes
with what I intend to do,

2670
02:11:54,167 --> 02:11:57,665
I'll make her life worse
than I've already made his.

2671
02:11:57,667 --> 02:11:59,700
You tell him I said that.

2672
02:12:05,468 --> 02:12:07,500
Well, I guess we got a deal,
then.

2673
02:12:08,734 --> 02:12:10,667
So, I'll give you one
for free.

2674
02:12:12,301 --> 02:12:13,531
Your man, Lieberman,

2675
02:12:13,533 --> 02:12:15,500
is gonna cause you
some problems.

2676
02:12:17,167 --> 02:12:18,698
How so?

2677
02:12:18,700 --> 02:12:20,498
He owns a piece
of half the companies

2678
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,299
doin' contracts
with slum clearance.

2679
02:12:22,301 --> 02:12:25,299
I'm guessin' he hasn't
told you about that.

2680
02:12:25,301 --> 02:12:26,932
So, when you handle him,

2681
02:12:26,934 --> 02:12:30,332
tell him I told you,
and that's for Frank.

2682
02:12:30,334 --> 02:12:31,867
Son of a bitch.

2683
02:12:37,567 --> 02:12:40,865
You come off weird,
but you're smart.

2684
02:12:40,867 --> 02:12:43,865
You should have
taken my offer.

2685
02:12:43,867 --> 02:12:46,967
Could have made them all get
on their knees and apologize.

2686
02:12:48,201 --> 02:12:49,765
But if she's anything
like her mother,

2687
02:12:49,767 --> 02:12:51,500
I understand the pull.

2688
02:12:54,101 --> 02:12:55,234
Right.

2689
02:12:56,334 --> 02:12:57,767
One more thing.

2690
02:12:59,101 --> 02:13:01,132
Tell my brother
I read his masterwork.

2691
02:13:01,134 --> 02:13:03,165
It's as brilliant
as everyone says.

2692
02:13:03,167 --> 02:13:04,765
Nobody could have
done it better,

2693
02:13:04,767 --> 02:13:06,132
and it's good for everyone,
including me.

2694
02:13:06,134 --> 02:13:08,999
There's not a reason
in the world to deny it.

2695
02:13:09,001 --> 02:13:11,134
Tell him I'll give him
my thoughts in the morning.

2696
02:13:14,234 --> 02:13:15,234
If!

2697
02:13:20,267 --> 02:13:21,633
[door closes]

2698

[Lionel] <i>Growin' up, I always
thought Frank was a hero.</i>

2702
02:14:32,867 --> 02:14:35,332
<i>But he was no crusader
in the end.</i>

2703
02:14:35,334 --> 02:14:37,498
<i>He was just a gumshoe
tryin' to make a buck</i>

2704

<i>like everyone else.</i>

2705
02:14:39,034 --> 02:14:41,199
<i>But he didn't have
to go to that war.</i>

2706
02:14:41,201 --> 02:14:42,999
<i>He was old enough to
have skipped it,</i>

2707
02:14:43,001 --> 02:14:44,565
<i>and he went, anyway,
'cause he actually thought</i>

2708
02:14:44,567 --> 02:14:45,934
<i>this country
was worth fighting for.</i>

2709
02:14:47,368 --> 02:14:49,432
<i>I never had anything

<i>There was a story
she wanted told</i>

2712
02:14:54,334 --> 02:14:55,999
<i>and I figured it was time</i>

2713
02:14:56,001 --> 02:14:58,399
<i>to get off my ass
and pick a side.</i>

2714
02:14:58,401 --> 02:15:00,732
Hey, Gleason, for you.

2715
02:15:00,734 --> 02:15:02,132
<i>Hey, pal,
I'm new to this beat.</i>

2716
02:15:02,134 --> 02:15:03,466
<i>What's the story here?</i>

2717
02:15:03,468 --> 02:15:05,332
[Gleason] <i>Stories of injustice
and despair,</i>

2718
02:15:05,334 --> 02:15:06,732

Are you crazy?
It's freezin' out.

2722

[ship horn blows in distance]

02:16:09,734 --> 02:16:11,533
What is this place?

[clicks tongue]

2726
02:16:14,334 --> 02:16:15,800
It was Frank's.

2727
02:16:19,633 --> 02:16:21,633
And looks like it's mine now.

2728
02:16:33,267 --> 02:16:36,001
Still lookin' out for you,
after all.

2729
02:16:40,633 --> 02:16:42,900
Funny how things turn out.

2730
02:16:45,234 --> 02:16:46,234
Yeah.

"Brooklyn's big...

Brooklyn's big, but there's
things even bigger."

What's that?

2734
02:16:59,867 --> 02:17:02,698
I think it's something
