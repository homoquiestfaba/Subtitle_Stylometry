This is Sienna.

183
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,822
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

184
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,086
Look at that punk.

185
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,127
He's such a punk.

186
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,719
He doesn't even like playing darts.

187
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,696
Don't get bent just 'cause
you ain't got no game.

188
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,732
I got game.

189
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,925
I got game.

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,231
Hey, guys.

191
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,703
What have you got, another pitcher?

192
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:53,739
Oh, this one's done.

193
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,171
I'll go get another.

194
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,606
Excuse me.

195
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:58,871
I want the good stuff, huh?

196
00:07:58,945 --> 00:07:59,934
Here you go.

197
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,149
Yo, when you gonna
get rid of that jacket, Bob?

198
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,276
You ain't Terry Bradshaw.

199
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,786
No, the glory days are over.

200
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,947
At least I had glory days.

201
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,989
Ooh.

202
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,388
Yo, he just beat me to the punch.

203
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:13,891
Bitch of it is;
I saw them first.

204
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,160
Yo, yo, what did you talk about?

205
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,392
What you talk about?

206
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,433
Not a whole lot.

207
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,196
Well, the pigtail's kind of tough.

208
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,260
Someone probably nailed her
in the ass when she was 12

209
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,464
and fucked up her head.

210
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,531
Like what happened to Eddie
on that camping trip?

211
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,907
Whatever, moron.

212
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,978
Hey, Bobby, you got that
pitcher coming?

213
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,019
Oh, man, I got to go.

214
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,247
Kimberly's due back.

215
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,288
Hurry back.

216
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,324
We're gonna play
hide the kielbasa with Eddie later.

217
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,551
Bring your sleeping bag.

220
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,041
What's up, player?

221
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,043
Got another smoke?

222
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,079
Uh, yeah, man.

223
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:45,106
Yeah.

224
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,583
Yeah.

225
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,415
Sure appreciate it, my man.

226
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,684
I forgot to go to the store
and buy a pack before it close.

227
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,818
You know?

228
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,728
I like them shoes too.

229
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,291
They clean.

230
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,100
Yeah.

231
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,370
I like 'em.

232
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,176
And right there I got the idea.

233
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,508
Shit, yeah, here he goes again.

234
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,105
Hold up, y'all.

235
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,173
I've been giving this a lot of thought.

236
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,014
Those hookers last night...

237
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,577
seriously.

238
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,284
Here are girls who live
in a shitty-ass apartment

239
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,794
and smoke crack all day, right?

240
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,989
That is a business opportunity
waiting to happen, y'all.

241
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,090
Yo, you okay with him pimping
out your new girlfriends?

242
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,464
[Laughter]

243
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,968
Shut up.

244
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,165
Yo, they're gold mines
waiting to be discovered.

245
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,370
Your average hooker for hire
is doing what,

246
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,536
like, two, three dudes a night?

247
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,672
You know those hos
do more guys than that.

248
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:24,909
All right, all right.

249
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,110
Make a point here.

250
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,550
Let's say three.

251
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,589
They're charging something like
$200 an hour.

252
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,783
Now, granted, guys don't keep them
for more than an hour.

253
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,383
But that right there?

254
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,428
That's $600 a night.

255
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,362
Yo, there's no way those two girls
are making six bones a night.

256
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,866
Exactly my motherfucking point,

257
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,767
'cause I'm not talking about
your average back-alley ho.

258
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,500

Now check this.

262
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:57,377
$200, $600 times seven days a week...

263
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,544
Do these chicks get off on each other?

264
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,883
Oh, I never make it this far.

265
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:05,446
Equals $4,200 a week, a week y'all.

equals $16,800.

269
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:16,201
That's almost $17,000 a month,
y'all, per girl.

270
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,395
Per girl, y'all.

271
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,699
What if they want a day off?

272
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,739
Fuck that.

273
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,535

doing drugs, do they?

00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,473
Hey.

276
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,845
You're not even paying attention.

277
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:35,580
Are you suggesting
that we become pimps?

278
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,646
I would rather not use the term "pimp,"

279
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,954
rather the term "investors,"

it's gonna take a little seed capital

281

new clothes and stuff,

291

You're talking about prostitution here.

we're gonna be 30.

to show for that?

at the end of this

poker games, and marijuana.

Huh?

338
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,543
The decision to start
our new business was unanimous.

339
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,050
Well, almost unanimous.

340
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,345
Are you kidding?

341
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,852
No, no.

342
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,387
You know, I wouldn't get it otherwise.

343
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,547
Look, you can do your thing.

344
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,647
It's just not for me.

345
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,691
What do you mean, man?

346
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,385
Because it's not right.

347
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,122
I mean, it's exploiting someone
who is down on their luck.

348
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,163
Oh, come on, Eddie.

349
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,596
Look, I want to go back to school and...

Eddie, come on, man.

353
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,571
That's the whole thing.

354
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,940
You ain't gonna have to go
to school, baby boy.

355
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,538
Yeah, but I want to go to school.

Okay, so instead
of making fat cash now

and enjoying your life,

360
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,391

yourself through school?

That makes a lot of sense, Eddie.

362
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,666
I dig that.

363
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,701
I'm gonna go to school.

364
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,463
All right, look.

365
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,730
You do you.

366
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:46,771
Okay?

367
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,067
Come on, man.

368
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,107
It's like that?

369
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,506
It's like that.

370
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:59,575
And with that, Kevin, Darick, Chris,
and myself made a pact to become...

371
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,779
well, lack for a better word, pimps.

[singing]

377
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,121
So that's your business idea?

378
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,514
Well, yeah.

379
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,426
It does sound like a pretty good idea.

380
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,895
We're fine.

381
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,931
We don't need a pimp.

382
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,493
We never have, never will.

00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,071
You do know that we are not
criticizing what y'all do.

385
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,708
I love what y'all do.

386
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:06,944
Most definitely.

387
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,921
It's just the way in which you do it,

388
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,483
it could be better for you, for you.

389
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,833
I think that we can agree that jumping
in cars with random scumbags

390
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,890
just ain't safe, right?

391
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,231
Okay, that's it; thanks, guys.

392
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,296
We're willing to spend money.

393
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,705
Yeah, we're all gonna chip in here.

394
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,743

395
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,869
$200 a piece.

396
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,811
Or more, you know,

397
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,712
probably more.

398
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,480
Girls, we're willing to do
whatever it takes to make this happen.

399
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,147
Okay?

00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,748
Just talk to us.

401
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,123
You must have been smoking crack.

402
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,389
A cut of the business
and buy their drugs?

403
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,794
Who's the lamb that's gonna do that?

404
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,059
'Cause I know it ain't gonna be me.

00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,134
I can't relax.

407
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,566
That wasn't part of the plan, man.

408
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,400

Why don't you use
your cell phone, man?

414
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,677
Why don't we use yours

415
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:14,082

trace it to you, you jagoff.

Well, Nate, we don't...

We don't.

00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:14,598
that we're gonna be needing,
like, a fairly large quantity of product

figure it should matter

Okay, Brian.

478
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,315
Let me tell you something.

479
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,088
You best start caring where
the stuff comes from.

And I don't run
that kind of program.

My supplier knows
the intricacies of my business,

484
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,567
and I know the intricacies
of those I do business with.

485
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,201
Without that,
we ain't got shit to talk about.

Wait a minute.

499
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,378
y'all are pimping hos.

501
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,595
That's what you said.

502
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,563
You white motherfuckers
are pimping bitches?

503
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:55,933

508
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,647
What?

509
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,944
I am, right?

511
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,287
Oh, damn.

512
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:17,321
Yo, man.

513
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:18,720
Y'all cool with me.

514
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,883
Come on.

515
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,672
Y'all make yourself at home, pimps.

516
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,775
Yeah, I remember back in the day,
I was a pimp.

517
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:46,511
[Chuckles]

518
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,986
See, the pimp game,
that's about getting the bitch

519
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:56,585
to sell that ass and give you money,
not half of it, not <i>3l4</i> of it, all of it.

520
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,960
But in your case,
you're in partnership

521
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,864
with the bitches' first love,
which is crack cocaine.

522
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,926
So you take on those bitches,
you take on their habits.

523
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,562
It could be costly.

524
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,267
How much shit you talking?

525
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,537
That's where we're running
into a little confusion, man.

526
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,045
You know, we...

527
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:19,675
we don't know how much
that translates to on your end,

528
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,979
but the girls are saying...

529
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,451
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

530
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:27,458
First off, any female
who suck dick for a living,

531
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,324
she ain't no girl.

532
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,455
My wife's a girl, a lady.

533
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,090
Them hos you get?

534
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,793
They bitches.

535
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,460
All right.

536
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,765
The bitches.

537
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:40,805
There you go.

538
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,340
Now all y'all say it.

539
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,739
All: The bitches.

00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,776

Well, the bitches say they're
smoking about 20 rocks a day.

544
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:53,842
I don't know what that...

545
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,717
They're probably buying $10 rocks.

546
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,755
That's $200 a day.

547
00:25:57,822 --> 00:25:59,517
Multiply by two bitches.

548
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,717
They're your bottom bitches.

549
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,884
You're gonna get more bitches.

550
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,927
Shit, man.

551
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,928
You talking about a sizeable
amount of stuff,

552
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:09,524
especially if you talk about
buying month to month.

553
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:10,898
Like how much?

554
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,905
Mm, somewhere
in the neighborhood of 15 Gs.

555
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:21,406
Well, you know, we were wondering if,

556
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,880
you know,
we could get a volume discount.

557
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,009
[Laughs]

558
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,052
What?

559
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,880
A volume discount.

560
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:36,223
A volume discount?

561
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:40,822
What the fuck is a volume discount?

562
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,096
Do I look like
a motherfucking flea market?

563
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,228
No.

564
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,795
No, I don't give out no discounts.

565
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:49,965
My prices are fixed.

566
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,532
What you pay for a gram last week,
you pay this week.

567
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,578
I don't fluctuate.

568
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,081
And I sure as hell don't give
out no motherfucking discounts.

569
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,783
Sorry.

570
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,811
[Sighs]

571
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,347
I tell you what.

572
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:12,624
Look, I ain't got no time to be making
no extra group of rocks for your hos.

573
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,597
Y'all got to do that yourselves.

574
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,134
So you give me 15 Gs...
no, fuck that.

575
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:20,395
Give me 12 Gs.

576
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,963
I'll go to my supplier, get a kilo.

577
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,702
You let me cut it up.

578
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,971
I take four ounces off the top for myself.

579
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,138
We call it even.

580
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,512
All right, well, we're not
gonna have that kind of cash

581
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,147
right off the bat.

582
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,555
It's all still new to us, man.

583
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:44,061
So we're gonna have to be
buying smaller amounts

584
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:47,292
till we get things rolling.

585
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:50,459
You gonna show us
how to make the rocks?

586
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:55,435
You get your bitches
to give me a volume discount?

587
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,601
We could work something out.

588
00:27:58,677 --> 00:27:59,644
Deal, baby.

589
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,178
Let's go.

590
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,246
Welcome to the lab, fellas.

591
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:11,015
This here, that's a kilo.

592
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,619
Back in the day,

593
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:20,324
I got a bitch going to jail
stuff that up her ass.

594
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,763
Glass broke.

595
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,061
Bitch got high off it.

596
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:24,761
Her ass sucked it up.

597
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,963
Crack ass.

598
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,266
Show you how to make this shit.

599
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:38,982
You got to get <i>2l3</i> cocaine

600
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,249
with <i>1l3</i> baking soda.

601
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,924
Put some water in there.

602
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,757
You let that simmer.

603
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,358
Stir this.

604
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,402
Ah.

605
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,028
You know that aroma?

606
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,072
Just smell it in.

607
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,800
Go ahead, smell it.

608
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:04,466
Yeah.

609
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,511
And Chef Nathaniel creates his famous

610
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:12,107
crack cocaine souffle
with Arm & Hammer seasoning spice.

611
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,878
Ta-da.

612
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,756
And Chef Nate can cook it, can sell it.

613
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:24,384
But most important rule,
don't partake in the product.

614
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:29,399
Makes a motherfucker lose focus
and fuck everything up.

615
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,697
Y'all feel me?

616
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,759
Yeah.

617
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,929
Keep this up.

618
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,973
That's how it's done.

619
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:43,670
Then you chop it up into little pieces,

620
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,943
and you get rocks.

621
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:47,848
See that there?

622
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,546
That sell for 20 bucks

623
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,057
on any street in America.

624
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,785
The American dream.

625
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,989
Mm, small little thing, ain't it?

626
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,657
It's so cute.

627
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,068
Yeah, it was great.

628
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,160
I mean, Bozeman was like,

629
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,204
"Darick, you're late.

630
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,331
Your shift started two hours ago."

631
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,635
I was like, "Hey, my bad, dog.

632
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,039
"You know, I thought I was off.

633
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,069
I just thought I'd come down
and let you eat my ass."

634
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,116
That's my boy.

635
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,122
Hey.

636
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,657
Did I just hear what I think I heard?

637
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,420
Hey, look.

638
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,756
I got it covered, all right?

639
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,694
Yeah, what do you mean,
you got it covered?

640
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,095
I mean, I got a handle on it.

641
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,723
Just relax.

642
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,760
I'm not gonna do anything
to hurt James here.

643
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:53,348
I don't know, Brian.

644
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,980
Chris, don't puss
out on me now, all right?

645
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,683
I need you to do this.

646
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,158
Why can't Darick or Kevin do it?

647
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,321
Because I need you to do it.

648
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,661
The girls can't be alone
right now, all right?

649
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,999
We got to have somebody with them
24 hours, seven days a week.

650
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,800
We got to keep an eye
on our investment, man.

651
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,842
I don't know.

652
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:21,106
Chris, everybody is doing their part,
baby boy.

653
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,306
And this is what I need
you to do, all right,

654
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,848
in order for this to work.

655
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,977
You need to do this.

656
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,645
You're gonna be living
under the same roof

657
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:36,922
with 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week pussy, man.

658
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:41,295
Come on.

659
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,333
All right.

660
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,425
Yes.

661
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,129
You're gonna be rich.

662
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,037
You're gonna be rich.

663
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:00,107
Okay, so there's this documentary.

664
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,742
Yeah, it's about this German director.

665
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,878
Basically they have, you know,

666
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,889
they hired two different actors
for the same scene.

667
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,050
And the first actor is like
this English rock star guy.

668
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,026
And he's like,
"It's pretty cool, right?"

669
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,153
And then it's horrible, obviously.

670
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,720
We're just like,
"Whoa, that's crazy."

671
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:16,358
And then you see, like, all the people
down at the bottom of the bell tower,

672
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,901
and they're all like,
"What the fuck?"

673
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:21,564
[Laughter]

674
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:22,606
It's amazing.

675
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,641
It's my favorite thing.

676
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:24,868
You guys want a beer?

677
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,137
- Yeah.
- I can take one.

678
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,644
Sure.

679
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,420
Get your shit out of my bathroom.

680
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,165
Hi.

681
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,005
Hi.

682
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,216
So what was that in there?

683
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,946
What?

684
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,779
I kind of sense you vibing me
a little bit.

685
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,824
Oh, really?

686
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:17,019
Vibing you?

687
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,928
Maybe you weren't?

688
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,057
Maybe.

689
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:29,167
"Maybe," huh?

690
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,540
What, "maybe" is not good
enough for you?

691
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,011
Yeah, "maybe" is good enough.

692
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,743
Shit, I haven't had a "maybe" in a while.

693
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:46,689
So when was your last "maybe"?

694
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:50,057
It's been a couple months.

695
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,527
What about you?

696
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,120
[Laughs]

697
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,824
When was your last "maybe"?

698
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:58,665
Yesterday.

699
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,574
Did I ruin it for you?

700
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,017
I don't know.

701
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:21,217
Got me thinking.

702
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,988
Thinking about what?

703
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,826
You're a smart girl.

704
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,298
You're cute, cool to hang out with.

705
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,530
I just don't get it.

706
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:40,042
What don't you get?

707
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,740
That you could sell your body
to some scumbag you never even...

708
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,617
Don't fucking touch me.

709
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:51,451
You understand me?

710
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:52,989
You're not my daddy.

711
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,046
I already have one of those.

712
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,094
Believe me.

713
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,309
Hey.

714
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,249
Where's your partner at?

715
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,550
Oh, she's up in the apartment
trying some stuff on.

716
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,112
Right on.

717
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,488
Check it out.

718
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,618
[Laughs]

719
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,492
Now, you see,
that's what I'm talking about.

720
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:35,589
None of these sluts know how
to market themselves.

721
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,930
Look at this shit.

722
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:41,631
"White European female, 25,
alcohol only."

723
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,503
What does that tell you?

724
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,541
Nothing.

725
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:45,735
That doesn't tell you shit.

726
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,677
Look, the key to this business
is marketing.

727
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:51,442
You got to be explicit.

728
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,847
You got to say stuff like, you know,

729
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,545
"Hot blonde likes it up the ass,"

730
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,317
or "Empty your nuts in my mouth."

but I'm fucking serious, okay.

[Glass clinking]

734
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:07,727
That's how you get their attention.

735
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:08,787
All in the marketing.

736
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,163
What's our ad say?

737
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,533
Oh, ours is nice, man.

738
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,298
Homegirl wrote most of it.

739
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:22,005
"Tandem Greek freak

No, no, no.

Yeah, man.

754
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,868
We got, like, ten calls in the last hour.

Well, let's start
calling them back, right?

756
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,205
Schedule in some shit.

00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,177
What am I supposed to say to these guys?

758
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,111
Homey, you ain't got
to say anything, man.

759
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,048
Just ask them what time
they want to party.

760
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,379
All right, give me this.

Yeah.

Yeah, this is the escort service.

766
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,266
Oh, we got two girls;
a blonde and a dirty blonde.

767
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,175
You can have one,
or you can have them both.

768
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,009
Ah, 200 bucks an hour for one
or 300 bucks for the both,

769
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,573
which is, you know, my friend,
it's obviously a better deal.

770
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,213
Okay, just one?

825
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:40,869
Six months into our little business,
things could not have been going better.

826
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:45,905
Early on, I got this idea to offer
the Johns cocaine and weed

827
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:50,511
in addition to the girls,
kind of like a party package.

828
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:57,084
That turned out to be more lucrative
than the girls themselves.

829
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:02,861
For a bunch of half-assed guys like us,
we had a pretty air-tight operation.

830
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,493
Nate grew to be an invaluable resource,

831
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,436
providing us with any quantity
of shit we needed

832
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,337
so long as he got his cut,

833
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,672
four ounces from every kilo
we ordered,

834
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,110
which became almost two keys a week.

835
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,943
That was all Darick's job.

836
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,813
He was in charge of everything
that had to do with cocaine:

837
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:25,379
Buying it, transporting it, cutting it,
making the rocks,

838
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,220
and most importantly,
keeping our girls fed

839
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,783
with their daily needs.

840
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,236
I had Darick move into the girls
apartment just for convenience.

841
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:43,364
Every day, he'd deliver crack
for the girls

842
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,171
along with any other packages
that the Johns

843
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:48,905
might have ordered
for the upcoming night.

844
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,571
It was perfect.

845
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,674
Trick or treat, ladies.

846
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,685
Let's get it going, all right?

847
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:56,913
With the help of Jasper,

848
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,479
who turned out to have
quite the mojo for business,

849
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,925
we recruited three more girls:
Tiara...

850
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,588
Here, Tiara.

851
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,498
Moira, and Sebastian.

852
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:11,933
Here you go, Sienna.

853
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,971
Looking good.

854
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:25,914
And the beautiful thing
was how the transactions took place,

855
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,884
because none of us were dealing
directly with the Johns.

856
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,319
The risk to us was minimal.

857
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:34,152
It was the girls who had
their asses on the line,

858
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:38,218
because they were the ones who
were actually making the transactions.

859
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,594
Drugs for money and sex on top of it.

860
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:46,466
If any of the Johns turned out to be cops,
girls' asses that got busted, not us.

861
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:47,731
[Balls crack]

862
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:51,138
Our only contact with the customers
was through Kevin.

863
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,039
He was in charge
of setting up the dates.

864
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,338
It was ingenious.

865
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,141
The Johns would respond
to the call girl ad

866
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:01,048
by calling Kevin's prepaid cell phone
so it couldn't be traced.

867
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:06,579
Then after one of the girls
has sex with the John, and only then,

868
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,921
will Kevin proposition
the guy next time,

869
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:11,120
ask him if he wanted any blow.

870
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:15,188
Jasper?

871
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,497
No, she's not available right now.

872
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,628
Oh, well, how about this?

873
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,002
How about I send over this
hot little blonde number for half price?

874
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:26,565
How's that sound?

875
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:27,633
Yeah, very.

876
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,147
Very.

877
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,375
Uh-huh, okay.

878
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:33,575
All right.

879
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,516
Yeah, I'll have her at your
doorstep ready to party

880
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,383
in less than an hour.

881
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,149
All right, man.

882
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,190
[Phone ringing]

883
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:42,248
After Kevin got the order
for coke and the girl,

884
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,318
he'd call Chris and give him
the John's address,

885
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,695
tell him what the order was for
along with which girl he wanted.

886
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,859
Not a problem.

887
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:54,098
Chris would then let Darick know
so he could fill the coke order

888
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,160
kind of like a pharmacist

889
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,436
and bring it down to his place
later for delivery.

890
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,773
And just as a precautionary measure,

891
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,974
Darick would then call Kevin back
to confirm the coke order

892
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,311
and the quantity.

893
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:11,082
Not that I didn't trust any of my guys,
but I didn't want to leave any loopholes

894
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:15,524
just in case anybody
got any ideas, you know?

895
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:20,656
As for me, well, I probably had
the best job of them all.

896
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,222
I was quality control
and general manager

897
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,768
of the whole operation.

898
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,336
Every week I would pass out the cash

899
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:36,107
so Darick could buy his coke,
give Chris money for rent and gas,

900
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,048
and gave Jasper funds
for the girls' clothes and makeup.

901
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:43,780
A few bills for Kevin's cell phone

00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,491
They're gonna bring out
the cake in a minute.

1083
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:09,225
I'm gonna be down
in a second, all right?

1084
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,695
Darick.

1085
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,066
Shh.

1086
00:56:32,455 --> 00:56:34,286
Check this shit out, man.

1087
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,324
Boom.

1088
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,359
Oh, man, that it tight.

1089
00:56:36,426 --> 00:56:37,393
You like that?

1090
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,052
That costs more
than your car right there.

1091
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:41,461
That cost more than my life.

1092
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,002
Hey, man.

1093
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,402
Hey, sweetie.

1094
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,074
Yo, here he is.

1095
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,775
All: Happy birthday!

1096
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,111
Kevin, Kevin.

1097
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,151
Where's Darick?

1098
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,185
Where's Eddie?

1099
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,550
Eddie, Eddie.

1100
00:57:04,621 --> 00:57:05,713
How you doing, my man?

1101
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:06,756
I'm good, man.

1102
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:07,790
I'm good.
I'm good.

1103
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:09,916
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Happy birthday, dog.

1104
00:57:09,993 --> 00:57:10,960
Thank you, man.

1105
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:11,994
For sure, for sure.

1106
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,824
Eddie, thanks for coming, man.

1107
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:14,921
Come here.

1108
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:17,159
- Hey, let's get this picture.
- Let's get this picture.

1109
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:18,791
For us.

1110
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:26,776
[Camera shutter clicks]

1111
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,449
[Cheers and applause]

1112
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,160
It's fucking bullshit, Kevin.

1113
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:50,359
What kind of fucking punks do they
think they're dealing with, dude?

1114
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,263
I'm not somebody you fuck with, Kevin.

1115
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:59,775
I did not work this fucking hard
to be disrespected.

1116
00:57:59,843 --> 00:58:02,141
I swear to Christ, man.

1117
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:05,579
Ever since we been coming up,

1118
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,910
the walls have eyes and shit, man.

1119
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,975
I've been seeing strange dudes
around my place.

1120
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:13,621
I don't even feel like this
fucking cell phone is safe, man.

[Sniffing]

1122
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:40,209
Are you gonna wait for me?

1123
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:41,243
Yeah.

1124
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,610
Tiara and Moira are at the hotel
for a couple more hours.

1125
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:45,648
I'm here.

1126
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:46,682
All righty.

1127
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,809
You are so freaking cute.

1128
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:50,853
God, all right.

1129
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,879
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

Open the door.
Open the door.

1146
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,708
Police;
open the door.

1147
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,150
Step out, hands up.

1148
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:39,745
Step out, step out.

1149
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:40,948
Come on out, out.

1150
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:41,990
Out.

1151
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,025
Up against the wall.

1152
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,150
Go over there.

1153
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:50,257
Against the wall, against the wall.

1154
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,425
Put your hands on the wheel!

1155
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:53,435
Put your hands up!

1156

Up, up!

1157

[Phone ringing]

1161
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,615
Hello?

1162
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:18,660
What?

1163
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:19,695
What?

1164
01:03:19,762 --> 01:03:20,751
Hold on, hold on.

1165
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:24,766
Slow down.

1166
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:32,263
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

1167
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:35,310
[Phone beeps]

1168
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:42,911
Hey.

1169
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:44,885
Hey.

1170
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:49,050
So who the hell was this guy?

1171
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,117
Some white-collar computer nerd.

1172
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:54,589
He's used us three times.

1173
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,325
He always asks for Sienna.

1174
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:00,802
This time, well,
I guess he flipped his lid

1175
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,565
and fucking killed her.

1176
01:04:02,638 --> 01:04:04,503
So what's going on with Chris?

1177
01:04:04,574 --> 01:04:06,269
Hey, asshole.

1178
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,640
Did you hear what he just said?

1179
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,941
Some fucking shitbag killed her.

1180
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,310
Sienna is dead.

1181
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,747
Thank you for that, Darick.

1182
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,481
I already heard that part.

1183
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,819
What is it that you want me
to do about that?

1184
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,916
You want me to cry about that?

1185
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:24,960
Is that what you need?

1186
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:26,289
You need me to tear up a little bit?

1187
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,262
Is that what's going on?

1188
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,998
You're losing it, man.

1189
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:36,604
What the fuck is going on with Chris?

1190
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:37,639
You're slipping.

1191
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,334
What the fuck is going on with Chris?

1192
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:52,648
Um, he said they booked him
for possession and intent to distribute.

1193
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,587
They found Sienna's gig bag
in the back of his car

1194
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:55,988
with all her clothes and shit

1195
01:04:56,058 --> 01:05:01,496
and started thinking about charging him
with pimping and pandering as well.

1196
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:06,194
They're holding him without bail, Brian.

1197
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,361
You want to fix this shit,
or should I?

1198
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:14,876
I'll fix it, like I fucking fix
everything, dude.

1199
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:15,911
Okay.

1200
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:18,947
Okay.

1201
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:58,645
My stepbrother, huh?

1202
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,622
That's a good one.

1203
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:05,593
Yeah, well, you know,

1204
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:09,222
I wasn't sure who all could
come see you, so...

1205
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,265
Thanks.

1206
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,358
Yeah.

1207
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,237
So...

1208
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:22,471
what exactly do they know?

1209
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:25,309
About what, you guys?

1210
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,348
Uh-huh.

1211
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:29,384
Nothing.

1212
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:35,146
So you didn't tell them anything?

1213
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,191
Not yet.

1214
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:40,854
Whoa, what do you mean, "not yet"?

1215
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:46,526
Listen, man.

1216
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,070
I'm in serious,
serious trouble here, Brian.

1217
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,767
They got me on possession
of a controlled substance

1218
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,936
and possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute,

1219
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,572
and they're trying to stick me
with pimping and pandering too.

1220
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,216
They know
what I was doing there, man.

1221
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:05,219
I'm lucky if I escape by with just that.

1222
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,982
Even then I'm looking at
mandatory jail time.

1223
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:09,286
And I'm telling you straight out,
I can't go to prison.

1224
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:10,325
I can't even stand it here.

1225
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:11,417
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby boy.

1226
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,519
Nobody said anything about you
going to prison, okay?

1227
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,894
You got me.

1228
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,958
What?

1229
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,868
Brian, there's nothing you can do or say
to get me out of this.

1230
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,837
I'm in fucking jail, man,
on two felonies.

1231
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,466
And I'll probably be charged with
two more before the day is over.

1232
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:27,509
I know.

1233
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:28,736
I know.

1234
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,740
I'm just saying,

1235
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:39,186
you telling them about us ain't gonna
help out your situation any.

1236
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:40,222
That's all I'm saying.

1237
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,314
I mean, just know that.

1238
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,256
I'm not planning
on telling them about you guys.

1239
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,625
I know you wouldn't.

1240
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:50,290
What they want to know is
where I got the cocaine from.

1241
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,931
The attorney they gave me
is trying to work a deal

1242
01:07:57,006 --> 01:07:59,474
with the deputy DA
to drop the charges

1243
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,978
if I tell them who and where
I got the coke from.

1244
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,907
Okay, Chris.

1245
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:07,949
Listen to me, all right?

1246
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,110
Do not let them sucker you in
to that bullshit.

1247
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:13,345
Seriously, man.

1248
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,413
Don't.

1249
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:20,622
If you tell them about Nate,

1250
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:21,788
it'll fuck everything up.

1251
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:23,559
Everything is already fucked up, Brian.

1252
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:24,599
Look at me.

1253
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,828
Look at where I am.

1254
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:27,994
Hey.

1255
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:29,905
Thank you.

1256
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:30,939
Thank you.

1257
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:31,973
Chris, sit down.

1258
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,269
Sit down now.

1259
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,916
Look, it's Sienna, man.

1260
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,551
Don't worry about that right now.

1261
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,682
Now, listen to me.

1262
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,225
Listen to what I am saying to you.

1263
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:54,490
Guys like you don't go to prison
for things like this, Chris.

1264
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,088
It doesn't happen.

1265
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,292
This being your first offense,

1266
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:02,667
you know, overcrowding, baby boy,
they're gonna let you go.

1267
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,172
They're gonna give parole,
send you home,

1268
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:07,141
maybe some community service
or something, okay?

1269
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,176
Oh, yeah?

1270
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,211
Yeah.

1271
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,836
Well, what if they don't?

1272
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,175
What if they don't send me home?

1273
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,513
What if they send me to the state pen
with a bunch of gang banging butt pirates?

1274
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,381
What if that happens, Brian, huh?

1275
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:21,890
I am telling you that they won't.

1276
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,357
They're trying to scare you, Chris.

1277
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:26,018
That's how these
fucking people operate.

1278
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,062
Don't let them.

1279
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,600
I'm sorry if it's gonna
fuck up your business,

1280
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,035
but right now,
Nate is my only ace in the hole.

1281
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:40,675
And what then, huh?

1282
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:41,710
Huh?

1283
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,244
What do you think's gonna happen then?

1284
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:45,337
You think that shit's
not gonna come back on all of us?

1285
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,445
You think Nate's gonna be
a hospitable fucking guy

1286
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:52,987
after you fucking backstab him?

1287
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,922
He won't know who told on him.

1288
01:09:55,991 --> 01:09:58,721
The cops will just act like

1289
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,261
it's a routine drug bust
or something.

1290
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:03,628
Christopher.

1291
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,496
Come on, man.

1292
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,128
You think Nate's stupid?

1293
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:12,368
Only a matter of time, baby boy,
until he finds out

1294
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:13,965
you got picked up.

1295
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,705
And then... -

1296
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,440
then we're all gonna be fucked.

1297
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:21,779
All of us, Chris.

1298
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,580
I would rather take my chances
with Nate than go to prison.

1299
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,382
I don't know what else to tell you.
I'm sorry.

1300
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:29,288
Time's up, Collins.

1301
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,416
Chris, listen to me.

1302
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,086
I don't think you understand
how dangerous this situation is, okay?

1303
01:10:33,162 --> 01:10:35,995
You got to give me time to figure it out.

1304
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,498
Chris, don't say anything to anybody.

1305
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,533
Chris.

1306
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,694
Chris.

1307
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:43,294
Fuck.

1308
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,771
Fuck.

1309
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:53,544
Yeah, have them meet
at the girls' place.

1310
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,811
Tonight.

1311
01:10:55,884 --> 01:10:58,284
Yeah.

1312
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:03,724
Hey, Kevin, um...

1313
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,522
I'll see you tonight, all right?

1314
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,564
All right.

1315
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,583
There he is.

1316
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:35,180
Hey.

1317
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:36,815
Hey, did you see Chris?

1318
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,655
We good?

1319
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,093
Yeah.

1320
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,860
And what's the deal?

1321
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:50,128
He's gonna be out like
tomorrow or the next day.

1322
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:52,105
Something like that.

1323
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:55,904
What do you mean
he's gonna be out tomorrow?

1324
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,138
I got it taken care of.

1325
01:11:57,212 --> 01:12:00,204
Ladies, I need you guys go in
the other room.

1326
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:01,249
Go, go, go.

1327
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,284
Come on, come on, come on.

1328
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,318
Go.

1329
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,980
I took care of it.

1330
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:11,321
What do you mean you took care of it?

1331
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:14,362
I mean I took care of it, homey.

1332
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,829
Okay, he's gonna be okay.

1333
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:16,887
We're gonna be okay.

1334
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:18,523
Nothing's gonna come back on us.

1335
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,500
A little faith, huh?

1336
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:21,536
Kevin, a little faith?

1337
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:22,592
All right, all right.

1338
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,263
Now it's back to business, okay.

1339
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,807
We got to get things on track.

1340
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:31,073
Brian, I wanted to talk to you
about that.

1341
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:35,743
You know, I've been thinking.

1342
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:41,085
You know, with all the shit
that's gone down lately,

1343
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,182
you know, it seems that,
you know,

1344
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:47,717
maybe it's time
we get out of this life, bro.

1345
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:51,232
You know, I know that we planned
all this shit.

1346
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,962
You know, but we never really
talked about how

1347
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:57,335
or when we were gonna end this.

1348
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:00,773
Maybe now is the time.

1349
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:07,143
And then what, huh, Darick?

1350
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,183
Then what happens?

1351
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,217
We end it tonight.

1352
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:10,546
What happens?

1353
01:13:12,755 --> 01:13:16,919
Then we go on with our lives.

1354
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,723
Go on with our lives?

1355
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,696
Just like that?

1356
01:13:22,765 --> 01:13:23,732
Yeah.

1357
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:24,766
Yeah?

1358
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,562
Why not?

1359
01:13:31,507 --> 01:13:35,534
Tell me something, man.

1360
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:41,106
Could you go back,
working that 9:00 to 5:00,

1361
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,514
having somebody tell you what to do

1362
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:48,022
after you've been making
20 grand a week for the past year?

1363
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,888
I wouldn't need to go back
to a 9:00 to 5:00 gig, man.

1364
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:56,591
I've got money saved.

1365
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,155
You got money saved.

1366
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,200
Yeah.

1367
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,235
Yeah.

1368
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:04,102
Yeah, yeah, I got money saved,
you know, unlike you,

1369
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,403
who went out and bought
a fancy apartment and all your toys.

1370
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:09,467
You know, my life hasn't changed
all that much.

1371
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,681
How much money
you got saved, Darick?

1372
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:21,189
I got enough.

1373
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,053
Don't worry about me.

1374
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:24,456
I got enough.

1375
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:29,586
You got enough for what?

1376
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,533
For what?

1377
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:43,044
To not work the next 10, I don't know,
man, maybe 15 years if you milk it.

1378
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,807
Then you're gonna be
middle-aged, Darick,

1379
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,578
and you gonna be back
at the fucking garage.

1380
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,879
No.

1381
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:55,322
No, I'll go back to school
or something.

1382
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:57,017
School.

1383
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:59,788
I can just see that shit now, dude,

1384
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:03,025
drug-dealing pimp
enrolled in Carnegie Mellon.

1385
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:05,191
I'm not a drug-dealing pimp, all right?

1386
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,700
You're not a drug-dealing pimp?

1387
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:08,463
No.

1388
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,199
You got a kilo of coke stashed
in your garbage disposal at home.

1389
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,969
And you're in a house
with three hooker whores.

1390
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,067
And you got nothing to do with it?

1391
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:19,238
You got equal share in this bullshit like
the rest of us, Darick.

1392
01:15:19,314 --> 01:15:20,713
Yeah, well, that's the whole thing.

1393
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,249
Ain't it, Brian?

1394
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:25,753
I don't want to stake my claim in life
as some drug-dealing pimp.

1395
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,550
Not anymore.

1396
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:28,920
Oh, and Sienna?

1397
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,357
That's our responsibility, Brian.

1398
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,620
That's our fault.

1399
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,822
What am I supposed to say to my kid
when I'm behind bars?

1400
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:37,991
See, that fucking kid,
that's your problem.

1401
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:49,335
This shit is way out of control.

1402
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:00,118
What a little fucking bitch.

1403
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,713
Huh?

1404
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:08,694
I'm done too.

1405
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:11,130
What?

1406
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:15,192
Yeah, I'm done too.

1407
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,965
Kev...

1408
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,737
I told the girls to go to their room.

1409
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:27,245
I told the girls to go
to their fucking room.

1410
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,580
Kevin.

1411
01:16:33,655 --> 01:16:34,917
Kevin.

1412
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,120
About four months now.

1413
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:49,804
[Sighs]

1414
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:56,538
Couldn't find a bitch some place else?

1415
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,738
I mean, really?

1416
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,617
I'm in love, man.

1417
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,688
[Disbelieving laugh]

1418
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:20,133
[Laughing]

1419
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:23,035
Listen to me.

1420
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:25,835
We got money, huh?

1421
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:27,272
We got more money

1422
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,674
than we ever imagined
we'd have as kids.

1423
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,804
This is getting bad, man.

1424
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:34,007
Chris just got busted.

1425
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,071
People are dying.

1426
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,481
We got to get out of this.

1427
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,244
You know what I'm saying?

1428
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,583
We got to be done with this, get on,

1429
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:42,521
try and find like,
some normal life or something.

1430
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:46,220
This is my life, Kevin.

1431
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,493
This is our lives, man.

1432
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:56,663
This...

1433
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:04,005
It's everything that we ever wanted

1434
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:09,210
since childhood, man, since...

1435

that I wasn't willing to follow.

for a while, in the end,

what they didn't realize

1703
01:41:43,897 --> 01:41:48,925
is that they were flying off
the bridge to nowhere.
