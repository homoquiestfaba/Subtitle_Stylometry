1
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,677
- Truman, Truman, wake up.

2
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,116
There's someone in the house.

3
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,975
- Wake up, wake up.

4
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:24,834
- Oh, party's over, huh?

5
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:25,855
- Yeah.

6
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:27,857
- Oh.

7
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:35,573
Thanks, great party.

8
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,704
By the way, where exactly am I?

9
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:00,745
- Belle, just a second,

10
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,705
I wanna put these out for the mailman.

11
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:04,415
- Good morning, Mr. Weston.

12
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:05,770
- Thank you, Belle.

13
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,170
- Weston residence.

14
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,588
Yes, just a moment.

15
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,006
It's for you, Mr. Weston.

16
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,341
- Oh, thanks, Belle.

17
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,092
Yeah, yeah, what is it, Mike?

18
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,532
I've got exactly seven minutes.

19
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:19,597
Belle, Belle, can you get him

20
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,182
to hold it down out there, please?

21
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,642
- Yes sir, it's fine, Mr. Weston.

22
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:25,102
Hey, hey, can you hold
it down out there.

23
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,687
- Belle, listen, I'm gonna late tonight.

24
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,731
I've got a meeting
downtown with the buyers.

25
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,191
Oh, will you get this refilled for me?

26
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,693
- Oh sure, Mrs. Weston,
I'll keep dinner for you.

27
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:33,820
- Thank you.

28
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,823
- Mike, Mike, if
I could off the phone.

29
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:37,657
Yes, yes.

30
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,783
- Pasta stuffed for dinner.

31
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:39,909
- Yes, Mrs. Weston.

32
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,203
- All right, Mike, I'll be there.

33
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,474
Okay, I'm on my way, bye.

34
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,415
Belle, I want you to go
to the cleaners today,

35
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,375
pick up my gray suit.

36
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:48,251
I've got a big meeting tomorrow.

37
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,210
It's my lucky suit.

38
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,920
- You better pick out a lucky tie too.

39
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,588
That suit don't work
too good the last time.

40
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,923
- You know something, she's right.

41
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,550
Better make it the blue one.

42
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,425
- Hold it.

43
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,386
Have you both forgot that
today's Robey's birthday?

44
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,595
- Aw.
- Oh no.

45
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:00,847
- I'll just have to pick
up something at lunch.

46
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,265
I'm really late.

47
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:03,099
- Okay.

48
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:06,853
Belle, tell him that I
said happy birthday

49
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,708
and that I'll see him tonight.

50
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:13,170
Maybe you can pick him
up a cake or something.

51
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:17,425
Traffic's gonna be murder.

52
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,740
See you later, Belle.

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,220
- Bye, Mrs. Weston.

54
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,914
Hey, hold it, where do
you think you're going?

55
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,583
Get in the kitchen and
get some breakfast.

56
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,876
- No, I'm not hungry right now, okay?

57
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,648
- Go and don't you give
me no trouble, huh?

58
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,912
- Blow out the candles and make a wish.

59
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,041
Now, open your present.

60
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,049
- Thanks, Belle.

61
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,157
- You find a girlfriend
to give it to, okay?

62
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:01,991
- Okay.

63
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:02,825
- Good, now go.

64
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,993
Go or you're gonna be late for school.

65
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,661
- Hey, I'm goin'.

66
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,495
Bye.

67
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,142
- Bye.

68
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,721
- I'm bringing Mason Wainwright
home for dinner tonight.

69
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,598
- I can't do this every night, Truman.

70
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:28,017
- No, no, no, no, just
Wainwright, that's all.

71
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:30,895
I just need tonight,
I'll close the deal.

72
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:32,104
- That's what you said last night.

73
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,732
- Look, this is my business.

74
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:35,900
You know how may guys are out there

75
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,903
just waiting for me to slip
up this much, and I'm out.

76
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,696
I'm back to designing strip malls

77
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,907
for some two-bit developer in Ohio.

78
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:44,178
- That's not gonna happen.

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,788
- Baby, we are so close.

80
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,142
We're so close.

81
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:52,959
Wainwright is the biggest client

82
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,002
that I've ever brought into the office.

83
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:58,297
He's got 60 lots of prime
L.A. real estate to develop.

84
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,091
The partnership's mine.

85
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:01,050
Kramer's about to retire.

86
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,072
He's practically dropping it in my lap.

87
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,684
- Truman, what have you done?

88
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,705
- Come here.

89
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,876
Now, don't peek.

90
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:17,608
- Truman, what are you doing?

91
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:18,776
- Do not peek.

92
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:19,797
Okay.

93
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,529
Peek.

94
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:22,613
- What is that?

95
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:23,864
- It's leased.

96
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,700
Gotta look like we can
play with the big boys.

97
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,410
- Truman, we can't afford a new car.

98
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,286
We're up to our ears in debt.

99
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,206
You never needed an expensive
car to do your job before.

100
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,000
- It's not just my job.

101
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,272
It's my career, it's my life.

102
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,006
You know what they say, if you
wait till you can afford it,

103
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,360
you're never gonna have it.

104
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,887
- Truman, I can go back to
work, at least part time.

105
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,516
- Christ, Patty, don't bring me down.

106
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,559
Can't you just believe in me?

107
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,122
Haven't I given you everything?

108
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:58,441
- What I want is a home
and a family, Truman,

109
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,568
not a car payment or a mortgage.

110
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,548
- You let me worry about that.

111
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,990
I'm gonna take care of you.

112
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,012
But we're so close,
baby, we're so close.

113
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,376
Dinner's at eight.

114
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,690
Wear somethin' pretty, okay?

115
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,655
- Can you believe this guy's called

116
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,531
three times in one morning?

117
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,908
- Good morning!

118
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,409
- Thanks, Patty.

119
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,243
Am I ever glad you're here.

120
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,913
Everyone in this office is
acting incredibly strange today.

121
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,039
Even my computer is on the fritz.

122
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,624
I can't get the functions to work.

123
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:57,666
Look at that one.

124
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,335
Call back Brad, he's called three times

125
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,169
in less than an hour.

126
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,545
Please, just call him.

127
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,214
- Did Wainwright call?

128
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,924
- No, not this morning.

129
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,592
- Well, give him an hour or
so to sleep off last night,

130
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,677
and confirm dinner with him tonight,

131
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,929
okay, call him.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:11,138
What's this?

133
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,223
- What's goin' on in there?

134
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,808
- I have a great respect
for your talent.

135
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,060
- Beats me, Green and Kramer

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,561
have been hiding in there for two hours.

137
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,437
Something's up.

138
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,523
- You're my eyes and ears
around here, darling,

139
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,502
keep 'em open.

140
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,338
- I'll see what I can do.

141
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,711
- Hey, Cheryl.

142
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,027
- Hi, Robey, why aren't you in class?

143
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,823
- Uh, well, I was
actually waiting for you.

144
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,158
There's something I wanted to ask you.

145
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,034
- Sure, what is it?

146
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,621
- Well, today's kinda my birthday,

147
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:21,333
and uh, I was just hopin' that maybe

148
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,211
you'd like to come over
later, maybe do something.

149
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,088
- Oh, I'm really sorry, I can't.

150
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,424
I'm kinda seein' somebody right now.

151
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,717
- Oh.

152
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:30,926
Well, that's okay.

153
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,032
- I'm really sorry,
happy birthday, though.

154
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,076
- Yeah.

155
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:38,204
Sure.

156
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,705
- Oh, Mr. Kramer, I just wanted to--

157
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,165
- What's goin' on?

158
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,833
- All right, here's all I know.

159
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,126
His name is Alex West,

160
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:06,754
and he's some hot shot over
with Platt and Associates.

161
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:07,713
Kramer's been on the phone with him

162
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,756
for the past couple of weeks.

163
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:09,965
- What for?

164
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,717
- I don't know, nobody's talking.

165
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:12,551
- Nothing to worry about there.

166
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,385
- It's big.

167
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:14,220
- Oh no, definitely--

168
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,054
- Keep on, okay?

169
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:16,430
- Remind me, none of my lawyers--

170
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,264
- All right.

171
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,265
- All the way.

172
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,286
Let's go.
- Let's go.

173
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,820
- Tough day, Mr. Weston.

174
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,947
- Just long, Belle.

175
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:35,324
- Well, your lucky suit
is up in the closet,

176
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,284
but I'm pushing for the blue one.

177
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,620
So, you want the good
news or the bad news.

178
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,205
- Uh, surprise me.

179
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:43,916
- Okay, here goes.

180
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,460
The gardener busted out the
window in the guest house.

181
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,505
I told him that if he doesn't
replace it before it rains,

182
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,694
he'd find a scorpion in his bed.

183
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,386
- Okay, so what's the good news?

184
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:56,595
- That is the good news.

185
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,931
The bad news is the school called.

186
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:00,286
Robey didn't show up today.

187
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,686
- Robey!

188
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:05,646
- Excuse me, Mr. Weston.
- Yeah, dad?

189
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,959
- Robey, come down here.

190
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,506
- Traitor.

191
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,135
- So, it was a nice day today.

192
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,429
You have the top down, yeah?

193
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,369
Good, good.

194
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,413
We got just a few weeks left

195
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,290
till the end of the school year.

196
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,874
And the Brookview Academy agreed

197
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,835
to take you as part of
their summer session,

198
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,607
providing you brought up your
academic standing a notch.

199
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,069
So, do you think now is the
time for you to fuck up?

200
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:37,094
- I don't understand why

201
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,013
I can't just finish high school here.

202
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:40,347
- Robey, the Brookview Academy's

203
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,434
one of the finest college
prep schools in the country.

204
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,311
Your mother and
I are trying to give you

205
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:48,355
an opportunity that few
young men could hope for,

206
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,401
your freedom to choose a
college, to choose your life,

207
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,048
rather than the other way around.

208
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:59,033
- And if I choose something different.

209
00:11:59,053 --> 00:11:59,908
- Well, I guess until you're capable

210
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,744
of making those decisions
with some sort of clarity,

211
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:03,474
I'll just have to make 'em for you.

212
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,248
Give me the keys.

213
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:07,124
- What?

214
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,354
- Give me the car keys.

215
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:10,919
- Dad, come on.

216
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:14,006
- The keys, Robey,
just call it business.

217
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,382
When you can hold up
your end of the bargain,

218
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,800
then you can have 'em back.

219
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,197
It's the way life works.

220
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:20,888
- Yeah, well, it sucks.

221
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,034
- What'd you say?

222
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:25,496
- I said, yes, sir.

223
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,263
- Wait, watch out for that step.

224
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:47,309
Come on, here.

225
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,548
Uh, sorry we're late.

226
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,467
We just, we stopped for a drink.

227
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,219
Time just slipped away.

228
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,136
Are we forgiven?

229
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,055
- I would personally feel very hurt

230
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:06,203
if I wasn't forgiven by
such a beautiful woman.

231
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,041
- Dinner's been ready for over an hour.

232
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,065
I can't guarantee the outcome.

233
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,068
- Well, if tastes a fraction
as delicious as you are,

234
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,841
my dear, I'm sure it'll
be a veritable feast.

235
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,553
- Come on, let me get ya a drink.

236
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:24,847
- And yes!

237
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:26,723
Very nice.

238
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,226
You are too kind.

239
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,854
- Pat,

240
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,148
babe.

241
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:36,900
You can save that for later.

242
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,510
Mason thinks you don't like him.

243
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,011
- Truman, I'd like to get
this food off the table.

244
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,575
- Come on, have some wine.

245
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,015
- I'm really tired.

246
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,434
- I got him hooked.

247
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:49,935
Help me reel him in.

248
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,980
Be nice to him, party a little bit.

249
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,231
Hey, buddy

250
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,065
- Yeah.

251
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,066
- A little freshener.

252
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,776
- Uh, yeah, thanks.

253
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,153
- And Patty, as glass--
- No, please, no.

254
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,716
- Oh, please, have one.

255
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:02,593
- Excuse me.

256
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,683
Hello.

257
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,373
Who?

258
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,583
- Your husband's a very lucky man.

259
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:13,417
- My man.

260
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,960
- He's gonna make
a lot of money with me.

261
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,170
- Well, good.

262
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,337
- The party's canceled.

263
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,505
No, there's no party tonight.

264
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:19,423
- To big business?

265
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:20,694
- Just the guy I'm--
- Okay.

266
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:25,137
- Tell them tomorrow.

267
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,097
- You're a very beautiful woman.

268
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,183
- Yes, I'll call you tomorrow.

269
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,101
- I beg your pardon.
- All right.

270
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,060
Talk to you later, bye, bye.

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,228
- Sorry.

272
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,647
Just tryin' to be a little friendly.

273
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,752
- Yeah, right.

274
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:45,908
- Hey, what's goin' on?

275
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:46,783
- You finish your business

276
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:47,910
and you tell that creep
to get out of here.

277
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,620
- Well, what's the matter?

278
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,580
- He had his hands all over
me, that's what's the matter.

279
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,706
- He wouldn't be here if
this wasn't so important.

280
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,624
- Did you hear what I said to you?

281
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:54,458
- I'm just being cordial to him.

282
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,752
- He had his hand up my dress.

283
00:14:56,772 --> 00:14:58,545
- Look, I need this deal.

284
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,442
Please, be nice to him!

285
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,238
- What are you saying?

286
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,242
- Just do this for us.

287
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,419
- Damn it!

288
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,402
- Mason.

289
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,237
- Hm?

290
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,258
- Have some more wine.

291
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,492
- Very impressive, Truman.

292
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,598
As a matter of fact, you've,
you impress the hell.

293
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,623
- We have a deal, then?

294
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,834
- Well, I was kind of
looking for something

295
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,648
a little bit extra, something,

296
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:45,779
how shall I say, to,
uh, sweeten the pot.

297
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,490
- Mason, I've done my homework on you.

298
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:52,307
You're in good hands.

299
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,434
- That's what I've been
waitin' to hear, Truman.

300
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,707
That is what I have been
waiting to hear all night long.

301
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,219
You forgot your wine.

302
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,237
- Truman, I didn't
expect you this early.

303
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,072
- I just closed the Wainwright deal,

304
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,406
thought I'd get started
on the paperwork.

305
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,659
- Now Truman, I'd like
you to meet Alex Weston.

306
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,618
- How do you do?

307
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,662
- Alex, this is Truman Langley.

308
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,246
Alex will be joining us.

309
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:39,956
- Uh, I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.

310
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,791
- Good idea.

311
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,959
- It was nice meeting you, Truman.

312
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,378
- What's up, Mike?

313
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:46,213
- Weston's a good man,

314
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,215
top executive at Platt and Associates.

315
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:51,093
He comes in with two major
international developers

316
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,594
and a luxury hotel chain.

317
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,221
Now, I don't have to tell you

318
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,972
what clients like that
are gonna do for us.

319
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,432
- That's great, that's great, Mike.

320
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,101
- And I'm thinking about retiring--

321
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,477
- Mike, please, why
don't you just tell me

322
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,521
what's going on around here?

323
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,856
- Partnership's going to Weston.

324
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,650
- Jesus Mike, it's my partnership,

325
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,110
I worked my ass off for that.

326
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,611
- It was the only way we
could get him to come in.

327
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:12,781
And now, we need a strong administrator,

328
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:15,158
and we're gonna have to
ask you to step down,

329
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,618
take an office downstairs--

330
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:17,744
- Wait, wait, what are you gonna do?

331
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,080
Just put me in shipping and receiving

332
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,727
until you can get rid
of me all together?

333
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:24,855
- I'm sorry, Truman.

334
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,906
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry too.

335
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:37,908
- Rina.

336
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:38,742
- Mm?

337
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,327
- Can you take this off?

338
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,579
- Mm, honey, what time is it?

339
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,476
It's, uh, it's 11:30.

340
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:47,542
- A.m or p.m.?

341
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,044
- A.m.

342
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,065
- Oh, god.

343
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,858
Mm.

344
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:03,934
Alex, if you didn't know me,

345
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,789
would you wanna have sex with me?

346
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:08,396
- Sweetheart, I do know you,

347
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,608
and I am trying desperately to
have sex with you right now.

348
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,754
- No, honey.

349
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,029
I mean, I if was just some stranger

350
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,053
that you saw standing across
the street, would you want me?

351
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,891
- Rina, I don't
know what you want me to say.

352
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:30,188
- God Alex, just
answer the damn question.

353
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,881
- Yes, I would wanna make love to you.

354
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,341
I wanna make love to you right now,

355
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,154
but you kinda have to be here for it.

356
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:42,242
- I thought that we agreed to
use some sort of protection.

357
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,661
I think I may be ovulating.

358
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,935
- Well, that did it.

359
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:47,998
- Here.

360
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,064
I think that we should pretend

361
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:54,651
that we're adrift in the
middle of the ocean all day.

362
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,652
- Don't mind if I swim to shore

363
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,654
for coffee and a Sunday paper, do ya?

364
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,050
- Black, lots of sugar.

365
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,554
- Aye aye, captain.

366
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,831
- Oh Alex, could you check on Robey.

367
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:10,458
I didn't hear him come in last night.

368
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,479
- Sure.

369
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,043
- Tru.

370
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:35,712
Truman?

371
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,466
Whatcha doin', honey?

372
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,511
- I'm goin' to the office.

373
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:48,350
- It's Sunday, you never
work on Sunday, honey.

374
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:53,355
- Partnership went to someone else.

375
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,644
- Workin' on Sunday, huh, Mr. Langley?

376
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,958
I guess that's why you
make the big bucks, huh?

377
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,074
Mr. Langley, Mr. Langley?

378
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,577
Mr. Langley?

379
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,539
Mr. Langley?

380
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,739
- Belle.

381
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,742
Belle!

382
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,348
- Excuse me, Mr. Weston.

383
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:31,307
You scared me half to death.

384
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:32,851
- I'm sorry, Belle, I just
wanted to let you know

385
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,520
I'm gonna be doing some
work at home this afternoon.

386
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,771
- In all the years
that I worked for you,

387
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,816
I can't remember you worked at home.

388
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:41,484
Something wrong, Mr. Weston?

389
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:44,195
- Yeah, well, I can't move into
my new office until tomorrow

390
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,031
because maintenance has to repaint,

391
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,491
then patch a bullet hole first.

392
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,577
I'll be in the den if anyone calls.

393
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,538
Oh, and Belle, I want you to go upstairs

394
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,019
and find my lucky suit and burn it.

395
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:15,288
Robey.

396
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,271
Robey!

397
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,857
I'm trying to get some work done here.

398
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:21,878
- Yeah.

399
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:23,797
- Robey, are you smoking?

400
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,697
- We'll catch ya later here, man.

401
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,135
Nice to see you, Mr. Weston.

402
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:49,427
- Good morning, Kramer,
Weston, Green, and Associates,

403
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:51,346
how may I direct your call?

404
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,367
One moment please.

405
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,600
Good morning, Kramer, Weston,
Green, and Associates,

406
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,913
how may I direct your call?

407
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:58,812
Good morning, Mr. Green.

408
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,166
Yes, she is, let me transfer you.

409
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,274
Hi, I'll be with you in one second.

410
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,943
- Good morning, Kramer,
Weston, Green, and Associates,

411
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,736
how may I direct your call?

412
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:07,904
Can I take a message?

413
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:09,489
Thank you.

414
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,427
Mr. Kramer's expecting
you, go right ahead.

415
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,536
- Good morning, Kramer,
Weston, Green, and Associates,

416
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,890
how may I direct your call?

417
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:21,292
- Mr. Kramer, Patricia
Langley is here to see you.

418
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,480
- Oh, bring her in.

419
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,673
Ah, Patty.
- Hi Mike.

420
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,570
- Here, sit down, come.

421
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:31,469
Can I get you something, coffee, tea?

422
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:33,950
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

423
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,017
- We're all so very sorry.

424
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:41,938
- Mike, about the company's
life insurance plan,

425
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,690
isn't there something you can do?

426
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,526
- It's completely out
of my hands, Patty.

427
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:48,653
Since Truman's death was self-inflicted,

428
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,383
the policy is worthless.

429
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,950
Now surely, Truman had
a personal policy.

430
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,369
- He borrowed against it.

431
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,288
- What about other assets?

432
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:59,372
Stocks, savings?

433
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,374
- I haven't really gotten
into that yet, Mike.

434
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,021
- Aw, give yourself some time,

435
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:07,400
and when you're ready,
I'll be here to help you.

436
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:09,277
Oh.

437
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,780
Well, let me get you some water.

438
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,020
- Good, I'll get someone to
work on these right away.

439
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,979
- Right.

440
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:25,356
- Uh, Karen, can you file these please.

441
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,545
- Sure, have a nice lunch.

442
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:31,758
- Good tastes, Weston.

443
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,116
- Thanks.

444
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,868
- I don't know if you're
up to this, Patty,

445
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:39,662
but some of Truman's things

446
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,726
are still in Alex Weston's office.

447
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,104
I thought you might
wanna go through them.

448
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:50,985
I'll leave you alone for a little while.

449
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:24,811
- You son of a bitch.

450
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,440
Who did you have to fuck, Alex Weston?

451
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,626
- I need this deal!

452
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,109
Please!

453
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:34,339
Be nice to him!

454
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,508
- I was just tryin' to
be a little friendly.

455
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,350
- Just do this.

456
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:33,981
- Well, nice to see you again.

457
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,283
What?

458
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,359
- I say we cut out at
third period, don't you?

459
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:41,340
- I can't cut
out at third period, man.

460
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,040
- I've got 35
kids in my gym class.

461
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,917
35, got that?

462
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:55,918
I don't know, they wanna play

463
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,421
two-on-two basketball with 35 kids.

464
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,715
- Good morning, may I help you?

465
00:31:00,735 --> 00:31:02,383
- I hope so.

466
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:05,887
My husband and I just moved
here from the east coast,

467
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,431
and we were hoping to enroll
our daughter Stephanie

468
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:10,725
in El Camino next semester.

469
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,580
- Well, this is a lovely school.

470
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:14,770
- Our concern is that Stephanie

471
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,647
would have difficulty
with the new curriculum,

472
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:18,733
and I was hoping you
could recommend a tutor

473
00:31:18,753 --> 00:31:20,693
who could bring her up to
speed during the summer.

474
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,987
- Oh, we have several wonderful teachers

475
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,989
who work during the summer.

476
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,033
I have them on file.

477
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,659
Let me get them for you.

478
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,680
- Thank you.

479
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,791
- Well, it's a 12th grade course

480
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,835
to prepare them for college.

481
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:41,214
- Let me get, I have
to get back to my gym course.

482
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:43,341
I got them playing volleyball.

483
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,761
- Volleyball?

484
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:50,056
- Here's a list of teachers
who do private tutoring,

485
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,308
and here's an application for admission,

486
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,686
and we're looking forward to
seeing Stephanie in the fall.

487
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:56,707
- Thank you.

488
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,543
Goodbye.

489
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:16,082
I'm gonna destroy you Alex Weston,

490
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,895
you and your family, one by one.

491
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,652
- Robey!

492
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:27,218
- What's wrong, Mr. Weston?

493
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:28,511
- Aw, nothing, now, where's Robey?

494
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,762
- Oh, he went out.

495
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:30,972
- What about Mrs. Weston?

496
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,159
- Upstairs, I think.

497
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,707
Rina, Marina!

498
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:41,107
- I'm on an island in the
middle of the Caribbean.

499
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,901
Unless you come bearing
pineapples and trinkets,

500
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,173
there's no one home in
this little grass hut.

501
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,031
- How 'bout if I scrub your back?

502
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,220
- Mm, only if I can call you boy.

503
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,746
- There's a letter from Robey's school.

504
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,976
- Aw, what now?

505
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,751
- Uh, I don't know.

506
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,086
They're afraid they can't recommend him

507
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,212
for the Brookview Academy

508
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,298
unless he can bring his
overall grade point up

509
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,425
before the end of the semester.

510
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:09,802
- Alex, he studies, we
stay on him all the time.

511
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,053
I mean, what else can we do?

512
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:12,074
- I don't know.

513
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,349
Maybe he's not focused.

514
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,309
They suggested a tutor.

515
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,997
They sent a list of three names.

516
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:23,733
- You're looking at me like I
have time to deal with this.

517
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:26,110
- I'm overwhelmed at the office.

518
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,446
I had to take over all of
Truman Langley's clients--

519
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:30,551
- Enough, boy, I'll call these people,

520
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,784
but you have to be the one to tell him

521
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,703
that he has to spend the
rest of his free time

522
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,183
with his nose in a book.

523
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,101
- Why not?

524
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,396
I'm his least favorite
person right now anyway.

525
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,142
- Hm, Belle, can you find
my other shoe for me,

526
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,518
please, sweetie, I'm gonna be late?

527
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,978
- Oh sure, Mrs. Weston.

528
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:01,957
- Thank you.

529
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,234
Yes hi, I'm trying to
reach Amanda Cressfield.

530
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,279
- Yes, this is Amanda Cressfield.

531
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:11,425
Yes, I am available.

532
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,428
I'd be glad to.

533
00:34:15,805 --> 00:34:17,119
When would you like to start?

534
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,371
- Could you come by this evening?

535
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,331
I'm sorry I'm in such a rush.

536
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,352
- That'll be fine.

537
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,523
Yes, I have a pencil right here, mm-hmm.

538
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,298
Say, 5:30 then.

539
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,320
Look forward to meeting you, Mrs.
Weston.

540
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,809
- Robey, could you come in here please?

541
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:41,977
There's someone I'd
like for you to meet.

542
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,271
Sweetheart, please don't
bounce that in the house,

543
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:45,856
I've asked you not to.

544
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,441
Robey, this is Amanda Cressfield.

545
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,360
She's gonna be your new tutor.

546
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,778
- Nice to meet you.

547
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,174
It'll be painless, I promise.

548
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,468
Have a seat.

549
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,994
- He hasn't been very focused lately.

550
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,204
He has the potential,

551
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,998
but he just hasn't
been applying himself.

552
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,376
- I'd like to hear what you have to say.

553
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:06,544
- Alex, sweetheart,

554
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:07,628
could you come in here for a minute?

555
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,839
There's someone I'd
like for you to meet.

556
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,966
Amanda, this is my husband, Alex.

557
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:13,008
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

558
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,427
- Alex, this is Amanda Cressfield.

559
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,053
She's gonna be tutoring Robey.

560
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,138
- Pleasure.

561
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,889
- Oh, sweetheart, you found someone.

562
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:19,910
- Yeah.

563
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:23,436
- We really appreciate your help.

564
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:25,730
So, when can you start.

565
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,732
- Well, there may be a slight problem.

566
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:29,275
The owners of the building I live in

567
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:30,860
are having some contractors come over

568
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,112
to do renovations on Tuesday,

569
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,281
and I know this morning I
said I could start earlier,

570
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:38,033
but I'm gonna need about a week
to find a new place to live.

571
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,910
- Well, Robey's finals
are in just a few weeks.

572
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,870
- I know.

573
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,788
- I'll understand if you
wanna find someone else,

574
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:43,809
and I'll help you.

575
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:46,417
- We have a guest house.

576
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,335
- The guest house?

577
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:49,732
It needs so much work.

578
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,756
Alex, what do you think?

579
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,695
- I don't know, it's
empty, if you don't mind.

580
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,679
Well, I think if it helps our
son get in Brookview Academy,

581
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:00,242
then I'm all for it.

582
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:02,349
Thanks, Belle.

583
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,018
- Belle, do you think that you

584
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:06,562
could work some magic
with the guest house?

585
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,417
- If that's what you want, Mrs. Weston.

586
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,525
- I can't thank you enough.

587
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:12,797
That's just terrific.

588
00:36:13,756 --> 00:36:14,695
- What do you mean, you gotta go?

589
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,696
You gotta go where?

590
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:16,906
- I gotta go study with a tutor.

591
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:19,200
- Oh man, come on.

592
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,202
You are turnin' into a drag.

593
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,162
We're not gonna be able
to get a game goin'.

594
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:26,749
You know, Weston, if you get
a plastic pocket protector

595
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,293
and some glasses, you
could be a real nerd.

596
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,023
- Hi, Robey.

597
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:35,986
Want a ride?

598
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,864
- Dude!

599
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:46,769
- Thought we could get started early.

600
00:36:46,789 --> 00:36:47,790
Wanna drive?

601
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:51,669
- Whoa.

602
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:00,407
- Who was that?

603
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:03,722
- I don't know, man, but she is awesome.

604
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,370
- You're doing good work, Robey.

605
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,018
Trust me, we'll have your
grades lined up in no time.

606
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,337
- You should have something to eat.

607
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:56,463
You'll get a headache if you

608
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:58,841
work your brain too hard
on an empty stomach.

609
00:37:58,861 --> 00:37:59,717
- Thanks, Belle.

610
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:00,843
- Yeah, thanks, Belle.

611
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:03,365
Now, if you don't mind, we're busy.

612
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,473
- Yeah, sure, I just wanted to make sure

613
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:10,372
he doesn't strain his brain or his eyes.

614
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,804
- Quite a shopping spree.

615
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,288
- I am so glad to be home.

616
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:32,124
I have been to at least
a 100 different stores.

617
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:34,460
My feet hurt and my back is killing me.

618
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,463
- Well, 30 minutes of yoga
and a massage works wonders.

619
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,465
- Well, if I start right now,

620
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,591
I might just be lucky enough

621
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:43,427
to be presentable by seven o'clock.

622
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,013
- Okay, um, hot bath, stiff drink.

623
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,118
Less therapeutic, same results.

624
00:38:49,787 --> 00:38:51,644
- You know what the really
irritating thing is?

625
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,479
Alex will come in here at 6:15,

626
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:55,314
he will shave, shower, dress,

627
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,857
and be standing downstairs harping at me

628
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,984
that we're gonna be late by 6:45.

629
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,069
- Where do you want these?

630
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:01,153
- Um, upstairs, actually,

631
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,655
I was hoping Belle would
be here to help me.

632
00:39:02,675 --> 00:39:03,530
Belle!

633
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,157
- She must be out shopping
or something, let me help.

634
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,325
- Oh no, I couldn't ask.

635
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,452
- Please, I'm dying to
see what you've bought.

636
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,515
- Okay, okay.

637
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:21,423
- Running one very hot bubble
bath with essence of gardenia.

638
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:23,404
- Oh, I can't thank you enough.

639
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:28,931
I wanted to thank you for all
of your hard work with Robey.

640
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:31,558
He's been very dedicated
for the last few days.

641
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,727
He feels very comfortable with you.

642
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:36,480
I just don't get to
spend much time with him.

643
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,773
- That's a devastating gown.

644
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:39,274
Party?

645
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:40,985
- Fundraiser at the country club,

646
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,965
all of Alex's design cronies.

647
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,741
Do you really think it's me?

648
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,076
You don't think that
it's too much for me?

649
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:50,703
- Are you kidding?

650
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:51,724
You'll be stunning.

651
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,607
- Huh, you know, sometimes
I forget how old I am.

652
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,924
I find myself having to mark my age

653
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,843
by how many years we've
lived in this house

654
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:10,868
or when we bought our second
car or the year Robey was born.

655
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,371
- Time slips away quickly, doesn't it?

656
00:40:15,956 --> 00:40:18,897
- Sometimes, I feel like I
haven't paid enough attention,

657
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:23,777
you know, or, I don't know, I just,

658
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:26,550
somehow things just slipped
by me when I wasn't looking.

659
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,470
- It's easy to let that happen.

660
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,994
- Yeah, most of the time,

661
00:40:32,014 --> 00:40:34,413
I just see a stranger in the mirror.

662
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,290
When did I get to be a grownup?

663
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,709
- About the time you
joined the country club.

664
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:41,231
I think they only
take grownups, don't they?

665
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,174
- Oh my god, you're right.

666
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:47,488
I have become a country club matron.

667
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,305
- Trust me, not in that dress.

668
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,367
Oh, your bath!

669
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,375
I'll get it.

670
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,028
Hello, Weston residence.

671
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,945
- Is Alex home, please?

672
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:07,863
- No, I'm sorry, he's not.

673
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,406
Can I take a message?

674
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:10,783
- Oh no, it's not important.

675
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:12,201
- Want me to tell him who called.

676
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,473
- It's uh, Mike
Kramer, I'll call back.

677
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:18,977
- Who was that?

678
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:23,754
- Oh, some woman,
wanted to talk to Alex.

679
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:27,361
Wouldn't leave a message and
refused to give her name.

680
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:34,284
You know what they say, if
a woman answers, hang up.

681
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,989
Hot bath and wine as promised.

682
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,511
- Oh thanks, you're very sweet.

683
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,116
Mm.

684
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:16,390
- More wine?

685
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,060
- Mm, I'm Cleopatra
floating down the Nile

686
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,790
alone on my barge.

687
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,794
- Well, Your Highness,
you're getting pruny.

688
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:29,840
No one likes a pruny potentate.

689
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,094
Especially in a low-cut gown.

690
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:40,350
- Mm.

691
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:47,546
- You know, I used to model a little

692
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:51,383
when I was much younger, and
I worked with a designer once,

693
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,428
and he said to me, the
key to how a woman feels

694
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:58,243
when she wears my clothes
is how she puts them on,

695
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:04,104
and he said, everything
that touches a woman's body

696
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,774
should feel good because
when she feels good,

697
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,004
she looks good.

698
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:21,350
And now, a little scent
on all the pulse points.

699
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,106
And you never know.

700
00:43:41,954 --> 00:43:44,144
Look how beautiful you are.

701
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,707
- I feel beautiful.

702
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,961
- Marina, honey, I'm home!

703
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:51,380
Marina!

704
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:58,075
Marina, let's go, we're gonna be late!

705
00:43:58,095 --> 00:43:59,785
- I'm gonna finish up
my work now, Mr. Weston.

706
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:00,661
I'll see you on Monday.

707
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:01,745
- Aw, that's great, Belle.

708
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,164
Be sure to lock up, and
have a nice weekend.

709
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,040
- Thank you.

710
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,229
- Alex, I'm ready.

711
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:10,315
- Rina?

712
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,568
I love it.

713
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:21,785
- Oh, Mrs. Weston, you
look so beautiful.

714
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,455
- It was worth the wait, sweetheart.

715
00:46:03,303 --> 00:46:05,013
- Ow, Belle, come on.

716
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:07,245
I was just lookin' for my basketball.

717
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,289
- Sure, and pigs fly.

718
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:12,834
So, young Mr. Weston
is now a peeping Tom.

719
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,544
- I am not, I didn't do anything.

720
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:15,837
- You are not so big

721
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,173
that I still can't put you over my knee.

722
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:21,051
If I catch you again, I am
going to tell your father.

723
00:46:21,071 --> 00:46:22,280
Now, go to your room,

724
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:26,098
and if you look for that dirty
magazine under your mattress,

725
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:27,536
you won't find it no more.

726
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:04,906
- How does it feel?

727
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,618
- How does what feel?

728
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:11,455
Why are you in here?

729
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:14,271
- I wanted to see your room.

730
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:15,292
- It's kinda messy.

731
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:19,296
- You were lookin' in my
window tonight, weren't you?

732
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:22,404
- Ow!

733
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:23,425
- Don't lie.

734
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:25,532
It doesn't feel very good

735
00:47:25,552 --> 00:47:27,304
havin' someone spy on you, does it?

736
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:35,333
When you do bad things,
you have to be punished.

737
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,002
Have you ever been punished?

738
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,170
- Yes.

739
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,296
- It's Friday night.

740
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:42,068
Why aren't you out with your
friends having a good time?

741
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:44,988
- I don't know.

742
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:47,616
- Are you a virgin?

743
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,564
Next time you wanna see something,

744
00:47:57,584 --> 00:47:59,836
knock on my door and ask me.

745
00:48:03,298 --> 00:48:04,299
- Oh shit.

746
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:06,051
Shit!

747
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:33,245
- I'm gonna teach you everything I know.

748
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,756
Pay attention.

749
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,888
You'll be tested on
all the material later.

750
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,895
I expect your grades to go up.

751
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,114
I may even give you a pop quiz.

752
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,249
Take off your clothes.

753
00:49:20,834 --> 00:49:21,835
Do it.

754
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,477
All of them.

755
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,058
Mm.

756
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:43,893
You have to go.

757
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:47,460
- I wanna stay here.

758
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,796
- You can't, if your father
catches you here at this hour,

759
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:51,568
it's over for us, do you understand?

760
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:56,865
- All right.

761
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:10,295
- Robey.

762
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:12,110
- Yes, sir.

763
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,112
- Robey, it's four
o'clock in the morning.

764
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,800
Where have you been?

765
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,032
- Out.

766
00:52:18,052 --> 00:52:19,053
- Out?

767
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,661
Well, for the next week,
you can just stay in.

768
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,184
You come straight home after
school and hit the books.

769
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:29,689
- Yes, sir.

770
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:52,879
- Oh god.

771
00:53:06,184 --> 00:53:09,646
- So, how much did you
have to drink last night?

772
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,172
- I don't know, I didn't
think I had that much.

773
00:53:14,192 --> 00:53:15,548
I was very tired.

774
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,611
- You were very drunk.

775
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:21,012
- Alex please, if I made
a fool out of myself,

776
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:22,764
I don't wanna hear about it, not now.

777
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:23,785
- Okay.

778
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:35,338
- Mind if I join you?

779
00:53:36,673 --> 00:53:38,655
- No, of course not, sit down.

780
00:53:38,675 --> 00:53:42,075
I've been wanting to talk to
you for several days anyway.

781
00:53:42,095 --> 00:53:43,326
How's the guest house?

782
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:44,828
- It's wonderful.

783
00:53:44,848 --> 00:53:46,788
Can't thank you enough for that.

784
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:47,872
- Well, it will be thanks enough

785
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,333
if you tell me my son's
grades are improving.

786
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:52,544
- He's doing great.

787
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:53,378
- Really?

788
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:55,149
- He seems very eager to please.

789
00:53:56,109 --> 00:53:57,423
- That's a relief.

790
00:53:57,443 --> 00:53:59,801
You know, he's got finals
in less than a week.

791
00:53:59,821 --> 00:54:01,427
- He'll be fine.

792
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:03,054
I notice you have a
pool table in the house.

793
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,138
Do you play?

794
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:04,931
- Why, do you?

795
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:07,350
- Oh, I can hold my own.

796
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:08,413
- Is that a challenge?

797
00:54:09,414 --> 00:54:11,771
I'm warning you, I play for keeps.

798
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,959
- So do I.

799
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,162
What are you doing?

800
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,500
- Just giving you some privacy.

801
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,347
- I'll be home in time
for dinner, Belle.

802
00:55:12,936 --> 00:55:14,751
- Belle, I want you to go to my room

803
00:55:14,771 --> 00:55:17,337
and take those damn birds out of there.

804
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:20,381
I also want you to strip
all the beds upstairs today.

805
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,549
- But Mrs. Weston, I just--

806
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:24,928
- Belle, just do it, and don't
give me such a hard time!

807
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:26,888
Jesus, just once I would like to ask

808
00:55:26,908 --> 00:55:30,099
that something be done
and see that happened.

809
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:32,852
I just wanna know that I'm
sleeping on clean sheets.

810
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:35,333
I don't think that I'm
asking for too much, do you?

811
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:37,460
Thank you.

812
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:41,297
- Oy vey.

813
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:06,135
- Now, we're
going to do a figure eight

814
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,845
only we're not gonna
do it with our finger.

815
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:11,953
We're going to do it
with our hips, like this.

816
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,188
Okay, let's start with
a twist to the left.

817
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:18,231
- Weston residence.

818
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,502
- Push your right hip--

819
00:56:20,545 --> 00:56:22,610
Right, left, and center, please.

820
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,405
Push to the right and here,

821
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,824
push the left hip back.

822
00:56:27,844 --> 00:56:29,679
Back, center.

823
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,563
Hips, like this.

824
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:42,088
Okay?

825
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:45,925
But to start, we'll twist
to the left, bend the knees,

826
00:56:45,945 --> 00:56:49,198
two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

827
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:55,518
One, two, three, four.

828
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:57,290
Back and center.

829
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,173
Hips, like this.

830
00:57:07,717 --> 00:57:08,656
Okay?

831
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,616
But to start, we'll twist, and left.

832
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,577
Five, six, seven, eight.

833
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:19,584
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

834
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:21,461
Chest, two, three, four.

835
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,880
Push your chest one and then in one.

836
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,924
Back and forth, five, six, seven, eight.

837
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:34,660
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

838
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:44,484
Push your chest, front, and
slide you chest to the left.

839
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:48,488
Then touch right back,
rolling the shoulders forward.

840
00:57:48,508 --> 00:57:49,947
Then relax.

841
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:52,700
Ready, and five, six, seven, eight.

842
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:03,044
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

843
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:04,837
One, two, three, four,

844
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,756
five, six, seven, eight.
- And then there were three.

845
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:11,469
- One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

846
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:12,490
- Belle!

847
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,450
I'm home!

848
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:17,203
Belle!

849
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:19,205
Belle!

850
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:26,129
Hey.

851
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:28,986
Belle!

852
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,508
I'm gonna go do my homework.

853
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:32,990
Amanda?

854
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,137
- I'm in here.

855
00:58:36,806 --> 00:58:38,724
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa!

856
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:40,790
Wait, how did you do on your math quiz?

857
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:42,083
- Got a 94.

858
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,479
- Oh, let me see.

859
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:47,046
- What, you don't trust me?

860
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:50,027
- No ticket, no laundry, let me see.

861
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,740
Oh, very good boy.

862
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:07,733
What's this?

863
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:08,796
What is this?

864
00:59:11,174 --> 00:59:13,030
- I hate French.

865
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,448
I don't get it.

866
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,992
- Yesterday when I asked
you about French,

867
00:59:16,012 --> 00:59:17,410
you said you were doing fine.

868
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,120
48 isn't fine!

869
00:59:19,140 --> 00:59:21,038
A 48 isn't acceptable.

870
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:22,832
A 48 isn't even passing.

871
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,167
- It's my worst subject.

872
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:25,251
- You lied to me.

873
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,545
You know how I feel about lying.

874
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:28,379
- I'm sorry, I--

875
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:30,526
- Turn around, turn
around, face the table.

876
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:34,719
- What are you gonna do,
spank me or something?

877
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:35,887
Ow!

878
00:59:35,907 --> 00:59:38,117
- You're gonna learn French.

879
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:41,204
- What?

880
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:43,644
My name is--

881
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,082
- In French and quickly.

882
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,714
- Ow!

883
00:59:53,466 --> 00:59:54,467
You're hungry.

884
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:01,599
You want something hard.

885
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:11,442
- Raise your arms.

886
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:16,489
Do you now what this is?

887
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,430
- No.

888
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,910
- Well, you're gonna find out.

889
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:25,770
Don't move, uh huh.

890
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:28,189
Uh huh, in an hour, I promise,

891
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,127
you'll be able to beg in two languages.

892
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:39,887
- Belle!

893
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:42,473
Belle!

894
01:00:58,698 --> 01:00:59,699
Belle!

895
01:01:05,413 --> 01:01:06,414
Belle!

896
01:01:15,923 --> 01:01:16,924
Belle!

897
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,175
This is all my fault.

898
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,970
I was in a bad mood and
I took it out on her.

899
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,054
- It's not your fault.

900
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:44,724
It was an accident, just an accident.

901
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:46,976
- No, I'll never believe that.

902
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:48,539
- It was just an accident, mom.

903
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:50,875
- I'm gonna make you some tea.

904
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:53,169
- Rina!

905
01:01:55,338 --> 01:01:56,569
- Alex.

906
01:01:56,589 --> 01:01:57,590
Oh, Alex.

907
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,092
- I'm so sorry.

908
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:02,970
I'm sorry.

909
01:02:04,847 --> 01:02:06,474
Help me get your mother upstairs.

910
01:02:44,387 --> 01:02:45,785
- Nice shot.

911
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:46,619
- Oh, Jesus.

912
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:49,225
- Oh, I'm sorry, I hate that too.

913
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:53,667
Couldn't sleep, huh?

914
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:55,294
- No.

915
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:57,171
No, I couldn't.

916
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:59,006
- I'm sorry about Belle.

917
01:02:59,026 --> 01:03:00,674
How's Marina?

918
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:03,239
- She's upstairs, she's a mess.

919
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:06,889
She blames herself.

920
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:09,350
- Well, that's ridiculous.

921
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:10,810
- Marina hasn't been too clear lately

922
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,957
on exactly what's
ridiculous and what isn't.

923
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,168
- Oh, tranquilizers will
have that effect on you.

924
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,588
- Is it that obvious?

925
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,716
She's been under a lot of stress.

926
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:31,475
- Moodiness, depression, denial,

927
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:36,439
loss of appetite, loss of sex drive.

928
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:40,609
15 in the corner.

929
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,117
What's the matter?

930
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,581
Are you afraid of me.

931
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:56,709
- It's been a hell of a day.

932
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,692
Belle was with us for 12 years.

933
01:03:59,712 --> 01:04:01,819
She was part of the family.

934
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:05,406
My wife is upstairs passed
out on Valium again.

935
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:06,677
My son hates me.

936
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,014
I'm down here feelin' sorry for myself.

937
01:04:11,974 --> 01:04:13,350
And yes, I am afraid of you,

938
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,395
afraid of looking at you too long,

939
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,565
afraid of standing too close to you,

940
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:24,862
afraid that right now I could
justify almost anything.

941
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:30,117
- I can help you, Alex.

942
01:04:32,161 --> 01:04:34,872
I know what you're going through.

943
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:36,642
Hurt me, Alex.

944
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,062
Harder, come on.

945
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:12,636
- Robey?

946
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:22,021
- So Alex, that was one
hell of a game of pool.

947
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:25,337
You know, I've been thinkin',
maybe goin' off to school

948
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:27,276
might not be such a bad idea after all.

949
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:30,904
We can just call it business.

950
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:08,964
- Good morning.

951
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:11,362
- Good morning, I made you some coffee.

952
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:15,137
- Amanda, you don't have to do that.

953
01:07:15,157 --> 01:07:16,950
- I know, I want to.

954
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:19,642
- Marina's not feeling
well this morning.

955
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:20,663
- I'll stay with her.

956
01:07:23,207 --> 01:07:24,416
You need me.

957
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:51,256
- Chapman Pharmacy, good day.

958
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,133
- Hello, this is Marina Weston.

959
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:53,926
- Yes.

960
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:54,802
- I'd like to get a prescription

961
01:07:54,822 --> 01:07:56,156
refilled and delivered, please.

962
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:59,139
- All right,
that shouldn't be a problem.

963
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:00,099
Do you happen to have

964
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:02,184
the prescription number
handy, Mrs. Weston.

965
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,039
- Yes, number 1276977.

966
01:08:05,374 --> 01:08:07,167
- Just a moment please.

967
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:11,797
- Marina?

968
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:14,133
Are you awake?

969
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:18,909
I brought you something.

970
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:19,930
- Amanda?

971
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,916
I didn't know you were here.

972
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:27,980
- I'm gonna stay and
help out for a while.

973
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:31,483
- Oh, god.

974
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,845
- Don't cry, everything'll be okay.

975
01:08:37,865 --> 01:08:41,098
Here, camomile, guaranteed
to chase the blues away.

976
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,119
I promise.

977
01:08:43,579 --> 01:08:44,872
Come on, sit up.

978
01:08:47,666 --> 01:08:49,668
- Amanda, I just feel so terrible.

979
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:58,260
I just feel so terrible
about Belle, about,

980
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:03,370
I haven't paid any
attention to my house,

981
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:07,269
my husband, my son, myself.

982
01:09:10,105 --> 01:09:11,732
What on earth is happening to me?

983
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:15,174
- You've been through
something terrible.

984
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,528
Give yourself a little time.

985
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:23,160
- No, I've wasted too much
time, and I want it all back.

986
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,539
Amanda,

987
01:09:31,043 --> 01:09:33,233
I'm really glad that you're here.

988
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,047
I don't have anybody else to talk to.

989
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,634
- Oh, there, just lay down, come on.

990
01:09:42,638 --> 01:09:45,265
Everything's gonna be okay, shh.

991
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,670
- Robey isn't in school?

992
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:43,906
- Hello!

993
01:11:43,926 --> 01:11:45,135
Anyone home?

994
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:51,725
- Robey?

995
01:11:54,269 --> 01:11:57,648
- Mom, didn't know you were home.

996
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:01,882
- Why aren't you at school?

997
01:12:01,902 --> 01:12:03,216
- I have to study for finals.

998
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,447
- Robey, don't ignore me.

999
01:12:07,449 --> 01:12:09,409
- I'm not in school
'cause I don't wanna be.

1000
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:16,021
- Sweetheart listen, I know
that you're upset about Belle,

1001
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:18,126
but please don't take this out on me.

1002
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:21,318
- You have no idea what I'm upset about.

1003
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:22,339
You never do.

1004
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,425
You wanna know why I'm not in school?

1005
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:27,699
Why don't you ask me
where I was last night

1006
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,471
or why I didn't bother to come home?

1007
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:32,891
You didn't even know I wasn't here.

1008
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,477
Take another fucking pill, mother.

1009
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:41,900
- Robey!

1010
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:44,069
Robey, please, I'm sorry!

1011
01:12:46,113 --> 01:12:47,114
God!

1012
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,778
- You go and apologize
to your mother right now.

1013
01:13:04,798 --> 01:13:05,799
- No.

1014
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,551
I won't.

1015
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:11,513
- I know you're angry, but
you're not angry with her.

1016
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:15,434
You're angry at what you saw
in the pool room last night.

1017
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,292
Oh Robey, I wish you hadn't been there.

1018
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:22,024
I wish you hadn't seen what
your father did to me, but.

1019
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:25,068
- He forced you.

1020
01:13:27,154 --> 01:13:29,406
- He was angry, hurt.

1021
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,639
He didn't know what he was doing.

1022
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:35,142
I know he never would
have done it to me if--

1023
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:36,163
- Did he hurt you?

1024
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,041
Did my father hurt you?

1025
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:41,501
Did he hurt you?

1026
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:44,443
- No, I'm all right.

1027
01:13:44,463 --> 01:13:46,006
I was just a little scared.

1028
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:49,760
- That son of a bitch.

1029
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:51,950
That son of a bitch!

1030
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,869
- Robey, no, wait.

1031
01:13:53,889 --> 01:13:56,580
You'll only be making things
worse and hurting your mother.

1032
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,873
- I just wanna get the hell outta here.

1033
01:13:57,893 --> 01:13:59,186
- I know, baby.

1034
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:03,128
We're almost there.

1035
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:06,151
We're almost there, we're almost there.

1036
01:14:07,903 --> 01:14:10,260
Just a few more days, okay?

1037
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,907
And you can pack your bags and go.

1038
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,811
Marina I brought you some tea.

1039
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,896
I'm gonna make some soup or something.

1040
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,731
- Um, I'm not hungry.

1041
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:06,316
Tea will be fine.

1042
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:07,901
- You know, you really should eat.

1043
01:15:07,921 --> 01:15:09,778
Oh, I found this in the laundry.

1044
01:15:09,798 --> 01:15:11,113
It's an antique earing.

1045
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:13,802
I hope you have a mate to
it, it's really beautiful.

1046
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,191
- Marina?

1047
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:33,280
Marina, if you're
sick, go to a doctor.

1048
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:36,930
- Oh, Alex, leave me alone, I
don't wanna see you right now.

1049
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,014
- Marina, don't shut me out.

1050
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:38,849
- Alex, leave me alone.

1051
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:39,683
- Where are they?

1052
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,476
- What?
- Where are they?

1053
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:44,104
- These, these, goddamn it!

1054
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:45,230
- I haven't taken anything.
- No!

1055
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,148
- Alex, stop it!

1056
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:47,899
- I said, get up, Marina!
- Stop it!

1057
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:48,920
God, stop it, Alex!

1058
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:52,279
- Look at yourself, look at you!

1059
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:53,405
You can't even stand up.

1060
01:15:53,425 --> 01:15:55,907
- Alex, stop, no, Alex!

1061
01:15:55,927 --> 01:15:57,409
- Don't fight me!

1062
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:58,535
- Stop!

1063
01:15:58,555 --> 01:15:59,494
- Damn it, Marina!

1064
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:01,288
- Stop!

1065
01:16:01,308 --> 01:16:03,268
Alex, you're hurting me.

1066
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:05,228
Alex, stop!

1067
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:07,856
Alex!

1068
01:16:09,983 --> 01:16:11,026
Alex, please!

1069
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,134
Alex, you're hurting me.

1070
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:15,155
Alex, stop!

1071
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,929
Alex, what are you doing?

1072
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:19,306
- Amanda told me you'd deny it.

1073
01:16:19,326 --> 01:16:21,036
I didn't believe her.

1074
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,414
Let me tell you something, Robey.

1075
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:28,750
This is my house, and
as long as you're in it,

1076
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:31,586
you're gonna treat me and
your mother with some respect.

1077
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:32,691
You got that?

1078
01:17:33,775 --> 01:17:35,151
I don't care what your problem is.

1079
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,445
Oh, what, you mad at me, huh?

1080
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,053
You wanna take a swing at me?

1081
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:41,304
You wanna challenge me?

1082
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:44,035
Well, come on, you little shit.

1083
01:17:44,911 --> 01:17:46,017
Huh?

1084
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,270
Come on, tough guy.

1085
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:52,002
- Oh sorry, I just came
to get my sweatshirt.

1086
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:51,311
Marina?

1087
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,547
You look like you could use some.

1088
01:18:57,567 --> 01:18:59,778
- I guess I was just
feeling a little dizzy.

1089
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:03,386
- Maybe the sun isn't
a good place for you.

1090
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:04,407
- Hm.

1091
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,660
I was just trying to stay busy.

1092
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:14,501
Actually, I was, I was
trying to help Robey pack,

1093
01:19:15,502 --> 01:19:17,754
but I think I was just more in his way.

1094
01:19:19,339 --> 01:19:20,320
I just have to remember

1095
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,031
that he's not my little baby anymore.

1096
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:25,303
- No.

1097
01:19:26,221 --> 01:19:27,869
I know you'll miss him.

1098
01:19:27,889 --> 01:19:28,890
- I already do.

1099
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:32,102
- My apartment will be
ready in a few days.

1100
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,814
- So, you're gonna be leaving too?

1101
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:44,447
Amanda, you've been a
really good friend.

1102
01:19:46,366 --> 01:19:47,450
- That won't change.

1103
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:19,065
- Oh!

1104
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:22,944
Uh.

1105
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:27,740
Oh!

1106
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:40,150
- Are you all packed?

1107
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:41,171
- Yeah, I guess.

1108
01:20:42,297 --> 01:20:43,298
- When do you leave?

1109
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:45,989
- Tomorrow afternoon.

1110
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:48,950
Ryan's pickin' me up,
takin' me to the airport.

1111
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:50,930
- I guess this is our last
chance to say goodbye.

1112
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:48,441
- I'll be home late tonight.

1113
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:51,235
- Alex.

1114
01:23:54,656 --> 01:23:57,200
Aren't you even gonna
say goodbye to Robey?

1115
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,286
- We've said our goodbyes.

1116
01:24:01,454 --> 01:24:03,748
I just think it's better this way.

1117
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:34,112
- Okay.

1118
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:36,719
I love you.

1119
01:24:36,739 --> 01:24:37,553
- I love you too, mom.

1120
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,138
- I love you so much.

1121
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:40,264
Okay, get outta here.

1122
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,265
- All right.

1123
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:43,142
- Now listen, you guys be careful.

1124
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:44,644
- See ya later, Mrs. Weston.

1125
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:47,563
- And please make
sure that you call me, okay?

1126
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,524
- And then there were two.

1127
01:24:49,544 --> 01:24:51,587
- All right, I'll call
you as soon as we get there.

1128
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:45,683
- Hello.

1129
01:25:47,935 --> 01:25:48,978
Hello.

1130
01:25:53,357 --> 01:25:54,358
Hello?

1131
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:17,528
Hello.

1132
01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:18,549
Hello!

1133
01:26:19,217 --> 01:26:21,344
Whoever this is, I'm
gonna call the police.

1134
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:09,660
- Rina?

1135
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:13,122
Jesus Christ, Rina, what
the hell's wrong with you?

1136
01:28:14,165 --> 01:28:16,314
Put down the damn knife.

1137
01:28:16,334 --> 01:28:19,025
Rina, it's a blown fuse, that's it.

1138
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:21,027
You stay here, we've just blown a fuse.

1139
01:28:21,047 --> 01:28:23,007
- Alex, no,
please don't go downstairs!

1140
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:32,163
- Damn it, Marina, you coulda killed me.

1141
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:34,185
Unless that's what you
were trying to do.

1142
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:37,501
- Alex, there was someone in the house.

1143
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:40,421
Someone kept calling and then
the phone lines went dead.

1144
01:28:40,441 --> 01:28:42,214
Then I heard someone on the stairs.

1145
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:43,444
You gotta believe me.

1146
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,178
- Rina, Rina listen, the
phone's are fine, Rina.

1147
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:48,095
Everything's all right.

1148
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:49,325
There's no one here.

1149
01:28:50,576 --> 01:28:53,643
- Alex, Alex, listen to me.

1150
01:28:53,663 --> 01:28:55,102
I think she's trying to kill me.

1151
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:55,937
- Who?

1152
01:28:55,957 --> 01:28:58,064
- Amanda, I really think
she's trying to kill me.

1153
01:28:58,084 --> 01:29:00,733
- For god's sake, Rina,
Amanda is not here.

1154
01:29:00,753 --> 01:29:02,276
Will you listen to me, Rina?

1155
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:03,965
She's not here, you're fine.

1156
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:06,822
- You don't understand.

1157
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,449
You gotta believe me.

1158
01:29:08,469 --> 01:29:10,242
- For Christ's sake,
Rina, let's go upstairs.

1159
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,411
- Alex, don't patronize
me, I am not crazy!

1160
01:29:12,431 --> 01:29:13,496
- Rina look at me.

1161
01:29:13,516 --> 01:29:15,414
Look at what the tranquilizers
are doing to you.

1162
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:18,729
- God damn you, Alex,
I'm not taking anything.

1163
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,152
- Alex.

1164
01:29:45,172 --> 01:29:46,696
Alex!

1165
01:29:46,716 --> 01:29:48,322
- Yeah?

1166
01:29:48,342 --> 01:29:50,199
- I've been talking to
you for two minutes.

1167
01:29:50,219 --> 01:29:51,826
Did you hear anything I said?

1168
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:53,723
- Sorry, I'm just a little tired today.

1169
01:29:55,099 --> 01:29:56,497
- The design department's looking

1170
01:29:56,517 --> 01:29:58,582
for all the research
on Reich Development.

1171
01:29:58,602 --> 01:30:00,209
Alex?

1172
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:02,481
Alex, what is wrong with you?

1173
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:04,255
What happened to your hand?

1174
01:30:04,275 --> 01:30:07,675
- Uh, it's nothin', i just
had a little accident.

1175
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:09,844
So, where are the files?

1176
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:11,804
- Uh, probably still in
the boxes over there.

1177
01:30:11,824 --> 01:30:13,514
- Thanks, Karen, what
would I do without you?

1178
01:30:13,534 --> 01:30:16,871
- Mm-hmm, too little, too late, Weston.

1179
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:19,749
Too little, too late.

1180
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,446
- I will not be afraid in my own house.

1181
01:30:57,787 --> 01:30:58,788
My babies.

1182
01:30:59,622 --> 01:31:00,790
Oh, I'll feed my babies.

1183
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:03,667
Angels?

1184
01:31:05,252 --> 01:31:08,130
Angels, good morning.

1185
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:56,554
- Hello, Marina.

1186
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:00,057
- What are you doing here?

1187
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,791
- I brought you some tea.

1188
01:32:03,811 --> 01:32:05,459
- I don't want any tea.

1189
01:32:05,479 --> 01:32:07,503
I know that that's
what's making me sick.

1190
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:08,524
- Drink it.

1191
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:10,818
- I don't want it!

1192
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:48,731
- Get up.

1193
01:32:49,982 --> 01:32:51,525
Get up.

1194
01:32:55,696 --> 01:32:57,740
Don't make this any harder on yourself.

1195
01:33:00,576 --> 01:33:01,577
Move!

1196
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:08,522
- What are you gonna do to me?

1197
01:33:08,542 --> 01:33:10,065
- Alex is gonna understand

1198
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:13,088
what it's like to have nothing left.

1199
01:33:14,298 --> 01:33:15,529
- Please, don't do this.

1200
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:18,908
- He's gonna come home and find
that you slashed your wrists

1201
01:33:18,928 --> 01:33:19,909
and bled to death.

1202
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:23,204
- No, no, he knows I could
never do such a thing.

1203
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:25,915
- You've been irrational
and depressed for weeks.

1204
01:33:25,935 --> 01:33:28,395
You've taken Seconal every
day with your vitamins,

1205
01:33:30,314 --> 01:33:34,276
and yours will be the only
prints left on the knife.

1206
01:33:35,152 --> 01:33:39,053
Take it, it won't hurt as
much if you take the pill.

1207
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:40,491
Take the pill, Marina.

1208
01:33:43,953 --> 01:33:44,912
That's it.

1209
01:33:51,502 --> 01:33:53,192
- Aw, Alex, I'm sorry you're having

1210
01:33:53,212 --> 01:33:55,152
to play cleanup behind Langley.

1211
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:56,695
- Ah, it's no problem, Mike.

1212
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:59,260
- Listen, I'd like you to
go over this file with me.

1213
01:34:02,638 --> 01:34:04,848
- Excuse me, I have
to make a phone call.

1214
01:34:15,401 --> 01:34:16,986
- Alex, is there a problem?

1215
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:21,762
- The woman in this
picture next to Langley,

1216
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:22,596
who is she?

1217
01:34:22,616 --> 01:34:25,015
- That's Patricia
Langley, Truman's widow.

1218
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:26,308
- That's it.

1219
01:34:26,328 --> 01:34:27,288
- Weston, Weston!

1220
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,606
- Excuse me.

1221
01:34:32,626 --> 01:34:33,440
- Good afternoon.

1222
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:34,400
Kramer, Weston, and Green Associates,

1223
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,442
how may I direct your call?
- I think I have to pay a fine

1224
01:34:35,462 --> 01:34:37,111
and uh, hey Alex, how ya doin'?

1225
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:37,945
- Alex!

1226
01:34:37,965 --> 01:34:40,698
- The aftermath's a
sign that you really gotta--

1227
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:42,366
- Could you duplicate
these blueprints, please,

1228
01:34:42,386 --> 01:34:43,409
and send them over--

1229
01:34:43,429 --> 01:34:44,493
- I gotta go over.

1230
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:47,204
- I need you to make an
emergency call for me.

1231
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:49,748
I said a fucking emergency!

1232
01:34:49,768 --> 01:34:51,417
Call the police, give 'em my address.

1233
01:34:51,437 --> 01:34:53,168
Tell 'em my wife is in danger.

1234
01:34:53,188 --> 01:34:55,190
- Is he all right?

1235
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:15,566
You know, if you keep struggling,

1236
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:17,254
the pills won't work very quickly.

1237
01:35:18,714 --> 01:35:20,674
I don't have to wait, you know?

1238
01:35:33,937 --> 01:35:34,835
You were right, Marina.

1239
01:35:34,855 --> 01:35:38,339
You should've paid more attention.

1240
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:43,072
You had it all, you had everything
and you let it slip away.

1241
01:35:44,323 --> 01:35:45,366
So did Alex.

1242
01:35:46,742 --> 01:35:49,078
And his job is more
important than his wife.

1243
01:36:13,602 --> 01:36:14,895
- Marina!

1244
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:17,648
Oh my god!

1245
01:36:19,817 --> 01:36:21,006
I know who you are.

1246
01:36:21,026 --> 01:36:22,508
Everybody knows.

1247
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,009
- I don't give a damn who knows.

1248
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:26,178
You deserve this, you son of a bitch.

1249
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:28,972
- I love my wife very, very much.

1250
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:32,267
Now please, put down the knife.

1251
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,310
- Is that why you fucked me, Alex?

1252
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,312
'Cause you love your wife so much?

1253
01:36:35,332 --> 01:36:37,147
You're pathetic.

1254
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,857
Your son's a better
lover than you anyway,

1255
01:36:38,877 --> 01:36:40,462
so was your wife for that matter.

1256
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:42,881
- You bitch.

1257
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:10,514
- I'm sorry, Mr. Weston, we've
searched the entire property.

1258
01:37:10,534 --> 01:37:12,349
There's no sign of her anywhere.

1259
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:14,977
Obviously, she wasn't hurt
as badly as you thought.

1260
01:37:14,997 --> 01:37:16,770
There's nothin' much
left in the guest house,

1261
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,167
except a few personal items.

1262
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:21,692
- What do we do if she comes back?

1263
01:37:21,712 --> 01:37:23,318
- I strongly doubt if she'll be back.

1264
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,132
She knows everyone's lookin' for her.

1265
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:27,239
After you get this arm taken care of,

1266
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,907
I'm gonna need you both to
come down to the station,

1267
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:29,992
give us a statement.

1268
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:31,243
Where's your son?

1269
01:37:31,263 --> 01:37:32,369
- He's away at school, thanks god.

1270
01:37:32,389 --> 01:37:35,080
- Honey, I don't want
him to know about this.

1271
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:37,082
- I'm gonna need that
statement as soon as possible.

1272
01:37:37,102 --> 01:37:39,605
Office Young'll wrap up here.

1273
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,301
- No, no, no!

1274
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:12,095
- All right, shh.

1275
01:38:13,514 --> 01:38:14,536
Shh.

1276
01:38:14,556 --> 01:38:18,290
Honey, honey, it's okay,
it's okay, sweetheart.

1277
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:19,770
I just brought you some tea.

1278
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:24,441
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

1279
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:27,152
- Alex, it's not that.

1280
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:29,905
I just need some time.

1281
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:40,896
Hello.

1282
01:38:40,916 --> 01:38:42,648
- Hello, mom.

1283
01:38:42,668 --> 01:38:46,276
- Robey, hi honey, I'm
so glad you called.

1284
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:47,361
Are you okay?

1285
01:38:47,381 --> 01:38:48,195
- Yeah.

1286
01:38:48,215 --> 01:38:49,029
- Is everything all right?

1287
01:38:49,049 --> 01:38:50,948
- Yes, mom, I feel fine.

1288
01:38:50,968 --> 01:38:52,658
- I miss you so much, baby.

1289
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:54,076
- Yeah, I miss you too.

1290
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:56,286
- Your father's right here,
would you like to talk to him?

1291
01:38:56,306 --> 01:38:59,851
- No, I don't wanna
talk to dad, not now.

1292
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:05,546
- Okay, um, listen, you stay
in touch with us, all right.

1293
01:39:05,566 --> 01:39:06,421
I love you.

1294
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:07,506
- I love you.

1295
01:39:07,526 --> 01:39:09,361
- Bye.

1296
01:39:13,907 --> 01:39:15,659
Mommy and daddy send their love.
