1
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:36,967
<i>Robbery suspect located. Unit PT6 heading
for lower city level...</i>

2
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:44,518
Get away from me!

3
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,406
Leave me alone!

4
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:49,458
<i>This is the police.</i>

5
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:53,435
<i>Stay where you are, and
toss your weapon aside.</i>

6
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:59,377
- Get away from me!
- <i>THIS is you final warning.</i>

7
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,752
<i>...stop where you are...</i>

8
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:10,311
- Drop dead!
- <i>... is you final warning.</i>

9
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:17,392
There is no escape.

10
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:19,594
- <i>Stop or we will ruin you.</i>
- <...> away from me!

11
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:21,825
Stop. Stop.

12
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:23,045
Shit.

13
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,628
Oh my God, oh my God...

14
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,587
I'm so ANGRY with my life!

15
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:56,086
We got him trapped down in
the laundromat. But I do not see a thing.

16
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,806
According to the building plan, he's only got
one exit out of here.

17
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,636
All you kids, to the right!

18
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,911
- Do not .. do not scream!
- Muuum!!

19
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,859
Lady! Quiet!

20
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,104
I'm gonna <...> my foot, see if he's got
anybody else down there.

21
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,081
Back off!

22
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,685
Or I kill the fat lady!

23
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,725
I mean it!

24
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:38,449
Try anything!

25
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:41,838
Get these damn fuckers all over the place!

26
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,075
Please, rat, why don't you pick on
somebody your own size!

27
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:48,441
Ahh, sshhut up!

28
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:51,434
Hey, Cuartez...

29
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:54,564
...we got ourselves a biiig problem down here.

30
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:23,924
I bespeak further ten million mineral bricks and safe
passage out this universe as we know it.

31
00:05:24,187 --> 00:05:26,187
The son of a bitch is even crazier
than we thought,

32
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,124
if he thinks we're gonna give him
any of these things.

33
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:31,192
Is exactly what we're
going to do, Captain Skyresh.

34
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,736
I want the situation resolved now.

35
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:36,041
Give him what he wants and get rid of him.

36
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,492
Elections are next week and I don't need dead
fat ladies on video screens all over the city.

37
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:44,813
Get it, Mr. Mayor.
Just got a better idea.

38
00:05:45,424 --> 00:05:47,114
Brick Bardo just showed up.

39
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,429
Bardo? I just said I don't want a bloodbath.

40
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,719
I'm ordering you to meet his demands.

41
00:05:57,938 --> 00:05:59,008
Mayor?

42
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,778
Sorry, um... there is a trouble with
the phone here. Gotta go.

43
00:06:04,107 --> 00:06:06,746
Skyresh... Skyresh! Skyr...

44
00:06:18,065 --> 00:06:19,740
Brick, what are you doing here?

45
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:28,558
Good to see YOU.
Hell of a mess.

46
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:30,618
Got in there over thirteen hostages.

47
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:32,319
The mayor wants to give in.

48
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,490
I'm suspended, remember?

49
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,641
Yeah. But, um...

50
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,458
- you've got any ideas?
- I've got an idea.

51
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,134
Gonna use hot water for my whites...

52
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,395
use a cold wash and more rinser
for the colors.

53
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,363
What are you talking about?

54
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,600
Laundry, Captain.
This is what I'm doing.

55
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:54,962
Excuse me.

56
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,347
So Brick can take over?

57
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:05,072
Yeah.

58
00:07:07,658 --> 00:07:08,484
Right.

59
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:59,021
One... Two...

60
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:03,818
- Three...
- Hey asshole!

61
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:05,865
What the fuck you think you're doing?

62
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,764
I'm gonna kill these fat ladies!

63
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,362
Hey, I am talking to you, sh-shitbrain!

64
00:08:26,615 --> 00:08:27,310
Somebody...

65
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,325
...better... kick this moron out of here...

66
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:34,239
...or the FAT is going to hit the [...]!

67
00:08:44,147 --> 00:08:46,922
That's right.
One of us gonna get goin'.

68
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,800
But I already put my money in the machine.

69
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,325
I swear. I am going to do it.

70
00:08:54,747 --> 00:09:00,071
Wow! That's the Ruger Blaster,
the most powerful handgun in the Universe!

71
00:09:01,026 --> 00:09:02,247
That's right, fat boy.

72
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,348
And it's gonna blow a hole
clean through this fat lady.

73
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:08,409
And then blow a hole out of you.

74
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:11,355
And that's gonna blow a hole
outta lady behind you.

75
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:18,019
It's gonna be a lot of guts
floating around the laundromat.

76
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:19,868
Do you know what I mean...

77
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,537
...fat boy?

78
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:54,770
What the hell happened to you?

79
00:09:55,284 --> 00:09:57,021
Two women in cardiac arrest?

80
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,621
Everything is under control.
The suspect is in custody.

81
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:01,445
And every news station in town

82
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:05,142
is reporting that one of my officers
endangered a laundromat full of hostages.

83
00:10:05,222 --> 00:10:06,658
Think how that looks!

84
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:10,606
- Mayor, no one was killed and I thought
that Bardo here...
- I'll do the thinking, Captain!

85
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,631
<i>Where is that son of a bitch now?!</i>

86
00:10:15,645 --> 00:10:18,735
Disappointed you didn't get
to kill anyone tonight, Bardo?

87
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:20,734
You are through!

88
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,758
YOU GODDAMN PSYCHO!!

89
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:25,177
Take off those sunglasses, it's night!

90
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:29,894
- I want that bastard suspended!
- He is already under suspension because of
the incident in Fillmore.

91
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:32,153
Then fire his ass, I want him done!

92
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,591
Thank you for saving my Mom.

93
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:12,531
Tonight, at 11.68, there was a extreme shootout
in a South Central laundromat.

94
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:18,465
Unidentified sources at the crime scene claim
that a renegade ex-cop went on a shooting rampage

95
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:24,506
that has left an unconfirmed 27 bystanders
wounded and another 3.6 dead.

96
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:28,578
With more on this tragic [...] story [...]

97
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,733
Details are still sketchy at this point, Harry.

98
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:39,203
However, anonymous official has heard rumor
that 1.4 of the dead are indeed children.

99
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:43,068
<i>The Mayor's office has released
no actual details at this time.</i>

100
00:11:43,148 --> 00:11:49,177
<i>However, a highly placed authority has implied
the identity of the killer to be known:</i>

101
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:52,496
<i>The name 'Brick Bardo' was overheard.</i>

102
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:59,756
<i>Brick Bardo is a [...] detective that was involved
in the Fillmore incident earlier this year.</i>

103
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,094
<i>- That's right, Harry -
- We've come back...</i>

104
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,317
<i>...But first: we've got a travel advice...</i>

105
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:13,401
<i>...[indistinct]...</i>

106
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:34,484
There's an old friend...

107
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,836
Wants to see you, Bard.

108
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,299
Rise and shine.

109
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,739
I saw the news tonight.

110
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:17,056
You're a VERY violent man, Bardo.

111
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:20,767
Yes, I know.
It's a violent universe.

112
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:25,744
<i>I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me.</i>

113
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,800
I am seeing the last of you, Sprug.

114
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:33,250
After our last encounter,
this is all they managed to salvage.

115
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:35,235
Let's see if I'd remember the first time.

116
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,145
Countman bank job?

117
00:14:37,874 --> 00:14:40,607
<i>- I flew off your left arm.</i>
- And most of my left foot.

118
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:43,182
And then there was the Space Extortion.

119
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:44,601
What did I take?

120
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:47,482
Two... or three legs?

121
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,677
Among other things.

122
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:51,995
The last time,

123
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:56,242
All I remember was your head,
rolling around in the parking lot.

124
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,590
I didn't think it was enough to save.

125
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,487
The modern medicine.

126
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:03,551
They doing some wonderful things.

127
00:15:03,983 --> 00:15:06,647
<i>It's too bad your lovely family couldn't
benefit as I had.</i>

128
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:11,025
<i>Then I think, even our best doctors couldn't
have done anything with what was left of them.</i>

129
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:14,421
What do you want?

130
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:19,013
I'll tell you what I want, Bardo.

131
00:15:19,602 --> 00:15:22,366
50000 molecular ions.

132
00:15:23,732 --> 00:15:25,320
And I get them too, you know why?

133
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,238
Because my cruiser is loaded with
a dimensional fusion bomb,

134
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:34,057
that will blow the [...] of this city
into another universe [...].

135
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:36,800
It will never happen.

136
00:15:38,532 --> 00:15:39,575
Why not?

137
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:41,505
Somehow you'll fuck it up.

138
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,215
You always fuck it up.

139
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,802
No, Bardo.

140
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:50,395
You've always screwed up my plans.

141
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:56,481
But this time you don't have a chance,
because you gonna be it tiny, tiny little atoms.

142
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:03,135
I'll gonna blow you apart,
piece by piece, Bardo.

143
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:07,390
It's mine now.

144
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,915
I've heard about this custom-made monster
for years.

145
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:13,260
Do not worry, Bardo.

146
00:16:14,169 --> 00:16:15,432
I'll take good care of him.

147
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:17,462
And I'll put it to good use.

148
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:22,369
Start with his left hand.

149
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,426
How does it feel to be on the other side, Bardo?

150
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:41,483
I don't know. You tell me.

151
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,778
I'm gonna die.

152
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:13,661
You can't kill me anymore.

153
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,911
What do you want, asshole?

154
00:17:25,893 --> 00:17:26,936
Nothing.

155
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:39,452
You just gonna walk away?

156
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:57,859
Warning. Intruder is [...]. Closing fast.

157
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:06,563
Your crap won't take the pressure.

158
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:08,404
Neither will yours.

159
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:10,761
Damn!

160
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:13,540
I don't give a fuck.

161
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:16,664
What makes you think I do?

162
00:18:25,425 --> 00:18:27,807
<i>Warning: Energy Band impact.</i>

163
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:10,845

167
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:10,662

- [...] bucks!

168
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,619
Don't you be selling that trash
in my neighborhood!

169
00:22:46,101 --> 00:22:51,971
That's it! I'm tired with you sleazy motherfucking
dope dealers selling shit in my neighborhood!

170
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:57,808
Now fucking move or I fucking kick your ass!
Get the fucking move or I fucking kick your ass!

171
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:01,942
Do you want me to fucking kill you?
Get out of here!

172
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,081
Don’t fucking come back! Move it!

173
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:07,189
Go, take this shit with you!

174
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:12,959
Get the fucking out of here!
Go! Beat it! Scumbag!

175
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,401
That's why you have joined our
Neighborhood Watch program.

176
00:23:45,283 --> 00:23:47,503
Today we have a very special guest,

177
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:51,431
who will explain to us how the police
plan to help us in our fight.

178
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:55,831
Please welcome Captain Arnold Schuller,
police commissioner.

179
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:59,021
- Thanks for coming.
- Glad to be here.

180
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:04,404
Mrs. Alejandro is absolutely right.
We are involved in a war.

181
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:08,517
And if it weren't for you, people,
we would have no chance of winning.

182
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,395
I think you are the ones who
deserve my applause.

183
00:24:21,714 --> 00:24:26,870
Now that you have your sound-by, Captain Schuller, you
can go ahead and tell us exactly how you plan to help us.

184
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:32,298
What do you have in mind? Beefed-up patrols?
Raiding the crack houses? Roadblocks?

185
00:24:32,757 --> 00:24:35,936
Oh that's not as simple as that.
You know, it's a very big city.

186
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,999
And Dalton Avenue is not the only area that needs help.

187
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,054
Look...

188
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,275
...you are the police.

189
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,914
Protect and serve. It's your job.

190
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:47,885
Protect us!

191
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,852
Of course I will protect you, Mrs. Alejandro.
We will always try to protect you.

192
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:58,262
Together we can win this war.

193
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,329
There's the bitch that's keepin' up
to mess with our business, huh?

194
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,405
[...]

195
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:43,318
Get off me!!

196
00:26:05,186 --> 00:26:06,588
Get right...

197
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:09,016
You fuck with our business...

198
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:10,229
You die.

199
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:36,164
GET OFF ME!!!

200
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,461
Kill that bitch!

201
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:46,229
Kill the whore!

202
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:42,287
Drop the weapons down.
Step away from the girl!

203
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:33,427
Shhhit!! Giants!

204
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:36,195
That's for the giants, I hate giants!

205
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,475
- I did not mean to scare you.
- Scare me?

206
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:03,299
Who are you?

207
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:08,238
What am I to worry about,
this is just a bad dream.

208
00:30:10,093 --> 00:30:11,586
I must be in shock...

209
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:14,413
...or I am hallucinating...

210
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:16,738
...or... I have a concussion?

211
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,187
You're SO small.

212
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,855
We can't stay here, they'll be back.

213
00:30:36,174 --> 00:30:37,296
Those punks?

214
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:39,575
I don't think so.

215
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:41,873
They'll bring their whole gang.
We got to get out of here.

216
00:30:42,184 --> 00:30:43,448
I'm not going anywhere.

217
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:50,047
Stop it. Stop it. Hey! Stop!
Fuckin' Giants!

218
00:31:27,335 --> 00:31:29,056
Look! A head, on the road!

219
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,104
- Where?
- No, no. That's human head, look!

220
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:43,042
The fuck is that, man?

221
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:46,822
- Fuck is that?
- Look, my friends...

222
00:31:47,516 --> 00:31:49,446
...let's cut to the case.

223
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,666
I am obviously a visitor from another ff... world,
who has had a bit of... trouble!

224
00:31:56,663 --> 00:32:00,468
You help me out... I'll help you out.

225
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:03,285
It fuckin' talks!

226
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,392
We gonna help you do what?

227
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:07,207
Conquer your world...

228
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:09,950
...such as it is.

229
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:13,986
<i>I've... got a bomb you could use.</i>

230
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,824
Some thing that will rip your dimension
a new asshole.

231
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:27,006
Rip my dimension?

232
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:30,534
Believe me, nobody will fuck with you.
<i>Ever again!</i>

233
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:36,694
With a bomb like that we could, like,
blow up the entire East-Side.

234
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,623
We could take all fucking burrow! Huh?

235
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:41,371
This place could be mine!

236
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:43,466
<i>Whatever was left behind, yes...</i>

237
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:45,726
...would be... yours.

238
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:48,550
Do we have a deal?

239
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:54,042
Well... what do you want?
Like, um... a new hat or something?

240
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,263
Move the bomb... off the ship.

241
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,422
Kevin, it's your Mom!

242
00:33:17,743 --> 00:33:20,318
What's the secret password?

243
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:21,955
Kevin, open the door.

244
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:24,231
Hurry up!

245
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:34,372
- Hey-hey-hey...
- Bronco Spacestar!! - Oi...

246
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,395
Kevin, no!

247
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:39,937
Put me down!

248
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:42,455
Kevin, no. Kevin, NO!!

249
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,770
- Shit!
- VOW!!

250
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:49,474
[...] now!

251
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,300
Sorry.

252
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:02,638
- Are you alright?
- Never felt better in my life.

253
00:34:04,026 --> 00:34:10,255
Um.. my son thought you were a toy.
Bronco Spacestar is his favorite TV show.

254
00:34:11,652 --> 00:34:12,874
What is it, Mom?

255
00:34:13,603 --> 00:34:16,877
It's... a little man, Kevin.

256
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:23,059
So, ahh... where did you come from?

257
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:27,059
How did you get here?

258
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:32,242
The last thing I remember I was chasing...

259
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:34,835
...Sprug, into the Energy Bands.

260
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:38,733
Energy bands?

261
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,145
Mom! He's an alien.

262
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:51,330
Alien? No.

263
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,943
What planet do you come from? Mars?

264
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:56,894
- Venus?
- Arturos.

265
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,352
- Arturo? Of course!

266
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:04,258
Honey, he's not an alien.
He-he is a small man who g... got lost.

267
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,236
- Vow!
- Jesus! - Vow!

268
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:13,792
I want one of those, Mom.

269
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:17,788
Give me that gun.

270
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:21,261
- No way.
- Give me the gun!

271
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,743
I will not have guns in my house!

272
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,735
Alright. Don't pull that thing out again.

273
00:35:33,544 --> 00:35:35,043
When will this nightmare be over?

274
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,357
It's not a nightmare.

275
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,210
Then what the hell is it?

276
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,472
It's the South Bronx.

277
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:03,031
- How are we doing?
- Eh, the rich get richer, Braxton.

278
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:04,710
That's the plan.

279
00:36:21,663 --> 00:36:22,899
What the fuck is this?

280
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:25,946
I don't think you told of this...

281
00:36:26,794 --> 00:36:28,114
Oh fuck, man...

282
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:31,967
The fucking pool table!

283
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,550
- It's ruined!
- Who put it on the goddamn pool table? Huh?

284
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,586
You didn't just wipe the blood out of
[...] goddamn [...]?

285
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:42,809
Hey, it wasn't my fault. It was this [...] fault!
It was because of Debi!

286
00:36:43,258 --> 00:36:45,089
Thought I told you not to fuck with Debi.

287
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,838
Hey, she was gone fucking with us.

288
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,431
We were just trying to protected ourselves, <font color="#FFA500">jefe</font>!

289
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,081
She did this to you?
What, do you expect me to believe that?

290
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,711
She had this... this little doll...

291
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:55,439
A little by-man.

292
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,928
What the fuck are you talking about?

293
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:01,949
Well, this guy, this little guy who just jumped
out, man - and started shooting everybody!

294
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:05,330
- He burned the Hector's [...].
- You tell me a midget did this to you?

295
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:08,019
No, it was no midget, <font color="#FFA500">pendejo via</font>!

296
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:13,289
- A little guy, like this much [...].
- Take another fucking drink, Jackson.

297
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,569
- [...]
- You shut the fuck up, I'm trying to think!

298
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,156
Fuck, what you made me do?

299
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:31,530
See, that's what happens when people start
taking things upon themselves!

300
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:35,043
Anybody else got any bright ideas?!
You got a fucking bright ideas, huh?

301
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,586
What about you, you got a bright idea? HUH?!

302
00:37:38,793 --> 00:37:40,349
<i>I have an idea.</i>

303
00:37:50,421 --> 00:37:52,377
It's not his little voice.

304
00:37:53,398 --> 00:37:54,773
This better be good head.

305
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,871
There is only one person who can stop you
once I give you the dimensional bomb.

306
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,354
Brick Bardo.

307
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,377
What's a Brick Bardo?

308
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:06,109
It's an asshole cop from my world.

309
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:07,528
He followed me here.

310
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:09,078
Well, how do you know it's him?

311
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:13,559
There is only one weapon in the universe
that can destroy atomic matter like that.

312
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,513
It's dangerous to me...

313
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,073
...and to you too.

314
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:22,233
If I were you, I'd go out and kill him right now.

315
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:25,789
Oh yeah? Well, if I was you, I'd quit
while I was a head.

316
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,700
Take how it looks?

317
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,363
That guy moves into your territory,
blows away your two men?

318
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:33,773
I know, I would not like it,

319
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,501
He is not showing you proper respect.

320
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,840
People would think you've lost control.

321
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:45,137
[...] this guy is a cop, huh?

322
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,243
Yeah.

323
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,955
I'm gonna go to Debi's.

324
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:52,800
I'm gonna show this cop is
wrong fucking neighbourhood.

325
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:55,083
You stay here and clean up this mess.

326
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:58,382
And give a fucking brain something to eat.

327
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:02,401
No fucking shit, asshole.

328
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:11,424
Get this fucking body out of here!

329
00:39:30,536 --> 00:39:33,938
Mister, are you sure you know
what you are doing?

330
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:37,973
Isn't it past your bedtime, kid?

331
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:41,592
No power, that's your problem, Mister.

332
00:39:43,286 --> 00:39:44,771
No, kiddo.

333
00:39:45,187 --> 00:39:47,309
What size batteries does this thing take?

334
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:50,582
Look, kid, I'm a little busy right now, so...

335
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:52,467
...get the hell away from me, huh?

336
00:39:52,762 --> 00:39:56,005
Are all people on your planet assholes like you?

337
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:57,513
Sometimes.

338
00:39:57,915 --> 00:40:00,584
Hey, I know somebody that can help you.

339
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:45,884
The show is over. Good night.

340
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,204
Get out of my apartment.

341
00:40:48,497 --> 00:40:50,290
Come on, out, out!

342
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:53,949
<font color="#FFA500">Señora, fuera, fuera [...] permento!</font>

343
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,036
What are you kids, deaf? Go, get out! Now!

344
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,042
Kevin, I want to talk to you.

345
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:01,857
Goodnight! Goodbye!

346
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,345
Hello, get OUT!! Get out of my house!

347
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,490
Get away from this ship, it's not a toy.

348
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:17,533
Obviously.

349
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,987
This is my best friend Gerald.

350
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,958
He is a brainter.

351
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:24,766
What?! I said, get away from my ship!

352
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:26,877
Quite aggressive, isn't he?

353
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:28,546
<i>Kind of jerk.</i>

354
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:32,935
Gerald, you too. Good night.

355
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:35,593
- But...
- But "but" nothing. It's late.

356
00:41:37,373 --> 00:41:38,330
Kevin...

357
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:42,644
Did I tell you to tell everybody in the neighborhood
that we have a space man living in our house?

358
00:41:42,724 --> 00:41:44,430
Don't you think we have enough problems?

359
00:41:45,158 --> 00:41:48,862
But Mom, what's the fun of having an alien,
if you can't show it off?

360
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:54,190
Now listen, don't do anything without asking me!

361
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,164
What?!

362
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:01,065
Get the gun out of my face!
What did I just tell you?

363
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,049
Kevin, how are you doing?

364
00:42:05,364 --> 00:42:08,730
Don't touch him!
Braxton... What do you want?

365
00:42:09,335 --> 00:42:11,915
Just paid a visit, see how you're doing.

366
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,565
Looking good. You want
some money or something?

367
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:19,368
Don't want your money. I don't want anything from you.
Just get these people out of my house, Braxton!

368
00:42:19,448 --> 00:42:22,185
I'm looking for your friend. The midget.

369
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:24,327
I told you he's not a midget!

370
00:42:24,407 --> 00:42:27,007
- Shut the fuck up!
- Look, I don't know who you're talking about!

371
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,659
Look, don't fuck with me, Debi.

372
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,257
<i>This Snowman of yours hitted my boys.</i>

373
00:42:31,337 --> 00:42:34,699
Braxton! Leave. Us. Alone!

374
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:36,905
Where is he?

375
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,587
Looks just like it's his!

376
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,121
Oh fuck!

377
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,300
- It's about the size, you know.
- No!

378
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,430
Jesus Christ...

379
00:43:39,643 --> 00:43:41,157
Oh fuck...

380
00:44:00,445 --> 00:44:02,365
A little paint and you'd be just like brand new.

381
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:16,241
[...] isn't it?

382
00:44:19,811 --> 00:44:21,436
But things don't change.

383
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:24,388
People don't.

384
00:44:27,961 --> 00:44:29,780
I'm gonna loose, aren't I?

385
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:32,335
Only if you give up, lady.

386
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:37,690
Thanks.

387
00:44:38,866 --> 00:44:42,973
Mommy! Mommy!

388
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,906
What is it, honey?

389
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:50,406
Oh, baby...

390
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:57,772
The bad men are gone...

391
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:01,734
It's alright. Shhh...

392
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,628
Is a bad dream, honey. Go back to sleep.

393
00:45:28,337 --> 00:45:30,141
Oh, Brax, what's up, man?

394
00:45:31,868 --> 00:45:33,410
What the fuck?

395
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,676
But not like this...

396
00:45:39,372 --> 00:45:40,898
I see you've met Brick.

397
00:45:44,438 --> 00:45:47,062
I had some experience with
his blaster damage.

398
00:45:47,721 --> 00:45:51,860
I can stop the bleeding by fusing
the molecules in a sonic proton wash.

399
00:45:52,438 --> 00:45:53,841
If there is no internal bleeding...

400
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:55,781
...you're a live man!

401
00:45:56,576 --> 00:46:00,245
- Do it!
- Not so fast. You promise to help me.

402
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:02,206
I want that help now, tonight.

403
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:05,606
It's too dangerous, you know.
I'm tired of being small.

404
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:07,295
I want my ship prepared...

405
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:09,473
and I want to leave, fast.

406
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,540
Do we have understanding?

407
00:46:12,164 --> 00:46:14,573
Yo, whatever you say.
Just fucking do it!

408
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:39,345
Hey, you pretty fucking good!

409
00:46:46,712 --> 00:46:47,544
Hey...

410
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,595
...you promise me a bomb.
First show it to me, or there's no deal.

411
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:54,144
It's right behind me.

412
00:46:55,344 --> 00:46:56,719
All you do...

413
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,440
...is push the button.

414
00:47:06,292 --> 00:47:07,639
Ten seconds later...

415
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:10,069
Boom!

416
00:47:10,456 --> 00:47:13,969
Everything within three parsecs
is sent to another dimension forever.

417
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:16,399
But that's for later.

418
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,737
After you've done everything I need.

419
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,567
From now on, you work for me.

420
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,921
- You'll do what you say.
- Work for you?

421
00:47:42,247 --> 00:47:44,643
You're In the wrong fucking
neighborhood, deadhead.

422
00:47:57,835 --> 00:47:59,817
Call mommies together, we're going to war.

423
00:48:00,737 --> 00:48:03,619
- With who?
- With the fucking doll, man, who else?

424
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:07,003
[...] the other guy,
he almost killed you.

425
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:09,590
So the fuck what? We got a dimensional bomb.

426
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,349
We gonna settle this fuck-up once and for all.

427
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:16,901
The [...] bomb.

428
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:34,110
If you're cold, you can put this on. It's warm.

429
00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:38,605
No, thanks.

430
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,193
Alright.

431
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:01,080
So, do you have a family back home?

432
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:03,896
- Not anymore.
- But you used to?

433
00:49:04,446 --> 00:49:06,208
Mind if I get a little sleep?

434
00:49:06,953 --> 00:49:08,287
Sorry.

435
00:49:10,086 --> 00:49:11,406
Good night.

436
00:49:15,012 --> 00:49:16,830
I had a wife and two kids.

437
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:21,574
Baby girl...

438
00:49:22,763 --> 00:49:24,244
...a boy about Kevin's age.

439
00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:28,273
Someone who wanted to hurt me,
did it by hurting them.

440
00:49:31,665 --> 00:49:33,857
Kevin's father is dead, too.

441
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:37,353
He was shot, holding up a liquor store, years ago.

442
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:39,294
Kevin doesn't even remember him.

443
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,150
He was a gangbanger, Brooklyn Homeboy.

444
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:45,041
And at the time I thought...

445
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:47,264
...Homeboy was as cool as you can get.

446
00:49:49,776 --> 00:49:55,303
And then when Kevin was born, he swore he was
done with gangs, done with crime. But... he lied.

447
00:49:56,147 --> 00:49:57,091
I don't know, it's like...

448
00:49:57,171 --> 00:50:02,510
...in this neighborhood gangs are the only way you
can be noticed, the only way you can be somebody.

449
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:04,817
And they give you a new name,

450
00:50:04,897 --> 00:50:09,811
and then you are Shorty, or Sleepy, or Psycho...
Gangs give you an identity.

451
00:50:12,082 --> 00:50:14,732
I didn't know how hard it is keeping Kevin away...

452
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:16,577
his friends already belonged...

453
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:19,303
Was trying then...

454
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,181
...I'm gonna lose him if I don't
do something about it.

455
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,065
So why didn't you leave?

456
00:50:27,038 --> 00:50:28,536
Where... would I go?

457
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:32,034
I don't have any money,
I can't even pay the rent.

458
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:34,526
Dropped out of school to have Kevin.

459
00:50:35,245 --> 00:50:40,578
Besides, this is my home. This is where I grew up,
everything I've ever known is here. I'm not gonna run away.

460
00:50:41,088 --> 00:50:44,008
You've got a lot of guts. lady. But maybe
you're using the wrong approach.

461
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:47,347
What do you mean?

462
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:48,744
Fight fire with fire.

463
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:52,153
I always thought you fight fire with water?

464
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,515
Some fires are too big.

465
00:51:14,952 --> 00:51:16,561
Kevin, leave him alone.

466
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,732
Kev, get it and gear, you're late.

467
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:26,551
Have a good day at school.
Be careful. I love you. Bye.

468
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:30,973
Oh, hi.

469
00:51:31,235 --> 00:51:33,841
Here is my number at work,
in case you need to call.

470
00:51:34,567 --> 00:51:38,336
I don't think going to work is such a great idea,
if those punks are looking for you.

471
00:51:40,216 --> 00:51:42,540
Well, if I don't go to work, I don't get paid.

472
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:44,824
If I don't get paid, I can't pay the rent.

473
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:48,234
And there is nothing to eat, so...
I'm going to work.

474
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:50,414
I think you should stay in, though.

475
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,573
The world isn't safe for someone your size.

476
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,108
I'll be home at 7.

477
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:59,592
- Kevin will be home around 3.30.
- Look, lady, I'm gonna find the rest of these punks...

478
00:52:00,768 --> 00:52:01,991
...and finish this.

479
00:52:03,890 --> 00:52:05,124
No, you're not.

480
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:07,679
Got to do what I got to do, lady.

481
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:16,613
Be careful out there, Debi.

482
00:53:02,503 --> 00:53:06,082
So you're trying to tell me that 13-inch man
saved your ass from Braxton?

483
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:10,829
Yes. I thought it was like a hallucination
or something that I must... I mean...

484
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:14,198
I don't know, what I'm gonna do with him.

485
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:19,390
Ah, a 13-inch man.
Are you sure it was not a dream?

486
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,088
I'm serious.

487
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:23,727
Come over tonight and see him for yourself.

488
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:33,489
I would like to see a 13-inch man...

489
00:53:34,893 --> 00:53:36,336
You know what I mean...

490
00:53:36,537 --> 00:53:38,140
I wonder where he came from...

491
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,070
...and what to do [...]?

492
00:53:42,101 --> 00:53:44,251
What's so funny, ladies?

493
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:46,233
Nothing's funny, sir.

494
00:53:48,062 --> 00:53:50,726
Nothing's funny but thew toxic waste, Mr. [...]

495
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:55,119
Well, then keep back to wooork!
You're way too high!

496
00:53:56,564 --> 00:53:58,284
What's his problem?

497
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:04,406
Hmm, he asked me out to Guns'n'Roses concert.

498
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:07,620
...till I might take that mutants slain from work.

499
00:54:08,601 --> 00:54:10,709
- He didn't!
- Yeah!

500
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,971
What the fuck are we waiting for?

501
00:54:22,776 --> 00:54:24,343
We wait because I said we wait.

502
00:54:29,194 --> 00:54:31,816
We can [...] with this bitch.

503
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:33,510
Well, it's about time.

504
00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:39,528
Fuck, man.

505
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:41,256
What's the matter?

506
00:54:41,766 --> 00:54:44,923
- Oh, fuck!
- Yo, I thought that little guy fixed you.

507
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,790
I hope he didn't go home.

508
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:21,336
Not without his ship.

509
00:55:21,701 --> 00:55:25,031
You know, there does not seem to be
much structural damage.

510
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:27,634
Maybe if I just adjust this... [...]...

511
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:29,546
Back away, Gerald.

512
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:33,302
I think he suffers from Napoleonic syndrome.

513
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,356
- What?!

514
00:55:35,564 --> 00:55:36,977
Short man's complex.

515
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,980
So... how long do you think this guy
gotta stay with us?

516
00:55:56,777 --> 00:55:57,845
I don't know.

517
00:55:58,095 --> 00:56:02,031
I don't know. His spaceship doesn't work,
so he can't really go anywhere.

518
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,347
- Guess he's stuck here.
- You want him to stay though, don't you?

519
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:07,124
<font color="#FFA500">- Señora Alejandro?</font>

520
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:10,506
<font color="#FFA500">- Ah, señora Rodriguez, Que tal?
- Bien, ¡oiga!...</font>

521
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:13,149
...I heard about this doll-man.

522
00:56:13,229 --> 00:56:17,743
...that he blew away Braxton's Red Homies
last night, <font color="#FFA500">es eso cierto?</font>

523
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:19,480
Yeah, it's true.

524
00:56:21,408 --> 00:56:25,750
<font color="#FFA500">¡Oiga! E cuando Se</font> next meeting of
Neighbourhood Watch?

525
00:56:26,604 --> 00:56:29,281
Thursday, 7:30 at the cafeteria.

526
00:56:30,294 --> 00:56:31,950
- I'll be there!
- Really?

527
00:56:32,293 --> 00:56:33,417
<font color="#FFA500">- Si!</font>

528
00:56:33,884 --> 00:56:37,703
Vivian, you know we can make a difference.
We can CHANGE this neighborhood.

529
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:43,667
Especially with this doll-man blowing away
all the scumbags for us, eh?

530
00:56:46,797 --> 00:56:49,493
That's not the way
I wanted this to work out.

531
00:57:04,948 --> 00:57:07,049
- I'll go, friend.
- See ya.

532
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,617
[...] later to see your doll.

533
00:57:27,232 --> 00:57:29,271
Braxton! Ah! Leave me alone!

534
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:32,391
- Or what? Your little friend gonna kick my ass, huh?
- Help! Somebody, help!

535
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:35,389
- Put her in the car!
- We'll gonna stop you, you son of a bitch!

536
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:47,968
Get away! ALL OF YOU!!

537
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:53,815
Get off!

538
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:00,310
- Kevin, where's the doll?
- Braxton got your mom downstairs.

539
00:58:13,362 --> 00:58:15,207
Kevin, get out of my way!

540
00:59:15,787 --> 00:59:19,020
Hear out for the Doll-man, 'cause he's
gonna come looking for her.

541
01:00:22,637 --> 01:00:24,524
Hey, can you spare a smoke, man?

542
01:00:41,272 --> 01:00:42,243
Sit down.

543
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:34,099
Stop this, Braxton. You're hurt.

544
01:01:36,956 --> 01:01:39,148
The fuck do you care?

545
01:01:40,792 --> 01:01:41,902
Yeah...

546
01:02:46,819 --> 01:02:48,387
Don't even think about it!

547
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,613
Braxton, you gonna die
if you don't get some help.

548
01:03:15,554 --> 01:03:20,178
- So I die.
- But you can stop this before you go down.

549
01:03:22,361 --> 01:03:25,496
When you gonna get to what's going on here? Huh?

550
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:30,056
The world gonna go down, Debi,
because that's the man wants it.

551
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,459
Can't you see that? Huh?

552
01:03:33,764 --> 01:03:37,440
You think they care about you?
You think they care about Dalton Avenue, huh?

553
01:03:41,423 --> 01:03:42,658
They don't give a shit.

554
01:03:52,002 --> 01:03:53,694
You're on the wrong fucking side.

555
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:56,388
Sit down.

556
01:03:58,179 --> 01:03:59,538
Don't make me get up.

557
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:07,352
Fucking SIT DOWN!!

558
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:37,479
<i>What the fuck are we fucking waiting for?</i>

559
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:39,782
<i>I mean. fuck this shit!</i>

560
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:43,067
<i>Fuck, man, I'll fucking set up this fucked-up!</i>

561
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:47,697
This little fucker knows what kind of fuck [...]
so let's fuck away from here and fuck him up!

562
01:04:47,777 --> 01:04:51,779
So let's get the fuck out of this fucking [...]

563
01:04:52,503 --> 01:04:55,943
- Does fucking anybody seen anything yet?
<i>- Nothing yet. Come on down here.</i>

564
01:04:58,972 --> 01:04:59,999
Fuck it!

565
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:16,354
Braxton, man, it's been three hours.

566
01:05:16,754 --> 01:05:17,947
He ain't gonna show.

567
01:05:21,324 --> 01:05:23,697
He must have found out what’s waiting for him.

568
01:05:25,424 --> 01:05:26,467
Ahh, fuck him.

569
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:30,017
I'm putting you go [...], huh?

570
01:05:33,438 --> 01:05:34,576
Come on, go.

571
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:34,024
OK, Jim, the punk did not show, so we're
out of here. The van will meet us down here. Over.

572
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:39,252
Got it, homie.

573
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:19,621
And I thought this would gonna be hard.

574
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:30,081
Hey, Jimmer! Jimmer, man, where the fuck are you?
Get down here! We're ready to roll!

575
01:08:13,603 --> 01:08:15,226
What the fuck is going on there?

576
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,209
Urban fucking renewal.

577
01:08:35,225 --> 01:08:36,959
You did the mistake, Debi.

578
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:47,370
A fucking MISTAKE, Debi!

579
01:08:59,464 --> 01:09:02,946
I'll teach you some respect right now.
Do you remember Benny?! HUH?!

580
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:35,118
Whore Debi...

581
01:09:38,236 --> 01:09:42,050
Oh, fuck. I fucking kept you alive!

582
01:09:43,466 --> 01:09:45,796
And you fucking don't RESPECT ME!!

583
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,582
Fucking... bitch...

584
01:09:57,957 --> 01:10:00,205
I'll show you how fucking disrespect me.

585
01:10:01,525 --> 01:10:04,341
NOBODY DISRESPECTS ME!!!

586
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:27,362
Goodbye, Debi.

587
01:10:28,143 --> 01:10:31,014
Why don't you pick up someone your own size,
you fucking puke?

588
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,034
You suck, asshole.

589
01:11:24,422 --> 01:11:28,470
You remind me of a guy I knew back home.
I didn't like him either.

590
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,854
AARRGH, MOTHERFUCKEEER!!

591
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:49,113
Fuck, my gun!

592
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:57,674
Now let's see how you like it,
tiny motherfucker!

593
01:11:59,318 --> 01:12:02,273
No, let's see this like for you, motherfucker.

594
01:12:15,443 --> 01:12:18,677
- Step aside, lady. Let me finish this.
- It's finished.

595
01:12:19,054 --> 01:12:22,592
- Come on, it's finished. Don't you see that?
- He's scum.

596
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:24,868
He does not deserve to live.

597
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,160
Because your family isn't alive, is that it?

598
01:12:28,858 --> 01:12:31,882
Come on, let it go.
Just let it go.

599
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:35,874
- Step aside.
- Okay...

600
01:12:38,395 --> 01:12:40,115
Don't do it for me!

601
01:12:49,942 --> 01:12:51,343
Okay, lady.

602
01:12:52,966 --> 01:12:54,104
You win.

603
01:12:56,446 --> 01:13:00,025
Wrong. Nobody fucking wins.

604
01:13:06,186 --> 01:13:08,004
Is a fusion bomb.

605
01:13:09,592 --> 01:13:10,591
Run!

606
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:13,205
Run!

607
01:14:52,069 --> 01:14:55,592
So Debi, tell me size doesn't count.
