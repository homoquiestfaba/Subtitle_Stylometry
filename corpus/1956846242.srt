00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,955
[radio static]

2
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,916
[Winston Churchill]
Twice in a single generation,

3
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:45,295
the catastrophe of world war
has fallen upon us.

4
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:50,092
Twice in our lifetime
has the long arm of fate

5
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,135
reached out across the oceans

6
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,931
to bring the United States
into the forefront of the battle.

7
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,810
[Franklin D. Roosevelt] Our American
merchant ships must be free

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:04,313
to carry our American goods
into the harbors of our friends.

9
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:10,279
And our American merchant ships
must be protected by our American Navy.

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,450
[Churchill] The brunt of the war
has fallen upon the sailormen,

11
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,787
and we have lost nearly 3,000 lives

12
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:23,000
in a hard, unrelenting struggle,

13
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,670
which goes on night and day

14
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,883
and is going on now
without a moment's respite.

15
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:34,845
[Roosevelt] The goods will be
delivered by this nation,

16
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,682
whose navy believes in the tradition

17
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:42,352
of "damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead."

18
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,706
[thunder rumbling]

19
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:12,943
[man] "Dear Lord,
let your holy angel be with me,

20
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:17,739
that the evil foe may have no power
over me. Amen."

21
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,915
[water running]

22
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,752
[water stops]

23
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,562
- [piano music]
- [chattering]

24
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,647
Merry Christmas.

25
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,777
[chattering continues]

26
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,711
[woman] Merry Christmas.

27
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,296
Cigars?

28
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,386
"Yesterday, today and forever."

29
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,389
That's beautiful. I'll put it on my tree.

30
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,602
[sighs] All right. Your turn. Come on.

31
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:29,895
All right.

32
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,195
Monogrammed.

33
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:42,658
What's this?

34
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,370
Congratulations.

35
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,872
Your first command. At last.

36
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,415
Aw.

37
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:55,712
After all those years of being fitted
and retained, a Fletcher-class destroyer.

38
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,256
You deserve it.

39
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,509
I knew after Pearl Harbor
they would be needing men like you.

40
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,137
I report to Norfolk
right after the first of the year.

41
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,516
Norfolk? Not Treasure Island?

42
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,518
That's the navy in a nutshell, isn't it?

43
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,228
Yeah.

44
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,357
Then the Caribbean
for training and tactics.

45
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,944
Jamaica, the Bahamas, Cuba.
Rum and Coca-Cola.

46
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,238
- Mm.
- Then active duty.

47
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,740
Come with me.

48
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,534
[chuckles]

49
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,994
I mean it.

50
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,583
So I can ask you to marry me
on a tropical beach.

51
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,547
Oh, I'd like that, but we can't.

52
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,843
The world has gone crazy, Ernie.

53
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,137
Let's wait until we can be together.

54
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:05,532
I will always be looking for you, Evie.

55
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,160
No matter where I am.

56
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,788
Even if I'm a thousand miles away,

57
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,042
I will be hoping I'll see you
come around the corner.

58
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,547
Because when you do, it's...
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

59
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,204
- Morning.
- [men] Morning, Captain.

60
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,873
Charlie, how are the overnights?

61
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,542
Convoy's three days into the Pit.

62
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,253
No contacts, no incidents,
except on your ship, sir.

63
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,881
Two bored sailors with time
on their hands, which became fists.

64
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,967
- Who?
- Shannon and Flusser.

65
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,386
- Crew's getting nervous, Ernie.
- Sleep well, sir?

66
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,180
I've never had the gift
for sleeping on board.

67
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,933
Hmm. And I can't sleep anywhere else, sir.

68
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,232
- Amen.
- [man] Amen.

69
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,609
Sea's a bit high to serve hot food.

70
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,862
I could manage a ham steak
and eggs for you, sir.

71
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,239
- This will do. Thank you, Cleveland.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

72
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,120
Report to the commanding officer.
Clear the room.

73
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,211
Uncover.

74
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,387
[sighs]

75
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,144
Explain yourselves.

76
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,105
Flusser.

77
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,024
I regret the incident, sir.

78
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,818
Shannon.

79
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,071
I too regret the incident.

80
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,753
I will tolerate no more fisticuffs
on my ship.

81
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,379
So...

82
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:28,217
"restore the relationships you have
damaged and fill me with peace."

83
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,097
Sir?

84
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,227
[man on PA] Captain requested,
bridge, sir. Captain requested, bridge.

85
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,608
Repetition will bring hell
down from on high.

86
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,111
Back to your duties.

87
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,447
Count your blessings.

88
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,158
[man] Captain on the bridge.

89
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,661
[man 2] Aye.

90
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,037
Sir, good morning.

91
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,374
Escorts Eagle and Harry are
out of position, six miles from convoy.

92
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,919
They've been off on their own, sir,
for roughly two hours.

93
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,368
Eagle skipper announced,
"Starting the day with a good hunt," sir,

94
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,726
and then Harry joined in.

95
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:33,834
[messenger]
Message from the commodore, sir.

96
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,325
Read it out.

97
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,413
"Comconvoy to Comescort.
H-U-F-F D-U-F-F"...

98
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,749
"Huff Duff." High-frequency
direction finding. Continue, please.

99
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,254
"Huff Duff reports a German transmission
bearing 087 degrees.

100
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,548
Range 15 to 20 miles."

101
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,425
Commodore says a likely U-boat, sir.

102
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,183
"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."

103
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,946
"Comescort to Comconvoy.
Will run it down."

104
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,537
Wait, wait. "Will run it down. Thank you."

105
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,955
"Will run it down. Thank you."
Aye, aye, sir.

106
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,523
- Mister Carling, I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

107
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,650
All ahead full. Make turns for 36 knots.

108
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,403
All ahead full.
Make turns for 36 knots. Aye, sir.

109
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,363
Right standard rudder, 079.

110
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,657
[helmsman] Right standard rudder to 079.
Aye, aye, sir.

111
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,623
All escorts, Greyhound.
Return to your stations immediately.

112
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:27,753
We have enemy contact bearing 087,
range 15 to 20 miles.

113
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,272
- [man 1] Aye, sir.
- [man 2] Aye, aye, sir.

114
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,056
- [man 3] Aye, Greyhound.
- Dicky, Greyhound.

115
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,384
- Dicky, sir.
- Modify your station to assist the convoy

116
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,761
on the starboard side.

117
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,347
Stragglers are mistiming
the course change.

118
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,266
Keep your sonar on that starboard flank.

119
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,602
[Dicky]
Aye, sir. Sonar, starboard flank.

120
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,895
[Ernie]
Right full rudder, 087.

121
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,105
[helmsman] Right full rudder to 087.
Aye, aye, sir.

122
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,989
- Bring us up to general quarters.
- Boatswain, sound general quarters.

123
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,612
[siren blaring]

124
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,757
General quarters, general quarters...

125
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,717
- [man] Move. Let's go.
- All hands, man your battle stations.

126
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,868
We are running down
a possible U-boat contact.

127
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:04,581
[siren continues blaring]

128
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,763
[man 1] Let's hammer
those sons of bitches.

129
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,295
[man 2] Keep 'em coming, Cleveland.

130
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,426
[Ernie] Eagle, Greyhound. Take
my position at the front of the convoy.

131
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,970
We're pursuing the target.

132
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,888
Dicky, Greyhound. Cover the right flank.

133
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,890
[Eagle] Front of convoy. Aye, aye, sir.

134
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,892
[Dicky] Aye, sir. Covering right flank.

135
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,144
Eagle, Harry, Greyhound.

136
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,438
What is your ETA
for resuming new stations?

137
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,733
Greyhound, Eagle.
We can be at our station in 20 minutes.

138
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,696
Harry, sir. We're now four miles
to port of the convoy.

139
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,908
Yes, I know, Harry.
Return to your station at best speed.

140
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,995
Sir, I relieved Mister Carling.
Have the deck and the conn.

141
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,790
Mister Watson, we have a target
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

142
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,977
- I have the conn.
- Aye, aye, sir. Captain has the conn.

143
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,294
- [Ernie] Messenger.
- Sir.

144
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,689
Go to my cabin and bring me
my sheepskin coat. You'll find it.

145
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,714
Aye, aye, sir.

146
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,758
Combat, Conn. Charlie.

147
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:01,638
We're running down a likely sub
bearing 087, range 15 to 20 miles.

148
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:04,308
I'm hoping it shows up
on your surface radar.

149
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,727
Conn, Combat. Aye, aye, sir.

150
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,275
[man blowing pipe]

151
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:15,611
[blowing stops]

152
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,613
Now hear this, now hear this.

153
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,158
This is the captain.

154
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,910
We are running down the target.

155
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:26,580
Let us attend our duties well.
This is what we've trained for.

156
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,916
- Martin, what you got?
- Nothing yet, sir.

157
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,844
- [clicking]
- [Martin] Got him.

158
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:47,267
Conn, Combat. Target bearing 092,
range 15 miles.

159
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,144
Charlie, what do you make of this target?

160
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,979
Most likely a U-boat, sir.

161
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,525
Up for air and a battery charge.
Gettin' ready to come at us, Captain.

162
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,988
[Watson]
Steady on 092, sir.

163
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,698
Very well.

164
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:11,708
Conn, Combat. Target bearing steady
at 094, range 12 miles.

165
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:14,795
Weapons, pass the word,
do not open fire without orders from me.

166
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,761
Range 11 miles, bearing steady on 094.

167
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:25,681
Range 11 miles, bearing steady on 094.

168
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:30,394
[helmsman whistling]

169
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,023
[Watson] Stop that noise.

170
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,527
Range 9.5 miles, bearing steady on 094.

171
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,781
Close enough for the five-inch, sir.

172
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,160
Heavy seas, Mister Watson,
with only a radar bearing.

173
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,788
Let's have our eyes on him.

174
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,873
Aye, aye, sir.

175
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,967
[waves crashing]

176
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:17,274
Target's disappeared, sir.
Fell off the radar about six miles out.

177
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,902
What's this, Charlie?

178
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,754
Looks like he's dived, sir,
by the way the pips faded out.

179
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,281
He must've seen us, sir.
Got his air and dove.

180
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,742
Pips had him on course for us
and the convoy, sir.

181
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,368
Can you plot a search radius?

182
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,872
I could, sir, but in ten minutes,
the radius would be three square miles.

183
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,126
Give me a course to intercept

184
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,921
if the target maintains this course
at six knots.

185
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,047
Aye, aye, sir.

186
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,526
Conn, Combat.
Course to intercept is 096.

187
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,570
Warn me two miles out from this intercept.

188
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:04,780
Aye, aye, sir.

189
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,615
Right handsomely, 096.

190
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,909
[helmsman] Right handsomely to 096.
Aye, aye, sir.

191
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:28,463
[Watson] Combat reports
two miles from intercept, sir.

192
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,266
Mister Watson, we need to slow down
for sonar. Make turns for 22 knots.

193
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,229
[Watson] Make turns for 22 knots,
aye, aye, sir.

194
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,228
All ahead standard.
Make turns at 22 knots.

195
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,691
Here we go, boys.

196
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,086
[talker] We're at sonar speed.

199
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,665
Put that on the radiator.

200
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:58,458
Sir, message from the Admiralty.

201
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,170

[sonar pinging continues]

203
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:06,592
What do you hear?

204
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:10,053
Contact bearing steady at 091.

205
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,347
He's turned.
Looks like he's running from us, sir.

206
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:13,432
Any screw noises?

207
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:18,145
[pinging continues]

208
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:22,274

00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,256

00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,810
This is the captain.
It seems we sank that target.

312
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,103
This was an all-hands job.

314
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,398
[Ernie] Well done.

Secure from general quarters.
Take us to Condition 3

316
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,863
and arrange for hot food
if at all possible.

317
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:25,948
Aye, aye, sir.

318
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,116
Secure from general quarters.

319
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,160

320
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:34,414

00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:37,835
[Eagle] Congratulations, Captain.
More food for the fish.

322
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,336
[Harry] The prize is yours, sir,

323
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,672
but we'll need evidence of a kill
for the Admiralty.

324
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,258
Nothin' but the captain's trousers
will do, I'm afraid.

325
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:45,717
Just return to station.

326
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,053
Congratulations, sir.

327
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,639
Shall I steer a course for the debris
to verify the kill?

328
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,767
No, Mister Watson.

329
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,894
Convoy is unguarded.
Take us back to station.

330
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,648
Aye, aye, sir.
Helmsman, bring us back to station.

331
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:01,024
Eppstine, is it?

332
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:02,860
Eppstein, sir.

333
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,903
Good work. Thank you.

334
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,572
It's why I'm aboard, sir.

335
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:11,243
Hey, Cap, pulled this corned beef
and onion, sliced thick for you.

336
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,494
Gotta eat, sir.

337
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:15,330
Nah, take that to Lieutenant Cole.

338
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,249
I bet he's worked up an appetite.

339
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,377
Now, Mister Dawson.

340
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,753
It's from the Admiralty, sir.

341
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,506
They've intercepted
multiple German transmissions.

342
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:25,924
It's at least two hours old.

343
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:30,262
"Enemy activity expected
at Position Oboe."

344
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:47,738
[man] Congratulations, Captain.

345
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:50,115
It's our first U-boat.

346
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,952
Congratulations, sir. Fifty less krauts.

347
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,747
Yes. Fifty souls.

348
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:02,169
Sir, permission to secure
boilers two and four?

349
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,338
Mister Nystrom,
are you not the officer of the deck?

350
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,714
Yes, sir, I am, sir.

351
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:08,078
Then take that to the chief engineer
without bothering me.

352
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,470
Aye, sir.
Uh, our noon position report, sir.

353
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,306
I'm estimating we are at Position Oboe

354
00:25:14,389 --> 00:25:16,350
in the North Atlantic,
surrounded by open sea.

355
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,143
- That about right?
- If you say so, sir.

356
00:25:18,227 --> 00:25:20,729
Take us back to station
ahead of the convoy, center column.

357
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,648
Ahead of convoy, center column. Aye, sir.

358
00:25:24,483 --> 00:25:27,819
Left standard rudder. Steer course 190.

359
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:31,156
[helmsman] Left standard rudder,
steering course 190. Aye, sir.

360
00:25:45,254 --> 00:25:47,381
[helmsman]
rudder. Steer course 270. Aye, sir.

361
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:48,507
Sir.

362
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,927
Your helmet, sir.
Shall I see it stowed away?

363
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,222
Yes, thank you.

364
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,394
[man] Sir,

365
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,730
noon fuel reports will be slightly off
due to that U-boat chase.

366
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,250
Still waiting on reports from Dodge,

367
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,026
but Viktor and James are reporting
diminishing reserves.

368
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,444
Send a reply.

369
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:15,367
"Comescort to James. Please use
utmost efforts to conserve fuel."

370
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,493
Aye, sir.

371
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:19,848
Sir, after that last pattern,
now might be a good time

372
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:22,350
to bring up the extra supply of depth
charges stowed in the crew quarters.

373
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,376
- Permission granted. Thank you.
- Aye, sir.

374
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,968

00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,947
[lookout, on radio]
Two distress rockets...

376
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,724
Forward Lookout reports
two distress rockets rear of the convoy.

377
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,101
[Ernie] Reciprocal course.

378
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,729
- Mister Nystrom, I have the conn.
- Captain has the conn.

379
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,113
Where?

380
00:26:53,197 --> 00:26:55,324
There, sir. That's the Despotiko, sir.

381
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:57,492
She's a merchant ship.
Last ship in the line.

382
00:27:02,164 --> 00:27:04,625
Signals report commodore
signaling general alarm, sir.

383
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,960
Mister Nystrom, come left at 200.

384
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:08,962
Alert all escorts,
"I'm going to the rear."

385
00:27:09,046 --> 00:27:12,591
Send in Cadena for rescue
and bring us up to general quarters.

386
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:16,678
[man] General quarters. General quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,924

- Right full rudder.
- Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

392
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,246
Shoot me a bearing
of where that came from.

393
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,437
[man] Yes, sir.

394
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,614
Bearing 160.

395
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:20,492
Charlie,
I'm steering to avoid a single torpedo.

396
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,369
Point of origin, 160.

397
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,914
Mister Nystrom, bring us around to port
in a reciprocal course

398
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:27,124
into screening position.

399
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,209
Put us between Cadena and that U-boat.

400
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,713
- Screen Cadena. Aye. Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder. Aye, sir.

401
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,089
[Nystrom] All ahead flank.

[man] Message from Cadena, sir.
She signals rescue completed.

403
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:39,595
Thank you.

404
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:41,805
- Messenger.
- Captain.

405
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:43,807
Write this. "Comescort to Cadena.

406
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,977
Rejoin convoy at best speed.
Modified zigzag."

407
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,478
- Send it.
- Aye, sir.

408
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,823
Distant noises.

Sonar reports distant noises.
Port quarter, bearing indefinite.

410
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:04,953
Assumes it's hull of ship
breaking up, sir.

411
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:07,473
- Sonar, sweep to starboard.
- Sonar, Bridge. Sweep to starboard.

412
00:29:07,497 --> 00:29:10,083
Mister Nystrom, ease the rudder. Meet her.

413
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,793
Maintain this screening position.

414
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,046

Holding this course. Aye, aye, sir.

415
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,384

00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:27,184
Steady at ten degrees, sir.

418
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,229
- Steady as you go.
- [helmsman] Steady as I go.

419
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:32,032
[messenger]
Return message from Cadena, sir.

00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:36,610
She's two hours from convoy, sir.
Reports 42 men rescued from Despotiko.

421
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,530
Very well. Thank you.

422
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:41,593
[Charlie] Skipper, we're freezing up.

423
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,385
I've given orders for the steam hoses
to keep the depth charges clear.

424
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,954
Greyhound, Harry. Greyhound, Harry.

425
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:48,705
Greyhound.

426
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,250
Pips on the radar screen,
bearing 091, sir.

427
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,627
Looks like two subs
directly ahead of the convoy.

00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,921
- Range 10 miles.
- Harry has two contacts, 10 miles.

00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,634
We got a pip, bearing 098, range 14 miles.

431
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,387
Greyhound, Eagle.
We've got Harry's pip, sir, and another.

00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,640
Bearing 090, range 13 miles.

433
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,351
Very well. Four contacts now.

438
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,901
dead ahead of the convoy.

439
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,946
Greyhound, Harry.
Nine miles to one pip at 090.

440
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,240
The other bearing 092, range eight miles.

441
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,658
Are the ranges closing?

442
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,327
Negative, Greyhound.
They seem to be behaving at present.

443
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,371
Very well. Maintain your stations.

444
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,248
Attack within range and good luck.

445
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,421
A wolf pack shadowing us.
They'll attack as a group.

446
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:41,925
Yeah, waiting for nightfall,
when we can't see nothing.

447
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,345
I need you down below.

448
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,710
Keep an eye on the surface radar
for our friend back here.

449
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:48,849
Aye, aye, sir.

450
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,208
Six subs, guys.
We got a contact report from Eagle?

451
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:16,478
[man] Aye, sir, got 'em all.
They're keeping their distance.

452
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,254
Five ahead of the convoy
and our little dance partner back here,

453
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:22,674
tracking us and the Cadena.
Presumed bearing 196.

454
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:53,583
- Signal from the commodore, sir.
- Read it out.

455
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,749
"Comconvoy to Comescort.

456
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:59,461
Numerous German language transmissions
10 to 15 miles ahead. Various bearings."

457
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,213
Very well.

458
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:04,174
I need the gloves you'll find
in my cabin. The fur, not the knit.

459
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,801
Gloves. Fur, not knit. Aye, aye, sir.

460
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:20,691
[grunts] Chief Rudel,
I need these wipers operating.

461
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:23,026
It's not electrical, sir. They're frozen.

462
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,487
I can put some men on it
with buckets and swabs.

463
00:32:25,571 --> 00:32:27,781
Salt water. Warm salt water, not boiling.

464
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,074
Aye, sir.

465
00:32:30,993 --> 00:32:33,537
Conn, Combat. Looks like our friend's
come up for fresh air

466
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,247
and to maintain speed with us, sir.

467
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,501
Contact bearing 207, range three miles.

468
00:32:39,585 --> 00:32:41,503

[helmsman 2] Hard right rudder to 207.
Aye, sir.

470
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,475
[Martin]
Target now bears 208.

471
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,396
Target now bears 208. Range...

472
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,940
Range looks like 2.5 miles.

473
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,650
Looks like 2.5 miles.

474
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,086
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know, sir.

475
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,278
I can't get a good read.

476
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:10,741
Come right to 220.

477
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,826
[helmsman]
Come right to 220. Aye, sir.

478
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,079
What do you mean, "looks like"?
I need a bearing on this target, Charlie.

479
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:17,706
It's my radar, sir. It's gone soft.

480
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,083
- I need Rudel down here.
- Understood.

481
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:23,045
Have Chief Rudel report to the XO
in the CIC.

482
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:24,880
Mister Lopez, all mounts, local control.

483
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:26,507
- Fire when they bear.
- Aye, aye, sir.

484
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,760
All mounts, local control.
Fire as you bear.

485
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,473
[Martin]
Bearing's changing. Uh, 203. Range...

486
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,434
Contact bearing's changing, 203.

487
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:41,480
- Range looks like 2.5 miles.
- 203, range 2.5 miles.

488
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,190

491
00:33:47,027 --> 00:33:50,364
- [lookout] U-boat, starboard bow!
- [cannons firing]

492
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,835
[talker] Fire Control reports
five-inch mounts opened fire on target.

493
00:34:02,918 --> 00:34:04,920
Eleven rounds fired.
No hits observed, sir.

494
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:06,880
Left standard rudder to 100.

495
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:10,175
- [helmsman] Left standard rudder to 100.
- Messenger, take this to Signals.

496
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:11,552
"Greyhound to Cadena.

497
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:15,138
Must return to station at head of convoy
to engage targets.

498
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:17,056
Fired on U-boat. Drove him under.

499
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,268
Have faith you will outrun him.
Good luck."

500
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:21,395
Send that.

501
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,063
[Rudel] You wanted to see me, sir?

502
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,958
Yeah. What can we do
about this damn interference?

503
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,109
It's not interference, sir.
I checked everything.

504
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,792
The pilot light's on, no surge currents,

505
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,654
and I reset the overload relay
four days ago.

506
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:35,449
I could reset it again, but we're gonna be
down nearly two hours. Waste of time, sir.

507
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:38,411
[radio: buzz]

508
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,541
Bridge.

509
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,252
"The night cometh
when no man can work," Ernie.

510
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,129
Rudel's done all he can.

511
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,340
We're just gonna have to live with
the radar how it is for now, Captain.

512
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:52,509
Understood. Thank you, Charlie.

513
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,920
[wind whistling]

514
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,676
[creaking, rattling]

515
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:41,225
[man on radio] Captain, need to slow
in the sea, or we risk blowing a turbine.

516
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,684
Understood.

517
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:44,937
Mister Harbutt, she can't take it.
Slow us down a bit.

518
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,564
- All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds. Aye, aye, sir.

519
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,858
- Darken the ship.
- [Harbutt] Shift to red.

520
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,253
[Cleveland]
You missed another meal, sir.

521
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,905
Brought you a bacon and egg sandwich,
still warm.

522
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,740
I found some of those peaches you like.

523
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:05,707
Amen.

524
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,792
Amen.

525
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:08,335
I'll keep the coffee coming, sir.

526
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,754
- Coffee, Mister Harbutt?
- Thank you, sir.

527
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:14,675
[distant explosions]

528
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:16,134
[talker] Distress rockets, sir.

529
00:36:16,218 --> 00:36:19,388
Lookouts report gunfire, bearing 046,
range three miles.

530
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:21,265
[explosions continue]

531
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,451
- I'll take it, Mister Harbutt.
- Captain has the conn.

532
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:26,061
- Bring us up to general quarters.
- Boatswain Mate, Condition 1.

533
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,623

the front of the convoy.

534
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:30,440
[man] General quarters, general quarters.

535
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,150
All hands, man your battle stations.

536
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:35,445
Set Condition 1 throughout the ship.
Lock down all watertight passageways.

537
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:38,991
[talker] Combat reports sub bearing 036.
One and a half miles, sir.

538

[Ernie] All mounts, fire at will.

539
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,980
[Lopez] All mounts, fire at will.

540
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:49,835
[lookout] Merchant ship dead ahead!

541
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,965
Check fire!

542
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,968
- Hard left rudder, hard over!
- [Lopez] Check fire! Cease fire!

543
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,823
[Ernie] Right standard rudder!

544
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,909
[helmsman]
Right standard rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

545
00:37:32,878 --> 00:37:34,796
All ahead standard!

546
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,718
Son? You heard the order?

547
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:42,054
All ahead standard. Aye, aye, sir.

548
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,514
All ahead standard!

549
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,977
[lookout] U-boat!

550
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,145
Where?

551
00:37:50,229 --> 00:37:54,358
U-boat bearing 012, range 1,000!
Between us and the freighters!

552
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,985
[explosions]

553
00:38:02,658 --> 00:38:04,743
Check! Check! Check!

554
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:07,162
Mister Lopez,
you have freighters in the line of fire!

555
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:09,831
- [Lopez] Cease fire, cease fire.
- All batteries, check fire!

556
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:11,834
[men] Cease fire! Cease fire!

557
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:19,424
[Ernie] Friendly fire, friendly fire!
They can't see us!

558
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:22,469
[grunting]

559
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:26,390
[screaming]

560
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:31,562
[Ernie] Close up, close up!

561
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:34,064
Man that telegraph!
Get replacements up here!

562
00:38:38,652 --> 00:38:41,172
- Right full rudder, all ahead two-thirds.
- Right full rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

563
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,407
Mister Lopez,
prepare to engage that target.

564
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,177
When he dives, we're gonna hammer him
with two patterns: shallow, then deep.

565
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,119
[Lopez] Aye, sir!

566
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:51,248
[Harbutt] That's the Vasco, sir!
She's an oil tanker. She could blow!

567
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:54,751
Mind your helm across the column!

568
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:56,187
[helmsman]
Minding my helm. Aye, aye, sir.

569
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,523
- Slow to one-third.
- [talker] Slow to one-third. Aye, sir.

570
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,716
- Watch that merchantman.
- Aye, sir.

571
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:06,096
[lookout] He's diving!
U-boat diving, bearing 040.

572
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,389
Range close aboard!

573
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:09,516
- Mister Lopez.
- Aye, sir.

574
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,893
Stand by for shallow pattern.

575
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,728
Stand by for shallow pattern.
Aye, aye, sir!

576
00:39:12,811 --> 00:39:14,646
Sonar, sweep for contact
to starboard beam.

577
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,940
Sonar, Bridge.
Sweep for contact to starboard beam.

578
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,462
Bridge, Sonar. There's too many screws.
I can't hear anything.

579
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:23,614
Sonar reports mixed signals, sir.
Too many propellers.

580
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:25,449
- On my command, Mister Lopez.
- Aye, sir.

581
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,013
Still too many screws.
Interference from the convoy.

582
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,597
Sonar reports too many screws, sir.
Interference from the convoy.

583
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:47,221
[garbled pinging]

584
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:48,555
I got something.

585
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,273
Got 'em. Contact close.
Starboard beam 083.

586
00:39:58,357 --> 00:40:00,484
Sonar reports contact close.
Starboard beam 083, sir.

587
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:02,194
Correction, starboard beam 088, sir.

588
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,320
Now, Mister Lopez!

589
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,989
[Lopez] Fire, fire! Roll two, fire.
Port to starboard.

590
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,623
[Ernie] Next pattern, Mister Lopez.

591
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:15,749
Again, sir?

592
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,292
Yes, again, Mister Lopez!

593
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,838
All positions, fire when ready.
All positions, fire, fire!

594
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,464
Helm, meet her! Head up the lane!

595
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:25,175
[helmsman] Meet her.
Heading up the lane. Aye, aye, sir.

596
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:35,894
[Ernie] Come on.

597
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,314
- Sonar reports contact bearing...
- [sonarman] Correction.

598
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,709
- Correction. Sonar reports...
- Questionable screw noises.

599
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,318
Questionable screw noises.

600
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:45,112
Contact stationary.

601
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:46,822
Sonar reports contact stationary.

602
00:40:46,905 --> 00:40:47,990
Stationary?

603
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,158
Sonar, Bridge. Anything further?

604
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,584
Still stationary. Possible decoy.

605
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:02,921
Sonar reports contact is not moving.
Possible decoy.

606
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:13,974
[explosion]

607
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:18,353
[Harbutt] The tanker, sir!

608
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:33,869
[lookout] Survivors! Men in the water!
Port bow! Port bow!

609
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,622
[talker] Contact.
Bearing starboard 538, 538.

610
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:37,956
Distance 200 yards.

611
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,459
- Mister Harbutt, who's your junior?
- Wallace, sir.

612
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:41,835
Get him out here.

613
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,508
[messenger]
Sir, a message from Cadena.

614
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:48,592
Read it out.

615
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:50,594
"Merchant ships vulnerable
at rear of convoy.

616
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,888
Attack imminent.
Request your earliest assistance."

617
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:58,769
Captain, survivors 500 yards starboard,
sir. Proceed with rescue?

618
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,737
Get down to midships,
put down a scrambling net

619
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,448
- and get those men out of the water.
- [Wallace] Aye, aye, sir.

620
00:42:11,532 --> 00:42:13,659
Stop engines. All slow astern.

621
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,911
Mister Harbutt, you have the conn.

622
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:18,705
Mind the debris and hail me
the moment Wallace has them aboard.

623
00:42:18,789 --> 00:42:20,123
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Signals?

624
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:22,084
- Aye, sir.
- "Comescort to Cadena.

625
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:27,673
Will assist as soon as possible."

626
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,466
Aye, sir.

627
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,561
[man] Give me your hand. Keep climbing.

628
00:42:41,103 --> 00:42:46,191
Krauts call it a Pillenwerfer, sir.
It's German for something.

629
00:42:46,275 --> 00:42:47,568
"Pill-thrower."

630
00:42:47,651 --> 00:42:49,736
- Yes, go on.
- Uh, I'd never heard of one before,

631
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:54,032
but I got a buddy who was on the Kidd,
and he had one on his first crossing.

632
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,077
It's a mechanical decoy
about the size of an icebox,

633
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,204
and it shoots out gas
like an Alka-Seltzer.

634
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:00,914
The krauts just drop it in the water,

635
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:03,333
and it hangs there
while we waste depth charges on it.

636
00:43:04,001 --> 00:43:05,669
Detail it in your after-action report.

637
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:08,130
Make sure all the other operators
are familiar with it.

638
00:43:08,213 --> 00:43:10,090
I... I should've caught it sooner, sir.

639
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,260
No, you did good work. Thank you.

640
00:43:13,343 --> 00:43:14,553
Sir. Aye, sir.

641
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,471
[Charlie] You couldn't have known, Ernie.

642
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,019
[Harbutt] Got 'em, sir. Four men.

643
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,942
- Only four?
- All they could see or hear, sir.

644
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,648
Okay. Head to rear of convoy.
Right hard rudder, hard over.

645
00:43:26,732 --> 00:43:27,774
All ahead two-thirds.

646
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:30,068
[helmsman] Right hard rudder,
hard over. Aye, aye, sir.

647
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,115
[lookout] Rocket!
Distress rocket astern! Rear of convoy!

648
00:43:37,743 --> 00:43:40,204
All ahead flank. Meet her
when we're headed down the lane.

649
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:42,080
[helmsman]
All ahead flank. Aye, aye, sir.

650
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,343
[Harbutt] That's the Southland, sir.
It's an American supply ship.

651
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,450
Greyhound, Harry here.

652
00:44:18,534 --> 00:44:23,080
To confirm, targets remain at speed
just outside our perimeter.

653
00:44:23,747 --> 00:44:26,427
[Harbutt] Southland rescue completed.
Twenty-eight men rescued, sir.

654
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,627
[man] Radar is back up, Captain.

655
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,379
Left full rudder to 087.

656
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,840
Take us up the right side of the convoy.
All ahead standard.

657
00:44:32,923 --> 00:44:34,683
[helmsman]
All ahead standard. Aye, aye, sir.

658
00:44:34,716 --> 00:44:36,677
Engine room answers
all ahead standard, sir.

659
00:44:37,803 --> 00:44:40,180
[radio: static]

660
00:44:40,264 --> 00:44:43,892
Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.

661
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:45,561
This is Gray Wolf.

662
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:52,359
We hunt you and your friends
Eagle, Dicky and Harry.

663
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:56,905
We watch your ships sinking into the deep.

664
00:44:57,656 --> 00:45:02,119
We hear the screams of your comrades
as they die.

665
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:07,583
How many of them will there be
before you join them?

666
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:13,755
The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.

667
00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:17,902
- Your women will learn of your dying...
- Greyhound to all escorts.

668
00:45:17,926 --> 00:45:21,138
- And weep into the long night before...
- Switch TBS traffic to channel Zebra.

669
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,391
- They turn to the arms of their lovers.
- Execute.

670
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:29,563
[howling]

671
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:30,647
[howling stops]

672
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:45,954
Eagle here. Pips on the move.

673

The other at 085, nine miles.

675
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,377
[Charlie] ...that signal.

676
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,004
Greyhound, Dicky. Greyhound, Dicky.

677
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:56,381

Greyhound, Harry.
Our two pips are separated.

680
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,223
Bearing 084 and 095. Both 8.5 miles.

681
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,099
Looks as if they're coming in for a scrum.

682
00:46:06,183 --> 00:46:08,393
Noted, thank you. Greyhound out.

683
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,979
Charlie, did you get the sighting reports?

684
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:12,981
- Yes, sir.

coming across your bow.

687
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:33,752
[Ernie] Dicky, Greyhound.
I see tracer fire over on your side.

688
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:35,504
Are you engaging the target?

689
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,590
[radio chatter]

690
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,740

00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:28,015

Greyhound, Eagle.
Target sighted. Engaging now.

697
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:10,015

We will join you to assist.

698
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:15,771
- Mister Lopez.
- Aye, sir.

699
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:18,649
- Our next pattern will be medium.
- Aye, aye, sir.

700
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:20,776
Lieutenant Fippler,
you better get up here.

701
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,486
Right standard rudder to 210.

702
00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:25,280
[helmsman] Right standard rudder to 210.
Aye, aye, sir.

703
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,115
- Mister Harbutt.
- Sir.

704
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,369
Keep apprised of Eagle's target bearing
and notify me when we're two miles out.

705
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:31,453
Aye, aye, sir.

706
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,253
Sir, it's about the consumption
of depth charges.

707
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:42,130
- Yes?
- Last pattern makes 32 cans fired.

708
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,802
How many full patterns do we have left?

709
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,011
None, sir.

710
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,514
We're down to six charges.

711
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:56,687
We pulled everything from below
last watch, if you recall, sir.

712
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,650
Yes, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mister Flipper.

713
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,652
It's Fippler, sir.

714
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,157
Mister Fippler, we must leave off
the firing of full patterns.

715
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:10,993
What I was gonna suggest, sir.

716
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:23,172
"Wise as a serpent, harmless as a dove."

717
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:26,258
[radio: buzz]

718
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,305
- Captain.
- I know it's risky, Charlie, but

719
00:49:31,388 --> 00:49:32,723
we need to break protocol.

720
00:49:32,806 --> 00:49:36,518
How soon can we reach air cover?
No more zigzags, no evasive maneuvers.

721
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:37,603
Aye, aye, sir.

722
00:49:48,947 --> 00:49:49,948

723
00:49:52,534 --> 00:49:53,368
Go, Charlie.

724
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,704
We can be in range
of air cover in 24 hours.

725
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,165
That's 0800
if we shift to a direct course, sir.

726
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:59,248
Thanks, Charlie.

727
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,133
[Charlie] What happened to him?

728
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,011
Took a header.
Gave me something more to do.

729
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:15,933
- That for the captain?
- Yeah.

730
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,019
Man hasn't had a bite to eat
or been off his feet since we left.

[man] General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

[Dicky] We're turning
to intercept at 16 knots, sir.

733
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:28,129
- We'll do our best to hammer him.
- Understood, Dicky.

734
00:50:28,153 --> 00:50:29,446
Keep him under by all means.

735
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,948

for surface radar bearing 170.

[Watson] Sir, I have the deck
and the conn.

738
00:50:38,789 --> 00:50:41,083
- Very well.
- Mister Watson has the deck and the conn.

739
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,543

749
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:05,291
- I've got it, Mister Watson.
- [Watson] Captain has the conn.

750
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:06,900
Right sharply, another ten degrees.

751

[Ernie] Understood, Dicky.
I am crossing your bow for my own attack.

767
00:52:11,757 --> 00:52:13,425
[radar: garbled beeps]

768
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:15,219

- [glass shatters]
- [man] Take cover!

790
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:05,495

797
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:24,765
Hold your fire.

00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:30,854
- Fire as they bear.
- [helmsman] Aye, sir.

802

- [crewman shouting]
- [man] Get some water in there!

808
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,994
Dicky, Greyhound. What is your damage?

809
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,997
Greyhound, our guns couldn't depress
far enough to do any damage.

810
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:33,125
But, at 20 yards, the shells
went right through us without detonating.

811
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,209
Are you seaworthy?

812
00:55:34,293 --> 00:55:36,146
All three hits
were well above the waterline, sir.

813
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,439
We'll have our holes patched,
and we'll be back in the hunt.

814
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,592
Very good. Return to your
screening station at best speed.

815

00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:05,282
[doctor] Three severely wounded.

819
00:56:05,365 --> 00:56:08,577

824
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,361
[doctor] I've got no room for corpses
down below, sir.

825
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:26,779
Not with the four we pulled from Vasco.

826
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,556
I can arrange for a service
within the next ten minutes, sir.

827
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,559
Of course. All hands.

828
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:33,769
Aye, aye, Captain.

829
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,313
Bill?

830
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,607
How bad was he hit?

831
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,690
Sir?

832
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:41,985

the earthly remains of Anthony Pisani,

looking for the general Resurrection
in their last day

837
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,926
and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

838
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,388
at whose second coming
in glorious majesty to judge the world

839
00:57:09,471 --> 00:57:11,348
the sea shall give up her dead,

840
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:14,101
and corruptible bodies of those
who sleep in him

841
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:17,354
shall be changed
and made like unto his glorious body

842
00:57:17,437 --> 00:57:19,398
according to the m-mighty working

843
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:23,485
whereby he is a-able to subdue
all things unto himself. Amen."

844
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:28,657
All stop.

845
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,200
XO commands all stop.

846
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:32,452
- [talker 2] All stop.
- [helmsman] All stop, aye.

847
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:38,750
[blowing pipe]

848
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,627
[man]
Now, all hands, bury the dead.

849
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:43,172
- Now, all hands, bury the dead.
- [bell rings]

850
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,717
[ringing]

851
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:51,555
Ship's company. Attention!

852
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:55,767
Salute!

853
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:01,398
Firing line, half right, face!

854
00:58:02,024 --> 00:58:04,902
Anthony Pisani,
gunner's mate, third class.

855
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:06,945
Ready. Fire!

856
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:12,534
Daniel Marx, seaman, second. Ready. Fire!

857
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,208
George Cleveland, messmate. Ready. Fire!

858
00:58:26,882 --> 00:58:28,050
[water splashes]

859
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,385
[officer] Ready. Two!

860
00:58:40,771 --> 00:58:43,023
[lookout]
Distress rocket at rear of convoy!

861
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:46,503
- Left standard rudder.
- Left standard rudder. Aye, sir.

862
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:49,363
Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
Eagle has been hit.

863
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:54,409
I am going to his aid, rear of the convoy.
Maintain your sweep. Go easy on your fuel.

864
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:56,328
- [Dicky] Aye, sir.
- [Harry] Aye, aye, sir.

865
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:05,212
- Messenger, my glasses.
- Aye, sir.

866
00:59:05,295 --> 00:59:08,006
- Meet her.
- [helmsman] Aye, sir. Heading up the lane.

867
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:11,218
- [Ernie] Right standard rudder.
- Right standard rudder. Aye, sir.

868
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,826
- Meet her.
- [helmsman] Meet her.

869
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:20,060
- All ahead flank.
- All ahead flank. Aye, sir.

870
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:37,077
- Messenger.
- Sir.

871
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:46,409
- [Ernie] Mister Harbutt.
- Sir.

872
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,546
That's Eagle and Cadena.

873
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:49,464
Circle them at one mile
to cover the rescue.

874
00:59:49,548 --> 00:59:53,427
- Helm, left standard rudder. Come to 225.
- Left standard rudder...

875
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,054
Eagle, Greyhound. What is your status?

876
00:59:56,847 --> 00:59:59,516
We were hit forward of the engine room
and have a fire below deck.

877
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,809
Some casualties.

878
01:00:01,435 --> 01:00:04,354
The Kong Gustav was hit first,
sank in three minutes.

879
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,689
We saw no survivors.

880
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:07,816
It's a bad afternoon, sir.

881
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:10,152
How seaworthy are you?

882
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:14,007
We have a five-degree list at starboard,
and we're down at the stern,

883
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,074
but we'll tow all right up to five knots.

884
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:18,911
We have a flap of plate sticking up,
scooping in the sea.

885
01:00:18,994 --> 01:00:21,163
The list gets worse if we make any speed.

886
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:23,957
We must keep you afloat, Eagle.

887
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,460
We'll do all the sea allows, sir.

888
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,671
Very well. Greyhound out.

889
01:00:57,241 --> 01:00:58,992
[Carling] I'm ready to relieve you, sir.

890
01:00:59,076 --> 01:01:01,370
[Harbutt] Very well.
We're steady on course 225.

891
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,997
And we're at standard speed
with fuel conservation.

892
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,582
[Carling] I relieve you, sir.

893
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,461
[Harbutt] Sir?

894
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:13,215
Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck and the conn.

895
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:14,758
Very well.

896
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:18,846
Mister Carling,
Cadena has Eagle under tow at four knots.

897
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:21,974
Continue circling.
We'll hold the screen at rear of convoy.

898
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:24,935
Sonar, standard sweep to starboard.

899
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,771
Sonar, Bridge.
Search to starboard, standard pattern.

900
01:01:41,451 --> 01:01:43,996
Greyhound, Eagle. Greyhound, Eagle.

901
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,127
Greyhound.

902
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,379
Request permission to abandon ship, sir.

903
01:01:53,046 --> 01:01:55,090
The collision mats were not big enough.

904
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:58,468
We have a 15-degree list now,
and the main deck is underwater.

905
01:01:59,094 --> 01:02:02,181
Well, I'm sure you've done all you could.
Permission granted.

906
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:06,185
She's been a good home, sir.
It's been an honor sailing with you.

907
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,437
We'll be praying for you.
Godspeed, Captain.

908
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,689
Thank you for a job well done.

909
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:33,587
Thank you, Cleveland.

910
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:35,631
I'm Pitts, sir.

911
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:38,592
- Thank you.
- Sir.

912
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:54,191
I need Mister Cole.

913
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,364
[man] XO requested, bridge.
XO requested, bridge.

914
01:03:04,535 --> 01:03:05,869
You wanted to see me, skip?

915
01:03:16,672 --> 01:03:18,090
[Ernie] I've lost Eagle.

916
01:03:18,173 --> 01:03:22,636
Harry and Dicky are low on depth charges
and fuel, as are we.

917
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,764
I can offer only scant protection
to the convoy.

918
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:28,350
We need air cover, Charlie.

919
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:31,228
Do...

920
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:41,154
Do I break radio silence
with a message to the Admiralty?

921
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:44,449
Or does that let the wolf pack know
just how vulnerable we are?

922
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:45,909
What would the message be?

923
01:03:48,245 --> 01:03:49,329
"Help needed urgently."

924
01:03:50,163 --> 01:03:52,165
No. "Help needed." That means "urgently."

925
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,043
"Needed" isn't needed. Just "help."

926
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:58,172
That's all the Admiralty needs to hear
for a modified rendezvous point.

927
01:03:58,255 --> 01:04:00,424
The Germans might miss a message
as short as that.

928
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:04,678
I wouldn't need to take this risk
if I'd been smarter yesterday.

929
01:04:05,345 --> 01:04:07,723
What you did yesterday got us to today.

930
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:11,602
It's not enough, Charlie.
Not nearly enough.

931
01:04:25,157 --> 01:04:26,575
Message from the Admiralty, sir.

932
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,120
Some of it's badly scrambled, sir.
I've done my best with it.

933
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:33,874
- XO to the bridge.
- Aye, aye, sir.

934
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:36,710
What are these scrambles?

935
01:04:36,793 --> 01:04:39,838
I think coded numerals, sir.
But I'm sure of that.

936
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:42,508
"Expect aircraft.

937
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:45,177
His challenge, 'Uncle William.'
Your answer, 'Baker Dog.'"

938
01:04:46,595 --> 01:04:47,596
[Charlie] Captain?

939
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,806
Charlie. Message from Admiralty.

940
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:51,600
Reinforcements dispatched.

941
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:54,728
But it's only partially deciphered.

942
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:56,331
Put together a team,
see what else is there.

943
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:57,356
Aye, aye, sir.

944
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,584
[radio: static]

945
01:05:17,668 --> 01:05:19,127
[Gray Wolf, on radio] Greyhound!

946
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:23,715
Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

947
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:28,262
We can always find you
in the night to kill you.

948
01:05:28,345 --> 01:05:29,346
Escorts, Greyhound.

949
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,991
- Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?
- Divert all further TBS traffic

950
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:33,475
to channel Hotel. Execute.

951
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:35,310
[Gray Wolf howls]

952
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:37,729
Thought these were numerals,
but it was "Point X-ray."

953
01:05:37,813 --> 01:05:39,940
"Modify rendezvous point to Point X-ray."

954
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,609
- Mm-hmm. How soon?
- Something like four hours, skip.

955
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:45,070
Sir.

956
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:21,356
- [Ernie] Messenger.
- Yes, sir.

957
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,277
Go to my cabin and bring me my slippers.

958
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,361
Aye, sir.

959
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:31,867
[grunts]

960
01:06:45,672 --> 01:06:47,758
Ah, thank you. Return those.

961
01:06:49,801 --> 01:06:51,261
[grunts]

962
01:06:58,602 --> 01:06:59,603
Ah.

963
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:01,897
[exhales]

964
01:07:02,689 --> 01:07:04,691
[radarman] I've got two contacts
bearing 099...

965
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:07,402
[talker] Combat reports two pips,
starboard bow. Bearing 099.

966
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:08,862
The other at 168, sir.

967
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:11,323
- Boatswain, take us to white.
- Aye, aye, sir.

968
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,785
Charlie, these pips.

969
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,996
Yes, sir, we got two skunks
showing on surface radar.

970
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,540
They're heading straight for us.

971
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:22,501
Just two hours to the rendezvous point,
Ernie, God willin'.

972
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:30,759
All escorts, Greyhound. I have
two surface targets off to starboard.

973
01:07:30,843 --> 01:07:32,511
Maintain your screens.

974
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,931
Mister Watson,
bring us up to general quarters.

975
01:07:36,014 --> 01:07:38,433
- [Watson] General quarters.
- [man] Aye, aye, sir.

976
01:07:38,517 --> 01:07:41,246
General quarters, general quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

977
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:43,897
[Ernie] Harry, Dicky. Greyhound.
I am engaging targets.

978
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:46,501
[Dicky] Request permission to come down
there and bounce 'em with you, sir.

979
01:07:46,525 --> 01:07:48,861
- Negative, Dicky. Maintain your screen.
- Aye, sir.

980
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,030
- Messenger.
- Sir.

981
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:55,367
I'd like more coffee, please.

982
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,286
Aye, sir.

983
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,587
[garbled radio transmission]

984
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,838
[Gray Wolf] Greyhound.

985
01:08:08,547 --> 01:08:10,549
Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

986
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:15,429
Did you think you had slipped away
from this Gray Wolf?

987
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:19,765
No, you did not. You will not.

988
01:08:20,684 --> 01:08:24,770
The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,

989
01:08:24,854 --> 01:08:27,399
not the hound on the run.

990
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:31,819
You and your comrades will die today.

991
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:33,404
[Charlie] Conn, Combat.

992
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:35,967
- Radar showing contact at 110.
- [lookout] Periscope to starboard bow.

993
01:08:35,991 --> 01:08:38,785
Range is 2,100 yards and closing, sir.

994
01:08:38,868 --> 01:08:40,120
[lookout] About one mile!

995
01:08:40,871 --> 01:08:42,288
- There, sir!
- [Lopez] Fire!

996
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:48,462
The wake, sir! There!

997
01:08:54,343 --> 01:08:55,426
Contact 187...

998
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:58,971
Sonar reports torpedoes, starboard beam,
bearing 187. Range 1,500, sir.

999
01:09:00,682 --> 01:09:02,684
- Left full rudder.
- [Watson] Left full rudder.

1000
01:09:14,738 --> 01:09:18,575
Second torpedo to starboard beam!
Bearing 120! Range 1,000!

1001
01:09:18,658 --> 01:09:21,328
- Right hard rudder, hard over!
- Right hard rudder, hard over!

1002
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,880
Belay that, belay that!
Meet her. Meet her!

1003
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:33,215
Belay. Meet her. Meet her.

1004
01:09:33,298 --> 01:09:34,883
[helmsman] Aye, sir. Holding course.

1005
01:09:52,734 --> 01:09:54,444

1009
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,402
Meet her! Steer straight

Conning tower, dead ahead!

1016
01:11:27,955 --> 01:11:29,206
[Watson] We must have hit her!

1017
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:34,378
Charlie! Lay a course to open the arcs
of fire aft! We'll hit 'em broadside!

1018
01:11:34,461 --> 01:11:37,798
Left full rudder, slow to two-thirds.
After batteries, fire as you bear.

1019
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,763

[crew cheering]

1035
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:19,525
Good work.

[crew continues cheering]

1037
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,631
[Watson] Sir, I stand relieved.
Mister Carling has the deck.

1038
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:44,258
Very well.

1039
01:13:45,717 --> 01:13:46,802
Messenger.

1040
01:13:48,595 --> 01:13:50,222
- Yes, sir.
- Write this.

1041
01:13:51,014 --> 01:13:53,475
"To Comconvoy and all escorts:

1042
01:13:54,685 --> 01:13:58,647
Sonar reports no contacts.
Radar reports no contacts.

1043
01:14:00,107 --> 01:14:01,775
All escorts, resume station."

1044
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:03,777
- Send it.
- Aye, sir.

1045
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,658
[helmsman] My heading is 290, sir.

1046
01:14:09,741 --> 01:14:12,303
- [Carling] Very well. Steady as she goes.
- [helmsman] Steady as she goes, sir.

1047
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:15,247
- [Carling] All ahead standard.
- [helmsman] All ahead standard. Aye, sir.

[talker] Forward Lookout reports ship
starboard bow.

1049
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,889
Bearing 110. Range eight miles.

1050
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,648
- Message, sir.
- Read it out.

1051
01:14:41,732 --> 01:14:43,734
"Admiralty to Greyhound. Welcome.

1052
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:46,445
Kindly make verbal report
to Diamond on TBS."

1053
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:56,288
Diamond, Greyhound. Diamond, Greyhound.
Do you hear me?

1054
01:14:56,872 --> 01:15:00,459
Loud and clear, Greyhound.
We hear you had a bit of a rough go of it.

1055
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:03,712
Yes, sir. In the last 48 hours,

1056
01:15:03,795 --> 01:15:08,258
we've lost seven ships from the convoy.
Two others were damaged.

1057
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:11,345
And the condition of your command?
How are you holding up?

1058
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:14,723
I took a round from a sub
on our portside deck. Three were killed.

1059
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:16,099
But you are seaworthy?

1060
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:20,103
Yes, sir. Dicky and I fought him
out on the surface, and we got him.

1061
01:15:20,187 --> 01:15:22,564
Uh, my escort group sank three others.

1062
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:25,859
Four U-boats? [laughs]
Bloody good job, Greyhound.

1063
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:31,031
We will be relieving you now
and taking the convoy on to Liverpool.

1064
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:32,449
You take Dicky and Harry

1065
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:34,826
and make best speed
to the naval yard in Londonderry.

1066
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:41,834
Sir, I request I stay with the convoy.
I have 56 hours fuel at economical speed.

1067
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:45,838
No, that's an order, Commander.
We'll see the convoy on from here.

1068
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,840
I need you to take Dicky and Harry
back home.

1069
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:51,051
They're not fit to stay in the game,
understood? Off to Derry with you.

1070
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,135
Aye, aye, sir.

1071
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:55,472
Tell me, Greyhound, just curious,

1072
01:15:55,556 --> 01:15:57,683
how many crossings
does that make for you now?

1073
01:15:58,684 --> 01:16:00,269
This was my first, sir.

1074
01:16:00,352 --> 01:16:02,437
[chuckles] Unbelievable.

1075
01:16:02,521 --> 01:16:05,691
Well, let's hope next time's a bit easier,
eh? Admirable show, Commander.

1076
01:16:05,774 --> 01:16:06,900
Thank you, sir.

1077
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,458
Dicky, Harry. Greyhound.

1078
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,043
- Dicky here.
- Harry here.

1079
01:16:25,127 --> 01:16:26,962
You are relieved of your screening duties.

1080
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,007
Form starboard echelon on me
at the head of the convoy.

1081
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,510
We will depart on 087 for Londonderry.

1082
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,012
[Dicky] Aye, aye, sir.

1083
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:36,138
[Harry] Aye, sir.

1084
01:16:47,524 --> 01:16:48,609
[pencil cracks]

1085
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,453
Messenger.

1086
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:02,164
- [man] Messenger.
- [messenger] Sir.

1087
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,544
- Signal Bridge. Send it.
- Signal Bridge. Aye, sir.

1088
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:10,297
Commodore is signaling
five minutes to course change, Captain.

1089
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:12,549
Very well. Take us up the lane.

1090
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:14,968
When we clear the lead ships,
turn right to 087.

1091
01:17:15,052 --> 01:17:17,095
- Dodge, James, starboard echelon.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1092
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,348
Steady on 087. Starboard echelon.

1093
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:22,059
- Helm, mark your head.
- [helmsman] Mark 083, sir.

1094
01:17:22,142 --> 01:17:23,685
[Carling] Very well. Keep her so.

1095
01:17:23,769 --> 01:17:25,479
[helmsman]
Steady as I go. Aye, sir.

1096
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,582
Mister Carling, she's all yours.

1097
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,211
I will be in my cabin if you need me.

1098
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:51,380
Aye, aye, sir.

1099
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:12,568
[distant cheering]

1100
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:22,327
[cheering continues]

1101
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:42,181
[cheering continues]

1102
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:13,420
[cheering, shouting]

1103
01:20:32,332 --> 01:20:34,710
"I thank you, my heavenly Father,

1104
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:36,670
that you have graciously kept me this day.

1105
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:40,340
Into your hands I commend myself,
my body and soul. Amen."
