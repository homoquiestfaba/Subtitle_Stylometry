2
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:05,980
Say, Sanders
take a water break.

3
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Hey, they've got the power, and we got
the power too, right here on FM 109

4
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:18,440
Right now it's 54 big degrees,
in Downtown Santa Fe,

5
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:20,413
With a low tonight of 42 degrees,

6
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:21,946
It is 8:45AM...

7
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:38,293
You have plenty of
storage space, Mr. Kwan.

8
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,666
We know you could
use the extra money.

9
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:42,248
I'm not interested.

10
00:03:44,008 --> 00:03:45,155
You don't understand.

11
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,017
I understand very well
what you people sell.

12
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,613
I don't want your drugs in my store.

13
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,568
Mr. Kwan...
-- Please, leave.

14
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,368
Hello?

15
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,497
Hey, Kim, it's me, Jeff.

16
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,520
Jeff?

17
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,528
I'm not done talking to you.

18
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,377
Get out of my store.

19
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,466
You're a very rude old man, Mr. Kwan.

20
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,791
Leave, now!

21
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:11,520
Kim... what?

22
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:12,986
what, what's going on?

23
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,688
Do you think I came here
to ask you a favor?

24
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,853
You should be more
respectful of our organization.

25
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:21,106
Kim?

26
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,124
You're going to work with us..

27
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,462
You have no choice.

28
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,973
See you later, old man.

29
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,053
It's the third time this week I had
to pick him up at the station.

30
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,586
I can't keep him in school,

31
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:11,840
His temper is getting worse, and worse...

32
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,106
I can't even talk to my own son..

33
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,306
IDK what the hell's wrong with him.

34
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,000
Hmm, he took his mother's
death pretty hard, Carl..

35
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:22,480
Kim, we all did.

36
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,240
He's the only one walking
around with a chip on his shoulder.

37
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,000
You don't see Adam
acting up like that, do you?

38
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,613
Adam is too young to remember Elaine.

39
00:05:32,586 --> 00:05:34,933
All I know is he's headed
for some serious trouble.

40
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,560
I'm thinking of enrolling
him in a military school...

41
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,706
One that especialize in discipline..

42
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:43,106
doesn't sound so special.

43
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:47,653
Besides, we both remember
our experiences in the military.

44
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,280
Christ, Kim, it's not like
I don't love him anymore...

45
00:05:53,306 --> 00:05:54,973
It's just, I cannot handle him.

46
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,920
There's another school he might try.

47
00:05:58,426 --> 00:05:59,666
Instead of disciplilne.

48
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,080
it teaches self-discipline.

49
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,813
It might help Jeff control his...

50
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:05,960
... energy.

51
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,840
It's called Kenpo school.

52
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:11,360
It's not one of those
new hippie schools, is it?

53
00:06:11,786 --> 00:06:12,893
No, Carl.

54
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,426
Old school.

55
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,413
2000 years old.

56
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,200
Jeff...

57
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:29,693
This is Master Lo.

58
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,391
Pass it down

59
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,382
Jennifer.

60
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:19,000
Kenpo is a combination
of ancient fighting techniques,

61
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,493
and modern scientific principles.

62
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,520
An unending flow of motion.

63
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,080
A force which can
overwhelm any attacker.

64
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,480
Every move creates a
specific reaction in your opponent.

65
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:37,253
Each reaction leads
you to your next move.

66
00:07:38,306 --> 00:07:39,373
Every strike...

67
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,573
is a block.

68
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,266
Every block, a strike.

69
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:45,306
Each move flows into the next.

70
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,110
This logical

71
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:49,053
and sequential flow of action.

72
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Is the essence of Kenpo.

73
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,706
Kenpo can be the most lethal
of the martial arts.

74
00:08:33,466 --> 00:08:35,400
To control the power of Kenpo,

75
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:38,053
you must first control yourself.

76
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,893
Train you spirit,

77
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:43,440
as you train your body

78
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,720
developing inner strength

79
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,573
balance,

80
00:08:48,506 --> 00:08:50,146
and harmony, as you learn.

81
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,866
A master of Kenpo

82
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,026
is more than an expert in karate.

83
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,600
He is a martial artist.

84
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,906
He is a master of himself.

85
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:40,320
Alright!

86
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,413
Yo, tinkerbell,

87
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,840
Off the field!

88
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,893
It's our field too, meathead!

89
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:52,560
Say what?

90
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
Let's just .. forget about it, ok?

91
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,053
No, no, no let's not forget about it.

92
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,666
Why don't you just do what I said?

93
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,773
Off the field
Or I'll shove that pole up your ass.

94
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,373
Try it.
-- Come on, let's go.

95
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:07,533
You're not going to let butthead
get away with it, are you?

96
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,613
Adam! I said let's go.

97
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,773
It's not worth it.
-- It's not worth it?

98
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:12,306
What's that supposed to mean?

99
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:13,760
It means he can kick your ass.

100
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,133
You can kick my ass?

101
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:17,130
With one foot.

102
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:18,946
<i> With one foot, Erickson!</i>

103
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,893
Let's go
-- We're not done

104
00:10:21,173 --> 00:10:22,146
I think we are!

105
00:10:24,253 --> 00:10:26,213
I guess, he'd rather play
with his pole then.

106
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,493
You little shit.

107
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,333
<i>What happened?</i>

108
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:04,920
<i>Over here.</i>

109
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,800
<i>Get up, man.
Get up!</i>

110
00:11:08,826 --> 00:11:10,013
<i> What happened?</i>

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,640
<i>Call an ambulance. Now!</i>

112
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,946
<i>Amazing.</i>

113
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:20,360
What the hell you
think you were doing?

114
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,906
The guy hit Adam.

115
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:23,533
That's no excuse for what you did.

116
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,613
You tried to kill that kid.

117
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,373
I didn't!

118
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,920
By pure luck you didn't.

119
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,146
Had no goddamn idea what
you were doing, did you?.

120
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,426
were totally out of control, weren't you!

121
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,373
I sent you to Kenpo school
to control your temper.

122
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:39,960
And this is what you've learned?

123
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,426
You haven't changed.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,626
The only thing that's different
is now you're dangerous.

125
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,880
I want you out of my house.

126
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,631
What do you mean?

127
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,040
Someday you're gonnal kill somebody
I don't want Adam around to see it.

128
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,013
I want you away from Adam.

129
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:01,306
He got hurt today because he's tryng
to proof to you how tough he is.

130
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:02,706
Cause he wants to be like you.

131
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,133
Well, he's not like you,

132
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:05,946
And I don't want him to be like you.

133
00:12:06,106 --> 00:12:08,493
So you stay the hell away from him!
-- But, Dad.

134
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:09,893
I want you out of my house,

135
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:12,093
And I want you away from Adam.
Do you understand?

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,706
Yeah.

137
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,520
I'll just stay the hell away from everyone.

138
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:27,293
You have learned only half
of what I teach, Jeff.

139
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,053
You're strong, you're quick,

140
00:12:31,053 --> 00:12:32,186
But you're only a tiger.

141
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,240
Not a dragon.

142
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:38,346
The tiger, does not think

143
00:12:38,986 --> 00:12:41,040
Therefore, it can not act.

144
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,826
It can only re-act, respond.

145
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:48,453
The tiger is strong, and fearless

146
00:12:49,546 --> 00:12:51,786
But it cannot initiate action.

147
00:12:52,346 --> 00:12:55,786
That is the difference between
man and tiger.

148
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
Tiger is what I know.

149
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,613
The dragon is also very strong,

150
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,200
but full of wisdom.

151
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
The dragon fears...

152
00:13:07,293 --> 00:13:08,720
... what it's strength can do.

153
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,066
This is the tiger.

154
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,840
This is the dragon.

155
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,480
The dragon always...

156
00:13:21,946 --> 00:13:23,013
... has a choice.

157
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,653
The tiger .. never.

158
00:13:26,813 --> 00:13:29,613
I have shown you the dragon,
but you have not seen him.

159
00:13:30,826 --> 00:13:33,266
You will not find the dragon
in any dojo.

160
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,026
Experience will be your teacher.

161
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:39,120
You must find him for yourself...

162
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,653
... in your own way.

163
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,373
- And when you do,
-- I know,

164
00:13:45,586 --> 00:13:46,973
Then I will have learned the dragon.

165
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:48,467
Then...

166
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:50,360
... you will be a man.

167
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,253
Jeff
-- There's nothing here for me, Kim.

168
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:57,266
There is more here for you
than you can see right now.

169
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,613
Don't you start too, okay?

170
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:02,240
I know all about what I can't see,
and can't feel and can't learn.

171
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,173
Jesus

172
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,813
I'm sorry

173
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,773
You're the last person
I should be talking to like that

174
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,773
I'll miss you, Kim.

175
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,120
Wherever you are,
my heart will be with you

176
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,613
You have a lot of nice things here

177
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:27,066
Very old,

178
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,760
Very beautiful.

179
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:35,693
Cover the back

180
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,800
You're going to learn to work with us,
old man

181
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,960
Right?

182
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,586
Is there a problem here?

183
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,946
I guess so.

184
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,800
What's going on here?

185
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,213
You alright, Kim?

186
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:41,266
Better than they are

187
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,306
They could be worse.
-- Hey, Terminator,

188
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,133
IDK where you came from,
but you better go back.

189
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,346
These guys are Golden Fists.

190
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,573
- You're a dead man.
-- Jimmy.

191
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,213
This is my friend, Jeff.

192
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:58,040
Go get the wood from out back, please

193
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:01,453
What are Golden Fish, Kim?

194
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,293
Soldiers for Korean mafia

195
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,546
I never heard of them before

196
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,426
You have never been Korean.

197
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:25,160
You know, Jeff?

198
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,733
Koreans come to America
because it is the greatest country.

199
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,413
They work hard,

200
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:33,000
save money,

201
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,546
become citizens,

202
00:17:35,106 --> 00:17:36,493
Open businesses...

203
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:37,773
... like mine.

204
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,160
but...

205
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:48,369
Every ship brings rats
along with regular cargo.

206
00:17:49,253 --> 00:17:51,666
Korean mafia comes to America too.

207
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:55,466
Drugs, prostitution, parasites.

208
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,533
I reject their drugs,

209
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,973
So they come and smash things up.

210
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,093
Maybe I should stick around a while,
see if I can change their minds, huh?

211
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,386
No
I appreciate your offer.

212
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,346
But you are an outsider.

213
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,586
They would think I have hired your for protection.

214
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,333
They think they're losing face

215
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,933
Tomorrow I'll go and talk to them.

216
00:18:21,293 --> 00:18:23,200
Explain things, they'll understand.

217
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,480
It'll be okay

218
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,210
Jeff?

219
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:30,066
You look good.

220
00:18:30,973 --> 00:18:34,906
It is nice to see you again
It's been such a looong time.

221
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:36,467
I missed you.

222
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,040
Kim...

223
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,613
Are you sure there's nothing I can do?

224
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,386
No need to worry

225
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,266
Everything will be fine.

226
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,026
It's like...

227
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:46,146
... nothing's changed here

228
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,720
Except, I am now one of my antiques

229
00:19:55,213 --> 00:19:56,060
Tell me, Jeff.

230
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:57,506
Will you see your family?

231
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,480
Don't get up on my account

232
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:05,906
Young gun ho

233
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,146
Jimmy O.

234
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:11,133
Look, I'm going to go see Uncle Sam.

235
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,320
Are you gong to be arlight?
-- Yes, thank you.

236
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,746
Jeff and I have lots to talk about

237
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,760
Okay, good-bye

238
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:23,893
Jimmy's a good boy

239
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:25,493
He helps out

240
00:20:26,013 --> 00:20:28,186
I let him stay here, when he need a place.

241
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:31,413
Doe he remind you of anyone?

242
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,386
Did I really have that much of an attitude?

243
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:39,080
You mean you don't, any more?

244
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:51,826
It's been a long day

245
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,293
I'll see you in the morning

246
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:55,333
Why don't you get some rest

247
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:58,440
I think I'm gonna get cleaned up
and maybe go for a walk.

248
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,080
Good night, Jeff.

249
00:21:01,013 --> 00:21:01,706
Good night, Kim.

250
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:06,986
Jeff!

251
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,560
Yeah

252
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,813
It's never too late to come home

253
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:17,253
Yeah,

254
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,573
Kim...

255
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,173
No...

256
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,040
Nobody home, asshole

257
00:24:03,413 --> 00:24:04,320
Except us

258
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,466
Give me your money, sucker!

259
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,440
You heard the man

260
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,133
I'm going to cut you, motherfucker!

261
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,053
Is this what you want?

262
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:19,180
Huh?

263
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,386
You want this?

264
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:21,800
You want my money?

265
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,146
You want it?
Take it!

266
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,466
Excuse me

267
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,480
Adam Sanders, Wilshire homicides
What do you have?

268
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,800
Korean mafia all the way
typically clean hit

269
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,253
Unless Forensics finds something,
we got diddly.

270
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:52,906
I'd like to work on he case

271
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:55,413
There is no case,
No one down here talks to the cops.

272
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,790
The victim...

273
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:57,946
... was a friend of mine.

274
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:00,800
A very close friend.
I'd like to work on the case.

275
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,053
Tell you what, you get my Lt's okay
it's fine with me.

276
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,933
I'll get it.
--  Detective! --- Yeah

277
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,546
So, put me in?

278
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:11,280
It's a signature execution
we've seen it before.

279
00:25:11,386 --> 00:25:13,306
It's always connected to the Hiro-Pan network

280
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:14,230
Hiro-Pan?

281
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,826
Yes, methamphetamine.It's a
best-seller for the Korean mafia.

282
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,786
Who runs that stuff

283
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,453
I'd be the chief of the DEA
if I knew that  one

284
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,160
I'll tell you this, though.
whoever this guy is, he's smart.

285
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,110
I'll get you the records

286
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:27,893
Anything else

287
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
Yeah, male caucasian who found the body

288
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:31,440
Tell me again

289
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:35,093
Look, I told you four times already

290
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:39,226
- You're going to tell me again and again...
-- It was around here yesterday

291
00:25:39,493 --> 00:25:41,760
Show him the pictures
if you think it'll do any good.

292
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,000
Who knows?, he might recognize someone.

293
00:25:44,173 --> 00:25:46,973
Anyways, he's all you got, Sanders
-- What?

294
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,133
Jeff?

295
00:25:56,253 --> 00:25:56,893
Adam.

296
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,413
Oh, my God

297
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,800
I know this seems like a waste of time,
but .. you never know.

298
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,560
Other things, you know,
might turn something up

299
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:18,653
First one

300
00:26:24,146 --> 00:26:24,826
Yeah

301
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:27,640
So where you going?

302
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:29,533
I thought .. ah .. we'd ..

303
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,813
.. might go see Dad

304
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,380
I got some things to care of

305
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,626
What things?
-- Don't ask.

306
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Jeff, just hold on a minute

307
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,053
Look, just stay out of it, kid.
It's for your own good.

308
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:40,410
Jeff.
-- What?

309
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,110
Kim was family to me too, alright?

310
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,240
You cannot handle this by yourself

311
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:46,231
and what's more, If you try,
I don't care if you're my brother or not

312
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:47,955
I'm going to come down on
you like a ton of bricks.

313
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,151
Send my regards to Pop.

314
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:49,146
Excuse me

315
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,617
I'm looking for someone.
-- I can't help you.

316
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:54,897
Know anybody who can?

317
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,595
Guess not

318
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:17,804
Hi.

319
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,324
Wonder if you can help me

320
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:21,200
I'm looking for a guy

321
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:22,524
He's good in Tae-Kwon-Do

322
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:25,297
5'8", 150 pounds

323
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,457
Got a tattoo of a spider, right here

324
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:28,462
You know him?

325
00:28:29,351 --> 00:28:29,813
Yeah

326
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:30,977
Great

327
00:28:32,364 --> 00:28:34,115
I need to talk to him
Where is he?

328
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:38,257
Why don't you go home?
Before you get hurt?

329
00:28:41,706 --> 00:28:43,751
I wonder if I can kick you ass?

330
00:28:45,484 --> 00:28:45,902
No.

331
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:47,537
Not just you

332
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,528
All three of you

333
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:52,737
Are you serious?
-- Yeah

334
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:54,240
Are you?

335
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,973
I take on all three of you, you
point me in the right direction.

336
00:28:58,702 --> 00:28:59,333
Deal?

337
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:04,551
Full contact

338
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:06,035
No protection

339
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:08,764
No problem

340
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:22,568
This is my dance

341
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:34,773
Come on, whiteboy!

342
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,995
Let's see what you got.

343
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:13,582
Come on

344
00:30:13,804 --> 00:30:14,560
No.

345
00:30:58,782 --> 00:30:59,528
Get up!

346
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:00,817
Get up

347
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,004
Where is he?

348
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:44,391
Forget it

349
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,346
We had a deal

350
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:53,466
Talk

351
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,635
Croc Pit

352
00:31:56,808 --> 00:31:57,440

00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:00,453
He hangs out there

355
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,635
They all do

356
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:04,355
Thanks

357
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,386
Who said it never hurt to ask

358
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,093
Hello
-- Yes

359
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,008
I'm Detective Sanders.

360
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,217
I'd like to ask you some questions,
please

361
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:35,004
Yes?
-- Kim

362
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,960
He has a store across the street.

363
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,204
Cum?
-- Yes.

364
00:32:38,293 --> 00:32:39,662
I'm investigating his ..

-- Yes

366
00:32:44,097 --> 00:32:44,862
No. Mr. Kim...

367
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,177
I'm investigating his murder.

368
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:49,911
Moardar?
-- Yes.

369
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:51,066
I'd like to...

370
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,177
Murda.

371
00:32:55,786 --> 00:32:57,226
Thank you for your time.

372
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,102
Keep the change.

373
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:01,644
Yes.

374
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:03,804
Have a nice day.

375
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:06,328
I canvassed a four square-block radius,

376
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:08,035
around Kim's store.

377
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:09,653
No one's saying anything.

378
00:34:11,226 --> 00:34:13,271
Wish to god I was back on the street,
I could help you.

379
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:17,733
You got everything you need.
you just get these bastards.

380
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:19,822
Right, Dad. We'll get them.

381
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:44,880
What happened to you?

382
00:34:46,204 --> 00:34:46,968
Rough night.

383
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,440
Woah, Jeff, woa

384
00:34:52,613 --> 00:34:54,408
Not going to go anywhere
till you tell me about the kid.

385
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:56,684
The kid, Jeff.

386
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:59,893
The one you left out of your statement
the one that was living in Kim's apartment?

387
00:35:00,444 --> 00:35:02,897
We have his clothes, we got prints
all over the place; we got not ID

388
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:04,302
Now, you're going to tell who he is

389
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:07,980
IDK... who you're talking about.

390
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,986
Hey, kid.

391
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:32,120
That was him, wasn't it?

392
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:41,342
Great, Jeff.

393
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:44,711
Thanks a lot, bro.

394
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:48,568
You just scared off the one lead I had.
the one lead i had!

395
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,262
Come on.

396
00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:50,915
That kid is from the street.

397
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,430
He's never going to talk to a cop
I know.

398
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:54,670
You know shit, Jeff.

399
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:57,460
You know what you're doing?
you're helping those bastards get away.

400
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:00,755
Why don't you just go play with your badge?

401
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,900
Go do your little police academy bullshit

402
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:05,120
You know what?

403
00:36:06,968 --> 00:36:09,102
Kim wouldn't even be dead
if you weren't back in town.

404
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:10,231
Did you know that?

405
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,533
You're the one that killed him, Jeff!

406
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,462
This is your goddamn fault!

407
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:22,657
You're going to shoot me, Adam?

408
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:08,711
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

409
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,720
You don't belong here, punk

410
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:21,377
Who killed Kim?

411
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:22,311
Fuck you.

412
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,488
Who killed Kim?

413
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:03,813
No!

414
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:13,031
Take him outside

415
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:53,840
Kim was a good man

416
00:40:58,106 --> 00:40:59,368
He was a friend of mine

417
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:00,942
A very good friend

418
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,986
We spent many happy moments here,
in Koreatown

419
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,471
I want to help

420
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:10,666
What can you do?

421
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:12,684
I have some information

422
00:41:15,013 --> 00:41:16,035
But not here

423
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:17,350
It's not safe

424
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,648
Come

425
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,204
Please

426
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:36,284
It is important

427
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:38,275
We can talk privately in here

428
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,466
Come

429
00:41:50,062 --> 00:41:52,444
I was going to see Kim
on the day he died

430
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:54,382
We had a meeting

431
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:56,897
I could've made things right
for him, but ..

432
00:41:57,368 --> 00:41:59,066
except that I waited too long.

433
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,275
And now .. my friend is dead

434
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,044
And I did nothing to help him

435
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:13,724
The man who murdered Kim...

436
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:15,457
... must be punished.

437
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,080
And the punishment must fit the crime

438
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,200
Tell me what you know

439
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:24,151
There are four Onjabus in Koreatown.

440
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,035
Mafia leaders

441
00:42:26,542 --> 00:42:28,170
Anyone of the three could've done it

442
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:32,302
Ye Mei, ..  Otoko, ..  Wo Sam...

443
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:34,756
What about the fourth?

444
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,280
The fourth Onjabu is Yong.

445
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,746
How do you know Yong didn't do it?

446
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,964
Because I am Yong

447
00:42:44,977 --> 00:42:46,151
And yet I can do nothing

448
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:47,991
Nothing

449
00:42:49,262 --> 00:42:53,084
If the other Onjabus learn that I am
seeking vengeance for my friend's death

450
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:55,155
They would turn against me

451
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:58,266
There would be total war in Koreatown

452
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,204
Much blood would be shed

453
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:04,062
Too much blood

454
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:08,835
There is only one person...

455
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,257
... who could bring about justice without ...

456
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:14,180
... total war.

457
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:16,915
That is an outsider

458
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:23,066
Will you do this thing?

459
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:27,057
You just point the way

460
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,631
There's a man named Kai.

461
00:43:33,288 --> 00:43:34,604
He's a soldier for hire

462
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,773
My people have heard him talking

463
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,671
I'm sure he knows the man
who ordered Kim's death

464
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,168
Where is this Kai?

465
00:43:43,475 --> 00:43:44,435
We will find him

466
00:43:53,386 --> 00:43:54,417
The man on the right

467
00:43:55,191 --> 00:43:56,106
That's Kai.

468
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,786
Want to live?

469
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,884
A name

470
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,488
Wh ordered Kim's death?

471
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:25,493
Say it

472
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:28,053
Wo Sam.

473
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,813
I'm sorry, it's too dangerous

474
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,297
Wo Sam is very heavily protected

475
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,955
Besides, you don't know him

476
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,417
Wo Sam is an animal, if you ..
-- Hey.

477
00:44:47,457 --> 00:44:48,533
We had an agreement

478
00:45:02,577 --> 00:45:05,324
Wo Sam lives in the Cocoma Hotel

479
00:45:05,742 --> 00:45:06,648
He owns it

480
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:09,155
Everyone there works for him

481
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:11,457
The whole top floor is his

482
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,390
The only way in to the top floor is by ..

483
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:15,955
... a private elevator.

484
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:19,386
From the garage to ..
to the penthouse

485
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,537
be careful

486
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,111
There are guards at the gate...

487
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,635
... and the basement. At the top.

488
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,031
He's surrounded at all times

489
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,875
Min?

490
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:09,617
You okay?

491
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:40,231
Anything happens to me

492
00:48:40,373 --> 00:48:42,666
I'll snap your neck before
I hit the ground

493
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,702
You want money?

494
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,222
I don't want your money

495
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:49,617
You took Kim's life

496
00:48:50,568 --> 00:48:52,248
Now I'm going to take yours

497
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,146
I did not

498
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,533
You may kill me, but I will not die
saying a lie.

499
00:48:57,111 --> 00:48:58,622
Then, you'll just die

500
00:48:58,942 --> 00:49:00,755
Leave him alone
-- Stay away

501
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,146
Let him go! What're you dong?

502
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:04,968
He killed Kim

503
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:06,986
No way, Sam was Kim's friend!

504
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,364
He's like my Uncle

505
00:49:08,604 --> 00:49:10,275
Sam's been protecting me from Yong

506
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:11,555
Yong?

507
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:13,626
That's who killed Kim

508
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,090
Who lied to you?

509
00:49:24,168 --> 00:49:24,746
Yong

510
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:26,746
A man tells you something

511
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:28,293
and you invade my home

512
00:49:28,755 --> 00:49:29,928
try and take my life

513
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:31,475
in front of the eyes of my children?

514
00:49:33,031 --> 00:49:34,728
He fingered a soldier named Kai.

515
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:36,942
Kai said you did it

516
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:38,346
Kai works for Yong

517
00:49:38,764 --> 00:49:39,457
Is that right?

518
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:44,240
Why should I believe you
more than Yong?

519
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,257
EVerybody in Koreatown knows
Yong killed Kim, Dick!

520
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:50,284
Tracy

521
00:49:50,897 --> 00:49:52,622
Think, Yong wants me dead,

522
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,511
But he knows it will start a war
that will destroy even him,

523
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,022
So he sends an outsider

524
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:59,182
An outsider who will do anything ..

525
00:49:59,848 --> 00:50:00,760
... to avenge a friend.

526
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,533
he can never be blamed

527
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,737
No evidence, no proof

528
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,604
Just some crazy stranger

529
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,573
The pefect weapon
THE  P E R F E C T  W E A P O N

530
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,497
What will you do now?

531
00:50:12,737 --> 00:50:13,555
... if I let you go?

532
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,724
Yong and I have
some unfinished business

533
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:20,515
And I will finish it

534
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:23,555
I'm going with you

535
00:50:23,635 --> 00:50:24,380
Forget it!

536
00:50:24,453 --> 00:50:27,475
No way. You're going to need my help
-- You're just a kid.

537
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,786
Who knows how to find Yong

538
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:32,071
No deal!
-- Excuse me

539
00:50:32,675 --> 00:50:33,644
You must find Yong

540
00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:35,093
... before he can leave for Korea

541
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:37,240
Take the boy.
he can help you find him.

542
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:39,271
You came to take my life

543
00:50:40,142 --> 00:50:41,253
you leave with my blessing

544
00:50:41,733 --> 00:50:42,737
and one of my people

545
00:50:45,368 --> 00:50:46,373
strange deal.

546
00:50:58,648 --> 00:50:59,955
So how many people have you killed?

547
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:03,982
None, kid

548
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,351
Come on, we're working together
you can tell me.

549
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:11,208
Is that what you're looking forward to?

550
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:13,120
Killing someone?

551
00:51:14,222 --> 00:51:15,022
Aren't you?

552
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,746
I mean, as soon as we catch
this guy, what choice do we have?

553
00:51:22,026 --> 00:51:24,568
Only one
-- You're lucky.

554
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:26,160
You're lucky Sam let me help you

555
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:28,071
I'm his fastest runner

556
00:51:28,817 --> 00:51:30,791
I'm the fastest runner
this side of the Pacific Rim

557
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:32,133
I know, I've seen you run

558
00:51:32,231 --> 00:51:32,648
Hey,

559
00:51:33,333 --> 00:51:36,151
How come you took off from the funeral
like that, instead of helping me then?

560
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:38,462
I wasn't running from you, brainiac

561
00:51:39,048 --> 00:51:40,826
I was running from Yong, he saw me

562
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:41,893
Look ..

563
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:43,795
Sam's tough enough, but Yong ..

564
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:44,986
He's heavy duty

565
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,330
Yakuza connections,

566
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:47,946
drugs and protection only

567
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,355
He's Koreatown's Hero-Pong hero

568
00:51:50,888 --> 00:51:51,777
The mystery man

569
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:54,284
Nobody even knows where he lives

570
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:56,373
the only place for sure,
where I know he goes every day..

571
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,342
... his bank.

572
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,084
That's good enough for me

573
00:51:59,893 --> 00:52:01,360
But you're not getting up on Tanaka.

574
00:52:01,822 --> 00:52:02,897
Yong's bodyguard

575
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,666
Yong doesn't go anywhere
without him

576
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,235
Guy's built like goddamn Godzilla

577
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:09,448
And nobody gets near Yong
when Tanaka's around

578
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:10,924
That's for shit sure

579
00:52:11,146 --> 00:52:13,351
don't swear, kid
-- What are you my mother?

580
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:14,933
Where is your mother?

581
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:17,955
Hey... we can split up
and meet back at the hotel, okay?

582
00:52:18,826 --> 00:52:20,533
Yeah, but you still didn't
answer my question

583
00:52:20,613 --> 00:52:21,635
She's dead, alright!

584
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,560
How old were you when she died?

585
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:25,982
None of your business

586
00:52:29,671 --> 00:52:30,551
Kim was right

587
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,022
You do remind me of someone

588
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,720
I lost my Mom when I was ten

589
00:52:40,008 --> 00:52:41,217
So we do have something in commom?

590
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:42,320
Hey round-eye?

591
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,182
Hey, the bank's
not open yet, Sherlock

592
00:52:47,546 --> 00:52:48,782
Mind tell me where we going?

593
00:52:49,697 --> 00:52:50,640
To talk to someone

594
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:51,866
Who?

595
00:52:53,164 --> 00:52:54,000
A cop

596
00:52:54,666 --> 00:52:55,217
What?

597
00:52:55,386 --> 00:52:56,080
Relax

598
00:52:56,515 --> 00:52:57,377
He's my brother

599
00:52:57,706 --> 00:52:58,808
I want you to talk to him

600
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,697
Hey, I'm not talking to no cop

601
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:05,200
I want you to tell him you saw Tanaka
-- but I didn't

602
00:53:06,035 --> 00:53:07,022
He doesn't know that

603
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,822
I want you to tell him you saw
Tanaka kill Kim, okay?

604
00:53:12,915 --> 00:53:15,991
Then he's going to ask if you'll testify
to that, I want you to say, yes.

605
00:53:18,097 --> 00:53:19,413
You're dumber than you look

606
00:53:19,937 --> 00:53:22,577
I'm not going to no court
and talk to no cop, No way!

607
00:53:22,835 --> 00:53:25,404
That wan't part of the deal.
you can drop me off right here.

608
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,924
Will you just listen to me for a minute?

609
00:53:30,311 --> 00:53:34,915
If we tell my brother you saw Tanaka then he'll arrest
him in the bank before anyone knows what's happened

610
00:53:36,092 --> 00:53:36,972
So what?

611
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:38,791
That puts Yong in the back of the limousine

612
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,471
... alone.

613
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:46,284
Maybe you're not as dumb as you look.

614
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:01,004
We're in position in the bank parking lot

615
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:03,591
You guys stay put until
the suspect is inside the bank

616
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:05,955
??? guys.  Do you copy?

617
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:07,964
<i>That's a copy, 1830.</i>

618
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:20,195
Jeff?

619
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:21,937
Yeah

620
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,151
You know when you wanted to do
this alone, by yourself?

621
00:54:32,213 --> 00:54:32,693
I mean...

622
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,791
Just go find that bastard
who killed Kim

623
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:38,062
... just blow him away...

624
00:54:41,137 --> 00:54:42,462
I wanted to do the same thing.

625
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:46,782
I know what you're feeling...

626
00:54:48,968 --> 00:54:49,635
... and...

627
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,906
... I'm really ...

628
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,102
... glad that we're
doing this together.

629
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:01,146
I mean, I never thought
it'd turn out like this

630
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:02,906
and it's good

631
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,444
Wake up, dim-brains, there he is!

632
00:55:13,964 --> 00:55:14,791
Target on scene

633
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,782
He's not stopping at the parking lot
he's headed for the drive-through teller

634
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,200
This is going down wrong
I'm going to pull along-side and take a look.

635
00:55:42,648 --> 00:55:43,386
alright, Jimmy...

636
00:55:43,902 --> 00:55:45,475
I want you to do exactly what I tell you

637
00:55:45,644 --> 00:55:47,715
You stay down there, close the windows

638
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:50,008
because I don't want him seeing you
before you can ID him

639
00:55:50,506 --> 00:55:52,640
Don't worry about it. He won't see me.

640
00:56:00,826 --> 00:56:02,177
Are we there yet?
-- No

641
00:56:10,444 --> 00:56:11,786
Ah Christ, lady

642
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:14,711
What's happened?
-- We're going to lose him.

643
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,106
Are we there now?
-- No, we're definitely not there now.

644
00:56:22,915 --> 00:56:24,071
Come on lady, move it!

645
00:56:41,973 --> 00:56:42,640
Okay, Jimmy.

646
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,968
Positive identification.

647
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,008
Seat-belts!

648
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:07,137
1830, suspect's made me

649
00:57:07,413 --> 00:57:08,417
switching to xxx xxx

650
00:57:12,675 --> 00:57:14,888
1830, officer needs assistance

651
00:57:14,968 --> 00:57:16,453
187 suspect

652
00:57:16,524 --> 00:57:18,088
Northbound on Harvard

653
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:34,248
Wow, this is cool!

654
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,715
Alright, little brother!

655
00:58:26,213 --> 00:58:27,297
We're gong to get him, Jeff.

656
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:46,320
Oh shit!

657
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,453
Oh .. shit.

658
00:58:53,475 --> 00:58:54,160
Shit ..

659
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:51,351
Freeze

660
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:55,190
Let me see your hands!

661
00:59:55,502 --> 00:59:56,071
Now!

662
01:00:06,151 --> 01:00:07,386
Put your hands on top of your head

663
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:09,475
Now, do what he said,  put them up!

664
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:11,440
Hook him up

665
01:00:16,017 --> 01:00:16,853
Get back in the car

666
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,120
Stay in the car.
-- Oh, man!

667
01:00:19,164 --> 01:00:20,346
Jeff...  Jeff!

668
01:00:23,057 --> 01:00:24,160
Hold your fire

669
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,817
Disperse
-- I want him alive.

670
01:00:34,373 --> 01:00:35,297
Yong!

671
01:00:37,591 --> 01:00:38,177
Shit!

672
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:40,782
This taser's got
50,000 volts of electricity

673
01:00:40,817 --> 01:00:42,417
On your knees,
let me see your hands

674
01:00:43,937 --> 01:00:45,191
I'm going to light you up!

675
01:00:45,253 --> 01:00:45,893
Adam!

676
01:00:51,884 --> 01:00:52,620
Shit!

677
01:01:00,666 --> 01:01:01,600
It's clear

678
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,413
Adam...  you're alright?

679
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,711
Of course I am

680
01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:10,106
Alright, have the paramedics take a look at
this guy before I transport him out of here

681
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,617
And I'll hook up with you
later at the station

682
01:01:11,973 --> 01:01:13,128
I need to tell you something

683
01:01:16,124 --> 01:01:16,906
Did it, bro

684
01:01:18,017 --> 01:01:18,826
We got him

685
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,506
I heard you did a nice job back there

686
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:34,053
You were gutsy

687
01:01:34,826 --> 01:01:36,355
You would've done the same thing, Tim.

688
01:01:36,897 --> 01:01:37,804
I don't know

689
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:40,115
How long you been on the job?

690
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,346
Five and a half months.

691
01:01:43,102 --> 01:01:44,320
Don't worry
you'll be fine

692
01:02:54,782 --> 01:02:55,520
Hey

693
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:57,573
Hi!

694
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,208
I messed up

695
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:09,013
You helped me out
I didn't come through.

696
01:03:12,577 --> 01:03:13,680
I didn't help you, Adam.

697
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,720
Jimmy didn't see Tanaka do anything

698
01:03:22,177 --> 01:03:22,942
I lied

699
01:03:24,168 --> 01:03:25,955
I didn't know what Tanaka was ..

700
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:30,675
Except that he was muscle for
the guy that killed Kim

701
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:32,302
Yong

702
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:35,804
He gave the order

703
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:41,946
That was Yong's limousine

704
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,382
He was supposed to be in the back

705
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:47,208
I used you to get to Yong

706
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,715
I didn't want anything
to happen to you, Adam

707
01:03:58,213 --> 01:03:59,813
I jut wanted Yong so bad

708
01:04:01,271 --> 01:04:02,337
... I wasn't thinking

709
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:08,968
Christ, Adam, we're family

710
01:04:11,742 --> 01:04:12,382
Yeah

711
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,693
We are

712
01:04:19,937 --> 01:04:20,835
It's okay

713
01:04:25,768 --> 01:04:26,862
So what about Yong?

714
01:04:29,635 --> 01:04:30,115
Jeff,

715
01:04:31,306 --> 01:04:33,395
you kill Yong,
you throw away your whole life

716
01:04:34,968 --> 01:04:35,920
and Jimmy's

717
01:04:36,675 --> 01:04:37,644
He looks up to you

718
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,075
Yeah, I know

719
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:43,413
Kim was trying to help him out

720
01:04:46,995 --> 01:04:48,995
And you really think he
would want you to do this?

721
01:04:53,191 --> 01:04:55,120
There's only one line
between us and them

722
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,090
And once you cross it ..

723
01:05:03,111 --> 01:05:04,400
You can never come back

724
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,871
So, ahh .. how is he?

725
01:05:30,817 --> 01:05:31,706
He'll be okay

726
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:38,782
Look, I gotta go

727
01:05:47,546 --> 01:05:48,915
Hey, you watch yourself, son

728
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:52,197
Young's leaving the country tonight

729
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:56,417
He wants all the Hiro-Pong out of
the warehouse before the boat comes.

730
01:05:59,316 --> 01:06:01,316
Tonight. San Pedro. Berth Sixty.

731
01:06:04,013 --> 01:06:05,013
Make sure you're there.

732
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:06,604
I'll be there

733
01:06:43,093 --> 01:06:43,982
Let's do it

734
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,755
Ah, man, come on.
What are we doing up here?

735
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,088
Checking things out

736
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:57,164
Come on-n-n

737
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:58,942
Let's go, let's rock 'n roll

738
01:07:00,471 --> 01:07:02,035
Tell me everything you heard

739
01:07:02,871 --> 01:07:03,653
I already did

740
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:05,617
Tell me again

741
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:09,368
Yong brings the stuff he makes
hiropong with down there okay(???)

742
01:07:09,848 --> 01:07:11,955
There's guards and workers
all over the place

743
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:13,973
What about the inside?

744
01:07:14,435 --> 01:07:15,342
It's like a factory

745
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,506
Lots of workers

746
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,111
A speed-boat comes out of this
big ship and he picks him up

747
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,791
Takes Yong wherever he wants to go

748
01:07:20,968 --> 01:07:23,795
That's how he got out of the country
the last time cops tried to bust him.

749
01:07:25,422 --> 01:07:26,720
I'll wait till night

750
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,111
You stay at the hotel

751
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,311
If I don't make it out.
-- You will.

752
01:07:33,555 --> 01:07:34,275
Yeah ..

753
01:07:34,533 --> 01:07:35,404
If I don't ..

754
01:07:36,257 --> 01:07:37,360
You get a hold of my Dad

755
01:07:37,795 --> 01:07:38,897
Captain Sanders

756
01:07:40,195 --> 01:07:41,170
You'll be safe with him

757
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,644
When you get him

758
01:07:44,514 --> 01:07:45,514
Kill him for Kim

759
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:47,368
Kill him for me.

760
01:09:13,546 --> 01:09:14,906
ha, you believe it still works?

761
01:09:23,022 --> 01:09:24,328
The boat should be here by now

762
01:09:25,173 --> 01:09:26,062
We should go outside

763
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,391
Hey, you!

764
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,462
Hold this

765
01:11:07,093 --> 01:11:07,920
Thanks

766
01:11:25,644 --> 01:11:26,755
Break time, guys

767
01:12:13,706 --> 01:12:14,640
Not to worry

768
01:12:15,155 --> 01:12:16,213
We are prepared

769
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:12,826
Are you faster than a speeding bullet?

770
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,328
Try it, Superman.

771
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,444
I want you to try it

772
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:20,737
Come on

773
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:23,253
Come on!

774
01:13:25,724 --> 01:13:27,146
I'm glad you dropped by

775
01:13:27,902 --> 01:13:30,577
I was hoping you would
have a chance to say goodbye.

776
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:34,373
Thanks of  extending the
.. courtesy

777
01:13:40,284 --> 01:13:41,013
Brains.

778
01:13:42,373 --> 01:13:43,528
this way, Kai

779
01:13:44,684 --> 01:13:45,466
This way

780
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:28,808
Wait, wait

781
01:14:29,724 --> 01:14:30,693
Don't talk to me

782
01:14:33,768 --> 01:14:34,613
Don't .. kill me

783
01:14:36,657 --> 01:14:38,471
Punishment must fit .. the crime.

784
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,688
Who said that?

785
01:14:46,355 --> 01:14:49,128
This is what it feels like
.. just before you .. die!

786
01:15:05,617 --> 01:15:06,460
Get up

787
01:15:07,902 --> 01:15:09,244
I really want to kill you ..

788
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:15,920
.. but you're not worth it

789
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,342
Hey, hey
-- That's alright, let him go.

790
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,368
Keep everybody back.

791
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,386
<i>alright, everybody back</i>.
-- mann ..

792
01:19:33,484 --> 01:19:34,986
I thought you were .. dead.

793
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,560
Hey... you didn't kill him

794
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:45,560
This film is dedicated to Ed Parker
AND the spirit of KENPO
