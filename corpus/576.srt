1
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,892
See you later, honey.

2
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,899
We still need 40 dozens, standard.

3
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:54,106
No more uncuts. That's enough.

4
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,729
So, Blanca, did you see him?

5
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,434
l waited by the plaza but he never came.

6
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:27,773
-How long did you wait?
-Don't laugh.

7
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,501
l'm not laughing.

8
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,407
Tell me how long you waited.

9
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,369
l didn't really like him anyway.

10
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,539
ln any case...

11
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,684
check out that guy over there.

12
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,121
He looks at me and smiles like that
all the time.

13
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,284
Maria...

14
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,622
you want to go to your house?

15
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,094
No, Juan.

16
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,926
Where do you want to go then?

17
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,296
l don't know. Somewhere else.

18
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,665
Where?

19
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,298
How about up there?

20
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,300
The roof? Why there?

21
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,901
Why not?

22
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,413
Come on.

23
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,546
lt's not even that high.

24
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,411
No.

25
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,579
What are you, crazy?

26
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:54,118
See how you treat me, Juan? You're a drag.

27
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,554
Let's not get started with this, okay?

28
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,120
lf l go up, will you follow me?

29
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,160
Then what?

30
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,667
Are we gonna do it up there?

31
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:15,442
Come down and we'll go to your house.

32
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,276
Come down.

33
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,261
Come on. lt's your turn.

34
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:35,864
No way.

35
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,294
Come up. l have to tell you something.

36
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,605
You know what, l'm gonna take off.

37
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,643
Then go. l'm not moving.

38
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:51,310
You can come down the way you went up.
Alone. See ya.

39
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,792
l'm really worried. He's constipated.

40
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,329
What are you doing?

41
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,595
He hasn't shit in two days.

42
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,365
Diana, relax. He'll go when he goes.

43
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,735
Don't bother him.

44
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:16,001
Maria, don't comb your hair
in the dining room.

45
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,942
Diana, he's cranky because
you're kneading his stomach...

46
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,638
like a ball of dough.

47
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,237
Come here, Pachito.

48
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,582
You're scaring him, Maria.

49
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,645
Diana, pass him to me.

50
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,852
Come, sit down.

51
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,592
Mom, will you fix a tea for him?

52
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,898
You know those teas don't do anything.

53
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,098
Take him to the doctor.

54
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,970
No, Grandma, l don't trust that doctor.

55
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,307
You don't have to take him anywhere.

56
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,275
He's fine.

57
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,113
What are you looking for?

58
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:00,174
l'm not sure, Grandma.
l don't feel like bread.

59
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,338
l said the white ones at 40.
What happened?

60
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,505
Sir.

61
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,079
What's wrong?

62
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,548
Can l go to the bathroom?

63
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:12,613
Again?

64
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,722
l don't feel well.

65
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,929
You're four bins under this hour,
and three last hour.

66
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,795
How will you catch up
if you're in the bathroom all the time?

67
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,630
Please, l'll be quick.

68
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:26,436
l have 84 workers in this section...

69
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,641
and everyone else puts their head down
and does their job.

70
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,940
But with you, it's like a constant tug-of-war.

71
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,037
At this point l don't know what to--

72
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,279
What the hell? What's wrong with you?

73
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:40,519
Look at this mess. This is disgusting.

74
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,016
What are you going to do with these now?

75
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,018
Tell me. What are you going to do?

76
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,186
Pick them up.

77
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,964
Take them over there.

78
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,267
Hurry up.

79
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,343
Clean them.

80
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,047
Be careful of the buds.

81
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,880
But if they're already ruined.

82
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,352
l don't care. Clean them off.

83
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,656
l want all those roses clean.

84
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,949
And when you're done with that
you can go back...

85
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,019
and make up what you owe me.

86
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,754
ls that clear?

87
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,162
Yes, sir.

88
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,355
ls everything okay?

89
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,992
lt's 9,600.

90
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,689
Maria, give me the money.

91
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,928
-And why should l pay?
-lt's for Pacho. He started vomiting.

92
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,394
Where's your money?

93
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:03,726
Maria.

94
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,762
l give up all l make and Diana doesn't
put in anything.

95
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,375
And l have to pay for the kid's medicine?

96
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,134
Don't start with me, Maria.

97
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,745
Just give me the money.

98
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,815
You can keep the money
from your next check.

99
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,987
l don't know why everything
is so difficult with you.

100
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,456
Well, there won't be a next check.

101
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,401
Because l quit my job.

102
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,559
What?

103
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,461
When?

104
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,695
Today.

105
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,900
But why?

106
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,909
They wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.

107
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,708
Not once?

108
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,409
lt's not just that.
l don't like how they treat me.

109
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,145
So what are you going to do now?

110
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,278
You are so stupid, Maria.

111
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,412
Why don't you shut up?

112
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,582
Don't tell me to shut up.

113
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,684
-They treated me like shit.
-Why can't you just deal?

114
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,288
-Why should l put up with it?
-Why don't you think of the family?

115
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,854
Quiet! That's enough.

116
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:10,129
-You have to go and apologize to your boss.
-l'm not going back.

117
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,932
-What are you going to do?
-l'll find another job.

118
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,696
Another job?
There's nothing but flowers here.

119
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,333
At least it's a decent job.

120
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,475
Please, what's decent about it?

121
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,945
Maria, go back and apologize.

122
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,507
Aren't you listening?

123
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,139
l am not going back.

124
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,014
l'm not going back, and that's it.

125
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,819
She quit and left him standing there.

126
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,694
Well done. This deserves a toast.

127
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,134
Bottoms up.

128
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,362
Because she kicks ass.

129
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:47,331
Come on. Down the hatch.

130
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,921
Blanca, look. lsn't that your boyfriend?

131
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:45,187
Oh, my God.

132
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,658
Ask him to dance.

133
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,791
No way. You're crazy.

134
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,836
Come on, don't be stupid.

135
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,265
Hi.

136
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,408
Hi.

137
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,204
This is Blanca and l'm Maria.

138
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,512
l'm Felipe and this is my cousin Franklin.

139
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,568
What's up?

140
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,807
She wants to dance with you.

141
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,678
Go for it.

142
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,644
You want to dance?

143
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:11,882
Sure.

144
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:13,350
Let's dance, then.

145
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,734
Juan, l want to dance.

146
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,210
Hold on.

147
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,806
Hold this for me.

148
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,707
All right, let's go.

149
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,914
Spin, spin, spin.

150
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,579
What's wrong with you?

151
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:44,913
What?

152
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,019
Another drink.

153
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,496
Hey.

154
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,339
You want to dance?

155
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,807
What do you say?

156
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,636
Okay.

157
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,012
Let's go.

158
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,342
Juan.

159
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,250
Hold on.

160
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,011
Maria, l'll see you later.

161
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,112
Bye, Blanca.

162
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,396
All right, then.

163
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,540
Juan, l have something to tell you.

164
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,204
What is it?

165
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,050
l think l'm pregnant.

166
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,658
Are you sure?

167
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,521
-You're not fucking with me, right?
-No.

168
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,287
l've missed my last two periods.

169
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,189
What are you going to do?

170
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,324
l don't know.

171
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,864
Who else knows?

172
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,060
Only you.

173
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,128
No one else?

174
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,799
You want everyone to know?

175
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,673
l bet Blanca already knows.

176
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,645
No, Blanca doesn't know.

177
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,051
Maria.

178
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,258
Do you want to get married?

179
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,565
-Are you joking?
-Why?

180
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,704
-Where would we live?
-My house.

181
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,673
There're ten people in your house.
You share a bedroom with your brother.

182
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,438
So where do you want to live?

183
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:27,877
My house would be better.

184
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,743
Right, a lot better.

185
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,307
A guy living in his girl's house. No way.

186
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,875
You're so fucking stupid.

187
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:38,354
Stupid? Your family hates me.
Why should l live there?

188
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,858
We're better off in my house.
The more the merrier.

189
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,052
Why don't you want to get married?
l'm stepping up to this.

190
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,424
Juan, do you love me?

191
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,993
Oh, not that again.

192
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,631
Look me in the eye and tell me
you really love me.

193
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,935
What kind of person are you?

194
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,440
You're gonna marry someone
you don't even love?

195
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,913
Someone who doesn't love you?

196
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,846
How many months or days
before you're sleeping with another woman?

197
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,513
That's not gonna happen.

198
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:14,221
l don't want to end up like my sister.

199
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:18,525
Sorry, but your sister was an idiot
who screwed the first guy that walked by.

200
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,395
-Shut up.
-lt's true. And now she's stuck with a kid.

201
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,196
Don't talk about my sister like that.

202
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,600
Maria, l am not going anywhere
and you know it.

203
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,932
That doesn't matter. l am not marrying you.

204
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,099
Sorry to break it to you, but you'll have to.

205
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,266
No, Juan.

206
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,035
l don't have to do anything.

207
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,169
That's the way you are, Maria.

208
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,405
You are so stubborn.

209
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,244
You're an idiot, and a loser.

210
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,182
Most guys would've left by now.
l don't know why l stand you.

211
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,687
Then don't.

212
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,981
l'm not in love with you.

213
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,220
Me neither.

214
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,353
Perfect.

215
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,542
What's up?

216
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,676
How are you?

217
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:51,555
Where are you going?

218
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,553
To Bogota.

219
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,789
Hop on. l'll give you a ride.

220
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,920
To Bogota?

221
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:59,020
Of course, l'll take you.

222
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,239
l like the way you dance.

223
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,834
Really?

224
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,241
You, too.

225
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,184
l didn't think people could dance around
here. Thought they were all stiff.

226
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,149
Where are you from?

227
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,385
l'm from a little town.

228
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,158
Santa Rosa de Cabal.

229
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:06,322
About ten minutes from Pereira.

230
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,465
You know it?

231
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,557
No.

232
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,228
There are some great hot springs over there.

233
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,464
Someday l'll take you there.

234
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,864
Yeah?

235
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,409
What are you going to Bogota for?

236
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,651
l'm going because...

237
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,382
l have a friend who works there.

238
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,992
She works for a wealthy family,
in their house. She's going to help me out.

239
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,858
-Don't laugh.
-l'm sorry.

240
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,796
lt's just that...

241
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,331
you're way too pretty to be working
as a maid.

242
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,105
Too cute to get dressed up
in that hat and apron.

243
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:55,343
Anyway, l was just going to check it out.

244
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,041
Nothing was certain.

245
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,691
Listen.

246
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:19,931
lf you're looking for work
l might be able to hook you up.

247
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,103
Hook me up?

248
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,238
lt involves traveling.

249
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,303
Traveling?

250
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,907
Tell me.

251
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,709
Working as a mule.

252
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,091
lt's a cool job.

253
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,025
You go, hand off the stuff, get your cash
and that's it.

254
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,119
Everything's cool.

255
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,593
What about the people on the news?

256
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,067
The ones in prisons far away.
What about them?

257
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:54,434
They're the ones who want to be famous.

258
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:58,306
They get caught, get on TV, everyone sees
them, and they become famous.

259
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,106
l don't want to be famous.

260
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,912
l know a guy who can set it all up.

261
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,810
Takes care of the papers,
makes the arrangements.

262
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,320
Know what? Forget it.

263
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,251
Let's go.

264
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,488
No, hold on.

265
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,067
How much would l get?

266
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,476
You want something to drink?

267
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,717
Give me a beer and a soda for her.

268
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,876
l'm going to talk to this guy.
l'll be right back.

269
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,420
You're all right?

270
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,572
All set.

271
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,212
Let's go.

272
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,520
Come in. Sit down.

273
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,935
So you and Franklin are friends.

274
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,036
How do you two know each other?

275
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:15,440
She's a friend of the family.
Through my cousin.

276
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,577
Your cousin.

277
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,817
You're looking for work?

278
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,046
Yes, sir.

279
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,146
Where were you working?

280
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:27,118
ln a flower plantation.

281
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,216
And what happened?

282
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,428
l didn't get along with my boss...

283
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,824
so l left.

284
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:36,932
Rebellious, then.

285
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,396
No.

286
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,631
You don't have a problem
taking directions?

287
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:44,369
Orders?

288
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,534
No, sir.

289
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,807
Do you get scared easily?

290
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,707
No.

291
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,411
How old are you?

292
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,319
Eighteen.

293
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:56,613
Boyfriend?

294
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,315
No.

295
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,151
Yes or no?

296
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,886
No.

297
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,458
l don't have a boyfriend.

298
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,028
All right, then.

299
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,202
How's your system?

300
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,739
My system?

301
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,938
l mean, how's your stomach?

302
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,974
Do you have problems with diarrhea?
Constipation?

303
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,981
Digestive problems?

304
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,074
None. No, sir.

305
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,142
Big eater?

306
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:31,014
Normal.

307
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:38,018
Okay, then...

308
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,656
we are going to give you several rolls
of film.

309
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,668
We'll send you to New York.

310
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:47,171
Actually, to New Jersey,
a small town next to New York.

311
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,699
Once you go though customs...

312
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,607
you'll be met by our people.

313
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,075
They will take you to a safe place.

314
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,943
We'll develop the rolls.

315
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,517
And in five or ten days you'll be back here...

316
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,416
with all your money taking care
of your problems.

317
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,749
How much do l get?

318
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:13,894
We'll give you $100 per roll.

319
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,733
Keep in mind...

320
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,997
we have to take care of your documents.

321
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,972
Meaning that after we deduct the expenses
for the passport and visa...

322
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,531
and for your papers...

323
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,577
you'll have seven or eight million pesos.

324
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,118
What if l get caught?

325
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,516
And why would that happen?

326
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,787
Unless you step off the plane
shaking like a leaf.

327
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,325
Then they'll catch you.

328
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,517
Obviously.

329
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,321
But no worries.
Those gringos don't know a thing.

330
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,522
Don't worry.

331
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:47,823
Now...

332
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,029
once your decision is made...

333
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,598
there is no turning back.

334
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:56,740
You can't tell anyone. Understand?

335
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,301
Yes, sir.

336
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,745
Now, l know you have a lot of problems
weighing on you...

337
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,339
and you're in a difficult situation...

338
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,850
and l don't want you making this decision...

339
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,319
under that kind of pressure.

340
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,685
So l'm going to give you this...

341
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,818
so you can take care of some things.

342
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,863
Actually, it's really not necessary.
Thank you.

343
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,591
No, no, no. Take it. No obligations.

344
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,001
Don't worry about it.

345
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,673
You were in the bar, right?

346
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,468
My name is Maria.

347
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,521
l'm Lucy.

348
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,161
Do you work for Javier?

349
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:03,666
ls it hard?

350
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,262
lt's not easy, but it's not too difficult either.

351
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,203
How old are you?

352
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,679
Seventeen.

353
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,676
But l said l was eighteen.

354
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,917
You just have to be prepared
and know how to do it right.

355
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,297
Where have you been?

356
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,904
l went to the city...

357
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,806
to ask Jessica for help finding a job.

358
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,241
What did she say?

359
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,512
lt's none of your business.

360
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:51,873
Don't tell me it's not my business.

361
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,482
lt's not.

362
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,850
You didn't find anything.
Or you would've said so.

363
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,786
You have to go back to the plantation
and get your job back.

364
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:00,882
No.

365
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,860
lt's not fair to Mom.
You know how hard it is for her.

366
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,589
Now you're making things harder?

367
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:06,687
Get off my back.

368
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:09,631
Don't even.... Pacho had
a 108 fever this morning.

369
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,725
He's your son.

370
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,794
-l know he's my son. So?
-He's your responsibility.

371
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,466
Who do you think you are?
You have to find a job.

372
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,667
Well, l got one.

373
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,142
Yeah, like what? Cut the shit.

374
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,255
At least l put in my share.

375
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,874
Take this.

376
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,311
Hold it in your mouth.

377
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,314
Let it slide to the back.

378
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:38,846
All the way.

379
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,255
Open your throat.

380
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,925
Now swallow.

381
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,564
Practice with these.

382
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,240
Can you swallow these?

383
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,486
You can't eat anything for 24 hours
before the flight.

384
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,049
Your stomach has to be totally empty.

385
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,192
They may lie about how many you have
to swallow.

386
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,959
How many will it be?

387
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,805
For your size,
maybe 60 or 70 pellets.

388
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,302
Really?

389
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,271
Be glad you're small.

390
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,437
Big guys have to swallow...

391
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,447
like a hundred.

392
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,449
Make sure they're well wrapped.

393
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,213
lf just one opens up you'll die.

394
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,149
Wear nice clothes.

395
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:49,350
Nothing flashy. You don't want to look like
a peasant showing off.

396
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,656
How many times have you done this?

397
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:54,987
Two.

398
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,095
How'd it go?

399
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,703
Still here.

400
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:14,847
The first time l did it l was gonna go see
my older sister.

401
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,746
She lives in New York and l haven't seen her
in four years.

402
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,019
But when l got there l realized...

403
00:34:23,094 --> 00:34:24,891
l didn't know what to tell her.

404
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,024
How was l going to explain why l was there?

405
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,294
And how?

406
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,802
l love her.

407
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,664
But we're really different.

408
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:40,105
She'd kill me if she found out
l was mixed up in this.

409
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,213
The second time around...

410
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,307
l made it to her house.

411
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,076
But l couldn't knock on her door.

412
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,493
What is America like?

413
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,925
Over there...

414
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,700
it's, like, too perfect.

415
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,362
Everything's straight.

416
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,615
So...

417
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:00,752
how's that thing going?

418
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,087
What thing?

419
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,455
Your job. Tell me what you have to do.

420
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,760
l told you not to talk about it.

421
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,974
l talked to Franklin.

422
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,813
l'm going to be a mule, too.

423
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,814
You did what?

424
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,788
You heard me. Why not?

425
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,722
Because you can't.

426
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:35,950
Yes, l can.

427
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:38,191
What are you thinking?

428
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,058
lt's $5,000.

429
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,090
You know how much that is in pesos?

430
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:45,667
l figured it out.

431
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:49,339
lt's like 10 million pesos.
l can buy my family a house with that.

432
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:51,907
No, Blanca, you're not going.

433
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,237
You know what? l can do what l want.
l don't need your permission.

434
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,679
Do you know what you're saying?

435
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,414
You have to tell them you're not doing it.

436
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:01,910
No.

437
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,717
Anyway, l can't now.

438
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,385
l already said yes.

439
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,205
All the way to Chiquinquira?

440
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,102
But you don't know anything about working
in an office.

441
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,238
You don't think l'm smart enough?

442
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,711
That's not what l said.

443
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,590
l don't understand why you have to go
so far away.

444
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:45,750
What's up?

445
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,073
What's up?

446
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,639
-How are you?
-All good.

447
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,254
And Blanca?

448
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,023
She's in another place.

449
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,332
Don't worry, baby.

450
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,704
Everything's gonna be all right.

451
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:42,177
Give her a hand.

452
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,660
These will slow your digestion.

453
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:05,752
Take them.

454
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,267
Open your mouth. Open.

455
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,021
Here.

456
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,808
Don't stick your fingers so far inside.

457
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,845
lf you can't do this, we'll stop right now.

458
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,210
No.

459
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,380
l know l can do it.

460
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:07,079
Let's see.

461
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,961
Relax.

462
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,834
Let it slide down.

463
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,509
Very good.

464
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,454
-How many is it so far?
-Twenty-three.

465
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:52,836
Come. Lay down.

466
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,992
What are you doing?

467
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,655
Setting them in place.

468
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,157
You want more anesthetic?

469
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:23,750
Let's see.

470
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,290
This is...

471
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:26,789
$800.

472
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:29,055
You saved for the trip.

473
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,125
The ticket.

474
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,905
Round trip, one week.

475
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,440
To New York.

476
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,476
Your passport. With a visa.

477
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:48,740
Look...

478
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,015
You've got the name and address
of the hotel...

479
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,114
where you say you're staying...

480
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,216
while you're there.

481
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:57,617
One more thing.

482
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,893
lf any of what you're carrying...

483
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:03,265
gets lost along the way
or doesn't show up...

484
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:05,698
we'll go and have a little conversation...

485
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,600
with your grandmother, your mother...

486
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:09,138
your sister...

487
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,605
and little Pachito.

488
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:11,971
We know exactly...

489
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,674
how much each one of those
62 pellets weighs.

490
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,712
Understood?

491
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,086
l didn't know you were coming again.

492
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,384
Me neither. lt just happened.

493
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,580
You know we're not the only ones?

494
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,990
That's how it works.

495
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,425
They send a bunch.

496
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,396
lf one gets stopped, it's easier
for the rest to get through.

497
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,210
What are you doing?

498
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,412
l saw you talking to that woman.
Who is she?

499
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,220
She's...

500
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,589
you know.

501
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,994
See that woman with the curly hair
over there?

502
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,300
She is, too.

503
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,427
l met her with Franklin.

504
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,029
l feel like l'm having my period.

505
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,573
l feel like l have to go to the bathroom.

506
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:00,974
Excuse me.

507
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,449
l don't feel well.

508
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:30,651
What are you going to do?

509
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,524
Stay calm.

510
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:41,836
As soon as we land, we'll get a doctor.

511
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,705
l know.

512
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,106
l know.

513
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,271
l lost the hotel address.

514
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,669
Do you know it?

515
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,838
No, l always give them my sister's address.

516
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,783
Do you have a pen?

517
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,891
lt's my sister's address in New York.

518
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:47,088
Excuse me.

519
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:50,458
May l see your passport,
declaration card, and ticket, please?

520
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:54,393
Passport, declaration card, and ticket.

521
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,739
Where are you arriving from?

522
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,204
Colombia.

523
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,074
Your destination?

524
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,816
New York.

525
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:16,413
Are these all your bags?

526
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:17,745
Yes.

527
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,281
Come with me, please.

528
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,834
Put your hands against the wall please.

529
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,065
Not so close to the wall.

530
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,938
Spread your legs, please.

531
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,542
Maria Alvarez.

532
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,778
-ls that your name?
-Yes.

533
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,757
ls this your first time in this country?

534
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,849
Yes.

535
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,091
Where are you staying?

536
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,557
With my sister.

537
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:07,793
lf we called her, would she confirm
you're coming?

538
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:13,035
l haven't seen her in four years.

539
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,633
l was planning to surprise her.

540
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,269
And you're going to show up just like that?

541
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,939
What if she's not there?

542
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:22,007
And if you get there and she's not home?

543
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,677
Where will you go?

544
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,286
l don't know.

545
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:28,584
ln a hotel.

546
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:31,417
Did you buy this ticket?

547
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,286
Yes.

548
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:34,691
How much did it cost?

549
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:38,959
Like $500.

550
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,662
Maria.

551
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,836
What do you do in Colombia?

552
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,234
l work with flowers.

553
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,872
What do you do exactly?

554
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,573
l de-thorn them.

555
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:54,543
How did you get the money for the ticket...

556
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,244
and the $800 that you have on you?

557
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,885
l saved up.

558
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,157
You know what?

559
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,620
l don't believe you're here on vacation.

560
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,862
Why are you really here?

561
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:13,869
You want to know what l think?

562
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:16,767
l think you're bringing drugs...

563
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,829
into the United States.

564
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:21,576
We've known people who swallow drugs...

565
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,942
and bring them in like that.

566
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:27,206
Do you have drugs in your stomach?

567
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,376
No.

568
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,722
l want you to prove it.

569
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,355
We would like to submit you to an X-ray.

570
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,057
Please...

571
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:50,004

to do the X-ray.

572
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,701
Maria...

573
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,878
you know you're pregnant?

574
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,639
Yes.

575
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:12,048
Will the X-rays hurt my baby?

576
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:15,017
We don't X-ray pregnant women.

577
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,886
But we can detain them.

578
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:26,265
We know you didn't buy this ticket.

579
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,835
We know you couldn't have saved
that much money.

580
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,800
Tell us the truth.

581
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:32,606
Who paid for this ticket?

582
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,345
A friend bought it for me.

583
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:41,177
What's his name?

584
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:45,745
Franklin.

585
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:48,746
He's my boyfriend.

586
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,589
He's the baby's father.

587
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,386
Does he know you swallowed drugs?

588
00:58:56,299 --> 00:58:58,062
l didn't swallow drugs.

589
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,263
l'm not carrying anything.

590
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,271

591
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,278

592
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,356
Girl.

593
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,261
-And the other one?
-They caught her.

594
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:34,633
Fuck!

595
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:44,740
Make yourself comfortable.
We'll be here until you shit everything out.

596
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,445
She needs a doctor.

597
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,153
Like l care?

598
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:53,720
She needs medicine.

599
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,814
Shut up!

600
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,954
Take those.

601
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,065
-What are they?
-Laxatives. They'll make you shit faster.

602
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,630
l have to go to the bathroom.

603
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:05,859
Hold on.

604
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:10,829
Don't use the toilet.
l don't want stuff down the drain.

605
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:14,274
And don't forget the toothpaste.
l don't want to be smelling your shit.

606
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:06,790
How are you?

607
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:09,596
Okay.

608
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:11,925
And you?

609
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:02,944
Lucy.

610
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:28,132
-What are you doing?
-Blanca, we can't stay here.

611
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:29,432
What do you mean?

612
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,029
Don't you get it, Blanca?

613
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,974
They did something to Lucy.
Everything's totally fucked up.

614
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,738
We have to go before they come back.

615
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,937
-Maria!
-Hurry up, Blanca!

616
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,920
What are we going to do?

617
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:58,464

618
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,835
Excuse me.

619
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:07,808
Do you know how l can make a call?

620
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:09,403

621
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,244

627
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,592
You gotta go into New York.

628
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,726
You gotta take a bus.

629
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:32,725
A bus. You know?

630
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,599
You trying to get to New York?

631
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,103
To Queens?

632
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,568
Queens?

633
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,411

Thank you, but l just want to call.

637
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,350
lt's okay, no problem.

638
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:56,089
l'll take you. Flat rate. Off the meter.

639
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:03,721
Can you wait for a minute?

640
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,651
One moment.

641
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:15,631
There's no answer.

642
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,204
We have to go back.

643
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:21,503
No, Blanca.

644
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:25,543
Lucy's sister doesn't even know you.
And you don't really know Lucy.

645
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:26,807
What are you going to say?

646
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,281
l don't know, l'll figure it out.

647
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:32,185
All we have to do is return the pellets
and get our money.

648
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,984
Don't you get it? We can't go back there.

649
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:38,288
They're gonna be furious
when they find out we're gone.

650
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,623
We have to go back.

651
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:42,061
Did you see what they did to Lucy?

652
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:13,253
Blanca, come on.

653
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,887
l'm not going in.

654
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,120
Come on!

655
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,563
l don't want to go in there.

656
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,926
Come on already!

657
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,095

660
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:11,978

Of her sister's?

664
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,484
Honey.

665
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,655
She says she's a friend of your sister's.

666
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,659

667
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,328
Hello.

668
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:35,670
Are you Carla Aristizabal?

669
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:37,899
How can l help you?

670
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,667

01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,639
l just arrived from Colombia...

672
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:45,212
and she asked me to stop by
and say hello for her.

673
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,046
You're a friend of hers?

674
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:49,306
Yes.

675
01:09:50,653 --> 01:09:52,314
Please, come inside.

676
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,420
Take a seat.

677
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:03,521
Sorry, what was your name?

678
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:06,424
Maria Alvarez.

679
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,661
And how do you know Lucy?

680
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,071
We live in the same town.

681
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:13,540
We're neighbors.

682
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:17,436
So tell me, how is she doing?
lt's been months since we last spoke.

683
01:10:19,448 --> 01:10:20,779
She's doing well.

684
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,879
ls she working?

685
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,613
Yes.

686
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,022
ln an office in Bogota.

687
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,889
She's a secretary.

688
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:31,990
Lucy? A secretary?

689
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:34,786
And you're always talking bad about her.

690
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:40,426
She's always talking about the two of you.

691
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,026
She wants to come and visit.

692
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,230
Really?

693
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:47,270
And she didn't send anything with you?
A letter, a photo or something?

694
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:49,466
Actually...

695
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,641
the truth is...

696
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:57,344
Lucy gave me your name and address...

697
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,655
and she said that you're really nice,
and that...

698
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,652
if l had any trouble l could come...

699
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,195
and talk to you.

700
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,292
l don't have a place to stay.

701
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:17,098
How long have you been here?

702
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,569
Two days.

703
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,439
Where were you staying these two days?

704
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:26,604
Well.... l was staying with a friend...

705
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:29,242
but we got into a fight and...

706
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,919
she kicked me out.

707
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,080
And you don't have anyone else here?

708
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:37,384
Family, friends? Nobody?

709
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,217
No, ma'am.

710
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:41,925
Do you have a job yet?

711
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,493
No, not yet.

712
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,933
And how did you say you knew Lucy?

713
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:49,027
Carla.

714
01:11:49,104 --> 01:11:51,595
lt's not like l'm gonna throw her out
on the street.

715
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,575
lt's just that this apartment is very small.

716
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:57,976
We sleep in the bedroom,
and Pablo's cousin here in the living room.

717
01:11:58,047 --> 01:11:59,708
Honestly...

718
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,613
l don't need a lot of space.

719
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,149
Yes, but for how long?

720
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,388
Only for a few days.

721
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:07,915
And then what?

722
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,255
l'll find something. Don't worry.

723
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:25,004
My cousin works in a bakery.

724
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:29,341
He gets home in the middle of the night,
so don't get scared.

725
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:06,604
For Colombia?

726
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:31,132
Lucy's not there.

727
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:35,936
Carla.

728
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:41,245
l want to call my mom. Can you help me?

729
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,351
Dial the number.

730
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,563
Grandma?

731
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,262
Hi Grandma. lt's Maria.

732
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:04,104
Fine, and you?

733
01:14:07,376 --> 01:14:08,468
Yes, l'm fine.

734
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:11,069
l'm still in Chiquinquira...

735
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,671
but l'll see you in a few days.

736
01:14:14,183 --> 01:14:16,674
How's everyone else doing?

737
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,281
Diana?

738
01:14:19,421 --> 01:14:22,549
No, Grandma, l was just calling to say hi.

739
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:26,287
l promised Mom l would call.

740
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:27,350
Yes.

741
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:41,707
Oh, the car.

742
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,174
l'm a driver for a car service.

743
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,437
Get in.

744
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:10,071
Hi.

745
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,338
What happened? Where did you go?

746
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:15,342
l met a woman who gave me a place....

747
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,672
You know each other?

748
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:19,971
ls that Lucy's sister?

749
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:21,915
You know Lucy?

750
01:15:24,486 --> 01:15:25,510
Yes.

751
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:26,778
What do you mean?

752
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,686
You said you didn't know anyone else here.

753
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:35,924
The thing is.... l told her about Lucy
on the way here.

754
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,090
So...

755
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:38,824
you're not really a friend of hers.

756
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,703
lt's just that Maria said that she was going
to stay with you and...

757
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,069
l don't have a place to stay.

758
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,231
You, too?

759
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,508
l don't understand.

760
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:52,206
Everyone knows someone here.

761
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:08,093
Yes, yes. l'll get the receipt.

762
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:10,961
l'll come up with something. Don't worry.

763
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,227
Tell them to fix this, and not to charge you...

764
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:18,365
since they did it wrong the first time.

765
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,798
-How are you?
-Fine.

766
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:22,136
How's the little one?

767
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,443
Fine, thank you, Don Fernando.

768
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:27,573
lt seems my sister in Colombia sent me
a little surprise.

769
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:28,673
Maria and Blanca.

770
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:29,909
Hi.

771
01:16:29,985 --> 01:16:31,316
When did they arrive?

772
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,820
They just got here,
but they don't know anyone.

773
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:37,120
Maybe you know of an apartment...

774
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:38,784
a job or something.

775
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:42,728
Don't you worry. l'll make a couple calls
and we'll--

776
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:44,889
Yes, sure...

777
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:47,795
He'll help you. l've got to go to work.

778
01:16:47,903 --> 01:16:49,564
You know how to get back.

779
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:51,765
Three blocks down and around the corner.

780
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,398
l'll be back tonight to let you in.

781
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:54,442
Thanks.

782
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:56,067
l'm leaving them here. Bye.

783
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:03,049
There's a place that usually needs
women to sew.

784
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,551
They don't check papers...

785
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,883
and they pay minimum wage.

786
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:09,947
Thanks for your help,
but we don't need work.

787
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,892
What are you doing? We can't go back there.

788
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,658
l don't care what you do.
l'm sick of following you around.

789
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,893
Like l asked you to? l told you not to come.

790
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:21,765
You're the one that wanted to take off
before we got paid.

791
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:23,031
Those guys are dangerous.

792
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,094
Quiet.

793
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,402
What's that you've got there?

794
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:27,499
Nothing.

795
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,736
l recognize what those are.

796
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,209
l've seen that before.

797
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,772
Tell me.

798
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,077
Does Carla know about this?

799
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,313
Are you all right, physically?

800
01:17:41,823 --> 01:17:44,621
Our friend who was with us got sick.

801
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,629
l think one of the pellets broke inside her.

802
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,065
l don't know if they killed her or if she died.

803
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,793
l don't know what to do.

804
01:17:57,572 --> 01:17:59,233
Where was this?

805
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:06,079
Don Fernando,
please help us find our friend.

806
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:11,748
l'll make some calls to the police
in New Jersey.

807
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,078
They might know something.

808
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:15,714
You can't call the police.

809
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:17,486
Don't worry. l know what l'm doing.

810
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,357
You have to return those drugs.

811
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:23,523
Before they hurt your families in Colombia.

812
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,193
Do you understand?

813
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:34,597
Blanca.

814
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,472
l lost the emergency number.
Do you have it?

815
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:40,447
l can't believe what you told him
about Lucy.

816
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,278
He's calling the cops now.

817
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,342
Don't fucking start with me.

818
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,947
You were the one pulling out the pellets
and running your mouth.

819
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:50,285
You want to sew shirts?

820
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:52,622
-l'm handling this.
-Stupidly.

821
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:56,460
Then why are you following me around?
Every time l turn around, there you are.

822
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:59,227
l thought you knew what you were doing,
but obviously not.

823
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,792
l'm not responsible for you.
l'm not your fucking mother.

824
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:06,102
l wouldn't want you anyway. l feel sorry for
your baby having such a stupid mother.

825
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:07,402
How fucking stupid...

826
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:09,103
swallowing drugs when you're pregnant.

827
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,201
Fuck you.

828
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:37,860
-Do you have an appointment?
-No.

829
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,836
l can give you one for next week.

830
01:20:42,904 --> 01:20:44,428
No, it has to be today.

831
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:53,208
lf you don't mind waiting,
l might get you in...

832
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,044
but l can't promise.

833
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,673
Thanks.

834
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,378
Fill this out.

835
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:11,023
You have to be very careful
while you're pregnant.

836
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,563
You can't smoke.

837
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,200
You can't drink alcohol.

838
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:16,199
No beer, no wine.

839
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,429
Especially not drugs.

840
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:21,101
Everything you put in your body
goes straight to the baby.

841
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:24,407
lf you smoke,
it's like giving a cigarette to your baby.

842
01:21:24,813 --> 01:21:25,837
Okay?

843
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,345
Let's see.

844
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:41,223
At this stage of the pregnancy
we can see the entire fetus.

845
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:44,931
That's the head.

846
01:21:47,402 --> 01:21:48,426
See?

847
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:51,930
That's my baby?

848
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,768
The arms.

849
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,912
These are the legs.

850
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:04,613
The blood is flowing well.

851
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,717
l'll take some measurements.

852
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,592
But everything's okay, right?

853
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,952
Yes, everything is okay.

854
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:17,592
Do you want to listen...

855
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:19,325
to the heart?

856
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,589
Friday, the eleventh of next month.

857
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,969
That's fine.

858
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:19,091
They found the body of a woman yesterday.

859
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:23,062
The stomach had been cut open...

860
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:25,626
and they think it was a mule.

861
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:29,362
They sent this information...

862
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,537
with a picture of her face.

863
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,581
l'm sorry.

864
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:47,314
Please...

865
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,914
l need to know your friend's name.

866
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:52,852
And an address in Colombia.

867
01:23:55,063 --> 01:23:57,156
What's her name?

868
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:06,504
Lucy Diaz.

869
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,203
Carla's sister?

870
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:10,839
Yes. But Carla doesn't know.

871
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,141
She was coming to visit.

872
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,941
She has to know.

873
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,142
lt's her sister.

874
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:27,558
l'm sure the baby will sleep with us
in the beginning but...

875
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:28,994
the crib was on sale.

876
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:31,923
What did Don Fernando tell you?

877
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:42,542
He told me that...

878
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:55,287
Carla.

879
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:59,126
l don't really need a job.

880
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:03,025
l'm going back to Colombia.

881
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:08,860
Darling, you're not going back.

882
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:10,996
l know how you feel.

883
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:14,007
l felt the same way when l came here.

884
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:18,777
l remember on my grandma's birthday,
l called home...

885
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,441
and l could hear my whole family...

886
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:25,213
laughing and screaming.

887
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:30,054
My little sister asking, ''How is it over there?
ls it wonderful?

888
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,615
''How's your job?''

889
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:35,551
Telling me how much she wanted to come
and stay with me.

890
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:40,625
l just wanted to tell them
how much l missed them.

891
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:44,127
But it gets better, trust me.

892
01:25:45,106 --> 01:25:47,836
l remember when l got my first paycheck.

893
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:53,580
l'll never forget going to that office
to send money home for the first time.

894
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:58,310
You can't imagine how it feels.

895
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:03,446
Your heart feels so big...

896
01:26:03,525 --> 01:26:06,187
like it won't fit in your chest.

897
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:12,061
The real reason l stay here is for my baby.

898
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:16,067
He'll have so many more opportunities.

899
01:26:18,039 --> 01:26:20,803
l can't imagine bringing up my child
in Colombia.

900
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,433
Not with the situation being what it is.

901
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:27,112
lt pains me to say it, but it's true.

902
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:36,982
-l'll get it.
-That must be your friend.

903
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,232
They found Lucy's body.

904
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,543
l saw it in a picture.

905
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,781
lt'll cost $2,500 to send her body back home.

906
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:16,089
Pablo.

907
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:18,964
Are you done?

908
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:20,865
Yes, love.

909
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:29,667
Hello.

910
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:33,508
lt's for you, Carla.

911
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:36,410
How are you, Don Fernando?

912
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:40,577
l'm fine, thank you. Why do you ask?

913
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:45,015
Arrangements?

914
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,357
Arrangements for what?

915
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:50,653
No.

916
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,097
She didn't say anything.

917
01:27:58,306 --> 01:27:59,568
Lucy?

918
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:02,674
What do you mean?

919
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:06,942
Are you sure?

920
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,317
Found here?

921
01:28:11,252 --> 01:28:13,379
l don't understand. What do you mean?

922
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:17,891
-They came as what?
-Carla, please, let me explain.

923
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:21,759
l tried to tell you,
but l couldn't get the words out.

924
01:28:21,896 --> 01:28:23,090
What are you saying?

925
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:24,856
Lucy got sick.

926
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:27,761
l tried to help her. l swear.

927
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:28,859
But l didn't know what--

928
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:30,426
When were you going to tell me?

929
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,400
l talked to Don Fernando.

930
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,139
l arranged everything
to send Lucy back to Colombia.

931
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,268
Arranged?

932
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:38,402
Carla, please.

933
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:41,004
Arranged what?
You're not arranging anything.

934
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,550
-You keep your hands off my sister.
-What's going on?

935
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,085
You've done enough!

936
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,450
No, you don't understand.

937
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,510
What have you done?

938
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:49,886
Fucking little bitches.

939
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:51,754
Carla, listen to me. Please.

940
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,056
You were never her friend. Never!

941
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:57,063
-Don't say that. l tried to help her.
-Get out now!

942
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:59,622
l tried to help her. l swear.

943
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:00,668
Get out!

944
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:02,430
-Maria, let's go.
-Just go, please.

945
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,403
-Get them out already!
-Forgive me.

946
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:05,461
Get out!

947
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:06,564
Please leave.

948
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,040
Get out! Get out!

949
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,065
What do you want to do?

950
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,146
lt's ringing.

951
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:58,817
Hello.

952
01:29:59,093 --> 01:30:00,958
This is Maria Alvarez.

953
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:03,854
Yes, she's with me.

954
01:30:03,998 --> 01:30:06,728
Where the fuck did you think you
were going with the stash?

955
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:07,790
-Bitches!
-But, we--

956
01:30:07,869 --> 01:30:10,565
But nothing! Where are the fucking pellets?

957
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:12,196
Come on!

958
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,331
Let her go.

959
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:16,002
-What about yours?
-ln my purse.

960
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:19,342
She should have 50
and the other one 62.

961
01:30:28,756 --> 01:30:30,690
They're all here.

962
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:32,583
All right, it's all good.

963
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:34,386
What about our money?

964
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:38,262
You think we owe you? After you went
running from the hotel?

965
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:40,091
But we called you.

966
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:44,027
You got lucky.

967
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:47,871
l was about to tell Javier
that you ran off with the goods.

968
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:49,704
But you have all the pellets.

969
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:53,008
That's right. We have them.
We couldn't give a fuck about you.

970
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,640
We still need that money.

971
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:56,774
Really?

972
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:59,710
l see. You need the money?

973
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,523
You really need the money?

974
01:31:08,996 --> 01:31:10,020
Know what?

975
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:11,189
Give it to them.

976
01:31:18,105 --> 01:31:19,197
Take it.

977
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:21,634
Come on.

978
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:23,602
Here.

979
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:33,113
Make sure it's all there.

980
01:31:34,355 --> 01:31:39,349
When you get back to Colombia,
be sure to tell Javier how nice l was.

981
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,994
You better not fuck around
on your next trip.

982
01:31:43,097 --> 01:31:44,121
Got it?

983
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:46,864
You've been trained now.

984
01:31:49,937 --> 01:31:51,336
What about Lucy's money?

985
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:54,206
What about it?

986
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:58,137
-l want to give it to her family.
-You've got nothing to do with that.

987
01:31:58,212 --> 01:32:00,043
You have her pellets.

988
01:32:00,114 --> 01:32:01,809
That's none of your business.

989
01:32:01,883 --> 01:32:03,851
She died doing this.

990
01:32:03,918 --> 01:32:05,749
They found her body.

991
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:09,114
l just want to give her sister the money.

992
01:32:09,223 --> 01:32:10,383
No fucking way.

993
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:12,153
She deserves a proper burial.

994
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,960
After what you did to her...

995
01:32:15,029 --> 01:32:16,496
it's your responsibility.

996
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:18,259
Fuck that. She knew what she was doing.

997
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:20,857
lt's not on us.

998
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:24,427
-Of course--
-Shut the fuck up, bitch! Get out. Now!

999
01:32:47,028 --> 01:32:52,022
And this is so Carla can send Lucy
back to Colombia.

1000
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:53,157
Okay.

1001
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:54,326
lf that's what she wants.

1002
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:01,668
One minute, please.

1003
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:06,443
l'll be back in a minute. Excuse me.

1004
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:57,255
l'm sorry.

1005
01:33:57,331 --> 01:33:59,299
l didn't mean to disturb you.

1006
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,561
l'm going back to Colombia.

1007
01:34:04,138 --> 01:34:07,938
l just wanted to say goodbye to Lucy.

1008
01:34:17,985 --> 01:34:19,475
She looks pretty.

1009
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:34,824
l don't understand why she never
said anything.

1010
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:38,637
We grew so far apart.

1011
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:52,703
Blanca.
