1
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,541
Hey, man, look at buddy
over there with that trumpet.

2
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,617
- That's the rock sound.
- That's a saxophone, man.

3
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:05,843
I don't give a fuck what it is.

4
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,544
Look like he sucking dick, man.

5
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,212
- Let's bust his head.
- It's whatever.

6
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,662
Hey.

7
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,703
I'll hit him with that one, kid.

8
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:27,534
Nah. He going to catch it
with this, dawg.

9
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,541
You going to catch a case, dawg.

10
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,907
Nah, man, that's too big, kid.

11
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,639
- I ain't going to jail for you, man.
- For real.

12
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,544
We ain't got to go to jail for you.
Fuck that shit.

13
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,911
Fuck!

14
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,007
What the fuck
was that?

15
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,713
- Who the fuck threw that?
- I think he went that way, man.

16
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,120
Let's go get him, man.

17
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,253
Blow them away.

18
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,186
Have 'em in your hand and crush them.

19
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,690
Destroy them.

20
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,953
They want you to.

21
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,495
They are your slaves.

22
00:04:57,597 --> 00:05:00,361
Put them out of their misery.

23
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,525
Nate Harris, you ready?

24
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,832
Tonight you become Nemesis,

25
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,496
the people's enemy.

26
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,872
The more you hate them,
the more they love you.

27
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,009
It's the weekend baby.
It's your host Mecca,

28
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,048
aka Grimore, the host with the most
from coast to coast.

29
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,584
I'm chillin' right now in the 305.

30
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:24,020
We're at the debut performance
of Dade County's next superstar, Nemesis.

31
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,523
The media, the streets,
the rap game loves you.

32
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,594
305, you holdin' it down right now.

33
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,219
But I gotta ask you one question.

34
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,854
Are you ready for the fame?

35
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,899
What's going on, 305?
It's your boy Hell Razor.

36
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,298
Now, I want y'all to give it up

37
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,960
for what y'all really came to see,

38
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,665
your Mr. Miami.

39
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,867
People, make some noise.

40
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,672
Nemesis.

41
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,308
Yeah.

42
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,540
Nemesis.

43
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,120
Raise a brick.

44
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,520
Yo, listen here.

45
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,524
Let's go.
I got my money up

46
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,253
'Cause I'm a solider

47
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,989
We ain't takin' none

48
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,564
'Cause we some soldiers

49
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,759
I'm prepared for war,
just like a soldier

50
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,462
Told you before,
man, we some soldiers

51
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:14,734
I got my money up
'cause I'm a soldier

52
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,001
We ain't givin' up

53
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,440
'Cause we some soldiers

54
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,408
I'm prepared for war

55
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,706
Just like a soldier

56
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,246
I told you before

57
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,645
'Cause we some soldiers

58
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,615
See, I was raised in the worst way

59
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,185
Waitin' on my own time

60
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,878
Represent the soldier life

61
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,478
Trapped in this world of crime

62
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,557
I came from the dirt

63
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,284
Watch me rise to the sky

64
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,690
I came to put in work

65
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,421
So I'ma ride until a die

66
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,554
Put a slice of the American pie

67
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,131
I need the whole thing

68
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,700
Killin' 'em softly, my nigga

69
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,234
And playin' no games

70
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,360
Better lace your boots

71
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,937
'Cause I'm the grand war

72
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,369
If you ain't real

73
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,964
Then what the hell you starin' for?

74
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,169
Until you walk a mile in my shoes

75
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:53,939
Don't judge me, just trust me

76
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,445
I'm front page news

77
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,015
The natural born leader

78
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,811
With the strength of the warrior

79
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,180
New world order

80
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,550
Go to war with the officers

81
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
Listen, this is a national emergency

82
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,655
You infidel assaulted, captured

83
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,818
From the currency

84
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:24,843
Yeah.

85
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,762
Yo.

86
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,836
Yeah, she like that.

87
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,964
Man, all them hoes like it like that.

88
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,099
No, we don't like it like that.

89
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,236
Mmn, shut up, ho.

90
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,441
Nate, Nate.

91
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,246
Dan and Jason want
to meet with us now.

92
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:08,718
- We can't be late for this.
- A meeting?

93
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:09,981
- Yes.
- Am I going?

94
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,454
- No.
- No?

95
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,751
Yo, you said this show was it, man.

96
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,793
Next time they talk to both of us.

97
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,259
It's probably about the label, man.

98
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,488
- Probably about the label, huh?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,189
- Yo, it better be, man.
- Stop being paranoid, man.

100
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,526
- You gonna get on.
- We have to go.

101
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,225
- All right, man. Get on that, man.
- All right.

102
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,393
Sounds kind of fishy.

103
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,765
Let's go over your
schedule for next week.

104
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,929
What's up?

105
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:27,096
MTV shoot on Monday,

106
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,800
and the previews party, that's at night.

107
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,422
Razor, relax, man. Chill out.

108
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,554
Why, you scared?

109
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,996
Look, they said it was
just for one show, all right?

110
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,567
I'll do the first one.
It'll be a big hit.

111
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,398
Then they'll put us
on an album together.

112
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,371
It better be, man.

113
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,805
How they gonna make you a spit?

114
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,706
You a writer, you ain't no rapper.

115
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,835
That's what I told them.

116
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,084
That shit is crazy.

117
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,382
Great start, man.

118
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,516
The comparin' you to 50,
which is good.

119
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,220
Man, we're gonna make you
the biggest star ever.

120
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,819
Gonna have to act a lot blacker, man.

121
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,559
He means more gangster.

122
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,396
That's ridiculous.

123
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,901
Are you a spokesman?
Because I coulda sworn

124
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,129
you were a manager.

125
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,263
To get there, we gotta
spark some controversy.

126
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,432
We gotta have some bad boy appeal.

127
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,066
You need some kind
of street credibility.

128
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,906
50 Cent was shot 16 times.

129
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,309
You gotta keep it real, Nate.

130
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,348
People live vicariously through you.

131
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,417
They want to be able
to walk in your shoes.

132
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,179
They want to be able to see themself

133
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,776
out of the ground, out of the ghetto,

134
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,048
and getting paid.

135
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,714
But in order to do that,

136
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,416
you gotta become one of them.

137
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:54,925
You act too uppity,
and they turn on you.

138
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,551
You gotta act like them...

139
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,257
stupid, selfish, sheep, tough, mean,
straight-up gangster.

140
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,492
They gotta be able to relate.

141
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,091
I mean, you can't be
a fuckin' house nigger.

142
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,396
Say what?

143
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,437
Look, this is what we're gonna do.

144
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,064
Tomorrow, at the pre-release party,

145
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,802
we're gonna unveil your myth.

146
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,605
We've detailed a very
specific history for you...

147
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,304
how many times you've been shot,

148
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,404
growing up fatherless on the streets,

149
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,107
body counts... simple things like that.

150
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:19,241
Should I tell him?

151
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,546
You should.

152
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,985
How do you feel about
owning your own label, man?

153
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:28,087
President of Nemesis Records,
or whatever you want to call it.

154
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,890
I haven't even started my own career yet.

155
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,022
Look, just call it
a show of faith, all right?

156
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,293
Bring us a new artist. We'll do the rest.

157
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,368
- A new artist?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,165
Razor.

159
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,004
Razor, um... Not Razor.

160
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,441
So, to Nem,

161
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,943
and all his success.

162
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,206
Don't worry about Razor.

163
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,576
We'll take care of him, okay?

164
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,876
To Nem.

165
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,217
Yeah.

166
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,806
You said it yourself, man.

167
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,775
You said you would do
anything for your pops, right?

168
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,851
Don't worry about the money.

169
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:30,080
We're gonna be all right.

170
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,083
Hey, Nemesis.

171
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,414
I believe we were called for.

172
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,988
Go on inside. Have a seat.

173
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,519
I'm Rachel.

174
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,495
This is Jen.

175
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,089
And that's Sheri.

176
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:20,069
I'm Nate... I'm... I'm Nemesis.

177
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,436
Yeah.

178
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,537
All right, all right.

179
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,443
About to get it crunk up in here.

180
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,611
Yeah, real crunk.

181
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:37,179
So, Nemesis,

182
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,519
what do you want us to do?

183
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,785
Okay, now...

184
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,624
You, you go over there.

185
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,095
Me?

186
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,223
Nah, the one with the big titties.

187
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,858
Yeah, you.

188
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,238
Yeah.

189
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,739
Yeah, bend over.

190
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:00,210
Um, now... now, you two...

191
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,940
You two hoes start kissing.

192
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,640
Come on, start kissing.

193
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,248
Oh, no... Stop, stop, stop, fuck.

194
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,616
Skip that part.

195
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:13,624
Start taking each other clothes off.

196
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,990
- Yeah.
- Me?

197
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,792
No, not you. You stay bent over.

198
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,902
Yeah, y'all get ready.

199
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:25,766
'Cause I'm about to come in there,

200
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,202
and I'm gonna be tearing things up.

201
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:33,637
So just... just be prepared.

202
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,678
Are you gonna start with me?

203
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,194
Drove by your house this morning.

204
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,821
Saw a red car.

205
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,058
It was, um...

206
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,190
Nikki.

207
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,098
No, Sophie.

208
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,465
Sophie?

209
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:01,039
You don't even know her name.

210
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,301
Who are you anyways?

211
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,808
Come on, gimme a break, Pops.

212
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,505
It's going down, was what they said.

213
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:13,449
Voice echoed throughout the airwaves
of the entire city.

214
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:16,214
Hundreds of thousands of radios

215
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,880
projecting the same message.

216
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,550
The new up and coming
sensation, Nemesis,

217
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:23,822
was blastin' the mic.

218
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,521
Nemesis.

219
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,223
What's the name of your piece?

220
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,028
"Soldier."

221
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,624
What's it about? Who's it about?

222
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,771
Look, I gotta go, Pops.

223
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,142
Got a photo shoot.

224
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,237
Nate, every successful piece
has got to have a story.

225
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:49,349
Thanks for the breakfast, Pop.

226
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,199
What's goin' on, America?

227
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,332
It's your boy Nemesis,

228
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,137
and welcome to my crib.

229
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,542
The teeth are falling
outta my mouth, man.

230
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:15,978
It not gonna work, man.

231
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,382
It's your boy Nemesis,
and welcome to my crib.

232
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,147
I'm all right. Let's...

233
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,014
And action.

234
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,524
What's going on, America?

235
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,594
It's your boy Nemesis,
and welcome to my crib.

236
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:33,062
You know the 305 has the most
beautiful women in the world.

237
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,326
And I had to get 'em to come through
to show your boy love.

238
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,460
And what's a pool party
without some barbecue over there?

239
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,061
You know us black folks
love the chicken and watermelon, right?

240
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,038
Hey, yo, don't forget my album,
<i>Cut Throat,</i>

241
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,076
- coming this summer.
- Yeah, that's right.

242
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,475
And what's a party without
the entourage in the building?

243
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,807
Entourage, where you at?

244
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,015
What you cooking over here, man?

245
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,713
Fried chicken.
You see how that happens?

246
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,688
That shit just pop up
and it gets big like that.

247
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,851
Look at that. Fried chicken
on the grill. Hell nah.

248
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,394
Fried chicken on the grill, son.

249
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,689
You see that?
Who wants some chicken?

250
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,923
I want some chicken!

251
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,326
Look at their beggin' ass.

252
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,527
Now let's go check out these cars.

253
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,399
That was great, guys. That was perfect.

254
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,630
We're gonna come around
with the camera.

255
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,797
Mark comin' around with the camera.

256
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,636
He's gonna take footage of you guys.

257
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:18,107
Razor Ric. He's comin' up next, baby.

258
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,075
Don't forget.
I didn't forget about you, boy.

259
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,476
Didn't forget about you.

260
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,275
Hey, Stan, what's up, man?

261
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,680
These the kinda things you get
when you playing with us.

262
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:26,842
Playing the big time.

263
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,613
Hey, Nemesis,
can I talk to you for a sec?

264
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:30,154
Look, I'm busy right now.
Talk to someone else.

265
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,280
'Bout to go there and grill
a piece of chicken.

266
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,188
I like chicken.

267
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:35,385
I want to get into the game.

268
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,086
- And what game would that be?
- The rap game.

269
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,064
I'm Pearl.

270
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,963
I want you to check me out, all right?

271
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,599
Hey, you know what?

272
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,405
I'll check you out.

273
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,949
Razor, Razor, look.

274
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,886
We were just talking
about Nem's new label.

275
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,048
What about it?

276
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,557
We want to put you under it.

277
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,785
What I tell you about
messing with my head?

278
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:09,792
I'm not messing with your head.

279
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:10,919
He's real cute
when he does that.

280
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,224
Don't patronize me, cracker.

281
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,299
Listen, listen, listen.
Just talk to Nem,

282
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,924
and he'll fill you in with
the details, all right?

283
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,731
Yeah, man. You need a Tic Tac, bro.

284
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,862
Jerkoffs, man.

285
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,369
Razor Ric versus Nemesis.

286
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,206
Could be like Biggie and Pac.

287
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,370
A rap feud.

288
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,708
A rap war.

289
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,442
Genius, baby.

290
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,018
Hey, don't touch me like that, man.

291
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,314
I'm serious.

292
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,899
So it's true about your own label?

293
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:53,062
Jason and Stan already
told me you picked me, kid.

294
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,402
Of course, that goes
without saying, right?

295
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:56,667
Yeah, of course, man.

296
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:58,299
Blood brothers, man.

297
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,809
Blood brothers.

298
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,574
Look at these two
booty partners over there.

299
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,012
All jokes aside...

300
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,518
y'all two niggas gay, man.

301
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:08,608
Hey, Nem,

302
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,585
we want to get on the label, too, though.

303
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,917
You know we all boys, man.

304
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,049
Get up outta here, man.

305
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,059
Both of ya, raise up.

306
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,061
Yeah, I'ma holler at you, man.

307
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,974
The only work y'all two gonna be doing
is on each other mics.

308
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,490
All right, that's perfect, perfect.

309
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,227
Yeah, I'm just gonna
get some video now. Is that cool?

310
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,235
Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

311
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,904
Keep your head up.

312
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,476
Nem, my man.

313
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,442
Your work is on fire
with the young ones right now.

314
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:42,912
So tell me, who was
your role model growing up?

315
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,182
I ain't never had no role models
but myself.

316
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,618
Sure wasn't my father.

317
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,586
Son of a bitch skipped
town before I could walk.

318
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,334
Yo, Raymond.

319
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:05,596
Hold up a second.

320
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,796
Come here.

321
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,702
Wait right over there.

322
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,900
You know, there's no
easy way to put this,

323
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,604
but, yeah, basically,
we got to cut you off, man.

324
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,203
What?

325
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,409
Hey, save your breath for the sax, man.

326
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:22,214
You might need it for your next gig.

327
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,458
Well, see you around, slick.

328
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,760
And, uh, good luck.

329
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,965
Don't worry about the money.

330
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,940
We're gonna be all right.

331
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:49,036
Doesn't matter how many people watch.

332
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,375
One day they will.

333
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,609
And I've just go to do
what I've got to do.

334
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,084
Change how people feel.

335
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,518
When they walk into a room,

336
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,681
I got to make them feel the music,

337
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,691
show them God's love.

338
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:04,091
That's what it's all about,

339
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,458
helping others,

340
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,964
touching others,

341
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,829
changing others.

342
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:14,099
One day, I'm gonna
do that and make money.

343
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,077
Yeah, yeah?

344
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,303
All right.

345
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,381
And now you're number 1 in the MIA?

346
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,608
Hold on. Cut. Cut.

347
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,944
All right, listen.

348
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,281
I'm gonna need you to
give it to me again.

349
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,752
Just tell me about the album,

350
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:32,653
but yo, hype that shit, bro.

351
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,023
All right, I'm lettin' all y'all know
What's really goin' on in the 305.

352
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
This your boy Nemesis.

353
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,787
Look out for my new album
and my single "Soldier"

354
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,298
comin' fresh out the studio
and into your ears.

355
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:43,368
Get your hand ready.

356
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,560
Crack your Dutchess open.

357
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,797
It's gonna be badder, radder, and fatter

358
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,668
than everything that's
out right now. You heard me?

359
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,505
He just say "radder?"

360
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,512
Wigger.

361
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,348
If you want to be alone,
why are you still in the club?

362
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:38,980
Well, who said I wanted to be alone?

363
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,992
Then, why are you
when you can be with anyone?

364
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:47,023
Here, take a hit.

365
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,258
No, I don't smoke.

366
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,334
Oh, you don't smoke?

367
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,492
Anymore.

368
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,399
So all the songs are lies then?

369
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,596
- Smoke and mirrors?
- No.

370
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,503
Okay, here you go, big shot.

371
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,735
I was smoking when you was in diapers.

372
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,902
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

373
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,988
Yeah, smokin' since
you were in diapers, right?

374
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,821
Yeah, I bet you were.

375
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,189
It's been a while.

376
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:18,421
All right.

377
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,519
Let's go have a seat.

378
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,360
Those not regular cigarettes.

379
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,093
Oh, sure they were.

380
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:29,306
Soaking it all in, huh?

381
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,467
Ah, just getting some fresh air, man.

382
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,600
Ready to hit the main floor.

383
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,178
Do my thing with the label, you know?

384
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,941
Big plans. Got big plans.

385
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,243
Yeah, about that, man.

386
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,013
Um, I got bad news.

387
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,554
Bad news? What kind of bad news?

388
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,351
You off the label, man.

389
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,857
Off the label?

390
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,119
What you mean I'm off the label?

391
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:50,660
I don't know. Maybe it's
paranoia or something,

392
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,751
but people are scared of you.

393
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,490
People like who?

394
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,622
People like who?

395
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,995
Nem wants you off the label.

396
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:59,466
Nem? Are you serious?

397
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,936
I know. And I couldn't believe it myself.

398
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,631
But if you want to find out,
ask him yourself.

399
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:04,038
I will.

400
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,541
I'll do that, all right?

401
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,441
You see him, you tell him
I'm looking for him.

402
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,344
I will.

403
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,383
I definitely will.

404
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:26,994
So you a videographer
along with being a rapper and a model?

405
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,862
Yeah, just like you're a gangster rapper.

406
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,401
What does that mean?

407
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,232
Oh, you know what it means.

408
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,067
Don't think too hard about it.

409
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:36,800
Whatever.

410
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,001
By the way, what'd you think
about some of my tracks?

411
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,873
Oh, your tracks?

412
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,708
I thought it was okay, but I...

413
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,304
What are you doing here, man?

414
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:45,678
VIPs in there.

415
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:46,944
That's where you belong.

416
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,747
- Let's go, man.
- I gotta go.

417
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:50,446
- All right.
- I'll work on that for you.

418
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,079
Okay. All right.

419
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,558
Where you going, big boy?

420
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,863
Back to the VIP, pop some bottles?

421
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,268
Yeah, man. Actually, it's kind of hot...

422
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:10,535
No, no. You ain't goin' nowhere.

423
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,132
What's going on, man?

424
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,974
You tell me what's going on.

425
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,513
Oh, don't play dumb now.

426
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:17,639
They done told me, man.

427
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,807
They told me everything.

428
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,511
You mean to tell me after all these years
I put into making you,

429
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,815
like that, you cut me loose?

430
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,946
The fuck are you
talking about, Razor?

431
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:26,580
Shut the fuck up, man.

432
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:31,060
Everything that comes out
of your dirty mouth is lies.

433
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,062
You talk when I say talk.

434
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,756
Talk, nigga.

435
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,424
Relax, man. There's all
these cameras over here.

436
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,502
All the cameras?

437
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:38,830
Everybody gather around.

438
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:40,837
Everybody, come up here.

439
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,430
Special bulletin. Right here, yeah.

440
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,442
You see your boy Nate?

441
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,273
He got so much to say, right?

442
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,473
He be on stage,
he be rappin' his ass off.

443
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,709
Where your rap at now, nigga?

444
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,718
Spit something.

445
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,253
Man, you outta control, dude.

446
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:59,823
Yo, man, get the fuck outta here, man.

447
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,222
Where the gangsta at now?

448
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,385
Look at the gangsta.

449
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:06,658
Why you didn't do something,
gangsta rapper?

450
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,756
Why you didn't strike back?

451
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,801
You a fake, man.

452
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,370
I'm the realest.

453
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:14,768
I'm what they want you to be.

454
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,238
I am hip hop.

455
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,603
You got that?

456
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,644
You remember
when we was kids, man?

457
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,009
Blood brothers? Huh?

458
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,274
If it weren't for me,

459
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,906
you'd be in some fuckin' bar in Detroit,

460
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,815
playing the fucking flute
like your daddy, nigga.

461
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,148
Now blow on that.

462
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,586
Fuck you, man.

463
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,594
You ain't nothin' without me, nigga.

464
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,856
I'ma break you down, nigga.

465
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,591
- You a dead man.
- Hey, hey, hey.

466
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,996
Break you down, nigga!

467
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,260
Get the fucking camera out of here, man.

468
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,392
Go on.

469
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:47,869
Hell Razor, motherfucker.

470
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,497
You a dead man, yo.

471
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,408
What up, Miami?
It's your boy, Mecca, aka Grimore,

472
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,308
your host with the most
from coast to coast.

473
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,505
Today we're talking about Nemesis

474
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,016
and his run-in with
his entourage member, Razor Ric.

475
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,585
Now, what I'm hearin'
is Razor accused him

476
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,812
of making up his life story.

477
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,947
And I want y'all to call in right now
and let me know what y'all think.

478
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,389
Is Nemesis real or not?

479
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,824
Jerome from Carol City, you're on.

480
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:12,055
Ain't nothing real about Nemesis.

481
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,721
He been a fake all along.

482
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,800
When you ever heard
him involved with anything real?

483
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,094
No drugs, no shootings...

484
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,464
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

485
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,969
I gotta cut you off on this one.

486
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,165
Are you telling me that to be real,
you have to shoot somebody?

487
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,333
What if he's not really like that?

488
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,241
Wouldn't that be, like,
fake the fake in being real?

489
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,405
Man, the streets know
what is and what ain't.

490
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,346
I've been in the streets all my life.

491
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,042
I knew that nigga when he was coming up.

492
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,052
Razor is real, Nemesis ain't.

493
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,019
I've been around since
the genesis of Nemesis.

494
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,216
That nigga is a total fugazi, total fake.

495
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,192
total lame... And I'll bust him
in his brains the day I see him

496
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,091
try to ever act like he real again.

497
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,959
How's it feel to get your first airplay?

498
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,760
Told you we'd make you a star, man.

499
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,528
Airplay, excuse me?

500
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,624
Nem's all over.

501
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,998
He's the hottest topic out there.

502
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,867
It's hype, Michelle, great hype.

503
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,838
Hype for who? He's getting destroyed.

504
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,273
He needed a little bad publicity.

505
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:00,401
It's good.

506
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,309
This isn't bad. This is terrible.

507
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,381
Calm down, Michelle.

508
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,450
We wouldn't want you to become
the first black woman to turn red.

509
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,879
Oh, you want to go, Michelle?

510
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,084
Don't let the suit fool ya, sweetheart.

511
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:25,193
You need to learn from
Michelle, man. Shit.

512
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,895
She a little bit
more aggressive than you are.

513
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,166
What happened to Razor?

514
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,764
Guess he assumed
that he was on the label,

515
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:34,606
but freaked out when
he found out that he wasn't.

516
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:38,080
Look, I need you to
lay low tonight, all right?

517
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,582
Things are really heating up.

518
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,276
There'll be security
waiting for you outside

519
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,150
your house when you get home.

520
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:41,405
Is this yours?

521
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,538
You wrote these?

522
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,841
And you drew these?

523
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,851
Nah, you lying to me.

524
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,481
Did someone help you?

525
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,393
You look like a school type.

526
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,157
I need someone who can write.

527
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:03,792
None of the cats where I roll
can write their own name correct.

528
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,460
Me, I rap.

529
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,003
That's all I do is rap.

530
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,301
You looking at that guy over there?

531
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,741
I mean, look at him.

532
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:14,834
That's sad.

533
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,278
You gotta have a fantasy
to be somebody.

534
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,542
You get it?

535
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,674
Let's get together and colab,

536
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,411
do something.

537
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,783
- What's your name, G?
- Nate.

538
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:26,448
Ricky. Call me Razor.

539
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,903
So nice of you to let us join in

540
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,031
on your little studio session, Razor.

541
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,407
Man, if you heard what Nem been sayin'...

542
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,504
Man, he's starting to dig a hole
up in your ass.

543
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:55,108
Man, shut the fuck up real quick.

544
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:57,978
Here's what we're gonna do.

545
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,785
First we're gonna
declare war on Nemesis,

546
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:04,350
with this track right here
I'm about to drop tonight.

547
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,299
And then
we're gonna enforce the war.

548
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:12,266
You got that?

549
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,235
I got it.

550
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,731
You got that, Gunplay?

551
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:21,043
So let the games begin.

552
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:37,587
Hey, Jay, Jay, Jay... Enough, look.

553
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:40,730
I stuck you with Pansy Stanzy

554
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,732
'cause I thought you could
handle the punk. Of course,

555
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,529
we've seen the way you
deal with situations.

556
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,627
All we gotta do is take
a look at the Razor Ric fiasco.

557
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,137
Well, that was intentional.

558
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,228
- Look, I was trying...
- Intentional,

559
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,830
to make Nem look like a pussy?

560
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,307
Look... Thank you.

561
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,241
It's not my fault he didn't fight.

562
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,937
You gotta know your men, Jay.

563
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,708
Look, if your partner won't show up

564
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,249
to a meeting with the CEO
of Renaissance Records,

565
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,945
<i>moi,</i> then you
shouldn't include him.

566
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,956
Look, Stan, he said he's on his way.

567
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:09,288
So he should be...

568
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,521
should be here in a minute. So, um...

569
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,893
He should be here.
So I'm really sorry about that,

570
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,556
but he said he... he's on his way.

571
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,998
So tell me about the operation.

572
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,067
Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,474
Okay, um...

574
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,602
it's this guy.

575
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:31,311
This guy.

576
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,440
This guy.

577
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,478
This guy. This guy.

578
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,224
Look, I wasn't trying
to waste your time here.

579
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,452
You're wasting my time right now.

580
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,255
What do I care about unknown rappers?

581
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,852
What brings me down here?

582
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,898
Business.

583
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,626
Headline.

584
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,996
Nemesis.

585
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:52,592
The choir boy himself.

586
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,467
Look, I don't think you get what we're

587
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,437
- trying to do here, Stan.
- Oh, I get it.

588
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,906
I get it.

589
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,136
You wanna turn Nem
into some kind of pubic gangster

590
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:02,610
by getting his
best buddy to fight him...

591
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,683
do battle, give him street credibility?

592
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,216
Only Nem doesn't fight.

593
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,649
He lays down like a dog.

594
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:09,777
- Thank you.
- Look.

595
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,184
People think he's dangerous now.

596
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,780
All right? All we gotta do
is just pull back...

597
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,017
Pull back a little bit?

598
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,093
- Yes, pull back.
- Where to?

599
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,218
Sesame Street?

600
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,422
Nem's a target, okay?

601
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,465
He's a stool pigeon.

602
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,501
Fans are about to revolt.

603
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,537
Nobody, and I mean nobody,
likes a pussy.

604
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,299
He just needs to work on his image.

605
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,965
He needs...
Razor's about to blow up.

606
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,043
- Razor?
- Yeah, Razor.

607
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,168
That was a show.

608
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:36,746
A show? You think this
is a game to these people?

609
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,146
These fans, you don't think
they take it seriously?

610
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,615
You think they'd be
sitting on drug corners,

611
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,380
knockin' up baby mamas,
wielding guns like the Wild, Wild West

612
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,718
if they didn't take this shit seriously?

613
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:48,558
You gotta give 'em
something to follow.

614
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,853
Give 'em an example.

615
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,191
You gotta go all the way, Jay.

616
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,762
Look,

617
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,602
Jay... Jason.

618
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,573
Jason, look at me.

619
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:08,704
The fans want blood,

620
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,178
so we have the rappers preach it.

621
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,044
The rappers preach it
so the fans want it more.

622
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,378
It's a circle of life.

623
00:34:13,484 --> 00:34:16,180
We're all victims here,
and you know this.

624
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,524
We gotta up the ante.

625
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,687
305's ready to profit from war.

626
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,855
Get Razor back into the fold.

627
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,955
He is your franchise.

628
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,433
If Nem survives Razor and the fans,

629
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,699
well, hey, he's a frickin' legend.

630
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,240
If not, well,

631
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,469
he's worth more dead than alive.

632
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,103
If your boys become lames,
we lose fans.

633
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:45,148
We lose fans,

634
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,149
might have to lose you.

635
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,446
You got me?

636
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:53,251
Yeah. Yeah.

637
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:56,224
Do me a favor.

638
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:01,422
Tell Stan I said "Fuck you."

639
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,908
Razor?

640
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,775
Hey, man, it's Jason.

641
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,281
I got good news, man.

642
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,094
Artists only.

643
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,062
Man, that's messed up.

644
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,690
Man, I guess you gotta be somebody
to get up in there, man.

645
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,200
What you mean? We is somebody.

646
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,860
Hell, wait till they hear me rhyme.

647
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,298
Bitch asses.

648
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,650
Hey, now

649
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:59,620
How many niggas wanna play now?

650
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,818
Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

651
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,758
Whatcha, whatcha gotta say now?

652
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,762
Nigga, say now, lay it down

653
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,161
- Hey, hey, now
- Hey, hey, hey

654
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:10,666
How many niggas
wanna play now?

655
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,999
Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

656
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,766
Whatcha, whatcha
gotta say now?

657
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:17,340
Nigga, say now, lay it down

658
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:19,671
My guns are big enough
to take your hood out

659
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,369
Swipe a coat, yo, bullets flyin'

660
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,037
Gotta move it like Travolta

661
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,978
Slide in a truck without a chauffeur

662
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,709
Million dollar signature

663
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,409
Two just to get me on a poster

664
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,510
These niggas didn't do it
like they s'posed ta

665
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:32,111
Claiming they soldiers, turn bitch

666
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:33,554
When I'm flamin' the toaster

667
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,683
Sorry, I don't care about your rap

668
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,488
Man, I got a tech that will

669
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,358
blow clouds of smoke through our flesh

670
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,328
Bring you a little closer to death

671
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,332
Razor blade clos to your neck

672
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:44,799
If you owe me a check

673
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:46,631
O.G.'s know me on the strip

674
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,671
And I'm smooth like Goldie with a chick

675
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,035
Ma, I'm Moby with the dick

676
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,234
Haters wanna blow me with a clip

677
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,311
Man, I got shorties that'll cut you

678
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,640
while they blowing you a kiss

679
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,008
I'm a breath of fresh air

680
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:58,342
The best this year

681
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,711
For you blind motherfuckers

682
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,011
I'ma make shit clear

683
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,052
- Hey, now
- Hey, hey, hey.

684
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,951
How many niggas wanna play now?

685
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,183
Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

686
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,519
Don't do it, don't do it.

687
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,287
Whatcha, whatcha gotta say now?

688
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,225
Nigga, say now, lay it down

689
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:13,888
- Hey, hey, now
- Hey, hey, hey.

690
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,932
How many niggas wanna play now?

691
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:19,628
Don't make me kidnap your
kids from the playground

692
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,136
Whatcha, whatcha gotta say now?

693
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,766
Nigga, say now, lay it down

694
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,341
It's over.

695
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,777
That man is gonna blow up.

696
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,577
What were we brought here for, fellas?

697
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:08,311
Come on, Michelle.
You gotta hear this.

698
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,477
I mean, that's hot.

699
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,316
What's this gotta do with me, man?

700
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,755
Well, Nate, you hear
that passion in his voice?

701
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,987
The way he, um, personalize it,

702
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,086
almost as if he's
directing it at someone?

703
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,324
That's what you need, man.

704
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,832
You guys write the songs for me.

705
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,424
What am I supposed to do about that?

706
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:27,731
Come on, come on, come on.
That's irrelevant, bro.

707
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:29,965
We're not in the business
of excuses here.

708
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,565
We're in the business of business.

709
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,838
And right now, Razor is
very good business, huh?

710
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,742
- Fuck Razor.
- That's it.

711
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,178
That's it.

712
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,944
That's the spirit. Fire back, literally.

713
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,714
I mean, no one's buying
your shit right now.

714
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:44,788
Literally, again.

715
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,481
What are you trying to encourage?

716
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,558
You want to stay in this game?

717
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,957
You gotta make some waves.

718
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,326
I mean, the people
gotta believe in you.

719
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:54,898
Fight back.

720
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,229
I mean, seriously, bro,

721
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,565
you've gotta have some fire.

722
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,437
You want some girls?

723
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,871
Is that it?

724
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:07,706
Or maybe he'd like some men.

725
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,779
Fuck you.

726
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,107
Very disrespectful, Jason.

727
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:12,273
Enough of this shit.
Man, I'm outta here.

728
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:23,316
Yo, Nem is a fake, a fugazi.

729
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,054
He's cheated his way to the top.

730
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,153
They say he struggled to live as a kid.

731
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,856
He hustled his way in.

732
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,263
The truth here, Mecca,

733
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,563
is that one of his
setup boys hooked him in.

734
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,400
Razor Ric, he's the talent behind it all.

735
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,201
Ice Cube behind N.W.A.

736
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,969
Nate ain't no thug.

737
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:40,771
He ain't even from the hood.

738
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,872
Razor's real.

739
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,313
He's from the dirt and the grind.

740
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,782
And so is his first track.

741
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,147
I mean it's hot.

742
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,550
Where you been hidin', Razor?

743
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,246
Damn, Miami's been dreamin' about you.

744
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:55,553
Fuck Nem. You the truth.

745
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,091
Hell, yeah, man.

746
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,957
He ain't nothin' but an old creep.

747
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,291
That's all he is.

748
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,931
Hey, man, so... Y'all remember
that bitch from the other night, right?

749
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,300
The one that done
hit me in the face?

750
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,101
Yeah, so I done got at her, man.

751
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,435
She done took me back to her place.

752
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:16,275
But I guess she forgot
what time her old man came home.

753
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,109
So I'm up in there, man.
I'm beatin' that thing.

754
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,204
Just...

755
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,343
And man, I done, I done seen something

756
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,546
move out the side of my eyes.

757
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,714
I done turned. I ain't see nothing.

758
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:28,382
Man, I look back forward.

759
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,426
She got them mirrors
up in the headrests.

760
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:31,620
You know what I'm talking about?

761
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:35,130
Man, I see old skinny white boy
coming with a golf stick, man.

762
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,427
Well, I done slid up
out that shit, dawg.

763
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,833
You know, I'm running around the room,
man. He chasing me, man.

764
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,734
My dick's swinging
back and forth and shit.

765
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,864
I'm trying to get to my pants,
'cause I got my five.

766
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,272
But I left the shit in my
pants. I got it wrapped up.

767
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:49,039
So I'm tryin' to squiggle
up under the bed and pull my pants

768
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,671
on account of that...
man, he done swollen up

769
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,841
like David Banner, dawg, and just...

770
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,442
Lift the bed. Threw the bed up.

771
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:57,885
So I done grabbed my pants,

772
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,819
and then I roll in the bathroom
and locked the door, man.

773
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,448
He beatin' on the door.
"Open this fucker!"

774
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,083
But man, I done got my fire.

775
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,128
Just as he open the door, I go "bum bum."

776
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,457
You know, what's up now?

777
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,997
Man, his whole expression changed.

778
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,895
I mean, he came through the door...

779
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,365
"Oh. Oh, listen, man.

780
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,369
"Listen, I don't want any problems or
anything, bro.

781
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,768
"You know, I don't
even care about her.

782
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,100
"I don't even love her."

783
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:18,334
And I'm thinking,
he got all nice and shit.

784
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:21,934
What if I... I would have
murdered his ass, dawg. I'm telling you.

785
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,241
You know you ain't never murdered
nobody in your life, man.

786
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,440
Let me tell you something.
And the only reason I ain't

787
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,109
murdered that motherfucker, dawg,

788
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,347
is because I ain't had no clothes on.

789
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,685
I'm saying, I ain't never
murdered without no clothes.

790
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,521
If you was butt-ass naked,
would you shoot somebody?

791
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,862
Just sayin', man. Dang.

792
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,867
What the fuck is this nigga
looking at, man?

793
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,636
Bitch-ass nigger!
What the fuck you lookin' at?

794
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:55,211
Yo! You don't know what
the fuck you looking at, man!

795
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,542
Yeah. Walking around with
his old lady's shirt on.

796
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,740
That light green, man.

797
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,544
He's looking like a Jolly Rancher.

798
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,017
Why don't you all
go home with that nonsense?

799
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,883
What? What the fuck...

800
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,583
Nigger, what you say?

801
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,749
What?

802
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,885
Get in the car, man. Come on.

803
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,303
Now what's the problem?
Y'all need to chill, bitch...

804
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,672
What's going on, man?

805
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:30,110
What you all doing over there?

806
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,273
Come on, man. Let that man go.

807
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,284
Come on, man.

808
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,444
What's going on, man?

809
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,298
Sure, Nem's a fake, a fugazi.

810
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,966
He's cheated his way to the top.

811
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,271
They say he struggled to live as a kid.

812
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,572
He hustled his way in,

813
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,046
that one of his setup boys hooked him in.

814
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,879
Razor Ric. He's the talent behind it all.

815
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,146
Ice Cube behind N.W.A.

816
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,281
Nate. Nate.

817
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:16,791
Yeah.

818
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,759
There's some white girl out there,
here for an interview?

819
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,391
She looks harmless.

820
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,305
All right. So, Nemesis.

821
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:30,771
They say you've been putting on an act.

822
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,035
- Is it true?
- That's right.

823
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,474
So it's right. You have been acting?

824
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,274
No, I... they have been saying that.

825
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,781
All right. Okay.
What do you got to say?

826
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:41,544
I got to say it's all false.

827
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,711
Ain't none of it true.
It's all been made up.

828
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,517
- What, your image?
- No, man. The accusations.

829
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,387
Accusations.

830
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:50,357
That's a pretty big word
for some street cat.

831
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,053
You sure you're not
in character right now?

832
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,629
Turn the camera off.

833
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:55,255
- Look, man. I just want to get this...
- Turn it off.

834
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,357
- Look, I think this shit's hot...
- Turn the camera off!

835
00:43:58,836 --> 00:43:59,860
All right.

836
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,995
Turning it off.

837
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,431
Okay.

838
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:08,506
It's off.

839
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,603
What the hell are you
tryin' to do to me, huh?

840
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:12,978
Are you really angry,
or is this just an act, too?

841
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,880
Wha...

842
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,118
Look, man.

843
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:22,283
All I want to know
is what's more real, all right?

844
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,293
The people out there,
they're asking the same thing.

845
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,125
They want to know. You want
to set the record straight or not?

846
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,062
I just want to know
what's more real, okay?

847
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:32,158
You tell me. Nemesis or Nate?

848
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,134
Nemesis. Nemesis. Nate.

849
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,830
- Oh, yeah. That's cute, right?
- Nate. Nemesis.

850
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,203
Yeah, you know what's real, huh?
A white rapper chick!

851
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,141
Aw, Nemesis. You're
so cute when you smile!

852
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,110
Wait, you're frowning now. I like that.

853
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:46,410
Ain't nothing cute or sweet about me,
sweetheart. I'm all man, okay?

854
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,946
You're all man.
Razor sure don't seem to think so.

855
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:54,616
Well, fuck Razor!
I'll whup his ass and bang his groupies.

856
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,991
That's the first time
I believed you all day, soldier.

857
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,496
I ain't gonna lie.

858
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:03,793
It's kinda hot.

859
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,028
That's why you need me.
To bring out the real you.

860
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,865
It's the first time
I've seen you like that.

861
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:13,431
No holding back
is the only way to be

862
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,205
If you feel it, shout aloud

863
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,713
It's all about the beat

864
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,250
Yeah

865
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:22,978
I like that

866
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,111
Come on

867
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,752
Everybody say S and C

868
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,917
Gonna lose 'em, but had to get G's

869
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,619
And I made my muh-cross
that showed you had to floss

870
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,959
I'm a big bad girl
I'll show you who's boss

871
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,895
Got Hummers, Mercedes,
Bentleys, Ferraris

872
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:37,830
We be over the globe
sippin' on Bacardi

873
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,766
And I dance all night
in the club and party

874
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:41,770
And I got outside my Masarati

875
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,965
Then I'll show you VIP,
ya down the Cristal

876
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,701
And I'm gettin' so high,
thinkin' bitches are tall

877
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,709
What? All I have to do
is just mention me

878
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,006
Get rich off it,
you know it's all about the beat

879
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,843
A B C D E F G

880
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,883
I can walk a straight line
ain't nothin' wrong with me

881
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:55,849
And what comes next, it ryhmes with G

882
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,887
I just took thou 'cause that's how I be

883
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,853
Worked out like a milk shake
a single shake

884
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,822
And make no mistake that I ain't fake

885
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,950
I get rich off this track
didn't know it was whack ooh

886
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,722
What do they say, no one cares anyway

887
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,763
Don't hardly gets a ride
and hope it don't fall

888
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:09,856
And I say what I please
'cause I just do me

889
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,958
And you know that I won't just let it be

890
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,404
'Cause we some soldiers

891
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:18,441
I'm preparin' for war just like a soldier

892
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,943
Thought I told you before
that we some soldiers

893
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,980
I got my money y'all
'cause I'm a soldier

894
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:27,915
But we ain't givin' up
'cause we some soldiers

895
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:31,419
I'm preparin' for war,
just like a soldier

896
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:34,923
Thought I told you before
that we some soldiers

897
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,661
Yes.

898
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,291
Hey, it's Michelle. Can I come in?

899
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,596
Yes, you can.

900
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:49,895
- Come here.
- What's up?

901
00:46:50,007 --> 00:46:51,770
- I have great news.
- What's going on?

902
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,706
Capacity crowd for yet another show.

903
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,278
Oh, yeah. And I heard
they want to introduce you

904
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,108
- to some guy named Ben Green.
- Who is Ben Green?

905
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,943
I don't know. He's really shady.
Some kind of jerk.

906
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,778
- But just ignore him.
- Well, I can handle it.

907
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,181
- Nate.
- What?

908
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,380
Have you been smoking?

909
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,124
- No.
- No?

910
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:12,886
Have you been drinking?

911
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:15,787
Maybe just a little bit.

912
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,696
Drunk. Drunk.

913
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,098
Nate, you supposed to wait to get drunk.

914
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:21,000
At least let me go over
the assessment...

915
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,199
Don't you ever try that again.

916
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,143
Do you understand?

917
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,446
Are you serious?

918
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,184
You know, well, just go home, then.

919
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,345
Boring-ass trick.

920
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,768
Hey, Nem.

921
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,368
Michelle.

922
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,843
Always a pleasure.

923
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,277
All right. This is the situation.

924
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,511
All the public knows is that your
lifestyle is totally unaffected by all this.

925
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,678
So in order for you
to keep your lifestyle,

926
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:14,553
I'd like to introduce you
to my main man, Ben Green.

927
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,718
An expert that really gonna flaunt
your little bad boy creed, okay?

928
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,456
- Ben? Okay.
- Pleasure.

929
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,122
You guys go at it.

930
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,200
Listen, I got a lot of things
in store for you, my brother.

931
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,292
- A lot of things.
- Hi, Ben.

932
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,303
Ah. You must be Michelle, the manager.

933
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,736
- Yeah.
- Beautiful face.

934
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,432
What a fantastic job
you're doing, sweetheart.

935
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,442
This whole rivalry jive shit? That's hot.

936
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,569
Ben, we may have to go soon.

937
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,616
Wh... look. I tell you what.

938
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,343
- What I have in mind...
- We ain't finished yet.

939
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,782
Maybe you need to ride up out of here.

940
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,646
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

941
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,055
Stop speaking for me. I ain't no puppet.

942
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,286
Too many different niggas around here,
trying to call shots.

943
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,090
I can speak for myself.

944
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:55,357
- You got beef with that?
- What's wrong with you?

945
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:56,830
Are you just trying to show off?

946
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,333
T'ain't for no show, man.

947
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,596
Some order need to be
restored around here.

948
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,899
Now, you either sit quiet
or ride the fuck out.

949
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,670
Is this about last night, Nate?

950
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:10,703
Whatever, man.

951
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:13,180
You know what? You're on your own.

952
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,819
And forget you, too, clown.

953
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:21,084
I like her.

954
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,182
So anyhow, this is what
I have in mind for you, my friend.

955
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,488
We got a lot of things to do
and a short time to do it in.

956
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,153
You with me? I need your eyes.

957
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,294
What's going on, little man?

958
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,955
Ain't gonna be no little man.

959
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,057
The name's C. Dub, out of Streets 1-5.

960
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,398
Born and raised in the MIA.

961
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,698
Gangsta for life.

962
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,541
What you know about being gangsta?

963
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:15,475
Man, what you know?
You about to get smoked by Razor Ric.

964
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:25,217
He's nothing like
the rest of his classmates.

965
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,119
He was always distant from everybody,

966
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:30,250
but I had no idea that he...

967
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,456
Mr. Harris, I have never,
in my 11 years of teaching,

968
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,691
- ever seen anything like...
- What did he do?

969
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,872
Man, come on!
Sign the autograph, nigga!

970
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,274
Ain't nobody want your autograph anyway,

971
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,608
you bitch-ass nigga!

972
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,868
...soft sounds of Soul 94.

973
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:16,336
In news today, local rapper Nemesis
was the subject of a scandal

974
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,432
when he apparently refused
to sign a local boy's autograph.

975
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:22,444
The rightfully-outraged
crowd demanded he sign,

976
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,707
at which point Nemesis pulled out a gun.

977
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,375
A riot ensued, and Nemesis
quickly slipped out

978
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,884
under the protection of his bodyguards.

979
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,647
It's a shame that, in this day and age,

980
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,553
celebrities think they can
get away with anything.

981
00:51:36,793 --> 00:51:38,317
Promise you, I'll tell you soon.

982
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:43,958
We'll know soon enough
where we're moving.

983
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,467
We will. Come on.

984
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,435
Lighten up.

985
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,005
It's not that.

986
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,836
Then what's wrong, chief?

987
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,672
If I could, I would have
fought back yesterday.

988
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,209
Nate, you're telling me
of all the places you can go,

989
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,683
if you can go back to anywhere in time,

990
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,755
you would go back to the day
that some bullies picked on you?

991
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:10,259
Yeah, and I would punch Billy Hubbard
right in his fat face.

992
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,055
Nate.

993
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:15,154
There was a reason you
didn't fight back yesterday.

994
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:16,994
A more important reason.

995
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,829
Like what?

996
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,835
Well...

997
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,838
I don't know.

998
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,400
Maybe you've got a supernatural power
that not even you know about.

999
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:32,039
Yeah, right. I'm a short, skinny wimp.

1000
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,175
The same was said of
Clark Kent and Peter Parker.

1001
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,775
But you know about them, don't you?

1002
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:41,022
- Yeah.
- One day, your power will be discovered.

1003
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,854
I'm sure it's in there.

1004
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,188
The day you find out,

1005
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:49,231
the whole world will be depending on you.

1006
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,163
Think about that.

1007
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:19,561
Man, this boy trippin'.

1008
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:22,154
He ain't coming, man. I told y'all that.

1009
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,242
Chronic. Smoke all you want.

1010
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:43,319
Smoke up, baby.

1011
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,012
Open the door, nigga.

1012
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,749
Yo, open the fucking door,
you green-ass nigga.

1013
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,552
That's my point exactly.

1014
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,888
Roll the fuck-up, Dough Dough, man.

1015
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,625
Gotta get back to the studio.

1016
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,099
- What up, Gunplay?
- What, you gonna put down another track?

1017
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,499
Something like that.

1018
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,798
Oh, I'm jumping on that.

1019
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,805
You say one song,
and I can get on with you.

1020
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,569
Pone, Pone, Pone. Take it easy, man.

1021
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:08,371
I told you I got you, right?

1022
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,241
I told you I'll let you know.

1023
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,542
It just don't work
like that all the time, man.

1024
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,742
How exactly do it work, then, man?

1025
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,217
You said, you know, I could
get on a track with you.

1026
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,812
You know. You won't let your boys
in the studio with you.

1027
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,755
Man, you the boss.
Hell what they talk about.

1028
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,656
So I'm saying. What you saying, Pone?

1029
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,353
I'm a puppet or something?

1030
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,626
Huh? They run me?
Is that what you saying?

1031
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:33,635
Man, all we trying to say is Nem
always let us get up in the studio.

1032
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,865
And he was going in,
man, we putting out some beats.

1033
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:38,372
Let Pone get a verse, you know.

1034
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,772
That's right.

1035
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:41,810
What I tell you about saying
his name around me, huh?

1036
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,105
- Chill out, man.
- What I say, Gunplay?

1037
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:44,237
I just saying.

1038
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,977
Man, this gonna be some good shit.

1039
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:52,578
Yo, man. Don't say that nigga name
in the same sentence as mine, all right?

1040
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:53,986
Where Nem at now?

1041
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,320
I don't seem him with
y'all punk-ass niggas.

1042
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:59,088
Huh? Where Nem at now?

1043
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:02,653
He hiding out in his fucking mansion
behind his bodyguards.

1044
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,997
Why? 'Cause he know next time
he bump into Hell Razor,

1045
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:07,626
death is certain, that's why.

1046
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,168
Why you gettin' so defensive, Razor Ric?

1047
00:55:11,274 --> 00:55:14,038
I mean, for somebody so in control,

1048
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,908
you sure getting a
little hot there, buddy.

1049
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:19,607
Yo, Pone. You got something
you need to say to me, man?

1050
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,707
You got something to get off your chest?

1051
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,548
Then fucking say it, then, nigga!

1052
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,417
You got something
you want to say to me, Pone?

1053
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:27,683
I ain't trying to say nothing.

1054
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:29,383
Maybe Nem ain't the
only poser around here.

1055
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,187
Oh, yeah? Fuck you.

1056
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,727
- God damn, nigga!
- Why you do that shit, nigga?

1057
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,992
Fuck that! I'm callin' the shots now!

1058
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,968
You get that?
I'm the head nigga in charge!

1059
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,663
Hell Razor!

1060
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,763
You a dead man walking, Pone.

1061
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,398
You're a dead man walking, man.

1062
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,334
You better have that
same fire in your pants

1063
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,277
the next time I catch you, homeboy.

1064
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:15,003
Take a look around, fellas.

1065
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:16,766
Niggas.

1066
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:19,398
Gangstas. Goons.

1067
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,636
Whatever the fuck
y'all want to be called.

1068
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,007
We soldiers over here. Y'all know this.

1069
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:31,315
Why? Because shit,
we done struggled together.

1070
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:35,084
Ever since I could remember, man,
we been running these streets.

1071
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,159
And we all been running 'em together.

1072
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:45,031
But a time come when
you look around, and...

1073
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,363
you don't quite know where you is.

1074
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:51,506
Maybe we're seeing things
through new eyes.

1075
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:56,602
Maybe... we been blind till now.

1076
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,874
We done witnessed
this whole Dade County

1077
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:01,450
305 thing at its birth.

1078
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,247
And if the right math ain't done,

1079
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,753
we gonna witness the death of it.

1080
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,283
They say...

1081
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,062
that this is the heart
of Dade, right here.

1082
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:18,765
And judging from the work
I done seen you all put in,

1083
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,802
I know that's true.

1084
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:23,634
But if that's so,

1085
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,574
then this also is the heart of darkness.

1086
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:31,078
Ain't no telling what's gonna go down
in the dark, man.

1087
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:32,614
Ain't no way of knowing.

1088
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,810
But I say

1089
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:40,151
that the darkness can rise

1090
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:44,556
when it get good
and goddamn ready to.

1091
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,993
It's been a naive light, so to speak,

1092
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:50,031
that done found us
way inside us, fellas.

1093
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:53,660
And we ain't even
notice it till right now.

1094
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,330
And we got to bury that light.

1095
00:57:56,439 --> 00:57:57,497
Within the dark.

1096
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,846
This motherfucking Razor Ric.

1097
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,713
This nigga from up north, man.

1098
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,281
They don't know what to do
with us Dade County boys.

1099
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:14,583
They don't know how to take us.

1100
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,955
We're not Northerners.

1101
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,824
We damn sure ain't Easterners.

1102
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,397
We Southern boys. Son of slaves.

1103
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,797
Migrated from Georgia, Mississippi,

1104
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:28,064
Alabama, Louisiana, Texas.

1105
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,139
We ain't no goddamn flodgers, man.

1106
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,141
And we damn sure ain't
no motherfucking Razor Rics.

1107
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,837
It's time to show the whole
motherfucking world

1108
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,640
what us Dade County boys be about.

1109
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,681
That's it. End of story. I say no more.

1110
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:41,943
- Hell, yeah!
- My nigga! Let's go!

1111
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,684
Why'd you come here
if you weren't gonna talk?

1112
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,667
It's getting ugly.

1113
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:01,836
But you knew that would happen going in.

1114
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,503
That's the mentality of it.

1115
00:59:06,609 --> 00:59:09,203
They think it. They spew it.

1116
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,247
And eventually, they act it out.

1117
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:19,311
You live by it, you die by it.

1118
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,390
I'm just playing the game.

1119
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:24,790
Yes, but... But you're
caught up in it now.

1120
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,454
You're in a bind.

1121
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,622
And that's for real.

1122
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,993
What was I supposed to do?

1123
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,659
What, sit neutral
my whole life and get what?

1124
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,862
You were raised differently.

1125
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,771
You see the world in different colors,
your own colors.

1126
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:44,507
You should have stayed in that world,
made a way out of it.

1127
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,941
That's a real man.

1128
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:51,884
Now you...

1129
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,478
you're living by their rules.

1130
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:57,526
You have to stand up for yourself
and mark your territory.

1131
00:59:57,627 --> 01:00:00,027
Can't believe what you said.

1132
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,892
Can't you see
that tonight was a wake-up call?

1133
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:10,495
You still have a chance
to climb out of it.

1134
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:15,806
But you... you're acting
like you're brainwashed,

1135
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,743
like a...

1136
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,675
like a soldier.

1137
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,082
You know, maybe I don't want to be
walked over my whole life.

1138
01:00:24,187 --> 01:00:28,123
Who got walked over?

1139
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,851
Who?

1140
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,826
You did, Pops.

1141
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,954
Look, I don't want to be you.

1142
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:37,396
Fucking peacenik.

1143
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,990
Who walked over me?

1144
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,468
Where are they now?

1145
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:44,165
Where are they now?

1146
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,309
I don't know you man

1147
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,144
I'll open up your top like a soda can

1148
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,877
Catch you with your girl in the park

1149
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:56,974
While you holdin' hands

1150
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:58,280
Hop up on the block

1151
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,855
With a sword like I'm Conan

1152
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:00,923
I'm the commissioner

1153
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:02,150
Chump, you a visitor

1154
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,589
When I pop the trunk

1155
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,524
I leave 'em broke like a christening

1156
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,688
And that's why you christeners hate

1157
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:25,205
Whoa, hey! Hold on!

1158
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,113
No!

1159
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,974
You want to go to your place?

1160
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,313
Go to your place.

1161
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:13,547
Back to my place?

1162
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:14,884
Yeah.

1163
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,356
Yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,426
Is that cool with you?

1165
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,926
It's fine.

1166
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:33,000
Some hot shit comin' out of the 305.

1167
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,304
That was the world premiere of
True Thing Boy Pone

1168
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:37,538
and his single, "Dane County Streets."

1169
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:38,614
Hot.

1170
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:40,511
Now speakin' of hot 305, boys,

1171
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,245
word just came in that Razor Ric is in
good condition and quickly recovering

1172
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:47,220
from a gunman's attack
earlier this morning.

1173
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:51,690
Look, it's all part of a plan.

1174
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:52,818
It's...

1175
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,658
What plan? Razor got shot.

1176
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:57,756
Yes, Pone was supposed to attack him,
but not shoot him.

1177
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,732
Razor is your meal ticket, guys.

1178
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,100
He needs to be shooting people,
not getting shot.

1179
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:03,832
It was intentional. Come on...

1180
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,168
Look, that's the only thing that...

1181
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,139
Exactly what we needed
to tip him overboard.

1182
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:08,642
Because I haven't heard him do shit yet.

1183
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,109
He's all talk, but hey,
I guess that's better

1184
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,681
than your other gangster rapper, Nemesis.

1185
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,875
Where's his retaliation song, guys?

1186
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,679
You can't even have him
fight back in words.

1187
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,515
We figured it would
be better for his image.

1188
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:19,849
- Hey, Stan?
- Yeah?

1189
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,014
- Shut the fuck up.
- No.

1190
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,057
She's setting him up
for a rape charge.

1191
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,786
That'll look real gangster.

1192
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:25,986
Raping a helpless white bitch...

1193
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:27,460
Go fuck yourself, Stan.

1194
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,190
I told you guys before to make a choice.

1195
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:30,856
You don't need this pussy Nemesis.

1196
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,059
He's just a pawn.

1197
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,500
Remember, guys, Tupac versus Biggie?

1198
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,401
When did they sell the most records?

1199
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,699
After death.

1200
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,037
Get rid of this Nemesis fucker.

1201
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:42,633
Razor is your star.
You want to create a rap war,

1202
01:04:42,745 --> 01:04:44,178
it better be for real.

1203
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,679
Be overt with these guys.

1204
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:46,873
Challenge their ego.

1205
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,541
and they'll pop anyone.

1206
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,928
He almost got himself killed.

1207
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,835
How the hell you gonna
let him walk around by himself?

1208
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,635
Man, he ain't...
You're supposed to be his manager.

1209
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,232
We give him to you for one day,

1210
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:15,537
and this is what happens?

1211
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:17,772
I thought you were supposed
to be a step up, guy.

1212
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,541
We've been cultivating
these kid for two years.

1213
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:21,344
And all the sudden,
this is what you're gonna do?

1214
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,712
It's nothing serious.

1215
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:24,308
It just grazed his left hip.

1216
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,287
He thinks it's nothing
serious getting shot.

1217
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:28,948
What the fuck are we gonna do now?

1218
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,355
It's time to mellow out.

1219
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,017
The media's gonna be all over him.

1220
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:33,652
Uh, he does have a point.

1221
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:35,731
The media is gonna be all over this.

1222
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,192
That's true. You know what?

1223
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,828
Get our lawyer.

1224
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,770
And tell 'em, um,
we're gonna press some charges.

1225
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,206
I could call Mike.
I'll tell him to bring a video here.

1226
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,538
He could record all this.

1227
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:50,168
And then we could send it
to Channel 7, all right?

1228
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,747
This is gonna be great. Oh, my God,
I didn't even think about that, man.

1229
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:53,940
This is gonna be really good.

1230
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,483
- Start taking some legal...
- No.

1231
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:57,643
No.

1232
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:03,915
Look at this.

1233
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:08,026
I'm holding court.

1234
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:13,432
Now take your ass and this conversation
in the next room, man.

1235
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,004
Sick of y'all yapping.

1236
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:18,539
I'm taking action.

1237
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,969
- Go ahead, get the fuck out, man.
- All right, Razor.

1238
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,616
I got your legal action right here.

1239
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,653
I'm the fucking judge.

1240
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,325
God damn, you're such a lightweight.

1241
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,766
A lightweight? I'm heavier than you are.

1242
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,963
Oh, please. It's 'cause
your head's getting big.

1243
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,869
My head, what about
the size of your head?

1244
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:53,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Watch it.

1245
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,039
See, your head's so damn big,
you're about to fall over.

1246
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,737
- I know exactly what I'm doing.
- My God.

1247
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:58,871
Look, this is my house.

1248
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,243
Right. Yeah.

1249
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,680
And you know what,
you need to do something

1250
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:02,876
about that Hennessey breath.

1251
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:04,247
- Hennessey breath?
- Yeah.

1252
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,978
- Let's get you cleaned up.
- What about your breath?

1253
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:07,851
- My breath is good.
- No, no.

1254
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,084
Fuck.

1255
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,127
Help! Somebody help!

1256
01:07:24,974 --> 01:07:26,703
Come on. Come on.

1257
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:29,107
Get inside. Get inside now.

1258
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,783
Hey, come here. Come here.

1259
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:46,519
How's that feel?

1260
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:49,097
It's all right.

1261
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,230
You're lucky they didn't
have weapons out there.

1262
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:54,063
They lucky they snuck up from behind.

1263
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:56,263
- Razor's a fucking coward.
- Please.

1264
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,806
Please what?

1265
01:07:58,908 --> 01:07:59,966
Look, I'm just saying.

1266
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,634
What, you got something to say?

1267
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,336
- I'm just saying...
- Get this off me, man.

1268
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,380
- I'm just saying...
- Look, you got something to say, say it.

1269
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,540
- You're acting like a gangster.
- I am a rapper.

1270
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,618
And what are you trying to prove?

1271
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,745
Nothing, all right? It's just...

1272
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,755
Well, Nem, who are you?

1273
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,654
I'm Nemesis, right?

1274
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,750
I'm Nemesis, and I'm about
to go fuck Razor up.

1275
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,260
Why would Razor go in disguise?

1276
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,886
And why would he have to?

1277
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,965
'Cause he know if I see him
what I'll do to him.

1278
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,328
Nem, come on, man.

1279
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,459
Come on, we both know
that you're not a fighter.

1280
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,867
Look, I've been fighting my whole life.

1281
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,269
Not your nor the doubters
gonna take that away from me.

1282
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,739
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- I'm trying to tell you something.

1283
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,038
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'm trying to tell you...

1284
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,477
- Get the fuck outta my house.
- I'm trying to tell you something.

1285
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,242
You know what, Snaps?
You get the fuck outta here, too.

1286
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:41,816
I'm not gonna leave you unprotected.

1287
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:43,976
This shit is over. Get the fuck out, man.

1288
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,678
Got damn it, would you listen to me?

1289
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,312
- I said listen.
- Everybody get the fuck out of my house.

1290
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:48,754
God damn it. I said listen!

1291
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:51,190
This shit is between me and Razor.

1292
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,292
Nate, open the door, man.

1293
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,228
Nate, open the door, man.

1294
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:32,357
Nate, open this door, man.

1295
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,405
Get down. Yeah, get down.

1296
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:46,667
Get down. Get on the fucking ground!

1297
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,744
Both of y'all.
Get on the fucking ground.

1298
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,177
Yeah, what's up now?

1299
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:53,270
Yeah, who's real now?

1300
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,543
Who's real now?

1301
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:56,675
What are you doing, Nate?

1302
01:10:57,753 --> 01:10:59,516
Oh, Nate, huh?

1303
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:02,523
You ain't my dawg.
You my nemesis, right?

1304
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,217
Turn the fuck over.

1305
01:11:04,326 --> 01:11:07,090
Yeah, I want to look right into your eyes
before I blow you away.

1306
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,333
Where you going?

1307
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,095
You hear that sound?

1308
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:15,636
Police coming.

1309
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:17,763
Nigga, I don't give a fuck about no cops.

1310
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,431
Tell 'em to come.

1311
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:21,975
I just want to watch you die slow.

1312
01:11:22,077 --> 01:11:23,510
What are you doing, Nate?

1313
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:24,943
It's what you wanted, right?

1314
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,379
You thought you had me.

1315
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,314
But don't nobody have me.
You can't touch me.

1316
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,716
I'm a fucking star.

1317
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:34,914
You about to be my first hit.

1318
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:36,651
But what it look like?

1319
01:11:36,759 --> 01:11:38,727
Why am I gonna feel
different when it's over?

1320
01:11:38,827 --> 01:11:39,816
Nate?

1321
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:42,328
They set me up to hate you, man.

1322
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:45,093
I bet it's just like
everything else, right?

1323
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,498
They set Pone up to hate me, dawg.

1324
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:51,061
We'll do it once,
and it just starts to flow from there.

1325
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,870
They set Pearl up to
charge you with rape, Nate.

1326
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,104
They're the liars here, Nate.

1327
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,406
Not you, man.

1328
01:11:58,514 --> 01:11:59,503
This ain't so hard.

1329
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:01,810
This is not how to
set this straight, man.

1330
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,681
Everything's about to be set straight.

1331
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,381
Tonight you become Nemesis,

1332
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,649
the people's enemy.

1333
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,019
Fight back.

1334
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,786
You want to know who I am?

1335
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:14,192
Who I really am?

1336
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,457
You want the truth, nigga?
This is the truth!

1337
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:19,558
Gangsta for life.

1338
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,863
You about to get smoked by Razor Ric.

1339
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,029
Gangsta for life.

1340
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,369
The more you hate them,
the more they love you.

1341
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:43,820
He's nothing like the rest
of his classmates.

1342
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:45,985
He was always distant from everybody,

1343
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,687
but I had no idea that he...

1344
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:50,993
Mr. Harris,

1345
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:53,330
I have never, in my 11 years of teaching,

1346
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,665
- ever seen anything like...
- What did he do?

1347
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,700
Your son's brilliance transcends him

1348
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,571
far and away from this classroom.

1349
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,578
Mr. Harris, children talk about being

1350
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,205
astronauts and firemen
when they grow up.

1351
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,808
Nate has created a hero,

1352
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:12,216
Nemesis...

1353
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:16,052
A loving and realistic portrait
of what he could be.

1354
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,059
Nemesis, a man oft
under-appreciated by

1355
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,753
the world around him,
but who in the end,

1356
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,526
has the power to heal
the souls of our society.

1357
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,260
Nemesis sees great potential

1358
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:28,598
in himself, in his surroundings,

1359
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:30,103
in this existence.

1360
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,503
And his true lyrics and drawings,

1361
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,133
they will bring out that inherent beauty.

1362
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:39,476
It is up to him to
instill that in others.

1363
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:51,309
What now, fellas?

1364
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,714
I'm glad you guys are here.

1365
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:58,843
I guess we have no business here.

1366
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,012
Here's the door, guys.

1367
01:16:00,122 --> 01:16:01,214
You guys can leave anytime you want.

1368
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:03,223
Hey, take it easy, tough guy.

1369
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,725
How you gonna kick somebody out
who's already gone?

1370
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:08,295
Our business here's done, anyway.

1371
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:09,887
Oh, is that right?

1372
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,260
That's right.

1373
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,462
That's funny 'cause I thought you guys
actually still had a contract with us.

1374
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,061
Oh, a contract.

1375
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,504
Yeah, you want to check it out? Go ahead.

1376
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:24,445
I think this needs to be reworked.

1377
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:26,138
Oh, look.

1378
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,909
Growing some balls, there, baby.

1379
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:30,143
- That's the way.
- Hey, shut up, man.

1380
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,617
Shut your mouth.

1381
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,587
Now, you got something
else you need to say, man?

1382
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:37,158
Ah, the problem is, guys,

1383
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,853
I wish you guys could
learn some common sense.

1384
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:43,523
See, you guys are talented artists.

1385
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:45,031
A whole lotta money to be made.

1386
01:16:45,133 --> 01:16:46,259
We could've made it together.

1387
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,427
I guess you guys gonna
have to make it for us.

1388
01:16:48,537 --> 01:16:50,664
You see, you guys can't just leave

1389
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,536
whenever your little
heart desires, you see?

1390
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,769
You're committed to us
for the next five years,

1391
01:16:55,877 --> 01:16:59,244
so whatever money you make,
you gotta give us 15%.

1392
01:16:59,348 --> 01:17:02,806
So please, be a nice little ho
and get us some money.

1393
01:17:02,918 --> 01:17:04,783
You know, you need to
start your own new label,

1394
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,717
Sellout Entertainment.

1395
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:09,222
How you gonna do your
brothas like that, anyway?

1396
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,292
I thought I was supposed
to be the house nigga.

1397
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:12,951
Oh, my brothas.

1398
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:14,653
So I'm supposed to keep it real, right?

1399
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,253
I'm supposed to keep it street?

1400
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,957
Razor Ric?

1401
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,363
Come on, man.

1402
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,995
When you guys ever gonna learn
what's really important?

1403
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,074
You been hanging around this cracker
way too long, man.

1404
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:27,732
Yeah, we outta here.

1405
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,504
Take a rain check.

1406
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,911
Well, you guys have a good day.

1407
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:34,107
Take care of the check.

1408
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,377
But remember this, fellas.

1409
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,783
Hip hop ain't black and white anymore.

1410
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,855
It's green.

1411
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:49,396
Yeah, it's D.J. Mecca, aka Grimore,
the host with the most from coast to coast.

1412
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,797
We at the reunion. Y'all about to see
a special performance right now.

1413
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,425
Two brothas that were together,

1414
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:57,130
that separated and were
at each other's throats.

1415
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,763
Now you about to see
the reunion go down.

1416
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:00,205
Dade County's finest,

1417
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,003
Nemesis, Razor Ric. Y'all stay tuned.

1418
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,045
It's coming up right now, baby.

1419
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:16,146
Hey, playa.

1420
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,123
Michelle, what are you doing here?

1421
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:19,352
You excited?

1422
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:20,758
Yeah, I'm excited.

1423
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:21,988
I mean, it's a small crowd,

1424
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,462
but you gotta start somewhere, right?

1425
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,430
Start from the ground
and build up.

1426
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,933
And I'ma do it right this time.

1427
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,003
- Slowly but surely.
- Yeah.

1428
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,298
You lightened up a lot.

1429
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,872
Yeah, I'm trying.

1430
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:33,531
Listen, I want you to sign on

1431
01:18:33,642 --> 01:18:35,166
as my manager again.
I'm sorry about what...

1432
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:37,768
Nate. Don't even go there.

1433
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,938
Besides, how can I
sign on as your manager,

1434
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,608
especially when I never left?

1435
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,278
- That's what I'm talk...
- Ain't this sweet?

1436
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:46,854
Let's go, man. It's show time.

1437
01:18:46,955 --> 01:18:48,081
Let's get up outta here.

1438
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,852
Razor, can you get outta here
while I talk to my client?

1439
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:52,586
Man, stop trippin'.

1440
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,493
Hey, so what was it you wanted again?

1441
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:08,571
Why you gotta throw that on me...

1442
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:10,269
Just go out there,

1443
01:19:10,378 --> 01:19:11,675
say what you mean,

1444
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:14,112
and do it like you mean it.

1445
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,616
Oh, wait. Lip gloss.

1446
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:18,845
- Okay, go get 'em.
- It's all gloss.

1447
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,424
Yeah, it's your boy Nemesis.

1448
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:35,002
This is motivational music, man.

1449
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,071
This for anybody that's
ever been through anything.

1450
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,697
Food for the soul, you understand?

1451
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:41,400
Hell Razor, where you at?

1452
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,307
I'm dealing with inspiration over here.

1453
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:45,436
305, stand up.

1454
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,606
Come on. Look. Listen.

1455
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,343
I gotta be me

1456
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,713
'Cause that's the only life I know

1457
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:51,843
But they don't really know me

1458
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,580
They just like my flow

1459
01:19:53,688 --> 01:19:55,519
They tryin' to change me
into something I'm not

1460
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,023
But I ain't tryin' to be a fake

1461
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,524
Just to get to the top

1462
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,118
Mad love for my pops
for showing me the way

1463
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:03,459
He's the reason I can
stand as a man today

1464
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:04,998
Yeah, I've been through it all

1465
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,294
Seen a lot of nonsense

1466
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,629
A lotta broken dreams

1467
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:09,135
A lotta empty promises

1468
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,432
Look to the sky,
I gotta keep my head high

1469
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,871
Shoot for the stars, if I miss

1470
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,271
Get another try

1471
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:16,674
All my life, I waited on the sideline

1472
01:20:16,778 --> 01:20:19,178
Learnin' the game,
tryin' to respect the guidelines

1473
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,374
A cold world, so many fake friends

1474
01:20:21,483 --> 01:20:24,179
Plottin' on your end
when the jealousy sets in

1475
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,277
But you can't
let it break you down

1476
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,720
Be yourself, don't let
nobody take you down

1477
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:32,453
Come on. Yeah.

1478
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:36,053
Just let me do my own thing, man.

1479
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,222
That's it.

1480
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:39,993
Now put your hands together.

1481
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:42,661
Hell Razor, where you at?

1482
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:43,931
Hell Razor, where you at?

1483
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,768
Hell Razor.

1484
01:20:45,874 --> 01:20:47,603
It's what we go through, man.

1485
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,301
Let's go.

1486
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,469
Everybody got a dream

1487
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:51,705
The problem is sellin' it

1488
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:53,007
We all got a story

1489
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:54,479
The problem is tellin' it

1490
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,608
The industry is a pool of sharks

1491
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,151
Hard to see, 'cause most of 'em

1492
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,618
Move in the dark

1493
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:01,655
But I can't sell my soul, hell no

1494
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,247
So, I stay on the grind,
rain, sleet, hail, snow

1495
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:07,089
Caught up in the grind,
get blinded by the bright lights

1496
01:21:07,195 --> 01:21:09,220
Man, every day,
it's like rollin' the dice

1497
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,629
I gotta buckle down
and take control of my life

1498
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,361
And recognize these snakes
before they even got to strike

1499
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:16,869
I'm here for the fight,
down for the cause

1500
01:21:16,972 --> 01:21:18,200
They ain't wanna let me in

1501
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:19,705
So I kicked down the door

1502
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:22,072
Music is life, I represent all of that

1503
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,270
Hip hop's the culture,
and yeah, I'm a part of that

1504
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:25,710
Love who you are

1505
01:21:25,814 --> 01:21:26,940
Don't ever let 'em change that

1506
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,208
Gotta stay true

1507
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,409
That's the way to get the game back

1508
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,418
Come on, man.

1509
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:36,888
I'm the one.

1510
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:40,621
Nemesis.

1511
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,253
Gotta feel me.

1512
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:46,559
Hell Razor.

1513
01:21:46,668 --> 01:21:49,000
It's what we go through, man.

1514
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,629
Come on, yeah.

1515
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:53,207
Let's try to talk to 'em, man.

1516
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:54,275
Put your hands together, man.

1517
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,276
This is feel-good music.

1518
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,209
For you and you.

1519
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,941
You over there.

1520
