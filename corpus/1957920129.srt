<i>Dear heavenly Father,
Jim Dangle is a good fella.</i>

00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:21,369
<i>Please look after him tonight.</i>

3
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,415
<i>Lord, please look after
the lieutenant tonight.</i>

4
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,765
<i>He's in a tough spot.</i>

5
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:30,465
<i>God, please,
when will I get my period?</i>

6
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:32,075
<i>Oh, and if you get a minute,</i>

7
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:33,618
<i>could you look after
my friend Jim Dangle?</i>

8
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:36,166
<i>He looks like
he's kind of losing it.</i>

9
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,348
Oh, Lord.

10
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:45,610
What a year!

11
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,395
I got weasel pox

12
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:50,876
and then I got
rebound weasel pox,

13
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:54,402
and then I bought
all that cryptocurrency

14
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,622
because of that excellent
commercial with Matt Damon.

15
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:00,538
And then I finally got that

16
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:02,888
Alanis Morissette tramp stamp
that I wanted,

17
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,934
and the guy spelled it...

18
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:08,894
so close, but not...
Not exactly right.

19
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh, hey, sir?

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,856
Please don't fuck my bicycle.

21
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:15,510
That's my bike

22
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,338
Hey, sir? Sir?

23
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,948
OK, guess what?

24
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,690
Joke's on you, that bike seat
has weasel pox on it.

25
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,692
Oh, Lord.

26
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:26,608
If there was ever
a Christmas angel out there,

27
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,044
I sure could use one tonight.

28
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,703

No, it's a Christmas angel.

It's Terry as a Christmas angel.

32
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:40,970
Yeah, that's my name.

33
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,165
- You got new skates.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,538
You put mistletoe on your...

35
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,061
On my gennies.

36
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,150
All the elves gather around,
and then they rub it

37
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,369
and then I make a candy cane

38
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:50,066

in their face.

the worst year ever.

43

never been born?

How can you say that?

45
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,774
I just did, with my mouth,
out into your face.

46
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,796
Lieutenant Dangle, do you
want to see what Reno would

00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,676
Merry Christmas,
you old dildo shop!

185
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:41,809
Merry Christmas,
Soup on a Stick!

186
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:44,855
Merry Christmas,
frozen dildo shop!

187
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,988
Merry Christmas,
Genital Decorators!

188
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:50,078
Merry Christmas,
paint-your-own dildo shop!

189
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:52,602
Merry Christmas,
Animal Butt Plugs!

190
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,349
Terry?

191
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,745
Were we supposed
to get going, Terry?

192
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,362
Anyway, your lives were great.

193
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,016
Good morning, gang.

194
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,496
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

195
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,256
Uh, this week's briefings
are brought to you

196
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,936
by Fugly Nubs, the app that gets

197
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:25,156
horrifyingly ugly
yet very usable parts

198
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,898
of chickens directly to you.

199
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,683
Wait, what?

200
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,922
The way you eat a chicken,
it's skinned, and the pieces...

201
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,426
I've never considered
them attractive.

202
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,794
Well, I'm sorry.
The fine print says,

203
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,167
uh, "Parts of chickens

204
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,134
that aren't even usable
in Mexican restaurants."

205
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,756
It sounds like this company
isn't selling you

206
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,433
parts that are unattractive,

207
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,802
they're selling you parts that
you normally would not eat.

208
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:45,568
Like a triple beak.

209
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,440
It's sort of like when you
buy a box of fabric remnants,

210
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,878
but this is, like,
all cysts and...

211
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,662
- And gizzards.
- And gizzards.

212
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,229
If you fry it real hard...

213
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:55,752
Yeah.

214
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,406
You... you... you don't even notice.

215
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,408
It's all coming out
the same hole, you know?

216
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:01,366
There... actually,
that is actually their new...

217
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:02,716
Uh, their new tagline.

218
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,413
"Fugly Nubs.
It's all coming out

219
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,849
the same hole.
What do you care?"

220
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,242
So...

221
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:09,679
Did everybody get
the script I wrote

222
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:13,117
for our new Junior Deputy
Pageant this year?

223
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,728
- Yes, we did.
- Yeah.

224
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,468
Do I get to be
the lead this year?

225
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,426
Read the script!

226
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:18,819
Are you playing Jesus again?

227
00:09:18,906 --> 00:09:20,429
Yes.

228
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,146
We didn't need to read it
to find that out.

229
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,085
Everybody, please be off-book.

230
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,758
We're going to rehearse
as much as we can.

231
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:27,654
You want us to memorize
this whole thing?

232
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,003
No, just your lines.

233
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,005
We all have
to remember her lines?

234
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,746
Damn, how long is this play?

235
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:33,964
We haven't timed it yet.

236
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:35,705
It's long.

237
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:38,012
But I mean, if you guys have
ideas for trims, obviously,

238
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,666
if you have ideas for trims...

239
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,382
I just skimmed it, and
I feel like the second half...

240
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,060
You didn't skim it.

241
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,472
Or the last three quarters
could go.

242
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:45,648
Everybody, please
read the script.

243
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:46,779
Cindy, did you read the script?

244
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:47,978
Mm-hmm!

245
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,086
- What did you think?
- Amazing.

246
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,241
Perfect.
Thank you.

247
00:09:50,328 --> 00:09:51,852
That's the only feedback I want.

248
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:54,071
Please sign your nudity
waivers, be ready to go.

249
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:57,248
I agree to and accept
all nudity in regards

250
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,816
to this production, because
I am a fan of the truth.

251
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,818
All right.

252
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:03,317
We're not allowed to do it this
year... you know how we did it

253
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,865
in the parking lot
last year, and then

254
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:05,779
we did it at the
fire station, and

255
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,432
the fire station is mad at us.

256
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,888
We don't... we don't
technically have a venue.

257
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,697
Smells there.

258
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,370
Jim, if we do have to do
it in the parking lot again,

259
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,893
can we scare away that
lady with the birds?

260
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,223
The scary lady
who has the birds?

261
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,659
Is the... are the birds with her?

262
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,269
Uh, I think
they're all together.

263
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,943
Yeah, she seems to be
able to control them.

264
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:21,838
That was last year's
Junior Deputy Pageant.

265
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,947
I was also thinking, who's the
scary guy with the big thing

266
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:24,991
that he was running around?

267
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,277
Oh, the big black wang.

268
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:28,192
Yeah.

269
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,106
Does everybody see
the extremely sad man

270
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,630
at the window?
Oh, my God.

271
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,077
Don't look, don't
look, don't look.

272
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,391
Uh, make believe
we don't see him.

273
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,479
I don't want to start working.

274
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:35,809
He looks so sad.

275
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,003
- He'll go away.
- It seems official.

276
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,027
It seems official.

277
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,290
No, no, Jimmy, come on!

278
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,727
It's our job.

279
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,293
Hey, I don't like
our job either.

280
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,252
Hi, can I... oh, dear.
Oh, dear.

281
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,427
Hi. Sir?

282
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,820
Are you OK?

283
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:47,559
No, come in, come in, come in.

284
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,560
Sir. Sir.

285
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,649
Sir.

286
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:50,867
Oh, my... wait.

287
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,477
Do I know you?
It is I.

288
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:53,914
Oh, my God! Are you...

289
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,350
Mr. Christopher Richnickie

290
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,980
from the Sierra Nugget Mall commercials.

291
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,875
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, your commercials!

292
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,834
♪ The mall that you love ♪

293
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,923

That's you!

297
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,887
Yep.

298
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:11,995
That used to be a great mall.

299
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,150
Thank you.

300
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,762
Uh, it's a great mall!

301
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:18,373
Someone has been
sending me ransom notes...

302
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,940
A lunatic.

303
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:22,682
He's trying to kidnap
my silver nugget

304
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,814
right from my mall.

305
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:26,618
They've been calling.
They have been sending notes.

306
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,383
They have been absolutely
terrorizing me,

307
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,863
and I don't know why.

308
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,691
I refinanced the whole mall
on that nugget.

309
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:32,996
If I lose that nugget,

310
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,606
I lose everything.
Gimme. Gimme.

311
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,280
I... I... I'm going to make one
of those string boards.

312
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:37,653
I'm on this. I got this.

313
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,915
Give me that.

314
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:40,612
So many terrible things
have happened.

315
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,155
We've had to make so many
cutbacks at the mall.

316
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,311
This is great.

317
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,182
This is great.

318
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,856
It looks like I'm going to be
playing Santa Claus this year...

319
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,968
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh.

320
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,230
This is the real thing.

321
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,927
They've got the cutouts,
the letters.

322
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:53,625
And every one of them says
Christopher Richnickie.

323
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,236
Do you know how long that takes?

324
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,455
And he cut out every
fucking letter of that name.

325
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,328
Mr. Richnickie, one
of the stupidest people

326
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,243
I've ever met
in my entire life...

327
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,592
He's talking about me.

328
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,507
Just had an incredible idea.

329
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:06,856
We're looking for a venue

330
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,510
to do our annual
Christmas pageant

331
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,381
for the little Junior Deputies.

332
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:13,907
If we could do it at
the Sierra Nugget Mall,

333
00:12:13,994 --> 00:12:17,606
we could be there in person
to protect your nugget

334
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,651
from these would-be bandits.
Yes.

335
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,579
But a pageant would bring
customers to my mall.

336
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,718
- It could.
- That would help me!

337
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,569
A wonderful pageant.

338
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,483
And also having you there
to protect the nugget...

339
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,920
That's right.

340
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,375
It's like sticking a wolf
right in the henhouse.

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,759
- Thank you!
- This is serendipity!

342
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,072
Thank you,
female Pee-wee Herman!

343
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,577
Yes.

344
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,405
Well, this is
a Christmas miracle!

345
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,538
You will give us a venue
for our pageant,

346
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,540
and we will do the thing that is

347
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:41,151
by definition our job,
which is protect your property.

348
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:42,674
This is magnificent.

349
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,676
And if all goes well,
we could pick anything

350
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,113
we want from the mall!

351
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
That's not allowed.

352
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:48,550
Going to be great. Thank you.

353
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:49,962
This has been
the worst year of my life.

354
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,074
Wow, you really keep...

355
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,249
- My wife has lupus.
- Yeah.

356
00:12:52,336 --> 00:12:53,773
OK, goodbye.

357
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,446
I actually feel like
this has been resolved,

358
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,664
and you could probably
leave now.

359
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:58,038
We... we... we haven't agreed...

360
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,388
She can't stand me,
and all I am is nice.

361
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,737
Oh.

362
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:03,217
Doctors can't even do that.

363
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,393
So if you're asking us
to kill her...

364
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,486
<i>Said you were going
to do it, now do it!</i>

365
00:13:11,573 --> 00:13:13,357
I just listen to this every day?

366
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:14,663
Every day.

367
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,032
A couple of times
a day if you can,

368
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:17,318
and while you go to sleep.

369
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:19,102
Let it get in there subliminally.

370
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:22,062
And that is how
you live your best life.

371
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,628
I can Venmo you.

372
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,650
I'm going to give it to you
as an act of generosity.

373
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,807
- You're the best.
- Oh, I know who this is.

374
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,199
Sheriff's Department!

375
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:32,333
Um, there's nobody in this box.

376
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,204
- Hi, Jackie.
- Jackie!

377
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,597
Jackie's not here.

378
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,773
Please... please leave
a message at the tone.

379
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,427
OK, hang on one second.

380
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,604
Telephone call for Jackie,
the transient who's nesting

381
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,649
in the book deposit box.
Hello?

382
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,086
- Jackie?
- Yes?

383
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:47,541
Hi, it's Jim from
the Sheriff's Department.

384
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,045
Oh, hi.
Why didn't you just say so?

385
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,307
Ni... happy Christmas

386
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:51,874
and nice for you
to see me again.

387
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,006
Hi, Jackie.

388
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,398
Can you come out and talk to us

389
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,357
about some business
opportunities?

390
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,204
The yearbook photo of Jackie,
that's actually it.

391
00:13:58,228 --> 00:13:59,926
- Right in...
- Oh, hey, guys.

392
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,144
How's it going?

393
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,798
Have you ever been
to Marseilles?

394
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,732
I'm going to put it
all on blue and let it ride.

395
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:07,324
One time I was in Marseilles,
and, uh...

396
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:08,935
The tide...
When the tide goes out...

397
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,937
- Oh, shit!
- It smells like this?

398
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,697
- That's it. That's exactly it.
- Oh, my God.

399
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,960
But you've got to be there
at low tide in, like, August...

400
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,116
Late August, September.

401
00:14:16,203 --> 00:14:17,378
Marseilles.

402
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,032
Jackie, we're pulling you
on five.

403
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,183
- We're pulling you out.
- On the count of four.

404
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,599
- One...
- Five. Go!

405
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:22,731
- Two... God!
- Oh, shit.

406
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:23,950
Oh, shit.
I got it.

407
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,038
I got it.
OK, I'm good.

408
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,735
Got her. Got her. Got her.

409
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:28,606
Did everybody know
that it was me?

410
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:29,738
Surprise!

411
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,044
We all knew it was you.

412
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,349
Oh, Clemmy.

413
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,742
Yes.

414
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,570
She... she says
it's a Christmas miracle.

415
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:37,180
I just wanted
to see my friend Jackie

416
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,834
because she's my inspiration,

417
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,402
both sociology-wise
and spiritually.

418
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:42,838
Yeah.

419
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,536
Not to mention,
look at the fashion.

420
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,147
Oh, shit.

421
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:49,845
She was Miss Nevada
a long time ago.

422
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,891
There's possum shit in my boots.

423
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,980
You want to tell us
about this little, uh,

424
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,938
business you've started
over here?

425
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,289
Oh, I'm not pulling books
out of this for sale, for sure.

426
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,769
These are for charity.

427
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:03,859
Two for 10, five for 4,
16 for 22.

428
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,774
52 for three wallet-sized.

429
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,341
- OK.
- You're just doing work...

430
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,995
But you can't get your inventory

431
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:10,866
from the Reno Public Library.

432
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,520
These are all library books.

433
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:13,932
We know that's what you
did 'cause it says that.

434
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:14,870
How much is this one?

435
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,306
Oh, this one is so...

436
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:17,457
Don't put... don't go
for my penis, please.

437
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:18,656
This one is very...

438
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,807
You were leaning
right towards my...

439
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:20,963
What?
I wasn't trying to.

440
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,182
- Yeah, you were.
- Listen.

441
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:23,749
There's no free blowjobs
on Christmas!

442
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,272
Do you want me to...

443
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,186
I'm going to cuff you
for your own protection, OK?

444
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:28,579
Just casually, casually.
Oh, look at this!

445
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,861
She's being so lovely.
Here's the problem.

446
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:30,712
But don't... don't... Jackie!

447
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,279
Deedle-eedle-eedle-ee.

448
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:33,149
Jackie, I just
don't want to see...

449
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,237
Jackie.

450
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:35,345
Look at all these dollars.

451
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:36,369
Surprise.

452
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,285
You cannot just creep up

453
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,852
on a lady at Christmas time...

454
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,960
Put that under
your vagina, please.

455
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,159
And expect... oh, no.

456
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,726
Is something crawling out?
No.

457
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:45,640
You stay in there.

458
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,598
You'll be safe.

459
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,122
Are you talking to your snatch?

460
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,340
Mm-hmm.

461
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:51,515
Have you met her?

462
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,995
She's not friendly.

463
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,867
We could either get her
in the vehicle.

464
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,521
Mm-hmm.

465
00:15:57,608 --> 00:16:00,133
Or if we get her
all the way into the box,

466
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,005
then she's
the library's problem.

467
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,678
Let's get her in the vehicle.
This is gross.

468
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:05,984
They're going to get mad.
Let's get her in the vehicle.

469
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,488
Why don't you come
to the car with me?

470
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:09,272
I have pickles.
That's fine. I'll do that.

471
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,143
I'm allowing you to hold this.

472
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,406
I'm allowing you to hold this!

473
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,493
Stop it. Stop it.

474
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:14,843
- All of this!
- Oh, fuck!

475
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,584
Oh, look.
This is my Christmas dress.

476
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,351
Is that your... oh,
that is very Christmassy.

477
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:20,607
I can't see in my right eye,
but it's...

478
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:21,763
I think it's fine.

479
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,286
Santa is going
to stuff you right

480
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,157
in this little thing here.
Santa's gonna stuff me?

481
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,462
- Yeah. You're good.
- Yeah.

482
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,681
Don't... stop.

483
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:27,638
I've been dreaming about this.

484
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:28,944
Stop it.

485
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,685
I've been dreaming about this!

486
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,468
Santa, stuff it!

487
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:32,817
Here.

488
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,690
Oh, Santa, Santa.

489
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:38,910
Oh, what child is this?

490
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,478
And God bless us, every one.

491
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,785
Record time getting her
into the thing.

492
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,352
Don't you think?

493
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,894
- Because we listened...
- Because we listened!

494
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,374
- To affirmations.
- The affirmations!

495
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:49,530
- Yeah.
- I think it helped.

496
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,194
Still there.

497
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:04,762
So Dangle has us patrolling
the mall in shifts

498
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,243
to, um, keep an eye
on the nugget,

499
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,376
to make sure that
nobody steals it.

500
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,987
I think Mr. Richnickie is just
being a little bit paranoid,

501
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,381
and, quite frankly,
a little bit dramatic,

502
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,470
about someone wanting
to steal the silver nugget.

503
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:19,951
I mean, it's like, why would
anybody want this thing?

504
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,606
Right?
What is it made of, cake?

505
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,652
Actually, has anybody checked?

506
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,742
Because they are making
some pretty weird shit

507
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,136
out of cake lately.

508
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,052
If you want something stolen,

509
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,097
put it in a display like this.

510
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:36,509
If you put it...
You're begging for it.

511
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:38,535
You're begging for it.
I would steal this.

512
00:17:38,622 --> 00:17:39,797
I would steal this

513
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,669
and I would sell it
in my Etsy shop

514
00:17:41,756 --> 00:17:44,976
for $25,000 plus shipping,
calling it a meteor.

515
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,674
And someone would buy it.

516
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:47,631
You're right.

517
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,155
Oh, no!

518
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,634
- Whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey!

519
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,549
Oh! Oh!

520
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,682
First my wife
has lupus, now this?

521
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:56,640
Wait, that's what
you called us here for?

522
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,033
No!

523
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,340
Someone put
a live adult male chimp

524
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:02,603
inside of my Santa sack!

525
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,083
You put a... whoa!

526
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,826
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

527
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,045
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

528
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:11,438
Get back! Get back!

529
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,719
Stay away from my nugget,
you dirty monkey!

530
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,310
Where'd he go?

531
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,359
Hey, hey, hey. This is Jones.

532
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,143
Uh, I'm at
the Sierra Nugget Mall.

533
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,425
I need backup.
We've been chimp-sacked.

534
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:23,798
<i>- Chimp-sacked, copy.</i>
- What?

535
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,297
Explain to them what happened.
Where'd he go?

536
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,385
- I don't know.
- What happened?

537
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:27,715
- We lost him.
- We lost him.

538
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,065
- Excuse us.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

539
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,458
- Watch it.
- Jim!

540
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:32,894
- Excuse me.
- Jim, right here!

541
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:34,025
- Careful.
- What's up?

542
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,193
We're getting chimp-sacked?

543
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:36,550
Yeah, we got chimp-sacked.

544
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,005
How do you know this term,
chimp-sacked?

545
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,466
We got an adult male chimpanzee

546
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,660
in a sack or a satchel,
some kind of bag.

547
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:41,729
Chimp-sack.

548
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,056
What's there to not understand?

549
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,035
It's a chimp in a sack, right?

550
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,211
No, I get that, but...

551
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,560
- Like jaguar-luggaged.
- What?

552
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:47,517
That I don't know.

553
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:48,684
That's not a thing, either.

554
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,960
Why are we all being so loud?

555
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,875
Why are we being so loud?

556
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,660
Poke him with that stick.

557
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:01,427
Maybe make other chimp noises
or something?

558
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,058
- No, no, no.
- Bad idea.

559
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,546
I think he's very close
to falling...

560
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,324
♪ Asleep ♪

561
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:15,893
Both: ♪ Little chimpanzee ♪

562
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,523
Guys, guys.
He's fall... he's fallen over.

563
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:19,114
He's asleep.
He's asleep.

564
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,463
Oh, crack his little skull.

565
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,378
Oh, give him
a little skull crack.

566
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,075
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

567
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,688
What are you doing?
Why did you shoot the elf?

568
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,994
Fuck you!

569
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,387
Jim!

570
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:33,172
No! No!

571
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,782
Look away!
Look away from this!

572
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,175
Oh, my God!

573
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,959
Do something!

574
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:39,395
I gotta... Jim!

575
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:42,311
Help me!

576
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,487
You son of a bitch!

577
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:46,335
I just want to remind you
that you shot my friend!

578
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,274
- My God!
- You shot Keith the Elf!

579
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,884
Oh, my God, you killed him!

580
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,383
No, no, no, no, no.
No, you didn't kill him.

581
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,148
One tranquilizer dart

582
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,803
is equal to three Quaaludes, OK?

583
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,760
Are we talking about
getting some Quaaludes?

584
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,371
Is that what we're
talking about?

585
00:19:58,458 --> 00:19:59,913
Well, I'm just saying
a tranquilizer dart is...

586
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:01,480
- Please don't fuck me.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

587
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:02,244
- What?
- What did he say?

588
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:03,941
Please don't fuck me.

589
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:05,745
The last time Keith
got knocked out at work,

590
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:07,356
a whole bunch of people
tried to fuck him.

591
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,792
So I think that might be
the concern right now.

592
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,078
Please don't fuck me.

593
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:11,384
That is definitely the concern!

594
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:12,871
Nobody's got eyes
on our chimp sack?

595
00:20:14,343 --> 00:20:15,866
Get it in!

596
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,521
Follow it.
Follow it.

597
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:20,958
Trap it in. Trap it in.
Get in there!

598
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,351
Don't you my Keith.

599
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,874
Nobody wants any parts of that.

600
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,069
You know, it's like
that thing where you say,

601
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,529
don't think of elephants.

602
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,216
Now everyone's thinking
of fucking Keith.

603
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,576
Don't fuck Keith!

604
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,634
<i>Does everyone remember
the oath that HR made us take?</i>

605
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:47,507
And I won't show my wiener
to anybody.

606
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,335
I will not show
my wiener to anybody.

607
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,597
No such thing as a penis oath.

608
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:52,076
- What are we doing?
- Oh.

609
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,402
Oh, we were just taking
an oath that we wouldn't

610
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,775
show people our wieners.

611
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:55,906
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:57,952
Well, we had a situation
with a...

613
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,059
Yeah, there's a chimpanzee
running through the mall.

614
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,389
Chimpanzee.

615
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,956
It got into the Santa sack
and, uh,

616
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,349
we don't know where it is.

617
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:04,456
It's all part
of a terrible ransom.

618
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,786
You're being chimp-sacked?

619
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,701
- Not a thing.
- The adult male chimpanzee

620
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:10,007
has nine times the grip
of that of a male adult.

621
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:12,967
The secret is,
you have to be a chimp

622
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,577
of a higher status.

623
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:16,187
It's a status game, mates.

624
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,406
Watch and learn.

625
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,278
He's over here, behind the...

626
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,801
He knows what he's doing.

627
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:21,758
This is good.

628
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,673
All right, this is no good.

629
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
You need, like, a moose
or something.

630
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,400
A reindeer is not big enough.

631
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:27,851
- OK.
- Not big enough.

632
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,505
- Bigger chimp.
- Bigger chimp.

633
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:30,912
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Status game.

634
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:32,465
- Oh, yes. Yeah, OK.
- Come on.

635
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:34,031
Come on, chimpie.
OK, OK.

636
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,861
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

637
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,308
That sounds... that sounds bad.
Oh!

638
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,128
Oh, he's OK!

639
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,217
He's got a bit
of fight in him, that one.

640
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,610
All right, different tactic.

641
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:48,935
I want him to think
that I'm a female.

642
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,047
You, you.

643
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,353
I need some musk.

644
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,703
This way... this way...
OK.

645
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,333
- He'll think that I'm a woman.
- That works.

646
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,402
That works.
Not enough.

647
00:21:56,489 --> 00:21:57,577
Not enough.
Oh!

648
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,013
You want some? Oh.

649
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,883
- OK.
- Hey.

650
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,668
Oh.

651
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:02,862
- Guys, it's totally standard.
- That'll do it.

652
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,081
He'll like that.
He'll like that.

653
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,193
OK, good.
You're welcome.

654
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,108
Maybe.
Santa, come here.

655
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,588
You smell like a woman.

656
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:10,198
It's funny,
because usually when a man

657
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,983
sticks his arm up my crotch,
I get his name first.

658
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,942
Now it's time
for the tender trap.

659
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,029
OK.

660
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,597
Godspeed.

661
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,120
Oh, you go... you go, girl.

662
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:24,517
Not in there!

663
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:25,866
Put him down.

664
00:22:25,953 --> 00:22:27,393
- Is your foot in it?
- Leave it, no!

665
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,782
No!

666
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:29,869
Ahh!

667
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:30,913
Oh, oh.

668
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:32,438
He's in...

669
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,395
- Ahh!
- Oh, he's alive.

670
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:34,527
- Oh.
- He's alive.

671
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:35,528
I got him.

672
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,094
I choked him out.

673
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,357
You choked him out.

674
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:39,836
Oh.

675
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:42,230
He's not going
to bother you anymore.

676
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:43,492
He's a nice fella.

677
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:45,233
Just needed a bit of love.
Oh.

678
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,539
Thank you, brave sir.

679
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,192
- You're a hero.
- Brave sir.

680
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:49,411
Oh, thank you so much.

681
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,413
Your items.
Ah, wow. Wow.

682
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,197
Uh, let's... is this dumb?

683
00:22:53,284 --> 00:22:55,635
Can get a... can we get
a snap with the squad?

684
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:57,419
Oh, yeah.
That's a great idea.

685
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,160
Come on, come on.

686
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:00,857
That's great. Whoops.

687
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,544
Can everybody go, "whoops"?
That's great.

688
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,298
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh!

689
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,299
Oh, you got him, Jim!

690
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,084
I'm OK!

691
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,653
It's a Christmas miracle!

692
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,784
Let's get the photo.

693
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:16,177
Season's greetings!

694
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:19,180
Season's greetings.

695
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,269
<i>Only three days left
to Christmas.</i>

696
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:22,966
<i>Bargains are abound.</i>

697
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,273
Does anybody want
an Ice N Tasty?

698
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,840
No, I need one to put on...

699
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,121
To ice my tasties.
Morning, officers.

700
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:29,669
Morning, morning.

701
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:30,409
- Well, hello there.
- Good morning.

702
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:31,801
Thank you for your service.

703
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,542
We saw what you got up to
this morning.

704
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,414
Oh, yeah. We got, uh... uh...

705
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,632
Chimp... you got chimp-sacked.

706
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,159
- We got chimp-sacked.
- We sure did.

707
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,766
My name is Gunner.

708
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:41,550
And my name
is Ronnie Donald Ceviche.

709
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:42,812
And I am Hold 'Em.

710
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:44,335
And I am Fold 'Em.

711
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,772
Yeah.
We are the current stewards

712
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:49,079
of the Kenny Rogers' Life
Exhibit.

713
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:52,126
Is this some kind of
traveling Kenny Rogers museum?

714
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,041
Some kind?

715
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:57,653
This is <i>the</i> traveling
Kenny Rogers museum.

716
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,002
We're talking too much.

717
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:00,569
It's almost time
to start our show.

718
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,876
- Oh, oh, oh!
- And...

719
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,446
Born 21 August, 1938,
Kenneth Donald Rogers,

720
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,491
known to his family
as Kenneth Ray,

721
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:12,015
went on to be nominated
19 times for a Grammy

722
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:15,889
and sold over
121 million records worldwide.

723
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,631
This is the exact size Kenny was

724
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,371
when he was this size.

725
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,243
- Child-size Kenny.
- It looks just like him.

726
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,027
It looks just like him.

727
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,421
And he grew up in poverty,
surrounded by rats.

728
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,075
No. That's not a rat, sir.

729
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:30,817
That is a nine-banded
Texas armadillo.

730
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,035
The Texas tank.

731
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,472
Well, this was amazing.

732
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,719
I wish there was more to see.

733
00:24:34,777 --> 00:24:36,083
Oh... oh, there is more!

734
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,519
Oh, wow.

735
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:40,043
Oh, whoa!
Whoa!

736
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,394
Kenny Rogers stood
at least 6 feet tall.

737
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,788
Rumor is, he never
looked down on any man,

738
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,834
but every man looked up to him.

739
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,357
Look, look.

740
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,533
I'm big enough that
if you skinned me,

741
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,926
Kenny Rogers could wear me.

742
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,144
Your brain works weird.

743
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,276
I like it.

744
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:02,588
This has all of Kenny's songs
in Japanese?

745
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:04,067
Yep. All of them.

746
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,242
Why?

747
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:15,296
- Is this a suit that he wore?
- Well, this...

748
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,926
Just like everything
you're about to see...

749
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,561
Is something that Kenny
actually wore himself

750
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:22,999
or is a pretty accurate
just this side of replica.

751
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:25,741
This is a replica
that Kenny would have worn,

752
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:28,178
had Kenny worn a replica
like this one.

753
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,026
- It would have been this one.
- That's right.

754
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,596
Kenny grew up really poor.

755
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:57,556
He couldn't afford a kitty,
so he had a baby goat.

756
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,949
They nicknamed him Smitty.

757
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:01,560
This goat feels
like hard plastic.

758
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,257
Is that what that is?
It is.

759
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:05,017
That's what that is.
This is not even a real goat?

760
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,541
I mean, it's a goat in there,
but we lacquered it.

761
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,890
And then after a while it
started to delaminate, so...

762
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:09,306
Magnificent.

763
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,980
Also just a test of,
could we laminate a goat?

764
00:26:11,004 --> 00:26:12,309
Yeah.

765
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,007
Well, you never know
until you try.

766
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,011
OK.

767
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:19,142
Hi.

768
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:20,274
I don't see anybody.

769
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,492
Let's do this quick.

770
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,451
- OK.
- Ready?

771
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:26,062
Both: One, two, three.

772
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,415
All right.
So the plan is, we call...

773
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:32,895
We call animal control.
Right.

774
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:33,896
And they come
pick this thing up.

775
00:26:33,983 --> 00:26:34,810
- Yeah.
- Right?

776
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:36,246
Yeah.

777
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,813
And it has a very
happy life somewhere

778
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:39,051
in some... in something that
looks like

779
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,511
a Tarzan set, right?

780
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,533
Or... or we leave it here,
and it just can run free.

781
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:43,621
That's right.
You know, it's like a jungle.

782
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,907
It's like a concrete jungle.

783
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,493
We're releasing the monkey
in the concrete...

784
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,084
- Hello?
- Hello?

785
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,346
Hello?

786
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,783
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

787
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,132
Oh, my...

788
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,568
- Hey!
- Keith!

789
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,004
- Hey, man.
- Where am I?

790
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,286
What are you doing in that sack?

791
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,790
What am I doing in that sack?

792
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:58,897
We got... what's he doing here?

793
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,531
Did you guys tranq me?

794
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,577
Wait, if you're here, then...

795
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,710
Who'd we drop at the strip club?

796
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,907
You can take me
to the strip club.

797
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,063
No, no, no.
You stay here.

798
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,064
We should go.
We'll check it out.

799
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,021
- Yeah.
- We should go.

800
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:13,283
I got to go home!

801
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,720
I know my wife's worried sick!

802
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:15,982
She's bigger than me!

803
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,944
Is this what I think this is?

804
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:25,905
If you think this
is Kenny Rogers' bones,

805
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,776
it absolutely is.

806
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,386
Please no flash photography.

807
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,758
I can only keep it open
in little spurts,

808
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:34,827
much like a Caravaggio.

809
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,655
Three, two, one.

810
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:38,047
Oh, whoa.

811
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:41,529
We just saw Kenny Rogers' bones.

812
00:27:41,616 --> 00:27:43,096
- That is possible, yes.
- Yes.

813
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:44,358
Can I... should we all switch?

814
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:45,685
I would love to see the bottom.

815
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,665
Oh, yeah, please see the bottom.

816
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:50,581
Kenny Rogers' bones.

817
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,062
Please no flash photography.

818
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,237
This side is even better.

819
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,630
The bottom side is incredible.

820
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,024
His voice resonated
inside that skull.

821
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:00,113
There's still cards in his hand.

822
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,897
- Wow.
- Yeah.

823
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:04,049
The kind of cards Kenny Rogers
would have held in his hands,

824
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,466
had he died lying down.

825
00:28:05,553 --> 00:28:07,207
Amazing.

826
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:09,339
I will say, having
just seen his wingspan,

827
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:11,820
this is the full-size Kenny?

828
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,972
We should admit that we do
have the same parent company

829
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,519
as the Body World show.
Oh.

830
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,260
- Remember that?
- OK.

831
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:18,716
Was that, like, the muscle
dudes that played volleyball?

832
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,959
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

833
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:21,501
So there is some
cross-pollination where,

834
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,851
you know, well,
we share a warehouse.

835
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,267
Sure, of course.

836
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,592
Let's not tug
each other's nuts right here.

837
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,053
They may not be
Kenny Rogers' bones,

838
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,924
but they remain bones,
mostly human bones.

839
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,534
Let's not tug our own nuts.

840
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,362
No.

841
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,974
Let's not allow anyone
walking by to get a nut tug.

842
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,802
Bones.
Human bones.

843
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,214
- Kenny Rogers had them.
- In the shape...

844
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:39,935
In the shape of Kenny Rogers.

845
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:41,217
You know what?
I'd kind of like to see

846
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:42,392
the top half again,
would that be OK?

847
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,200
Oh, yeah. Please.
Please take your time.

848
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,507
You said pièce de résistance
two or three times.

849
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,117
Yeah.

850
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,903
This is clearly
the pièce de résistance.

851
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,643
This has been wonderful.

852
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,360
We'll just come by anytime,
and you guys can show these?

853
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,362
Any time you got $38,
you can come right on by here.

854
00:28:56,386 --> 00:28:57,692
- Again.
- Wow.

4:00 a.m. this morning,

886
00:30:07,588 --> 00:30:09,416
and it has been my privilege
to introduce

887
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:13,724
the Reno Sheriff's Department
to actual police procedure.

888
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,858
Now, I have asked Jones
and Cindy to join me today.

889
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:20,862
Mr. Richnickie
of the Sierra Nugget Mall has

890
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:22,492
had some threatening letters
sent to him

891
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,474
saying they're going
to steal his silver nugget.

892
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:28,870
So I have started
what we call a string board.

893
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:31,046
This is how all great crime
is solved.

894
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:34,223
What we're going to do
is find possible connections

895
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,704
to the potential theft
of the silver nugget,

896
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,924
so if it gets stolen,

897
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,882
and if we figure out
who stole it,

898
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,189
perhaps we connect
it to something

899
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:44,712
that fucking matters.

900
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,019
We got OJ.

901
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,426
I don't want to
get into it again.

902
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,631
Who did this? What's this?

903
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:53,286
That's a coconut nut cluster
wrapper I put up there.

904
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:54,417
That... maybe a wrapper...

905
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,592
What's the connection?

906
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,378
Maybe... maybe a wrapper did it.

907
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:00,771
You're just saying what
you think I want to hear.

908
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,685
- Hi.
- Hey.

909
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:02,904
- Hey, Riz.
- Hey.

910
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:04,427
What's up?
Sorry I'm late.

911
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,777
Oh, you here to work on it?

912
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,257
You just told me
to show up here.

913
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:09,737
You know who could be guilty?

914
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,434
Oh, good. Yes. Who?

915
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:14,481
In Reno, almost...

916
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:15,961
everyone.

917
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:18,050
All right. No.

918
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:22,358
- Oh, no.
- Oh, Lord.

919
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,186
- Merry Christmas!
- Yep. It's Big Mike.

920
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:25,753
Is he huffing on them fumes?

921
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,668
Sheriff's Department, Mike.

922
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:28,408
He's got a flocker.
He's got a flocker.

923
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,018
Got a flocker.

924
00:31:30,105 --> 00:31:31,541
Mike, put that
flocking gun down.

925
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:34,936
Whoa! Mike! Hey!

926
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,546
Whoa! Hey! Hey!

927
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,113
Hey. Stop it!

928
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,520
Don't... have you
been huffing that?

929
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:40,744
- Everyone is so...
- You can't...

930
00:31:40,768 --> 00:31:41,963
Mike, don't huff that.
Don't huff that.

931
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,858
Mike, that's bad
for your health.

932
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:47,775
I'm a monster!

933
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,950
Right.
Mike, stop it.

934
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:50,386
- Mike, stop.
- Mike, stop it!

935
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,040
Stop it! Stop it!

936
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,713
- What is that stuff?
- Hey, I'll flock you...

937
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:54,782
I'll flock you up.

938
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:55,739
I'm fucking... do it.

939
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:57,132
Give me... give me one.

940
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,221
Give him the snowball.

941
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,744
Here you go.
Hey!

942
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:04,183
Guess what kind of call
we got on the telephone.

943
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,706
Man partying in a parking lot?

944
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:06,794
- No.
- No.

945
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:08,491
Man having a sale?

946
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:11,712
Man selling
flocked Halloween ornaments

947
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,453
at discount price?

948
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,629
This is definitely all
the stuff that got stolen

949
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,413
from the Halloween stuff.
Oh, yeah, 100%.

950
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,546
I recognize that spider
'cause I wanted it,

951
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,306
and it was $64.
Well, how much is it now?

952
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,549
Hey, Mike?

953
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:23,743
Mike, how much is the spider?

954
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,422
21.99 for the spider.

955
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:27,554
Really?

956
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:28,947
For the whole spider?

957
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,687
Think up on top
of your Christmas tree.

958
00:32:30,774 --> 00:32:32,254
That sounds like
a pretty good idea.

959
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:34,474
21.99 for me.

960
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:35,755
Mike, what happened
to that vehicle over there?

961
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,607
That's my race car.

962
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,174
- Is that your vehicle?
- Yes.

963
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,175
And the paperwork would be in it

964
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:41,568
that would show
that this belongs

965
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:43,265
to Big Mike, and not Brenda?

966
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:45,050
Wait a minute.
Did Brenda help you

967
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,790
steal everything
from the Halloween stuff,

968
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:48,270
and... stop it, Mike! Mike.

969
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:49,228
Mike. Mike. Mike.

970
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:50,533
Stop it.

971
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,274
Is Brenda dead in the trunk?

972
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:55,886
Brenda was called
to serve the Lord.

973
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,324
That's why she moved
to Hot Springs, Arkansas.

974
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,823
To serve the Lord.
- She was not with you

975
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,247
when you robbed
the Halloween store?

976
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:03,590
No! Absolutely not!

977
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,896
I've met Brenda,
and she's a godless troll.

978
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,202
Well, that's what happened.

979
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:08,310
See, those make
the best preachers.

980
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,640
The ones that
start out as whores

981
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:12,860
and drug dealers and pedophiles

982
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:15,471
and ass-rapers and dick smokers,

983
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:16,820
and then they go,

984
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,300
I'm dub... done with my dicks.

985
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,694
I'm going up there for the Lord.

986
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:22,130
And she has a kennel...

987
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,499
I'm going to need
to check that vehicle.

988
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,220
She has... no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

989
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:26,667
You don't got to check
that kennel.

990
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,807
I'm happy for her, actually.

991
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,617
She's doing so well.

992
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:34,577
Well.

993
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,014
Found her.

994
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,101
Yeah, Brenda's in there.

995
00:33:37,145 --> 00:33:38,407
- Let's go, Mike.
- All right.

996
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:39,669
Good Lord.

997
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:41,236
I'm going to throw up
real quick.

998
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:42,063
Do you think we
have time to stop

999
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,586
by the Thanksgiving store?

1000
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:44,718
Absolutely.

1001
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:50,245
OK.

1002
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:51,942
We've been here
for about nine hours

1003
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,207
working on the string board,
and we are making progress.

1004
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,078
Uh, guys, you want
to run through

1005
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:58,732
what we've excluded so far?

1006
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,995
Jesus, DEVO, OJ,

1007
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:02,953
Mark Fuhrman, the Black Dahlia.

1008
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,739
We also... remember,
we found out that's not

1009
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:07,610
a... that's not a microchip.

1010
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:09,090
It's seaweed.

1011
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,874
I knew that going in.

1012
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:14,052
But we have eliminated some
of these possibilities.

1013
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,358
It's come to my attention, uh,

1014
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:18,447
that I think we have
not been looking

1015
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,494
at... where there's smoke,
there's sometimes fire.

1016
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:24,714
And I know everyone said they
don't know Mr. Richnickie,

1017
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,629
is that correct?

1018
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:28,370
- Yeah.
- Mm.

1019
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,981
I mean, you know him,
because Reno's not a big town.

1020
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,852
I mean, I know him.
Not a big town.

1021
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:33,636
I wouldn't say that.

1022
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:34,961
Jim, I will say we're
on the same bowling team.

1023
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:35,638
You're on the same bowling team.

1024
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,423
It's right there.

1025
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,122
So you obviously know
that Richnickie and I

1026
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,820
own a balance beam
and jump rope play place,

1027
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,648
which is not thriving.

1028
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:48,434
And, um... so what?

1029
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:49,696
I know him.

1030
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,065
And I have
a small business with him.

1031
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,612
And he owes me some money.

1032
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,222
We were in a band.

1033
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:57,660
We dated the same woman for...

1034
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,227
a little while.

1035
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,229
And that woman was my mother.

1036
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:03,536
And the, uh, third investor

1037
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:06,582
in my balance beam
and jump rope business.

1038
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:09,150
To be clear,
I think what interested her

1039
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:12,110
is the low overhead and
the small initial investment.

1040
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,894
It is a great idea.

1041
00:35:13,981 --> 00:35:17,158
Then why do you need so
much money from other people?

1042
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:18,420
Because I'm generous.

1043
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,118
We should take
all these guys down...

1044
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:21,728
Oh... oh, I don't know about that!

1045
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,053
- And put up all of us.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1046
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,513
This is...
Declan!

1047
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,230
- Like, even as a background...
- Holy shit.

1048
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,168
Guys, guys, guys. Sorry.

1049
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:28,648
I think I found a clue.

1050
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,408
Listen, I don't know
if it has something to do

1051
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,540
with these notes or not,
but I found this

1052
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,479
in the parking lot
and I think it's a clue.

1053
00:35:33,566 --> 00:35:35,437
Pig in a jar!
Yes, it's a clue!

1054
00:35:35,524 --> 00:35:37,067
We don't get this every day.
It's a clue.

1055
00:35:37,091 --> 00:35:38,875
It's not just a clue.

1056
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,486
It's also a warning.

1057
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:42,246
How many pigs are there
supposed to be in the story?

1058
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,924
- Three.
- How many aren't here?

1059
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,752
Two.

1060
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,102
Someone who should be
an ally is, in fact...

1061
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:49,364
Someone with two faces.

1062
00:35:49,451 --> 00:35:51,061
- Someone...
- A two-faced pig

1063
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,411
is betraying the other two pigs.

1064
00:35:52,498 --> 00:35:53,518
And a piggy...
Where does piggy go?

1065
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,153
Where does the piggy go?
The market.

1066
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,328
Went to the market!

1067
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:58,547
Guys, what do people call us?

1068
00:35:58,634 --> 00:35:59,809
Pigs.

1069
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,811
We need to go to the market.

1070
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:05,119
These little piggies
go to market.

1071
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:06,903
I cracked it!
I grassed it.

1072
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,340
Fantastic.

1073
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:09,708
You're undercover, we're all...
Hey, guys?

1074
00:36:09,732 --> 00:36:11,081
- Yeah.
- The board works.

1075
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:11,778
The board did work.

1076
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:13,780
There it is!

1077
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,043
What are you guys doing
messing with my face soup?

1078
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,108
I put it outside 'cause
it needs to cook in the sun,

1079
00:36:18,132 --> 00:36:19,699
like sun tea.

1080
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:20,937
That's why I left it
in the parking lot.

1081
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,417
So this is not a clue
that we're supposed

1082
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,356
to go down to the market?
No!

1083
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,096
White people, always
taking your stuff.

1084
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,446
- Yes.
- Am I right?

1085
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:28,708
Yes, they do.

1086
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,188
Yes, they do.
Face soup.

1087
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,363
Face soup.

1088
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,408
- Face soup.
- You know what?

1089
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,366
Now that I think about it,
I've seen your ads

1090
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:35,671
for it on Facebook.
Yeah.

1091
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:38,409
- Ooh.
- Just a weird odor.

1092
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:40,067
I like it.
Oh, I like it.

1093
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:41,154
Oh, that feels good.

1094
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,461
Ugh!

1095
00:36:42,548 --> 00:36:44,003
It's... it burns the back
of my throat.

1096
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,377
My whole mouth is cold.

1097
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:46,291
I mean, it's got a nose...
There's a little

1098
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,031
bit of nose in mine.

1099
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:54,299
<i>It's another beautiful day
at the Sierra Nugget Mall.</i>

1100
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:56,823
Thank you, ma'am.

1101
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,930
Tell your friends who have money

1102
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,739
to come back and see us.
Yes.

1103
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,349
Kenny Rogers!

1104
00:37:01,436 --> 00:37:02,263
- Kenny Rogers.
- Hello.

1105
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,309
Right this way, go ahead.
Hello.

1106
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:05,658
- Sheriff's Department.
- Hey.

1107
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,225
Guess who is back.
Ugh.

1108
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,312
Ugh, son of a bitch.

1109
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:09,531
Come on, man.

1110
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:10,880
I saw them. They came through.

1111
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:12,534
<i>Hola!</i>

1112
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:13,535
- Past the dino, and...
- <i>Donde esta?</i>

1113
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:14,797
Come out, come out. Hello.

1114
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:16,625
<i>Donde esta?</i>
Hello.

1115
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,081
You never know where
she's going to be.

1116
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,193
- All right.
- Hello?

1117
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,935
Ahh!

1118
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:23,458
How y'all doing?

1119
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,243
Nope, nope.

1120
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:26,330
Be a lady.
Come on, now.

1121
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:27,680
Get away from me, ghost!

1122
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:28,811
No, no... give me that leg.

1123
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:29,898
T.T.!

1124
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,120
No, no.

1125
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,600
Slow... no running!

1126
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:35,992
Get over here, T.T.!

1127
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:36,776
Uh-uh. No.

1128
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:38,473
No. No, T.T.

1129
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,213
- That's a weapon.
- T.T., stop.

1130
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,954
T.T.!
T.T.

1131
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,521
Don't let her into that one.

1132
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:43,957
She's got high ground.
Ahh!

1133
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:44,914
Ahh! Easy.

1134
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:47,177
No. No. No.

1135
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,309
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

1136
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,615
Don't hit the cock!

1137
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:50,398
Oh, sh...

1138
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:51,834
Let's take a break.

1139
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:53,358
It's a ghost.

1140
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,142
It's a ghost in there.
A ghost?

1141
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,274
- In here?
- A ghost?

1142
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:58,058
- A ghost.
- Come on, now.

1143
00:37:58,145 --> 00:37:59,340
- What's the spirit look like?
- A old white lady.

1144
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:00,669
- OK.
- Old white lady.

1145
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,323
Leave that ghost alone, T.T.

1146
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,410
Don't beat up the ghost.

1147
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:04,804
- No, no, no, no!
- No, T.T.!

1148
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,719
Get away from me, you old ghost!

1149
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:07,546
- Don't go behind there!
- No, no, no, no, no.

1150
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:08,503
Don't go behind there!

1151
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,590
No, no, no!

1152
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:10,984
Where did she go?

1153
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,701
Get away from here,
you old white lady ghost!

1154
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,204
- No.
- I see her!

1155
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,945
She's right here in the front!
T.T.!

1156
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:17,032
I got her.

1157
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:19,471
Hey, stop it!

1158
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:22,996
Hey!

1159
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:27,696
Hey, hey!

1160
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:28,393
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hi, guys!

1161
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,611
Dangle!

1162
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,178
Did you get the call, or...

1163
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,397
About the ghost?

1164
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:34,007
No, T.T.

1165
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,534
T.T.'s in here.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1166
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,053
Oh, I'm sorry, guys. No, no.

1167
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,881
I've been using this place
instead of a gym.

1168
00:38:38,968 --> 00:38:41,754
Uh, the fancy gyms want
$20, $30 a month.

1169
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,122
I'm not going to pay that.
Yeah.

1170
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:44,146
I can come here.

1171
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:45,191
I'm getting exploded.

1172
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,586
- Stop!
- No!

1173
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,283
I got to do, like,
three more laps.

1174
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,850
So I wish you bonne chance,

1175
00:38:50,937 --> 00:38:52,417
and please watch out
for the ghost.

1176
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,331
I'm going in.
T.T.!

1177
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,680
T.T.!

1178
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:55,831
- All right. We lost her.
- We lost her.

1179
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,074
- T.T.!
- T.T.!

1180
00:38:58,161 --> 00:38:59,075
Oh, I got her.

1181
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:00,163
I got her!

1182
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:03,602
Happy birthday, Eddie!

1183
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,169
Did they do
the birthday cake yet?

1184
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:10,173
I hid in the maze
like they told me.

1185
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,264
OK, um, why don't
you wait for Eddie?

1186
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,831
Psst. Psst. Come here.

1187
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,461
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

1188
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,008
That wristband she has on?

1189
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:20,975
We haven't sold that color
for, like, two years.

1190
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,426
- Old white lady ghost.
- Old white lady ghost.

1191
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,538
- Yeah.
- Go, go, go.

1192
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:28,453
No, no, no. Don't leave me.

1193
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,804
Hi, ghost!

1194
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:38,724
Father Nicholas has left me

1195
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,856
a splendid box
this Christmas morrow,

1196
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,642
and inside,
just what I asked for...

1197
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:45,426
A real boy.

1198
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:50,578
♪ Happy holidays ♪

1199
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:56,018
♪ Reno ♪

1200
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,899
I quite frankly think
that Mr. Richnickie

1201
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,162
might be making up
the whole ransom note thing,

1202
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:10,966
and someone wanting
to steal a silver nugget.

1203
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,600
I do.

1204
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:15,255
And I can't blame him,
because I once sent

1205
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:19,128
ransom notes to my own parents,

1206
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:21,435
pretending like
I had been kidnapped.

1207
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:24,873
And they did not respond.

1208
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:29,791
You know, I did some
background on Richnickie,

1209
00:41:29,878 --> 00:41:31,445
and I don't know
if this is something,

1210
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,620
but I think it might be.

1211
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:34,230
20 years ago, he had a car wash,

1212
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:36,295
and the way he used to get
people to come to the car wash

1213
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,540
was he had some
rhodium displayed

1214
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:41,411
in a Plexiglass case.

1215
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,110
If you don't know, rhodium
is the most precious metal.

1216
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:46,286
It got stolen as well.

1217
00:41:48,244 --> 00:41:49,637
Anything?

1218
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,073
Hi, how are you today?

1219
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,422
There you go.

1220
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,902
All right.

1221
00:41:53,989 --> 00:41:55,227
Now, you're not
going to believe it.

1222
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:56,470
That's the Sierra Nugget.

1223
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,863
Can you believe it?

1224
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,127
She's my pride and joy,

1225
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:03,085
and she's insured for a fortune.

1226
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,870
Beautiful.

1227
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,532
We have been
in the Christmas pageant

1228
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:17,883
a whole bunch of times,
and it was a'ight.

1229
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,320
But now... Get ready for this,

1230
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:22,540
because Dangle came up
with an idea

1231
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:25,238
for us to top
what we did last year.

1232
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:27,980
We got live doves!

1233
00:42:28,067 --> 00:42:29,590
Live doves.

1234
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:33,942
There is a website called
CelebrationDovesOhMyMy.org.

1235
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:36,423
We have, uh,
dove catchers ready to go.

1236
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:37,772
- Yep.
- Dove Station Alpha.

1237
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:38,904
- Doves fly out.
- Check.

1238
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:40,166
Check. Hey.

1239
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,776
Ho ho ho.
Dove Station Zebra.

1240
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,082
Check.

1241
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,606
After the Christ child is born...

1242
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,434
I'm the Christ child,
of course...

1243
00:42:47,521 --> 00:42:50,437
We will then release the doves.

1244
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:51,545
Get ready.
Right, we all ready?

1245
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,701
Y'all get ready.

1246
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:54,963
It's got bubble wrap.

1247
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,051
Save the bubble wrap.

1248
00:42:56,138 --> 00:42:57,487
I like... I like bubble wrap.

1249
00:42:59,315 --> 00:43:00,839
Huh.

1250
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:03,145
One alive, one frozen alive,
one dozen.

1251
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:06,714
There's lots and lots of them,
and they're very cold.

1252
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:10,109
It says you have
to reheat the dove.

1253
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:12,154
They came over in
a shipping container, right?

1254
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,765
Oh, that makes sense.
Oh, look at him.

1255
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:15,133
He's walking around,
and then he's flying.

1256
00:43:15,157 --> 00:43:16,768
This is not... actually
not that hard.

1257
00:43:16,855 --> 00:43:21,511
All we got to do is warm up,
uh, 120 frozen solid doves.

1258
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,904
I'll stick it down my shirt.

1259
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,055
That always works on everybody.
OK.

1260
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,254
I'll try that.

1261
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:28,344
Once they start waking up,

1262
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,085
be ready.

1263
00:43:30,172 --> 00:43:32,261
Jim, I got to say,
I think these are dead.

1264
00:43:32,348 --> 00:43:33,456
- They're just flash frozen.
- No.

1265
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,960
Mine is not coming back yet.

1266
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:38,790
If anything, it's like
it's necrofying my skin.

1267
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:40,356
- Oh, my God.
- I heard this is how

1268
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:42,010
the first avian flu started,
by the way.

1269
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:43,533
That's probably very, very true.

1270
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:47,755
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1271
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:49,409
No, no.

1272
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,019
Ooh!

1273
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:52,586
Oh, my gosh.

1274
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:53,979
Starting to smell like chicken.

1275
00:43:54,066 --> 00:43:55,850
- Any luck?
- No.

1276
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:58,331
Well, I thought I saw
something move, but...

1277
00:43:58,418 --> 00:43:59,811
I had... I had a little feeling

1278
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:01,595
on this guy for a minute.

1279
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:03,336
Wait.

1280
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:04,467
No.

1281
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:05,686
So close, so close.

1282
00:44:05,773 --> 00:44:06,818
Wait.

1283
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:09,864
Nope. I'll be back.

1284
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,779
Keep the faith.

1285
00:44:17,045 --> 00:44:19,091
My worst experience
with the Junior Deputies

1286
00:44:19,178 --> 00:44:21,571
was when I got taken hostage
by them.

1287
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,443
Their demands were they wanted

1288
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,967
better living conditions
and food.

1289
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:29,014
I got released once we agreed
to expand their kennels

1290
00:44:29,101 --> 00:44:31,190
by 25 square feet

1291
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:33,714
and raised the fill line
on their dishes

1292
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,890
by an inch.

1293
00:44:35,977 --> 00:44:40,155
Have a lot of our
adult deputies gotten hurt

1294
00:44:40,242 --> 00:44:41,417
by the Junior Deputies?

1295
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:43,289
Of course.

1296
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,441
Did Trudy get rabies from
one of the Junior Deputies?

1297
00:44:45,465 --> 00:44:47,206
Yes.

1298
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:48,966
These are youngsters, often,
that were maybe left

1299
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:54,343
at the station,
and you can't judge them

1300
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,258
the way you would
a normal person.

1301
00:44:56,345 --> 00:44:58,145
And we've asked a judge
to do that many times.

1302
00:44:58,173 --> 00:44:59,827
And they say, no,
these are children.

1303
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:09,619
Aaand away we go!

1304
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,578
Hi, Junior Deputies.

1305
00:45:11,665 --> 00:45:15,234
My name is Deputy Trudy Wiegel,

1306
00:45:15,321 --> 00:45:20,326
and I am going to take you
on this magical sleigh ride

1307
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:24,678
to see a wowser
of a holiday pageant.

1308
00:45:24,765 --> 00:45:26,724
Which was written by my friend

1309
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:30,902
and sometimes lover, Jim Dangle.

1310
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:32,294
Sir, I'm gonna...

1311
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:34,296
I'm gonna need
to have you sit down.

1312
00:45:34,383 --> 00:45:36,821
Um, OK.

1313
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:40,215
It's ma'am, but obviously
that's apparent.

1314
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,478
We stay in our seats
because this

1315
00:45:42,565 --> 00:45:45,307
is the safest bus in the West.

1316
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:49,181
When I say safest bus,
you say the...

1317
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:52,314
Did some...

1318
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:53,968
Did somebody bring nuts
on this bus?

1319
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:58,494
This is a nut-free z... zone.

1320
00:45:58,581 --> 00:46:00,061
Ahh!

1321
00:46:00,148 --> 00:46:01,671
You're a nut-free zone, right?

1322
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,630
What the hell?

1323
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,548
I'm deathly a...

1324
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:12,117
Allergic to n... nuts!

1325
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:13,509
She's very dramatic.

1326
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:15,729
Holy shit!

1327
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:20,908
Are you OK?

1328
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:23,476
Oh, my God, that's so gross.

1329
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:30,657
Ahh!

1330
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,138

Declan's got an idea.

00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,329
We're going to try
tasing the dead dove.

1334
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,133
I'm only doing this
because I wanted to get out

1335
00:46:52,157 --> 00:46:53,723
of the briefing room,
where everybody

1336
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,595
has a dove in their crotch.

1337
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,600
Really?

1338
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,384
Is it stuck?

1339
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:04,256
No.

1340
00:47:04,343 --> 00:47:05,537
I can help you with
that later, if you like.

1341
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:06,867
I'm good.

1342
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:13,874
Ta-dah!

1343
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,311
So we went in the evidence room

1344
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:19,532
and got a little bit
of the white lady.

1345
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,100
A little bit of, uh, yo-yo.

1346
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:25,016
A little bit of the white horse.

1347
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,322
A little bit of that,
uh, Bea Arthur.

1348
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:29,692
Cocaine, if y'all don't know.

1349
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:30,848
We... we got some cocaine.

1350
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:32,937
Uh, Cloris Leachman.

1351
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:34,547
OK, OK.

1352
00:47:34,634 --> 00:47:35,896
Is that the nose?

1353
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:38,072
Here you go, little birdie.

1354
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,206
OK, now, let me
make him snort it.

1355
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:42,947
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1356
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:45,645
Oh!

1357
00:47:51,129 --> 00:47:52,913
Heard you guys gave
c... cocaine to the...

1358
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,002
- Yeah.
- Yeah, cool.

1359

This guy's coming along.
This guy's coming pretty good.

1360

Is it happening?

1361
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,919
I think so, yeah.

1362
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,878
- Jim, you want a little?
- I would. I would.

1363
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:01,879
Are we talking about that,
or are we just doing it?

1364
00:48:01,966 --> 00:48:02,749
Yeah. Yeah.

1365
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:05,317
Mm-hmm.

1366
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:06,947
I think that helped.
I think that did help.

1367
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:08,233
Oh, that definitely helped.

Like my little friend
Benjamin here,

who grew up right inside
the Reno Sheriff's Department.

1383
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:45,400
Say hi to my little friend Belphegor,

1384
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,446
Demon God of Sloth.

1385

Hi. Yeah.

1386

Belphegor,
Demon God of Sloth spent

1387
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,323
17 Christmases in a row with us,

1388
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:59,066
and thanks to your donations,
he's...

1389
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,415
totally fine.

1390
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:02,983
I am also hell's ambassador
to France,

1391
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,159
as described by the poet Milton.

1392
00:49:05,246 --> 00:49:06,552
In my spare time,

1393
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,510
I am the tempter
of witch hunters

1394
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:11,078
with the promise of riches
and great discoveries

1395
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:12,645
that will slip through
your fingers.

1396
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:15,213
And he touches everyone's
leftovers in the fridge

1397
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,302
to gain power over them.
Touché.

1398
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,565
The hand of Belphegor
knows thy dirty deeds.

1399
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,309
Great.

1400
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:26,267
Mortals, won't you put
a little Christmas cheer

1401
00:49:26,354 --> 00:49:27,834
under the tree
for the boys and girls

1402
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:29,662
of the Reno Junior Deputies?

1403
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:32,012
Just pennies a day could
take an unwanted basket case

1404
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:34,058
and turn them into me

1405
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:36,408
or my fetching bride, Freckles.

1406
00:49:39,846 --> 00:49:42,240
Hail the Dark Lord.

1407
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:45,591

00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:01,389
Well, the state of Nevada
is getting sued

1413
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:04,218
because do-gooders
like these ones over here

1414
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:06,307
have been wishing people
Merry Christmas

1415
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:07,743
on state property.

1416
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,180
You can't do that anymore.

1417
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,530
That is a clear violation
of the separation

1418
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:13,358
of church and state,
so we go over there,

1419
00:50:13,445 --> 00:50:14,750
get them to say Merry Christmas,

1420
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:16,013
and we take them in.

1421
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,536
Check, check, check, check.

1422
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:19,755
Ow!

1423
00:50:19,842 --> 00:50:21,583
Godspeed, you... shit!

1424
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:22,889
Unbelievable. Really.

1425
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:24,369
Break a leg.

1426
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:25,607
I've got a good backstory
for us.

1427
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,893
All right. Oh.

1428
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,634
- Hello.
- Hello.

1429
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:30,027
Hi. Happy holidays.

1430
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:30,810
- How you doing?
- Happy holidays.

1431
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:32,029
And also with you.

1432
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:33,291
Thank you so much.

1433
00:50:33,378 --> 00:50:35,467
This is my second
husband, Jules.

1434
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:37,251
We were having
an emotional affair,

1435
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:39,297
and when we decided
to take it physical,

1436
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:41,951
I asked my first husband
for a divorce.

1437
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,128
And now we're very happy.

1438
00:50:45,085 --> 00:50:46,260
- Yep.
- Yeah.

1439
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:48,306
Due to our Episcopalian faith,

1440
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:50,090
we come in at this time of year

1441
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,005
to spend this special day
with our kids.

1442
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,441
Right. Specifically the 25th.

1443
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,095
<i>- The celebration.
- Yeah.</i>

1444
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,966
- Sure.
- So close to winter solstice.

1445
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,403
- Yes.
- Right.

1446
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,840
I'll come downstairs dressed up

1447
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,059
like Santa Claus.
Yes.

1448
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:04,931
And I say, ho, ho, ho!

1449
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:07,803
Both: Happy holidays!

1450
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,240
- No.
- Thank you so much.

1451
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:10,632
Thank you. Thank you.

1452
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,938
Happy holidays.

1453
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:14,071
- Oh, greetings to you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1454
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:15,376
<i>This would mean so much to us.</i>

1455
00:51:15,463 --> 00:51:16,943
We both have
early-onset Alzheimer's,

1456
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,380
and it can be very upsetting

1457
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:20,120
when we can't come up
with something

1458
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:22,166
that's so, so obvious.

1459
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:23,950
- I'll try.
- Here we go.

No, no, no.
But what is it?

1464
00:51:30,652 --> 00:51:32,492
What are the words?
Yeah, what are the words?

1465
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:33,631
Oh, my gosh,
I'm so bad with this.

1466
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:34,975
Because I actually have dyslexia,

1467
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:36,354
but for song lyrics.

1468
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,268
So I can't.

1469
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:38,747
Yeah, I prefer to karaoke.

1470
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:40,053
I'm the same way.
Yeah.

1471
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,620
Thank you.
Happy fourth quarter.

1472
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:42,707
Season's greetings.

1473
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:43,752
Fourth quarter?

1474
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,102
Happy holidays.

1475
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:46,103
What else could
you say right now?

1476
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,496
- Hmm.
- Uh...

1477
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:49,758
Um...

1478
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,543
Would wish someone.

1479
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:52,955
I think I know where
you're going with this.

1480
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,198
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

1481
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:55,764
<i>Uh-huh.
And I don't know-</i>

1482
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:58,550
Are you talking about the
anniversary of the execution

1483
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:01,335
of Romanian dictator
Nicolas Ceausescu?

1484
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:03,032
In 1989...
Did this happen?

1485
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,271
During the Romanian Revolution,

1486
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,489
on December 25?
You know what?

1487
00:52:05,513 --> 00:52:07,298
I think you two are blameless.

1488
00:52:07,385 --> 00:52:09,213
I'm sorry for taking
up your time, ma'am.

1489
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,214
You're doing good work.

1490
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:11,563
Hey! What did you just say?

1491
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,173
Sorry for taking
up your time, ma'am.

1492
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,741
You just gendered me on
state property, motherfucker.

1493
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:16,829
I'm a they!

1494
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:18,439
ACLU.

1495
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:19,136
Put your hands behind your back.

1496
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:20,093
OK. Wait a minute.
Hold on.

1497
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,399
<i>Oh, come on. Hey. Hey.</i>

1498
00:52:21,486 --> 00:52:22,835
<i>Put your hands behind your back.</i>

1499
00:52:22,922 --> 00:52:24,271
<i>In his defense, he is very old.</i>

1500
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:25,838
I, for one,
am happy to be gendered.

1501
00:52:25,925 --> 00:52:27,448
I am a lady.

1502
00:52:27,535 --> 00:52:29,189
And I'm a big swinging dick man.

1503
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:31,496
Everything's gonna be OK.

1504
00:52:31,583 --> 00:52:32,932
One, two, three, eyes on me.

1505
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,673
One, two, three, eyes on me.
Look at me!

1506
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,022
Look at me! OK.

1507
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:37,241
Do not freak out!

1508
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:38,981
Do not freak out on me!

1509
00:52:39,068 --> 00:52:40,307
Everything is going to be fine!

1510
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:41,941
Things could be worse.

1511
00:52:42,028 --> 00:52:44,030
Have you ever heard of 'Nam?

1512
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:46,119
I'm not sure what it is.

1513
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:47,686
But I do know that
a lot of old men

1514
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,297
are real pissed about it,
so it's like that.

1515
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:51,994
We're going to keep
our shit together,

1516
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:53,126
and we're not gonna... see!

1517
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:55,694
Hello, children. Sir.

1518
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,349
Look, we are so sorry that
you guys had to witness

1519
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:01,526
that lady get run over
next to the bus.

1520
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:03,876
She had an allergic reaction
to some chestnuts,

1521
00:53:03,963 --> 00:53:04,790
and she panicked.

1522
00:53:04,877 --> 00:53:06,139
Super weird.

1523
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,706
And the other motorist...

1524
00:53:07,793 --> 00:53:10,578
Also dead from the shock
of splattering that lady.

1525
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:12,798
Don't let them look outside.
It's bad.

1526
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:14,384
You got to keep them calm.
Keep them calm.

1527
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,280
We got vultures.

1528
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:17,237
Vultures.

1529
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:18,586
Code V. Code V. Keep them calm!

1530
00:53:18,673 --> 00:53:20,022
Look at me!
Look at me!

One, two, three, eyes on me.

1532
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:22,851
One, two, three.
They're just birds!

1533
00:53:22,938 --> 00:53:23,938
Everybody loves birds.

We have another microwave, actually.

You guys don't have to use
popcorn mode for everything.

We have 106 left to do, then.

1562
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:43,192
- Yeah.
- We need more microwave.

1563
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,324
Yeah.

1564
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:45,543
Great idea.

1565
00:54:47,545 --> 00:54:49,111
Oh!

00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:52,027
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

This is just the cycle
of life, all right?

1574
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:14,093
The vultures are just
doing their job

1575
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,442
eating those entrails.

1576
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,313
- Yeah.
- All right?

1577
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,520
I strangled a bunch of them,

1578
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:18,682
and I think I got the alpha.

1579
00:55:18,706 --> 00:55:19,968
So we're going to be OK.

1580
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:21,335
The alpha's dead,
and we should...

1581
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,581
OK. Alpha's still alive.

1582
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:24,712
Alpha's still in play!

1583
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,497
Alpha's still in play!

1584
00:55:26,584 --> 00:55:27,976
We're not gonna get off the bus,

1585
00:55:28,063 --> 00:55:29,978
'cause we don't want the alpha
to kill us, OK?

1586
00:55:30,065 --> 00:55:31,284
Good, children!

1587
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:33,112
Children! I've got the alpha!

1588
00:55:34,983 --> 00:55:36,047
- Ahh!
- Keep your eyes away!

1589
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:36,942
I think I got him!

1590
00:55:37,029 --> 00:55:38,117
I got him!

1591
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:41,512
This is part of nature!

1592
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:49,520
Jim Dangle's Christmas
pageant script.

1593
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:55,264
Um, 190 pages.

1594
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,330
But I got to give it to him,
three or four of those pages

1595
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,442
are really, really good.

1596
00:55:58,529 --> 00:56:00,008
Solid.

1597
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:01,532
Sondheim level.

1598
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:07,581
Ho, ho, ho!

1599
00:56:08,843 --> 00:56:12,020
Someone order one
Christmas miracle,

1600
00:56:12,107 --> 00:56:14,849
shipping and handling included?

1601
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:16,111
I was so scared!

1602
00:56:16,198 --> 00:56:17,548
Of course you were.

1603
00:56:17,635 --> 00:56:19,506
I had a stroke of genius,

1604
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:21,726
which I very seldom do.

1605
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:24,859
These bandits could never get
to your semi-precious nugget

1606
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:27,514
if it's playing a "star"

1607
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:30,256
ing role in the pageant.

1608
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:31,343
Did it get Jesus?

1609
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,867
Did my nugget get Jesus?

1610
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:34,303
I'm obviously playing Jesus.

1611
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,088
Your nugget...
Is playing-

1612
00:56:36,175 --> 00:56:37,437
A star...

1613
00:56:37,524 --> 00:56:38,656
- The Wise Men...
ing role.

1614
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:39,961
All three Wise Men.

1615
00:56:40,048 --> 00:56:42,007
No, that's... the

1616
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:44,183
The myrrh?

1617
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,448
Mr. Richnickie,
your semi-precious nugget

1618
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:50,407
will be playing...

1619
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,800
the Star of Bethlehem.

1620
00:56:52,887 --> 00:56:54,672
It's going to be right there...
Mm.

1621
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:57,326
Underneath the entire
Reno Sheriff's Department

1622
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,155
as we do our pageant,
safe as houses.

1623
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:02,854
And as soon as it's midnight,
you're in the clear.

1624
00:57:02,941 --> 00:57:05,204
Oh!

1625
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:06,771
It's hidden in plain sight.

1626
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:23,570
Never get off the bus.

1627
00:57:23,657 --> 00:57:25,050
Never get...

1628
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:27,052
Oh, my God,
I have to talk to children?

1629
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:28,662
OK. OK.

1630
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:30,272
OK. Hi.

1631
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:31,970
Hi. I got this.

1632
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,147
Hello, children.

1633
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,062
Two cars just collided, and...

1634
00:57:37,149 --> 00:57:38,716
I'm so sorry,
I can't lie to children.

1635
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:40,892
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- OK, I got this.

1636
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:44,678
A car collided with a trailer
full of petting zoo animals!

1637
00:57:44,765 --> 00:57:46,550
Aw!

1638
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:47,812
- Aw!
- But... but... but

1639
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:49,640
the good news...
Good news is the...

1640
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:52,425
The screams you hear
are not human.

1641
00:57:54,296 --> 00:57:57,517
They're the screams
of miniature horses.

1642
00:57:57,604 --> 00:58:00,520
They weren't adult horses, so...

1643
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:02,783
Could have been worse, see?
Could've been worse.

1644
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,699
Oh, God, the horror!

1645
00:58:05,786 --> 00:58:07,396
Also, it's electrified
out there.

1646
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,224
The helicopter cut
some power lines.

1647
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:12,097
So be careful, unless you
have some rubber-soled shoes.

1648
00:58:12,184 --> 00:58:13,054
Sure.

1649
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:14,403
Oh, no!

1650
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,231
I hate this job!

1651
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,320
Also could be very slippery.

1652
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:20,932
- Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers!

1653
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:23,064
- Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers!

1654
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:24,979
- Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny... uh-oh!

1655
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:26,459
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

1656
00:58:26,546 --> 00:58:30,419
Born 21 August, 1938,
Kenneth Donald Rogers,

1657
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,160
known to his family
as Kenny Ray...

1658
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:33,553
Follow me, sir.

1659
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:36,643
Come on, Frank.

1660
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,211
That's better.

1661
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:40,386
We're naked for 36 pages

1662
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:42,170

1663
00:58:42,257 --> 00:58:43,452
You know, Jim's got himself
a pump back there.

1664
00:58:43,476 --> 00:58:44,738
Yeah, he loves that.

1665
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,348
Yeah, he fluffs himself
up for it,

1666
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:48,065
and we've got to go out there
just with what we got.

1667
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:49,656
I don't wanna do this.

1668
00:58:49,743 --> 00:58:52,833

this does cost $38.

1669

01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:05,199
God, we've been given
these beautiful bodies.

1757
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:07,680
OK, that was one one-thousandth
of the energy

1758
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:09,813
I want on the day, OK?
OK.

1759
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,598
Fun family show for
the fucking Junior Deputies,

1760
01:02:12,685 --> 01:02:15,775
some of whom are recovering
from crack problems, OK?

1761
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,038
Let's pick it up at the...
We've arrived at the manger,

1762
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,692
there's no room,
there's no room.

1763
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:22,260
There's no room in the manger!

1764
01:02:22,347 --> 01:02:23,933
You're not going to do it
like that, are you?

1765
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:25,437
I was.

1766
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:26,917
Can I see it a little bigger?

1767
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:31,965
There's no room in the manger.

1768
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,073
See, that's why this is a show.

1769
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:34,925
That's why this is a show.
That's it.

1770
01:02:59,297 --> 01:03:01,690
Fear not, little goyim.

1771
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:03,997
Your rescue is at hand.

1772
01:03:05,303 --> 01:03:06,347
Oh.

1773
01:03:08,523 --> 01:03:10,351
Shalom, baby.

1774
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:13,746
Hatzalah at your service.

1775
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:17,750
We was, uh, circling
in the Black Hawk chopper.

1776
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:19,970
We saw you were in distress.

1777
01:03:20,057 --> 01:03:22,973
We got here in two shakes
of a mule's bottom.

1778
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:24,365
Thank God you're here!

1779
01:03:24,452 --> 01:03:27,194
We was, uh, doing
mitzvahing this week.

1780
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:29,806
It's best way to celebrate
sixth night of Hanukkah.

1781
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:31,764
Oh, we were also just

1782
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:33,635
celebrating Hanukkah.
Great.

1783
01:03:33,722 --> 01:03:38,075
How about we tow this bus
to wherever it is you're going?

1784
01:03:38,162 --> 01:03:39,772
Oh, thank you!

1785
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,141
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

1786
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:42,383
It's forbidden.

1787
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:43,621
Thank you, at least,
for recognizing

1788
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:45,734
that I am indeed a female.

1789
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,780
Of course! You are woman.

1790
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:52,916
You are 100% filthy,
disgusting woman

1791
01:03:53,003 --> 01:03:56,354
that I would not schtup
through hole in two sheets.

1792
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:57,921
OK.

1793
01:03:58,008 --> 01:03:59,052
It's been a long day.
OK.

1794
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:00,401
Of course.

1795
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:03,274
So who wants to be Jewish
like Ivanka Trump,

1796
01:04:03,361 --> 01:04:05,102
most beautiful woman in world?

1797
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:06,755
OK. See me afterwards.

1798
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,235
I have pamphlets.
OK.

1799
01:04:08,322 --> 01:04:10,237
- Let's hook you up to tank...
- Yes.

1800
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:11,604
And get you where you need
to go.

1801
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,284
- Yes!
- Huh?

1802
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:16,591
Hatzalah.
Hatzalah.

1803
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:18,289
Just the boys. Hatzalah.

1804
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:20,030
Good. Hatzalah.

1805
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:21,727
- Just the girls.
- No, not the girls.

1806
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:22,814
- Nope.
alah.

1807
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,737
Even the animals in
the barn rejoiced at this...

1808
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,149
Hi, guys.
I got the Junior Deputies.

1809
01:04:33,173 --> 01:04:34,827
Everything is totally cool
and fine.

1810
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:36,176
What the hell happened to you?

1811
01:04:36,263 --> 01:04:37,458
Yeah, nothing!
Everything's fine.

1812
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:38,720
I got the Junior Deputies here,
safe and sound.

1813
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:40,006
Everybody's good.
Go, go, go!

1814
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:41,679
You're fine. You're fine.
Go. Great seats.

1815
01:04:41,703 --> 01:04:42,767
Great seats still available.
Everybody's fine.

1816
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:44,358
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1817
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:46,883
Enjoy the greatest story
ever told, Junior Deputies.

1818
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,319
- You got to get dressed.
- Yes.

1819
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:49,711
OK. Everything's fine.

1820
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:51,238
Everything is good.
OK, tighten up.

1821
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:53,150
We're running about
90 minutes late,

1822
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,301
but that's not going
to affect our energy.

1823
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:55,804
You're not going to believe it!

1824
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:00,157
We booked Inkeba Bathetois.

1825
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:02,724
Local meteorologist
Inkeba Bathetois?

1826
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:04,335
Yes, that very one.

1827
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:06,076
But she can sing, too!

1828
01:05:06,163 --> 01:05:07,314
She's even better at singing than

1829
01:05:07,338 --> 01:05:09,514
she is at predicting
cloud stuff!

1830
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:10,970
Mr. Richnickie,
stop talking for two seconds

1831
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:12,101
before I punch you in the face.

1832
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:13,910
I just want to make it clear.

1833
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,365
She's going to go...
Local meteorologist

1834
01:05:15,389 --> 01:05:18,262
Inkeba Bathetois is going
to go on right after us?

1835
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:20,046
Local meteorologist
Inkeba Bathetois,

1836
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,632
and beautiful singer
Inkeba Bathetois...

1837
01:05:21,656 --> 01:05:23,006
And Peabody Award winner.

1838
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,442
Is going on momentarily.

1839
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:26,052
And everyone is very excited.

1840
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:27,793
Also, she told me
to tell you not

1841
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,447
to look her directly
in the face.

1842
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:30,990
- Oh, sure.
- 'Cause she's very famous

1843
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,014
and does not like that.

1844
01:05:32,058 --> 01:05:33,407
I'm going to go introduce her.

1845
01:05:33,494 --> 01:05:35,279
This is going to be so great!
I can't wait!

1846
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:38,412
Also, your green room is now
her assistant's green room,

1847
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:39,868
so you don't have
a green room no more.

1848
01:05:39,892 --> 01:05:41,850
I love you!
Great.

1849
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,567
Don't go in her green room.
I got to focus on the text.

1850
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:45,506
It's going to be great.
Prayer, prayer, prayer.

1851
01:05:45,593 --> 01:05:50,598
Right now, it's Reno Sheriff's
Department versus the world.

1852
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,209
The butterflies.

1853
01:05:52,296 --> 01:05:54,298
It's OK to throw up
before you go on.

1854
01:05:54,385 --> 01:05:57,127
It might even make
you look less bloated.

1855
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:59,042
I'm not looking
at anybody specifically,

1856
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:00,489
but if you need
to throw up before,

1857
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:04,090
the butterflies are your friend
for definition.

1858
01:06:04,177 --> 01:06:09,052
Now, I know there's 150 pages
of the script

1859
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:11,880
we didn't really get to,
or talk about, or block.

1860
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,405
But greatest story ever told.

1861
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,015
You're bringing
to the Christ child?

1862
01:06:16,102 --> 01:06:17,712
- Myrrh.
- And you're bringing?

1863
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:18,799
I bring gold.

1864
01:06:18,844 --> 01:06:20,193
And Trudy is bringing?

1865
01:06:22,195 --> 01:06:25,155
Well, I think I read
the email wrong.

1866
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:26,460
It's OK.

1867
01:06:26,547 --> 01:06:27,984
I mean, it's kind
of the same story.

1868
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,333
Yeah, Jesus came back to life.

1869
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,161
Huddle up.
Huddle up, everybody.

1870
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:35,861
Are we the best actors
in the world?

1871
01:06:35,948 --> 01:06:36,731
- Yes.
- No.

1872
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:38,516
Oh.

1873
01:06:38,603 --> 01:06:40,822
Those are literally
always British people.

1874
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,563
But I think we got this.

1875
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,826
Ladies and gentlemen,

1876
01:06:44,913 --> 01:06:47,786
local meteorologist

1877
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:53,313
Inkeba Bathetois!

1878
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,836

Behold.

Behold, behold, behold
the greatest story ever told.

1898
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:20,748
We now miraculously transform
the Sierra Nugget Mall

1899
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:25,231
to the town of Bethlehem!

1900
01:08:25,318 --> 01:08:31,194
And now, Rome hath commanded
that a census be taken.

1901
01:08:31,281 --> 01:08:32,475
And then... I'm skipping ahead...

1902
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:34,980
Joseph, being from Bethlehem,

1903
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:37,374
traveled with Mary,

1904
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:39,289
his betrothed,
who was with child.

1905
01:08:39,376 --> 01:08:40,812
And they got to Bethlehem,

1906
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:42,901
and the guy at the inn
was like, we don't...

1907
01:08:42,988 --> 01:08:44,685
We don't have a...
See your reservation.

1908
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:47,123
And this is exactly what happens

1909
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,689
if you use the booking apps,

1910
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,604
which I'm begging you
not to use.

1911
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:54,434
And Mary,
who "wath" great with child,

1912
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:57,524
had to go have the baby
in a trough.

1913
01:08:57,611 --> 01:09:00,136
Just like Ricki Lake
in that movie

1914
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:02,094
whose name escapes me.

1915
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:04,488
Bethlehem!

1916
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:06,794
Night!

1917
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,405
Year zero!

1918
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:11,843
They followed the star.

Lights, lights, lights,

1933
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:06,724
My nugget!

1934
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,421
My nugget!

1935
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:10,206
My beautiful nugget,
where did you go?

1936
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:11,598
- Hey, guys!
- No. No.

1937
01:10:11,685 --> 01:10:13,861
The Kenny Rogers exhibit
is gone!

1938
01:10:15,515 --> 01:10:17,038
Those bastards!

1939
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,910
The whole mall is mortgaged
on that nugget!

1940
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:20,346
It is my life!

1941
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:22,392
They went that way!

1942
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:24,350
Go, go, go, go!

1943
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:25,699
Sons of bitches!

1944
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,137
We've got to get them home.

1945
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,704
Mm. OK.

1946
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:33,707
Um, show of hands,
who knows how to drive a bus?

1947
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:35,622
Anyone?

1948
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,102
- Wait!
- They're getting away!

1949
01:10:37,189 --> 01:10:38,538
Keep moving, Gunner!

1950
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,410
Put it down!
Put it down!

1951
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:42,325
Cover the exits.
Cover the exits.

1952
01:10:42,412 --> 01:10:44,390
In the name of the Reno
Sheriff's Department... no, no!

1953
01:10:44,414 --> 01:10:45,937
Don't you do it! Trudy!

1954
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:47,286
Trudy! Take cover.

1955
01:10:47,373 --> 01:10:48,200
Take cover. Take cover.

1956
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:50,507
No!
Son of a bitch!

1957
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:51,899
Go, Rizzo!
I got you covered!

1958
01:10:51,986 --> 01:10:52,987
Go, go, go!

1959
01:10:53,074 --> 01:10:55,381
Incoming!

1960
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:57,470
Retreat, retreat!

1961
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:59,777
He's got a bone!
He's throwing bones!

1962
01:10:59,864 --> 01:11:01,474
Time out. Time out.
Time out. Time out.

1963
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,041
Time out.

1964
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,044
What if we do a John McClane
Trojan horse?

1965
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,437
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1966
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:09,482
Sending out unarmed delegate.

1967
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,179
Guys, guys, guys.
Unarmed delegate.

1968
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,853
In the name of the Sheriff's
Department and Jesus Christ.

1969
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:15,053
- Truce.
- Let's just talk this out, OK?

1970
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:16,552
- Talk it out.
- Let's just talk this out.

1971
01:11:16,576 --> 01:11:17,925
Hands up.
Keep your hands up.

1972
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:19,692
We're gonna just
talk this out... Keith, now!

1973
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:22,452
What the hell?

1974
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,367
In your face!

1975
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:26,847
Go to hell!

1976
01:11:26,934 --> 01:11:28,849
No!

1977
01:11:30,938 --> 01:11:32,375
I got it!

1978
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:35,639
- Aww.
- Oh.

1979
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,162
Oh, what the hell, man!

1980
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:38,816
I'm on your side!

1981
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:40,576
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, my bad, Keith.

1982
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,949
Son of a bitch.

1983
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:43,211
Sorry, Keith.

1984
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:44,691
- Oh! Oh.
- Hey, hey.

1985
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:46,519
- What the hell!
- Now it's weird.

1986
01:11:46,606 --> 01:11:48,129
Get back. Get back.

1987
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,392
Hey!
Hey!

1988
01:11:49,479 --> 01:11:51,089
You guys! You guys! You guys!

1989
01:11:51,176 --> 01:11:52,264
Wait, wait, wait!

1990
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:54,527
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1991
01:11:54,614 --> 01:11:55,876
It's locked.

1992
01:11:55,963 --> 01:11:57,051
Security!

1993
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:58,966
Security!
Help!

1994
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:00,751
OK, kids. Look.

1995
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:03,449
We are right in the middle
of a heist.

1996
01:12:03,536 --> 01:12:06,104
As long as you have a buddy,

1997
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:09,237
you are safe to wander out
in the night.

1998
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:13,372
Ceviche, you drop that nugget!

1999
01:12:14,634 --> 01:12:16,201
All right.

2000
01:12:16,288 --> 01:12:18,029
I'll drop it.

2001
01:12:18,116 --> 01:12:21,249
Get a little taste
of the Texas tank!

2002
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,337
Hyah!

2003
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:26,733
No.

2004
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,779
It was an honest mistake.

2005
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:30,186
It could have
happened to anybody!

2006
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,137
Phew!

2007
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:42,749
I'm going to run!

2008
01:12:42,836 --> 01:12:44,664
Get out of here!

2009
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:47,145
I'm blanking on your name.

2010
01:12:47,232 --> 01:12:48,668
Um... Kimball.

2011
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:50,061
Oh, God.
I got it.

2012
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,548
I got it. Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

2013
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:52,933
He ain't coming through here.

2014
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:55,806
Oh!

2015
01:12:55,893 --> 01:12:57,392
- Watch out, buddy.
- Toss me the nugget.

2016
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:58,722
Don't do it!

2017
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:00,482
Toss me the nugget
and this ends right now!

2018
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:03,770
You want it so bad, catch.

2019
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:18,437
Oh!

2020
01:13:23,181 --> 01:13:24,225
Hold 'em or fold 'em?

2021
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:26,010
Let's play a little bit.

2022
01:13:26,097 --> 01:13:27,272
Come on, now.

2023
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:29,013
Yah!

2024
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:30,710
- Hold 'em!
- Fold 'em!

2025
01:13:30,797 --> 01:13:31,972
- Hold 'em!
- Fold 'em!

2026
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,104
Oh, it hurts so bad.

2027
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:34,192
Oh, it hurts so bad.

2028
01:13:34,279 --> 01:13:36,542
I fold 'em!

2029
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:38,370
There you are.

2030
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:40,067
- You hold 'em?
- I fold 'em.

2031
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:41,242
Fold 'em!

2032
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,944
It was a pleasure
to kick your ass.

2033
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:48,032
Let's go, buddy.

2034
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:49,381
Oh, look what I found.

2035
01:13:52,689 --> 01:13:53,777
Dangle!

2036
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:55,953
What have they done to you?

2037
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,607
I'm sorry, I forgot
your name for a bit.

2038
01:13:57,694 --> 01:13:59,106
I'm sorry.
It's all right. It's Kimball.

2039
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,237
- I'm so sorry.
- My name's Kimball.

2040
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:01,175
Oh, we got away with it.

2041
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:02,262
Smooth, baby, smooth!

2042
01:14:02,307 --> 01:14:03,961
We got away with it.

2043
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:05,504
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

2044
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:06,592
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

2045
01:14:06,616 --> 01:14:07,747
Wait. Wait.

2046
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:09,140
Looking for your gun, Dangle?

2047
01:14:09,227 --> 01:14:10,552
It's in the truck,
with all the rest.

2048
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:11,664
Ho, ho.

2049
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:13,013
Yes, we do this all the time.

2050
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,580
That's right.

2051
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,322
We go to a mall with a box
of Kenny Rogers' bones,

2052
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:18,889
and we hide in plain sight.

2053
01:14:18,976 --> 01:14:20,499
We go completely unnoticed,

2054
01:14:20,586 --> 01:14:22,022
and we steal all the best shit.

2055
01:14:22,109 --> 01:14:23,197
Yeah.

2056
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:25,417
It's the perfect crime.

2057
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:26,418
Is it, though?

2058
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:27,854
Kind of.

2059
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:29,856
Anyways, we're about
to do it again in Carson.

2060
01:14:29,943 --> 01:14:30,988
That's right.

2061
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:32,729
'Cause they got a Le Creuset.

2062
01:14:32,816 --> 01:14:34,426
- Oh!
- Oh!

2063
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:36,689
- What's that?
- Let's go, brother!

2064
01:14:36,776 --> 01:14:39,257
Move out. Move out.

2065
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:41,302
What the hell is going...

2066
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:42,652
Look!

2067
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:44,392
- Oh!
- Whoo!

2068
01:14:52,705 --> 01:14:54,707
Hatzolah, everybody!

2069
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:57,318
Oh, of course!

2070
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:59,146
Oh.

2071
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,393
Don't worry about these guys.

2072
01:15:00,452 --> 01:15:01,975
They're not going anywhere.

2073
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,977
We got them hooked up
to the Mitzvah Mobile.

2074
01:15:04,064 --> 01:15:06,284
- Wow!
- He's got this.

2075
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:07,851
He's got this. Great.

2076
01:15:07,938 --> 01:15:09,635
Time for a little
disco dance, huh?

2077
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:14,118
What would Christmas even be
without some cool Jewish guy

2078
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:16,120
showing up to save
some folks, huh?

2079
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:17,904
Oh!

2080
01:15:17,991 --> 01:15:20,385
Only guy whose sideburns
I like better than mine.

2081
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:23,301
Hey, game recognize game.

2082
01:15:23,388 --> 01:15:25,346
It really was almost
the perfect crime.

2083
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:27,479
But... but really...
Was it really the...

2084
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:28,915
It was the perfect crime.

2085
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:30,458
It was the perfect...
I mean, it was pretty...

2086
01:15:30,482 --> 01:15:32,615
They made one mistake.

2087
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:36,619
The Jews had no better
friend than Mr. Kenny Rogers.

2088
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:38,664
And when you mess
with Kenny Rogers,

2089
01:15:38,751 --> 01:15:41,798
you mess with
the entire state of Israel.

2090
01:15:41,885 --> 01:15:45,628
Mr. Kenny Rogers negotiated
a secret treaty

2091
01:15:45,715 --> 01:15:48,326
between Menachem Begin...
Mmhmm.

2092
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:50,328
- And Yasser Arafat.
- Wow.

2093
01:15:52,156 --> 01:15:53,307
Someone's got to get
that on his Wikipedia,

2094
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:54,898
'cause that's huge.

2095
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:56,615
We're going to take
these guys to the tank,

2096
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:58,641
ask them some questions,
shoot them in the head.

2097
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:00,251
Uh... uh...

2098
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:04,821
I think in the spirit of
the sixth night of Hanukkah...

2099
01:16:04,908 --> 01:16:06,779
we'll just book them, huh?

2100
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:08,564
You... you're... you're working,

2101
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:10,391
uh, Jewish guilt onto me, now.

2102
01:16:11,741 --> 01:16:13,351
We let them... we let them live.

2103
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:15,919
Hey, doesn't mean you can't
hook some jumper cables up

2104
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:17,268
to their nipples, huh?

2105
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:18,356
Hey, were you in Mossad?

2106
01:16:18,443 --> 01:16:19,879
Because this is great idea.

2107
01:16:19,966 --> 01:16:21,925
Or what about stick
some stuff up their butts?

2108
01:16:22,012 --> 01:16:23,666
Best sixth night of Hanukkah...

2109
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:24,841
- Ever.
- Ever?

2110
01:16:24,928 --> 01:16:26,625
- That we've ever had.
- I guess.

2111
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:29,454
Well, I think Mr. Richnickie
is going to be still a bummer.

2112
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:30,910
But let's get it back
to him, shall we?

2113
01:16:30,934 --> 01:16:31,978
He loves that nugget.

2114
01:16:32,065 --> 01:16:33,545
He might have killed himself.

2115
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:35,131
I... I... in a weird way,
I was kind of hoping

2116
01:16:35,155 --> 01:16:36,461
that was the outcome.

Why are you crying, Jim Dangle?

2127
01:17:25,205 --> 01:17:27,077
Terry told me that
every time a bell rings,

2128
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:29,209
he's giving somebody a tug job.

2129
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:30,471
And that made me very sad.

2130
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:31,777
Aww.

2131
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:35,520
No, Jim Dangle.

2132
01:17:35,607 --> 01:17:37,870
I said every time a bell rings,

2133
01:17:37,957 --> 01:17:40,612
nobody should pee on me.

2134
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,788
I hope that nobody pees

2135
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,703
on all of us this Christmas.

2136
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:45,791
Oh, look, you guys.

2137
01:17:45,878 --> 01:17:46,923
Our dove.

2138
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:48,968
It's still alive.
Yay.

2139
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:50,230
I'll get it.

2140
01:17:50,317 --> 01:17:51,623

2145
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:12,470
We did a search,
and it turns out

2146
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:14,124
that a 50-pound silver nugget

2147
01:18:14,211 --> 01:18:17,518
is worth $14,621.

2148
01:18:17,605 --> 01:18:19,085
Still a lot of money.

2149
01:18:19,172 --> 01:18:20,957
That's, like, a good used car.
