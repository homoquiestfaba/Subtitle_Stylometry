00:20:01,232 --> 00:20:03,068
- There's no signal down here.
- Right.

343
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:07,571
Wait till you see this.

344
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,951
- Who gave you this?
- YVONNE: Can't say.

345
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,421
There's no info
saying who sent it.

346
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:27,125
This could have been
written by anyone.

347
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:30,928
- That's who wrote it.
- Well.

348
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,662
Frank Koza.

349
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:36,565
- Who the fuck is Frank Koza?
- NSA.

350
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,867
And this I know
because the letters NSA

351
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,970
have been written on the back
with a leaky ballpoint.

352
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:43,939
My source says
the header wasn't printed

353
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:46,678
to protect the recipients
at GCHQ.

354
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,711
When did you get it?

355
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,114
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks?

356
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,515
I gave it to <i>The Mirror</i> first.
Sorry.

357
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,785
Jesus. Why didn't
they run it?

358
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,020
- They thought it was fake.
- No shit.

359
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,056
- Is your source NSA?
- No. A friend of the recipient.

360
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:03,459
- A good friend.
- A friend of a friend?

361
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:06,429
A good friend
of a trusted friend.

362
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,696
I'm sure it's real.

363
00:21:07,698 --> 00:21:09,365
Then why don't you
write the story?

364

Hello?

388
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,402
- You rang the NSA Press Office?
- Yeah.

389
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,536
They have a press office.

390
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,971
I thought that was
a good place to start.

391
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,205
But you didn't
tell them anything?

392
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,607
No, Peter.
I just asked for Frank Koza.

393
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,076
Because if this is real,
you could go to jail

394
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:29,978
just for having it
in your possession.

395
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,814
MARTIN: I'm not letting this go.
It's too good a story.

396
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,215
PETER: I agree,
but if you get it wrong

397
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,417
it will sink you,
it will sink the paper.

398
00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:37,586
I'd like to get a credible
intelligence expert

399
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,321
to offer a view
on the language.

400
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,289
- Yeah.
- And I thought you could run it by

401
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,793
your MI6 contact?

402
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,761
- I don't have a MI6 contact.
- Sorry.

00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,831

404
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:49,964
Sure.

405
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:51,799
I'll take it
to Admiral Wilkinson.

406
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,634
Be careful.
Before we risk

407
00:22:53,636 --> 00:22:55,470
a D-notice
against publication

408
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:59,275
I'd actually like confirmation
that Frank Koza exists.

409
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,742
Do you think
it's authentic?

410
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:02,478
Well, certainly
the words he used,

411
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,180
"TOPI," for example,

412
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,981
few outside
of the security apparatus

413
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:07,249
would know
what that means.

414
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:08,384
What does it mean?

415
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,452
Target of
primary interest.

416
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:13,922
And this term,
"QRC surge effort,"

417
00:23:13,924 --> 00:23:15,457
that's NSA military speak

418
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,228
for significant intensification
of surveillance operations.

419
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,196
And this, where they ask
for "valuable information

420
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:26,301
"from accesses
in your product lines..."

421
00:23:26,303 --> 00:23:29,438
...product lines
are intelligence sources.

422
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,739
So it's been
written by someone

423
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,374
who's familiar
with security speak

424
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,409
but that doesn't mean
it's definitely NSA.

425
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:36,979
True, but there are no
obvious amateur mistakes.

426
00:23:36,981 --> 00:23:39,751
- Have you heard of Frank Koza?
- No.

to confirm that he exists...

I couldn't help you do that.

429
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,090
Yeah, but if we wanted
to confirm that he...

430
00:23:49,092 --> 00:23:51,862

wouldn't ever trust me again.

Peter, you need to tell Roger

This new BBC poll,
it says that less than one in ten people

think it's right to attack
Iraq without a UN resolution.

Oh, congratulations.

That's more
than most MP's ever done.

483
00:25:55,286 --> 00:25:58,185
- Well, shit, that's depressing.
- Mmm-hmm. It is.

484
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:00,422
Look, there are a few
pre-98 chemical weapons

485
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:02,391
we have yet to be accounted
for but inspectors said

486
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,058
they found absolutely
no evidence

487
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,394
of an active chemical
or biological program.

488
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:07,462
Correct.

489
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,529
And yet Colin Powell presented

490
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:10,164
clear evidence of mobile labs.

491
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,602
His evidence may be based
on poor human intel

492
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:15,237
from an Iraqi dissident.

493
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,105
Really?

494
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,205
The dissident
isn't our product

495
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:19,076
and should not be seen
as our product.

496
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,213
Whose product is he then?

497
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:27,415
Look, Peter,
I didn't say this,

498
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:29,951
but there is concern
in certain quarters

499
00:26:29,953 --> 00:26:33,122
that intelligence
may be being manipulated

500
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,024
to take this country to war.

501
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,959
So why don't you tell
your journalists

502
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,161
to stop being so bloody loyal
to Downing Street

503
00:26:39,163 --> 00:26:41,098
and start doing their job?

504
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,068
Okay.

505
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,705
Okay, what if I had
evidence that the NSA

506
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:53,742
requested GCHQ to help
monitor private communications

507
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:56,076
of the UN Security Council
delegates?

508
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:57,880
- To what end?
- Bluntly?

509
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,082
To blackmail them
into voting for war.

510
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,717
I'm not with GCHQ.

511
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:03,551
You're MI6,
you're on the same team.

512
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:04,618
How did you
hear about this?

513
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,421
A UN resolution for war

514
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,891
would cover everyone's arse,
wouldn't it?

515
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,792
No more asking your team
to sex up evidence of WMDs

516
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:14,930
or the back-dodgy claims that
Britain was about to be attacked

517
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:16,965
by Iraq within 45 minutes.

518
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:19,067
And no chance of anyone
being charged with a war crime

519
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:21,004
if it all goes tits up.

520
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:23,838
What are you
asking me, Peter?

521
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,909
I'm asking
if you can confirm

522
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,546
whether the NSA
instructed GCHQ

523
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:33,617
to assist in spying on
Security Council delegates?

524
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,318
You know I can't
answer that.

525
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,954
To do so would put me in breach
of the Official Secrets Act.

526
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:42,459
To deny it would not.

527
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:48,266
Well, I can neither confirm
nor deny.

528
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,471
Okay.

529
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:55,740
Let's play.

530
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,277
- Change ends, idiot.
- Yes.

531
00:28:01,044 --> 00:28:02,611
Your serve.

532
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:05,614
ED: So the head of the CIA
tells Bush it's a slam dunk

533
00:28:05,616 --> 00:28:08,782
that Saddam has weapons
of mass destruction.

534
00:28:08,784 --> 00:28:10,685
- A slam dunk.
- Yes.

535
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,654
- And that's not true?
- No.

536
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:15,289
Meaning Saddam definitely
does not have weapons

537
00:28:15,291 --> 00:28:17,459
of mass destruction
or he may not.

538
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:21,028
Meaning the intelligence
is sketchy at best

539
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,798
and manufactured at worst.

540
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,999
And Tenet knows that?

541
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,702
I've no doubt he knows that.

542
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:29,871
I was with
the agency 24 years.

543
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:33,541
I can tell you, folks over there
are really angry about this.

544
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:35,277
Why?

545
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,510
Why?

546
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,513
Because the majority
of the analysts do not believe

547
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:41,618
it's a slam dunk,
but no one wants to hear that.

548
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,352
Not even the press.

549
00:28:44,354 --> 00:28:47,088
- Sorry, Mel.
- I'm sorry.

550
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,658
I'm just mad as hell.

551
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,993
Listen, I wanted
to talk to you today

552
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:55,897
because I think I might finally
be onto something that...

553
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,968
...that really support what
you've been saying for months.

554
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,440
I need to talk to a man
called Frank Koza.

555
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,375
He's NSA.

556
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:09,280
Head of Regional Targets.

557
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:12,817
You know him?

558
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,085
I'm sorry, Ed.

559
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:19,589
I can't give out
that kind of information.

560
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,412
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry.

561
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,880
- I didn't wanna call.
- How long have you been here?

562
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:46,548
We're not supposed
to be meeting.

563
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,482
I know, I've just...

564
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:51,019
I've been following the news
and I haven't seen

565
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:52,688
or heard anything
for three weeks.

566
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,155
Okay, well,
I've given it to my contact

567
00:29:54,157 --> 00:29:55,857
and apparently,
she's having a very hard time

568
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:58,463
getting the papers to
believe that it's not a fake.

569
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,233
Oh, uh...

570
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:05,800
Well, maybe that's okay.

571
00:30:05,802 --> 00:30:07,001
You know, I...

572
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:08,170
Look, I mean,
all of the polls said

573
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,471
everyone's against
the war, anyway

574
00:30:09,473 --> 00:30:11,874
and I, and I've
just been thinking...

575
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,109
Look, I think
that I acted too rashly

576
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:16,444
on impulse.
I didn't think...

577
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:18,113
Jesus, Katharine,
is it a fake?

578
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,615
Of course it's not a fake.
It's real.

579
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,083
Well, then just go home!

580
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,419
Okay, don't talk about this
to anyone, ever!

581
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:25,490
Just...

582
00:30:27,424 --> 00:30:30,261
- Sorry.
- It's out of our hands now.

583
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,330
Sorry.

584
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:38,400
The truth is,
the whole document could be a fake.

585
00:30:38,402 --> 00:30:41,135
But we're satisfied
the language used is real.

586
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,772
- It's fascinating.
- Yeah.

587
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:47,942
Is this document actually
in your possession?

588
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:50,211
Well, if it were, I'd be in
breach of the Official Secrets Act

589
00:30:50,213 --> 00:30:51,645
wouldn't I?

590
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:53,314
(BOTH LAUGH)

591
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:55,049
So based on what might be
in this document...

592
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,652
- That you don't have.
- That I don't yet have.

593
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:58,319
But that you want
to print in your paper.

594
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:00,654
If you don't issue a
D-notice against publication.

595
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,156
Well, which I will
most certainly do

596
00:31:02,158 --> 00:31:04,392
if I think the publication
might in any way

597
00:31:04,394 --> 00:31:06,294
endanger the lives
of British people

598
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:08,096
or British forces.

599
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:09,897
- Understood.
- Good.

600
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:11,700
(CHUCKLES)

601
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:12,703
Go on.

602
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,003
Would you say
it were likely real

603
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:18,039
or a forgery?

604
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,241
What do you think?

605
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:22,176
I think it could be a fake

606
00:31:22,178 --> 00:31:24,548
put out
by the anti-war movement...

607
00:31:25,682 --> 00:31:28,584
...or by a foreign agency
to embarrass the US.

608
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:31,720
- Which agency?
- The Russians.

609
00:31:31,722 --> 00:31:33,355
I mean, the French
oppose the war, too,

610
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:34,823
but I don't think
they'd do this.

611
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:37,491
I think you might be
overthinking it as usual, Martin.

612
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:40,530
- Meaning?
- You tell me.

613
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:44,868
Well, meaning it could be
exactly what it says it is.

614
00:31:48,205 --> 00:31:50,505
You know, Martin,
I believe that all information

615
00:31:50,507 --> 00:31:53,978
collected in the name of the
public should be made public.

616
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:58,113
The only question is, when.

617
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:02,151
But in this case,
I don't have the luxury of time, Admiral.

618
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,555
Powell just made
a very strong case for war.

619
00:32:05,255 --> 00:32:06,656
Yes, I see.

620
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,561
I have also always believed

621
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:16,431
that censorship
when called for

622
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:20,605
should be based
on security issues alone...

623
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:23,570
...not on whether
a news report

624
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:25,508
might embarrass
a government.

625
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,348

publishing those cost people their jobs.

MI6 had funded an attempted
assassination on Gaddafi.

that the US government,

862

868
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,808
Yes, actually, I did.

- Are you anti-war, Katharine?

875

No.

876
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,765
Uh, I think
sometimes war is necessary.

877
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:49,002
I see you lived in Taiwan
as a child?

878
00:46:49,004 --> 00:46:51,205
- Yes.
- How long did you live there?

879
00:46:51,207 --> 00:46:53,040
We moved over

880

I came back
to do my A-levels.

881
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:56,678
So for most
of your childhood then?

882
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,681
Yes.

No, not particularly.

885

But were you sent away

886
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:05,386

school in Taiwan?

887
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:06,419
Yes.

of right and wrong, did it,

890

No.

895
00:47:19,234 --> 00:47:20,700
- But you read it?
- Yes.

896
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:23,270
I mean, it was sent to me,
so I read it.

897
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:25,908
What were your immediate
thoughts after you read it?

898
00:47:27,142 --> 00:47:28,709
Nothing much.
It didn't really bother me.

899
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,847

- No.

1036

- The Foreign Office.

1038

The Ministry of Defense.

1039

for the British Government.

1040

protect the British people.

1045

1049
00:57:51,133 --> 00:57:51,999
Yes.

1050
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,066
You gather information

1051
00:57:53,068 --> 00:57:54,834
from people's phones
and computers

1052
00:57:54,836 --> 00:57:56,837
and you feed that
to your clients.

1053
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:00,506
- Yes.
- You eavesdrop on private conversations.

1054
00:58:00,508 --> 00:58:02,676

- Yes.

1073
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:54,326

- He's a Muslim.

00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:08,140

has done to the Kurdish people,

1079
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:12,379

leak a memo

01:05:48,877 --> 01:05:51,877
- No.
- And you've never met Martin Bright?

1206
01:05:51,879 --> 01:05:52,946
No.

1207
01:05:52,948 --> 01:05:53,812
Martin called me
last week.

1208
01:05:53,814 --> 01:05:55,515
He said he didn't know
who you were,

1209
01:05:55,517 --> 01:05:58,919
but he wanted us to be aware
that you might need our help.

1210
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,854
Well, that was
very kind of him.

1211
01:06:00,856 --> 01:06:03,256
He said he got the memo
from someone he knew

1212
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:05,223
but he wouldn't say who.

1213
01:06:05,225 --> 01:06:08,263
Do you want to tell us
who you gave it to?

1214
01:06:11,098 --> 01:06:13,200
Look,

1215
01:06:13,202 --> 01:06:17,037
if you don't mind,
I would prefer not to say.

1216
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:18,640
I promised I wouldn't.

1217
01:06:19,240 --> 01:06:21,375
Okay.

1218
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:24,310
When you met Yasar, he had
already applied for asylum.

1219
01:06:24,312 --> 01:06:26,645
- Yes.
- Which was denied.

1220
01:06:26,647 --> 01:06:30,415
Yes, uh, they said that there
wasn't a significant enough risk

1221
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:32,386
of persecution
if he went back.

1222
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:34,087
And that's when
you married him?

1223
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:36,189
- Yes.
- And did he pay you?

1224
01:06:36,191 --> 01:06:37,390
Absolutely not.

1225
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:38,524
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to upset you.

1226
01:06:38,526 --> 01:06:40,359
It's just that
your husband is Muslim

1227
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:42,328
and the prosecution
will be looking for motive.

1228
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:45,531
My motive was to stop a war

1229
01:06:45,533 --> 01:06:49,968
and save lives. I failed.

1230
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:52,939
All I've managed to do is put
my husband's future at risk.

1231
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:54,707
BEN: And your own.

1232
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:56,375
In fact,
by leaking information

1233
01:06:56,377 --> 01:06:58,145
to try and stop a war,
I'd argue

1234
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:00,312
that you chose loyalty
to your country

1235
01:07:00,314 --> 01:07:04,618
over loyalty to your government,
your marriage and yourself.

1236
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,489
You had nothing to gain
and everything to lose.

1237
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:11,460
I think that speaks
rather highly of you.

1238
01:07:12,426 --> 01:07:15,595
SHAMI: He's trying
to give you a compliment.

1239
01:07:15,597 --> 01:07:16,562
I see.

1240
01:07:16,564 --> 01:07:18,631
JAMES: Part of our job
is to try and anticipate

1241
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:21,834
what the prosecution's
going to throw at you.

1242
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:24,638
Some of the people we meet
are looking for attention,

1243
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,939
a way to elevate
their humdrum lives.

1244
01:07:26,941 --> 01:07:29,777
- Well, I'm not.
- No, I don't think you are.

1245
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,647
Sorry.

1246
01:07:34,649 --> 01:07:36,917
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

1247
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,785
We're here to help.

1248
01:07:38,787 --> 01:07:39,821
(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

1249
01:07:41,589 --> 01:07:43,189
And we don't have duress.

1250
01:07:43,191 --> 01:07:47,026
She's adamant no outside
agency put any pressure on her.

1251
01:07:47,028 --> 01:07:48,761
Public interest?

1252
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:51,263
The public has a right to know
when their government is lying.

1253
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:53,232
We cite
the Falklands case

1254
01:07:53,234 --> 01:07:54,901
when Thatcher lied
about why she ordered

1255
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:56,569
the sinking
of that Argentinian ship.

1256
01:07:56,571 --> 01:07:57,870
- <i>Belgrano.</i>
- Yeah.

1257
01:07:57,872 --> 01:08:00,372
- Who was the whistleblower?
- Clive Ponting.

1258
01:08:00,374 --> 01:08:01,674
The jury acquitted him,
didn't they?

1259
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:02,942
Yes, and immediately
afterwards,

1260
01:08:02,944 --> 01:08:04,910
Thatcher had the Official
Secrets Act amended

1261
01:08:04,912 --> 01:08:06,745
to avoid being caught
in a lie in the future.

1262
01:08:06,747 --> 01:08:09,015
So since '89,
the public interest is

1263
01:08:09,017 --> 01:08:11,919
effectively whatever the
government says that it is.

1264
01:08:12,953 --> 01:08:14,620
We've got nothing.

1265
01:08:14,622 --> 01:08:16,523
I have to
think about it.

1266
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:18,825
Sorry, I have to go.

1267
01:08:18,827 --> 01:08:21,029
I promised Anne
a weekend away.

1268
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:25,264
If they charge her,
we might have to plead guilty

1269
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:26,765
and ask for
a reduced sentence.

1270
01:08:26,767 --> 01:08:29,035
But she's young
and principled.

1271
01:08:29,037 --> 01:08:31,636
A judge might even think that
what she did was morally right.

1272
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:34,042
Or crucify her
as a traitor.

1273
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,111
Bye.

1274
01:09:04,672 --> 01:09:07,674
- You sure he was following you?
- He was staring at me.

1275
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:08,741
Sometimes men stare...

1276
01:09:08,743 --> 01:09:09,843
Yeah, it wasn't
that kind of a stare.

1277
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,309
What kind
of a stare was it?

1278
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:14,412
Yas, please,
I'm scared. Okay?

1279
01:09:14,414 --> 01:09:15,751
I'm scared.

1280
01:09:17,485 --> 01:09:19,786
You know, for years,
I've tried to be legal here.

1281
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:21,353
- I know.
- Then why'd you do it?

1282
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:23,590
These arseholes got
their war, anyway.

1283
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,425
Saddam's over.
And you know what?

1284
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,560
- I'm glad he's over!
- War is not over.

1285
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:29,094
Ousting Saddam
is just the beginning.

1286
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:31,764
- What do you know about war?
- I work at GCHQ.

1287
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,933
All you do is listen
to people talking!

1288
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,702
You've never seen war!
You've never smelled it!

1289
01:09:36,704 --> 01:09:37,902
Never even
come close to it!

1290
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:40,240
Yas, I understand
why you are angry.

1291
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:42,474
It is my fault
and I'm sorry.

1292
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:44,376
I am so sorry.

1293
01:09:44,378 --> 01:09:49,349
But I watched Blair
with his smug smile

1294
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:52,117
and his sterile speeches
that tell us nothing

1295
01:09:52,119 --> 01:09:56,154
of what it must feel like to
be a child in Iraq right now.

1296
01:09:56,156 --> 01:09:58,791
I know I'm not sorry
that I tried to stop him.

1297
01:09:58,793 --> 01:09:59,928
I'm not.

1298
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:03,129
I'm only sorry
that I failed.

1299
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:04,732
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1300
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:14,139
Thank you
for inviting us in.

1301
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:15,407
What is it
you came to say?

1302
01:10:15,409 --> 01:10:19,178
Well, there's been
a development.

1303
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,848
- Am I going to be charged?
- That I don't know.

1304
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:23,685
Then why
are you here?

1305
01:10:24,985 --> 01:10:27,419
I gather you went to see
a lawyer today.

1306
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:28,755
- Did you follow me?
- No.

1307
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:29,889
Because somebody did.

1308
01:10:29,891 --> 01:10:31,657
Well, you must know
that after what you did,

1309
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:33,492
GCHQ is concerned.

1310
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:36,062
I have a right
to legal advice.

1311
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:39,965
TINTIN: Unfortunately,
it's not as simple as that.

1312
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:42,734
When you signed on
to work for GCHQ,

1313
01:10:42,736 --> 01:10:45,737
you agreed to be bound
by the Official Secrets Act

1314
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:47,840
for the rest of your life.

1315
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:49,809
I know what I signed,
detective.

1316
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:54,546
Mm, then you know
that it says here

1317
01:10:54,548 --> 01:10:56,948
in Section 1-1

1318
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,518
that "a person is
guilty of an offense

1319
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,855
"if he or she

1320
01:11:02,857 --> 01:11:04,956
"discloses any information

1321
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:08,760
"relating to security
or intelligence."

1322
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:12,398
This means that you cannot
discuss anything

1323
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,402
with anyone outside of GCHQ

1324
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:18,006
relating to
the document you leaked.

1325
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,941
Are you saying
I can't talk to a lawyer?

1326
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,977
Oh, you have the right
to talk to a lawyer.

1327
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,911
It's just that
you cannot discuss

1328
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:29,448
anything to do with
your work at GCHQ,

1329
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,416
or the contents
of the memo you leaked,

1330
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,620
or how it came
into your possession

1331
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,222
or who wrote it.

1332
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:39,625
All of this information
is top secret.

1333
01:11:39,627 --> 01:11:42,728
So disclosing it
to anyone outside of GCHQ,

1334
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:44,863
even a lawyer,

1335
01:11:44,865 --> 01:11:48,667
would be a further violation
of the Official Secrets Act,

1336
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:51,970
which could result
in further prosecution

1337
01:11:51,972 --> 01:11:55,077
and a much longer
prison sentence.

1338
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:00,649
We just wanted
you to be aware of that.

1339
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:06,818
So if I may not talk to a
lawyer, who may I talk to?

1340
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,587
You should talk to
your superiors at GCHQ.

1341
01:12:09,589 --> 01:12:13,158
- Are you fucking joking?
- Yas, please. Please.

1342
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,894
We should hear what
the detectives have to say.

1343
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,966
They're just
doing their job.

1344
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:25,871
Simply put, if you wish
to tell anything to a lawyer

1345
01:12:25,873 --> 01:12:28,744
or the press or anyone else...

1346
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:32,847
...you first need to
clear it with GCHQ.

1347
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:37,852
Detective...

1348
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:41,853
I leaked only one memo.

1349
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:43,188
I had good reason to do so

1350
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,492
and I intend to make
those reasons public

1351
01:12:46,494 --> 01:12:48,863
if I am charged.

1352
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:52,197
I will not talk
to my lawyers again

1353
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:54,669
unless I am charged.

1354
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:58,106
Tell that to GCHQ.

1355
01:13:03,845 --> 01:13:05,344
Are you grilling
or smoking that fish?

1356
01:13:05,346 --> 01:13:08,447
I am smoking.
I've soaked the wood chips in water.

1357
01:13:08,449 --> 01:13:09,549
I've got charcoal.

1358
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,518
I'm... I'm trying
something new.

1359
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,188
- Hi.
- Ken?

1360
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:16,621
- Hi.
- Hi, Ken.

1361
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:19,591
- Guess you're down here for the weekend.
- Yes. Just for the night.

1362
01:13:19,593 --> 01:13:21,126
Yeah, me too.
It's been a while.

1363
01:13:21,128 --> 01:13:23,728
Mm-hmm. Would you, uh...
Do you want a drink?

1364
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:26,532
Uh, no, thanks.
Sally's cooking dinner.

1365
01:13:26,534 --> 01:13:28,968
- Hello, Anne.
- Hi.

1366
01:13:28,970 --> 01:13:32,237
- I'm so sorry to intrude.
- Oh, not at all.

1367
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,005
How's the new job?

1368
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:37,910
Well, it's, um, eye-opening.

1369
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:41,647
In fact, I wondered
if I might ask Ben's opinion

1370
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:45,251
about a new case that my office
has been asked to prosecute.

1371
01:13:45,253 --> 01:13:48,688
It won't take a minute.
Would you mind?

1372
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,689
How do you know
that I met her?

1373
01:13:50,691 --> 01:13:53,459

1374
01:13:53,461 --> 01:13:54,693
Mm-hmm.

1375

a domestic embarrassment.

Oh, come on, Ben,
it's not funny.

1379
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:05,770

deliberate act of betrayal.

I think she wants to be seen
as some sort of cause celebre.

1383

But she swore allegiance
to the intelligence services

1384

don't get to pick and choose

1385

you'll follow.

1386
01:14:21,922 --> 01:14:24,290
Following orders is not
a defense to a war crime.

Oh, come on, she's not selling
state secrets to Moscow.

1390
01:14:34,702 --> 01:14:36,969

an illegal attempt

1391
01:14:36,971 --> 01:14:39,304
to secure
a UN resolution for war

1392
01:14:39,306 --> 01:14:41,072

given Blair perfect cover

1393
01:14:41,074 --> 01:14:42,640
for the bloody mess
that we're in now.

1394
01:14:42,642 --> 01:14:44,810
No, she should have
kept her mouth shut

1395
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:47,045
or complained
to her superiors.

1396
01:14:47,047 --> 01:14:48,613
Now I've got
a real problem with people

1397
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:50,715

from some lowly position

1398

they can possibly see
the big picture.

1399
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,185
So then you would
never question authority

1400
01:14:54,187 --> 01:14:55,955

it was breaking the law.

1401
01:14:55,957 --> 01:14:58,858

for being angry with her.

01:22:34,114 --> 01:22:35,450
(KNOCKS)

1540
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:36,985
Hello?

1541
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:41,756
(PHONE RINGING)

1542
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:46,261
Yeah?

1543
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:48,760
KATHARINE: James, James, um,

1544
01:22:48,762 --> 01:22:51,196
I don't know if I'm
even at the right place.

1545
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:53,232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know,
but it's 4:00 a.m.

1546
01:22:53,234 --> 01:22:55,700
There's nobody to talk to.

1547
01:22:55,702 --> 01:22:58,439
Wait, wait.
Someone's coming. Wait.

1548
01:23:00,074 --> 01:23:01,576
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1549
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:05,477
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1550
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:06,644
- It's all right.
- You okay?

1551
01:23:06,646 --> 01:23:07,712
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

1552
01:23:07,714 --> 01:23:09,449
- You're okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1553
01:23:16,757 --> 01:23:18,223
If they try and pull
anything like that again,

1554
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:19,323
then I want
to go public.

1555
01:23:19,325 --> 01:23:20,858
- Not a good idea.
- Why not?

1556
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:23,260
Because people are fickle.
Many will hate you.

1557
01:23:23,262 --> 01:23:25,096
Your personal lives
will be picked apart,

1558
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:26,697
your marriage
will be interrogated.

1559
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:28,567
In fact, we think
it will be best

1560
01:23:28,569 --> 01:23:31,502
if Yasar was kept
well out of this.

1561
01:23:31,504 --> 01:23:34,007
You should probably
not attend the trial.

1562
01:23:35,441 --> 01:23:38,276
- I understand.
- What? No.

1563
01:23:38,278 --> 01:23:40,444
<i>Janum,</i> we both know
the jury will prefer

1564
01:23:40,446 --> 01:23:42,179
an English girl without
an immigrant husband.

1565
01:23:42,181 --> 01:23:43,514
You know what?
That is ridiculous.

1566
01:23:43,516 --> 01:23:45,951
We are married and we have
nothing to be ashamed of.

1567
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,719
The shame is on them, not you.

1568
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:51,624
You don't need to risk
your freedom to prove it.

1569
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:54,425
We should discuss
how you'll plead.

1570
01:23:54,427 --> 01:23:55,626
Not guilty.

1571
01:23:55,628 --> 01:23:57,729
SHAMI: But you understand
you confessed.

1572
01:23:57,731 --> 01:24:01,200
I confessed that I leaked a memo
in order to try and save lives.

1573
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:05,804
And we will use that argument
to ask for a reduced sentence.

1574
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:08,773
If you do plead guilty,
there will be no jury.

1575
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:11,143
You could be out of jail
in less than six months.

1576
01:24:11,145 --> 01:24:12,777
Given how badly
the war is going,

1577
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:15,179
we think a judge
is likely to be sympathetic.

1578
01:24:15,181 --> 01:24:17,515
But I'd have
a criminal record.

1579
01:24:17,517 --> 01:24:18,849
JAMES: That is true.

1580
01:24:18,851 --> 01:24:21,487
Which I would carry with me
for the rest of my life

1581
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:23,087
into every job interview,

1582
01:24:23,089 --> 01:24:24,255
every application for credit.

1583
01:24:24,257 --> 01:24:26,157
- Yes.
- And I'm sorry.

1584
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,893
We would be conceding

1585
01:24:28,895 --> 01:24:32,163
that no one in Intelligence can
ever tell the British people

1586
01:24:32,165 --> 01:24:33,866
when their government
is lying.

1587
01:24:33,868 --> 01:24:35,334
JAMES: Not when
the lies are protected

1588
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,702
by the
Official Secrets Act, no.

1589
01:24:37,704 --> 01:24:39,036
I'm sorry.
This is all a charade.

1590
01:24:39,038 --> 01:24:40,872
I mean, if you're saying
that I have to plead guilty

1591
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:43,642
because the act allows
absolutely no defense whatsoever,

1592
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:46,045
then the very idea
of a fair trial is a joke.

1593
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:47,779
I'm sorry,
Katharine,

1594
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:51,783
but the best we can do is
ask a judge for leniency.

1595
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:54,551
Post <i>Belgrano,</i> there
really is no defense

1596
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:56,087
to a breach of
the Official Secrets Act...

1597
01:24:56,089 --> 01:24:57,992
Except perhaps one.

1598
01:24:58,959 --> 01:25:00,593
Katharine said it herself.

1599
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,295
She leaked the memo
to try to save lives.

1600
01:25:03,297 --> 01:25:04,728
But she still
broke the law.

1601
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:07,032
Yes, but there are circumstances
where you can break the law.

1602
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:09,835
It's only in situations
of absolute necessity...

1603
01:25:09,837 --> 01:25:12,304
- Necessity. Exactly.
- Ben, you're reaching.

1604
01:25:12,306 --> 01:25:15,608
Am I? What are the requirements
for a defense of necessity?

1605
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,643
Imminent threat to your life
or the lives of others.

1606
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:20,246
Yeah, and no other reasonable
way to prevent loss of life.

1607
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,813
Yes, right, well,
the invasion posed

1608
01:25:21,815 --> 01:25:23,915
an imminent threat
to thousands of lives.

1609
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:25,850
Katharine has no right
to try and prevent a war

1610
01:25:25,852 --> 01:25:27,118
authorized by
the Attorney General.

1611
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:30,488
- Unless the war is illegal.
- SHAMI AND JAMES: What?

1612
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:33,724
- (CHUCKLES)
- Wait, wait, so now we're going to put the war on trial?

1613
01:25:33,726 --> 01:25:34,893
BEN: Yes.

1614
01:25:34,895 --> 01:25:39,363
I believe that Katharine Gun
tried to stop an illegal war.

1615
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:41,066
What she did was necessary

1616
01:25:41,068 --> 01:25:44,435
to try to save thousands of
British-American and Iraqi lives.

1617
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:47,538
And Goldsmith
specifically stated

1618
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,040
that the invasion was legal.

1619
01:25:49,042 --> 01:25:51,910
He said so only three days
before the invasion.

1620
01:25:51,912 --> 01:25:53,312
What was his position
before that?

1621
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:56,081
What was his advice at the
time Katharine leaked the memo?

1622
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:57,948
- Well, we have no idea.
- Well, I'd like to find out.

1623
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:59,584
Because Blair spent
a lot of energy

1624
01:25:59,586 --> 01:26:02,187
trying to secure
a new UN resolution.

1625
01:26:02,189 --> 01:26:03,421
I suppose.

1626
01:26:03,423 --> 01:26:05,590
When Lord Goldsmith
finally said

1627
01:26:05,592 --> 01:26:09,161
the war was legal,
his deputy legal advisor resigned.

1628
01:26:09,163 --> 01:26:10,961
Yes, Elizabeth Wilmshurst.
Yeah, that's right.

1629
01:26:10,963 --> 01:26:12,496
- She resigned. Yes, yes.
- SHAMI: But she didn't say why.

1630
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:14,032
KATHARINE: She couldn't.

1631
01:26:14,034 --> 01:26:16,001
If she did, she'd be charged
under the Official Secrets Act.

1632
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:18,202
So I need to get a meeting
with Elizabeth Wilmshurst.

1633
01:26:18,204 --> 01:26:20,171
- She's not gonna go public.
- BEN: She doesn't have to.

1634
01:26:20,173 --> 01:26:21,406
All we need is a hint

1635
01:26:21,408 --> 01:26:24,242
that Goldsmith changed his mind
about the legality of the war.

1636
01:26:24,244 --> 01:26:28,179
I'm sorry, Ben. There are two
ways they could justify war.

1637
01:26:28,181 --> 01:26:30,447
- We've only addressed one.
- So what am I missing?

1638
01:26:30,449 --> 01:26:31,916
- Self-defense.
- Oh, come on.

1639
01:26:31,918 --> 01:26:33,852
Does anyone honestly believe
that this country

1640
01:26:33,854 --> 01:26:35,621
was about to be attacked
by Iraq?

1641
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:37,923
I do agree, but that's why
they trotted out Powell.

1642
01:26:37,925 --> 01:26:40,157
- To make the case for WMDs.
- Oh.

1643
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:41,960
If it's true that Iraq has
weapons of mass destruction

1644
01:26:41,962 --> 01:26:44,595
that pose an imminent threat
to this country,

1645
01:26:44,597 --> 01:26:48,567
the war is legal
without a UN resolution.

1646
01:26:48,569 --> 01:26:49,901
How many people
actually believe

1647
01:26:49,903 --> 01:26:51,803
Iraq still has weapons
of mass destruction?

1648
01:26:51,805 --> 01:26:53,272
SHAMI: Well,
they're still looking.

1649
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:56,711
If we go down this route,
we better pray none are found.

1650
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,649
BEN: I'm gonna get
Elizabeth Wilmshurst's number.

1651
01:27:04,185 --> 01:27:06,885
You've put me
in a rather awkward position.

1652
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:10,955
I'm sorry, but thank you
for seeing me.

1653
01:27:10,957 --> 01:27:14,024
I think what she did
took great courage.

1654
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:17,862
And she was naive,
of course, but brave.

1655
01:27:17,864 --> 01:27:20,935
And you were
brave enough to resign.

1656
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:26,638
But not to
speak out in public.

1657
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,041
If I had, I might have caused
more of a brouhaha.

1658
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:31,910
Sparked a proper debate.

1659
01:27:31,912 --> 01:27:36,083
Can I ask you, uh,
how did you resign?

1660
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:41,756
I wrote a letter.

1661
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:46,191
And in that letter,
did you give a reason

1662
01:27:46,193 --> 01:27:48,225
for your resignation?

1663
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:51,563
I restated my position on
the legality of going to war.

1664
01:27:51,565 --> 01:27:53,430
Which was?

1665
01:27:53,432 --> 01:27:55,800
That it would
not be lawful to use force

1666
01:27:55,802 --> 01:27:59,170
without a new
Security Council resolution.

1667
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:03,910
Um, did Goldsmith initially
support your view?

1668
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,879
He did.

1669
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,113
He told Blair that
if military action were taken,

1670
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:11,282
he expected
the government to be accused

1671
01:28:11,284 --> 01:28:13,820
of acting unlawfully.

1672
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:17,992
And was that
a written opinion?

1673
01:28:19,092 --> 01:28:21,228
It was a detailed
advisory document.

1674
01:28:23,029 --> 01:28:26,363
Right, so then would that
have been his position

1675
01:28:26,365 --> 01:28:29,501
at the time that Katharine Gun
printed the Koza memo

1676
01:28:29,503 --> 01:28:31,105
on February 3?

1677
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:34,742
Yes.

1678
01:28:36,976 --> 01:28:39,046
And then
he went to Washington.

1679
01:28:39,946 --> 01:28:41,380
Oh, really?

1680
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:46,053
- Well, who did he meet there?
- I wasn't given details.

1681
01:28:47,154 --> 01:28:50,822
But after that trip,
his opinion changed.

1682
01:28:50,824 --> 01:28:53,959
In nine short paragraphs,
he said that

1683
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:57,528
the UN's authorization
for the 1991 Gulf War

1684
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:59,965
could be reactivated

1685
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:02,401
to legitimize
a new war with Iraq.

1686
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:05,702
He told the Prime Minister
what he wanted to hear?

1687
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:07,839
At best, he was
persuaded to support

1688
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:10,474
a really fringe point of view.

1689
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:13,644
- Oh, really fringe.
- Yeah.

1690
01:29:13,646 --> 01:29:15,749
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

1691
01:29:19,418 --> 01:29:21,118
- Martin Bright.
- Martin.

1692
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,420
- Ben.
- <i>Ben.</i>

1693
01:29:22,422 --> 01:29:23,854
I took
your whistleblower's case.

1694
01:29:23,856 --> 01:29:26,291
Yes, I heard.
Can I meet her?

1695
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:28,760
No, not yet, Martin.
I don't want a media frenzy.

1696
01:29:28,762 --> 01:29:30,062
Okay. When she's ready.

1697
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:32,296
Before some hack
tracks her down.

1698
01:29:32,298 --> 01:29:34,532
Come on, Ben, I broke her story.
I'm on her side.

1699
01:29:34,534 --> 01:29:36,234
Well, you can help
by finding out

1700
01:29:36,236 --> 01:29:38,803
why the Attorney General
went to Washington

1701
01:29:38,805 --> 01:29:40,671
<i>just before the war started.</i>

1702
01:29:40,673 --> 01:29:43,175
Wait, Goldsmith went to DC?

1703
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:44,876
<i>I'd like to know
who he met there.</i>

1704
01:29:44,878 --> 01:29:46,044

01:39:51,217 --> 01:39:52,850
<i>(AUDIENCE MURMURING)</i>

1874
01:39:52,852 --> 01:39:54,520
JUDGE: I beg your pardon?

1875
01:39:56,823 --> 01:40:00,291
My Lord, the prosecution will
not pursue the indictment.

1876
01:40:00,293 --> 01:40:01,561
JUDGE: Today?

1877
01:40:02,495 --> 01:40:04,862
- No, My Lord.
- JUDGE: I'm sorry.

1878
01:40:04,864 --> 01:40:08,368
Are you asking for
an adjournment, Mr. Ellison?

1879
01:40:09,334 --> 01:40:10,701
ELLISON: No, My Lord.

1880
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:12,803
JUDGE: You are saying
that you do not wish

1881
01:40:12,805 --> 01:40:15,907
to proceed at all?

1882
01:40:15,909 --> 01:40:17,274
ELLISON: Yes, My Lord.

1883
01:40:17,276 --> 01:40:19,645
But the accused confessed.

1884
01:40:20,881 --> 01:40:21,844
Yes, My Lord.

1885
01:40:21,846 --> 01:40:24,615
JUDGE: And yet you do not
wish to proceed?

1886
01:40:24,617 --> 01:40:26,416
- ELLISON: No, My Lord.
- JUDGE: I'm sorry.

1887
01:40:26,418 --> 01:40:28,486
I find that extraordinary.

1888
01:40:28,488 --> 01:40:30,524
Do you care to explain?

1889
01:40:33,025 --> 01:40:36,559
My Lord, the accused
submitted an unusual defense.

1890
01:40:36,561 --> 01:40:39,162
Yes. The defense of necessity.

1891
01:40:39,164 --> 01:40:40,798
- ELLISON: Yes.
- And?

1892
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:44,167
And we do not believe we have
sufficient evidence to rebut it.

1893
01:40:44,169 --> 01:40:46,036
Why not? She confessed.

1894
01:40:46,038 --> 01:40:47,639
Because, My Lord,

1895
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,642
the documents that
we have called for would show

1896
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:54,045
that this country was taken
to war illegally...

1897
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:55,379
<i>(AUDIENCE MURMURING)</i>

1898
01:40:55,381 --> 01:40:57,915
...and may expose

1899
01:40:57,917 --> 01:41:01,452
the government to
charges of war crimes.

1900
01:41:01,454 --> 01:41:03,890
- That is absurd!
- Is it?

1901
01:41:05,624 --> 01:41:07,692
Then kindly hand over
the documents

1902
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:10,661
that we have asked to see.

1903
01:41:10,663 --> 01:41:12,429
My Lord, the prosecution
is not obliged.

1904
01:41:12,431 --> 01:41:15,765
Indeed, it is not permitted to continue
with a case if it does not believe

1905
01:41:15,767 --> 01:41:18,368
there is a realistic prospect
of a conviction.

1906
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,604
To do so would be a waste
of taxpayers' funds.

1907
01:41:20,606 --> 01:41:22,473
My Lord, I am thankful

1908
01:41:22,475 --> 01:41:25,643
that the charges against
Ms. Gun are being withdrawn

1909
01:41:25,645 --> 01:41:28,277
and that the Crown
is suddenly so determined

1910
01:41:28,279 --> 01:41:30,480
not to waste taxpayers' money.

1911
01:41:30,482 --> 01:41:33,718
But surely,
after months of uncertainty

1912
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:38,022
and severe distress,
Ms. Gun is entitled to know

1913
01:41:38,024 --> 01:41:40,925
why the government
is dropping this case?

1914
01:41:40,927 --> 01:41:44,194
Indeed, the public
is entitled to know.

1915
01:41:44,196 --> 01:41:45,998
- AUDIENCE: Hear, hear.
- Hear.

1916
01:41:48,534 --> 01:41:50,069
JUDGE: Mr. Ellison?

1917
01:41:53,338 --> 01:41:55,005
Again, My Lord, we do not feel

1918
01:41:55,007 --> 01:41:57,908
we have a realistic prospect
of a conviction.

1919
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,046
There is nothing more
I can say.

1920
01:42:01,047 --> 01:42:02,580
JUDGE: To be clear,

1921
01:42:02,582 --> 01:42:06,750
you are withdrawing
all charges

1922
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:09,489
against
Katharine Teresa Gun?

1923
01:42:12,525 --> 01:42:13,657
Yes, My Lord.

1924
01:42:13,659 --> 01:42:15,162
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1925
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:25,872
Ms. Gun...

1926
01:42:31,244 --> 01:42:32,813
...you are free to go.

REPORTER 6:
<i>So did the Attorney General</i>

1944

<i>put pressure on to stop
the trial?</i>

1945

<i>Did the prime minister?
No answers.</i>

REPORTER:
Would you do it again?

1951
01:44:02,769 --> 01:44:04,801
- Would you do it again?
- I have no regrets.

1952
01:44:04,803 --> 01:44:07,039
Yes, and I would
do it again, yes.

1953
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:23,990
Caught anything?

1954
01:44:25,257 --> 01:44:26,626
Not yet.

1955
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:44,010
You know, it wasn't
my choice to prosecute.

1956
01:44:45,845 --> 01:44:49,348
I was bound by the decision
of the Attorney General.

1957
01:44:50,748 --> 01:44:54,152
Why did you keep her
in a state of distress

1958
01:44:54,154 --> 01:44:58,721
for a year
before you brought charges?

1959
01:44:58,723 --> 01:45:02,492
The services wanted to make
an example of her.

1960
01:45:02,494 --> 01:45:05,429
If we dropped the case
any earlier,

1961
01:45:05,431 --> 01:45:08,133
what kind of message
would that have sent?

1962
01:45:13,138 --> 01:45:15,007
Do me a favor, Ken.

1963
01:45:15,675 --> 01:45:17,744
Go and fish somewhere else.
