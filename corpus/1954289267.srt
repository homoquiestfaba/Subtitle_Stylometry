are you kidding me, Harold?

Strawberry bars again?

21
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,333
Nutrition bars.

22
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,500
I don't want a nutrition bar.

23
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:56,868
I want a blueberry bar.

24
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,470
You ate all the blueberries.

25
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,707
JEFFREY: Well, I don't care.
These taste like crap.

26
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,743
Please, could you just
maybe give him a break?

27
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,311
He's just doing his job.

28
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,913
It's OK.
He doesn't bother me.

29
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,548
Here you go.

30
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,352
I'm gonna just eat
your strawberry bar

31
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,722
because you are a big
fucking complainer.

32
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:18,757
Mmmm.

33
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,925
Hey Jack.

JACK: <i>What's for dinner?</i>

35
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,427
What do you think it is?

36
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,696
Same shit it's been for weeks.

37
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,979
JACK: I don't know, these
strawberry bars are pretty good.

38
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,802
How was it out there, Jack?

39
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:34,273
Same.

40
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,008
Did you see any of them?

41
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,977
No, not one.

42
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,784
Where's Jenny?

43
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,852
Usual.

44
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,495
JACK: <i>Impressive.</i>

45
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,599
Thanks.

46
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,369
I have to start over.

47
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,604
Why would you want to do that?

48
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,876
Well, I just don't understand
who these people are.

49
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:14,546
I mean, there are so many
notes, and so much detail.

50
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:18,417
I'm just trying to piece together
something about this place.

51
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,320
Oh, I missed it again, didn't I?

52
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,421
I brought you a plate.

53
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,424
Thank you.

54
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,092
You're welcome.

55
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,995
Well, I uhh,

56
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,397
I should probably go
check on the others.

57
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,634
OK. Thanks.

58
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,601
No fair.

59
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,170
Where on earth did
you find those, man?

60
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,538
Went out this morning.

61
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,444
Cigarettes, booze go
into the communal pot.

62
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,747
<i>Everything else, finders keepers.</i>

63
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,982
Your rules, Jack.

64
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,819
Brought you a plate.

65
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,087
Yeah.

66
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,891
Not much of an appetite these days.

67
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,863
Could use the company, though.

68
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,098
Why don't you come upstairs?

69
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,867
<i>Join the group.</i>

70
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,743
You know I can't do that.

71
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,448
I can't trust those people, Jack.

72
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,517
No. They're good people.

73
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:34,653
Really?

74
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,602
Try not to burn the
place down, huh?

75
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,041
You know, Jack, you're
a real pal, man.

76
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,578
JACK: <i>See you soon.</i>

77
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,712
I'll be here.

82
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,662
Fixed?

83
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,130
It's stuck.

84
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,631
(TOOL DROPPING ON GROUND)

85
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,006
I bet it's summer time out there.

86
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,676
Must be.

87
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,946
Yeah, you're probably right.

88
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:51,256
Maybe we could go out and have a
look around, or, somebody could.

89
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,593
You serious?

90
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,131
Maybe things have changed.

91
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,200
I don't know, look around.

92
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,668
I think it seems kind of the same.

93
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,771
No one's come for us.

94
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,842
It's still light out, all the time.

95
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,045
And we haven't heard anyone.

96
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,751
No airplanes.
No helicopters.

97
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,919
No sirens. Nothing.

98
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,821
You haven't heard those things.
Maybe they're gone.

99
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,391
<i>We should go out and have
a look around, or...</i>

100
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,026
maybe there's somebody out there.

101
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,279
Just an idea, you're
the boss, Jack.

102
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,415
You say we stay, then we stay.

103

ASHLEY:
<i>Jenny, who you working on today?</i>

104
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,897
He's hot.

105
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,298
He's 15.

106
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,034
Right. Okay.

107
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,836
I didn't know there were
kids in this institution.

108
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,904
Yeah.

109
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,706
What's the story?

110
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,175
His name is Devin Killian.

111
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,045
Looks like he was admitted
with behavioral issues,

112
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,013
potential psychosis.

113
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,749
Says here, he got into a
fight with his teacher.

114
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,051
Says he spat on her.

115
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,419
That doesn't sound that bad.

116
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:31,056
Well, he also burnt down
his parents' house.

117
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,991
I stand corrected.

118
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:35,093
I like this kid already.

119
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:36,895
JENNY: <i>Crazy kid, though.</i>

120
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,231

with these kids, you know?</i>

The bag, the bag!

124
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,838
The bag!

125
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,872
Your turn tonight, Ashley.

126
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,109
OK. Oh, I'm too nervous.

127
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,977
You read it.

128
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,879
All righty.

129
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,449
Ah, story night.

130
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,151
Describe the best day of your life.

131
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:03,722
All right.
Wait, actually.

132
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,824
Before we start, I've got
something for everybody.

133

Woo-hoo.

00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:13,364
Bless you, Jack.

137
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,300
Where'd you get that?

138
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,868
A desk on the second floor

139
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,837
that I've walked by
a thousand times.

140
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,740

To Jack...
To Jack...

143
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,246
Fantastic, I haven't had whiskey

144
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,381
since about six months
before the aliens.

145
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,785
Are you serious?

146
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:34,786
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,088
Harold, you know the rule.

148
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,859
Keep your theories to yourself.
Yeah, especially when they're crazy.

149
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,826
Jeffrey!

150
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,330
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,239
Ashley, it's your turn.

152
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,374
You've gotta describe the
best day of your life.

153
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:57,542
I want to hear from Jenny.

154
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:02,514
Okay.

155
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,286
Best day of my life...
Would have to be

156
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:13,291
when I was promoted
to VP of operations.

157
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,093
It was everything I'd worked for.

158
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,395
<i>Harold.</i>

159
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,464
Me? Oh, that's easy.

160
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:25,336
Best day of my life,
August 16th, 1975.

161
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:28,406
My wife had this early contraction

162
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:31,509
so I rushed her to the
hospital at 1:23.

163
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,846
That afternoon, our
son was born, Samuel.

164
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:35,547
Mmmm.

165
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,484
Full head of dark hair, blue eyes.

166
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,421
Beautiful.

167
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,023
<i>I always said to
him, "Sam, you know,</i>

168
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,826
you were born on the
hottest day of the year."

169
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,027
It was.
It was 110 degrees.

170
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,998
I have a photograph.

171
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,999
You want to see him?

172
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,067
Yes, please.

173
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,004
HAROLD: That's him.
MERYL: Oooh!

174
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,039
HAROLD: Beautiful, huh?

175
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,407
He's precious.

176
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,013
ASHLEY: <i>Jeffrey.</i>

177
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,485
I'll go.

178
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:20,992
Best day of my life, the day
my father lost everything.

179
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,126
<i>That's the best day of your life?</i>

180
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,295
That's sad.

181
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,064
JEFFREY: <i>I was nothing without him.</i>

182
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,367
He made sure I knew that.

183

We need to get down
to the basement.

902
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:27,334
We'll barricade ourselves in there,

903
01:23:27,336 --> 01:23:29,169
hold out till help comes.

904
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,206
I have to leave.

01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,108

everything you can.

906
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:36,377
Anything... food, anything useful.

907
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,248
I'm leaving.

908
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:45,386
What?

909
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:48,756
All my life I...

910
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,660
I've never been good at
making decisions for myself,

911
01:23:53,662 --> 01:23:58,465
for my wife, for my son,
for my like, for anything.

912
01:24:02,203 --> 01:24:05,339
But I think I figured out
what those things are.

913
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:08,075
It's the unknown.

914
01:24:08,077 --> 01:24:11,412
It's everything we've ever feared.

915
01:24:11,414 --> 01:24:15,082
And it won't stop chasing or
looking until it catches us.

916
01:24:15,084 --> 01:24:19,186
And when it does, I don't want to be
hiding in the darkness of a basement.

917
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,356
I want to be outside.

918
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:25,092
I want to be in the
light so I can see it.

919
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:33,167
I don't have any fear.

920
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,636
It's gone.

921
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:40,641
