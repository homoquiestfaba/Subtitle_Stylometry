1
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:07,999
D'you mind
if I turn this down?

2
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:08,934
No.

3
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:11,104
<i> You're on with Phil.</i>

4
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:15,106
<i> Davis. Where are we</i>
<i> with the lightyear deal?</i>

5
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,741
The banks won't budge,
you know.

6
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,577
They're claiming
regulations as an excuse.

7
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,079
Same thing they did
with haskell athletic.

8
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,148
<i> Yeah, yeah...</i>
<i> What, they want more cushion?</i>

9
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:26,051
Yup. 5%.

10
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,820
<i> All right, very good.</i>
<i> Is my daughter with you?</i>

11
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,855
Hey, dad.

12
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,725
<i> Hey, your mother's upset.</i>
<i> Why aren't you talking?</i>

13
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:35,727
That's between me and mom.

14
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,863
<i> Well, you should</i>
<i> call. She's hard-headed.</i>

15
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:41,232
Well, I guess that's
where I get it from.

16
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,702
Well, we'll talk it out on
Sunday at dinner, okay?

17
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,671
Okay. Bye, dad.
<i> All right love. Bye-bye.</i>

18
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,877
Have you looked
at the refrigerator yet?

19
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,716
Huh? The refrigerator?

20
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,818
Yeah. The box in our kitchen
that keeps things cold.

21
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,620
Yeah.

22
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,155
No. Uh, what about it?

23
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,758
It's leaking... it's been
leaking for two weeks.

24
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,829
The refrigerator's leaking.

25
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,963
Please don't do
that thing where you

26
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,765
repeat part of what I said

27
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,766
so I'll think
you're paying attention.

28
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,167
I'm not doing anything.

29
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,369
The refrigerator's leaking,
i didn't notice.

30
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,671
Can't you just fix it?

31
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,939
Your father
gave you those tools.

32
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,142
I have tools?

33
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,410
Yes. From two christmases ago.

34
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,784
"Not my chair,
not my problem."

35
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:33,885
Is that what you say?

36
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,957
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

37
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,232
<i> Davis...</i>

38
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,103
<i> Davis...</i>

39
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,207
<i> She's gone.</i>

40
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,837
The machine over there?
Uh, my candy's stuck.

41
00:03:58,839 --> 00:03:59,838
It happens sometimes.

42
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:04,042
Do you have a key or something
we can open it up with?

43
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,810
The machine doesn't belong
to the hospital.

44
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,878
It's a vending company.

45
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,933
<i> Davis, it's mom and dad.</i>

46
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,336
<i> We tried your</i>
<i> cell phone but we...</i>

47
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,304
<i> We can't get a hold</i>
<i> of you, and then...</i>

48
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,240
<i> Oh, honey...</i>

49
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:36,174
<i> We're... we're coming, son.</i>

50
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,111
<i> You have one saved message.</i>

51
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,813
<i> Hey, it's me,</i>
<i> your mailbox was full.</i>

52
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,848
<i> There's supposed to be</i>
<i> a package delivered,</i>

53
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,884
<i> so if you beat me home,</i>
<i> answer the doorbell, okay?</i>

54
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:46,951
<i> Love.</i>

55
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,051
Oh, honey...

56
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,186
- Yeah! Again! Again!
- Again?

57
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,905
<i> Dear champion</i>
<i> vending company, comma.</i>

58
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,907
<i> This letter is in regards to</i>

59
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,575
<i> a poor vending experience</i>
<i> at St. Andre's...</i>

60
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,210
<i> No, wait.</i>

61
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:55,013
<i> In regards to</i>
<i> vending machine number 714</i>

62
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,547
<i> located in</i>
<i> the intensive care unit</i>

63
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,549
<i> of Saint Andre's hospital.</i>

64
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,285
<i> I put five quarters</i>
<i> in the machine,</i>

65
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,353
<i> and proceeded to push b2,</i>

66
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,389
<i> which should've given me</i>
<i> the peanut M&M's, period.</i>

67
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,492
<i> Regrettably, it did not.</i>

68
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,262
<i> I found this upsetting</i>
<i> as I was very hungry.</i>

69
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,064
<i> And also, my wife had died</i>
<i> 10 minutes earlier.</i>

70
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,703
<i> I'm not saying</i>
<i> that was your fault.</i>

71
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,338
<i> We were in a car accident.</i>

72
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,573
<i> Remarkably,</i>
<i> I escaped without a scratch.</i>

73
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,542
<i> I'm not trying to</i>
<i> dramatize my claim,</i>

74
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,344
<i> I just wanna be thorough.</i>

75
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:27,445
<i> Maybe I should start</i>
<i> from the beginning.</i>

76
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,216
<i> I get up every</i>
<i> morning at 5:30.</i>

77
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:36,218
<i> I work in the markets</i>

78
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,352
<i> so it's important</i>
<i> to get an early start.</i>

79
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:37,689
<i> Not to imply that it's</i>
<i> any more important than, say,</i>

80
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,158
<i> a Baker or a toll collector.</i>

81
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,594
<i> Those are fine,</i>
<i> respectable jobs.</i>

82
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,230
<i> I just mean that I commute.</i>

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,300
<i> I catch the 7:15</i>
<i> out of white plains.</i>

84
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,436
<i> It's pretty much the same</i>
<i> crowd during the week.</i>

85
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,438
<i> John works the ground crew</i>
<i> at yankee stadium.</i>

86
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,672
<i> The first time we met,</i>
<i> he asked what I did,</i>

87
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,074
<i> and I told him...</i>

88
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,342
Uh, retail mattresses.

89
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,412
Retail mattresses?
That's amazing...

90
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,414
<i> I don't know why.</i>
<i> It just popped into my head.</i>

91
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,250
<i> I avoided him</i>
<i> after that 'cause</i>

92
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,286
<i> I couldn't stand</i>
<i> his hot coffee breath.</i>

93
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,220
Excuse me...

94
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:10,655
<i> I think he knew.</i>

95
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,658
<i> I never thought I'd</i>
<i> be one of those people</i>

96
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,393
<i> who carried a briefcase.</i>

97
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:16,594
<i> It always reminds me of</i>

98
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,495
<i> carrying a lunch box</i>
<i> to school.</i>

99
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:19,731
<i> Do they still make those?</i>

100
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,733
Mister Mitchell.

101
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,568
Morning.

102
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,336
<i> Julia's father is</i>
<i> a founding partner</i>

103
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,238
<i> at the investment firm</i>
<i> I work at.</i>

104
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,741
<i> Nepotism in its truest form.</i>

105
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,342
<i> He started grooming me</i>
<i> when I was 27.</i>

106
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:35,146
<i> I hate that word.</i>

107
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,483
<i> Monkeys groom.</i>

108
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,618
Wavin' at you from over here.
Can you see me, buddy?

109
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,120
<i> It's a small firm,</i>

110
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,354
<i> but we handle</i>
<i> quite a bit of money.</i>

111
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,356
<i> I don't wanna say how much,</i>

112
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,157
<i> 'cause I think</i>
<i> it would be inappropriate.</i>

113
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,425
Just look over
where the money is.

114
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,393
<i> Okay, it's $6 billion.</i>

115
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,662
<i> Emerging markets,</i>
<i> infrastructure,</i>

116
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,698
<i> power plants,</i>
<i> telecom, seaworld,</i>

117
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,500
<i> windshield wipers...</i>
Mmm-hmm.

118
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,102
<i> You name it.</i>
<i> Doesn't matter what industry.</i>

119
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,470
<i> We buy 'em cheap,</i>
<i> and we sell it for a bundle.</i>

120
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,372
<i> But none of it's real.</i>

121
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,440
<i> Nothing to hold in my hands.</i>

122
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,275
<i> It's all just numbers.</i>

123
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,543
<i> Computer codes</i>
<i> being transferred</i>

124
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,511
<i> electronically</i>
<i> through the air.</i>

125
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,213
<i> Right in front of us.</i>

126
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,215
<i> The French poet,</i>
<i> Paul valery,</i>

127
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,151
<i> was right when he said,</i>

128
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:15,086
<i> "the future isn't</i>
<i> what it used to be."</i>

129
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,188
<i> Phil Eastwood.</i>
<i> My father-in-law.</i>

130
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,058
<i> F-i-l. Phil.</i>

131
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,393
<i> I think</i>
<i> the acronym is hysterical.</i>

132
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,295
<i> I know Phil is</i>
<i> spelled with a p-h,</i>

133
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:25,730
<i> but it still makes</i>
<i> me laugh in my head.</i>

134
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,098
Davis.

135
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,299
Bullshit.

136
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,268
<i> I met Julia at a party.</i>

137
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,135
<i> Who put</i>
<i> that goddamn chair there?</i>

138
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,637
<i> Not my chair...</i>

139
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,406
<i> Not my chair, not my problem,</i>
<i> that's what I say.</i>

140
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,742
<i> A mutual friend said</i>
<i> she thought I was hot.</i>

141
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,744
<i> I returned the compliment.</i>

142
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,479
<i> ...i like things with</i>
<i> seashells and seahorses</i>

143
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,648
<i> on 'em,</i>
<i> like blankets and towels...</i>

144
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,550
<i> We had sex about</i>
<i> three hours later.</i>

145
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,251
Forever...

146
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,090
Forever...

147
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,566
<i> I don't think Phil</i>
<i> liked me that much at first.</i>

148
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:05,771
<i> I grew up in Jersey.</i>

149
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,106
<i> I didn't come from money.</i>

150
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,240
<i> And I puked</i>
<i> on the ice sculpture</i>

151
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:09,874
<i> at our engagement party.</i>

152
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,177
<i> Also, he told me once...</i>

153
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:17,179
I don't like you, Davis.

154
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,618
<i> Julia was a nice girl.</i>
<i> A good person.</i>

155
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,587
<i> She worked with</i>
<i> special needs children,</i>

156
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,455
<i> she snorted when she laughed</i>

157
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,723
<i> and cried every time</i>
<i> they showed</i>

158
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,458
<i> footage of the towers falling.</i>

159
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,360
<i> Other than that,</i>

160
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,262
<i> I don't think I knew</i>
<i> who she really was.</i>

161
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,464
<i> She always said</i>
<i> I didn't pay attention.</i>

162
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,306
<i> Perhaps you'll find</i>
<i> this information irrelevant</i>

163
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,842
<i> in your deliberation</i>
<i> of my refund,</i>

164
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,210
<i> but I think you deserve</i>
<i> the whole story.</i>

165
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,747
<i> Sincerely, Davis c. Mitchell.</i>

166
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:01,926
You okay?

167
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,205
Morning.

168
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,975
Morning, Amy. Is that me?

169
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,377
Yeah... that's it.

170
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,779
Great. Put this in
the outgoing mail?

171
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,880
It's important.

172
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,660
I, um...

173
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,361
I didn't think you
were coming in today,

174
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,729
they said you weren't...

175
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,000
I am so sorry, Davis.

176
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,408
Thank you, Amy.

177
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:24,709
When you get a minute,
can I get the revenue numbers

178
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,410
on alderman international?

179
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,479
And can you push
my lunch with Bob rice?

180
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,380
I got a lot of
catching up to do.

181
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:31,582
Yeah...

182
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,837
I handed you people

183
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,605
a billion dollars' worth
of committed capital

184
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,807
and all you can give me
is 150 million dollars'

185
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,976
worth of
companies to buy.

186
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,746
Doesn't anyone like to shop?
Should I call my mother?

187
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,416
Phil.

188
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,024
They called the house.
Told me you were up here.

189
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,925
They did? Okay.

190
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,894
I talked to Clayton brown
this morning.

191
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,663
And I think I talked him
off the ledge on that thing.

192
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:21,565
Look, why don't we
go grab a drink?

193
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,701
I'm buried, Phil.
Two weeks out from lightyear,

194
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,769
and I gotta get
some momentum going.

195
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,071
Davis, let's grab a drink.

196
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,446
You know,
the cocktails run

197
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,048
about 18 bucks a pop here.

198
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,584
I don't get it.

199
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,955
We haven't
really talked, Davis.

200
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:45,923
Not since... everything.

201
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,328
I loved Julia.

202
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:54,932
So much.

203
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,603
It's a father's love.

204
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,076
A man loses his wife,
he's a widower.

205
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,816
A child loses a parent,
they're an orphan.

206
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,620
But losing a child...

207
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:19,690
There's no word for this.

208
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,360
And there shouldn't be.

209
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:27,765
But you...

210
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,637
You and I have to continue on.

211
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,611
I want you to know
you've been a value to me,

212
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,381
and not just in business,
but in my life.

213
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,383
And, uh...

214
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,527
You keep your emotions
close to the vest,

215
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,728
that's good, that's strong.

216
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:01,599
I do the same.

217
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,167
It's the atmosphere.

218
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,105
What?

219
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,573
That's why the drinks
are so expensive.

220
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,641
You're paying
for the atmosphere.

221
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,475
It just occurred to me.

222
00:15:19,484 --> 00:15:22,553
Davis, listen,
there's some other business

223
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,954
that needs looking after.

224
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,489
It's the insurance policy.

225
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,592
I'd like to take her money

226
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,061
and start a foundation
in Julia's name.

227
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:32,930
Foundation...

228
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,768
<i> A merit-based scholarship</i>

229
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,470
<i> awarded annually</i>

230
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,838
<i> to one student</i>
<i> who's most deserving.</i>

231
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,041
<i> How much</i>
<i> are we talking about?</i>

232
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,710
<i> About 2.6.</i>

233
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,648
<i> Steven's gonna get</i>
<i> the ball rolling.</i>

234
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,184
This'll be her legacy.

235
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:54,919
Legacy...

236
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,196
<i> Dear</i>
<i> champion vending company.</i>

237
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,998
<i> This is Davis Mitchell. Again.</i>

238
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
<i> There have been some</i>
<i> recent developments</i>

239
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,835
<i> in my claim for reimbursement,</i>

240
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,069
<i> and I'd like to</i>
<i> represent myself</i>

241
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,237
<i> as accurately as possible.</i>

242
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:17,239
Dinner's ready, son.

243
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,173
<i> First,</i>
<i> there was a strange package</i>

244
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,241
<i> blocking my garage.</i>

245
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,709
Mom?

246
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:19,944
I think it's
a cappuccino machine.

247
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:21,712
I didn't order
a cappuccino machine.

248
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,249
It was in Julia's name.

249
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,921
<i> Then, my dad was</i>
<i> fertilizing the lawn</i>

250
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,122
<i> at 7:00 in the morning.</i>

251
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,257
Dad! What are you doing?

252
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,892
It's the season, Davis.

253
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,727
You should do this.
You need to.

254
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,962
Get the soil ready.

255
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,597
I have someone for that.

256
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,265
Do they know
about gypsy moths?

257
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,167
What?

258
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,170
Gypsy moths.
They'll destroy your trees.

259
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,607
It starts as a caterpillar.

260
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,641
They eat the leaves,
lay eggs...

261
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,643
And they're coming here,
to this neighborhood?

262
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,911
Well,
they don't know for sure,

263
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:54,778
but you should tell
your guy to spray.

264
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,780
<i> And of course,</i>
<i> the train incident...</i>

265
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,184
I feel like I should
tell you something.

266
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:03,954
Um, I'm in finance.

267
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,692
I don't know why I told you

268
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,960
that I worked in
the mattress business.

269
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,295
I guess I didn't
expect to see you

270
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:12,730
every day for five years.

271
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:15,266
You think I'm a dick.

272
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,106
I don't work for
the Yankees anymore.

273
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,776
Got fired over
a drainage issue

274
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:26,710
in the visitors' bullpen.

275
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,882
I work security now
at parade of shoes in midtown.

276
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:38,155
Fuckin' job. Excuse me.

277
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,026
My little prick of a boss.
He's 30 years younger than me.

278
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,028
I just wanna go in there

279
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:44,762
and smash
his little prick face.

280
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,134
Jeez.

281
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,168
I didn't love my wife.

282
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,610
I know, it's sad...
It's sad to say,

283
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,313
but now that she's gone,

284
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:04,915
I don't even feel sad
or pain or hurt, or...

285
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:08,919
Well, what do you feel?

286
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:11,355
<i> I couldn't tell you</i>
<i> why I did it.</i>

287
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:20,664
So that's when you pulled it.

288
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,966
<i> Maybe because</i>
<i> I was finally being honest.</i>

289
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:22,933
Yes.

290
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,171
And you knew that would
stop the train, correct?

291
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:31,041
Well, I wasn't positive,
but I was hoping.

292
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,376
<i> All I can say is,</i>

293
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,677
<i> it felt like</i>
<i> a legitimate emergency.</i>

294
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,083
His wife just died.

295
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,392
Davis, maybe you should

296
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,860
come stay with us for a while.

297
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,762
Take it easy.

298
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,664
We have the extra room.

299
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,066
I could sure use help
putting that gazebo together.

300
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,368
How's that sound?

301
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,439
Remember
to tell your guy to spray.

302
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,011
<i> Hello again,</i>
<i> it's Davis Mitchell.</i>

303
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,915
<i> My parents left</i>
<i> for tampa this afternoon,</i>

304
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,051
<i> and I stayed at the airport</i>
<i> an extra two hours</i>

305
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,419
<i> watching people</i>
<i> walk back and forth</i>

306
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,420
<i> with their luggage in tow.</i>

307
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,758
<i> I find I'm suddenly</i>
<i> filled with... wait...</i>

308
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,828
<i> Overwhelmed by...</i>

309
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:02,766
<i> A growing sense</i>
<i> of curiosity...</i>

310
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,206
<i> What are in these bags?</i>

311
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:10,876
<i> I wanna know what these people</i>

312
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,244
<i> can't do without</i>
<i> for four days in buffalo.</i>

313
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,482
<i> I wanna go through</i>
<i> every one of them</i>

314
00:20:18,484 --> 00:20:21,185
<i> and dump their shit</i>
<i> in a huge pile.</i>

315
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,925
<i> And the national guard guy?</i>
<i> I wanna hold his gun.</i>

316
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,896
<i> I wanna protect my country.</i>

317
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,975
<i> I'm starting to notice things</i>
<i> I never saw before.</i>

318
00:20:51,015 --> 00:20:51,982
<i> Well...</i>

319
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,785
<i> Maybe I saw them.</i>

320
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,921
<i> I just wasn't</i>
<i> paying attention.</i>

321
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:04,795
<i> For some reason,</i>

322
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,333
<i> everything has become</i>
<i> a metaphor.</i>

323
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:12,836
Metaphor...

324
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:16,840
<i> Metaphor...</i>

325
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,377
<i> I am the uprooted tree.</i>
<i> No, wait...</i>

326
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:22,846
<i> I am the storm</i>
<i> that uprooted the tree.</i>

327
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,450
<i> I am the cold front</i>

328
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,986
<i> that collided with</i>
<i> the low-pressure system.</i>

329
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,789
<i> Too much.</i>

330
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,411
Morning, Amy.
Put a stamp on that?

331
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,823
<i> There's something else,</i>
<i> dearest vending company.</i>

332
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,124
<i> It's been scratching</i>
<i> at the inside of my head.</i>

333
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:19,503
<i> I couldn't take it</i>
<i> one second longer.</i>

334
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,007
<i> The goddamn refrigerator</i>
<i> was leaking.</i>

335
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:30,448
<i> Now, I wouldn't say</i>
<i> I'm handy by any means.</i>

336
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:32,216
<i> Mechanically retarded</i>
<i> would be closer to the truth.</i>

337
00:22:33,451 --> 00:22:34,418
<i> But Phil said it himself,</i>

338
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,987
<i> "if you wanna</i>
<i> fix something..."</i>

339
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,456
You have to take
everything apart...

340
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:41,158
<i> "...and figure out</i>
<i> what's important."</i>

341
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,392
What'll make you stronger.

342
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,200
<i> Repairing the human heart</i>

343
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,502
<i> is like repairing</i>
<i> an automobile.</i>

344
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,338
<i> Just examine everything.</i>

345
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,342
<i> Then you can put it</i>
<i> all back together.</i>

346
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,222
<i> Put it all back together...</i>

347
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,358
<i> Hmm.</i>

348
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,501
Hello?

349
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,436
<i> Hello.</i>
<i> Mr. Davis Mitchell?</i>

350
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:27,404
Yes?

351
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,173
<i> This is Karen moreno</i>

352
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,409
<i> from champion vending company.</i>

353
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,011
<i> I'm with customer service.</i>

354
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,647
Yeah?

355
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,449
<i> I'm calling in regards</i>

356
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,350
<i> to your complaint letters,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

357
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
<i> There's been four so far.</i>

358
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,127
You're with the customer
service department?

359
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:54,298
<i> Yes, sir. I am the customer</i>
<i> service department.</i>

360
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,266
<i> It's just me.</i>

361
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,036
Do you usually make service
calls at 2:00 in the morning?

362
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,139
<i> No. Not really. Never.</i>

363
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,007
<i> I... I apologize</i>
<i> for the inconvenience.</i>

364
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:06,443
I was just venting.

365
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,445
I didn't expect anybody
to read them. Sorry if...

366
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,546
<i> Your letters made me cry,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

367
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,117
<i> Do you have anyone to talk to?</i>

368
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:21,024
<i> I... I'm gonna submit your</i>
<i> claim to management.</i>

369
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,292
<i> In the meantime is</i>
<i> there something else</i>

370
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,062
<i> I can do for you,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell?</i>

371
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,564
Wait, wait. Karen moreno,
that's your name?

372
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:31,034
<i> This is weird. I...</i>
<i> I shouldn't have called.</i>

373
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,737
<i> I... I'm going to contact you</i>
<i> at a more reasonable hour.</i>

374
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:36,606
<i> I'm sorry again,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

375
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:39,343
<i> This is so unprofessional.</i>

376
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,744
Customer service
is a profession?

377
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:05,068
Some people
wallow through their grief.

378
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,636
My wife, she cooks.

379
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,074
This is delicious, margot,
what is it?

380
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,644
Did Julia tell you
what we were fighting about?

381
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,586
I bought her these bath towels
and she didn't like 'em,

382
00:25:22,588 --> 00:25:25,055
so she took 'em back
without telling me.

383
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:29,026
And we hadn't spoken
for three days.

384
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:35,432
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,366
Excuse me.

386
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,507
Hi, Karen.

387
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:44,508
<i> How did you know it was me?</i>

388
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,512
I have you programmed
into my phone.

389
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:51,248
<i> Oh, I see. I'm not sure</i>
<i> how I feel about that.</i>

390
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,118
<i> There's something else</i>
<i> I wanted to bring</i>

391
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,520
<i> to your attention</i>
<i> regarding your claim.</i>

392
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:58,221
Okay.

393
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,258
<i> During our previous</i>
<i> conversation,</i>

394
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,062
<i> you implied that my job</i>
<i> wasn't a profession.</i>

395
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,398
Oh, well... I'm sorry,
i didn't mean it as an insult.

396
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,834
<i> I know. But it made me think,</i>

397
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,103
<i> and I concluded that</i>
<i> you might be right.</i>

398
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:16,673
God bless con ed.

399
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,142
And there was light!

400
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,645
Yeah. I've gotta go.
Thank you for dinner.

401
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:24,681
Really?

402
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:30,420
<i> "Moreno" means brown</i>
<i> in Spanish, did you know that?</i>

403
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,756
<i> Yes, I did, of course.</i>

404
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,357
<i> Do you have brown hair?</i>

405
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,725
<i> No, it's blonde.</i>

406
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,563
<i> Are you</i>
<i> of Spanish descent?</i>

407
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:42,766
<i> No. Why do you ask?</i>

408
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,835
<i> I'm just trying</i>
<i> to paint a mental picture.</i>

409
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,739
Excuse me,
is Karen moreno here?

410
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,208
Who?

411
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,443
Blonde hair, Hazel eyes,

412
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,178
but not hispanic like
her name suggests?

413
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,590
Hi, where are you?

414
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:10,494
<i> I was there, in the diner.</i>

415
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,496
<i> I sat in a booth</i>
<i> for a few minutes.</i>

416
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,231
<i> I even played a song</i>

417
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,266
<i> on the little baby jukebox,</i>
<i> and then...</i>

418
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,301
<i> I dunno, I got sad, so I left.</i>

419
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:19,903
Oh.

420
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,572
What song did you play?

421
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,841
Crazy on you, <i> by heart.</i>

422
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,577
That made you sad?

423
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:29,446
<i> Not so much the song.</i>

424
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,748
<i> How are your pancakes?</i>

425
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,418
<i> Oh, I...</i>
<i> I'm in the parking lot.</i>

426
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,453
What?

427
00:27:41,492 --> 00:27:42,792
You're a smoker.

428
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:46,897
<i> It's cannabis.</i>
<i> I have a prescription.</i>

429
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,332
Oh.

430
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:51,234
Okay.

431
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,470
<i> You look younger</i>
<i> than I expected.</i>

432
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,775
Do you think
you could come inside?

433
00:27:57,775 --> 00:27:59,910
<i> Oh, well, it's just that...</i>

434
00:27:59,912 --> 00:28:02,579
<i> I have this nice image of you</i>

435
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:04,781
<i> sitting there in the window</i>
<i> eating pancakes.</i>

436
00:28:04,783 --> 00:28:07,450
<i> Maybe that's all it's supposed</i>
<i> to be, ya know?</i>

437
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,786
Yeah, but my image of you is

438
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,956
a shadowy figure
smoking pot in a corolla.

439
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:17,594
<i> You know what? I should go.</i>
<i> Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go.</i>

440
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,695
No, no, no, wait. I have
another letter here for you.

441
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:20,530
<i> Put it in the mail.</i>

442
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:22,899
I think it's for real, Phil.

443
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:23,900
If their
second quarter earnings

444
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,468
are an indication of growth,

445
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,603
even just two
or three percent,

446
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,804
then it's a risk worth taking.

447
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:28,905
Davis, do you need some paper?

448
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,275
Is there something
you'd like to

449
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,310
contribute to the discussion?

450
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,617
Yes, actually.
But it's more of a question.

451
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,819
Would any of you consider
<i> crazy on you</i> to be a sad song?

452
00:28:45,923 --> 00:28:47,624
And that's from, you know,
assuming

453
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:48,558
that you're familiar with
the heart catalog.

454
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:06,910
<i> Going down.</i>

455
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:17,047
Can I help you? Hi.

456
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,982
Oh, yeah.
I'm looking for Karen.

457
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,684
I'm sorry, who are you?

458
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:24,387
I'm Davis. I have a...

459
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:25,822
Customer service issue.

460
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,691
Oh, I'm Carl.
This is my company.

461
00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:28,558
What's the problem?

462
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,528
I really can't
get into it, Carl.

463
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,066
There's way too much
ground to cover.

464
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,434
But thanks for your concern.

465
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,709
<i> Did you get</i>
<i> the foundation proposal?</i>

466
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,078
<i> I'm gonna need you to sign off</i>
<i> before we move forward.</i>

467
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,383
Listen, have you thought about
talking to someone?

468
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,354
Professionally, I mean.

469
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,425
I didn't go upside down!

470
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,767
<i> Your father thinks</i>
<i> I'm losing my mind.</i>

471
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,107
Hmm.

472
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:48,171
<i> Hello?</i>

473
00:31:49,907 --> 00:31:52,509
I just dismantled
a $2,000 cappuccino machine.

474
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,146
<i> Why did you call me,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell?</i>

475
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,013
Why'd you answer?

476
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,452
<i> There's something about</i>
<i> your letters.</i>

477
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:03,753
<i> I'm re-reading one</i>
<i> right now in my tub.</i>

478
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,792
<i> I'm not bathing or anything.</i>
<i> I just sit here.</i>

479
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:12,429
<i> It's quiet, and I don't</i>
<i> wanna wake up my son.</i>

480
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,097
<i> Did I mention I have a son?</i>

481
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,532
No.

482
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,966
<i> Yeah, he's 15.</i>

483
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,503
<i> But looks 12 and acts 21.</i>

484
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,074
<i> So bright, but he</i>
<i> scares the shit outta me.</i>

485
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,644
<i> Karen...</i>

486
00:32:27,646 --> 00:32:28,778
<i> I... I have to go.</i>

487
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,114
<i> You shouldn't have</i>

488
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,982
<i> come to my office,</i>
<i> mister Mitchell.</i>

489
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,717
<i> This sets</i>
<i> a dangerous precedent.</i>

490
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:35,652
Dangerous?

491
00:32:40,057 --> 00:32:42,559
<i> Dear Karen, is it okay</i>
<i> that I address you directly</i>

492
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,927
<i> now that we've almost met?</i>

493
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:44,794
<i> I'll assume so.</i>

494
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,230
<i> I was on the train today,</i>

495
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,199
<i> and I saw a woman</i>
<i> staring at me.</i>

496
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:53,069
<i> There was something about her.</i>

497
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,204
<i> So I went and</i>
<i> introduced myself.</i>

498
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,171
Hi.

499
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,208
Hello.

500
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,809
I'm Davis.

501
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:02,946
Do we know each other?

502
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,215
No.

503
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,054
I'm... I'm not trying
to pick you up or anything.

504
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,089
I just... you look familiar.

505
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:25,535
Is it okay... sorry, I...

506
00:33:30,107 --> 00:33:31,074
Tough day?

507
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:33,576
No. Not really, no.

508
00:33:34,778 --> 00:33:36,679
My job isn't really
that difficult.

509
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,014
It's the guys underneath me

510
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,182
who do most
of the heavy lifting.

511
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,851
I just take
all the credit for it.

512
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,086
Wow.

513
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,222
Most people
wouldn't admit that.

514
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,727
I actually cheated my way

515
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,195
through my last year
of college.

516
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:54,197
I had this guy Edmond write
all my papers for me,

517
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,932
and sometimes,
I'd give him ecstasy.

518
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:58,537
You know...

519
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:02,739
<i> She was quiet,</i>
<i> but for some reason,</i>

520
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,840
<i> I wanted to tell her things.</i>

521
00:34:07,077 --> 00:34:09,012
<i> I found myself</i>
<i> mapping her face as I talked.</i>

522
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,950
<i> Somehow, she got me talking</i>
<i> about my wife.</i>

523
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,986
<i> I really let her in.</i>

524
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:20,623
<i> Then, out of nowhere,</i>
<i> she asked...</i>

525
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,858
So why'd you marry her?

526
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,730
I dunno. 'Cause it was easy.

527
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:32,902
Yeah...

528
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,738
<i> Next stop, scarsdale.</i>

529
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:38,575
<i> I wanted to ask her name...</i>

530
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,909
This is me.

531
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:40,643
<i> But she disappeared so quick.</i>

532
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,247
<i> I spent the next 10 minutes</i>
<i> kicking myself.</i>

533
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,015
"...the next 10 minutes
kicking myself."

534
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,283
"What are the chances

535
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:47,951
"I'd ever see
this woman again?"

536
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:52,088
<i> "Fortunately, she left</i>
<i> her magazine on the seat."</i>

537
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,025
<i> I think you know</i>
<i> who it was addressed to.</i>

538
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,194
<i> And scarsdale ain't her stop.</i>

539
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:00,730
<i> No more games, Karen.</i>
<i> I'll see you soon.</i>

540
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,153
You. What are you doing here?

541
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:26,155
I'm here to see Karen moreno.
What are you doing here?

542
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,757
What am I doing here?

543
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,626
Who the...
What the fuck do you want?

544
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,260
Well...
You don't have to swear, Carl.

545
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,228
I told you I have
a customer service issue.

546
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,696
What...

547
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,632
Carl, this is Davis Mitchell.

548
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,866
Yeah, I was
supposed to call you.

549
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,334
Hi, Karen.

550
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,837
He, uh... he's having problems
with one of the machines.

551
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,105
What machine?

552
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,940
Uh, number 714,

553
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,074
in the intensive care unit
at Saint Andre's.

554
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:47,377
Second floor.

555
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,012
You a doctor?

556
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,847
No. I work in finance.

557
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,281
Well, what...

558
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:54,684
Carl. Honey.
I'll handle this.
It's okay.

559
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:56,219
It's 11:00, Karen.

560
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:57,687
Why the hell are you
at our house?

561
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,722
It's my house, okay?

562
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,391
Now go inside, or go home.
I'll handle this.

563
00:36:02,993 --> 00:36:04,127
It's okay. Come on.

564
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,773
I was in the neighborhood.

565
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:19,842
You shouldn't be here.

566
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:22,779
You know what?
I... I'm with someone.

567
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,847
Carl. We're together.

568
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,018
I shouldn't have called you.

569
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,054
And I shouldn't
have started following you.

570
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,188
It's very unprofessional.

571
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:39,262
What happened to you?
Your clothes...

572
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,866
I wrote this
in the car 10 minutes ago.

573
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,403
It's the last one.

574
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,273
<i> Dear Karen. Fuck Phil.</i>

575
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,308
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

576
00:37:28,812 --> 00:37:31,781
Nothing. I was supposed to
call him. We sorted it out.

577
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,319
Are you having an affair
with this guy?

578
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:40,490
No, I'm not.
He's lonely, I think.

579
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:43,392
I don't know,
he's just a little... off.

580
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,103
What time's your flight?

581
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,477
It's a good-looking
city, Karen.

582
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,112
And you could go
to tech school, like we...

583
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,113
Like we talked about.

584
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,184
I can...
I'll open up a new warehouse.

585
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,386
Twice, two times
the square footage...

586
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,822
And Chris, I mean...

587
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,357
He's struggling here,
you know?

588
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:16,259
A new start could be good.

589
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,535
<i> Dear Karen. Fuck Phil.</i>

590
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,503
<i> He called me</i>
<i> into his office...</i>

591
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,905
I pulled the plug
on lightyear.

592
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,107
What? Why?

593
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,275
Gut feeling.

594
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:36,979
To be honest, your judgment
of late has been questionable.

595
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:40,082
Well... how so, Phil?

596
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,317
Did you take apart
the lighting fixture

597
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,318
in our bathroom?

598
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,526
Yes. I did.

599
00:38:51,895 --> 00:38:52,929
And your computer?

600
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:57,867
I assume you're responsible
for the washroom stall.

601
00:38:58,869 --> 00:38:59,936
That was my work, yes.

602
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,205
Why?

603
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:06,542
Well, that's a little
harder to answer.

604
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,578
Mmm-hmm. Try me.

605
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:13,516
The bathroom stall,
for example?

606
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,521
The door was squeaking.

607
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,089
And it had probably been that
way for quite some time.

608
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,958
I just never noticed.

609
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,092
And now, I'm noticing

610
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,126
all different kinds
of things, Phil,

611
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:27,964
and I wanna see how they work.

612
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:28,898
Like that clock.

613
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,002
Pure craftsmanship. Artistry!

614
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:35,338
That belonged to my
great-grandmother. 1890s.

615
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:39,041
I wanna rip it apart and

616
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,944
spread it out
all over the floor.

617
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,314
And no offense to
your great-grandmother,

618
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,582
but I see a clock like that,

619
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,351
and I wanna know
what it looks like inside.

620
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,626
Mmm.

621
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,532
Davis.
Mmm.

622
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,470
I want you to
take some time off.

623
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:11,472
<i> Fuck him,</i>

624
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:10,072
<i> and the way he leans</i>
<i> on the corner of his desk</i>

625
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:14,074
<i> with his sleeves rolled up</i>

626
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,074
<i> like he's about</i>
<i> to dig a ditch.</i>

627
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:16,045
<i> No more imaginary</i>
<i> office ditches, Karen.</i>

628
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:18,614
<i> From now on,</i>
<i> it's me and my tools.</i>

629
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,450
<i> I intended to drive home</i>

630
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,119
<i> but accidentally turned</i>
<i> for the midtown tunnel.</i>

631
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,620
Ruby drive...

632
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,989
<i> Maybe there are no accidents.</i>

633
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,426
<i> Anyway, it seemed like a good</i>
<i> time to come and look for you.</i>

634
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,428
<i> Turn left on crystal Avenue.</i>

635
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,963
<i> I knew I was getting close</i>

636
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,965
<i> when I found myself</i>
<i> in a neighborhood</i>

637
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,700
<i> where all the streets were</i>
<i> named after precious stones.</i>

638
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:40,136
<i> And that's when I saw it.</i>

639
00:40:42,105 --> 00:40:43,306
Hey! You the insurance guy?

640
00:40:44,074 --> 00:40:46,275
Oh, no. Not me.

641
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,276
I thought... you know,
i just saw the suit,

642
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,377
so I figured, you know...

643
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,012
Yeah, I was just driving by,

644
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,515
and I, uh, saw you guys
working. Looks like fun.

645
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:54,350
Yeah, fun.

646
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:55,318
Um...

647
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,187
What exactly
are you doing here?

648
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,188
Well, we gotta tear
the whole thing down

649
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,156
before they rebuild.

650
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,693
Can I, uh, help you out?

651
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,528
What...

652
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,229
I mean, you just, you know,
you just tell me

653
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:08,497
what to do,
you don't have to pay me.

654
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,535
Come on, pal, don't bust
my balls, all right?

655
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:16,537
You're the insurance guy,
right?

656
00:41:12,537 --> 00:41:15,037
Barry sent you over here
to bust my balls?

657
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:15,705
No, I don't know who Barry is.

658
00:41:16,506 --> 00:41:18,107
No, I... you know, I...

659
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,009
Actually, you know,
I'll pay you, huh?

660
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,545
How 'bout, uh, 50...
I'll give you 50 bucks.

661
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:26,547
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What kinda shit

662
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:26,547
you trying to pull here, pal?

663
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:27,616
No, no, no, I'm not a cop.
I... I just wanna help.

664
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,719
You know what, I'll...
You know, I'll give you, uh...

665
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,321
I'll give you $241.

666
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,023
Go on, take it.
I'll work hard.

667
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

668
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:47,536
No, no. No, don't use that,
don't use that.

669
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,573
Here. Put these on,
use this...

670
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:51,607
Now knock the wall down.

671
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,338
This guy's a fuckin' animal.

672
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,273
He's probably a crackhead.

673
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:26,142
Crackheads don't
give people $200.

674
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:28,244
They suck dick for $20.

675
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,512
I mean, you should know.

676
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,357
Yeah, don't ask,
it's embarrassing.

677
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,427
I, uh, closed the car door
on my jacket,

678
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,529
and your sprinklers turned on.

679
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:23,732
<i> Then, the stupid lock...</i>

680
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,135
It sometimes gets stuck...
I couldn't...

681
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:27,203
You're high, aren't you?

682
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:29,305
A little bit...

683
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:36,312
D'you want some
grilled cheese?

684
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:42,785
I needed some work overalls.

685
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,820
I guess I got a little carried
away at the army surplus.

686
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,859
Your whole house is just

687
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:53,395
lovely.

688
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,531
Aside from the appliances,

689
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,333
it's the kind of house
people dream of living in.

690
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,200
I hate this house.

691
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:01,570
It's just shiny stuff.

692
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:31,433
I can't have sex with you.
It'd be dangerous.

693
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,368
There's that word again.

694
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,771
Is Carl really out of town,

695
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:37,273
or did you just chop him up
into little pieces

696
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,774
and stuff him
in your sock drawer?

697
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:42,244
That's ridiculous.
I don't have a sock drawer.

698
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,813
Well... where do you
keep all your socks?

699
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,348
In the same drawer
as my underwear.

700
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:50,686
What?

701
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:56,825
I just...
You know, I just think

702
00:44:56,827 --> 00:45:00,396
a woman's underwear
is deserving of its own space.

703
00:45:08,939 --> 00:45:09,972
This is all I can handle.

704
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,540
That's fine.

705
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,377
Let's just
fall asleep together.

706
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,780
Together?

707
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:18,914
Together apart.

708
00:45:25,555 --> 00:45:26,722
I'm not in love with Carl,
you know.

709
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,392
He's a good man. He really is.

710
00:45:32,662 --> 00:45:35,698
He loves me.
Probably more than he should.

711
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:41,971
But I dunno...

712
00:45:48,778 --> 00:45:51,313
I'd like to be
able to do what you do.

713
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,848
To be completely honest.

714
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,552
I think you just were.

715
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,489
Not even close.

716
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:27,616
You must be Chris.

717
00:46:29,552 --> 00:46:30,386
You fuckin' my mom?

718
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:35,057
No, I'm not.
We were just sleeping...

719
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,426
She's fuckin' crazy.

720
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:40,596
If you haven't noticed,
she's a fuckin' pot head.

721
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:41,930
She calls it cannabis
'cause it makes her

722
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,565
feel like less of
a fuckin' pothead.

723
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,800
You say "fuck" a lot.

724
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,702
So?

725
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:47,870
So you're just
not using it properly.

726
00:46:49,572 --> 00:46:50,372
The fuck does that mean?

727
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:52,808
That's what I mean.

728
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:55,511
"Fuck" is a great word,

729
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:57,913
but if you use it too much,
then it just loses its value.

730
00:46:58,715 --> 00:46:59,648
And you sound stupid.

731
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,417
Fuck you.

732
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,552
Exactly.

733
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,554
I feel nothing,
and you sound like an idiot.

734
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,422
Have a good one!

735
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:07,923
Who the...

736
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:17,366
<i> Hi.</i>
<i> You've reached Davis Mitchell.</i>

737
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:20,336
<i> I'm unavailable at the moment,</i>
<i> so please leave a message.</i>

738
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,404
<i> If you're looking for Julia,</i>

739
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,541
<i> I regret to inform you that</i>
<i> she isn't with us anymore,</i>

740
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,109
<i> which makes her</i>
<i> also unavailable.</i>

741
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,714
<i> Davis,</i>
<i> you've taken things too far.</i>

742
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:34,950
<i> I am deeply concerned</i>
<i> with your well-being.</i>

743
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,052
<i> I'm trying to</i>
<i> reach out to you,</i>

744
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,755
<i> I'm trying to help,</i>
<i> but you refuse!</i>

745
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:41,690
<i> If you don't</i>
<i> wish to participate</i>

746
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,959
<i> in the architecture</i>
<i> of your wife's legacy,</i>

747
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:45,027
<i> then so be it.</i>

748
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,528
<i> Just contact me</i>

749
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,697
<i> so I can free you</i>
<i> from this burden.</i>

750
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,400
<i> One more thing.</i>
<i> If you have any respect</i>

751
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:53,035
<i> for the memory of my daughter,</i>

752
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,970
<i> you'll erase</i>
<i> that fucking message.</i>

753
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,710
<i> This is Karen,</i>
<i> customer service.</i>

754
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,645
<i> Hello, Karen,</i>
<i> customer service.</i>

755
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,648
Hello, mister Mitchell,
what can I do for you today?

756
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,684
<i> This might sound crazy,</i>

757
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:10,953
but there's a station wagon
that's been stalking me

758
00:48:10,955 --> 00:48:12,654
for the past couple of days,

759
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:15,557
and this does raise
a number of concerns,

760
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,694
including "a," why would
anyone be following me?

761
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:21,797
"B," am I possibly in
some kind of danger?

762
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,833
And "c,"

763
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,969
who the fuck still drives
a station wagon?

764
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:44,119
This is where you get
your prescription filled?

765
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,522
Okay, I lied.
It's not a prescription.

766
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,036
Hey, ray.
This is my friend Davis.

767
00:49:02,071 --> 00:49:03,472
Hello, young man.

768
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,746
Ah, my favorite kind.
Thank you.

769
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:17,019
And this is for you.

770
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,657
It grows wild in my garden.
Don't ask me how.

771
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:25,060
I never touch the stuff.
Makes me think too much.

772
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,129
How 'bout you? You need some?

773
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,063
Oh, no.

774
00:49:29,899 --> 00:49:32,801
Oh, that beauty
arrived in 1961.

775
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,504
From Paris.

776
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:40,542
You should've seen 'er.
A real masterpiece.

777
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:43,879
Look at that, huh?

778
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:46,548
Ain't that a beauty?

779
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,787
But nobody wants
carousels anymore.

780
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,522
They want roller coasters

781
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,557
that go upside down
and make you puke.

782
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:59,061
Would you believe
we've got to tear it down?

783
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,596
Really?

784
00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:02,764
Yeah. Too many repairs.
Too much money.

785
00:50:02,766 --> 00:50:04,099
Can I help you?
I have my own tools.

786
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:07,936
You're very strange...

787
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:28,824
Whoo!

788
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,081
You got it! You got it!

789
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:54,750
Oh!

790
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,290
Karen moreno,
ladies and gentlemen!

791
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,306
Julia loved the ocean.

792
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,809
We used to spend our summers

793
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,210
at her folks' place
in east Hampton.

794
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,179
That's where she wanted to be.

795
00:51:28,217 --> 00:51:29,117
You miss her?

796
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:38,787
So. Where exactly
are you feeling numb?

797
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,255
Sort of in this whole
area right in here.

798
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:44,393
And how long have you
been feeling like this?

799
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,429
Can't say...

800
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:50,332
Ten or twelve years.

801
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,417
Davis... not sure
how to tell you this.

802
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,687
Come on. See for yourself.

803
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,993
Part of your heart is missing.

804
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,160
What?
How did that happen?

805
00:53:19,295 --> 00:53:21,029
Judging by the bite pattern,

806
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,934
I'd say gypsy moths.

807
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,202
Fuck me.

808
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,236
Excuse me?

809
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,183
<i> Dear Karen, I keep</i>
<i> thinking about my childhood.</i>

810
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,052
<i> When I was sick,</i>
<i> and I would lay my head</i>

811
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,053
<i> in my mother's lap,</i>

812
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,989
<i> she'd run her fingers</i>
<i> through my hair.</i>

813
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,325
<i> She'd kiss my eyelids.</i>

814
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,161
<i> And that made</i>
<i> everything better.</i>

815
00:53:55,965 --> 00:53:56,998
<i> Do you think</i>
<i> it's too late for that?</i>

816
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:57,259
Live here now or something?

817
00:54:58,494 --> 00:55:00,128
No. Shouldn't you
be in school?

818
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:02,330
I'm suspended.

819
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:04,499
For what?

820
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:06,868
Telling the truth.

821
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,338
Had to do this presentation
in world affairs.

822
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:15,443
About our military presence
in the middle east.

823
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,345
Yeah?
What do you know about it?

824
00:55:24,153 --> 00:55:25,487
June 5th.

825
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,858
During a routine patrol
through the helmand province,

826
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,397
lieutenant Dan doviak's Hummer

827
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:36,965
pulled over
to the side of the road

828
00:55:38,868 --> 00:55:40,368
to assist a little girl.

829
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:46,107
To their surprise,
she had 60 pounds

830
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,442
of explosives
strapped to her body.

831
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,984
Oh, shit.

832
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,452
The Hummer was
engulfed in flames.

833
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,463
And the Afghan
citizens chanted,

834
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,166
"death to America."

835
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:12,901
Doviak and his unit
were burned alive.

836
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:18,073
They suspend you
for that?

837
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,086
I heard
the dinner bell.

838
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,363
Did you
have a good day?

839
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,967
Enjoy your little vacay?

840
00:56:48,537 --> 00:56:50,405
I'm changing the music, baby.

841
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,116
Come on, lighten up.
Tell me what you did today.

842
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:04,019
Did you hang out
with that cute girl?

843
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,655
The one with
the high-waisted jeans?

844
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:08,323
You know, not everyone
can pull that look off.

845
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:09,624
Right?

846
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:13,328
Are you for real right now?

847
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:22,137
I spoke with your principal,
miss... tersian?

848
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:27,409
I found her to be very
thoughtful and empathetic.

849
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:30,512
The good news is,
she's letting you

850
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,580
come back starting Monday.

851
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,349
You have to spend a few weeks
with the counselor,

852
00:57:34,351 --> 00:57:36,217
but I think you're
getting off pretty easy.

853
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,087
What's the bad news?

854
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:39,955
What do you mean?

855
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,992
What the hell
are you talking about?

856
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:45,694
There's some random guy
eating in our house

857
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:48,263
while your boyfriend/boss
is out of town,

858
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:49,731
and you're bragging to me
about a heart-to-heart you had

859
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:51,299
with my dyke principal?

860
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:55,003
Would you just...
Okay? Gimme a break!

861
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:59,207
Davis is a friend of mine.

862
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,342
We've been
spending time together

863
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:01,309
because that's
what friends do.

864
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,111
You... you spend time.

865
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:06,047
You're so transparent.

866
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:09,050
The man's wife just died.

867
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,585
Have some compassion,
you little shit!

868
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:21,463
I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry.

869
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:33,208
Your wife just died?

870
00:58:34,543 --> 00:58:35,477
Yeah.

871
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:42,518
How?

872
00:58:42,518 --> 00:58:45,520
Massive head trauma,
car accident.

873
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:46,755
Can you pass the salt?

874
00:58:57,633 --> 00:58:59,634
I was thinking about
what you said about

875
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,436
how I'm not using
the f-word properly.

876
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:06,041
Yeah? What'd you come up with?

877
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,577
Maybe you're right.

878
00:59:18,687 --> 00:59:19,687
<i> Fuck</i>

879
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,623
<i> is a</i>

880
00:59:22,391 --> 00:59:24,359
<i> great word.</i>

881
00:59:25,594 --> 00:59:26,528
<i> Fuck</i>

882
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,830
<i> is a</i>

883
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,633
<i> great word.</i>

884
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,635
<i> Fuck...</i>
Ahh!

885
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:38,573
Oh, man,
that don't look good at all.

886
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,707
No, it don't.

887
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,379
You dumbass...

888
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,688
Oh, god damn
that fuckin' hurt!

889
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:55,590
Whoa!

890
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,125
Shit, yeah!

891
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:01,129
Whoo!

892
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,497
Let's go.
Get outta here.

893
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:06,367
<i> Dear Chris...</i>

894
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:11,773
<i> I wish I could talk to you.</i>

895
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,376
<i> I miss how we used to be.</i>

896
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,315
<i> I miss holding you,</i>
<i> kissing your face...</i>

897
01:00:25,387 --> 01:00:26,588
<i> I miss my little boy.</i>

898
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,509
Where did
you send this from?

899
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,877
From the mailbox
on the corner.

900
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:52,213
I thought the last one
was the last one.

901
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:57,485
What do we do
with a couch like this?

902
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,325
Mmm, kiss me!

903
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,660
Ooh, that feels good!

904
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,802
Okay, listen to me.

905
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,738
When was the last time

906
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,174
you really, really
cared about something?

907
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:23,611
Like, when you were a kid.

908
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,713
What was the most
important thing to you?

909
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,254
Running fast. Yup.

910
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,323
We used to race on blacktop
at recess,

911
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:38,626
and then I was always so slow.

912
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:45,667
Just once,
i wanted to beat 'em all,

913
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:46,968
and blow 'em all away.

914
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,636
Have 'em cheer for me,

915
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:49,938
and not Rick russoman
or Mike barone,

916
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,407
and those speedy
motherfuckers.

917
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,746
Yep.
I just wanted to run fast,

918
01:01:58,748 --> 01:02:00,248
more than anything.

919
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:02,917
I mean,
more than break dancing.

920
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,289
Yeah...

921
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,450
Jesus! Can't I get
a little privacy?
Whoa! Sorry, man! I thought...

922
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:16,684
I thought you were
back in school!

923
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,685
I'm taking a personal day.

924
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,055
What is that?

925
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,125
Nothing.

926
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,026
Let's see.

927
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:31,833
It's Carl's.

928
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:37,839
Ever shot a gun before?

929
01:04:53,088 --> 01:04:54,422
Your turn.

930
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:14,809
Let's shoot something.

931
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,844
Like what?

932
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:19,914
I dunno.
A deer or something.

933
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,182
I don't think
there are any out here.

934
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,118
What about a squirrel?

935
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,055
Hold on a second.

936
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,207
You sure that thing's legit?

937
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,510
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

938
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,881
Ready?
Yeah.

939
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:55,817
Want me to count down,
or like...

940
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:56,984
I dunno, do
whatever you want.

941
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:57,785
Okay, I'll surprise you.

942
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,454
Surprise me.

943
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:04,926
Safety's on.

944
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:08,129
Yup, it's on the left side.

945
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,465
Yeah, you gotta switch...
Turn...

946
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,632
Ahh!
Shit.

947
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:21,776
What'd it feel like?

948
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,678
Shit-yeah!

949
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,013
Whoo!

950
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,549
It hurt, but in like a...

951
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,053
It's like a good kinda hurt.

952
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:33,721
It felt like someone
was kinda, um...

953
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,224
Whoa.

954
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:38,593
Surprise!

955
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:45,566
You are...
You are one fucked-up kid.

956
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:46,901
You're one fucked-up adult.

957
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:50,972
Don't ever do this again.

958
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:54,075
Fuck!

959
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:56,010
You're trying too hard.

960
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,867
And set to go.

961
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:55,870
Thank you, dude.

962
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:00,067
Ah!

963
01:09:00,902 --> 01:09:02,837
Excuse me! Sir?

964
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:04,672
Excuse me! Sir!
Do you have an appointment?

965
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:07,108
No, Marty,
I'm just swingin' through!

966
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:09,043
Oh, Mr. Mitchell. Sorry.

967
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:10,845
Hey, buddy.

968
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:12,680
Davis!
Phil here?

969
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:13,814
Yeah, they're doing
the interviews

970
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,883
for the scholarship
candidates!

971
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:19,720
Mister big!
You better watch out!

972
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,722
...breathing. It's just
me and the water, and...

973
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:27,061
Sorry.

974
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:30,064
- Hey, guys.
- Excuse us.

975
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:32,333
Hey, Davis.

976
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,668
We're in the middle
of something.

977
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,302
Mind if I sit?

978
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:36,237
Hi, margot.

979
01:09:38,373 --> 01:09:40,107
You okay, pal?

980
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:41,342
You look like you've been

981
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:45,344
doing construction
or something.

982
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:44,278
Steve. I got a fucking nail
in my foot.

983
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,446
It hurt like hell,
but I'm okay now.

984
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,149
So, Todd,
you were saying?

985
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,052
Right. Um...

986
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:55,056
Lost my train of thought.

987
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:56,357
We won.

988
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:57,958
Oh.
What'd you win?

989
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,294
Swimming. I'm a swimmer.

990
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:03,364
Ah.
Do you swim?

991
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,366
You know,
i used to do laps at the y

992
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,101
and then I realized
how many people

993
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,903
must urinate in that pool
on a daily basis,

994
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,971
and that kinda
ruined it for me.

995
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,073
Yeah.

996
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,142
I don't understand
where this is coming from.

997
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:19,747
This contempt,
this blatant disrespect!

998
01:10:19,749 --> 01:10:21,282
Well, something
doesn't feel right, Phil.

999
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:23,984
This whole thing, you know?

1000
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,720
I wanna do something for her,
but this just doesn't...

1001
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:27,054
You are not feeling right!

1002
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:34,195
We're picking
the finalists today.

1003
01:10:35,964 --> 01:10:38,065
I want it signed
on my desk by tomorrow,

1004
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,201
or you're done here.

1005
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:43,938
I mean, we're done.

1006
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:23,944
Why you buying all this shit?

1007
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:28,516
Uh, the tools of the trade,
my young friend.

1008
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:30,451
What trade would that be?

1009
01:11:35,023 --> 01:11:37,391
Destruction, devastation.

1010
01:11:39,027 --> 01:11:41,195
I mean, haven't you
ever wanted to just

1011
01:11:41,197 --> 01:11:42,830
smash the shit
out of something?

1012
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,071
Davis, if I were to
ask you a question,

1013
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,940
you'd give me
a straight answer, right?

1014
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,142
I mean, that's your thing,
being honest about everything.

1015
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,045
Yeah, that's my thing.

1016
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:03,918
Do you think I'm gay?

1017
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:12,960
I dunno, Chris.

1018
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:17,832
Do you think you're gay?

1019
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,302
I dunno. I think maybe.
I figured you would tell me.

1020
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:24,205
Okay. Let's figure it
out together.

1021
01:12:25,907 --> 01:12:26,574
Do you like girls?

1022
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,443
I dunno.

1023
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:32,279
I think Jennifer hymen's
pretty. She flirts with me.

1024
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,881
And sometimes,
i can see the outline

1025
01:12:33,883 --> 01:12:36,517
of her bra through
her shirt, but...

1026
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,353
I dunno if I like her,
or if I'm just fixating.

1027
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,554
Jennifer hymen.
That's really her name?

1028
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:43,257
Yeah.
That fuckin' blows.

1029
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:46,994
What about the boys at school?

1030
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:48,362
Is there anybody
that you like,

1031
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,263
that you find attractive?

1032
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,600
Maybe Andrew white.

1033
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:54,235
He's a junior,

1034
01:12:54,237 --> 01:12:55,936
and we have
the same gym class too.

1035
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,404
We have to get
changed together.

1036
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,205
Do you watch him
when you get changed?

1037
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,874
No.

1038
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,876
Well, then I don't think
you're gay, Chris.

1039
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:03,911
I have to try not to look.
I have to tell myself not to.

1040
01:13:05,413 --> 01:13:07,248
Yeah, no, that's normal,
you know.

1041
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,150
I mean you're young,
and you're curious, it's...

1042
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:11,485
Sometimes, I imagine
his dick in my mouth.

1043
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:14,889
Oh.

1044
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:19,493
That's different.

1045
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:26,166
Uh, I would say that
you're probably gay.

1046
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:28,369
I mean, you know,
or you're bisexual.

1047
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:31,572
But I mean, either way, you're
gonna get tortured. Um...

1048
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,611
I mean, my advice
to you, would be

1049
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:40,314
to pretend that you like girls
for the next few years,

1050
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:43,017
and then move into
the city, you know?

1051
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,119
Or San Francisco?

1052
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,254
Or even Los Angeles,
if you like warm weather.

1053
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,393
Anything else?

1054
01:13:52,395 --> 01:13:53,394
No.

1055
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,334
Get in.

1056
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:04,405
Ah!

1057
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:06,707
Whoa!

1058
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:12,547
What are we doing again?

1059
01:14:12,547 --> 01:14:14,048
We're taking apart
my marriage.

1060
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,163
Yeah.

1061
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:53,647
Fuckin' a.

1062
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,685
Not bad. Keep at it.

1063
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:36,623
Now hold it.
Just like that.

1064
01:16:42,497 --> 01:16:43,530
Who's that?

1065
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:57,411
Who the fuck still drives
a station wagon?

1066
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:03,717
No, I just wanna have it...
I wanna take it back home,

1067
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,720
see what it looks like in the
library or, uh, in the study.

1068
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,657
Nope, not a peep out of him.

1069
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,459
Lawyers are exploring
other options.

1070
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:13,560
We'll get him to sign.

1071
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:16,497
Did you send him
an invitation?

1072
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:18,699
Oh, come on, honey.

1073
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:27,808
Davis picked me up
after school.

1074
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,645
Hey. Uh, he was helping me
around my house. Housework...

1075
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:33,780
Hey.

1076
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:43,690
Thank you.

1077
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:18,559
A bulldozer.

1078
01:18:20,428 --> 01:18:21,895
You know, you can buy
almost anything on ebay.

1079
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,631
I just hope it comes
with a manual.

1080
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:38,879
Hey... shit.

1081
01:18:40,616 --> 01:18:42,416
A manual and a warranty.

1082
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:50,837
She was so young.

1083
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,508
Hey, uh...

1084
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,709
Phil would like to
talk to you immediately.

1085
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,181
I'll be right back, okay?

1086
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:02,115
Okay.

1087
01:22:24,038 --> 01:22:25,205
Hey there.

1088
01:22:28,075 --> 01:22:29,810
Oof!

1089
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:33,013
Why you smoking that garbage?
I got something nice.

1090
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:37,784
I'm Todd. Do you swim?

1091
01:22:41,789 --> 01:22:43,089
You dare...

1092
01:22:43,091 --> 01:22:45,158
Bringing another
woman here? Tonight?

1093
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:46,193
Phil, it's not
what you think...

1094
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,928
How fuckin' dare you?

1095
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,630
Every day!
I wake up thinking, why her?

1096
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:55,168
It should've been you!

1097
01:23:14,755 --> 01:23:15,789
Signed.

1098
01:23:22,997 --> 01:23:24,197
So, Karen.

1099
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:28,969
Can I feel your tits?

1100
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,816
Julia's mother and I,
and her husband,

1101
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:44,551
would like to thank you all

1102
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,820
for sharing
this special evening.

1103
01:23:48,022 --> 01:23:50,223
For those of you who were
fortunate enough

1104
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,726
to be a part of Julia's life,

1105
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:56,763
you know what a wonderful
person she was.

1106
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:57,731
Yeah, everything's fine.

1107
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:58,832
A beautiful soul.

1108
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,007
So many memories.

1109
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:13,013
Wouldn't even know
where to begin.

1110
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,617
But I do know this.

1111
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,319
I would trade
every one of them

1112
01:24:19,321 --> 01:24:21,555
for one more minute
with our daughter.

1113
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:26,026
Julia brought out
the best in people.

1114
01:24:26,028 --> 01:24:27,727
That was her gift.

1115
01:24:27,729 --> 01:24:29,162
Now, through

1116
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:32,599
the Julia Eastwood-Mitchell
scholarship fund,

1117
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:36,236
that gift will be her legacy.

1118
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:46,680
I'd like to introduce
three young adults

1119
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:48,949
so outstanding
in their character

1120
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,717
and academic achievements

1121
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,854
that we couldn't choose
just one recipient.

1122
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,324
So please welcome
our first-year scholars:

1123
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:58,858
Jennifer Williams.

1124
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,197
Benjamin Howard!

1125
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:07,834
And the backstroke
record-holder himself,

1126
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:08,935
Todd koehler!

1127
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:11,905
Thank you.

1128
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:20,347
Sorry.

1129
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,288
Did she tell you
she was pregnant?

1130
01:25:30,725 --> 01:25:31,658
Last year.

1131
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:33,960
Did you know?

1132
01:25:40,067 --> 01:25:41,101
Why didn't she tell me?

1133
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:51,244
You wanna know why?

1134
01:25:54,849 --> 01:25:55,915
It wasn't yours.

1135
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:02,856
She was seeing someone.

1136
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:05,992
And I took her
for the procedure.

1137
01:26:09,063 --> 01:26:10,196
I wish she'd kept it.

1138
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:38,084
Here's your refund.

1139
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:39,819
Keep the change.

1140
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,294
<i> Davis.</i>

1141
01:27:50,397 --> 01:27:51,464
Davis.

1142
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:56,336
Hey. I'm sorry.

1143
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:58,772
How is he?

1144
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:02,809
They're not saying much.
He's, uh, still in surgery.

1145
01:28:05,112 --> 01:28:07,947
It was six of them
beating the shit out of him.

1146
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,353
I feel like it's all my fault.

1147
01:28:14,488 --> 01:28:16,856
I had one fuckin' job.

1148
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:17,857
Miss moreno!

1149
01:28:28,335 --> 01:28:30,537
Baby? Hey.

1150
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:33,072
Honey?

1151
01:28:35,377 --> 01:28:37,110
Listen to me.

1152
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,378
I won't let anyone
hurt you ever again.

1153
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,947
And I won't hurt you either.

1154
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,852
I just want you to be
who you are.

1155
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,020
You hear me?

1156
01:28:49,089 --> 01:28:51,024
I'll do better, I promise.

1157
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:57,564
And when you wake up,
you are in so much trouble.

1158
01:29:04,371 --> 01:29:05,572
Thank you.

1159
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:39,606
What's your name?

1160
01:29:41,308 --> 01:29:42,342
Michael.

1161
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:45,945
I know about
everything, Michael.

1162
01:29:48,148 --> 01:29:49,349
And it's okay.

1163
01:29:52,653 --> 01:29:55,121
I just hope that
you cared for her

1164
01:29:55,123 --> 01:29:56,923
because she deserved that.

1165
01:29:59,293 --> 01:30:01,961
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1166
01:30:04,431 --> 01:30:05,598
I was in the other car.

1167
01:30:09,303 --> 01:30:10,637
I was, uh...

1168
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:13,973
Driving the car
that hit you.

1169
01:30:18,946 --> 01:30:20,580
And I've been
trying to, um...

1170
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:24,117
I've been trying...

1171
01:30:27,221 --> 01:30:29,088
I'm sorry.
It's okay, man.

1172
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,223
I'm so sorry.
It's okay, man.

1173
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:09,662
"Not my chair,
not my problem."

1174
01:31:09,664 --> 01:31:10,563
Is that what you say?

1175
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:05,618
You got two minutes.

1176
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:09,756
Thank you for
meeting me, Phil.

1177
01:32:12,092 --> 01:32:13,292
I'm sorry.

1178
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:16,696
Um...

1179
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:21,367
There was love
between me and Julia.

1180
01:32:24,438 --> 01:32:26,105
I just didn't
take care of it.

1181
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:32,245
I think the
scholarship is...

1182
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:34,147
It's good.
I think that it's good.

1183
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:35,581
I understand it. Um...

1184
01:32:36,683 --> 01:32:38,451
But I wanna do
something else for her.

1185
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:43,756
And, uh, I was
wondering if, um...

1186
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:49,228
You'd wanna be
a part of it.

1187
01:33:05,579 --> 01:33:06,712
Could I...

1188
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:07,547
Go ahead, have a seat.

1189
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,615
<i> Dear Davis,</i>
<i> thanks for your letter.</i>

1190
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:25,484
<i> I'm recovering slowly</i>
<i> but surely.</i>

1191
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,288
<i> Despite the ass-kicking,</i>
<i> I must say,</i>

1192
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:30,523
<i> being myself feels good.</i>

1193
01:35:31,758 --> 01:35:34,594
<i> By the way,</i>
<i> mom left Carl, fyi.</i>

1194
01:35:34,596 --> 01:35:36,829
Ten! Nine! Eight!

1195
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:37,964
<i> I have a little gift for you.</i>

1196
01:35:37,966 --> 01:35:39,932
Seven! Six! Five! Four!

1197
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:42,668
<i> Be at pier 64 this Saturday</i>
<i> at 11:00 A.M. sharp.</i>

1198
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,637
Three! Two! One!

1199
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:45,805
<i> Trust me.</i>

1200
01:35:52,412 --> 01:35:53,679
Yeah!

1201
01:36:04,524 --> 01:36:06,859
<i> P.S. Go fuck yourself.</i>

1202
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:34,593
<i> Warmest regards,</i>
<i> Davis c. Mitchell.</i>
