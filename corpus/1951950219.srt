1
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,581
Fidencio!

2
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,984
Shut all the doors!

3
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,489
I'll be with this woman.

4
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,083
- Hail Mary.
- Conceived without sin.

5
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,152
How long since your last
confession, daughter?

6
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:44,053
Father Salvador, it's Esperanza,
the mother of the girl who died.

7
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:47,024
Except she's not dead, Father.

8
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,593
What?

9
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,259
SaintJude told me.
My saint of desperate causes.

10
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,769
IThappened righTafter The funeral.

11
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:14,947
Look Dominga, how come I'm always
the one who ends up fixing dinner?

12
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,329
Esperanza.

13
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:37,637
Whoever told you your daughter died
of this unknown disease, lied to you.

14
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,619
Thank God I'd run out
of Easy-Off, Father.

15
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,085
If I hadn't, where the hell
could my saint have appeared?

16
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,816
That oven is so grimy, it's embarrassing.

17
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,916
What should I do, Father?
Clean it or leave it as it is?

18
00:04:55,028 --> 00:05:00,125
For now let's keep
this miracle a secret.

19
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,430
Leave the oven as it is.

20
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,664
This kind of filth is not a sin.

21
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:10,231
Do you have a filthy sin to confess?

22
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:11,970
Not really.

23
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,138
Except cursing at my friend Soledad.
But it's not fair, Father!

24
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,685
I work all day in the hardware store
and come home to a pile of ironing,

25
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:22,084
and she's camped
in front of her soap opera.

26
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:26,648
Well, when you're hooked on a soap,
you're hooked.

27
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,922
Like me with Tania's Promise.
Do you watch it?

28
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,430
No, Father. I don't watch soaps.

29
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,969
All right, then.Just try
to understand your friend Soledad.

30
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,036
And say five rosaries,just in case.

31
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,340
And not a word about our miracle...

32
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,743
to anyone!

33
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,314
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

34
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,908
Amen.

35
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,718
Hey, Father, can I tell Soledad?

36
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,621
- No!
-Just her, I promise.

37
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,284
Not even her.

38
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,862
- Father, don't be such a--
- What?

39
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,993
How can I keep it from her?

40
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,901
You know we've lived together
since our husbands died.

41
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,804
We're like sisters.
We raised Blanca together.

42
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:20,242
You need a lot of faith to believe
in miracles, and not everybody has it.

43
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,813
By the type of apparition, it's clear
your saint wants only you to see him.

44
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:28,045
Otherwise he'd appear
before everybody...

45
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:33,023
on the side of the bridge,
like SaintJohn did five years ago.

46
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,517
- Where were you?
- You scared me!

47
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,725
The Espinozas came to give you their
condolences. I didn't know what to say.

48
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,461
I went to see Father Salvador.

49
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,994
So much grief.

50
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,508
What are we going to do with it?

51
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,572
We've been crying for no reason.

52
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:04,848
What?

53
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,353
Blanca is not dead.

54
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,251
What are you saying?

55
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,655
SaintJude told me. In person.

56
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,192
For God's sake, Esperanza.

57
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,058
- You're all I have left.
- Yes.

58
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,460
Don't go crazy on me, please!

59
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,046
SaintJude, you know I'm not crazy.

60
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,687
I just want my Blanca back.

61
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,144
I wore This slip
aTmy fifteenTh birthday, darling.

62
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,546
I'd stitch it a bit shorter.

63
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,279
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

64
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,289
Don't tell me you filled this out, Mom.

65
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,951
One always finds a way.

66
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,027
You'll see...

67
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,756
when you're fifteen you'll fill it out.

68
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:28,664
I'm sure God will give you
the breasts of an angel.

69
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,427
- It's really shaping up.
- It is.

70
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,837
I'm going to try the mantilla on you.

71
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,843
SainTJude,
you've always been aTmy side.

72
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,281
Tell me where my daughter is.

73
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,788
If all this is a lie,

74
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,347
Then she wasn'Tin The hospiTal
when I wenT To pick her up.

75
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,542
Good afternoon.

76
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,480
Afternoon. What's up?

77
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:26,080
I came to pick up my daughter.
Is this where you pay?

78
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,989
What's the patient's name?

79
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,289
Blanca Diaz. I'm her mother.

80
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,293
Hi.

81
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,129
Blanca Diaz.

82
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,033
Blanca Diaz.

83
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,671
She had her tonsils out.

84
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,373
Mrs. Diaz, haven't you been notified?

85
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,183
No. What happened?

86
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,849
You'd better go find Dr. Ortiz.

87
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,830
Doctor! Excuse me.

88
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm so glad I found you, Doctor.
How is Blanca?

89
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,239
We don't know what happened...

90
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,914
but your daughter passed away.

91
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:36,461
Blanca.

92
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,189
Easy.

93
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,300
I got the news when I came in.

94
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,546
They have her in the morgue.

95
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,582
Can I see her?

96
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,489
I'm afraid not, Esperanza.

97
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:45,724
She died of a virus we're not
familiar with. We can't let it spread.

98
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,595
She has to be buried immediately.

99
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:58,166
Sign here, please. Here.

100
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,550
And your initials here.

101
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,448
Thanks.

102
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,523
Let them out.

103
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,422
But I have to see her, please!

104
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,735
''Do not open. Danger of contagion.''

105
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,640
Esperanza.

106
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,369
- I'm very sorry.
- Idiot!

107
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,274
Oh, dear!

108
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,506
SainTJude, are you lisTening?

109
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:42,212
You know I'll do
whatever you ask me to.

110
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,052
Are you listening?

111
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,420
Sorry I'm late, Father. It was my turn
to close the hardware store.

112
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,056
- Hello, Fidencio.
- How have you been, my child?

113
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,771
If I tell you SaintJude has reappeared,
can you keep it quiet?

114
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,340
Fidencio, leave us alone.

115
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,438
This time he appeared when I was
baking stuffed chicken breasts.

116
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,048
Esperanza, you must find your daughter.

117
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,851
Yes, SaintJude, but how?

118
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,219
Search for her.
Whatever it takes, find her.

119
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,131
Search for her!

120
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,336
I'm positive she's not there.

121
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,564
Impossible.

122
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,300
But Sir, it's my daughter!

123
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,036
I'm sorry, but I can't authorize
an exhumation,

124
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,578
even if God Almighty
orders it himself.

125
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,808
It was SaintJude.
Don't get confused! It's not the same.

126
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,942
All I ask is that you
open the casket...

127
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,849
to see if the body is there or not.
That's all.

128
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,422
Without orders
from the Forensic Service...

129
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,491
I can't exhume a little finger.

130
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,688
And don't lean on my desk,
can't you see the glass is broken!

131
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,663
I'll walk you to the door.
There's more people waiting.

132
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,862
If it was your daughter, you'd be
digging her grave with your fingernails!

133
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,868
What's wrong with you?

134
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,805
What do you want? A bribe?
Want to take your little bite?

135
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,806
Police!

136
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:51,605
I should have you arrested!
Crazy bitch!

137
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:55,676
Why do I need a permit,
with an order from above?

138
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,890
For God's sake, daughTer.!

139
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,554
I'm only following the orders
from my little saint.

140
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,634
What do you think, Father?

141
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,033
I think...

142
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,595
there's nothing more
to be done in a legal manner.

143
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,005
Just what I thought.

144
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:21,842
So I went to the doctor
for a forensic order.

145
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,414
Good morning.

146
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,479
Good morning, Mrs. Diaz.

147
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:30,418
I'm looking for Dr. Ortiz.

148
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,821
I'm afraid he doesn't work here anymore.

149
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,360
Dr. Ortiz? Are you sure?

150
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,030
Look...

151
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,589
they say he got sick
and they took him away.

152
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,465
Can some other doctor help you?

153
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,166
When did this happen?
Which day, precisely?

154
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,339
Father, can you believe he disappeared
the day after my girl died?

155
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,069
How do you explain that?

156
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:29,807
I don't know, a coincidence maybe...

157
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,383
or perhaps he caught the virus, or--

158
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,649
Or he took her! That's it!
The doctor kidnapped her!

159
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:41,385
SaintJude is right!
That's why he's a saint!

160
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,961
Careful, my child...

161
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,362
you have to know
how to read his messages.

162
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,195
It's very easy to misinterpret.

163
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,101
If you think the doctor kidnapped her,

164
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:58,006
be very careful in your search.

165
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,069
Every day I read stories like this
in the tabloids.

166
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,149
Oh, Father...

167
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,547
you mean the doctor
could have sold her into--

168
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:10,110
Don't even say it!
Don't even say it!

169
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,181
Think about what you can do.

170
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,261
Then tell me when I get back.

171
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,228
I need to excuse myself for a moment.

172
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,299
Are you going to the bathroom?

173
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,368
Yes, my child.

174
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,040
Holy Soul,
I believe the words of SaintJude...

175
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:35,943
but who did I bury?

176
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,507
Saint Anthony,
most miraculous of all...

177
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:12,050
who can find a grain of sugar
in the desert...

178
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,619
help me find my Blanca.

179
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,898
Father, what a scare you gave me!

180
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,205
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
your prayer, but it's time to close up.

181
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:43,008
Yes, yes. I'm sorry to take up
so much of your time.

182
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,913
It's all right,
my soap doesn't start until eight.

183
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,986
But just in case,

184
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,816
say five rosaries before daybreak.

185
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,720
Yes, Father.

186
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:59,423
And stay out of trouble.

187
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,297
- Remember that I'm here.
- I promise, Father.

188
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,873
Lord, I just don't know
what to do with Esperanza.

189
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:14,605
She tells me what she's done,
but not what she's about to do.

190
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,673
If nobody can stop her,
you've got to watch over her, I beg you.

191
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,310
Go away!

192
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,488
Get out of here!

193
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:29,376
Beat it! You stinking, wet dogs!

194
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:38,025
Please, Saint Isidro, don't make it
harder on me! Take the rain away!

195
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:46,230
You won't find any bones here!

196
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:54,078
Who's out there!

197
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,999
See, I told you. A grave robber.

198
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,410
Fuck off, dogs, let us work!
You get up here!

199
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,415
Leave me alone, you idiots!

200
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,814
It's my daughter in here!

201
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,888
This ground is mine!
My property!

202
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,115
I paid in perpetuity!

203
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,874
Here are your Tools back, Don Arlindo.

204
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:01,674
- I needed a hand last night--
- I don't know what's gotten into you!

205
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,079
I'm sorry, please don't get mad.
It makes you look ugly.

206
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:10,985
I've told you zillions of times
not to open the store at night!

207
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,657
And coming to work in this state!
You're a disgrace!

208
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,765
I don't know what's going on
with you, Esperanza...

209
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:24,825
and I hate to say this
after your tragedy...

210
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:28,394
but you can't work here anymore.

211
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,476
You haven't even finished the tax forms!

212
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:36,036
You're making a fool of yourself!.

213
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:39,379
Thank God!
I've been looking for you everywhere!

214
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,783
- Soledad--
- Don't even talk to me!

215
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,322
This is the last straw!

216
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:56,891
You're even in the newspaper!
What's the matter with you?

217
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:02,503
I'm only following orders from my saint.

218
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,100
Esperanza, sit down.

219
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:16,349
Look, I know we're devastated
by what happened to Blanca...

220
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,448
and sometimes we imagine things.

221
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,462
But isn't your saint
too busy with his miracles...

222
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,965
to worry about us?

223
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:36,065
You spent the night out of the house!

224
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,801
You've never done this before.

225
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,377
I went to help Father Salvador
with his herb garden.

226
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,778
I'd rather you not say anything
than tell me lies.

227
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,008
Just look at yourself,
walking around like this in public!

228
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:55,049
For the sake of your dignity,
you can't do this to yourself!.

229
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,266
Mama.

230
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,014
Mama.

231
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,848
You and I will always be TogeTher.

232
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,243
Saint Michael Archangel...

233
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:49,040
Divine Protector,
you must know that...

234
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:53,875
Blanca is in danger
and needs your help.

235
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:57,284
I've always prayed to you
for the victims of the drug lords...

236
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,847
but now I pray for my own daughter.

237
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,257
With all my strength.

238
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,738
Father, you always startle me!

239
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,033
- Do you want to confess?
- Yes.

240
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,768
Fidencio!

241
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,769
Go tell Dona Carmelita...

242
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:25,179
not to make my cocoa yet.
It'll get scummy.

243
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,789
Be with you in a second, folks.

244
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,959
Get started with your penance:
pray one rosary to begin with.

245
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:46,433
I haven't even seen you in Mass.

246
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:50,270
Father, it happened again!

247
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,842
My saint appeared for a third time...

248
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,245
to tell me my Blanca
was in a Pink House.

249
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,547
You know what he meant by that...

250
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,451
- don't you?
- Of course!

251
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,024
They must have her
in one of those dirty places...

252
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,423
one of those brothels that smell of sin,

253
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:13,190
pleasing men who come and go.

254
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,924
Men wiTh huge bellies
and lice in Their body hair.

255
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:22,837
Bricklayers wiTh repTile hands
ThaTdraw blood wiTh each caress.

256
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:27,071
Married bureaucraTs
cheaTing on Their innocenT wives.

257
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,086
Go ahead, my child.

258
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,484
Father.

259
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:42,583
Is it true they steal little girls
to sell to brothels?

260
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:47,654
Unfortunately, these types
never make it to my confessional box.

261
00:27:47,766 --> 00:27:49,825
- But they do exist?
- Yes, my child.

262
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,264
They have her living in hell!

263
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:58,505
What should I do?

264
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:02,513
You can only search for the truth.

265
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,912
Come what may.

266
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,984
That's exactly what I thought...

267
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,714
so I got a job at 'La Curva'.

268
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,984
- Have you ever been there, Father?
- Esperanza!

269
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:20,224
It's that little blue hotel
with the red door, by the hairpin turn.

270
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,082
Excuse me.

271
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,189
Excuse me.

272
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:52,930
Excuse me.

273
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,097
I changed The sheeTs and washed
The baThrooms on The second floor.

274
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,971
I had To waiTfor couples To come ouT.

275
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,044
SomeTimes I cleaned one room
eighT Times in a day.!

276
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,537
I Told Soledad
I was working in a hoTel.

277
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:16,109
IT was half True, buTI didn'T
wanTher To worry abouTme.

278
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:41,712
Catch me!

279
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:56,824
I've changed sheeTs sTained wiTh blood,

280
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,055
booze, urine.

281
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:03,624
Covers were so ripped
I had to throw them away.

282
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,033
But not a trace of Blanca.

283
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,765
I'd smell the sheets,
but never the scent of Blanca.

284
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,670
For God's sake, daughter!

285
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,310
I want to confess on her behalf.

286
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:21,249
Forgive her. She must not be able
to come close to a church.

287
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:25,982
You know that I can't absolve
through third party confessions.

288
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:29,890
Don't be a pain, Father.
What have you got to lose?

289
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,953
I'll give her a temporary absolution...

290
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,761
until she can come in person.

291
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:41,005
So, do you know where she could be?

292
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,903
More or less.

293
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,067
I finally got a clue...

294
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,811
in 'La Curva;

295
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:09,626
Sure, they've got them young.

296
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,861
Really hot, too.

297
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,938
I don't believe you.

298
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,607
Thirteen, fourteen years old.

299
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,007
But you have to ask in advance.

300
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:22,477
They don't let just anybody have them.

301
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,045
How much?

302
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,610
Neither of us could afford it.
They come from all over.

303
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,520
Oaxaca, Veracruz...

304
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,593
Young girls.

305
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:39,390
- How about from the north?
- From the north too.

306
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,465
They have to be virgins though.

307
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,161
They are precious.

308
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:48,632
A marvel.

309
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,840
Excuse me, where is the place
you're talking about?

310
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:01,578
Hey, it's a secret.

311
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:05,315
But if you want
I'll whisper it in your ear.

312
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:11,120
What? Afraid to do this in public?

313
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,027
- No.
- Come with me upstairs.

314
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,984
I'm not what you think I am.

315
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,543
Then what are you doing in this joint?
You come here to pray?

316
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,282
The truth is...

317
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,657
Catch me!

318
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,401
So, we didn't come here to pray?

319
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,133
Give me that!

320
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,814
Let's see, let's see.
What happened?

321
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:07,043
Come on out of there. Come on.

322
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,254
You're making me late. I have to go.

323
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,152
- And the secret?
- What secret?

324
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,692
The place you were talking about
downstairs. Is it the Pink House?

325
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:19,593
That's up in Tijuana.
Only gringos go there.

326
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,325
They happily pay big bucks...

327
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,230
to bang teenyboppers.

328
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,736
All the way to Tijuana?
How can I get up there?

329
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,807
Listen, why don't you stay here?

330
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:33,172
At least we like them
all grown up in this place.

331
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,404
Here, take it. It's on the house.

332
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,183
Besides, you're out of practice, honey.

333
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,547
Jumping on customers like that.

334
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,633
May the Archangel Raphael
safeguard our journey...

335
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,701
in mind, body and spirit.

336
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:39,270
May the Archangel Raphael
guide us through all danger.

337
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,005
That kid is not a kid. He's a midget.

338
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,952
What's your name?

339
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:55,859
Paloma.

340
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,188
- Travelling alone?
- Uh-huh.

341
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:04,030
Where do you live?

342
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:10,366
In Monterrey, in Guadalajara,
in Mexico City, in Acapulco.

343
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,464
You?

344
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,544
In Tlacotalpan, Veracruz.

345
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,787
What are you going to do in Tijuana?

346
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,686
What everyone goes there to do.

347
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,620
And you?

348
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:33,863
Me too. Me too.

349
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,519
It's a long fuckin' haul, huh?

350
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,251
Yeah.

351
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,827
Listen, could I lie down here?

352
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,590
Sure, of course.

353
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,633
I'll be your pillow.

354
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:14,899
- Can you hold this too?
- Sure.

355
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,490
I'll take one of these, and a statue
of the Holy Child of Atocha.

356
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:16,328
How about a Juan Soldado?
He's the best.

357
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:19,403
Beautiful! I'll take one.

358
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,611
Oh, my God!

359
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,976
Grab him! Slimebag!

360
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:41,289
I fucked up! I could have
grabbed your suitcase too!

361
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,919
Don't worry.
This is the important one.

362
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,826
All right, kid.
See you around.

363
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,592
Are you sure you'll be okay?

364
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,667
I could ask the same about you.

365
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,703
- Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
- All right.

366
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,707
Boy, that fuckin' guy. Asshole.

367
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,878
I'm stuffed!

368
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,584
Excuse me.

369
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,485
Do you know
where I can find the Pink House?

370
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,319
They told me it's here, in Tijuana.

371
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:17,485
The Pink House?
Are you sure you got the name right?

372
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,222
Positive.

373
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,127
No. I don't think so.

374
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,496
Could you bring me the bill, please?

375
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,570
Look at you!
Who could have guessed!

376
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,776
Oh, my God!

377
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:40,509
Hey, it's my treat.
And I'm outta here!

378
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,644
Shit!

379
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,885
Oh, Holy Child of Atocha, forgive her.

380
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,791
Blanca could be in the same situation.

381
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,958
Ask for Cacomixtle.

382
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,036
Cacomixtle? As in ''weasel''?

383
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,857
Cacomixtle!

384
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,796
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

385
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,533
Someone told me I could get directions
to the Pink House here. Do you know?

386
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,768
Are you going to look for work there?

387
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,504
Yes, work.

388
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,581
Do you have any references?
They don't let just anybody in.

389
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:29,483
References? Yes, I have eight years
experience, with tall ones, shrimps...

390
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,885
white guys, black guys, Chinese--

391
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,857
That so? Maybe I can help you.

392
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,928
I've got a client who might know.

393
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,155
- Really?
- He should come by tonight.

394
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:44,394
Really? All right,
I'll come back tomorrow.

395
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,629
You got a place to stay?

396
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,969
I'm going to look for a hotel.

397
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,976
And what's this?

398
00:42:14,265 --> 00:42:17,894
Jose Luis, please understand me.

399
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,972
Is the client here yet?

400
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,637
No, but I brought you a little present.

401
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:36,786
If you're a whore,
I must be Michael the Archangel.

402
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,651
- What makes you think I'm not... that?
- What's you angle?

403
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:43,215
What are you after?
Let me guess...

404
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:47,093
you need dough to cross the border and
you think you can make it hooking, huh?

405
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,222
- Easy, right?
- No, that's not it.

406
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,097
Women like you ruin
the reputation of the trade.

407
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,102
Reputation?

408
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,331
Reputation. And well earned.

409
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,501
Face a guy ready to pop his rocks...

410
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,079
and you'll run like hell.

411
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,674
Hooking is like killing:

412
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,912
sounds easy,
but not everybody's got the nerve.

413
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,814
May I?

414
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:48,981
So you're into costumes, sweetheart?
All right, then.

415
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,524
I meant what I said about killing.

416
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,361
But only the first time is tough.

417
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,766
Then it becomes a habit.

418
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,328
Like this, like this.

419
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,068
That's it!

420
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:13,877
In this profession there are
basic rules you've got to learn.

421
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:17,784
And the first one, baby,
is called intimacy.

422
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,552
I think the client's
not coming tonight after all.

423
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,253
Where should I leave them?

424
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,352
They're for washing.

425
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,250
Come here.

426
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,756
Come here!

427
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:22,549
The madame is called Trini.

428
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,280
Don't mention my name.

429
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,258
Say that Mr. Scott Haynes sent you.

430
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,692
Mister who?

431
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,457
Scott Haynes.

432
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,308
Thank you.

433
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,814
No problem.

434
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:58,518
Nothing like recommending
an experienced whore.

435
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,188
You're fucked.

436
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:08,758
Jealous?

437
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:16,495
The devil doesn't fall in love,
asshole!

438
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:07,357
Yes?

439
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,551
Good morning, sir.
I'm looking for Dona Trini.

440
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,392
Who's calling?

441
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:17,396
Mr. Scott Haynes sent me here.

442
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,338
The San Diego judge?

443
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,332
Yes. He says that maybe
I could work here.

444
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,509
Come in.

445
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,288
What a weirdo.

446
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:45,018
This isn't a whorehouse or a love hotel.

447
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,426
It's a service institution.

448
00:47:48,465 --> 00:47:52,094
We only cater to important gentlemen,
like Mr. Haynes.

449
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:55,171
Our clientele is very demanding.

450
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:57,399
Are you tested for AI DS?

451
00:47:58,442 --> 00:47:59,739
No, but--

452
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:05,304
I'll send you to Dr. Oseguera.
He examines all my girls.

453
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:09,044
- Does this mean I'm hired?
- You're on a trial basis.

454
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,424
Saint Theresa ofJesus!

455
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,093
Thank you.

456
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:27,266
Esperanza will stay in Yuriria's room.

457
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:30,499
That girl's not coming back!

458
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,574
Thank you.

459
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:35,634
You may only enter your own room
and the public areas of the house.

460
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:39,739
You understand
that this is my guest lounge.

461
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,486
Oh, one last thing.
Hide your little box somewhere.

462
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,395
Yes, Dona Trini.

463
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,907
This is your room.
You can do whatever you wish.

464
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,979
Your monthly rent
is three thousand dollars.

465
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,048
What? Three thousand?

466
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,114
Includes meals. Don't worry,
you'll make much more than that.

467
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,621
Listen, is there an oven in the kitchen?

468
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,352
- She cooks too?
- Yes, and really well.

469
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,587
I could make you
some fried pork and beans.

470
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,494
No way, Missy!
I'll bloat!

471
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,600
And the other girls?

472
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:35,831
You'll get to know them.

473
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:38,066
There are hangers in the closet.

474
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,278
And all these clothes?

475
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,914
They are Yuriria's.
But if they fit, help yourself.

476
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,947
Except for this one.

477
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,636
Please, SaintJude,
don't leave me alone!

478
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:16,372
I've made my way here.

479
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,677
I've done
what I never thought I could.

480
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,774
And not a signal from you!

481
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:25,514
I hope you're not the kind that goes
on binges. My budget's very tight!

482
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:27,590
No, Cesar.

483
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,443
Esperanza!

484
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,792
Fidencio? It's Esperanza.

485
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:20,358
I need to talk to Father Salvador.
Hurry, it's long distance!

486
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,367
- Hello?
- FaTher? IT's me.!

487
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,241
No, I'm in Tijuana.

488
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:34,147
Soledad came to see
if I knew where you were.

489
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,654
She wants to find you.

490
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:42,213
A lot has happened, Father.
I need to confess.

491
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:45,886
You know you can't confess over the
phone. More so if it's long distance.

492
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,624
You and your rules!

493
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:52,065
What if I call it a confession
and you call it a confidence?

494
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,528
All right. Go ahead.

495
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:58,904
I came to this house owned
by this Trini, and I met this gringo.

496
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,005
What?

497
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:06,412
You said I recommended you.

498
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,813
Forgive me, Mr. Haynes,

499
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,887
but I really needed the job
and somebody gave me your name.

500
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:13,114
- Who is 'somebody'?
- Yuriria.

501
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:15,020
She let me have her room, Mister.

502
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,922
Call me Scott.

503
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,953
Thank you, ''Escot'',
but you're not mad at me?

504
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:26,365
I won't, until I find out
if I made a good recommendation.

505
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,717
I'll spare you The deTails, FaTher.

506
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:43,877
I know I'm surrounded by filTh...

507
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:46,785
buT This man has been
good To me so far.

508
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:50,258
He's come back several Times.

509
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:58,497
What's this?

510
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,900
That's four thousand dollars there.

511
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,599
But the last time
you gave me three hundred.

512
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,676
I don't want you having other clients.

513
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,677
- But four thousand?
- You need more?

514
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,748
No, that's not it. But, why?

515
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:17,082
I want you only for myself.

516
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,829
He Told me I reminded him
ofhis moTher, FaTher.

517
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,401
''BuTshe musTbe as blonde as you';
I Told him.

518
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:48,306
''No, iT's The way you look aTme';
he answered.

519
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,988
What a crazy gringo.

520
00:54:57,193 --> 00:55:00,651
So I haven'Thad To worry
abouToTher clienTs.

521
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:04,393
I jusTdo Things wiTh him,
buTI don'Tknow if They're sins.

522
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:07,959
If you feel a need of repentance,
then it's a sin.

523
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:11,802
If not, it's not.
You'll be able to tell.

524
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:18,442
I jusT wanTmy girl To know ThaTI'll do
anything To rescue her from her TormenT.

525
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,964
I don'Tknow how much
you know abouT women, FaTher,

526
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,037
buTyou wouldn'Trecognize me.

527
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,605
I never ThoughTI could look This way.

528
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,483
Enjoy. She's still tender.

529
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,754
Nobody can be suspicious
of whaTI'm doing.

530
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,927
Be careful, my child.!

531
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,833
Yes.

532
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,237
She is my daughter.

533
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,139
She's so blonde!

534
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,453
I've been able To search for Blanca
everywhere, excepTfor one room.

535
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:34,853
IT's nexT To Trini's salon,
buT Cesar waTches iTlike a bodyguard.

536
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:42,724
FaTher, I'm sure my daughTer
is jusTa few feeTaway...

537
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,130
buTSainTJude has forgoTTen abouTme.

538
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,362
He's so unreliable.!

539
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,598
Don't lose faith, my child.

540
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:55,167
I won't. I have to go now.
It's long distance! Bye!

541
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:00,483
Esperanza.!

542
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,079
Esperanza!

543
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,994
Lord.

544
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:18,257
I can't deal with Esperanza anymore.
She's got me crazy.

545
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,927
You know why you sent her down
this road, but I don't have a clue.

546
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,339
If Dr. Ortiz is dead, what do you want
with this poor woman?

547
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,878
It's an enigma I can't solve.

548
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:33,107
And she hung up on me!

549
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:37,676
That's why the Church forbids
long distance confessions!

550
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,229
It must be that girl.
I told her to come by in one hour.

551
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:57,636
Come in.

552
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,376
Ma'am.

553
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,912
I'm going to be straight with you.

554
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:10,017
Business is off, and the word
about your altar has spread around...

555
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,714
and lots of clients want to see you.
I need you to take care of them.

556
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,753
But Mr. Scott asked me to--

557
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:18,054
He doesn't have to find out.

558
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:24,426
Madame Trini, lying to Mr. Scott
won't fix the problem.

559
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,697
What this house need is a spiritual
cleansing, like we do back home.

560
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:29,772
Why risk your best client?

561
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,166
You'll see what a cleansing can do.

562
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:45,653
It's vital that I enter every single
room in the house, public and private.

563
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,383
Don't get fresh with me!

564
00:59:10,413 --> 00:59:12,813
No wonder, Dona Trini.
Somebody cast a spell on you!

565
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:16,143
- That must have been Cacomixtle!
- But it's out now.

566
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,221
The evil. See?

567
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,788
I need to open every door...

568
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:27,989
to eliminate any spell
that they may have cast on the property.

569
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:29,064
Let's go!

570
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,282
Go away!

571
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,783
You must swear
that you'll keep this...

572
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,356
to yourself.

573
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:55,924
Amen.

574
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,130
Holy Virgin!

575
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,467
There are no girls locked up here!

576
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,538
You're not helping me find Blanca!

577
01:00:56,619 --> 01:00:58,177
Forgive me! Forgive me!

578
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,254
Forgive me!

579
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,958
I don't know whether to hate you,
or to worship you!

580
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,031
First you order SaintJude
to send me on this search,

581
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,100
then you take him away
when I need him the most!

582
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,833
Give me back my Blanca!

583
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:31,248
Why did you waste my time there?
That Trini doesn't have any girls!

584
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,480
Dona Trini.

585
01:01:32,588 --> 01:01:35,887
I didn't know you liked girls!

586
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:40,622
Don't be stupid, I don't like girls.
I'm looking for my daughter.

587
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,698
She was kidnapped.

588
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:49,438
No wonder they took her.

589
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,176
Though her mama is even prettier.

590
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,245
Do you know where she might be?

591
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,644
And do you know who her father is?
Or was it Immaculate Conception?

592
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:03,048
You don't know what you're
talking about. I'm a widow.

593
01:02:04,087 --> 01:02:08,547
What a pity! Divorcees forget
their husbands quick,

594
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:11,786
but widows carry them
around their necks like holy medals.

595
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,691
I don't care for threesomes.

596
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,593
Do you have an idea
where she could be?

597
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:20,963
They might have taken her
to the other side.

598
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,697
You mean the United States?

599
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:28,132
SaintJude, what am I going to do?
I don't know what's worse,

600
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,872
that she's gone to the Other World
or to the First World.

601
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:38,811
There's a spot in Los Angeles...

602
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,154
you should check out.

603
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:46,888
The owner is my buddy, and he knows
where these girls might be working.

604
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:48,623
Ask for Doroteo.

605
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:53,027
But I don't even have a passport!

606
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:55,627
Since when has that been a problem?

607
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,679
PleaseJuan Soldado...

608
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,649
this is your land,
you've helped so many immigrants--

609
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,886
Please hold our hand.

610
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,817
So, are we gonna send you
to a paradise place?

611
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:25,393
No. I saw your ad.

612
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:31,426
Unfortunately, I can't choose
till I've interviewed everybody.

613
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,868
Well, let me know soon
so I can tell Mr. Scott Haynes.

614
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,837
What did you say?

615
01:04:38,941 --> 01:04:42,240
Mister Haynes told me to see you.

616
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:47,375
You should have told me right away.
How do you know Scott?

617
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:50,782
We're practically related.

618
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,287
He got me out of a fuckin'jam.

619
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:56,358
They threw me in the can
and he got me out.

620
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,256
They thought I was some fucking guy.

621
01:04:58,361 --> 01:04:59,487
Holy Virgin!

622
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,893
But, hey, ancient story.

623
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:09,370
I want you to help me with ticketing,
confirmation, money exchange, income tax.

624
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:15,240
I also sell tickets
for wrestling events, you know?

625
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,311
Yes.

626
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:18,380
- So, what's your name?
- Esperanza Diaz.

627
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,043
See you tomorrow at eleven.

628
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,585
Welcome to Paseo Travel.

629
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:31,085
This apartment's nicer
than the other...

630
01:05:31,193 --> 01:05:35,152
but nobody wants it
because a guy was murdered here.

631
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,223
Don't worry,
I already washed it down,

632
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:42,771
redecorated, fixed it up nice.

633
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,312
I'll take it.

634
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:55,373
Terrific! We'll be great pals.
Come on, I'll give you the key.

635
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,426
If the job interests you, it's yours.

636
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,002
Cacomixtle and I
have done a lot of business...

637
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:17,072
and he always sends good material.

638
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,735
Come with me, I'll give you a tour.

639
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,779
This theater is unique.
There's nothing like it in the world.

640
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,182
Why? Because I created it.

641
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,586
Look, the girls go up these stairs.

642
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:37,787
Come.

643
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,728
And the clients
can do their browsing down here.

644
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:48,270
See? Clients can watch their individual
show through these sex-o-scopes.

645
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,669
Go ahead, take a peek.

646
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,943
And what's the show?

647
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:03,177
The girls put on their uniform...

648
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:06,254
and do what they normally do
when no one's watching them.

649
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:11,691
They dress, undress,
comb their hair, masturbate,

650
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:15,423
battle their cellulite.

651
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,101
But what's the point, Doroteo?

652
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:23,572
The violation of intimacy.

653
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,192
Please, SaintJude, tell me if I'm
getting warmer or getting colder?

654
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:58,926
I'm losing hope and don't know
in which oven to look for you.

655
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:02,060
How will I ever find Blanca
in this city? It's huge!

656
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,139
Vicenta, it's the man who called
this morning. What do I tell him?

657
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:48,614
Tell the bastard we'll check
for a direct flight and get back to him.

658
01:09:48,717 --> 01:09:52,847
Yes, sir, and you're in luck,
I've got the last tickets.

659
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:56,755
But hurry! We close at six!

660
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,828
If you have any left, I'll buy you one.

661
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,729
I don't want to miss this match.
It's with the Angel ofJustice, right?

662
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,357
And he's fuckin' hot, man.
I was gonna go by myself...

663
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:09,096
but if you wanna see the Border Patrol
get stomped, tag along.

664
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,105
What about your night gig?

665
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,506
If they fire me, who cares?
I'll find another job.

666
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,448
Presents the season's
top wrestling match!

667
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,244
That's La Migra.

668
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:23,909
That's the bad guy, yeah?

669
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:29,480
Tonight's Referee: Furia!

670
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:34,794
Entering the ring,
the immigration monster:

671
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,861
Border Patrol!

672
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:48,707
Risking his Championship of All Masks
tonight and challenging from the heavens:

673
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,507
the Angel ofJustice!

674
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,784
We worship you!
We worship you!

675
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:06,854
Angel!

676
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:39,222
Give the pig a tombstone piledriver!

677
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,691
Border Patrol!
Border Patrol!

678
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,234
Look!

679
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,462
Tear him apart!

680
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:59,377
Slimebag!
How can you do that to him?

681
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:02,143
Give him a neckbreaker!

682
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,895
Grind his bones!

683
01:12:28,043 --> 01:12:30,409
Hey! Watch it, fucker!

684
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:42,218
Don't mess with his balls!

685
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:52,459
Vicenta, careful!

686
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,299
Hide there, you idiot!

687
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,139
Watch out!

688
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:44,614
This fabulous combat
has come to an end...

689
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:48,679
with the victory
of the Angel ofJustice...

690
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:56,328
we'll know the identity
of Border Patrol!

691
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:06,364
There you have it,
the new champion:

692
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:09,444
The Angel ofJustice!

693
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:29,123
Good night.

694
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,147
What a catharsis!

695
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,239
- You scared me!
- Now what?

696
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,545
I'm looking for the wrestler.
I have his boot.

697
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,246
Angel, are you decent?

698
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:54,652
It depends.

699
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,883
There's a lady who wants to see you.

700
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,459
Okay.

701
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,622
Won't you be needing this?

702
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:08,066
You're making me feel like Cinderella.

703
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:13,000
Why didn't you catch me out there?

704
01:15:13,108 --> 01:15:14,905
We haven't even been introduced.

705
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,979
Heaven forbid!
The Angel ofJustice, at your service.

706
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,844
My pleasure. Esperanza Diaz.

707
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:22,211
Can I walk you to your car?

708
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:24,919
No.

709
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,488
Well, I could give you a ride.

710
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:32,458
I won, you see, and there's a party
with my manager and the boys...

711
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:38,132
and whoever catches the boot.

712
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:19,770
How do you have any strength left
to dance after the beating you took?

713
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:23,606
I dished out more than I took.

714
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:32,450
I'm really sorry.

715
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,125
Does it hurt?

716
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,798
Here, let me rub it.

717
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:48,135
No! Don't take my shoe off!. Please.

718
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:51,228
Are you embarrassed?

719
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,433
But you were carrying my boot.

720
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:57,308
It's just that have a bad habit
of losing my shoes...

721
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,607
and these are my favorite ones.

722
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,879
Yeah?

723
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:07,854
Well you can't lose them here.

724
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,933
Who are you?

725
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:25,200
Don't ask. There's no hurry.

726
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,934
Are you?

727
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,641
Can we see each other soon?

728
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,650
God willing.

729
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:50,991
May I help you?

730
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:52,566
Yes.

731
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,330
Your foot!

732
01:17:57,439 --> 01:17:59,907
No, no. You could get hurt.

733
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:05,936
It looked really awful when he gave you
the flying axhandle. Did it hurt?

734
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:07,515
The flying axhandle?

735
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:10,585
- Yes, did it hurt much?
- No.

736
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:15,252
Then...

737
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,691
Good night.

738
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,197
Good night.

739
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,783
Did you forget something?

740
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:55,021
My favorite one!

741
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:01,132
I'm glad you came back...

742
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,704
because I'm going to give you
the chokeslam, the powerbomb,

743
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,773
and then, I'll unmask you.

744
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:08,240
And I'll punish you
with the wristlock,

745
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:12,404
give you a Hurricane, and if you're
not careful, the Crucifixion.

746
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,038
The Crucifixion?

747
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,085
On this side...

748
01:19:17,853 --> 01:19:19,548
Let's see. Catch me!

749
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,682
She gets the Neck Stretcher.

750
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:27,952
And she gives him the Head Vice!

751
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:36,097
But he escapes with a Tiger Pounce!

752
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:39,173
There she goes-- No, no wait!

753
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:42,243
- What are you going to do to me?
- Careful, my hair.

754
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,142
There she goes, like a shot!

755
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,879
Now I hold your arms.

756
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,623
- And the Crucifixion.
- The Crucifixion?

757
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,623
First we roll to our right.

758
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:11,027
Esperanza, that's a Spine Cracker.

759
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,436
Yes, sir.

760
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:15,840
- And now, the mask!
- What are you doing?

761
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,741
No, please, Esperanza, not yet.

762
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:21,338
You did this to the other guy.
Why can't I?

763
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:23,246
Off it goes!

764
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,985
But the wrestler covers his face.

765
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,357
She can't see him!

766
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:34,655
What happened?

767
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:39,216
Nothing. You unmasked me.

768
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,230
My name's Angel Galvan.

769
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:49,230
But not even my mom knows my true
identity, so, your lips are sealed.

770
01:21:54,876 --> 01:21:57,140
Saint Anthony,

771
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:00,874
please don't play a bad joke on me
with this Angel guy.

772
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:03,075
I've never put your statue upside down
so you'd find me a man.

773
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,175
So, don't make me fall in love with him.

774
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,755
What if he's just playing around?

775
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:09,687
You send me off in search of Blanca...

776
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:11,588
and you put an angel on my path!

777
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,292
I can't look for my girl
and fall in love at the same time.

778
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,695
Why don't you two
get your act together?

779
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,342
Fucking whore!

780
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:14,320
- Who do you think you're laughing at?
- What are you doing here?

781
01:23:14,422 --> 01:23:15,980
Shut up!

782
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:20,085
That's how I wanted to see you, slut!

783
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,536
Come here, fucking whore!

784
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,105
That's how I wanted to see you,
Peeping Tom!

785
01:23:40,715 --> 01:23:42,842
Where are you!
Where are you!

786
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:44,680
Where are you, fucking whore?

787
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,688
There are no little girls here either!

788
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,594
What's going on?

789
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:57,131
Nothing.Just having a chat
with your friend from Tijuana.

790
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:58,199
Stop her!

791
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:05,869
You had to be another bitch!

792
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:04,265
You ended up all the way up here too?

793
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:10,430
It's amazing what one will do
for one's children, isn't it?

794
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:18,909
SaintJude...

795
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:21,675
please tell me
if I've understood your messages.

796
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:25,645
We've gone a little too far,
haven't we?

797
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:33,857
Saint Anthony, I guess
you'll have to wait. I'm sorry.

798
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:42,629
SaintJude, I'm going back home.

799
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:46,306
And you better be there.

800
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,427
Good lord!
Just look at you!

801
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,663
Look at you too!

802
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,627
Watch out!

803
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,605
You brought back a refrigerator!

804
01:28:33,474 --> 01:28:37,103
Oh, Dominga. Dominga.

805
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:50,488
Mama, you and I
will always be together.

806
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,736
I brought you some presents.

807
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:08,331
Thank you!

808
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,278
SaintJude.

809
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:37,697
What did you do to the oven?

810
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:38,794
What do mean?

811
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,806
With this!

812
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:44,109
I just cleaned it. That's all.

813
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,347
Dammit!

814
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,457
Oh, my Lord!

815
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:00,620
How are you, Father Salvador?

816
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,355
Esperanza!

817
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:07,126
Where have you been?

818
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:10,967
In Los Angeles.

819
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,707
Look at you.

820
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:17,207
You've changed so much!

821
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:22,149
Do you want to confess?

822
01:30:24,018 --> 01:30:27,146
I don't know what to do, Father.

823
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,723
I don't know what to do.

824
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:44,603
Our Father will never abandon you.

825
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:51,508
He's aware of everything you've done
to find your daughter.

826
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:57,010
Everything, Father.

827
01:31:08,329 --> 01:31:10,126
Everything.

828
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:09,315
Mama.

829
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:13,293
Mama.

830
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:19,132
My little darling!

831
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:23,098
You and I will always be together.

832
01:32:37,184 --> 01:32:38,651
Blanquita.

833
01:33:07,081 --> 01:33:09,709
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

834
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:12,115
now and at the hour of our--

835
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:15,017
Let's go outside.
I can't be in church dressed like this.

836
01:33:15,122 --> 01:33:16,749
What are you doing here?

837
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:35,134
How did you find me?

838
01:33:35,242 --> 01:33:38,211
There is only one Tlacotalpan,
Veracruz, Mexico.

839
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,780
But what are you doing here?

840
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:43,873
I have orders to find you.

841
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:52,326
Why did you disappear just like that?

842
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:56,192
Same way you appeared just like that.

843
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:58,993
Esperanza, come with me.

844
01:34:00,201 --> 01:34:01,998
I can't, Angel.

845
01:34:03,037 --> 01:34:06,996
Why did you leave so suddenly?

846
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:10,010
Things happen in a strange way.

847
01:34:10,111 --> 01:34:16,812
Funny, I had to travel so far
to find what was in my own house.

848
01:34:19,153 --> 01:34:22,247
What can I do to convince you?

849
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,419
My daughter!
