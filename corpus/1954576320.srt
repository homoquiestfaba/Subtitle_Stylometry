00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:06,369
This film is a true story. Some names, characters and events

2
00:00:06,886 --> 00:00:11,527
have changed or created through collaboration.

3
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:29,655
Please, call the people where my son works?

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,965
Do not worry, the detective will see to that.

5
00:00:34,132 --> 00:00:36,931
LPW Constructions. You tell that to the detective ...

6
00:00:39,946 --> 00:00:41,606
Can I speak to the detective?

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,571
Come you back, but the day after tomorrow.

8
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:45,937
What say you?

9
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:48,791
Missing persons we have to wait 48 hours.

10
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:52,784
You forgot to sign. - I'm sorry.

11
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:57,479
48 hours, particularly teenagers.

12
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,603
Why say "particularly teenagers?

13
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,530
Because they often disappear and come back spontaneously.

14
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,883
Sorry to bother you ... but he's 4 months ago last seen.

15
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,657
You'll still be surprised how many young people are missing, such as your son.

16
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,948
16-17000 last year alone in Chicago.

17
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:37,323
Many of them show themselves again, for the rest ...

18
00:01:38,424 --> 00:01:42,483
I am afraid that not enough manpower and time is available before.

19
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:48,108
But you're still him anyway, right?

20
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:51,535
Of Course. Do not worry, he will appear again.

21
00:01:52,482 --> 00:01:53,570
Believe me.

22
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:59,848
DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS TWEE JAAR LATER

23
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:04,138
More I can not do it now, Chris.

24
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,904
Perhaps in the new year, okay?

25
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:08,266
What will it be?

26
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,439
I wish that I could give to storage. He works hard.

27
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:12,577
What you pay them anyway?

28
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,387
Part-time workers? $ 2.50 per hour.

29
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,327
You and your brother get away with murder there.

30
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,816
I start at $ 5 per hour.

31
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:23,983
How soon can you deliver again?

32
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:30,756
Hard to say. Everyone is working like a dog, that's not it.

33
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:34,154
I'm almost too numb in the van. - Turn the heater on.

34
00:02:34,413 --> 00:02:35,468
Then I get to head cavity ignition.

35
00:02:35,727 --> 00:02:38,163
I need additional screens for the holidays.

36
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,726
Teddy, what do you think?

37
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,937
Come on John, I've been worried enough work.

38
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,354
As soon as I can.

39
00:03:37,357 --> 00:03:40,099
I saw this back. John Gacy, you know him?

40
00:03:40,324 --> 00:03:42,108
He has done some work for Mr. Austin last year.

41
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,857
Is this what? - For a happy girl.

42
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:50,518
The anniversary of my mother. Would they like what?

43
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,357
She'll love it.

44
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,452
Can you wrap it for me? - Of Course.

45
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:06,922
Right Here. - What does that mean?

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,349
Pull him but aan.Staat you better than me.

47
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,490
Congratulations, Mrs. Gant.

48
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,317
Thank you, Cindy.Hoe you know that?

49
00:05:16,606 --> 00:05:17,960
Chris said not me. When is it?

50
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,615
In a moment she would like to know how old you are.

51
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:21,676
Forty-six.

52
00:05:21,992 --> 00:05:24,013
Mom? - Well I'm not ashamed to hear you?

53
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:27,199
Ready to go?

54
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,827
Actually, if you can wait. A guy came in here for some articles ...

55
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:30,992
and I think he has work for me.

56
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,913
He pays double for what I make.

57
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,054
Chris, wacht even!

58
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:37,492
You still freezes outside.

59
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,294
You're worse than my mother.

60
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,244
I'll be right back.

61
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:47,053
It's cold outside.

62
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,204
Chris?

63
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:19,778
He is not in the store.

64
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:21,654
What would be wrong with him happened?

65
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,715
I have no idea. Mr. Austin?

66
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,083
No trace of him. Both inside and outside not behind.

67
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:27,799
He said he would immediately come back.

68
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,519
Maybe he's just going to walk home. So far is not it.

69
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,432
Do not worry, there's nothing with him happened.

70
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:35,122
I'll call Gacy, just in case.

71
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:37,185
Maybe he'm given a lift.

72
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:51,424
You are connected to John Gacy, LPW constructions.

73
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:55,022
I'm sorry that I'm not there ... but if you enter your name and tel. No. Is leaving

74
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,386
I'll call you back as soon as possible. Say you message after the beep.

75
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:09,614
Vincent Austin here, call me as soon as you can on no. 555-1422

76
00:07:15,873 --> 00:07:20,081
Mike, what are you doing up so early? - Basketball practice before the game tonight.

77
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,591
What game?

78
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,688
I'll be there. - Perched just me.

79
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:28,781
Then you do not like to get up early. - Look who's talking.

80
00:07:29,184 --> 00:07:31,749
The man in the house yet you also need to put it to work?

81
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:34,547
Is not too bad though. Want some ice cream?

82
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:36,093
No, I'm late.

83
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,467
Sometimes I wish that your father was still wearing a uniform.

84
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,325
He also sometimes ...

85
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:44,623
When we saw him often - Okay, I understand.

86
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:47,718
Go you every morning so early? - I have to, new job.

87
00:07:47,937 --> 00:07:49,502
It is the only way to keep it full.

88
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:52,678
You will certainly be fun? - Almost as if you with your basketball.

89
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,503
To whom should you play?

90
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:58,533
Chicago's Faith Baptist. Truly a fresh team.

91
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,330
That means they are good.

92
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:06,188
What is he doing in there anyway sense. - I'll be there more often.

93
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,784
I will instill me myself.

94
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:12,347
Come on, I'll take you there.

95
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:19,903
Look at the missing here. Cristopher Gant, guess what?

96
00:08:22,217 --> 00:08:25,529
Expect some of this morning? - You could help me with it.

97
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,997
You have experience with this sort of thing. Office Youth.

98
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:35,903
Not therewith. In Chicago, but not here.

99
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,470
Mainly runaways from home and school.

100
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,874
Like what happened to this kid. - Maybe, or maybe not.

101
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,895
Nice kid so to see, right?

102
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,686
Student van de Main West Highschool.

103
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:52,800
That's the school where your son is going?

104
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:57,656
The boy had chores after school since his 12th.

105
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:02,999
Father or mother picked him up after work. Not really a typical runaway, do you?

106
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,187
Indeed.

107
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:10,586
Inspector Kozenczak, the couple Gant is here to talk about a missing person.

108
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:11,939
Okay, thanks.

109
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:13,720
Forward again.

110
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:18,692
When your son went outside, you knew for sure that he Mr. Gacy was

111
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,219
to talk about a new job?

112
00:09:20,502 --> 00:09:22,632
He did not really have a name.

113
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,441
From whom did you do it?

114
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,836
Cindy Beck told me, she also works in the shop where Chris works.

115
00:09:28,473 --> 00:09:32,213
He was so excited. He offered double what Mr. Austin 'gave m.

116
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:37,064
It's so hard to understand.

117
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,837
One minute he is with me in the store

118
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:45,242
in ...

119
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,848
You might want to sit down, Mrs. Gant?

120
00:09:57,058 --> 00:10:00,120
Is there a reason why Chris could use extra money?

121
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:05,350
What does that make? - He was saving for a darkroom at home,

122
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:07,413
He is a very good photographer.

123
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:10,913
I offered him the equipment to 'buy m.

124
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:13,883
But he insisted on paying for it themselves.

125
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:17,497
He is quite independent.

126
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,961
Maybe too independent.

127
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:27,695
It says here Mr. Austin to Gacy has called home?

128
00:10:28,072 --> 00:10:30,603
He was not, at least he took the phone in there.

129
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:35,883
And when Chris was still not come home we called his friends but ...

130
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,072
he was not there.

131
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,241
We then decided to drive around and for him to watch out.

132
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:50,512
But we could not find it so ... why I'm here.

133
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:56,562
Mrs. Gant, we will make every effort to "find m.

134
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,565
Dank u inspector.

135
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,544
I will keep you both informed.

136
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,326
Miss Gant?

137
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:17,543
Can I talk to you?

138
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,449
Can you think of a reason why you brother may run away?

139
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,355
Maybe he did something that your parents were not allowed to know?

140
00:11:25,682 --> 00:11:26,793
Of course not.

141
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:30,982
What do you think does not it? That he would be a problem child or something?

142
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,336
Is something bothering you?

143
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:43,114
Tonight said a police officer in the service that they wait 48 hours with missing persons,

144
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,183
before they even would do something.

145
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,756
I understand t.

146
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:51,176
And then there's that birthday gift. - Excuse Me Please?

147
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,493
Yesterday was the mother's birthday.

148
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:57,727
We waited for Chris to come home.

149
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:12,002
Wherever you work, I want you to go full time to this work until we find that boy.

150
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:13,587
Where is Atkins? - Free today.

151
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:16,158
Call him and tell him that he get the hell is here to help you.

152
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,484
Can not we better give it something a little more time? - No.

153
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,871
And shoot it already?

154
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,399
I am aware of, as I said,

155
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:44,851
if such an asshole you supply outlets.

156
00:12:45,402 --> 00:12:49,287
Months of work, and no one that meets the description.

157
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:52,687
Okay, I'll still put away a unit.

158
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,662
Maybe they can try again.

159
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:56,711
Let Williams call me.

160
00:12:58,092 --> 00:13:00,436
While you're in the mood, maybe you can help me.

161
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,820
I work me Fuck. - Yes, yes, we take 't it.

162
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:07,478
What did I tell you?

163
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,729
Inspector? - Not right now.

164
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:16,417
Such snot and then head too. - He's not a youngster anymore.

165
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:18,368
Leave for 15 years a lot of noise itself.

166
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,554
Been at the mall? - No.

167
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:21,946
Something?

168
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,232
Not much.

169
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:26,165
Austin does not remember that Gacy spoke with Chris Gant.

170
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:29,228
Mr. Gacy been achieved? - By phone.

171
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:31,815
He said he has not spoken staff in the drugstore.

172
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:36,887
The second time he came back briefly to pick up the agenda.

173
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:41,251
When Gacy spoke with Chris Gant about a job?

174
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,636
Maybe not at all. - How Come?

175
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:48,619
I have a number of people there who work there at the mall

176
00:13:49,598 --> 00:13:53,623
and a few people saw Chris Gant outside but no one saw him together with the

177
00:13:53,851 --> 00:13:57,681
description Austin gave that meets John Gacy.

178
00:13:57,944 --> 00:14:01,351
The bottom line is that no one has ever seen Gacy.

179
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,824
How he sounded on the phone? - How can the phone?

180
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:08,217
He did not know there was a kid missing and could not help.

181
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:12,010
And something about the girl: Cindy Beck?

182
00:14:12,274 --> 00:14:13,998
Secondary school. - And?

183
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:16,085
She has something to do with Chris, nothing special.

184
00:14:17,245 --> 00:14:18,226
And further?

185
00:14:18,618 --> 00:14:20,602
It's confirmed what Mrs. Gant said.

186
00:14:20,977 --> 00:14:24,498
Chris said his mother wait because he wanted to speak to someone about a job.

187
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,783
What Mr. Gacy denies to give him.

188
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:32,480
Does she have any idea what happened to him happened?

189
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,103
Not exactly.

190
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:35,830
Not exactly?

191
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:40,388
Chris can do rather quirky and do his own thing.

192
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,384
No, he's not a runaway.

193
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:45,436
Not because of his parents and certainly not on his mother's birthday.

194
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,933
Okay, so I think once about now.

195
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,795
Okay, call Chicago and ask if they have a criminal Gacy.

196
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:58,730
If I could bet my money on it

197
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,628
I was already with my bare ass on the beach.

198
00:15:02,512 --> 00:15:05,525
Does that size of your still as archivist at the dep. in Chicago?

199
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:07,953
Ask to trace him about it, maybe he can give us a foothold.

200
00:15:08,202 --> 00:15:09,795
He only night shift.

201
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:11,874
Wait and call him then.

202
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:13,547
I have other plans.

203
00:15:13,817 --> 00:15:15,859
I said, "Continue to wait and call him then."

204
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:19,219
I just think we see something on the head, it just does not feel right.

205
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,076
Let me know.

206
00:15:22,418 --> 00:15:27,548
I think there is a kind of glamor is what attracts all bastards.

207
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,361
Have you already achieved something? - Just now.

208
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:34,423
In?

209
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:37,318
Chicago has two indictments walk on John Gacy.

210
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,567
For what?

211
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:39,894
Assault.

212
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:42,766
The first was an assault five years ago.

213
00:15:43,285 --> 00:15:46,237
Case settled and a second year of July this year, business is still ongoing.

214
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:49,238
What was the nature of the assault? - No idea.

215
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:53,080
How do you mean? - That's all that buddy of mine said.

216
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,908
Well, call him back.

217
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:59,519
Look, he has channeled me without permission.

218
00:16:01,136 --> 00:16:05,048
Now when I go to Chicago tomorrow to see the rest?

219
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,347
No, could be too late tomorrow.

220
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:12,915
Joe, we know that sexual assault Vanalles could be ...

221
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:16,928
Physical contact and threat, heh ...

222
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,177
Why not wait and then come to a conclusion?

223
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,459
We will be too late.

224
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:32,771
I'll see you at Gacy's house as soon as possible.

225
00:16:34,276 --> 00:16:36,022
Yes exactly, as soon as possible.

226
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,745
I will have to miss a game again.

227
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:46,104
It does not matter.

228
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:51,026
Is it about Christopher Gant?

229
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:55,235
Everyone at school is talking about it.

230
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,773
Will you find him? - I hope so.

231
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:06,590
Will it go well? - I do not know.

232
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:32,823
Sorry, I got held up at the office.

233
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,211
How far will we go?

234
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:37,805
If he can not enter late and not talking to you, then go home.

235
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,560
What are we going to do? - Everything to free the boy.

236
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:41,792
When he's inside at least.

237
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,039
What we have now actually ... two charges on assault ...

238
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,773
There is a missing teenager. - What's not in the last 24 hours?

239
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,060
Listen, I hope I'm wrong ...

240
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,657
and that this guy is nothing to do and nothing wrong with that Chris ...

241
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:54,167
but I would my doubts about this matter.

242
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,853
We want your conscience does not take into doubt. - Thank you.

243
00:17:57,423 --> 00:17:59,189
Come on, let's go inside.

244
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,632
See how far we get without a warrant.

245
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:04,957
The slightest indication that the boy is, if he do not let us.

246
00:18:46,998 --> 00:18:50,169
Have you seen that? - What?

247
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:52,608
A shadow.

248
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:55,171
No.

249
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:02,508
What do we do now?

250
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:10,251
I did not hear that bell, sorry, I was in the canteen.

251
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:13,332
Inspector Kozenczak, Des Plaines Politie.

252
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,769
Investigators Williams and Atkins.

253
00:20:16,594 --> 00:20:19,094
We investigate the disappearance of Christopher Gant.

254
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,521
I'm sorry but I can not say more than I have already said by telephone.

255
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:28,156
That's strange because there was a witness that you have seen the boy talk outside.

256
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:34,264
That must be a mistake.

257
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,917
Shall we just go in and brightening?

258
00:20:39,347 --> 00:20:40,355
Of Course.

259
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,814
You do not. He alone.

260
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,732
Sorry I was so curt.

261
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,297
Just got home to relax me a whole day's work, you know.

262
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:08,432
But there is this witness. - Who's lying.

263
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:10,864
Even if he claims that the boy got in your car?

264
00:21:10,865 --> 00:21:12,771
I told you that he is lying.

265
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:16,425
Of u lies.

266
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:22,438
Think again carefully, there is something you can remember about Chris?

267
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,740
No, no, nothing. I hope you find him you will.

268
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,877
Wait a second ...

269
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:29,469
I want to show you something.

270
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,001
Do you see that?

271
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:39,564
Hulpsherriff, discernment, charity what I do for the police.

272
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,470
Then you will understand the more that I sit with question marks.

273
00:21:43,128 --> 00:21:45,344
Objection or I may just quickly search the house?

274
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,250
Of course, you have a warrant?

275
00:21:51,773 --> 00:21:53,281
No, sir, I did not.

276
00:21:53,742 --> 00:21:55,532
Then as soon as you opdondert.

277
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:21,679
Do not open the door? - Is that an order?

278
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,771
Satisfied?

279
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:35,534
I want you to come with me to the office. - What the hell?

280
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:37,817
Statement about your goings last night.

281
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,224
I can not.

282
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,286
Why not?

283
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:44,817
My uncle died last night.

284
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:49,182
Therefore, I was at the pharmacy, Chicago hospital, but check.

285
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:53,686
I'm waiting on phone from my aunt. She is counting on me to arrange the funeral, etc.

286
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,367
Why do you call her now on, what's her number?

287
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,696
She is not home.

288
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:04,601
Listen, you do not understand how sad I am?

289
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:07,133
I love my uncle.

290
00:23:09,573 --> 00:23:10,937
I love both.

291
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:14,916
I will come to the office, if I have the opportunity.

292
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:19,729
Do not wait too long with it.

293
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:25,914
You have no respect for the dead.

294
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:31,367
I'll give you an advice. What's his name?

295
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,623
Kozencz ... - Kozenczak.

296
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:37,325
I have very good connections with the Chicago Police dep.

297
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,730
We are not just Chicago Des Plaines.

298
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:42,598
I'm waiting for you.

299
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,138
Police are nosy, you know?

300
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,532
Theodore Koslo, working under supervision for Gacy.

301
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,292
Did he say?

302
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:25,767
According to Vincent Austin was Koslo at the pharmacy last night.

303
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,920
He would also have been able to talk to Chris about a job.

304
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:35,409
Call Chicago tomorrow morning and ask if they have something about him.

305
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:37,990
And give me all about the indictments Gacy.

306
00:24:40,691 --> 00:24:42,381
I want one of you to continue to post here

307
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,347
to keep the house in the holes.

308
00:24:45,003 --> 00:24:48,503
You can not constantly keep an eye on. - I'll do it.

309
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,310
Terry, say it?

310
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:30,153
The van went off in a hurry.

311
00:27:30,371 --> 00:27:33,210
I tried to follow him. - Where did it go?

312
00:27:33,947 --> 00:27:37,842
I was trying to say, I'm lost.

313
00:27:37,843 --> 00:27:40,154
Okay, go home and go and get some sleep.

314
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,659
How did 't with the game?

315
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:54,036
They have won.

316
00:28:55,347 --> 00:28:57,207
En Michael? - First.

317
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:01,630
He missed you there. - I do too.

318
00:29:02,988 --> 00:29:06,037
All is well with him? - Sure.

319
00:29:08,443 --> 00:29:10,176
Yet discovered something on that guy?

320
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:14,816
Michael could not just walk away.

321
00:29:15,412 --> 00:29:17,213
Christopher Gant either.

322
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:19,465
I just know that.

323
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,664
I do not know what I should do.

324
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:27,340
If I had a little longer this work ...

325
00:29:29,194 --> 00:29:31,026
I just do not know how to act.

326
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:32,634
You shall know.

327
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:37,384
What did you always unsubscribe in uniform with fines.

328
00:30:20,358 --> 00:30:23,199
Questions and information about Christopher Gant, the missing person.

329
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:26,697
Priority and widely spread.

330
00:30:27,969 --> 00:30:30,733
He should be somewhere outside. - Let's hope so.

331
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,001
Kozenczak inspector's office?

332
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:40,027
It is Mr. Gacy.

333
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,341
Listen, I'm sorry that I can not make it tonight.

334
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:46,661
I was on our way, some ice bought the car in a ditch came back.

335
00:30:46,949 --> 00:30:48,752
And it took forever for him to get out of there.

336
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:52,735
If you do not believe, you check it.

337
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:56,295
No, I believe you, Mr. Gacy.

338
00:30:57,984 --> 00:30:59,643
Do I still come?

339
00:31:01,171 --> 00:31:03,630
And, and ... oke.

340
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,509
Koslo Hé ...

341
00:31:20,927 --> 00:31:22,676
Let the kid just work.

342
00:31:35,735 --> 00:31:38,144
Copies of the pictures there.

343
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,832
Looks nice, that kid.

344
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:45,882
Koslo? - Chicago is to control it.

345
00:31:46,144 --> 00:31:47,614
It seems that you were right.

346
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,645
Investigation Command on Gacy.

347
00:31:52,351 --> 00:31:55,254
Thank you. The other building. Send lawyers for it.

348
00:32:02,614 --> 00:32:05,354
I share your concern for the missing boy, inspector.

349
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:09,116
What do you have for a warrant?

350
00:32:09,397 --> 00:32:13,950
Two copies of a search warrant Gacy, concerning sexual assault on young men.

351
00:32:14,555 --> 00:32:19,572
The lawsuit is the first commandment that he imprisoned a guy in his garage.

352
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:21,898
Assaulted him repeatedly and left him for dead.

353
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:24,857
The boy escaped. - Let me see.

354
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,806
Gacy denied the allegations, the case was declared admissible.

355
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:35,741
The kid was sitting in prostitution, had a progressive character

356
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,590
and was a respectable businessman.

357
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,422
If they believe that boy, then Gant was not missing.

358
00:32:40,712 --> 00:32:43,163
The second thing? - Still open, the same charges.

359
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:44,804
And the boy? - Do not be talked about.

360
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:47,401
Let him talk. - He left the city immediately after.

361
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:51,570
What do you make of that Mr. Gacy was a respectful businessman?

362
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,060
Under these circumstances, I do not think I can convince the judge that.

363
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:01,728
Joe Kozenczak? One of your men want to talk to you.

364
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:07,203
Gacy has shown itself, as no one wants to speak with you alone.

365
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:08,650
He does not have much patience.

366
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,490
What did you do there last night?

367
00:33:11,178 --> 00:33:12,563
Start there but not over.

368
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:17,335
Listen, let him see his rights, take his statement on

369
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:20,329
But Terry, whatever you do, do not let it go until I get back.

370
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:29,710
I want to know what he has to say. - I am convinced that

371
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,522
Chris Gant's in there, and I want him to have it out ...

372
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:33,036
before more with him happens.

373
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,555
Don will help you to submit your request.

374
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:48,891
Mr. Gacy, reminds you specifically who you gepsproken still in the hospital?

375
00:33:48,892 --> 00:33:52,424
What is this doing? Please do not give me seriously?

376
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:56,292
A nurse can not remember you.

377
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:59,319
The damn I do not care what they may or may not remember.

378
00:33:59,614 --> 00:34:01,541
I need you to prove anything.

379
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,241
I can tell you that my charters to show the wall. Businessman of the year.

380
00:34:08,574 --> 00:34:12,740
I can show you as my bank account, my tax papers.

381
00:34:13,758 --> 00:34:16,057
Who have you spoken after the inspector you have spoken?

382
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,228
I'm told that I was, you never talk to each other or something?

383
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:23,328
How long will this take? I have to run a business.

384
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,114
I still do payouts. Since you obviously know nothing about.

385
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:36,142
John Gacy? I'm in my already met a few times in different functions.

386
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,837
Do you really think he is a child is molested?

387
00:34:40,088 --> 00:34:41,266
Ja, sir.

388
00:34:49,996 --> 00:34:53,279
I understand that my client has given full cooperation?

389
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:57,383
Six hours completely discarded. - Yup?

390
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:02,073
I do not understand that you refuse "to let him go?

391
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,694
This man has built a reputation in his field.

392
00:35:05,917 --> 00:35:07,569
Let wegggaan here. Let them get the Fuck.

393
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:09,294
The Fuck with that sissy of a Polock.

394
00:35:09,562 --> 00:35:12,094
Mr. Gacy, I would like to recover the keys to your house.

395
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:15,137
What For? - I can comb the area.

396
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:20,667
I guess you'll have to give them.

397
00:35:22,795 --> 00:35:25,138
If you do not, you'll need a new door.

398
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:27,229
How did you manage that?

399
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,512
I would also like to have an answer.

400
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:32,033
I think you should talk to your client.

401
00:35:35,151 --> 00:35:37,199
You've obviously done with me, huh?

402
00:35:37,422 --> 00:35:40,104
Has Mr. Gacy made a statement? And has he signed?

403
00:35:40,105 --> 00:35:42,567
Not yet. - I would like to have it there again on ...

404
00:35:42,795 --> 00:35:45,514
but this time with a lawyer to make it formally signs.

405
00:35:46,902 --> 00:35:49,690
Do you remember something here? What am I paying you still stand for?

406
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,662
To handle your business.

407
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:00,405
If you're there, be sure to check the garage.

408
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:02,591
Chris? Chris?

409
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:07,917
Look at that moment.

410
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:19,671
A sign of a boy in the garage? - No, nothing.

411
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,671
No sign of him.

412
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:31,006
There are stains on it, I think that's blood.

413
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:34,678
I can give that answer about when I 't take away to the lab.

414
00:38:34,994 --> 00:38:38,178
Okay, you have pockets for this evidence? Get them together with your camera.

415
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:42,074
We go through everything again and this time we are looking for material for us

416
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:44,491
links to Gacy and the disappearance of Chris. What are you waiting for?

417
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:49,829
We're too late.

418
00:38:52,149 --> 00:38:53,341
The boy is dead.

419
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:40,742
Wait a minute, Ed?

420
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:45,577
Please take a picture of it.

421
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:51,472
Okay, in the bag it.

422
00:39:53,335 --> 00:39:55,491
An unnamed ring with initials.

423
00:39:58,594 --> 00:40:03,620
What year? - Not Christopher, initials LAT

424
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,410
Can definitely come in handy.

425
00:40:06,867 --> 00:40:09,249
Ed, moor the office, everything.

426
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:13,706
Inspector?

427
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:18,708
A hatch in the closet here.

428
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,847
Open it. - I must have missed him the first time.

429
00:43:35,027 --> 00:43:38,292
Wow, look at who's here. Are you going to arrest me or not?

430
00:43:39,774 --> 00:43:43,184
We have found there enough, jewelry in a desk drawer.

431
00:43:43,702 --> 00:43:46,512
Can you still something of ... - A shelf handcuffed them.

432
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,625
So it is quite enough, inspector.

433
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:50,570
You know as well as I do that you can not continue with this.

434
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,611
Not unless you actually comes with indictments.

435
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:56,685
If I notice that you've made a mess of it ...

436
00:43:56,686 --> 00:43:58,986
Can Mr. Gacy's home ... - No one has to take me home,

437
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:00,779
I have my own car. - No you did not.

438
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:03,029
I'm seized for inspection together with the van.

439
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:06,093
Can he just do that? - I'm afraid so.

440
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,594
You have nothing on me. You're just to push me around.

441
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:14,969
Your nose rooting in my business. This is not work that way.

442
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:16,258
I'll take you home.

443
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:18,156
I wish you well, pain in the neck. - John!

444
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,769
That kid can thus get through this door, I would not even get recognized.

445
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:26,552
And nobody knows me!

446
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,385
A big collection of gay porn magazines.

447
00:44:44,225 --> 00:44:52,865
Several panties ... too small for Gacy, men's wallets ... used but empty.

448
00:44:53,556 --> 00:44:55,361
A wide collection of male jewelry:

449
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:59,576
watches, rings ... too small for Gacy's fingers.

450
00:45:00,587 --> 00:45:06,828
Necklaces, bracelets, narcotics, drugs.

451
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,494
And a pair of handcuffs.

452
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:25,472
You're up late?

453
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:27,518
Test tomorrow.

454
00:45:29,306 --> 00:45:31,430
How you doin '? - Much better.

455
00:45:34,307 --> 00:45:35,778
Sorry about last time.

456
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,189
Play-Offs begin the day after tomorrow, can you come?

457
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:41,066
Yes, I hope so but.

458
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,993
Do you have time to buy a tree?

459
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:49,815
It is Christmas again, time for a tree to set up.

460
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:56,807
And progresses?

461
00:45:58,442 --> 00:46:00,307
The boys at school keep me there for questions.

462
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:02,411
It is not very smooth.

463
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:05,245
Frightening.

464
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:32,895
New car, Mr. Gacy? - It's a rented.

465
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:38,951
This covers the damage? - Yes sir.

466
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:46,369
Maybe you want to play a game of pool?

467
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,452
Maybe some weed there?

468
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:54,079
Not tonight.

469
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:09,621
Listen, maybe we can arrange something for a night ...

470
00:47:09,622 --> 00:47:11,654
only two of us. What do you think?

471
00:47:13,526 --> 00:47:14,652
May Be.

472
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:17,779
I look forward to it.

473
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,518
Here ... Take it, take it, forward.

474
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,639
No, it's good. - No, but pack, pack only.

475
00:47:35,328 --> 00:47:37,257
Thanks for the service.

476
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,020
You already have all your dep. stand on the matter and now you want ...

477
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:10,113
Atkins, Williams Gil Barton en Walden.

478
00:48:10,694 --> 00:48:13,102
Yes that there are 4, the dep. 10 has.

479
00:48:13,768 --> 00:48:15,288
Bastard.

480
00:48:16,492 --> 00:48:19,595
I get permission to patrol 24/24 at Gacy?

481
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:21,981
With whom? The other half of your department?

482
00:48:23,535 --> 00:48:25,321
Mike Paxton en de Delta unit.

483
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,740
These guys know how to supervise, and how to act.

484
00:48:28,085 --> 00:48:30,772
Yes, I pick them off the street and all this sloppy here.

485
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,696
And certainly this time of year.

486
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:35,412
To detect a missing boy? - A murderer.

487
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:38,316
Wait a minute, Joe. You are going to accuse someone as being a murderer and

488
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:39,977
you do not even know if the kid is dead.

489
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:47,713
I have family that kid this morning sought.

490
00:48:49,497 --> 00:48:51,214
I told them the courage not to give up.

491
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:55,027
But you've already done that.

492
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,964
Based on what facts?

493
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:05,437
I do not know. Based on feelings.

494
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,393
Stuff we found in Gacy's house ...

495
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:10,748
The weapons and the two assault charges against him ...

496
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:14,080
Planned assaults. The two can retell their story.

497
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:16,437
Which Gacy thought there was one death.

498
00:49:18,097 --> 00:49:20,583
You're not too much involved in this case?

499
00:49:21,116 --> 00:49:25,498
Besides, you and Mike Paxton ... No, no, it's better between us.

500
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:29,969
Not that either of the two veterans hate me.

501
00:49:31,397 --> 00:49:35,344
I have no Head made to make it a game.

502
00:49:35,941 --> 00:49:38,930
I chose you out of all elderly people because I think you're the smartest.

503
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:41,940
Do not get me wrong. - I do not.

504
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,835
Gacy hold so long yesterday, was not very smart.

505
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,597
Can I turn on Delta?

506
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:58,628
You know what Christmas means to me?

507
00:49:59,682 --> 00:50:00,906
Even more problems.

508
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,086
Let Delta cowboy's that guy's not too acidic.

509
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,631
Otherwise, we are faced with a lawsuit.

510
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:12,001
Thank you. - Not so fast, I believe you have some business

511
00:50:12,002 --> 00:50:13,440
your department some straighten.

512
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:16,614
Hey, it is not my intention to sit on your mind.

513
00:50:16,615 --> 00:50:17,872
It's all in your head.

514
00:50:18,178 --> 00:50:20,589
If this does not work, I pull out the plug.

515
00:50:24,163 --> 00:50:25,247
Listen, Joe ...

516
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:27,912
Ease in Paxton, okay?

517
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,569
He has quite a state. - I get Delta or not, that you have ...

518
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,911
I said you have my approval.

519
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,230
It is up to you to get the cooperation of Paxton.

520
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:43,884
Christmas ...

521
00:50:45,571 --> 00:50:46,539
What will you do?

522
00:50:46,974 --> 00:50:49,288
I put all the men to follow the right track.

523
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:52,843
You drag it Unit at Delta, but it can not care what we do.

524
00:50:54,258 --> 00:50:56,821
Bill, can you excuse us, please?

525
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,991
I might advance you should have.

526
00:51:04,385 --> 00:51:05,714
That would have been nice.

527
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:10,123
It was not necessary, but it would have been better.

528
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:19,347
What is all this?

529
00:51:21,908 --> 00:51:25,159
I have appointed Bill Walden to Offcier Information.

530
00:51:25,471 --> 00:51:27,719
He keeps everything on reporting on the case.

531
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,286
Why do you want that guy so much chase?

532
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,531
I want to press' exercise m, figure out what it did with the body.

533
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:35,650
Do you think it's so stupid that he goes back there?

534
00:51:35,881 --> 00:51:37,037
If I'm staying shake ...

535
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,286
perhaps he leads me to a place where he or she can not hide so well.

536
00:51:39,614 --> 00:51:42,183
You hope but. - There is only one way to find out.

537
00:51:42,818 --> 00:51:44,381
I have here my men for UP or ....

538
00:51:44,382 --> 00:51:47,132
Come on Mike, are you going to help me or not? This guy killed a kid!

539
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:49,254
It could have been your son, or even mine.

540
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:51,947
Do not let me down. - How far do you want us to go?

541
00:51:52,248 --> 00:51:55,009
Surveillance only. He wanders all around around.

542
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:57,538
We're going to sit on the heels that will scream for help.

543
00:51:57,997 --> 00:52:00,070
But you want him to show that you're there.

544
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:02,114
Just supervise.

545
00:52:04,474 --> 00:52:07,133
You will not make you very popular along with this contest.

546
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:21,789
What are your initials again? - LAT

547
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:32,542
Leonard Alexander Thomas. Dat is T.H.O.

548
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,169
This is rather disturbing for them.

549
00:52:43,382 --> 00:52:52,905
Another one. Trask. Lester Aaron Trask.

550
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:29,235
Gee, I hate funerals.

551
00:53:31,693 --> 00:53:34,296
Do you come here often? - Father would find it inappropriate.

552
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:39,983
He would want you to love him. He does.

553
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:42,645
Sorry I was not there not there.

554
00:54:00,518 --> 00:54:02,766
Are you from the police, huh? Yeah, thought so ...

555
00:54:03,049 --> 00:54:05,066
I have a lot to do with it lately, good cops.

556
00:54:05,331 --> 00:54:07,722
What is John? - Nothing, a bunch of assholes.

557
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:10,861
Is something wrong? - No, nothing to worry, just go.

558
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:12,659
Put her in the car, I'll be right there.

559
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,772
Why do you follow me?

560
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:20,785
That Pole, is not it? Why he's picking on me?

561
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:22,310
What I'm done?

562
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:38,632
Chris will come soon, I'm sure.

563
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,666
He'd better have a good explanation when he comes here.

564
00:54:42,594 --> 00:54:44,164
That he certainly will.

565
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:57,684
I might take a look in his room?

566
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:10,580
I'll do it.

567
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:24,843
I feel so bad that I appealed to that day.

568
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:26,967
Not have to, it's good.

569
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,575
And ... where do you want it with me?

570
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:23,907
I have arranged for a team determines scans area ...

571
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:26,136
along the river.

572
00:56:29,221 --> 00:56:31,670
I need clothes that Chris has ever worn ...

573
00:56:32,136 --> 00:56:34,360
so dogs can go off on the smell.

574
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,954
That sounds not very good, is it?

575
00:56:37,265 --> 00:56:39,061
You'll find Chris for us, right?

576
00:56:41,328 --> 00:56:46,983
So we can bury him at least decent.

577
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:56,443
Promise me that you the man that has done does not get away with.

578
00:57:00,097 --> 00:57:02,975
Mr. Trask, I have reviewed the yearbook and ...

579
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:06,362
your son is one of them with the initials LAT

580
00:57:16,802 --> 00:57:19,134
It looks like the ring that I bought for Lester.

581
00:57:22,234 --> 00:57:24,882
Mr. Trask?
- Uhh, ja.

582
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:27,815
I'm talking about the ring?

583
00:57:34,114 --> 00:57:36,668
Our son has been missing for almost two years.

584
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:47,478
Let him know you're there, okay?

585
00:57:48,106 --> 00:57:50,794
But do not be a hero.

586
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,670
That's his car indeed. Where's it going so quickly?

587
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:03,358
No idea. - Your "Go to really grab that kid?

588
00:58:03,704 --> 00:58:05,506
That's what it says Kozenczak.

589
00:59:12,367 --> 00:59:13,862
Where are you guys so long?

590
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,977
Beginning bastard arrest me for speeding or what?

591
00:59:35,728 --> 00:59:37,293
Hé, Doug!

592
00:59:39,357 --> 00:59:41,461
Ho Ho Ho, iedereen!

593
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,116
How is John? - All right, I want some.

594
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:24,341
Gentlemen, you are John's bodyguards?

595
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:33,114
Who is that guy there, with our 'employer'?

596
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,299
That's Ted Koslo.

597
01:00:35,988 --> 01:00:37,322
Well, I can tell you anything?

598
01:00:37,895 --> 01:00:39,018
We have service.

599
01:00:39,798 --> 01:00:41,771
Commissioned by Mr. Gacy? - No.

600
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,182
Have fun, gentlemen.

601
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:03,082
We take him? - What For?

602
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,802
Possession of drugs.

603
01:01:07,989 --> 01:01:09,317
He asks for it.

604
01:01:10,992 --> 01:01:12,600
He gets his sentence not.

605
01:01:20,972 --> 01:01:24,930
John, what are you doing?

606
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:45,570
Can you just tell me what's going on?

607
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:26,045
You've done it again kind to each other today. - I appreciate it.

608
01:02:26,463 --> 01:02:28,089
We do what we can.

609
01:02:41,808 --> 01:02:44,810
I really think they can help - A medium?

610
01:02:45,688 --> 01:02:50,026
Give me a break, say. - There are plenty of departments here.

611
01:02:51,837 --> 01:02:55,422
How much did you tell her? - Nothing.

612
01:02:55,798 --> 01:03:00,091
All they know is the local news that a boy is missing.

613
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,090
All I know you could use any help.

614
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,532
Trask, Lester. A. For two years missing.

615
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:26,292
What did the Chicago Police, according to the parents about the disappearance?

616
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,415
Not so much, according to Mrs. Trask. - How can that be?

617
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:35,467
Their son, possession of a hatchback 3-4 years old who is also missing.

618
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,185
The police came there with a friend of his who still know Lester said

619
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:39,828
that he 'm would sell.

620
01:03:40,106 --> 01:03:43,357
Lester said he was tired of his job and that he needed money to go away.

621
01:03:43,699 --> 01:03:45,699
Do you think that happened? - No.

622
01:03:46,012 --> 01:03:47,167
Why not?

623
01:03:47,168 --> 01:03:49,532
He never collected the money from the company.

624
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:53,169
Which company, LPW? Roberts Laundry, Chicago.

625
01:03:54,173 --> 01:03:55,376
I'm sorry, Joe.

626
01:03:59,581 --> 01:04:02,392
Something of the proofs of the technical report?

627
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:04,884
Nothing, I'm afraid.

628
01:04:05,284 --> 01:04:08,625
And the blood I've found that board?

629
01:04:09,268 --> 01:04:13,006
Type 0, Chris' blood and also so that half of America.

630
01:04:16,939 --> 01:04:19,110
You need to talk again with Mrs. Trask.

631
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:21,517
That ring is not from himself walk into Gacy's house.

632
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:28,647
Joe? Lester's car, a 3-4 year old hatchback?

633
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,573
Invigilators Demarco and King.

634
01:04:31,887 --> 01:04:36,513
Gacy, together with a certain Ted Koslo to leave 02.00 property ...

635
01:04:37,202 --> 01:04:41,225
with a hatchback, a redhead, 3-4 years old.

636
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:46,544
What?

637
01:04:56,922 --> 01:04:59,056
We have all the time behind the wrong sittest?

638
01:04:59,746 --> 01:05:00,933
This may be just a coincidence.

639
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:04,119
Not with a registration number.

640
01:05:04,495 --> 01:05:06,970
Terry, I do not believe in coincidences, not with this.

641
01:05:07,493 --> 01:05:10,619
Only the consequences. Lester Trask missing.

642
01:05:10,923 --> 01:05:13,217
His car is missing and Koslo drive it around.

643
01:05:15,184 --> 01:05:17,714
What we have Koslo? - Not much.

644
01:05:18,174 --> 01:05:20,592
I've put in my time Gacy, what do we have?

645
01:05:20,871 --> 01:05:22,090
Burton has some checked.

646
01:05:22,372 --> 01:05:26,369
Current address, 2144 Rock Ridge Drive. - Ten minutes from the Austin pharmacist.

647
01:05:26,686 --> 01:05:29,153
And he was right there when Chris Gant disappeared.

648
01:05:29,703 --> 01:05:32,684
And Gacy also and found Trasks ring in Gacy's house.

649
01:05:34,623 --> 01:05:36,770
Koslo Gacy lived with for three years.

650
01:05:38,115 --> 01:05:39,779
6 months ago they almost get married.

651
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:42,246
At least we have that point of reference.

652
01:05:42,653 --> 01:05:44,358
Gacy was also married.

653
01:05:44,647 --> 01:05:46,061
You're really helpful, Bill.

654
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:57,023
Gacy and Koslo, has there ever been a warrant of Koslo?

655
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:59,191
No condemnation both here and in Chicago.

656
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:02,125
Maybe he is smarter than I ever thought possible.

657
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:06,211
Get him here, and we find out.

658
01:06:08,904 --> 01:06:10,189
How's it going, sir?

659
01:06:10,489 --> 01:06:11,392
Before.

660
01:06:12,073 --> 01:06:16,353
I get calls all the time. People who worry

661
01:06:16,354 --> 01:06:18,443
you might be back in the wrong seat.

662
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:21,834
They say he is trustworthy.

663
01:06:22,084 --> 01:06:24,301
I keep it in mind. - Nice.

664
01:06:25,918 --> 01:06:28,049
I do not think we do nothing, what should not.

665
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,976
It's more that we can achieve anything, then we should.

666
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:35,979
I just do not want you to dig a hole for yourself.

667
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,366
It is only one thing, not a career.

668
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,068
I'll remember that.

669
01:07:11,267 --> 01:07:13,087
That bastard is trying to murder us!

670
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:14,498
Hey, guys, problems to keep me?

671
01:08:16,364 --> 01:08:19,785
I'm here for my new lawyer. Jake Burns.

672
01:08:21,073 --> 01:08:23,315
Do you know him? - No, sir.

673
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:26,817
Well, you still. He is smart, very smart.

674
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,534
He knows how he can Kozenczak tiling keep chasing me

675
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:30,720
without any reason.

676
01:08:32,136 --> 01:08:33,499
You know, it's just too bad.

677
01:08:33,841 --> 01:08:37,650
I think it's pathetic how you are being hunted down by outdated Pool.

678
01:08:39,306 --> 01:08:41,853
John has sold it to me, $ 350, -

679
01:08:42,501 --> 01:08:44,292
What? - One year ago.

680
01:08:44,966 --> 01:08:47,760
Maybe longer ago. I think it has deceived me.

681
01:08:47,976 --> 01:08:49,807
That piece of junk slurps oil.

682
01:08:50,415 --> 01:08:51,948
Did you get a receipt from there?

683
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:55,446
You're right, I was there but thought of.

684
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:57,969
But you have the registration papers, of course.

685
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:01,093
Lost.

686
01:09:02,313 --> 01:09:03,344
Very unfortunate.

687
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:05,792
Row you who rides to Austin pharmacist?

688
01:09:07,342 --> 01:09:09,539
When was that? - Four nights ago.

689
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:11,417
The night that Chris Gant was gone.

690
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:16,357
Is it all about that? I drove that LPW van.

691
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:20,325
Twice, or not? - Yup.

692
01:09:20,793 --> 01:09:24,510
The second time I was commissioned by John back to pick up that book.

693
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:26,886
That car from him some problems.

694
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:29,233
We left as soon as possible.

695
01:09:32,282 --> 01:09:33,637
Where did you go?

696
01:09:35,596 --> 01:09:40,421
Home. That woman of mine, but there is not enough of it.

697
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:45,326
Have you ever seen or talked to Chris Gant?

698
01:09:46,002 --> 01:09:48,386
John said I did, he's lying.

699
01:09:48,673 --> 01:09:50,077
John with him spoken?

700
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:51,891
How the hell should I know?

701
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:41,268
Came the name Lester Trask it for?

702
01:10:41,518 --> 01:10:43,365
He had never heard of. Gacy lying.

703
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:46,614
He has seen a kid that Gacy took to LPW.

704
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,146
He says he has never done that.

705
01:10:48,147 --> 01:10:50,552
Say it well, tell him that he was waiting for.

706
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:54,775
Has he given you names? - He said he can remember nothing more.

707
01:10:55,153 --> 01:10:57,374
What you actually carry out there?

708
01:10:57,731 --> 01:11:01,496
If you feel better, go ahead. - Pardon Me.

709
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:07,121
Sorry, we're all tired. The case requires too much of us.

710
01:11:08,003 --> 01:11:09,098
Yeah, okay.

711
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:57,323
I thought you knew that he had two sides. That speech he gave.

712
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:03,145
But when it comes to sex ... - Who?

713
01:12:03,146 --> 01:12:06,131
Those guys work with him, I've told you.

714
01:12:06,132 --> 01:12:07,060
What guests?

715
01:12:07,061 --> 01:12:10,342
You can not remember? - I'm not lying.

716
01:12:10,633 --> 01:12:12,385
You have with him talking on the toilet.

717
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:16,854
Has happened to them? - How about it, Ted?

718
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:29,387
What? - They are all gone?

719
01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:33,168
Why do you ask it not him? - Because I ask you.

720
01:12:34,824 --> 01:12:37,792
You were at the pharmacy then disappeared Chris.

721
01:12:38,197 --> 01:12:41,782
You drive around in a car belonging to a missing boy.

722
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:44,981
John has sold me. - John, it's always John.

723
01:12:48,513 --> 01:12:50,511
You have nothing to do with it?

724
01:12:52,765 --> 01:12:54,889
What do you want from me? - The truth.

725
01:12:57,513 --> 01:13:00,534
You are way off, I have not screwed those boys.

726
01:13:00,763 --> 01:13:03,035
Right, that was John. - Yes but ...

727
01:13:03,036 --> 01:13:04,484
But what?

728
01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:07,667
He's not such a bad guest. He is good.

729
01:13:07,668 --> 01:13:10,427
And all that talk right? - You're almost crying.

730
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:12,156
What he did with all those boys?

731
01:13:12,476 --> 01:13:15,648
It was because of his father. He could not be there when he died.

732
01:13:16,678 --> 01:13:18,209
Why could not he be there, Ted?

733
01:13:18,581 --> 01:13:19,836
How should I know?

734
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:23,889
Where he was, Ted? - What does that make?

735
01:13:34,072 --> 01:13:36,294
Well, do you think he did it?

736
01:13:38,189 --> 01:13:40,791
Do you think he has told us everything he knows?

737
01:13:43,575 --> 01:13:47,374
Listen, I want you to investigate Gacy, something I had much rather be doing.

738
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:50,259
It's not your ... - No, no ... my mistake.

739
01:13:50,466 --> 01:13:51,776
Work right there.

740
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:55,983
inspector, a lady for your office. - Okay, thanks.

741
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,824
Terry, tell me about it, okay? - What do we do with Koslo?

742
01:14:00,031 --> 01:14:01,435
Atkins let take over.

743
01:14:07,378 --> 01:14:08,535
Thank you for coming.

744
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:11,798
I just got your message.

745
01:14:12,642 --> 01:14:14,473
It said that you wanted to talk about John?

746
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,909
You know we are separated?

747
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:27,300
I 'm not seen for two years. I do not know what you have to say.

748
01:14:27,953 --> 01:14:31,128
Gacy.

749
01:14:33,181 --> 01:14:36,305
I want to start an investigation into him.

750
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,815
Thanks You.

751
01:14:45,222 --> 01:14:47,839
It was a few months after our marriage.

752
01:14:52,896 --> 01:14:55,818
We made love and then he said ...

753
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:08,725
He said that the last time he enjoyed my presence ...

754
01:15:08,726 --> 01:15:10,788
because he had other feelings.

755
01:15:15,542 --> 01:15:19,319
Certainly sounds funny, is not it? - Not at all.

756
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:25,820
Then he began to invite men.

757
01:15:26,685 --> 01:15:27,895
Guys, really ...

758
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,537
And he pulled into the garage the next morning.

759
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:39,792
Ever been in the garage?

760
01:15:40,587 --> 01:15:42,448
Just to see what all was there?

761
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,623
He kept him always locked.

762
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,728
Moreover, it all did not matter.

763
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:58,074
Why did you stay with him?

764
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,502
I have two girls from my first marriage.

765
01:16:02,823 --> 01:16:05,159
I had money on him need to take care of them.

766
01:16:24,596 --> 01:16:26,672
John has ever talked about his father?

767
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:29,155
No. - About his youth?

768
01:16:29,513 --> 01:16:32,829
Only children for 'm working, they did everything for him.

769
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,076
Do you know if there was something happened to them?

770
01:16:38,390 --> 01:16:41,953
You mean that he brought to the garage? - Yup.

771
01:16:44,421 --> 01:16:46,047
Like what?

772
01:16:46,436 --> 01:16:48,912
As for example, someone was missing?

773
01:16:57,181 --> 01:16:59,782
There was a telephone call ...

774
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:04,932
a father who said his son was missing ...

775
01:17:05,177 --> 01:17:07,125
and John called him back.

776
01:17:09,029 --> 01:17:11,209
Has he ever called a name?

777
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:16,435
A certain Trask, perhaps?

778
01:17:21,335 --> 01:17:22,908
Miklovich.

779
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:28,250
I remember, it was something turkish or something.

780
01:17:28,688 --> 01:17:31,440
I was with my child outside and heard over the phone.

781
01:17:33,393 --> 01:17:34,805
What did he say?

782
01:17:35,174 --> 01:17:36,351
That he had better things to do ...

783
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:38,608
than some stupid kid that dropped him.

784
01:17:40,182 --> 01:17:42,491
Worked this child for him?

785
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:44,883
Are you sure he said that?

786
01:17:53,844 --> 01:17:55,048
Thanks to u.

787
01:17:55,934 --> 01:17:58,204
Kindly thank you for coming.

788
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:01,144
I appreciate it very much.

789
01:18:06,154 --> 01:18:09,839
You tell it anyway not against John? - No, of course not.

790
01:18:10,497 --> 01:18:12,585
He knows where I live. - I don 't understand.

791
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,344
I have it.

792
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:23,284
The reason he was not at home when his father died ...

793
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:25,435
he was wasting his time in prison at the time.

794
01:18:25,779 --> 01:18:27,249
For what? - Sodomy.

795
01:18:27,936 --> 01:18:29,546
Sodomy?

796
01:18:30,053 --> 01:18:31,645
Waterloo, Iowa, nine years ago.

797
01:18:32,184 --> 01:18:35,502
Terry, please contact Waterloo, and find out if there boys were involved.

798
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:36,748
I already did.

799
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:38,969
Files are locked, and the guy who works there is new ...

800
01:18:38,970 --> 01:18:40,157
and has never heard of.

801
01:18:40,451 --> 01:18:42,309
And the boss there, I know it's late ...

802
01:18:42,535 --> 01:18:44,658
Is on vacation, left today.

803
01:18:46,464 --> 01:18:48,397
Chose a good time, not?

804
01:18:48,702 --> 01:18:51,651
I go on, right away tomorrow, okay? - No, I'll do that.

805
01:18:51,890 --> 01:18:53,870
I want you to name natrekt who gave his ex-wife to me.

806
01:18:54,088 --> 01:18:55,713
I just do not know if it is spelled correctly.

807
01:18:56,037 --> 01:18:58,728
A missing boy? - I'm afraid so.

808
01:20:07,758 --> 01:20:11,105
There was a call for you. Des Plaines, Illinois.

809
01:20:11,781 --> 01:20:15,485
What was the message? - He said he was from the police.

810
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,746
What a miserable holiday weather.

811
01:20:28,905 --> 01:20:30,245
Ja, Waldron hier.

812
01:20:30,482 --> 01:20:33,437
Yeah, listen, we're working on a missing person here.

813
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:36,260
I reason to believe that John Gacy involved.

814
01:20:36,823 --> 01:20:38,479
You dutiful officer told us that you

815
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,983
was the right person to talk about that sodomy conviction.

816
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:43,543
Do you know that thing yet? - Yup.

817
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,575
What was the age of the missing? - A teenager.

818
01:20:48,451 --> 01:20:51,785
Guys? - Yes 16.5 years old.

819
01:20:52,169 --> 01:20:53,840
That's exactly his flesh.

820
01:20:54,325 --> 01:20:58,343
Waterloo was his Allessie. Taught at a Sunday class.

821
01:20:59,115 --> 01:21:01,284
The boys were all the time for him to work.

822
01:21:01,795 --> 01:21:04,658
Two years. - How did he get away with?

823
01:21:05,609 --> 01:21:10,100
He paid his way off. Something that could not bear the light.

824
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:12,360
Some have told their parents.

825
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:14,318
What did he do with them?

826
01:21:14,952 --> 01:21:17,344
Kept them in his house, one by one.

827
01:21:19,218 --> 01:21:22,205
Captivated their feet on a shelf.

828
01:21:23,614 --> 01:21:27,944
A rope wrapped around their neck ....

829
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,736
While he ... uuuhm ...

830
01:21:31,265 --> 01:21:34,358
Let them loose again after a month or 18.

831
01:21:35,016 --> 01:21:37,203
One of the boys ever missing?

832
01:21:37,204 --> 01:21:38,704
No, fortunately not.

833
01:21:39,128 --> 01:21:43,319
When she'm finally had indicated he escaped.

834
01:21:46,299 --> 01:21:47,706
Does he have one slain there?

835
01:21:51,519 --> 01:21:53,209
And.

836
01:22:02,852 --> 01:22:04,957
My son has been missing for three years next November

837
01:22:05,706 --> 01:22:08,224
He worked for LPW when it happened? - Yup.

838
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,549
That night when the old man died.

839
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:13,798
I tried him several times to call, but he never called back.

840
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:17,411
The Chicago Police dep. anything taken?

841
01:22:16,895 --> 01:22:18,332
I do not know. May Be.

842
01:22:19,205 --> 01:22:20,741
But you have to pick the man.

843
01:22:21,037 --> 01:22:23,897
I've seen him once when he brought my son home from work.

844
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:26,725
I saw how he looked at him.

845
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:30,895
You are all the same.

846
01:22:31,770 --> 01:22:34,043
You do not listen because I do not do so well understood.

847
01:22:35,023 --> 01:22:36,419
No, that's not the problem.

848
01:22:40,521 --> 01:22:42,076
It's not your fault.

849
01:22:43,272 --> 01:22:48,043
Gerald was not so big but looked very good.

850
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:55,398
Blond hair, blue eyes. Blue eyes like mother.

851
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:00,125
You tell me please ...

852
01:23:02,972 --> 01:23:07,483
He can still come back after such a long time?

853
01:23:10,044 --> 01:23:11,327
Quite a chore that you do.

854
01:23:11,565 --> 01:23:13,546
Yes, it is exactly what Bill wanted ...

855
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:15,765
and the rest of the team.

856
01:23:16,187 --> 01:23:17,855
I've never seen something similar ends.

857
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:20,793
But I see no prospect

858
01:23:20,794 --> 01:23:23,109
which could lead to Gacy.

859
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:26,158
Nothing at all, since the disappearance of Chris Gant.

860
01:23:26,456 --> 01:23:29,286
Come on, look at Iowa?

861
01:23:30,223 --> 01:23:32,283
Trask en Miklovich and?

862
01:23:32,668 --> 01:23:34,149
That is not evidence. - Okay.

863
01:23:34,389 --> 01:23:36,235
And you know ... - Yeah, okay, I will get there.

864
01:23:37,576 --> 01:23:39,767
It seems that you lost your perspective.

865
01:23:40,736 --> 01:23:41,944
What?

866
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:44,871
What? In what way?

867
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:47,381
The rest of your dept. runs in the background.

868
01:23:47,754 --> 01:23:50,878
Some of the team come up with the hours they have put into it.

869
01:23:51,133 --> 01:23:53,152
And who are they, Mike Paxton?

870
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,242
Have you found transport?

871
01:23:55,606 --> 01:23:58,062
Believe me, I try. I'm working on it.

872
01:23:58,285 --> 01:23:59,756
It is a difficult time of year to have to rent something ...

873
01:23:59,757 --> 01:24:01,622
It's just a tough time, period!

874
01:24:01,853 --> 01:24:04,256
And I have to believe in it but because he is right!

875
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:07,383
It is too idiotic for words, you had the task of ensuring!

876
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:11,476
I can no more time to spend here, Joe.

877
01:24:18,605 --> 01:24:21,219
Here are the detection commands. - Yeah, put it there.

878
01:24:21,634 --> 01:24:23,511
That should go to the court.

879
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:25,384
In ...

880
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,289
What?

881
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:32,291
And create concise summaries of the communications of the case.

882
01:24:37,075 --> 01:24:39,077
Office inspector Kozenczak you speak with.

883
01:24:42,217 --> 01:24:44,289
Rachel Grayson.
- Wie?

884
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:47,443
The media mieke lady.

885
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:53,578
I'm sorry, the inspector is not present.

886
01:24:55,985 --> 01:24:57,819
Oh yes, he is.

887
01:24:58,198 --> 01:25:00,861
And I have no need to know to find out.

888
01:25:06,975 --> 01:25:08,190
What did she say?

889
01:25:09,009 --> 01:25:10,110
No, I'll take it though.

890
01:25:11,521 --> 01:25:13,578
Listen, Miss Grayson, I appreciate ...

891
01:25:15,551 --> 01:25:16,768
I'll be there.

892
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,894
What have you found?

893
01:25:26,113 --> 01:25:27,393
Tire tracks. - Where Do You?

894
01:25:27,694 --> 01:25:28,916
Near the river.

895
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:30,956
They lay in the snow.

896
01:25:31,883 --> 01:25:34,114
They are there as long as when it disappeared boy.

897
01:25:35,317 --> 01:25:36,326
What's more?

898
01:25:36,817 --> 01:25:39,916
We found just down the river.

899
01:25:40,648 --> 01:25:44,021
Rather heavy? - A body?

900
01:25:44,417 --> 01:25:45,646
Could be.

901
01:25:46,042 --> 01:25:48,488
Can you uitdreggen the river? - Has become entirely ice.

902
01:25:48,865 --> 01:25:50,078
If he's your boy dumped there,

903
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,942
you will not find it earlier than in the spring.

904
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:56,208
What's with those tracks, they knock the old tracks?

905
01:25:56,209 --> 01:25:57,195
No.

906
01:25:57,397 --> 01:25:59,082
And the MPL bus? - No.

907
01:26:00,148 --> 01:26:01,929
The tires were new?

908
01:26:02,242 --> 01:26:03,431
In the front, it seems like it.

909
01:26:03,687 --> 01:26:05,457
And the spare tire? Did you checked?

910
01:26:05,458 --> 01:26:07,908
Of Course. - Check them only once for me.

911
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:09,939
No!

912
01:26:12,117 --> 01:26:13,751
And the dogs found something?

913
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:15,500
An odor detected?

914
01:26:15,751 --> 01:26:17,752
No, he or she must have really well washed.

915
01:26:19,899 --> 01:26:21,305
What does that dog there?

916
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:24,742
In this position?

917
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:32,877
He reacts if a body is found.

918
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:35,234
He has been hanging out all morning.

919
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,256
That's Gacy's car.

920
01:26:48,378 --> 01:26:51,222
Bragg, you have researched this vehicle and found nothing?

921
01:26:52,413 --> 01:26:53,487
Nothing At All.

922
01:26:55,148 --> 01:26:57,934
When this had happened before, which was then widely accepted as evidence?

923
01:26:58,152 --> 01:26:59,064
No.

924
01:27:13,934 --> 01:27:18,256
The next trick. The Indian rope trick.

925
01:27:18,647 --> 01:27:20,540
But for this I need music.

926
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:44,747
What does he do? - No idea.

927
01:27:45,872 --> 01:27:50,698
Look at you ... like a snake comes up.

928
01:27:56,821 --> 01:27:58,625
Boys and girls ...

929
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:03,509
For my next trick I need an assistant.

930
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:04,921
Who wants to help?

931
01:28:05,221 --> 01:28:08,010
No, no ... I need a smart guy.

932
01:28:08,596 --> 01:28:11,029
Very talented and very funny.

933
01:28:11,917 --> 01:28:13,636
What do you think?

934
01:28:17,906 --> 01:28:19,542
Sure, come here.

935
01:28:19,852 --> 01:28:22,011
come on guys, let him come here!

936
01:28:38,716 --> 01:28:40,159
Would you help me?

937
01:28:41,699 --> 01:28:42,566
What is your name?

938
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:43,950
Brian Hollister.

939
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:48,793
Brian Hollister will help me with the handcuffs trick.

940
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:51,014
The handcuffs-trick, indeed!

941
01:28:52,514 --> 01:28:54,786
For this trick we need handcuffs, right?

942
01:28:55,236 --> 01:28:58,535
No, no, no, we have real needs.

943
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:02,735
I know where we can get real.

944
01:29:03,451 --> 01:29:05,455
Stay here, I'll be back.

945
01:29:06,350 --> 01:29:07,516
Okay, we are going here then.

946
01:29:08,111 --> 01:29:13,139
Guess where we can find true? Here they are.

947
01:29:14,702 --> 01:29:16,395
Do you want me to say something?

948
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:19,550
What's wrong with my car? I need them for my business.

949
01:29:19,819 --> 01:29:21,784
You get them back when the investigation is over.

950
01:29:22,225 --> 01:29:24,327
For Real? Well, the investigation is over.

951
01:29:24,687 --> 01:29:28,141
I'm going to sue you, and you pat. 1 million.

952
01:29:28,485 --> 01:29:29,707
How flavors of apples now, stupid?

953
01:29:31,319 --> 01:29:34,666
Do not have nightmares? Terrible nightmares, Mr. Gacy?

954
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:36,062
I do.

955
01:29:36,698 --> 01:29:42,605
Mr. police, do not you know that a clown

956
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:44,580
can get away with murder?

957
01:29:47,355 --> 01:29:50,090
Look guys and girls .... handcuffs!

958
01:29:54,512 --> 01:29:58,732
Okay Brian, turn around and put your arms behind your back.

959
01:29:59,565 --> 01:30:00,669
There we go.

960
01:30:07,416 --> 01:30:11,029
Give me your wrist. Then we do one here ...

961
01:30:11,464 --> 01:30:15,246
and the other to do so. Nice tight so?

962
01:30:15,684 --> 01:30:17,121
Really, really tight so?

963
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:22,058
Okay, Brian, very good.

964
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:24,405
Well now kids, here comes the trick!

965
01:30:35,919 --> 01:30:39,781
To be continued ...

966
01:32:49,366 --> 01:32:53,587
This film is a true story. Some names, characters and events

967
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:58,114
have changed or created through collaboration.

968
01:32:59,272 --> 01:33:00,872
PART II

969
01:33:12,555 --> 01:33:16,053
Okay, let's start with these pine trees. Keep your dogs on hand

970
01:33:16,054 --> 01:33:17,307
and eyes open.

971
01:34:27,378 --> 01:34:28,728
Hallo, Mr. Gacy.

972
01:34:30,106 --> 01:34:32,035
Call me John, okay? - Yes, sir.

973
01:34:32,766 --> 01:34:35,809
You know why Koslo had such a hurry?

974
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:38,730
No, there is something?

975
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:44,339
He went looking for the stock.

976
01:34:45,562 --> 01:34:49,062
When does the bus back. - Fast, fast, damn fast.

977
01:34:55,661 --> 01:34:59,218
Billy, I've ever seen.

978
01:34:59,629 --> 01:35:01,766
You work well. - Thank u.

979
01:35:02,389 --> 01:35:07,387
Want to come along once, play a game of pool?

980
01:35:09,642 --> 01:35:10,891
Of Course.

981
01:35:11,233 --> 01:35:12,266
Beautiful.

982
01:35:16,783 --> 01:35:18,193
It does not really help this Christmas.

983
01:35:18,443 --> 01:35:20,152
Those guys are not there.

984
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:26,163
When they come back, debrief them equally and they're gone.

985
01:35:26,164 --> 01:35:28,475
They are good guests, Mike. You have a best team together.

986
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:30,504
I want them to do something, and do not pick their nose.

987
01:35:30,505 --> 01:35:34,180
Want to get away, go away ... I do know best.

988
01:35:34,181 --> 01:35:36,083
I do not like it, but understand.

989
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:38,661
The boss will be a lot happier

990
01:35:38,662 --> 01:35:40,622
as guests again running a normal service.

991
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:48,070
Those guys Centauri want you to talk to that psychic lady.

992
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:50,947
Exactly what I need. - Good for a few hours.

993
01:35:53,482 --> 01:35:56,648
In a few days it does not matter where Delta hang out, right?

994
01:35:57,191 --> 01:36:00,180
By the way, our cars are scrap. - I know, I know.

995
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:01,415
I will try to provide replacement.

996
01:36:01,685 --> 01:36:04,478
Flans them together. I do not manage the men together, the cobble.

997
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:06,873
Not for a while, but she's too Gacy quickly each time.

998
01:36:09,154 --> 01:36:11,671
Are you OK?

999
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:13,990
Yes.

1000
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:30,581
We appreciate that you've come by. - I wish I had better news.

1001
01:36:32,247 --> 01:36:36,719
You will still not give up, do you? - Nope.

1002
01:36:39,436 --> 01:36:42,299
It's like a nightmare.

1003
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:45,876
I keep praying that I wake up and ...

1004
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,751
Chris will be home.

1005
01:36:49,342 --> 01:36:51,806
Why would someone do? Why So?

1006
01:36:53,284 --> 01:36:56,546
He comes here not just walk away with it, do you?

1007
01:36:57,251 --> 01:37:00,063
No, not this time.

1008
01:37:00,407 --> 01:37:02,431
Mr. Gacy will not get away with it.

1009
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:12,459
With Kozenczak, Connect me with Toni Centori personally.

1010
01:38:18,131 --> 01:38:24,216
Toni told me you needed something, something personal to the individual.

1011
01:38:35,544 --> 01:38:43,723
He wore a checkered sweater? a blue windbreaker ...

1012
01:38:44,511 --> 01:38:47,747
The description of the clothes was in the newspaper article.

1013
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:53,534
You will not believe the supernatural, is it?

1014
01:38:59,421 --> 01:39:02,122
Did he have freckles?

1015
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:04,578
Yes, a few.

1016
01:39:05,327 --> 01:39:08,097
And a mole on his face? - Yup.

1017
01:39:08,324 --> 01:39:11,232
Right Here. -he had a small birthmark.

1018
01:39:30,375 --> 01:39:32,923
It is not easy died.

1019
01:39:45,537 --> 01:39:47,140
That denotes quite cross, right?

1020
01:39:47,141 --> 01:39:48,475
Of Course.

1021
01:39:48,827 --> 01:39:51,206
No, I mean, that cyst on your back.

1022
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:55,285
How did you know?

1023
01:39:55,641 --> 01:39:56,986
He will leave ...

1024
01:40:00,487 --> 01:40:03,235
when you've caught the killer.

1025
01:40:20,145 --> 01:40:22,958
His hands ... his hands are cuffed.

1026
01:40:24,114 --> 01:40:29,410
His hands were cuffed and he has deep cuts.

1027
01:40:30,426 --> 01:40:32,690
Deep cuts and a rope.

1028
01:40:33,832 --> 01:40:36,896
But not his hand.

1029
01:40:41,114 --> 01:40:43,237
He planned this.

1030
01:40:47,427 --> 01:40:53,034
He left that book so he had to come back a second time

1031
01:40:53,334 --> 01:40:54,884
to talk to Christopher.

1032
01:40:55,273 --> 01:40:56,991
He is a big man.

1033
01:40:57,332 --> 01:40:59,084
Big man, big arms.

1034
01:40:59,446 --> 01:41:02,772
Big hands and a black jacket.

1035
01:41:03,417 --> 01:41:05,650
A leather jacket, he works with his hands ...

1036
01:41:07,421 --> 01:41:08,740
That is Gacy.

1037
01:41:12,024 --> 01:41:13,882
His eyes ...

1038
01:41:16,767 --> 01:41:18,631
Behind his eyes ...

1039
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,149
That was not in that newspaper article, Joe.

1040
01:41:23,610 --> 01:41:25,296
He is so smart.

1041
01:41:25,742 --> 01:41:27,075
So smart.

1042
01:41:28,072 --> 01:41:31,963
So proud of himself that he cheated people, no guilt.

1043
01:41:35,973 --> 01:41:39,317
Has no guilt at all.

1044
01:41:44,877 --> 01:41:47,234
There is an instrument.

1045
01:41:48,812 --> 01:41:50,876
A shelf.

1046
01:42:00,904 --> 01:42:05,312
He let suffer Christopher lot before he died.

1047
01:42:13,697 --> 01:42:17,531
Can you tell me something about that ...

1048
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:19,937
what he has done with the body?

1049
01:42:24,103 --> 01:42:25,352
No.

1050
01:42:27,185 --> 01:42:30,726
Please, I need to find Chris.

1051
01:42:31,696 --> 01:42:32,884
I must find him.

1052
01:42:33,097 --> 01:42:35,964
This is perhaps the only way to find the killer.

1053
01:42:40,558 --> 01:42:41,918
Please ...

1054
01:43:04,169 --> 01:43:07,261
I see a building ...

1055
01:43:08,256 --> 01:43:16,230
and a tower, and something that connects the tower.

1056
01:43:17,545 --> 01:43:19,640
A machine, something with trucks ...

1057
01:43:19,936 --> 01:43:24,092
something with construction.

1058
01:43:28,809 --> 01:43:30,850
There are trees.

1059
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:34,895
Lots of trees.

1060
01:43:36,631 --> 01:43:39,068
En water...

1061
01:43:42,037 --> 01:43:43,790
and a sign.

1062
01:43:46,341 --> 01:43:52,103
The words ... Evergreen.

1063
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:58,028
And there is a large mound of earth.

1064
01:44:00,481 --> 01:44:01,998
I can not see what lies beneath.

1065
01:44:14,557 --> 01:44:16,929
I'm too tired, I can not do this anymore.

1066
01:44:17,337 --> 01:44:18,394
Do not stop, please.

1067
01:44:18,754 --> 01:44:20,745
Please, try it.

1068
01:44:24,222 --> 01:44:28,006
Where is heaven? I can 't not see!

1069
01:44:31,096 --> 01:44:34,723
The same people in the same dark place.

1070
01:44:37,097 --> 01:44:38,962
All those bodies.

1071
01:45:24,778 --> 01:45:26,215
Oh no ...

1072
01:45:28,513 --> 01:45:31,416
Do not let that be like then happened in Texas.

1073
01:45:35,009 --> 01:45:36,997
What are you talking about?

1074
01:45:40,247 --> 01:45:43,494
The man in Texas who tortured and killed all those guys.

1075
01:45:56,483 --> 01:46:00,062
Wat, Hanley? Arthur Hanley?

1076
01:46:00,379 --> 01:46:03,573
Is not that the man in Houston, who killed twelve guys?

1077
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:07,858
How dan?

1078
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:16,669
Miss Grayson, who dug the graves?

1079
01:46:18,325 --> 01:46:22,921
The man who killed Chris Grant.

1080
01:46:36,341 --> 01:46:38,507
There may be even more.

1081
01:46:41,357 --> 01:46:43,827
He comes here a long time away.

1082
01:46:45,768 --> 01:46:47,317
Holy shit.

1083
01:46:49,362 --> 01:46:51,576
Do you know what you are saying?

1084
01:46:51,924 --> 01:46:54,954
Do you understand themselves what you say to me?

1085
01:46:57,393 --> 01:47:01,050
How ... how can you be so sure of that?

1086
01:47:02,881 --> 01:47:05,270
I'm sure I've seen.

1087
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:37,955
A psychic? - I said, until tonight.

1088
01:47:38,908 --> 01:47:43,032
Listen, the way she described Gacy, you can do it better?

1089
01:47:43,769 --> 01:47:48,141
No, I have all held back the papers, you know very well, Jack.

1090
01:47:50,003 --> 01:47:53,062
Sure, the next time you'll definitely Oui-Ja boards use?

1091
01:47:55,472 --> 01:47:57,022
We should hold a seance.

1092
01:47:57,688 --> 01:48:02,206
Forward, forward say ... seriously.

1093
01:48:10,462 --> 01:48:11,588
Listen ...

1094
01:48:11,947 --> 01:48:13,588
I know it 's Christmas, okay?

1095
01:48:14,243 --> 01:48:16,134
I know I have a lot of yellowing in the case,

1096
01:48:16,453 --> 01:48:18,485
and that you have a lot of hours into it.

1097
01:48:19,329 --> 01:48:23,792
Yes, and I have to justify myself to the boss for all that overtime.

1098
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,410
I wish I was more into this box.

1099
01:48:38,012 --> 01:48:40,221
I wish I could understand you better.

1100
01:48:45,248 --> 01:48:47,831
I wish you would understand me better.

1101
01:48:48,278 --> 01:48:49,525
It is not you, Joe ...

1102
01:48:50,088 --> 01:48:51,357
it was the lady.

1103
01:48:54,246 --> 01:48:58,748
Okay, maybe you're right.

1104
01:48:58,999 --> 01:49:03,458
Maybe all they told me the last time it nonsense.

1105
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:06,922
But what I'm trying to say is, what if it is not?

1106
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:09,126
What if they're even right?

1107
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,533
What if that bastard now has even done what she said.

1108
01:49:11,746 --> 01:49:14,177
And we have to deal with a mass murderer?

1109
01:49:14,428 --> 01:49:19,061
Not only Christopher Gant, or Trask and all others that we know?

1110
01:49:19,531 --> 01:49:22,125
Only God knows how much he has helped soap.

1111
01:49:25,839 --> 01:49:28,089
What I'm saying is, what if she's right?

1112
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:30,010
If we stop now with it ...

1113
01:49:30,298 --> 01:49:30,956
If she's right ...

1114
01:49:31,247 --> 01:49:34,105
and we did not do anything to stop off this guy?

1115
01:49:35,246 --> 01:49:37,861
How Chris Gants must still go to die?

1116
01:49:43,761 --> 01:49:46,382
What I ask is a few extra days.

1117
01:49:55,006 --> 01:49:57,052
Just a few more days.

1118
01:50:01,802 --> 01:50:03,489
What do you think?

1119
01:50:10,822 --> 01:50:12,648
Can I talk to you, sir?

1120
01:50:13,008 --> 01:50:14,699
Can it wait? - I'm afraid not.

1121
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:17,015
It is important.

1122
01:50:20,733 --> 01:50:22,755
Go ahead, we'll wait for you.

1123
01:50:34,010 --> 01:50:35,515
What happens there?

1124
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:38,202
I want a second search warrant. - Forget it.

1125
01:50:38,494 --> 01:50:40,476
I have new information. - From whom?

1126
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:44,588
That I have a phone call this morning. - I do too.

1127
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,307
Gacy's lawyer.

1128
01:50:46,558 --> 01:50:47,672
Burns, about what?

1129
01:50:47,912 --> 01:50:50,557
A lawsuit that he tightens against you and the whole corps.

1130
01:50:50,820 --> 01:50:52,212
His client has warned.

1131
01:50:52,484 --> 01:50:53,837
Why was not I informed?

1132
01:50:54,369 --> 01:50:55,084
I do not know,

1133
01:50:55,618 --> 01:50:56,854
I thought he blew but what the high towers.

1134
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:58,765
$ 750,000 worth.

1135
01:50:59,073 --> 01:51:01,088
Wrong threats, unlawful interference and

1136
01:51:01,292 --> 01:51:02,705
the impossibility to carry out his business,

1137
01:51:03,057 --> 01:51:06,015
rather that damages his reputation. And so on.

1138
01:51:06,357 --> 01:51:07,836
When does it occur?

1139
01:51:08,182 --> 01:51:10,014
A day or two at the end of the week at the latest.

1140
01:51:10,277 --> 01:51:12,245
He goes for a restraining order

1141
01:51:12,495 --> 01:51:15,121
and research should be put stop. - What?

1142
01:51:15,529 --> 01:51:18,185
The judge will assign him that? - There you can count on.

1143
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:20,621
You can not fight it? - On what grounds?

1144
01:51:21,839 --> 01:51:22,811
Moreover, Don told me

1145
01:51:23,216 --> 01:51:24,923
that he was anyway has become.

1146
01:51:26,419 --> 01:51:27,718
I'm already late.

1147
01:51:39,272 --> 01:51:41,361
We voted, while you were gone.

1148
01:51:42,111 --> 01:51:44,918
Popularity contest? - Something like that, yes.

1149
01:51:47,063 --> 01:51:49,250
And I won or lost?

1150
01:51:49,592 --> 01:51:51,771
We decided ... - We all are.

1151
01:51:55,282 --> 01:51:58,252
that we are here with you.

1152
01:51:59,233 --> 01:52:00,625
Thanks You.

1153
01:52:01,283 --> 01:52:03,874
Let's hope we can keep enough distance Gacy.

1154
01:52:14,655 --> 01:52:17,052
Mike, what did you tell your men?

1155
01:52:18,587 --> 01:52:20,348
You take out? - Yup.

1156
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:21,986
Speak.

1157
01:52:22,439 --> 01:52:24,021
So far he has played a game with us,

1158
01:52:24,254 --> 01:52:26,063
let's turn the tables for once and make him mad?

1159
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:28,833
We put him under so much pressure that the bad in him comes out.

1160
01:52:29,204 --> 01:52:32,243
We're so close to him that we'm able to turn on his back.

1161
01:52:32,613 --> 01:52:33,938
He might find fun too.

1162
01:52:33,770 --> 01:52:34,746
I want him cornering, Mike.

1163
01:52:34,747 --> 01:52:36,844
Let him think that we are closer than he thinks.

1164
01:52:38,844 --> 01:52:41,654
There's something bothering me for days, I could not tell what it was.

1165
01:52:41,961 --> 01:52:44,769
Then this morning, after the meeting, I looked at how the maps layers.

1166
01:52:45,078 --> 01:52:46,967
It was the second conversation with Mrs. Trask.

1167
01:52:47,281 --> 01:52:49,489
She told me that there are other things were missing ...

1168
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:52,897
including a portable TV that she him had given.

1169
01:52:53,941 --> 01:52:54,654
What is that?

1170
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:56,485
One of those photos that the technicians of the

1171
01:52:56,815 --> 01:52:58,533
evidence taken into Gacy's house.

1172
01:52:59,236 --> 01:53:01,296
Do you remember that office in Gacy's bedroom? -Yup?

1173
01:53:04,714 --> 01:53:07,213
Look what the desk on top of state?

1174
01:53:10,714 --> 01:53:13,375
Mrs. Trask holds papers of her son's stuff?

1175
01:53:14,202 --> 01:53:17,925
I'm going over there to see if they can find the guarantee certificate.

1176
01:53:18,197 --> 01:53:20,056
Anything but also to identify with numbers.

1177
01:53:20,813 --> 01:53:22,152
Must be a lot of work.

1178
01:53:22,547 --> 01:53:23,892
No, it is worth it.

1179
01:53:25,105 --> 01:53:27,361
Applies to everything we this bastard even catch them.

1180
01:53:27,362 --> 01:53:29,125
I will let you know. - Good work, Terry.

1181
01:53:30,375 --> 01:53:32,813
Not bad. - They are all good.

1182
01:53:33,825 --> 01:53:35,330
When Gacy but is not better.

1183
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:37,512
Mike, I want to see what happens

1184
01:53:37,749 --> 01:53:39,970
if we confront him with all the names of the missing boys.

1185
01:53:41,113 --> 01:53:42,831
Worth to try.

1186
01:53:44,121 --> 01:53:49,340
The description of the lady where the dead are ...

1187
01:53:49,767 --> 01:53:51,080
have you recorded it?

1188
01:53:51,297 --> 01:53:52,650
The last time I went there ...

1189
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:55,404
I've spent the whole night sufgepiekerd in Des Plaines.

1190
01:53:55,405 --> 01:53:59,650
Everything came up. That scout camp there in '76?

1191
01:53:59,891 --> 01:54:01,997
I am admitted to go.

1192
01:54:03,801 --> 01:54:08,058
Am still searching. - You let yourself fool anyway, I hope?

1193
01:54:08,393 --> 01:54:10,957
She had left the cyst on my holy foot.

1194
01:54:13,060 --> 01:54:14,541
What did she say?

1195
01:54:15,218 --> 01:54:18,684
She told me that the pain would stop when Gacy would catch you.

1196
01:54:19,671 --> 01:54:22,017
I knew you had a personal interest in this case.

1197
01:54:22,416 --> 01:54:25,154
Yes, I must go. It feels right this time, huh?

1198
01:54:32,809 --> 01:54:37,499
Mrs. Trask? Still on the papers of the TV to your son?

1199
01:54:38,094 --> 01:54:40,745
I'm sorry, I've looked everywhere.

1200
01:54:42,154 --> 01:54:43,969
The warranty card, right? - Yes ma'am.

1201
01:54:44,219 --> 01:54:46,361
He stands by that guy? - It could help.

1202
01:54:52,413 --> 01:54:55,889
You know, the last few days they came up with that ring ...

1203
01:54:56,109 --> 01:54:57,858
I thought at times, but that was never done.

1204
01:54:58,075 --> 01:55:00,232
The final blow comes so hard.

1205
01:55:01,004 --> 01:55:03,781
The fact that he will never come back.

1206
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:10,097
The last summer holidays in LA were

1207
01:55:10,098 --> 01:55:12,882
we are with Lester on the beach there and ...

1208
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:20,141
A while we hoped yet. We gave it a moment.

1209
01:55:22,171 --> 01:55:24,889
I'm sorry that we have caused you more pain.

1210
01:55:26,516 --> 01:55:28,238
Yes you do ...

1211
01:55:34,292 --> 01:55:37,017
I will go again looking for that paper.

1212
01:55:41,082 --> 01:55:44,516
And this here? - Member of the family, recently deceased.

1213
01:55:44,830 --> 01:55:46,446
He was there a few days ago.

1214
01:55:47,769 --> 01:55:49,772
This is John Gacy's father?

1215
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:53,724
Excuse me, sir, but why are you here?

1216
01:55:54,801 --> 01:55:56,567
It has to do with the newly deceased?

1217
01:55:57,117 --> 01:55:58,386
Yes, but not this.

1218
01:55:58,868 --> 01:56:01,669
Look, it may sound a bit macabre ...

1219
01:56:01,929 --> 01:56:04,615
This thing I'm doing, runs a little in this direction ...

1220
01:56:05,957 --> 01:56:07,899
What is the chance that someone got here?

1221
01:56:08,165 --> 01:56:09,363
Let's say during the night,

1222
01:56:09,586 --> 01:56:11,711
that he buries oneself?

1223
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:13,239
It is quite possible.

1224
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,584
We have only two guards walking around at night.

1225
01:56:15,822 --> 01:56:17,301
Here?

1226
01:56:18,259 --> 01:56:19,634
My dear heaven.

1227
01:56:19,904 --> 01:56:21,680
Do you think?

1228
01:56:22,883 --> 01:56:25,850
You must have permission ... - No, I understand.

1229
01:56:25,851 --> 01:56:28,044
Can you give me the name, please?

1230
01:56:51,850 --> 01:56:55,048
A tower ... equipment.

1231
01:56:56,447 --> 01:56:59,112
Trucks are there, something with construction ....

1232
01:57:02,668 --> 01:57:04,532
And there is a large mound of earth,

1233
01:57:04,533 --> 01:57:06,421
I can not see what lies beneath.

1234
01:57:06,422 --> 01:57:08,816
It may be a body.

1235
01:57:18,043 --> 01:57:20,015
Can you agree to tell you what there was to it uitvreten?

1236
01:57:20,325 --> 01:57:21,920
Mr. 'foreman' of that construction company called you sure?

1237
01:57:21,921 --> 01:57:23,441
That he has indeed done, damn it.

1238
01:57:23,721 --> 01:57:26,438
What does the dep. there do not find?

1239
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:27,655
Chris his body might lie underneath.

1240
01:57:27,889 --> 01:57:29,513
And all for such a psychic figure?

1241
01:57:29,789 --> 01:57:31,689
Who talks about her controlling everything here.

1242
01:57:34,139 --> 01:57:35,668
Both buildings.

1243
01:57:37,326 --> 01:57:38,420
Revealed?

1244
01:57:38,855 --> 01:57:41,217
Have you told Carlson anomieme about that call?

1245
01:57:41,218 --> 01:57:42,954
Approximately, my mistake.

1246
01:57:42,955 --> 01:57:45,904
It's your fault that everyone knows about that paranormal human.

1247
01:57:46,516 --> 01:57:49,362
I would suggest that all research but stopping right now.

1248
01:57:50,716 --> 01:57:52,215
But you do not.

1249
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,685
No. And do you know why?

1250
01:57:54,887 --> 01:57:56,124
Why So?

1251
01:57:56,716 --> 01:57:58,779
Because if you Gacy not arrested during his short hairs ...

1252
01:57:59,247 --> 01:58:00,893
Not just your career is now at stake.

1253
01:58:01,749 --> 01:58:05,028
everyone runs the risk of being thrown in court.

1254
01:58:05,029 --> 01:58:06,343
Why So? I'm the one who did it.

1255
01:58:06,344 --> 01:58:08,123
And I've accepted that. - He's as guilty as hell.

1256
01:58:08,365 --> 01:58:09,053
I hope so.

1257
01:58:09,374 --> 01:58:11,156
And it's not just Chris Gant more. - I know that.

1258
01:58:11,438 --> 01:58:13,115
We will seize him? - Who do you mean?

1259
01:58:13,329 --> 01:58:14,803
We, the team, they believe in it.

1260
01:58:15,092 --> 01:58:17,303
Is that including Mike Paxton? - Yup.

1261
01:58:18,877 --> 01:58:20,857
Ja, new ...

1262
01:58:21,271 --> 01:58:23,092
Much time you have no more to prove.

1263
01:58:25,314 --> 01:58:27,344
I think it must give permission to pay.

1264
01:58:27,345 --> 01:58:28,468
Thanks You.

1265
01:58:29,157 --> 01:58:31,896
What's a few hundred dollars compared with 750,000.

1266
01:58:33,516 --> 01:58:34,910
Listen, Joe ...

1267
01:58:35,284 --> 01:58:37,463
Pull it not to you personally. - But?

1268
01:58:38,427 --> 01:58:40,211
I do not think you will succeed.

1269
01:58:40,456 --> 01:58:42,930
That bastard has too many connections, too smart for us ...

1270
01:58:42,931 --> 01:58:45,409
We ... - You're wrong.

1271
01:58:45,846 --> 01:58:47,501
We'll know in a few days, right?

1272
01:58:48,803 --> 01:58:49,878
Good night, Joe.

1273
01:59:41,933 --> 01:59:44,351
You sit outside your district so look no problems.

1274
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,381
A bit dimming can also.

1275
01:59:46,729 --> 01:59:50,750
Get out here. - Not that blonde, it is tasty.

1276
01:59:51,669 --> 01:59:52,978
John says it's okay.

1277
01:59:55,389 --> 01:59:57,919
Will you might come along, something to drink?

1278
01:59:58,949 --> 02:00:01,075
Sounds good, if I say so myself.

1279
02:00:12,387 --> 02:00:14,089
Wait, who are you do not, damn it?

1280
02:00:15,327 --> 02:00:20,702
Those are my guards. You still get greetings John Miklovich.

1281
02:00:22,328 --> 02:00:24,014
He said he works for you.

1282
02:00:24,793 --> 02:00:27,483
I remember one with such a name. Do you?

1283
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:31,730
He described your otherwise good. Coarse, big belly.

1284
02:00:32,077 --> 02:00:34,162
What you drinking, John?

1285
02:00:35,093 --> 02:00:36,939
Who do you know who you're talking to?

1286
02:00:38,725 --> 02:00:41,174
I want your name and rank. Write it down.

1287
02:00:41,547 --> 02:00:43,827
I'll throw you in court, along with that stupid pole.

1288
02:00:45,609 --> 02:00:48,609
You're making a big mistake, John. We are completely on your side.

1289
02:00:49,234 --> 02:00:51,788
This pool has only enough guts.

1290
02:00:52,721 --> 02:00:55,862
I cock nothing more. - Right you are.

1291
02:00:56,313 --> 02:00:59,454
And let that shelf you see with those handcuffs.

1292
02:01:01,818 --> 02:01:03,631
That board, who do you mean?

1293
02:01:04,923 --> 02:01:07,066
Do you still have left more mess when you left?

1294
02:01:08,017 --> 02:01:09,603
No idea what he's talking about.

1295
02:01:11,921 --> 02:01:16,771
Shall we go to your house? Build party?

1296
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:23,017
Do you care to supply?

1297
02:01:24,316 --> 02:01:28,385
We do not need, John? Bragg has enough nipples.

1298
02:01:29,293 --> 02:01:31,515
Well there you have certainly nothing to say anymore, do you?

1299
02:01:31,516 --> 02:01:33,669
Do you like dirty games?

1300
02:01:39,889 --> 02:01:41,702
How?

1301
02:01:44,203 --> 02:01:45,810
He knows very well what I'm talking about.

1302
02:01:46,068 --> 02:01:47,327
The car you sold him,

1303
02:01:47,694 --> 02:01:49,422
who belonged to one of those missing boys?

1304
02:01:55,164 --> 02:01:57,533
Do we have that, or what?

1305
02:02:03,244 --> 02:02:04,508
Have'm told that name?

1306
02:02:05,058 --> 02:02:06,963
How did he get the fuck up?

1307
02:02:07,275 --> 02:02:08,774
No idea, I'm not telling.

1308
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:10,621
I beat the shit out of your mouth that, understand?

1309
02:02:10,932 --> 02:02:12,778
I swear to you. I do that with you.

1310
02:02:13,061 --> 02:02:17,418
And that car that you have an auction, you understand?

1311
02:02:17,854 --> 02:02:19,713
John, I've done what you told me.

1312
02:02:20,027 --> 02:02:21,792
That's right.

1313
02:02:22,145 --> 02:02:24,214
Everything I've ever said, ever.

1314
02:02:26,374 --> 02:02:27,642
Open it.

1315
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:29,465
Hold on, John. What are you doing?

1316
02:02:29,718 --> 02:02:30,903
Open it.

1317
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,564
The godvervloekte bemoeizieke smeris.

1318
02:02:39,002 --> 02:02:41,346
If he comes back here, but he can swim better.

1319
02:02:55,421 --> 02:02:59,171
Since we gestopgezet the water level has risen to pump.

1320
02:03:00,954 --> 02:03:04,075
That does not stop us from what is against all there.

1321
02:03:25,096 --> 02:03:26,637
Kozenczak inspector?

1322
02:03:27,005 --> 02:03:28,984
Hendricks here, from the construction company.

1323
02:03:29,327 --> 02:03:30,882
They have moved to earth for you.

1324
02:03:31,129 --> 02:03:32,452
Literally.

1325
02:03:35,609 --> 02:03:36,888
I do not know where you got that story

1326
02:03:36,889 --> 02:03:38,262
that there is a body below would sit.

1327
02:03:39,534 --> 02:03:43,115
Our lost time and lost your money. I'm sorry.

1328
02:03:58,739 --> 02:04:01,995
Pam, you call the boss's office? I'd better go to.

1329
02:04:02,473 --> 02:04:03,927
She has found it? - What you wanted?

1330
02:04:04,162 --> 02:04:06,510
Mrs. Trask. The papers of the TV of her son.

1331
02:04:13,414 --> 02:04:17,458
He is there. - Keep that serial number but at hand.

1332
02:04:22,219 --> 02:04:25,197
What was he doing there? - For a renovation job.

1333
02:04:25,577 --> 02:04:26,852
Or so he said.

1334
02:04:27,194 --> 02:04:28,804
He tells us what he does all the time.

1335
02:04:29,241 --> 02:04:31,312
He has not allowed us into his home.

1336
02:04:32,874 --> 02:04:34,695
Do you think it will happen again?

1337
02:04:35,322 --> 02:04:37,506
What For? - For those TV in his bedroom.

1338
02:04:38,093 --> 02:04:39,883
With or without a warrant?

1339
02:04:40,226 --> 02:04:41,196
We have that serial number

1340
02:04:41,197 --> 02:04:42,778
to see if he'll belonged to Lester Trask.

1341
02:04:43,102 --> 02:04:45,952
If they just look around, we're in deep shit.

1342
02:04:46,282 --> 02:04:48,163
We need it for this case.

1343
02:05:03,284 --> 02:05:04,979
Me to check, or them?

1344
02:05:05,355 --> 02:05:07,191
I'd have to check you, Mr. Gacy?

1345
02:05:07,796 --> 02:05:09,571
I can leave here when I want.

1346
02:05:09,865 --> 02:05:12,640
I could fly somewhere where nobody sniffs me ...

1347
02:05:13,681 --> 02:05:15,866
as Brzozów perhaps? - I would not try.

1348
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:18,212
There is nothing that could stop me.

1349
02:05:18,711 --> 02:05:20,277
That's not right, and you're lying.

1350
02:05:20,682 --> 02:05:24,140
You are the one who is wrong, asshole. - Calm down, Mr. Gacy.

1351
02:05:26,718 --> 02:05:28,754
He is annoying, Mr. Gacy?

1352
02:05:31,254 --> 02:05:33,165
You take it well for him?

1353
02:05:35,944 --> 02:05:37,716
It'll do.

1354
02:05:40,254 --> 02:05:41,662
He is bothering you, John?

1355
02:05:41,663 --> 02:05:42,932
It is so good.

1356
02:05:44,008 --> 02:05:45,736
He's not like you guys.

1357
02:05:46,321 --> 02:05:48,374
You better do what he says little pool, heh?

1358
02:05:50,134 --> 02:05:51,633
But not for long, stupid!

1359
02:05:52,281 --> 02:05:55,168
Do you hear me? Not for long!

1360
02:06:12,291 --> 02:06:13,946
Do they have him identify?

1361
02:06:14,822 --> 02:06:18,430
Mr. Koslo was instructed to say nothing about the missing boys.

1362
02:06:19,226 --> 02:06:20,856
The next time he will deny that he

1363
02:06:20,857 --> 02:06:23,527
Gacy has seen that he messed around with them.

1364
02:06:23,783 --> 02:06:25,949
Okay, I said, but I do not know what he did to them.

1365
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:28,419
Honest. Hey, inspector.

1366
02:06:30,854 --> 02:06:33,673
Can not you take me hard that I just believe?

1367
02:06:34,888 --> 02:06:37,011
Come on, you have not worked for him,

1368
02:06:37,355 --> 02:06:38,809
you're just a drinking buddy of him.

1369
02:06:38,755 --> 02:06:40,532
You partied with him, lived in his house.

1370
02:06:40,986 --> 02:06:43,693
Nothing against it? - You saw him with young boys in his garage.

1371
02:06:43,694 --> 02:06:45,048
He went after them, after I moved.

1372
02:06:45,581 --> 02:06:47,940
And then there's that car, which sold Gacy you.

1373
02:06:48,207 --> 02:06:49,694
Who belonged to one of the missing boys ...

1374
02:06:49,929 --> 02:06:50,739
where did that story come from?

1375
02:06:50,983 --> 02:06:52,959
Ask John? - Because I ask you!

1376
02:06:53,292 --> 02:06:55,613
A used car that comes from an auction.

1377
02:06:56,292 --> 02:06:58,115
And you believe that? - Yup.

1378
02:06:58,364 --> 02:07:01,022
If you remember one time I smile intentionally strike him off your face.

1379
02:07:03,679 --> 02:07:05,740
Ted, we need to lock Gacy.

1380
02:07:07,165 --> 02:07:09,452
Whether we hold you together with him ...

1381
02:07:09,771 --> 02:07:10,991
if you do not help us.

1382
02:07:11,265 --> 02:07:12,961
I can not tell you what I do not know, do you?

1383
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,742
Indeed.

1384
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:26,337
That is a polygraph, Ted.

1385
02:07:26,995 --> 02:07:28,360
A polygraph.

1386
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:31,057
It can prove whether you are saying the truth.

1387
02:07:32,165 --> 02:07:33,766
But that is entirely up to you.

1388
02:07:34,354 --> 02:07:36,433
We can not force you to it.

1389
02:07:46,366 --> 02:07:47,368
What should you do?

1390
02:07:47,587 --> 02:07:48,783
It is icy cold.

1391
02:07:49,003 --> 02:07:51,494
Go complain to that pool of yours.

1392
02:07:51,814 --> 02:07:53,055
To hell with him!

1393
02:07:53,392 --> 02:07:55,001
Come with us, somewhere drinking.

1394
02:07:55,275 --> 02:07:58,161
Then we come back and watch some TV.

1395
02:07:58,818 --> 02:08:02,004
What do you think? - I gotta make some calls.

1396
02:08:03,126 --> 02:08:06,035
If you do not come with us, invite us get out?

1397
02:08:06,715 --> 02:08:08,291
Hear no evil intentions.

1398
02:08:17,725 --> 02:08:20,899
Have you seen Chris Gant? - Nope.

1399
02:08:26,843 --> 02:08:29,183
The machine says you're lying, Teddy.

1400
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:33,614
Okay, I've seen. - Where Do You?

1401
02:08:34,568 --> 02:08:36,631
In the pharmacy, that night.

1402
02:08:41,522 --> 02:08:43,538
Have you seen Chris when he came out ...

1403
02:08:43,786 --> 02:08:47,134
to talk about a part-time job at LPW Construction?

1404
02:08:49,061 --> 02:08:50,822
No, I had already left.

1405
02:08:52,974 --> 02:08:56,070
Did you know that Gacy was waiting outside on Chris?

1406
02:08:56,869 --> 02:08:57,854
No.

1407
02:09:03,226 --> 02:09:05,967
Gacy Chris has taken home?

1408
02:09:08,445 --> 02:09:10,634
I do not know, I was not around, I went straight home.

1409
02:09:39,765 --> 02:09:41,277
Thank you for letting us.

1410
02:09:41,608 --> 02:09:43,046
Is beautiful here, John.

1411
02:09:50,081 --> 02:09:52,871
And can you shoot? - I do.

1412
02:09:54,707 --> 02:09:57,202
And what have you got? - Whiskey.

1413
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:58,810
Same for me.

1414
02:10:00,654 --> 02:10:02,858
Wait, where the hell do you go to?

1415
02:10:03,105 --> 02:10:04,676
I have to go pee.

1416
02:10:06,097 --> 02:10:08,496
Hey, where's my drink?

1417
02:10:13,748 --> 02:10:15,891
Nice room here, John.

1418
02:10:17,795 --> 02:10:20,435
What hangs there, all charters.

1419
02:10:21,122 --> 02:10:23,031
Here You Go.

1420
02:10:25,658 --> 02:10:28,147
Is that you with Rosalyn Carter?

1421
02:10:28,706 --> 02:10:29,748
You bet.

1422
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:32,435
She was a great first lady.

1423
02:10:32,717 --> 02:10:33,971
Nice too.

1424
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:10,815
Man Of The Year, very impressive.

1425
02:11:12,345 --> 02:11:14,499
Yes they organized a big parade for me.

1426
02:11:14,785 --> 02:11:16,002
Jack?

1427
02:11:17,307 --> 02:11:18,337
What he carries in his shield?

1428
02:11:22,022 --> 02:11:23,614
Jack, what are you doing there?

1429
02:11:25,332 --> 02:11:26,743
A while yet!

1430
02:11:40,972 --> 02:11:42,398
Where is my drink, John?

1431
02:11:44,391 --> 02:11:45,273
Fuck off.

1432
02:11:45,912 --> 02:11:47,690
Flicker both here!

1433
02:11:48,378 --> 02:11:49,724
Hell out and leave me alone!

1434
02:11:50,471 --> 02:11:51,597
You know what we need!

1435
02:11:51,830 --> 02:11:53,313
Say that even at that damned Polish bastard of you!

1436
02:11:53,617 --> 02:11:54,939
Just do exactly the same!

1437
02:11:59,648 --> 02:12:00,943
And? - Gotcha.

1438
02:12:05,555 --> 02:12:07,571
You say something?

1439
02:12:09,599 --> 02:12:11,677
No, sir, what is it?

1440
02:12:12,037 --> 02:12:13,807
That we just try to find out.

1441
02:12:15,666 --> 02:12:18,071
I suggest that we go through list of places.

1442
02:12:18,334 --> 02:12:19,678
Maybe if that helps.

1443
02:12:19,927 --> 02:12:21,725
If the place you say something,

1444
02:12:22,570 --> 02:12:25,778
only answer 'yes' or 'no'.

1445
02:12:29,160 --> 02:12:32,180
Treeline Road. - At the river?

1446
02:12:32,761 --> 02:12:34,163
Yes or no.

1447
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:36,476
No.

1448
02:12:38,075 --> 02:12:39,632
Summerhill Road.

1449
02:12:40,569 --> 02:12:41,657
No.

1450
02:12:42,727 --> 02:12:44,101
Gacy's huis.

1451
02:12:49,885 --> 02:12:51,325
Garage.

1452
02:12:54,593 --> 02:12:55,945
The bedroom.

1453
02:12:59,135 --> 02:13:00,404
The attic.

1454
02:13:02,243 --> 02:13:04,199
The crawl space under the house.

1455
02:13:07,064 --> 02:13:08,407
I'm not going any further.

1456
02:13:08,668 --> 02:13:10,386
Ever been there, Ted?

1457
02:13:11,124 --> 02:13:13,294
And as for Gacy, what will he do?

1458
02:13:17,013 --> 02:13:18,888
You knew damn well what would happen to me.

1459
02:13:19,816 --> 02:13:20,731
No.

1460
02:13:21,974 --> 02:13:23,449
No, Ted, you're wrong.

1461
02:13:23,949 --> 02:13:25,091
You gotta believe me, Ted.

1462
02:13:28,380 --> 02:13:31,141
I do not want that man gives someone grief.

1463
02:13:31,485 --> 02:13:32,627
No more.

1464
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,952
I let him.

1465
02:13:38,298 --> 02:13:40,015
I let him do me once.

1466
02:13:41,939 --> 02:13:45,786
Since he has done this, I have become a real troublemaker, huh?

1467
02:13:46,704 --> 02:13:47,754
No.

1468
02:13:52,701 --> 02:13:53,826
What?

1469
02:13:57,578 --> 02:13:58,912
Say it to me.

1470
02:14:00,844 --> 02:14:02,391
What is it, Ted?

1471
02:14:05,484 --> 02:14:08,894
I had for him some pits dug down there.

1472
02:14:09,486 --> 02:14:11,095
In the crawlspace.

1473
02:14:12,945 --> 02:14:16,414
He said it was meant for downpipes.

1474
02:15:08,457 --> 02:15:11,399
Ms. Carlson is there? - Sorry, she just left.

1475
02:15:11,823 --> 02:15:13,661
It is very important that I speak to her.

1476
02:15:14,101 --> 02:15:16,087
They will be at home, but only very late.

1477
02:15:19,398 --> 02:15:23,945
Come on, tell me, what lies told about me that whole pool?

1478
02:15:24,257 --> 02:15:27,332
Nothing, I swear. - You lied to me, little blow.

1479
02:15:27,612 --> 02:15:28,957
I do not, call me not.

1480
02:15:29,272 --> 02:15:30,833
Oh no? Tell me then.

1481
02:15:31,236 --> 02:15:34,315
How dare those dastardly bag to sneak my home.

1482
02:15:34,956 --> 02:15:36,821
Come on, John. - I'm not lying.

1483
02:15:37,116 --> 02:15:39,149
Why he does so well to me, why?

1484
02:15:39,768 --> 02:15:41,580
I'm such a bad guy at all.

1485
02:15:44,425 --> 02:15:46,393
If I find out that you're lying to me,

1486
02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:49,323
I'll kill you, too, understand?

1487
02:15:50,177 --> 02:15:51,507
I'll kill you.

1488
02:15:53,396 --> 02:15:58,196
I will not screw up. - You could not come in?

1489
02:15:58,973 --> 02:16:01,959
I've been in, even in the bedroom.

1490
02:16:04,207 --> 02:16:06,053
Have checked the wrong number.

1491
02:16:06,710 --> 02:16:09,212
I looked at the model number, I had to have the serial number.

1492
02:16:09,831 --> 02:16:11,804
I was nervous, I admit.

1493
02:16:12,776 --> 02:16:14,617
I did about it in my pants.

1494
02:16:15,697 --> 02:16:17,419
It still had not decided.

1495
02:16:17,709 --> 02:16:21,370
That air, I think he let him shit everywhere.

1496
02:16:24,418 --> 02:16:26,994
I laughed not for you, I would also have been nervous.

1497
02:16:28,447 --> 02:16:30,764
It's just how the whole circus fare.

1498
02:16:32,904 --> 02:16:34,228
I gotta get outta here.

1499
02:16:35,023 --> 02:16:37,245
Come on, I'll buy you a beer to cry.

1500
02:16:50,712 --> 02:16:52,558
Detective? -ja?

1501
02:16:53,275 --> 02:16:57,048
Is that information that crawlspace put on tape, or not?

1502
02:16:57,842 --> 02:17:01,872
No, he was too far away from the microphone when he said that.

1503
02:17:02,867 --> 02:17:04,871
Too Bad.

1504
02:17:05,869 --> 02:17:09,368
And polygraph test, there is something true?

1505
02:17:09,738 --> 02:17:11,744
No, not really true.

1506
02:17:13,681 --> 02:17:15,651
Then there is still provided no evidence

1507
02:17:15,652 --> 02:17:17,652
Chris Gant ever been in Gacy's house.

1508
02:17:18,387 --> 02:17:20,652
What would you call proof?

1509
02:17:21,705 --> 02:17:23,490
Another search warrant?

1510
02:17:25,057 --> 02:17:26,732
What you need is a body.

1511
02:17:27,329 --> 02:17:29,675
Since I have that second command is needed.

1512
02:17:30,050 --> 02:17:31,405
Search the bodies.

1513
02:17:33,124 --> 02:17:35,045
It's late. - Sorry to bother you.

1514
02:17:35,312 --> 02:17:36,147
Not very.

1515
02:17:36,426 --> 02:17:39,364
By the way, there will be at the arraignment on Friday morning.

1516
02:17:39,935 --> 02:17:42,455
Friday morning? That still gives me three days.

1517
02:17:42,850 --> 02:17:44,883
You have luck, it had previously been.

1518
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:48,257
Under these circumstances, I see you have not

1519
02:17:48,258 --> 02:17:50,695
command to get a search warrant.

1520
02:17:51,195 --> 02:17:52,039
Good night.

1521
02:18:44,198 --> 02:18:47,134
They follow us? - No, those are my bodyguards.

1522
02:18:48,355 --> 02:18:50,886
It's true. I do undercover work.

1523
02:18:51,386 --> 02:18:53,609
For the Chicago Police Special Unit.

1524
02:18:54,013 --> 02:18:56,596
That's between you and me, understand?

1525
02:18:57,106 --> 02:18:58,219
Yes of course.

1526
02:18:58,981 --> 02:19:00,199
Ho even, John.

1527
02:19:02,788 --> 02:19:04,159
Who is your friend?

1528
02:19:04,514 --> 02:19:06,573
My friend, Billy. we are going to play a game of pool.

1529
02:19:08,296 --> 02:19:10,016
Is that okay?

1530
02:19:10,796 --> 02:19:11,873
Of Course.

1531
02:19:21,017 --> 02:19:23,392
Fine, you guys doing your job well.

1532
02:19:28,172 --> 02:19:30,160
He would do anything, do you?

1533
02:19:30,568 --> 02:19:32,111
As he said, he knows we're here.

1534
02:20:13,133 --> 02:20:14,515
I've woken up.

1535
02:20:14,796 --> 02:20:16,136
That gives nothing.

1536
02:20:18,213 --> 02:20:22,806
You bought the tree. With Michael?

1537
02:20:24,029 --> 02:20:25,870
He wanted you not to bother.

1538
02:20:29,671 --> 02:20:32,027
Yes, that's something I promised to do with him.

1539
02:20:38,342 --> 02:20:39,779
How are things?

1540
02:20:41,745 --> 02:20:43,307
Not so good.

1541
02:20:47,215 --> 02:20:49,062
Come to bed.

1542
02:20:56,050 --> 02:20:58,388
I make you awake only when I leave again.

1543
02:20:59,150 --> 02:21:00,593
I do not care.

1544
02:21:01,277 --> 02:21:02,715
I miss you alone.

1545
02:21:03,312 --> 02:21:04,859
Me too.

1546
02:21:10,364 --> 02:21:12,122
What was that dentist again?

1547
02:21:14,498 --> 02:21:16,219
You mean Ernie Graham?

1548
02:21:16,673 --> 02:21:18,030
Ja, Ernie.

1549
02:21:19,028 --> 02:21:21,155
You should have married Ernie, when you had the chance.

1550
02:21:22,028 --> 02:21:23,189
It's never too late.

1551
02:21:26,276 --> 02:21:28,023
All those in the armed forces.

1552
02:21:29,389 --> 02:21:32,677
I still can not believe there is anything sinister in it.

1553
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:42,147
I wish I was just a little smarter.

1554
02:21:43,452 --> 02:21:48,462
I only have to look at gacy and I'm already sick.

1555
02:21:49,026 --> 02:21:50,809
you're smart enough.

1556
02:21:59,591 --> 02:22:01,119
If there was a God ...

1557
02:22:02,076 --> 02:22:04,841
how would he then as a man so live?

1558
02:22:05,604 --> 02:22:07,057
He gives us life.

1559
02:22:07,582 --> 02:22:09,468
How do we deal with it is our decision.

1560
02:22:09,673 --> 02:22:10,828
Free will?

1561
02:22:12,139 --> 02:22:15,264
Free will murder innocent boys? - Hold on.

1562
02:22:17,442 --> 02:22:20,622
Hold on to interrogate me, in what I believe.

1563
02:22:26,828 --> 02:22:29,264
Stop punishing yourself so.

1564
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:23,393
And will it?

1565
02:23:23,642 --> 02:23:24,701
Not so good.

1566
02:23:26,052 --> 02:23:27,711
I will give you at a lesson.

1567
02:23:28,294 --> 02:23:31,233
You take the shot. Hold the cue.

1568
02:23:32,113 --> 02:23:34,241
Make a strong bridge.

1569
02:23:34,895 --> 02:23:37,802
A smooth stroke and follow him.

1570
02:23:38,574 --> 02:23:40,013
That's better, huh?

1571
02:23:40,334 --> 02:23:41,790
Come on, try it yourself.

1572
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:53,058
You must be lower.

1573
02:23:53,772 --> 02:23:56,049
Below, watch the cue.

1574
02:23:56,743 --> 02:23:58,369
That's him, gently.

1575
02:24:01,744 --> 02:24:03,651
What do you think of that?

1576
02:24:04,369 --> 02:24:07,461
Just lucky, he hit him just before.

1577
02:24:07,776 --> 02:24:09,278
You must be joking.

1578
02:24:10,148 --> 02:24:11,587
Maybe a few times.

1579
02:24:11,962 --> 02:24:13,070
And then a little harder.

1580
02:24:13,577 --> 02:24:17,853
They now call a recreational addiction.

1581
02:24:19,341 --> 02:24:21,904
And that's exactly what we do here, his recreational busy.

1582
02:24:25,467 --> 02:24:27,359
I know what you need.

1583
02:24:28,778 --> 02:24:30,684
You need something to drink.

1584
02:24:33,669 --> 02:24:36,123
And then we're going to play a game.

1585
02:24:37,245 --> 02:24:39,017
The best way to practice.

1586
02:24:43,526 --> 02:24:46,092
Those guys make themselves quite worried about you, huh?

1587
02:24:47,812 --> 02:24:48,871
And ...

1588
02:24:49,499 --> 02:24:51,280
There they are also paid for.

1589
02:24:57,405 --> 02:24:58,834
I start to get better.

1590
02:25:00,658 --> 02:25:02,301
Yes, you're a quick learner, Billy.

1591
02:25:05,528 --> 02:25:07,561
Maybe I'll learn something else.

1592
02:25:08,598 --> 02:25:11,251
And that is? - Just a little trick I know.

1593
02:25:12,393 --> 02:25:13,783
Here's your drink.

1594
02:25:15,313 --> 02:25:17,866
Come on drinking in one gulp, like a real man.

1595
02:25:22,813 --> 02:25:25,629
Very good, son.

1596
02:25:39,847 --> 02:25:42,770
Why locked? - The boogeyman.

1597
02:25:49,628 --> 02:25:52,627
Beer. The kid is still there, huh?

1598
02:26:05,253 --> 02:26:07,900
Are you quite freethinking what sex is concerned, Billy?

1599
02:26:10,214 --> 02:26:11,474
Pardon?

1600
02:26:13,163 --> 02:26:15,339
There are other ways to enjoy.

1601
02:26:16,814 --> 02:26:18,067
I have a girlfriend.

1602
02:26:18,426 --> 02:26:19,650
You'll have enough.

1603
02:26:21,370 --> 02:26:22,849
A handsome as you.

1604
02:26:25,788 --> 02:26:28,536
Thanks for the game and the time.

1605
02:26:28,973 --> 02:26:30,509
It was pleasant to me.

1606
02:26:31,415 --> 02:26:32,508
I have to go again.

1607
02:26:33,818 --> 02:26:34,968
Of Course.

1608
02:26:54,030 --> 02:26:55,699
One settler? - I really should go.

1609
02:26:57,562 --> 02:26:58,633
Wait a second ...

1610
02:26:59,414 --> 02:27:01,321
And that trick, then, that I still wanted to show?

1611
02:27:02,117 --> 02:27:03,665
I do not know. I have to go.

1612
02:27:04,096 --> 02:27:08,126
Hey, Billy. Denotes something?

1613
02:27:08,643 --> 02:27:10,777
No, it's just late and I must go.

1614
02:27:11,079 --> 02:27:13,536
Before long, I'll show you how it works.

1615
02:27:14,903 --> 02:27:17,098
Already done with your girlfriend?

1616
02:27:20,085 --> 02:27:21,600
Should I put on or something?

1617
02:27:21,912 --> 02:27:23,556
No, you do not order.

1618
02:27:24,961 --> 02:27:26,286
I do them.

1619
02:27:27,757 --> 02:27:29,349
What do you think of that?

1620
02:27:33,524 --> 02:27:35,178
Make sure they are tight.

1621
02:27:40,494 --> 02:27:43,645
You have them really tightly done, I'm not sure I ...

1622
02:27:44,794 --> 02:27:46,634
Wow, that is really tight.

1623
02:27:47,523 --> 02:27:49,115
Keep equally solid.

1624
02:27:50,633 --> 02:27:52,130
What a trick. - Yeah, huh.

1625
02:27:52,447 --> 02:27:53,444
How do you do that?

1626
02:27:53,454 --> 02:27:54,480
There's just one catch on,

1627
02:27:54,481 --> 02:27:56,047
I turnover if they are violated.

1628
02:27:56,281 --> 02:27:57,952
Give it a try.

1629
02:27:58,537 --> 02:27:59,800
Come on.

1630
02:27:59,801 --> 02:28:01,382
Give it a try.

1631
02:28:03,234 --> 02:28:04,673
Not that way.

1632
02:28:05,484 --> 02:28:07,130
You must have your hands behind your back.

1633
02:28:08,798 --> 02:28:11,569
That gives more of an impression. Then they do not see what you're doing.

1634
02:28:13,266 --> 02:28:14,109
Come on.

1635
02:28:16,692 --> 02:28:17,956
Good.

1636
02:28:22,947 --> 02:28:24,292
That is one.

1637
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:30,103
That's two.

1638
02:28:31,542 --> 02:28:32,833
Forward.

1639
02:28:33,846 --> 02:28:35,385
Come on, try to get out.

1640
02:28:52,336 --> 02:28:53,694
It can not.

1641
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:02,293
Hey, come on now.

1642
02:29:06,013 --> 02:29:07,334
Watch me.

1643
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:12,211
Here You Go.

1644
02:29:19,026 --> 02:29:20,772
You know what the real trick is?

1645
02:29:22,955 --> 02:29:25,619
Dit is 'm.

1646
02:29:27,648 --> 02:29:30,052
The real trick is the key, stupid!

1647
02:29:31,712 --> 02:29:32,793
Hey, come on now.

1648
02:29:36,802 --> 02:29:38,184
Well do not do that.

1649
02:29:40,369 --> 02:29:41,746
Do not hurt me.

1650
02:29:42,257 --> 02:29:43,765
Please, do not hurt me.

1651
02:29:45,741 --> 02:29:47,048
Here You Go ...

1652
02:29:48,245 --> 02:29:50,327
Say again "please."

1653
02:29:52,590 --> 02:29:53,705
Here You Go.

1654
02:30:00,246 --> 02:30:01,948
Please, do not hurt me.

1655
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:07,090
Come on, handsome.

1656
02:30:09,279 --> 02:30:10,811
Come on, say "please."

1657
02:30:14,058 --> 02:30:15,623
Here You Go ...

1658
02:31:24,878 --> 02:31:26,912
I bring my guest home.

1659
02:31:28,366 --> 02:31:30,001
You follow?

1660
02:31:31,163 --> 02:31:32,849
I'm sure he arrives safely.

1661
02:31:55,756 --> 02:31:57,175
It seems that we are crazy.

1662
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:16,709
I'm sorry, I turned that on.

1663
02:32:18,187 --> 02:32:19,667
I can come home.

1664
02:32:20,060 --> 02:32:22,533
Do not be silly, it's no trouble.

1665
02:32:27,567 --> 02:32:29,280
Do you love your job, Billy?

1666
02:32:31,943 --> 02:32:33,496
And the money that you earn it?

1667
02:32:42,398 --> 02:32:47,775
Call this one but ...

1668
02:32:49,807 --> 02:32:51,370
bonus.

1669
02:32:51,924 --> 02:32:53,275
Suit.

1670
02:32:53,276 --> 02:32:54,760
Take it.

1671
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:03,808
Think of it as overtime.

1672
02:33:08,092 --> 02:33:09,639
I'll take you home.

1673
02:33:35,654 --> 02:33:37,928
That dirty bastard put me under pressure.

1674
02:33:38,252 --> 02:33:39,646
He feels responsible for what I do.

1675
02:33:40,687 --> 02:33:42,528
I would him well for his head to shoot.

1676
02:33:42,529 --> 02:33:44,934
Do not worry, it's all over Friday,

1677
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:46,281
it's like a nightmare.

1678
02:33:46,552 --> 02:33:50,315
If the lawsuit is ... - Stop those threats.

1679
02:33:50,805 --> 02:33:53,035
You sure? - Come on, John, believe me.

1680
02:34:11,098 --> 02:34:12,971
I have some of you or something? - Calm down.

1681
02:34:14,362 --> 02:34:15,808
A real bastard.

1682
02:34:16,970 --> 02:34:20,380
And that calls himself police? - You stink.

1683
02:34:20,722 --> 02:34:22,162
Like the house, John?

1684
02:34:24,021 --> 02:34:25,596
You do it in your pants, huh?

1685
02:34:25,913 --> 02:34:27,150
You have nothing to do with me.

1686
02:34:27,487 --> 02:34:28,879
I want both names on the list.

1687
02:34:29,367 --> 02:34:32,401
Along with Kozenczak, I want their names on that suit.

1688
02:34:32,912 --> 02:34:34,910
Quiet, John, it's not worth it.

1689
02:34:35,214 --> 02:34:35,995
Indeed.

1690
02:34:36,348 --> 02:34:37,550
Indeed, it's not worth it.

1691
02:34:37,867 --> 02:34:39,399
In a few days it's all over.

1692
02:34:40,476 --> 02:34:41,634
I have a message for you.

1693
02:34:41,882 --> 02:34:43,707
Tell that stupid pole of you,

1694
02:34:44,333 --> 02:34:46,599
Friday that the tooth for a tooth.

1695
02:35:23,384 --> 02:35:25,667
Sorry I'm not over come the last days,

1696
02:35:28,166 --> 02:35:30,012
I brought this camera.

1697
02:35:32,886 --> 02:35:34,685
Has it helped you?

1698
02:35:38,290 --> 02:35:40,040
Any news about Chris?

1699
02:35:43,354 --> 02:35:45,200
When are you going to arrest this man?

1700
02:35:45,482 --> 02:35:46,855
That is a matter for the police, dear.

1701
02:35:48,166 --> 02:35:49,875
We do everything in our power.

1702
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:54,418
Chris made a lot of pictures.

1703
02:35:57,907 --> 02:35:59,786
And we have so little of himself.

1704
02:36:01,169 --> 02:36:02,432
Maybe there are some true,

1705
02:36:02,665 --> 02:36:04,388
if Cindy has some developed.

1706
02:36:04,735 --> 02:36:07,980
You coul us resolve to accompany the lunch?

1707
02:36:08,266 --> 02:36:09,754
Is dat Cindy Beck?

1708
02:36:10,250 --> 02:36:12,140
That girl who worked with him in the pharmacist?

1709
02:36:13,202 --> 02:36:16,137
Do you remember when that was, when they that role

1710
02:36:16,138 --> 02:36:17,982
took to develop?

1711
02:36:18,252 --> 02:36:19,410
I mean, it could have been when

1712
02:36:19,732 --> 02:36:21,422
Chris was gone?

1713
02:36:27,475 --> 02:36:28,441
Bragg...

1714
02:36:28,388 --> 02:36:29,995
That night when we were searching Gacy's house

1715
02:36:30,199 --> 02:36:31,212
I found a receipt for a roll of film,

1716
02:36:31,213 --> 02:36:32,203
you've encountered that?

1717
02:36:32,437 --> 02:36:33,422
That was a week ago.

1718
02:36:33,869 --> 02:36:37,148
That was a blue-white recuutje.

1719
02:36:37,603 --> 02:36:39,152
Is it important? - Yes, that is quite good.

1720
02:36:47,495 --> 02:36:48,540
That's it.

1721
02:36:49,902 --> 02:36:52,298
Envelope 48406, stood up to be developed

1722
02:36:52,299 --> 02:36:54,529
December 11, okay?

1723
02:36:56,652 --> 02:36:58,716
Ja, Cindy Beck.

1724
02:36:59,510 --> 02:37:01,966
Yes, but I do not see ... - We found it between Gacy's waste.

1725
02:37:02,747 --> 02:37:06,215
Yes thank you.

1726
02:37:08,483 --> 02:37:11,183
Cindy Beck, found? - Yes, fine ... thanks.

1727
02:37:11,733 --> 02:37:13,873
The school where she's told me she has swimming meeting,

1728
02:37:14,114 --> 02:37:15,519
she has not been reached then late in the afternoon.

1729
02:37:17,342 --> 02:37:18,997
Why is that thing there?

1730
02:37:19,330 --> 02:37:21,044
You have the declaration of the first day?

1731
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:23,496
Nothing about what movie or receipt whatsoever.

1732
02:37:24,654 --> 02:37:26,125
When can we see her at the earliest?

1733
02:37:26,437 --> 02:37:28,219
The first bus will drop off the kids at school.

1734
02:37:28,437 --> 02:37:29,903
We will be waiting for her there, come on.

1735
02:39:13,842 --> 02:39:15,006
Hey, kid?

1736
02:39:20,226 --> 02:39:21,445
How you doin '?

1737
02:39:22,524 --> 02:39:27,634
Maybe you want to earn some money? - What to do?

1738
02:39:28,553 --> 02:39:30,279
Construction work.

1739
02:39:36,966 --> 02:39:38,632
You will not find that to earn,

1740
02:39:39,074 --> 02:39:40,542
Come on, get in.

1741
02:41:34,355 --> 02:41:36,305
Cindy, this is very important.

1742
02:41:36,585 --> 02:41:38,069
We found this in the house of a man,

1743
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:40,083
we keep suspected to have killed Chris.

1744
02:41:42,419 --> 02:41:43,553
Here You Go.

1745
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:50,333
I put 't in his jacket.

1746
02:41:51,389 --> 02:41:54,425
The jacket that he wore when he came into contact with his officer contractions?

1747
02:41:58,266 --> 02:42:00,612
He asked Jack to put on, because it was cold

1748
02:42:00,613 --> 02:42:02,506
but I did not think he would catch a cold.

1749
02:42:07,238 --> 02:42:09,726
She was sure she has attracted jacket that night?

1750
02:42:09,957 --> 02:42:11,178
Yes, definitely.

1751
02:42:11,957 --> 02:42:14,605
But Jack was not available during the search, right?

1752
02:42:14,866 --> 02:42:17,239
That jacket was not there, it recuutje though.

1753
02:42:21,772 --> 02:42:22,915
No ...

1754
02:42:24,960 --> 02:42:27,600
That's still not enough for a second command.

1755
02:42:28,331 --> 02:42:29,160
When is it?

1756
02:42:29,599 --> 02:42:31,004
When is it enough?

1757
02:42:31,441 --> 02:42:32,782
You forget that he has filed suit

1758
02:42:33,002 --> 02:42:34,006
against you and the whole department.

1759
02:42:34,243 --> 02:42:35,429
All the more reason!

1760
02:42:35,690 --> 02:42:36,907
Caution is advised.

1761
02:42:37,522 --> 02:42:42,439
Fotorecuutje that does not say much that Chris was in Gacy's house.

1762
02:42:42,806 --> 02:42:46,032
If it's a bit too fast for you, you'll still be surprised.

1763
02:42:46,690 --> 02:42:47,767
Be surprised?

1764
02:42:48,345 --> 02:42:49,681
Chris Gant is dood.

1765
02:42:50,243 --> 02:42:52,554
Other guys are dead, are you talking about ...

1766
02:42:54,136 --> 02:42:56,676
Hoskins ... you and Kozenczak take the statement

1767
02:42:57,038 --> 02:42:58,272
the girl once more by ...

1768
02:42:58,489 --> 02:43:00,222
I hear it in the morning.

1769
02:43:00,621 --> 02:43:04,694
Why do they suddenly have such a hurry?

1770
02:43:04,972 --> 02:43:07,216
She has season tickets to the bowls.

1771
02:43:07,726 --> 02:43:09,838
Shall we go through this just in my office?

1772
02:43:10,088 --> 02:43:12,148
Nothing office. Listen, stop here, asshole.

1773
02:43:12,694 --> 02:43:14,574
This nonsense can thus no longer continue.

1774
02:43:14,847 --> 02:43:16,448
We need a second command,

1775
02:43:16,662 --> 02:43:19,632
Gacy and his lawyer before us silenced.

1776
02:43:34,571 --> 02:43:35,330
Jake!

1777
02:43:35,768 --> 02:43:36,915
Jake!

1778
02:43:38,375 --> 02:43:41,090
Let that godverse Fuck gang at last stop!

1779
02:43:41,372 --> 02:43:42,683
They make me crazy, completely crazy!

1780
02:43:44,958 --> 02:43:45,733
They make me crazy.

1781
02:43:46,113 --> 02:43:47,083
Come on, let's see what we can do ...

1782
02:43:47,311 --> 02:43:48,596
do not worry, come on.

1783
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:52,028
There they are, let them go, Jake.

1784
02:43:52,656 --> 02:43:53,690
It's good.

1785
02:43:54,048 --> 02:43:55,601
The Fuck with you!

1786
02:43:55,939 --> 02:43:58,343
We have commissioned Mr. Gacy to shadows,

1787
02:43:58,584 --> 02:43:59,530
that's what we do.

1788
02:43:59,934 --> 02:44:01,407
This is completely illegal!

1789
02:44:02,188 --> 02:44:03,844
Like kidnapping and murder ...

1790
02:44:04,177 --> 02:44:05,751
What are you still there?

1791
02:44:06,122 --> 02:44:08,594
Why do you talk with those two, damn it! Come here!

1792
02:44:11,311 --> 02:44:14,278
They sneak into my house, which is a liar Koslo ...

1793
02:44:14,279 --> 02:44:15,823
the herrieschopper!

1794
02:44:30,012 --> 02:44:31,403
Honey, I'm home.

1795
02:44:31,665 --> 02:44:32,881
Waking up.

1796
02:44:34,922 --> 02:44:35,921
Yet what happened?

1797
02:44:36,887 --> 02:44:38,387
Nope, still there.

1798
02:45:10,749 --> 02:45:13,157
Whatever you do, do not let it go.

1799
02:45:13,578 --> 02:45:15,549
Shoot at the tires of his car, as it should be.

1800
02:45:15,858 --> 02:45:17,327
What are you talking about? What is up?

1801
02:45:18,265 --> 02:45:21,415
It's just a beast. I still can not believe it.

1802
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:35,354
You alright? You know not what you do, John?

1803
02:45:35,355 --> 02:45:37,237
Please, let me see a doctor before you settle.

1804
02:45:38,021 --> 02:45:41,072
Hands off, do not touch me.

1805
02:45:48,216 --> 02:45:50,652
Just like the fucking kids, you can not have one fag with it.

1806
02:45:52,600 --> 02:45:54,234
Net als Gant.

1807
02:45:55,921 --> 02:45:58,191
He deserves to die.

1808
02:45:59,380 --> 02:46:01,507
I just realized ...

1809
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:22,080
Go behind it on. He runs off.

1810
02:47:12,840 --> 02:47:14,214
Sorry I woke you.

1811
02:47:14,513 --> 02:47:15,622
I could not sleep when I got home.

1812
02:47:16,184 --> 02:47:18,385
Something kept me busy, with regard to Gacy's house.

1813
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:21,875
It is the smell. So he loves the place.

1814
02:47:22,236 --> 02:47:24,535
It could even kill that dog yet as he held it.

1815
02:47:24,973 --> 02:47:27,235
That was me already noticed, Joe.

1816
02:47:27,705 --> 02:47:30,144
It smelled just like it in Chicago PD

1817
02:47:31,157 --> 02:47:32,421
So crazy.

1818
02:47:33,346 --> 02:47:35,591
Like everything there to smoke in the morgue.

1819
02:47:36,935 --> 02:47:37,989
We go.

1820
02:47:44,140 --> 02:47:45,517
John, it's just a breakfast.

1821
02:47:45,861 --> 02:47:47,459
Watch out, I'll take you home.

1822
02:47:48,066 --> 02:47:51,063
I want you to stay with me a while.

1823
02:47:51,563 --> 02:47:53,599
Too many things to keep me busy now.

1824
02:47:53,970 --> 02:47:56,658
I find out what I'm gonna do, you drive.

1825
02:48:10,849 --> 02:48:13,606
Listen, he is sure how the smoke in the toilet.

1826
02:48:13,948 --> 02:48:15,490
It smelled so in the morgue.

1827
02:48:15,790 --> 02:48:17,795
While you had the urge to basketball games.

1828
02:48:17,796 --> 02:48:19,648
Or what the hell was.

1829
02:48:20,576 --> 02:48:22,177
How did you come into the house?

1830
02:48:22,758 --> 02:48:25,356
The weather was something illegal or whatever?

1831
02:48:25,860 --> 02:48:27,731
Yes, they have broken the rule.

1832
02:48:28,069 --> 02:48:31,234
Gacy let them into his house to have a drink,

1833
02:48:31,493 --> 02:48:33,242
while it was their duty.

1834
02:48:33,505 --> 02:48:35,486
Is it against the rules to use

1835
02:48:35,487 --> 02:48:37,587
the toilet of the accused?

1836
02:48:37,960 --> 02:48:42,545
If you tell me that you need more evidence for a second search

1837
02:48:42,788 --> 02:48:45,122
To check out what we have until now.

1838
02:48:47,850 --> 02:48:50,186
First, a fotorecuutje.

1839
02:48:50,528 --> 02:48:53,442
The recuutje what Cindy Beck stopped in the jacket

1840
02:48:53,719 --> 02:48:56,416
what Chris was wearing on the night when he disappeared.

1841
02:48:56,883 --> 02:48:59,129
The same recuutje I found in Gacy's kitchen.

1842
02:48:59,758 --> 02:49:02,730
We have an experienced policeman who convinces is

1843
02:49:02,731 --> 02:49:04,993
to have the death smelt from the fan

1844
02:49:05,281 --> 02:49:07,253
the toilet from Gacy's house.

1845
02:49:08,382 --> 02:49:12,039
The car sold Gacy Ted Koslo,

1846
02:49:12,260 --> 02:49:13,907
who happen to belong to a boy who also

1847
02:49:14,322 --> 02:49:17,041
missing turned whose ring was found in Gacy's desk.

1848
02:49:17,754 --> 02:49:19,946
Together with all other souvenirs of his victims

1849
02:49:20,263 --> 02:49:21,951
what a creep he only too happy to flaunt it.

1850
02:49:22,574 --> 02:49:24,885
Koslo, who has admitted to have dug pits

1851
02:49:25,136 --> 02:49:27,077
in the crawl space under Gacy's house ...

1852
02:49:27,534 --> 02:49:29,166
says that, in turn, that it was intended

1853
02:49:29,450 --> 02:49:30,373
for downpipes in the house.

1854
02:49:30,718 --> 02:49:32,292
And then another missing boy, Miklovich.

1855
02:49:32,515 --> 02:49:34,451
Turns out he has worked for Gacy.

1856
02:49:34,825 --> 02:49:37,318
And now reports my surveillance team, which nota bene

1857
02:49:37,594 --> 02:49:41,356
his own lawyer us begging him not to let it get away.

1858
02:49:41,660 --> 02:49:45,857
So you say me please: What do we need?

1859
02:49:50,408 --> 02:49:53,981
Don will help you to get out of a command.

1860
02:49:57,065 --> 02:49:58,264
Thanks to u.

1861
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:02,015
I can do it themselves.

1862
02:50:18,692 --> 02:50:20,225
Maybe we should take a look.

1863
02:50:31,136 --> 02:50:32,171
He became fully krankjorem.

1864
02:50:32,445 --> 02:50:34,561
Threatened me nearly to death, now he wants to kill himself.

1865
02:50:34,773 --> 02:50:37,298
With this as a parting gift.

1866
02:50:37,559 --> 02:50:39,048
He had wanted to use it, honestly.

1867
02:50:39,307 --> 02:50:40,495
Pay attention.

1868
02:51:29,466 --> 02:51:30,879
Row'm chasing.

1869
02:52:30,722 --> 02:52:32,463
A fotorecuutje found in the house of the accused

1870
02:52:32,464 --> 02:52:35,503
during the search at 856 Summerhill Road.

1871
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:39,714
It is tight to. - It will be there.

1872
02:52:40,808 --> 02:52:42,603
Delta-team, Paxton hier.

1873
02:52:42,911 --> 02:52:44,817
Gacy's is on its way to O'Hare.

1874
02:52:47,245 --> 02:52:48,754
How close are you to the airport?

1875
02:52:50,441 --> 02:52:51,474
Five kilometers.

1876
02:52:51,726 --> 02:52:52,787
Drives like a madman brings this way

1877
02:52:52,788 --> 02:52:54,428
yet everyone before reaching the airport.

1878
02:52:54,786 --> 02:52:56,130
You think he flies away?

1879
02:52:56,505 --> 02:52:57,780
That he Koslo said.

1880
02:53:00,961 --> 02:53:02,162
Arrest him and bring 'm here.

1881
02:53:02,383 --> 02:53:03,837
We can not, not yet.

1882
02:53:04,164 --> 02:53:06,134
On what charge? - How should I know?

1883
02:53:06,353 --> 02:53:09,124
That's your thing now, but let him get away under any circumstances.

1884
02:53:11,071 --> 02:53:12,803
It's up to you now, sir.

1885
02:53:14,059 --> 02:53:16,302
But if you bring him here with a silly accusation ...

1886
02:53:16,536 --> 02:53:18,195
and if you find nothing in the crawl space ...

1887
02:53:18,414 --> 02:53:19,820
then he will not only be released ...

1888
02:53:20,177 --> 02:53:21,714
but then he has the freedom to pursue you

1889
02:53:21,918 --> 02:53:24,511
and Des Plaines luttelele the amount of $ 5,000,000.

1890
02:55:18,075 --> 02:55:19,532
Why do you stop me?

1891
02:55:19,791 --> 02:55:22,001
Please come out of the car, you're under arrest.

1892
02:55:26,961 --> 02:55:28,075
What is the charge?

1893
02:55:28,636 --> 02:55:33,139
For possession and publication of illegal material.

1894
02:55:44,169 --> 02:55:46,012
Hey, Joe. - Let's get started.

1895
02:56:03,348 --> 02:56:05,007
It stinks terribly well here.

1896
02:56:08,391 --> 02:56:10,255
Boy, what a stench.

1897
02:56:24,704 --> 02:56:26,515
Let's hope it goes well this time.

1898
02:56:27,969 --> 02:56:29,344
What we smoke or not the first time?

1899
02:56:30,081 --> 02:56:31,698
The water has been added.

1900
02:56:32,016 --> 02:56:33,940
It makes the earth beneath looser.

1901
02:56:34,205 --> 02:56:35,534
There will also call from.

1902
02:56:41,197 --> 02:56:44,681
This is what has been outlined that medium. - We'll see what we encounter.

1903
02:56:46,134 --> 02:56:48,831
It is a furnace here. It is going to be difficult.

1904
02:57:12,620 --> 02:57:16,886
That is still much to be half-Chicago in prison, huh?

1905
02:57:17,262 --> 02:57:21,724
Moreover Koslo is a liar, so that will be no free note.

1906
02:57:25,016 --> 02:57:28,356
Is Mr. pole, leugendector himself there now?

1907
02:57:29,391 --> 02:57:30,982
I have all the time you want.

1908
02:57:32,667 --> 02:57:34,672
There may also be other charges, Mr. Gacy.

1909
02:57:35,458 --> 02:57:36,672
Like what?

1910
02:57:37,327 --> 02:57:39,412
That depends on what the inspector will find in your house.

1911
02:57:40,141 --> 02:57:43,170
Oh, he is in my house. Ooh, well, well.

1912
02:57:43,672 --> 02:57:45,608
Wait till my lawyer hears from there.

1913
02:57:46,513 --> 02:57:49,139
I think he will really my pinch this time.

1914
02:57:50,735 --> 02:57:52,234
He has a warrant.

1915
02:57:52,753 --> 02:57:54,300
That will'm not much help.

1916
02:57:55,341 --> 02:57:56,978
He will not find anything there.

1917
02:58:51,433 --> 02:58:52,879
Detective?

1918
02:58:53,655 --> 02:58:55,620
Call the coroner but.

1919
02:58:56,538 --> 02:59:00,226
There are here two, maybe three bodies here.

1920
02:59:20,257 --> 02:59:22,260
The remains of 25 boys who were

1921
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:25,656
kidnapped, sexually tortured and murdered by John Gacy about

1922
02:59:25,657 --> 02:59:27,123
a period of six years ...

1923
02:59:27,418 --> 02:59:29,949
were found in the crawl space of his house.

1924
02:59:30,321 --> 02:59:31,810
The twenty-sixth victim was found

1925
02:59:32,073 --> 02:59:34,313
under the concrete floor of his garage.

1926
02:59:34,855 --> 02:59:38,201
Twentyseventh subfloor of the recreation room.

1927
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:47,854
Your boss called and asked me to come here.

1928
02:59:50,935 --> 02:59:52,525
You're totally broken.

1929
02:59:53,097 --> 02:59:54,884
Too sad for words.

1930
02:59:59,665 --> 03:00:02,718
You owe me a locker, you know?

1931
03:00:15,747 --> 03:00:17,253
The pain is gone.

1932
03:00:18,276 --> 03:00:20,222
Exactly what she had said.

1933
03:00:22,445 --> 03:00:24,606
You've done very well.

1934
03:00:50,970 --> 03:00:53,640
The body of Christopher Gant was not found.

1935
03:00:53,862 --> 03:00:56,329
However, blue jacket was also found in a

1936
03:00:56,562 --> 03:00:58,877
hidden room behind the oven.

1937
03:01:04,924 --> 03:01:07,986
Inspector Kozenczak continued his quest continues to Chris Gant.

1938
03:01:08,238 --> 03:01:12,581
He had the family promised to find the body.

1939
03:01:13,271 --> 03:01:17,757
Four months later, when the Des Plaines and Illinois rivers were melted ...

1940
03:01:18,017 --> 03:01:19,803
... It was found.

1941
03:01:25,553 --> 03:01:27,805
Ja, het is Chris Gant.

1942
03:01:28,803 --> 03:01:30,176
No, no ... I will do it.

1943
03:01:30,177 --> 03:01:31,677
I'll talk to the family.

1944
03:01:33,293 --> 03:01:36,178
John Gacy was convicted of the murder

1945
03:01:36,474 --> 03:01:39,857
on Christoper Gant and 32 other young boys.

1946
03:01:40,167 --> 03:01:42,240
Condemn to death, he awaits his death sentence

1947
03:01:42,447 --> 03:01:44,424
in de Illinois State Penitentiary.

1948
03:01:44,724 --> 03:01:47,918
The method that was used by Joe Kozenczak and his team,

1949
03:01:48,149 --> 03:01:50,306
which led to Gacy's arrest, was used as a guide

1950
03:01:50,513 --> 03:01:53,387
the FBI's Training Of State and the local police force,

1951
03:01:53,711 --> 03:01:57,357
for the detection and arrest of serial killers.

1952
03:01:57,825 --> 03:02:00,185
He is not easily died.

1953
03:02:01,397 --> 03:02:03,510
Christopher has suffered just before his death.

1954
03:02:06,673 --> 03:02:08,900
It is really what I've seen.

1955
03:02:29,926 --> 03:02:31,384
There are trees ...

1956
03:02:34,402 --> 03:02:36,061
Many trees ...

1957
03:02:37,096 --> 03:02:39,841
En water...

1958
03:02:41,676 --> 03:02:44,365
And a tower ...

1959
03:02:45,001 --> 03:02:49,301
And something that connects the tower ...

1960
03:02:50,928 --> 03:02:52,616
And a sign ...

1961
03:02:54,645 --> 03:02:58,220
And there is a huge mound of earth ...

1962
03:02:58,908 --> 03:03:04,941
There are machnies, trucks .... the only word that I can link to it's construction.

1963
03:03:08,721 --> 03:03:10,719
And a sign ...

1964
03:03:11,220 --> 03:03:13,178
Evergreen...

1965
03:03:18,906 --> 03:03:20,974
What do they call this place?

1966
03:03:37,786 --> 03:03:42,306
EVERGREEN CEMETERY
