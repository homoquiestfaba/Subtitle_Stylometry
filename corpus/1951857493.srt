1
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,396
Ugh. What is this?

2
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,500
- Cantaloupe, ma'am.
- It's ice cold.

3
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:06,535
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.
I'll get you another.

4
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,638
And what will you
do with this?

5
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,014
Hm? What will you
do with this one?

6
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,679
I--l-- I'm not sure, ma'am.

7
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,746
Throw it out, ma'am?

8
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,223
Did you pay for it?

9
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,352
- Just get out.
- Yes, Miss Duke.

10
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,364
- Don't come back.
- Ma'am?

11
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,992
You're fired.

12
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,043
- Now you're fired.
- Yes, ma'am.

13
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,985
Hello?

14
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,825
Uh, I have a 2:00 appointment.

15
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,798
The name is Lafferty.

16
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,962
Bernard. That's it there.

17
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,563
If they don't have figs,
well then just get apricot.

18
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,835
If they don't have apricots,
get whatever's in season.

19
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:44,968
If they don't have anything
in season, go wherever it is in season.

20
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,741
I'll take that sherry now,
thank you very much.

21
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,016
There's enough dried up
things in this house

22
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,746
without adding fruit
to the whole--

23
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,227
Get me my sherry.

24
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,261
Good evening, Miss Duke.
Ma'am?

25
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,373
Who the hell are you?

26
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,971
I'm here about the job,
from the agency.

27
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,413
Here, these are my references.

28
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,211
- Get me a sherry.
- Yes, ma'am.

29
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,191
Excuse me, ma'am,
there's something...

30
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,540
- New butler.
- Ma'am?

31
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,603
- You don't leave until I tell you to.
- Yes, ma'am.

32
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,833
Oh, you can go.

33
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,294
Ah, you. Come.

34
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,458
- Right there.
- Yes, Miss Duke.

35
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,459
- Just here?
- Yes.

36
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,594
- Will that be all, ma'am?
- Yes.

37
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,663
Wait, who the hell
are you, anyway?

38
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,107
Lafferty.

39
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,667
I assume you have credentials?

40
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,703
Here.

41
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,012
"Elizabeth Taylor,
Peggy Lee..."

42
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,649
What, you have a thing
for entertainers, Mr. Rafferty?

43
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:26,988
Lafferty.

44
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,221
Beg your pardon, Miss Duke,
it's Lafferty

45
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,819
with an "L."

46
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,425
It says that you haven't
worked for six months.

47
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,437
I had a-- a wee health problem.

48
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,031
Drugs or alcohol?

49
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,540
Um...

50
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,671
I assume it's under control?

51
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:50,113
I assure it's all in the past now.

52
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,878
Right.

53
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,385
Well, Mr. Rafferty, I really
don't care what you do

54
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,583
on your own time, just don't let me
catch you drinking my wine.

55
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,614
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks, Miss Duke.

56
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,864
I've seen this attitude before,
believe me.

57
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:54,209
"Oh, she'll never know that these olives
had fur growing on them.

58
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,579
Let's just clean them off
and put them in her martini."

59
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,413
Well, here's the news--

60
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,683
Iadies and gentlemen, from now on,
I am Miss Duke's eyes and ears.

61
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,419
I am the enforcer
of standards.

62
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,950
And if this household
has not met those standards

63
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,191
by the end of the week,
then I'll be making a few changes.

64
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,461
Do I make myself clear?

65
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,933
Ahem.

66
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,095
Right then, let's get
this place cleaned up.

67
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,128
Thank you.

68
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,577
Uh, Nancy?

69
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,173
- Not good.
- Yes, sir.

70
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,435
Come on, baby,
get back here.

71
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,440
Ben, where are you?
I'm missing you.

72
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,890
Good morning, sir.

73
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,962
- Rafferty?
- Good morning, Miss Duke.

74
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,471
Uh, the new gardener,
what's his name?

75
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,964
His name is Patrick, ma'am.

76
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,341
- Is he married?
- I don't believe so.

77
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,541
What's his sexual orientation?

78
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,311
I'm afraid I don't know.

79
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,215
Well, have him wash
his hands and come up.

80
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,743
You haven't forgotten the appointment
at 1 :00, have you, ma'am?

81
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,915
Pick something out
for me to wear.

82
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,892
Of course, ma'am.

83
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:23,417
That would be Patrick first,
then the outfit.

84
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:25,293
Yes.

85
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,463
$150,000 to the Duke
University Primate Center.

86
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,699
$300,000 to the Foundation

87
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,731
for Southeast Asian
Art and Culture.

88
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:11,106
Fine.

89
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,111
Right. Oh, incidentally...

90
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,579
Vice President Bush
wants to honor you

91
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,082
at his next fundraiser.
I think you should consider it.

92
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:20,984
Oh, that's sweet.
Just tell him my dance card is full.

93
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,318
- Thanks.
- I'll convey your regrets.

94
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,550
Tom, why don't you tell us
how her portfolio is doing?

95
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,559
I know how my portfolio
is doing, thank you.

96
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,061
I'm interested
in computer technology.

97
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,722
That seems hot, really hot.

98
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,700
So buy lntel, buy Microsoft,
maybe Apple?

99
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,725
I don't know, buy all three.

100
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,754
Come in.

101
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,728
Good morning, Miss Duke.

102
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:06,595
I have your breakfast. Would you
prefer it in the bedroom or...?

103
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,623
Oh, just put it right there.

104
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,601
Is madam going somewhere?

105
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,306
She most certainly is.

106
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,446
May I pack you a bag?

107
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:29,344
Yes, you may.

108
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,447
Right, ma'am.

109
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,726
Um, will it be the Vuitton?

110
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,752
Smaller.

111
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,459
How about this little one here?

112
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,230
That's fine.
And you could put in...

113
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,329
three bed jackets,
three nightgowns,

114
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,809
my gold slippers.
My smalls are right here.

115
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:55,212
And the Agatha Christie,
wherever that is.

116
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,509
Might it be in the bedroom?

117
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,450
I hope so.

118
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,387
Guess I'll go...

119
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,415
Here it is.

120
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,394
Oh, it's great, you have
the complete Miss Marple collection.

121
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,260
I love it.

122
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,565
A little help with this necklace.

123
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,935
It's a beautiful piece.

124
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,844
Yes, it is.

125
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,891
If I may be permitted, ma'am, I just...

126
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,417
Yes?

127
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,090
That was a lovely performance.

128
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,599
- What are you talking about?
- At the board meeting.

129
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,158
Oh.

130
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,567
Simply the flatness
of the landscape.

131
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,971
It-- it was extremely flat, yes.

132
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,341
Those men can't help it
if they live in a world of beige.

133
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,243
But you don't, do you?

134
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,908
- What's that, ma'am?
- Live in a world of beige.

135
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:06,144
Well, I live in
other people's worlds,

136
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,813
so if their world is beige,
then I suppose that--

137
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,220
- that my world is beige.
- Mm-hm.

138
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,746
Hm.

139
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,123
Why all of a sudden
the Deco coffee pot?

140
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,652
Well, l--

141
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,995
I prefer the Cristoff.

142
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,695
Well, it-- it won't
happen again, ma'am.

143
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,135
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure.

144
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,366
Send the Aubusson back
to Newport.

145
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,204
- It looks dreadful here.
- I will, ma'am.

146
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,335
Make sure they're
not drinking my booze.

147
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,780
And I want him gone
by the time I get back.

148
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,852
Right.
Have a safe trip, ma'am.

149
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,550
Good day, sir.

150
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,555
Mr. Lafferty?

151
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,530
Mr. Lafferty?

152
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,728
It's ours, we bought it.

153
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,560
- Yes.
- Oh sure, I know.

154
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,432
- Would you like some?
- No, thanks.

155
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,096
I'm good, thanks.

156
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,071
It's good.
It's from Argentina.

157
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,505
- Oh-- great.
- Yes.

158
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,237
- Very good.
- Miss Duke, she like to drink.

159
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,608
- Oh...
- All the time.

160
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,875
I'm sure she does.

161
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,905
Thanks.

162
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,200
- Is she okay?
- No.

163
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,713
Miss Duke?

164
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,376
Get me a damn drink,
will you, please?

165
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,352
Yes, ma'am.
Can I help you up?

166
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,446
Um...

167
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,821
God damn it.

168
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,155
Crooks, you know?

169
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:44,685
Said it was gonna be
three days, maybe four tops.

170
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,698
It's only
a lousy nip and tuck.

171
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,327
- I wouldn't do that.
- All of a sudden tonight she says

172
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,634
to me, "No, I think you should
stay another week."

173
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,469
- I think you should sit down.
- God.

174
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,407
Ma'am, I wouldn't do that.

175
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,606
"It's not as if money
is an issue," she says.

176
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,880
Mm!

177
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:08,909
Money has been an issue
my entire fucking life.

178
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,421
I think I should
take a look at that.

179
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,423
She's one of those
Nurse Ratched types, you know?

180
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,152
The Nazi in
the white sneakers.

181
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,183
You know what I did?

182
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,822
I just hit her, pow!
Right in the ear.

183
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,128
- Give me another drink.
- I think you should come upstairs.

184
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,690
No, just,
I want another drink.

185
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,201
Ma'am, I think you should rest.

186
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,828
Just give me
the goddamn bottle!

187
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,964
- For Christ's sakes.
- I think you should--

188
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,236
Will you get off of me?

189
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,339
That wasn't very nice, was it?

190
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,775
I'm sorry.

191
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:44,049
Rafferty, I'm sorry.

192
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,320
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay, it's okay.

193
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,418
I just, you know,
sometimes I just--

194
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,396
- I lose control, you know?
- It's okay, Miss Duke.

195
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,194
I know.

196
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,798
Rafferty?

197
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,569
Ma'am?

198
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,010
My face really hurts.

199
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,604
I can see that.

200
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,171
It really hurts.

201
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,342
- You should get some rest.
- I'm just gonna take...

202
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,942
No, I don't think you should--

203
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,509
Miss Duke, I don't think
you should--

204
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,283
Ma'am.

205
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,813
I don't think you should
be drinking with these, ma'am.

206
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,792
Whoops.

207
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,658
Would you please...?

208
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:25,492
Let's get you upstairs.

209
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,589
- I have an extra one. Do you want this?
- I'm good for now.

210
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,600
Oh God, I should call the clinic

211
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,363
and tell them that I'm still alive.

212
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,268
You mean you didn't tell them
that you were leaving?

213
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,738
Well, not in so many words.

214
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,934
I mean, I left rather abruptly.

215
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,443
- I think I should call them then.
- Mm.

216
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,673
Look, don't apologize
to anybody, understand?

217
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,045
Eva Braun,
she really deserves it.

218
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,710
And I'm not going back.

219
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:49,948
Yes, let's get you into
bed now and get some rest.

220
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,853
- Oh wait a minute, shoes.
- Okay.

221
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,983
There we go.

222
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,425
Allow me just to...
there you go.

223
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,434
- Just get the clothes out of the way.
- Oh God.

224
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,732
It's a tragedy.

225
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,738
I'm telling you, Rafferty,

226
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,605
I've spent millions,
literally, millions.

227
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,270
Look at these suitcases
under my eyes-- look at this.

228
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,801
Come here, look at this.

229
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,939
This is time
catching up with me.

230
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,076
I-- I can't see
anything there, ma'am.

231
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,986
Oh, your eyes--
are they blue or grey?

232
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,422
Uh, they're--
they're blue-grey, I think.

233
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,585
Oh, wow.

234
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:33,022
- Oh.
- You should go to sleep.

235
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,895
Go to sleep, ma'am.

236
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,163
- Oh.
- Are you gonna be warm enough there?

237
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,329
- Ma'am?
- Yeah, sit down right here.

238
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,397
Uh, I'll sit here and then
I can get you what you need.

239
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,931
No, come back here.
What are you doing?

240
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:48,503
Get your ass over here.
Sit down.

241
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,410
Oh.

242
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,746
Um, ma'am, l...

243
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,916
You should have some water here.

244
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,482
Okay.

245
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,858
Just take a wee sip there.

246
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,964
That's it.

247
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,694
That's water.

248
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,395
It is, ma'am.

249
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,960
Ah.

250
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,529
- Dehydrated otherwise.
- Mm.

251
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,474
There.

252
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,101
Okay.

253
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,571
Mm.

254
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,606
You should get into the bed.

255
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,417
Ma'am.

256
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,549
- Oh.
- There you are.

257
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,992
Are you warm enough there, Miss Duke?

258
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,825
Oh yeah, I'm... yeah.

259
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,290
Still a little confusing.

260
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,687
Who's that?

261
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,552
Let me-- let me just slip that out.

262
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,056
Mm.

263
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,589
See? We have a wee temperature
of just over 99.

264
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,264
Just take these now.

265
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,031
What is that?

266
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,265
Antibiotics.

267
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,604
What I need now
is the strongest

268
00:27:57,642 --> 00:27:59,872
pain pill known to man.

269
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,539
Okay, but take these first.

270
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,422
I remember leaving the clinic.

271
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,491
I-- l...

272
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,503
remember being in the car.

273
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,767
But you know,
it's like a jigsaw puzzle

274
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,740
put together in my head.

275
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:33,301
And l--
I remember taking a drink.

276
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,108
A drink or two,
plus a few painkillers.

277
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,614
Oh.

278
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,785
Lafferty, did we fuck last night?

279
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,379
No, ma'am.

280
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,983
I don't know if you fitted the nurse
piece into your jigsaw puzzle.

281
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:51,518
Oh, shit.
I'm gonna get sued again.

282
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,588
No no no, I called
the clinic this morning.

283
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:56,395
I explained that you had
a bad reaction to the medication.

284
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,925
I told them that you
regretted the incident.

285
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,269
And I hope you don't mind,
but I took the liberty

286
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:06,073
of sending the nurse some flowers
and a wee gift certificate.

287
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,373
For how much?

288
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,307
- $5,000.
- Jesus.

289
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:17,082
All concerned agreed that the matter
is now completely closed.

290
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,820
Bet she spends it all
on Nazi memorabilia.

291
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,832
That's good.
Well done.

292
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:30,357
Will that be all, Miss Duke?

293
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,198
Yeah.

294
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,070
Mmm. Oh, but, Lafferty,

295
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,835
your outfit...

296
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,275
- Yes, ma'am?
- Um...

297
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,746
well, you look like
a goddamn undertaker.

298
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,579
I mean, you think you
could lighten up a little bit?

299
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,311
Of course.

300
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,344
I'll do that.

301
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,205
Miss Duke?
Can I help you, ma'am?

302
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,007
Yes, you can start on that.

303
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,107
My babies have outgrown
their pots

304
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,118
and I'm going to
repot them all.

305
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:55,710
Right you are.

306
00:30:58,256 --> 00:30:59,814
- This one here, is it?
- This one.

307
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:02,850
Right here.
Take that out...

308
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,862
and then you'll cut it in half.

309
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,557
- Take it out?
- Mm-hm.

310
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,533
Here, let me help you.

311
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,972
There.

312
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:17,872
- Okay, now try.
- Okay.

313
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,774
You loosened--
loosened it up.

314
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,143
Mm-hm.

315
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,614
- There we go.
- That's it, that's it.

316
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,745
- And get your knife.
- All right.

317
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,380
And don't-- here,
put it in the alcohol first.

318
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,186
Just one infected bulb
and they'll all go.

319
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,318
- That's it.
- In half?

320
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,192
Mm-hm.

321
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,727
Tough little creatures, huh?

322
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,637
And then any of the bulbs that don't
have leaves, you're gonna get rid of.

323
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,231
All right.

324
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,608
Then you can fill it up and you can clip
off the excess dried roots.

325
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,704
You can see which ones
they are with this.

326
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,840
I-- I worked in a flower nursery

327
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,045
some time ago for a while.

328
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,643
And if I may say so,
Miss Duke,

329
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:04,814
you have one hell
of a collection of orchids.

330
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,221
Yes.

331
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,191
This is my newest baby.

332
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,319
All the way from Brazil.
It doesn't look like much now,

333
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,159
but wait until you
see it in bloom.

334
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,824
You know, my daddy...

335
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,891
he loved orchids.

336
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,199
And when he died,
they put a mountain of 'em

337
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,137
around his-- his casket.

338
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,606
Must have been $25,000 worth.

339
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,405
I still remember
the way that church smelled.

340
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,777
Gonna need you to go
to the bank for me tomorrow

341
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,679
- and get some cash.
- Yes, ma'am.

342
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,150
I'll call them in the morning.

343
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,710
What's your name?
I'll need to tell them.

344
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,120
- Lafferty.
- Your first name.

345
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,419
Bernard.

346
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,221
Mm.

347
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:47,896
I'm going away for a while and
I've decided to take you with me.

348
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,162
- Ma'am?
- Yes, you.

349
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,793
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,040
Now cut it--
use the knife.

351
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:59,168
Uh-- dup-up!
Dip it in the alcohol first.

352
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,202
We'll take it when
I get back, all right, sweetie?

353
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,942
You told me that
the last time you went away.

354
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,349
- Did I say that, really?
- You said that, really.

355
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:08,875
I'm so bad.

356
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,718
- You really are.
- Did you go to the bank?

357
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,554
Ah, and you counted it?

358
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,116
Here you go.

359
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,958
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

360
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,700
So you're getting ready
to leave town already?

361
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,168
I am.

362
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:27,103
So I was thinking...

363
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,833
maybe--

364
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:30,841
maybe I could
hang out here for a while...

365
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,638
- No no.
-...while you're gone.

366
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,373
- What do you mean, no?
- No. No way.

367
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,574
All these rooms
just sitting here empty?

368
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,446
The rooms will be fine.

369
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,850
I just hate to see this whole house
sitting here empty.

370
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,376
Oh, it's so sad.

371
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,616
No. Don't take it personally.

372
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,647
- I am taking it personally.
- Of course you are.

373
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,592
- Whatever.
- Oh, "whatever."

374
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,492
Oh, you're sulking now.

375
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,121
- Am I sulking?
- You're sulking.

376
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,495
- I'm not sulking.
- Yes you are.

377
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,466
Come on--
oh yes you are. Yes you are.

378
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,900
Come on, don't sulk.

379
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,425
I'm not sulking.

380
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,563
Don't be mad.
It's nothing.

381
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,575
- I'm not sulking.
- Yes you are.

382
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:07,442
Make sure that these boxes
are secured, please.

383
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:14,282
No, be careful with these.
Please lass, thank you.

384
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,520
How do you like living in
my world so far, Bernard?

385
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,391
I like it very much.

386
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,589
Who wouldn't?

387
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,427
Let me see your palm.

388
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,229
- You're right-handed.
- I am.

389
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,066
So this is what you're born with,
this is what you become.

390
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,470
You have a--
oh, an old soul

391
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:38,100
with a double heart line,
and all these little things coming off

392
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:40,235
- are unhealthy relationships.
- Is that right?

393
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,246
Am I right?
Is that an unhealthy relationship?

394
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,339
I don't know, is it?
I mean, I've had a few...

395
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,747
unhealthy relationships.

396
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,080
Uh-huh.

397
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,177
And this is
a very unusual line.

398
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,051
See, I have that also.
That's your fate line.

399
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,581
That means that very extraordinary
things will cross your path,

400
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,459
and you have to be alert
or they'll just pass you by.

401
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,259
Oh.

402
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,493
And...

403
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,558
yeah, well, what is
your star sign?

404
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,797
That's never been my scene.

405
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,567
Uh, Aries, is it?

406
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,130
When's your birthday?

407
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,402
14th of April.

408
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,909
14th of April, that's Aries.

409
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,607
So you are an instigator,
you start things.

410
00:35:16,647 --> 00:35:19,445
You're-- well, you hit a wall,

411
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:21,213
you get right
back up again

412
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,652
and then hit
the same wall again.

413
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,246
Uh, sounds familiar.

414
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,723
And-- really?
So that does sound familiar?

415
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,591
Uh, I like to do embroidery.

416
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:35,932
Uh, call Vincent and tell him

417
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:39,368
that I don't want him
to exercise the dogs

418
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,030
until we get there.

419
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,596
Have him check the surf report.

420
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,098
You haven't lived until
you've surfed the tube in the bay.

421
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,112
You brought swim trunks,
I assume?

422
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,807
No, ma'am,
I can't swim.

423
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,816
Well then, put that down--
"Swimming lessons for Lafferty."

424
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,977
Ma'am, I don't think that
will be necessary.

425
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,886
No just--
I'm serious, write it down.

426
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:01,119
- Sure.
- Put it on the list.

427
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,730
Memo to staff--

428
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:10,222
Miss Duke and I shall remain
in Hawaii for another three months.

429
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,793
I shall be supervising
the renovation of the swimming pool,

430
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,067
the tennis courts
and pergola.

431
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,438
In our absence,
see that all silver is polished

432
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,238
and carefully sorted.

433
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:22,713
Miss Duke's personal
tea service needs special attention.

434
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,477
Memo to staff--

435
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,918
we arrive at Falcon's Lair
on Tuesday

436
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,582
and we expect to leave
for Sri Lanka the following week.

437
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,148
Miss Duke and I shall be
traveling through the Far East

438
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,286
for the next six months.

439
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,480
Oh, be careful,
be careful, be careful.

440
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,210
Very gently get her
into the house.

441
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,785
Bernard?

442
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,289
Would you like to
join with us?

443
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,984
No, thanks.

444
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,153
Bernard's a little wary
of new experiences.

445
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,790
It took me months
to convince him to pierce his ear.

446
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,595
Shall we have some lunch?

447
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:06,383
Are you comfortable there, Swami?

448
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,408
Okay.

449
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,659
Doris was given tons of money

450
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,960
to restore all these
houses in Newport.

451
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,363
She did a great job.

452
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,834
Thanks.
What I love about Newport--

453
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,564
Wait, how many houses
do you have?

454
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,572
Doesn't matter.
But what I love is the weather.

455
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,871
It's got rain and snow and rain
lashing against the rocks.

456
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,638
- lncredible storms.
- It rains twice a year--

457
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:35,839
once for six months,
once for five months.

458
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,144
That's really good, Lafferty.

459
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,047
That is so funny.

460
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:43,178
Very good. Here, have a--
have a little hit.

461
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,687
- A little hit?
- Mm-hm.

462
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,122
- Should I do that?
- Absolutely, you should.

463
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:50,321
One big suck.

464
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:54,428
Getting high with the help.

465
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,195
How democratic.

466
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,037
Get enough there?

467
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,736
Thank you very much.

468
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,431
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

469
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,774
Uh, so,

470
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:14,642
what were you doing
in Calcutta anyway?

471
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,579
You know, I really-- I didn't
have the faintest idea

472
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:19,810
until I met Swami.

473
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,411
He was in a cave for 25 years.

474
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,854
He was praying.
Praying 25 years.

475
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,983
- Praying.
- It's not true.

476
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,654
Yes. No.
The poor, the sick,

477
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:34,220
the bereaved, the dying,
they would come to him.

478
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,495
He would lay his hands
on them and pray--

479
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,992
And then
one day the monsoon comes

480
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,062
and floods the cave.

481
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,041
So Swami gets up and he walks
all the way to Calcutta--

482
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,100
that's 2,000 miles or more--

483
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,339
because he wants to visit
the Festival of Durga--

484
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,510
Where we are amongst
the 200,000 pilgrims that are there.

485
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,451
And what happens?
Coincidentally,

486
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,852
Iiterally, we bump into Swami.

487
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,152
Literally bump into him.

488
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,852
- Congratulations.
- And the rest is,

489
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,917
well, destiny, I suppose.

490
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,953
We're gonna start
a center in New Jersey.

491
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,228
Well, he didn't walk
to New Jersey. He flew.

492
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,937
Took the easy way out,
hey, Swami?

493
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,101
You know, when I was sleeping
sometimes outside

494
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:22,203
and I watch all the sky's
beautiful stars,

495
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:25,613
then I thought I told Bernard

496
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,550
and Doris that, you see,

497
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,078
"You are sleeping
in the Five Star Hotel.

498
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:36,115
But I was sleeping
All Star Hotel."

499
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,690
It's a blessing.
A blessing.

500
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:44,030
To Swami and Doris.

501
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,060
And all the blessings
that come into our lives

502
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,265
when we least expect them.

503
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,706
Cheers to that.

504
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,175
Mm.

505
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,735
Swami, if I was drinking,
I'd be drinking to you.

506
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:58,214
Cheers, congrats.

507
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,012
Look at this. Look.

508
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,381
Are you all right, ma'am?

509
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,386
- Oh, we've got a problem.
- What is it?

510
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,910
Damn slugs, look at this.

511
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,219
- Look look.
- Oh.

512
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,226
If there's one
there's probably more, right?

513
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,057
Yeah, it looks like it, ma'am.

514
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,192
You're not gonna eat my babies.

515
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,565
Miss, you can-- apples.
My mother swore by apples.

516
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,864
Apples?

517
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,735
Yeah, we grew spinach
and potatoes in our yard.

518
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:24,366
We couldn't afford to lose them--
it was mostly all that we had to eat,

519
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,239
so my mother would put
down slices of apple

520
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,336
to attract the slugs and
the caterpillars elsewhere

521
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,347
and lead them away
from the vegetables.

522
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,372
- And that worked?
- It did, yeah.

523
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,284
If this works, I'm sending
your mother a check.

524
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,086
Well, that's very generous
of you, ma'am,

525
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:43,616
but she passed away
many years ago.

526
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,597
Lafferty, I know absolutely
nothing about you.

527
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,692
Maybe that's just as well, ma'am.

528
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,566
Do you think you should
be getting some rest?

529
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,697
- You have a long trip ahead of you.
- No, I'll be fine.

530
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,832
I can take care of this
while you're away.

531
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,002
No.

532
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:05,211
I had a-- a child
with my first marriage.

533
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,740
She only lived for 24 hours.

534
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,013
What do you think
the point of that is?

535
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,023
I'm terribly sorry
to hear that.

536
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,218
I mean, supposedly
everything happens for a reason.

537
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,956
You know, part of the Book of Life
or the Great Mandala.

538
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,361
You know?

539
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,365
What do you think
about that?

540
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:24,060
I...

541
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,070
I-- it's whatever
gets you through the night.

542
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,572
I mean, I'd hardly
be the one to judge it.

543
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:34,408
So the snail and the orchids
and you and l?

544
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:38,108
You smell divine, by the way.
Is that Norell?

545
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,309
- It is.
- I gave you that, didn't l?

546
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:42,148
You did. You gave it to me
and I wear it every day.

547
00:43:42,186 --> 00:43:43,881
I wouldn't be caught
dead without it.

548
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,355
Well, that's part of
the plan, you see?

549
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,017
What about the apple?

550
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:50,458
- Do you think this apple here has...
- Yeah.

551
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:52,189
...a part in the great--
the great plan?

552
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,663
Yeah. I mean,
events may seem random,

553
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,928
but there is a plan.

554
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,959
Unfortunately, it just may
not unfold quickly enough

555
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,269
for us to really understand why
it's happening. You know what I mean?

556
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,934
Sure.

557
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,214
I-- I knew this lrish lad

558
00:44:11,248 --> 00:44:12,738
in Philadelphia.

559
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,751
His name was Freezer.
That's how cool he was.

560
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:16,480
And he had everything
going for him--

561
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,080
he was handsome,
he was fun, he was warm-hearted.

562
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,025
We were up for the same
job at this chichi hotel,

563
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,618
the Bellevue in Stratford.

564
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,153
I knew he would get the job.
No one could resist

565
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,392
Freezer when he
turned on the charm.

566
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,095
Anyways, on the day
of the interviews

567
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,798
he steps off the curb
and he breaks his foot.

568
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,863
And I get the job.

569
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,841
And that's how I get to
meet Miss Taylor.

570
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,400
She introduces me
to Miss Lee.

571
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,810
- Then it's...
- lntroduces you...

572
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,780
-...to you.
-...to me.

573
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,544
'Cause you read it
on the resume.

574
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,949
Oh, so that's--
that was your path.

575
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,011
That was your journey, exactly.

576
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,353
- The Mandala, exactly.
- Mandala.

577
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,154
Oh Jesus, smell this.

578
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,459
Mm. Incredible, huh?

579
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:04,263
Very few of these guys actually
even have a scent. Isn't that tragic?

580
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,996
- Yeah, they're beautiful.
- So sad.

581
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,129
Miss Duke, do you think
I should be packing

582
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:11,073
the Persian outfits
that you mentioned

583
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,769
for your trip?

584
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,368
I don't know.
What do you think?

585
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:17,471
I don't know. I've never performed
in a belly-dancing troupe.

586
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:22,042
It's not belly dancing,
it's dance oriental.

587
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:23,576
Oh, that's Chinese, is it?

588
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:27,681
No, look, it's the Earth
and then the core

589
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,716
and then out.

590
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,820
See? It's as if your entire being

591
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,661
is concentrated,
every ounce of it right here.

592
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,030
- Right.
- You see?

593
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,864
- Sure.
- Right there, you understand?

594
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,871
It's like...

595
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,338
Like that.

596
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:46,103
- Yeah.
- Feel that?

597
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,974
- Go ahead, try it. Try it.
- No.

598
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,002
I think it's more of--
more of a girl thing.

599
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,039
No no, it's the most fun you could ever
have without actually touching yourself.

600
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,311
- Go ahead.
- No, I couldn't.

601
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:56,046
- Come on.
- No.

602
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,383
- See, like this?
- Yeah.

603
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,412
Some men actually find it
very seductive.

604
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:00,684
I'm sure they do.

605
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:04,182
I mean, l-- I swing
in the other direction,

606
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,492
if you catch my drift.

607
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,565
Cat--?
Yes, I catch it.

608
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,296
I caught it.

609
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,894
I have it.

610
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,632
All right, well it's just that l--

611
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,039
I think it--
it's mesmerizing.

612
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,306
How did I look just now?
I mean, tell me the truth.

613
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,210
I mean, did I look ridiculous?

614
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,010
- What do you mean?
- I mean, was it clumsy?

615
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,948
- Did I look clumsy? Did I look awful?
- No no.

616
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:29,953
I'll tell you what,
you looked happy.

617
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,215
Happy?

618
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,692
Yeah, just...

619
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:53,801
- Break a leg, Miss Duke.
- God forbid.

620
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:19,559
Miss Duke would like two men
on duty at any given time.

621
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,572
That's one inside the house
and one patrolling the grounds.

622
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:24,665
Also four dogs.

623
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,404
Nobody's to get in through
the front gate when she's away

624
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:29,810
except the gardeners
and the pool guy.

625
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,816
They have been issued
with passes like this.

626
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,250
And if you set off
the sprinkler system

627
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:38,345
with one of those,
you'll be destroying $30 million worth

628
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,948
of art and antiques.

629
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,084
Thanks, gentlemen.

630
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,920
Oh, l-- I thought
you'd gone home.

631
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,661
I've been having
a wee clear out of my room.

632
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,566
You know what it's like.

633
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,400
- I'll take that out for you.
- That's okay.

634
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:31,168
- It's no big deal.
- It's fine, thanks anyway.

635
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,971
Thanks.

636
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,873
Lafferty, change of plans.
I leave for London tomorrow.

637
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,008
Book the Connaught.
Make sure to tell Elton I'm coming.

638
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,349
Send over my Russian fox
and the new white sable pronto.

639
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,878
I rejoin the tour
in Washington on the 15th

640
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,891
and I'm running
to Hawaii after that.

641
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,052
So make sure
all the linens are changed.

642
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:53,654
Tell the painters I want them
out of there by March 10th,

643
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,165
or I'm invoking
the penalty clause.

644
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,498
In no way am I kidding.
Sincerely, Doris Duke.

645
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:02,198
Oh, PS-- have my new
jewelry appraised

646
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,298
and listed in the policy.
Sotheby's can do it.

647
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:07,037
I prefer that nice Kathy,
but if it has to be the other one,

648
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,908
so be it.

649
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,448
- Welcome back, Miss Duke.
- Oh, thank you.

650
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,477
I am so glad to be back.

651
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,162
Are you growing your hair?

652
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,639
A bit, I am. Yeah.

653
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:39,699
Come here.

654
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,045
Here.

655
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,105
- Look.
- What?

656
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,809
Look.

657
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,818
What do you think?

658
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,752
I think it looks a bit puny.

659
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:53,221
Well, you've got to give it time.

660
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:54,689
- I like it.
- You do?

661
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,317
Mm-hm.

662
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,352
I hope that your tour
went well?

663
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:02,854
Oh, the arts in America,
Lafferty, don't get me started.

664
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,527
You know, sometimes there
were more of us onstage

665
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,127
than there were in the audience.

666
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,694
I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am.

667
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,536
It wasn't a total disaster,

668
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,599
- I made a little friend.
- Oh, you did?

669
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,872
Mm-hm.
A kid in the company.

670
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,106
Oh, amazing dancer.
I thought he was gay.

671
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:20,241
And actually, so did he. But you know,
we have to leave ourselves open

672
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:22,911
to all the possibilities.

673
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,581
Indeed, it's true.

674
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,784
You know, you should
really wear more color

675
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,885
to kind of lift your face.

676
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:33,520
- Look at this, for instance.
- Oh.

677
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,292
Put this shirt--
now what does that shirt say?

678
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:36,856
- That shirt says...
- Too much.

679
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,390
-..."look at me."
- It certainly does.

680
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:41,199
You know, your shirt
doesn't say anything at all.

681
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,830
See what I mean?

682
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,001
Actually, Miss Duke, there is
one thing of yours that I love.

683
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,375
- It's that scarf there.
- Oh.

684
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,937
- I think that's the most beautiful...
- Well, yeah, let's see.

685
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:54,314
Uh-huh, that brings out
the blue in your baby blues.

686
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,943
- It does?
- Mm-hm.

687
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,749
What about my eyes?

688
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,278
- What about them?
- The shadow.

689
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,914
- You look great.
- Mm.

690
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,948
May-- um, maybe it's
a bit strong.

691
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,688
- Really?
- Just at the corner.

692
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,525
- May l?
- Yes.

693
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,054
Just smudge it out a bit.

694
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,260
There, like that.

695
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,235
- Mm.
- That looks great.

696
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,966
Maybe you should
wear a little eye shadow.

697
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,667
- No, I shouldn't.
- Just a touch.

698
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,437
- I don't think I should.
- You could try it.

699
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:25,137
What do you think of this?

700
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,740
I think it's gorgeous.

701
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,911
Okay, why don't you press it?

702
00:51:29,953 --> 00:51:32,820
Um, Miss Duke?

703
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,656
I wondered if I could have next
Thursday evening off?

704
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:39,924
Why?

705
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:42,830
Just personal reasons.

706
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:46,427
You know that Maltese cross
that I brought back from Paris?

707
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,097
Yeah, it's in the safe.

708
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,969
How do think that would go?

709
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:52,634
With this?
It would, yeah, absolutely would.

710
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,167
Well, when you say personal,
what do you mean?

711
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:58,272
I mean, do you have to go to a funeral
or have a procedure or...?

712
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,512
It's just,
I have a date, sort of.

713
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:03,576
Really?

714
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,645
Where did you meet?

715
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:07,953
- I haven't met him yet.
- It's a blind date?

716
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:09,754
Yeah, well, through the personals.

717
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,921
- "lrish Echo."
- "Village Voice."

718
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:16,421
How uncharacteristically
daring of you, Lafferty.

719
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,593
Are you a stone or a sponge?

720
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,364
- Oh, never mind.
- What, excuse me?

721
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,132
Well no, don't answer.
Never mind.

722
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:24,037
Permission granted.

723
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,167
Miss Duke, thanks very much.
I appreciate it.

724
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:28,473
I'll have this pressed at once.

725
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:32,343
Oh oh oh oh oh... scarf.

726
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:34,850
Oh, excuse me.

727
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,551
- Bravo.
- I so love that one.

728
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,528
- Oh my God.
- You sounded great, Miss Duke.

729
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,359
Peggy Lee couldn't
do it better herself.

730
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,524
She could and she did
and you know it.

731
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,557
'Cause Bernard used to
work for Miss Lee.

732
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,695
- Is that right?
- No, I just made the phone calls,

733
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,568
and I booked her rooms,
and I held the umbrellas,

734
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,403
and I opened the doors,
that sort of thing, you know.

735
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,999
- Want some more champagne?
- Please.

736
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:07,407
Thank you.

737
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,435
Now I heard that song
for the first time

738
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,208
in Las Vegas
at Caesar's Palace.

739
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,045
That's a real
crowd-pleaser, that song.

740
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,710
Mm, mm.

741
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,447
What was the one that
she did about the masochist?

742
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,250
- I don't know, what song is that?
- You know.

743
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:22,190
Where the guy is treating her horribly
and she's just loving it.

744
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,817
That sounds like
the story of my life.

745
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,350
- No, it's my life.
- No, it's my life.

746
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,124
- It is not your life.
- No, it is my life.

747
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,562
I think it's all of our lives.

748
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:31,565
Well, go ahead, sing it.

749
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,228
- Now?
- Now.

750
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,295
We only have now.

751
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,703
Uh, wait a minute...

752
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,911
That's it.

753
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:55,424
You have to imagine a wee black dress
on me with a million sequins.

754
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:04,289
What's the key?

755
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,713
Get the fuck out of here!

756
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,113
What's the big deal?
We both fuck other people.

757
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,085
Yeah, but you don't fuck
my staff in my house on my dime!

758
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,848
All right, I'm sorry.
I was high and I was drunk.

759
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:07,356
- Get the fuck out!
- Why are you acting so crazy?

760
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,948
- Let's just talk about this.
- Get out!

761
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:11,324
- It won't happen again.
- Get out!

762
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,522
Back-stabbing son of a bitch!

763
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,997
Bye.

764
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,402
Nothing makes me happier
than the scent of orchids.

765
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:34,281
Not even sex.

766
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,683
The one I'm really
gonna miss is Paloma.

767
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,415
Nobody could clean
like that woman.

768
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:45,321
You know the--
that picture where Marilyn

769
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:49,195
is crazy for guys
that play the saxophone?

770
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,258
Well, that's me with piano players.

771
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,702
Mechanics.

772
00:57:54,737 --> 00:57:57,501
- Really?
- Sweaty guy with his head

773
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,443
under the hood, intent on
his work with his hands all oily.

774
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,276
Mm.

775
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,715
How many mechanics
have you actually had?

776
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,741
None.

777
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:12,084
- Oh, Lafferty.
- I'm always afraid to make a move.

778
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,952
They might beat me
to death with a monkey wrench.

779
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,221
No, see, that would make them
much more appealing to me.

780
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,021
How was your date?

781
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:22,429
You don't have to pretend
to be interested, Miss Duke.

782
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,899
No, I really am interested.

783
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,834
Was he a mechanic?

784
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,168
No, he wasn't.
He was something in sales.

785
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:32,231
Pressed shirt
and nice clean hands.

786
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,970
Oh, I'm sorry.

787
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,377
Was he cute at least?

788
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,472
I wouldn't say cute exactly.

789
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,984
More-- more like promising.

790
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:43,815
What happened? Here.

791
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,117
Well, we talked

792
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,214
and we had a few drinks.

793
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,453
And I talked some more

794
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:53,621
and then, you know, "Here's me
in 10 easy-to-assemble pieces."

795
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,061
We have absolutely
nothing in common.

796
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,068
So you struck out.

797
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,902
I did, yeah. It was something
of a relief, I have to say.

798
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,668
Oh.

799
00:59:05,675 --> 00:59:08,007
On my honeymoon...

800
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,511
the first honeymoon--

801
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,984
- That would be with...
- The first guy.

802
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:19,011
- Rubirosa?
- No, the first one.

803
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,580
Oh God, that guy
had a body.

804
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,388
He's still one of
my dirtiest fantasies, actually.

805
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,624
I just couldn't wait
to get him in bed and...

806
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:30,565
Jimmy came toward me,
I was swooning.

807
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,227
He was naked,
stiff as a board,

808
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:35,431
and scooped me up
in his arms and he said,

809
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,065
"Doris, I've been wondering,

810
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,406
how much is
my annual allowance gonna be?"

811
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:43,207
- He didn't say that.
- He did say that.

812
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,180
Oh my God.

813
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,909
What did you say?

814
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,816
You know, I bet a lot
of guys find you hot.

815
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,583
- You have a great face.
- No, I don't.

816
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,284
No, really, it's so sensitive.

817
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:57,156
Oh, it's...

818
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,525
What?

819
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,292
Miss Duke...

820
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,100
What do you want from me?

821
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:14,575
From me.

822
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,704
- Miss Duke?
- What do you want?

823
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:18,771
I mean, you don't
fuck me, do you?

824
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,715
- No, I don't want anything.
- You don't steal from me.

825
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,945
- Do you steal from me?
- No, I don't want anything.

826
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:24,977
Well then, what do
you want from me?

827
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:28,419
I want to take care of you.

828
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,691
I just want to take care of you.

829
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:05,283
Come on, Lafferty.
Hit the gas, will you?

830
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,353
- Come on.
- I don't want to go too fast here.

831
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,194
It's-- it's a wee road here.

832
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,325
Oh for God's sake,
all right, pull over.

833
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,494
- Pull over, stop stop stop stop.
- What?

834
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:15,834
I'll show you.

835
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,340
- You all right there, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

836
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:32,585
- Got the seat belt?
- No no, just go.

837
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,090
Okay.

838
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,862
Just slow down a bit.

839
01:02:12,528 --> 01:02:14,792
Hi.

840
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:16,594
You hit 80 back there.
Are you aware of that?

841
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:18,099
Oh yeah, mm-hm.

842
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:21,661
And also, before you ask me,
I do not have my license on me.

843
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,798
Okay, I'm gonna have to
ask you to step out of the car, ma'am.

844
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,275
Oh, it's too cold, really. I can't.

845
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,975
Okay.

846
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:35,881
Who's your friend?

847
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,943
Oh, that's the Sultan of Brunei.

848
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,150
- Welcome to New Jersey.
- Thanks.

849
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:44,426
Okay, I'm gonna have
to breathalyze you.

850
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:48,658
I don't think so.
I don't really want to be breathalyzed.

851
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:51,098
- Sorry.
- Then, I'm gonna have to take you in.

852
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,864
No, I don't think so.
Just get on your little walkie-talkie

853
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:56,030
or your radio or something
and talk to your chief,

854
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,063
because he and I are
buddies from way back.

855
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,575
Then he'll be glad to see you
down at the station house.

856
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,872
- What?
- Okay, come on, let's go.

857
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:04,607
No. Whoa!

858
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,911
Uh, ma'am, I'm coming!

859
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,180
Wait a minute. Sultan?

860
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,379
Lucky thing,
you knowing the judge.

861
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:16,084
Oh, I know a lot of people.

862
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,590
He seemed
awfully happy to see you.

863
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,325
Ah, well, yes.

864
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,163
We had a little moment

865
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:27,362
in the coatroom
of the Phillips Club

866
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:29,462
about 20 years ago.

867
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:38,907
I don't find that funny.

868
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,382
You would if you'd been there.

869
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:59,627
Do you know how many
alcohol-abuse charities we support?

870
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,832
How do you think they'll feel
accepting money from a drunk?

871
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:08,342
Ironic.

872
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:11,210
You have a moral obligation
to set a good example.

873
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,816
Lighten up a little bit.

874
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:19,788
You know, Lafferty and l, we're just
trying to have a little bit of fun.

875
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:21,346
Right, Lafferty?

876
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:24,417
Yes, ma'am.

877
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,294
Just the coffee, please,
thank you.

878
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,367
Oh, all right.

879
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,232
Thank you, Lafferty.
That'll be all.

880
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:36,969
Ma'am.

881
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,176
In all the years
I've known you,

882
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,583
you've never paid
the slightest attention to your staff.

883
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,815
- But this guy...
- He puts up with my shit.

884
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:55,653
He's great with my orchids.
He embroiders, for God's sake.

885
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,524
- He's a bad influence, Doris.
- I like him.

886
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:01,727
Ahem.

887
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,493
Doris, I've seen you
figure people out

888
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:09,300
in 10 seconds flat.
You are a brilliant judge of character.

889
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,102
Why can't you see that
this guy is up to something?

890
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,683
How much does she pay you?

891
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,526
- Excuse me?
- Your salary.

892
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:37,555
What does she pay you?
Five grand a month?

893
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,932
I think you know my salary, sir.

894
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,563
You have access to the records.

895
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,597
I'm writing you a check

896
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:48,201
for $200,000.

897
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,514
- $200,000?
- Mm-hm.

898
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,073
That's right.

899
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,244
On condition you go away

900
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,277
and stay away.

901
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,388
I-- I don't understand.

902
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,758
Miss Duke hired you
to be her butler,

903
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,820
not her drinking buddy.

904
01:06:09,832 --> 01:06:12,562
Did-- did she ask you
to pay me off?

905
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,538
Okay, l-- Miss Duke would not
be very happy

906
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:20,508
if I walked out on her.

907
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,639
Loyalty is very important to her.

908
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,745
I agree, loyalty is
a valuable commodity.

909
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:33,786
Let's make it $500,000.

910
01:06:38,227 --> 01:06:40,957
Do-- do you think that's enough?

911
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:59,204
Give you
a little breathing space.

912
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:02,547
I am not that easy.

913
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:04,883
Good evening, sir.

914
01:07:09,458 --> 01:07:12,552
Dear Lafferty, I get to
my house in Newport on Tuesday,

915
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,586
so make sure
they fix the roof pronto.

916
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,997
I'm not having workmen
all over the place while I'm there.

917
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,895
I thought I'd be back Sunday

918
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,927
but I got invited
to Bali with George.

919
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:24,872
It is too good to pass up.

920
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:28,570
So I'll be stopping in Hong Kong
on the way to lndonesia,

921
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:30,408
May 10th through the 24th.

922
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:32,641
Book the Peninsula,
I want my usual suite.

923
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,047
Make sure I get my rate.

924
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,542
And I'll probably end up in Hawaii
in my house for the summer

925
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,748
but I'm staying in
my Beverly Hills house along the way.

926
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,657
And the screening room
is still a mess.

927
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:46,786
Go there and oversee
things yourself if you have to.

928
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:49,559
Use Frequent Flier miles
if possible.

929
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:56,772
All right, Lafferty,
I've decided to extend my trip

930
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,969
to see the migration
in Botswana.

931
01:08:00,009 --> 01:08:03,672
And please please please
make sure all my furs are in storage.

932
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,078
I don't want them moldering
away in the cedar closet

933
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,640
a moment longer.
Oh, while you're at it,

934
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:11,653
see if you can get the stains
out of the Balenciaga.

935
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:15,646
I don't know how they got there,
but it is unwearable at this point.

936
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,387
Sincerely, Doris Duke.

937
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,811
Welcome home, Miss Duke.

938
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,687
Thank you, Lafferty.
I am so glad to be back.

939
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:50,123
Oh my goodness, look at you.
Look at your hair.

940
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,525
- It's gotten so long.
- I can cut it if you'd like.

941
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,995
No, I like it.
It's so Jagger, isn't it?

942
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,497
- It is?
- Yes.

943
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,557
- Morocco was great?
- Great, yes.

944
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,398
Absolutely.
But exhausting.

945
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,199
I brought you back
a little something.

946
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:03,569
A little gift?

947
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:05,972
Are you chewing gum?

948
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,737
Oh.

949
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,266
Excuse me, ma'am,
I'll take it out.

950
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,677
I don't think
I've ever seen you chew gum.

951
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:15,878
Look, your present-- voila.

952
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,749
For you. Hm?

953
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:19,048
- What?
- Mm-hm.

954
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:20,214
- Here.
- That's for me?

955
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,814
That's for you.
Try it on.

956
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:23,222
- No no, it isn't.
- Yes.

957
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:24,886
- Come on, don't be silly.
- You're teasing me.

958
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:27,020
- Put your arm in.
- It's a caftan, is it?

959
01:09:27,062 --> 01:09:28,552
- Yes it is.
- Oh!

960
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:30,531
An antique caftan.

961
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,659
That's-- oh, it's a perfect fit.

962
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,864
Look at that. How brilliant am l?
That's gorgeous.

963
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:37,805
Perfect fit.

964
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,172
Oh thank you,
it's just beautiful.

965
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,938
Look, it's hand-embroidered,
isn't it?

966
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:43,501
It certainly is.

967
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:45,605
I can't believe it.

968
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,912
It's the most beautiful
present I've ever had.

969
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,815
- Uh-huh.
- It is.

970
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,217
- Gorgeous.
- Oh my God.

971
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,551
I feel like-- I feel like
Lawrence of Arabia.

972
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:56,558
Ha ha! You know what?
This is missing a button.

973
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:59,117
I just remembered.
Could you take care of that?

974
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,220
I will of course, Miss Duke.
Thank you so much.

975
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:02,821
- You're so welcome.
- Thank you.

976
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,765
I can't believe it.

977
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,665
Well.

978
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:08,795
I mean, how could this happen?

979
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,738
Look at this-- crown rot.

980
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,299
We might as well just pitch these.

981
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,470
And look at this.
It's got scale.

982
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:18,070
I mean, how did this happen?

983
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:20,240
- How did that happen?
- Well, I told the--

984
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,716
- I told the gardener--
- That's why I left you in charge.

985
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:26,084
Not the gardener. Now you're gonna have
to just wipe the whole thing down.

986
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,611
I can fix it.
I can fix it.

987
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:29,146
Okay, right here.
Here's the Pearla.

988
01:10:29,191 --> 01:10:32,058
- I know where it is, ma'am.
- Well then do it.

989
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,798
- Not enough bark.
- I know what to do, ma'am.

990
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,809
Well then, do it then.
Now that's too much bark.

991
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,811
Please, Miss Duke,
I can handle this.

992
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,746
All right, and it's 2* too hot in here.

993
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:55,249
So turn that down,
wipe down all the plants,

994
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,377
repot everything.

995
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,979
And don't forget
the fucking baskets.

996
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:03,322
Yes, ma'am.

997
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,943
Keep your breath going.

998
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:40,582
Okay, keep your
breath going.

999
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:44,689
What?

1000
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:47,161
- Miss Duke?
- Yes?

1001
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,427
Waldo Taft.

1002
01:12:50,466 --> 01:12:52,161
What about him?

1003
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,930
He's coming
to dinner tonight.

1004
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:56,870
- Oh yeah.
- What does he like to eat?

1005
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:00,238
Oh God, what about that...

1006
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:03,767
is that salmon
still in the freezer?

1007
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,178
Well, I'm not allowed
to throw anything out,

1008
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:07,910
so it's still there.

1009
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,909
Mm, then tell the chef
to poach that.

1010
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,080
Ah!

1011
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:16,091
That salmon's been here
longer than I have.

1012
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:19,526
It'll be fine.

1013
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:23,691
That salmon's leftover from
when Jesus fed the 5,000.

1014
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,324
That's how old it is.

1015
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,631
It'll be fine.

1016
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:34,575
Try to open up
your lower back a little bit.

1017
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,374
I'll tell the chef to poach it.

1018
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,719
This Marine Conservation Project
seems very interesting,

1019
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:49,622
but I don't see the annual
fiscal report anywhere.

1020
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:51,319
It's late.

1021
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,851
Well, no report, no money.

1022
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,333
- What's this now?
- The AlDS research.

1023
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:04,669
They've asked for
a 10% increase over the last year.

1024
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,230
It's not unreasonable.

1025
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,971
All right, done then.

1026
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:10,672
What else do we have here?

1027
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:13,476
Some salmon, Mr. Taft?

1028
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,817
It's, um...

1029
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,192
Bon appetit.

1030
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:31,693
The minister
from the Baptist church

1031
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,566
in, I think it's
Canton, North Carolina--

1032
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,265
Reverend Washington?
I love that man.

1033
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,705
What does--
what does he want?

1034
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,731
Well, apparently there was
a fire at his church.

1035
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:43,609
They've raised $1 million
but they need another $600,000.

1036
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,739
Give him whatever he wants
and I'll write a personal note.

1037
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:48,841
What else?

1038
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,119
What else do we have?

1039
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:57,091
You're not hungry, Mr. Taft?

1040
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,923
Um...

1041
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:01,122
no.

1042
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:03,461
How about a nice glass
of Peu Chimay?

1043
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,559
No, thank you.
I never drink when I'm driving.

1044
01:15:06,602 --> 01:15:10,732
Lafferty, why don't you
fix Mr. Taft some...

1045
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:12,831
coffee?

1046
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:15,605
All right. Sure.

1047
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,511
- Peu Chimay, ma'am?
- No, just some coffee.

1048
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:21,448
What's this now?

1049
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:24,281
- The literacy program.
- Oh yes, the literacy program.

1050
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:26,981
- How are they doing?
- Doing great work.

1051
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:31,584
You know, I'm confused
because I saw this State Senate report

1052
01:15:31,627 --> 01:15:34,562
that made it seem
as if there were some problems.

1053
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,162
Oh.

1054
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,167
You know,
when I first came to America

1055
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,862
I could hardly
write my own name.

1056
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:43,872
And then I took one
of those literacy programs,

1057
01:15:43,906 --> 01:15:46,067
and now look at me.

1058
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:27,611
Fuck.

1059
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:45,466
No one wanted to tell you.

1060
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,468
We know how fond
you are of him.

1061
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:51,495
Petrus '89, '90, '91-- all gone.

1062
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,939
Christ.

1063
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,102
Chateau Margaux '86,

1064
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:57,873
only the Premier Grand Cru.

1065
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:01,508
Well, he has excellent taste,
you got to hand him that.

1066
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,383
All the sherry--
maybe 100 bottles.

1067
01:17:04,419 --> 01:17:06,216
Jesus.

1068
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:08,552
You want me to
do something about this?

1069
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,127
Pack your bags.
You're fired.

1070
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:22,000
Dear Miss Duke,

1071
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:26,030
as always, I found it difficult
getting used to being in rehab.

1072
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,737
But I have managed
to stay dry for two weeks now

1073
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:33,145
and I think it's time
I came home.

1074
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:37,046
Dear Lafferty,

1075
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:39,110
I don't believe people
should be punished

1076
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,486
because they suffer
from an illness.

1077
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:45,983
That is why I haven't fired you,
as I probably should have.

1078
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:50,431
But I'm not yet ready to have you back
as a trusted member of my household.

1079
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:53,730
You will stay in rehab until
I am ready to forgive you.

1080
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:02,269
Doris.

1081
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:04,471
Doris, you okay?

1082
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,447
Doris, you okay?

1083
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:10,451
Doris?

1084
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,880
Doris?

1085
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:24,291
Dr. Armenza, please report
to lCU, STAT.

1086
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:28,462
Dr. Armenza,
please report to lCU, STAT.

1087
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:32,830
She's had a--
a sizeable stroke,

1088
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,774
but I think she will get over that.

1089
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,904
It will take time. She's gonna need
rehab and physical therapy.

1090
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,506
But I am concerned about
her underlying condition,

1091
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,141
which has always been
an issue,

1092
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:45,278
in terms of her heart disease.
She's got a degenerative heart problem,

1093
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,381
and also the liver issues.
Her liver function tests are not normal.

1094
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:52,222
She'll need round-the-clock
care for now.

1095
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:02,720
Here we go.

1096
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,723
That's it.

1097
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:39,262
What I did was unforgivable.

1098
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:46,701
I'm so ashamed of myself.

1099
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:49,438
You've taken me into your life,

1100
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:51,570
you've been extremely
generous towards me.

1101
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:54,104
I know I've let you down.

1102
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:57,346
I can only say I'm deeply sorry.

1103
01:20:59,087 --> 01:21:02,147
I hope you can forgive me.

1104
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,421
That's a good speech.
You learn it in rehab?

1105
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,429
I wonder if you could help--

1106
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,437
I'd very much like to keep my job.

1107
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:20,171
Please.

1108
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:50,026
Mr. Taft is calling
for Miss Duke, sir.

1109
01:21:51,139 --> 01:21:53,130
Okay.

1110
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,269
Excuse me, Nancy.

1111
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:01,714
- Mr. Taft.
- Lafferty.

1112
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:03,411
I'm at the front gate, let me in.

1113
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:06,147
I'm sorry, sir, Miss Duke's
not receiving visitors today, sir.

1114
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:07,711
I want to talk to her.
Put her on.

1115
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,121
She's not taking calls either, sir.

1116
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:10,590
- Put her on.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1117
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,354
I'm only following
Miss Duke's orders, sir.

1118
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,521
- I know what you're up to...
- Mr. Taft,

1119
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,087
Miss Duke appreciates your concern,
but her priority right now

1120
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,498
- is to avoid all stress.
- Put her on right now.

1121
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,230
And if you're truly her friend, you'll
respect her wish to be left alone.

1122
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,033
- Lafferty, for crying out loud.
- Yes, sir.

1123
01:22:24,072 --> 01:22:26,165
- Thank you, sir, goodbye.
- This is ridiculous...

1124
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,357
What are the police doing here?

1125
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:51,729
We're just trying to
establish the facts, Doris.

1126
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,893
I'm old, I have a bad heart,

1127
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:56,130
my lungs are for shit,
end of story.

1128
01:22:56,171 --> 01:22:59,368
Did Mr. Lafferty try to control
your behavior in any way?

1129
01:22:59,407 --> 01:23:01,102
Well yes, he certainly has.

1130
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:05,738
He's-- no visitors,
no phone calls, lights out at 9:00.

1131
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:10,649
If devotion beyond the call
of duty were a crime,

1132
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,449
he'd be a candidate
for Death Row.

1133
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:17,219
That's what you call it?
"Devotion beyond the call of duty?"

1134
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,818
Sorry to disappoint you, big guy.

1135
01:23:19,861 --> 01:23:22,125
Thank you, Miss Duke.

1136
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:31,629
I'm sorry, Doris.

1137
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:35,074
For all I knew, you might have been
locked in the attic like Baby Jane.

1138
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:38,477
That's Blanche.
Baby Jane had the keys.

1139
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,640
It worries me,
you being out here alone.

1140
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,413
Let me get you proper care--
round-the-clock nursing.

1141
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:51,850
- I'll think about it.
- They'll cluck around you

1142
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,053
- like mother hens.
- Stop it.

1143
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:55,062
They'll be patronizing you,
treating you like a child.

1144
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:56,154
Blah blah
blah blah blah.

1145
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:57,858
"It's time for
your bath now, Doris.

1146
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,890
- Have we taken our medicine today?"
- Oh stop it.

1147
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,868
- They'll drive you nuts.
- Just stop it.

1148
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,497
- I'm still being punished, is that it?
- It's not about you, Lafferty.

1149
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:06,734
I've tried to think of everything
I can to win back your trust.

1150
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,402
I've ceased to exist
outside this house,

1151
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,934
I've renounced my own life in order
to give you the care that you need.

1152
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,209
- And now you discover it's not enough?
- The nurses are coming

1153
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,409
- in the morning.
- It's the nurses or it's me.

1154
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,748
- Oh, don't make idle threats.
- It's not an idle threat, ma'am.

1155
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,845
Well then, stop it!

1156
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,882
For God's sake.

1157
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:25,893
Would you bring in the nurses
if it meant losing me?

1158
01:24:25,927 --> 01:24:28,191
- I won't be put on the spot.
- Answer me, please.

1159
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,857
It's a simple question, ma'am.
Just yes or no.

1160
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:36,001
I don't want you to go
if that's what you're asking.

1161
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,597
So you would do
without the nurses?

1162
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,972
I want you to stay.

1163
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,573
In my current capacity?

1164
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:47,274
Oh for God's sake, Lafferty.

1165
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:51,081
I choose you above all others.

1166
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,989
Mm.

1167
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:58,117
Is that what you want?

1168
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,890
And you are not to prevent
Mr. Taft from seeing me, ever.

1169
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,921
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

1170
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:10,162
We can still bring the nurses in
if you think it's necessary.

1171
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,833
Oh no. You wanted me,
now you got me.

1172
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,189
My daddy had pneumonia

1173
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:40,031
and my mother sent away
all the maids

1174
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:42,195
so she wouldn't have
any witnesses.

1175
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:44,228
And then she stripped him naked

1176
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:46,433
and opened up the windows,

1177
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:50,843
because that's the way they do it
in Macon, Georgia, she says.

1178
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:54,212
Of course,
this was New York.

1179
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:57,275
The coldest October in history.

1180
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,148
I was only allowed
to see him for a few minutes

1181
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:03,180
every day after school.

1182
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:08,053
You could see your breath
in the room.

1183
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:14,193
The man froze to death
in his own home.

1184
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:18,262
She thought that
she would get everything,

1185
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:21,002
but my daddy knew what
kind of woman she was

1186
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,875
and he left it all to me.

1187
01:26:33,421 --> 01:26:37,152
My father died
when I was three.

1188
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:47,993
My-- my mother died
when I was eight.

1189
01:26:48,036 --> 01:26:49,526
Oh.

1190
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:51,869
I was coming home
from school one day

1191
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:55,467
and there was an ambulance there
at the end of our road.

1192
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,344
A crowd was rubbernecking.

1193
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:02,110
She was sitting up against a car.

1194
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,210
It might have been the same one
that hit her, I don't know.

1195
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,914
I thought she was all right

1196
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:11,085
because there was no blood
or anything like that.

1197
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,685
It looked like she was just
having a snooze there

1198
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:15,696
in the middle of the road.

1199
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:19,564
Her shopping was scattered
all about...

1200
01:27:22,003 --> 01:27:25,666
porridge oats
and pink custard powder.

1201
01:27:28,042 --> 01:27:30,943
The only family I had
after that was an aunt

1202
01:27:30,979 --> 01:27:33,209
in Philadelphia.

1203
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:39,011
Fate.

1204
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:50,925
Here, let me give you
a hand with that, Miss Duke.

1205
01:27:50,965 --> 01:27:53,092
You just missed it...

1206
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,125
a bit here.

1207
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:00,636
There, take a look.

1208
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:08,043
I need more eyes.

1209
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,243
Sure.

1210
01:28:26,934 --> 01:28:29,903
That's okay.
Let's do the other side.

1211
01:28:29,937 --> 01:28:33,896
You know, when you do it,
you should start from the base

1212
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:36,876
to the tip. Try it on you.

1213
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:42,780
- From the base to the tip?
- Yeah.

1214
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:47,018
- Okay, like that?
- Mm.

1215
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:49,046
Yeah.

1216
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:10,676
Good evening, Nancy.

1217
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,159
- Will that be all, Miss Du--
- Oh stop it.

1218
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:32,189
Just sit down.

1219
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:52,778
Happy birthday, Miss Duke.

1220
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,833
I'm afraid this is not one of your more
glamorous birthday parties.

1221
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,101
Oh, I've had much worse.

1222
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,439
Perhaps you'll be up
to having a party again next year.

1223
01:30:17,712 --> 01:30:19,771
Lafferty, there are
a couple of things

1224
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:22,112
I want you to do for me
when I'm gone.

1225
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,674
Do we have to talk
about that now?

1226
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:26,118
- My bed socks, for instance.
- Bed socks?

1227
01:30:26,154 --> 01:30:29,055
Yes, I sometimes wear
bed socks when I sleep.

1228
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:31,115
I've done so since
I was a little girl,

1229
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:34,856
and if I should be
wearing my bed socks

1230
01:30:34,896 --> 01:30:36,955
when I fall off the twig,

1231
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,831
I would like you to please

1232
01:30:39,867 --> 01:30:42,392
remove them from my feet

1233
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:44,632
before the coroner gets there.

1234
01:30:44,672 --> 01:30:47,300
I don't want to look
like a complete idiot.

1235
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:48,808
Yes, sure.

1236
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:50,970
No fancy speeches.

1237
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:52,604
No press.

1238
01:30:52,647 --> 01:30:55,514
And I would like you to...

1239
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:58,348
dress me in something casual.

1240
01:30:58,386 --> 01:31:00,354
Life is a journey, after all,

1241
01:31:00,388 --> 01:31:03,255
and I refuse to go into that box
wearing an evening gown

1242
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:06,192
or something equally stupid.

1243
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:09,060
Yes, sure.

1244
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:12,190
Make it a natural fiber,
not man-made.

1245
01:31:12,233 --> 01:31:15,669
Silk might be a good idea.

1246
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:20,436
I want to demonstrate
my solidarity with nature.

1247
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:22,943
- Of course.
- I could come back as a tree

1248
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,708
or a bird or a bug, or...

1249
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:31,011
who knows?

1250
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,513
Will you do that for me, Lafferty?

1251
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:37,785
Yes.

1252
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:42,529
Promise?

1253
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:45,760
I promise.

1254
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:52,067
I must have lost my mind
to believe a fucker like you.

1255
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:13,152
Am I dead yet?

1256
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:17,561
Not yet.

1257
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:20,328
- Just keep her hydrated.
- Yes, Doctor.

1258
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,700
Sure you don't want me
to call a nurse?

1259
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:24,534
No, I don't think so.

1260
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:26,563
Call me if you need anything.

1261
01:33:58,566 --> 01:34:00,557
Here we go.

1262
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,601
That's it.

1263
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:21,121
I'm just going to adjust your pillow.

1264
01:34:21,155 --> 01:34:23,680
All right?

1265
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:40,303
That's it.

1266
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:43,333
That's it. Here we go.

1267
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,779
There you go.

1268
01:35:06,467 --> 01:35:08,332
Good night.

1269
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:10,098
Sleep tight.

1270
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:23,344
I, Doris Duke,

1271
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:26,353

01:35:43,871 --> 01:35:47,068
I direct there be no funeral service
or memorial service

1277
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:49,542
of any kind for me.

1278
01:35:52,379 --> 01:35:56,748
It is my wish that my ashes
be scattered over water.

1279
01:36:02,323 --> 01:36:05,292
I give and bequeath all of
my right title and interest

1280
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:07,692

1289
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:40,492

1307
01:37:29,810 --> 01:37:31,607
Your breakfast, Mr. Lafferty.

1308
01:37:31,645 --> 01:37:33,613
Thank you, Nancy.

1309
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:36,411
On the table, please.

1310

Good afternoon.

Let's get on with it,

01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,114
