1
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,394
<i>Hello!</i>

2
00:01:18,527 --> 00:01:20,930
<i>Chuck Farnsworth?
I'm Axel Bates.</i>

3
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:23,274
<i>You're also on with my partners,
Anders, Bradley and Zeke.</i>

4
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:26,402
<i>Oh, my God. Thank you
so much for calling me back!</i>

5
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,505
<i>I understand your daughter,
Brooke, was taken 24 hours ago</i>

6
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:32,008
<i>on a business trip with
your oil company in Mexico.</i>

7
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:33,409
<i>Yes!</i>

8
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:35,145
<i>I'll pay you guys
whatever you want.</i>

9
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:38,347
<i>You just bring my
baby girl home alive.</i>

10
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:45,955
I... I can't see anything.

11
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:49,458
Brooke, I'm Cal. We're
here to take you home.

12
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,728
Lean forward. I'm
gonna cut you loose.

13
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,931
It's okay. It's okay.

14
00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:57,701
Stand up.

15
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,804
Grab my vest. Don't let go.

16
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,555
Clear!

17
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,250
Zeke, get ready to go.

18
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,285
- Where's Axel and Bradley?
- They're right behind us.

19
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:35,597
I'm hit.

20
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,001
I got you, brother.

21
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,342
Get in the van!

22
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,979
Bradley, drive!

23
00:03:50,113 --> 00:03:51,346
Where's Zeke?

24
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:04,694
Axel, no!

25
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:20,576
Drive!

26
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,679
What's happening?

27
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:24,848
Where's Axel?

28
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:28,885
We gotta go back to
get him. We can't!

29
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,554
I'm sorry, brother.

30
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,763
Could have saved you the
trip. I'm still retired.

31
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,834
Well, so am I.

32
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,871
You just come all the
way up here to say hi?

33
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,843
A guy's not allowed to come check in on
his favorite cousin from time to time?

34
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:12,181
You up for a beer?
I got a couple.

35
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,083
Oh, yeah. Love one.

36
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:21,157
Pretty out here.

37
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,131
Quiet.

38
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,300
Just the way I
like it. Thank you.

39
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,576
Ever talk to Anders?

40
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,548
No. Last I heard, he was
beach hopping in Thailand.

41
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,751
That was last spring though.

42
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,155
Right. That's what
I'd heard too.

43
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:55,291
The number I had for
him, there's no answer.

44
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,929
I was trying to invite
him to my wedding.

45
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,768
Getting married?

46
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,072
I am, if you can believe that.

47
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:13,209
Uh, cheers to that.

48
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:14,644
Thank you.

49
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,648
Who's the unlucky
lady? Anyone I know?

50
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,051
You do.

51
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,654
Remember Brooke?

52
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,058
The Brooke from...

53
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:31,593
That's the one.

54
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:34,730
Fuck.

55
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:38,634
Uh, but, uh, congrats.

56
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:43,139
I guess losing Axel and
Zeke wasn't for nothing.

57
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:46,742
Yeah.

58
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,445
It was rough, but they knew
what they were getting into.

59
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,747
They knew the risks of the job.

60
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,916
Yeah.

61
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,152
We all did.

62
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,695
I want you to be my best man.

63
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,931
What do you say?

64
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:18,141
Yeah. I'll be there for you.

65
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,277
Thanks.

66
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:01,784
Oh, my God. There's
my baby.

67
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:03,386
Dad! There's my girl.

68
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,188
Look at you.

69
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:08,057
Dad. It's so good to see you.

70
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,825
So good.

71
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,062
You have time to call this
off, right?

72
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,731
The heart wants what
the heart wants.

73
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,334
Didn't your heart
want it four times?

74
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,804
Okay. Where's Cal?

75
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,106
He's parking the car and
bringing the bags in.

76
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,076
I see you still
have your entourage.

77
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,445
Yeah.

78
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,124
After what happened to you, you think
I'm gonna leave home without them?

79
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:33,684
You shouldn't either.

80
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:34,951
I have Cal.

81
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,019
And that's a long way from here.

82
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:39,055
Unfortunately, people
still know I've got money.

83
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:40,590
Yeah, 'cause you don't hide it.

84
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,827
Nothing but the best for my
baby girl, right? I mean...

85
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:47,763
I thought I was your baby
girl.

86
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,932
Oh, you almost
look as good as me.

87
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,103
This weekend's
about your sister.

88
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,372
Hi, Daddy. Hey, baby doll.

89
00:10:58,274 --> 00:11:01,344
Welcome, everyone. I hope you
all had a pleasant journey in.

90
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:03,980
Yes, we did. Thank
you. Oh, wonderful.

91
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,982
The rest of the hotel
guests are checking out,

92
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:09,986
which means you and your wedding party
will have the entire resort to yourselves

93
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,887
for the remainder
of the weekend.

94
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,290
Seriously, Dad?
Nothing but the best.

95
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:17,193
Is there any cell service here?

96
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:21,597
Uh, actually, you'll find that a few days
out here is like taking a walk back in time.

97
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:24,333
That's why presidents and
dignitaries from around the world

98
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:27,671
not only enjoy our seclusion
and accommodations,

99
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,438
but also come back
for repeat visits.

100
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:32,241
So there's no cell
service?

101
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:36,846
No. But we do have Wi-Fi and
plenty of beautiful mountain views.

102
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:41,350
Make no mistake, this is a weekend that
you and your guests will never forget.

103
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,286
If you'll follow me,
I'll give you a tour.

104
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,788
Go on over here. That's okay.

105
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,891
Now, as you can see, we're
surrounded by pristine wilderness.

106
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:51,294
We have a 36-hole golf course,

107
00:11:51,427 --> 00:11:54,163
15 miles of beautiful
hiking trails.

108
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:57,800
We also have a spa on the grounds.
Every treatment imaginable.

109
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,670
What
celebrities visited here?

110
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,506
Oh, I'm not able to disclose
exactly who...

111
00:12:09,211 --> 00:12:10,771
Guess I found the
right place.

112
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,116
Bradley, hey. Hey.

113
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:16,152
I'm so glad you're here.

114
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,287
Ah, wouldn't miss it.

115
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:21,957
Uh...

116
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,994
You could have almost gotten married
at my place in the mountains.

117
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,530
I don't have a lake like
that though.

118
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,266
Oh, this is gorgeous.

119
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,935
Hey, my dad's here.
You wanna come say hi?

120
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:36,606
Yeah. I suppose I should.

121
00:12:40,476 --> 00:12:42,411
Over here is our
five-star restaurant,

122
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:45,615
which will be hosting your
rehearsal dinner later this evening.

123
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,250
Yes!

124
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,920
This is where
your ceremony is gonna be.

125
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:53,489
Sorry. Chuck, good
to see you again.

126
00:12:53,623 --> 00:12:54,924
Bradley, good to see you.

127
00:12:55,057 --> 00:12:56,793
Especially on better
circumstances, you know?

128
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,194
Right. Give me just a minute.

129
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,496
Let me finish right
here, and I'll be back.

130
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,530
Thanks.

131
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:04,066
Oh, this is my sister.

132
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,136
Uh, Hailey, right?
And the maid of honor.

133
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,339
Bradley. The best man.

134
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,874
Nice to meet you.

135
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,342
You too.

136
00:13:13,476 --> 00:13:15,679
You've exceeded
all my expectations.

137
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:19,081
Wonderful. Well, I'll make sure our
staff has everything set up beautifully

138
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,751
for the big celebration
in the morning.

139
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,053
Now, if you'll all follow
me, we'll head to the casino.

140
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:32,128
It's great.

141
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,383
All right. We got slots, table games,
you know, fun for the whole family.

142
00:14:27,516 --> 00:14:30,052
And I know it looks busy
right now, but like I said,

143
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:32,054
this entire casino will
be completely empty

144
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:35,458
and only available to you and your guests
later today and throughout the weekend.

145
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:38,994
Somebody was telling me
this place had a safe room.

146
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,665
Oh, um, yeah, we do.
I'd like to see it.

147
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,734
Oh, no. It's really nothing
you would ever need.

148
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:46,636
Where is it?

149
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,606
Um, yes, sir. Yeah.
It's right this way.

150
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,793
You know, I'm out
there in the lobby,

151
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,061
and I'm listening to
this good-lookin' woman

152
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:14,898
talk about this big,
tall, handsome blond guy

153
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,367
she saw sittin' all
alone at the bar.

154
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:22,071
And as I listen to her describe
the guy, I think to myself,

155
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,306
"I bet I know him."

156
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,776
And I do.

157
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:29,111
You didn't take the tour?

158
00:15:29,245 --> 00:15:33,817
No. I'm... taking the
tour of bourbon country.

159
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,352
I see that. It's great
to see you, brother.

160
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,521
Good to see you too. Hey.

161
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,493
I wasn't sure you'd make it.

162
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:47,864
Hell, I wasn't even sure
I had the right number.

163
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:52,434
Yeah, look, I... I still check my
messages once in a while. It's...

164
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:55,504
In some countries, it's
harder than others, you know?

165
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:59,308
Retirement looks good on you.

166
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:03,013
It does. Sun, sand.

167
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:04,213
Right.

168
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,515
Women. Well, you know.

169
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,419
There you have it. Uh,
Thailand.

170
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:14,223
Ma'am, I'll do the same, please.

171
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,397
Thank you.

172
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:23,767
Thanks for coming.

173
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,268
I mean it.

174
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,774
Cheers.

175
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:40,349
Been kind of a long, hard
road, hasn't it, buddy?

176
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:42,652
Yeah.

177
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,888
Yeah, remember...

178
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,522
Remember that time
in Afghanistan

179
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:51,126
we got cut into that bottle
of confiscated grappa?

180
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,430
I thought my fuckin' teeth were
gonna fall out from that stuff.

181
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,666
Well, you became a man
that day. Bullshit!

182
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,136
I... I think I'd earned
my stripes well before that night.

183
00:17:02,872 --> 00:17:05,174
Stuck in the sand, drunk.

184
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,111
It was an impossible situation.

185
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,881
Next morning, we...

186
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:15,685
did what we had to do.

187
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:18,888
Yeah.

188
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,525
That, I wouldn't
mind forgettin'.

189
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,862
Yeah.

190
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:28,765
That's why I drink to pass out.

191
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,568
Helps me to forget, I guess.

192
00:17:33,603 --> 00:17:36,673
I guess Brooke's my vice now.

193
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:41,878
We kind of help each other get
through the hard times together.

194
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,212
Mmm.

195
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:46,850
Well, in that case, if
Brooke is your vice,

196
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,086
then this is my Brooke.

197
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:52,756
Cheers. Congrats.

198
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:56,191
Missed you. Missed you too.

199
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,366
All right,
follow me this way.

200
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,870
This is where we, uh,
make all the magic happen.

201
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,237
Don't mind the mess.

202
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,239
So our, uh, staff
cafeteria is back that way,

203
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,292
and the admin offices are
at the end of the hall.

204
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:15,145
Yeah. Well, you know, that's cool,
but I just wanna see the safe room.

205
00:18:15,277 --> 00:18:17,881
Ah, yes, well, it's actually,
um... kind of doubles as two rooms.

206
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,582
It's our high-tech security
room and it acts as a safe room,

207
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:23,485
which we have been fortunate
enough to never have had to use.

208
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,354
All right. Now, there
are two ways in.

209
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:28,725
One is typing in the code that only
our security team and myself know.

210
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,494
<i>The other is through the security
guard, who's always stationed inside.</i>

211
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:35,531
They monitor the entire
resort at all times.

212
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,634
Then open the door.

213
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,369
Yeah.

214
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:50,279
Right this way.

215
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,116
Now, our monitors are
back here in the cage.

216
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:56,119
Please don't touch anything.

217
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,021
All right. Come on in, guys.

218
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:00,794
So these cameras just capture
everything. It's all state-of-the-art.

219
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:02,892
If somebody drops a
quarter on the ground,

220
00:19:03,026 --> 00:19:05,729
we can zoom in and tell you
what year it was printed.

221
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:07,997
No.

222
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,600
What? Absolutely not.

223
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:20,442
Yeah, that guy was a real prick.
We all wanted to kill him.

224
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,912
Too bad he was a
colonel. Right.

225
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:24,748
No, lieutenant colonel.

226
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:25,982
Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:28,985
Yeah, he was from
Connecticut.

228
00:19:30,186 --> 00:19:32,354
There's my handsome man.

229
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,957
Hey. Well, wait, wait, wait.

230
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,592
That's what you're
marrying? This guy?

231
00:19:39,294 --> 00:19:40,830
Thanks for coming, Anders.

232
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:45,467
Yeah. I, uh,
know it means a lot to this guy.

233
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,270
That's great.

234
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:53,342
Yeah, it's great. All right.
Well, you guys, um, have fun.

235
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,649
I didn't interrupt
anything, did I? No, no.

236
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:03,253
Just, uh, takes a little
while to get to know him.

237
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:04,621
That's all.

238
00:20:05,354 --> 00:20:07,289
Let's go cruise around. Yes.

239
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:42,725
Oh.

240
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:45,527
How you feeling, baby?

241
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,997
Me? I'm pretty good.

242
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:51,433
I was honestly, I think, more
nervous couple of months ago.

243
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,102
Now I'm just excited.

244
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:56,272
I think that's 'cause
of how much I love you.

245
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,507
This is why I make
all the big decisions.

246
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:01,044
Damn right.

247
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,881
Okay, let's make a promise.

248
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,852
For our first anniversary, we
go someplace tropical, right?

249
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:11,587
Where you can actually
play golf outside.

250
00:21:13,455 --> 00:21:16,626
I just wonder if I might
have made a mistake.

251
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,928
Excuse me?

252
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:24,734
You think I should have
made Anders my best man?

253
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,103
Come on, honey.

254
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:31,774
We talked about this.
Get it out of your head.

255
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,611
This weekend is about us.

256
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:41,583
You're right.
You're right. Hmm?

257
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:43,753
But, hey,

258
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,089
if anything ever happens to me,

259
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:49,626
he'll be there to protect you.

260
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,062
I like you.

261
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,400
All right. Let's see it. Okay.

262
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:00,036
You've had a couple of lessons.

263
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,337
Okay, wait. Okay.

264
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,072
Ready? Step one.

265
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:07,710
And... batter up.

266
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,045
This?

267
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,652
Yeah, that's good for baseball, but
for golf, not so great.

268
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:16,551
Why...

269
00:22:16,686 --> 00:22:17,987
Feel like a club
pro here. Yep.

270
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:22,091
Okay, Miss Farnsworth,
soon-to-be Gray.

271
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:24,160
You just get in there.

272
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:25,728
Getting the grip.

273
00:22:25,862 --> 00:22:28,597
Put that left hand
down like that.

274
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:31,100
Cover it up with
your right hand.

275
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:36,005
Bring it back
slowly, and then...

276
00:22:37,173 --> 00:22:39,075
Uh, I'm sorry. I thought
this was a golf lesson.

277
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:43,046
Ma'am, I don't know what
came over me. I-I apologize.

278
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:45,682
Uh, here's what I'm gonna do.

279
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:50,320
I'm gonna give you the lesson for free
as long as you don't tell my boss.

280
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:53,656
Okay, let's see
a good swing now.

281
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,724
Concentrate. Okay.

282
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:07,770
My man. Good to see you.

283
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,039
Wonderful.

284
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,049
Yes?

285
00:23:20,183 --> 00:23:22,051
All right. Now,
look...

286
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:25,822
I'm gonna give you some advice,
not that you're asking for it.

287
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:30,159
Have fun. Have a great weekend,
but be careful, you know.

288
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:31,961
She'll break your heart.

289
00:23:32,095 --> 00:23:33,162
Got it.

290
00:23:33,296 --> 00:23:35,164
Mind if I play a bit?

291
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:36,598
Relax.

292
00:23:41,704 --> 00:23:42,772
All right.

293
00:23:46,142 --> 00:23:47,243
All right.

294
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,587
I always just thought
that was a pickup line,

295
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,723
when he said he
could play the piano.

296
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,126
Who knew? Not bad.

297
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,496
Oh, no!

298
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:08,597
You're pretty talented.

299
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:11,034
Oh, yeah? You think so?

300
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:13,136
I don't know.

301
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,042
Oh.

302
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:20,610
One more thing.

303
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,945
Need you to hold
on to this for me.

304
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,249
Guard it with your life.

305
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:30,620
All right? With your life.

306
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:32,121
I got it.

307
00:24:38,928 --> 00:24:42,899
That is a very big
responsibility.

308
00:24:43,966 --> 00:24:46,069
Fancy meeting you here.

309
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:53,242
So, what's your deal?

310
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,012
You and Cal.

311
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:58,314
Oh, uh, cousins.

312
00:24:58,448 --> 00:25:00,249
Our moms are sisters.

313
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:01,417
Huh.

314
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:04,887
You two don't have
a lot of family.

315
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:07,123
Are any of your
relatives joining?

316
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:09,092
No.

317
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:11,461
Probably better
that way. We're...

318
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:16,132
Well, our family is more likely to be
the help than the ones getting help.

319
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:19,068
Guess you could
say we're low-key.

320
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,105
I like low-key.

321
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,309
Do you, though?

322
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,946
Okay, burn.

323
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,049
Sorry. Cal told me that...

324
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:38,721
I should, uh, keep
my eye on you.

325
00:25:40,156 --> 00:25:41,624
In what way?

326
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,495
I don't know.

327
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:51,134
So I guess you won't
be joining me then.

328
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:53,936
Too bad.

329
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,911
Mmm.

330
00:26:15,725 --> 00:26:16,993
Shit.

331
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:30,139
Guess this will do.

332
00:26:59,402 --> 00:27:00,903
Want some?

333
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,011
Fuck it.

334
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:40,243
Oh, I haven't...

335
00:27:41,645 --> 00:27:43,479
done that since high school.

336
00:27:53,724 --> 00:27:54,957
Why'd you stop?

337
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,163
I just wanna let you
know that I was married.

338
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,100
Oh.

339
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:05,368
Okay.

340
00:28:06,535 --> 00:28:07,903
Was?

341
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:10,741
She died a couple years ago.

342
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:14,243
It's the only reason I took
the job your dad offered,

343
00:28:14,377 --> 00:28:18,080
'cause I didn't expect
to make it back.

344
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,251
I'm sorry to hear that.

345
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,388
But I'm glad you did.

346
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:28,991
My sister wouldn't be
here if you didn't.

347
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:36,499
We can go back.

348
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:19,275
What was that?

349
00:29:19,408 --> 00:29:20,543
Shit!

350
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:23,780
Has it started? Oh,
God, they're setting up.

351
00:29:23,913 --> 00:29:25,214
Fuck me! Shit!

352
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,950
Oh, fuck!

353
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,358
Hey, Juan. How's
it looking today?

354
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:39,763
Mighty quiet here.

355
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:42,015
I could use a lot more days
like this. That's for sure.

356
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,569
So, is that, uh...
Is that for me?

357
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:51,240
Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah, the, uh, father of the
bride brought in his own Colombian coffee,

358
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,809
so, I thought you'd like a cup.

359
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:54,343
Thanks.

360
00:29:57,313 --> 00:29:58,381
Ah.

361
00:29:58,514 --> 00:30:00,216
Wow. That's good.

362
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:02,518
Yeah, bud, real... real
Colombian beans, you know.

363
00:30:02,652 --> 00:30:05,121
Nothing but the best
for this wedding party.

364
00:30:12,328 --> 00:30:16,399
Well, it don't look like I'm the
only one here that could use a drink.

365
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,934
Mind if I join you?

366
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:20,469
Be my guest.

367
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:32,047
You know, it's a hell of
a place you picked here.

368
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,950
Yeah, it is.

369
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:48,063
You know, my daughter got married.
I didn't even get an invite.

370
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,233
Wow.

371
00:30:53,737 --> 00:30:54,905
Honestly...

372
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,876
if it weren't for you guys, I bet this
wedding wouldn't have happened either.

373
00:31:00,009 --> 00:31:02,011
And I appreciate that.

374
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:06,015
I mean, I really
do.

375
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:09,251
Cal is a great guy.

376
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:18,060
You know, he might be.

377
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:22,598
But that sure don't
make this day easier.

378
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,539
But that might.

379
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,743
My turn to pour.

380
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:40,983
Okay.

381
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:45,554
That's it, my friend. Cheers.

382
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:03,974
Yes.

383
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,709
Yeah, everything's on schedule.

384
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:07,777
See you soon.

385
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,348
Keep it together, Dad.

386
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,387
I got it.

387
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:23,787
Oh, boy.

388
00:33:47,744 --> 00:33:49,211
Just let it come.

389
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:51,915
Um, I'm gonna...

390
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:53,549
Thanks. I'll see you. Okay.

391
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,788
Okay. I got you. All right.

392
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:00,356
Hey.

393
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:10,867
He'll be okay.

394
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:19,274
Right here. Chair.

395
00:34:19,408 --> 00:34:21,510
Which one?

396
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:24,848
Hey, Dad. Dad.

397
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,316
Sit, sit, sit, sit. Calm down.

398
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:31,788
Go to your seat. What?

399
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,455
Go to your seat.

400
00:34:57,379 --> 00:35:00,083
She's gonna get
married, okay? Shh.

401
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:01,583
You made it.

402
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:40,690
Viktor, Marshall's
putting C-4 on the exits.

403
00:35:40,824 --> 00:35:42,424
Give him cover.
No one gets out.

404
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:44,861
Nobody uses that door.

405
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:51,567
Clear them out of here.

406
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:26,401
I see why you got those Michelin
stars. Compliments to the chef.

407
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:30,974
Look, I-I've done everything that
you asked, all right? Can I...

408
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,308
Fuck!

409
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:35,211
Jesus!

410
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:36,813
Stop.

411
00:36:36,946 --> 00:36:38,148
Stop.

412
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,716
Stop screaming.
Stop it. Sorry.

413
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,350
I know. I know.

414
00:36:41,483 --> 00:36:45,320
Just gotta... internalize it.

415
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:51,060
Besides, I did you a favor.

416
00:36:51,194 --> 00:36:53,797
You don't want anyone thinking
you're in on this, right?

417
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:00,036
Perhaps I should have waited until
you got us into the safe room.

418
00:37:02,272 --> 00:37:03,907
Some people annoy me.

419
00:37:10,113 --> 00:37:11,547
Shrimp cocktail?

420
00:37:17,086 --> 00:37:19,689
Wrap
it up. Let's go.

421
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,766
May I have the rings?

422
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:37,573
The ring.

423
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:44,013
The ring.
Yeah, uh...

424
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,616
Well, where are they?

425
00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:48,417
Uh, they're safe. I got 'em.

426
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,552
Are you kidding me? No.

427
00:37:54,257 --> 00:37:56,292
Just one sec.
Shit, shit, shit.

428
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:57,660
What?

429
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,771
They'll be right back.

430
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:22,852
How'd a squirrelish fucker like you
get in charge of a place like this?

431
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:26,723
Believe it or not, I'm... I'm
actually really good at my job.

432
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,526
I think there's a kitchen
staff that might beg to differ.

433
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:34,797
You... You said nothing
about killing the staff.

434
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,768
So I need to give you my plans?

435
00:38:39,601 --> 00:38:42,839
No, no. Here. Here
we are. Here we are.

436
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,217
The rest of the employees
will give you no problem.

437
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,185
They've all been
trained to do...

438
00:38:58,254 --> 00:39:00,574
What the hell are you doing?
He... He was knocked out cold!

439
00:39:00,657 --> 00:39:03,226
Now he'll stay that way. It's
one less thing to worry about.

440
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,028
Guys, clear him out.

441
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:10,432
You... You do realize that
as soon as you get the power,

442
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:13,502
the backup generator's just
gonna kick on in under a minute.

443
00:39:13,636 --> 00:39:15,537
Yes, Aaron, I do know that.

444
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,875
But it also shuts
down the Wi-Fi.

445
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:22,211
Which can only be restarted
by an employee. You.

446
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:23,578
No Wi-Fi.

447
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:25,447
No cell service.

448
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,849
No phone lines.

449
00:39:26,983 --> 00:39:28,685
They're shit out of luck.

450
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:31,788
This isn't my first rodeo.

451
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,823
Oh, my God!

452
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:34,991
Jesus.

453
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:40,697
Get into position.
Wait for Viktor.

454
00:39:45,534 --> 00:39:46,903
Oh, God!

455
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:48,470
Shut the fuck up!

456
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,375
We've all been shot before.

457
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,179
Fucking headache.

458
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:20,903
Oh, God.

459
00:40:39,455 --> 00:40:40,823
What the fuck?

460
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,796
Is that it?

461
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:50,733
Yeah, man, we're good. Let's
make our way to the security room.

462
00:41:17,927 --> 00:41:22,498
Okay, boss. All exits ready
to rock and roll. Fantastic.

463
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:26,836
Viktor. The boys are waiting for
you. Why don't you go join 'em?

464
00:41:26,969 --> 00:41:29,272
See if we can crash
that wedding, huh?

465
00:41:31,641 --> 00:41:33,009
Hey, Vik.

466
00:41:33,142 --> 00:41:36,145
Do me a favor and save that
first kiss for me, huh?

467
00:41:36,646 --> 00:41:37,647
Got it.

468
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,783
All right. What
have we got here?

469
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:43,719
That's the first floor. Yeah.

470
00:41:43,853 --> 00:41:46,155
Second floor.
There's the casino.

471
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:49,425
We're holding there, waiting
to go in. Viktor will join.

472
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,327
Well, all right then.

473
00:41:51,461 --> 00:41:54,297
Let's give 'em a surprise.
Let's rock and roll, baby!

474
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:12,048
Where the fuck did I leave
this thing?

475
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:20,957
The pool.

476
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:25,194
Of course. You coming?

477
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:29,031
Hey, hey!

478
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:33,636
Hey, we gotta go. Everybody's waiting.
Let's just chill for a second.

479
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:36,372
No reason to show up all sweaty.

480
00:42:36,506 --> 00:42:37,974
Nobody's going anywhere.

481
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,743
Okay. You're right.

482
00:42:41,744 --> 00:42:43,045
Everything's gonna be okay.

483
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:45,648
Look at you. You're a mess.

484
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:50,186
Sorry. I'm usually calmer
in these situations.

485
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,420
Don't worry.

486
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:55,091
CFO of my dad's company.
I'm used to chaos.

487
00:43:08,104 --> 00:43:12,108
Chuck sure did make this easy for us,
didn't he, renting out this whole place?

488
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,509
Yeah, he did.

489
00:43:21,884 --> 00:43:24,687
You wanna watch some of
this? When the fun begins.

490
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:27,356
No.

491
00:43:31,194 --> 00:43:32,795
Dad.

492
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:36,732
Hey, you might not feel good, but
you're still looking good in the suit.

493
00:44:02,792 --> 00:44:04,695
Everyone, stay calm.

494
00:44:04,827 --> 00:44:06,829
You run, and we'll shoot you.

495
00:44:12,703 --> 00:44:14,437
Get down! Get down.

496
00:44:25,414 --> 00:44:27,750
- Take her.
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

497
00:44:27,883 --> 00:44:29,785
Come on! Come on! Go, go!

498
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,471
Think your sister's
gonna be pissed?

499
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,239
No, she's gonna be fine.

500
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:58,347
Let's just take the
stairs. Come on.

501
00:44:58,481 --> 00:45:01,150
Uh-oh, uh-oh, oh, boss.
Check out this one. Okay.

502
00:45:01,284 --> 00:45:04,920
Oh, hey, kids. Anyone tell you
Fourth of July is coming early?

503
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:07,658
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

504
00:45:09,959 --> 00:45:11,260
What was that?

505
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:13,630
Sounded like a bomb.

506
00:45:13,764 --> 00:45:14,698
What?

507
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,969
Head back to your
room. Find cover.

508
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:21,937
What? Hell, no!

509
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:24,675
I'm safer with you! Wait!

510
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:28,344
Get your head down! Get
your head down! Stay down!

511
00:47:03,939 --> 00:47:05,975
Everybody, stop!

512
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,110
I'll take the guests
to the holding area.

513
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:10,980
Go see if they need
help finding the others.

514
00:47:11,113 --> 00:47:13,582
You got it, boss.
Let's go! This way.

515
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:10,172
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Come on.

516
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:13,442
I don't wanna leave you.
That way. You gotta go.

517
00:48:19,616 --> 00:48:21,217
This way. This way.

518
00:48:21,852 --> 00:48:23,085
Come on.

519
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:30,526
This way. Come on.

520
00:48:45,074 --> 00:48:47,209
There she is. Oh, yeah.

521
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:50,546
Let me zoom in on that.

522
00:48:51,113 --> 00:48:53,315
Hello.

523
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:55,685
Like catching fish without
bait. You stay here.

524
00:48:55,819 --> 00:48:58,788
I'll get us our lovely
bride. All right.

525
00:49:04,093 --> 00:49:07,096
This is exactly what happened
to my sister when she was taken.

526
00:49:07,229 --> 00:49:08,464
Are we gonna be okay?

527
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:13,569
All right.

528
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:21,805
Boss says start checking
the hotel rooms.

529
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:54,604
Stay here.

530
00:50:56,906 --> 00:50:59,341
Come on! Come on! Come on!

531
00:51:09,485 --> 00:51:12,154
You're lucky Axel
wants you alive.

532
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:20,690
I'm here to help.

533
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:24,694
Anyone there?

534
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:58,962
Hotel security.

535
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:14,010
I'm here to help.

536
00:55:25,574 --> 00:55:26,943
I'm so scared.

537
00:55:27,076 --> 00:55:28,996
What are we gonna do?
There's no "we," all right?

538
00:55:29,112 --> 00:55:32,148
You're gonna stay here, and
you're gonna find a place to hide.

539
00:55:32,282 --> 00:55:33,515
What?

540
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,685
Look, they have thousands
of security cameras.

541
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:37,921
They could be
watching us right now.

542
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:41,333
Then we're gonna find you an exit. You're
gonna head for the tree line and get help.

543
00:55:41,357 --> 00:55:43,525
I am not going out there alone.

544
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:47,263
You used to get paid
to protect people.

545
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:48,798
Protect me.

546
00:55:49,632 --> 00:55:51,100
Bradley, please.

547
00:55:52,101 --> 00:55:53,502
Please.

548
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,839
Fuck.

549
00:56:05,648 --> 00:56:07,216
Stay close. Okay.

550
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:49,192
What happened?

551
00:56:50,592 --> 00:56:52,362
I had him.

552
00:56:52,494 --> 00:56:54,697
Who? Cal.

553
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:57,834
He do this?

554
00:56:58,968 --> 00:57:00,336
Yes.

555
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,205
Bradley and Anders with him?

556
00:57:03,439 --> 00:57:04,374
No.

557
00:57:04,506 --> 00:57:07,944
Just him and these guys.

558
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:26,095
He's shit-faced.

559
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:33,002
Guess if my daughter was marrying
that man, I would be too.

560
00:57:35,505 --> 00:57:36,806
Chuck.

561
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:39,909
You're gonna need
some new bodyguards.

562
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:47,250
These noises are fucking
killing my headache.

563
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:49,685
Let's get him out of
here. Go somewhere else.

564
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:23,079
Got him.

565
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:26,182
I'll search the exterior,

566
00:59:26,315 --> 00:59:29,252
in case anyone made
it out of any windows.

567
00:59:29,385 --> 00:59:33,990
Good. Remember, Cal, Bradley
and Anders, alive if you can.

568
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:39,095
'Cause I'd like to have a
little conversation with 'em.

569
00:59:40,463 --> 00:59:41,697
Shut up.

570
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:45,801
Wake up!

571
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:34,951
Holy fuck!

572
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:44,760
Oh, there she is.

573
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:47,597
Welcome back, buttercup.

574
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,266
What the fuck do you even want?

575
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:54,605
Daddy? Hailey?

576
01:00:54,737 --> 01:00:56,673
Daddy, where are you?

577
01:00:56,806 --> 01:00:58,741
Don't say another fuckin' word!

578
01:01:03,512 --> 01:01:04,747
Let him go!

579
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:06,782
No, no. I don't think so.

580
01:01:07,383 --> 01:01:08,384
Hello, Bradley.

581
01:01:11,454 --> 01:01:12,623
No!

582
01:01:12,755 --> 01:01:14,490
- No!
- We gotta go.

583
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:17,360
I'm not leaving him. We gotta
go. We got no choice. Come on.

584
01:01:17,493 --> 01:01:19,862
When he dies, this
is on you, Bradley!

585
01:01:22,965 --> 01:01:24,400
That man is in
need of a killin'.

586
01:02:56,225 --> 01:02:57,259
Hey.

587
01:03:01,864 --> 01:03:02,965
You knew him!

588
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:04,443
This is all your
fault! No. Hey, hey.

589
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:06,803
Stop. Stop. Hey!
Stop. Quiet, quiet.

590
01:03:06,936 --> 01:03:09,338
Hailey, please, quiet, okay?

591
01:03:09,472 --> 01:03:11,907
They're gonna... Who was that?

592
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,144
It was Axel.

593
01:03:15,277 --> 01:03:18,381
I thought you said he was dead.

594
01:03:18,514 --> 01:03:20,349
I thought he was.

595
01:03:21,517 --> 01:03:24,153
If he kills my dad, it's on you.

596
01:03:25,689 --> 01:03:28,457
I just gotta... Hey. Get
the fuck off me! Get off me!

597
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:32,161
Can you keep it down.
They're gonna find us. Fuck.

598
01:03:40,837 --> 01:03:42,071
Hey.

599
01:04:04,628 --> 01:04:06,929
My-My-My dad has a phone.

600
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,966
He has a satellite phone.

601
01:04:12,034 --> 01:04:14,570
What do you mean,
he's... His room.

602
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:24,280
Come on.

603
01:04:28,517 --> 01:04:29,686
Hi, Chuck.

604
01:04:30,586 --> 01:04:31,987
You know who I am?

605
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:36,058
We've never had the pleasure
of meeting in person,

606
01:04:36,192 --> 01:04:38,427
but we have spoken on
the phone a few times.

607
01:04:42,164 --> 01:04:44,467
I talk to a lot
of fuckin' people.

608
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,573
Does the name Axel
Bates ring a bell?

609
01:04:56,913 --> 01:04:59,281
You're a dead man.

610
01:04:59,415 --> 01:05:00,449
Well,

611
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:04,353
death certainly would
have been merciful.

612
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:07,189
But instead, I was picked
up by those friendly folk

613
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:09,492
who kidnapped your daughter.

614
01:05:10,927 --> 01:05:12,561
Tortured me for a
couple of months.

615
01:05:12,696 --> 01:05:14,997
Unfortunately for them,

616
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,466
they just got a little
too comfortable with me.

617
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:20,069
So they're gone.

618
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:25,274
And here I am with a fresh,
new perspective on life.

619
01:05:27,476 --> 01:05:31,247
Let me tell you something,
you son of a bitch.

620
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,116
All I wanted was to
get my daughter back.

621
01:05:34,885 --> 01:05:36,285
What about Zeke?

622
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:38,287
He was someone's kid.

623
01:05:38,922 --> 01:05:40,556
And he has a daughter.

624
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:42,993
Zoey is five years
old right now.

625
01:05:43,158 --> 01:05:46,696
And guess what, Chuck? Her
daddy ain't ever comin' home.

626
01:05:48,665 --> 01:05:50,332
So let me ask you:

627
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:54,270
Is Brooke's life more
valuable than Zeke?

628
01:05:58,574 --> 01:06:00,175
No!

629
01:06:01,978 --> 01:06:02,913
Goddamn right.

630
01:06:03,045 --> 01:06:05,080
No!

631
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:09,518
No, you didn't...

632
01:06:09,653 --> 01:06:11,721
No. No!

633
01:06:34,878 --> 01:06:39,783
It's okay. Come on.

634
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,329
Put some pressure
on it.

635
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,368
That was the first
place I was shot.

636
01:07:01,871 --> 01:07:03,138
That's the second.

637
01:07:03,272 --> 01:07:05,775
And it left me with
a hell of a headache.

638
01:07:05,909 --> 01:07:09,211
You wanna see what it feels
like? No, no, no, no. No.

639
01:07:10,512 --> 01:07:12,414
I'll do whatever.

640
01:07:12,548 --> 01:07:13,582
Good.

641
01:07:15,284 --> 01:07:19,022
Because you offered us five million
dollars to bring your daughter home.

642
01:07:19,154 --> 01:07:20,624
I want my share.

643
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,926
Is that what you want?

644
01:07:23,059 --> 01:07:24,493
You want a million bucks?

645
01:07:24,628 --> 01:07:27,262
I'll make it happen. No.

646
01:07:28,197 --> 01:07:29,733
No, no.

647
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:33,569
What are both your daughters'
lives worth to you?

648
01:07:34,136 --> 01:07:36,538
Two times? Three?

649
01:07:39,075 --> 01:07:40,844
I don't have that kind of money.

650
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:42,012
Fine.

651
01:07:43,278 --> 01:07:45,682
No! Oh, no!

652
01:07:46,215 --> 01:07:48,484
Oh, shit.

653
01:07:48,618 --> 01:07:50,252
You want five million dollars?

654
01:07:50,386 --> 01:07:51,746
I'll give you five
million dollars.

655
01:07:51,788 --> 01:07:54,490
That's not enough for
what I went through.

656
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,826
7.5.

657
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,263
But I promise you,
that's all I can get out.

658
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:05,401
Okay.

659
01:08:05,534 --> 01:08:07,436
I can live with that.

660
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,775
I don't begrudge you
for what you did, Chuck.

661
01:08:11,908 --> 01:08:15,477
Any father with your means would
have done the exact same thing.

662
01:08:17,013 --> 01:08:20,684
But Cal, Bradley, Anders,

663
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:23,720
they made their choice.

664
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:26,221
And now it's time
for their reckoning.

665
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:30,860
Listen. Now, I don't care.

666
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:35,597
Just don't hurt my daughters.

667
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:40,970
You do what you say
you're gonna do,

668
01:08:41,104 --> 01:08:43,372
you have my word.

669
01:08:43,505 --> 01:08:46,976
You fuck with me, I'm gonna
kill everyone in here.

670
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:50,512
And then I'm gonna make you watch
while I kill your daughters.

671
01:08:50,647 --> 01:08:51,948
Got it?

672
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:53,482
Got it.

673
01:08:55,151 --> 01:08:56,218
I got it.

674
01:08:56,351 --> 01:08:57,429
<i>Hey, gang.</i>

675
01:08:57,453 --> 01:08:59,089
<i>Pay close attention now.</i>

676
01:08:59,221 --> 01:09:03,459
We have, uh, five wedding members
currently roaming the hallways.

677
01:09:03,592 --> 01:09:05,394
Ooh, get this. In the kitchen,

678
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:08,765
yeah, we have the lovely
bride-to-be, Brooke.

679
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:13,870
<i>I think that she is with a
blast from the past, Anders.</i>

680
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:16,039
Asshole.

681
01:09:16,172 --> 01:09:17,640
And that's not all, gang.

682
01:09:17,774 --> 01:09:22,444
And we have the bride's
sister, Hailey, maid of honor.

683
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:24,214
Yep. On the third-floor suite.

684
01:09:24,346 --> 01:09:27,117
And she's with the
best man, Bradley.

685
01:09:27,249 --> 01:09:30,920
But watch out, Bradley's got a
gun, and it does go bang, bang.

686
01:09:31,054 --> 01:09:32,321
All right.

687
01:09:32,454 --> 01:09:35,158
And then, gang, our
number one target, Cal,

688
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:38,128
<i>the unlucky groom.</i>

689
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,396
<i>Looks like he's heading to the
top-floor suites, I believe.</i>

690
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:44,667
<i>Happy hunting.</i>

691
01:09:44,801 --> 01:09:48,004
We have to go.
Wait, wait, wait.

692
01:09:48,138 --> 01:09:50,840
Someone will come. But
don't worry, I have a plan.

693
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:52,075
You need to surrender.

694
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,843
What? Yes.

695
01:09:53,977 --> 01:09:56,378
Put your hands up, stay
right here and surrender.

696
01:09:56,512 --> 01:09:58,480
Trust me. I'll
handle the rest.

697
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:00,717
Okay. I'm not leaving you.

698
01:10:10,526 --> 01:10:11,995
Get on your knees!

699
01:10:13,163 --> 01:10:14,864
Where's Anders? No.

700
01:10:20,502 --> 01:10:22,371
Let's go get me my money.

701
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:24,373
Come on.

702
01:10:25,608 --> 01:10:27,777
Okay. Okay.

703
01:10:39,222 --> 01:10:40,824
Over there. Yeah.

704
01:11:38,781 --> 01:11:40,683
What's this moron
doing? Jesus.

705
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:50,059
Hey, dipshit. Everyone's
supposed to go to the restaurant.

706
01:11:52,362 --> 01:11:55,098
Ah, but since you have the
lovely bride that-was-to-be,

707
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:58,467
what do you say we have a
little fun, huh?

708
01:11:59,802 --> 01:12:02,038
Fuck you.

709
01:12:23,893 --> 01:12:25,929
I never did like you, Anders.

710
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:29,464
Fuck you!

711
01:12:42,812 --> 01:12:45,181
It was him or us. Good choice.

712
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,551
Okay, give it to me.

713
01:12:51,955 --> 01:12:54,824
Good. Everything's okay.

714
01:13:10,707 --> 01:13:12,809
One, two...

715
01:13:13,676 --> 01:13:15,812
What are you doing?

716
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,750
One, two,
three, four, five.

717
01:13:20,883 --> 01:13:23,686
They're searching the rooms.
Five seconds in each room.

718
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,989
I'll be right back.
Find that phone.

719
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:37,000
They're holding the guests
hostage in the restaurant.

720
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,013
Where are you going?

721
01:13:51,214 --> 01:13:52,448
Do my job.

722
01:13:52,581 --> 01:13:53,816
Here. Take this.

723
01:13:54,384 --> 01:13:56,119
Now you know how to use it.

724
01:14:02,658 --> 01:14:04,761
Lock the door after I'm gone.

725
01:15:02,919 --> 01:15:06,022
Fuck.

726
01:15:08,724 --> 01:15:10,326
Bradley!

727
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,761
Help!

728
01:15:17,366 --> 01:15:19,335
Don't shoot me. Please,
please. Hey!

729
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,957
Help. Please. Please. Please.

730
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:51,901
Hello, hello. Police?

731
01:15:52,034 --> 01:15:53,514
<i>911.
What's your emergency?</i>

732
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:57,173
Oh! Please! The hotel has
been taken over by terrorists.

733
01:16:27,537 --> 01:16:28,971
Please hurry!

734
01:16:29,105 --> 01:16:32,775
<i>Ma'am, the closest police
force is 30 minutes away.</i>

735
01:16:32,909 --> 01:16:35,811
You need to hurry!
We'll be dead by then!

736
01:17:28,665 --> 01:17:30,066
No!

737
01:17:38,741 --> 01:17:40,276
Oh, God.

738
01:17:42,011 --> 01:17:43,746
Oh, God. Hailey.

739
01:19:10,533 --> 01:19:13,002
Hailey, it's over!

740
01:19:19,342 --> 01:19:22,713
There is no way out of
this. They're all dead.

741
01:19:22,845 --> 01:19:24,847
I have nothing to do with this!

742
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,283
Take it up with my boss.

743
01:19:28,017 --> 01:19:29,753
Come back for more?

744
01:19:29,885 --> 01:19:31,587
No weapons, huh?

745
01:19:31,722 --> 01:19:33,055
Don't need one.

746
01:19:49,438 --> 01:19:50,339
Fuck.

747
01:19:57,781 --> 01:19:59,649
No!

748
01:20:02,485 --> 01:20:03,519
Stop!

749
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:22,606
Bradley!

750
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:33,115
Cal! Help him!

751
01:20:54,671 --> 01:20:56,372
Help me!

752
01:20:58,474 --> 01:20:59,575
Grab him.

753
01:21:01,977 --> 01:21:03,345
Okay.

754
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:07,583
Got him? Yeah. Hang
in there, baby.

755
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,122
Stay here. You'll be
safe. Just stay here.

756
01:21:51,327 --> 01:21:53,562
All right. You're
safe. Stay here.

757
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:55,331
All right, good.

758
01:22:02,739 --> 01:22:04,306
Marshall, open up!

759
01:22:07,911 --> 01:22:10,145
Marshall!

760
01:22:11,213 --> 01:22:13,115
- I need the computer.
- Open up.

761
01:22:18,153 --> 01:22:20,657
I need the computer. Open up!

762
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,794
Okay.

763
01:22:35,538 --> 01:22:39,308
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Baby, I'm sorry.

764
01:22:39,441 --> 01:22:41,778
Okay, okay. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God.

765
01:22:41,912 --> 01:22:42,913
Daddy.

766
01:22:43,045 --> 01:22:45,147
Oh, my God!

767
01:22:45,281 --> 01:22:46,716
I'm okay.

768
01:22:48,284 --> 01:22:50,052
You don't tell
them. You hear me?

769
01:22:53,088 --> 01:22:54,557
What the fuck?

770
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:57,293
I'm so sorry.

771
01:22:59,663 --> 01:23:00,596
Open the door.

772
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:02,666
Open the door!

773
01:23:05,869 --> 01:23:08,738
Open the fucking door! Fuck!

774
01:23:10,674 --> 01:23:12,008
No, no, no, no, no!

775
01:23:12,141 --> 01:23:13,475
Don't open this door!

776
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:15,250
I'll give you a count
of three. One, two...

777
01:23:15,377 --> 01:23:16,947
Don't you open this
door.

778
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:19,415
Daddy! Oh, my ear!

779
01:23:19,548 --> 01:23:21,818
Open the fucking door!
Oh, shit!

780
01:23:26,823 --> 01:23:29,693
You okay? I'm okay.
Okay. I'm okay.

781
01:23:29,826 --> 01:23:31,995
Oh, God. I'm okay.
Shh, shh, okay, Dad.

782
01:23:32,161 --> 01:23:34,296
Got into your account.
Need the password.

783
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,098
I can barely hear!

784
01:23:36,231 --> 01:23:39,069
Hey. Shithead. Password now. All lowercase!

785
01:23:39,201 --> 01:23:40,837
All lowercase words.

786
01:23:42,672 --> 01:23:43,873
"brooke55...

787
01:23:46,076 --> 01:23:47,476
hailey819."

788
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:50,714
- Oh, baby. Oh, my God.
- It's okay. Come on.

789
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:57,053
- Goddamn, Chuck.
- Okay, okay.

790
01:23:57,186 --> 01:23:59,288
You might be able to
do 7.5? Okay.

791
01:23:59,421 --> 01:24:00,690
Fuckin' liar.

792
01:24:00,824 --> 01:24:01,992
It's okay.

793
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:04,060
That's it. Pleasure
doing business with you.

794
01:24:04,193 --> 01:24:07,596
Come on, sweetheart. Time to
go find your hubby. No! No! No!

795
01:24:07,731 --> 01:24:08,865
No, you're not.

796
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:15,705
Oh, my God! Oh,
my God!

797
01:24:18,407 --> 01:24:20,275
Help! It's okay.

798
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:23,479
Okay. Okay.

799
01:24:24,948 --> 01:24:26,582
Help me!

800
01:24:35,725 --> 01:24:36,926
This way.

801
01:24:41,031 --> 01:24:42,164
Help!

802
01:24:42,297 --> 01:24:44,199
Hailey!

803
01:24:45,534 --> 01:24:48,337
Open
the door! Hailey!

804
01:24:49,304 --> 01:24:51,440
Open the
door!

805
01:24:52,776 --> 01:24:55,612
Daddy, open
the door!

806
01:25:01,017 --> 01:25:02,184
Oh, my God. Daddy.

807
01:25:02,317 --> 01:25:05,187
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

808
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,157
I'm okay. Keep the
pressure on that.

809
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:09,125
Okay. Okay.
Where's Brooke?

810
01:25:09,258 --> 01:25:10,426
Axel took...

811
01:25:10,559 --> 01:25:12,796
Axel took her. My God!

812
01:25:12,929 --> 01:25:14,731
Axel took her.

813
01:25:14,864 --> 01:25:17,701
Oh, my God! I know. Daddy's okay.
Daddy, it's okay. It's okay.

814
01:25:18,668 --> 01:25:21,437
Right. Stay here. Stay
here. There was nothing...

815
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:24,641
Keep pressure on the wound.
There was nothing I could do!

816
01:25:24,774 --> 01:25:26,743
Daddy! Daddy!

817
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:30,714
Okay, come on. Come on.
Okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

818
01:25:33,049 --> 01:25:34,651
Cal!

819
01:25:34,784 --> 01:25:36,944
I said, shut your
fucking mouth.

820
01:26:19,696 --> 01:26:20,630
Jesus.

821
01:26:20,764 --> 01:26:23,800
One shot. I'll
follow your lead.

822
01:26:24,566 --> 01:26:26,803
It's Axel. I know.

823
01:26:32,942 --> 01:26:36,545
Axel Bates, you fuckin' rat.

824
01:26:36,679 --> 01:26:38,347
You're a dead man.

825
01:26:38,480 --> 01:26:42,384
No, I've already
been dead. Your turn.

826
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:46,222
Well, lookee here.

827
01:26:46,355 --> 01:26:48,224
We got the band back together.

828
01:26:48,357 --> 01:26:53,295
Hey, Axel. Take it easy. All right?
You don't have to do this. Okay?

829
01:26:53,428 --> 01:26:54,931
You're a fuckin' asshole.

830
01:26:55,064 --> 01:26:57,867
And you, Bradley, of all the
people, you left me to die.

831
01:26:58,001 --> 01:26:59,002
Hey, hey!

832
01:26:59,135 --> 01:27:01,271
It was my decision to
leave you behind. Okay?

833
01:27:01,403 --> 01:27:03,873
I thought you were
dead. All right?

834
01:27:04,007 --> 01:27:06,508
Just let 'em go. Okay?

835
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:08,845
You can kill me.
Just let 'em go.

836
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:12,048
Okay. Drop the fucking gun!

837
01:27:12,182 --> 01:27:14,349
No! No fuckin' way.

838
01:27:14,483 --> 01:27:16,485
Anders, drop the gun.

839
01:27:16,619 --> 01:27:18,554
Drop it, or
she's dead. Now!

840
01:27:18,688 --> 01:27:20,990
Hey, drop it, Anders.

841
01:27:22,192 --> 01:27:24,093
Hey. Remember the colonel.

842
01:27:24,227 --> 01:27:27,764
Yeah. Whatever the fuck
that is, remember it.

843
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:32,869
All right. You got me.

844
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:39,309
There you go.

845
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:41,110
Why don't you go join 'em?

846
01:27:43,313 --> 01:27:47,416
You, princess, I made a
promise to keep you alive.

847
01:27:49,752 --> 01:27:52,055
Guess I'll keep it.
Run along, little one.

848
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:55,225
Ha.

849
01:27:57,961 --> 01:27:59,128
Baby.

850
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,942
It's us.

851
01:28:17,313 --> 01:28:19,949
Bradley! Are you okay?

852
01:28:20,083 --> 01:28:22,118
Hey. I'll be fine.

853
01:28:36,465 --> 01:28:37,700
Hey.

854
01:28:41,137 --> 01:28:42,571
With my life.

855
01:28:44,007 --> 01:28:47,210
Where's that damn
manager?

856
01:28:47,343 --> 01:28:51,114
I'll get you a minister. Just
don't invite me to the wedding.

857
01:28:57,153 --> 01:28:58,187
Okay.

858
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,995
