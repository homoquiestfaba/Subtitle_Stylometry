1
00:00:23,668 --> 00:00:26,585
(car door opening)

2
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:32,078
(traffic passing)

3
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,996
(car door closing)

4
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:48,830
- [Woman] I just think they
would want us to get married

5
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,320
in a temple or something,

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,963
not a Christian church.

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,470
- Who does that nowadays?

8
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,420
We're not in Tibet.

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,320
Besides, our focus should
be on finding you a husband.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,540
Double wedding.

11
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,373
Remember?

12
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,480
This is your bedroom,

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,640
and the bathroom's down the hall.

14
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,473
- Thanks.

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,910
- Why do you have to get
married at the same time?

16
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,220
- My mom's wish.

17
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,490
On her deathbed her exact words were,

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,800
the two of you have to get married

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,740
at the same time, a double wedding.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,700
- Wow.

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,100
I guess I just don't really get that,

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,978
like why would you wish
that on your children?

23
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:38,895
- [Woman] I don't know.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,770
- Is it a Buddhist thing?

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,813
- [Woman] I don't think so.

26
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,700
- So, why don't you have a boyfriend?

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,290
- I guess I just haven't
found the right one yet.

28
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,450
- By the way, this George
is a very nice guy.

29
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,610
He has his own business.

30
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,370
He travels all the time.

31
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,930
No need to look any further.

32
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,763
He's the one.

33
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,670
- How do you know he's the one?

34
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,040
- [Man] Like I said,

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,110
he has his own business, he's a nice guy,

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,543
and he travels all the time.

37
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,643
- [Woman Guest] What does any of that

38
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,040
have to do with anything?

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,020
- I'm only trying to help.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,120
You told me you don't have anyone special.

41
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,313
Would you slow down the drinking,
and use a napkin please?

42
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,960
- Yeah, I'm here.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,870
Did the Welch group confirm?

44
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,060
- [Man On Phone] Yeah,
it looks you got him.

45
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,200
He'll get a hold of you when you get back.

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,033
- Great.

47
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,626
- [Man On Phone] I missed you.

48
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,413
Do you want to know how much I missed you?

49
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,350
- Tell me how much you missed me.

50
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,810
- [Man On Phone] I'd like to
stick my fingers inside you.

51
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,103
- No fingers this time.

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,363
Let's try something else.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,260
Let's say, I'm not wearing any clothes.

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,970
- [Man On Phone] Are
you standing or sitting?

55
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,803
- I'm standing.

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,093
I'm sitting.

57
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,173
- [Man On Phone] On a chair?

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,100
- On an office desk.

59
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:23,991
(dramatic orchestral music)

60
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,125
- [Man On Phone] I'm
massaging your breasts

61
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,625
until you get wet.

62
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:29,404
- Okay, what else?

63
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:34,657
- Then, I'm pushing inside
as I'm on top of you.

64
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,054
- How does it feel?

65
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:41,733
- It's warm, and moist.

66
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,220
- Okay, what else?

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,373
- [Man On Phone] Now I'm in, all the way.

68
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:53,302
(man sighing)

69
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,964
(both sexual breathing)

70
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:09,089
(door creaking)

71
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:10,093
- [Man] What are you doing?

72
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,193
- Don't you knock?

73
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,150
What do you want?

74
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,983
- I forgot to tell you,

75
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,900
George called and moved
the date to tomorrow night.

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,670
- I just got here.

77
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,830
- The sooner the better.

78
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,663
Right?

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,523
- Yeah, right.

80
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,610
- Joan was 18 in this photo.

81
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,510
- You married an 18-year-old?

82
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,733
- No, that was a photo of
her when I first met her.

83
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,463
This was taken right before she died.

84
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,780
Cancer, you know.

85
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,613
- I'm sorry.

86
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,420
She was very beautiful,

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,883
in both photos.

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,593
- She was.

89
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,730
- Thanks for tonight.

90
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,573
- Thank you.

91
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:36,433
I had a nice time.

92
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,103
(crickets chirping)

93
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:59,603
(dog barking)

94
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:13,303
(game on TV)

95
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:14,230
- Here you are.

96
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,063
- Thanks.

97
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:20,310
(bar patrons talking)

98
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,030
Yeah, I think so.

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,760
Every 25-year-old has a girlfriend
or boyfriend at this age.

100
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,720
- My cousin's a pilot,

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,673
and he's got a really cool 1990 King Air.

102
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,253
- Hey.

103
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,690
- Your Daniel's?

104
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,050
- Sister.

105
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,053
- Sister?

106
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:53,920
- What, we don't look alike?

107
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,870
- No.

108
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,150
(laughing)

109
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,900
- We're stepbrother and stepsister.

110
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,510
- Came out for a casual drink, huh?

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,630
- I just went on a
blind date with someone.

112
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,223
What about you?

113
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:16,273
What are you doing here?

114
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,617
- Well the truth is, my
husband kept calling me

115
00:07:19,617 --> 00:07:21,793
and it was driving me crazy.

116
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,233
Actually my ex-husband.

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,643
So was it bad?

118
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,843
- What?

119
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:32,803
- Your blind date?

120
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,823
- Not like so bad, but I don't know.

121
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,493
He showed me photos of his late wife.

122
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:45,260
- Oh. (chuckling)

123
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,483
- All these blind dates, I'm exhausted.

124
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,293
Not a single one has worked out.

125
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:53,666
I feel like a piece of meat on the market.

126
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,433
- Well,

127
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,283
finding the right one takes time.

128
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,630
- I just want to settle down.

129
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,010
- Well you can't just settle with anybody,

130
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,133
you have to settle with the right person.

131
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,773
- Right.

132
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,650
- Cheers.

133
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,483
- Cheers.

134
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:21,940
(jazz piano music)

135
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,853
- Wanna play pool?

136
00:08:43,744 --> 00:08:44,744
- You do it.

137
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,868
- You assume the stripes.

138
00:09:01,868 --> 00:09:04,785
(light jazz music)

139
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:09,061
(bar patrons talking)

140
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,913
- [Brother] Hey.

141
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,880
- Old injury from soccer?

142
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,730
- [Brother] Yeah.

143
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,160
- You should take some pain killers.

144
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,540
- It's okay, it'll go away.

145
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,570
Sit with me.

146
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,753
So,

147
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,263
is George nice?

148
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:20,673
- He is nice.

149
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,563
- Is he the one?

150
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,453
- I'm not sure.

151
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,720
- I want you to pay attention to me now.

152
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,553
All right?

153
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,200
Sometimes the right one
is right in front of you,

154
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,083
to look any further would
only make yourself confused.

155
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,413
- Wow.
- What?

156
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:47,233
- Why are you talking to me like that?

157
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,433
- Like what?

158
00:10:48,433 --> 00:10:50,480
- Like, I'm an old maid,

159
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,343
or spinster, or something.

160
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,303
- Well,

161
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,120
that's where you're heading.

162
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,560
- We're done here, goodnight.

163
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:10,684
- Night.

164
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,057
(doorbell ringing)

165
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,507
(soft piano music)

166
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,370
- So, what do you want to change?

167
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,653
- I just want everything at an angle.

168
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,060
Let's start with the table.

169
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,157
(soft piano music)

170
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:53,760
Let's do the couch.

171
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,790
- [Sister] How do you want to move it?

172
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,693
- Just not against the window.

173
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,610
Just pile them.

174
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:15,013
(grunting)

175
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:15,940
- Maybe we should push it.

176
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,773
- [Blonde] Yes.

177
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:17,763
- Okay.
- Let's push it.

178
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,540
- Move this out a little bit.

179
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:38,845
(louder piano music)

180
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:39,678
This back.

181
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,383
Yeah, this chair.

182
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,110
Just like.

183
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,860
Yeah.

184
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,693
It looks good.

185
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,633
Thank you.

186
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:31,466
- Mm-hmm.

187
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,093
You have a record player?

188
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,850
- [Blonde] Yeah, do you
listen to records much?

189
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,683
- Never.

190
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,843
Is this you?

191
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:51,030
- [Blonde] Mm-hmm.

192
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,993
- How old were you?

193
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,230
- [Blonde] Like, 13.

194
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,053
It was with my foster
parents in South Africa.

195
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,493
- Oh, thanks.

196
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,943
- You want to try something stronger?

197
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,270
- What do you mean?

198
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,163
- I mean,

199
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,230
you want to smoke a little weed?

200
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,133
- Sure.

201
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,450
- You ever smoke pot before?

202
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,263
- No.

203
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:06,786
(coughing)

204
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:08,869
- [Blonde] You all right?

205
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,363
- So strong.

206
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,883
- It's not that bad.

207
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:31,003
- So I was standing at a bus
stop, with some other girls.

208
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,240
We're like waiting for the school bus,

209
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,663
this was back in Illinois.

210
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,660
And there's this car driving by,

211
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,223
like a shabby-looking Ford.

212
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,173
And suddenly it parks
right in front of us.

213
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,223
And this boy gets out,
he's like 18 years old.

214
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,270
He comes toward me,

215
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,220
and he looks at me,

216
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,583
in like a funny sort of way.

217
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,010
And then he pulls me close to him,

218
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,860
and he sticks his tongue in my mouth,

219
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,963
and I just panicked.

220
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,020
And he laughed, and then got
in his car and drove away.

221
00:16:19,534 --> 00:16:20,610
(laughing)

222
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,213
- [Sister] People really do that?

223
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,373
- Apparently.

224
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,070
When was your first kiss?

225
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,470
- I can't remember.

226
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,900
- You can't remember your first kiss?

227
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,733
- No.

228
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,263
- Why not?

229
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,645
- I don't know.

230
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:48,138
What's wrong with that?

231
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,081
- [Blonde] Don't tell me.

232
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:53,660
- What?

233
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,040
- You never kissed anyone before.

234
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,163
- That's not true.

235
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
I'm just saving it for the right person.

236
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,853
- You're saving your kiss?

237
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,810
- [Sister] Yeah, what's wrong with that?

238
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:47,736
(dog barking on TV)

239
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,463
(door opening)

240
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,380
- Dong Hua.

241
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,793
- Hey.

242
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,330
- George called.

243
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,180
He wants to get again tomorrow night.

244
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,600
- Okay.

245
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,453
- You already have plans or something?

246
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:07,531
- No.

247
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,828
(yelling on TV)

248
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,346
(lawn mower running)

249
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,978
(doorbell ringing)

250
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:37,178
(light jazz music)

251
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,507
(giggling)

252
00:19:41,241 --> 00:19:44,158
(light jazz music)

253
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,670
- [Blonde] Had you been thinking about it?

254
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,623
- [Dong Voiceover] Might
have, more recently.

255
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,373
- [Blonde] Was it what
you expected, at all?

256
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,947
- [Dong Voiceover] It was different.

257
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:45,303
- [Blonde] Different how?

258
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,333
- [Dong] Like, what was that?

259
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,277
- So, you were surprised?

260
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,834
(birds singing)

261
00:22:36,526 --> 00:22:40,193
(dramatic electronic music)

262
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,470
- It's good.

263
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,570
- You're really enjoying the food tonight.

264
00:23:06,774 --> 00:23:07,607
- I like food.

265
00:23:08,476 --> 00:23:11,393
(George chuckling)

266
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,310
Describe someone you want to spend

267
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,660
the rest of your life with.

268
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:26,860
- Someone I can talk to, and
just have a good time with.

269
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,593
- Hmm.

270
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,300
(dramatic electronic music)

271
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:41,939
(muffled conversation)

272
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:45,850
- This is your famous Mount Rushmore?

273
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,613
- Yes.

274
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,890
- Dearest Margaret.
- Don't read it out loud.

275
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,083
- Oh, sorry.

276
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,883
Who's Margaret?

277
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,840
- Me.

278
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,100
- You?

279
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,377
- It's my birth name, I changed it.

280
00:26:03,377 --> 00:26:04,853
- When'd you change it?

281
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,330
- When Luke and I got married.

282
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,690
- You can do that?

283
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,653
- Of course.

284
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,220
- Call me Margaret.

285
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,793
- Margaret.

286
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,380
- I like the sound of that.

287
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,150
I think I should make it my name.

288
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,050
What do you think?

289
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,783
- Sure.

290
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,340
This is the postcard you sent
me back when we were dating.

291
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,140
I was in Illinois.

292
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,860
- Why were you in Illinois?

293
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,100
- I grew up there.

294
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,933
- Right.

295
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,510
Why are you here?

296
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:50,480
- Because of Luke, he's from South Dakota,

297
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,830
and he proposed to me at Mount Rushmore.

298
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,313
- He did?
- Yeah.

299
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,790
- How far is it from here?

300
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,353
- What?

301
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,243
- Mount Rushmore.

302
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,123
- Five hours by drive.

303
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,843
- Let's go see it.

304
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,970
- I've seen it enough.

305
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,970
- I've never seen it.

306
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,850
I want to see it.

307
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,250
- Then go by yourself.

308
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,293
- No, I want us to go together.

309
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,800
- I can't.

310
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,633
- Why?

311
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:23,302
- I really can't.

312
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:24,779
- Please?
- No.

313
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,529
- Please?
- No.

314
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:28,203
No, no, no.

315
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:31,124
- Please?

316
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:38,590
- [Brother's Girlfriend] Hey.

317
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,423
- Hey.

318
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:40,700
- What's up?

319
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,120
- Just getting ready to go on a trip.

320
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,023
- By yourself?

321
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,233
- No, with Laurin.

322
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,810
- Our neighbor, Laurin?

323
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:49,643
- Yeah.

324
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,920
- I didn't know you guys
had become friends already.

325
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,803
- Yeah, she's,

326
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,377
we just clicked.

327
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,273
- Can I come?

328
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,113
- Why?

329
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,930
- I don't know, it'd just
be fun to go on a road trip.

330
00:28:20,102 --> 00:28:21,730
- You don't have to
come with us this time.

331
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,700
- Come on, it'd be fun.

332
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,123
I'll ask Daniel, and the
four of us can go together.

333
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,353
Come on, I'll pack my bag.

334
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,323
(car starting)

335
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,116
- Sorry for the wait, guys.

336
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:56,402
- [All] It's all right.

337
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,791
- Everybody ready?

338
00:28:57,791 --> 00:28:58,929
- Yeah.

339
00:28:58,929 --> 00:28:59,978
- Let's hit the road.

340
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,728
- [Daniel] All right.

341
00:29:10,728 --> 00:29:13,645
(light jazz music)

342
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:03,293
- What do you think of these?

343
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,473
- They're nice.

344
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,960
- You know, whatever you
decide about the wedding,

345
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,550
I'm good with it.

346
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,400
Just can't wait to be married to you.

347
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,540
- You're attitude's
changed all of a sudden.

348
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,373
Why?

349
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:26,003
- I haven't changed, I
just want you to be happy.

350
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,583
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

351
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:49,341
We forgot toothpaste.

352
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,913
- Ask them if they have any.

353
00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:16,206
(knocking on door)

354
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:22,334
- Hi.

355
00:31:22,334 --> 00:31:23,670
- Hi, do you have toothpaste?

356
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,723
- Yeah, hold on.

357
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:32,692
Here you go.

358
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:33,885
We have two, so you can hold on to it.

359
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,135
- Okay, thanks.

360
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:49,728
- I have a funny butt.

361
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,853
- I think a butt is a person's
most important feature.

362
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,651
- The butt?

363
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,484
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:32:04,053 --> 00:32:05,703
A butt says a lot about a person.

365
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,750
- What does your butt say about you?

366
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,813
- It says that I am kind.

367
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,140
- Your butt says that?

368
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,973
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,410
- What does my butt say?

370
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,993
- It says that you'll live a long life.

371
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,649
- Why does it say that?

372
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:36,482
- It just does.

373
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,560
- Maybe you should quit
your insurance agent job

374
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,903
and become an ass reader.

375
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,743
- You mean like, a palm
reader, but I read asses?

376
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,753
- Yeah.

377
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,160
What else does my butt say?

378
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,610
- I think it's a brilliant idea.

379
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,060
What else does your butt say?

380
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,323
That, you're vulnerable.

381
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,962
(soft piano)

382
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:13,212
What are you writing about?

383
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,932
- Wouldn't you like to know?

384
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:33,262
(bright orchestral music)

385
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:35,108
(laughing)

386
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:39,078
(crickets chirping)

387
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:43,728
(laughing)

388
00:34:50,323 --> 00:34:51,773
- [Daniel] Did you smoke pot?

389
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,402
- [Dong] No, we didn't.

390
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:55,577
- [Daniel] Yes you did.

391
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:57,827
(laughing)

392
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:01,550
Did you just smoke pot?

393
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,600
- Calm down.

394
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,850
- Don't tell me to calm down.

395
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,063
- Whoa.

396
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,360
- You can tell me to calm down,

397
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,823
but I can't tell you to calm down?

398
00:35:07,823 --> 00:35:09,920
- What the hell happened to you?

399
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,290
- Nothing.

400
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,837
None of your business.

401
00:35:12,837 --> 00:35:13,670
(giggling)

402
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,987
- Don't you dare smoke pot again.

403
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:16,820
- Okay.

404
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:25,070
(Dong laughing)

405
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,191
- Put it out right now!

406
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:29,650
- No!

407
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,780
- Don't you dare do this to me.

408
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,900
- To you?

409
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,220
None of it is about you.

410
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,980
- I said, put it out now.

411
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,620
- You can't tell me what to do.

412
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,650
- I am your brother.

413
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,600
- [Sarah] All right, let's
not do this here please.

414
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
- Yeah, a brother who thinks

415
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,430
he's the most successful,
the most popular,

416
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,480
the most important person in the world.

417
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,610
That's my brother.

418
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,410
- What the hell are you talking about?

419
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:53,060
- I'm talking about you
being a self-centered,

420
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,690
arrogant, asshole.

421
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,790
- [Sarah] Let's just go back to the motel.

422
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,760
- Mount Rushmore is an
iconic American institution.

423
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,797
It should not be (muffled).

424
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,910
- I don't see what the big deal is.

425
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,830
Aren't they just rocks?

426
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,080
- They're not just rocks.

427
00:36:38,123 --> 00:36:39,199
- What do you mean,
they're not just rocks?

428
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,030
- I mean they're not just rocks.

429
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,500
- Okay, you don't have to yell at me.

430
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,421
I'm just asking a question.

431
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:45,580
- Except well you keep
asking the question,

432
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,593
you're gonna make yourself sound like

433
00:36:46,593 --> 00:36:47,890
you don't know what you're talking about.

434
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,700
- Oh okay, so you know everything.

435
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,853
Everybody else is an
idiot compared to you.

436
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,303
- [Sarah] Guys, just stop it.

437
00:36:56,796 --> 00:36:59,629
(traffic passing)

438
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,620
- [Cashier] Here you go, two dollars.

439
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,453
- Cool.

440
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:26,403
(water running)

441
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:28,510
(phone ringing)

442
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:29,910
- Your cell phone's ringing.

443
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,113
Hello?

444
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,313
- [Man On Phone] When can we do it again?

445
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,680
- Who is this?

446
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,142
- [Man On Phone] Two days
ago you were in my bed

447
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:46,370
and now you don't know me?

448
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,203
- Who are you?

449
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,810
- [Man On Phone] Why are
you marrying that guy?

450
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,413
- What?

451
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,413
Hello?

452
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:57,600
- [Man On Phone] Oh hi.

453
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,260
- I told you never to call me again.

454
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,093
- I'm going outside.

455
00:38:00,093 --> 00:38:02,380
- No, wait, please please don't go.

456
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,260
I haven't said anything

457
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,420
about you sleeping with our neighbor,

458
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,220
so why can't you do the same for me?

459
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:23,429
(tense music)

460
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:49,503
- Are you feeling sexy or something?

461
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,370
- I have to tell you something.

462
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,863
- Sure.

463
00:39:14,695 --> 00:39:15,895
- I slept with somebody.

464
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:21,013
And I'm so sorry.

465
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,600
And it's never gonna happen again.

466
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,113
And I don't even know why
I did it, but I love you.

467
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,180
And I don't, I just can't,

468
00:39:38,515 --> 00:39:41,015
I just don't want there
to be anything between us.

469
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,043
- So,

470
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,202
I thought, so you mean,

471
00:39:54,202 --> 00:39:56,420
you recently slept with somebody,

472
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,470
not like

473
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:00,767
BD, before Daniel?

474
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,923
Wow.

475
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,323
- [Sarah] We're done.

476
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,993
- That's good.

477
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:27,670
(exhaling)

478
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,503
What, why?

479
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,950
Was this like before we got engaged,

480
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,080
or after we got engaged?

481
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,913
- After.

482
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,020
- So, then why did we get engaged?

483
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,820
Why did you say yes to me?

484
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,070
- Because I love you
and I want to marry you.

485
00:40:49,923 --> 00:40:52,496
And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

486
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,663
I don't know why I did it.

487
00:40:59,034 --> 00:40:59,867
I guess.

488
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,890
(somber piano music)

489
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:31,893
- I found it in your seat.

490
00:41:33,507 --> 00:41:34,840
- Where's Sarah?

491
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:38,424
- She left.

492
00:41:39,907 --> 00:41:42,410
(crickets chirping)

493
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,740
Confession, she

494
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,170
brilliantly pointed out.

495
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:51,869
- [Dong] What did she confess?

496
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,640
- You know the story.

497
00:42:02,558 --> 00:42:04,891
I'm the one who didn't know.

498
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,400
- [Dong] I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

499
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,326
- It's okay.

500
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,333
The wedding's off.

501
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,110
- I think you should take her back.

502
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,723
- Why?

503
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,803
- Because, she really loves you.

504
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,267
Besides, mom and dad
would be disappointed.

505
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,523
- Okay.

506
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,730
You've gotta stop that.

507
00:42:51,033 --> 00:42:52,510
- Why?

508
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,260
- We don't do things just for them.

509
00:42:55,817 --> 00:42:57,417
We do things for ourselves, too.

510
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,433
- But, wouldn't that be like selfish?

511
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,893
- No.

512
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:19,856
- Morning.

513
00:43:19,856 --> 00:43:21,040
- Morning.

514
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,840
You already made one.

515
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,460
- This one's for Laurin,
they're her favorite.

516
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,520
You want one?

517
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,603
- No, thanks.

518
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,683
So, you guys wanna leave after breakfast?

519
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,493
- Sure.

520
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,945
- I'm gonna get more food.

521
00:44:29,945 --> 00:44:32,862
(soft piano music)

522
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,808
You leave Sarah alone, understand?

523
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:17,020
You understand me?

524
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,720
Answer me if you understand me.

525
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,553
- Yeah, God.

526
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,086
Remember, she came to
me first, before you.

527
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,669
- [Dong] Punch him!

528
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,159
- You understand me?

529
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,043
- Loser!

530
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,270
(laughing)

531
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,330
You okay?

532
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,000
- It hurts to punch someone on the face.

533
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,833
- He deserved it.

534
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:48,943
- Completely agree.

535
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:04,685
(soft piano music)

536
00:46:04,685 --> 00:46:07,685
(crickets chirping)

537
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,477
(muffled speaking)

538
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:34,083
- [Laurin] In college
I wrote a ton of music.

539
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,620
- [Dong] About what?

540
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,980
- [Laurin] Memories,

541
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,303
how memories define who we are.

542
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,350
- [Dong] What if someone
doesn't have many memories?

543
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,183
- [Laurin] What are you talking about?

544
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,273
Everyone has memories.

545
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,940
- [Dong] I don't remember much
from when I was like eight.

546
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,530
Or, when I was 18.

547
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,680
Not even when I was 28.

548
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,523
And my early 30's are a blur.

549
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:10,443
- [Laurin] I can remember
pretty much everything.

550
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,790
- [Dong] Why?

551
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:14,040
- [Laurin] Can't help it.

552
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,859
- I'll always remember you.

553
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:23,859
(crickets chirping)

554
00:47:25,152 --> 00:47:28,069
(soft piano music)

555
00:47:54,243 --> 00:47:56,363
I'll always remember you.

556
00:47:56,363 --> 00:47:58,613
(laughing)

557
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:09,655
- Margaret?

558
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:12,681
Margaret?

559
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:15,678
- [Dong] Yeah?

560
00:49:42,257 --> 00:49:43,959
- What are you doing?

561
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:45,220
- What do you mean?

562
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,260
- I've been looking for
you all over the place.

563
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,640
- [Dong] I was here the whole time.

564
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,830
- [Laurin] I thought you left.

565
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,490
- I wouldn't leave without you.

566
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,563
We came together.

567
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,443
Do what?

568
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,623
- Never mind.

569
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,480
- Why are you acting like this?

570
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:13,260
- I'm sorry, let's just go back.

571
00:50:21,095 --> 00:50:23,845
(water sloshing)

572
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:40,985
(tense electronic music)

573
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,220
- Do you wanna talk, tell
me what's on your mind?

574
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,783
- [Laurin] Why did you want
me to go to Mount Rushmore?

575
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,840
- I thought it was fun.

576
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,693
- [Laurin] Fun, for you.

577
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,710
- For us.

578
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:34,700
Didn't you have fun?

579
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,533
- [Laurin] No.

580
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,323
- You didn't?

581
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:41,770
- [Laurin] It was too much memory.

582
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,863
Too much memory of Luke and I.

583
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,191
- I thought you said you
didn't love him anymore.

584
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:50,191
- [Laurin] You're right.

585
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,590
You're making this really
complicated for me.

586
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:55,886
- No I'm not.

587
00:51:55,886 --> 00:51:58,023
- [Laurin] Yeah, yeah you are.

588
00:52:00,122 --> 00:52:02,360
- I didn't do anything.

589
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,510
- [Laurin] Yes you did.

590
00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:07,150
- What did I do?

591
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,400
- [Laurin] You showed up.

592
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,230
- I showed up?

593
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,713
- [Laurin] Yeah, you showed up here.

594
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,350
- What about you, what are you doing here?

595
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,573
- [Laurin] I live here.

596
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,700
- Do you want me to leave?

597
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,390
- In the sight of God,

598
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,560
and in the face of this congregation,

599
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,110
to join together this man and this woman.

600
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:32,813
Daniel, repeat after me.

601
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,533
In the name of God, I Daniel
take you Sarah to be my wife.

602
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:40,980
- [Daniel] In the name of God,

603
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,460
I Daniel take you Sarah to be my wife.

604
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,090
- [Minister] To have and to
hold from this day forward.

00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,800

00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,380

00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,810

608
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:54,190
- [Minister] For richer, for poorer.

609
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:55,860
- For richer, for poorer.

610
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,970
- [Minister] In sickness and in health.

611
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,920
- In sickness and in health.

612
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,450

616
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,690

617
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,983

00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:30,223

627
00:53:30,223 --> 00:53:32,723
(flute music)

628
00:53:34,383 --> 00:53:37,883
(congregation applauding)

629
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:43,415
- Woo.

630
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:52,363
(romantic orchestral music)

631
00:54:01,481 --> 00:54:03,416
- [Dong] So, how are you doing?

632
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,060
- Not too bad.

633
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,110
Anything new for you?

634
00:54:08,116 --> 00:54:09,667
- Not really.

635
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:10,844
- That's good.

636
00:54:10,844 --> 00:54:12,031
(Dong muffled)

637
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:12,981
That's good.

638
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:14,273
- [Dong] Any plans to
(muffled) again any time soon?

639
00:54:15,588 --> 00:54:17,088
- [George] Yeah, in two weeks.

640
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:19,203
About a month.

641
00:54:20,818 --> 00:54:22,367
- Would you excuse me for a moment?

642
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:23,284
- Oh, sure.

643
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:29,306
(romantic orchestral music)

644
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,949
- [Dong] Are you having a good time?

645
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:39,782
- Hi.

646
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:44,879
How are you?

647
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,753
(gasping)

648
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:39,256
- Luke wants to get back together.

649
00:56:40,717 --> 00:56:41,550
- Really?

650
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:46,390
- He said I always wanted a child,

651
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,690
and he changed his mind and
he wants to give me that,

652
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:53,143
so that we can be a real family.

653
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,660
- How do you feel about that?

654
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,863
- I was happy at first,
when I heard him say it,

655
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,780
but then I didn't feel right about it.

656
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,153
I still want a child.

657
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:23,573
But he's just not the
right one to have one with,

658
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,340
so I told him I wasn't
gonna let him move back in.

659
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:34,465
- Good for you.

660
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,050
- You gonna take good care of yourself?

661
00:57:50,144 --> 00:57:50,977
- Yeah.

662
00:57:55,653 --> 00:57:58,403
(dramatic music)

663
00:59:53,403 --> 00:59:55,264
- Have a wonderful trip.

664
00:59:55,264 --> 00:59:56,127
- Thanks.

665
00:59:56,127 --> 01:00:01,127
- Come on!

666
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:06,440
- Call us when you get there.

667
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:32,459
(dramatic electronic music)

668
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,571
(gentle piano music)

669
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,177
(light jazz music)

670
01:04:34,918 --> 01:04:38,585
(dramatic electronic music)

671
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:12,866
(light jazz music)
