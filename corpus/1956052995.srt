1
00:00:33,007 --> 00:00:35,091
<i>Grace Morgan,
get back in this house!</i>

2
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:47,570
Grace!
Get back here!

3
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:48,604
<i>Grace!</i>

4
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:51,774
You sure
about this, Gracie?

5
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,160
I've never been more sure
about anything in my life.

6
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:05,254
You go now, you don't ever come back!
Never!

7
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,123
Go, Ken.
Drive! Now!

8
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:29,839
<i>House is
all buttoned up.</i>

9
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:33,092
Is there anything else
I can do?

10
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:35,178
No, thank you, Steve.

11
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:38,714
Is that from
your dad's office?

12
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,218
Yeah, it is.

13
00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:45,337
It's actually from
the Circle Cross.

14
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:47,390
Kennedy, trust me.

15
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:49,175
You don't want
to drag this out.

16
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:50,977
Just sign the papers
and sell it.

17
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:55,398
It's just my dad
was born on that ranch.

18
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:57,650
Grew up there.

19
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:01,353
Met my mother,
they fell in love.

20
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:03,706
I know how hard
this is for you,

21
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,825
but I'm here.

22
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,127
I'll help you
through it.

23
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:09,295
I promise.

24
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:15,918
You are his
sole beneficiary.

25
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:18,754
The Circle Cross
belongs to you now.

26
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:20,339
However, he stipulates

27
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,142
that if you should
choose to sell it,

28
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:25,728
you have to be there,
in person, to do it.

29
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:28,648
<i>So you're telling me
I actually have togothere</i>

30
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:29,882
to sell the ranch?

31
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,817
As a condition
of the will, yes.

32
00:03:33,237 --> 00:03:35,271
That doesn't make
any sense.

33
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:37,356
I mean, when
I was growing up

34
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,158
I used to beg him
to take me

35
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:40,743
to see that place.

36
00:03:40,827 --> 00:03:43,663
He always resisted.

37
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:45,364
<i>Nowhe says
I have to go?</i>

38
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:48,284
There's a cousin of yours
there who's an accountant.

39
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:51,087
Smith Blaine, he's been
keeping the books.

40
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:52,838
You think he might
have some answers?

41
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:54,757
Only one way
to find out.

42
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,429
Looks like I'm going
to Valentine.

43
00:04:05,018 --> 00:04:06,352
<i># Wake up, darling</i>

44
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:09,088
<i># It's just you and me</i>

45
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,940
<i># Everything feels right</i>

46
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:14,277
<i># Just like
it's meant to be #</i>

47
00:04:14,361 --> 00:04:15,928
<i># Let's live up
the morning #</i>

48
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:18,281
<i># Spend the afternoon</i>

49
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:19,982
<i># 'Cause we can't
take it with us #</i>

50
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:23,286
<i># And tomorrow
comes too soon #</i>

51
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:31,377
<i># In every single way</i>

52
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,463
<i># Today is the perfect day</i>

53
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:36,132
<i># For a perfect day</i>

54
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:42,454
<i># I don't want it to end</i>

55
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:44,724
<i># I don't want it to end</i>

56
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:48,060
<i># I don't want it to end</i>

57
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:52,982
<i># Unless we can do today
all over again #</i>

58
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:58,604
<i># All over again</i>

59
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:39,178
<i>You know,
it's been a long time</i>

60
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,730
since I last
saw your folks,

61
00:05:40,814 --> 00:05:44,200
but I do remember,
boy, they were good people.

62
00:05:44,284 --> 00:05:46,402
It's just a shame
they were never able

63
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:48,654
to make it back
to Valentine.

64
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,072
I think so, too.

65
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:52,575
But here we are now,
and if you don't mind,

66
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,211
-I'd like to just cut to the chase.
-Please.

67
00:05:56,997 --> 00:06:00,299
Did Talbot mention
that this is not

68
00:06:00,334 --> 00:06:03,135
the first offer we've had
on the ranch over the years?

69
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,171
<i>-No.
-As I understand it,</i>

70
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:08,474
your father wouldn't
consider selling.

71
00:06:08,508 --> 00:06:11,177
I can understand why he wanted
to hang onto the old place.

72
00:06:11,228 --> 00:06:14,013
He probably had some
sentimental attachment.

73
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:15,547
And you can take
my word for it,

74
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,216
that is a good offer

75
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,435
under the circumstances.

76
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,487
What circumstances?

77
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,823
Listen, running a ranch

78
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:27,827
is a dicey proposition
in the best of times.

79
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,497
<i>Onebad year can set you
back for a long time.</i>

80
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:33,332
And, well, the Circle Cross

81
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:37,753
has had more bad years
than good, here, recently.

82
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:39,789
The ranch is losing money?

83
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:42,258
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

84
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:46,879
You know, I'm not seeing a
buyer's name on here anywhere.

85
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,930
Well, at the present
they wish

86
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,748
to remain anonymous.

87
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,967
<i>But what Icantell you</i>

88
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:53,552
<i>is they areverymotivated.</i>

89
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:59,141
So, you can go ahead
and sign and date

90
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,943
right next to the "X."

91
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,930
You know, I did have
one question.

92
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:06,598
<i>Sure.</i>

93
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,367
Do you know why my father
put in his will

94
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:11,036
that I had to come here
to sell the ranch?

95
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,438
You know,
actually,

96
00:07:12,489 --> 00:07:15,541
I was kind of wondering
about that myself.

97
00:07:15,575 --> 00:07:18,828
You know, whenever my parents
talked about Valentine,

98
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,913
they always
called it home.

99
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,283
<i>Theirhome,</i>

100
00:07:24,334 --> 00:07:26,285
but it's not yours.

101
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:28,220
But I've never
even seen it.

102
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,005
It seems silly
to come all this way

103
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,341
and not have a look.

104
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,887
Hey, buddy.

105
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:19,104
<i>Where'd you come from?</i>

106
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,173
Okay.

107
00:08:22,726 --> 00:08:26,312
Can we just
be friends from afar?

108
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:27,313
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

109
00:08:27,364 --> 00:08:30,349
<i>I'm just taking
a peek around.</i>

110
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,850
Okay.
I'm not gonna bite.

111
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:34,703
I just wanna get
just a little bit closer

112
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,456
so I can see...

113
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:39,124
Quiet, Wilson!

114
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,744
Hey. Thanks.
Great dog.

115
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:43,629
-Are you lost?
-What?

116
00:08:43,663 --> 00:08:45,247
Main road's
back that way.

117
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,916
No, I was just

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,217
admiring the house.

119
00:08:48,301 --> 00:08:50,336
So you figured you'd
drive on private property,

120
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:51,921
invite yourself up
on the porch,

121
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:53,088
<i>and have a good look
through the window?</i>

122
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,423
No, that was not...

123
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,225
I don't go into
the city much.

124
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,310
Is this how it's done
these days?

125
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:00,095
Well, I don't come out
to the country much,

126
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,713
but I heard you people
were supposed to be friendly.

127
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:02,932
You want friendly?

128
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,433
Try knocking on the door
introducing yourself.

129
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:05,684
Maybe you should
introduce yourself

130
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,770
since you're the one
that's trespassing.

131
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,188
Excuse me?

132
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,190
This is the
Circle Cross Ranch?

133
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:12,691
Well, that's what
the sign says.

134
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,743
Well, my name
is Kennedy Blaine

135
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:16,529
and I own this property.

136
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,414
What are
you talking about?

137
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:19,832
Here.

138
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:22,334
See for yourself.

139
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:34,079
-You're Smith Blaine's cousin?
-That's right.

140
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,180
Second cousin,
technically.

141
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:37,383
I think... Which is
not the point.

142
00:09:37,434 --> 00:09:38,851
Smith didn't say
anything to me

143
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:40,436
about a new owner
showing up.

144
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,554
Well, why should he?

145
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,055
For all I know,
you're just some squatter.

146
00:09:43,106 --> 00:09:44,223
Now, hold on a minute.

147
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:45,808
<i>Derek.</i>

148
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:47,893
Didn't know
you had company.

149
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:49,562
She was just leaving.

150
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:51,647
I'm June Sterling.

151
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:54,283
I'm Kennedy Blaine.
Nice to meet you.

152
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:56,151
Your mom
was Grace Morgan.

153
00:09:56,236 --> 00:09:58,437
She ran off with Kenny
Blaine a long time ago.

154
00:09:58,488 --> 00:09:59,622
You knew my parents?

155
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:01,073
Well enough to
recognize their daughter.

156
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:03,993
I mean, you're the spitting
image of your mom.

157
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,077
Welcome home, honey.

158
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:10,082
You know, those families
were so dead-set against

159
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:12,334
your folks getting married.

160
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:14,303
Especially your grandfather,
Gabriel Morgan,

161
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:15,304
<i>he couldn't stand
the thought</i>

162
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:16,305
<i>of his only daughter</i>

163
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,423
<i>marrying a Blaine.</i>

164
00:10:18,592 --> 00:10:20,059
He's still alive,
you know.

165
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:21,393
No. No, I didn't.

166
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:23,896
Mom, she's not here
for a family reunion.

167
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,398
She claims to own
the Circle Cross now.

168
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:31,320
Does that mean that both
of your parents have p...

169
00:10:31,404 --> 00:10:36,575
My mom died five years ago,
and Dad died just recently.

170
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,160
They were still young,
I'm so sorry.

171
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,613
<i>Thank you.</i>

172
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,498
<i>Well, you did
the right thing coming here.</i>

173
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:43,832
Why don't you
stay for dinner?

174
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,318
No, I don't
want to impose

175
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,954
and I really wasn't
planning on a long stay.

176
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,005
Don't be silly.

177
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:51,006
We have plenty of room.

178
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:53,292
Stay with us.
Really, seriously.

179
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:56,512
All right.

180
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,213
Good, so you can
follow us to the house.

181
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:00,332
So you
don't live here?

182
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,217
No, this is
the main house.

183
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,469
That's where
the Blaines lived.

184
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,104
The, the foreman's house

185
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:07,022
is quite a ways
over there, actually.

186
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:09,725
Foreman?

187
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,226
You didn't tell her?

188
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:15,564
We were just getting to that.

189
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,449
<i>This makes
so much sense now.</i>

190
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:19,118
<i>I have a package for you.</i>

191
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:29,328
<i>The funny thing is that</i>

192
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:30,862
<i>John Morgan
and Alexander Blaine</i>

193
00:11:30,914 --> 00:11:32,864
<i>were best friends when
they came out west together</i>

194
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,633
<i>in the 1870's.</i>

195
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:36,919
<i>They were searching for gold
like everybody else.</i>

196
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:38,337
<i>However,</i>

197
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:39,722
the story goes that
it wasn't very long

198
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:43,092
before they both fell in
love with the same woman.

199
00:11:43,176 --> 00:11:44,376
So what happened?

200
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:47,045
Well, she chose Alexander

201
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,148
and the feud started,
right then and there.

202
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,016
It's been going ever since.

203
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,901
Such a waste.

204
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:55,904
So, Kennedy,
what do you do?

205
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:58,073
I just finished law school.

206
00:11:58,158 --> 00:11:59,324
<i>So I need to take
the bar exam</i>

207
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,826
next month
back in L.A.

208
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,561
Well, I hope you're gonna
have time to see the ranch

209
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,896
-before you go back.
-Yeah, I'd like that.

210
00:12:04,948 --> 00:12:06,031
Derek can show you around.

211
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,534
I have stuff to do

212
00:12:08,585 --> 00:12:10,502
for the next couple
of days, Mom, I'm sorry.

213
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:16,341
Listen, I'm sorry about
the whole "squatter" thing.

214
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:18,910
<i>I think I'm just nervous.</i>

215
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:20,763
This is all so sudden,
coming here.

216
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:23,549
Why are you here?

217
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:26,385
I'm here to close the sale.

218
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:31,890
Of the ranch?

219
00:12:31,941 --> 00:12:35,110
Yes, but I didn't know
anyone lived here.

220
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:38,147
<i>And... and now that I've seen
the property and the house,</i>

221
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,116
<i>I hadnoidea this
all belonged to me.</i>

222
00:12:41,201 --> 00:12:42,701
You know, it takes more
than a piece of paper

223
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:45,571
to belong to a place.

224
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:52,961
I'm gonna check
on the horses, Mom.

225
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:55,831
Nice meeting you.

226
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:58,133
Yeah, you too.

227
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,639
He's very protective.

228
00:13:03,723 --> 00:13:05,140
Loves this place
like it's his own.

229
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,142
He learned everything
there is to know

230
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:10,596
about taking care of it
from John, my husband.

231
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:12,848
So when he passed away,
it was just natural

232
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,133
Derek take over.

233
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,185
Hasn't been easy,

234
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,321
but we've always
taken those words to heart.

235
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,323
<i>We've been so blessed
to live here.</i>

236
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:25,244
Can't even imagine
a better place to call home.

237
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:29,081
The pa... the package.

238
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,623
Here.

239
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,295
"To Kennedy Blaine,
care of the Circle Cross Ranch,

240
00:13:43,346 --> 00:13:44,463
from Gregory Talbot."

241
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:46,048
He's our lawyer.

242
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,819
This is my mother's writing.

243
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:12,741
Dad must've had
this sent here.

244
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,078
Like he sent me.

245
00:14:42,272 --> 00:14:43,989
Mike, I'm full.

246
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,206
<i>"It's a classic story.</i>

247
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:02,925
<i>Forbidden love.</i>

248
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:05,043
<i>But for Kenny and I,
the only thing forbidden</i>

249
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:07,179
<i>was letting others
try to control our fate..."</i>

250
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,748
<i>"I'll admit, at first
it was a thrill,</i>

251
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,516
<i>dangerous and fun,</i>

252
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,101
<i>then it became a burden.</i>

253
00:15:13,186 --> 00:15:15,437
<i>Always on edge, always looking
over our shoulders..."</i>

254
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:19,758
<i>"One day, Kenny said our happiness
should never be a struggle.</i>

255
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:23,428
<i>He took me to his family's
ranch, the Circle Cross,</i>

256
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,931
<i>and there we fell deeper
in love with each other th..."</i>

257
00:15:36,075 --> 00:15:37,042
Hey.

258
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:40,963
Yeah, everything's
been good.

259
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:45,417
No, I know.
But it's only a few days

260
00:15:45,468 --> 00:15:48,303
and I still have a month
before the exam.

261
00:15:48,388 --> 00:15:50,555
I'll study while I'm here.

262
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,624
Yeah.
No, I know.

263
00:15:52,675 --> 00:15:54,676
Hey, listen.
I'm... I'm really tired,

264
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:57,512
I think I'm gonna
turn in early.

265
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,097
Is that okay?

266
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,650
Okay, thanks.

267
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,937
Goodnight, Steve.

268
00:16:43,685 --> 00:16:46,436
-Morning.
-Good morning.

269
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,438
Water's hot,
would you like some tea?

270
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:51,391
I actually need
to talk to Derek first.

271
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:54,277
-Is he around?
-You know, he was just riding out.

272
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:56,697
You might still
catch him in the stables.

273
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:57,864
Thanks.

274
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:06,072
Hey, there.

275
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:11,611
Well, you just pop up
everywhere, don't you?

276
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,513
<i>I could say
the same thing about you.</i>

277
00:17:21,889 --> 00:17:23,690
Are you looking for me?

278
00:17:23,725 --> 00:17:25,442
Yeah. I...

279
00:17:25,526 --> 00:17:27,194
I wanted to talk to you
about the ranch.

280
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:29,029
What about it?

281
00:17:29,063 --> 00:17:31,114
When was the last time
Smith Blaine was here?

282
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,099
The only time I see him

283
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:34,868
is when he gets
another offer.

284
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,573
You know, lucky for you
your dad had the sense

285
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:42,876
not to be tempted by dollar
signs over the years.

286
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,579
So you don't think
I should sell?

287
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,713
A person would
have to be a fool

288
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,465
to sell a place
like this.

289
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:50,083
Even with all the money
it's losing?

290
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,172
What are you talking
about, losing money?

291
00:17:55,256 --> 00:17:57,791
Smith painted a different
picture of this place.

292
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:59,926
He told me how rough
things have been lately.

293
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:01,762
Look, the Circle Cross
hasn't lost a dime

294
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,730
since I took over
as foreman.

295
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:06,566
The last four years
have been our best ever.

296
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,686
Your dad put the profits back into
the ranch, hired more hands...

297
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:11,354
Derek, I'm sure
you've done your best.

298
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,573
But Smith is our accountant.

299
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:15,409
He keeps very careful books.

300
00:18:16,611 --> 00:18:18,111
Well, he's not
the only one.

301
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,531
My father kept
written ledgers

302
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:24,317
while he ran the place.

303
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:25,419
I started
putting everything

304
00:18:25,453 --> 00:18:27,487
on a computer
when I took over.

305
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:31,491
Nothing fancy, but it
saves a lot of time.

306
00:18:34,846 --> 00:18:36,880
This is quite the set-up.

307
00:18:36,964 --> 00:18:40,100
Yeah, we got indoor plumbing,
now, and everything.

308
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:41,501
Hey, no, I wasn't...

309
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:42,686
<i>Look...</i>

310
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,221
That's got all
the ranch records

311
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:46,056
for the past four years.

312
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,475
You can see for yourself
how I do things.

313
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:51,862
Where you going?

314
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:54,648
I got a ranch to run.

315
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,886
It's a lot to take in
all at once.

316
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,304
I'll say.

317
00:19:19,173 --> 00:19:21,424
Have you been inside
the family house yet?

318
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:22,926
No, not yet.

319
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,394
You gotta see that.

320
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,646
I'm gonna go
get the keys.

321
00:19:26,681 --> 00:19:28,398
So Derek and I come over
here about once a week,

322
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,684
make sure everything's
okay, you know.

323
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:33,386
No leaks, no critters.

324
00:19:33,437 --> 00:19:35,655
Well, you've done
a great job.

325
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,158
Place has been kept
so beautiful.

326
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,944
You know, this room
pretty well tells

327
00:19:41,028 --> 00:19:42,946
<i>the Blaine family history.</i>

328
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,898
My father's family.

329
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,416
Thought you'd like this.

330
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:00,514
My mom and dad always
talked about how much

331
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:02,883
they loved growing up here.

332
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,139
But after Mom died, Dad never
mentioned Circle Cross again.

333
00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:10,807
Yeah, well, take it
from an old woman who knows

334
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,310
there's no greater force
in this universe

335
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:16,696
than true love.

336
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,449
<i>You're awisewoman,
not old.</i>

337
00:20:20,902 --> 00:20:22,619
And I'm old enough
to know the difference.

338
00:20:22,703 --> 00:20:24,371
Okay.

339
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:26,823
I'm gonna let you look around,
I'll see you later.

340
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:27,874
Okay.

341
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,666
<i>I don't understand.</i>

342
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,918
The ranch foreman
kept his own records?

343
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:13,987
He has everything
down to the penny.

344
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:17,591
And according to him,
the ranch is making money.

345
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,342
<i>Some years
better than others,</i>

346
00:21:19,427 --> 00:21:22,045
and Smith says it's been
losing money the whole time.

347
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:24,047
<i>What do you
know about this guy?</i>

348
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,766
He's a cowboy.

349
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:28,768
Meaning... what exactly?

350
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:33,056
It's like in the movies,
except real.

351
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,645
I mean, he's strong
and sure, stubborn.

352
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,731
Clearly a lot smarter
than he lets on, and...

353
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:46,569
and he seems
like a good man.

354
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:48,855
I'm not accusing
anybody of anything,

355
00:21:48,906 --> 00:21:50,790
but your father
received reports

356
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:53,376
<i>from Smith quarterly
for years.</i>

357
00:21:53,461 --> 00:21:55,361
Well, did he read them?

358
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,581
The ranch is the least
of your father's investments.

359
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,300
Did he ever
show them to you?

360
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:02,335
No, I don't even know
where they are.

361
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,205
Look, something is just
not adding up here

362
00:22:06,257 --> 00:22:08,842
and I gotta get
to the bottom of it.

363
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:14,213
<i>And I'll track down
Smith's records.</i>

364
00:22:14,265 --> 00:22:15,815
It might take a week,
but I'll go through everything

365
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,484
and get back to you.

366
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:19,152
Thank you.

367
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:22,238
How do you
like the place?

368
00:22:23,574 --> 00:22:24,908
It's growing on me.

369
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,201
Yes?

370
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:13,456
Hi. I'm here
to see Gabriel Morgan.

371
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,874
My name is Kennedy Blaine.

372
00:23:21,282 --> 00:23:23,283
Is Mr. Morgan
expecting you?

373
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,070
I'm his granddaughter.

374
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:55,065
Have a seat.

375
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:57,400
This isn't a social call,
I prefer to stand.

376
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,404
Suit yourself.
State your purpose.

377
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:05,275
Are you behind the offer
to buy Circle Cross?

378
00:24:07,027 --> 00:24:10,413
I wouldn't take that property
if you gave it to me.

379
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,449
I don't want anything
owned by a Blaine.

380
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:15,568
Yeah, well, I'm
a prime example of that.

381
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,921
Your parents
should've told you.

382
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:18,955
You're not wanted here.

383
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,074
They told me,
and I stayed away

384
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,426
until now.

385
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:25,979
<i>But I'm not here for
travel advice, Mr. Morgan.</i>

386
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:29,215
I just want one more
thing before I go.

387
00:24:31,435 --> 00:24:33,103
An explanation.

388
00:24:33,187 --> 00:24:34,387
For what?

389
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,423
How you treated my mother.

390
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,226
Your daughter. Why?

391
00:24:40,277 --> 00:24:44,898
Our families have had
a long history together.

392
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:46,766
You can't just
roll into town

393
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,486
and expect to understand
every little, itsy-bitsy

394
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,654
thing between people.

395
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,791
They were in love.
They were happy.

396
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,460
<i>What's so wrong with that?</i>

397
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,612
What's wrong with you?

398
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:02,665
No, no, no.
I'm... I'm only laughing

399
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,451
because your mother
stood right there

400
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,387
25 years ago,

401
00:25:07,421 --> 00:25:11,057
and asked
those same questions.

402
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:13,176
I don't explain,

403
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,980
I don't justify
my actions to anybody.

404
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:19,682
Now, unless you
have other business...

405
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:23,653
She missed you.
We all did.

406
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,907
Well...

407
00:25:27,942 --> 00:25:32,478
it was as much her choice
to do what she did

408
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,697
as it was mine
to let her go.

409
00:25:37,084 --> 00:25:39,485
I think I got all
the information I need.

410
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,955
Self-confidence...

411
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:44,424
and determination.

412
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:46,209
You know where
that came from?

413
00:25:48,596 --> 00:25:51,097
You may've been
born a Blaine,

414
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:55,167
<i>but you're a Morgan,
through and through.</i>

415
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:57,804
I like that.

416
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,472
Thanks for your time.

417
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,697
<i>I'm doing everything I can.</i>

418
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:12,533
No, of course
she's gonna sell.

419
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,202
She's not a rancher,
she's a city girl.

420
00:26:15,253 --> 00:26:16,620
We just need to give her
a little time

421
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,956
to get over the whole
dewy-eyed thing

422
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,875
with the ranch
and her parents, and the...

423
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,428
No, listen to me.

424
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:26,430
I've worked too hard
to make this happen.

425
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:29,383
One way or another,
this deal's going through.

426
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,029
<i>Sorry to bother you,
Boss, but I figured</i>

427
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:43,764
<i>you'd wanna see this.</i>

428
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,115
Check it out.

429
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,792
<i>Looks like somebody
made themselves right at home.</i>

430
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:58,796
Yeah, we checked the area,
but we didn't see anybody.

431
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,468
They've been here
for a couple of days.

432
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:05,970
<i>Could be a drifter.</i>

433
00:27:06,054 --> 00:27:08,422
<i>Maybe already moved on?</i>

434
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:10,674
I'll clean this up.

435
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,460
That way, if he comes back
he'll know we're onto him.

436
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,179
Sure.

437
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:17,965
Tell the others to keep
an eye out, okay?

438
00:27:18,016 --> 00:27:19,266
Sure thing, boss.

439
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,665
Seriously?

440
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:36,083
All right.

441
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,870
Chewy bone.

442
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:41,589
All right, truce?

443
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,794
You know there's more
where that came from.

444
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:51,215
Hello?

445
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:52,433
Back here.

446
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:58,171
Hey.

447
00:27:58,223 --> 00:27:59,223
Hey.

448
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:01,942
So, what's all this?

449
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:03,644
Well, I figured
since I'm a Blaine,

450
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:06,196
I should be staying
in the Blaine house.

451
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:09,182
<i>You wanted to know
why I'm here</i>

452
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:11,068
<i>and today, it hit me.</i>

453
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:13,537
I want to know more
about my family.

454
00:28:13,622 --> 00:28:14,989
And what better way,

455
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,408
than to stay
in my father's old house?

456
00:28:19,577 --> 00:28:21,545
It's a big house
for one person.

457
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,030
I'll be fine.

458
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:24,798
Besides, it takes more
than a piece of paper

459
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,417
to belong
to a place, right?

460
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:32,256
Okay, fair enough.

461
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:39,396
I, I saw
my grandfather today.

462
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:40,681
You did?

463
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,850
How'd that go?

464
00:28:44,235 --> 00:28:46,770
I expected him
to answer my questions.

465
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:48,689
Tell me all the things
he's been holding in

466
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,607
for so many years and...

467
00:28:52,077 --> 00:28:53,827
he laughed at me.

468
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:57,831
Whatever he had to say,

469
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:00,617
he said it to your folks
a long time ago.

470
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:02,369
That old man
is so stubborn,

471
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,921
he can argue
with a wall.

472
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,040
And win.

473
00:29:07,676 --> 00:29:09,910
Hey.

474
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:11,378
Don't let it get to you.

475
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:17,101
Well, if he's waiting for me
to run away like my parents,

476
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:19,053
he'll be waiting
for a long time.

477
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,643
<i>Hey, Derek, listen.
I went over your records</i>

478
00:29:26,728 --> 00:29:28,145
<i>-for the ranch?
-Yeah?</i>

479
00:29:28,229 --> 00:29:29,429
They look fine to me.

480
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:30,731
Well, good.

481
00:29:30,782 --> 00:29:32,566
What I don't understand
is why Smith would tell me

482
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,618
we've been losing
money all along.

483
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:35,903
Well, maybe
you should ask him.

484
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:37,604
I will,
just after my lawyer

485
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:39,123
has a chance to look
at your records.

486
00:29:39,207 --> 00:29:41,325
You just said
they were fine, right?

487
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:43,944
Mr. Talbot has access
to all the reports

488
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,245
that Smith had been
sending my dad.

489
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:47,164
He just needs
to compare them.

490
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:49,500
To make sure who's
telling the truth.

491
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,418
No, Derek,
you don't understand.

492
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:54,054
My father was
a solid businessman,

493
00:29:54,089 --> 00:29:56,223
but after my mother died,
he wasn't himself.

494
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:58,258
He was heartbroken.

495
00:29:58,309 --> 00:29:59,977
I mean, I doubt he ever
looked at those reports.

496
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:01,979
Smith could've been
telling him anything.

497
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:03,981
Look, do me a favor.

498
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:05,298
Once you get the
comparison back,

499
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,634
talk to me first,
not Smith.

500
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:09,469
Why?

501
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:11,188
He thinks he's
the big dog around here.

502
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:12,489
He doesn't like
to be crossed.

503
00:30:12,574 --> 00:30:14,775
If you have to confront him,
I would like to go with you.

504
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:15,943
Let him sit across from me

505
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:17,611
saying that the ranch
is losing money.

506
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:24,001
Okay, will do. Thanks.

507
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:25,869
No problem.

508
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,755
Wilson, come on, boy.
Let's go home.

509
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,424
Let's go, boy.

510
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:34,294
Hey, what's wrong with you?

511
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:39,716
He usually don't warm up
to anybody this fast.

512
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:41,635
Well, I'm not so bad.

513
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:45,389
Once you get to know me.

514
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:46,523
Wilson, come on, boy.

515
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,509
Let's go home.

516
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:55,515
What's wrong with you, buddy?
You wanna go home?

517
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:58,152
You want to go home?

518
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:16,220
<i>I'm sorry,
am I missing something?</i>

519
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:18,222
<i>I thought that the whole
point of going there,</i>

520
00:31:18,306 --> 00:31:20,373
<i>was to sell the ranch.</i>

521
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:22,309
It was. I mean,
that's what I thought.

522
00:31:22,343 --> 00:31:25,879
But none of this
is what I expected.

523
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,148
<i>Well, I'm sure
it's a wonderful place,</i>

524
00:31:28,183 --> 00:31:29,266
<i>with lots of nice people,</i>

525
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,218
<i>but, Kennedy,
your life is here.</i>

526
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,320
<i>You have
a home, friends.</i>

527
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:34,938
<i>You're starting a new career
which, by the way,</i>

528
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:36,773
<i>you're falling way behind
studying for the bar.</i>

529
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:38,575
Yeah, yeah.
I was thinking about that.

530
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,528
What if I took
the bar exam here?

531
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:42,863
<i>You're not serious.</i>

532
00:31:42,914 --> 00:31:46,834
There is still a lot of work
to do with the ranch.

533
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:48,619
<i>Well, it... you want
to live there?</i>

534
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:51,788
I think I need
to find out what I want.

535
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:56,093
<i>Kennedy...</i>

536
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:58,262
<i>I miss you.</i>

537
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:00,247
<i>I know we've never talked
about it in so many words,</i>

538
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:04,051
<i>but I always thought
that you and I...</i>

539
00:32:04,102 --> 00:32:06,136
<i>that we belong together.</i>

540
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,271
<i>Here.</i>

541
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,807
<i>We belotogether?</i>

542
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,593
Steve, where is this
coming from?

543
00:32:13,645 --> 00:32:15,428
<i>I...</i>

544
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:17,998
<i>I just thought that...</i>

545
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:21,601
L... Listen, it's getting late.

546
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:24,655
<i>Can we talk about this
some other time?</i>

547
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,740
<i>Sure.</i>

548
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:28,075
<i>Yeah.</i>

549
00:32:29,244 --> 00:32:31,328
<i>Goodnight.</i>

550
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:32,713
Goodnight.

551
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,087
<i>Morning.</i>

552
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:21,338
Hi.

553
00:33:21,372 --> 00:33:23,090
Didn't mean to scare you.

554
00:33:23,174 --> 00:33:25,575
No, I just... I didn't
hear you drive up.

555
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:29,963
Well, I'm sorry, but is this
the Circle Cross Ranch?

556
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:30,964
Yeah, that's right.

557
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:32,182
A fellow in town
says you might

558
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:33,684
be doing some hiring.

559
00:33:33,718 --> 00:33:34,885
I'm sorry,
you're gonna have to talk

560
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:36,970
to the ranch foreman
about that.

561
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:38,305
Derek Sterling.

562
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:39,440
Derek Sterling.

563
00:33:39,524 --> 00:33:41,475
That's right. Yeah,
I do know the name.

564
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:46,146
He lives just over there.

565
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:47,531
Over there?

566
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:51,735
He's a friend of yours?

567
00:33:53,288 --> 00:33:54,404
I own the ranch.

568
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,908
Nice place.

569
00:33:57,959 --> 00:34:00,744
Kinda big, though, for you
to have all to yourself.

570
00:34:00,795 --> 00:34:02,412
Way out here
in the middle of nowhere.

571
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:05,949
You know, why don't I call him
and tell him you're here.

572
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,668
-I'm sure he'll be...
-No, that's okay.

573
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:09,002
I could find him.

574
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:10,120
Thank you,
you have a nice day.

575
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:15,492
<i>Did you get his name?</i>

576
00:34:15,543 --> 00:34:17,711
<i>No, he just said
he was looking for work.</i>

577
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:19,129
<i>I mean, anyone
from around here</i>

578
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:20,430
knows we only hire
extra hands

579
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:22,266
in the fall for round-up.

580
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,767
Well, he didn't exactly
look like he knew

581
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:25,219
one end of a horse
from the other.

582
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,104
What do you mean?

583
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:29,556
I don't know.
I just...

584
00:34:29,641 --> 00:34:33,277
I grew up in the city, and I
got the feeling so did he.

585
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:34,811
He said he knew your name.

586
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:38,148
What'd he look like?

587
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,201
Stocky. Dark hair.

588
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:43,453
Looked like he'd
slept in his clothes.

589
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:46,323
And he had a...
A scar on his cheek.

590
00:34:48,376 --> 00:34:50,043
Do you know him?

591
00:34:50,128 --> 00:34:51,695
Probably he just

592
00:34:51,746 --> 00:34:53,714
heard my name
in town, you know?

593
00:34:53,798 --> 00:34:55,883
I'll take a look around,
just in case.

594
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:57,167
All right, thanks.

595
00:34:57,218 --> 00:34:59,803
Hey...

596
00:34:59,837 --> 00:35:02,422
I was supposed to give Mom
a ride into Valentine.

597
00:35:02,507 --> 00:35:03,891
Would you mind?

598
00:35:03,975 --> 00:35:06,426
Not at all. I need
to pick up something

599
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:09,045
a little more appropriate
to wear around here anyway.

600
00:35:09,097 --> 00:35:10,397
I appreciate it.

601
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:35,455
Hey, listen.
I'm getting called back

602
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,758
into a meeting. Can I
get back to you later?

603
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:39,009
Great, thanks.

604
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,551
What's the occasion?

605
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:49,586
Well,
the Dandelion Festival.

606
00:35:49,637 --> 00:35:51,421
Every year, the church
raises money by selling

607
00:35:51,472 --> 00:35:53,690
foods, and arts and crafts,
and things, too.

608
00:35:53,725 --> 00:35:55,108
And we bring kids
out from the city

609
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:56,693
to spend the weekend here,

610
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:59,095
and they go camping,
and fishing, and...

611
00:35:59,147 --> 00:36:00,647
you know, getting
some fresh air.

612
00:36:00,732 --> 00:36:03,450
-That sounds wonderful.
-It's fun.

613
00:36:03,534 --> 00:36:05,152
And Pastor Morgan,
he sets up a booth

614
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:08,271
every year so he wants me
to sell my, what he calls,

615
00:36:08,323 --> 00:36:10,657
"World famous
dandelion pies."

616
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:11,941
Another Morgan.

617
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:12,993
Apart from my grandfather,

618
00:36:13,077 --> 00:36:15,379
I haven't met anyone
on the Morgan side yet.

619
00:36:15,413 --> 00:36:16,880
That's easy to fix.
Come to church with us

620
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:18,966
on Sunday and
I'll introduce you.

621
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,468
I'd like that.

622
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:23,971
So do you have a lot
of family here in Valentine?

623
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:26,056
No, it's just
Derek and Me.

624
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:30,560
Still, it must've been nice
for him growing up here.

625
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:32,813
Well, Derek didn't
grow up here.

626
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:34,014
John and I did.

627
00:36:34,098 --> 00:36:36,350
Yeah, see, back then
it wasn't easy

628
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:38,402
to get a good-paying job
around here.

629
00:36:38,436 --> 00:36:39,770
So we moved to Chicago.

630
00:36:39,821 --> 00:36:41,471
John worked in a factory.

631
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,992
We were young and we
wanted this big family,

632
00:36:45,076 --> 00:36:46,976
but it didn't happen.

633
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:51,365
And, so... I was actually
volunteering at a city mission

634
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:53,784
and Derek came up
for adoption.

635
00:36:53,835 --> 00:36:56,036
That's so nice.

636
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,540
Our prayers
were definitely answered.

637
00:37:00,625 --> 00:37:02,542
So how long did you
live in Chicago?

638
00:37:02,627 --> 00:37:04,845
We didn't move
back to Valentine

639
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:07,297
until Derek
was almost 16.

640
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,516
Never would've guessed.

641
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,852
Well, it wasn't easy

642
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:14,504
for him growing up
in the city.

643
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:15,555
What do you mean?

644
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:22,029
<i>You know, this isn't
reallymystory to tell.</i>

645
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,447
And we still have
a lot of shopping to do.

646
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:26,316
<i>So, vamanos.</i>

647
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:27,784
Right.

648
00:38:09,527 --> 00:38:11,194
We just missed him, boy.

649
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:17,617
<i>Kennedy!</i>

650
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:20,253
-Well, there you are.
-Hi.

651
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:22,071
I tried to call you,

652
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:24,207
but I kept getting
your answering machine.

653
00:38:24,258 --> 00:38:26,460
I was afraid you were
on your way back home.

654
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:28,795
No, I'm staying
at the ranch.

655
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,847
Reception's not
always the best.

656
00:38:30,882 --> 00:38:34,101
I was curious if you
thought about that offer.

657
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:36,085
Haven't stopped
thinking about it.

658
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:39,439
The other party is very
eager to close that deal.

659
00:38:39,524 --> 00:38:42,392
I'm sure, place is
a steal at that price.

660
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:44,978
What are you saying?

661
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:47,197
I think you know
what I'm saying.

662
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:49,699
Mr. Talbot and I just have
to do our due diligence.

663
00:38:49,734 --> 00:38:50,867
Shouldn't take long.

664
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:53,787
Well, then.

665
00:38:53,871 --> 00:38:55,288
You have a good day, June.

666
00:38:55,373 --> 00:38:56,907
-Say hi to Derek for me, will you?
-I will.

667
00:38:58,576 --> 00:39:00,210
Enjoy your stay.

668
00:39:00,244 --> 00:39:02,162
Will do.

669
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:21,345
-Your friends miss you.
-Steve.

670
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:24,014
I think he wishes
he was more than a friend.

671
00:39:24,098 --> 00:39:26,433
And he's not?

672
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:29,219
He's a sweet guy,
met in law school.

673
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:30,637
Became study partners.

674
00:39:30,688 --> 00:39:32,556
Spent a lot of late
nights together...

675
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,524
And he fell in love.

676
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:37,361
<i>We arenota couple.</i>

677
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:38,695
He really cares about me,

678
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,865
but if there
was anything there,

679
00:39:41,949 --> 00:39:44,451
I should miss him more...

680
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:45,952
and I don't.

681
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:49,522
Do you ride?

682
00:39:49,574 --> 00:39:51,191
<i>When other kids
were practicing the piano,</i>

683
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:54,194
I was taking riding lessons.

684
00:39:54,245 --> 00:39:58,999
My parents used to always
hang around and watch.

685
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,134
Think it must've reminded
them of this place.

686
00:40:04,806 --> 00:40:06,306
Hey, do you think...

687
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,841
do you think
it'd be all right?

688
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,844
It's your horse.

689
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,564
I'll go get changed.

690
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,272
What're you doing?

691
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:13,490
How am I supposed
to know it was you

692
00:41:13,574 --> 00:41:14,541
coming out of nowhere?

693
00:41:18,246 --> 00:41:20,797
What? What are you looking
at me like that for?

694
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:22,082
You can ride?

695
00:41:23,334 --> 00:41:25,469
Yeah. I mean,
a little, you know.

696
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:28,221
No, I didn't know.
I know now.

697
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:33,393
Since you can ride,
let me show you the place.

698
00:42:34,822 --> 00:42:37,741
-This is beautiful.
-Yeah.

699
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:41,494
It is beautiful.

700
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:47,133
Do you see that
tree line over there?

701
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:50,220
Where? ...
Right there.

702
00:42:50,304 --> 00:42:52,472
You see? There's a valley

703
00:42:52,506 --> 00:42:55,392
that runs between
those hills there.

704
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:57,928
Can you believe that wagon trains
used to bring settlers through here

705
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:59,679
on their way west?

706
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,931
-Really?
-Yeah.

707
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:02,098
If you look close
on the trail,

708
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:03,733
you can still see
where the wheels

709
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:05,068
were torn in the ground.

710
00:43:07,238 --> 00:43:10,273
Your mother said there
was a family graveyard?

711
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:12,525
Yeah. Not just
family, either.

712
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:15,996
There's folks buried there, this is
as far as they got on the trail.

713
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,002
It's a long ride out.
I'll take you next time.

714
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:29,459
You know, my parents
always talked about

715
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:32,412
how special this place was.

716
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:35,015
I'm really glad that
I'm seeing it for myself.

717
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:40,720
And what do you think
about this place?

718
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:43,273
I think they were right.

719
00:43:45,943 --> 00:43:49,396
Thank you for showing me.

720
00:43:50,648 --> 00:43:51,898
My pleasure.

721
00:43:56,621 --> 00:43:58,655
We should...
We should start back.

722
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,206
It'll be dark soon.

723
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:18,925
I was thinking...

724
00:44:18,976 --> 00:44:20,293
I really think you should
stay here tonight

725
00:44:20,344 --> 00:44:21,511
with Mom and me.

726
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:23,013
Just in case
that fellow comes back.

727
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:24,597
Listen, it took me
my whole life to get here,

728
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:26,816
I'm not gonna let
anybody scare me off now.

729
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:28,852
Hey, look.

730
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:30,020
Cuddy and Brian,
they came across

731
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,655
some empty bottles and trash

732
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:32,972
in one of the old barns.

733
00:44:33,024 --> 00:44:34,407
If there's someone out there,
I think we just...

734
00:44:34,442 --> 00:44:38,278
Hey, if I hear anything,
I'll call you, I promise.

735
00:44:40,281 --> 00:44:42,315
-All right.
-Okay.

736
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:44,668
So, goodnight, then.

737
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:48,588
Hey, Wilson. Stay.

738
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:51,007
You coming with me?

739
00:44:51,092 --> 00:44:52,592
<i>Well, you're
such good buddies.</i>

740
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:54,461
Now you can be roomies.

741
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:55,879
He better not snore.

742
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:57,681
He does.

743
00:44:57,765 --> 00:44:58,965
Heavily.

744
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,306
You been out here
all night?

745
00:45:52,436 --> 00:45:54,654
Thank you.

746
00:45:56,524 --> 00:45:58,241
You don't need
to do this.

747
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:05,165
I better get changed,
I don't wanna be late.

748
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,700
-Late?
-For church.

749
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:11,371
Are you gonna make it
to the festival?

750
00:46:11,422 --> 00:46:13,006
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

751
00:46:14,425 --> 00:46:16,209
We'll pick you up
on our way into town.

752
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,045
Great.

753
00:46:20,381 --> 00:46:22,048
Thanks for the coffee.

754
00:47:23,527 --> 00:47:24,744
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

755
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:31,618
<i>Silly old man.</i>

756
00:47:32,703 --> 00:47:33,870
Living up in his castle

757
00:47:33,954 --> 00:47:36,706
all hanging onto
that bitterness.

758
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,042
He doesn't even know me.

759
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:43,930
You know what?
We've got pies to sell.

760
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,231
Yes, we do.

761
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:52,355
<i>Well, folks, we've
got lots of exciting events</i>

762
00:47:52,406 --> 00:47:54,657
<i>going on at this year's
Dandelion Festival.</i>

763
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:56,709
<i>A new cooking
demonstration every hour,</i>

764
00:47:56,794 --> 00:47:58,795
<i>with all sorts
of dandelion recipes.</i>

765
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:00,830
<i>And this year's art show
and silent auction</i>

766
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:03,049
<i>promises to be our best.</i>

767
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:04,968
<i>But now it's time to get
all the kids together</i>

768
00:48:05,002 --> 00:48:06,836
<i>for the Dandelion
Scavenger Hunt.</i>

769
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:16,763
<i>And make sure to stop by the
Valentine Church bake sale</i>

770
00:48:16,847 --> 00:48:19,899
<i>and to take home some
World Famous Dandelion Pie.</i>

771
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,267
<i>Thank you.
Enjoy your pie.</i>

772
00:48:21,352 --> 00:48:23,102
Hey, guys, we're actually
running out of plates.

773
00:48:23,187 --> 00:48:24,103
-I'll get it.
-You sure?

774
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:25,188
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

775
00:48:26,941 --> 00:48:28,524
<i>Support your
annual camping trip</i>

776
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:29,525
<i>for inner city kids.</i>

777
00:48:33,497 --> 00:48:34,697
Excuse me.

778
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,199
You must be
the long-lost cousin

779
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,951
I've been hearing about.

780
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:39,869
Tom Morgan,
welcome to Valentine.

781
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,170
Kennedy Blaine. Thank you.

782
00:48:41,205 --> 00:48:43,006
I could tell you're family

783
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,907
a mile off.

784
00:48:44,959 --> 00:48:46,175
You have your mother's smile.

785
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:47,176
Really?

786
00:48:47,211 --> 00:48:49,629
<i>What a sweetheart,
that girl.</i>

787
00:48:49,713 --> 00:48:51,965
So, Kennedy, what do you
think of our little town?

788
00:48:52,049 --> 00:48:54,917
I like it. Especially what
you're doing for those kids.

789
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,053
<i>Well, we're hoping
for the best.</i>

790
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,855
For the last couple years,

791
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,140
Charlie Whalen's been letting
the kids camp out at his ranch,

792
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:03,309
but he's been laid up ever since
that horse of his threw him,

793
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:06,112
and I'm... I'm having a hard
time recruiting anybody else.

794
00:49:07,898 --> 00:49:09,098
<i>-Pastor Morgan?
-Mhm?</i>

795
00:49:09,149 --> 00:49:10,766
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but the cookout's

796
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:12,318
just about to start.

797
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:13,486
Robin, what would
I do without you?

798
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:15,488
Thank you so much.

799
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:17,657
-Have the two of you met?
-No.

800
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:19,909
Robin.
This is Kennedy Blaine.

801
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,794
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

802
00:49:21,879 --> 00:49:24,213
Kennedy is one of
the Circle Cross Blaines.

803
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,133
I heard you were in town.

804
00:49:27,217 --> 00:49:28,801
I understand
the ranch is for sale.

805
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,170
Robin works with the
State Historical Society.

806
00:49:31,255 --> 00:49:32,672
Well,
nothing's final yet.

807
00:49:32,756 --> 00:49:34,340
I'm still going through
the paperwork.

808
00:49:34,425 --> 00:49:36,625
Well.

809
00:49:36,677 --> 00:49:39,345
You and I need to talk.

810
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,231
But first, we have
to get to that cook-off.

811
00:49:42,266 --> 00:49:45,068
Yes, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

812
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:46,819
We'll see you soon, "cuz."

813
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:51,658
See you soon.

814
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:57,697
Looks like you and Pastor
Morgan hit it off.

815
00:49:57,781 --> 00:49:58,865
We did.

816
00:49:58,949 --> 00:50:01,084
He is such
a lovely man.

817
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:03,369
He told me about
the trouble they're having

818
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:05,505
finding a campsite
for the inner city kids.

819
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:07,990
What do you mean, what about
Charlie Whalen's ranch?

820
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:09,459
I guess he can't do it.

821
00:50:10,627 --> 00:50:12,011
That's a shame.

822
00:50:12,096 --> 00:50:14,430
I was actually thinking

823
00:50:14,465 --> 00:50:16,966
maybe they could come
to Circle Cross.

824
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:18,217
What do you think?

825
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:20,470
-I think that's a great idea.
-Absolutely.

826
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,388
I mean, you guys have
so much on your plates...

827
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:23,723
-Kennedy, look... No, no, no.
-No.

828
00:50:23,807 --> 00:50:25,525
This is what we do,
okay?

829
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:28,478
Just... whatever you need,
just let us know.

830
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,313
Thank you.

831
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:31,731
No, thank you.

832
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:33,682
I mean, if you're free
we can take a ride.

833
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:34,784
Pick out a campsite.

834
00:50:34,818 --> 00:50:36,703
-You don't mess around.
-No, ma'am.

835
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:41,741
All right. I'll go tell
Pastor Morgan.

836
00:50:41,825 --> 00:50:43,910
-I'm excited.
-Me too.

837
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:50,550
She's about to make
some kids very happy.

838
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:52,335
More than she
will ever know.

839
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,471
You like her, don't you?

840
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:19,728
Lily Ann?

841
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,831
She was Alexander Blaine's
daughter.

842
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:24,700
She was just a child.

843
00:51:24,752 --> 00:51:26,836
I know.

844
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,123
There was this outbreak
of cholera that year.

845
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:32,175
They say that whatever
hope there may have been

846
00:51:32,209 --> 00:51:35,244
of the Blaines and Morgans
patching things up,

847
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,130
it was lost after
John Morgan refused

848
00:51:37,214 --> 00:51:40,466
to come to her funeral.

849
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:42,885
My parents never told me
that story growing up.

850
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:44,753
Well, It's not the kind
of story you can tell

851
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:46,139
a little girl, right?

852
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:49,642
I guess not.

853
00:51:49,726 --> 00:51:52,261
But it's not the way
it works, is it?

854
00:51:52,312 --> 00:51:55,698
I mean, you can't just
tell the good parts.

855
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:56,783
All that anger,

856
00:51:56,867 --> 00:51:58,151
and bitterness.

857
00:51:58,235 --> 00:51:59,952
<i>It's part of
the story, too.</i>

858
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,442
<i>You know more
about my family than I do.</i>

859
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:08,744
<i>-No.
-Yeah. It's a little embarrassing.</i>

860
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,129
<i>No, no, no, you
shouldn't feel that way.</i>

861
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,381
I mean, I just know
the history of the land.

862
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,800
It just happens to be
your family's land,

863
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:15,551
that's it.

864
00:52:15,586 --> 00:52:18,754
Everything out here
is so untouched.

865
00:52:18,806 --> 00:52:21,340
It's so different
from the city.

866
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:22,592
It's like you
can sense exactly

867
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:26,145
how people felt
a hundred years ago.

868
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:29,599
It makes me feel...

869
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,017
I don't know,

870
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:32,018
Connected?

871
00:52:32,102 --> 00:52:33,736
-No way.
-No, yeah. Exactly.

872
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:38,908
It's like you feel you're part of
something bigger than you, right?

873
00:52:38,942 --> 00:52:41,577
Did you feel different when
your parents brought you here?

874
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:44,497
What?

875
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:47,650
Your mom told me.
About Chicago.

876
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:50,152
"About Chicago" what?
What was it?

877
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:51,954
Nothing, I mean...

878
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:53,706
she said you
weren't happy there.

879
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,993
I'm sorry, did I say
something wrong?

880
00:52:58,045 --> 00:53:00,763
No, it's just...
just something

881
00:53:00,797 --> 00:53:03,332
I don't like to talk
about, that's it.

882
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:05,852
-Why not?
-Just don't, okay?

883
00:53:05,936 --> 00:53:07,303
We should start back.

884
00:53:08,472 --> 00:53:09,772
Okay.

885
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:32,328
<i>Sure beats
the streets, D?</i>

886
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,302
What do you want?

887
00:53:39,336 --> 00:53:41,387
Now, is that any way
to greet an old friend

888
00:53:41,471 --> 00:53:44,039
from Chicago
after all these years?

889
00:53:44,091 --> 00:53:47,009
We're not friends.
We never were.

890
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,312
Boy, we had some times,
didn't we, D?

891
00:53:49,346 --> 00:53:50,813
You was a wild man.

892
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:51,981
You remember that night?

893
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:54,600
'Cause I do,
for the last 15 years.

894
00:53:54,685 --> 00:53:56,018
You put yourself
in that prison, not me.

895
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:58,604
-You shot that guy.
-The way I remember it,

896
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:00,389
you was supposed to have
my back that night.

897
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,909
-That was the deal.
-I told you I wasn't coming.

898
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,493
I told you I was done
with all of that.

899
00:54:04,528 --> 00:54:07,029
No. The way I see it,

900
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,331
you owe me.

901
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,284
What're you talking about?

902
00:54:11,368 --> 00:54:12,952
I could've turned
you in that night

903
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,254
And you'd have spent
the last 15 years

904
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,923
in a cell next to me.

905
00:54:17,007 --> 00:54:18,925
So that's what
this is all about?

906
00:54:19,009 --> 00:54:20,042
You're trying
to shake me down

907
00:54:20,093 --> 00:54:21,677
for something that happened
when I was a kid?

908
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:23,412
Something
I didn't even do?

909
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,514
You're wasting
your time.

910
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:27,466
Well, you gotta
ask yourself, D.

911
00:54:27,551 --> 00:54:30,386
What would all your
God-fearing neighbors think

912
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:32,438
<i>if those type
of rumors got around?</i>

913
00:54:32,522 --> 00:54:34,190
I say that's gotta
be worth something.

914
00:54:34,224 --> 00:54:35,725
<i>50 thousand?</i>

915
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,092
What do you say?

916
00:54:37,144 --> 00:54:39,145
Even if I was willing
to pay you off,

917
00:54:39,229 --> 00:54:41,764
which I'm not,

918
00:54:41,815 --> 00:54:42,982
I don't have
that kind of money.

919
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:45,034
Yeah, but your
pretty boss does.

920
00:54:45,068 --> 00:54:46,319
I see you riding.

921
00:54:46,403 --> 00:54:47,870
I've been watching you two

922
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:49,405
getting all cozy.

923
00:54:49,456 --> 00:54:51,490
She wouldn't mind selling
a couple horses

924
00:54:51,575 --> 00:54:53,492
to help you out.

925
00:54:53,577 --> 00:54:55,127
We're done talking.

926
00:54:55,212 --> 00:54:58,130
You know what? Maybe you
better look at it another way.

927
00:54:58,215 --> 00:55:00,416
<i>Don't look at this
as a pay-off.</i>

928
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:03,669
Maybe you should look
at this as health insurance.

929
00:55:03,754 --> 00:55:05,888
To ensure that
nobody gets hurt.

930
00:55:12,562 --> 00:55:15,014
You get off of this ranch
and never come back.

931
00:55:40,112 --> 00:55:41,246
<i>A person
would have to be a fool</i>

932
00:55:41,314 --> 00:55:43,615
<i>to sell a place like this.</i>

933
00:55:43,666 --> 00:55:44,950
<i>It makes me feel...</i>

934
00:55:46,953 --> 00:55:48,152
<i>I don't know...</i>

935
00:55:48,204 --> 00:55:49,704
<i>Connected?</i>

936
00:55:49,789 --> 00:55:50,705
<i>-No way.
-No, yeah.</i>

937
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,457
<i>Exactly.
It's like,</i>

938
00:55:52,508 --> 00:55:55,544
<i>you feel you're part of something
bigger than you, right?</i>

939
00:56:30,963 --> 00:56:32,497
Neat.

940
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,877
They're a little excited.

941
00:56:56,155 --> 00:56:57,739
Hey, nice hat.

942
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,193
Hi!

943
00:57:05,448 --> 00:57:06,448
Hey.

944
00:57:06,532 --> 00:57:08,566
All right.
How you doing today?

945
00:57:08,618 --> 00:57:09,668
Good!

946
00:57:09,702 --> 00:57:11,586
<i>-You guys happy?
-Yeah!</i>

947
00:57:11,671 --> 00:57:13,872
<i>-Yeah, who wants to go on a ride?
-Me!</i>

948
00:57:13,923 --> 00:57:14,873
Let's go there.

949
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:19,678
<i>Just follow
the ladies. There you go.</i>

950
00:57:22,381 --> 00:57:23,548
<i>Thank you.</i>

951
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:01,219
<i>So they
might not look pretty,</i>

952
00:58:01,253 --> 00:58:03,254
<i>but they sure taste good.</i>

953
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:05,674
All right, guys.
Go wild.

954
00:58:08,394 --> 00:58:09,844
Hey, this is
a great thing

955
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:12,013
you're doing here.

956
00:58:12,098 --> 00:58:14,566
I couldn't have
done it without you.

957
00:58:31,117 --> 00:58:32,951
Hey.

958
00:58:33,002 --> 00:58:34,252
Wanna give it a shot?

959
00:58:35,788 --> 00:58:37,622
Nah, I'm good.

960
00:58:39,959 --> 00:58:41,292
Let me guess...

961
00:58:41,343 --> 00:58:44,162
they said, "All the fresh
air will do you good",

962
00:58:44,213 --> 00:58:47,015
but everything just
smells weird, right?

963
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,967
Can you do me a favor?

964
00:58:49,018 --> 00:58:50,001
Go be someone else's
best friend.

965
00:58:50,052 --> 00:58:51,669
<i>I'm doing just fine.</i>

966
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:53,004
First time I came here,

967
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,355
I held my nose
for two days.

968
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,940
Can you believe that?

969
00:58:57,309 --> 00:58:58,977
And at night... gosh.

970
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:01,062
At night, it's so silent

971
00:59:01,147 --> 00:59:02,781
It's like you can
hear the grass grow.

972
00:59:04,483 --> 00:59:06,985
I thought I was
gonna go crazy.

973
00:59:08,654 --> 00:59:09,738
When I was your age,

974
00:59:09,822 --> 00:59:12,791
I used to live
in the city.

975
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:14,242
Basically, I grew up
being tossed

976
00:59:14,326 --> 00:59:16,961
from foster home
to foster home.

977
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:20,832
For whatever reason,
life just kept

978
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:22,333
kicking me around...

979
00:59:24,837 --> 00:59:27,038
'til I came here.

980
00:59:28,507 --> 00:59:31,392
And after I held
my nose for two days,

981
00:59:31,477 --> 00:59:33,645
I finally allowed
myself to just...

982
00:59:35,514 --> 00:59:37,682
try it.

983
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:40,652
A new life grabbed me

984
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:44,189
and I grabbed it back.

985
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,741
City slicker turned...
Turned tree-hugger?

986
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,779
Must be my genes.

987
00:59:50,863 --> 00:59:52,197
That's cool.

988
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:55,667
I'm Derek, by the way.

989
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:57,168
Danny.

990
00:59:57,203 --> 00:59:58,503
<i>Great
to meet you, man.</i>

991
00:59:58,537 --> 01:00:00,738
<i>Yeah,
nice to meet you, too.</i>

992
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,842
One day, you'll find it.

993
01:00:03,876 --> 01:00:05,627
Just be open, man.

994
01:00:20,943 --> 01:00:22,093
<i>Hey.</i>

995
01:00:22,144 --> 01:00:23,645
Hey.

996
01:00:25,231 --> 01:00:27,482
<i>The kids are all asleep.</i>

997
01:00:28,734 --> 01:00:31,536
It was a big day,
I bet they're super tired.

998
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:35,657
You know,
the counselors all said

999
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:37,959
Danny never
talks to anyone.

1000
01:00:38,043 --> 01:00:40,995
He just...
sits by himself.

1001
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:46,668
But he talks to you.

1002
01:00:46,752 --> 01:00:49,671
Well, I used to be
just like him.

1003
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:54,058
What do you mean?

1004
01:00:54,093 --> 01:00:56,144
That's the thing
I don't like to talk about.

1005
01:00:58,564 --> 01:01:01,099
You brought it up.

1006
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:12,443
When my biological mother
brought me to this country,

1007
01:01:12,494 --> 01:01:14,612
she gave me up for adoption.

1008
01:01:17,366 --> 01:01:20,668
So I guess I grew up
in the city as a...

1009
01:01:20,753 --> 01:01:22,871
an angry kid.

1010
01:01:22,955 --> 01:01:25,506
I don't know.
I would...

1011
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:27,175
I would steal
things I didn't want.

1012
01:01:27,259 --> 01:01:30,261
I would hurt people
I didn't know.

1013
01:01:30,296 --> 01:01:32,764
Just this dumb kid running
straight to the cliff,

1014
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:35,133
not caring how far I'd fall...

1015
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,973
until I met my true mother.

1016
01:01:42,024 --> 01:01:44,675
June.

1017
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:47,195
She never lost her faith.

1018
01:01:49,782 --> 01:01:51,566
And that's when
she brought you here.

1019
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,735
To Valentine.

1020
01:01:53,819 --> 01:01:56,704
That night she told me,
she said, "We're going home."

1021
01:01:59,124 --> 01:02:00,992
I didn't know what
she was talking about.

1022
01:02:01,043 --> 01:02:04,329
"Home"?
What is that?

1023
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,050
The city was the only
home I ever knew.

1024
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:11,085
But the look on her face,

1025
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:15,506
I realized she wasn't
gonna give up on me.

1026
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:19,010
Somehow, she believed

1027
01:02:19,061 --> 01:02:21,813
I could be a son
to be proud of.

1028
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:29,988
I couldn't
hurt her anymore.

1029
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:35,326
That night, I was
supposed to meet someone.

1030
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:37,946
We were gonna,
I don't know,

1031
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,282
break into this
warehouse, whatever.

1032
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:43,284
So I call him,
I tell him...

1033
01:02:43,369 --> 01:02:45,286
I tell him I wasn't going.

1034
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:47,922
But he did it anyway.

1035
01:02:48,007 --> 01:02:52,260
It turns out, there was someone
working late that night.

1036
01:02:52,344 --> 01:02:53,928
And this guy shot him.

1037
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:57,181
And he went
to prison for it.

1038
01:03:00,886 --> 01:03:02,770
Derek.

1039
01:03:02,855 --> 01:03:07,475
Whoever you were,
whatever you did,

1040
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:10,228
that's all behind you now.

1041
01:03:26,078 --> 01:03:27,829
-Derek.
-The man with the scar,

1042
01:03:27,913 --> 01:03:30,048
his name is Ray Lizzaro.

1043
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:31,949
He spent his
last 15 years in jail

1044
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:34,335
and he still blames me
'cause I wasn't there.

1045
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:38,673
What does he want?

1046
01:03:38,757 --> 01:03:40,675
It doesn't matter
what he wants.

1047
01:03:42,644 --> 01:03:44,345
Look, Kennedy.

1048
01:03:45,764 --> 01:03:49,767
June and the Circle Cross

1049
01:03:49,818 --> 01:03:51,652
saved my life.

1050
01:03:52,938 --> 01:03:57,191
That's all that matters.

1051
01:03:57,276 --> 01:04:01,696
I never told this
to anyone.

1052
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,248
I'm glad you're
telling me.

1053
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:24,018
The kids.

1054
01:04:24,103 --> 01:04:25,470
The kids.

1055
01:04:35,647 --> 01:04:36,948
All right.

1056
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:41,319
Come and get it.

1057
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,353
Grab your plates.

1058
01:04:42,404 --> 01:04:44,205
All right.
Who's first?

1059
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:46,074
There you go.

1060
01:04:46,158 --> 01:04:47,458
It's over here
if you want to bring...

1061
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:51,045
<i>Watch out.</i>

1062
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:53,881
-It's hot, guys.
-Got your eggs?

1063
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:57,835
There you go.

1064
01:05:10,766 --> 01:05:13,484
All right, everybody.
Group photo!

1065
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:15,436
Come on in.

1066
01:05:15,521 --> 01:05:17,271
Come on.

1067
01:05:17,356 --> 01:05:19,440
All right.

1068
01:05:19,525 --> 01:05:20,758
Hey, Danny.

1069
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:25,163
Everyone.

1070
01:05:27,082 --> 01:05:29,584
All right.
One, two, three.

1071
01:05:29,668 --> 01:05:32,036
-Cheese!
-Banana!

1072
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:21,618
<i>The first thing I wanna do</i>

1073
01:06:21,652 --> 01:06:23,953
is take a long,
hot shower.

1074
01:06:23,988 --> 01:06:26,656
I smell like a campfire.

1075
01:06:26,707 --> 01:06:29,742
You know, I like
the smell of campfire.

1076
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:32,462
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

1077
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:36,416
Steve.

1078
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,917
You're a real cowgirl, now.

1079
01:06:38,002 --> 01:06:39,201
What're you
doing here?

1080
01:06:39,253 --> 01:06:41,254
Well, I've been
calling and texting.

1081
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:43,339
<i>I mean, I haven't
heard from you in days.</i>

1082
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,757
I was beginning to worry.

1083
01:06:44,842 --> 01:06:48,728
We were camping with
some kids from the city.

1084
01:06:48,812 --> 01:06:50,146
<i>I turned off my phone.</i>

1085
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,981
Just as long as you're okay.

1086
01:06:52,016 --> 01:06:54,817
And besides,

1087
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:56,185
I missed you.

1088
01:06:59,523 --> 01:07:00,940
This is Derek Sterling.

1089
01:07:01,025 --> 01:07:02,408
<i>Derek, Steve Marrin.</i>

1090
01:07:02,493 --> 01:07:04,861
You must be the cowboy
I heard so much about.

1091
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:06,279
<i>Thanks for taking
such good care of her.</i>

1092
01:07:06,363 --> 01:07:07,830
<i>Just doing my job.</i>

1093
01:07:13,003 --> 01:07:14,370
<i>Thank you.</i>

1094
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,542
Nice meeting you.

1095
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:35,224
I think we should talk.

1096
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:34,984
<i>Where's your friend?</i>

1097
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:37,370
On his way back
to California.

1098
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,090
That's too bad.

1099
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:42,425
Look, I should've
seen it coming.

1100
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:43,993
-Steve's a nice...
-Look, it's too bad

1101
01:08:44,044 --> 01:08:45,995
because this, you and me,

1102
01:08:46,046 --> 01:08:48,297
whatever this is,
it's not gonna work.

1103
01:08:49,633 --> 01:08:50,600
What?

1104
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:51,634
Look, I'm really happy

1105
01:08:51,685 --> 01:08:53,219
with all the good things
you wanna do here,

1106
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:55,555
and I'm gonna help you
in any way I can,

1107
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:58,558
but you're a lawyer.

1108
01:08:58,642 --> 01:09:01,060
I'm a... ranch hand.

1109
01:09:01,145 --> 01:09:03,196
You're a wealthy girl,

1110
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,698
I'm your employee.

1111
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:09,318
This ranch is the only
thing we have in common.

1112
01:09:09,369 --> 01:09:10,570
You have a really
important life

1113
01:09:10,654 --> 01:09:12,872
outside of all
of this, I know.

1114
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:16,859
This is all I have.

1115
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,294
All I got.

1116
01:09:20,464 --> 01:09:21,964
All I want.

1117
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:29,639
So, let's just...

1118
01:09:29,673 --> 01:09:31,641
let's just forget about it.

1119
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,459
Talbot, you're working late.

1120
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:08,177
<i>Looks like
your cowboy friend</i>

1121
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:09,745
<i>knew what he was
talking about.</i>

1122
01:10:09,813 --> 01:10:13,082
Circle Cross has been
making money all along.

1123
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:17,303
<i>And Smith Blaine has been
skimming for a long time.</i>

1124
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:18,587
How'd he do it?

1125
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:21,724
Some months he double-billed
for his time.

1126
01:10:21,775 --> 01:10:24,110
<i>He took commissions
on horse sales</i>

1127
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:25,444
<i>that never happened.</i>

1128
01:10:25,529 --> 01:10:28,114
<i>Inflated the tax bill,
pocketing the difference.</i>

1129
01:10:28,198 --> 01:10:30,283
So much for family ties.

1130
01:10:30,367 --> 01:10:32,068
<i>Those offers
for the ranch?</i>

1131
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:35,822
They're coming from a big
development company in Denver.

1132
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:37,790
Development?

1133
01:10:37,875 --> 01:10:39,408
And guess who's
on their payroll?

1134
01:10:52,339 --> 01:10:54,423
You can't do this.

1135
01:10:54,474 --> 01:10:55,725
I just did.

1136
01:10:55,759 --> 01:10:58,294
My lawyer's drafting the
letter to make it official.

1137
01:10:58,362 --> 01:11:01,130
But I wanted to tell you
myself, in person,

1138
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:02,999
you're fired.

1139
01:11:04,268 --> 01:11:05,985
You know, I worked
for your father

1140
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,687
for over five years.

1141
01:11:07,771 --> 01:11:09,822
I gave him
a complete set of records

1142
01:11:09,907 --> 01:11:11,657
of everything I did.

1143
01:11:11,742 --> 01:11:13,659
<i>You stfrom him
for five years,</i>

1144
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:15,344
and those records are proof.

1145
01:11:15,412 --> 01:11:16,996
That's ridiculous.

1146
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,998
Derek kept his own records
of the ranch.

1147
01:11:19,082 --> 01:11:21,650
We can document every penny
you put in your pocket.

1148
01:11:21,702 --> 01:11:23,502
You're gonna take the word
of some ranch hand?

1149
01:11:23,587 --> 01:11:25,204
I trust
that ranch hand

1150
01:11:25,289 --> 01:11:27,206
a lot more than
I could ever trust you.

1151
01:11:27,291 --> 01:11:28,875
This isn't over, Kennedy.

1152
01:11:28,959 --> 01:11:32,428
You're right,
there's one more thing.

1153
01:11:32,462 --> 01:11:35,548
You have 30 days to pay back
the money you stole,

1154
01:11:35,632 --> 01:11:37,433
or I'll press charges.

1155
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:40,303
You're fooling yourself,
you know.

1156
01:11:40,354 --> 01:11:42,605
That ranch is
a thing of the past.

1157
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:44,340
<i>Sooner or later,
it'll start losing money.</i>

1158
01:11:44,391 --> 01:11:45,674
<i>They all do.</i>

1159
01:11:45,726 --> 01:11:48,060
Be smart, Kennedy.

1160
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:51,564
Take the offer
before it's too late.

1161
01:11:51,648 --> 01:11:54,367
You can tear up that offer,

1162
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:55,735
along with any other.

1163
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:59,121
Because the Circle Cross
is not for sale.

1164
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:01,791
30 days.

1165
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:45,001
Hi, I'm looking
for Robin Donovan.

1166
01:12:46,336 --> 01:12:47,703
Thank you.

1167
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:53,042
<i>Robin.</i>

1168
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:55,294
-Kennedy.
-Hello.

1169
01:12:55,379 --> 01:12:57,263
I have been meaning
to catch up with you.

1170
01:12:57,347 --> 01:12:58,631
How's everything
at the ranch?

1171
01:12:58,715 --> 01:12:59,966
Good. Yeah.

1172
01:13:00,050 --> 01:13:00,967
That's,

1173
01:13:01,051 --> 01:13:02,551
that's actually
why I'm here.

1174
01:13:02,602 --> 01:13:05,304
Is there somewhere
we can talk privately?

1175
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:07,589
Sure. This way.

1176
01:13:50,017 --> 01:13:51,133
What?

1177
01:13:51,201 --> 01:13:52,685
Pardon me, Mr. Morgan.

1178
01:13:52,769 --> 01:13:54,353
Smith Blaine is here.

1179
01:13:54,438 --> 01:13:56,238
He says it's important.

1180
01:13:56,273 --> 01:13:58,691
Another visitor
from the Blaine family.

1181
01:13:58,775 --> 01:14:00,409
I must be living right.

1182
01:14:02,112 --> 01:14:04,663
Well, what do you want?

1183
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:10,669
Well, this part
of the country

1184
01:14:10,754 --> 01:14:13,172
used to be covered
by tall grass prairie,

1185
01:14:13,256 --> 01:14:14,840
most of which
was farmed under.

1186
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:17,543
The National Register
wants to preserve what's left.

1187
01:14:17,627 --> 01:14:19,011
I went to see
Robin Donovan

1188
01:14:19,096 --> 01:14:21,514
and she explained it to me.

1189
01:14:21,598 --> 01:14:23,516
Basically,
the National Register

1190
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,217
works with state societies

1191
01:14:25,302 --> 01:14:28,003
to find places with
historic significance

1192
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:29,889
so they can preserve them.

1193
01:14:29,973 --> 01:14:31,390
And they think that
the Circle Cross

1194
01:14:31,475 --> 01:14:32,725
<i>hashistoricsignificance?</i>

1195
01:14:32,809 --> 01:14:36,228
I mean, with the cemetery,
and the wagon trail,

1196
01:14:36,313 --> 01:14:38,981
and all those other stories,
there's no question.

1197
01:14:39,032 --> 01:14:41,901
So the whole ranch would be
on the National Register?

1198
01:14:41,985 --> 01:14:45,037
Yeah, I mean, there's
still some paperwork.

1199
01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:47,740
And, you know, some hoops
to jump through.

1200
01:14:47,824 --> 01:14:49,241
But Robin thinks
we have a real shot.

1201
01:14:50,794 --> 01:14:52,545
So, if they do
want the ranch,

1202
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:55,664
then, how soon
would we have to move?

1203
01:14:58,635 --> 01:15:00,669
You won't have to move.

1204
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:03,005
See, that's the whole point.

1205
01:15:03,056 --> 01:15:07,393
The ranch will go on
with you and Derek

1206
01:15:07,477 --> 01:15:09,061
just the way it is.

1207
01:15:09,146 --> 01:15:10,312
In perpetuity.

1208
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:15,434
But, according to this,

1209
01:15:15,519 --> 01:15:17,653
<i>it also means you can
neversell the ranch.</i>

1210
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:22,324
I mean, it's a lot of money
to be giving up.

1211
01:15:23,527 --> 01:15:25,327
"A person would have
to be a fool

1212
01:15:25,362 --> 01:15:28,164
to sell a place like this."

1213
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:32,751
Thank you.

1214
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:34,453
<i>Thank you.</i>

1215
01:15:39,543 --> 01:15:41,293
Thank you.

1216
01:16:06,736 --> 01:16:08,454
Come on, Wilson.

1217
01:16:10,824 --> 01:16:12,408
Okay.

1218
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:21,884
Derek?

1219
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:29,225
No!

1220
01:16:29,259 --> 01:16:31,343
Don't make a move.

1221
01:16:53,283 --> 01:16:54,500
Hey, Derek.

1222
01:16:54,584 --> 01:16:56,869
Hey, I think something's
going on with Wilson.

1223
01:16:56,953 --> 01:16:58,337
He's barking like crazy.

1224
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:20,359
Kennedy!

1225
01:17:21,895 --> 01:17:23,195
Wilson!

1226
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:27,533
What's wrong, boy?
What's...

1227
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:39,528
<i>Hey, just like
old times, D?</i>

1228
01:17:39,579 --> 01:17:41,664
I give the orders,
you follow.

1229
01:17:41,715 --> 01:17:43,532
You let her go, okay?

1230
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,200
Sure thing, D.

1231
01:17:45,268 --> 01:17:47,102
But first I'm gonna need
some traveling money.

1232
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,054
You know, the figure
we discussed.

1233
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:51,557
<i>And I figure, you being
the ranch foreman,</i>

1234
01:17:51,641 --> 01:17:53,926
you got access to cash
just in case of emergency.

1235
01:17:54,010 --> 01:17:55,728
-Look, listen to me...
-No, you listen to me!

1236
01:17:55,812 --> 01:17:57,713
You know me,
and you know what I can do.

1237
01:17:57,764 --> 01:17:58,897
<i>So don't be stupid.</i>

1238
01:17:58,982 --> 01:18:00,649
<i>Get the money.
No cops.</i>

1239
01:18:00,684 --> 01:18:03,686
And meet me back at the
lake house in one hour.

1240
01:18:03,737 --> 01:18:05,771
Lizzaro, I...

1241
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,778
Boy, look.
Find her, okay?

1242
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:15,614
Let's go.
Let's go. Find her.

1243
01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:18,000
Let's go, boy.
Go, Wilson.

1244
01:18:52,285 --> 01:18:53,986
Help!

1245
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:55,504
Somebody help me!

1246
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:02,328
Somebody!

1247
01:19:03,413 --> 01:19:05,247
Somebody help!
Please!

1248
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:35,911
<i>-Kennedy!
-Derek?</i>

1249
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:44,370
15 years I sat in
that prison 'cause of you.

1250
01:19:44,454 --> 01:19:46,372
You owe me.

1251
01:19:46,456 --> 01:19:48,290
And if I can't
get paid one way,

1252
01:19:48,341 --> 01:19:50,325
then I get paid
another way.

1253
01:19:50,377 --> 01:19:51,927
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

1254
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:54,546
Please.
Please.

1255
01:19:54,631 --> 01:19:56,832
-You don't have to do this.
-Shut up.

1256
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:58,384
I got nothing to lose,

1257
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:00,052
but you do.

1258
01:20:26,579 --> 01:20:28,997
Get him off me!

1259
01:20:30,633 --> 01:20:33,585
<i>Get him off me!
Okay! All right!</i>

1260
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:35,387
<i>-Get him off me!
-Please be okay.</i>

1261
01:20:36,723 --> 01:20:39,091
<i>Get him off me!
Okay! All right!</i>

1262
01:20:39,175 --> 01:20:40,509
<i>Get him off me!</i>

1263
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,011
<i>Get him off me!</i>

1264
01:20:55,658 --> 01:20:57,242
You're sure you're okay?

1265
01:20:57,327 --> 01:20:59,361
Yeah, I think so.

1266
01:20:59,412 --> 01:21:01,697
I'm so sorry.

1267
01:21:01,748 --> 01:21:03,999
<i>-Hey, it wasn't your fault.
-Itwasmy fault.</i>

1268
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:05,784
Okay? I should've
known Lizzaro

1269
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:07,703
wouldn't just let it go.

1270
01:21:09,422 --> 01:21:12,291
<i>Do you think
we've seen the last of him?</i>

1271
01:21:12,375 --> 01:21:14,293
They said he's going
right back to prison.

1272
01:21:15,595 --> 01:21:18,180
This time for good.

1273
01:21:45,074 --> 01:21:48,076
You've been stirring up
quite a hornet's nest

1274
01:21:48,144 --> 01:21:49,678
<i>around here lately.</i>

1275
01:21:49,746 --> 01:21:53,782
<i>Coming into town,
moving onto the ranch.</i>

1276
01:21:53,833 --> 01:21:56,502
Going on about
the National Register.

1277
01:21:57,887 --> 01:21:59,922
You seem to know
an awful lot about me.

1278
01:21:59,973 --> 01:22:03,509
I know an awful lot
about everything.

1279
01:22:03,593 --> 01:22:06,011
That's what comes with
spending your whole life

1280
01:22:06,095 --> 01:22:07,563
<i>in one town.</i>

1281
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:10,315
What do you want?

1282
01:22:16,856 --> 01:22:19,157
<i>Smith Blaine came
to see me the other day.</i>

1283
01:22:19,242 --> 01:22:21,643
<i>I haven't talked
to him in years.</i>

1284
01:22:21,694 --> 01:22:26,031
<i>All of a sudden he's got
this proposition for me.</i>

1285
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:28,834
What kind of proposition?

1286
01:22:28,918 --> 01:22:30,836
Well, he wants me
to team up with him

1287
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,622
to contest your inheritance.

1288
01:22:33,673 --> 01:22:36,375
<i>Figures he can
tie it up in court.</i>

1289
01:22:36,459 --> 01:22:38,293
<i>Wear you down.</i>

1290
01:22:38,344 --> 01:22:43,048
Eventually build that little
golf course of his, after all.

1291
01:22:43,132 --> 01:22:45,634
<i>Offered me 30% ownership.</i>

1292
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:48,770
What'd you say?

1293
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,642
I told him I don't
do business with Blaines.

1294
01:22:53,693 --> 01:22:56,344
<i>Never have, never will.</i>

1295
01:22:56,396 --> 01:22:58,063
Besides, the man's a crook.

1296
01:22:58,147 --> 01:22:59,815
Yeah, I know.

1297
01:23:01,034 --> 01:23:02,484
I fired him.

1298
01:23:02,535 --> 01:23:04,236
Good for you.

1299
01:23:09,959 --> 01:23:12,711
Never came to see us.

1300
01:23:12,795 --> 01:23:16,248
Never called,
never wrote.

1301
01:23:19,002 --> 01:23:21,303
Didn't you ever, once...

1302
01:23:22,505 --> 01:23:24,506
just want to know me?

1303
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:27,476
I told your mother
when she left.

1304
01:23:29,846 --> 01:23:31,546
It was a Blaine.

1305
01:23:31,598 --> 01:23:33,381
And she was a Morgan.

1306
01:23:33,433 --> 01:23:35,267
<i>Did you really think
she was gonna let</i>

1307
01:23:35,351 --> 01:23:36,718
<i>somebody else
tell her what to do?</i>

1308
01:23:36,769 --> 01:23:39,071
How to live her life?

1309
01:23:41,107 --> 01:23:42,524
Did she ever forgive me?

1310
01:23:45,578 --> 01:23:46,695
She did.

1311
01:23:46,746 --> 01:23:48,614
<i>Over time.</i>

1312
01:23:51,668 --> 01:23:53,919
But I think it would
mean more to her now

1313
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,470
<i>if you forgave you</i>

1314
01:23:57,757 --> 01:24:00,559
You always tell yourself
there's plenty of time.

1315
01:24:03,563 --> 01:24:06,231
But time goes by so fast.

1316
01:24:08,267 --> 01:24:10,102
Don't ever put
things off, girl.

1317
01:24:10,153 --> 01:24:13,572
<i>Don't ever wait to say
what needs to be said.</i>

1318
01:24:18,027 --> 01:24:21,246
You're as beautiful
as she was.

1319
01:24:26,252 --> 01:24:29,254
Well, well, well.

1320
01:24:39,349 --> 01:24:41,550
Wait.

1321
01:24:41,634 --> 01:24:43,668
Wait.

1322
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,103
What's this?

1323
01:24:50,309 --> 01:24:54,863
My God.

1324
01:24:54,947 --> 01:24:55,897
Look at that.

1325
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:04,656
Thank you, Kennedy.

1326
01:25:06,292 --> 01:25:08,877
I don't know
what to call you.

1327
01:25:08,961 --> 01:25:10,746
Call me?

1328
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:14,082
You might try
hard-nosed old coot.

1329
01:25:18,304 --> 01:25:21,973
Or you can
call me Grandfather.

1330
01:25:23,509 --> 01:25:24,643
Grandfather.

1331
01:25:26,846 --> 01:25:29,181
I like that.

1332
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:40,442
Hey, buddy.
Hey.

1333
01:25:40,526 --> 01:25:41,827
Hey.

1334
01:25:44,614 --> 01:25:46,615
Thank you.

1335
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:48,834
Thank you for
saving her, okay?

1336
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:58,710
Derek?

1337
01:26:11,641 --> 01:26:15,760
You were right.
The other day.

1338
01:26:15,812 --> 01:26:18,313
We come from different worlds

1339
01:26:18,397 --> 01:26:20,932
and the lives we've lead up to
now couldn't be further apart,

1340
01:26:20,983 --> 01:26:22,651
but they lead us here.

1341
01:26:22,735 --> 01:26:24,319
Now.

1342
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:26,822
All those things you said
would drive us apart

1343
01:26:26,906 --> 01:26:29,040
are the same things
that brought us together.

1344
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:33,995
-This isn't your life, Ke...
-Being here with you?

1345
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:38,633
This is what I want
my life to be.

1346
01:26:40,586 --> 01:26:43,638
This is where I belong,

1347
01:26:43,723 --> 01:26:46,224
and I'm not going anywhere.

1348
01:27:23,129 --> 01:27:24,346
<i>There you go!</i>

1349
01:27:25,932 --> 01:27:27,132
Well done!

1350
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:35,440
I'm proud of you.

1351
01:27:39,145 --> 01:27:41,279
Look at that.

1352
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,280
