00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,445
I CAN'T TELEPORT OUT OF HERE!

486
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,281
MADELINE HATTER:
MAYBE IT'S PART OF THE CURSE.

487
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,573
LIZZIE HEARTS:
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

488
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,575
WE'LL ALL BE AT THE PALACE
SOON ENOUGH.

489
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,286
ONCE WE GET TO THE VICE
PRINCIPAL

490
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,247
I'LL JUST EXPLAIN
OUR SITUATION.

491
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,583
AHEM. HOW LONG TILL
WE GET TO SCHOOL ANYWAY?

492
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:19,922
CHASE REDFORD:
IT'S NOT FAR TO THERE
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALREADY HERE.

MADELINE HATTER:
OF ALL THE DAYS,

496
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,720
WE JUST HAD TO COME HERE
ON SCHOOL DAY.

497
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,597
LIZZIE HEARTS:
SCHOOL OR NO SCHOOL,

498
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,475
YOU REALIZE
MY MOTHER IS THE QUEEN?

499
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,519
I DON'T HAVE TO STAY HERE.

500
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,730
COME ALONG MY FRIENDS.

501
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,233
AGH!
B-BUT... BUT...

502
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,610
CHASE REDFORD:
SORRY, MA'AM, BUT YOU'RE
ON SCHOOL GROUNDS NOW.

503
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,361
YOU FOLLOW SCHOOL RULES.

504
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,072
AND NONE OF YOU
IS GOING ANYWHERE

505
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,740
UNTIL YOU GRADUATE!
