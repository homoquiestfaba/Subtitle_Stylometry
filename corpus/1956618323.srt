1
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,705
OCEAN:
Since I was the last
of eight children,

2
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,076
my father overruled
my mother and named me
after God's best miracle,

3
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,011
the ocean.

4
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,823
My name's supposed
to mean endless possibility

5
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,891
like the ocean, but...

6
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,693
But much of my life,

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,829
I didn't really have
much possible.

8
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,732
And sometimes,

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm not sure
I got any ability.

10
00:01:09,437 --> 00:01:10,638
But today,

11
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:15,209
I'm trying to live like
Daddy always said,

12
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:19,313
"Make any new day
your best day."

13
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,117
I'm Ocean Jackson
and this is the
diary of a single mom

14
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,419
trying to get
ahead in the world

15
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,288
trying to hold her under.

16
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,095
Yeah, baby, you're gonna
make my life a lot easier.

17
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,831
Here, maybe you
should try it.

18
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,437
Apartment needs
a little work.

19
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,207
But then again, I hear
your father taught you
to fix any that's broke.

20
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:48,276
Maybe you can fix me.

21
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,110
Wow!

22
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:53,281
A little paint, bleach,
elbow grease...

23
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,916
This is a beautiful arch.

24
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,985
Yeah, it ain't beautiful
how they left the place.

25
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,453
Kids, go check it out.

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,455
Why is there a gas grill
in the living room?

27
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,157
BUDDY: It's probably stolen.

28
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:05,092
Look, I got some new
tenants moving in today.

29
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,727
It's all written
down for you.

30
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,462
So there you go!

31
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,865
Um, you got some
good-looking kids.

32
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,068
Then again,
you're a good-
looking woman.

33
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,571
And Ocean,
I like that name.

34
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,807
Which one you named after,
the Pacific or Atlantic?

35
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,008
Both.
Oh, I like that.

36
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,377
Mister...
Buddy, call me Buddy.

37
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,712
LUPE: Buddy Chase!

38
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,614
Buddy Chase,
are you in there?

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,750
I've been leaving you
messages for weeks.

40
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,887
I got leak city upstairs,
under my sink, my shower,

41
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,756
outlets don't work,

42
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,525
Ocean meet second
floor's Lupe Ramirez...
Okay, no, no!

43
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,428
Don't try and distract
me because I need
you to do your job, mister...

44
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,563
Ocean Jackson.

45
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,233
New apartment manager
and onsite repair person.

46
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,601
Oh, hell no.
She's a woman.

47
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,970
Oh, hell no,
how did
that happen

48
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:52,840
Girl, I don't
mean no offense,

49
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,509
but Tricky Dick, here,
like to play Houdini

50
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,111
and I'm sick of his
disappearing act.

51
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,913
'Cause it don't
scare me to move.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,750
Move, Lupe. See who else
will put up with you
coming up short every month.

53
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,254
All right, listen.
Deposit slips
are in there,

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,989
any information you need,
it's in there,
contact numbers...

55
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:11,058
If you need anything else,
give me a call. Hello.

56
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,926
Whoa, whoa! Hold on.
What about my...

57
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:16,264
You know what?
I ain't through with
you Mr. Buddy Chase.

58
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,331
Mommy!

59
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,701
We measured and according
to my computations

60
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:23,971
we've gained approximately
270 square feet
of more living space

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,038
than what we
had at Grandma's.

62
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,675
Um, he's a genius
or something?

63
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,912
Sort of, he's on scholarship
at the Kennedy Academy
for the gifted,

64
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:34,748
so to be there,
you got to, kind of,
be a genius.

65
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,384
Mine can't even
spell genius.

66
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,688
Yes I can! J-E-E-N-U-S.

67
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,590
See, just like his daddy.

68
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,827
Okay, speaking of the devil.
Come on baby, let's go.
Hurry up, hurry up.

69
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:51,799
Go on.

70
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,940
LUPE: J.J., you and Sophie
just stay right here,

71
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,875
I'm gonna be
right back, all right?

72
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:04,778
Sophie, baby, don't cry,
I told you I was leaving

73
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,749
just play your video games.
Take care of your sister,
all right? I love you.

74
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:11,218
You know what?
You and your sister...

75
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,053
Mind Miss Ocean now.

76
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,688
Can I just go say hi to Dad?

77
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,357
Boy, I already told you, no.

78
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:19,259
If I don't go now,
there's no telling when I'm
gonna see your daddy again.

79
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,129
Girl, you know how it is.
Mama needs groceries.

80
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,231
Do I look okay?

81
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,268
Yeah, I already know my
breasts are my best feature

82
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:30,471
but I ain't bragging
about them.

83
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,074
You know how they say,
"God takes anything
you love too much."

84
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,044
LUPE: Juan, I'm coming!

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,880
Just so you know,
she won't be back
for a while.

86
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:42,616
Groceries, Sarah.

87
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,587
Come on,
let's go play.

88
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,172
Ian, please, Grandma
can't concentrate
with all that noise.

89
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:11,512
I didn't really read
the lease, so I don't
know what to put on.

90
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,381
Too many decisions.

91
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:15,949
How they could think

92
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,685
that this will make me
more independent.

93
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,853
If your Grandpa
Bill was here,
he'd have the...

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,758
Auntie said that whenever
you say Grandpa Bill's name,
I should shout, "He's dead!"

95
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:26,994
She said that?

96
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,031
What a bitch.

97
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,034
But you said Grandpa's
in heaven with my mommy
and Jesus, right?

98
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,437
That's right. Yeah.

99
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,544
I'm sorry, we're not
purchasing anything today.

100
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:46,647
My mom doesn't
wear much make-up.

101
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,916
Young man, do we look
like we're selling anything?

102
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:52,252
We're tenants.

103
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,455
Temporarily.

104
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,090
Oh! Well, come on in,
my mom's the manager.

105
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,738
Mom, Uncle Bo
and Trina's here.

106
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:20,548
So that's the bathroom
and you know...
Uh

107
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,416
A little paint
and a good cleaning...

108
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,919
Ah, baby, I know you,
you'll have this
place laid out.

109
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,756
I'm so proud
of you, Ocean.

110
00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:32,292
And I know your daddy's
is up there with his
chest poked out.

111
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:37,130
And you know that Trina
can help you in getting
this place together.

112
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:40,868
Oh, no, Uncle Bo.

113
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,204
I mean, this building,
my kids and trying to...

114
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,306
You've got a lot
of your father in you.

115
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,542
Straight and narrow,
no detours.

116
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,779
But if you live long enough
you'll find out that life has

117
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,947
got a whole
lot of detours,

118
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,783
especially when
it comes to family.

119
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,885
Every time my sister
decides her
child don't exist

120
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,953
and she got a new man,
I'm supposed to...

121
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,188
At least my mama's
got a man...

122
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,556
Stay out
of this, Trina.

123
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,625
She started it!
So I'm gonna finish it.

124
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:07,995
See? Now that's
a detour I can't take.

125
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,297
Keep her at mama and yours
because I...

126
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,332
I'm just not going
to put up with her mouth.

127
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,234
Baby...

128
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,003
Do this for your uncle.

129
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,541
Before I had my
little drinking problem,

130
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,511
didn't Uncle Bo
try to save you?

131
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:27,047
You know a whole
lot of those things
that you did, remember?

132
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,617
It was Uncle Bo
that kept it from your
mama and daddy.

133
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,052
I was the one
that told you that you
you were moving too fast.

134
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,489
And to stay away
from that fool you
ended up marrying.

135
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:38,458
But, Uncle Bo, she...
I'm trying to stay
sober, baby.

136
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,362
And God knows I am,
I mean, see?

137
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:45,165
Almost steady.

138
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,800
I'm not quite there yet.

139
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:51,739
But I really want to
keep Trina from going
down the same path.

140
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,141
She's already done
come home drunk once.

141
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,444
And I don't want
it to be twice.

142
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,814
She needs somebody stable.

143
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,483
Like you.

144
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,820
There ain't nobody
in our family more
stable than you, baby girl.

145
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,158
That you got
from your father.

146
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,595
But Uncle Bo
is hoping that...

147
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,064
You got your
heart from me.

148
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,913
She got to know that
in my house I got rules.

149
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,372
No, Ocean's
my mama's
baby sister.

150
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,473
Yeah.

151
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,643
But I hate her.
Oh my gosh!

152
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,812
And everybody
else in my family.

153
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,880
They all get
on my nerves.

154
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:09,583
Yeah, but at least
she's not a drug
like the rest of them.

155
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:20,393
I miss you, too.

156
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,097
OCEAN:
There are three families
that stay in the building.

157
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:34,501
But they always seem to
congregate in my apartment.

158
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,370
Uncle Bo says it's
because of my name.

159
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,673
Everybody wants
to swim in the ocean.

160
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,474
I guess.

161
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:45,445
All I know is together
we seem to stay afloat.

162
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,615
You don't know
how hard I've tried to
like Mike-the-right.

163
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:52,652
Oh, girl! You and
your baby daddies.

164
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,187
You should go check
on the babies.

165
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,989
LUPE: Oh, they're all right.
They sleep late.

166
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,590
Stupid dial up!

167
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,426
Froze right when
I was in the middle
of something important.

168
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,764
Oy, what're you doing
that's so important?

169
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,565
You're on this
thing every time...

170
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,401
Um, what are you doing
on FriendSpace?

171
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,503
Uh, it's for school.

172
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,239
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

173
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,875
I was thinking that if we
pooled our money together

174
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,110
we could get
a high-speed service...

175
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,779
Oh, I already got cable.

176
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:20,080
No, a modem!

177
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,716
So that you could study,
we could pay bills online,

178
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:24,752
operate our lives
a little better.

179
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,353
Operate my life
a little better

180
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:27,988
What?

181
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,257
LUPE: Coming!

182
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,094
Oh, Ian...

183
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,628
What are you doing to him?

184
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,597
Where's his clothes?
I washed them.

185
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:41,001
Oh, and I've been meaning
to give Ian some of the
clothes J.J.'s outgrown.

186
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,635
He will look so fly.

187
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,604
We don't need
your handouts.

188
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,539
And I didn't tell you
that you could come up
here to see these people.

189
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,941
Okay, hold on a minute!
Lupe!

190
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,442
Who the hell you
calling "these people"?

191
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,745
Because all we was trying
to do is help you out.

192
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,747
Lupe, Lupe!

193
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,348
MIKE: Hey, what's
all this hollering?

194
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:57,450
You know what? I'm about
to get Miss Avon straight.

195
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,086
You must be Sophie's dad.

196
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,921
You spit her right out.

197
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,690
Ian come on let's go.
LUPE: Yeah, this is Ocean,
she's the new manager.

198
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,292
Hi.

199
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,762
Nice to meet you.
Ocean? That's a fly name.

200
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,597
Where the kids?
Where's Sophie?
Next door.

201
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,766
Lupe, what'd I tell
you about leaving
my daughter alone?

202
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,735
Don't even start that
mess because you come
up here twice a month

203
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,871
and all you do is find fault
and I'm tired of it.

204
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,606
Look, if you don't want
to take care of her,
I said I will.

205
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,008
Ian let's go,
get your clothes later.

206
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,010
I take care of my baby.
What, you're gonna
come here twice...

207
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:30,784
OCEAN: Wonder If the floors
of single mothers are more
worn out than other floors.

208
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,854
I used to hear my mother
walk the floor at night.

209
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:36,756
Mumbling and humming...

210
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,226
Especially if one of us
hadn't made it home.

211
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,537
Auntie Ocean.

212
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,574
Girl,
don't have a heart attack.

213
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,444
Let me tell you just
what happened, there was...

214
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,481
There was just...
They wanted me to go
and I said no,

215
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,117
but when I left earlier we...

216
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,386
We was driving, right,
and we just...

217
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:11,324
We just got lost, like,
"Where are we going?"

218
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:18,431
Hmm, well, we got lost.
And I went and it
was so much fun.

219
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:22,002
I didn't do anything bad.
We got lost, though... Yeah.

220
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,233
You are better than this!

221
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,071
You hear me?

222
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,141
Yeah.

223
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,054
Peggy?

224
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
OCEAN: Peggy?

225
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,129
Hi.

226
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,732
I didn't mean any
harm today and I'm sorry

227
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,668
and if I'm overstepping,

228
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,806
we had leftovers and...

229
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,011
We don't need anything.

230
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,914
But take it anyway.

231
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,750
No.

232
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,720
I hope I'm not
overstepping again

233
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,091
but Lupe and I have
a proposal and, um,

234
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:54,861
we were thinking if we pool
our resources together
we can help each other.

235
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,434
Thank you.

236
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,438
She really called me Avon?

237
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,710
Don't worry I've
been called worse.

238
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,816
Okay, if, uh...
Thanks again.

239
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,086
I'm... All right.

240
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,642
I went to mass.

241
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:47,147
Okay, and maybe
a few other places.

242
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,088
Can I sleep here?

243
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,191
I just can't face
Mike-the-right tonight.

244
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,069
Maybe my kids will be
better off without me.

245
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:57,117
OCEAN: So maybe
finding a way
to love people...

246
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,694
...in the midst of
their struggles

247
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:13,166
is what we're all here for

248
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,968
and to raise these kids.

249
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,865
Work Source, this is, uh...
We develop your
mind and body.

250
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,868
This is Ocean Jackson,
how may I direct your call?

251
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,140
Uh, please hold.

252
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,709
Just a little
setback, Ocean.

253
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,213
Having a little bit
of dyslexia is like...

254
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,382
Like having
a little bit of stupid.

255
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,318
You're not stupid, Mommy.

256
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:41,087
Aw, baby.
She's right.

257
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,691
You're so close.
Little more practice,
more computer time...

258
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:46,559
I practice at my desk.

259
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,262
But between
the phones,
Kayla and...

260
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:51,631
Yeah, well, some of
the staff thinks that, uh,

261
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:55,935
to be fair, maybe it's time
to enroll her in daycare
or preschool.

262
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,837
LOU: I just...

263
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,209
By the time
I pay for daycare

264
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,244
I may as well stay at
home with her myself.

265
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,812
I'll tell you what,

266
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,881
let me talk to your
case worker, maybe we
can work something out.

267
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:13,152
Work out me sitting in
the office all day before they
tell me I'm wasting my time?

268
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,789
Ocean, every problem
has a solution.

269
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,559
All we have to do is get
our knuckleheads together.

270
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:23,596
No matter how frustrating
it may be, we'll come up
with something.

271
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,799
Aren't you always telling
me your father said,
he didn't raise no quitter?

272
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,306
Kayla, come with me.

273
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,242
I got a little secret.
Come on.

274
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,921
What's going on, Lupe?

275
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,958
What?

276
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,927
Miss?

277
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,095
Peggy?

278
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:05,538
The school called.
Ian is there but he's
not registered.

279
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,039
Ian's at school?

280
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,081
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,590
OCEAN: Peggy,
somebody told me today,

282
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:26,959
that every problem
has a solution.

283
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,031
I don't know how
to do this by myself.

284
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,367
None of us do.

285
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:38,405
When my father died,
he left eight kids
for my mom to support.

286
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:41,274
Okay?

287
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,477
I dropped out of school.

288
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:48,147
So, I used the skills
that my father
showed me fixing things

289
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:51,384
and I ended up making
more money than
everybody else.

290
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,420
It wasn't a whole
lot of money.

291
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,855
But I did what
had to do.

292
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,759
All I'm saying is,
you've got to
start somewhere.

293
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,434
Where?

294
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,603
Turn.

295
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,845
Juan, stop.

296
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,047
Please just listen
to me for s a sec.

297
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,985
Look, I'm just say, would you
love me any less if I had
to go through the surgery...

298
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:29,288
You're tripping! You got
two tits, why would I
imagine you with one?

299
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,325
Look, I got somebody
waiting on me.

300
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,961
Okay, well, what about
your son who's waiting on you?

301
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,996
You act like that's
the only kid I've got.

302
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,998
Well, he's the only
one I got by you,

303
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,233
so, I ain't worried
about anyone else.

304
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,194
OCEAN: Lupe.

305
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,365
I didn't want
to say anything
in front of Peggy

306
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,301
but, uh, I need that
money back that I gave
Buddy Chase for you.

307
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,936
Okay, it's...
I'll get it from
Mike tonight.

308
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,738
OCEAN: Mike?

309
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:22,375
He said he was hoping
all of us would go
trick-or-treating together.

310
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:24,010
Um...
Oh!

311
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,778
Trina!
Yes.

312
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:29,148
LUPE: She looks
so good. Okay.

313
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:35,455
You look nice,
like a young lady for once.

314
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,023
I look like I'm
going to church.

315
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,392
But Lupe said
you'd like it.

316
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,394
She gave it to me.

317
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,163
Auntie Ocean?
Mm-hmm.

318
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,199
Why is Sammy asking
me about his dad
all the time like I know?

319
00:22:47,266 --> 00:22:50,302
I don't really remember him,
but he keeps asking me
how he looks

320
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,838
and if he had
a middle name.

321
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,606
I don't know.

322
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:56,976
I told him
to ask you.

323
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,590
OCEAN: Ian, stop
eating that candy.

324
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:12,625
Sammy, I want to see your
homework before you go to bed.

325
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,127
And none of this
"I got it done, Mama."

326
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,963
'Cause the only way
you're gonna stay
in that school is...

327
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,565
BOTH: On scholarship.

328
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,367
PEGGY: Hey, guys.

329
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,775
I got the job.

330
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:34,914
I'm so happy for you.

331
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,116
Break it down, baby.

332
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:44,323
Only thing is,
I start working
evening shifts at first.

333
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,659
So, I might need
help with Ian.

334
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,327
Um...

335
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,196
I'll pay you as
soon as I get paid.

336
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,298
We'll work it out.

337
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,634
It was that makeover.
Every time!

338
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,507
I never could've done
this without both of you.

339
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:04,343
And, oh, now I can get
my furniture and have
some friends over

340
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,079
and I used to have
a lot of friends

341
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:09,048
and maybe even
invite my sister.

342
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,983
Okay, but first let's
get your costume.

343
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,720
Oh, I... I have
to start work tonight.

344
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,888
But Grandma,
we're all going together.

345
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:20,292
Oh, I know sweetheart
but we need the money, okay?

346
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,128
Save me a chocolate?
Okay.

347
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,497
Love you.
Have fun.

348
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,298
Bye.

349
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:28,367
All right!

350
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:32,138
Oh!

351
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,406
Great costume.
Thank you.

352
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,443
I knew it was you, Daddy.
Oh, you did, did you?

353
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:40,412
Do I have to go?
I'm supposed
to meet somebody.

354
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:41,914
Yes.

355
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:45,818
You look nice.

356
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,126
Daddy!

357
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:02,635
JUAN: Come on, guys,
want to check out
a real party?

358
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,403
Door-to-door's
for kiddies.

359
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,105
'Sup Mike?

360
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,610
Go ahead.

361
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,680
Me and Sophie will be
fine without you.
We always are.

362
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:17,016
J.J. come with us,
please. Mama?

363
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,518
Mama spends time
with you and your
daddy all the time, baby.

364
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:21,921
J.J. never gets to be
with both of his parents.

365
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,355
You have fun, love you.

366
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,767
Hey, let's go catch up
with the other kids, okay?

367
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:40,740
I wanted a family.

368
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,844
Even adopt J.J.

369
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,679
But while I was trying to be
our shutter from the storm,

370
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,281
Lupe's out there
wishing for a hurricane.

371
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,349
Hmm.

372
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,052
Maybe when she
finishes school

373
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,287
I can afford to
go back myself.

374
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:56,756
I want to teach
the little ones.

375
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:58,524
Hmm.

376
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:03,229
I ain't never met a man
that's wanted to be
bothered with little kids.

377
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:06,165
Well, maybe you need
to meet someone now.

378
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,968
You know, men can
impact a kid's life
just like a woman.

379
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,672
That's why I don't
know how much longer
I can take this

380
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,340
arrangement between
me and Lupe.

381
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,177
MIKE: Sophie.

382
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,713
There you go.

383
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,214
And Ian!
Yes!

384
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,282
SAMMY: We never
talk about him.

385
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,586
There's no pictures of him.

386
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:30,823
What could he have done
so bad for you to erase
him out of your life?

387
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:33,693
And mine, too.

388
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,662
He might want to know
I'm smart like him.

389
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:39,966
Oh, and you couldn't have
inherited your brains from
your dumb mama, right?

390
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,234
Boy, what's taking
you so long finding him?

391
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,603
There, that's him.

392
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,539
That's not your father, Sammy.

393
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,043
But he has the same name.
He said he was married to you.

394
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,813
I don't know who this is,
or what he's saying.

395
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,415
I've never seen that man
before in my life.

396
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:57,917
What did you tell him?

397
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:59,686
Did you tell him
where we lived?

398
00:26:59,752 --> 00:27:01,520
Huh? He could be
some kind of...

399
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:03,222
He could be some
kind of child killer.

400
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,824
Did you tell him
where we lived?

401
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,859
I'm not a snitch.
You're not a snitch, boy?

402
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,027
Ocean, he's just scared.

403
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,595
Get your hands off of me!

404
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,364
Don't you ever touch me.

405
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,701
Don't nobody touch me! Ever!

406
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,148
OCEAN: Any nipple discharge?

407
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:31,818
Well, if I'm getting
my freak on, maybe.

408
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,053
Lupe, this is serious.

409
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,156
Ocean, I'm studying
to be a medical assistant,
I know the drill.

410
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,794
Spongy or hard?

411
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:43,595
I don't want
to talk about this.

412
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,365
Well, let's talk
about you and Mike.

413
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:48,567
What?
Girl, please!

414
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:51,437
He is a good man,
but I could never
be happy with him

415
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,972
but maybe you can.

416
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,273
Both of y'all are dull,

417
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:57,209
stubborn...
All right shut it up.

418
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,011
Why are you trying
to change the subject?

419
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,147
Okay, I'll go to the doctor.

420
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:03,716
I just wish
I wouldn't have
said anything.

421
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:07,053
I took her out.
I don't like her anymore.

422
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:26,773
I'm going to cook you
the most romantic
candlelit dinner.

423
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,040
Uh

424
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,408
And what about
the kids?

425
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:32,278
Trina can occupy them.

426
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,580
All right, well,
there's the kitchen.

427
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:37,083
And I'm going
to go in the back
and change my clothes.

428
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,119
Kayla? Baby, let me know
when you hear the bus.

429
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,854
Why don't I go
meet the bus?

430
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,924
You're on.

431
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,662
BOYFRIEND: Come here.
Stop playing, girl.

432
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,998
Come on now.

433
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,768
Come on,
you know you want it.

434
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,605
Get out of my house!

435
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,073
Auntie Ocean...
Ah!

436
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,917
Where's my bat?

437
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:18,224
Come near my niece
again, see if I don't
call the police!

438
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,126
She's underage!

439
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,294
BOYFRIEND: Whatever.

440
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,134
You go back there
and change them
nasty sheets.

441
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,903
Pack your bags
and call your Uncle Bo.

442
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,504
I want you
out of my house.

443
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,644
OCEAN: Uncle Bo,
I tried with her,

444
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,479
but she got to get
out of my house.

445
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,849
Well, I don't
call that trying.

446
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,552
Trying is not taking a drink
when you've drank everyday
of your life. That's trying.

447
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,089
Trying is not
throwing in the towel
after two months.

448
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,590
You know
she's going to
do something.

449
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,225
She's a kid.

450
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,194
A kid sleeping
with everything
walking.

451
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,296
No, I'm not.
He's my boyfriend!

452
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:59,398
OCEAN: You don't need
a boyfriend at your age!

453
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,333
You had one
at my age!

454
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,002
No, I didn't!

455
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,304
You sure about that?
Uncle Bo...

456
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,406
I'm just saying that
if you're really trying
to help her...

457
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,209
She's not my responsibility!
Sure she is!

458
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,044
She's your family!

459
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,246
No, both of you all
back up off me

460
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,348
because you're not going
to make me the bad guy.

461
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,050
Nobody's trying to
make you the bad guy.

462
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,151
But I got
to tell you
one thing,

463
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,319
you sure ain't
the Ocean

464
00:30:20,386 --> 00:30:21,888
that I used to
take care of.

465
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,155
Bo, that's not fair.

466
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,057
Shoot!
Life ain't fair.

467
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:27,826
If you waiting for fair
you'll be waiting in line
for a long time.

468
00:30:27,894 --> 00:30:31,197
The one thing
I asked you
to do for me...

469
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:34,800
It ain't one thing.
It's always something
if it ain't money!

470
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,970
Oh!

471
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,906
Now we going tit for tat.

472
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,941
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

473
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,842
Yeah, you did.
You think you're
better than me.

474
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,178
No, no, I don't.
It's just...

475
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:47,779
You're trying.

476
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:53,252
Come on, Trina.
I'll be waiting in the car.

477
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,822
Because in a minute
I might ask your auntie
for a glass of water,

478
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,424
and Lord knows...

479
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:04,630
I want to watch her
try to get it.

480
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,881
MIKE: Happy Thanksgiving.

481
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:25,884
OCEAN: Our first
Thanksgiving
in the building

482
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,619
and we've all become
like family to each other.

483
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:29,488
He should have been
up here by now.

484
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,757
I, at least,
wanted everybody
together for prayer.

485
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,063
Huh. It's disconnected.

486
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,431
LOU: Hope I'm not late.

487
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,400
No!

488
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:46,672
Ocean, I really couldn't
decide on desert,
so I bought three.

489
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,274
My wife is...

490
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,377
You didn't have to bring
anything but yourself.

491
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:52,711
I bet you say that
to all of them,

492
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,780
especially if they have
a bit of good news.

493
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:04,223
I worked really hard.
Mm-hmm. Yes, you did.

494
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:07,093
I called in a favor
and got your results early.

495
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,196
Now, it's time to fill out
those college applications.

496
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:16,102
Everybody,
this is Mr. Lou Bailey.

497
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,637
My savior, my hero.

498
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:22,641
Mike, Lou.

499
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,711
I'm Mike, just Mike.
Not a hero, not a savior,
just Mike.

500
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,313
Happy Thanksgiving.

501
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,481
Hey, Lupe,
good to see you as well.

502
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,018
I'm gonna go tell Peggy.
Okay!

503
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:40,659
OCEAN: Sometimes our
problems are bigger than
we ever care to admit,

504
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,330
especially to ourselves.

505
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,806
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

506
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,846
They don't want to be
a part of my life,

507
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,548
they never did.

508
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,984
They
only tolerated me
because of my husband.

509
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,056
The very same
man that, um,

510
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,592
gambled my
very life away.

511
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:19,465
You know, Ocean,
I went from millions

512
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,067
to food stamps.

513
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,805
And since
I started working,

514
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,108
I don't even
get those anymore.

515
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,843
Guess what?

516
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,181
Well, I might now, since

517
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,883
I got fired
two days ago.

518
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:45,624
The owner
felt that I was...

519
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,261
Wasn't grateful
enough for his Viagra
show of affection.

520
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:55,467
Back to square one.

521
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,439
And I'm either too
stupid or too old

522
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,411
to master surviving
on my own.

523
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,049
Oh, Ocean,
how do you do it?

524
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:14,253
You.

525
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,858
I passed my GED
because you helped me.

526
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,596
You wouldn't let
me give up.

527
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:28,267
So let me
return the favor.

528
00:34:39,044 --> 00:34:41,647
OCEAN: Everybody grab
hands, close your eyes.

529
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,583
We are so grateful

530
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,254
for each and every one
of us, who by blood

531
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,356
or by love have
become family,

532
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:54,126
and as family,

533
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:56,962
for every problem,
there is a solution.

534
00:34:58,197 --> 00:35:00,199
ALL: Amen.

535
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,568
Anybody want to sing?

536
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:04,270
I just want to
say that, um,

537
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:07,373
I am thankful for
all of my blessings,

538
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,375
and, um,
which is,

539
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,577
every person in this room.

540
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:15,181
And I wish you all,
health and healing.

541
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:18,550
* Good bread, good meat
Good gosh, let's eat *

542
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,259
JUAN: Hey, hey, hey!

543
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:29,595
I don't get an invitation
to Thanksgiving?

544
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,663
I'm still part of
the family, huh?

545
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,932
Juan...
Are you going to call
the police on me?

546
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,001
What are you doing?
Watch where you're
grabbing, son!

547
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,969
Dad...
Juan, let's just stop,
not today, baby...

548
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:40,672
Let's go...
I don't want to be
disrespectful...

549
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:43,675
What are you trying to be,
the head of somebody's
household or something, man?

550
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:46,645
Baby, please not today,
Por favor!

551
00:35:46,712 --> 00:35:49,080
I'm sorry,
he's just drunk and...

552
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,016
Come on, let's go
next door, me and you.
No!

553
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,152
Come on...
No, just...

554
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,288
Come on, you're
going home with Dad.
What about Thanksgiving?

555
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,257
Come on, right now,
you're going home with Daddy.

556
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,826
Mike, please don't do this!
I can't control what
you do with your life.

557
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,127
I can control what
you do with my daughter.

558
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,330
Mike, stop.
Please stop, Juan!

559
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,497
Mike!

560
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,802
Hey, baby.

561
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,413
Remember me?

562
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,948
Your husband.

563
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,386
This is my surprise.

564
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,728
Mike, what are you doing?

565
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:39,130
Are you serious right now?
Are you serious?

566
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,700
We are having
Thanksgiving dinner!

567
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,802
I can't believe you!

568
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,473
LUPE: There are people up
there who have been cooking
all day, just calm down!

569
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,775
Seriously, please.
MIKE: I'm taking
my child!

570
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,310
That's my child, too!

571
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:53,345
Look, I...
I'm not leaving her
in a dangerous situation.

572
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:55,046
This is not
a dangerous situation!

573
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,416
Sarah wouldn't want
you to forget this.

574
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,987
Sarah says thank you, J.J.

575
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:06,492
I have to take her.
No, you don't.

576
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,728
I can't leave her here.
I can't leave her with you
no more. I can't do this!

577
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:12,298
I love her too much.
I can't do this, sorry.
Okay, I love her, too.

578
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm sorry. Sorry!
I love you, baby!

579
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,804
I need you.

580
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,541
OCEAN: Sometimes
you wonder if change
is really possible.

581
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,444
Please forgive me.
And if I can earn
a GED, when I started

582
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:28,380
out reading
at sixth grade level

583
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:30,416
I'm so alone.
maybe it's possible

584
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:33,985
that my ex-husband
could've found God and

585
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:37,122
never use me as
a punching bag again.

586
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,691
I'm asking for
another chance, Ocean.

587
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,595
If you're my daddy,
would you read to me?

588
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,932
Of course I will, baby.

589
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,900
Ah, goodness.

590
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:52,471
OCEAN: Children
are so forgiving.

591
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:55,874
They love even when
they're conceived
out of hate.

592
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:57,676
Don't leave me out!

593
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,846
I like baby stories.

594
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,315
I get the best seat
since I was the only
one at Grandma's

595
00:38:03,382 --> 00:38:05,050
who told you where
to find Auntie Ocean.

596
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,785
Okay, that's fair.

597
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:08,987
"Where's Spot?"

598
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:12,658
OCEAN: Kayla only came into
being because her father
decided after years apart,

599
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,826
he wanted me
back one night.

600
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,829
He was drunk,

601
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,499
so he wouldn't take no
for an answer.

602
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:25,571
I survived.

603
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:32,978
I sometimes am working
so hard, to survive and
take care of them, I...

604
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,348
I forget how much
I just want them to
also be happy.

605
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,721
And right now,
they are.

606
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,192
Happy to have
a father again.

607
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,961
How can I ever take
that away from them?

608
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:39,711
OCEAN: Every morning, I try
to take a moment to pray.

609
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:43,415
Even if it's only
a second to close
my eyes.

610
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:46,985
And acknowledge God
for the blessing
of a brand new day.

611
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,021
And the hope
that this day

612
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,691
is going to bring
something different.

613
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:22,888
I just don't understand
why you had to
lie to him.

614
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,857
Girl, no man needs
to know that the ladies
have been under the knife.

615
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:29,561
Lupe, they did not
cut your titties off.

616
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,262
You had a biopsy.

617
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,133
I'm sorry.

618
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,036
I'm sorry!

619
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,306
Okay, today is just
not my day for saying
the right things.

620
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,045
Um...

621
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,082
I know it's scary.

622
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:56,087
I mean, it's got to be
the most scariest thing
a woman can go through.

623
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:03,128
You want me to fix
you something to eat,
before I go to work?

624
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,863
If I still have a job.

625
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,698
I've missed so much...
No, just go.

626
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:09,400
Um, I'm just going
to lie down before my kids...

627
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,639
I miss my baby

628
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,641
so much.

629
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:18,610
Sometimes, I hate Mike
for taking her away.

630
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,048
I'll see you later.

631
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:40,866
What you doing home?
How come you're not
at work?

632
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:43,001
Senior said I didn't
have to go to school,

633
00:41:43,068 --> 00:41:44,502
'cause I wasn't
feeling well.

634
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,415
Hey, baby.

635
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:07,358
OCEAN: I did like
seeing him move in,
just on a trial basis.

636
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,628
He bought us
this new basketball hoop

637
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:13,932
I'm going to work
at having them see me
laugh every day.

638
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:17,803
Which is easy to do,
you know, with Mike around.

639
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,439
Who Lupe thinks has
a crush on me.

640
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:23,274
I'm like, "Girl, please!"

641
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:26,678
I don't need
somebody else's
baby daddy.

642
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:30,481
It's hard enough managing
the one I already have.

643
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:37,355
I was not under him!
I know what I saw.

644
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,457
Huh? Maybe
you giving it to him,

645
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,793
since you ain't
giving it to me.

646
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,295
Look, I'm sorry.

647
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:49,067
Okay, I just...
I got some good
news just for once,

648
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,969
I came into some money.

649
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:52,103
And I got you something.

650
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,807
Okay, look,
just don't go nowhere.

651
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,718
Mmm! Right?

652
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:10,722
Thought we could
go out, have some fun.
Go dancing.

653
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,792
Look, no kids.

654
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,361
Just want it
to be us again.

655
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,864
Hey, look, I got us
matching cell phones, too.

656
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,436
Sam, where did
you get the money
to pay for this?

657
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:36,982
So what,
you my mama now?

658
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:48,426
Huh? Then whoop
my ass then, since
I did something wrong.

659
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,829
I don't even have
the sense to
breathe right, huh?

660
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:52,831
Can't do nothing right
in Ocean's book.

661
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,934
Damn, Ocean!

662
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:58,136
Every time I think
we've taken
three steps forward

663
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,806
you make sure we
take five steps back.

664
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,574
Like do you know
what that feels like?

665
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:06,611
To not have a job?

666
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:10,415
To not be able to
provide for my family?

667
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:15,053
I know that you're trying.

668
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,422
But they're about
to turn the lights off.

669
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,892
The rent is paid
and nothing else.

670
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:24,462
All that money that
you spent, it could've...

671
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,365
Hello?

672
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:31,569
Yeah, this is
Ocean Jackson.

673
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:33,939
Are you two coming
back or what?

674
00:44:35,073 --> 00:44:36,174
Ooh!

675
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:39,745
This looks like
it was made for me!

676
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,081
Don't you think?

677
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:44,750
I can work this!

678
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,787
I'll be there.

679
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:52,791
Uh... It's, uh...

680
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,193
Uncle Bo...

681
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,329
He's... He's been
in the hospital.

682
00:44:58,396 --> 00:45:00,431
Trina put that dress down.

683
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,739
This goes back
to the store.

684
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,947
Y'all, um...

685
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:17,783
Clean up the couch
for Uncle Bo.
What?

686
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:19,084
No!

687
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,986
We are not having
that alki in here!

688
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,554
Another person
in this house?
Last I checked

689
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,690
all of this here, mine!

690
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:40,171
TRINA: I like
this dress, though.

691
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,041
You are so stubborn.

692
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:45,076
You can tell you're
my daddy's brother.

693
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:50,015
If Daddy listened
to the doctors,
he might still be here.

694
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:54,820
Okay, I promise
Uncle Bo'll take care
of himself.

695
00:45:54,886 --> 00:45:59,324
If I stop drinking and
exercise and get the blood
flowing in my legs more.

696
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:03,261
Hey.
What?

697
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,196
Chicken butt.

698
00:46:06,231 --> 00:46:07,933
Hey, you know
something else?

699
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,068
I love you.

700
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:15,140
I can always count
on my little Ocean.

701
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:18,676
I love you, too.

702
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,814
Hey, what's up, old man?

703
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:25,616
Heard they're going
to cut off your toes.

704
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,066
OCEAN: Sometimes,

705
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,435
it's easier to start
with what you're scared of,

706
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,337
the devil you know,

707
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:49,240
and to figure out what's
ahead for your life.

708
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,143
Is this your card?

709
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,680
No.
Hmm...

710
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:59,550
Is that your card?

711
00:46:59,617 --> 00:47:03,521
OCEAN: I used to play
house and dream what
my children dream,

712
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:05,957
that one day,

713
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:08,726
I'd grow up and
live happily ever after

714
00:47:10,495 --> 00:47:11,963
on a rainbow.

715
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:42,060
OCEAN: But now,
I think I dream in gray,

716
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,331
if that's the color of fear.

717
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:49,667
I'm so scared
that my life will
always be like this.

718
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:53,071
Sitting in a dirty tub

719
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:55,240
somebody forgot
to wash out.

720
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:00,011
Wondering

721
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:03,348
if this is as good
as it's ever going
to get for me.

722
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,728
Oh, Ocean,
I know it's early, but...

723
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:20,031
I was wondering
if I could borrow
your cell phone.

724
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:22,633
My service doesn't
seem to be working

725
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,636
and I wanted
to follow up
on a few jobs.

726
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:26,972
It's 6:00 A.M.

727
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:29,207
Nothing's open.

728
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:31,142
Good morning, Bo.
Good morning, Peggy!

729
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,044
What's wrong with
your cell phone?

730
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:36,447
I keep telling you
that you're qualified
for these programs...

731
00:48:36,514 --> 00:48:38,449
I didn't come up here
to discuss services!

732
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:41,219
I just want to borrow
your phone to make
a few phone calls!

733
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:44,922
Okay, okay, you don't
have to wake up everybody
in the house!

734
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,891
Sorry, Bo!

735
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,695
Um, here,
I need it back before
I leave for work.

736
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,597
Okay.

737
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,733
Oh, I must have pushed
the wrong button! Wow!

738
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,636
Trina sure has a body
on her for a 13-year-old.

739
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:11,749
Looking good
behind that desk!

740
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:16,887
Work Source, we offer
a wide range of services.
How may we serve you?

741
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,357
Please hold while
I put you through.

742
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,461
Girl, you just keep
on surprising me.

743
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,563
So, that's a good
thing, right?

744
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,998
Yeah!

745
00:49:27,065 --> 00:49:29,667
Where did you get those
earrings, I haven't
seen those before.

746
00:49:29,734 --> 00:49:31,536
My girlfriend at school
makes them.

747
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:34,739
Those do not look
homemade.

748
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,243
Trina, there was
something that I wanted
to talk to you about.

749
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,779
Oh, no, I knew you
didn't invite me down here
to play receptionist!

750
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,781
What did I do now?
Nothing.

751
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,586
Trina, you're
a very smart girl.
Yeah.

752
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,122
For the first time in school,
I'm doing good.

753
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:53,958
Aunty Ocean, I'm getting A's
in math and science!

754
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,661
My teacher says I can be
an engineer or something!

755
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,963
I got to figure out
what they do first!

756
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:04,269
I am so glad that you
are finally motivated.

757
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,605
I just want you
to conduct yourself...

758
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,707
How do I put this? Um...

759
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,879
Senior loves
all you kids.

760
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,148
You know that
don't you? A lot.

761
00:50:19,217 --> 00:50:20,285
But maybe Trina

762
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,888
somewhere in your mind,
you've got it twisted

763
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,523
that his caring

764
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,024
is something more.

765
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:30,561
So we talked
about boundaries...
Boundaries against me?

766
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,197
What are you talking about?

767
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:34,899
I picked up his phone
by accident, there was
a picture of you.

768
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:38,002
Not Kayla,
not Sammy...
Or you?

769
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,904
That's why you're
really mad, isn't it?

770
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,341
Senior said you were
jealous, that's why
y'all broke off before!

771
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:46,544
He shouldn't be talking
about me, to you.
Why not?

772
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,814
You discuss me
with him.

773
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,582
How I'm not
your responsibility.

774
00:50:51,649 --> 00:50:54,352
That you only let
me stay 'cause
Uncle Bo asked you.

775
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:56,053
But I thought
we was doing better.

776
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:58,289
That you were even
starting to like me.

777
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,391
But you're just
like my mom.

778
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,361
Always accusing
me of something.

779
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:06,264
Me trying to take her man
when all I wanted was her.

780
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:09,234
And it's not like
it was a picture of me
naked or something.

781
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,302
God, so when you
want me to leave?

782
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:14,272
I'm not talking about
you leaving, Trina,
I love you.

783
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,477
Oh, good,
I need a hug, too.

784
00:51:19,544 --> 00:51:20,711
What's wrong with her?

785
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:23,581
Growing up too fast.
That's how those girls do!

786
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:26,083
With their hot asses,
13 and on fire!

787
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:29,654
Anyway, girl,
I came here
for a reason.

788
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,356
I need you
to get my results.

789
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,458
You didn't make that call?

790
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:35,760
You work right next
to the hospital,
all you have to do

791
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,229
is walk five steps
and you could have
got your results.

792
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,665
I'm trying to work up
my nerve.

793
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,600
I'm starting
to hate hospitals.

794
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:46,237
Really, I'm starting
to hate everything
except maybe...

795
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:48,206
Well, except maybe Mike.

796
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,575
Hmm.

797
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,543
Girl, I tried to
give him to you,

798
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,013
but then you went
and pulled a husband
out of the hat.

799
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,115
Look, I'm telling you, just...

800
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:01,252
All this medical
stuff's just got
me so scared,

801
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,621
I can't do this
alone no more.

802
00:52:03,688 --> 00:52:05,089
I need somebody
I can count on.

803
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:09,627
I know you know
what I mean, I mean
why else would you even

804
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:12,630
think about being back
with your baby daddy?

805
00:52:14,232 --> 00:52:16,601
Give me the phone
and the phone number.

806
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:28,213
WOMAN: Medical clinic.
Hello.

807
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,914
Can I help you?

808
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,182
Hello?

809
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:33,150
Hello?

810
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:34,719
Hold on, please.

811
00:52:39,557 --> 00:52:42,092
Hello?
How can I help you?

812
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,495
This is Lupe Ramirez,

813
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:47,798
I was just wondering
if you have my
biopsy results.

814
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:51,168
Please hold for a minute.

815
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:54,639
Inconclusive does not
mean that everything
is okay.

816
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:57,174
Before you start
celebrating, you need
to go see your doctor.

817
00:52:57,242 --> 00:53:00,711
Girl, inconclusive means
Lupe dodged a bullet, and...

818
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:02,813
That's all I care about.

819
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,282
What is this stuff
on my floor?

820
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:05,783
Okay, look, starting tomorrow,

821
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:07,618
you, me and Avon
are going to be having
a fitness class,

822
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,387
'cause we all need
to get healthy

823
00:53:09,454 --> 00:53:12,457
Lupe, you see
this stuff on the floor?
Uh-huh.

824
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:14,459
It looks like confetti.

825
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,501
Oh, man, I told them
to keep the lights
on for me!

826
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:26,337
Know I don't like
to come home to
a dark house!

827
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:28,939
ALL: Happy birthday!

828
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,649
Baby, Trina and I've been
planning this for a month!

829
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,118
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I kept it a secret

830
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:43,120
and you know
that's a lot of work!

831
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,623
Trina!

832
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,992
ALL CHANTING:
Ocean, Ocean, Ocean!

833
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,301
Happy birthday,
Auntie Ocean!

834
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,768
Make a wish!

835
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,868
You happy, baby?

836
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,036
Very!

837
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:38,142
Mmm! Rather tasty!

838
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,580
Building up my
husband points.

839
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:44,449
Whoo!

840
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:59,029
You go party.
I'm going to sit
here and relax.

841
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:02,232
BO: Let me show
you how to do it.

842
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,300
OCEAN: Whoa!

843
00:55:10,341 --> 00:55:14,311
Auntie Ocean, I'm gonna
go lie down, I'm tired!

844
00:55:14,379 --> 00:55:16,614
Oh, Trina, the
party just started!

845
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,983
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we got a special project!

846
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:21,552
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
come on, Trina!

847
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,090
BO: Yeah, thank you!

848
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,593
Yeah!

849
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,432
It's beautiful!

850
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:38,536
We've been working
on this 24/7!

851
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:40,204
We?

852
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,307
Oh, yeah, I'll be real
happy to give you all
the credit, old man!

853
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:46,243
Since us peons went
back and forth to get...
I love it!

854
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,446
I love it! I love it!
Thank you!

855
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,982
Both of you.

856
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:56,921
Thank all of you for
making this one of the
best birthdays I've ever had.

857
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:04,462
* Party over here
Party over there *

858
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,100
Oh.

859
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:15,606
Wow!

860
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:20,878
"To Ocean, buy
something just for you.

861
00:56:20,945 --> 00:56:25,583
"After all, a lot of people
wouldn't know what
to do without you.

862
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:29,219
"So, take care of you.
Love, Mr. Bailey.

863
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,722
"And flex."

864
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:37,227
I got the garbage out.

865
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:40,264
And I was going to vacuum
but I thought it might wake up
Bo and the kids.

866
00:56:41,766 --> 00:56:43,100
It was a great party,
wasn't it?

867
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:44,268
Yeah, it was.

868
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,371
Where's my pillow
and blankets?

869
00:56:49,674 --> 00:56:52,510
OCEAN: Mr. Bailey is right.

870
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:56,914
I'm flexing my mean muscle,
so what the hell?

871
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,516
It's my birthday,

872
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:04,889
and tonight I wanna
feel taken care of.

873
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:13,097
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

874
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:23,340
Whoa! Don't you look
nice this morning!

875
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:26,611
So, what do you think
about me moving out?

876
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,779
You know, your mother's
always got a bed for me

877
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:32,550
and I'm thinking about
singing up with that
Older Workers' program.

878
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:37,988
Uh, I think that is
the worst idea I've
heard in a long time.

879
00:57:38,055 --> 00:57:41,025
Somebody needs to
still take care of your leg.

880
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:45,429
And, Uncle Bo, I've asked
Senior to stop bringing
liquor into this house.

881
00:57:45,496 --> 00:57:47,364
I do not want you tempted.

882
00:57:47,431 --> 00:57:50,434
Well, keeping me
sober is really not
your responsibility.

883
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,738
Taking care of grown-ass
folks who are old enough
to know what they're doing,

884
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,174
should never be
your responsibility.

885
00:57:57,241 --> 00:58:01,378
But taking care of you
is my privilege.

886
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:04,081
And Mr. GQ in there?

887
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:07,451
You know, baby,
I've been trying to hold
my tongue 'cause you grown.

888
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,587
But I gotta ask you,

889
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:13,724
why in the hell
did you let that
fool back in here?

890
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:16,827
The kids need
to know their father.

891
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:18,295
Then let him come visit!

892
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:21,298
Not lay up here on you
like he's been doing.

893
00:58:21,365 --> 00:58:24,869
And what does he contribute
to the household besides
sleeping most of the day?

894
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,370
That's not fair!

895
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:29,139
He's been working
with this cleaning business,

896
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:32,543
and they clean
foreclosed homes
when people move out.

897
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,813
Oh, really? I don't know what
kind of cleaning he does,

898
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,083
because every time I see him
come back here, he's just
as clean as he left out.

899
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,686
You could do better.

900
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:44,021
Well, you know what they say,

901
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:47,291
"It's always easier with the
devil you already know."

902
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,393
Until he surprises you again.

903
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,478
Senior.

904
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,981
Senior.

905
00:59:16,687 --> 00:59:21,692
Wake up. Mr. Bailey's
on his way and we gotta go.

906
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:25,830
There's only one place
I wanna go but I need you
to take me there, baby.

907
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,665
Stop playing.

908
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:30,567
Slip some clothes on,
I don't want to keep
Mr. Bailey waiting.

909
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:32,336
Mr. Bailey.

910
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,207
Mr. Bailey this
and Mr. Bailey that.

911
00:59:39,009 --> 00:59:40,577
Don't you think
he's a little old?

912
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,483
Got you thinking
you're college material.

913
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,354
You barely
finished eighth grade.

914
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,724
"See the dog
cross the street."

915
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:56,994
That's not funny.

916
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:58,896
Look, you can't
take a joke no more?

917
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:01,832
I'm just playing with you!
Come on, look,
you can't take a joke?

918
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,100
Uh-uh.

919
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:11,709
BO: What happened
to that happy face?

920
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:17,514
Um...

921
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,185
Can you keep
an eye on the kids?

922
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:23,387
I, uh...

923
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:26,090
I'm gonna wait
for Mr. Bailey outside.

924
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:29,259
You know the best
thing I learned at AA?

925
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,061
Simple.

926
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,731
Change your mind,
change your life.

927
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,867
That's what today's
all about.

928
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:40,771
So don't let nothing
or nobody get in your way.

929
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,822
Dad thought me
everything about houses.

930
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,792
So, I was thinking maybe...

931
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:06,363
Maybe I wanted
to be a teacher.

932
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:12,536
Maybe even a lawyer.

933
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:16,807
No, no, no. Don't laugh.
Don't laugh. It's not funny.

934
01:01:18,943 --> 01:01:21,178
You see, Ocean,
that's all achievable.

935
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:28,318
Roll up your fist.

936
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:30,020
Come on, come on, come on.
Roll up your fists.

937
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:33,724
Now bend your arm.

938
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,962
Flex.

939
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:44,601
Every day I want you
to flex your "me" muscle.

940
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:49,807
Every day I want you
to do something,

941
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:52,676
think something,

942
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:55,846
wonder about something,
pray about something,

943
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:59,183
anything you have to
do to make it about you.

944
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,717
What Ocean wants.

945
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:09,493
Me? Well didn't you
see what I wrote about
Senior and him cutting hair,

946
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:13,497
and, uh, how he wants
to open a barber shop,

947
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,800
and he wants to go
into business together.

948
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:20,437
Flex, Ocean! Flex!

949
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,373
I want you to start
that sentence again,

950
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,577
I want you to start it with,
"What, I, Ocean wants."

951
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,080
Oh, come on!

952
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:34,151
Ocean, give me another excuse.
Tell me about how you
had to repair your family.

953
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:38,588
How you had to
move everyone forward
and forget about you.

954
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:40,590
And you are not
moving you ahead!

955
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:42,359
Flex!

956
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,229
Don't stop flexing.

957
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,597
Flex!

958
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,734
I'm flexing, damn it!

959
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:00,144
Hmm...

960
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:16,093
It felt good to
yell at me, didn't it?

961
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:33,110
This is for you.

962
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:36,113
That's more application
papers just in case
you lost the others.

963
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,716
And my phone number
is in there, just in case
you need to talk.

964
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:49,159
Thank you.

965
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:54,531
Oh! Just in time
to work out!

966
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:57,334
Girl, I told you, we
need a whole building
fitness program.

967
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:59,536
Let me show you, I've got
my routine worked out.

968
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:04,875
So, happy belated birthday.

969
01:04:05,742 --> 01:04:07,677
Heard your party was great.

970
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:09,313
Would have brought
you a present

971
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:11,448
but your husband seems
a tad bit protective,
wouldn't you say?

972
01:04:11,515 --> 01:04:12,716
You think?

973
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,153
Girl, come in and
workout with us!

974
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,056
Look, I've decided
no more hospitals for me.

975
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:20,958
I've decided to become
a personal trainer.

976
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:22,927
Look, I, I just can't
take it anymore.

977
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,962
And Mike, he went and
bought me all these books

978
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:27,431
on exercise and
physicology and stuff.

979
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:29,066
Look at me, I can't even
pronounce the word right.

980
01:04:29,133 --> 01:04:32,369
But I am serious
about this, girl.

981
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:36,440
Hey, my grandma was
looking to take something
for her toothache.

982
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:38,675
She's spitting out blood
and I'm kind of scared.

983
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:51,922
I'm sure you knew your
insurance card is not valid.

984
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:57,928
Oh, my! Did my husband
send me with the wrong card?

985
01:04:57,995 --> 01:05:00,564
Oh! I thought
you were a widow.

986
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,868
Oh...

987
01:05:04,935 --> 01:05:09,739
Perhaps I could speak
to a supervisor, someone
who understands?

988
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:13,110
I already did that.
That's what took me so long.

989
01:05:13,177 --> 01:05:16,046
That card hasn't been
valid for over a year.

990
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:20,284
Do you have any
other kind of insurance?
A DSS card?

991
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,419
Uh-uh. Why is she...

992
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:24,288
Let her handle it.

993
01:05:24,354 --> 01:05:27,124
Peggy needs to advocate
for herself sometimes.

994
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:29,593
I'm sorry, what is that?

995
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:32,596
Medicaid!

996
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:35,232
You do understand
what that is, don't you?

997
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,502
I have a right
not to be shouted at.

998
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:40,237
Nobody is shouting!

999
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:42,806
Well, a public broadcast
would be quieter.

1000
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,075
Look, lady, nobody cares!

1001
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:48,678
Before you can see a doctor
for non-emergency ailment,

1002
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:52,682
we need to know
who is gonna be
responsible for the visit.

1003
01:05:52,749 --> 01:05:55,252
I am responsible
for the visit!

1004
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:57,854
Uh-uh. I'll do the talking!

1005
01:06:00,490 --> 01:06:02,993
Here's $100 down-payment.

1006
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,295
Now. please,
may I see a doctor?

1007
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,297
Excuse me, don't you think
you're being a little...

1008
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:08,798
Little like a bitch!

1009
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:11,068
Okay, look, here's how
it's gonna go, sister girl.

1010
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:13,503
This is our friend here
and her mouth hurts!

1011
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:16,006
So from here and now, we'll
just do the talking for her.

1012
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:19,243
Now, we both know
how this works so get out
those special papers,

1013
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:22,546
the ones for people
who can't pay,
we both know what they are.

1014
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,348
And you really
need to stop acting

1015
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:26,916
like her bill is gonna come
out of your paycheck, okay?

1016
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,752
So, let's get to work
so she can see a doctor

1017
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,821
or me and my girl here,
are gonna turn this place out!

1018
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:35,792
And you ain't heard loud till
I start shouting those "isms."
You know the ones.

1019
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:39,029
Racism, ageism,
classism, um...

1020
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:42,266
Professionalism,
which you certainly
get a failing grade on.

1021
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,535
And you know I work here,
so I know people.

1022
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,272
So, should we do this
in Spanish or English?

1023
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:51,408
And do you wanna add anything,
since, you were supposed
to be doing all the talking?

1024
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:53,077
Uh-uh. You got it covered.

1025
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,579
I just don't like
people trying to talk
down to me, that's all.

1026
01:06:55,645 --> 01:06:58,982
Hey, look, I'm willing
to talk up to you,
whatever you need, baby-cakes,

1027
01:06:59,049 --> 01:07:01,451
but she's gonna see a doctor
and that's right about now.

1028
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:06,256
Thanks, sweetie.

1029
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:08,992
Thank you.

1030
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,702
Girl, I know you're tired.
It's past midnight.

1031
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,671
There's no sense in waking
the kids up now, we'll just
get them in the morning.

1032
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:26,110
Why don't you go on up and
I'll get Peggy settled in.

1033
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:27,244
You sure?

1034
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:30,180
Girl, you have a husband
waiting on you.

1035
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,782
Avon and I ain't got
a soul waiting on us.

1036
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:34,451
Do we, Avon?
PEGGY: Uh-uh.

1037
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:36,520
I think I like the
sound of that.

1038
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,655
Having a husband
waiting on me.

1039
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,799
Oh! It stinks like
liquor in here!

1040
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,770
So damn dark.

1041
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,609
What are you doing?

1042
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,945
You don't think I know

1043
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,713
What are you talking about?

1044
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,882
You've been cheating
on me, huh?

1045
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,884
Huh

1046
01:08:10,187 --> 01:08:13,290
Do you know what
time it is? It's 12:30!

1047
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,626
I know what I think!
You cheating on me!

1048
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:21,698
OCEAN: Once again, I ignored
the writing on the wall.

1049
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,402
Traded my heart
for so little in return.

1050
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:28,605
And once again,
I let the devil fool me.

1051
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:32,075
Mom, what are you doing?
Auntie Ocean, it is 6:00 AM!

1052
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:37,281
The hardest conversation
a mother ever has to
have with her kids.

1053
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:42,286
Is explaining away
her own failures.

1054
01:08:42,352 --> 01:08:43,987
I changed the locks.

1055
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:50,260
So if Senior comes by,
do not let him in.
I don't care what he says.

1056
01:08:50,327 --> 01:08:53,029
What if he's not drinking?
You mean he can't
come in his own house?

1057
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:54,264
This is my house!

1058
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:56,300
Maybe that's the problem!

1059
01:08:56,366 --> 01:09:00,870
Okay, see, today
is not the day to mess
with me, you understand?

1060
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,839
As a matter of fact,
I don't want to see nobody!

1061
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:07,577
Mama, does is hurt?

1062
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:15,051
Why'd you let him come
and live with us if
he'd done this before?

1063
01:09:17,187 --> 01:09:19,223
He's your father, Sammy.

1064
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:26,796
What happened between
me and Senior is, um,
grown folks business.

1065
01:09:28,332 --> 01:09:30,667
But I know that he
loves you very much!

1066
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,204
How can you say that?

1067
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:36,506
If he beats you, how can
you say he loves me?

1068
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:47,317
But why did he hit you?
That's what I wanna know.

1069
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:51,855
He's never raised
a hand to any of us.

1070
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:54,057
And we're kids.

1071
01:09:55,459 --> 01:09:59,128
You must've said
or done something.

1072
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,799
I don't care what
I say or what I do.

1073
01:10:02,866 --> 01:10:06,636
No man is allowed
to lay hands on you, Trina.

1074
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:09,739
That's not true.

1075
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:15,645
Every man that has laid hands
on my mama did it because
she wanted him to.

1076
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:23,387
A woman can make a man hit her
without speaking a word, okay?

1077
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:27,657
For some children,
you need a magic eraser.

1078
01:10:27,724 --> 01:10:34,864
To erase every bad memory,
every violent event,
every bad excuse.

1079
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:40,236
The ones some adult gave
them or the ones they
made up themselves

1080
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:43,239
to excuse the inexcusable.

1081
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:48,211
J.J., you're just being
stubborn. I'm not gonna
be gone for long.

1082
01:10:48,278 --> 01:10:51,515
It's just that your daddy
and I have some things
that we need to talk about.

1083
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:54,117
Like, we might be
getting back together.

1084
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:55,752
Would you like that, sweetie?

1085
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:58,788
But I thought that
you and Mike were
starting to talk again.

1086
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:02,426
We do. It's complicated.

1087
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:04,794
But you know
your mama loves you.

1088
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:08,532
No, you don't! At least when
Sophie was here you actually
stayed at home sometimes.

1089
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,200
J.J...
You always do everything
for her and nothing for me.

1090
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,802
That is not true!
Hey, little man!

1091
01:11:15,505 --> 01:11:18,107
Hey, sexy thing.

1092
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:20,544
I can always tell when you
get dressed up just for me.

1093
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:23,079
So, you ready?

1094
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:26,783
What if we bring J.J. with
us so that we can get
a bite to eat together?

1095
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,320
And then we'll just drop
him back off at Ocean's
so we could have our talk.

1096
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,765
Don't spend it all
in one place, little man.

1097
01:11:41,831 --> 01:11:43,700
Come on, Lupe,
let's get out of here.

1098
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:47,170
Maybe I don't want your money.
It's probably stolen anyway.

1099
01:11:54,611 --> 01:11:57,313
That's my boy!

1100
01:11:57,381 --> 01:12:01,184
Don't ever back down
from anybody, not even me.

1101
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,330
Come on, Lupe.
Let's get out of here.

1102
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,405
We really had a good day.

1103
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:23,940
Yeah, you sure
are happy today.

1104
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:26,209
Closest to perfection
as one could get.

1105
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:29,479
I've got the bestest,
smartest children in
the whole wide world

1106
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:31,147
and I did something...

1107
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:32,816
Uncle Bo!

1108
01:12:33,383 --> 01:12:34,518
Oh!

1109
01:12:37,286 --> 01:12:38,488
OCEAN: No!

1110
01:12:49,633 --> 01:12:51,968
Girl, I'm glad you
don't play cards.

1111
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,707
Because I look at your face
and see everything you
ever thought to think.

1112
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:03,780
We all die of something,
might as well be diabetes.

1113
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:05,749
Maybe I should
get you to emergency.

1114
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:08,552
I ain't going nowhere
except to sleep on this couch.

1115
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:16,426
Give me some of that
Ocean sugar so I can dream
me some sweet dreams.

1116
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:28,905
I stink, huh?

1117
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:31,941
My breath stinks,
my leg stinks.

1118
01:13:32,008 --> 01:13:34,243
I'm just a stinking
son of a bitch.

1119
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,749
I'll get cleaned up
after a little shut-eye.

1120
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:43,787
Be back on that
train to righteousness.

1121
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:11,214
What

1122
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,916
No. No, I'm not scared.

1123
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:16,319
I was just putting the
pillow behind your head.

1124
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,788
Well, stop looking
at me like that.

1125
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:21,457
Not like I'm disappointing
you all the time.

1126
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:24,060
I'm your Uncle Bo.

1127
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:28,397
At least I got that
son of a bitch out of here.

1128
01:14:32,736 --> 01:14:34,303
Uncle Bo took care of it.

1129
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,040
Nobody messes with mine.

1130
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:41,310
If he stayed, no telling
what he would've done.

1131
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:46,916
Uncle Bo took care of it.

1132
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,553
Bo take care of his.

1133
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:57,293
Yes, Uncle Bo,
you took care of it.

1134
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,063
You take care of everything.

1135
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:02,732
Okay. Okay.

1136
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,336
I don't want to scare mine.

1137
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,879
This diabetes

1138
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:20,383
keeps me so dehydrated!

1139
01:15:22,051 --> 01:15:23,787
You got a beer or something?

1140
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:41,571
OCEAN: Sometimes God
reminds you all is not lost.

1141
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:52,849
Because if you have
a covenant with him,

1142
01:15:52,916 --> 01:15:58,454
to borrow Lupe's words,
there's always a snap-back.

1143
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:01,457
An opportunity to change.

1144
01:16:01,524 --> 01:16:05,962
To start over.
To manage your fear.

1145
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:33,122
And of course, prayer
is the best weapon we have.

1146
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:35,291
Always.

1147
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:41,130
If we ever hope to silence our
silent screams of despair.

1148
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:50,907
You're two months behind
on your rent and I can't hold
the landlord off any longer!

1149
01:16:50,974 --> 01:16:53,109
And I'm not gonna
let him fire me!

1150
01:16:53,176 --> 01:16:57,046
Well, it's just that Ian's
medicine is so expensive.

1151
01:16:57,113 --> 01:17:00,016
I tried taking him off of it,
he was totally out of control.

1152
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:01,517
Maybe next month I can...

1153
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:05,021
You don't have another month!
He's gonna evict you.

1154
01:17:05,088 --> 01:17:07,456
He's gonna put
your stuff on the curb.

1155
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:10,760
Peggy, you can't sleep
all day and bake all night,

1156
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:14,363
pretending that things are
somehow gonna be different.

1157
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,766
You gotta do
something different.

1158
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:19,068
What about assistance?

1159
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,338
No one in my family's
ever been on welfare!

1160
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:24,140
Well, now the rich
are the poor.

1161
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:25,675
I'm not poor.

1162
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,911
Okay, you're not poor.

1163
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:31,981
You just need a little help.

1164
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:35,251
What about food stamps?

1165
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:37,420
We have food!

1166
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,057
Maybe welfare
is for you and your...

1167
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:49,632
What you were gonna
say was welfare was best
for me and my people.

1168
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:54,437
Look around you, Peggy.

1169
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:57,506
You're my people now.

1170
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:02,511
Actually, the color
of welfare has
always been white.

1171
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:04,981
It's just the way
the economy is going,

1172
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:07,216
it's getting painted
whiter by the minute.

1173
01:18:09,118 --> 01:18:10,353
Come here.

1174
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:31,240
Oh! I'm scared for
you to answer that.

1175
01:18:37,847 --> 01:18:40,083
What is it, Trina?

1176
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:42,886
Girl, stop screaming
in the phone!
I can't understand you!

1177
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:52,061
Auntie Ocean, I didn't
know what to do!

1178
01:18:52,128 --> 01:18:54,931
I called Senior and
he came here right away.

1179
01:18:54,998 --> 01:18:57,834
All of us kids,
we were so spooked.
It was scary.

1180
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,103
Uncle Bo was having seizures!

1181
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:03,272
He was bleeding and
he was screaming!

1182
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:08,644
Mom, it was so scary.
If Dad hadn't been here...

1183
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:13,049
Sam, I'm always gonna be here
for you, no matter what happen
between me and your mama.

1184
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,935
Mom, are you okay?

1185
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:40,376
Dad and I had a talk.

1186
01:19:41,978 --> 01:19:45,148
And I understand where
he's coming from now.

1187
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:52,088
It's like what you said,
when he's drunk
he can't help himself.

1188
01:19:53,356 --> 01:19:55,424
Mom!

1189
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,861
I thought I told you to
take that back to the store.

1190
01:19:57,927 --> 01:20:01,497
But, Auntie, Senior let me
have it because you said
you didn't want it.

1191
01:20:01,564 --> 01:20:03,399
Oh, my God, man!

1192
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,604
She's a baby. A baby!

1193
01:20:10,706 --> 01:20:14,243
How could I be so stupid?
When all you wanted
to do was just...

1194
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:18,547
Uh-uh. Look,
I just gave her this dress.
Why you tripping?

1195
01:20:18,614 --> 01:20:20,083
I just came over here to talk!

1196
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:23,286
Talk? Ain't nothing for
us to talk about. Get out!

1197
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:25,855
Now!

1198
01:20:25,922 --> 01:20:27,290
You disgust me.

1199
01:20:27,356 --> 01:20:31,227
Auntie, Senior said
he was sorry.
Shut it up!

1200
01:20:31,294 --> 01:20:34,063
You are a kid and
you should be a kid!

1201
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:35,965
Yeah, she got a woman body.

1202
01:20:36,732 --> 01:20:39,835
But this is a kid. My kid!

1203
01:20:39,903 --> 01:20:44,407
And I'll go through hell
and high water to protect
her from anybody. Now get out!

1204
01:20:44,473 --> 01:20:46,509
Look, Mama, he said he
wasn't gonna drink anymore.

1205
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:50,379
I'm not, Ocean. I haven't
had one drink since I left.

1206
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,681
I even apologized to Uncle Bo.

1207
01:20:56,019 --> 01:21:00,323
He promised.
His promises
ain't worth a dime.

1208
01:21:00,389 --> 01:21:03,526
You're always saying
you gotta forgive.

1209
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:09,332
Son, there's one thing you
don't know about your mama.

1210
01:21:09,398 --> 01:21:11,867
She don't always
practice what she preaches.

1211
01:21:11,935 --> 01:21:15,871
Oh, okay, you want a sermon?
Is that what you need?

1212
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,206
Okay, here you go.

1213
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:22,211
I deserve better!
My kids deserve better!

1214
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:26,749
And it don't
include you, ever.

1215
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:28,784
Now get out!

1216
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,322
I'm gonna count to three.

1217
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,592
And then I'm gonna
call the police.

1218
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:39,395
Okay.

1219
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,697
Come here, baby.

1220
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,802
Please don't go!

1221
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:49,605
Mama, you don't have
to be so mean to Daddy!

1222
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,542
I love you, baby.

1223
01:21:56,012 --> 01:21:57,246
I tried, Sammy.

1224
01:21:57,813 --> 01:21:59,482
Get out!

1225
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:03,019
Man, shut the hell up!
You can't keep me
from seeing my kids, Ocean.

1226
01:22:03,086 --> 01:22:05,188
I'm gonna see them
with or without you.

1227
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,223
I'll see you in hell first.

1228
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:08,824
Yeah, I think we
can arrange that.

1229
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:10,359
One...

1230
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:13,963
Two...

1231
01:22:39,522 --> 01:22:41,057
What else I don't know, Trina?

1232
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:47,830
All he did
was give me a few
gifts, Auntie Ocean.

1233
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,133
Nothing else.

1234
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:54,370
OCEAN: Some nights, all
I can do is ask God why.

1235
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:57,206
What did I do to
deserve any of it?

1236
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:01,610
Today was supposed
to be my day.

1237
01:23:02,878 --> 01:23:05,648
Got started out
with so much promise.

1238
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:11,454
And then it deteriorated
into a lot of "what ifs."

1239
01:23:12,421 --> 01:23:14,957
What if I had stayed home?

1240
01:23:15,024 --> 01:23:18,194
Not left Uncle Bo alone.

1241
01:23:18,261 --> 01:23:23,499
What if I had never let Senior
come back in the first place?

1242
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:30,673
But at some point I guess
the "what ifs" are nothing
but an opportunity

1243
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:35,844
to renew your
faith and possibility.

1244
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:39,448
I'm Ocean Jackson, and this
is the diary of a single mom

1245
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:43,018
trying to get ahead in a world
trying to hold her under.
