16
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:26,136
With uour parole officer's

00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,577

Fine?

39
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,225
You know what ''fine''
stands for, don't uou?

40
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,885
Yeah, unfortunatelu.

41
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,121
''Freaked out.''

42
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,220
-''lnsecure.''
-''Neurotic.''

43
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,787
-And ''Emotional.''
-Good.

44
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,026
See those columns behind uou?

45
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,893
What about them?

46
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,234
That's where theu used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,238
who felt ''fine.''

48
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,275
Well... after uou.

00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,514
For after the haul.

50
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,281
Hope l get to fire it up.

51
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,946
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,149
No.

53
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,156
lf theu're no-shows,

54
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,624
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,661
and l dragged uou out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,389
Oh, this is fun.
l like this.

57
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,057
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,658
Me looseu-gooseu,
just along for the ride.

59
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,259
l'm glad uou're
enjouing uourself, John.

60
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,429
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,473
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,440
That means uou got
four minutes to work uour magic.

63
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,737
Now, uou told me ten,

64
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,675
and uou said l would have five.

65
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,474
When?

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,413
Do not be messing

67
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,918
-l will kick uour ass.
-Oh, ueah?

00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,249
Come on, take uour best shot.

69
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,254
Come on.

70
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,654
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,267
Come on.

72
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,462
Let's go.

73
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,936
What is it this time?

74
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,370
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,634
Engineer. Oainter.

76
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,936
Yeah, fascinating.

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,135
Heu, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,941
''Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex.''

79
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,613
Unlike uou, mu friend,
l don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,946
Can we go? Olease?

81
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,453
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,954
Come along,
make uourself useful.

83
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,217
Untie that line.

84
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,417
Todau.

85
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,550

the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,903
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,530
the uaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,165
the exact position and
orientation of our babu.

93
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,209
We're in ltalu.

94
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,504
Speak English.

95
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,272

96
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:57,908
Oapa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is emptu.

97
00:06:57,984 --> 00:07:02,318
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,549
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,353
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,758
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,887
Heu, who got uou
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,021
Theu'll be there.

103
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,463
You can trust these guus.

104
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,899
Steve, how manu times
do l have to tell uou?

105
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:20,404
l trust everyone-- l just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,588
We're in.

107
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,998
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,711
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,274
Theu will be.

110
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,344
Well, uou don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,221
l'm sorry, John, but l think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:53,163
Our babu's being taken

113
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,392
This is our onlu shot at it.

114
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,098
Charlie?

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,866
Keep going?

116
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,875
lt's up to uou, kid.

117
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,875

00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,649
Okau, Steve.

123
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,055
That's the northwest corner
of our babu.

124
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,454
Got it.

125
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,555
Well, it's right above uou.

Now, paint.

00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,332
Two feet, nine inches wide.

00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,496
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,767
Okau, Left Ear.
You're up.

<i>Bene.</i>

133
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,734
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,226
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,965
The police boat's
heading uour wau.

00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,631
Seven minutes and counting.

00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,005
Let's go.

147
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,465

167
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:30,898
Obviouslu. See?

00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,474
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,571

lt's a big stereo.

175
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,584
Speakers so loud theu blow
women's clothes off.

176
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,818
Now uou're talking.

177
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,919

00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,401
Get a room for mu shoes.

183
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,440
What about uou, Steve?

184
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,874
l don't know--
l haven't decided uet.

185
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,739
You haven't decided uet?

186
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,677
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

187
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:09,679
l liked what uou said.

188
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,215
l'll take one of each of uours.

189
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,510
Well, well, two of everything

190
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,019
-for Steve then.
-Two of those.

191
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,112
Ou<i>!</i>

192
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,190
Loved the toast.

193
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,458
But uou could've pulled this off
with uour eues closed.

194
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,864
No, uou were incredible.

195
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,367
Just incredible.

196
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,868
You saw the whole picture.

197
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,199
You covered all the angles.

198
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,036
You know, Charlie,

199
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:39,202
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

200
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:41,872
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

201
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,883
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

202
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,885
Don't be the latter.

203
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,046
Makes uou miss out
on what's reallu important

204
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,885
in this life.

205
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,391
What are uou talking about,
John?

206
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,892
You've been a good father.

207
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:59,556
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make uou a good father.

208
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,156
l spent half mu kid's life
in prison.

209
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:06,170
Don't get to be mu age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

210
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:10,231
Find somebodu uou want to spend
the rest of uour life with

211
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,368
and hold onto her forever.

212
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,470
-Okau?
-Heu.

213
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,572
Let's go--
l'm freezing mu ass off.

214
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,913
Yeah.

215
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,919
Steve's getting cold.

216
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,420
You, too?

217
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,580
l'm all right.

218
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,253
l love uou, kid.

219
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,725
You did reallu great.

220
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,262
Thanks, John.

221
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,731
Let's go.

222
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:46,104
Moneu

223
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,738
lt's a gas

224
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:55,982
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

225
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:59,522
New car, caviar,
four-star daudream...

226
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,388
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

227
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,087
He was like Don Johnson.

228
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:05,186
Ou, ueah, from Brixton.

229
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,357
Yeah, what the hell do uou know
about Brixton, eh?

230
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:16,405
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

231
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:17,999
What's this, what's this?

232
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,981
Who the hell are these guus?

233
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:27,444
Heu<i>!</i>

234
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,611
Take uour hands off the wheel.

235
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,346
Steve<i>!</i>

236
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,658
Don't even think about it--
just do it.

237
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:40,896
No, no, no, no,

238
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,160
-no, no, no, no, John.
-Steve,

239
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,166
what the hell are uou doing?

240
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,600
Made a few plans of mu own.

241
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,273
There's nowhere uou can go
where we won't find uou, Steve.

242
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,274
You know that.

243
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,571
l think that's probablu right,
John.

244
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,178
Go<i>!</i> Go<i>!</i>

245
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,577
Charlie.

246
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:44,622
We got to go, Charlie.

247
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,101
You alwaus work in the dark?

248
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,837
Makes me feel like l'm alone.

249
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:16,145
Not bad.

250
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,909
Not bad, Stella.

251
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,745
Damn. Hurleu couldn't
crack that safe.

252
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,046
Neither could Spears.
Now uou know

253
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,051
who to call first.

254
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,087
You're expensive, Stella.

255
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,918
Those guus cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

256
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:27,718
Good will, communitu service.

257
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,885
l do it for the moneu, Oaul.

258
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,451
l'll be sending uou a bill.

259
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,327
Don't uou want to see
what's inside?

260
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:34,422
l never look inside.

261
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,094
Have a good dau.
Heu, George.

262
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,192
Hi, Stella.

263
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,171
l came, l saw, l kicked some ass

264
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,402
The pain l cause,
it makes me laugh

265
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,137
'Cause the wau l do mu thing
is strange

266
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,907
Time, time for this girl
to sing

267
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,710
Damn if l thought
that uou would change

268
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,944
And mu life would stau
the same

269
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,418
Things will come
and things will go

270
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,820
And one thing l know
for sure

271
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,849
ls that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

272
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,520
l'm walking out the door

273
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:07,827
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

274
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,662
Oh, it's time...

275
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:14,103
How long to crack it?

276
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,572
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

277
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,573
Oh<i>!</i> You're the man.

278
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,631
What's on the lineup?

279
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,836
Todd Milliken called.

280
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,435
He has a prototupe
combination lock.

281
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:22,844
He wants uou to test out.

282
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,040
He saus he added

283
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:27,084
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

284
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,915
l'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

285
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,112
give him a thrill.

286
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,418
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in uour office.

287
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,719
Saus uou two know each other.

288
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:41,530
Charlie Croker.

289
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,124
Heu, Stella.

290
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,128
Didn't l tell uou l never
want to see uou again?

291
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,771
l think it was when uou told me
how mu father died,

292
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,276
right in front of uour eues,

293
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,210
after uou pulled him
in for one last job.

294
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,641
We found him, Stella.

295
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,450
He's in Los Angeles.

296
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:05,580
The gold bricks he stole from us

297
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,988
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

298
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,286
l just got word,

299
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,725
from a contact of mine
called Skinnu Oete,

300
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,126
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buuing those bricks.

301
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,824
Yeah?

302
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,263
Well, how do uou know it's him?

303
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:19,059
Skinnu Oete sent me this.

304
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,298
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

305
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:29,277
Whu uou telling me
all of this?

306
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:31,542
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

307
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,174
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

308
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,684
delivered to his home office.

309
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,186
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

310
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:37,846
unless uou've got something
reallu big to guard.

311
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:38,911
No, uou don't.

312
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:39,922
The problem now is no one

313
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,253
in mu crew
can handle Steve's safe.

314
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,419
And l need somebodu
l can trust.

315
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,087
Look, l'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

316
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,425
l'm not a thief.

317
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,363
Heu, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okau?

318
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,661
John was like a father
to me, too.

319
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,635
Look, l'm sorry, all right?

320
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,642
l just can't move on until
l've set things right.

321
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,282
l've moved on.

322
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,075
Come on, Charlie.

323
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,175
Come on.

324
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,387
Hello?

325
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,324
l want to see the look
on that man's face

326
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:24,725
when his gold is gone.

327
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,959
He took mu father from me;
l'm taking this.

328
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:33,436
She's in.

329
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,132
That's a good thing?

330
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,264
lt's a very good thing.

331
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,206
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

332
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,766
l'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

333
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:40,902
a good idea, Charlie.

334
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:41,910
She's got the skill

335
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,105
and she's got the motivation.

336
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,614
Exactlu.

337
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,910
She's emotional.

338
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,212
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

339
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,844
Look, don't kid uourself,
all right?

340
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,320
We're all emotional on this one.

341
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,619
Let's go.

342
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:55,215
Are uou readu?

343
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,385
Of course l am.

344
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,555
You're not readu.

345
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,316
That was quick.

346
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:28,450
Where are theu?

347
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:29,720
We're a little earlu.

348
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,388
l didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

349
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:34,623
There.

350
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,757
That's Lule.

351
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,461
He's mu computer genius.

352
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,941
You know, he's who reallu
invented Napster.

353
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,408
At least that's how
Lule tells it.

354
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:49,605
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

355
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,512
and stole his idea.

356
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:06,422
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

357
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,134
Heu.

358
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,196
Oh...

Yeah. Mm-hmm.

361
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,869
That's Left Ear.

362
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,945
Demolition and explosives.

363
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:23,946
When he was ten,

364
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,913
he put one too manu M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

365
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,612
Fire...

366
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,381
Whoa.

367
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,547
Yeah, that was cool.

368
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,817
How'd uou do that?

369
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:33,915
What?<i>!</i>

370
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,289

What?<i>!</i>

374
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,926
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

375
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,196
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

376
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,834
Handsome Rob.

377
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,966
Oremier wheel man.

378
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,440
Once drove all the wau
from Los Angeles

379
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,410
just so he could set the record
for longest freewau chase.

380
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,483
-You're a heartbreaker...
-You know, he got 1 10

381
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,921
love letters
sent to his jail cell

382
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,583
from women
who saw him on the news?

383
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,821
You're a heartbreaker

384
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,385
Dream-maker

385
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,395
Love-taker

386
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,489

Olease change them twice a dau.

415
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,651
We will get heat on line.

416
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,918

417
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,792
''James Humen?''

418
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,092
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

419
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,325
1 40 pounds? Try 165.

420
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,662
Try lifting some weights.

421
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,168
-Try lifting up these.
-Guus, enough.

422

423
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:27,670
Let's go.

424
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,831
Heu, Charlie...

425
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,938
Handsome, can uou help
him with the bike?

426
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,207
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

427
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,808
Like a sound uou hear
that lingers in uour ear

428
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:43,479
But uou can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

429
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,387
No, no

430
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,948
lt puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in uour mind

431
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:50,390
And uou can't go wrong

432
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:55,194
'Cause uou're groovin'
all dau long, ha-ha<i>!</i>

433
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,757
California soul

434
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,497
Ooh-ooh-ooh

435
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:04,564
California soul...

436
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,304
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

437
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,039
this joker picked Hollywood.

438
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:11,377
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

439
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,916
All right...

440
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,780
we need to figure out a wau
to get in Steve's house

441
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,581
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

442
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,781
l want audio surveillance
on his phone.

443
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,346
Oh, ueah, l been wanting
to try something.

444
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:21,858
l crack into the phone companu's

445
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,689
remote monitoring sustem,
and fool it into thinking

446
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:24,785
there's a legal tap on the line.

447
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:25,829
Just reroute the digital copies

448
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,364
of the calls to our own
listening post.

449
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,797
l been doing it
to mu ex for uears.

450
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,333
How long?

451
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,028
No-- how long will it take?

452
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,627
Not how long have uou
been doing it to uour ex.

453
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,433
l'll burn through the night;
l'll have it running bu morning.

454
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,638
Sorry l'm late.

455
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,507
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

456
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,240
Stella, how much time uou need
with the Worthington?

457
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,782
Five minutes flat.

458
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,317
Don't be cocky, uoung ladu.

459
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,512
lt's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

460
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,515
The perspiration
on uour fingertips,

461
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,057
uour heart's pounding
in uour ears...

462
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,183
whole different ball game.

463
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,728
l appreciate uour concern.
l'll be fine.

464
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,591
Look, just remember,

465
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,724
this is all the easu part, okau?

466
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,062
lt's the getawau
that can get us caught.

467
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,261
So what's the sketch?

468
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:06,360
We drive to Union Station.

469
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,235
Getawau car goes
right onto the train with us.

470
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:10,899
We need to know exactlu
how long it's going to take

471
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,033
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

472
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,238
Oh, great.

473
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,640
Carson Securitu Sustem.

474
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:48,576
How good is it?

475
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,307
Carson's held
an annual contest--

476
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,941
$50,000 to anubodu
that can bupass the sustem.

477
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,518
The Who's Who of ex-cons
alwaus show up.

478
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:58,749
Five uears running,
no one's been paid.

479
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,417
Okau, partu people,
here's the status.

480
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,789
lt's an anti-scaling fence.

481
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,828
lt's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

482
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,887
Yeah, l'm going
to have to paint that up

483
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,056
with some nitromin.

484
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,394
Securitu on the propertu?

485
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,832
Got an armed guard here.

486
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:11,891
Little rent-a-cop,

487
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,402
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

488
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,870
But that booth...

489
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,874
Securitu booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

490
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,307
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

491
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:21,504
l mean, that stuff's
prettu hard to come bu.

492
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,376
Yeah, Lule, it's a bear market.

493
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,910
Shit.

494
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:29,716
This dude got dogs.

495
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,584
l don't do dogs.

496
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:34,147
l had a...
real bad experience, man.

497
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,487
What happened?

498
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,757
l had a bad experience.

499
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,558
Damn it. l'm deaf.

500
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,942
You turn in uour badge

501
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,106

00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,485

l don't want to see uou

505
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,817
anywhere near
this investigation.

506
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,724
And turn in
uour badge and uour weapon.

507
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,726
l don't want to see uou

508
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,353
anywhere near
this investigation.

509
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,757
Heu<i>!</i> lt's a green<i>!</i>

510
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,394
Turn in uour badge

511
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,267
-Green<i>!</i>
-l don't want to see uou

512
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:22,067
anywhere near this...

513
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,669
Turn in uour badge
and uour weapon.

514
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,209
Unbelievable.

515
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,827
There he is.

516
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,241
Let's get to work.

517
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,714
lt's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

518
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,222
slit-uour-wrist traffic.

519
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,521
You know, five people died
from smoking

520
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,890
in between traffic lights todau.

521
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,895
You know, theu do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

522
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,260
You could alwaus use that.

523
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,457
That'd be ideal

524
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:23,466
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

525
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,662
What's uour guesstimate?

526
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,227
The last 20 times
l've done the journeu,

527
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,400
uou've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

528
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,409
but if we had green
lights all the wau,

529
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,069
we could do it in 1 4 minutes.

530
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,307
Wait, uou couldn't get
through traffic?

531
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:41,583
Whoa.

532
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,421
We could do anything
with green lights all the wau.

533
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,355
Lule?

534
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,257
Lule?

535
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,152
l'll see what l can do.

536
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,469
You're right on time.

537
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,539
All these poor bastards
out there,

538
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,373
putting their life
savings in banks,

539
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:10,380
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

540
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,712
How do theu think,
when the collapse comes,

541
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,546
theu can depend
on the government?

542
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:15,880
l don't think so.

543
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,317
Are uou taping me?

544
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,049
Of course not.

545
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,784
l never tape uou--
come look,

546
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:21,950
see for uourself.

547
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:27,556
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

548
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:31,123
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

549
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,295
Like mu cousin Mashkov

550
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,465
alwaus saus: ''This
is our onlu refuge, babu--

551
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,532
gold.''

552
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,743
Every time l look
at these engravings...

553
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:51,583
She's so beautiful.

554
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,748
Where'd uou sau uou got these?

555
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,950
l didn't.

556
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,856
A little walking around moneu.

557
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,078
l guess l'm not walking
as far as l thought.

558
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,113
l'm... sorry.

559
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,647
l can onlu buu two bricks
from uou todau.

560
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,615
-That wasn't the agreement.
-What can l sau?

561
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:20,945
l'm just middleman.

562
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,282
l'll buu the other two
from uou on Wednesdau.

563
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,821
Don't waste mu time, Yevhen.

564
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,967
So, what does a man

565
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,002
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

566
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,266
He watches his big-ass TV.

567
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,838
That's our in.

568
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,468
Stella.

569
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,437
Jesus<i>!</i>

570
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,269
Charlie<i>!</i>

571
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,774
How did uou get in here?

572
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,310
l knocked,
but uou didn't answer.

573
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,811
What-- so uou just
let uourself in?

574
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,108
l was just making sure
uou were okau.

575
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,478
l apologize. l just...

576
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,381
-l...
-Don't look.

577
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,021
Okau.

578
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,426
You got a lot of stuff here.

579
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,397
You know,
uour dad was old school.

580
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,365
Did the whole thing bu touch.

581
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,459
That worked for him;
this works for me.

582
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,505
Technologu guarantees speed
and accuracu, uou know?

583
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,063
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

584
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,644
Whu the headphones?

585
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,475
Just training muself.

586
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:59,175
Ambient noises, uou know,
just in case.

587
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,847
What do uou want, Charlie?

588
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:06,747
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

589
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,485
and we need to send in
a repairman.

590
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,925
To get uour video blueprint
of the interior.

591
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,426
Yep.

592
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,192
Onlu problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

593
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:18,661
Except me.

594
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:23,499
l'll do it, Charlie.

595
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:27,010
l'm in all the wau,
whatever it takes.

596
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,544
All right.

00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,103
l'll set it up.

598
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,273
Okau.

599
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,839
Um... uou, um...

601
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,610

602
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,625
l sh... l should finish
this stuff up, uou know?

603
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,752
Just get it all done tonight.

604
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,455
Yeah.

605
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,690
Sorry l scared uou.

606
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,767

Good night.

608
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:54,300
Bue.

609
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,965
And then he's just...
the media darling.

610
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:58,633
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

611
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:00,904
l should've been on the cover
of <i>Wired</i> Magazine.

612
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:01,909
You know what he said?

613
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,377
He said he...
he named it Napster

614
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,675
because it-it was his nickname,

615
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,739
'cause of the nappu hair
under the hat,

616
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,910
but he... it's 'cause
l was napping

617
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,920
when he stole it from me<i>!</i>

618
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:13,580
He didn't even graduate.

619
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,592
l think it's time to move on,
don't uou?

620
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,592
Theu shut him down.

621
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,630
l wish theu'd
do the same to uou.

622
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:22,825
Here... here we go.

623
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,299
Cable chick.

624
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:36,937
Becky.

625
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,606
Nice name... l wonder
what she calls

626
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,614
the other one.

627
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:40,945
And it's such a mustery

628
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,849
whu uou don't have
a girlfriend, Lule.

629
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,445
So, all we need is a...

630
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:46,784
service truck like that one,

631
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:48,848
a work shirt like hers.

632
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,258
You think Stella
can pull it off?

633
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,795
l have mu doubts.

634
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,990
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

635
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,964
You think he's...

636
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,470
mixing business with pleasure?

637
00:44:01,538 --> 00:44:03,768
He should know better.

638
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,468
Onlu l'm allowed to do that.

639
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,905
Right. Where uou going?

640
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,278
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

641
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,023
Are uou kidding me?

642
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,223
How does he do that?

643
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,266
How do uou do that?

644
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,562

Now, get somebodu up here,

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,791
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

701
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:21,262
You need to locate

00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,358
Okau.

Aston Martin Vanquish.

720
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:56,320
Looks like that bastard
took mu car.

721
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,793
Nastu-ass dogs.

722
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,595
Heu<i>!</i> Heu<i>!</i>

723
00:50:10,474 --> 00:50:11,532

Come on,
theu won't bother uou now.

726
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:19,241

Go on, get out of here.

729
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,618
lt's okau,

730
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:33,356
l'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on mu job.

731
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,029
Steve Frazelli.

732
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,102
Becky.

733
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,108
Want to show me that problem?

734
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,803
Yeah, of course.

735
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,106
This wau.

736
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,977
You have a reallu nice house.

737
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,313
Yeah. 1922.

738
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,978
All the original tiles.

739
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,646
Every stone in that courtuard

740
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,452
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

741
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,924
What a tactic.

742
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,290
Monastery?

743
00:51:04,361 --> 00:51:06,693
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

744
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,357
You don't seem impressed.

745
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:11,765
No, it's just that l don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

746
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,429
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

747
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,768
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

748
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,104
What does do it for uou?

749
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:22,441
Um... TVs?

750
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,241
l have a monster TV.

751
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:26,509
Not working right now, but...

752
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,278
But uou know, l should
probablu check out

753
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:29,943
the cable modem, uou know.

754
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,452
Yeah? Yeah, right.

755
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,988
Over here.

756
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:38,459
l paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this sustem in.

757
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:39,961
One dau, it just goes out.

758
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,659
l ought to have him strung up.

759
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:47,401
Here we go.

760
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,438
There's our babu.

761
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,963
We got him.

762
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,872
Got anu, uh, wiring
coming through here?

763
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,501
There's no wiring in here.

764
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:58,806
Just right here?

765
00:51:58,882 --> 00:51:59,814
Yeah.

766
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,680
Look at that, that's mu...

767
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,582
That's mu NAD T770.
That's...

768
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:05,587
That's mu stereo.

769
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,145
l bet most of uour customers

770
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:09,454
are prettu surprised when
theu go to open the door

771
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,084
for the cable man
and find uou standing there.

772
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:12,355
Oh, ueah.

773
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,294
He's hitting on her.

774
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,456
There's no problem here.

775
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:17,159
l should maube
just check the TVs.

776
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,499
Okau.

777
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,773
You know what,
end this shit right now.

778
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,773
l'm going to blow this shit

779
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,275
right off the mountain
right now.

780
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,312
No, no, no.
No, no, heu, heu, heu.

781
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,750

782
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,616
Onlu the best.

783
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,655
Check the box.

784
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:48,189
l'm just going to...
reset uour sustem.

785
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:52,133
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up uou know?

786
00:52:52,202 --> 00:52:53,837
That should do it.

787
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:55,804
lt's fixed?

788
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:58,306
Turn her on, let's see.

789
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,467
Now.

790
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,536
Japan's Nikkei index...

791
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,080
Oe<i>rf</i>ect.

792
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,408
...was the ending price

793
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:09,247
and as uou can see,
we've now gone below...

794
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,753
Becky, huh?

795
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:14,722
Have we met before?

796
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,918
...a loss of 1 .1 percent
on the...

797
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:18,756
No, l don't think so.

798
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,261
lf uou can just sign there.

799
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,656
So, if l was to ask uou
out to dinner...

800
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:25,394
would l be the first
one of uour customers

801
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,594
to ever do that?

802
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,696
What, uou asked uour last cable
repair guu out for a date?

803
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,764
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

804
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:32,933
had a handlebar mustache.

805
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,101
You know, not reallu mu tupe.

806
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,668
l don't think it's a good idea.

807
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,941
Whu, is that, like,
some, cable companu rule?

808
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,778
No, actuallu, it's just mu rule.

809
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:43,546
l don't go out
with strange men.

810
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,555
l just met uou five minutes ago.

811
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,057
So, l guess l have to, like,
sabotage mu cable, uou know,

812
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:50,956
till we get to know each other
well enough.

813
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:54,720
Have a nice dau.

814
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:56,732
Come on,

815
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,199
l'll be a pe<i>rf</i>ect
gentleman, l promise.

816
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,792
l won't even ask uou
for uour phone number.

817
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,893
l'll just... l'll meet uou.

818
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,462
Anywhere uou want to go.

819
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,476
Come on, break uour rule once.

820
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,274
lt's just dinner.

00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,809

Yeah.

824
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,130
He touched mu hand.

825
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:39,971
He came on to me.

826
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,780
Heu, at least l...

827
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,442
l created a window
of opportunitu, right?

828
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,283
When he goes out Fridau night,
we go in.

829
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,118
Bu the time he realizes
uou've stood him up,

830
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,953
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

831
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,857
Yeah.

832
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,554
Make sure uou shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

833
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,565
Heu, Lule,

834
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,897
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

835
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,231
Don't deal
when mu back's turned.

836
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,738
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

837
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,000
Lule<i>!</i>

838
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,304
He onlu answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

839
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,570
No.

840
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,771
l'm not calling uou The Napster.

841
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:18,074

Well, uou can call me
The Napster.
