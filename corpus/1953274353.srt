4
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,190
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,153
Tom, it's time for your daily reminder
.

6
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,317
Just start whenever you want.

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,671
My name is Tom Jacobs.

8
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,837
Born on November 2, 1972.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,635
My parents called Mark and Judith.

10
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,635
My wife's name is Abby.

11
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,719
I would do anything for her
voice.

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,429
I am a prisoner in
a homemade prison.

13
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,750
I'm bored again Minnie.
- What would you like to do now Tom?

14
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,837
Let's go somewhere.
- Move, six minutes to implement.

15
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,999
What now? He is there to do?

16
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,477
Well it happens.
He was very excited.

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,435
The end of living in garages
and beg for scholarships.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,552
Remember when I asked you first?
I said, "trust me they are going to pay."

19
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,070
And then you said that you had a boyfriend.
- I never said that.

20
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,510
Not true.
- Okay, I'm wrong.

21
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,432
What is it?
- Open it.

22
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,869
This we can not afford.
- Not yet.

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
But they will.

24
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,036
I want you to have it tonight.

25
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,596
I want you with me.

26
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,592
Both of you.

27
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,713
Five minutes Tom.
- We have an offer.

28
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,071
That is fantastic.
- Let's not get too excited.

29
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,910
They want to know how exactly the machine.
What about false memories?

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,398
The machine behaves like a polygraph.
It looks difference between real and fake.

31
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,553
It is difficult after a brain washing.
But I have a solution.

32
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,470
If the person is brainwashed and
he has a latent memory.

33
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,357
So hypnosis, cult stuff or something.

34
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,600
The machine checks that
first and if that is not there then the real memory.

35
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,473
Listen, the customer has an idea.

36
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Imagine that you can go to other people's memories
?

37
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,310
Why would you do that?
- Where do I start?

38
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:55,044
Control of abused children.
Alzheimer...

39
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:57,852
I'm glad you understand the function.

40
00:04:58,352 --> 00:04:59,990
Richard, I was clear about what I wanted.

41
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:03,873
I'm just saying.
- Sell my machine, nothing else.

42
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,111
I tried.
This is what they came up with.

43
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,869
Who came along then?
- Everyone.

44
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:17,890
You get the money you do not expect
unless you compromises.

45
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,434
If you just want to help people you
you just for free.

46
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,035
What do they offer?

47
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,712
It is unethical.
You built this machine to traumas to find.

48
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,116
That does not change, it still can.
- And that should you decide?

49
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,118
With the knowledge I have? Course.
- So it begins.

50
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,913
We burst of debt and
want a family.

51
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,396
It'll be okay.
- I deserve more than that.

52
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,439
Relapse occurs in three minutes.

53
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,035
I come to bring you money.

54
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,953
Enough to start?

55
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,311
Yeah, that's enough.

56
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,191
But who invest in this?
- Someone who understands the possibilities.

57
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,756
Remember that at the end of the day
you have the rights and control.

58
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,189
He has a few questions.

59
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,359
The machine I used seemed good.
Why we build a new one?

60
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,314
Upgrades. With the current program should
someone still send.

61
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,514
You should be able to go where you want
once you're inside.

62
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,838
So I dive in memory...
- Can you hear me, Richard?

63
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,113
Yeah, I hear you Tom.
- How it works?

64
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,596
No, memories are first sorted.

65
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,111
So we create a virtual command post
in the memory of the patient.

66
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,439
How should the starting point look like?
- Maybe like this place?

67
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,554
this house?
- Yes, until we have something different.

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,990
something more interesting?
- Yes.

69
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,551
I start the capture.

70
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,789
We need one voice.
- I can do it.

71
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,718
What?
- Why do not we a little style?

72
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,789
Maybe an actress hire?
Since they love.

73
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,674
Do you think my voice has no style?
- No.

74
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,500
How was that?
- Well, we go to the Z and then we're done.

75
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,112
How does it look?

76
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,993
Really attractive.
- I mean the voice Romeo.

77
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,793
Same there.

78
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,793
Your memory is completed, Tom.

79
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,189
Your memory is completed, Tom.
- Let's go.

80
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,599
So I'm at the start point and
I find a memory where I want?

81
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,110
And then I'm there? Is it that simple?
- It's so simple.

82
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,676
How far can you go back in memory?
- As far as memory permits.

83
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,271
Limits loom if you
on the border of memory comes.

84
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:46,045
The world consists of things that are unreal.
The machine generates them randomly.

85
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,314
Things and people.

86
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,355
Self leaves no trace behind.

87
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,917
Then the last question, how do we get out?
- The user makes out.

88
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,474
And if something goes wrong?

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,670
We're working on.

90
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,036
Minnie?
Destroy yourself please.

91
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,792
destruct in five, four...

92
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,435
three, two, one.

93
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,669
Goodbye Tom.

94
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,316
destruct failed.
Remember that I'm not evil.

95
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,159
Should I get a diagnosis?

96
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,791
How long have I been caught Minnie?
- Four years, two months, three days.

97
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,477
Are you ready?

98
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,998
I do not know if I have a life outside this place
.

99
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,877
Or anyone know that I'm alive.

100
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,872
Hello?

101
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,757
Honey, it's Richard.

102
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,599
Hello.

103
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,717
Tomorrow?
We would have six weeks Tom.

104
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,038
Our investors expecting now
some progress.

105
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,994
Think of everything we have not yet tested.
Dummy Memories.

106
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,112
Unknown faces.
- Use yourself.

107
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,869
Photos  then?
- Take something. Richard understands.

108
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,152
Okay, but I object. An official protest.
We need at least another month.

109
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,636
You protest is listed.
Let's begin.

110
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,433
Ready?
- Yes.

111
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,315
I love you.
- I love you.

112
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,595
you stay awake for me?

113
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,155
Where do you want it?
- Put it down simply.

114
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,115
What's this?

115
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,310
Who is your investor?
- It's complicated.

116
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,035
Make it easier than.
Who is that?

117
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,953
Arthur Kennison, from prison.

118
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,992
They want to memory
suspects go.

119
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,790
So you know whether they are guilty.
- Would willingly go?

120
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,152
No, if it works, it becomes mandatory.

121
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,273
Stylish 180-degree turn.
I can pack in ten minutes.

122
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,870
You drew my checks.
- I trusted you.

123
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,754
You did this for six months and you said nothing.
- I told you that someone sees what.

124
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,598
That's no lie.

125
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,110
I want to give you a chance.
- Nonsense, you give yourself a chance.

126
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,233
Okay, maybe I'm looking
to something important.

127
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,600
But you have to understand something.
You're not the only one who is working on.

128
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,353
You're the first
but how long will that take?

129
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,916
here I had another idea.
- Forget your ideas but.

130
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,873
It's all about control.

131
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,791
Think you can
take their money without consequences?

132
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,948
How long have you been at man?
Think about it.

133
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,913
Think about your family, Tom.

134
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,512
Mr. Jacobs?

135
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,555
Are we still doing this?

136
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,510
Let's begin.

137
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,193
Who we enter?
- We caught him recently.

138
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,713
His name is Anthony Willis.

139
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,072
His father is a murderer
for the Mafia, a zero.

140
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,953
What has he done?
- He's a junkie.

141
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,108
He was home and got an SMS from his
girl goes to her sister...

142
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,758
and kills her. Apparently.
He had a blackout, he says.

143
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,113
Take something meaningful out of his brains
and you have my interest.

144
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,317
Have you forced him to be here?
- Forced? No, he is pleased with the opportunity.

145
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,072
A perfect guinea pig.
Willingness and expendable.

146
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,829
It seems like a nice guy.

147
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,276
Just a sedative.

148
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,834
The process does not hurt.

149
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,591
Maybe not for me.

150
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,275
It's a wild state there.

151
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,154
It takes a few seconds.

152
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,195
Why we anesthetize him?
- It makes everything more stable.

153
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,514
We are ready.
I have the details needed.

154
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,949
If the program works
you must tell me now what happens?

155
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,279
You're looking for an exact data from millions.
I need something to start.

156
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,193
Okay, I accept that.

157
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,549
The boy's file.

158
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:38,829
Someone saw his car on a bridge near
of the crime scene at two o'clock at night.

159
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,356
hours after her death of these.

160
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,032
We searched the area and found
the murder weapon with his fingerprints.

161
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,034
Let's begin.

162
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,439
Okay, good luck.

163
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,429
Tom, can you hear me?

164
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,708
Tom, can you hear me?

165
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,109
Tom, can you hear me?

166
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,518
I hear you.
- Minnie, you hear me?

167
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,634
Welcome Tom. My name is Minnie.
What would you like to do?

168
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,834
Minnie show everything I see on the screen.
- As you wish Tom.

169
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,152
We see it clear.
- Beautiful.

170
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,832
Search memories with these words:
Adrienne, murder, Regan.

171
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,873
Search. A reminder
found with those words.

172
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,798
Minnie Take me there.

173
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,834
I am inside.

174
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,791
Adrienne, open up.

175
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,718
That does not look familiar.
- The machine fills the holes.

176
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,311
How long will it take before anything...

177
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,874
I'm sorry.

178
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,518
Minnie how much of this memory is real.
- Processing.

179
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,232
information about his youth is 17%.

180
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,272
Normal values.
And then his deeds?

181
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,392
95%.
- 95%.

182
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,075
Extremely large for a reminder.

183
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,192
Dad, something bad happened.

184
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,397
The memory is over, Tom.

185
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,592
that we had imagined.

186
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,316
He took methadone to self soothe
phoned his father and left.

187
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,398
So he lied about
not remember?

188
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,672
Perhaps unaware.
Junkies often have blackouts.

189
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,189
That explains why he
convinced that he is innocent.

190
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,909
I must say I am very impressed
, Tom.

191
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,032
Get me out of here now, Gary.

192
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,277
Goodbye, Tom.

193
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,957
What the hell?
- What would you like to do now?

194
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,675
Gary, I'm back at the beginning.

195
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,479
That's strange.
I try again.

196
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,918
Goodbye, Tom. Hello, Tom.
What would you like to do now?

197
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,033
It did not work.
- What happens?

198
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,749
What happens?
- The extraction does not work.

199
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,553
Restore.

200
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,194
A kind of misunderstanding.
He's working on it.

201
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,551
Tom, we will delete everything and
it out later?

202
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:06,357
But no "I told you so, when I'm out.
- Forget it.

203
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,951
Minnie, destroy yourself.
- Are you sure?

204
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,837
destruct in five, four, three, two...

205
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,554
. Goodbye, Tom.

206
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,714
When will he wake up?
- That would be. It is destroyed.

207
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,669
The chipset comes off the vessel.
Yes, it's gone.

208
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,997
Why is he still missing?

209
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,349
Tom, can you hear me?

210
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,798
Can you hear me, Tom?

211
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,437
You're not listening to me.
- I did not do it.

212
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,552
You had placed high.
You took the gun from her hand...

213
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,592
No, that's not true.
- Look, Anthony.

214
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,156
You love us for three days on the line.
Confess now but.

215
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,597
You grabbed the gun and shot her.

216
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,078
You have a visitor.

217
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,470
Hi, Daddy.

218
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,316
You are very skinny. Are you eating enough?
- Yeah, you know.

219
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,149
I wanted to give you this.
I took some photos when I was tidying up the attic.

220
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,828
Thank you.

221
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,359
They started a carpentry course
last week.

222
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:37,879
I've been there.
It's really interesting.

223
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,276
I imagine that I
outgrowth of a carpenter.

224
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,670
You look amazingly thin.
- Yes, I told you, Dad.

225
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,796
I use nothing if you think that.
They get nothing inside today.

226
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,230
you say that, Anthony...

227
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,635
What are you doing?
- Are you happy?

228
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,912
Take me not fool boy.
Your job is to clean up.

229
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,759
I've done that too.

230
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,189
you do not screw up.
- I give you my word.

231
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,073
Does that mean anything?

232
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,714
Not for me.

233
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,714
Always nice talking to you, Dad.

234
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,875
Sit.
Just sit.

235
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,879
Dad, how I let him down?
- I already told you, Anthony.

236
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,755
If you want him to sit then
push his butt down and repeat it.

237
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,673
Sit.

238
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,351
Boy, give me the 9/16 we go.

239
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,313
That's a 5/8.
- That's a 5/8.

240
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,914
Sorry.

241
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,879
That's it, boy.

242
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,959
We have a birthday gift for your mother
buy.

243
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,196
a car?
- A car?

244
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,312
Yes.
- Are you crazy?

245
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,912
How many times have I been in this memory?
- Al 430 times.

246
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,679
430 times.

247
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,397
to the music than.

248
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,798
What is the date anyway?
- 15 July.

249
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,992
We missed the fireworks.

250
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,272
Tomorrow we must find something to celebrate.

251
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,198
Picnic, barbecue?
What do you think?

252
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,075
I understand the question, Tom.
- No, of course not.

253
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,033
But I would like it.

254
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,233
Sit.

255
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,276
I've said 100 times that dog is stupid.
Give daddy a beer.

256
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,030
Minnie, was what the fuck?
He saw me.

257
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,994
That is not possible.
- Do not tell me that it can not, he saw me.

258
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,635
Look at me.

259
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,351
Thank you, boy.

260
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,797
Am I crazy, Minnie?
He saw me.

261
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,878
Your theory is impossible.

262
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,348
Close the memory and start again
before he asked for beer.

263
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,789
At the restart.

264
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,756
I've said 100 times that dog is stupid.
Give daddy a beer.

265
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,750
Look at me. Do you see me?
Anthony.

266
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,995
Thank you, boy.

267
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,669
He looked at me Minnie.
I'm sure.

268
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,479
The process is repeated three times.

269
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,637
Your theory seems to be impossible.

270
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,559
What was so special
with memory?

271
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,991
that particular time?

272
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,392
Minnie, what time was it when I said that
Anthony saw me?

273
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,318
I can see the exact time of
not currently determination.

274
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,551
No, the real time reality.

275
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,673
The time was 4:15, 15 July.

276
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,032
I want you to show what Anthony
at that exact moment did.

277
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,436
scanning short-term memory.

278
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,634
Look.

279
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,798
He sees me, right?

280
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,470
The lights are about five minutes.

281
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,071
You were thinking of that memory.

282
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,113
You thought of the memory,
at the same time I in you.

283
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,595
active memory.
So he saw me, Minnie.

284
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,635
I can not verify your theory, Tom.
- You do not.

285
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,910
ANTHONY'S PICTURES

286
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,436
I have to meet him again.

287
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,909
Minnie, I need to see the memory
most used.

288
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,759
I can not recall memories
by frequency of use.

289
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,475
and frequency of words?
Something he thinks a lot.

290
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,672
In a therapy session, for example?

291
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,598
Search.

292
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,837
I think about it all the time.

293
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,553
I was with a friend.

294
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,351
A part-time dealer, Eric Lowe.
A strange type.

295
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,711
Take me to that memory, Minnie.

296
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,308
I desperately wanted a shot.

297
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:54,513
I needed money and I knew only
a place where I could get.

298
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,950
How long should we wait?

299
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,550
I need the car back to my brother
, otherwise he beats me rotten.

300
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,397
There he goes.
- Are you sure he's in his pocket?

301
00:31:04,844 --> 00:31:06,298
He comes from his accountant.

302
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,428
What the fuck is that?

303
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,599
you rob him with your shoe?
- Give me that.

304
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,837
Fuck.
- Give it to me.

305
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,070
Get it.

306
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,112
Asshole.
- Calm down, chief.

307
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,073
Let's do it.

308
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,753
Give your money.
- Do you know who robbed you?

309
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,158
No, why do not you tell me?

310
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,149
Do not make me have to
cut, old man.

311
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,673
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

312
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,102
I want to see your face,
before I shoot off.

313
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,695
Dad.

314
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,035
Daddy?

315
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,196
That day haunts me.

316
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,119
How low can a son fall?

317
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,198
Then I thought Adrienne.

318
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,029
And the person I could be without my
under the control of the stuff I.

319
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,076
Despite the evidence, my past.
The police and my own father.

320
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,228
I see myself not.
Not against her.

321
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,397
Nobody can see except me.

322
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,198
If no suffering.

323
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,798
I do not deserve it.
- I give it, because I want you deserve.

324
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,232
see it as a contribution
to the 'new' you.

325
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:04,309
You are at the end of this
remembrance come, what do you do now?

326
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,238
We wait here.

327
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,238
Keep repeating this reminder,
until he shows up.

328
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,794
How long have I been here, Minnie?
- Two weeks, Tom.

329
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,518
You can see me.

330
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,835
You can see me, right?

331
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,953
you recognize me?
My name is Tom Jacobs.

332
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,203
Minnie, you see this, I'm not hallucinating?
He hears me.

333
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,276
Talk to me, I know you can hear me.
Talk to me.

334
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,270
What?
- Enough.

335
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,756
What? Talk to me, what did you say?
- I said enough.

336
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,553
What the hell
you on?

337
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,913
What are you doing, Tom?

338
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,633
We wait.

339
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,679
Welcome back.

340
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,354
Can you hear me?
- Yes.

341
00:36:56,403 --> 00:36:59,312
Well, that's great.

342
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,956
It is very important that you understand everything,
what I'm saying.

343
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,232
I've been here four years prison.

344
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,434
My wife's name is Abby Jacobs.

345
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,438
I can still remember her
phone.

346
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,349
If you want me to leave here, then
you call her and tell where I am.

347
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,109
She was suspicious, so I'll tell you everything,
what to say to her.

348
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,711
If we lose another way, then come back
to this place, because I will wait.

349
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,388
okay?
- Yeah, I was just lost in thought.

350
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,956
I hope you're not wrong idea.

351
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,038
But this is our third date.
Maybe it was not a good idea.

352
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,153
No, I've just had a rough day.

353
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,035
Do you understand me?

354
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,954
know what?
Let us arrange another time.

355
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,789
I look at my work schedule and
call you then.

356
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,832
That sounds fine.

357
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,270
Hello?

358
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,631
Am I speaking with Abby Jacobs?
- Yes, I speak it.

359
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,995
My name is Anthony Willis.

360
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,634
Can I help you?

361
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,354
I have with your spouse spoken.

362
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,233
creep.

363
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,156
If you think you're funny, let's see if
police also found.

364
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,829
Your father died of a heart attack,
when you was 23.

365
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,118
Tom was your friend.

366
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:26,155
You could not bear how your dad
a chest covered, so you ran to the beach.

367
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,878
Tom came to you and wanted
not leave when you asked.

368
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,232
You hid under the sheets and he talked
against you until the sun went down.

369
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,148
During early that morning he
you to marry.

370
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,995
And you told him that he
the worst timing ever.

371
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,594
And you asked him why he
a scatterbrain like you wanted to marry.

372
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,431
And he said he took what he could get
, as long as you but was.

373
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,473
If only the smallest part.
That was enough.

374
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,557
I saw the whole conversation.

375
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,028
I can see everything you've done
seconds earlier, in the short term memory.

376
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,196
She believed you.

377
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,551
Which means they will come,
to talk to you.

378
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,150
There are still a few things,
you should tell her.

379
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,190
I think I know what went wrong
that day and how we can solve.

380
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,993
I know everything about you.

381
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,710
You played football as a child.
You were at your uncle named.

382
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,593
Your friend gave you your first painkiller,
when you were only 14 years old.

383
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,917
I have the best and the worst of you
seen.

384
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,229
I've seen your crimes.

385
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,079
But I also regret seen.

386
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,636
This is your chance to do the right thing.

387
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,112
Will you help me?

388
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,190
You think I want you hanging around?

389
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,794
I want to believe you.
I really do.

390
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,303
Maybe there's another way
to explain what you know.

391
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,770
So I have a question.

392
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:44,117
If you really can talk to him,
then you can answer this.

393
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,800
What do you know?

394
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,791
His nickname for me.

395
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,515
You have five minutes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

396
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,317
Are you still there?

397
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,908
I can not just talk to him.

398
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,918
We
a place where we meet.

399
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,158
I'm sure his memory now
runs, give me an answer.

400
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,990
He can see us?
- He can see what I see.

401
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,552
This is his daughter, Donna.

402
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,990
Take me to the meeting, Minnie.
- Localize.

403
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,159
Can you see him or not?
- I see him yet.

404
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,274
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
- Wait.

405
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,917
If you tried to make me stupid
happen, then you are successful.

406
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:33,444
Wait, give me a second.

407
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,196
Birdie.

408
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,353
He calls you Birdie.

409
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,716
reminder that I can live forever.

410
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,195
Okay, write this down.

411
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,835
If I'm still here, that means,
that the chip is still inside you.

412
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,589
I think the self-destruction
the chip is damaged.

413
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,195
I have searched and he was gone.
- Not everything, according to Tom.

414
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,791
Why was it not seen on the scan?
- It only responds to the metal parts.

415
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,195
prototypes of my chips,
are made of silicon.

416
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,232
The new ones are made of monocrystalline,
why you saw them.

417
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,989
In my haste, I have the scanner
never reprogrammed.

418
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,278
It had taken just minutes.

419
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,558
It's not your fault.
- And now what?

420
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,689
I have permission to Tom
from the hospital to pick up.

421
00:44:44,175 --> 00:44:45,840
Anthony And then?

422
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,350
Richard.
- Richard?

423
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,917
He can still help me with the prison
paper.

424
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,271
Abby, it's Richard.

425
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,437
I've just spoken to them.

426
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,159
He must stay here.

427
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,636
I could not get out.
- Does that mean it's over?

428
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,594
I said I could get him out.
- I do not understand.

429
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,834
I even have my priorities.
I send you his information.

430
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,653
Mr. Kennison?
- There's nothing I can do, sorry.

431
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:25,400
push him into a corner, because there will be nobody else
for your husband fight.

432
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,200
I own a farm near here.

433
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,465
I would order a transfer questions...

434
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,436
and some guards who managed to keep their mouths
.

435
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,273
If I just was motivated.

436
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,473
What do you mean by that?

437
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,070
machine, Mrs. Jacobs.

438
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,829
What do you think about him
to give me?

439
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,072
I understand that this is a difficult decision
for you.

440
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,630
Then you know me yet.

441
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,920
the Rule.

442
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,429
I must be honest.

443
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,712
It's hard to unwind
when I know you're watching.

444
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,638
gets you out, you promise that you
some things for yourself.

445
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,797
You can feel lonely in the cell.

446
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,790
I do not want people to judge me
.

447
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,593
I hate this place.

448
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,277
Shall we choose another place?

449
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,198
Come with me, wimp.
- Nobody's stopping you.

450
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,198
So you keep
just sit and do nothing?

451
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,392
Maybe I have just sitting here,
while I look at you.

452
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,557
Okay.

453
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,718
Last chance .

454
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,199
Come, wimp.

455
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,031
Come in..

456
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,038
That was long.

457
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,834
Nice place.

458
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,554
We came here,
whenever we could.

459
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,797
I think we now
four months together.

460
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,109
Have you been here before?

461
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,879
That's hard to say.

462
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,516
My memory is cloudy.
I do not know what to me, or your hear.

463
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,034
This is definitely mine.

464
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,118
This is a...

465
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,038
better place.

466
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,470
you remember the last time,
that we met?

467
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,751
You said it would not hurt.

468
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,792
Since then I have pain.

469
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,720
Why did you do that thing built?

470
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,031
I do not remember.

471
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,197
I guess because I wanted to help people.

472
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,554
So they deal with the past could come
and their traumas could handle.

473
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,433
world a better place.

474
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,597
That sounds like a cliché, right?

475
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,954
Somewhere along
I've lost my focus.

476
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,796
It was less about what I could give
and more about what I could get.

477
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,514
Do you regret it?

478
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,835
every day.

479
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,509
You can not change the past.

480
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,036
Maybe you do next invention?

481
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,919
I definitely buy a ticket.

482
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,313
I'm going tonight.

483
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,830
They let me leave this place.
- Just like that?

484
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,349
Where fuck are you going?

485
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,075
They bring me to a place
before surgery.

486
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,158
They say it's painless.

487
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,432
Computers and machines will
the most work.

488
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,550
I must stay overnight
and the next day I can go again.

489
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,070
If he tries anything, we're outside.

490
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,474
And then what?

491
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,109
A transfer to another prison.
- Great.

492
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,118
That sounds great.
- That guy needs my help.

493
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,879
I've already told you years ago that you
not to join that program should do.

494
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,879
I tried to prove my innocence.
- Your innocence?

495
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,770
That night you called me,
you told me everything.

496
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,600
You remember that maybe not, but I do
.

497
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,039
Dad, something bad happened.

498
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,436
I had to pick.

499
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,823
I watched my son a
overdose had in the back...

500
00:50:33,065 --> 00:50:35,060
while I was tidying up his mess.

501
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,117
I kept my mouth shut,
against the police for you.

502
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,756
You're right where you are now.
And now they bring you to an unknown place.

503
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,077
I will not use again.
- Do you believe it yourself, Anthony?

504
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,637
There is only a weak moment and you need
lapse into your old habits.

505
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,638
I try to do the right thing.

506
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,197
You have in your whole life
never done properly.

507
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,574
And now you're mad, right?

508
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:05,090
And I'm a bad father,
because I do not believe you.

509
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,231
I have saved more than I can count.
But I'm done, Anthony.

510
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:15,754
You may hate me, but all I
've done, I've done for you.

511
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,950
Do you still you're innocent?
- Yes.

512
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,236
Prove it.

513
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,631
He was right.

514
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,110
What is that thing?

515
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:56,109
This is what I need to build.
Each chip has a source frequency.

516
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,438
And this send a signal every second,
to that frequency to intercept.

517
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,666
If we are connected to the signal
Tom, then we need you...

518
00:52:04,012 --> 00:52:05,765
to tell us in what he's
memory.

519
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,112
Tell him that he should stay.
Then we filter that memory by the device.

520
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,754
We bring the body of Tom
inside and do the swap.

521
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,077
Are you sure it will work?
- I think the same chance of success...

522
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,715
but it's the best chance we have.
- How long?

523
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,554
We begin within one hour and
whole process will take about four hours.

524
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:27,758
Basically what it will take longer.

525
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,237
What do you mean?
- You need me.

526
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,189
I have a request for Tom.
I know that he can see.

527
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,954
Tom, I have good cooperated
do not you think?

528
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,714
I want something from you.

529
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,565
I want to know what's on the night of the murder
happened.

530
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,637
I've seen what happened.
You killed your girlfriend.

531
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,753
There is more happened than I
my own life saved by the police.

532
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,314
I want proof.
I want to prove that they were wrong.

533
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,398
We do not have time for.
- Then it time.

534
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,189
I first want to know if he has listened
and agree.

535
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,914
So Tom...

536
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,553
I await your answer.

537
00:53:19,136 --> 00:53:22,776
You lied to me.
You want me here for the rest of your life I?

538
00:53:22,811 --> 00:53:25,853
You killed her, is not that enough?
- I'm not a murderer.

539
00:53:25,945 --> 00:53:31,350
Start with her.
- You were angry and you let her suffer?

540
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,472
I thought you could see everything?
- Acts, no emotions.

541
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,276
So you see only a picture book.
You do not know what they meant to me.

542
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,595
You can not bluff.
You're not an angel.

543
00:53:41,861 --> 00:53:46,509
Every time you hurt someone,
or threatened, I saw it.

544
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,030
That his actions.
- Who has not done bad things?

545
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,914
You only know my past.
I know my suffering.

546
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,530
Really, who are past do you?
Of the person against whom I talk...

547
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:58,618
or the person with
the needle in his arm?

548
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,399
The police and your father think you've done
, even I think you did.

549
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,035
So we have it all wrong?
The evidence is wrong? I'm wrong?

550
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,039
You did it, Anthony.
So what's the point?

551
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,850
The point is that something else
happened that night.

552
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,552
There was another man
and I want to know who he is.

553
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,888
A random memory search,
is looking for a needle in a haystack.

554
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:26,965
I'll tell you everything I
can remember, I will lead you.

555
00:54:27,398 --> 00:54:29,592
Even if there was someone else, then you have
still killed her.

556
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,393
not accidental.
Not in self-defense.

557
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:37,196
Create the resource if the goal is horrible?
- For me.

558
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,154
you think there is no price
for your freedom would be, Tom?

559
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,512
I would have thought
that I was dealing with a decent man.

560
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,717
Well, we all make mistakes,
not true.

561
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,316
Maybe I
for people like you a guinea pig...

562
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,230
but now you do what I say
because I'm the only chance you get home.

563
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,993
You have until tomorrow morning
before being transferred.

564
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,557
If you want my help, you must first
help me.

565
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,668
Abbey, there is a small delay.
You do not have to worry.

566
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,758
Is Tom there?
- Yeah, he's about an hour.

567
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,173
Good. Stay there and I'll call you when it
again goes smoothly.

568
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,833
Let's begin.

569
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,996
Tell me about Adrienne.

570
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,554
Everything you know.

571
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,671
We had two year relationship.

572
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,997
She was not really easy.
From the beginning not.

573
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,636
Family Problems.
Suicide Attempt 16.

574
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:00,792
When we first met, she
by me to the hard stuff.

575
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,312
In the beginning we klooiden but what.

576
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:11,191
But then... She was my whole world.

577
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,592
And I wish we stopped
because we were killing each other.

578
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,358
But she could not.

579
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,795
matter how hard I tried, I could not help her
.

580
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,872
And one day she just left.
She did not say why.

581
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:39,593
She took her phone anymore.

582
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:43,633
And then I became
in a downward spiral.

583
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,873
And the next time I saw her, she was dead
.

584
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,315
We have a signal.

585
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,989
We are waiting only for you two.
The clock is ticking.

586
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,317
You said there that night
something else happened?

587
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,954
Tell me everything you can remember
.

588
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,677
Minnie, get ready for this
to locate.

589
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:25,557
I remember I woke up in the
bath after I heard broken glass.

590
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,918
I had a bottle of pills and had beaten back
Adrienne's gun at me.

591
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,477
I've got a splitting headache.
Do not know how long I was unconscious.

592
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,874
The house is unknown to me.

593
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,150
I remember that pictures
the chimney stood.

594
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,070
In the guest room was a sofa and a TV
. Do the program stops.

595
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,278
And on the bookshelf stood a clock.
I heard noise. Turned around.

596
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,875
Blackout.

597
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,173
I did not even have time to
my pistol draw.

598
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,919
Minnie, put the attacker down.

599
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,035
Alternates.

600
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,234
Everywhere alternates. The memory
true but for 5%. Nothing contextueels.

601
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:43,593
You do not even know who or where.
- But the memory is real?

602
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:49,392
Yes.
- Then you have to keep digging.

603
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,760
Come to it.

604
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,759
Look again.
- Is three times is not enough?

605
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,237
Everywhere alternates. Even the magazines.
The attacker is a dead end.

606
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,796
There is simply not enough.
What do you want me to do?

607
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,196
I never said anything about magazines.
- Does not matter.

608
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,834
They were there. You remember them,
just not what they were.

609
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,713
Now that you mention it, I remember them
me. They were porn magazines.

610
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,799
No, that I had seen. You are
confused by another reminder.

611
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,875
Is that so?

612
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,239
Minnie, how accurate is this picture?
- 100%

613
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:09,589
Reminders. That you learn
during your PhD.

614
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,553
You have a seven course meal.
You remember nothing.

615
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,626
But when I say that you had steak,
you remember that you also had potatoes.

616
01:00:15,726 --> 01:00:20,074
memory unravels.
You just need a little helping.

617
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,035
Anthony, this is not enough.
You must share with me your thoughts.

618
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:27,475
We must do this together.

619
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,797
So sit here and concentrate.

620
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:42,718
I tell you everything I see
and you have something to teach.

621
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,752
It's all there.
I just bring it forward.

622
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,997
The first thing is...

623
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,311
This was not a porno mag.
What was it, Anthony?

624
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,797
It was about tattoos.
The rest also.

625
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,514
Right. Good.

626
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,313
There was suddenly something else visible.
A purple bottle?

627
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,115
A perfume bottle.
There were many at that sink.

628
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,239
Good.
What color was the carpet, Anthony?

629
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,794
Red, I think. Or Orange.
- No, it was red.

630
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,309
The towels also.
Red and black.

631
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,194
And part?
- A drawing of a train.

632
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:25,312
shower curtain. That is the first
what I say. It was weird.

633
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,830
There was a strange pattern.

634
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,996
Stains.

635
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,796
Indeed. The whole bathroom was clean.
Everything fits together.

636
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,257
You remember.
Let's see what else you remember.

637
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,957
Minnie, do me the pass rates.
- Memory, 25% accurate.

638
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,639
Anthony, here's something. A photo
in the hall. It is a drawing.

639
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,752
Soldiers.

640
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,872
35% accurate.

641
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,869
Anthony, there is now a whole new room.
- There is a pink towel on the bench.

642
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,073
photos on the wall. A hat.
A coffee table with a book on it.

643
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,158
bookshelf. The TV is on.
- There are cartoons.

644
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:19,033
Anthony, the clock changes the time
ever.

645
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,913
What time is it, Anthony?

646
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:28,234
Come on. Think. What time is it?
- 1:35 pm.

647
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,628
Minnie, set this reminder
again.

648
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,910
Anthony, if you do all those little things
can remember...

649
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,752
I'm sure you also remember the great
.

650
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,357
why he was in her house?
- No idea. But the memory is real.

651
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:17,553
And the time. The cop said
when she died.

652
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,080
What if he did?
- Anthony, I saw you do it.

653
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,430
Maybe you're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

654
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:27,552
I did my part,
now you must do your part.

655
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,434
Tell him
Garrett that I will wait for our meeting.

656
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,679
A deal is a deal.

657
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,994
I'm gonna pee.

658
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,557
Can I get one of those?

659
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,595
Throw the gun away.

660
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,079
Give me the keys.

661
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,798
Anthony, do this well.
They'll come after you.

662
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:04,151
If you die, die Tom also.

663
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,471
Come on, Anthony. Where are you?

664
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,197
I'm coming

665
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,314
Sodeju.

666
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:40,637
Since when are you free?
- Not very long.

667
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,230
Come.

668
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,030
Seems like an eternity ago.

669
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:59,153
Want a oppeppertje?
It's free.

670
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,996
Very funny, asshole.

671
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,918
You were that night at Adrienne's house.

672
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,749
I do not know what you're talking about.

673
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,312
Do not tell me that with her sister was
on the night she died.

674
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,353
Look who has everything reminds.
- Why did you kill her?

675
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,436
You're insane.
- Do not lie.

676
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:33,115
I did not kill her.

677
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:37,392
I was there but I did not do anything.

678
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,114
When I walked in, she was already dead.

679
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,119
I heard footsteps and I
hid. And then I saw you.

680
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:48,518
a gun.
I panicked and hit you down.

681
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,633
The cops have never questioned me.
What was I supposed to do?

682
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,719
Why were you in her house?
- Why do you think?

683
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,670
She would never start with you.

684
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,835
you think?

685
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,596
corpse why you so frightened?

686
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:19,430
She is by you started it.
Because of you, she had come to me.

687
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,109
What do you mean?

688
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:29,270
We had some sort of agreement.

689
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,711
I gave her drugs
and they gave me what I needed.

690
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:43,393
Guilt.
Why she broke up with you.

691
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:47,729
She wanted to tell you really like.

692
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,557
But you know what I think?

693
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,752
I think you that night
drove to her house.

694
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,833
Truly a twisted mess.

695
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,550
I think she told you everything.

696
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,274
And why did you shoot her mess.

697
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,272
I'm sorry.

698
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,115
not move.

699
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,235
Give me that gun.

700
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,913
All this over a girl.

701
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,316
I thought we were friends.

702
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,432
What do you do now?

703
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,190
The cops call.
- You can not come here.

704
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,433
He's right, you know.

705
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,353
What's this?

706
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,472
Listen.

707
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:21,714
Should you feel any better,
they really wanted to quit. Really.

708
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,675
The problem was that it was my drug.

709
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:30,918
I told her that if she ever
would break our agreement...

710
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,952
that I would shoot her through her head.

711
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:40,113
So thank you my dirty work
have been refurbished.

712
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,995
Minnie,
locate everything what is happening now.

713
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,155
Minnie?
- My name is Minnie. What would you do?

714
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:11,676
I said,
locate everything what is happening now.

715
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,712
to locate.

716
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:29,750
Subject  damaged.
- Why did you do it?

717
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,838
I was so close.

718
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,916
I was almost there.

719
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,474
System Fault.

720
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,068
Talk to me, coward.

721
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,071
Look at me.

722
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,839
You gotta get me out of here, Anthony.
There is something wrong with Minnie.

723
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,076
You promised.

724
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,555
What you gonna do now?

725
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,875
Look at me. What will you do now?

726
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:33,788
I'm going to do what's best for me.

727
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,032
Your prototype still works, right?
- Yes.

728
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:47,715
I can go to your apartment. To your wife.
They can do it if you let me explain.

729
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:53,278
Tell me everything.
Let's do this.

730
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,072
early withdrawal

731
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,515
Ready. What now?
- He said he would wait for me.

732
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,154
Pull it out on my signal.

733
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,558
Can you see him?

734
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:33,749
I lost him.
- What do you mean, you lost it.

735
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,754
I do not see him.
Tom, where are you going?

736
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,668
Why am I here, Minnie?
- I do not understand. Filtering...

737
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,473
not filter, Minnie.
I have to go to another memory.

738
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:51,799
Are you sure?
- Anthony, stay with me, okay?

739
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,469
Minnie, I still need a reminder.
Take me there now.

740
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:59,876
What would you do, Tom?

741
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,479
This is his daughter, Donna.
- I would live forever.

742
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,319
I know where he's going.

743
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,878
You have arrived.

744
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,274
Come on, Tom.

745
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,990
Stay with me, okay?

746
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,113
Hello, Tom.
What do you do?

747
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,152
Anthony, come here. Look at me.
Tell me what you wanted to do.

748
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,510
Come on, Tom.

749
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,200
Anthony, tell me what to do.

750
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,473
Are you there last?

751
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,236
Goodbye, Tom.

752
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:12,431
Can you take it?
- Do you sometimes somewhere else?

753
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,113
Last chance .

754
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,273
My name is Tom Jacobs.

755
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,230
Born on 12 November 1972.

756
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:59,117
My parents are Mark and Judith.
My wife called Abbey.

757
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,471
I would give anything to her
again my name hearsay.

758
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,553
My father fought in the war.

759
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:52,437
He did not believe in psychology...

760
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,671
or post-traumatic stress.

761
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,615
He always said that war
was just like going to the beach.

762
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,470
You'll come home with some sand.

763
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:17,115
This was on his 15th birthday.

764
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:25,748
Rex. I remember that dog as well.
It seems like mine was.

765
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,269
It was a show dog
that I had received.

766
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,472
Rex was a show dog?
Basel What now?

767
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,149
He could not even sit on command.
Pooped under the house. Chewed on the furniture.

768
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,477
You sound just like my son.
- What are you talking about?

769
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,870
I gave him away because another trainer
gave me a good offer.

770
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,788
I told Anthony that he did
difficult and the thing under pooped.

771
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:51,119
If your child says something often enough, he
believe.

772
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:55,392
That dog behaved badly.
Anthony saw it. I saw it.

773
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,355
Anthony saw nothing.
Rex was a great dog.

774
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,358
you remember that right?

775
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:09,431
You remember it right?

776
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:13,838
I grab another beer. You too?
- No, thanks.

777
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:18,953
Dad, what if I let it sit?
- Through repetition, Anthony.

778
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,878
If your child says something often enough, he
believe.

779
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,276
Anthony, I have so often said.
This dog is oerdom.

780
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,518
When it comes to brainwashing
the line is blurred, but I can work around.

781
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,757
What is brainwashing?
Hypnosis, cult programming.

782
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,954
Can it be defined?
Bad people you edit.

783
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:43,359
Maybe Anthony
poorly conditioned to think that his dog was stupid.

784
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,835
Sit.
Good.

785
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,873
You can make a thousand ways
manipulate.

786
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,117
Some are as innocent
as a father with his son talk.

787
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,993
Anthony could become convinced,
where one could still convince him?

788
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:00,430
From what the police said.
- Look what you've done.

789
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,599
To his father's disappointment.
- Does my word nothing?

790
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,271
What he could be more than you believe?
- I'm sorry.

791
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:25,507
I can not be part of your life
.

792
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:40,076
I'm sorry.

793
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,153
We received an anonymous tip. Someone saw
his truck stop on a bridge...

794
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,710
near the crime scene
around two o'clock in the morning.

795
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:21,592
You gave the anonymous tip.

796
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:26,581
You have that letter, right?
- What are you talking about?

797
01:19:26,681 --> 01:19:28,715
not play games with me.

798
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,632
You set him up
so what do you know?

799
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:36,514
That does not matter anymore.
- Yes, for me it out.

800
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,996
Anthony has called you that night.
What did he tell you?

801
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,430
Yeah, he called me up.
but what he stammered.

802
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,659
Sounded like another lie.
Addicts who lie simply.

803
01:19:47,759 --> 01:19:49,675
How could you? It was your son.
- There was no sensible word out.

804
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,713
So you protected yourself?
- I protected him.

805
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:59,392
It was a matter of time before
they would find him dead somewhere.

806
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:03,322
When he awoke in the morning
and said there was nothing he could remember...

807
01:20:03,422 --> 01:20:07,715
when I took my decision
and I set him up.

808
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,032
When I came out of jail,
I kicked the habit.

809
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,953
Do you have a child?

810
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:20,397
Yes.
- What would you have done?

811
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:26,792
Guilt is a powerful thing. It is imperative
. It is an obsession.

812
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:29,593
And you have a choice.
Whether you keep it down...

813
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,909
or you can change.

814
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:41,951
I think she thought she
neither of them could do.

815
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,460
Experimental project
is further put.

816
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,712
What if he can convince the people actually
it works?

817
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:05,870
I do not know why I let you go.
Fixed force of habit.

818
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,594
I understand.

819
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,757
What is this?

820
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:20,910
Sometimes you just
a familiar voice.
