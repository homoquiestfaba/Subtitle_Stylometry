1
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:19,066
I got you! You better run!

2
00:01:23,966 --> 00:01:25,366
I got you now!

3
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,066
Come on!

4
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:01,366
Gillian!

5
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:08,866
What? What?

6
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,066
Do it again!

7
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,366
...a whole lots of money

8
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:15,966
I don't need

9
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:18,366
A big, fine car

10
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,466
I got everything
that a man could want

11
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,166
I got more

12
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,466
Than I could ask for

13
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,666
Daddy, could you
turn it down a little?

14
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,266
I don't have to run around

15
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:33,666
I don't have to stay out all night

16
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:37,266
Ooh, when my baby
kisses me

17
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:38,966
Chills run up and down...

18
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,766
- Daddy, can we just turn it down?
- When my baby...

19
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:42,966
Exactly!

20
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:46,366
I have been getting this all summer.
You have to stay on the island.

21
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,766
How many times are you gonna say that?
I've been back three days.

22
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,966
So I'm insecure.

23
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,166
You've spent the whole summer away.
School starts in two weeks.

24
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:58,466
I gotta know whether I should be
shopping around for a new best friend,

25
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:03,666
and Mr Wacko up there is your father.

26
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:05,866
- Hey!
- Here we go!

27
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,066
Son of a bitch!

28
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,666
Daddy!
You're in the wrong lane!

29
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:13,166
- Daddy, this really is not smart.
- I'm telling you, he's crazy!

30
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:15,266
- Would you pull over, please?
- What?

31
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,066
Hello! Hello, I'm over here!
I'd like to talk to you for a minute!

32
00:05:19,266 --> 00:05:21,966
This is a two-way street.
What's the matter with you?

33
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,166
Pull over!

34
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,166
Daddy!

35
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:32,066
- You oughtta yield!
- What's your problem?

36
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,666
My problem is you didn't yield.
You saw the sign.

37
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,366
What does it say?

38
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,466
- In the car, now!
- I was ahead of you!

39
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,466
Ahead of me?
He said he was ahead of me!

40
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,966
You could get arrested!
What's wrong with you?

41
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:45,266
- That sign said yield!
- Just get in!

42
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:47,566
- You were not ahead of me!
- Get in the car!

43
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:50,166
I'm sorry. He's just...

44
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,666
Rachel!

45
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:53,966
- We're late for Esther and Paul.
- Sorry.

46
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,566
- You're right, he didn't yield.
- He didn't.

47
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,366
Come on.

48
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,366
Who's gonna be brave, huh?

49
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:24,466
Go ahead. Don't be shy.

50
00:06:28,466 --> 00:06:30,666
Paul, come on, you gotta try this.

51
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,666
They say there's something spiritual
about feeding them in flight, but l...

52
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,966
I tried it.
One of them bit me in flight.

53
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,966
Don't believe them.

54
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:41,666
Stop. Come on.

55
00:06:41,866 --> 00:06:43,766
- I already pulled a muscle.
- Come here.

56
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,066
Here. Here we go.
Here, birds.

57
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,166
- No dinner, no TV.
- See if they take it.

58
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,866
- Here you go.
- Oh, great. Thanks, Esther.

59
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,766
- You tell her yet?
- Hey, what scared the birds away?

60
00:06:56,866 --> 00:07:00,466
It's the sound of your voice, Esther.
Are they skittish or intuitive?

61
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,666
- Tell me what?
- The complete truth.

62
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,666
He was supposed to fill you in
as soon as we left port,

63
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,166
but obviously he hasn't.

64
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:09,866
Those birds are rabid.

65
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,666
What? What?
What complete truth?

66
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:16,266
Well, you know, David's wife...

67
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:19,166
it happened, uh...

68
00:07:19,366 --> 00:07:21,266
- With the boating accident.
- Right.

69
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:34,966
Gillian, where you goin'?

70
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,666
Esther, would you please
translate for me?

71
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,466
She never listens to me.

72
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:42,066
Come on, Gillian, not funny.
Get down.

73
00:07:43,366 --> 00:07:45,266
Gillian, come on.

74
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,866
It's my birthday!
Let me have some fun!

75
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,866
It's your 35th birthday.
Grownups shouldn't be having fun!

76
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,066
Tell your mother
grownups don't scale things.

77
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,966
Grownups don't scale things!

78
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:58,866
Tell your father he's not my father!

79
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:01,266
He's supposed to be
my fun-loving husband!

80
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,666
This is incredible!

81
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:06,466
Mommy, please!

82
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:09,266
Paul, could you get her down?

83
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:13,766
Sure. As soon as
I unclench my fingers.

84
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:16,866
Mom!

85
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:19,466
I'm almost there!

86
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,766
Mom, you're scaring me!

87
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,666
This is so great!

88
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:25,766
You can come down now!

89
00:08:28,366 --> 00:08:30,566
Rachel, try again.
She'll listen to you.

90
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,866
Mom!

91
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,666
Mommy!

92
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:47,566
Mom!

93
00:08:48,866 --> 00:08:50,166
Gillian!

94
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,466
Mom!

95
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:01,066
Daddy?

96
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,266
Daddy?

97
00:09:15,766 --> 00:09:17,166
What?

98
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,966
What are you looking at?

99
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,966
What?

100
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,266
Oh... nothing.

101
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:26,566
Nothing.

102
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:30,166
Hey! Hey, the ferry's here!

103
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,866
See it, David?

104
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,366
Oh, great.

105
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:36,466
David?

106
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,566
He asked me to call him that.

107
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:43,366
I'm 16, Rachel.
Give it up a little.

108
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,366
Tomorrow is her birthday?

109
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,266
So this is two years to the very day?

110
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:52,766
We didn't even think of it
until three days ago,

111
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:55,666
and then we were afraid
that you might back out.

112
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:59,366
You are fixing me up with a man
on the anniversary of his wife's death,

113
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,666
which also happens to be her birthday.

114
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:04,166
I absolutely would have backed out.

115
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,866
- She's upset now.
- Thank you.

116
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,966
What do you expect?
I mean...

117
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,266
how could he have agreed to this,
for God's sake?

118
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,866
- Well...
- Oh, my God.

119
00:10:12,966 --> 00:10:15,166
'Oh, my God' what?
You mean there's more?

120
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,366
He doesn't exactly
know that you're coming.

121
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:20,866
Air.

122
00:10:20,966 --> 00:10:22,566
He doesn't know I'm coming?

123
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,766
He does in a way, because
we're always trying to fix him up.

124
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:29,866
He doesn't know we are bringing
someone on this particular trip,

125
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:33,166
but I'm sure that we'll all
laugh about it over dinner.

126
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:35,866
It's okay.

127
00:10:36,066 --> 00:10:38,566
Don't worry, it'll be fine.
We're already having fun.

128
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:39,866
This is great.

129
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,666
Easy, now. Here it comes,
straight down.

130
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:44,466
There you go. There we go.

131
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:53,966
- I see them. There they are.
- Hey, Paul!

132
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:55,366
Hey!

133
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,766
Aunt Esther! Hi!

134
00:10:59,966 --> 00:11:01,466
Hi!

135
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:06,566
Hey! You look great!

136
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,866
Oh, sweetie!
Oh, look at you!

137
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:11,466
Three days away from me,
already you look different.

138
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,866
No, I don't.

139
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:14,266
Hey, Muscles.

140
00:11:14,366 --> 00:11:17,466
Hey, Mr Cerebellum.
New toup?

141
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,466
Nah, it's the old toup.

142
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,266
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

143
00:11:22,866 --> 00:11:25,766
If we hustle, we can beat the traffic.
Is this all the luggage?

144
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,166
Hi.

145
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,066
Hi?

146
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:33,066
What do you mean, hi?

147
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,466
Who are you?

148
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,166
I'm leaving, that's who.

149
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:39,266
No, no, no, no.

150
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,466
David, meet Kevin Danford,
business associate.

151
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,266
She designs all our software,

152
00:11:44,466 --> 00:11:46,666
and she decided
to join us for the weekend.

153
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,866
Under extremely false pretences.

154
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,366
Kevin took one of your literature classes

155
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:55,066
at B.U. For one day, years ago.

156
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:57,866
- Talk about a small world, right?
- Years ago. Well.

157
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:01,866
Next, Woods Hole,
Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket...

158
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:04,966
Well, let's go.
Let's... let's go.

159
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:07,166
... departing in 45 minutes.

160
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:13,666
You knew.

161
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,666
I knew it was somebody
named Kevin.

162
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,266
I figured a fishing buddy.

163
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:20,366
- Paul doesn't fish.
- I thought maybe he started.

164
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,266
You think that's funny.

165
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,066
Just let me take the next boat back.

166
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,966
No, you're walking the wrong way.

167
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,266
This is going to be
a fabulous weekend.

168
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:32,866
You might think I enjoy carrying
the luggage, but you would be wrong.

169
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:35,266
I can't be both a bellboy
and a mediator.

170
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:36,866
We have a situation.

171
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:39,466
Did I tell you about this air,
or did I tell you?

172
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,266
I have been smelling.

173
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:45,066
You bottle it, you could take it home
and sell it, it's that good.

174
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:48,866
Come on, breathe deep.
In good stuff, out shit.

175
00:12:49,066 --> 00:12:51,166
Come on.
In good, out shit.

176
00:12:51,366 --> 00:12:52,966
Come on, Cindy!
In good...

177
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,166
Okay, all packed up, let's go.

178
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:00,166
Cool it.
And drive normal.

179
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:02,766
All right, Kevin, you sit in the front.

180
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:04,966
Could I just talk to you
for one second?

181
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,366
I can't get in the car
if you're leading me...

182
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:09,866
We have the potential
for a colossal disaster.

183
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:13,066
They're both alone,
so we arranged. End of story.

184
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,866
Look happy.
They're watching.

185
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,166
- Hello! Hi!
- Let's make the most of it.

186
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,966
- You're a negative person.
- That's another thing.

187
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,466
Don't trot out
your psychology platitudes.

188
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,966
Your training is in architecture.

189
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:28,666
These headshrinking seminars,
they're part of your midlife crisis,

190
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:31,566
and I hear you don't even
contribute to the class.

191
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:33,266
Who said?

192
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:35,666
- I've heard.
- Who said?

193
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,566
Come on!
You're holding up the fun.

194
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:39,766
Let's go.

195
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:44,866
Kevin, you get in the front seat.
Isn't this an amazing old car?

196
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,066
At least smile.

197
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:50,166
To reveal that you have teeth
might keep them distracted.

198
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,966
I am writing that one down.

199
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,366
This could get bumpy.

200
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:00,066
Everybody in?

201
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,366
Hey, slow down!

202
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:25,666
How about that ocean air?

203
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,766
He almost never crashes.

204
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:32,366
Bottle it, take it home,
and sell it, that's what I say.

205
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,166
What are you doing?

206
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:41,666
I was just noticing you've had
quite a developmental year.

207
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:43,766
You're gross.

208
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:06,166
Here we are. Everybody
gets to pick their own room.

209
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:08,066
First come, first served.

210
00:15:08,166 --> 00:15:10,266
- I wrenched my back.
- That air!

211
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:14,966
- Smell that island air!
- Enough with the air!

212
00:15:15,266 --> 00:15:18,366
Could I speak with you
a moment alone, please?

213
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,466
- Sure.
- Excellent.

214
00:15:21,566 --> 00:15:23,066
Oh, yeah. Hey, I gotta pee.

215
00:15:24,066 --> 00:15:27,166
- I'd like to hear this.
- Forget it, Cindy. Let's go.

216
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:29,666
Hey, you know, you may want to...

217
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,566
Paul and Esther,
they will grab the best room.

218
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,366
Look, I am very sorry.

219
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,866
I had no idea that this was
the anniversary of your wife's...

220
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:42,166
Oh, don't, please.

221
00:15:42,366 --> 00:15:45,866
And I had no idea that you
knew nothing about my coming.

222
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,666
I'm quite prepared to leave.

223
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,866
I don't know how they could
possibly think that this...

224
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,466
You're here.

225
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:56,366
Tomorrow we've got a big sand castle
competition at Jetties Beach.

226
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,066
I'm excellent at castles.

227
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,766
I do the whole bit...
pillars, balconies, columns.

228
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,766
Moats?

229
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:06,066
What have they been telling you?

230
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:12,766
They're acting friendly.

231
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,966
Come on, he was angry.

232
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,066
This is your most gigantic goof ever.

233
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:20,366
It's for his own good.
It's unhealthy, all this seclusion.

234
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,766
- It was his wife.
- She was my sister.

235
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,066
- Life goes on.
- Again with the psychology.

236
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,866
If he refuses to recognise that,

237
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:30,566
maybe we should have
Rachel live with us.

238
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,866
She only gets to be 16 once.

239
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:36,766
- She'll never get this year back.
- We are here to enjoy a restful weekend.

240
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:39,766
She's got college, SATs,
not to mention socially.

241
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,266
Must you always be
your complete and total self?

242
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,166
What?

243
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:49,366
That's two.

244
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,866
I'm writing down two.

245
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,366
- Didn't I tell you?
- No, no, no, no.

246
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,166
No way.
You are not wearing that.

247
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,666
We both are.
I got one for you too.

248
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:09,966
Oh, my God,
look at your breasts!

249
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,066
Wonder Top. Cleavage.

250
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,566
I'm not going out like that.
I'm not gonna do it.

251
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:18,466
At some point in your life,
you are going to have to trust me.

252
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:22,366
And this is that point? While you're
wearing electric blue rectal floss?

253
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,766
Your diaphragm covers more than that.

254
00:17:24,766 --> 00:17:28,066
When we learn to deal with men,
we gotta practice on the boys,

255
00:17:28,366 --> 00:17:31,966
and this is how we
tease them with the goods.

256
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:35,866
- Now, let's practice our walk.
- Our walk?

257
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:38,366
Oh, yes.
The walk is very key.

258
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:41,066
And it's all hips, like this.

259
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,766
Oh, my Lord.

260
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:47,266
I am not doing that.
No way am I doing that!

261
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:52,266
We gotta own the beach, Rache.
The walk is ownership.

262
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:54,666
- I don't want to walk.
- At least slow down.

263
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,466
- We're barely moving.
- You're 39, I'm 42.

264
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,666
I only have sex by appointment.
Even then, it's with Esther.

265
00:18:00,866 --> 00:18:02,666
Why do you do that,
all the putdowns?

266
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,966
- We don't really mean it.
- It gets boring.

267
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,066
Being caustic pre-empts kindness,

268
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:10,066
which is important since kindness
could lead to more sex,

269
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,366
and it is exactly how you picture it.

270
00:18:12,566 --> 00:18:14,266
- Let's stop.
- What's the matter?

271
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:18,066
Don't you think it's insensitive,
fixing me up on her birthday?

272
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,366
Gillian has no more birthdays, David.

273
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:26,766
I'll bear that in mind.

274
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,566
- It's not natural for a man...
- Nature's the goal?

275
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:32,366
Most mammals mate for life.
For life! That's nature.

276
00:18:32,566 --> 00:18:35,766
Some species, the surviving mate
remains faithful and monogamous

277
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,166
even after the mate has died.

278
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,366
Let me renew
your subscription to Nova.

279
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:42,566
I don't have to stand for this.
I can outrun you.

280
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:43,666
Oh, yeah?

281
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,766
He goes out there every night.

282
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,666
- Thursday, he was out all night.
- Doing what?

283
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,866
Staring at the ocean, I guess.

284
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,266
Is it, like, a sickness?

285
00:19:09,366 --> 00:19:12,566
In your psychology classes,
do they have a name for this?

286
00:19:12,866 --> 00:19:15,966
Oh, yes. It's...
he's nuts.

287
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:25,066
He will be all right. It's just...

288
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,966
He really loved her.

289
00:19:35,366 --> 00:19:36,766
He's not the only one.

290
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:39,866
I know.

291
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:54,066
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:57,666
You're probably beginning to notice,
I never leave.

293
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,266
Why is that?

294
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,666
I live next door. My parents are away.
I'm orphaned here for the weekend.

295
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,466
You know about this weekend?

296
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:11,466
Oh, yes. It's, um...
an anniversary.

297
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:15,166
Not just that.
It's the anniversary.

298
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:17,766
Dress-up dinner,
castle-building, karaoke.

299
00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:19,666
Gillian started it.

300
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:23,366
You know, they choose stupid songs
you'd never admit to liking.

301
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,766
- They what?
- A lot of Barry Manilow.

302
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:29,166
Weekend tradition.
This is the Gillian weekend.

303
00:20:47,766 --> 00:20:51,166
You've got a cute way of talkin'

304
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:55,666
You got the better of me

305
00:20:57,766 --> 00:21:00,666
Just snap your fingers
and I'm walkin'

306
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:04,966
- Like a dog hangin' on a leash
- What, are you kidding?

307
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,366
- This is your song?
- Yeah, so?

308
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,166
You're supposed to choose
songs you're ashamed of.

309
00:21:10,366 --> 00:21:12,466
This is a classic!
I love this song!

310
00:21:12,566 --> 00:21:15,566
You make me feel like dancin'

311
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:17,466
I want to dance the night away

312
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,466
You make me feel like dancin'

313
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,266
I want to dance the night away

314
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:25,566
You make me feel like dancin'

315
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:30,566
- Come on, let's go again.
- No, I don't really wanna.

316
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:34,866
- Oh, you look fabulous.
- I know.

317
00:21:35,066 --> 00:21:36,466
Might want to lose the gum.

318
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,166
Or not.

319
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:44,566
He's not gonna fall for you.

320
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:47,766
Live people
can't compete with dead ones.

321
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:49,866
Ask anybody.

322
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:50,966
Thank you.

323
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:01,266
I don't think so!

324
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,266
I feel like dancin'

325
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,666
Dancin'

326
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,366
Dance the night away

327
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,266
I feel like dancin'

328
00:22:15,466 --> 00:22:16,666
Dancin'

329
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,766
I'm sorry, we were, uh,
we were just practicing for karaoke.

330
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:30,266
Sorry to intrude. I heard the sound,
couldn't quite believe it.

331
00:22:30,466 --> 00:22:31,666
We're sorry.

332
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,366
Me too. You know what?

333
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:35,766
I miss Esther.

334
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:38,166
Sugarplum?

335
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,966
I think there's a plan
to give us private time.

336
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:44,766
The plan is to get me over Gillian.

337
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,266
It's been two years.
I'm not over her.

338
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,166
I see.

339
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,866
You can relax,
'cause if it makes you feel any better,

340
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,666
you're not my type.

341
00:22:59,366 --> 00:23:00,566
Thank you.

342
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:05,666
Well... we'll see you at dinner.

343
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:06,966
Dinner, yes.

344
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:14,566
- Not too much.
- First off...

345
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:19,866
...I would like to toast us all
for looking so fantastic.

346
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,166
- Absolutely.
- Especially me.

347
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:24,766
It took me an hour to get into this dress.

348
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:28,266
And ten seconds for me to imagine
you out of it, Miss Teen Succulent.

349
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:31,066
- All right, glasses up.
- Sorry.

350
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:33,666
- To all of us.
- Cheers.

351
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,766
Ching ching.
Okay, I'm hungry. Let's eat.

352
00:23:37,866 --> 00:23:39,566
Rachel said you have a baby.

353
00:23:41,566 --> 00:23:42,766
You have a baby?

354
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:45,566
Yes, I have a little boy.
He's 3 years old.

355
00:23:45,766 --> 00:23:49,066
And why I'm not back home with him
right now completely escapes me.

356
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:51,566
If you don't mind my being
a nosy little bug,

357
00:23:51,766 --> 00:23:53,366
what happened to the father?

358
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,066
I mean, I know you're divorced.

359
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:57,166
He cheated on her, bad.

360
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:01,266
Rachel said.

361
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:10,066
Yes, my husband is out of the picture.

362
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,066
I have complete custody.

363
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:16,266
Completely out of the picture, David.

364
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,866
Did you hear that?
That's good news.

365
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:24,866
So, how come you don't have children?
Do you shoot blanks?

366
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:27,166
That's a personal question, Cindy.

367
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,666
I mean, if you really want to know...

368
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:32,466
Can I tell her?

369
00:24:33,266 --> 00:24:34,766
You might as well.

370
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,066
We were afraid that
they'd turn out like you.

371
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:45,266
You are such a child.

372
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,666
Who's helping me
with the castle tomorrow?

373
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:50,466
We've got to be on the beach
by 7 a.m. Judging's at 2.00.

374
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:53,466
7 a.m.? I thought we were going
to the cemetery tomorrow.

375
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:55,966
No time.
We've got to start early.

376
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:59,266
I want to beat Megan Weeks.
I've lost to her three years running.

377
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,066
She's ungracious, arrogant,

378
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,566
and this year, she's gonna gag
on the taste of unmitigated defeat.

379
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,566
She's 9.

380
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,066
This is my entry tomorrow.

381
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,166
As you can see,
I'm gonna need some help.

382
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,966
Here's an aerial view.
Could you get the end of this?

383
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:25,366
What?

384
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,066
You have blueprints?

385
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:29,966
Sure. This takes organisation.

386
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:33,466
Look at these columns.
They're Corinthian.

387
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,466
How long did it take you to do that?

388
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:36,666
Esther.

389
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:39,666
I don't know. Does it matter?

390
00:25:39,866 --> 00:25:41,866
- Does it matter?
- Pumpkin.

391
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,766
You're a professor of literature.

392
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:46,566
You spend your time
meeting with sand engineers?

393
00:25:46,866 --> 00:25:48,666
We build castles every year.

394
00:25:48,766 --> 00:25:53,166
Not with forklifts. You'll need permits
for that kind of construction.

395
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:55,066
What's the problem, Esther?

396
00:25:56,366 --> 00:25:57,566
Honeybuns.

397
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:00,366
Sweetcakes.

398
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:01,966
I'd like to know the problem.

399
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:06,566
No problem.

400
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:16,466
- I want to know the problem.
- You want to know the problem?

401
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:20,166
Let me see if I can
locate the problem for you.

402
00:26:20,366 --> 00:26:24,066
You're living on an island,
a practically deserted island in winter.

403
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:25,466
You're doing nothing.

404
00:26:25,566 --> 00:26:26,466
I'm writing a book.

405
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,466
What have you written?
Let me see.

406
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,866
I'm the only one who gets to read it.
Everyone else has to wait.

407
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:33,566
You're protecting him.

408
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:37,166
I'm not protecting him.
Don't be reading my mind, Esther!

409
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:40,966
Can't we once eat without having
a free-for-all? I can't stand it!

410
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,466
Butt your nose right in.
Stick it in snug.

411
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:46,366
Can we just regroup?
We've got a terrific soup here.

412
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:48,966
Come on in! Wreck my life!
It's only mine!

413
00:26:49,166 --> 00:26:50,466
It's been two years!

414
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:52,366
- Hey!
- Two years!

415
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,266
Listen to yourselves.

416
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,666
Can't we once not do this, one time?

417
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:11,066
Maybe you're not happy.
I don't know.

418
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:12,266
Or care.

419
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:16,066
But whether or not you're happy,
do you have to spoil our dinner?

420
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:19,266
My concern is for Rachel.
My unhappiness...

421
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,366
Honey. Sugar.

422
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:23,366
Stop calling me food.

423
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,166
This is not a stable home.

424
00:27:26,266 --> 00:27:30,266
She's living with a single parent
who's an unemployed recluse

425
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,866
who does nothing but plan
Corinthian sand columns.

426
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:36,166
You can talk to me about a lot of things,

427
00:27:36,266 --> 00:27:37,966
but parenting isn't one of them.

428
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,766
You don't know the first thing
about being a parent.

429
00:27:40,966 --> 00:27:43,566
Maybe it's time that I found out.

430
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:46,666
Maybe Rachel should come
and live with us full-time.

431
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:04,966
Rachel.

432
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:11,766
Do you want to live
with Esther and Paul?

433
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:17,066
No.

434
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:24,066
Well, there you go.

435
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,166
End of issue.

436
00:28:30,566 --> 00:28:33,266
You're not the first person
to lose someone you love.

437
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:34,966
This isn't original.

438
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:53,466
I'm going for a walk.

439
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,366
Well, they brought somebody.
A woman. Living.

440
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:24,866
Dead jokes. Funny.

441
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,966
They're all ganging up, Gilles,

442
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:30,066
sayin' it's time for me
to get over you and let you go.

443
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,566
You don't want me
to let you go, do you?

444
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,666
You can't ask me questions like that.

445
00:30:37,866 --> 00:30:39,266
Why not?

446
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:41,666
'Cause you know my wants.

447
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:44,666
Or what I say I want
is really what you want me to want

448
00:30:44,866 --> 00:30:46,966
'cause I'm here right now
only in your mind,

449
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:50,166
unless I'm real, which would mean
I'm kind of a ghost,

450
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:52,366
which I know
you don't want me to believe

451
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:54,666
'cause you hate the idea of being crazy.

452
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:57,166
- Why do you always do that?
- Do what?

453
00:30:57,366 --> 00:31:00,866
Fire back in rambling sentences
with compound thoughts to confuse me.

454
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,666
- I don't do that.
- You do.

455
00:31:02,766 --> 00:31:06,366
No, what you do is, you ask questions
you don't really want me to answer.

456
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,866
Whether I want to or not is moot
because you always dodge.

457
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:12,166
You did it alive, you do it dead.

458
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:14,466
Are you seriously gonna try
to outtalk me?

459
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:31,966
How's Rachel?

460
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,766
She's good, I think.

461
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:40,266
She seemed to have a good summer
with Paul and Esther.

462
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:45,566
The one rule we had
was she comes first.

463
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:47,266
We even stuck to that one.

464
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:51,766
- I know.
- She needs you to be there.

465
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:53,366
Especially this weekend.

466
00:31:54,766 --> 00:31:55,766
I know that too.

467
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:04,066
You're okay, Mr Man.

468
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,366
I miss you.

469
00:32:13,866 --> 00:32:15,166
You're okay.

470
00:32:19,366 --> 00:32:20,566
I gotta run.

471
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:22,966
Get back here!

472
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,766
Go play with the live girl!

473
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:25,866
Gillian!

474
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:29,566
Come on!

475
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:39,066
Hey, kiddo.

476
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:45,066
I heard you yelling.
Were you yelling at someone?

477
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:47,566
Just myself.

478
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:54,466
- You talk to her, don't you?
- What?

479
00:32:55,866 --> 00:32:58,766
Mommy.
You talk to her out here.

480
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:02,666
Oh, well, I talk to her all the time,
in my prayers.

481
00:33:06,866 --> 00:33:10,366
You talk to her like she's
right in front of you out here.

482
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,866
No, that's...

483
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:18,166
Well, sometimes
I fantasise about stuff.

484
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,966
What's with this book
that you're writing?

485
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:27,066
Well, you know, it's, uh...
you know, it's...

486
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,266
You know.

487
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,766
- A lie?
- Well, yeah.

488
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,366
Is everything okay?

489
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:44,966
We haven't really talked much
since you've been back.

490
00:33:46,266 --> 00:33:49,566
Yeah, it was kind of hectic
those three days,

491
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:51,366
what with just the two of us.

492
00:34:03,366 --> 00:34:05,166
Do I tell you I love you enough?

493
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,666
You know, I read these studies.

494
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:11,766
With teenagers, you're not supposed
to say it too much.

495
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,466
They won't hear it after a while.

496
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:16,566
If you say it too little,
that can cause harm too.

497
00:34:16,766 --> 00:34:19,166
Do I say it too much?
Too little? I...

498
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,866
I don't know.

499
00:34:25,966 --> 00:34:27,466
You say it the right amount.

500
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:44,366
Come back and make me your wife'

501
00:34:45,966 --> 00:34:48,866
And as he started to go

502
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:53,566
She said,
'Billy, keep your head low

503
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:56,366
'Billy, don't be a hero

504
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:59,066
Come back to me'

505
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:00,966
Paul, take it outside.

506
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,266
- As far away as possible, okay?
- Okay, okay, I'm finished.

507
00:35:04,466 --> 00:35:05,866
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

508
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,266
Next time you're gonna
have to pay for this.

509
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,666
- You out talking to him?
- Yeah.

510
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,166
How is he?

511
00:35:14,266 --> 00:35:16,566
He's fine.
He cooled off a little bit.

512
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:18,166
He's fine now.

513
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,166
What'd you talk about?

514
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,366
Esther, he's fine, okay?

515
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:24,566
Maybe you do butt in a little too much.

516
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,966
Well, I'm sorry, but sometimes
I get scared for him,

517
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,066
and I get scared for you too.

518
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,766
You can always tell me
to butt out, you know.

519
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,066
Yeah.

520
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:40,966
Just don't worry, okay?

521
00:35:41,866 --> 00:35:43,266
You don't have to worry.

522
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:48,566
What?

523
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:50,666
You tell me not to worry, but...

524
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,566
am I wrong to worry?

525
00:35:59,966 --> 00:36:02,966
I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

526
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:05,266
Good night.

527
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,266
Good night.

528
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:49,066
Why can't you sleep?

529
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:52,766
How did you know I wasn't sleeping?

530
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:56,166
When two people are together
long enough, they sense things.

531
00:36:57,366 --> 00:36:59,266
Plus which, you snore like an elk.

532
00:37:02,266 --> 00:37:04,866
I have a court appointment
Monday morning.

533
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,966
What do you mean
you have a court appointment?

534
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,566
Rachel shouldn't be
living in this situation.

535
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,366
You're going to a court of law?

536
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:28,166
No, it's a tennis court.
I'm gonna play doubles.

537
00:37:28,466 --> 00:37:29,566
What are you thinking?

538
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:31,966
She went from an A student
to C's and D's.

539
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,466
- Her mother died!
- No.

540
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,966
She still had A's the year after.

541
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,766
It was the second year
she started to bottom out.

542
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,966
It's not Gillian. It's him.

543
00:37:42,166 --> 00:37:45,166
Her guidance counsellor,
whom David doesn't even talk to,

544
00:37:45,366 --> 00:37:48,066
by the way, says that she's
retreating more and more.

545
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:51,166
She's been laughing and having fun
the last two months.

546
00:37:51,366 --> 00:37:54,566
- With us, but look at her here.
- She doesn't want to leave him.

547
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:57,966
Of course not. Of course
she doesn't want to hurt her father.

548
00:37:58,266 --> 00:38:00,666
But she's the one who's getting hurt.

549
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:05,366
He's done nothing to cause any judge
anywhere to take away his daughter.

550
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,366
- So we're supposed to wait?
- It's not your business.

551
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:09,366
- She's my sister's daughter.
- He's her father.

552
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,466
You're not her mother, you're an aunt,

553
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:15,466
an aunt who might want to be more,
but still just an aunt.

554
00:38:15,766 --> 00:38:17,966
You want to write that down? Fine.

555
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,066
Maybe that way you'll remember it.

556
00:38:23,666 --> 00:38:25,166
Don't do this, Esther.

557
00:38:27,466 --> 00:38:28,866
Don't do this.

558
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:33,566
I don't want to do it.

559
00:38:39,366 --> 00:38:40,566
Let's just...

560
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:45,266
Let's just see how the weekend goes.

561
00:39:06,066 --> 00:39:07,666
I got some more shovels.

562
00:39:21,466 --> 00:39:23,966
You know, now I see
why David had the blueprints.

563
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,866
- This is serious.
- Very.

564
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:28,566
They even come
from the Vineyard for this.

565
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:34,166
Now, this is Megan Weeks,
last year's winner.

566
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:37,566
Gee, Megan, what a lovely entry.

567
00:39:38,366 --> 00:39:40,466
I was thinking of adding another victim.

568
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:44,466
Charming.

569
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:51,866
Oh, my God!

570
00:39:52,166 --> 00:39:54,966
You madman!

571
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:58,766
Oh, tread softly, sweet maidens,
tread softly.

572
00:39:58,966 --> 00:39:59,866
Wow!

573
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:04,166
Esther, kiss the king!

574
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:09,566
Oh, I take it all back.
This is amazing.

575
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,566
I take it all back. You're a genius.

576
00:40:13,766 --> 00:40:14,666
Thank you.

577
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:16,566
Hey, what about me? I helped.

578
00:40:16,766 --> 00:40:19,866
You want credit? Last night I'm nuts,
now you want credit?

579
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:21,366
I provided moral support.

580
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:22,566
Hey.

581
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:24,566
This is really cool.

582
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,666
You may breastfeed the king.

583
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,866
And should there be any leftovers...

584
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:30,566
What?

585
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:41,166
We got 'em, see? They're looking.

586
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:42,566
Who's looking?

587
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:45,466
Boys. Men. Ignore 'em.

588
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:47,266
More hip.

589
00:40:47,366 --> 00:40:50,266
God, this thing is killing me.
My breasts hurt.

590
00:40:50,466 --> 00:40:52,666
Just own the beach, Rachel.
Can you do that?

591
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:55,766
Walk cool. Own the beach.

592
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,266
Hi.

593
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:00,166
The judging is over. You're free.

594
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:04,166
- Oh, thank God.
- Arise, arise, my liege.

595
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,066
Gimme your hand.

596
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,966
They'll announce in 10 minutes.

597
00:41:11,566 --> 00:41:13,366
- You okay?
- Let me get you a towel.

598
00:41:13,566 --> 00:41:15,266
- Hang on.
- Too much sun, maybe.

599
00:41:15,466 --> 00:41:17,266
Plus being buried.

600
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:20,366
- I'm a little light-headed.
- Sure.

601
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:23,966
You know, maybe it's just
thrill of the competition, huh?

602
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:29,066
Excuse me.

603
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,866
What are you lookin' at?

604
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:37,766
An act of God. Two acts.

605
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:41,766
- Turn around, you sweet things.
- Look at that.

606
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,266
Junior Mints.

607
00:41:48,266 --> 00:41:49,166
Oops.

608
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:55,966
Rachel! Rachel!

609
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,366
- Hi, Daddy.
- Never mind 'Hi, Daddy'.

610
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,366
- You're practically naked!
- What are you doing?

611
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:03,166
- I'm making you decent.
- I'm wearing a bathing suit.

612
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:05,466
Go away.
Please leave the premises. You!

613
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:06,466
Hi.

614
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:08,766
Put that towel on!
Put that on!

615
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:10,866
We're on a beach!

616
00:42:11,066 --> 00:42:12,966
Cindy, it's okay.

617
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:14,966
You're perfect, I want you to know that.

618
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,466
Don't you look at me.

619
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,766
- You're being ridiculous.
- What got into you?

620
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:23,266
Dad, what's the matter?

621
00:42:24,366 --> 00:42:25,866
Dad, what?

622
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,666
Gillian?

623
00:42:31,866 --> 00:42:32,766
Dad?

624
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:35,266
Gillian!

625
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:37,166
Daddy! Daddy!

626
00:42:43,766 --> 00:42:47,266
Wake up. Come on.
Come on, hey, wake up.

627
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:48,866
Open your eyes. Come on.

628
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:52,266
Come on. There you go.

629
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:59,066
You thought you saw Gillian.

630
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:05,466
- Daddy, are you all right?
- Yeah.

631
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,866
- He's okay.
- I'm fine.

632
00:43:07,866 --> 00:43:09,466
Too much sun. He'll be fine.

633
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:13,266
You won.

634
00:43:13,366 --> 00:43:15,766
Hey! You won, you won!

635
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:17,466
Can we just have a little room?

636
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,266
Back up. Give him some air.

637
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:22,266
Megan Weeks is crushed.
Her life is ruined.

638
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:25,466
Come on, Rache, he's fine.

639
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,566
He's not fine.
He thought he saw her.

640
00:43:29,266 --> 00:43:31,966
Maybe it was your bathing suit
that made him faint.

641
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:34,766
Speaking of which,
this is cutting off circulation.

642
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,666
It's lucky I don't pass out.

643
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:41,866
He screamed her name.

644
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:49,666
- Hey.
- Hi.

645
00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:53,366
There's this party tonight.
Supposed to be good.

646
00:43:54,566 --> 00:43:55,566
Wanna go?

647
00:43:57,766 --> 00:43:58,866
With you?

648
00:44:00,066 --> 00:44:01,466
Yeah.

649
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:08,266
Okay, sure.

650
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:11,566
I'll get somebody for you if you want.

651
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:16,366
I know how to snap my finger,
thank you very much.

652
00:44:19,766 --> 00:44:20,766
I'll pick you up.

653
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,166
8.30.

654
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,266
Great.

655
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:35,966
- I have a date!
- Yeah, I see.

656
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:37,266
Tonight!

657
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,966
I caught that too.

658
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:33,866
So, what's with the meditation?

659
00:45:34,066 --> 00:45:35,466
I have a date.

660
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:40,066
Dates scare me.

661
00:45:42,666 --> 00:45:43,866
Yeah, me too.

662
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:47,666
You must have been nervous
getting off that ferry.

663
00:45:51,266 --> 00:45:55,266
L-it was probably more terrifying
getting on the ferry.

664
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:58,266
By the time it docked, I'd...

665
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:02,866
Well, I-I wasn't nervous.

666
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:04,266
Why?

667
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:08,266
I don't know, really.

668
00:46:11,066 --> 00:46:12,966
This might surprise you,

669
00:46:13,166 --> 00:46:16,266
but I was hoping you and my father...

670
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:21,866
You don't even know me.

671
00:46:21,966 --> 00:46:25,166
Well, you seem to be on this planet.

672
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:05,566
You're gonna scare the fish.

673
00:47:05,666 --> 00:47:08,166
I'm sure what you're doing
puts them at ease.

674
00:47:11,366 --> 00:47:14,266
- Feeling better?
- Much.

675
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:16,466
Great.

676
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:21,266
David, we got a problem.

677
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,666
Esther's worried
about Rachel living with you.

678
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:25,766
How many times
are we gonna play that record?

679
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:27,666
It's gone beyond talk now.

680
00:47:27,866 --> 00:47:30,466
She's got an appointment
with ajudge on Monday,

681
00:47:30,566 --> 00:47:33,266
and I think she might
move for custody or something.

682
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:34,766
What?

683
00:47:34,866 --> 00:47:38,266
I didn't know this was coming,
I swear it.

684
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:39,966
She's going to court?

685
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:42,266
She doesn't want to,
and I'm sure it won't come to that.

686
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:45,666
I am telling you so you can
help yourself the rest of the weekend.

687
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,366
You've got to act normal...

688
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:51,166
you know, use a napkin at dinner,
try to breathe between sentences.

689
00:47:51,366 --> 00:47:54,966
If you see Gillian again, wave subtle.

690
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,866
David, this is dangerous and illegal.

691
00:47:57,966 --> 00:47:59,566
It's also very upsetting to me.

692
00:47:59,666 --> 00:48:02,866
I have a problem with high speed.
The speed concerns me. Please.

693
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:04,566
Then shut your eyes.

694
00:48:04,766 --> 00:48:06,766
I told you what I told you in confidence.

695
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:08,966
I hope you're not gonna barge in there...

696
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:12,666
Esther's planning to take my kid
and I'm supposed to keep my mouth shut.

697
00:48:12,766 --> 00:48:15,866
Broach it to her naturally
so she doesn't know I ratted on her.

698
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:18,466
'How are you? Nice dress.
Make any court dates? '

699
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:19,566
Shut up!

700
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:24,066
That was very helpful.
Slow down, please.

701
00:48:24,366 --> 00:48:25,566
Watch it! Jesus!

702
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:29,766
Just let me out of the car
right here. This is fine.

703
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:31,666
And you keep going into the trees.

704
00:48:44,866 --> 00:48:48,166
Esther, a moment of your time, please.

705
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:49,466
What's wrong?

706
00:48:49,466 --> 00:48:51,666
I need a moment.
Can I have a moment?

707
00:48:51,866 --> 00:48:52,966
Certainly.

708
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,366
Excuse me.

709
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:06,366
You come here under the guise
of a vacation weekend,

710
00:49:06,566 --> 00:49:09,566
and you have...
you plan to see ajudge!

711
00:49:09,766 --> 00:49:11,666
- Calm down.
- It's like what?

712
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,866
You're punishing me for hurting too much.

713
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:17,466
I shouldn't hurt anymore.
The statute of limitations has run out!

714
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:20,366
- Let me tell you why I feel...
- Does Rachel know?

715
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:24,166
No. She would never choose to leave you.
I'm doing it in her best interests.

716
00:49:24,366 --> 00:49:27,166
Rip her from her father!
That's her best fucking interest!

717
00:49:27,466 --> 00:49:30,866
Do you want an adult conversation,
or see how many times you can swear?

718
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:32,466
Fuck you. How many's that?

719
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,566
I was on that boat too.
You have no priority on this.

720
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:38,366
- My priority is my daughter.
- Then make her one!

721
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:40,366
I want you to get out of the house!

722
00:49:41,066 --> 00:49:42,966
I'm sick of you barging into my life.

723
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:46,666
If I hadn't barged in,
you wouldn't have a life, David!

724
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:49,466
I'm the one who found you, remember?

725
00:49:49,566 --> 00:49:53,166
I'm the one who barged in
after you gobbled all the sleeping pills.

726
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,366
Let's not forget that little trivia.

727
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,966
Took me a long time to like you, David.

728
00:50:05,866 --> 00:50:08,566
It's taken me even longer to care,
but I do care now.

729
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:12,166
If you want to throw your life
down the toilet,

730
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:14,866
I will cry for you
whether you believe it or not.

731
00:50:16,166 --> 00:50:20,066
But if you think that I would let you
take Rachel down with you...

732
00:50:22,166 --> 00:50:23,666
then you don't know who I am.

733
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:28,566
You have never made
the slightest effort to know who I am.

734
00:50:59,466 --> 00:51:00,966
- Hi.
- Hi.

735
00:51:12,266 --> 00:51:14,166
- Ready?
- All set.

736
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:22,266
- See you later, Daddy. Bye.
- Where you goin'?

737
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:24,166
Oh, I-I have a date.

738
00:51:24,366 --> 00:51:26,466
Didn't I tell you?
I-I thought I did. Funny.

739
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,966
Daddy, you remember Joey.
Joey, my father. Daddy, Joey.

740
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:33,066
- All right. Bye.
- Wait. You're going out with him?

741
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:35,366
Yeah, we won't be too late.
See you.

742
00:51:35,566 --> 00:51:37,066
Hold it.

743
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:41,666
- Do you take drugs?
- No.

744
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,166
How many holes do you have
in your ears?

745
00:51:45,366 --> 00:51:46,466
- Six.
- Nose?

746
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:48,366
Three. Four.

747
00:51:48,566 --> 00:51:50,866
'Night! 'Night!
'Night, 'night, 'night.

748
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,466
I'm gonna skip dinner.

749
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:01,666
Take a walk.

750
00:52:28,566 --> 00:52:30,366
Remember the meteor shower?

751
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,966
A certain daughter was conceived
under those stars.

752
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:39,166
I thought I saw you on the beach today.

753
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:41,366
It wasn't you, was it?

754
00:52:41,566 --> 00:52:42,566
No.

755
00:52:43,966 --> 00:52:46,066
I must have been hallucinating.

756
00:52:46,266 --> 00:52:48,466
It was different from the way
I see you here.

757
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,966
Who knows? Maybe they're right.

758
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,666
I am sitting on a rock, talking to a ghost.

759
00:52:59,066 --> 00:53:00,766
I could go.

760
00:53:00,866 --> 00:53:01,866
No.

761
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:09,266
I think I am in trouble.

762
00:53:10,266 --> 00:53:11,466
A little.

763
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:14,666
Why?

764
00:53:15,866 --> 00:53:17,266
I think maybe I'm sick.

765
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:21,166
I pretend I'm okay.

766
00:53:24,066 --> 00:53:25,166
Am I sick?

767
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:30,766
I always hated good dreams.

768
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:35,766
I-I couldn't take
the disappointment of waking up.

769
00:53:37,566 --> 00:53:40,666
And then I figured out a way to know
whether or not I was dreaming.

770
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,766
What are you talking about?

771
00:53:44,866 --> 00:53:49,366
I realised that in most of my dreams
I'd ask myself, 'Am I dreaming? '

772
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,766
I'd never ask that when I was awake.

773
00:53:53,066 --> 00:53:54,866
So I finally figured it out.

774
00:53:55,066 --> 00:53:58,066
If I ever wondered,
is this a dream or not,

775
00:53:58,266 --> 00:53:59,666
then I knew it was.

776
00:54:02,666 --> 00:54:03,766
You ever wonder?

777
00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:09,266
Don't leave.

778
00:54:11,766 --> 00:54:12,966
I'm not leaving.

779
00:54:33,066 --> 00:54:34,066
Joey!

780
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:39,666
- Hey, hey, Joey.
- Danny.

781
00:54:39,866 --> 00:54:40,866
Rachel.

782
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:42,766
- Hi.
- Hi.

783
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:48,066
Have some punch.
It's a vintage batch I made myself.

784
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:54,166
- Yuck.
- It's a zombie.

785
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:55,966
What's in a zombie?

786
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:58,466
Rum and stuff. It's good.

787
00:55:01,466 --> 00:55:03,066
I'll get some more.

788
00:55:08,766 --> 00:55:10,866
Would you try talking to him?

789
00:55:12,066 --> 00:55:13,866
You could be an objective voice.

790
00:55:14,066 --> 00:55:16,866
It seems no matter what I say, he just...

791
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:19,366
Maybe if you weren't so shy about it.

792
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:23,366
This isn't something I want to do.

793
00:55:23,566 --> 00:55:25,266
Then don't.

794
00:55:25,466 --> 00:55:28,866
A man shouldn't lose his daughter
for taking long walks on the beach.

795
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:32,366
- It isn't just that.
- Then what is it?

796
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:35,066
Is there something else
you're not telling me?

797
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:37,866
No.

798
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:41,266
Then I don't see his crime.

799
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:43,866
His wife is dead, and he doesn't
want to let her go.

800
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:48,366
My husband let me go
while I was still living.

801
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:50,666
I'd prefer to think he was crazy.

802
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:54,866
If you could just talk to him.

803
00:56:04,766 --> 00:56:07,266
And I hope you can hear

804
00:56:07,466 --> 00:56:12,166
What the words
and the music have to say

805
00:56:16,566 --> 00:56:19,866
It's so hard to explain

806
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:22,866
Everything that I'm feeling

807
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:27,666
Face-to-face,
I just seem to go dry

808
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:31,966
But I love you so much

809
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:33,866
That the sound...

810
00:56:38,466 --> 00:56:41,666
You know, I-I didn't get a chance
to sing my encore, so...

811
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:44,666
Where is everybody?

812
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:47,266
Well, uh, Rachel went out on a date.

813
00:56:47,466 --> 00:56:50,466
David ran away from home.

814
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:52,866
Kevin and Esther went looking for him.

815
00:56:52,966 --> 00:56:58,266
So that leaves just you, me,
and the moonlight.

816
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:02,766
Come on, let me inspect you
for tonsillitis.

817
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:05,566
Have you been pathetic your entire life?

818
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:08,266
Uh, not yet.

819
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:11,366
Come on, don't look at me like that.
You enjoy this banter.

820
00:57:11,566 --> 00:57:14,066
The bathing suits, the outfits,

821
00:57:14,266 --> 00:57:16,866
the hormone 'I am woman' strut.

822
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:19,766
But don't worry, you're safe.
I'm married to Esther.

823
00:57:20,066 --> 00:57:23,666
No, no, I'm safe, 'cause men like you

824
00:57:23,866 --> 00:57:27,566
never do anything except sit on porches

825
00:57:27,866 --> 00:57:30,666
and watch things and say things,

826
00:57:30,866 --> 00:57:32,966
but never do things.

827
00:57:33,166 --> 00:57:34,766
You think so, huh?

828
00:57:38,766 --> 00:57:40,766
You wanna kiss me?

829
00:57:42,466 --> 00:57:43,966
I beg your pardon?

830
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:49,866
We've been doing this flirting thing,

831
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,466
and you've been
staring at me since you got here.

832
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:55,166
You were practically drooling at the beach.

833
00:57:57,466 --> 00:58:00,166
I'm sure you must have thought...

834
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:03,566
what it would be like.

835
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,666
Maybe we should just see.

836
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:21,266
Maybe you should just...

837
00:58:23,966 --> 00:58:26,766
I don't know...
touch me a little.

838
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:34,766
Take a chance.

839
00:58:37,466 --> 00:58:39,066
Nobody has to know.

840
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:46,066
See?

841
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:51,066
Men like you just sit on porches.

842
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,366
They don't do anything.

843
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:27,566
Hello.

844
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,866
Nice night.

845
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:38,366
Does my apologising for all this
have any effect?

846
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:39,666
None.

847
00:59:41,066 --> 00:59:42,866
You think I'm a loon.

848
00:59:42,966 --> 00:59:44,366
Yep.

849
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:47,966
Anything else?

850
00:59:49,666 --> 00:59:51,966
No, that's it. 'Loon' sums it up.

851
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:56,866
You've got an opinion.

852
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,266
I'm a big boy.

853
01:00:02,566 --> 01:00:06,666
She was beautiful, exotic,
and she died young.

854
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:09,966
And you've maybe romanticised her
into something mythical,

855
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:12,466
into something she wasn't.

856
01:00:14,266 --> 01:00:16,266
I was with her for 18 years.

857
01:00:18,066 --> 01:00:20,266
There's nothing illusory about my memory.

858
01:00:22,466 --> 01:00:23,666
Just a theory.

859
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:40,866
He went out alone
on the beach again tonight.

860
01:00:42,866 --> 01:00:45,566
If life were like a big truck...

861
01:00:46,866 --> 01:00:48,966
what would be worse...

862
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:52,366
to get run over by it,
or for it to just pass you by?

863
01:00:53,666 --> 01:00:56,766
Like from the side of the road,
just, it passes you by.

864
01:00:58,266 --> 01:00:59,266
What?

865
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:00,866
A truck, Esther.

866
01:01:00,966 --> 01:01:04,566
If life were like a goddamn truck,
better to get run over or passed over?

867
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:08,466
You're standing by the side of the road?

868
01:01:09,566 --> 01:01:10,566
Yeah.

869
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,266
Do I get to drive the truck?

870
01:01:15,766 --> 01:01:19,266
It's a big joke, right?
Just forget it, all right?

871
01:01:19,566 --> 01:01:21,666
Forget it. Forget it.
It's fine, really.

872
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,066
If life were like a truck.

873
01:01:28,766 --> 01:01:30,466
- Hey, easy.
- I'm fine.

874
01:01:30,666 --> 01:01:33,166
I probably shouldn't have
had that second punch.

875
01:01:33,366 --> 01:01:35,666
And they were big cups too.

876
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:39,166
They were, like...
I bet they were, like, 16-ounce cups.

877
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:40,966
- They were big.
- They were huge!

878
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:44,366
Which means I had, like,
a quart of zombie, and that's a lot,

879
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:47,066
because I've never really
drunk alcohol before.

880
01:01:47,266 --> 01:01:50,066
I probably shouldn't admit that.

881
01:01:51,066 --> 01:01:53,566
Drink a lot of water and eat some bread.

882
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:55,866
You'll feel less sick tomorrow.

883
01:01:56,066 --> 01:01:57,066
Thanks.

884
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:01,066
- I had a good time.
- Me too.

885
01:02:02,366 --> 01:02:04,466
Maybe we can
go to a movie or something.

886
01:02:04,566 --> 01:02:07,266
- Now?
- Some other night.

887
01:02:07,466 --> 01:02:11,766
Oh, that'd be great.
I mean, that'd be really, really great.

888
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,666
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

889
01:02:15,866 --> 01:02:19,166
I am... so dizzy right now.

890
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:21,066
It's okay.

891
01:02:30,466 --> 01:02:34,366
That was my first kiss ever
using my tongue!

892
01:02:34,666 --> 01:02:36,566
I probably shouldn't admit that.

893
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:55,666
Oh! Oh, Daddy, hi.

894
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:04,866
Oh, I am so sorry.

895
01:03:05,066 --> 01:03:07,266
L-l... That's so unlike me.

896
01:03:07,466 --> 01:03:09,066
- Are you drunk?
- Oh...

897
01:03:09,266 --> 01:03:10,966
- You're drunk.
- I just...

898
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,066
You're drunk. She's drunk!

899
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:15,166
The cups were bigger than they looked.

900
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:16,966
They were big cups.

901
01:03:17,066 --> 01:03:18,666
Say goodbye to Joey forever.

902
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:21,266
Goodbye. Goodbye forever,
Joey. Call me!

903
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:23,066
Call me, okay?

904
01:03:25,366 --> 01:03:26,666
I said I was sorry.

905
01:03:26,766 --> 01:03:29,266
Get up to your room.
Stay out of this, Esther.

906
01:03:29,466 --> 01:03:31,966
And then what? You're gonna
come up and talk to me?

907
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:34,866
- Or are you gonna go and talk to her?
- Who?

908
01:03:35,166 --> 01:03:36,866
Do you know he talks to my mother?

909
01:03:36,966 --> 01:03:40,666
Every night he goes out there,
he has conversations!

910
01:03:40,966 --> 01:03:45,266
My mother appears,
and he swims with her,

911
01:03:45,566 --> 01:03:48,266
and they probably even kiss.

912
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:51,366
You were out there again tonight,
weren't you, Daddy?

913
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:54,266
You were out
in the water with Mommy.

914
01:03:54,566 --> 01:03:56,266
Weren't you?

915
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:58,266
I asked you to go upstairs.

916
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:12,866
- What did she say?
- Oh, she's drunk.

917
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:19,766
Does Gillian appear to you
out there on the beach?

918
01:04:24,966 --> 01:04:26,466
Yes, she does.

919
01:04:27,866 --> 01:04:29,366
You swim with her?

920
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:31,866
Yes.

921
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:34,366
Is she naked?

922
01:04:34,566 --> 01:04:36,666
It's all pretend.
I know it's pretend.

923
01:04:39,766 --> 01:04:41,466
You go out on the beach,

924
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:44,366
and you have imaginary
conversations with Gillian?

925
01:04:44,566 --> 01:04:48,166
- People talk to the dead all the time.
- But the dead don't talk back.

926
01:04:52,266 --> 01:04:53,266
David...

927
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,166
you're ill.

928
01:04:58,266 --> 01:05:02,166
People dream. It's normal.
People dream. They fantasise.

929
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:05,366
You screamed at her today.
What kind of a daydream is that?

930
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:06,866
That was sunstroke.

931
01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:09,566
David, don't you see what you're doing?

932
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:13,366
You're trying to deny she's gone.
That's why you won't go to the cemetery.

933
01:05:13,666 --> 01:05:14,866
I don't like cemeteries.

934
01:05:14,966 --> 01:05:18,766
You're carrying on an active
relationship with your dead wife!

935
01:05:18,966 --> 01:05:21,966
There's no rule saying
that love has to die too!

936
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:25,666
Oh, that's such poetic bullshit.

937
01:05:25,866 --> 01:05:31,066
Love is a feeling, Esther.
And if I feel it, it exists, it's real.

938
01:05:31,366 --> 01:05:33,266
Grief is a feeling too.

939
01:05:33,466 --> 01:05:35,066
I'm not grieving. I'm happy!

940
01:05:35,266 --> 01:05:38,266
When I go out to the beach
at night, God, I feel better.

941
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:41,066
I look forward to seeing Gillian.

942
01:05:41,166 --> 01:05:42,566
It makes me happy.

943
01:05:42,766 --> 01:05:47,066
It... it... it makes me
happy, happy, happy.

944
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:50,466
Well, I'm happy for you,
Mr Happy Happy Happy,

945
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,966
but it's not normal to be spending
nights with your deceased wife.

946
01:05:54,266 --> 01:05:55,966
You can't apply normal to me.

947
01:05:56,166 --> 01:05:59,266
Should I give up the happiness
I've found for normalcy?

948
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:03,166
David, you can't
keep living in a fantasy.

949
01:06:03,466 --> 01:06:05,766
Yes, it's a fantasy!
It's a fantasy!

950
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:09,266
How many normal married people
while making love to their spouse

951
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,466
pretend they're with somebody else?

952
01:06:11,666 --> 01:06:13,666
That's a fantasy.

953
01:06:13,866 --> 01:06:17,066
I have an emotional fantasy.
Why should I apologise for it?

954
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,266
Fine, just tell it proudly to the judge.

955
01:06:19,466 --> 01:06:21,666
How dare you do this thing?

956
01:06:21,866 --> 01:06:23,266
She's my daughter.

957
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:32,266
He's always running off.

958
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:40,366
Your goddamn sister
and my best friend Paul.

959
01:06:40,566 --> 01:06:43,266
How can they do this?
How can they do this?

960
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,466
Where's Rachel?

961
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:46,866
They don't know my life.
They don't know it.

962
01:06:47,066 --> 01:06:48,266
They don't know!

963
01:06:48,466 --> 01:06:50,566
I think they're upset now
because they do.

964
01:06:50,766 --> 01:06:53,066
Maybe you shouldn't have
told them you talk to me.

965
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:54,966
Oh, I'm not insane!

966
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:58,066
I don't go to restaurants
and order for two.

967
01:06:58,266 --> 01:07:00,566
When I go to the movies,
I buy one ticket.

968
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:03,266
- One ticket.
- I didn't create all this.

969
01:07:03,466 --> 01:07:06,366
I'm just trying to survive it.
I'm just trying to survive!

970
01:07:06,566 --> 01:07:09,466
I didn't climb the goddamn mast.
I didn't do that!

971
01:07:09,766 --> 01:07:12,466
- I'm to blame.
- Maybe you are. You were selfish.

972
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:14,966
- You didn't think.
- I was stupid.

973
01:07:15,666 --> 01:07:17,466
You're being selfish.

974
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,966
I screamed at you to get down.
I begged you to get down!

975
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:23,666
And who's up there now?
Who's the next to fall?

976
01:07:28,766 --> 01:07:30,866
I'm not helping you this way.

977
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:35,466
I'm not.

978
01:07:37,466 --> 01:07:38,966
Maybe I should go.

979
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:41,866
No! Don't, don't go.

980
01:07:42,066 --> 01:07:46,166
I think...
I think it has to be soon.

981
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:54,166
But not tonight, not tonight.

982
01:07:55,366 --> 01:07:57,266
I don't want to go.

983
01:07:57,466 --> 01:08:00,366
Do you think I want to be gone?
I don't want to be gone.

984
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,166
I don't want to be gone.

985
01:08:04,066 --> 01:08:07,066
Well, maybe if I go back to Boston,
you could be there.

986
01:08:08,366 --> 01:08:10,866
They've offered me my teaching job back.

987
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:12,966
When I come home at night,

988
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:16,166
you could be there like you are here.

989
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:19,266
I don't know.

990
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,466
I can't let go.

991
01:08:27,366 --> 01:08:29,166
Not yet, I can't.

992
01:08:29,266 --> 01:08:30,266
I can't.

993
01:08:32,566 --> 01:08:33,566
Okay.

994
01:08:35,866 --> 01:08:37,366
I stop this,

995
01:08:37,466 --> 01:08:41,066
then you're gone... forever.

996
01:08:43,866 --> 01:08:45,866
- I'm not ready.
- I know.

997
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:24,966
- Come on.
- What?

998
01:09:24,966 --> 01:09:26,466
One night like it used to be.

999
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,266
- What?
- One night.

1000
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:30,766
Let's get you dressed.

1001
01:09:43,966 --> 01:09:45,766
This is crazy!

1002
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:49,366
Put your hands out like we used to.

1003
01:09:49,466 --> 01:09:51,566
I hold onto handlebars now.

1004
01:09:51,766 --> 01:09:53,866
- No hands!
- Mom.

1005
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:56,466
I'm passing you.

1006
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:58,866
All right.
Okay, here I come.

1007
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:02,866
Here I come!

1008
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:04,066
No chance.

1009
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,066
You're old, Mom. Give it up.

1010
01:10:07,366 --> 01:10:08,666
Funny.

1011
01:10:09,866 --> 01:10:12,066
Who's passing who now?

1012
01:10:12,266 --> 01:10:13,966
You're not gonna pass me.

1013
01:10:26,666 --> 01:10:27,666
Mom?

1014
01:10:43,266 --> 01:10:45,166
Rachel!
What, what, what is it?

1015
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,466
- Who? Who?
- Mommy. She was... she was here.

1016
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,766
It was... it was a dream, sweetie.
It was a dream.

1017
01:10:51,966 --> 01:10:54,566
Mommy, she was here.
No, she was here.

1018
01:10:54,766 --> 01:10:56,866
It's okay, Rache. It's okay. It's okay.

1019
01:10:58,566 --> 01:11:00,966
It was just a dream.
It was a dream.

1020
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:02,466
Mommy was here.

1021
01:11:02,566 --> 01:11:04,366
You saw Mommy in your dream.

1022
01:11:04,566 --> 01:11:07,366
- She was here.
- It's okay.

1023
01:11:08,266 --> 01:11:09,266
Mommy was here.

1024
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:11,666
- You had some dream.
- I didn't dream.

1025
01:11:11,866 --> 01:11:14,166
- You had some dream.
- Mom was here.

1026
01:11:16,566 --> 01:11:18,066
Mommy was here.

1027
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:25,166
You want some tea?

1028
01:11:25,366 --> 01:11:27,066
Yeah.

1029
01:11:28,366 --> 01:11:30,266
- Okay.
- Tea.

1030
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:32,866
Hey, Cin?
Why don't you sit over here.

1031
01:11:34,066 --> 01:11:35,066
Yeah.

1032
01:11:37,066 --> 01:11:39,766
I'll go make us some tea.
You'll be okay.

1033
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:42,866
It's okay.

1034
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,966
There, yes, ohh.

1035
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:50,166
There, sweetheart, shh.

1036
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:58,166
I really think that you should go up there.

1037
01:11:58,366 --> 01:11:59,866
I'm makin' the tea.

1038
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:03,766
I really think she needs you.
She had a nightmare about her mother.

1039
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:07,466
That's right, it was a nightmare.
It was a nightmare... ow!

1040
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:10,466
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay.

1041
01:12:10,666 --> 01:12:12,166
It's all right. I got it.

1042
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:15,466
It's okay? David? David?

1043
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:18,766
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.

1044
01:12:21,566 --> 01:12:22,866
She had a nightmare.

1045
01:12:24,066 --> 01:12:26,766
But she's all right.
She's all right.

1046
01:12:26,966 --> 01:12:29,366
No, I'm not.

1047
01:12:41,366 --> 01:12:43,466
I think I should go live with them, Daddy.

1048
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:48,466
I can't. I'm sorry.

1049
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:53,166
I see you go out there...

1050
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:55,766
and talk to her at night,

1051
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:59,066
and I know you want to make her alive,

1052
01:12:59,266 --> 01:13:00,966
but she's not alive.

1053
01:13:05,766 --> 01:13:08,466
And I'm sure that
you never meant for me

1054
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:10,666
to know you tried to kill yourself.

1055
01:13:14,966 --> 01:13:17,666
She didn't tell me.
She didn't have to.

1056
01:13:24,766 --> 01:13:28,266
But every time you go
to that beach, she's...

1057
01:13:32,466 --> 01:13:33,966
I didn't see.

1058
01:13:37,666 --> 01:13:38,666
I'm sorry.

1059
01:13:38,766 --> 01:13:40,766
I didn't know.

1060
01:13:46,866 --> 01:13:50,466
You'll always be my father.

1061
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:56,166
But I have to go.

1062
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:04,266
I have to let my mother be dead.

1063
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:56,266
Rache, what am I gonna do?

1064
01:14:56,466 --> 01:14:57,666
I'm stuck here.

1065
01:14:58,366 --> 01:15:00,666
You're gonna come visit all the time.

1066
01:15:00,866 --> 01:15:03,566
Oh, great.
And I'll get to play with Paul.

1067
01:15:06,766 --> 01:15:07,866
Always late.

1068
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:10,466
Boat's not gonna wait.
Did you ever consider that?

1069
01:15:10,666 --> 01:15:13,366
Did I consider that you yapping
doesn't speed me up?

1070
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:18,566
Was he talking about you last night?

1071
01:15:20,466 --> 01:15:21,566
What?

1072
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:25,266
People pretending they're making love
to somebody not their spouse.

1073
01:15:25,466 --> 01:15:28,766
- Do you do that?
- No, do you?

1074
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:30,066
Never.

1075
01:15:33,866 --> 01:15:37,266
We used to make love all the time.
Now it seems to be, I don't know...

1076
01:15:37,466 --> 01:15:38,666
seasonal.

1077
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:41,966
We're not in our 20s anymore.

1078
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:43,866
Yeah.

1079
01:15:47,366 --> 01:15:49,366
How would you describe our marriage?

1080
01:15:51,366 --> 01:15:54,266
Uh, you know, I'd describe it as, uh...

1081
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:57,166
you know, it's very nice.

1082
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:04,666
We have a nice marriage, Esther.
A lot of people don't have that.

1083
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:11,766
You know, they say the reason
most couples want to have children is...

1084
01:16:13,466 --> 01:16:16,366
because they sort of want
to celebrate the marriage.

1085
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:21,366
Do you think that's why
we never wanted to have kids?

1086
01:16:21,466 --> 01:16:24,866
Because we didn't feel
that we had anything to celebrate?

1087
01:16:26,466 --> 01:16:28,066
What was that thing last night...

1088
01:16:28,266 --> 01:16:33,666
that life passing you by,
that big truck of life... what was that?

1089
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:37,066
I was just, you know...
I love trucks.

1090
01:16:37,366 --> 01:16:39,366
Can we just once be honest?

1091
01:16:39,566 --> 01:16:41,766
Can we be truthful with each other?

1092
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,866
We don't want to face the truth, Esther.

1093
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,166
I mean, the truth is that

1094
01:16:50,366 --> 01:16:53,666
David goes out there
and gets giddy every night

1095
01:16:53,966 --> 01:16:55,766
splashing around with a ghost.

1096
01:16:57,266 --> 01:16:58,966
And we're both jealous,

1097
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:02,566
'cause he has something
that we've never known.

1098
01:17:04,966 --> 01:17:07,266
That's the truth.
We don't want to face that.

1099
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:18,066
Hey.

1100
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:24,666
Every day I get up...

1101
01:17:26,466 --> 01:17:27,866
I go to work...

1102
01:17:29,566 --> 01:17:31,366
and I come home to you.

1103
01:17:32,966 --> 01:17:35,766
I may not jump into bed
all the time wanting sex, but...

1104
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:41,966
I sure as hell need you to be there
for me to hold on to.

1105
01:17:46,266 --> 01:17:48,166
And if that's not, uh...

1106
01:17:49,466 --> 01:17:52,766
then God didn't make little
green apples, however that goes.

1107
01:17:53,066 --> 01:17:54,466
Where are my brown shoes here?

1108
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,666
Four-minute warning!
That horn means we got four minutes.

1109
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:27,966
Okay, let's go!

1110
01:18:28,566 --> 01:18:30,266
Look after him for me?

1111
01:18:30,466 --> 01:18:33,166
- I promise.
- Don't try to date him.

1112
01:18:34,966 --> 01:18:36,366
It's okay. I got this.

1113
01:18:36,566 --> 01:18:39,666
Get a move on. I don't want to
put up with you people another day.

1114
01:18:41,366 --> 01:18:42,666
- David.
- Yeah?

1115
01:18:43,366 --> 01:18:46,166
We'll take good care of her.
You can count on that.

1116
01:18:46,466 --> 01:18:48,266
I will.

1117
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:58,466
I got these. No, I got it.
No problem. I got it.

1118
01:18:58,666 --> 01:18:59,866
I got this.

1119
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:04,266
- It was very nice meeting you.
- Well, I'm so glad I came.

1120
01:19:05,966 --> 01:19:08,366
You're a very romantic man, Mr Lewis.

1121
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:11,566
If you ever do come over to the mainland,

1122
01:19:11,766 --> 01:19:13,866
I'm gonna fix you up
with one of my friends.

1123
01:19:15,766 --> 01:19:17,066
You're makin' fun again.

1124
01:19:20,566 --> 01:19:22,166
Say goodbye to your daughter.

1125
01:19:32,266 --> 01:19:35,166
Such a horrible thing.
Young love nipped in the bud.

1126
01:19:35,366 --> 01:19:38,866
Okay, postcards are beautiful
and cheap to send. Say goodbye.

1127
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:42,466
Joey lives in Belmont. He's a renter.
I'll see him in a couple weeks.

1128
01:19:42,766 --> 01:19:44,366
Oh, joy.

1129
01:19:45,066 --> 01:19:48,266
- I'll call.
- Okay. Bye.

1130
01:20:06,866 --> 01:20:08,066
So...

1131
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:11,466
there's something that
needs to be said here.

1132
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:14,766
I wish I knew what it was.

1133
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:16,066
Me too.

1134
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:18,566
These are the times I miss her the most,

1135
01:20:18,766 --> 01:20:21,966
'cause she'd always know what to say.

1136
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:23,366
She was the centre.

1137
01:20:24,166 --> 01:20:27,266
Dad, you were the centre.

1138
01:20:27,466 --> 01:20:28,766
It was always you.

1139
01:20:34,966 --> 01:20:37,566
She was the one climbing masts.

1140
01:20:41,866 --> 01:20:44,066
And letting go of handlebars.

1141
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:50,466
Well... boat's gonna leave.

1142
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,866
I'm sorry.
I wish I could stay. I'm just...

1143
01:20:56,966 --> 01:20:59,566
No, no. This is right.
You're doing what's right.

1144
01:20:59,766 --> 01:21:01,866
You're doing what's...
what's the best.

1145
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:05,866
We don't... even need
to say goodbye, really.

1146
01:21:06,066 --> 01:21:08,966
- No, no. More like, 'See ya'.
- Yeah. 'See ya'.

1147
01:21:09,166 --> 01:21:11,966
We'll be seeing each other,
visiting each other a lot.

1148
01:21:12,266 --> 01:21:14,466
A lot, a lot.

1149
01:21:26,066 --> 01:21:27,766
Say hi to her for me.

1150
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:32,766
See ya.

1151
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:53,966
We'll call as soon as we get back.

1152
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:56,566
Right. Yeah.

1153
01:21:56,766 --> 01:21:58,566
Have a good trip.

1154
01:23:02,366 --> 01:23:03,366
I'm staying.

1155
01:23:03,466 --> 01:23:05,966
No, you're not.
You're going. And I'm going.

1156
01:23:06,866 --> 01:23:08,866
I can get my job back at B.U.

1157
01:23:09,066 --> 01:23:11,066
- You mean it?
- I mean it. I mean it!

1158
01:23:11,966 --> 01:23:13,166
I mean it.

1159
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:21,566
You know, I just have to close up
the house and settle a few affairs.

1160
01:23:25,966 --> 01:23:28,166
- I'll be on the morning ferry.
- Okay.

1161
01:23:30,166 --> 01:23:32,166
And no more crying.
This is a good thing.

1162
01:23:32,366 --> 01:23:34,166
- I know, I know.
- It's a good thing.

1163
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:42,466
The boat's gonna leave.

1164
01:23:43,866 --> 01:23:46,466
He's going back to work at B.U.
He's gonna come back!

1165
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:50,966
What're you looking at me for?
Just find me a real estate broker.

1166
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:52,766
And a good therapist.

1167
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:55,666
Somebody with
a little more training than Esther.

1168
01:23:55,866 --> 01:23:56,866
Uh, done.

1169
01:23:56,966 --> 01:24:00,866
And maybe till you find a place,
you come and live with us.

1170
01:24:02,966 --> 01:24:04,266
If you promise not to sing.

1171
01:24:57,066 --> 01:24:58,166
Hi.

1172
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:00,966
You made a shadow.

1173
01:25:01,166 --> 01:25:03,266
You must've been thinkin' about me.

1174
01:25:17,766 --> 01:25:19,266
You remember that rule we had...

1175
01:25:21,666 --> 01:25:23,666
Rachel comes first.

1176
01:25:23,866 --> 01:25:25,166
That was our rule.

1177
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:29,266
- Your rule.
- Mm-hmm.

1178
01:25:45,366 --> 01:25:46,866
I picked you some flowers.

1179
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:54,666
I'm gonna miss you, Mr Man.

1180
01:25:59,466 --> 01:26:01,766
Oh, I can't let you be real anymore, Gill.

1181
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:05,166
I can't.

1182
01:26:05,266 --> 01:26:07,766
I know, I know.

1183
01:26:09,066 --> 01:26:11,566
I gotta go on for Rachel's sake.

1184
01:26:15,266 --> 01:26:16,266
And mine.

1185
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:21,566
Does it have to be today?

1186
01:26:24,166 --> 01:26:25,366
Yeah.

1187
01:26:27,666 --> 01:26:28,666
Okay.

1188
01:26:38,066 --> 01:26:40,366
I love you forever.

1189
01:26:40,566 --> 01:26:41,766
Me too.

1190
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:43,266
Goodbye.
