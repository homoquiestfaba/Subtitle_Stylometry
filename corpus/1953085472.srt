1
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,507
<i>Paris, a few weeks later</i>

2
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:11,367
Steamed duck.

3
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,409
Chicken saute.

4
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:14,944
Chicken curry.

5
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,011
White rice.

6
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,043
Enjoy your meal.

7
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:25,784
White rice?

8
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,326
All done?

9
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,712
Careful. Everyone knows.
They want to tell Mr. Li.

10
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,134
You'll get us all in trouble.

11
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,541
And with the pills
you're totally spaced out.

12
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,123
Fried noodles,

13
00:32:13,123 --> 00:32:14,629
white rice,

14
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,124
stir-fried shrimp,

15
00:32:17,124 --> 00:32:19,031
and Peking duck for two.

16
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,337
Another fried noodles.

17
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:42,986
I'm here.

18
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:45,924
What's wrong?

19
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:50,530
Nothing.
I'm sick of this shitty job.

20
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,732
I couldn't get your prescription.
And I'm worried.

21
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:57,132
Alexis hasn't answered for 4 days.

22
00:32:57,132 --> 00:32:58,833
I'm all out!

23
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:01,445
I know. And I told you
I'd do my best.

24
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,808
We better get going.

25
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,532
Who's she?

26
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:23,634
Aline. Alexis's ex-girlfriend.

27
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,737
She still has the keys to his place.

28
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:31,240
We haven't spoken in over a year.
This is a pain in the ass.

29
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,446
I tried before.
It's chained from inside.

30
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:38,014
See what I mean?

31
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,112
Don't bother. I already tried.

32
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:45,192
Allow me.

33
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:04,628
Let's clean up
then we'll call the cops.

34
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:06,529
Give me a trash bag.

35
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,523
- You should lay off that stuff.
- Fuck you.

36
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,720
It's none of my business.

37
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,723
It's your life.

38
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:13,835
- Are you coming or not?
- Watch your tone!

39
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:18,032
You asked me for a ride.
Now I have to help Aline.

40
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:21,043
What should I do?
Go sit and wait for the cops?

41
00:36:21,043 --> 00:36:24,512
I can drop you off somewhere
or leave you here.

42
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:26,207
I don't need your help.

43
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,217
Do you pity me? I don't need pity.

44
00:36:29,217 --> 00:36:30,911
Emily, just shut up.

45
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,722
You're only here
because I'm Lee's wife.

46
00:36:34,722 --> 00:36:37,225
- Fuck off.
- Get lost! Get lost!

47
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:39,226
No need to say it twice.

48
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,425
Jean-Pierre!

49
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,237
Jean-Pierre!

50
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,238
What's going on with Tricky?

51
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,013
His manager is putting you
on the guest list.

52
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,810
Who the hell cares
about the guest list?

53
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,922
I want 5 minutes with him.

54
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,024
I know.
I'm waiting for an answer.

55
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,221
I need to talk to him.

56
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,626
You think he'll help
get your son back?

57
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,030
Wake up.

58
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,730
Look at you.
You think you can raise a kid?

59
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,544
Want some money for a cab?

60
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,328
I know we're not Limp Bizkit,

61
00:37:52,328 --> 00:37:56,236
but for once
I'd like to do a sound-check.

62
00:37:56,236 --> 00:38:00,037
The band before you screwed up.
I can't be everywhere.

63
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:04,807
Don't take it so personally.

64
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:06,314
It's the club-owners who suck.

65
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:08,213
They care about the beer they sell
not the music.

66
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,411
I don't like being yelled at.

67
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:13,022
I'm upset.
I had to get it off my chest.

68
00:38:13,022 --> 00:38:16,422
This morning I got the demos
I did with Gloria.

69
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,132
Who's Gloria?

70
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:25,235
I told you about her.
I met her in prison.

71
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,231
- Are You angry?
- You bet your ass I am.

72
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:34,538
In prison who was the punk
you or her?

73
00:38:34,538 --> 00:38:36,340
No, it's like that for the men.

74
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,313
For us, the problem was trying
not to get raped by the guards.

75
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:43,716
But... if you care...

76
00:38:43,716 --> 00:38:46,015
I managed just fine, thanks.

77
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:52,327
Thank God for your letters.
Everyone else forgot about me.

78
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:53,623
Come off it.

79
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,626
Except the press
who wrote tons of crap.

80
00:39:00,626 --> 00:39:02,238
Yeah, here too.

81
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:06,241
Skip the first two tracks.
They're mediocre remixes.

82
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:07,935
Start with the third.

83
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,711
You do the vocals?

84
00:39:10,711 --> 00:39:14,807
I wrote the lyrics too.
Gloria did the music.

85
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,528
Come on, Elena...

86
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:09,138
That was an easy shot.

87
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,437
Is Gloria still in jail?

88
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,436
She was involved in a hold-up.

89
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,440
A guy got hurt.

90
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,706
She's been in over a year
and hasn't gone to trial yet.

91
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,715
How many tracks do you have?

92
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,513
About ten.
I know it sounds pretty rough,

93
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:32,121
but obviously
the conditions were lousy.

94
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,926
Not good, not bad.
I can't say.

95
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:42,828
Like a lot of other stuff.

96
00:41:42,828 --> 00:41:44,434
You mean it sucks.

97
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,896
I didn't say it sucks.

98
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,936
Let's get out of here.

99
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,319
Hello.
I'm lrene Paolini's assistant.

100
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,119
- Hello.
- This way.

101
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:13,521
She shouldn't be long.
With her you never know.

102
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:17,532
I'm always apologizing for her.
It's a real pain.

103
00:42:17,532 --> 00:42:20,136
I know. I used to work with her.

104
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:22,831
- I know.
- Really?

105
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,942
I watched you
every week on the cable.

106
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:30,604
Introducing video clips, MTV-style
dressed like a total bimbo.

107
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,906
I watched the show for you.

108
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,620
I was a huge fan. I still am.

109
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:38,819
Thanks.

110
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:42,120
When was it...
at least six years ago...

111
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,023
- How old were you?
- Fifteen. I was in high school.

112
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,127
I wore my hair and clothes like you.

113
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:49,323
Thanks.

114
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:53,027
- You want a coffee?
- Yeah, I do.

115
00:42:53,027 --> 00:42:54,330
My name is Sandrine.

116
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:12,818
- We spoke last week.
- Oh yeah?

117
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,422
I put your call through to lrene.

118
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,318
I haven't stopped
thinking of you since.

119
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,224
Last night I dreamt of you.

120
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:25,435
Was it a good dream
or a bad one?

121
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:26,627
A little of both.

122
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:29,537
I went to a hotel.

123
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,643
I had to see you.
They wouldn't let me in.

124
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:36,607
It wasn't even a fancy place.

125
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,907
I told them
'I'm a friend of Emily Wang's.'

126
00:43:41,907 --> 00:43:44,520
They didn't believe me.
I became hysterical.

127
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,816
I was crying.
It got later and later.

128
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,820
Fortunately Lee Hauser was there.

129
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:54,631
He recognized me and let me in.

130
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:01,133
But when we got up to your room...
you'd disappeared.

131
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,638
The bed was left unmade.

132
00:44:05,075 --> 00:44:08,044
- And?
- Nothing. I woke up.

133
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,817
Are you in Paris for good?

134
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,614
I don't know.
It depends on a lot of things.

135
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:19,313
Does it depend on lrene Paolini?

136
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,016
I need to find a real job.

137
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:24,218
To do something with my life.

138
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:27,121
Right now, things aren't great.

139
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,332
It's true that I'm counting on her.

140
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,128
Did she offer you
something serious?

141
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,433
No, nothing.

142
00:44:36,433 --> 00:44:38,939
We just spoke for a minute.

143
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:41,840
How typical.
All she cares about is herself.

144
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,115
The heyday of cable is over.

145
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:52,916
The network
doesn't give her much freedom.

146
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:54,217
It's a police state.

147
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,826
I wanted to work with lrene Paolini

148
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:03,330
because she used to try new things.

149
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,435
I guess that's sort of true.

150
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:07,036
She's given up now.

151
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,937
You're being harsh.

152
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:16,439
You had your share of blows.
You've lashed out too.

153
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,006
People badmouth you
but you haven't given up.

154
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:21,913
That's why I respect you.
And not lrene Paolini.

155
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,214
Are you okay?

156
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,182
Hey it's you.

157
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:00,420
I couldn't get hold of him.

158
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,720
They came late
and went to do the sound-check.

159
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,822
But I got you a ticket.

160
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:10,533
- But no backstage pass.
- You said you would.

161
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:13,431
Yeah, but they're being control freaks.

162
00:46:13,431 --> 00:46:15,731
I could barely get one for myself.

163
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,442
Tricky has to convince Lee's father.

164
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,640
I want to see my son again.

165
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,609
At least once in a while.

166
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:27,216
It's only human.
I'm not asking much.

167
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:33,018
I wrote him a letter.
Will you give it to him?

168
00:46:33,018 --> 00:46:37,526
Call me on my cell phone
after the concert.

169
00:46:37,526 --> 00:46:41,825
I'll tell you where we're eating.
Come meet us.

170
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:50,140
Did you get to see lrene Paolini?

171
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,142
No. She stood me up.
I'm waiting for another appointment

172
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,621
Hello.

173
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:57,026
He got your letter.
Someone else gave it to him.

174
00:48:57,026 --> 00:48:58,327
Hold on...

175
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:01,034
Excuse me tricky I have Emily.

176
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:06,438
She's on the phone.
And she's on the street outside.

177
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:07,941
What should I tell her?

178
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,812
- Nothing... OK...
- Apparently, it's not a great time.

179
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,214
What I suggest is that...

180
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,912
Meet us at the stage door.

181
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,921
It's on Rue Caumartin.

182
00:50:02,866 --> 00:50:03,890
Go ahead.

183
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,322
Mr. Li wants to see you.

184
00:50:26,322 --> 00:50:27,753
I called to say I'd be late.

185
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,824
Take care of this.
She's your niece.

186
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,322
Follow me.

187
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,936
- No use coming back.
- What did I do?

188
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:42,732
You know.
You didn't keep your word.

189
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,738
You must respect your family.

190
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:47,844
If they respect me.
My mother won't speak to me.

191
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,639
I was like a father.

192
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,305
I lent you money.
I gave you a job.

193
00:50:52,305 --> 00:50:54,314
- What a job!
- It's not good enough for you?

194
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,819
Yeah, yeah...

195
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,114
Ashamed working
with other Chinese?

196
00:50:59,114 --> 00:51:00,917
I never said that!

197
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:04,118
We had an agreement:
no drugs here.

198
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,421
- I respected that.
- Liar!

199
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:10,727
They could shut down my restaurant.

200
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:12,326
Give me a light.

201
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,642
I'm gone for good.
And I'll pay you back.

202
00:51:19,642 --> 00:51:22,438
Don't bother. Keep the money.

203
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,633
<i>London, a few days later.</i>

204
00:58:21,945 --> 00:58:23,709
Sorry, the other day

205
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:26,008
I was with the head of programming.

206
00:58:26,008 --> 00:58:28,812
I know... it's the same old thing.

207
00:58:28,812 --> 00:58:31,421
I detect a note of reproach.

208
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:34,619
Not at all.
It's just that I know you.

209
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:37,283
- You're angry about the past.
- No.

210
00:58:37,283 --> 00:58:39,294
I'm still angry with you.

211
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:44,196
You really didn't treat me that nice.

212
00:58:44,836 --> 00:58:46,997
We don't have to see each other.

213
00:58:46,997 --> 00:58:48,901
I can leave now if you like.

214
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:52,406
- No, don't.
- If you act up, I won't stay.

215
00:58:52,406 --> 00:58:54,010
Stay.

216
00:58:55,847 --> 00:58:58,713
So Sandrine says
you're moving back to Paris...

217
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,318
I can't go back to London.
Too many memories.

218
00:59:03,354 --> 00:59:05,218
What are you going to do now?

219
00:59:05,957 --> 00:59:08,118
I wanted to discuss it with you.

220
00:59:08,118 --> 00:59:09,419
A drink?

221
00:59:10,227 --> 00:59:11,990
The same thing... a whiskey.

222
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:17,396
As I was saying
I thought I'd talk to you.

223
00:59:17,396 --> 00:59:20,901
I thought maybe you could help...

224
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:23,405
Maybe, but times have changed.

225
00:59:23,405 --> 00:59:26,600
Sure, but times seem to be
treating you okay.

226
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,302
Yes, because...

227
00:59:28,302 --> 00:59:31,209
I'm good at my job...

228
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:34,318
good at corporate politics.

229
00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:36,517
But if I had a little freedom...

230
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:38,519
No, please... forget about it.

231
00:59:38,957 --> 00:59:41,721
You're busy
but I wanted to thank you

232
00:59:41,721 --> 00:59:43,691
for the show. It was great.

233
00:59:44,528 --> 00:59:49,397
Thank you. That's so nice of you!

234
00:59:49,397 --> 00:59:50,796
- See You soon, I hope.
- See you soon.

235
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,106
Lee didn't leave you anything?

236
00:59:59,743 --> 01:00:01,609
We weren't married.

237
01:00:02,747 --> 01:00:05,214
We had a joint account.
Almost empty.

238
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:06,816
And your son?

239
01:00:07,452 --> 01:00:11,218
If I want to see him
I need to turn my life around.

240
01:00:11,218 --> 01:00:12,618
Meaning?

241
01:00:13,658 --> 01:00:16,126
I need a job, for example.

242
01:00:17,327 --> 01:00:20,693
- And to stop shooting up.
- That's history.

243
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:23,596
- I doubt it.
- I said that it's history!

244
01:00:24,035 --> 01:00:27,095
I was on methadone
but I stopped taking it.

245
01:00:27,095 --> 01:00:30,298
Do you know how often
I hear that in my office?

246
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:36,003
I've known you long enough
and I've heard all your lies.

247
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:39,109
- I've changed.
- People don't change.

248
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:41,309
That's your opinion, not mine.

249
01:00:41,852 --> 01:00:44,913
Sandrine said
you were stoned out of your mind.

250
01:00:45,455 --> 01:00:48,823
You can level with me.
I don't care. It's your life.

251
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,584
She's pretty, Sandrine.

252
01:00:54,131 --> 01:00:56,497
- Do you sleep together?
- No.

253
01:00:58,836 --> 01:01:00,303
She dumped me two months ago.

254
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:05,906
- Do you still love her?
- Two days ago I followed her all night long.

255
01:01:06,443 --> 01:01:10,106
- Did she know?
- Yes. She pretended I didn't exist.

256
01:01:10,106 --> 01:01:12,910
She was with a woman
her new lover.

257
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:16,019
I've known for a while.
I couldn't care less.

258
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:19,714
This woman has
a restaurant near Beaubourg.

259
01:01:19,714 --> 01:01:22,122
It's doing okay.

260
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:26,992
Not too pretty, but very maternal.
Unlike me.

261
01:01:38,343 --> 01:01:40,401
I did something incredibly stupid.

262
01:01:41,445 --> 01:01:43,504
And it's too late to yell at me.

263
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:48,713
Sandrine stopped by
to have me sign something.

264
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:52,310
I got her into the bathroom
locked the door and left.

265
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:54,117
I swear!

266
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:57,093
It's not funny!

267
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:02,298
You're not a kid anymore.

268
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:05,196
You can't do that!

269
01:02:05,196 --> 01:02:07,497
- I know.
- Pathetic.

270
01:02:37,234 --> 01:02:38,394
Is lrene here?

271
01:02:58,957 --> 01:03:00,117
Come here.

272
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:11,800
Come closer.

273
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:20,106
Yes, I'd like a taxi.

274
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:24,510
Thank you.

275
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:36,318
- What Did You tell her?
- That it's over.

276
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:38,986
- Are You serious?
- Dead serious.

277
01:03:38,986 --> 01:03:42,896
- You just killed her.
- I doubt it. But I really hope I did.

278
01:03:51,843 --> 01:03:53,002
This way.

279
01:03:54,245 --> 01:03:55,506
Through the courtyard.

280
01:04:07,158 --> 01:04:10,184
It's lrene.
She'll call all night to apologize.

281
01:04:14,932 --> 01:04:18,095
- You want a whiskey? I do.
- Sure.

282
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:21,202
Then I'll be going.

283
01:04:31,548 --> 01:04:33,709
Is it true you and lrene were lovers?

284
01:04:38,955 --> 01:04:41,117
It's too much. I'll get drunk.

285
01:04:41,117 --> 01:04:42,521
So what?

286
01:04:45,028 --> 01:04:47,497
Before Lee, you were with lrene.

287
01:04:47,497 --> 01:04:48,792
Not with her.

288
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:52,992
But yes...
We were lovers.

289
01:04:55,238 --> 01:04:58,606
- Did Lee know?
- Sure he did.

290
01:05:00,943 --> 01:05:03,106
Sorry for all the questions.

291
01:05:03,948 --> 01:05:07,213
No need to apologize.
It's no secret.

292
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:03,066
Emily?

293
01:06:07,544 --> 01:06:08,533
Emily!

294
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:12,713
Emily!

295
01:06:51,856 --> 01:06:54,120
- I got it.
- It's heavy.

296
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,385
I'll manage.
Yann and Henri are friends of Jeff's.

297
01:06:57,385 --> 01:06:59,894
- Hi.
- Want to see your room?

298
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:04,096
I thought you'd call last night.

299
01:07:04,635 --> 01:07:05,896
I saw lrene.

300
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:10,003
- Any luck?
- No, a dead end.

301
01:07:10,539 --> 01:07:12,202
I told you not to count on her.

302
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:17,707
I crossed that bitch
off my list ages ago.

303
01:07:17,707 --> 01:07:21,613
You can unpack.
You can stick the crates in the closet.

304
01:07:22,653 --> 01:07:25,314
- Like it?
- It's great.

305
01:07:25,314 --> 01:07:26,718
The bathroom's that way.

306
01:07:27,959 --> 01:07:29,118
If Jeff's dog bothers you
just hit him.

307
01:07:29,118 --> 01:07:30,078
Beat it!

308
01:07:34,432 --> 01:07:35,899
Are you two coming?

309
01:07:35,899 --> 01:07:39,195
- We're finishing something. Later.
- Later.

310
01:07:39,195 --> 01:07:41,600
I told Jeff I'd stop by rehearsals.

311
01:07:42,439 --> 01:07:43,906
Here are the keys.

312
01:07:44,941 --> 01:07:46,807
For the house and for the gate.

313
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:50,405
You can always reach me on my cell.

314
01:07:51,249 --> 01:07:53,410
Make yourself at home, okay?

315
01:07:57,053 --> 01:07:58,419
See you later.

316
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:16,704
Emily.

317
01:08:19,743 --> 01:08:21,109
What's wrong?

318
01:08:24,346 --> 01:08:25,814
Want a painkiller?

319
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:28,818
I took one.

320
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,993
I wish Lee were here.

321
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,390
To take me in his arms.
To tell me it'll be okay.

322
01:08:48,939 --> 01:08:50,702
I'm sick of being alone.

323
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,204
I keep screwing up.

324
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:58,212
Why did he leave me all alone?

325
01:12:21,252 --> 01:12:23,720
- Ronaldo Demachy.
- Hi.

326
01:12:24,355 --> 01:12:26,118
Sorry about the wait.

327
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:31,087
I'll be frank. I'm seeing you
because lrene Paolini insisted.

328
01:12:31,087 --> 01:12:33,287
She's someone I respect a lot.

329
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:37,797
I won't waste your time.
I want things to be perfectly clear.

330
01:12:38,333 --> 01:12:39,891
I think they are.

331
01:12:39,891 --> 01:12:40,832
Right.

332
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:44,997
We're opening a boutique
in the Printemps department store.

333
01:12:44,997 --> 01:12:47,302
You'll have certain responsibilities,

334
01:12:47,302 --> 01:12:49,412
but it's a step above salesgirl.

335
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:51,515
I understand that.

336
01:12:51,515 --> 01:12:53,310
It's very hard work,

337
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,712
and to be honest
not very well-paid.

338
01:12:57,052 --> 01:12:59,418
I've thought it over and I want it.

339
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:00,922
Do you know our line?

340
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,886
Of course.

341
01:13:04,328 --> 01:13:08,195
We target active women with
limited means but who expect quality.

342
01:13:08,195 --> 01:13:09,890
Not exactly your profile.

343
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:13,297
But the store
attracts a lot of tourists,

344
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,033
Sure. No problem.

345
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:24,404
many of them Asian, so speaking
several languages is a major asset.

346
01:13:24,404 --> 01:13:27,711
Come meet Madame Gregory.
She runs the show here.

347
01:13:27,711 --> 01:13:32,220
She's busy overseeing
our new lingerie collection.

348
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,583
Obviously
you'll have to fit into our mold.

349
01:13:39,229 --> 01:13:42,288
- Meaning?
- You can't dress like you are now.

350
01:13:42,288 --> 01:13:46,596
Or like you did on your cable show.
It would look bad.

351
01:13:47,637 --> 01:13:50,698
- You saw the show?
- It was my generation.

352
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:52,502
It was a lot of fun.

353
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:55,503
It was before cable TV caught on.

354
01:13:55,503 --> 01:13:58,704
It was for the happy few.
The cool set.

355
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:00,110
There's Madame Gregory.

356
01:14:17,234 --> 01:14:20,395
- Are you home?
- I'm going out soon.

357
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:23,199
How was it?

358
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,100
Awful.

359
01:14:25,641 --> 01:14:29,010
- It didn't work out?
- Yeah, it'll work out.

360
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:35,409
I don't exactly have a choice.
I learned that in prison.

361
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:37,712
- Learned what?
- To adapt.

362
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:42,314
If I want to see Jay
I have to change my life.

363
01:14:42,314 --> 01:14:44,288
Even if the new life sucks.

364
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:46,190
It's the life most people live.

365
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:50,195
- Yeah, but it's grim.
- Being a junkie was better?

366
01:14:51,935 --> 01:14:53,195
I don't know.

367
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:57,096
I honestly don't.

368
01:14:59,842 --> 01:15:02,403
- You went shopping.
- A little. For Jay.

369
01:15:03,346 --> 01:15:05,109
He can sleep downstairs.

370
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:09,811
Don't bother. I'll make room
with me. He'll be fine.

371
01:15:11,454 --> 01:15:13,512
It's no bother for a weekend.

372
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:16,021
Exactly. If I only have two days

373
01:15:16,021 --> 01:15:18,287
I want him near me the whole time.

374
01:15:35,445 --> 01:15:37,003
Don't get carried away.

375
01:15:38,346 --> 01:15:39,712
What do you mean?

376
01:15:43,954 --> 01:15:45,922
What happens when he has to go?

377
01:15:47,056 --> 01:15:51,493
Back to London. Then back
to Vancouver. It's far away.

378
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,789
I'm sorry to be harsh.

379
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:58,492
You're right.

380
01:16:00,636 --> 01:16:04,003
Maybe it's better if I don't see him.
I don't know.

381
01:16:04,641 --> 01:16:06,609
Why is Albrecht coming?

382
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:12,204
I wrote him to say I'm doing well
that I found a job.

383
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:16,413
I guess he doesn't believe me.

384
01:16:17,354 --> 01:16:19,015
He's checking.

385
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:22,015
Are you up to the test?

386
01:16:22,725 --> 01:16:24,248
I'm trying to change...

387
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:30,297
But I don't know
if I can take care of a child.

388
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:02,498
I want a coffee.

389
01:17:02,498 --> 01:17:03,895
I'll meet you inside.

390
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,498
Got any change?

391
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,609
Remember I told you about Gloria?

392
01:17:14,609 --> 01:17:18,110
- The girl you met in prison?
- She's out.

393
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,909
I thought she was in for a while.

394
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:23,311
It turns out the case was dismissed.

395
01:17:24,454 --> 01:17:28,117
She called last week.
She wants me to join her.

396
01:17:28,457 --> 01:17:30,981
- Where?
- San Francisco.

397
01:17:31,528 --> 01:17:34,087
She found a label.
They like our demos.

398
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:38,493
Be careful.
Do you have a contract?

399
01:17:38,493 --> 01:17:40,601
She didn't mention one.

400
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:42,601
Is there any money in it?

401
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:47,404
They're willing to pay for sessions
with a real producer.

402
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:50,204
- What's his name?
- David Roback.

403
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:52,315
- Got a light?
- No.

404
01:17:54,051 --> 01:17:56,109
He has a group called Mazzy Star.

405
01:17:57,552 --> 01:17:58,610
Excuse me, do you have a light?

406
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:00,355
Sorry for bothering.

407
01:18:01,024 --> 01:18:01,887
Thank you.

408
01:18:04,427 --> 01:18:07,088
They did a few albums.
Good stuff.

409
01:18:07,529 --> 01:18:10,091
I remember Mazzy Star.

410
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:13,596
But he's only free next week.

411
01:18:16,739 --> 01:18:19,800
To record on Monday
I'd have to leave on Sunday.

412
01:18:21,445 --> 01:18:22,810
I'm not going.

413
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:26,404
I don't know how to tell Gloria.
She'll be disappointed.

414
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:28,507
Tell her you'll come later.

415
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:33,119
It's now or never.
And Jay comes first.

416
01:18:33,655 --> 01:18:36,989
If I go to San Francisco
I'll fuck everything up.

417
01:18:36,989 --> 01:18:40,288
I've done enough of that.
I won't do it again.

418
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:30,417
- Hello.
- Hello, a table for two.

419
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:31,918
- Smoking or No smoking?
- Smoking.

420
01:23:31,918 --> 01:23:33,716
Step this way, please.

421
01:23:38,127 --> 01:23:39,253
Thank you.

422
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:05,610
It's the Vincennes zoo.
That's the name of the town.

423
01:30:34,842 --> 01:30:35,900
So what do you want to see now?

424
01:30:47,457 --> 01:30:48,480
Thank you.

425
01:34:14,529 --> 01:34:15,689
Anyone home?
