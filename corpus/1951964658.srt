Aunt Cate!
Aunt Cate!

176
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,004
Yes?

177
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:53,742
I think I
started a fire!

178
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:58,310
You know, your brother really
needs to come up with a new gag.

179
00:11:58,387 --> 00:11:59,877
What? It
wasn't me.

180
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:03,218
Come on!
Come on!

181
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:17,033
Don't I know you?
Yes! You're a legend!

182
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:20,098
You stole the school mascot
when my sister was a senior.

183
00:12:20,176 --> 00:12:23,407
Sorry, it wasn't me.

184
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:27,506
Besides, I didn't steal the mascot,
I just set him free.

185
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,845
Can I ask you
a question?

186
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,852
I'm not really a big
fan of questions.

187
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,478
Why don't you ever
come see us?

188
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:35,353
That's easy.
I don't like it here.

189
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,459
What's not
to like?

190
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:44,160
Mm, the house, the dog, the 2.5 kids,
the whole stagnant prepackaged existence.

191
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,564
We don't
have a dog.

192
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:47,034
And there's
only two of us.

193
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:48,866
You're missing
the point.

194
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:51,600
Just the name of the
town alone, Comfort.

198
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,694
I miss Christmas.

199
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,526
It's only a couple of days away,
I think you'll make it.

200
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,396
I mean, it doesn't
feel like Christmas.

201
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:21,300
It hasn't snowed,
Mom and Dad aren't here,

202
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,668
we don't even have
a Christmas tree.

203
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:28,073
We always decorate
the house as a family.

204
00:13:28,144 --> 00:13:32,342
Don't you ever miss Christmas
in Comfort, Aunt Cate?

205
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,404
Nope.

206
00:13:33,482 --> 00:13:35,177
How come?

207
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:39,813
I don't really believe in Christmas.
Not anymore, at least.

208
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:42,585
Mom said when you left here,
you lost your heart.

209
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:46,685
Well, we can't always be
perfect like your mom, can we?

Only room for one

think you're going?

212
00:13:51,434 --> 00:13:52,423
Out.

213
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,490
Oh yeah?

214
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:54,558
Yeah.

215
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:55,661
Is that right?

216
00:13:55,738 --> 00:13:57,501

but it would be wrong to lie.
Don't you think?

Yes, it would. Why don't you
go run and tell your Aunt Cate

And this, I mean,
obviously a fake.

It's not a fake, Cate.
I'm the sheriff in Comfort now.

Savannah was kidding.

Although now
that I think of it,

267
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,386
that would be pretty
out of character for her.

you a gun?

remember but it was five.

Yes way.

Okay, you're right.

279
00:17:27,016 --> 00:17:29,246
Anyway, that's irrelevant.

280

You invented
the hydrant gag.

292
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,515
And I grew up,
that's what happened.

293
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:15,155
You certainly did.
Quite nicely, I might add.

294
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:19,327

Careful, I may need to arrest you.

295

Arrest? Um, I think I should go.
Actually...

296
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,133
Maybe you
should go.

297
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:26,640
Why? What's
the hurry?

298
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:30,338

Coffee! A donut maybe.

Okay, you're up
to something.

300
00:18:32,314 --> 00:18:33,542
Why do you
say that?

301
00:18:33,616 --> 00:18:34,913
You're doing
that thing.

302
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:36,110
What thing?

00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,698
Realized what?

324
00:19:31,774 --> 00:19:33,901
That you're a delinquent,
is what.

eat a healthy breakfast, brush
our teeth for 1.6 minutes,

Cranky.

346

I'm not cranky,
I'm just not a morning person.

I need to find Clive and
I need to find the diamond.

00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:17,601
Look, you know as well as I
do that a guy like Clive Henry

doesn't get found
unless he wants to be.

375

<i>I also know that Clive hates
hanging onto hot goods.</i>

376
00:22:22,678 --> 00:22:24,976
It makes him anxious.
He'll fence the diamond

377
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,072

we're gonna be there.

you're too hot to
come back in the city.

In the meantime,

to pay a visit to the Cooper house.

the Christmas party, didn't she?

Yeah, of course
she did!

Tell me
about it.

514
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:51,977
<i>[choir sings]</i>

515
00:31:15,076 --> 00:31:16,441
You're totally
lip-syncing.

516
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,500
Am not.

517
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:18,568
Are too!

518
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:19,636
Snitch!

519
00:31:19,714 --> 00:31:20,738
Faker.

520
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:22,407
Is everything
alright, Annie?

521
00:31:22,484 --> 00:31:23,974
Don't do it.

522
00:31:24,052 --> 00:31:26,646
<i>(teacher)</i>
<i>Annie?</i>

523
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,279
She isn't singing.

524
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:30,950
[all gasp]

525
00:31:31,026 --> 00:31:33,290
Unbelievable.

526
00:31:33,361 --> 00:31:36,194
<i>Well dear, Cate is
filling in for your mother.</i>

527
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:39,495
She hasn't caroled with
us for quite a while, so,

528
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:43,298
<i>why don't we give her a chance to
find her voice again, shall we?</i>

529
00:31:44,673 --> 00:31:47,471
<i>Let's take it</i>
<i>from the top.</i>

530
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:03,148
So you'd like a new little dolly
for Christmas, is that right?

531
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:09,185
Well, I think you've been a very good girl,
I bet I can get you that, okay?

532
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:11,528
Okay, thank you for
coming to visit me.

533
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,003
Ho, ho, ho!
I think I know this little girl!

534
00:32:17,072 --> 00:32:18,198
Go!

535
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:20,207
And this
little boy.

536
00:32:20,275 --> 00:32:21,401
You ready?

537
00:32:21,476 --> 00:32:23,103
I am.

538
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:26,443
Peace on earth, halt to global
warming, universal health care,

539
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:29,677
and if you don't mind,
I'd really appreciate you getting

540
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:32,743
my parents home in
time for Christmas.

541
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:35,881
My Aunt Cate isn't very
good at the holiday stuff.

542
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:39,290
We don't even have a tree up yet,
if you can believe it.

543
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,090
Whoa, not a good
move, dude.

544
00:32:42,163 --> 00:32:44,393
Oh, Hank, come on,
he was just playing.

545
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:47,299
He was stealing the
candy cane, Cate.

546
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:49,029
You know it
and I know it.

547
00:32:49,104 --> 00:32:53,006
Okay. He's sorry, but really,
sugar makes people do crazy things.

548
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,166
You're sorry, right?

549
00:32:54,242 --> 00:32:55,231
No.

550
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,709
See? He's
sorry, let's go.

551
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:58,336
Hold on a second.

552
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:03,851
There is one question that
has been nagging me for years.

553
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:05,249
I can't wait to
hear this.

554
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,414
Does Santa wear
boxers or briefs?

555
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,482
[children's laughter]

556
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,656
Ho, ho, ho! She's
a naughty little girl!

557
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:20,428
Santa won't be visiting
your house this year!

558
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:27,106
(Cate)
Meet me back here later.

559
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:32,774
[tired sigh]

560
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:35,008
Well, you certainly
haven't changed.

561
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,744
Why thank you.

562
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,649
It wasn't
a compliment.

563
00:33:40,221 --> 00:33:43,622
You never were
big on compliments.

564
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,159
"You're not prom
material, Cate."

565
00:33:46,227 --> 00:33:49,253
Not what I said, and that's
completely unfair, and you know it.

566
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:53,061
You took Cindy Kirk to the prom.
How am I being unfair?

567
00:33:53,134 --> 00:33:54,795
You told me you
didn't want to go.

568
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,929
I was giving you an out.
I didn't think you'd actually take it.

569
00:33:58,006 --> 00:33:59,940
I can't believe
you're mad about this.

570
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,602
I am not the one who
packed up and left town

571
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:05,009
the day after graduation
and never came back.

572
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:08,674
Laugh away,
great, very nice.

573
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,345
<i>I'm sorry. It's just that when
I imagined this conversation,</i>

574
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,617
it didn't involve you
in a Santa costume.

575
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:19,749
But you imagined it?

576
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:23,821
Yes. And I was very composed
and I had fantastic hair.

577
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:25,490
And how did
it end?

578
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:28,559
With you, on your
knees, apologizing.

579
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:31,537
Me? Apologizing?
What about you?

580
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:32,595
Me?

581
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:33,663
Yeah.

582
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:36,574
Hi, Hank.
Hi, Caty.

583
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,203
Am I
interrupting something?

584
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,269
Yes.

585
00:34:40,348 --> 00:34:41,474
No.

586
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:44,541
Oh, you two.
Just like old times.

587
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:46,985
Bicker, bicker,
kiss, kiss.

588
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:53,016
Uh, I gotta get going.
My public awaits.

589
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,932
Ho, ho, ho.

590
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:04,631
So, Savannah
and Brian.

591
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:06,606
Yeah, what about them?

592
00:35:06,674 --> 00:35:08,904
Are they gonna make it
in time for the party?

593
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:12,413
It doesn't really look like it.
They're still stuck in the Bahamas.

594
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,974
<i>I figured as much.
The neighborhood association discussed it,</i>

595
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:21,579
and we all agreed, if you'd prefer to
cancel we would be totally okay with that.

596
00:35:21,656 --> 00:35:23,521
That would probably
be for the best.

597
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:26,856
Of course,
I mean... you?

598
00:35:26,928 --> 00:35:29,590
Having the whole
neighborhood over for a party?

599
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,359
I'm not really
the party type.

600
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:34,993
Did you just say
"the whole neighborhood"?

601
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:37,936
All out of their
houses at the same time?

602
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,906
That's what we
call a party.

603
00:35:39,974 --> 00:35:43,273
And at this party they would expect what?
Food, music, and drinks?

604
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,073
Games are always a hit.

605
00:35:45,146 --> 00:35:46,408
Don't push it.

606
00:35:46,481 --> 00:35:47,778
[gasp]

607
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,976
You know what?
The party's still on.

608
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:55,216
Excellent!
I'll alert the troops.

609
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,528
While you do that,
I'll do a little recon.

610
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:07,091
Are you sure your Mom got your
Dad a high-Def plasma screen?

611
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:09,193
Excellent choice.

612
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,569
Spoil yourself.
Tell your wife that you want...

613
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,132
no, that you <i>need</i> that
new set of golf clubs.

614
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,270
She deserves a
diamond watch.

615
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:22,544
She did give you
a wonderful child,

616
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:26,849
so the store is right
here, on the right.

617
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:30,254
First store up, we'll just go
right there, pick one up. Okay!

618
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:32,759
How are your
grandkids, Mrs. Bradley?

619
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,351
They're doing
great, dear.

620
00:36:34,429 --> 00:36:37,125
Still living at the house
on Sycamore, the blue house?

621
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:38,563
That's right, dear.

622
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:40,032
Nice seeing you.

623
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:42,899
You too, Cate.
Bye-bye.

624
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:47,340
Auntie Claus is
coming to town.

625
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:51,742
There you go.
Water.

626
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:58,780
Blankey.
Animal.

627
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:02,251
Night light.

628
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:04,450
One more thing.

629
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:08,793
Okay, fine.

630
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:26,479
[crashing and splintering]

631
00:37:28,016 --> 00:37:30,211
You're not very good
at this, are you?

632
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,478
<i>(Cate)</i>
<i>You know what your problem is?</i>

633
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,489
You told me.
I'm a delinquent.

634
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:39,549
You keep getting caught.
That's your problem.

635
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:43,063
You really gotta work on your moves.
Today was an embarrassment.

636
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:48,361
Here. See if
you can get this.

637
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:53,338
I mean, you are
worse than I thought!

638
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:56,334
Here.
Hide it.

639
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,903
Watch and learn... oh!

640
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:01,005
Oh! Are
you okay?

641
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:02,106
[sigh]

642
00:38:02,183 --> 00:38:03,878
How'd you
do that?

643
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:07,011
Simple. Create a diversion and
follow with a single fluid motion.

644
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:09,352
<i>It is all in</i>
<i>the diversion.</i>

645
00:38:09,424 --> 00:38:11,221
You try it.

646
00:38:11,292 --> 00:38:13,760
Ow, my knee!

647
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:15,625
Better, huh?

648
00:38:15,696 --> 00:38:18,290
Where'd you learn
to do that?

649
00:38:18,366 --> 00:38:23,201
From this guy I know.
Sort of a mentor. Best in the business.

650
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:24,533
What business is that?

651
00:38:24,605 --> 00:38:26,766
Sales. Why? What did
your mother tell you?

652
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:29,241
She didn't
tell me anything.

653
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:34,771
Oh, good. So anyway, if you
could see this guy in action...

654
00:38:45,593 --> 00:38:47,959
Excuse me, I believe
these are your glasses.

655
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:50,589
Sorry, those
aren't mine.

656
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,394
Sure.

657
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,366
Season's Greeting.

658
00:39:05,179 --> 00:39:06,168
[beep]

659
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:11,212
Ah!
Ow! Ow!

660
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,717
I hear you been
looking for me.

661
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:19,851
Cut to the chase, what
can I help you with?

662
00:39:19,927 --> 00:39:23,624
I heard about what happened
with Cate and the diamond.

663
00:39:23,698 --> 00:39:25,325
Yeah.

664
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:27,390
<i>I still want in.</i>
<i>I know you think I'm smalltime,</i>

665
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:31,427
but I can get you top dollar and I've got
a very serious buyer waiting in the wings.

666
00:39:31,506 --> 00:39:32,495
I want in
the game.

667
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,634
I'm at the Windsor.
I'm taking bids

668
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:40,169
on the morning of the 24th.
You got one shot at this.

669
00:39:40,248 --> 00:39:41,476
Don't disappoint.

670
00:39:47,922 --> 00:39:52,382
[gasps]

671
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:04,760
Hey!

672
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,101
What's wrong?

673
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:08,904
Parker just stole
that candy.

674
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:13,310
Annie, do you realize how much
they charge for that piece of candy?

675
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:16,214
Almost a buck.
Know how much it cost to make?

676
00:40:16,284 --> 00:40:20,846
A dime. Tops.
I mean, that's a 90 cent profit.

677
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:24,323
Now that's stealing.
Parker, he's just evening the score.

678
00:40:24,392 --> 00:40:25,723
It's like you
read my mind.

679
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:27,351
What about
the candy makers?

680
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:29,020
The who?

681
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:32,896
The people who make the candy.
They need money. Don't they?

682
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:37,597
<i>For food and clothes?</i>
<i>And Christmas presents for their kids.</i>

683
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:40,664
<i>Mom says when you take something
that doesn't belong to you,</i>

684
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,675
you hurt people
inside their hearts.

685
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:47,112
Your Mom always was a know-it-all.
Candy makers, who ever heard of such a thing?

686
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,351
Alright.

687
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:08,934
What are we
gonna do?

688
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,403
Mom's ornaments are
still in the box,

689
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:16,409
we don't have a tree, or the
lights up, it's gonna be terrible!

690
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:19,605
Okay, take a deep
breath, in...

691
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,079
out.

692
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,945
In.

693
00:41:23,017 --> 00:41:25,986
Out. Help your brother
unpack the groceries.

694
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:28,954
I'm gonna go pay a visit
to Sister Christmas,

695
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:30,285
see if she can
help us out.

696
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:36,794
Here you go.

697
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:38,058
Parker!

698
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:42,700
[knocks]
Holly?

699
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:47,763
Holly?

700
00:41:47,842 --> 00:41:49,275
In here!

701
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:02,284
Wow,

702
00:42:02,356 --> 00:42:07,589
I was expecting mistletoe and
mince pie and instead I find...

703
00:42:07,662 --> 00:42:12,759
Nothing. I like to wait until
Christmas Eve to decorate the inside.

704
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,028
Really?

705
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:20,369
Okay, fine, I'm having
a crappy Christmas.

706
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:21,703
Is that a crime?

707
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:24,006
Well, if it were
I'd be doing time.

708
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:29,914
This is the worst
Christmas ever!

709
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:32,851
Okay, are you gonna
tell me what's going on?

710
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:43,623
Mark left me.
There, I said it. He left me.

711
00:42:43,698 --> 00:42:47,099
And now he's vacationing in
Maui with the kids and Yvette.

712
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:48,965
Who?

713
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:53,063
<i>Yvette, the Pilates instructor
he left me for in September.</i>

714
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,507
He's moving in with her when he
gets back and everyone will know!

715
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,135
Nobody knows?

716
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:59,839
[whispers]
I'm so ashamed.

717
00:42:59,914 --> 00:43:02,212
Wait, why are
you ashamed?

718
00:43:02,283 --> 00:43:07,186
Honestly, I can't believe you married that guy,
Mark Barnes, he was always such a meathead.

719
00:43:07,254 --> 00:43:14,126
Holly, I'm sorry. Listen, these things happen.
I know exactly how you feel.

720
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:15,992
You do?

721
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:19,089
<i>Well, sure. Just a few days ago,
I had a guy take off on me.</i>

722
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:21,396
Bad breakup, huh?

723
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:24,199
Yeah, you could
say that.

724
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,535
You know,

725
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,539
you've done pretty
well for yourself.

726
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:37,175
Mark's the breadwinner.

727
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,343
Don't do that.

728
00:43:38,419 --> 00:43:40,319
What?

729
00:43:40,388 --> 00:43:41,878
<i>Give him</i>
<i>the credit.</i>

730
00:43:41,956 --> 00:43:45,585
You are a very
strong, capable woman.

731
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,388
I am?

732
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:51,591
<i>Yes! And we women have to
take charge of our own lives.</i>

733
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:54,259
<i>If there's one thing
I'm not, it's a victim.</i>

734
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:56,428
Fashion victim, maybe.

735
00:43:56,504 --> 00:44:00,099
In the interest of sisterhood,
I'm just gonna ignore that.

736
00:44:00,174 --> 00:44:03,541
I'm sorry. It
just came out.

737
00:44:03,611 --> 00:44:10,312
You know what you need? You need
to keep busy. Preoccupy yourself.

738
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:12,147
You're right.

739
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,653
Why don't you help me get
ready for the Christmas party,

740
00:44:14,722 --> 00:44:19,352
<i>not that I need your help or
anything but to distract you.</i>

741
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:20,621
I don't know.
[sigh]

742
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:23,720
Okay, fine.
We'll play games.

743
00:44:23,798 --> 00:44:25,561
Oh!

744
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,175
Hey, what are you doing here?

745
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:44,274
Well, there wasn't much I could do
about world peace and global warming

746
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:47,445
on such short notice, but I
thought the least Santa could do

747
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,684
was make Annie's Christmas
wish for a tree come true.

748
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:57,491
It's all they had left.
This side's pretty good.

749
00:44:57,565 --> 00:45:00,500
It's great.
Thank you.

750

<i>(Cate)</i>
<i>There's not much time on the clock,</i>

751
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:08,605
Holly, since I can't boil water,
you're in charge of finger foods.

752
00:45:08,676 --> 00:45:10,041
Right.

753
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,670
Parker, I want you and
Hank to trim the tree.

754
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,646
I mean decorate it
not burn it down.

755
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:16,307
Fine.

756
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,716
Annie, write invitations that
even Scrooge couldn't refuse,

757
00:45:19,787 --> 00:45:22,221
reminding people that
the party is still on.

758
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,154
Do you want it
in verse or prose?

759
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:25,852
English will be
fine, thanks.

760
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:28,326
What are you
gonna do?

761
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:33,856
Fine! I'll string lights.
Okay, ready? Ready!

762
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:57,451
Oh!

763
00:46:46,307 --> 00:46:48,036
Everybody ready?

764
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:51,236
It's not how
Mom does it.

765
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:54,475
You know what, Annie?
Your mom is great at a lot of things

766
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:58,040
and your Aunt Cate, she's got a way
about her that's pretty cool too.

767
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,916
Let's do this.

768
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,149

I love it!

772
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:16,426
The disco ball might be a bit much.

773
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:26,503
I really appreciate
what you did today.

774
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,744
It was great hanging out with
you again. Felt like old times.

775
00:47:30,818 --> 00:47:35,687
Yeah, it's that we were decorating
trees instead of stealing them.

776
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:40,955
I secretly had your
record expunged of that.

777
00:47:41,028 --> 00:47:42,962
How sweet.

778
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,588
Thank you.

I think that's
my cue.

Yeah.

00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,699
Okay.

We're in the city

That's all that
I can tell you.

What kind
of business?

00:49:08,248 --> 00:49:10,011
Like spy-top secret?

796
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:12,609
Let's say I'm dealing with the
recovery of a family heirloom.

797
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:15,712
Our family heirloom?
Is it worth a lot of money?

798

<i>Like gold bars</i>

Yes, yes, no.

Why?

804
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:29,897

said so!

00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:19,366
I can't take it, they're all over the place,
I'm afraid I'm gonna lose one.

860
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:21,703
<i>I'm just not good</i>
<i>with babies.</i>

861
00:52:21,775 --> 00:52:27,145
<i>Besides, this one kinda scares me.</i>
<i>Just call me later.</i>

862
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:29,444
We're not babies!

863
00:52:29,516 --> 00:52:31,950
Just sit there
and be quiet.

864
00:52:33,754 --> 00:52:38,453
Pulling another job, Catherine?
Something involving small spaces?

865
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:41,255
They're not elves, Clive,
they're children.

866
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:44,491
<i>And I'm just here to collect what's mine.</i>
<i>What you took from me.</i>

867
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:46,464
I'm afraid that
isn't possible.

868
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:48,228
I thought we
were friends.

869
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:51,635
Did I ever tell you the fable
about the tortoise and the scorpion?

870
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:56,142
<i>I'm really not in the mood to hear
one of your stories right now, so, mm.</i>

871
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:59,838
They too were friends.
One day the friends came upon a river,

872
00:52:59,913 --> 00:53:02,609
and the scorpion cried out,
"I don't know how to swim."

873
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:05,948
The tortoise offered,
"I'll carry you but you mustn't sting me."

874
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:10,183
<i>The scorpion agreed, so the tortoise
carried him across the river.</i>

875
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,953
Know what happened when
they reached the other side?

876
00:53:13,026 --> 00:53:15,324
<i>He stung his friend.</i>

877
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:19,195
<i>With his last dying breath, the
tortoise asked the scorpion why.</i>

878
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:20,790
Know what
the scorpion said?

879
00:53:20,867 --> 00:53:21,856
You're a jerk?

880
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,232
<i>"Because it's</i>
<i>my nature. "

881
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:29,434
It's my nature.
Yours too. We can't help ourselves.

882
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:33,206
I've done some bad
things in my life.

883
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,613
<i>But I would never ever leave my
partner behind to get caught.</i>

884
00:53:36,683 --> 00:53:38,412
It wasn't my intention,

885
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:40,885
just delayed while I made
away with the diamond.

886
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:42,478
I deserve my share.

887
00:53:45,692 --> 00:53:47,922
<i>You're right.</i>

888
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,693
I am?

889
00:53:50,764 --> 00:53:53,096
But it's not
gonna be so easy.

890
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,672
All or nothing.
Agreed?

891
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:02,038
Like I have
a choice.

892
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,502
Keep your eyes
on the prize.

893
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,843
Annie, Parker, watch
the middle one.

894
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:10,474
<i>Don't take your eyes</i>
<i>off it for a second.</i>

895
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:18,847
Well?

896
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:20,256
The one on
the left.

897
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:22,056
<i>(Parker)</i>
<i>It's on the right.</i>

898
00:54:26,133 --> 00:54:27,828
Congratulations,
Catherine.

899
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:30,936
Your lesson
is completed.

900
00:54:41,415 --> 00:54:42,712
Careless little...

901
00:54:42,783 --> 00:54:44,341
Don't you dare.

902
00:54:44,418 --> 00:54:47,910
Careful, you don't want me
to do something you'll regret.

903
00:54:47,988 --> 00:54:49,649
<i>You are a
<i>wanted woman.</i>

904
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,624
Kids, it's time for us to go.
This isn't over.

905
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:58,395
In the real story,
the scorpion stung the turtle

906
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:02,026
<i>halfway across the river,</i>
<i>and they both drowned.</i>

907
00:55:02,102 --> 00:55:04,195
The scorpion was
his own worst enemy.

908
00:55:12,512 --> 00:55:14,275
(Cate)
So there's a fifty in it

909
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:17,475
for anyone who's willing to
pretend this day never happened.

910
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:18,643
Done.

911
00:55:18,718 --> 00:55:19,707
I'm in.

912
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:21,447
You okay?

913
00:55:21,521 --> 00:55:24,319
I'll be fine. It would've been
nice to get the thing back.

914
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:28,293
Almost enough to make me
believe in Christmas again.

915
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:32,731
Hey, now make sure
they're close together.

916
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:35,097
They're pretty
close together.

917
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:37,932
<i>That looks nice.</i>

918
00:55:38,004 --> 00:55:40,564
Hey!

919
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,232
Hey.

920
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:43,435
Where you been?

921
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,205
<i>Uh, just</i>
<i>running errands.</i>

922
00:55:45,278 --> 00:55:48,475
'Cause I was wondering if I could
steal you away for a little bit.

923
00:55:48,548 --> 00:55:51,642
<i>Um, well, we have a
party to get ready for.</i>

924
00:55:51,718 --> 00:55:55,119
Go, I've got it
under control.

925
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:56,280
Hold out
your hand.

926
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:57,789
Why?

927
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,258
Just do it.

928
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:06,562
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

929
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:13,863
What is this?

930
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:18,343
You'll see.
Come on.

931
00:56:20,647 --> 00:56:24,811
<i>Parker. Annie.</i>
<i>Start stringing.</i>

932
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:25,909
Oh cool!

933
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:46,437
Wait right here.

934

936
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:57,512
It's prom.

937
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,051
May I have this dance?

938
00:57:05,859 --> 00:57:08,657
You didn't
have to do this.

939
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:14,462
Yes, I did. I'm sorry I
never took you to prom, Cate.

940
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:15,899
I know.

941
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:25,107
I really think you
should apologize now.

942
00:57:25,178 --> 00:57:26,736
What?

943
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:29,373
Not dying your shoes to match
your outfit. I mean, please!

944
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:34,887
Oh! You realize you just
assaulted an officer. Ow.

945
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:37,446
Now that's
assaulting an officer.

946
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:54,874
<i>(male voice) What's going on here?
This wasn't authorized!</i>

947
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,000
Who is that?

948
00:57:57,077 --> 00:58:00,638
Not authorized?
Nice. Now what?

949
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:01,874
Now we run.

950
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:04,348
Come on.

951
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:19,394
I can't believe
it's still there.

952
00:58:19,466 --> 00:58:22,731
I come by once in a
while, polish it up.

953
00:58:22,802 --> 00:58:26,636
[chuckles]
Right! So what? You never got married?

954
00:58:26,706 --> 00:58:31,643
No. Came close once or
twice but it never stuck.

955
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,444
You?

956
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:37,312
You know me. Not really
the ball-and-chain type.

957
00:58:37,384 --> 00:58:39,614
I like to keep
my options open.

958
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:44,886
[chokes and coughs]

959
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,789
Easy, tiger.
You alright?

960
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:52,628
Um... yeah.
I just need to use the restroom.

961
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:21,420
I had none of
your ice cream.

962
00:59:21,494 --> 00:59:23,485
Oh, you
had better not.

963
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:25,224
Where were we?

964
00:59:31,905 --> 00:59:33,702
Four peanuts for you.

965
00:59:36,142 --> 00:59:38,076
And four
peanuts for you.

966
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:39,975
I'm gonna need more than four nuts.

967
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:41,980
I'm sorry, but
everybody gets four.

968
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:44,346
Sorry, but I don't
remember voting you leader.

969
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:47,181
But this may be the only
food we have for a while.

970
00:59:47,253 --> 00:59:50,484

Snap out of it, honey.

973
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,736
I know you like having things just so,
but life doesn't work like that.

974
01:00:07,073 --> 01:00:10,099
Not to us, our kids,
not even your sister.

975
01:00:12,512 --> 01:00:14,275
It's okay
to let go.

976

It's just so hard.

You wouldn't.

Why? What do
you know?

1180
01:15:27,593 --> 01:15:30,756
Unfortunately, at this point,
I'm unable to flip on a partner.

1181
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:37,200
However, I took the liberty of writing
down a few things. Mainly his aliases.

Thank you, Annie.

1183

You have no leverage.
Give me the diamond or I turn you in.

01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:54,910
Fine, turn me in.
You'll never see the diamond again.

01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:24,746
Gettin' in the car.

1196
01:16:24,817 --> 01:16:26,978
Oh no, I'm in the
driver's seat this time.

1197
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:32,451
Did you
check the list?

1198
01:16:32,524 --> 01:16:34,151
Twice.

1199
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:39,786
Uh-huh.

1200
01:16:39,865 --> 01:16:40,854
Right.

1201
01:16:46,872 --> 01:16:48,305
What are
you doing?

1202
01:16:48,374 --> 01:16:50,569
Oh, we need all the
cover we can get.

1203
01:16:52,878 --> 01:16:57,406
Britney.
Britney.

1204
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:04,044
Close enough.

1205
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:13,892
<i>(Holly)</i>
<i>That was a great party.</i>

1206
01:17:13,966 --> 01:17:15,593
I have so much
cleaning up to do.

1207
01:17:15,667 --> 01:17:17,157
Could you grab
that, please?

1208
01:17:17,236 --> 01:17:18,703
Sure.

1209
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:22,537
Thank you.
Oh! Don't forget that there. Thank you!

1210
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:30,639
Oh, gosh! That carpet there, we're
gonna have to get that cleaned tomorrow.

1211
01:17:30,716 --> 01:17:33,014
Oh, and and
that one too.

1212
01:17:33,085 --> 01:17:34,245
Sure.

1213
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:35,843
You have a stain on your shirt.

1214
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:38,981
Oh, what's this?
Mistletoe.

1215
01:17:39,057 --> 01:17:41,821
You know what
this is all about.

1216
01:17:41,894 --> 01:17:43,953
[chuckling]

1217
01:17:52,104 --> 01:17:54,834
Aw, damn!

1218
01:17:54,907 --> 01:17:58,434
Oh, geez.

1219
01:18:36,215 --> 01:18:37,978
Sheriff, we really
need to talk.

1220
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:40,211
Um, not right
now, okay Gary?

1221
01:18:50,062 --> 01:18:51,791
Thank you, Annie.

1222
01:18:57,135 --> 01:18:58,159
It's her, isn't it?

1223
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:12,873
We still make a pretty
good team, you and I.

1224
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:15,476
Perhaps we should reconsider
going our separate ways.

1225
01:19:15,554 --> 01:19:17,351
I'm done
with all that.

1226
01:19:17,422 --> 01:19:20,186
You'll never be done.
We can't change who we are.

1227
01:19:20,259 --> 01:19:23,717
I told you.
We're bad by nature.

1228
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:28,558
<i>Just a tiny bauble.</i>
<i>They'll hardly miss it at all.</i>

1229
01:19:28,634 --> 01:19:30,295
Not fine.

1230
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:32,769
I'll just toss it back down the
chimney on the way out of town.

1231
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,641
This would be a
bad development.

1232
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,066
Clive Henry?

1233
01:20:03,135 --> 01:20:06,332
Hey, Sheriff, how
about a hand here?

1234
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,100
What?
Cate!

1235
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:13,468
Cate?

1236
01:20:13,545 --> 01:20:15,342
You know the
scorpion thing?

1237
01:20:15,414 --> 01:20:19,111
<i>Turns out it was just a fable.
Being bad isn't in my nature.</i>

1238
01:20:27,526 --> 01:20:29,084
(Cate)
Hank.

1239
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,721
I am really not in the market
for an explanation now, Cate.

1240
01:20:31,797 --> 01:20:37,258
Give me
your hands.

1241
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:39,270
Where's the stone?

1242
01:20:44,042 --> 01:20:45,532
What are
you doing?

1243
01:20:45,611 --> 01:20:46,942
<i>I'll say that Clive
had the diamond on him</i>

1244
01:20:47,012 --> 01:20:48,639
and that you
were long gone.

1245
01:20:48,714 --> 01:20:51,979
You can't do that. He'll tell
everybody that you let me go.

1246
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:54,610
And who do you think
they're gonna believe?

1247
01:20:54,686 --> 01:20:59,350
Me or a thief.
Go on, you're free to go.

1248
01:20:59,424 --> 01:21:02,188
What if I don't
want to leave?

1249
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:07,459
Then you stay with me and
you face the consequences.

1250
01:21:13,505 --> 01:21:18,374
<i>[Christmas tune]</i>

1251
01:21:55,013 --> 01:21:57,641
The house is still standing.
That's a good sign.

1252
01:21:57,716 --> 01:21:59,946
I have a feeling that
something isn't right.

1253
01:22:09,928 --> 01:22:12,328
(Annie and Parker)
Mom! Dad!

1254
01:22:12,397 --> 01:22:13,728
(Mom)
Hi!

1255
01:22:13,799 --> 01:22:15,664
Hey, buddy.

1256
01:22:15,734 --> 01:22:18,862
(Holly)
Merry Christmas!

1257
01:22:18,937 --> 01:22:25,604
Hey, welcome back!
You look great. Got a tan.

1258
01:22:32,784 --> 01:22:34,911
<i>(Hank)</i>
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

1259
01:22:34,986 --> 01:22:36,351
Hank!

1260
01:22:36,421 --> 01:22:37,786
Merry Christmas.

1261
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:40,783
Who are you?

1262
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:43,259
<i>Duffy. It's</i>
<i>a long story.</i>

1263
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:47,526
[happy chatter]

1264
01:22:47,599 --> 01:22:49,726
Ohh!

1265
01:22:52,204 --> 01:22:53,967
I need to say
something to you.

1266
01:22:54,039 --> 01:22:58,942
He told you,
didn't he?

1267
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:02,571
I know that I let you down
and embarrassed you, I'm sorry.

1268
01:23:02,647 --> 01:23:05,946
Actually, Cate, I wanted
to answer your question.

1269
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:08,542
About where you
were on my list.

1270
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:11,418
As of today, you're
right at the top.

1271
01:23:13,358 --> 01:23:15,883
Thanks for looking
after my children.

1272
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:17,258
Thanks for
letting me.

1273
01:23:19,197 --> 01:23:22,166
<i>(Annie) Look everybody!</i>
<i>It's finally snowing!</i>

1274
01:23:22,234 --> 01:23:23,462
[cheering]

1275
01:23:23,535 --> 01:23:25,332
<i>(Brian)</i>
<i>Merry Christmas everyone!</i>

1276
01:23:25,403 --> 01:23:28,065
We should
get going.

1277
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:31,507
Promised NYPD to have
you there by 2:00.

1278
01:23:31,576 --> 01:23:34,272
Alright, you two!
Come here!

1279
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:39,846
<i>Here's the deal.</i>
<i>You'll probably not gonna be seeing me</i>

1280
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:43,615
<i>for, oh, three to six years,
but after that,</i>

1281
01:23:43,688 --> 01:23:47,522
I promise I will never miss a
Christmas in Comfort again, okay?

1282
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:52,291
Come here.
I love you, beautiful girl.

1283
01:23:52,364 --> 01:23:53,729
You stay good.

1284
01:23:53,799 --> 01:23:55,858
Oh, gross.

1285
01:23:55,934 --> 01:23:58,198
I made
brownies for you.

1286
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:02,969
A little nail file never hurt either,
if you get my drift.

1287
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,906
It was
Duffy's idea.

1288
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,849
Bye.

1289
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,694
What did you say
to my sister?

1290
01:24:24,763 --> 01:24:26,560
Nothing, really.

1291
01:24:26,631 --> 01:24:29,464
People don't usually thank you
for involving their offspring

1292
01:24:29,534 --> 01:24:31,798
in a felony offense,
especially not Savannah.

1293
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:35,328
I just told her the truth.
You could've left but you didn't.

1294
01:24:35,407 --> 01:24:38,001
You came back and
did the right thing.

1295
01:24:38,076 --> 01:24:40,601
<i>It goes a long
way in my book.</i>

1296
01:24:40,679 --> 01:24:44,012
And you know,

1297
01:24:44,082 --> 01:24:48,644
as for the stone,
I think I have an idea.

1298
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:49,846
Come on.

1299
01:24:49,921 --> 01:24:53,084
[boat horn]

1300
01:25:06,805 --> 01:25:09,365

1301
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,080

1302

[whirring]

1303
01:25:23,922 --> 01:25:24,946
Voila.

1304
01:25:26,925 --> 01:25:30,156
There's always a way around
the system, gentlemen.

1305
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:34,756
I would increase the infrared around the
windows and the air conditioning vents.

1306
01:25:34,833 --> 01:25:36,300
Any entry points are a risk.

1307
01:25:36,368 --> 01:25:40,771
Mm. What would I do
without you, Cate.

1308
01:25:40,839 --> 01:25:45,276
I will say, Sheriff, returning
the stone, dropping the charges,

1309
01:25:45,343 --> 01:25:48,312
hiring Cate,
quite ingenious.

1310
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:51,406
<i>If it weren't for you, I never
would have found this gem.</i>

1311
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:53,144
We should
get going.

1312
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:54,242
Do we have to?

1313
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:56,446
It was part
of the deal.

1314
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:58,352
Oh.

1315
01:25:58,423 --> 01:26:01,620
<i>(Cate) So after Jack stole the
hen that laid the golden eggs,</i>

1316
01:26:01,693 --> 01:26:05,459
<i>he went back up the
beanstalk to get more loot.</i>

1317
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:08,590
<i>Well, this time the giant
woke up and chased him.</i>

1318
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:13,127
Well, Jack barely escaped.
Then he chopped down the beanstalk

1319
01:26:13,204 --> 01:26:15,502
<i>so he would never</i>
<i>be tempted again</i>

1320
01:26:15,573 --> 01:26:18,508
and him and his mother
lived happily ever after.

1321
01:26:18,576 --> 01:26:21,977
So you see, you don't have to
go chasing up some beanstalk.

1322
01:26:22,047 --> 01:26:25,016
<i>The things that are most important
are right here at home.</i>

1323
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:26,516
Here you go.

1324
01:26:28,386 --> 01:26:31,981
Ho, ho, ho.
Are you ready to talk to Santa?

1325
01:26:32,057 --> 01:26:33,524
Lunch in 20, Sheriff.

1326
01:26:33,591 --> 01:26:36,082
<i>You left out a  whole
bunch of stuff.</i>

1327
01:26:36,161 --> 01:26:40,325
<i>In the real story,</i>
<i>Jack also took a bag of gold coins</i>

1328
01:26:40,398 --> 01:26:42,195
and a magical
singing harp.

1329
01:26:42,267 --> 01:26:44,132
What are you?
The fairy tale police?

1330
01:26:45,904 --> 01:26:47,371
Come here.

1331
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,533
(Cate, happily)
Ooh!

1332
01:26:50,608 --> 01:26:54,007
Alright, one for you and 
one for you. Go!

1333
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:59,273
<i>(Cate, off)</i>
<i>Everybody has. Merry Christmas to all.</i>

1334
01:26:59,351 --> 01:27:01,683
<i>And they lived</i>
