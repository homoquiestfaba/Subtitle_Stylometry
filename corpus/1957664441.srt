00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:03,551
I want you, girl.

188
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:09,413
Leonard.

189
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:12,413
Sorry, I was thirsty.

190
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:14,000
The door.

191
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:15,441
Why'd you leave the door open?

192
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:16,655
I didn't leave that door open.

193
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,205
You probably did.

194
00:09:18,206 --> 00:09:19,344
Oh I did?

195
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:22,344
You definitely left
the door open.

196
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,139
Babe, I really didn't
leave this door open.

197
00:09:24,551 --> 00:09:25,631
So you got amnesia again?

198
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,384
Are you gonna stare at it
or are you gonna close it?

199
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,861
And you brought dirt
into my kitchen?

200
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:46,585
Babe, what are
you talking about?

201
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,861
Clean it up and go
feed the dogs please.

202
00:09:48,862 --> 00:09:50,171
Anything else?

203
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,172
Yeah, I'll let you know.

204
00:10:03,206 --> 00:10:04,172
All right,
so who do we have next?

205
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:06,067
We have little miss Brianna.

206
00:10:06,068 --> 00:10:08,274
Therapist said she's done well.

207
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,551
No signs of autism or
any physical defects.

208
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:13,171
Her x-rays look good.

209
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:15,171
So do our MRI reports.

210
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:16,930
So what are you thinking?

211
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:19,240
Well it's complicated.

212
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,999
My first thought was
Rhett Syndrome.

213
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,688
What makes you think that?

214
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:24,688
Well as you know, with
Rhett Syndrome children

215
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,343
between one and four years
of age lose the ability

216
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,723
to perform skills
they previously had.

217
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:32,102
The loss can be rapid,
could be more gradual,

218
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:33,999
occurring over weeks
or even months.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That actually seems to fit

220
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,171
Brianna's clinical picture here.

221
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:39,343
Yeah, but that's it.

222
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,412
She hasn't experienced any
pain in her lower extremities

223
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,378
and her head growth is normal.

224
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,723
So what are you thinking?

225
00:10:45,724 --> 00:10:48,930
My first thought was
Acute Benign Myositis.

226
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,171
Yeah, but usually
you have leg pain

227
00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:52,102
associated with that as well.

228
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:54,033
Yes I know, but the
difference is with

229
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,240
Rhett Syndrome you lose
the ability to walk.

230
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,240
Brianna's x-rays and MRI report

231
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,067
show no structural damage.

232
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,240
So what do I tell the parents?

233
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,516
I mean I don't wanna
scare them and we're

234
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:05,274
not really sure what
we're dealing with.

235
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:07,309
I would just be truthful.

236
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,792
There's a chance Brianna won't

237
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,757
resume walking for a long time.

238
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,620
They'll need to understand
and accept that.

239
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,895
All right.

240
00:11:15,896 --> 00:11:17,310
We'll continue to run tests.

241
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,067
Kathy!

242
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,964
Dr. Dickerson's on the phone!

243
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:37,067
Okay babe, coming!

244
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,068
Hello?

245
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:38,931
Hey Leonard.

246
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,274
How are you guys making out?

247
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,999
Good good, finally
getting settled in.

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,827
That sounds great.

249
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,688
You guys deserve it.

250
00:11:44,689 --> 00:11:46,757
Well I hope I have some
good news for you.

251
00:11:46,758 --> 00:11:48,412
So I looked at Brianna's tests,

252
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,309
all of her tests
came back negative.

253
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,412
Her MRis are negative,
her x-rays are good.

254
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,733
She really doesn't show any
sign of developmental problems.

255
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,964
You guys seem kinda down.

256
00:12:01,965 --> 00:12:03,619
No, no, not down at all.

257
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,067
It's a great thing.

258
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:09,172
I'm just a little
confused because...

259
00:12:11,827 --> 00:12:15,481
I mean she's still not
walking, so I was just

260
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:19,344
hoping to maybe get
some type of answer.

261
00:12:20,517 --> 00:12:22,586
Listen, we just
gotta give it some more time.

262
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,240
We'll continue to
do the therapy,

263
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:25,792
we'll run some more
tests, and hopefully

264
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,447
we'll have a breakthrough soon.

265
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,620
Okay.

266
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:32,827
Time and patience it is then.

267
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,136
And listen, you
guys have a great evening.

268
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:36,827
Thank you.

269
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:37,964
You too.

270
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,965
Thank you.

271
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:40,862
Baby.

272
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:44,103
She's okay.

273
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:47,689

274
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:49,689

277
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,378

278
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,379

You are so silly.

371
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,067
Look babe, I'm
all ready to go.

372
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,412
Uh-uh.

373
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:56,689
I'm not doing this with you.

374
00:17:57,448 --> 00:17:58,482
Crazy.

375
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:04,793
My sexy ass husband.

376
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:09,482
I just started my period.

377
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,379
Aw babe, for real?

378
00:18:13,448 --> 00:18:14,103
I know-

379
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:14,620
- You said tonight.

380
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:16,412
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

381
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:18,136
What do you want me to do?
It just popped out of no where.

382
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:19,137
Sue me.

383
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,965
Oh okay, Mr. Attitude.

384
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:34,206
I love you.

385
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,068
Is my hubby mad at me?

386
00:18:42,068 --> 00:18:46,275
Are you mad 'cause you can't
get any and you gotta wait?

387
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:55,309
Wake up!

388
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,310
Wake up!

389
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:59,448
What's wrong babe?

390
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:02,619
When you got up last night

391
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,171
you must've taken her
out of her crib.

392
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:04,551
Huh?

393
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:05,872
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:05,896 --> 00:21:06,655
Why would I do that?

395
00:21:06,655 --> 00:21:07,275
Are you hurt?

396
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:07,896
Are you okay baby?

397
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:08,586
Let me see.

398
00:21:08,586 --> 00:21:09,310
Let mommy look at you.

399
00:21:09,413 --> 00:21:10,275
Are you hurt?

400
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:11,344
She was in our bed?

401
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:13,862
No, she was laying on
the floor next to her crib.

402
00:21:14,068 --> 00:21:15,068
Really?

403
00:21:15,827 --> 00:21:17,205
Yes.

404
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:18,930
Are you messing with me?

405
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:20,211
How did she get out of her crib?

406
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,206
Probably got out her
crib the same way

407
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:23,688
you left the refrigerator open.

408
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:28,274
I mean I know I got up
and I went to the kitchen,

409
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:30,067
but I just don't
remember picking her up.

410
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:31,310
But maybe I did.

411
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,999
Yeah, you don't remember.

412
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,171
Just like you don't remember

413
00:21:35,172 --> 00:21:35,862
leaving the refrigerator open!

414
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,999
Okay, okay, okay.

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,654
I just can't believe I did that.

416
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:41,033
Me either.

417
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:41,931
Come here, Bri.

418
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:42,931
Daddy's sorry, pumpkin.

419
00:21:42,932 --> 00:21:44,827
Can you just go feed the dogs?

420
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:00,517
What the fuck?

421
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:01,654
Did you just shit in your food?

422
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:02,655
Both of y'all?

423
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,965
Really?

424
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:05,965
Come on.

425
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:08,448
Come on come on come on come on

426
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:11,585
come on come on come on come on.

427
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:13,447
Really?

428
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:14,968
Can't believe y'all
just did this shit.

429
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:22,497
Stop digging in
the grass, Titus!

430
00:22:23,103 --> 00:22:24,965
Titus!

431
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,864
Titus stop digging
in the grass, buddy!

432
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:30,586
Titus!

433
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:31,654
Come on.

434
00:22:31,655 --> 00:22:32,930
Come on.

435
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:34,619
Come on.

436
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,758
Come on, Titus.

437
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:47,103
How was your
shower, my sexy man?

438
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:48,619
Good.

439
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,620
I needed it.

440
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:51,275
What's up?

441
00:22:51,275 --> 00:22:52,275
Something wrong?

442
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:55,792
Those dogs still
aren't eating.

443
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:57,673
We need to just let
them out of those kennels.

444
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,659
If they poop on the rug oh well.

445
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:03,309
What?

446
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,861
I mean you know my
dog always eats.

447
00:23:04,862 --> 00:23:05,895
She greedy.

448
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:07,240
Not today she isn't.

449
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:08,826
Hasn't touched her food all day.

450
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,309
This morning I was
really pissed.

451
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,172
What she do?

452
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:12,965
Shit right in the food bowl.

453
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Right on top of the food.

454
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:16,723
What?

455
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:17,861
Why?

456
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,862
Who knows.

457
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:20,999
Maybe it's the food.

458
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
New house.

459
00:23:22,827 --> 00:23:23,999
I don't know.

460
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,103
Ew.

461
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:27,482
That's weird.

462
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,689
Maybe they're sick.

463
00:23:36,137 --> 00:23:37,172
Who knows.

464
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:39,241
It's something.

465
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:24,689
Dang babe, what?

466
00:24:27,448 --> 00:24:28,896
That was the weirdest thing.

467
00:24:29,793 --> 00:24:31,412
Our daughter.

468
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,309
She was staring
at me wide awake.

469
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,619
Babe, are you sure you
just didn't dream that?

470
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,930
No, it wasn't a dream.

471
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,309
I know what I saw.

472
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,137
Her eyes were wide open.

473
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,931
Okay, well she's asleep and
that's what I wanna be doing.

474
00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:47,000
Can we please just go
back to sleep babe?

475
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,379
Leonard!

476
00:27:17,448 --> 00:27:19,067
Come here come here come here.

477
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:20,068
Come here baby.

478
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:21,447
What the hell was that?

479
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:22,700
I don't know, but I'm
about to find out.

480
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:23,275
Oh my god.

481
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:24,895
Wait, you cannot
leave us in here!

482
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:25,344
Just wait a minute.

483
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:27,079
Let me see what the
hell is going on.

484
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,827
I'm gonna call the police.

485
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:31,481
What's wrong buddy?

486
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:32,931
Hmm?

487
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:33,965
What's wrong?

488
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:36,827
What's wrong?

489
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:49,586
Fufu.

490
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:33,620
Are you not gonna
get the door?

491
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:44,172
Hi sir, Sheriff Lee Boyd.

492
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,034
Yeah, I heard about your
situation and wonder

493
00:28:47,344 --> 00:28:49,896
if I can please ask
you a few questions.

494
00:28:49,931 --> 00:28:51,571
We're trying to investigate
what happened.

495
00:28:51,655 --> 00:28:53,343
Okay.

496
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:54,517
All right.

497
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:00,688
So tell me, Leonard is it?

498
00:29:00,689 --> 00:29:02,448
Is that the correct name?

499
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:03,103
Yes, Leonard.

500
00:29:03,448 --> 00:29:04,585
Okey-doke.

501
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:05,626
Sorry, I'm bad with names.

502
00:29:07,068 --> 00:29:10,689
So explain to me what happened.

503
00:29:10,724 --> 00:29:13,205
Me and my wife were sleeping.

504
00:29:13,206 --> 00:29:15,586
All of a sudden we heard a
loud bang like a door slam.

505
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,206
Did a door slam, or did just
sound like a door slammed?

506
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:19,826
I think a door slammed.

507
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,947
I don't know exactly, but
that's what it sounded like.

508
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:24,274
Kathy, please babe, sit.

509
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:26,068
Have a seat.

510
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,274
It's all clear out back.

511
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:28,517
No signs of a break in.

512
00:29:29,793 --> 00:29:30,758
Perfect.

513
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,205
Okay, no sign of a break in.

514
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:33,378
Continue.

515
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:34,861
We jump up.

516
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:36,481
My wife grabbed the baby.

517
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:38,309
And that's when I
went to the porch.

518
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,481
And I found my dog all bloody.

519
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:41,723
And that's you realized that

520
00:29:41,724 --> 00:29:43,344
the other dog had
been eaten alive?

521
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:45,689
Oops.

522
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:49,103
Yes sheriff, thanks.

523
00:29:49,137 --> 00:29:51,102
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

524
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,724
but we have to call
Animal Control.

525
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,378
So what you're saying is you
guys are gonna kill my dog?

526
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:57,412
No no no I'm not saying that.

527
00:29:57,413 --> 00:29:58,413
Yes!

528
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,620
Yes!

529
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:01,136
That's exactly what he's saying.

530
00:30:01,137 --> 00:30:04,654
Your dog killed my Fufu
and we have a daughter!

531
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:07,586
And she's not safe in the
house with that goddamn dog!

532
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:11,034
So here's what's gonna happen.

533
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:13,379
The dog will not
necessarily be put down.

534
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:16,757
But he will definitely
be quarantined.

535
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:17,895
Quarantined?

536
00:30:17,896 --> 00:30:18,907
Do you know what rabies are?

537
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,930
What the fuck is a quarantine
going to do?

538
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:22,136
Get your dog out of here now!

539
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:22,793
Kathy I got it!

540
00:30:22,793 --> 00:30:23,517
I hear you!

541
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:24,965
Do you have it?

542
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:29,033
They will come around and
pick up the dog within 12 hours.

543
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,274
That's all right.

544
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:31,481
I'll take him when
I go into work.

545
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:32,103
Do you want to take him?

546
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:33,103
No!

547
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:37,103
You take your fucking dog now!

548
00:31:05,206 --> 00:31:06,586
Grab your clothes.

549
00:31:06,655 --> 00:31:07,689
Grab my clothes?

550
00:31:07,758 --> 00:31:08,758
Peek-a-boo!

551
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:09,965
Grab my clothes.

552
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:12,103
Peek-a-boo!

553
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:13,517
Peek-a-boo!

554
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:14,517
Use your pillow.

555
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:17,758
Peek-a-boo!

556
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:22,171
You gonna play with me?

557
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,447
Yeah.

558
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:24,585
You ready?

559
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:25,586
Peek-a-boo!

560
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:27,344
- Peek-a-boo!
- Peek-a-boo!

561
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,068
- Peek-a-boo!
- Peek-a-boo!

562
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,586
Peek-a-boo!

563
00:33:06,827 --> 00:33:07,827
No!

564
00:33:30,068 --> 00:33:31,757
Mommy.

565
00:33:31,758 --> 00:33:33,655
Open the door, mommy.

566
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:49,275
Mommy.

567
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,827
Get the fuck away from me!

568
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:59,619
Open the fucking door, mommy.

569
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,551
Mommy.

570
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Open the door, mommy.

571
00:34:04,137 --> 00:34:05,137
Shit.

572
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:07,344
Mommy.

573
00:34:08,655 --> 00:34:09,827
Open the door, mommy.

574
00:34:14,482 --> 00:34:16,034
Baby come home.

575
00:34:16,172 --> 00:34:17,412
Come home.

576
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:19,241
Open the door!

577
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:20,379
Come home.

578
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:21,310
Now.

579
00:34:21,344 --> 00:34:22,344
Please.

580
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,171
Kathy!

581
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:32,792
I'm in here!

582
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:33,344
Hurry hurry!

583
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,344
Kathy!

584
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:37,275
Baby!

585
00:34:37,344 --> 00:34:38,344
Baby!

586
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:39,827
The camera.

587
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:40,689
The camera.

588
00:34:40,724 --> 00:34:41,379
The camera?

589
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:42,379
Where's Bri?

590
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,241
She's fine.

591
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,310
No she's not!

592
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:45,550
She's fine, she's
crawling around the room.

593
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:46,379
No she's not!

594
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,172
Kathy!

595
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:48,172
She chased me!

596
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,827
Oh my god, she's
right behind me!

597
00:34:50,862 --> 00:34:51,862
Okay, hold on!

598
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:55,379
Yes.

599
00:34:55,655 --> 00:34:57,000
Yes Mr. Taylor, I am.

600
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,344
What's wrong?

601
00:34:59,413 --> 00:35:01,379
I need your help sir, please.

602
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:03,136
Excuse me?

603
00:35:03,137 --> 00:35:04,517
I'm in my house.

604
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,034
Wait, wait.

605
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:12,241
Leonard, are you here?

606
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:40,965
Please bless this house.

607
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:51,103
Mr. Taylor!

608
00:36:58,413 --> 00:36:59,413
Kathy?

609
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,034
Brianna?

610
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:24,481
Is that you?

611
00:37:24,482 --> 00:37:25,655
No!

612
00:37:26,137 --> 00:37:27,137
Brianna.

613
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:29,930
It's Pastor Hunt.

614
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:34,000
Not Brianna, Pastor Hunt.

615
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,655
You're not welcomed here.

616
00:37:41,344 --> 00:37:42,724
In the name of
the holy spirit.

617
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,205
I order you to leave this house

618
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:47,000
of God and to
release this child.

619
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,412
No no no!

620
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,241
You will release this child.

621
00:38:00,206 --> 00:38:02,586
You have no place in this home.

622
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,620
In the strength of the holy
spirit, I cleanse this child.

623
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,275
Jesus.

624
00:38:17,103 --> 00:38:19,724
What's wrong, pastor?

625
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,413
In the strength of the holy
spirit, I cleanse this child.

626
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:26,000
I rebuke this demon out of here!

627
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,482
I rebuke this demon out!

628
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:29,447
I rebuke this demon out!

629
00:38:29,448 --> 00:38:30,792
I rebuke this demon out of here!

630
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,102
I rebuke this demon out of here!

631
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,206
I rebuke this demon.

632
00:38:44,758 --> 00:38:46,896
Pastor Hunt, how
did this happen?

633
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:50,413
We go to church every Sunday.

634
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:51,827
We're good people.

635
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:55,482
Mrs. Taylor, a demon can
just come across your path.

636
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:57,379
So is our child possessed?

637
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:58,688
No.

638
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:01,481
I wouldn't say she's
possessed, but I do think

639
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:04,379
whatever or whoever is
using her as a passageway.

640
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:08,241
A passageway?

641
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,861
When I came to
the house tonight

642
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:13,000
and saw Brianna I
asked if it was her.

643
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:15,964
If she was possessed
she would've

644
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,723
said yes just to get to me.

645
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:19,895
She answered no.

646
00:39:19,896 --> 00:39:22,205
I just felt there was
more she wanted to say.

647
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,688
So you telling me a demon

648
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:25,205
is trying to speak
through my daughter?

649
00:39:25,206 --> 00:39:28,240
Well I'm afraid so, but we're

650
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:30,585
not sure if it's a
demon or a spirit.

651
00:39:30,586 --> 00:39:32,240
But what the hell is it?

652
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:33,482
I don't know yet.

653
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,206
But I won't stop
until I find out.

654
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:38,033
I promise.

655
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:40,000
So what does that mean?

656
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:44,482
That she'll turn into
that thing again?

657
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:47,723
I would say no, but with
the dog being murdered

658
00:39:47,724 --> 00:39:50,723
so viciously, I don't
know what will happen.

659
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:53,723
Leonard, I don't feel
safe in this house anymore.

660
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,551
Mrs. Taylor, I understand
how you're feeling,

661
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:59,137
but the spirit has made a
connection with your daughter.

662
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,689
So you're saying it doesn't
matter if we leave or not.

663
00:40:02,206 --> 00:40:03,654
Yes, I'm afraid so.

664
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,826
So how am I supposed
to handle all this?

665
00:40:05,827 --> 00:40:07,347
How am I supposed to
protect my family?

666
00:40:27,655 --> 00:40:30,067
The Almighty One
is your shield.

667
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:31,585
If you sense another
episode is starting,

668
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:33,827
you need to start
praying loudly.

669
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:35,792
Find a scripture
that's very meaningful

670
00:40:35,793 --> 00:40:37,172
to you and say it with passion.

671
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Do not fear.

672
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:41,379
Because it will
feed off your fear.

673
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,655
Be very firm with it.

674
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,827
And pray, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor.

675
00:40:48,137 --> 00:40:49,137
Don't worry.

676
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:50,482
You'll get through this.

677
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:03,344
Are you Brianna?

678
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,862
I love you so much, baby.

679
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:13,896
How you guys doing, baby?

680
00:41:19,379 --> 00:41:20,724
Honey, you okay?

681
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:24,620
Honey, you okay?

682
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:27,051
Please babe, don't be upset.

683
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:29,413
How can I not be?

684
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:34,275
I'm scared to death
of my own child.

685
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:35,689
Okay.

686
00:41:37,586 --> 00:41:39,309
I can barely even look at her.

687
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:41,206
We have to stay
positive, all right?

688
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:44,413
"Stay positive."

689
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:45,447
Shit, how?

690
00:41:45,448 --> 00:41:47,033
Kathy.

691
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:48,516
How am I supposed
to stay positive?

692
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:50,550
Kathy, listen, Kathy.

693
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,240
We'll figure this out together.

694
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,241
Kathy, are you drinking now?

695
00:41:53,242 --> 00:41:56,102
Yes I'm drinking, Leonard!

696
00:41:56,103 --> 00:41:57,895
I'm losing my goddamn mind here!

697
00:41:57,896 --> 00:41:59,136
Okay, okay.

698
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:00,205
Okay.

699
00:42:00,206 --> 00:42:01,343
And you're not doing anything

700
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,275
to help the situation
by the way.

701
00:42:02,276 --> 00:42:03,999
What am I supposed to do?

702
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,758
A lot more than
what you are doing.

703
00:42:06,793 --> 00:42:07,758
Kathy, maybe you need to get

704
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,412
out of the house for a while.

705
00:42:09,413 --> 00:42:10,930
All right?

706
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,620
You're right.

707
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,412
I need to get out of this
fucking house period!

708
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,930
Shh, breathe.

709
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:19,451
Kathy, please, you're
not the only one.

710
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,000
Did it kill your dog?

711
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:24,931
No.

712
00:42:24,932 --> 00:42:26,412
It didn't.

713
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:29,102
It killed mine.

714
00:42:29,103 --> 00:42:29,620
Kathy we're a family.

715
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,517
It's after me!

716
00:42:30,518 --> 00:42:31,965
Not you.

717
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:34,102
You know what, you're right.

718
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:35,723
I do need to get out of here.

719
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,930
I'm gonna go to
this spa with Liz.

720
00:42:37,931 --> 00:42:40,274
And when I come back
home, if I come back,

721
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:42,137
maybe I'll be a lot
more positive.

722
00:42:42,172 --> 00:42:43,172
Kathy.

723
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:48,862
Come here, baby.

724
00:42:48,863 --> 00:42:50,516
Come here.

725
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:51,482
It's okay.

726
00:42:51,482 --> 00:42:52,482
Come here.

727
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:54,481
It's okay.

728
00:42:54,482 --> 00:42:55,792
Whoa, here we go!

729
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,309
Whoa!

730
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,310
I want mommy.

731
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:01,586
Everything will be all right.

732
00:43:01,586 --> 00:43:02,586
Daddy's here.

733
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:04,757
I'm not going anywhere.

734
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:06,240
Come on, shh.

735
00:43:06,241 --> 00:43:07,895
This is for you,
close your eyes.

736
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:08,827
Everything will be right.

737
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:10,172
Daddy's here.

738
00:43:35,724 --> 00:43:37,240
Hello?

739
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:38,172
Mr. Taylor.

740
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:39,655
It's Pastor Hunt.

741
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,241
How are you two making out?

742
00:43:43,103 --> 00:43:44,171
Good, good.

743
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:45,172
Kathy ended up at the spa.

744
00:43:45,173 --> 00:43:47,481
She's been gone most of the day.

745
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:48,482
I see.

746
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:53,034
Well we all handle stressful
situations in our own way.

747
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:56,379
Pastor Hunt.

748
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:01,344
I don't know how
much more of this

749
00:44:01,345 --> 00:44:02,827
she's gonna be able to take.

750
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:06,551
It's a very
upsetting situation.

751
00:44:07,724 --> 00:44:08,792
How are you holding up?

752
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,067
Good.

753
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:11,448
Just put Brianna down to sleep.

754
00:44:12,793 --> 00:44:13,826
How was the child's

755
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:14,964
interaction with you two today?

756
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:16,240
Good.

757
00:44:16,241 --> 00:44:17,482
As if nothing ever happened.

758
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:19,758
Okay.

759
00:44:21,344 --> 00:44:23,895
Well I have some things
I wanna share with you,

760
00:44:23,896 --> 00:44:25,067
but I wanna come by and talk

761
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:26,586
to you and your wife together.

762
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:28,310
Good things?

763
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,240
Yes and no.

764
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:33,826
There's some positives
and some negatives.

765
00:44:33,827 --> 00:44:35,275
How bad are the negatives?

766
00:44:35,655 --> 00:44:37,067
Well the
biggest negative is time.

767
00:44:37,068 --> 00:44:38,068
Time?

768
00:44:39,448 --> 00:44:40,757
Yes.

769
00:44:40,758 --> 00:44:42,413
We may not have as
much as I thought.

770
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:45,792
That's why I'm
headed your way now.

771
00:44:45,793 --> 00:44:47,620
I'll be there in 45 minutes.

772
00:44:48,655 --> 00:44:50,240
Okay, good.

773
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:51,137
Kathy should be back by then.

774
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:52,550
I'll see you soon.

775
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:53,724
Yes.

776
00:45:11,206 --> 00:45:11,965
Daddy!

777
00:45:11,965 --> 00:45:12,965
Brianna!

778
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:15,619
The Lord is my light.

779
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,205
And my salvation.

780
00:45:17,206 --> 00:45:19,067
Whom shall I fear?

781
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,585
Daddy!

782
00:45:20,586 --> 00:45:21,206
The Lord is the
strength of my life.

783
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:23,481
Daddy!

784
00:45:23,482 --> 00:45:25,206
She's mine!

785
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,310
Daddy!

786
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,792
Though I walk in the
valley of the shadow

787
00:45:35,793 --> 00:45:38,379
of death I shall fear no evil.

788
00:45:41,068 --> 00:45:42,103
Daddy!

789
00:45:49,793 --> 00:45:51,344
Keep praying!

790
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:06,793
Mr. Taylor?

791
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:28,551
The Lord is
the strength of my light!

792
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,103
Of whom shall I be afraid?

793
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,413
Mr. Taylor.

794
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:36,034
Of the shadow of
death I shall fear no evil.

795
00:46:39,551 --> 00:46:41,550
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

796
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,033
Leonard!

797
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,413
Leonard, hey.

798
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:46,136
Come on.

799
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,137
Come on come on.

800
00:46:48,448 --> 00:46:49,448
Come on.

801
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,241
Come on come on.

802
00:47:00,482 --> 00:47:03,793
My bishop doesn't think
it's an exorcism.

803
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,274
Your daughter's not possessed.

804
00:47:07,275 --> 00:47:10,309
Like we spoke about before,
she's being used as a messenger.

805
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,136
She has something
to tell one of you.

806
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:12,931
The connection in the house-

807
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:13,931
- I think it's me.

808
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:17,793
What?

809
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:19,862
What are you talking about?

810
00:47:24,655 --> 00:47:26,447
The spirit came to
me in the kitchen.

811
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:27,861
I actually saw its face.

812
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:28,930
A face you recognize?

813
00:47:28,931 --> 00:47:29,931
Yes.

814
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:33,103
Are you sure?

815
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,378
When I was little, a girl came

816
00:47:37,379 --> 00:47:38,793
to live with us for a while.

817
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,517
With you and your parents?

818
00:47:40,518 --> 00:47:41,930
No.

819
00:47:41,931 --> 00:47:44,378
My parents died in a car crash.

820
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:46,964
I lived here with
my grandparents.

821
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:49,033
This girl came and lived with
us when she was a teenager.

822
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,034
One day.

823
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,931
She just left.

824
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:57,768
My grandparents
said she ran away.

825
00:47:59,034 --> 00:47:59,862
And how old were you?

826
00:47:59,863 --> 00:48:01,240
Little, seven.

827
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:02,310
Eight.

828
00:48:03,344 --> 00:48:06,516
It was her face I
saw in the kitchen.

829
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:07,999
Baby, I don't know.

830
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,412
It was her.

831
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:10,413
It was her.

832
00:48:14,103 --> 00:48:16,171
You still have the footage
from the video camera correct?

833
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:17,447
Yeah.

834
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:18,757
Yeah, it's on the nanny cam.

835
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:19,895
Can I see it?

836
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,655
Yeah, of course.

837
00:48:33,206 --> 00:48:35,067
This.

838
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:36,655
Is a new device.

839
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:40,688
With many video cameras, a
tiny amount of information

840
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:42,757
from the infrared
spectrum is recorded.

841
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:44,447
This can filter that
and enhance it.

842
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:45,068
Really?

843
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:46,792
Yes.

844
00:48:46,793 --> 00:48:49,999
So if this fits in
here, we can pretty much

845
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,723
see anything that comes
across the screen.

846
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:55,343
It's standard,
so it should fit.

847
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:56,827
Is this an easy process?

848
00:48:57,896 --> 00:48:59,586
This machine-

849
00:48:59,827 --> 00:49:00,724
- No, the spirit.

850
00:49:00,725 --> 00:49:02,000
When will this all be done?

851
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:05,851
Mr. Taylor, how can we
know the answer to that?

852
00:49:07,413 --> 00:49:10,034
How can we know when the
spirit will be heard?

853
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:17,448
The visual is a little blurry.

854
00:49:20,172 --> 00:49:22,067
Now.

855
00:49:22,068 --> 00:49:23,655
When you hit this.

856
00:49:31,896 --> 00:49:32,620
Oh my god!

857
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,379
Please turn it off!

858
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,619
I'm sorry.

859
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:35,930
You don't need to see this.

860
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,758
My peers are the ones
that need to see this.

861
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:38,826
They will have the answers.

862
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:40,724
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to put you...

863
00:49:42,551 --> 00:49:43,586
I'm sorry, man.

864
00:49:44,344 --> 00:49:47,068
She's having a really hard
time with this whole...

865
00:49:47,344 --> 00:49:49,103
I mean I am too.

866
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,103
No need to apologize.

867
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:53,343
But if what you're
saying about the girl

868
00:49:53,344 --> 00:49:55,137
is true you need to
get more information.

869
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:56,757
I mean is there
anyone else you can

870
00:49:56,758 --> 00:49:58,000
talk to who might know more?

871
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,103
My grandfather
might have been able

872
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,688
Haven't tried to talk
to him in years.

873
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,103
Well maybe it's time
you gave it a try.

874
00:50:13,965 --> 00:50:14,965
Okay.

875
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,034
Give me back my medicine!

876
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:52,067
Give me back my medicine!

877
00:50:52,068 --> 00:50:53,895
Barbara, he didn't
take your medicine.

878
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:54,758
Yes he did.

879
00:50:54,758 --> 00:50:55,758
Get outta here.

880
00:51:24,137 --> 00:51:25,172
Excuse me!

881
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,448
Only family members
can come in before 3.

882
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:32,171
I am.

883
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,482
Bernard's my grandfather.

884
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,136
You're not on the list, so.

885
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,723
But he's my grandfather.

886
00:51:39,724 --> 00:51:40,620
Mr. Jones
said he wants you

887
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:42,240
to bring him them meds.

888
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:43,343
Tyree, I can't right now.

889
00:51:43,344 --> 00:51:44,826
Can you just do your job?

890
00:51:44,827 --> 00:51:45,827
Jesus Christ.

891
00:51:45,827 --> 00:51:46,448
Hey!

892
00:51:46,827 --> 00:51:47,482
Hey!

893
00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:48,862
He's eating plants!

894
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,826
Can you please stop
him from eating plants?

895
00:51:50,827 --> 00:51:51,827
Hello!

896
00:51:52,655 --> 00:51:54,137
I don't think you understand.

897
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:56,516
Bernard hasn't had a
visitor in 15 years.

898
00:51:56,517 --> 00:52:00,757
I mean the man doesn't
even speak, so I don't know

899
00:52:00,758 --> 00:52:02,478
what makes you think
he'd wanna talk to you.

900
00:52:02,551 --> 00:52:03,688
No offense.

901
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:05,136
My grandfather raised
me since I was three.

902
00:52:05,137 --> 00:52:06,378
He's like a father to me.

903
00:52:06,379 --> 00:52:07,412
I want him to see what
I've grown to be.

904
00:52:07,413 --> 00:52:08,275
Oh my god.

905
00:52:08,275 --> 00:52:09,275
Please don't deny me that.

906
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:10,723
All right, look,
you have 20 minutes.

907
00:52:10,724 --> 00:52:11,861
Not a minute more.

908
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:12,942
You can sign in over there.

909
00:52:18,379 --> 00:52:20,447
Hey!

910
00:52:20,448 --> 00:52:22,240
236 is up the
stairs to the left.

911
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:24,206
20 minutes.

912
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:29,240
Hey.

913
00:52:29,241 --> 00:52:30,585
People on this wing
can be a little touchy.

914
00:52:30,586 --> 00:52:31,626
I'm just letting you know.

915
00:52:54,206 --> 00:52:55,206
Grandpa.

916
00:52:58,137 --> 00:52:59,861
Grandpa, it's Leonard.

917
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:01,344
I know it's been a
long time, but.

918
00:53:05,172 --> 00:53:06,172
I'm married now.

919
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,620
Beautiful baby girl.

920
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:10,586
Brianna.

921
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,586
You got a great-granddaughter.

922
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:16,931
Grandpa.

923
00:53:18,931 --> 00:53:19,931
Grandpa.

924
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:23,103
Grandpa it's me-

925
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:28,826
- It's me.

926
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:29,827
Leonard.

927
00:53:35,172 --> 00:53:36,205
Hey, hey!

928
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,448
What did I tell you?

929
00:53:38,103 --> 00:53:39,999
He's strong for an old man, huh?

930
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And he quick too.

931
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,264
That old man strength
ain't nothing to play with.

932
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,620
I know I haven't
come to see you.

933
00:53:55,517 --> 00:53:57,137
And I have no excuse for that.

934
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,517
But I'm coming to you
now in need of help.

935
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:12,275
I don't know what's going on,
but my family's in danger.

936
00:54:12,689 --> 00:54:14,482
I've seen things that
I can't explain.

937
00:54:18,931 --> 00:54:20,102
Your time is up.

938
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:21,240
Please, just a
few more minutes.

939
00:54:21,241 --> 00:54:22,000
It's his medication time.

940
00:54:22,068 --> 00:54:23,758
It's time for you to go.

941
00:54:24,034 --> 00:54:25,034
I saw her.

942
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:27,482
I saw Crystal.

943
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:30,550
Grandpa please!

944
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:32,550
She has control my baby girl!

945
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:33,791
Get this man out of here now.

946
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:36,102
Hey!

947
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:37,482
Hey, I'm sorry, you
have to leave!

948
00:54:37,517 --> 00:54:38,688
Grandpa!

949
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:40,172
You have to leave!

950
00:54:42,344 --> 00:54:43,827
No grandpa!

951
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,310
Grandpa!

952
00:54:55,551 --> 00:54:56,551
Grandpa!

953
00:55:02,793 --> 00:55:04,379
Camille.

954
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:07,413
You were pretty like
that girl once.

955
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:08,896
Nice.

956
00:55:09,896 --> 00:55:10,896
Sweet.

957
00:55:11,896 --> 00:55:13,413
But you changed over the years.

958
00:55:13,655 --> 00:55:15,068
Your heart grew cold.

959
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:17,413
A young girl in the house.

960
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,103
You look so beautiful
in this dress.

961
00:55:21,379 --> 00:55:22,379
Was trouble.

962
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:26,724
Hey, let me help you out of it.

963
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:30,551
Everything's gonna be okay.

964
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,068
Pretty just like her mama.

965
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:45,551
Not everybody loved
that baby though.

966
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:54,965
Leonard?

967
00:55:58,068 --> 00:55:59,448
How long have you
been watching me?

968
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,620
Got this for you.

969
00:56:05,655 --> 00:56:07,172
Do you have a
crush on someone?

970
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:10,551
You do.

971
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:13,206
You wanna put it in?

972
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:23,206
It's beautiful.

973
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:28,723
Well I think you're
pretty special too.

974
00:56:28,724 --> 00:56:31,724
But you can't peek on girls
while they're getting dressed.

975
00:56:32,206 --> 00:56:34,999
But since you're my
special little cuddle bug

976
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,655
I guess it's okay this time.

977
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:47,517
You two better get
on to the party.

978
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:58,827
I remember it like
it was yesterday.

979
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:03,689
You remember what?

980
00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:08,931
You remember what?

981
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:12,448
What'd you do?

982
00:57:13,137 --> 00:57:14,793
Okay you need to leave now.

983
00:57:17,448 --> 00:57:19,208
My baby girl doesn't
deserve this, grandpa!

984
00:57:21,448 --> 00:57:22,517
This isn't over!

985
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:40,275
Pastor Hunt.

986
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:43,447
I think I know what happened.

987
00:57:43,448 --> 00:57:45,103
Meet me at my house,
I'm almost there.

988
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:47,965
Okay, wait wait wait.

989
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,586
I know what happened.

990
00:58:11,448 --> 00:58:13,136
He has something to do
with crystal disappearing.

991
00:58:13,137 --> 00:58:14,103
I know he does.

992
00:58:14,103 --> 00:58:15,000
He who?

993
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:15,758
My grandfather.

994
00:58:15,793 --> 00:58:16,517
Here.

995
00:58:16,518 --> 00:58:19,654
This dirt was in
my house before.

996
00:58:19,655 --> 00:58:21,631
As soon as I retrieve her
body this will all be over.

997
00:58:21,655 --> 00:58:22,689
Her soul will be at rest.

998
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:47,655
That bastard.

999
00:59:32,724 --> 00:59:35,000
I see we got the same taste.

1000
00:59:45,517 --> 00:59:46,586
Huh?

1001
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,171
Crystal, go ahead
and finish up

1002
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:51,930
those dishes before
you go to bed.

1003
00:59:51,931 --> 00:59:52,999
You understand?

1004
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yes Camille.

1005
00:59:55,586 --> 00:59:56,724
And honey.

1006
00:59:56,758 --> 00:59:57,724
Yes baby?

1007
00:59:57,725 --> 00:59:59,137
I put Leonard to bed.

1008
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:02,689
And I'll be home
around 8 AM, okay?

1009
01:00:04,724 --> 01:00:06,205
Have a great night.

1010
01:00:06,206 --> 01:00:07,274
You too, baby.

1011
01:00:07,275 --> 01:00:08,275
Love you.

1012
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:09,586
Love you!

1013
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,344
Love you more.

1014
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:20,033
Crystal.

1015
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:22,516
Go upstairs, brush your
teeth, and get into bed.

1016
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:24,482
But she asked
me to put the dishes away.

1017
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:28,000
What did I say?

1018
01:00:30,724 --> 01:00:31,724
Hey.

1019
01:00:45,758 --> 01:00:49,172
♪ Talking about my girl

1020
01:00:49,241 --> 01:00:50,827

1021
01:00:56,689 --> 01:00:57,689

No!

1023
01:01:06,137 --> 01:01:07,137

1029
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,100
Honey would you
like bacon and eggs?

1030
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:46,172
Yes.

1031
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:49,343
Would you like some fruit?

1032
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:50,379
I have some apple here.

1033
01:01:51,551 --> 01:01:52,103
Yes.

1034
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,241
Okay.

1035
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:57,379
Here you go.

1036
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:57,965
How's that look?

1037
01:01:57,965 --> 01:01:58,965
Beautiful.

1038
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,343
All right, great honey.

1039
01:02:00,344 --> 01:02:02,724
Crystal, would you like
to have what he's having?

1040
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:04,655
Yes.

1041
01:02:04,724 --> 01:02:05,724
Okay.

1042
01:02:06,827 --> 01:02:08,724
Quite an appetite
this morning for you.

1043
01:02:13,551 --> 01:02:14,793
Here you go sweetie.

1044
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:36,000
Get this out of my house now.

1045
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:03,379
It's done.

1046
01:03:44,413 --> 01:03:45,413
Crystal?

1047
01:04:01,482 --> 01:04:03,965
You were like a mother to me!

1048
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,758
You let him break me!

1049
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,413
Over and over!

1050
01:04:10,034 --> 01:04:12,137
You never cared!

1051
01:04:19,827 --> 01:04:22,172
Why didn't you help me?

1052
01:04:47,344 --> 01:04:48,792
It's you.

1053
01:04:48,793 --> 01:04:49,826
Hey, hey!

1054
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:50,655
Hey!

1055
01:04:50,656 --> 01:04:52,861
Hey!

1056
01:04:52,862 --> 01:04:54,516
I need to see him now
before the sheriff gets here.

1057
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:55,344
He's about to be
arrested for a murder.

1058
01:04:55,345 --> 01:04:56,654
Murder?

1059
01:04:56,655 --> 01:04:57,655
Nah, I haven't heard that.

1060
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:58,379
You were there, you heard him.

1061
01:04:58,380 --> 01:04:59,999
Nah, I haven't heard that.

1062
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,688
There isn't much time!

1063
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:04,068
Tyree, Tyree, we
need to help this man.

1064
01:05:45,896 --> 01:05:47,379
We got a 1029, roll the ambo.

1065
01:05:51,758 --> 01:05:52,758
It's.

1066
01:05:53,827 --> 01:05:54,827
Not.

1067
01:05:56,344 --> 01:05:58,000
Over.

1068
01:06:17,482 --> 01:06:19,102
Good morning, Mr. Taylor.

1069
01:06:19,103 --> 01:06:20,103
These are the rest of your
grandfather's possessions

1070
01:06:20,104 --> 01:06:21,481
the DA's office turned in to us.

1071
01:06:21,482 --> 01:06:23,413
If you could please sign here.

1072
01:06:28,482 --> 01:06:29,964
Thank you man.

1073
01:06:29,965 --> 01:06:31,757
Yup.

1074
01:06:31,758 --> 01:06:33,826
At least he don't gotta
go on trial for two.

1075
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:34,965
Deputy Timmons.

1076
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:37,551
Two?

1077
01:06:39,448 --> 01:06:40,448
Yeah.

1078
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,964
I guess there's no harm now.

1079
01:06:43,965 --> 01:06:46,045
The coroner found out she
was pregnant when she died.

1080
01:06:46,896 --> 01:06:47,793
Really?

1081
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:48,895
Yeah man.

1082
01:06:48,896 --> 01:06:49,896
Well.

1083
01:06:50,724 --> 01:06:51,724
Sorry man.

1084
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,827
Have a good day.

1085
01:07:05,344 --> 01:07:06,344
What's all this?

1086
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:09,999
Some stuff the
sheriff dropped by.

1087
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,896
Stuff they got off grandpa.

1088
01:07:10,897 --> 01:07:12,724
Okay.

1089
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:25,034
Mama?

1090
01:07:34,206 --> 01:07:36,172
Let me see that picture, baby.

1091
01:08:07,034 --> 01:08:08,412
Leonard.

1092
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:09,551
How could you?

1093
01:08:27,758 --> 01:08:29,309
She can't have her!

1094
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:30,378
Stay away from her!

1095
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:31,103
What, what?

1096
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,931
No!

1097
01:08:31,932 --> 01:08:33,619
No!

1098
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:34,757
What?

1099
01:08:34,758 --> 01:08:35,792
What, who?

1100
01:08:35,793 --> 01:08:37,274
Who?

1101
01:08:37,275 --> 01:08:39,688
Why won't she walk
for me, Leonard?

1102
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:41,378
Why?

1103
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:43,585
She never calls me mama anymore!

1104
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:44,688
Kathy.

1105
01:08:44,689 --> 01:08:46,378
Kathy don't.

1106
01:08:46,379 --> 01:08:47,758
No, something changed.

1107
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:51,274
Ever since we moved
into this house!

1108
01:08:51,275 --> 01:08:53,654
Kathy it's okay, baby.

1109
01:08:53,655 --> 01:08:56,205
You said when you
dug up the bones

1110
01:08:56,206 --> 01:08:58,447
that it was gonna be it.

1111
01:08:58,448 --> 01:08:59,999
That's what you said!

1112
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,343
No no no, babe, you're
just having a bad stretch.

1113
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:03,033
No, you don't understand!

1114
01:09:03,034 --> 01:09:06,102
She's not haunting your
dreams every night for months.

1115
01:09:06,103 --> 01:09:07,412
No, stop it!

1116
01:09:07,413 --> 01:09:08,413
Kathy, Kathy!

1117
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,137
She can have her.

1118
01:09:25,034 --> 01:09:26,343
Kathy what are you-

1119
01:09:26,344 --> 01:09:27,999
- That is not my baby.

1120
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,551
What are you talking about?

1121
01:09:28,552 --> 01:09:29,654
That is not my baby.

1122
01:09:29,655 --> 01:09:31,723
That's not my daughter!

1123
01:09:31,724 --> 01:09:32,206
Listen, you have
to get it together.

1124
01:09:32,207 --> 01:09:33,999
I need you.

1125
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
This is something we have to do.

1126
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:36,861
There's not other option, Kathy.

1127
01:09:36,862 --> 01:09:39,310
Leonard, I love you, but
I cannot do this anymore.

1128
01:09:40,827 --> 01:09:43,171
We can start over!

1129
01:09:43,172 --> 01:09:44,137
We will start over.

1130
01:09:44,137 --> 01:09:45,177
We'll pray all night long.

1131
01:09:46,103 --> 01:09:47,136
No!

1132
01:09:47,137 --> 01:09:48,723
Without her!

1133
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:50,895
We're gonna start
over without her.

1134
01:09:50,896 --> 01:09:51,999
What the hell are you
talking about, Kathy?

1135
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,080
We can have another baby!

1136
01:09:55,965 --> 01:09:58,861
It's obvious that
Crystal, the spirit,

1137
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:00,502
or whatever the fuck
it is, wants Brianna!

1138
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:03,344
And if you can't tell.

1139
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,586
That is not Brianna anymore!

1140
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:11,619
There's not enough prayer

1141
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,999
in the world that
could change that.

1142
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,619
Why are you giving
up on your faith?

1143
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:16,620
Why are you giving up on us?

1144
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:18,171
I can't fight this!

1145
01:10:18,172 --> 01:10:19,655
I can't fight this anymore.

1146
01:10:22,344 --> 01:10:23,654
What do you want
me to do, Kathy?

1147
01:10:23,655 --> 01:10:26,793
I want you to man the fuck up!

1148
01:10:28,551 --> 01:10:30,448
We're giving this baby away.

1149
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:34,447
I can't believe you
wanna give her away!

1150
01:10:34,448 --> 01:10:36,517
Leonard, we don't
have a choice.

1151
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:41,861
How are we supposed
to do this Kathy?

1152
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:42,793
A shelter.

1153
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:44,136
An orphanage.

1154
01:10:44,137 --> 01:10:45,344
I don't know.

1155
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:49,136
I don't care if we gotta go
to a goddamn police station.

1156
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:50,103
Kathy.

1157
01:10:50,103 --> 01:10:51,103
Stop it.

1158
01:10:57,793 --> 01:10:58,793
Are you ready?

1159
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:02,067
Leonard look at me.

1160
01:11:02,068 --> 01:11:03,068
Look at me.

1161
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:05,137
Baby look at me.

1162
01:11:06,517 --> 01:11:08,241
I know this is hard okay?

1163
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,067
I don't wanna do it
either, but we have to.

1164
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:13,240
We have to.

1165
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:14,241
Okay?

1166
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:24,241
We gotta go.

1167
01:11:57,344 --> 01:11:59,378
It's okay.

1168
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:00,827
You'll be all right, baby.

1169
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,310
Okay.

1170
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:07,310
Daddy loves you.

1171
01:12:10,103 --> 01:12:11,103
Daddy loves you.

1172
01:12:21,413 --> 01:12:22,930
Daddy loves you, okay?

1173
01:12:22,931 --> 01:12:24,136
Leonard!

1174
01:12:24,137 --> 01:12:25,137
Let's go!

1175
01:13:13,586 --> 01:13:15,626
Babe, you know what I could
really go for right now?

1176
01:13:16,137 --> 01:13:17,172
I don't know.

1177
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:18,379
Let me guess.

1178
01:13:21,448 --> 01:13:22,517
Me.

1179
01:13:24,344 --> 01:13:25,241
Always.

1180
01:13:25,242 --> 01:13:26,826
I always do that.

1181
01:13:26,827 --> 01:13:31,000
But you would go really good.

1182
01:13:32,482 --> 01:13:34,655
With some chocolate
chip cookie dough.

1183
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:35,964
So you want me
to go to the store

1184
01:13:35,965 --> 01:13:37,412
and get you some ice
cream when you got

1185
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,034
this sexy chocolate
brownie right here?

1186
01:13:40,068 --> 01:13:41,965
Oh you gonna go on
top of the ice cream.

1187
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:47,379
Baby if you go, you'd be
the best husband ever.

1188
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:50,448
Plus I got a little
surprise for you tonight.

1189
01:13:51,206 --> 01:13:52,034
A surprise?

1190
01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:53,034
Mmmhm.

1191
01:13:53,275 --> 01:13:56,379
But I'm only gonna tell you
if you get me the ice cream.

1192
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:58,378
You know I like surprises.

1193
01:13:58,379 --> 01:14:00,631
If I go all the way to the
store and get you some ice cream

1194
01:14:00,655 --> 01:14:03,896
I want the freakiest sex
ever when I get back.

1195
01:14:04,137 --> 01:14:05,137
Okay, that's a deal.

1196
01:14:06,896 --> 01:14:07,724
I'm serious, Kathy.

1197
01:14:07,725 --> 01:14:09,619
I'm serious too, baby.

1198
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:10,660
Look, you go to the store.

1199
01:14:11,793 --> 01:14:12,862
And while you're gone.

1200
01:14:14,896 --> 01:14:16,413
I'll get in the shower.

1201
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,619
And by the time you get
back, I'm gonna be naked.

1202
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:24,206
Matter of fact, I'm not even
gonna dry off after the shower.

1203
01:14:24,896 --> 01:14:26,586
You know I like that.

1204
01:14:53,068 --> 01:14:55,034
I can't believe
I'm pregnant again.

1205
01:14:59,137 --> 01:15:00,137
Thank you God.

1206
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:07,586
Mommy.

1207
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:17,206
Brianna?

1208
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:21,172
Brianna.

1209
01:15:55,275 --> 01:15:56,275
Yes sir.

1210
01:15:57,827 --> 01:15:59,792
You got a good man, girl.

1211
01:15:59,793 --> 01:16:02,724
It's about to go down.

1212
01:16:04,551 --> 01:16:05,827
It's about to go down.

1213
01:16:10,724 --> 01:16:11,724
Babe!

1214
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:14,586
I got the whipped cream
and the strawberries!

1215
01:16:16,068 --> 01:16:17,241
It's about to go down!

1216
01:16:18,896 --> 01:16:19,896
Babe!

1217
01:16:21,517 --> 01:16:22,689
Babe!

1218
01:16:51,689 --> 01:16:52,689
Kathy!

1219
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,241
Daddy!

1220
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:09,758
I've been waiting for you.

1221
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,241
Do you have a gift for me?

1222
01:17:25,068 --> 01:17:26,896
I miss you, my
little cuddle bug.

1223
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,620
Pastor Hunt.

1224
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:42,964
What's going on with you?

1225
01:17:42,965 --> 01:17:44,102
How you doing man?

1226
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:45,143
- Good, good.
- Mr. Taylor.

1227
01:17:45,965 --> 01:17:47,171
So I haven't seen
you guys in a while.

1228
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:48,274
Everything okay?

1229
01:17:48,275 --> 01:17:49,103
Yeah, everything's fine.

1230
01:17:49,103 --> 01:17:50,000
So far.

1231
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:50,827
How's the family?

1232
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:51,758
How's Kathy doing?

1233
01:17:51,759 --> 01:17:52,895
She's great.

1234
01:17:52,896 --> 01:17:54,136
A changed woman.

1235
01:17:54,137 --> 01:17:55,240
Wow, well that's
excellent news.

1236
01:17:55,241 --> 01:17:56,274
Yeah.

1237
01:17:56,275 --> 01:17:57,895
Yeah.

1238
01:17:57,896 --> 01:17:59,412
Well I gotta get back.

1239
01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:00,585
I was just in the area.

1240
01:18:00,586 --> 01:18:02,067
Decided to stop by and check in.

1241
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:03,896
Okay, I appreciate that.

1242
01:18:04,034 --> 01:18:05,034
Thanks.

1243
01:18:06,482 --> 01:18:07,482
Pastor Hunt.

1244
01:18:09,034 --> 01:18:10,757
Appreciate you for looking
after Bri until Kathy...

1245
01:18:10,758 --> 01:18:12,518
I had a feeling she
would come back around.

1246
01:18:13,862 --> 01:18:14,896
You have a good one.

1247
01:18:14,965 --> 01:18:15,965
You too, man.

1248
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,034
How you doing?

1249
01:18:41,034 --> 01:18:43,034
I see we got the same taste.
