1
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:22,318
( music playing )

2
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,786
Man:
Relax. Good.

3
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:58,921
Just leave it like that.
Yeah, just leave it there.

4
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,790
Maybe you could put
your hands up on her legs?

5
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:05,761
Um... let's see.

6
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:08,063
We need to squeeze
you in a little bit more.

7
00:01:10,064 --> 00:01:13,768
You turn around.
Yeah, turn around.
That's really good.

8
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:15,169
That's fantastic.

9
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:18,138
Take a... Wilty.
Hello?

10
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:20,174
You're dreaming about
being on holiday, mate.

11
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:23,011
All right.
Let's get set up.

12
00:01:23,044 --> 00:01:24,946
Let's see,
what else?

13
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:27,080
- If you just lift your head up
just a little bit.
- All right.

14
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:29,818
Okay, but not that much.

15
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:31,185
- Okay.
- Like this?

16
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:33,354
- And smile.
- Who was out last night?

17
00:01:35,423 --> 00:01:37,892
- ( chatter, laughing )
- Who was out last night?

18
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:41,262
Huh? Just two of you.

19
00:01:41,295 --> 00:01:44,065
Just two of you
out last night.

20
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:48,368
- Really?
- Woman: Yeah, we were
in bed at nine.

21
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,239
Should I believe this?
Do you think I should
believe this?

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,241
What do you reckon, Wilty?

23
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:58,812
- Wilty is-- Wilty is--
- I wasn't listening.

24
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:01,314
Wilty's Mr. Party Man.
He goes out to all the clubs.

25
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:04,217
- I was getting
ready for this shoot.
- ( models laughing )

26
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:09,890
- ( chatter )
- How was that one, Wilt?

27
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:12,860
- Get out of there!
- Who's the brunette
woman there?

28
00:02:12,893 --> 00:02:15,028
- That's not Arrianne, is it?
- No, no, no. That's Ashley.

29
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:17,030
- I think she's gonna
join us for dinner.
- Really?

30
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:18,398
Yeah, and then maybe
a little something-something
afterwards.

31
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,367
- Okay.
- If you're good.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,836
She must do yoga.

33
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,872
I didn't get
you arrangements
for the girls.

34
00:02:24,905 --> 00:02:26,874
I did
because you didn't.

35
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,108
- I did.
- Is there a problem?

36
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,942
- No.
- No problem. Relax.

37
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:32,111
What does
any of this mean?

38
00:02:32,144 --> 00:02:35,115
Don't you at least
get a vodka bottle
in your bag?

39
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:38,951
There was--
do you wanna do that?

40
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,920
- It would take up
some more time.
- Well, we don't have one.

41
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,890
We don't have one.

42
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:46,258
Oh, God.

43
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:49,929
All right. Listen,
you hold the fort.

44
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,231
- I'm gonna go scream
at somebody.
- Yeah.

45
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:55,001
Make me feel better.

46
00:02:55,034 --> 00:02:56,902
- We're at a campaign.
- I know where--

47
00:02:56,935 --> 00:02:59,271
- You're asking me for a--
- No one's gonna see this.

48
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,873
- You know that. I know it.
- I don't want to hear
"any minute" again.

49
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:03,275
- No, 15 minutes.
- 15?

50
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:07,279
- We've got an exact time now.
- Why is it that it's our job
to get her here?

51
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:10,349
I'm sorry.
That's not your job?
It's your job.

52
00:03:10,382 --> 00:03:12,885
- You booked her.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

53
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,186
How's everything going?
Looks beautiful.

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,055
- Yeah, you like it?
- Love them.

55
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:19,358
- It was your idea, right?
- That's right. Whose else?

56
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,293
- I don't know.
- Naked girls. What else
do you think?

57
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,195
- Solves anything.
- You guys really
are beautiful.

58
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:27,065
- You don't like it?
- So are you.

59
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:29,167
You're in the moment.

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,903
- Do you know what the term
"zeitgeist" means?
- Yes.

61
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,939
Do you?
You are in
the zeitgeist.

62
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,240
You are in
the moment.

63
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:38,176
- What does that say to you?
- That says...

64
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:41,445
Mercedes, vodka, Lego.
Whatever you want.

65
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:43,048
- Just anything.
- Doesn't make a difference.

66
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:44,049
Just put it right
at the bottom.

67
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:48,454
You know what?
Can you grab my
cell phone?

68
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:50,455
- Yeah, sure.
- Do you have it?
Can I have it?

69
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,490
- Wow.
- ( laughing )

70
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:56,161
- This is...
- Why all the whispers?

71
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,329
- this is unique.
- Um...

72
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,264
- I mean, you're not
doing this, are you?
- Don't worry, baby.

73
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,232
- It's not me.
- Arrianne, oh, my goodness.

74
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:04,335
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Good to see you.

75
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,171
- This is Anthony Heywood,
the photographer.
- Anthony Heywood.

76
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,939
- How are you?
- Good. Of course.

77
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:08,973
- How are you doing?
- Good.

78
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:11,141
Listen,
we're ready to go.

79
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:14,178
So, uh...
you get comfortable

80
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:15,946
and take your time, but I'll
get you in and out of here.

81
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,248
- Is this the shot?
- Yeah, this is the shot.

82
00:04:18,282 --> 00:04:20,117
- Did you meet Billy?
- Hi, Billy. How are you?

83
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,485
- How you doing?
- How are you?

84
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:23,954
- This is Oliver.
- Hi, Oliver. How you doing?

85
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,956
So, listen.
We'll get you anything
you want and let's just--

86
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:28,959
- To be honest,
I'm a little concerned.
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:31,095
I don't really get it.
The whole naked thing.

88
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:33,264
I wasn't told
about that and...

89
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:36,967
- Oh.
- You know what? I spoke to
Allison just 10 minutes ago.

90
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,470
- About what?
- You guys should
talk about this.

91
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,272
- Hi, I'm Arrianne.
- You guys should
talk about it.

92
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:45,141
Nice to meet you.
I'm so happy to meet
you in person.

93
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:47,544
You know, we should
have a little discussion
about this.

94
00:04:47,577 --> 00:04:50,114
- I'm a little concerned.
- What seems to be the problem?

95
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:52,216
I wasn't quite sure
that there was going
to be the nudity.

96
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,517
- We can talk about this.
- She's incredible.

97
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,286
- Hey, if there's any
problems, you come get me.
- Terrific. No worries.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,255
- Thanks.
- Arrianne,
just a minute of your time.

99
00:04:59,288 --> 00:05:01,357
- This is Phil and Russell.
- Hi.

100
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,993
- I'm so sorry.
- Arrianne, we are running
just a bit late.

101
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:05,528
I'm Arrianne.
Nice to meet you.

102
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:08,397
Let them-- these are the guys
that are paying for everything.

103
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:10,999
Heywood:
We'll be right out.
Let's deal with this first.

104
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:15,071
So I'm thinking--
I'm having an idea.

105
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:19,309
I'm going,
"What would make
Lorenzo happy?"

106
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,610
And I think of my friend
Melissa-- besides you, Guido.

107
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,579
I think of
my friend Melissa.

108
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:27,116
I say, "Here is a girl
who has been designing
all her life,

109
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,351
creating very
interesting things.

110
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:33,022
Perhaps, Lorenzo,
you would be interested
in hearing a bit

111
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,225
about what she does
in an effort

112
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,027
- to maybe open the line
a little bit. Maybe.
- By all means.

113
00:05:39,061 --> 00:05:41,163
- Melissa: If I could take
a moment of your time.
- By all mean.

114
00:05:41,196 --> 00:05:44,499
Just to let you know
what I have coming out
into the future.

115
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:47,335
I have a new concept called

116
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:50,172
music underwear.

117
00:05:50,205 --> 00:05:52,174
Now hear me out
on this one.

118
00:05:52,207 --> 00:05:54,376
What happens is--
a girl scenario.

119
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,277
A girl comes in.
She's making love
to her husband.

120
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,046
She's taking off
her clothes.

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,447
The panties come down
and all of a sudden you hear,

122
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,316
"Let's get it on."

123
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:04,053
It's a microchip.
I can also put them in bras.

124
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,554
And I'm thinking about
putting them in a line
of dresses, too.

125
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:09,157
- Lorenzo: Aha.
- You know, you don't have
to go to the stereo.

126
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,393
It's already right there.
Romantic, whatever.

127
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:12,627
- Sewn into the band.
- Like the birthday card
you open up

128
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,295
and they play
"Happy Birthday"
to you.

129
00:06:14,328 --> 00:06:15,662
- Aren't those cool?
- Right.

130
00:06:15,696 --> 00:06:18,600
- Hello? It's great, huh?
- Clever idea.

131
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:21,636
Into the 21st century.
The kids-- the MTV generation's
gonna love it.

132
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:24,338
Very inventive.
No question about it.

133
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:27,108
Where do you
keep the batteries?
If you don't mind my asking.

134
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:31,078
She told us no pubic hair.
That's what we agreed on.

135
00:06:31,112 --> 00:06:33,180
- I-I--
- Okay, who's sitting
in the chair

136
00:06:33,214 --> 00:06:36,317
and who's working
for you right now?

137
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,120
- Am I working with you?
- You are indeed working
with us.

138
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:41,487
- Do you want to work with me?
- But the agent is
the go-between.

139
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:44,125
- That's right.
They're the go between.
- Now, she's the one

140
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,093
- who's supposed to
negotiate the contract.
- I'm here right now.

141
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:48,396
I'm not gonna do it.
Figure it out.

142
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,401
Arrianne,
I'll tell you what.

143
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:57,171
I'm gonna get on
the horn with Allison

144
00:06:57,204 --> 00:07:00,506
- and see if we can't
work this out, okay?
- There's nothing to work out.

145
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,610
I don't understand
what you're not quite
getting about no.

146
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,514
- Does not sound good.
- Manager: Get her out here.

147
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:10,350
- Do you understand--
- In front of the camera.

148
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,218
- In front of the camera.
That's all I'm asking.
- It's not gonna happen.

149
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,454
If I go in there,
it will be like
the third--

150
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,257
- you go in there
and ask her, then Anthony--
- Just get her in front--

151
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,692
get her in front of the camera!
Just get her in front
of the camera.

152
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,495
- Just get her
in front of the camera.
- Back off, Jackie Brown.

153
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:25,131
What if I tell you that--

154
00:07:25,165 --> 00:07:28,268
obviously won't
see anything.

155
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,672
You'll be covered up.
It'll be very tasteful.

156
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,308
- Are you still trying here?
- I'm still...

157
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,176
- Trying.
- Yeah.

158
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,178
You're not
gonna get this.

159
00:07:42,615 --> 00:07:45,150
You're not
gonna get it.

160
00:07:45,184 --> 00:07:47,720
It's a very

161
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:50,323
fast-moving cancer.

162
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:54,626
And there's no cure.

163
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,729
And there is no treatment.

164
00:07:57,762 --> 00:07:59,564
None.

165
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,435
Only treatment
to make you comfortable.

166
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:12,511
You'll either...
( sighs )

167
00:08:12,544 --> 00:08:17,183
...find yourself
( sighs )

168
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:20,519
going into coma
at the end

169
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:22,554
or pneumonia
will take you.

170
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:29,260
You know,
I was work on

171
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,663
a new suit for men.

172
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:34,566
Is different

173
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,601
because you have Armani--
you have the long jacket.

174
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:39,470
I have new idea.

175
00:08:39,503 --> 00:08:42,506
I have to make little short

176
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,444
and cinching of the waist
like the dirty movie star.

177
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:48,346
With the long,
full trouser

178
00:08:48,379 --> 00:08:50,481
going all the way
to the floor.

179
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:53,751
And the hair--
you know the all cut--
shaved hair.

180
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,452
I don't like.
I like the long thing.

181
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,788
He's walk the dog,
you see?

182
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:08,299
I was not ready.
Hey, you're never ready, eh?

183
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,234
For such thing.

184
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,769
It's funny that you see
in the movie,

185
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,304
they say,
"You are going to die."

186
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:17,275
"Oh, I'm out of the deal,"
you know?

187
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,742
I'm going to die.

188
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,479
Well, we all have to die.

189
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:24,647
- Take care of yourself.
- Yes.

190
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:28,718
- You call me if you feel
the slightest problem.
- Yes, yes.

191
00:09:28,751 --> 00:09:31,588
- Andrew, you get cab
for doctor.
- Of course.

192
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:33,590
Love you like always.

193
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,625
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Guido.

194
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,660
- Harold.
- Bye-bye.

195
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:41,864
- Well?
- Is fine.

196
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:44,501
- Everything fine.
- What did he say?

197
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:46,670
It's all negative.
It's fine.

198
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:49,672
Everything fine.

199
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:52,675
I have to go
upstairs and work.
Everything fine.

200
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,312
Okay. Okay.

201
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,447
( music playing )

202
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,389
Anthony?

203
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,824
- Oh hey.
- Hey.

204
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:45,827
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to wake you up.

205
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:49,698
- Mm-mm. I fell asleep.
- Yeah.

206
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:57,505
- How are you?
- What?

207
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,811
How are you?

208
00:11:03,844 --> 00:11:05,846
( softly )
Good.

209
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,896
Okay, you know what?
Here's an idea.

210
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,365
I got an idea.
Why don't you do your job?
How 'bout that?

211
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,367
I can talk to you
any way I feel like.

212
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:28,568
- I cannot wait to tell
Camille about this.
- Hold on one second.

213
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:30,805
She is going to flip out.

214
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:32,773
- It's just the best thing
that's happened.
- Yeah, she is.

215
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,442
- You have that
appointment at 3:00?
- Hey, Ramon.

216
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,943
Who won the game last night?
Anybody good?

217
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,846
I don't know.
It's sort of like
the obvious choice.

218
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,915
- Okay, I'll call 'em
first thing in the morning.
- If you're gonna to go with--

219
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,851
- Thanks.
- I will write it
down right now.

220
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:47,454
I can't wait to tell Camille.
She's gonna be thrilled.

221
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,923
- Man: I got a call from Liam.
- ( chatter )

222
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,526
Oh, that's excellent.
Listen, I got a call
from Liam.

223
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,927
- He's really sorry, but he has
to put a hold on the orders.
- Yes, definitely.

224
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,531
- Why is that?
- He's not comfortable
until he sees the show.

225
00:11:57,564 --> 00:11:59,767
Well, that doesn't
make sense.

226
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,670
- Hi, Blair.
- Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

227
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,938
No, no, no, no.
I'll have her come out.
Just not now, okay?

228
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:08,842
We'll have a meeting.
I'll take care of it.
I promise.

229
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,911
- So we got a call
from "Mademoiselle"...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

230
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:14,448
and "Enchanté"
and they're not gonna
be able to make it

231
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:16,550
until they hear
from you first.

232
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:18,752
Okay, I'll call her.
I don't think that should
be a problem.

233
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:19,919
I don't either,
but you should
get on it.

234
00:12:19,953 --> 00:12:22,555
Okay.
I'll do that.

235
00:12:22,588 --> 00:12:23,756
- Don't forget
lunch tomorrow.
- Check the board.

236
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,558
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
Don't forget.

237
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:28,762
Also, schedule me
that blow-dry for
next week.

238
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:31,664
Man:
What are you
hiding, Simon?

239
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:33,432
- What's his damage?
- Let's look at these.

240
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,534
Oh, I see what
he's hiding here.

241
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,869
- Man: Oh, this is fun.
- Okay.

242
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:38,504
Well, we thought
that Corso

243
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:40,638
shouldn't be sitting
next to Bornio because--

244
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,007
well, think about
their past.

245
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,444
You know what I mean?
They hate each other.

246
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:46,980
And if we put Corso
across from Bornio,
there'd be a little...

247
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,014
- All right,
I'll move 'em back.
- ...energy.

248
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,583
- All righty.
- That's not gonna work.

249
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,551
- Why?
- Why?

250
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,453
Why don't you just
put Woody next to Mia?
Man, they hate each other.

251
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:57,956
Like semaphore.
They can tell each other
to fuck off with flags.

252
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,758
- I like that.
- It'd be perfect.

253
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:01,760
- That's what I was going for.
- Nice language.

254
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,762
- Lunch today and tomorrow,
don't be late.
- Simon?

255
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:05,731
- Where did Janice--
we were getting lunch.
- Are you all right?

256
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:07,999
She cancelled.

257
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:11,603
She phoned a couple hours ago
to say that she wouldn't
be able to make it.

258
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,479
Did she call or did
an assistant call?

259
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:24,649
- I spoke to her.
- Why is it so quiet in here?

260
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,663
Woman:
I just need to make sure
the skirt's right.

261
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:42,066
Hi, Alfred.

262
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:47,038
Why aren't you sewing?

263
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:48,940
It's not ready.

264
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,677
Blair.
Blair, why are you
doing the fitting?

265
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,712
What the hell does it
look like I'm doing?

266
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:58,650
Nobody's here
to do this.

267
00:13:58,683 --> 00:14:00,817
- Chloe?
- Mm-hmm.

268
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:03,887
- You're pinning, too?
- I was pinning, but I'm now
leaving.

269
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,022
- We had two models show up--
- Don't-- don't go.

270
00:14:06,056 --> 00:14:08,925
and nobody's here
to put these girls--

271
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,631
- they're anxious to leave.
- Oh, gracious.

272
00:14:13,665 --> 00:14:15,066
- All right--
- Where is Camille?

273
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:17,068
Ladies,
we're obviously
at an impasse.

274
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:19,570
I think maybe the thing
to do is call it a day.

275
00:14:19,603 --> 00:14:21,738
I need to talk
to you and we just relax

276
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:23,574
and we'll come back--
we'll start fresh
tomorrow, okay?

277
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,542
- This doesn't look right.
- What is the point of staying?

278
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:28,011
- It's not you,
but what is going on?
- We need to regroup

279
00:14:28,044 --> 00:14:30,146
- and do this tomorrow.
- I'm not a clothing designer.

280
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,882
- Look, Roberta.
I'm a shoe designer.
- I know.

281
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:33,950
- You're doing a great job.
- I have to go.

282
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,986
- I'm confused.
- This is a good time
to take a break.

283
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,887
- You're confused?
- We're not getting anywhere.

284
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,557
Where are the rest
of the dresses, though?

285
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:42,826
Woman:
Hey, how are you?

286
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,961
- Good.
- Hi, Penny.

287
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:48,698
Hi, Roberta.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
If I could just have a second.

288
00:14:48,731 --> 00:14:52,134
I just wanted to let you know
I'm not gonna have time to do
the show this season.

289
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,069
I know this is
really late notice.

290
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,640
- I have to get going.
- No, no. Just stay, okay?

291
00:14:56,673 --> 00:14:58,609
- Roberta, listen.
I understand--
- I know that you're busy.

292
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:00,844
We'll help you--
what do you need?
Do you need a car?

293
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:03,679
- Roberta,
I don't need anything.
- What do you need?

294
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,581
There comes a time

295
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,883
when you just move on.

296
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,686
- Roberta, I'm sorry.
- Can you move on
after the show?

297
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,655
- Roberta, no. I can't.
- That's all I'm asking.

298
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,889
- I can't do the show.
- Please, don't leave.

299
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:15,725
- Come on, Ro.
- Denis.

300
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:17,126
- Listen, you are my friend.
- I gotta go.

301
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,094
- Dennis, can you please talk--
- I gotta be outta here.

302
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,096
- Five minutes, all right?
- Everybody, everybody--

303
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,765
I can see you've
got your hands full.

304
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,134
Roberta, you've
got your hands full.
I'll come back tomorrow.

305
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:29,138
- We'll talk about it
then, okay? Good luck.
- Roberta: You can't leave.

306
00:15:29,171 --> 00:15:31,640
- Dennis?!
- Dennis: Yes, yes.

307
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:34,142
- Go get her! She's leaving!
- Dennis: I'm going, I'm going.

308
00:15:34,175 --> 00:15:36,911
Roberta:
She's quitting the show!
Jesus! Where's Camille?

309
00:15:44,787 --> 00:15:46,789
( groans )

310
00:16:11,813 --> 00:16:13,648
- ( giggles )
- Hey.

311
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,649
- Hi.
- Hey.

312
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

313
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:23,691
- Wow.
- Do you have my dress
over there?

314
00:16:23,724 --> 00:16:27,195
- You're getting dressed?
- Yeah, I just have to
pee really bad.

315
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:29,698
- Oh, you do?
- Mm-hmm.

316
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:35,268
I don't see it.
Oh, here, here.

317
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:41,209
Look.

318
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,746
Jamie. Jamie.

319
00:16:46,914 --> 00:16:48,916
Jamie...

320
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:24,717
Hey, do you like eggs?
I got-- or pancakes.

321
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:26,920
- I'm starving.
- Yeah--

322
00:17:26,954 --> 00:17:29,989
I don't know about you,
but I didn't eat anything
at that party last night.

323
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:33,125
Yeah, I really--
I have so much
stuff to do.

324
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:35,928
I didn't realize
how late it was.

325
00:17:35,962 --> 00:17:37,796
- What do you mean?
You're heading out?
- Yeah.

326
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:40,066
Now?
( stammers )

327
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:43,736
- The show's in three days,
so I really have to go.
- Oh, I know.

328
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,738
- But maybe we can--
I can give you my number--
- I was just gonna make--

329
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:48,774
Oh, too bad.

330
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:51,977
- I was gonna make
a whole breakfast.
- Yeah.

331
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,879
Oh.

332
00:17:54,913 --> 00:17:58,150
Well, Camille.

333
00:17:58,184 --> 00:17:59,919
- Hi.
- Hi.

334
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:01,754
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

335
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,789
Good morning.

336
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,760
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

337
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:10,897
Gee, is it
my eyes?

338
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,031
I hope you
don't feel--

339
00:18:13,064 --> 00:18:15,767
I'm not like
that usually.

340
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:18,770
I don't know what
you think about what happened
last night-- was wonderful,

341
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:20,171
but that was
kind of radical.

342
00:18:20,205 --> 00:18:22,006
I don't--

343
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:25,076
I hope you--
in no way did you think
that I was trying to--

344
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,046
as quick as possible
get you--

345
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,080
get you or something
like that because--

346
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,953
I'd love to very slowly
get to know you.

347
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:40,090
So I hope in no way
that you think--

348
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:42,961
this is what I do

349
00:18:42,994 --> 00:18:46,798
or this was a game to me
or something like that.

350
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:48,132
- Okay.
- Okay.

351
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:50,000
- Are you headed off?
- Yeah.

352
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,936
Let me walk you to the thing.
Did I say something wrong?

353
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,873
No, no, no.
That's good.

354
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:56,842
All right.
I feel so sweet
towards you.

355
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:59,176
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

356
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,847
Look, you are
a very nice person
and everything,

357
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,882
but I am not some--
you know.

358
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:10,220
I know your thing that you do.
I know your type and--

359
00:19:10,254 --> 00:19:13,390
- I just said...
- No, I just don't want you
to think that I'm some person

360
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:15,424
who does this all
the time either.

361
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,427
I know--

362
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,965
- I just-- I'm not
that person.
- Camille.

363
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:24,433
Camille, wow.
This is really hurt--

364
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,403
- No, I don't want-- okay.
- Jeez.

365
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,376
What do you do...

366
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,411
exactly?

367
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:42,218
You mean for Fantasia
and the job?

368
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:44,287
You know, I, uh...

369
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:49,225
discover new talent.
That's the job description.

370
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:56,465
The people
that we work with--
I'm a facilitator.

371
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:59,868
- A facilitator?
- Yes.

372
00:19:59,902 --> 00:20:02,037
- Is that a funny word?
- ( giggles )

373
00:20:04,907 --> 00:20:08,110
I give you whatever you need
to do what you need to do.

374
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:11,013
- Anything?
- That's right.

375
00:20:11,046 --> 00:20:13,049
That's right.

376
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,921
I have to go.

377
00:20:20,288 --> 00:20:23,526
- You have to go?
- I have some fittings.

378
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,195
They're gonna be crazy.

379
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:31,466
- I've been gone all day.
- I know you have.

380
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,003
I know you have.

381
00:20:41,076 --> 00:20:44,912
- What time's your plane?
- Soon.

382
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:47,181
I hate that.
I hate being late
to the airport.

383
00:20:47,214 --> 00:20:50,351
- Do you feel anxious?
- We're not gonna be late.

384
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:54,922
- He decrees it.
- You're the one who's late.

385
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:57,292
Oh, well,

386
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:59,962
I know we had a timetable,
but I've been spending time

387
00:20:59,995 --> 00:21:03,230
with her
and I just don't know.

388
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,233
I don't know.

389
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:09,371
What?

390
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:12,139
You know?

391
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,540
No, I don't know.

392
00:21:13,574 --> 00:21:16,110
- What?
- Maybe not the one for us.

393
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:18,379
- She's not the one for us?
- That's right.

394
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,984
Why's that?

395
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:30,023
Lots of reasons.
She's not--

396
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,093
I don't think
she'd fit in.

397
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:37,030
- I don't think
she'd fit in.
- Why not?

398
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:40,266
She's a sweet girl.
Wants to do her thing.

399
00:21:42,003 --> 00:21:45,239
Her past stuff
is kind of far out.

400
00:21:45,272 --> 00:21:48,208
I don't think
it's the right idea.

401
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,543
Look at you.
( chuckles )

402
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,181
Just set up the meeting.

403
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:10,063
( mumbling )

404
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,434
- Hey.
- Woman: Hey.

405
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,137
- How you doing?
- Good.

406
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,272
- You?
- What? Huh?

407
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:23,043
- You?
- Good. I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

408
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,247
What are you doing here?

409
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,583
- Day off.
- You have the day off?

410
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,388
Wanted to, wanted to see you
for a change.

411
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,492
Oh, yeah.

412
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,395
We should go away
somewhere.

413
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:47,032
How many days
holiday do you got?

414
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,534
- Let's go away somewhere.
- Just through the weekend.

415
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,137
- Hmm?
- Just through the weekend.

416
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:55,507
Right.
Well, not
this weekend.

417
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,043
It's going to be tough
to go away this weekend.

418
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,311
No, we should
plan a holiday.

419
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,646
We should plan
and go away somewhere.

420
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,383
Why don't we just
plan something today?

421
00:23:05,416 --> 00:23:08,452
- Okay.
- Are you too tired?

422
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:11,055
No, I'm fine.
I'm wired, man.

423
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,624
I'm up.

424
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,461
What do you want to do?

425
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,498
I don't know.
We could eat something.

426
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:23,302
Walk around.
Talk maybe.

427
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:28,572
Okay. We could
eat something here.

428
00:23:28,606 --> 00:23:30,608
We could talk here.

429
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:38,449
- Do you wanna stay here?
- I...

430
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,427
I just-- I'll--

431
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,396
I won't bring
my work home...

432
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,400
- with me.
- But that is you.

433
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,436
How can you not
bring it home?

434
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,640
What, and then
I don't bring
my work home?

435
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:07,111
And then, what,
we sit here and talk
about what?

436
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,147
Things that
really matter.

437
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:14,351
And what are they?

438
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,119
Your work
really matters to you.

439
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:18,521
That world
really matters to you.

440
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,458
When you say it like that,
it just seems so stupid.

441
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,332
I love it,
I hate it.

442
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:32,268
You know?
I love it,
I hate it.

443
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:34,136
I love it when
I'm doing it.

444
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,406
When I'm not doing it,
I hate it.

445
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:39,208
It drives me crazy.

446
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:43,546
I couldn't do
a 9:00 to 5:00 job.

447
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,548
- It's crazy.
- I'm not asking you to do
a 9:00 to 5:00 job.

448
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:47,649
I'm not asking
that of you.

449
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:50,286
I'm saying that you should
do what you want to do

450
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,789
and I'm not here
to lay in judgment of that.

451
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,461
Maybe you don't want
to hear it anymore

452
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:02,398
because you left it.

453
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:04,700
Yeah, but we used to have
a common denominator, right?

454
00:25:04,733 --> 00:25:08,170
- And now we don't.
- Right.

455
00:25:08,204 --> 00:25:09,605
- And I think--
- Well, hang on.

456
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:11,507
Now that was
a common denominator.

457
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,809
It wasn't
the common denominator.

458
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:21,183
Wasn't it?

459
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:24,219
* Let's dance
all night long... *

460
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:27,189
What you have done?

461
00:25:27,223 --> 00:25:29,225
- What you have done?
- ( cheering )

462
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:32,327
Happy birthday,
Daddy.

463
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,794
- That is Peter.
- Hi.

464
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:35,597
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- My daddy, Lorenzo.

465
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:37,466
- These are cigars for you.
- Thank you very much.

466
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:38,600
- Very kind.
- Lorenzo.

467
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:40,436
Regina.

468
00:25:40,469 --> 00:25:42,470
- I thought you were in Rome.
- ( speaks Italian )

469
00:25:42,503 --> 00:25:44,805
Look at that.
How beautiful.

470
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,642
( speaking Italian )

471
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:53,614
- Happy birthday.
- This is the best boy.

472
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:55,383
- You are best boy.
- Surprise, darling.

473
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:58,219
( speaking Italian )

474
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,487
Where is Mario?
Mario here?

475
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,656
- He'll be here.
- Here?

476
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:06,527
Oh, my God,
cómo estás?

477
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,763
- Divine. Not a year older.
- What a beautiful thing
to see all of you here.

478
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:11,766
What a surprise.

479
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,502
No picture.
I don't want
my picture taken.

480
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:17,704
Oh, right.
Don't like pictures?
Since when?

481
00:26:17,737 --> 00:26:20,375
- Merci. Go on.
- Yeah, because
you will not change.

482
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:22,677
( chatter )

483
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,745
My dad-- trust me,
my dad is cool.

484
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:28,248
- You sure?
- T: All black niggas
in the house.

485
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:32,386
- Mario: Dad!
- T: Black time!

486
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:35,855
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.

487
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,624
- My name is T. I'll be
your host for the evening.
- Mario.

488
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:39,793
Yeah.

489
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:41,495
- My father Lorenzo Mancini.
- How you doing, Mr. Mancini.

490
00:26:41,528 --> 00:26:43,563
- Mr. Mancini, Mean Mitch.
- Ah, Mr. Mean.

491
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:45,698
- J.B., where is he?
- For the black brothers.

492
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,666
The man.
This is the man, Dad.

493
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,572
- J.B., meet my father
Lorenzo Mancini.
- Hey, man.

494
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:54,707
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Mancini.

495
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,810
Simone, was
that LL Cool J

496
00:26:56,843 --> 00:26:58,845
that walked in
with the hat?

497
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:00,880
- No. LL Cool J.
- Not him?

498
00:27:00,914 --> 00:27:02,848
- That's J.B.
That's my boyfriend.
- Ah, J.B.

499
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:04,317
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

500
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,386
- How very nice.
- Dad.

501
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,524
- Dad, what do you
think of this?
- See, but, Mario--

502
00:27:10,557 --> 00:27:13,492
- What we can do with this--
- We talk in the office.

503
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,661
- This is what
I was talking about.
- We talk in the office.

504
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,299
My name is T.
How you doing, man?

505
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,801
- Mr. T.
- This is my nephew.

506
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,803
- That's my uncle right here.
- He's a funny guy.

507
00:27:24,837 --> 00:27:26,739
- Here's a great guy.
- Come, come, come.

508
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:29,474
Can y'all tell me
where the bar is?
'Cause I need a drink.

509
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:32,877
Don't play.
Don't pout.

510
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,781
Don't pretend
there's nothing wrong
because is much wrong.

511
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:37,616
Because you have
no focus.

512
00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:39,851
You just do anything
come into your head.

513
00:27:39,884 --> 00:27:42,888
What did-- focus?!

514
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,625
I just brought
these people here

515
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:49,462
in a concentrated interest
to bring you and them together

516
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:52,631
and myself,
so that I could do something.
You say I don't have focus?

517
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:55,568
That's exactly why I brought
them because I do have focus
for the first time.

518
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:57,502
That's why
I brought them here.

519
00:27:57,535 --> 00:27:58,803
So that we can
do something.

520
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:01,339
So that I can help you
and help myself,

521
00:28:01,373 --> 00:28:02,740
but you don't want
to let me do that.

522
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:04,742
You just want to run it
the way that you want
to do it.

523
00:28:04,776 --> 00:28:06,444
It's always
the same thing.

524
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,380
Sending me off,
sending me away.

525
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,814
( laughs )
My son, my son.

526
00:28:09,847 --> 00:28:11,916
No, no, no.
It doesn't work that way.

527
00:28:11,949 --> 00:28:13,950
I'm trying to do
something now...

528
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:17,554
to establish myself.

529
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:20,792
But you don't wanna
let me do that.

530
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,729
Easy, tiger.
Easy, tiger.

531
00:28:25,762 --> 00:28:28,433
- We can talk here.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.

532
00:28:28,466 --> 00:28:31,668
Well, it's a party.
You're supposed to be
having a good time.

533
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:34,906
- Exactly.
Exactly the point.
- Well, listen.

534
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:37,875
It is a surprise party
and you missed the surprise,

535
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:39,777
- so I think he has every--
- I didn't mean to miss
the surprise.

536
00:28:39,811 --> 00:28:42,913
Well, you did, okay.
Let's cop to that.

537
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:45,916
You think it would have been
any different if I had gotten
here for the surprise?

538
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:48,552
- Do you honestly
think so, Guido?
- Yes.

539
00:28:48,585 --> 00:28:50,621
Simple enough.
Yes.

540
00:28:50,654 --> 00:28:52,723
I don't think so.
I don't think so.

541
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:54,991
Just get over it.
You'll be all right.

542
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:59,395
- Place looks good,
doesn't it?
- Looks fine.

543
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,664
Oh, come on.

544
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:05,869
Meanwhile, are these
new friends of yours?

545
00:29:05,902 --> 00:29:09,505
They're not armed,
are they?

546
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,608
- I'm just asking.
- Don't you start on me now.

547
00:29:11,642 --> 00:29:13,744
- Guido: God, your hair is so--
I want this hair.
- Irene: Like it?

548
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:16,412
Look at Gabriella.
Do you believe that?

549
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:20,651
- She's taller than I am.
- Do you know what she's
gonna do there?

550
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:23,520
Not much with
that lunkhead,
I hope.

551
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:25,688
Excuse me. Sorry.

552
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,025
- You're funny.
- You look delightful.

553
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,528
- And beautiful.
- Oh.

554
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,831
- And how is our husband doing?
- And so do you as always.

555
00:29:38,634 --> 00:29:41,704
I think you should
spend some time with him.

556
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,838
- No, no, no.
- It's up to you.

557
00:29:43,872 --> 00:29:45,974
No, no, no.
Guido finds out,
he'd kill me.

558
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:48,711
- So did it change--
- Cut my head off not to say
something else.

559
00:29:48,744 --> 00:29:51,681
- Your head?
- You cannot do that,
my darling.

560
00:29:51,714 --> 00:29:54,516
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Looks so beautiful here.

561
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:56,519
- It's very beautiful.
- I miss you, you know?

562
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:58,454
I miss, too.

563
00:29:58,488 --> 00:30:00,856
- It's nice to return.
- Yeah.

564
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:03,993
The old days.
Life is short
till the longest.

565
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:05,928
It make you
think about, no?

566
00:30:05,961 --> 00:30:07,997
- You don't think about?
- I think a lot about.

567
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,999
- I think about.
- Yeah.

568
00:30:11,032 --> 00:30:14,603
- You look so worried.
What is that?
- I worry?

569
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:17,706
- I worry about
the children.
- Why?

570
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:20,809
Because they...

571
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:23,011
You know Gabriella,
she's Gabriella,

572
00:30:23,044 --> 00:30:25,847
- she does what the fuck
she wants to do.
- Same Gabriella.

573
00:30:28,516 --> 00:30:32,019
Mario. He keeps trying
to prove something to me.

574
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:35,056
I don't care
what he do.

575
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:37,825
I care he find
a place to sit down

576
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:40,761
and to sit there
and look ahead and focus.

577
00:30:42,564 --> 00:30:44,633
And I worry about...

578
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:47,669
You are such
a good mother,
aren't you?

579
00:30:47,702 --> 00:30:51,640
- I am the best of the mother.
- Always worried about
the babies.

580
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:53,908
Your little babies.

581
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:55,909
You're so good.

582
00:30:55,943 --> 00:30:58,779
Thank you for being
so good to the babies.

583
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,881
You're good.
You're a good heart.

584
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:03,051
I love you.

585
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:05,118
Oh, how are you
doing to me?

586
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:10,123
- ( sighs )
- What is that?

587
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,596
Is there something
wrong there?

588
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,702
Eh...

589
00:31:24,737 --> 00:31:26,740
I am sick.

590
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,744
- You're sick?
- Very sick.

591
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:34,548
Okay. We go to
the doctor and...

592
00:31:34,582 --> 00:31:36,784
Is no doctor.

593
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:39,086
I have been to Harold.
He's the best in the world.

594
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,088
- You have AIDS, honey?
- No, no, no.

595
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:44,857
- What is that?
- I have the cancer.

596
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:50,096
I have cancer.

597
00:31:50,129 --> 00:31:52,098
- Hi, Kelley.
- Hi, how are you?

598
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:53,966
Fine, honey.
Are you coming to
the show next week?

599
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,635
- Yes, absolutely.
- Good.

600
00:31:55,668 --> 00:31:57,069
This place is full
of fucking sharks today.

601
00:31:57,103 --> 00:31:59,037
- No, it's gonna be fine.
- Safer to do it.

602
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,106
You know what?
It'll be fine.

603
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:03,576
- ( sighs )
- He's gonna be here
any minute.

604
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,579
- Just cool your jets.
- Penny?

605
00:32:06,613 --> 00:32:08,113
- Darling.
- Roberta: Hi, Janice.

606
00:32:08,146 --> 00:32:10,950
- Hey, how are you, baby?
- How are ya?

607
00:32:10,983 --> 00:32:13,052
- Good to see you.
- You and your beautiful team.

608
00:32:13,085 --> 00:32:15,722
Hey, everybody.
How you doing,
Simon? Sarah?

609
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:17,890
You look gorgeous.
Let me just take a look
at this jacket.

610
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:20,893
- Thank you.
- Girls, look at this jacket.

611
00:32:20,927 --> 00:32:22,862
- Oh, that's gorgeous.
- Is this not beautiful?

612
00:32:22,895 --> 00:32:25,196
- Look at that.
- Palmer Jones.
They made it for me.

613
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,733
- It's stunning. I love it.
- Leave it to you to be
right on top.

614
00:32:27,766 --> 00:32:29,200
Hey, listen.
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

615
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,836
- Sure.
- Come on.

616
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:33,773
Okay.

617
00:32:33,806 --> 00:32:36,141
- Simon: How you been, Darce?
- Very well, thank you.

618
00:32:36,174 --> 00:32:38,744
Okay.
What am I doing?

619
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,846
You've cancelled lunch
on me three times.

620
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,881
You haven't rescheduled.
What is going on?

621
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:44,915
I'm sorry.
I don't know if
I've done anything.

622
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:47,919
- You haven't done anything.
- Okay. All right. Really?

623
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:50,656
Really. You've just been
totally lovely.

624
00:32:50,689 --> 00:32:54,124
You would not
believe the week.
This is unreal.

625
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:57,629
People are acting weird.
I don't know what--
is it a full moon?

626
00:32:57,663 --> 00:32:59,665
What is it?

627
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,869
- Do you want me to tell you?
- What? Yeah.

628
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:05,737
Is there something
I don't know?

629
00:33:05,771 --> 00:33:08,139
I don't want you
to flip out, okay?

630
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:10,641
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

631
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:13,644
That is so sweet of you.
It's about you.

632
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:15,980
Am I okay?

633
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:18,650
I want you to be okay.

634
00:33:18,684 --> 00:33:21,686
- What?
- Camille is seeing
Jamie from Fantasia.

635
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,991
- Oh, I knew that.
- You knew that?

636
00:33:27,024 --> 00:33:28,892
- Oh, completely.
- You knew that?

637
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,894
- Oh, yeah.
I knew that.
- You knew that?

638
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:33,063
- Oh, sure.
- Oh, my God.

639
00:33:33,097 --> 00:33:35,800
- I thought it was part
of the full moon thing.
- I thought this was gonna be--

640
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:37,867
- Are you kidding?
- No.

641
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:40,103
Oh, this is fantastic.
I feel so much better.

642
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,943
You knew.
You all knew.

643
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:47,177
- We weren't positive.
- We didn't know.

644
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:49,013
Yes, you did.
You knew.

645
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:51,048
Damn it.

646
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:57,053
- Shit!
- It's done.

647
00:33:57,086 --> 00:34:00,725
- Roberta: Let me just
try something here.
- Woman: Are you okay there?

648
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:03,927
Shit.

649
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:09,232
- This dress is
hopeless, Roberta.
- No, no. It's fine.

650
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:12,235
Maybe we should
just do it asymmetrical.

651
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:14,970
Maybe we should just
do it like it's supposed
to be uneven.

652
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:17,006
Yeah. I think
that's a great look.

653
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,108
- Look at that.
- That's not bad.

654
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:22,177
- Let's make sure
I'm covered, though.
- Yeah. Okay.

655
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,847
Somebody have a cigarette?

656
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,216
Did you like the flowers,
by the way?

657
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,185
- Flowers were lovely.
- Oh, thank God.

658
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:31,855
Hi. Hi, Roberta.

659
00:34:31,888 --> 00:34:33,923
- Roberta: Let me have the tape
for a second. Hey.
- Hey there.

660
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:37,326
- I need to talk with you.
- Okay.

661
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,095
We need to discuss
what we didn't get to
talk about last night.

662
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:42,297
God, this is snagged now.

663
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,833
- What?
- I've gotta get Alfred
to run that through again.

664
00:34:44,867 --> 00:34:46,903
- Oh, my God.
- Don't worry,
don't worry. It's okay.

665
00:34:46,936 --> 00:34:49,071
But why would she
be coming back now?

666
00:34:49,104 --> 00:34:51,339
Are we trying to put it
as if she's booted
Camille out

667
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:54,777
or that Camille's left
and it's a mutually--

668
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:59,246
I just don't have
an answer for you
on that.

669
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,017
Just put,
"The unexpected
absence of Camille

670
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,753
due to personal problems
has left..."

671
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:06,354
I don't think
we can put that

672
00:35:06,388 --> 00:35:08,255
because we don't
know that she has
personal problems.

673
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:10,091
Well, then,
what are you gonna put?

674
00:35:10,124 --> 00:35:11,827
How are you gonna explain
that she's not there?

675
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,862
- Don't--
- Would you write it down?

676
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:18,767
- Fantasia?
- Yeah.

677
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:20,302
- ( car horn honks )
- Fantasia?!

678
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:23,305
- The Fantasia?
- The. Yeah.

679
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:26,841
- What do you mean, "Yeah"?
That's excellent.
- I know.

680
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,779
- It's just so corporate and--
- Oh, please.

681
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:33,781
- Don't even give me that.
- What do you mean?

682
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:35,950
Don't you think
that's where we
wanna be?

683
00:35:35,983 --> 00:35:38,920
- No, what does that
have to do with--
- The largest, most powerful

684
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:41,022
design firm
in the whole
country?

685
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,389
I mean, come on.
That's what you do.
You're a designer.

686
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:47,294
- Be happy about it.
- I'm happy.

687
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,363
I just don't see
what all of that
has to do with

688
00:35:49,396 --> 00:35:51,932
drawing
and making--

689
00:35:51,965 --> 00:35:53,900
I mean...
( stammering )

690
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,937
I'm scared.

691
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,339
It's big.
It's a big thing
and I don't--

692
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,808
there's
a lot of pressure
and I don't--

693
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:03,945
- you know, I--
- Camille, come here.

694
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:06,180
- I know. It's huge.
- Yeah, it's huge.

695
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:08,883
- It's real huge.
- Yeah.

696
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,417
But you should
really embrace it.

697
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:14,087
I've decided that

698
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,858
I'm gonna take a job
back in London.

699
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:23,363
Wow.

700
00:36:23,396 --> 00:36:26,399
It shouldn't be that much
of a surprise, really.

701
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:28,400
No, I mean--
look, look.

702
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:31,938
I-- I understand.

703
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:37,042
It's obviously not about you.
You know, it's obviously--

704
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:39,178
It's been a rough week.

705
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:42,148
But, you know, it's not
always like this.

706
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,386
Right through there.

707
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,989
I'm just really
in a rush,
you know?

708
00:36:49,022 --> 00:36:50,891
I haven't got
time for this.

709
00:36:50,924 --> 00:36:52,893
I understand you guys
are having problems,

710
00:36:52,926 --> 00:36:55,394
- but this is my time.
- It's so hard at this time.

711
00:36:55,427 --> 00:36:58,864
- It gets so hectic.
- Right, I know, but--

712
00:36:58,898 --> 00:37:01,134
At the end of the day,

713
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,335
we're all doing what
we need to do out
of all this.

714
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:05,270
For ourselves.

715
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:08,874
Let's face it,
we're all covering
our own backs.

716
00:37:08,908 --> 00:37:10,910
I mean,
fuck, Camille is.

717
00:37:14,914 --> 00:37:18,050
...mood is
at the time,
you know?

718
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:20,485
Uh-huh.
I like how you--

719
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,022
I'm getting a sense
of how you move around
in the world.

720
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:27,426
It looks like this,
but it's kind of--

721
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:30,996
- it's directed from you--
- Why are you always observing
everything I do?

722
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,900
- What am I doing now?
- You're on my height.

723
00:37:34,934 --> 00:37:38,003
- And you're looking
twinkly-eyed in my eyes.
- ( moans )

724
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:40,338
And you're gurgling
and gurgling.

725
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:43,374
Did you ever see that movie
"Like Water for Chocolate"?

726
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:46,378
No, I didn't.
Oh, wait a minute.

727
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,312
Yes, I did see that.

728
00:37:48,346 --> 00:37:50,915
I like those Marquez novels
that are like that.

729
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,285
- Why bring that up?
Why do you ask?
- Do you know how,

730
00:37:54,318 --> 00:37:57,320
when she would cook food
and she was sad

731
00:37:57,354 --> 00:37:59,523
and people who ate
the food after
she cooked it

732
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:02,927
when she was sad,
they felt very sad?

733
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:05,496
And then when
she cooked with
love, then they--

734
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:08,531
- Yes, yes?
- they all fell in love
with each other.

735
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:13,104
- Yes.
- Well, that's kind of
how I feel about--

736
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:16,007
you know,
when I do my drawings.

737
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,142
It's whatever's
inspiring me.

738
00:38:18,176 --> 00:38:20,979
- Like you're inspiring me.
- I am?

739
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,147
- Yes.
- You're inspiring me, too.

740
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,949
I love what
you just said, though.
That's very interesting.

741
00:38:25,983 --> 00:38:30,288
How I'm sure it
translates your vibe--

742
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:33,123
what's going on in you
as you create these things.

743
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:35,558
- Like, what was
this person thinking?
- Of course.

744
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:37,394
Thinking and feeling
and who are they and
what went into it?

745
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:39,562
As you put that on,
you kind of--

746
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:42,364
- I'm not an airy-fairy guy
or hocus-pocus guy,
- You feel it.

747
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,501
but I think
it's surely true.

748
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:47,237
- Right?
- Yes. Yes.

749
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,407
- Camille.
- Hey.

750
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,209
- How you doing?
- Hey, what's up?

751
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,344
- How you been?
- Good. How've you been?

752
00:38:55,377 --> 00:38:58,149
Good. I was worried
about you. I lost you
the other night.

753
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:02,385
- I went for a drink, I turned
around and you were gone.
- I know, I was so tired.

754
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:05,088
- I should have called you.
- I was worried. I called you--
what, three times?

755
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:07,024
- I left messages
on your machine.
- I know.

756
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:09,125
I've been so swamped.
Your mom called me.
What'd she want?

757
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:11,227
I talked to her
and I told her that
I was looking for you.

758
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,330
- I lost you at a party--
- You called your mom
and told her?

759
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:15,265
I talk to my mom all the time.
You know my mom. My gosh.

760
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:17,534
You could've come over
and see I'm okay.

761
00:39:17,567 --> 00:39:19,401
- I'm fine.
Where are you going?
- Maybe I should.

762
00:39:19,435 --> 00:39:21,337
- I was just gonna do
some shopping.
- Yeah?

763
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,005
You're freezing.
Why don't you have
a jacket on?

764
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,406
- I'm fine.
- You're all right?

765
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,542
- Yeah, it's warm.
- Good, good.

766
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,378
This is Jamie.
This is Paul.

767
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,613
- Jamie, how you doing?
- Hello, Paul.

768
00:39:31,647 --> 00:39:34,283
- Good, good.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

769
00:39:36,517 --> 00:39:39,054
- What's your
last name, Paul?
- McMichaels.

770
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:42,291
Did I interrupt
something?

771
00:39:42,324 --> 00:39:44,061
- No, no.
- No.

772
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:46,462
We were just--
we had to look at
some things in here.

773
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:48,397
But we're gonna go.
I'll call you later.

774
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,566
- Great. Please do.
- Okay.

775
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,501
It's good to see you.

776
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:58,440
Wow. You look like
you're in a walking race.

777
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:01,077
- No.
- Racing away from me.

778
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:04,079
- Sorry to leave you on the
street there. I went into--
- It's okay.

779
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,447
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you doing?

780
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:09,150
Just gonna go home.

781
00:40:09,184 --> 00:40:11,052
- What?
- What?

782
00:40:11,086 --> 00:40:13,188
- What'd you get?
- A present for you,

783
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:15,656
but you're walking
away from me like that
and you're going home?

784
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,059
- You're going home?
- No--

785
00:40:18,093 --> 00:40:20,061
Was that--

786
00:40:20,095 --> 00:40:23,230
Did you want me to accompany
you or was that goodbye?
Was that it?

787
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:25,600
What sort of weird stuff
has happened now?

788
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:28,137
- Nothing.
I just feel a little--
- Well, not nothing.

789
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,605
- Something.
- Okay, that is someone

790
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,373
who knows
Roberta very well

791
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,475
and I feel a little
strange right now

792
00:40:34,509 --> 00:40:38,246
and... that's it.

793
00:40:41,215 --> 00:40:43,618
Well, it feels
awful to me.

794
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:46,454
- I'm sorry.
- What's that mean?

795
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,588
He knows Roberta

796
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:51,091
and so you don't
want Roberta--

797
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,194
oh, I see.
To know that we're
seeing each other,

798
00:40:54,228 --> 00:40:56,530
but-- wow.

799
00:40:56,563 --> 00:40:59,533
- Okay, but it
feels personally--
- What don't you understand--

800
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,701
Well, I sort of
understand that,
but personally--

801
00:41:01,735 --> 00:41:03,670
what don't you understand
about the fact that

802
00:41:03,703 --> 00:41:06,572
that personally
feels awful to me?

803
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:08,441
You're creeping me
out a little bit.

804
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:11,111
You just need to
relax and just--

805
00:41:11,145 --> 00:41:13,148
I'm perfectly
relaxed and I'm sorry
I'm creeping you out.

806
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,349
This is freaking
me out, frankly.

807
00:41:15,382 --> 00:41:18,618
- Are you playing
some kind of game?
- I'm not playing any games.

808
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:20,454
- That was--
- Where sometimes
it's wonderful

809
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:23,390
and sometimes you go,
"Fuck you, I'm going home,

810
00:41:23,423 --> 00:41:26,526
- I'm being lost."
- No, I'm just a little
confused right now, okay?

811
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,130
I don't know what
I'm doing. I'll meet
your boss if you want--

812
00:41:30,164 --> 00:41:31,731
It's not about
meeting my boss,
honey.

813
00:41:31,765 --> 00:41:34,333
It's not just
about meeting
my boss.

814
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,736
I think I get
the picture. I'll--

815
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,506
- Please.
- I'm sure you do.

816
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:47,280
Roberta?

817
00:41:47,313 --> 00:41:49,315
I'm back.

818
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:53,585
Roberta?
Sweetie, sweetie.

819
00:42:08,733 --> 00:42:11,204
- ( groans )
Such a bitch.
- Sweetie.

820
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,273
I tried to get you
on the cell phone
and it didn't work.

821
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:15,741
I know.

822
00:42:15,774 --> 00:42:17,742
There was no reception
where I was.

823
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:20,478
- I'm sorry.
- How was Bali?

824
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,449
Bali was Bali.

825
00:42:24,482 --> 00:42:27,185
- Surf was good.
- Yeah.

826
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:29,287
I saw a big shark.

827
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:31,356
I've seen a lot
of sharks, too.

828
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:36,227
The show's in
a couple of days.
What are you gonna do?

829
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,429
I don't know.

830
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:41,567
When do you wanna do?

831
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,602
I don't know.

832
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,373
- This is just hard.
- I know.

833
00:42:55,813 --> 00:42:57,815
What do you
think's going on?

834
00:42:59,517 --> 00:43:01,519
I think
Camille's bailing.

835
00:43:02,653 --> 00:43:05,322
But why?

836
00:43:05,356 --> 00:43:07,324
I think
she's selling out.

837
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,428
I think she wants to go
make some more money and...

838
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,229
Yeah,
but that's--

839
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:15,799
if she wants to do that,
it's her life.

840
00:43:15,832 --> 00:43:17,768
She's gonna do it.

841
00:43:17,801 --> 00:43:21,371
Yeah, but that's
not the point.

842
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,206
- I know.
- It's the way
she's doing it.

843
00:43:27,279 --> 00:43:30,447
Maybe this is
an opportunity.

844
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:32,616
I mean, if you look
at it in a different way.

845
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:36,720
Okay, so Camille--
who needs her?

846
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:39,489
- ( laughs ) Me.
- No, I'm serious.

847
00:43:39,522 --> 00:43:41,692
When you started out,

848
00:43:41,725 --> 00:43:45,329
you were as good
as Camille.

849
00:43:45,362 --> 00:43:47,697
Come on. You were.
You know it.

850
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,433
You know it.

851
00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:53,569
- You thought so anyway.
- I know so.

852
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,773
You know?
And so do you.

853
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:00,843
Really, the bottom line is,
sweetie, so do you.

854
00:44:00,876 --> 00:44:04,547
And maybe it's time
for you to get back
into the driver's seat now.

855
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,515
( elevator dings )

856
00:44:06,548 --> 00:44:08,550
- ( phone ringing )
- ( chatter )

857
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,691
Woman:
They looked really uptight
to me. I don't know.

858
00:44:15,725 --> 00:44:18,628
Seems like
it's supposed to
make you really relax.

859
00:44:18,661 --> 00:44:20,630
( continues conversing
faintly )

860
00:44:20,663 --> 00:44:23,298
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, I'll be right with you.

861
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:25,535
She said it seems like
the most stressful thing
you could do.

862
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:30,806
( footsteps )

863
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,676
- Anthony?
- Yeah.

864
00:44:34,709 --> 00:44:36,511
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

865
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:38,380
I'm Wilemina.
It's okay. Have a seat.

866
00:44:38,413 --> 00:44:41,350
Janice is still
in a meeting right now.

867
00:44:41,383 --> 00:44:43,685
- Okay.
- She'll be with you
in a little bit.

868
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:46,455
- Okay.
- Um...

869
00:44:46,488 --> 00:44:48,890
I've watched your work
for a while.

870
00:44:48,923 --> 00:44:52,326
- You have?
- Yeah. I'm really, really
into the heroin chic thing.

871
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,362
You are
a heroin chic god.

872
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:56,832
- God.
- I totally follow
your stuff.

873
00:44:56,866 --> 00:45:00,602
It's like
an albatross
around my neck.

874
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:03,638
- Really?
- Yeah, because it's just
been copied so many times.

875
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:05,740
Yeah, but you
were the original.
Everyone knows that.

876
00:45:05,774 --> 00:45:08,476
- I was.
- Everyone knows that.
Trust me.

877
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:10,779
- Yeah, I really admire
your work.
- Thank you.

878
00:45:10,812 --> 00:45:12,747
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

879
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:15,417
I hope your meeting
with Janice goes well.

880
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:19,553
- I could get thinner models.
- ( laughing )

881
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,426
It's cute that you're
trying to make a joke.

882
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:30,764
You gotta
reinvent yourself.

883
00:45:30,798 --> 00:45:32,800
You've become a little
bit of a Xerox copy

884
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,402
and every time
it's been copied,

885
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:36,403
it's just gotten
a little duller.

886
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:38,638
I don't think
that's fair.

887
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:41,810
I'm not copying myself.

888
00:45:41,843 --> 00:45:43,712
Are we arguing?

889
00:45:43,745 --> 00:45:46,914
I'm speaking
for myself, yes.

890
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:49,617
Is argumentation
gonna get you success,

891
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,985
uniqueness, rebirth,
and freshness?

892
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,825
- I think expressing myself--
- Yakity, yakity, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

893
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:03,863
That's right.
Reflect.

894
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:13,506
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, hi.

895
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,843
Hi. Can you tell me
where Janice Crawford's
office is, please?

896
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:20,646
Mm-hmm. Janice Crawford's
office is here.
Can I help you?

897
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:23,616
Could you show me
where it is?

898
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,453
Do you have
an appointment?

899
00:46:25,486 --> 00:46:28,489
No. Can you tell her
that Halley's here?

900
00:46:28,522 --> 00:46:30,790
Okay, Halley, but she's in
an appointment right now

901
00:46:30,823 --> 00:46:32,859
and she doesn't
want to be disturbed.

902
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:35,428
I can call and see
if she's available.

903
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:38,698
Can I tell her
what this is regarding?

904
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:40,833
Would you just tell her
that it's her daughter?

905
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:43,436
Um... her--
her daughter?

906
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,472
- Halley.
- Okay. Sure.

907
00:46:45,505 --> 00:46:47,439
Have a seat.
I'll see what
I can do for you.

908
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:48,607
- Okay, Halley?
- Okay.

909
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,043
Yeah, hi.
Wilemina?

910
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:53,980
There's a girl here.
Her name's Halley.

911
00:46:54,013 --> 00:46:55,882
She says she's
Janice's daughter.

912
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:58,016
Can you come
check it out for me?

913
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,819
All right. Okay.
See you in a second.
Bye-bye.

914
00:47:02,888 --> 00:47:04,856
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

915
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:12,064
- Janice's daughter?
- Yeah.

916
00:47:12,098 --> 00:47:14,866
- Her name's Halley.
- Okay.

917
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,903
- Hi. I'm Wilemina.
- Hi.

918
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:20,071
- Halley.
- I'm Janice's assistant.

919
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:22,840
- Nice to meet you.
- Uh... your mom's...

920
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:24,009
- Yeah.
- ...assistant.

921
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,845
- Right?
- Yeah.

922
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,881
Do--

923
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:32,483
- You wanna see her? What is--
- Is she here?

924
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,620
She's here.
She's in a meeting, though.

925
00:47:35,653 --> 00:47:38,757
I don't think now is a good
time to disturb her.

926
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:43,861
- Can you hold all my calls?
- Sure.

927
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:46,631
- We have an incident here.
- An incident?

928
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:49,033
- I'm just gonna...
- Yeah. This girl says
she's Janice's daughter.

929
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:50,834
- Her name's Halley.
- Honey?

930
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:54,705
- What?
- Are you aware that
Janice has a daughter?

931
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,608
No, Janice doesn't
have a daughter.

932
00:47:56,642 --> 00:47:59,810
This young lady
behind us claims
to be her daughter.

933
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:03,514
This a joke?

934
00:48:03,548 --> 00:48:06,751
I-- I'm so happy.

935
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,753
I'm so excited.
Really.

936
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,955
You keep it simple.
You keep it clean.
You keep it now.

937
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,057
- You keep it hip and edgy.
- Janice.

938
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,025
- I gotta say this is
gonna work out really well.
- I like it.

939
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,093
Simple, now.
I think it's great.

940
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:20,029
Anthony: Something hip.
Something edgy. I think
it's fantastic.

941
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,931
- Yeah, I can do it.
- You've worked with
celebrities before?

942
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,001
- Yes, I have.
- I know you have.

943
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,902
- No problem.
- You're gonna be brilliant.
I love you.

944
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:27,704
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're so gorgeous.

945
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:29,606
- Here's what I say.
- Janice?

946
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:31,074
- I'll take you
to the elevator.
- Janice?

947
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:33,977
Janice:
This way.
That's right, angel.

948
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,845
- ( elevator door dings )
- Janice: Oh, my God.

949
00:48:36,879 --> 00:48:39,549
That situation
with Anthony is so--

950
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,586
- Janice. Janice.
- you've got to promise me
one thing.

951
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,588
Promise me one thing--
promise me, you both,

952
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,722
that we will
not let this guy
do any heroin chic.

953
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:47,957
- You promise?
- Janice, there's somebody
here to see you.

954
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,894
- There's always
someone here to see me.
- This is someone special.

955
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:53,597
I think someone special
is here to see you.

956
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:55,632
- Why don't you turn around?
- ( music playing )

957
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:01,070
- Hi.
- Who's this?

958
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,172
I don't have
a meeting with her.

959
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:06,208
- Um... she's--
- Halley.

960
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,128
Are you okay?

961
00:49:29,632 --> 00:49:31,634
Okay. Um...

962
00:49:33,201 --> 00:49:35,638
Why don't we give them
a little privacy?

963
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:38,874
If you need anything,
you call me.

964
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:43,612
Water. Would you
like some water?

965
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:45,648
Janice? Halley?

966
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:49,884
Lunch with Gary Packer
is right now.

967
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:52,655
Just keep
that in mind.

968
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:04,098
Hi... Mom.

969
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,022
- You're busy.
- No.

970
00:50:29,223 --> 00:50:31,925
No. No.

971
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:34,127
No.

972
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,699
Um, can you meet
her downtown?

973
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:40,834
Between some meetings
she has down there?

974
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:42,903
- Sure. Yeah.
- You can do that?

975
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:45,839
Okay, then what I'm gonna
say is that you're gonna
meet her downtown.

976
00:50:45,872 --> 00:50:48,241
This is in Chelsea.

977
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:50,075
- Okay?
- Okay. Can I--

978
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:52,212
You know where
that is, right?

979
00:50:52,245 --> 00:50:54,815
If you just
give me the address,
I can find it.

980
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:57,251
Okay, I will
give you an address.

981
00:50:57,284 --> 00:50:59,986
I'll write it
down for you.

982
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,122
Hold on a second.

983
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:04,958
You can go meet her
down there and she can--

984
00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:06,994
I don't know--
have coffee with you.

985
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:09,029
How long do you
think she'll have?

986
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:11,898
That really depends on her.

987
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:14,100
She's got these meetings

988
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:16,802
and if she stalls them,
she stalls them.

989
00:51:18,237 --> 00:51:20,105
I can't really
tell you, though.

990
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:21,942
What's she like?

991
00:51:21,975 --> 00:51:23,977
Your mom?

992
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:29,782
I love your mom.

993
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:32,852
I really--
I wanna be your mom.

994
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:35,119
I think
she's a great lady.

995
00:51:35,153 --> 00:51:37,156
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

996
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:39,792
- 12 years.
- 12 years?

997
00:51:39,825 --> 00:51:42,128
- How old are you?
- 19.

998
00:51:42,162 --> 00:51:44,730
Do you mind if I ask--

999
00:51:44,764 --> 00:51:48,300
it's none of my business,
but what happened?

1000
00:51:51,204 --> 00:51:53,272
Darcy:
I have to say in 12 years

1001
00:51:53,305 --> 00:51:55,007
I have done a lot
of interviews

1002
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,142
and I have never come here
in my own city.

1003
00:51:57,176 --> 00:51:59,745
It's so beautiful.
I thought, why does she
want to go down there?

1004
00:51:59,779 --> 00:52:01,345
- It's such
a great idea. Thank you.
- No, it's nice.

1005
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:03,347
Because otherwise
you're gonna sit
in a cafe

1006
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:05,885
and I was gonna spill
mustard on my shirt
and you're gonna write...

1007
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:09,088
- I won't write that.
I'm glad you brought that up.
- ...is such a slob.

1008
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:11,355
I'm glad you brought
that up because I want
you to know

1009
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:14,125
Janice and I have such
different styles and I hope
she didn't scare you off,

1010
00:52:14,158 --> 00:52:16,928
- but we were so excited--
- No, sweetie. She didn't
scare me off.

1011
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:19,296
I know.
I saw that.
I saw that.

1012
00:52:19,329 --> 00:52:21,866
- But she's really great.
We're so thrilled to have you.
- No, she's fine.

1013
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,202
- She's fine.
- And you're so normal.

1014
00:52:24,235 --> 00:52:26,872
I was expecting something
so different out of you.

1015
00:52:26,906 --> 00:52:29,307
I've been such a fan,
but you're so accessible

1016
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,175
and easy
and down to earth.

1017
00:52:31,209 --> 00:52:33,978
This business
is so about--

1018
00:52:34,012 --> 00:52:36,949
you do one role
that you do well

1019
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:39,117
- or you get known
for and that's all
- Very well.

1020
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:41,986
- anybody ever
wants you to do.
- Mm-hmm.

1021
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,789
- It's easy to cry.
Well, it's not easy.
- Do you think--

1022
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:47,057
Do you think that
a lot of your comedy--

1023
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,392
because you're
so well-adjusted

1024
00:52:49,426 --> 00:52:51,863
and you're so present
and down to earth.

1025
00:52:51,896 --> 00:52:54,132
- Do you think--
- You don't know me well,
do you?

1026
00:52:54,165 --> 00:52:57,000
- I'm trying to get to know you.
- Well-adjusted I am not,
but that's okay.

1027
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:59,803
Do you think a lot
of it is because of
what you've had to endure

1028
00:52:59,837 --> 00:53:02,205
in your personal life
and dealing with trauma

1029
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,240
and stress

1030
00:53:04,273 --> 00:53:07,911
and sort of births
this comedian in you?

1031
00:53:07,945 --> 00:53:10,181
Is it new?
Have you always
been like that?

1032
00:53:10,214 --> 00:53:12,350
- The comedian in me?
- Yeah.

1033
00:53:12,383 --> 00:53:14,217
Sweetie,
I've always been--

1034
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:16,086
no, to be honest,
like everybody else

1035
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:18,321
I watched "I Love Lucy."
I'm like a freak.

1036
00:53:18,355 --> 00:53:20,825
I just wanted
to be, like,

1037
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:24,294
redhead crazy woman.

1038
00:53:24,327 --> 00:53:27,364
- Right.
- Instead I'm a blond,
crying, serious,

1039
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:30,400
- heavy actress.
- Bombshell, genius,

1040
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:33,903
- Academy Award-nominated
actress. Please.
- Well, thank you.

1041
00:53:33,936 --> 00:53:36,073
I'm staring at you.

1042
00:53:36,106 --> 00:53:38,208
Besides looking at those
gorgeous yellow diamonds,
you must be freezing.

1043
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:40,076
Hold this.
I have to tell
you one thing.

1044
00:53:40,109 --> 00:53:41,944
I can't help myself.

1045
00:53:41,978 --> 00:53:43,379
- Pashminas are so out.
- I'm freezing.

1046
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:45,948
- Oh, they're so out?
- They're so out.

1047
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:48,150
- I'm out?
- I know that you're not out,
but I wanted to say

1048
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:50,352
if you're gonna do
a pashmina, use it as
a scarf, not like a throw.

1049
00:53:50,386 --> 00:53:52,855
Do you know what I mean?
You can use it, you can
cut them up

1050
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:56,193
and make them into pillows
or scarfs or whatever,
but they're out.

1051
00:53:56,226 --> 00:53:58,427
- They're out?
- They're a little bit out.

1052
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:00,462
I was really happy
when pashminas came in

1053
00:54:00,496 --> 00:54:04,000
because I thought there was
a chance for me to be very cool
and very warm.

1054
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,403
I know. It's not like Europe,
though. They're sort of
a timeless piece.

1055
00:54:06,436 --> 00:54:08,304
Here, it's like
they come and go.
You know New York.

1056
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:10,306
It's like fashion trends--
in or out-- snakeskin.

1057
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:12,909
I'm so done with snakeskin.
It's all about plaids.

1058
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:14,877
- It's all about
plaids for fall.
- What is this?

1059
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:17,112
- Is this real leather?
- This is real leather.

1060
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:21,283
Surprised
you showed up.

1061
00:54:23,285 --> 00:54:25,020
Well, I don't know why
you'd be surprised.

1062
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,055
Of course
I would come.

1063
00:54:29,157 --> 00:54:31,159
It's-- you're busy.

1064
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,066
You're my daughter.

1065
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:42,204
Yeah.

1066
00:54:45,941 --> 00:54:48,476
- I can't let go
of your chin.
- I know.

1067
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:56,451
I have an idea.

1068
00:54:56,484 --> 00:55:00,121
Why don't you
come to work at "A"?

1069
00:55:00,155 --> 00:55:02,289
We'll get rid of that
Raggedy Ann look.

1070
00:55:02,322 --> 00:55:05,493
We'll fix your hair.
We'll get you a makeover
at Elizabeth Arden.

1071
00:55:05,526 --> 00:55:08,163
Get you new clothes.
Take you over to Ralph.

1072
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:10,130
Anything you want.
You can work with me.

1073
00:55:10,164 --> 00:55:12,166
Mom, I hate magazines.

1074
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:17,071
What did you just say?

1075
00:55:20,174 --> 00:55:22,342
I mean,
I just hate that--

1076
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:25,146
that they
make you feel bad
when you read them.

1077
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,048
You know?

1078
00:55:28,082 --> 00:55:30,284
You just said
you hate that--

1079
00:55:30,317 --> 00:55:32,286
first you said they--

1080
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:34,289
No, I didn't--

1081
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:36,957
not your--

1082
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:38,959
not your magazine.

1083
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:41,228
Just when you read
a magazine, you--

1084
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:46,132
I-- I just always
feel bad

1085
00:55:46,165 --> 00:55:48,368
about myself.

1086
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:51,138
Like, you know...

1087
00:55:51,171 --> 00:55:53,440
just not good enough
for print.

1088
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:58,477
You don't have to feel
that way about yourself.

1089
00:56:00,379 --> 00:56:03,083
We can change you.

1090
00:56:03,117 --> 00:56:04,517
But I don't
wanna change.

1091
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:08,287
I don't wanna feel
bad about myself.

1092
00:56:10,557 --> 00:56:13,159
I like-- I like

1093
00:56:13,192 --> 00:56:15,294
myself most of the time.

1094
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:20,500
It's just the ideals
of beauty in society.

1095
00:56:20,534 --> 00:56:23,269
- Oh, my goodness.
- When you measure
yourself up to that, you--

1096
00:56:23,302 --> 00:56:25,171
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I'm sorry.

1097
00:56:25,204 --> 00:56:27,206
I just remembered.

1098
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,175
Oh, goodness.

1099
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,376
To be here today,
I had to cancel
an appointment,

1100
00:56:31,409 --> 00:56:33,012
but in exchange
for that,

1101
00:56:33,046 --> 00:56:35,281
I have to do
a conference call.

1102
00:56:35,314 --> 00:56:37,616
Paris to New York
and Milan.

1103
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:41,019
Sweetie, call me up
and Wilemina will schedule
you for another time.

1104
00:56:41,053 --> 00:56:43,088
Just enjoy this.
Stay relaxed.

1105
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:45,557
This is my favorite place.
Liz took me here the day
I got an Elly.

1106
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,425
I will be
in touch with you

1107
00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:50,428
and we'll have
another time together.

1108
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:52,330
All right, baby?

1109
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:01,406
You know,
I have to go, too.

1110
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:07,545
I've got a friend
here in town.

1111
00:57:09,214 --> 00:57:11,483
- Promised I'd visit.
- Can you--

1112
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:19,157
You're okay.
I'll pay the bill, okay?

1113
00:57:19,191 --> 00:57:20,592
So you know,
I'm so excited
that you're doing this.

1114
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:23,061
I don't want you to feel
like your hands are tied,

1115
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:26,197
- but we really
have a strict concept
- Anthony: Yes.

1116
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,065
that we're going
for in the magazine...

1117
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:31,302
on this one--
really wants to stay
very close to that.

1118
00:57:31,335 --> 00:57:33,205
I know that
I'm sort of
pulling you away

1119
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:35,639
from your heroin chic
that you're the master at,

1120
00:57:35,672 --> 00:57:38,242
but we're really
going very clean--

1121
00:57:38,275 --> 00:57:41,113
- little bit more commercial
than you usually go.
- Mm-hmm.

1122
00:57:41,146 --> 00:57:44,348
- Always really messy,
graphic hair. Anthony?
- 2-55-6.

1123
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:47,152
- Yeah.
- Let's-- you guys focus
before she gets here.

1124
00:57:47,185 --> 00:57:49,121
- Just messy--
- We're ready to go.

1125
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:51,223
I know, but I just want
to be clear because
this is big.

1126
00:57:51,256 --> 00:57:52,623
- It's big for everyone.
- I know it is.

1127
00:57:52,656 --> 00:57:54,358
- Technical.
- We're ready.

1128
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:56,693
Yeah, and we're clear
about the technical idea?

1129
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:59,363
It's very techy.
Messy, graphic,
looking away.

1130
00:57:59,396 --> 00:58:01,097
Okay.
Let's rock.

1131
00:58:01,131 --> 00:58:04,501
There she is.
Hey, Leese. How are you?

1132
00:58:04,535 --> 00:58:06,403
- Good to see you.
- I'm so glad that
you're here.

1133
00:58:06,437 --> 00:58:08,105
This is Sandy.

1134
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:10,140
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1135
00:58:10,173 --> 00:58:13,243
I've been wanting
to meet you forever.

1136
00:58:13,276 --> 00:58:15,645
Relax.

1137
00:58:15,678 --> 00:58:17,614
I loved you in
"The Applesauce Maker."

1138
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:19,249
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, you were great.

1139
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:21,417
Maybe we can get a picture
before this is all over?

1140
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:23,586
- Absolutely.
- And this is Anthony.

1141
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:25,389
I want to introduce you
to Anthony.

1142
00:58:25,422 --> 00:58:27,290
- Hello. How are you?
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1143
00:58:27,323 --> 00:58:29,125
- So exciting.
- Yeah.

1144
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:31,494
So I wanted to--
before we started,

1145
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:35,266
talk to Mario about
the clothes and how
he wants to shoot.

1146
00:58:35,299 --> 00:58:37,700
Mario?
What am I missing?

1147
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:39,569
- Mario?
- Mario.

1148
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:42,272
Mario? Am I-- am I--
tell me. I'm sorry.

1149
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:44,740
- Mario, he's actually--
- Mario! Oh!

1150
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:47,310
- Sweetheart, this is-- is--
- Anthony.

1151
00:58:47,343 --> 00:58:49,145
Anthony Heywood.
He'll be shooting
you today.

1152
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:50,546
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

1153
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,183
- They couldn't afford Mario.
- I'm sorr--

1154
00:58:53,216 --> 00:58:54,649
- No worries.
- I work a lot cheaper.

1155
00:58:54,683 --> 00:58:56,651
- Stop it.
- Please, stop it.

1156
00:58:56,685 --> 00:58:59,188
- I'm just an idiot.
I'm really bad with names.
- No.

1157
00:58:59,221 --> 00:59:01,757
- That's all right.
- What can I get you?
Drink, coffee, water?

1158
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,193
Water, but I would
like to, at some point,

1159
00:59:04,226 --> 00:59:05,594
kind of go over
the concept.

1160
00:59:05,627 --> 00:59:08,230
It kind of seemed
a bit vampy to me.

1161
00:59:08,263 --> 00:59:11,167
- Vampy.
- No, we're not
going vampy at all.

1162
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:14,336
- It's more Barbarella.
- Are you happy with
Barbarella?

1163
00:59:14,369 --> 00:59:18,408
We've got you in the most
amazing Châtié outfit.
You're gonna flip.

1164
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:21,276
Why don't you show her
the dresses 'cause I picked
out a whole bunch for you.

1165
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:23,345
You can see if
there are any you're
comfortable with.

1166
00:59:23,378 --> 00:59:25,547
- I'll let you guys get started.
- Let me introduce you
to Jacqueline,

1167
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,316
our makeup artist
who's amazing.

1168
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:28,717
Why don't you grab
a water for her?

1169
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,718
All right.
Thanks so much.

1170
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:34,189
Leese, what kind of water?

1171
00:59:34,223 --> 00:59:36,225
- Evian?
- Evian's fine.

1172
00:59:36,258 --> 00:59:40,394
- Or the Lalique.
Get her the Lalique.
- Okay.

1173
00:59:40,428 --> 00:59:42,730
No, I just think
the film looked like
it was from the '80s.

1174
00:59:42,763 --> 00:59:44,765
- It looked like from 1987.
I was like-- what magazine
- Darcy?

1175
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,735
do they think
they're shooting from?

1176
00:59:46,768 --> 00:59:48,802
- One second.
- I think they're having
a little problem.

1177
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,205
No, no. We're gonna
have to reshoot it.

1178
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:53,474
- I think they're having
a little problem.
- Sweetie, hold on.

1179
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,577
- I can't get into this now.
- Wilemina: Tell her
how hot she is.

1180
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,545
- Let me call you right back.
- I like that.

1181
00:59:57,578 --> 01:00:01,250
- Oh, my God.
You look amazing!
- No.

1182
01:00:01,283 --> 01:00:03,352
This is so silly.

1183
01:00:03,385 --> 01:00:06,654
Sounds like
an express train
coming at you.

1184
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:08,556
He looks up and the grill
is coming right at him.

1185
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:10,458
It's charging,
you know?

1186
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:12,626
Leese:
I don't like this.
This isn't me.

1187
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,628
- This isn't
what we talked about.
- Darcy: It's inspired.

1188
01:00:14,662 --> 01:00:16,530
- I've never seen
anything like it.
- Oh, hey.

1189
01:00:16,564 --> 01:00:18,332
- There's no reason
to get upset.
- Quiet.

1190
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:21,635
I want a new outfit.
I am so uncomfortable.

1191
01:00:21,669 --> 01:00:24,237
- I'll come in,
we'll look around.
- I look like a hooker.

1192
01:00:24,271 --> 01:00:26,239
Come on!
What kind of
cover is this?

1193
01:00:26,273 --> 01:00:28,775
Okay, let go of me before
somebody loses their job.

1194
01:00:28,808 --> 01:00:30,443
Let Anthony
handle it.

1195
01:00:30,477 --> 01:00:32,446
What your idea is?

1196
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,714
- What's with the fringe?
- Darcy, Darcy, Darcy.

1197
01:00:34,747 --> 01:00:36,783
If you touch me
one more time,

1198
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:39,252
I don't think "A"
will ever work with your

1199
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:43,390
- ridiculous--
- If she walks out,
none of us will have a job.

1200
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:46,494
- Get me Janice
on the phone now.
- Sorry about that.

1201
01:00:46,527 --> 01:00:48,462
Don't worry about it.

1202
01:00:48,496 --> 01:00:50,498
A little slice
of heaven, that is.

1203
01:00:52,832 --> 01:00:54,834
Peace.

1204
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,706
Could be nice.

1205
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:02,409
They give me a headache,
those guys.

1206
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:07,580
The whole thing
gives me a headache.

1207
01:01:09,448 --> 01:01:11,750
Where did we lose control
of this business?

1208
01:01:13,585 --> 01:01:15,655
When did the suits
take over?

1209
01:01:17,357 --> 01:01:19,291
It used to be fun.

1210
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:21,627
Nobody listens anymore.
That's what's weird.

1211
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:24,296
No, they're all
pushing their agendas.

1212
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,865
They've all got things
that they want to do.

1213
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:30,503
Darcy:
It's not with him.
That's not the problem.

1214
01:01:30,537 --> 01:01:32,305
My God.

1215
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:33,873
She's wearing cashmere.

1216
01:01:40,612 --> 01:01:42,581
So...

1217
01:01:42,614 --> 01:01:44,616
So perhaps
without fringe.

1218
01:01:45,884 --> 01:01:49,888
Please. Without any
of that ludicrous stuff.

1219
01:01:49,921 --> 01:01:51,923
That is just ridiculous.

1220
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:55,726
Oh, my God.

1221
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,795
Look,

1222
01:01:57,828 --> 01:02:01,333
we can do
whatever you want.

1223
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:04,369
If you don't
want to do anything,
we won't do anything.

1224
01:02:04,402 --> 01:02:07,738
If you still want
to take a picture,

1225
01:02:07,772 --> 01:02:09,808
if you still want
to do this,

1226
01:02:09,841 --> 01:02:13,411
I'll be happy to do it.
I'd be happy to.

1227
01:02:13,444 --> 01:02:14,846
Calming her down.

1228
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,550
I think-- no offense, Sandy,
but I really do think we--

1229
01:02:18,584 --> 01:02:20,951
- Anthony: Morton?
- We have a look that
we're going for.

1230
01:02:20,985 --> 01:02:23,354
Could you guys leave?
Take this outside?

1231
01:02:23,388 --> 01:02:25,490
- Morton, there's
a change of plan.
- I'm sorry?

1232
01:02:25,523 --> 01:02:28,526
Yeah, there's a change of plan.
I think there's a change
of photographer.

1233
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,795
Could you guys go outside?

1234
01:02:30,828 --> 01:02:33,364
- That's a good idea, Anthony.
- Let me ask you something.

1235
01:02:33,398 --> 01:02:34,832
- I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you.
- Do you want to shoot

1236
01:02:34,865 --> 01:02:36,767
- for "A" magazine?
- Get out!

1237
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:38,768
That's what
I'm saying to you.
Get out.

1238
01:02:38,802 --> 01:02:40,870
- The photographer
has asked you to leave.
- Excuse me.

1239
01:02:40,904 --> 01:02:43,407
- Get your bags.
- Janice is gonna be--

1240
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,911
Say goodbye
to your career, pal.
Say goodbye to your career.

1241
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:49,546
Darcy:
Willa, get my bag,
please. Now.

1242
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:54,785
When I was...

1243
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:58,488
I don't even know
how old I was.

1244
01:02:59,957 --> 01:03:01,792
- Hold that, hold that.
- ( shutter clicks )

1245
01:03:01,826 --> 01:03:03,528
That's good.
That's really good.

1246
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:05,662
I developed this...

1247
01:03:05,695 --> 01:03:07,864
fascination
with Mighty Mouse.

1248
01:03:07,897 --> 01:03:10,600
Um...

1249
01:03:10,634 --> 01:03:12,569
my mother came along.
She sees me up on this balcony

1250
01:03:12,602 --> 01:03:14,572
and she freaked.

1251
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:16,706
She said,
"What are you doing up there?

1252
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,975
Get down off the balcony."

1253
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:22,011
I said, "No, no, no.
I'm Mighty Mouse.

1254
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:25,448
I can fly!
I know I can fly."

1255
01:03:25,481 --> 01:03:29,018
So she says--
so her mind's racing.

1256
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:31,421
She's trying to figure out
a way to stop me
from jumping off

1257
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:33,556
because I was gonna jump.

1258
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:36,792
She goes,
"Wait, wait, wait.

1259
01:03:36,825 --> 01:03:39,996
Doesn't Mighty Mouse
have a big M

1260
01:03:40,029 --> 01:03:41,930
on the back of his cape?

1261
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:43,800
You don't have an M
on the back of your cape."

1262
01:03:43,833 --> 01:03:46,670
I started kicking
and punching and fighting.

1263
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:49,973
"Let me go, let me go,
let me go! I can fly!
I know I can fly!"

1264
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:52,741
I'm convinced
to this day that--

1265
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:56,712
that's great.
That is great. Hang on.

1266
01:03:56,745 --> 01:04:00,649
That I would have flown
if they'd let me go.

1267
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:05,521
It's funny
when you grow up

1268
01:04:05,554 --> 01:04:07,690
in a small place like that

1269
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:09,991
and you have this
kind of odd relationship

1270
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:12,660
with one of your parents

1271
01:04:12,694 --> 01:04:15,764
like my mom and I had,

1272
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:17,965
because I didn't know
any different.

1273
01:04:17,999 --> 01:04:22,570
It's so weird when
your childhood is--

1274
01:04:22,604 --> 01:04:25,741
that's your reality.

1275
01:04:25,774 --> 01:04:28,611
I really thought that

1276
01:04:28,644 --> 01:04:32,581
maybe all mothers
sat in bed all day being sad

1277
01:04:32,615 --> 01:04:35,717
and you had to entertain them
and make them happy.

1278
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,853
Which is what I did.

1279
01:04:38,886 --> 01:04:42,557
- We used to put
the Moody Blues on.
- Hold that.

1280
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,760
I'd put the Moody Blues on
and I'd dance for her.

1281
01:04:45,793 --> 01:04:48,496
Do this really
modern dance thing

1282
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:51,098
and then I'd run
to a keyboard--

1283
01:04:51,132 --> 01:04:53,600
we couldn't
afford a piano.

1284
01:04:53,634 --> 01:04:56,570
I would run to this keyboard
and do these extravagant--

1285
01:04:56,603 --> 01:04:59,807
sort of, like, fabulous--

1286
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:02,076
I thought I was making
really incredible music.

1287
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:06,647
Sometimes my mother
would be laughing so hard

1288
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:10,585
or just loving it
and then she would
go completely...

1289
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:16,591
silent.

1290
01:06:34,098 --> 01:06:35,734
- Mario: How you doing?
- All right.

1291
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,802
- Look it here.
- Hey, "Mr. Wigger."

1292
01:06:40,005 --> 01:06:42,775
- What's up, J.B.?
- How you doing?

1293
01:06:42,808 --> 01:06:44,810
- All right.
- All right.

1294
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:50,615
I would like to present
my father Lorenzo Mancini.

1295
01:06:50,649 --> 01:06:52,050
- Mr. Mancini.
- You know J.B.

1296
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:54,753
Pleasure to meet you, J.B.

1297
01:06:54,786 --> 01:06:58,924
- Mr. J.B., Guido.
- Guido, it's a pleasure.

1298
01:07:01,926 --> 01:07:04,195
- Just relax.
- Is beautiful apartment.

1299
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:06,931
- Very airy, very nice.
- It's all right.

1300
01:07:06,965 --> 01:07:08,932
I don't really stay here
too much, but they had
nothing available.

1301
01:07:08,966 --> 01:07:10,834
- It's on the top floor, though.
- Oh, I see.

1302
01:07:10,868 --> 01:07:13,772
Mario:
I told you this guy
knows living.

1303
01:07:13,805 --> 01:07:16,841
If there's one thing he knows,
it's living. That's what
I'm talking about.

1304
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:18,709
Look at how these guys
are decked out right now.

1305
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:20,043
Look at this.

1306
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,646
You could be taking such
a piece of this market.

1307
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,683
It's so potentially
lucrative for you.

1308
01:07:24,716 --> 01:07:27,652
Instead you're giving it up
to Christie Brothers...

1309
01:07:27,686 --> 01:07:30,822
Hilfiger.
All of Polo.

1310
01:07:30,855 --> 01:07:33,892
- Fofo. Nike.
- You gotta realize,
right now,

1311
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:37,127
the urban culture, man,
this is where they want to be.

1312
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,663
This is where
your new direction
should be.

1313
01:07:39,697 --> 01:07:41,264
We've been
checking the charts.

1314
01:07:41,298 --> 01:07:43,201
The company's not doing
too well over there,

1315
01:07:43,234 --> 01:07:45,669
you know what I mean?

1316
01:07:45,703 --> 01:07:48,672
You know what I'm saying?
As far as adapting for
the future, man.

1317
01:07:48,706 --> 01:07:52,209
These young kids right now,
they got it locked. Hip hop
got the world locked.

1318
01:07:52,242 --> 01:07:53,943
Lorenzo:
I think I must tell you,

1319
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:56,012
you are very gracious,
very much gentleman.

1320
01:07:56,045 --> 01:08:00,117
But House of Mancini
is completely different.

1321
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:03,953
We would not be able
to redesign and fabricate

1322
01:08:03,986 --> 01:08:07,690
in such a manner
that we could really do
something comfortable.

1323
01:08:07,724 --> 01:08:09,993
I myself are
from a tradition.

1324
01:08:10,027 --> 01:08:12,863
When I start out,
I was--

1325
01:08:12,896 --> 01:08:14,832
Dad, wait a second.

1326
01:08:14,865 --> 01:08:17,134
I thought that we had
an understanding here

1327
01:08:17,167 --> 01:08:19,770
that this was
pretty manageable.

1328
01:08:19,803 --> 01:08:22,705
I understand
what you say,

1329
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,707
but I see now

1330
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:27,945
what you are
asking me to do
is impossible.

1331
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:31,080
- Mario: You will make so much
money. How is it impossible?
- Let me say one thing.

1332
01:08:31,113 --> 01:08:33,115
You say you
come from tradition.

1333
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:35,785
Tradition is
that tradition must change.

1334
01:08:35,818 --> 01:08:38,720
Right? You can't go on
the same way you've
been doing it.

1335
01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:40,722
You gotta adapt
to the times.

1336
01:08:40,756 --> 01:08:42,859
I'm actually trying
to give you an in.

1337
01:08:42,892 --> 01:08:44,727
Now, you can go with me

1338
01:08:44,761 --> 01:08:46,895
'cause it ain't gonna get
no better than J.B.

1339
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:49,230
Or you can go to one
of these old roly-poly
motherfuckers

1340
01:08:49,264 --> 01:08:51,867
and get it that way.

1341
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:54,771
I'm just trying to give you
an in and your son because he
know what he talking about.

1342
01:08:54,804 --> 01:08:57,006
The kids in the street,
the kids in the suburbs

1343
01:08:57,039 --> 01:08:58,808
is just gonna follow
what they do.

1344
01:08:58,841 --> 01:09:01,043
You feel me?
We put this shit
down right there.

1345
01:09:01,077 --> 01:09:03,079
We've been wearing
baggy clothes because, why?

1346
01:09:03,112 --> 01:09:05,113
- Because we didn't
have no clothes.
- Lorenzo: Is very nice.

1347
01:09:05,146 --> 01:09:06,915
- Because we had 10 brothers
and sisters--
- I agree.

1348
01:09:06,948 --> 01:09:08,950
- Listen to what I am saying.
- Mario: Listen, Dad.

1349
01:09:08,984 --> 01:09:10,920
This is what I'm saying.
That's where the culture
come from.

1350
01:09:10,953 --> 01:09:13,789
We made that a culture
and now they gonna
make it a fashion.

1351
01:09:13,822 --> 01:09:16,191
And they're gonna sell
jeans for $100-150.

1352
01:09:16,224 --> 01:09:17,893
You right. Them kids
can't afford that,

1353
01:09:17,926 --> 01:09:19,761
but that's
the game they playin'.

1354
01:09:19,795 --> 01:09:21,062
So why wouldn't you play?

1355
01:09:21,096 --> 01:09:22,997
I see what
you're saying.

1356
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,767
You are very intelligent.
Very wonderful person.

1357
01:09:25,801 --> 01:09:28,236
I can see it
and my boy Mario

1358
01:09:28,269 --> 01:09:29,971
tried to do
something wonderful

1359
01:09:30,005 --> 01:09:31,906
and you must
please forgive me,

1360
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:34,909
but is not something
from business point
of view

1361
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:38,779
- or artistic point of view
that I can accomplish.
- You're lying.

1362
01:09:38,813 --> 01:09:40,249
- You're lying.
- Why do you say that?

1363
01:09:40,282 --> 01:09:42,784
Artistically I know it
interests you because--

1364
01:09:42,818 --> 01:09:44,352
- let's go back to when
you first started.
- I wish...

1365
01:09:44,385 --> 01:09:46,221
Did somebody give
you a chance when
you first started?

1366
01:09:46,254 --> 01:09:48,790
Did somebody look at you
and say, "Oh, Mancini.
Oh, that guy."

1367
01:09:48,824 --> 01:09:50,925
They've got Armani.
They've got Versace.

1368
01:09:50,958 --> 01:09:52,860
They've got all of these guys
that you came up with.

1369
01:09:52,893 --> 01:09:54,194
You made your bones.

1370
01:09:54,228 --> 01:09:56,331
- I should be outside.
- No, you shouldn't.

1371
01:09:56,364 --> 01:09:58,166
- No, you shouldn't.
- Yes, I should.

1372
01:09:58,199 --> 01:09:59,900
Absolutely not.
You shouldn't.

1373
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,802
- Who's the boss?
- I--

1374
01:10:01,836 --> 01:10:04,805
Not you. Not me. You brought
this idea to your father,

1375
01:10:04,839 --> 01:10:07,041
he's intrigued,
and look where we are.

1376
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:08,942
- Guido, listen.
- Did you think in a million
years we would ever end up

1377
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:11,145
- in a place like this?
- Obviously not.

1378
01:10:11,178 --> 01:10:13,280
- I appreciate it. Trust me.
- Congratulations.

1379
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:17,216
- Thank you, but I think--
- If you want his respect,
respect him.

1380
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,819
All right, let me talk
in your language.

1381
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:21,320
This is from
"The Godfather."

1382
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:24,124
All I'm saying is the don
is slipping a little.

1383
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:26,861
- You know what I mean?
- Is gangster metaphor.

1384
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:28,996
- Yeah, gangster metaphor.
- This is gangster rap, eh?

1385
01:10:29,029 --> 01:10:31,832
- Gangster rap.
I know what you're doing.
- I like you, man.

1386
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:33,333
- I like you a lot.
- I like you, too.

1387
01:10:33,367 --> 01:10:35,101
- You are wonderful person.
- Think about it.

1388
01:10:35,134 --> 01:10:36,836
That's your son.

1389
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,172
I respect you as a man,
I admire you as a businessman,

1390
01:10:39,205 --> 01:10:41,108
and I have a lot
to learn from you.

1391
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:43,310
I would love to be
around you and pick
your brain and learn.

1392
01:10:43,343 --> 01:10:46,913
But I'm saying
give it a thought

1393
01:10:46,946 --> 01:10:49,849
and let it sit because
I'm telling you we could be--

1394
01:10:49,883 --> 01:10:51,985
there is no failure.
You'll lose nothing here.

1395
01:10:52,018 --> 01:10:53,919
One thing we must be
is friends, eh?

1396
01:10:53,952 --> 01:10:55,955
- We can be friends?
- Definitely.

1397
01:10:55,989 --> 01:10:57,857
- I'm good.
- This is Guido.

1398
01:10:57,891 --> 01:10:59,859
- Simone.
- Hello. Nice to meet you.

1399
01:10:59,893 --> 01:11:01,227
- Nice to meet you.
- You have beautiful eyes.

1400
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,095
Oh, thank you.

1401
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:05,263
And who is this
beautiful young lady?

1402
01:11:05,297 --> 01:11:07,900
This is my
girlfriend Simone.

1403
01:11:07,933 --> 01:11:11,037
You just don't even know.
I'm your biggest fan.

1404
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:13,973
I was just in Milan
and I went to some
shows. I bought--

1405
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:16,009
I have this gold medal
outfit that you made.

1406
01:11:16,042 --> 01:11:18,411
- It's so beautiful.
- Thank you. You are so sweet.

1407
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:21,346
- You are the bomb. You are.
- This is Roberta Colaredo.

1408
01:11:21,379 --> 01:11:23,281
- Not me.
- Yes, how did you know?

1409
01:11:23,315 --> 01:11:25,151
Because I know.
It's my business to know.

1410
01:11:25,184 --> 01:11:28,420
Beautiful figure.
You remind me of young...

1411
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:33,125
So, Dad, what did you guys
talk about on the balcony?

1412
01:11:33,158 --> 01:11:35,894
Mario, uh...

1413
01:11:35,928 --> 01:11:38,062
you know,
is question of, uh,

1414
01:11:40,232 --> 01:11:43,135
he want to--
I must metamorphose myself.

1415
01:11:43,168 --> 01:11:46,304
Impossible, but he
will come over for lunch.

1416
01:11:46,338 --> 01:11:49,406
I will cook.
We will have glass of wine.

1417
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:54,313
Is nice fellow.
Very intelligent,
very positive.

1418
01:11:54,347 --> 01:11:57,249
Janice:
Unadulterated.
Provocative.

1419
01:11:57,282 --> 01:11:59,217
Inventive. Unique.
Essential.

1420
01:11:59,251 --> 01:12:01,019
Essential.

1421
01:12:01,053 --> 01:12:03,455
Once in a lifetime.
Rock 'n' roll.

1422
01:12:03,488 --> 01:12:05,322
Genius.

1423
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,161
How you pulled it off,
I'll never know.

1424
01:12:11,296 --> 01:12:15,499
- I just trusted my gut.
- You had a fit and threw
everybody out.

1425
01:12:15,532 --> 01:12:18,069
- They weren't listening.
- Oh!

1426
01:12:18,102 --> 01:12:21,138
They weren't listening.
It wasn't gonna happen.

1427
01:12:21,172 --> 01:12:23,439
- Mr. "Very big dick."
- They were getting into
a fight.

1428
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:27,078
I did what I had to do
to rescue the situation.

1429
01:12:27,111 --> 01:12:29,180
Mr. "Very big cock
on the block."

1430
01:12:29,213 --> 01:12:33,149
You did it, though.
You pulled it off.

1431
01:12:33,183 --> 01:12:35,451
I'm gonna take you
to that Fantasia
party tonight.

1432
01:12:35,485 --> 01:12:37,954
I'm gonna introduce you.

1433
01:12:37,988 --> 01:12:40,324
Phillip Brosco?

1434
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:43,227
- That got your attention.
- Yeah.

1435
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:47,431
They're looking for
a photographer for
their campaign.

1436
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:49,499
- Yes, they are.
- I keep my ear
to the ground.

1437
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,968
I know what's going on.

1438
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:55,139
- Would you like to come?
- I'd love to. I mean, yes.

1439
01:12:58,109 --> 01:13:00,110
Man:
I heard this is black tie.

1440
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:03,513
Messy fucker.

1441
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:06,516
Forget about black ties.

1442
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,986
Forget about it.

1443
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:13,089
You just
let me know.

1444
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:16,126
- Phil Brosco.
- Bye now.

1445
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:18,427
- Hi.
- Daniel.

1446
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,262
Camille, very nice
to see you.

1447
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,131
Thank you,
Daniel.

1448
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:24,135
Please, sit down.

1449
01:13:24,168 --> 01:13:26,136
Over here.

1450
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:31,041
Here, let me help you.

1451
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:33,009
Thank you.
Sit back.

1452
01:13:33,043 --> 01:13:35,477
Arrange the pillows
properly for you.

1453
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:39,149
- So you have kind of
a little throne.
- Thanks.

1454
01:13:39,182 --> 01:13:41,417
Jamie, why don't
you sit over here?
You're so beautiful.

1455
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:44,153
When you're there,
I can't look at Camille
and get distracted.

1456
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:46,021
Sit over here, please.

1457
01:13:46,055 --> 01:13:47,556
Thanks.

1458
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:49,058
So...

1459
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,260
- Camille.
- Hello.

1460
01:13:52,293 --> 01:13:54,229
Hello.
Is that yours?

1461
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,231
- No.
- That's nice.

1462
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,466
- Thank you.
- That's good.

1463
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:00,302
"Nothing is so sad
as the man

1464
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:03,071
who's doomed
to mediocrity in
the work he loves."

1465
01:14:05,339 --> 01:14:07,308
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

1466
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:09,512
It's true, isn't it?
Did you ever think about it?

1467
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,213
- No.
- Who said it?

1468
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,516
Well, it's either--

1469
01:14:14,549 --> 01:14:16,351
it's either--

1470
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,420
is it Professor
Irwin Corey?

1471
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:21,489
He's pulling my leg.

1472
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:24,059
He knows,
but he won't say.

1473
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,295
He wants to make me
look foolish.

1474
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:30,064
- No, that's not true.
- He's trying to humiliate me.

1475
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,300
- I know this.
- I'm not--

1476
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:34,168
- You see he's blushing?
- No.

1477
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:39,207
It was Henry James.

1478
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,410
I read that,
I was overwhelmed.

1479
01:14:42,443 --> 01:14:44,512
Overwhelmed.

1480
01:14:44,545 --> 01:14:47,414
Why? Why?

1481
01:14:47,447 --> 01:14:50,083
Well, because
it was true.

1482
01:14:50,117 --> 01:14:52,219
I was doomed
to mediocrity

1483
01:14:52,252 --> 01:14:54,589
in the thing
that I loved.

1484
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:57,358
What did I love?
This. I loved this.

1485
01:14:57,391 --> 01:15:00,161
If I could do this.
A creator.

1486
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:02,096
See...

1487
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,231
you could be
the creator.

1488
01:15:04,264 --> 01:15:06,399
So you're by
definition present.

1489
01:15:06,433 --> 01:15:09,370
I have to create a situation
where I can be present

1490
01:15:09,403 --> 01:15:11,239
at the creation.

1491
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:13,606
Therefore, I need you.
You don't need me.

1492
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,442
Isn't that so?

1493
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:19,146
I'm-- I just draw

1494
01:15:19,179 --> 01:15:23,483
and I'm--
I'm not some big person
that you think I am.

1495
01:15:23,516 --> 01:15:27,120
I'm just--
I don't know.

1496
01:15:27,154 --> 01:15:30,390
I'm just from Irvine

1497
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:33,325
and I draw things
and make clothes.

1498
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:36,128
When I was young...

1499
01:15:36,162 --> 01:15:39,200
I went to camp
when I was just
bumming around Europe

1500
01:15:39,233 --> 01:15:42,202
and I went to
a restaurant in Nice

1501
01:15:42,235 --> 01:15:44,671
because they said,
"Picasso eats here."

1502
01:15:44,704 --> 01:15:47,540
So I went to this restaurant
every night for a week.

1503
01:15:47,574 --> 01:15:49,408
- Finally, Picasso came in.
- Mm-hmm.

1504
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:51,310
I didn't even speak
to him, but I heard him

1505
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:53,346
at one point
saying to somebody--

1506
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,715
he was talking in English
because a couple people
were there.

1507
01:15:55,748 --> 01:15:58,250
Not so good English,
but anyways, speaking
in English.

1508
01:15:58,284 --> 01:16:00,286
He said,
"I just draw."

1509
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:04,223
"I just draw."

1510
01:16:05,757 --> 01:16:08,494
- Hmm.
- Well, that's all
you have to do.

1511
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:11,563
Just draw.
Everything else I do.

1512
01:16:11,597 --> 01:16:15,267
And I do it for
the sake of you drawing,
to allow you to draw.

1513
01:16:17,435 --> 01:16:20,238
Camille:
I knew we were gonna be
talking about this,

1514
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:22,508
so I just wrote down

1515
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:25,244
some things--

1516
01:16:25,277 --> 01:16:28,247
'cause my partner and I
aren't really seeing

1517
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,615
eye to eye
for a while now.

1518
01:16:29,648 --> 01:16:33,751
I feel she's
sort of limited.

1519
01:16:33,784 --> 01:16:35,720
I wanted to create a line

1520
01:16:35,753 --> 01:16:39,491
that's more clever
and accessible

1521
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:42,494
so that everyone
can enjoy it.

1522
01:16:42,528 --> 01:16:46,197
She's not really
there with me.

1523
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:49,634
I feel like I'm constantly
reinventing the wheel

1524
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:52,803
in images that
generate excitement.

1525
01:16:52,837 --> 01:16:56,507
Right now I have
this idea--

1526
01:16:56,541 --> 01:17:00,211
Okay. Okay.

1527
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:03,713
- I thought maybe--
- Do you wanna
come with me?

1528
01:17:03,747 --> 01:17:06,517
We could create
some sort of

1529
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:10,655
growth strategy
and maybe work together.

1530
01:17:10,688 --> 01:17:14,259
- Would you like to?
- I think I would.

1531
01:17:14,292 --> 01:17:17,428
I think I would.
What about you, Jamie?

1532
01:17:17,462 --> 01:17:20,530
Mm-hmm.
Look at you.

1533
01:17:20,564 --> 01:17:23,701
You look like
you've known each other
for 100 years anyway.

1534
01:17:23,734 --> 01:17:26,371
You look cozy
and it feels

1535
01:17:26,404 --> 01:17:28,738
like a partnership to me.

1536
01:17:28,772 --> 01:17:32,342
Will you sit here
while I go out there?

1537
01:17:32,376 --> 01:17:34,811
- If you like.
- Excuse me.

1538
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:39,249
- He's incredible.
- Yeah.

1539
01:17:39,283 --> 01:17:40,584
He's so sweet.

1540
01:17:40,617 --> 01:17:43,420
He's so warm
and I had no idea.

1541
01:17:43,453 --> 01:17:46,255
I thought he was
gonna be some sleazy guy.

1542
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:47,823
- He's not at all.
- Right.

1543
01:17:47,856 --> 01:17:49,758
- This sounds incredible--
- Yes.

1544
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:52,529
for millions of people
to be wearing my clothes.

1545
01:17:52,562 --> 01:17:56,300
- That's--
- That's a good thing,
I suppose.

1546
01:17:58,435 --> 01:18:00,304
- I suppose, you're--
- Thank you.

1547
01:18:00,337 --> 01:18:02,806
You're welcome.
I like to see
you excited.

1548
01:18:02,839 --> 01:18:04,840
- You okay?
- Yes.

1549
01:18:04,873 --> 01:18:07,711
- What?
- I'm just thinking
about you a little bit.

1550
01:18:07,744 --> 01:18:09,513
- Why?
- And thinking that

1551
01:18:09,546 --> 01:18:12,282
you haven't done this
so much before.

1552
01:18:12,316 --> 01:18:14,650
I didn't even warn you
too much about this

1553
01:18:14,683 --> 01:18:17,353
or da, da, da.

1554
01:18:17,386 --> 01:18:18,887
This is when it
seems exciting

1555
01:18:18,921 --> 01:18:20,824
and he puts his best foot
forward and everything.

1556
01:18:20,857 --> 01:18:23,826
- Is he not--
- He's quite okay.

1557
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:26,895
Well, I'm glad you're
doing some talking.

1558
01:18:26,929 --> 01:18:28,831
I was talking
so much before.

1559
01:18:28,864 --> 01:18:31,766
I know, sorry.
I was a little out
of it and-- this place.

1560
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:34,436
That's all right.
You're not out of it.
Will you hand me those coats?

1561
01:18:34,469 --> 01:18:36,705
- Where are we going?
- May I take you to dinner?

1562
01:18:36,739 --> 01:18:39,608
- Sure. That would be great.
- We have some things to talk
about, I think.

1563
01:18:39,642 --> 01:18:41,577
- Don't we?
- Yes.

1564
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,712
- Here we go.
- Le Cirque? What do you think?

1565
01:18:43,746 --> 01:18:45,848
Ooh.

1566
01:18:45,881 --> 01:18:48,450
- Here we go.
- Oh, the two of you
are going?

1567
01:18:48,483 --> 01:18:51,420
- Yes.
- Oh.

1568
01:18:51,454 --> 01:18:53,556
We're going to
cement the deal.

1569
01:18:53,589 --> 01:18:55,758
- Jamie, thank you very much.
- You're so welcome.

1570
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,459
- Thank you.
- Wonderfully done.

1571
01:18:57,492 --> 01:18:59,361
- We'll talk later.
- Yeah. Are you okay?

1572
01:18:59,394 --> 01:19:01,363
- I'm fine.
- I'll talk to you later.

1573
01:19:01,396 --> 01:19:02,764
- Okay.
- Okay.

1574
01:19:02,797 --> 01:19:05,468
- Good night, Jamie.
- Good night.

1575
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,814
- Anthony: Hey.
- Hey.

1576
01:19:21,649 --> 01:19:24,419
- Where are you?
- I'm in here.

1577
01:19:26,854 --> 01:19:29,691
Champagne, huh?
What's up--

1578
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:32,794
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

1579
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:34,896
You're kind of
early, though.

1580
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:38,533
Oh, I'm early.

1581
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:41,369
- Did I forget something?
- No, I'm just not ready.

1582
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:43,870
I was gonna do
some other stuff, but...

1583
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,639
Oh.

1584
01:19:45,672 --> 01:19:47,974
How much time
do you need?

1585
01:19:48,008 --> 01:19:50,945
- I can nip off for an hour
and come back.
- Come here.

1586
01:19:53,614 --> 01:19:57,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

1587
01:20:02,688 --> 01:20:04,991
- I'm glad you're early.
- You look great.

1588
01:20:05,025 --> 01:20:07,027
Mm-hmm.

1589
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:19,940
- What did you have in mind?
- I have such a night planned.

1590
01:20:19,973 --> 01:20:22,476
- You do?
- Yes.

1591
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:24,445
Really?

1592
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,416
Oh, fuck.

1593
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:33,586
I'm not letting you go
till light comes up, mister.

1594
01:20:46,765 --> 01:20:48,901
- How are you?
- Good.

1595
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:50,936
Yeah?

1596
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:16,495
What?

1597
01:21:19,765 --> 01:21:21,600
What?

1598
01:21:21,633 --> 01:21:24,035
We got invited to a party
and I said we'd go.

1599
01:21:34,879 --> 01:21:37,616
We don't have to go.
It doesn't matter.

1600
01:21:37,649 --> 01:21:39,918
Come here.

1601
01:21:39,951 --> 01:21:42,020
No, you know what?
You should go.

1602
01:21:42,053 --> 01:21:44,589
- I don't wanna go.
- I said we.

1603
01:21:44,623 --> 01:21:46,891
- If we're not going,
then I'm not going.
- No, you should go.

1604
01:21:46,925 --> 01:21:50,762
Come on.
We're not going.

1605
01:21:50,795 --> 01:21:52,897
If we aren't going,
we aren't going.

1606
01:21:52,931 --> 01:21:54,899
No, I think you should go.
I want you to go.

1607
01:21:54,933 --> 01:21:56,934
Go.

1608
01:22:00,638 --> 01:22:03,808
- I'm not mad, okay? I just--
- Seems like it.

1609
01:22:07,711 --> 01:22:11,515
Why would that
break this mood up?

1610
01:22:11,549 --> 01:22:13,751
- I don't understand.
- Because I don't wanna
go to a party.

1611
01:22:13,784 --> 01:22:16,018
- I don't wanna go out.
- Fine. We're not gonna go.

1612
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:18,055
But you wanna go.

1613
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:21,859
I said we got invited to
a party. It's a problem,
there's no problem.

1614
01:22:21,892 --> 01:22:23,894
We're not gonna go.

1615
01:22:30,133 --> 01:22:32,603
Boy, you really don't
listen to me, do you?

1616
01:22:38,576 --> 01:22:41,645
- Why would it be
the end of the world--
- It's not the end of the world.

1617
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:44,046
- I just--
- Then what--

1618
01:22:50,588 --> 01:22:52,955
You should go.
I want you to go.

1619
01:23:00,929 --> 01:23:02,932
All right.

1620
01:23:37,065 --> 01:23:39,034
I'm gonna have to start
this conversation?

1621
01:23:41,036 --> 01:23:43,772
I'm sorry that
I haven't called.
I've just been...

1622
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:47,776
going through
something and I--

1623
01:23:49,778 --> 01:23:51,212
I don't care.

1624
01:23:54,650 --> 01:23:57,152
I--

1625
01:23:57,185 --> 01:24:00,922
I can't believe this.
I can't believe this.

1626
01:24:00,956 --> 01:24:04,192
I'm sorry. I don't want
it to be this way.
I really don't.

1627
01:24:04,225 --> 01:24:06,194
I'm not trying to--

1628
01:24:06,227 --> 01:24:07,896
I just don't--

1629
01:24:07,929 --> 01:24:10,832
I just don't feel
like I'm 18 anymore

1630
01:24:10,866 --> 01:24:13,000
- and I don't want
to do this anymore.
- Well, then grow up.

1631
01:24:13,033 --> 01:24:15,035
Well, then grow up.

1632
01:24:15,069 --> 01:24:16,938
- You're--
- Grow up.

1633
01:24:16,972 --> 01:24:19,641
Stop yelling at me.

1634
01:24:19,675 --> 01:24:21,208
- Oh, I'm not allowed
to yell at you?
- No!

1635
01:24:21,241 --> 01:24:23,177
- You're not!
- After what you
put me through?

1636
01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:25,980
Okay. I'm sorry,
but you can't--

1637
01:24:26,013 --> 01:24:28,816
you don't--
you just are too much.

1638
01:24:28,849 --> 01:24:31,718
I can't do this anymore.

1639
01:24:31,752 --> 01:24:33,654
I'm moving on.

1640
01:24:33,688 --> 01:24:35,856
If you think the pressure
is too much now, Camille,

1641
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:38,659
- what's it gonna be like
when you go to work for Jamie?
- I don't know!

1642
01:24:38,693 --> 01:24:40,795
- I don't know because--
- You're gonna be like
every other designer

1643
01:24:40,828 --> 01:24:42,863
- that sells out
to a big conglomerate
- Maybe.

1644
01:24:42,897 --> 01:24:45,065
- and they can't even use
their name anymore
- Uh-huh.

1645
01:24:45,099 --> 01:24:47,035
because somebody else
owns it.

1646
01:24:47,068 --> 01:24:49,136
That's what
you're gonna get into.

1647
01:24:49,169 --> 01:24:51,706
There's not gonna be
a Camille anymore.

1648
01:24:51,739 --> 01:24:54,208
There's gonna be an Inc.

1649
01:24:54,241 --> 01:24:57,243
A dot and an Inc
or a dot and a com.

1650
01:24:58,912 --> 01:25:02,216
You're gonna cease
to exist.

1651
01:25:02,249 --> 01:25:05,952
Yeah, maybe you'll have
a great loft somewhere
down in SoHo.

1652
01:25:05,985 --> 01:25:08,321
Or maybe you'll have
a whole new group of friends.

1653
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:13,993
I don't want it to be
like this with you.

1654
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:16,696
I don't want it
to be like this.

1655
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,732
I didn't choose this.

1656
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,168
You made this happen.

1657
01:25:30,276 --> 01:25:32,246
I want you
to have our thing.

1658
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:39,753
I want you
to have this.

1659
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,056
( music playing )

1660
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:47,761
( speaking French )

1661
01:27:09,006 --> 01:27:11,008
( chatter )

1662
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:17,348
Could you keep it down?

1663
01:27:49,079 --> 01:27:51,915
- Wow.
- Yeah?

1664
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:16,872
- ( buzzes )
- Halley.

1665
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:19,408
- Mom, I've got to go.
I'm running late.
- Wait a second.

1666
01:28:19,441 --> 01:28:22,077
- I wanna talk to you.
Where are you going?
- I got a train to catch.

1667
01:28:22,111 --> 01:28:24,246
Okay, but you got a second
for me, don't you?

1668
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,321
Why are you choosing now
to run after me?

1669
01:28:35,224 --> 01:28:37,326
What did you
come here for?

1670
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:39,428
What do you think
I came here for?

1671
01:28:42,396 --> 01:28:45,400
For my mom.
For answers.

1672
01:28:52,406 --> 01:28:54,408
Can you give me that?

1673
01:28:56,077 --> 01:28:57,912
Can you give me
an answer?

1674
01:28:57,946 --> 01:29:00,014
Can you tell me
why you left?

1675
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:02,116
Because I was scared
of being nothing.

1676
01:29:05,954 --> 01:29:07,521
- So I was nothing?
- No.

1677
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:09,390
- So Dad was nothing?
- No.

1678
01:29:09,423 --> 01:29:11,325
- So we were nothing?
Oh, my God.
- No. No.

1679
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:13,461
No, you weren't nothing.

1680
01:29:16,198 --> 01:29:18,299
So it would have been
nothing to be a mom?

1681
01:29:18,332 --> 01:29:20,301
I just didn't want
to be "just."

1682
01:29:22,203 --> 01:29:24,338
I messed up.
I was wrong.

1683
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,512
I don't have anything
to say to you.

1684
01:29:42,589 --> 01:29:46,026
Ray who does
the staging,

1685
01:29:46,059 --> 01:29:49,096
he's gonna allow us
to move our deposit over
to the next show.

1686
01:29:49,129 --> 01:29:52,065
- Okay.
- I figured by that time,
we could be in Barbados

1687
01:29:52,099 --> 01:29:55,235
- where extradition
is next to impossible.
- Yeah, right.

1688
01:29:55,268 --> 01:29:57,270
I'll be going
to Bali next time.

1689
01:29:59,273 --> 01:30:00,975
That's it. The lighting
and the sound guys together--

1690
01:30:01,009 --> 01:30:04,111
we lost the deposit,
but they--

1691
01:30:04,144 --> 01:30:06,546
everyone assumes
that we're gonna do
something again

1692
01:30:06,579 --> 01:30:09,149
- and they don't wanna lose
our business down the road.
- That's nice.

1693
01:30:09,182 --> 01:30:11,250
I've been playing that--
you know.

1694
01:30:11,283 --> 01:30:13,385
Hey, help us
out this time.
It happens.

1695
01:30:13,419 --> 01:30:15,422
We'll take care
of you next time.

1696
01:30:19,326 --> 01:30:22,361
I guess it's onward.

1697
01:30:22,394 --> 01:30:24,496
That's nice.
What's that?

1698
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:27,133
Oh, it's just...

1699
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:30,136
it's a perfume bottle,

1700
01:30:30,169 --> 01:30:31,537
but it's-- you know.

1701
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,372
Nice.
A lot of money
in perfume.

1702
01:30:33,405 --> 01:30:35,207
- Is that our next gig?
- Very funny.

1703
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:39,211
Roberta:
Oh, just Camille
and this is--

1704
01:30:41,313 --> 01:30:44,451
this is just
something that--
you know.

1705
01:30:44,484 --> 01:30:47,586
Just started out
as a joke almost.

1706
01:30:47,619 --> 01:30:51,257
I can't remember who
ended up with it first,

1707
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:54,160
but it kept
getting passed

1708
01:30:54,193 --> 01:30:56,427
back and forth
between us.

1709
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:59,231
Showing up
in funny places

1710
01:30:59,265 --> 01:31:01,633
and strange places

1711
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:03,469
at odd times.

1712
01:31:03,502 --> 01:31:05,503
It wasn't
a traditional thing,

1713
01:31:05,536 --> 01:31:07,672
like, "Here's the gift
I'm giving to you."

1714
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:17,515
If you turn it this way,
it looks like a teardrop.

1715
01:31:17,548 --> 01:31:19,550
Or a lamp.

1716
01:31:24,089 --> 01:31:27,292
Did I tell you what
Phillip is gonna do?

1717
01:31:27,325 --> 01:31:29,428
What?

1718
01:31:31,297 --> 01:31:35,266
He is going to make
a Camille perfume.

1719
01:31:38,103 --> 01:31:40,438
- Do you believe that?
- Really?

1720
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:42,673
Yeah, and it'll be
everywhere.

1721
01:31:42,707 --> 01:31:46,111
He said he's gonna
make it really urban

1722
01:31:46,144 --> 01:31:49,080
- and edgy and downtown.
- Ooh.

1723
01:31:49,114 --> 01:31:51,081
You know, very fashion.
Genius.

1724
01:31:51,115 --> 01:31:53,083
I hope that's
the description
of the bottle.

1725
01:31:53,117 --> 01:31:55,485
- What's a smell
that's urban and edgy?
- That's me.

1726
01:31:55,519 --> 01:31:58,223
Yeah, I know you are,
but how's that translate
into a smell?

1727
01:31:58,256 --> 01:31:59,689
- Urban and edgy smell.
- I don't know. Good.

1728
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:02,092
I'm not sure
I want to smell that.

1729
01:32:02,126 --> 01:32:03,527
But it's gonna be good.
Congratulations.

1730
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:07,131
Look at this.
I have to meet
somebody.

1731
01:32:07,164 --> 01:32:09,633
I gotta go
to a meeting.

1732
01:32:09,666 --> 01:32:11,668
- Who are you meeting?
- I gotta go.

1733
01:32:11,701 --> 01:32:14,639
- Who are you meeting?
- Oh, just some--

1734
01:32:14,672 --> 01:32:17,307
- Want me to walk
you over there?
- No, no, no.

1735
01:32:17,341 --> 01:32:20,110
I'm already late.
I didn't know that
you were gonna pop over.

1736
01:32:20,144 --> 01:32:22,512
You want me to call you?
Maybe we can have dinner.

1737
01:32:22,546 --> 01:32:25,149
- Look at me.
- Later.

1738
01:32:25,182 --> 01:32:27,183
- Okay?
- Later.

1739
01:32:52,175 --> 01:32:54,177
What is it?
What's wrong?

1740
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,452
I don't know how
to say that.
I'm sorry.

1741
01:33:05,188 --> 01:33:07,190
You don't know
how to say what?

1742
01:33:08,657 --> 01:33:10,658
Mom?

1743
01:33:11,726 --> 01:33:13,729
Oh, my God.

1744
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:19,467
Listen up.

1745
01:33:23,638 --> 01:33:26,308
Your dad is sick.

1746
01:33:26,341 --> 01:33:28,343
Very sick.

1747
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,282
- Hello.
- Hi.

1748
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,351
Gabby.

1749
01:33:38,453 --> 01:33:40,422
This is a surprise.

1750
01:33:40,455 --> 01:33:42,458
Mario.

1751
01:33:50,232 --> 01:33:52,234
Well, come on in.

1752
01:33:53,768 --> 01:33:55,769
Do you want to see...

1753
01:33:59,574 --> 01:34:02,477
Your dad's still up.
Do you wanna...

1754
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:05,446
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah? He's in
the music room.

1755
01:34:07,614 --> 01:34:11,353
( speaking Italian )

1756
01:34:11,386 --> 01:34:13,387
My darlings.

1757
01:34:16,523 --> 01:34:18,525
Lorenzo:
What's the matter?

1758
01:34:20,394 --> 01:34:22,395
What's the matter?

1759
01:34:24,498 --> 01:34:26,501
What is the matter?

1760
01:34:27,702 --> 01:34:29,704
You're told.

1761
01:34:45,419 --> 01:34:47,421
My dears.

1762
01:34:51,424 --> 01:34:55,261
Have to come to everyone.
Have to come to everyone.

1763
01:34:55,295 --> 01:34:58,298
- I know.
- At least we have time
to say goodbye.

1764
01:35:01,801 --> 01:35:04,670
Don't feel sad.
I have a good life.

1765
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,372
Good life.

1766
01:35:07,406 --> 01:35:09,542
( speaking Italian )

1767
01:35:09,575 --> 01:35:11,478
( music playing )

1768
01:35:12,913 --> 01:35:14,915
Papa.

1769
01:35:19,485 --> 01:35:21,387
Lorenzo:
I make mistake.

1770
01:35:21,421 --> 01:35:23,423
I am never
disappointed you.

1771
01:35:23,456 --> 01:35:25,290
You are a wonderful boy.

1772
01:35:25,324 --> 01:35:27,293
- Wonderful, wonderful boy.
- ( crying )

1773
01:35:27,327 --> 01:35:29,362
You are never disappoint.
You are wonderful boy.

1774
01:35:29,395 --> 01:35:31,831
- Ma'am, could you
please spare some change?
- Sorry.

1775
01:35:31,864 --> 01:35:33,866
- I'm not from here and my--
- Don't have anything for you.

1776
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:37,836
Thank you.
Have a good day.

1777
01:35:56,856 --> 01:35:58,858
( chatter )

1778
01:36:30,688 --> 01:36:33,391
Prepared this meal
especially in your honor.

1779
01:36:33,424 --> 01:36:34,792
Prepared it himself...

1780
01:36:38,862 --> 01:36:41,533
( vocalizing )

1781
01:36:43,968 --> 01:36:46,570
- Mr. J.B. Come in.
- Hey.

1782
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:53,411
Why don't we all
sit down?

1783
01:36:54,912 --> 01:36:56,914
That'll be great.

1784
01:37:05,888 --> 01:37:08,458
Guido:
A little rubbery,
but just like chicken.

1785
01:37:10,461 --> 01:37:12,730
