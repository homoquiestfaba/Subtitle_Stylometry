marie:
when you are alone eternally,

18
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,100
you live for the comfort
of the senses--

19
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,100
food, sex.

20
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
i'd become very selective,

21
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,600
and it was getting harder
for me to find food,

22
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,600
even living in the city.

23
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,500
my choosiness about food
cost me my lover,

24
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,400
and without him,
there is no sex.

25
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,700
for six nights,
i have found nothing to eat.

26
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,100
but then came good news.

27
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
i was sad.
i was starved.

28
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
it was time
to treat myself,

29
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
and i thought,

30
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,400
"what about italian?"

31
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
don't worry
about the car.

32

we have to move it.

34
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500

35
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
what took you?

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
i had to dress right.
i had to shave.

in on this.

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,500

40
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,100
have a seat.

52
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,100
so, uh, sal,
what's happening here, huh?

53
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,100
what's this?

54
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
it's a...it's a toaster.

55
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
it's a toaster oven.

56
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,100

it's a nice one.

hit this button...

59
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,100
pops open.

60
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,100
you could put
anything in here--

61
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,700
slice of pizza,
pastry.

62
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
you pop it in.

63
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,200
comes out,

64
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,700

like a limp dick.

70
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,700

korean.

72
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,700
they're getting a big chunk
of the electronics action.

73
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
do you know why?

74
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,700
because they fucking steal.

75
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,700
any fucking idea
that ain't nailed down.

76
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
you think
some korean asshole

77
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,700
came up
with the toaster oven?

78
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
well, here they are,
knocking them out.

79
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,200
where'd it come from?

80
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
what, sal?

81
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,200
the toaster?
honestly, i don't know.

82
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,200
you was with leguto.

83
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,700
when leguto fell
off the face of the earth,

84
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,300
you became mine.

85
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
then you got this idea

86
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
because i just took over,
maybe i'm confused,

87
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,200
maybe i'm letting things
slip through the cracks.

88
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,300
no, sal,
i would never think--

89
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,300
where did it come from?

90
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,800
sal, tell me
what the answer is.

91
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,300
what should i say?

92
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,800
it came from a warehouse.

93

from the airport!

of the merchandise.

just a sit-down.

yeah, but somebody
ain't getting up.

101

176
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,800
marie:
he looked promising.

177
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,400
can i give you
a ride somewhere?

178
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,300
maybe i could buy you
a drink--coffee, hot tea.

179
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
you could do
with some warming up.

180
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,800
marie:
he felt promising.

181
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,800
but his eyes were...

182
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,300
sad, so very sad.

183
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,300
my first rule--

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,500

out of your way.

river.

203
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600

marie:
my second rule--

242
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,300
always finish the food.

243
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,900
that means eliminating
the feed marks

244
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,800
and a central nervous system
disconnect.

245
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,400
[siren]

246
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,900
oh, that's o.k.

247
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
this one has everyone
a little spooked.

248
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,400
standard shotgun hit,
right?

249
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
nah. this guy's lost
a lot of blood.

250
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,400
yeah, well, he had
his head blown off.

251
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
this guy's really lost
a lot of blood.

252
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,900
it's not here.

253
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,900
decent amount of splatter,
but hardly what you'd expect.

254
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,900
blood should have settled
in his ankles,

255
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
turning them purple.

256
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,900
i'd say this guy's
about five quarts low.

257
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,900
what in hell
are you doing out here?

258
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
i was with tony
last night.

259
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,400
i heard he got hit.

260
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,400
any of these cops could be
in the mob's pocket.

261
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
the damn press is here!

262
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
he was a friend.

263
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,400
a friend?

264
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
he stood up for me.

265
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,700
without tony, i'd be in
a lot of trouble.

266
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
you're not
in trouble, gennaro.

267
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,200
you're gone.
it's over.

268
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,100
what?

269
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
i'm putting you
into protection.

270
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
morales!

271
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
you're kidding me.

272
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,600
mm-mm. you've been
under too long.

273
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
look, sinclair--

274
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
no. no.
save it, gennaro,

275
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,100
because i'm not listening
to you this time.

276
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,100
you are a danger
to this investigation

277
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,300
and to yourself.

278
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,700
i'm in
total control.

279
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,700
oh? coming here?

280
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,100
that cowboy stunt
last night with the van?

281
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,700
this asshole
was too damn close.

282
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,100
that's bullshit!
i was doing my job!

283
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,600
just get him
out of here!

284
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,600
you cannot
pull me out now.

285
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,200
it's absolutely
the wrong fucking time.

286
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,200
macelli will ask me
to make a hit.

287
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
i'm going to tape it
and nail the fucker.

288
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,700
i've lived with them
for three years--

289
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,200
eating, drinking,
stealing.

290
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,700
you've been sitting
behind a desk.

291
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,200
you come here and say,
"that's it. it's over."

292
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,200
it's all i fucking got.

293
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,700
all right. we got
your testimony, your tapes.

294
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
you'll get us
macelli, huh?

295
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,700
come on.

296
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,200
miss sinclair!

297
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
hi, guys.

298
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,200
this was the first time
my food made the front page.

299
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
hey.

300
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,700
thank you.

301
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,200
that fucking pig.
i knew he wasn't right.

302
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,700
sallie,
our problem is--

303
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,200
the problem is,
find joey gennaro.

304
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,700
put two behind
his fucking ear.

305
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,200
don't say that in front
of your attorney.

306
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,700
sinclair will come down
on you with the rico act

307
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
and freeze
your assets.

308
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
you're afraid
you won't get paid?

309
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,200
that's the least
of my worries.

310
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
i'm saying
make arrangements.

311
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
yeah. yeah. yeah.

312
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
what if i go
right here?

313
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,700
make arrangements,
that's what i'm saying!

314
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,200
make arrangements!

315
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,700
you putz.

316
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,200
who's this?

317
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
little girl got lost.

318
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,700
i figured
i'd take her home.

319
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,700
i got my ass
on the grill,

320
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,200
and you can't get
your mind off pussy.

321
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,200
jacko, ain't that the prick
from the papers?

322
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
[camera clicking]

323
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
yeah.

324
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,700
punch his fucking
lights out.

325
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,200
[tires screech]

326
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
ha ha ha!

327
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,700
you dress like a pimp
and talk like a goon.

328
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,200
what makes you news?

329
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,700
excuse me?

330
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,700
she's from out of town.

331
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,200
must be from mars
to talk like that.

332
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:58,800
nobody calls me pimp.
nobody calls me goon.

333
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,300
since i'm 16,

334
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,300
what people call me
is sallie the shark,

335
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,800
and i pick my teeth
with girls like you.

336
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
sal.

337
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,300
you're the dumbest
bitch i ever met,

338
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,300
but you got balls.

339
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,800
want a ride?
you got one.

340
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,300
i should have walked away,
but he annoyed me.

341
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,300
thanks, carmine.
you're wonderful.

342
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
maybe i got to
apologize.

343
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,300
my world's going to shit
at the speed of light.

344
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
puts me in a mood.

345
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
call me sal.

346
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,300
what do i call you?

347
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
marie.

348
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
oui,marie...

349
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,300
let's make up over
a little late supper.

350
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,800
i'd love a little
late supper,

351
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,800
but it looks like

352
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,300
we're not exactly
alone.

353
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,900
tell me about it.
my guys, the feds,

354
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
reporters.

355
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,900
probably some bastards
want to put lead in my head.

356
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
lenny, lose them.
the hideaway.

357
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
losing them, sal.

358
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,200
ok, stay on your toes.
take me about an hour.

359
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,800
right, sal.

360
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,200
where's the bag?

361
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
right here.

362

and drained his blood.

to make sure he stayed dead.

700
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,500

outside macelli's.

704
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,100

you figure
whoever iced him

708
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,100

the medical examiner's
a moron,

713
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,100
and macelli is one
dead son of a bitch.

714
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,600

715
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,100

she's got him
eating out of her claw.

or the cuffs go on.

724
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,100
i mean it.

725
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,100
calling me a killer?

726
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:51,600

00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,700
thanks.

738
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,600
sir, could you let me
powder my nose?

739
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,200
oh, yeah. sure!
absolutely.

740
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,600
go ahead.

741
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,300
i am dracula.

742
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,800
oh...

743
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,300
it's really
good to see you.

744
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:45,800
i don't know
what happened
to the driver

745
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,300
and my luggage
and...

746
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,300
well...

747
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,300
and with all this,
i...

748
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:54,300
i thought i was
in the wrong place.

749
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,300
i bid you welcome.

750
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,900
[wolves baying]

751
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,400
listen to them.

752
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,400
children of the night.

753
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:12,400
what music they make!

754
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,800
i swear on my mother,
he was dead,

755
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
and this ain't
no improvement.

756
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,900
dracula: a spider
spinning his web

757
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,900
for the unwary fly.

758
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:30,900
blood is the light,
mr. renfield.

759
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,300
[sniffing]

760
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,400
gennaro.

761
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,900
what about
gennaro, sal?

762
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:42,400
he's here.

763
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,900
what do you mean,
sal?

764
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,900
they probably
stashed that prick

765
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,900
in an underground
bunker somewhere.

766
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,400
dracula:
you'll like it.

767
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,400
renfield:
aren't you drinking?

768
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,400
dracula:
i never drink...

769
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,400
wine.

770
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
hey, sal,
wait a minute.

771
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,400
no, sallie!
don't, sallie!

772
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,400
no, sallie!
no, sallie, don't!

773
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,900
the boys will
check it out!

774
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,400
jesus christ!

775
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,900
everything all right?

776
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,400
stevie, uh...

777
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,900
gennaro split.

778
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,400
fuck!

779
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,300
i don't need this.

780
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,300
mmm.

781
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,800
sal! sal!
sal! oh, my god!

782
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
don't, sal!
don't kill him here!

783
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,200
boys, boys, help!

784
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,200
help!

785
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,200
sal, listen to me.
you're losing it.

786
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,300
don't murder a cop
on my lawn! sal!

787
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:19,700
forgive me, sal.

788
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,700
you've got to get
ahold of yourself.

789
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,800
come on.

790
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,300
come inside.

791
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:27,300
please.

792
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,300
can you believe
this cocksucker?

793
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
show up here, huh?

794
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,300
where's the gun?

795
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,800
oh, he's got cuffs!

796
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,800
let's cuff him.

797
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,100
you see, sal?

798
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,100
now that you're inside,

799
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,100
you're in
an excellent situation.

800
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,100
no blood.

801
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,100
even if the cops came

802
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,100
with a search warrant
to talk to macelli,

803
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,500
i'd tell them to get
a ouija board

804
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,100
because he's dead.

805
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,600
there's nothing in
the fucking constitution

806
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,100
clearer than freedom from
unreasonable searches,

807
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:22,100
and this isn't unreasonable,
it's demented.

808
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,600
the government can't
pronounce a man dead

809
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,100
then invade his home
looking for him.

810
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,000
you really
whacked me,

811
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,500
but there ain't
no blood.

812
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,400
what a guy, manny.

813
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,000
hey, sallie!

814
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
manny, i...

815
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
i need you.

816
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,000
sal, come on!

817
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,400
you always do for me.

818
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,400
do for me, manny.

819
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,400
it's o.k.

820
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,000
it'll be o.k.

821
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,300
[distorted voice]
do this!

822
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,200
aah!

823
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,800
aah...

824
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,800
woman in movie: the walls
around are bare,

825
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,200
echoing to our laughter,

826
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,800
as though the dead
were there.

827
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:16,200
man: ha ha!
nice little sentiment!

828
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,700
but there's more,
even nicer.

829
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,700
quaff a cup to
the dead already.

830
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,300
ah-choo!

831
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,700
oh, never mind
the rest, dear!

832
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,700
that son of a bitch
is heavy!

833
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,300
dracula:
to die, be really dead...

834
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,300
that must
be glorious.

835
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,800
woman:
why, count dracula!

836
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,800
there are far
worse things...

837
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
awaiting man...

838
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,800
than death.

839
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,300
manny?

840
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,300
manny?

841
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,400
aah!

842
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,800
out light!

843
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,400
you killed him.

844
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:46,800
nah!

845
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,400
ha!

846
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,400
resting.

847
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,400
he's dead.

848
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,900
they said i was dead.

849
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:01,300
i ask you--am i dead?

850
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,300
[gasps]

851
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,900
i got this tingle.

852
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,900
there's something
you can do for me.

853
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,900
aah!

854
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,700
this shirt is disgusting.

855
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:39,600
this fat bastard.
come on!

856
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,100
what's he got,
lead in his ass?

857
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,600
1...2...

858
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,600

859
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,600

864
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,100

please stop the car!
help me!

877
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:38,100
he killed my manny.

878
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,700
he ate my manny!

879
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,700
he wha--he--he...

880
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,200
he killed my manny!

881
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,200
he ate manny!

882
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:56,700
radio: steve, what's
happening? you find joe?

883
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,700

i'm going to grind you
down to blood...

887
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,400
and screams.

888
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,900
hey, joey, we're going to
take this nice and slow...

889
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,400
so why don't you
take your shoes off,

890
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,900

891
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,900
whoa! hey, come on!

892
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,400
hey, come on!

893
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:34,900
sal, this is going to get
all over my coat.

894
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:22,400
[crack]

895
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,500
i want him alive!

896
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,500
hey! hey!

897
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,000
stop, for christ's sake!

898
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:14,500
son of a bitch.

899
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,000
would you please
help me in the car?

900
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,500
he shot my fucking foot!

901
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,000
oh, shit!

902
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,500
if you had just
left him to me,

903
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,500
i would have stopped him
before he fed.

904
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
now he's 100 times
more dangerous.

905
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,000
who did macelli eat?

906
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
some guy named manny.

907
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
an innocent person dead
because you screwed up!

908
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,600
manny bergman?

909
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,000
he wasn't innocent.
he's a lawyer.

910
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,500
maybe he's not dead.

911
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,000
maybe i have to
finish him, too.

912
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,500
or what?

913
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,500
he becomes like macelli
or becomes like you?

914
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
macelli's
nothing like me.

915
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,500
he's a cold-blooded
killer.

916
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
and what are you?

917
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,100
