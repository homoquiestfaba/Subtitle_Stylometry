0
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,239
Mm, these are good.

1
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,324
Mm-mm-mm.

2
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,325
Mm!

3
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,958
Mm.
Looks like Santa's

4
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,793
got a sweet tooth.

5
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,713
Did you pay for those beignets?

6
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,298
What are you,
the beignet police?

7
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,300
You know I didn't get that job.

8
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,513
Look, guys, let's
have fun today, okay?

9
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,099
If the kids wanna buy a picture,

10
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,976
it's okay, but don't push it.

11
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,728
You don't have to push
it down their throats.

12
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,355
Fun, fun, fun!

13
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,356
Fun, fun, fun!

14
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,692
What is our word?

15
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,695
Fun.

16
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:34,738
- What?
- Fun!

17
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,864
Fun.

18
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,743
See you out there.

19
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,161
Um, Santa Charles.

20
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,162
Wait!

21
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,210
Slow down, Santa, these are new!

22
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:51,963
Are you hiding?

23
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:52,963
Can you see me?

24
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,174
Is Jesus black?

25
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,550
Santa, go to the office.

26
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,593
Denise wants to see you.

27
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,594
She said, tell Santa Charles...

28
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,389
Tell Santa Charles what?

29
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,556
Santa, she wants to
see you in her office.

30
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,767
Shh, you didn't see me.

31
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,227
And that's not sexy.

32
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,437
This is sexy, and
you are hard to miss.

33
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,106
That's a fat joke.

34
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,357
You're a little plump.

35
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,400
- Mm-hm.
- Not a fat joke.

36
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,776
I'm not the only big guy here.

37
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,902
Thick is the new word.

38
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,986
- Yeah.
- Two C's.

39
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,613
What about Big D?

40
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,907
Big Douglas over here.

41
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,702
No one ever makes
fun of Big Douglas.

42
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,703
He's a security guard.

43
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,579
He's bigger than me.

44
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,456
- Not my ministry.
- Mm-hm.

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,208
Still making fun of big people.

46
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,670
We need to get together
a rally around big people.

47
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,880
Get us a flag.

48
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,881
A saying.

49
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,093
Yo, you bigger than everybody.

50
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,594
You go ahead and
knock him up, man.

51
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,679
Go and do what you need to do.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,848
I ain't bigger than you.

53
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,445
Santa Claus!

54
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
Whoa!

55
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,450
- For me?
- Yes, Sir.

56
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,619
Merry Christmas, everyone!

57
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,123
Who's been naughty
and who's been black?

58
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,167
Santa!

59
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,585
Hey!

60
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,712
Boo!

61
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,754
Who wants to talk to Santa?

62
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,506
Oh-oh!

63
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,924
Feliz Navidad!

64
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,301
Oh, moo!

65
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,635
Feliz Navidad, bueno!

66
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,263
- Bueno!
- Hey, hey!

67
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,848
Boom, Emily!

68
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,267
Let's get some music
going on around here.

69
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,811
Merry Christmas, everybody!

70
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,313
Let's get this party started.

71
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,523
Santa!

72
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,736
Merry Christmas.

73
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,987
Hi, Santa Charles!

74
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,697
- Hi, Janet.
- You know my name?

75
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,157
Name!

76
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:45,493
Last year you wanted
a detective outfit

77
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,077
with a magnifying glass.

78
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,996
The year before that,
you wanted Jeff's friends

79
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,373
and a unicorn.

80
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,667
What do you want this year?

81
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,962
I'll do my best.

82
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,714
Oh and, Santa, one more thing.

83
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,633
Yeah?

84
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:01,550
Do you need Jesus?

85
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,678
How about a picture with Santa?

86
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,473
Say Merry Christmas.

87
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,184
Merry Christmas!

88
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,939
I want a Ps5, zero
gravity laser race car.

89
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,357
It climbs walls.

90
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,067
And if you can't
fix the ozone layer,

91
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:20,402
even just a little bit,
that would be great.

92
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,695
And also- How about we

93
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:22,863
take this picture?

94
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,492
Say Christmas presents.

95
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,168
Incoming!

96
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,531
I thought you'd stop by my
office on one of your breaks.

97
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,449
Well, technically,
I'm still on break, I...

98
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,160
I heard about the incident.

99
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,583
The guy was 300 pounds.

100
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,876
I think he was 30.

101
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,044
We don't discriminate.

102
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,880
Hmm?
Discriminate?

103
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,257
I'm, you know, he's a big guy.

104
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,551
Why can't you be a team player?

105
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:29,221
- I am a team player.
- That's not a team player.

106
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,016
Most teams protect
their quarterback.

107
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,268
He was a paying customer.

108
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,769
Santa is his best friend.

109
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,438
Santa is his hero.

110
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,231
And all heroes should be
able to sell honey to a bee.

111
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,233
Heroes get the job done.

112
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,320
Did you know a hero
is also a sandwich?

113
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,447
I like mine with some relish.

114
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,908
Maybe some mayonnaise.

115
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,950
You had a quota to make.

116
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,453
- I like-
- You sell what?

117
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,330
Hm, any idea?

118
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,914
Hm?
Hm?

119
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,752
I've the numb, the, the,
I don't have the paper.

120
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,504
The numbers haven't came in.
The numbers came in.

121
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,757
We sold a couple hundred.
Whoa!

122
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,216
That's what I'm talking about.

123
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,926
No, that's not what
we're talking about.

124
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,345
Whoa!

125
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,597
- Keep it down, the kids.
- Up top.

126
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:12,931
Is that some kind
of record number?

127
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,725
No, that's a failure!

128
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,560
You sold a couple
hundred photos a day

129
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,189
and yet you spend hundreds of
hours with thousands of kids.

130
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,607
You ask them about their lives,

131
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,192
their lists, their favorites.

132
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:27,196
But you won't ask them
to take one stupid photo.

133
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,531
Kids want Santa
to listen to 'em.

134
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,158
You want their
tooth fairy money?

135
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:31,993
Yes!

136
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:33,369
Yes, yes, yes!

137
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,120
I want all of it,
Santa's bigger than

138
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,288
the tooth fairy.
Right!

139
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,706
Right.
Right?

140
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,460
Right, that's why he
doesn't need any money.

141
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:43,921
Yeah.

142
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,173
If I look like you, oh,

143
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:51,220
mm, I'd have them eating
out the palm of my hands.

144
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,263
Is that a fat joke?

145
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,140
Let me explain something to you.

146
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,227
I am Santa Legacy.
Hm.

147
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,145
Okay?

148
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:02,481
25 years, me in, okay?

149
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,234
My daddy was Santa Claus.

150
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,944
His daddy was Santa Claus.

151
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,904
His daddy, well, not his daddy.

152
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,240
Okay, your daddy
and your daddy's daddy

153
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,908
and your daddy's
daddy on top of that

154
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,076
don't pay these bills.

155
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,077
Do your job.

156
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,708
Well, maybe his daddy's
daddy was a Santa Mall,

157
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,710
not a mall 'cause they
didn't have malls.

158
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,795
I believe in you.

159
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,755
I believe in your bigness.

160
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,591
Huh?

161
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,761
Leave.

162
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,392
You get the point 'cause I've
been doing this a long time.

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Woo!

164
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,423
I'm getting too
old for this sled.

165
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,787
You know you can't
drown your problems

166
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,790
in snickerdoodle
and milk, right?

167
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,291
Thanks for letting
me stay here, Unc.

168
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,375
It's only temporary, man.

169
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,169
Just until I get
back on my feet.

170
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,047
You know, we don't
mind you staying here.

171
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,509
It's always a home,
but we got some rules.

172
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:58,514
First, no lips to carton.

173
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,557
That's direct contact.

174
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,892
Don't do that.

175
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:02,727
Don't let your aunt
see you do that.

176
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,270
But we're family.

177
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,524
That means that's your milk now.

178
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,109
Yeah, 'cause this is what

179
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,278
you use around here.

180
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,323
No, it's too late,
it's too late.

181
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,658
I thought you wanted some.

182
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,202
No, why would,
with lips to carton!

183
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,663
It's not in the carton no more.

184
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,249
But your lips, son.

185
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,334
Your lips, huh?

186
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,461
All right.

187
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,257
And the cookie situation here.

188
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,805
We want you to be comfortable.

189
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,098
You know you can stay
with me and your aunt

190
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,059
anytime you want, okay?

191
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,187
But we gonna have to
ration out these cookies.

192
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,480
Aunt Carol
said I could have some.

193
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,982
She said one.

194
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,442
You don't have to eat
nine at one time, son.

195
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,321
You can have a cookie
every once in a while.

196
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,658
You look like Rick Ross
if he like cookies.

197
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,369
There's the smile
I was looking for.

198
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,414
That's the guy I'm looking
for right there, man.

199
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,748
Listen, everything's
gonna be all right.

200
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,168
You're gonna get
you a new apartment.

201
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,919
I just wish I could
commit to something.

202
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,089
I just can't commit to
anything these days, man.

203
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,674
Well, you know what,

204
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,553
you should just start out
by committing to this,

205
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,471
a glass.

206
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,099
Now that's your milk.

207
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,601
Your lips have been on it.

208
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,728
And that's your glass.

209
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,025
Are you full on cookies?

210
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,196
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

211
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,947
I wish Charlie
Wilson was my uncle.

212
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,324
What's that, what did you say?

213
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,159
What did you say?
Nothing, nothing.

214
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,534
Huh?

215
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,869
Leave me alone,
Uncle Charles, man.

216
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,579
I call Goofy and Gaffy elf

217
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,041

What happened?

234
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,854
Who shot Rudolph?

235
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,650
Santa Charles?

236
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:40,320
My office.

237
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,910
It's not gonna
be a good morning.

238
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,759
Please have a seat.

239
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,344
I told you once,
I told you twice,

240
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,514
I'm not gonna retire
till I'm in the dirt.

241
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,224
You're resilient
and I appreciate that.

242
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,809
But I have a business to run,

243
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,355
a new, updated, modern
Santa experience business.

244
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,316
Your contract is up at
the end of the season.

245
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,194
So I'm not asking you
anymore, I'm telling you.

246
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,195
Denise.

247
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,447
I've decided not to renew.

248
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,823
Denise.

249
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,076
Slow down.

250
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:29,911
I thought you would
like retirement.

251
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,161
Come on, no!

252
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,204
Are you kidding me?

253
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,830
Oh no, I guess you wouldn't.

254
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,542
But Patrick, Patrick, he
comes highly recommended.

255
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,503
Patrick?

256
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,795
Mm-hm.

257
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:43,381
A white Santa in a black mall.

258
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,175
Are you, it would be
chaos around here.

259
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,551
- I-
- It would be, oh!

260
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,637
Did you see the
"White Bikini Wives"?

261
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,722
I did, but that has
nothing to do with this.

262
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,518
If you hired the
ghost of Christmas past,

263
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,603
these people will
lose their minds.

264
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:00,857
It's like playing Paul
Anchor at a family reunion.

265
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,234
- Okay.
- You can't do that.

266
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,277
- I don't see why.
- You need the old days.

267
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,113
Well, the kids will love him.

268
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,115
It's good enough, and
apparently he loves

269
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:09,449
having his photo taken.

270
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,867
You know, I like
my Santas amenable.

271
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,953
- Amenable?
- Amenable.

272
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,454
Bottom line, it works.

273
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,248
He works, it works.

274
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,542
You can't... listen to me.

275
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,629
This has been a black
Santa Mall since 1948.

276
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,467
My grandfather sat a little
white child right here smiling

277
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,844
and people took a picture.

278
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,054
Nobody said nothing.

279
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,390
That's my legacy.

280
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:34,724
That's who I am.

281
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,102
- Look.
- We break down barriers.

282
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,271
I can appreciate that.

283
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,981
I can appreciate that.

284
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,525
I know this is some kind of
tradition for your family.

285
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,193
You've broken all kind
of barriers, I get that,

286
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,611
but I'm doing you a favor.

287
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,238
- What!
- This is a physically

288
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,574
demanding job, and I can see.

289
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,201
Woo-woo, well, say it, say it!

290
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,661
Say fat!

291
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,329
I didn't say anything about fat.

292
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,623
- You was about to say fat.
- I was gonna say tired.

293
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,666
- Say it.
- You're tired.

294
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,709
- Ah.
- You're tired.

295
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,419
- Ah.
- You're tired.

296
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
And if you had any kids of
your own to pass the baton.

297
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,838
Look, I've made my decision.

298
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,881
I'm running up the
flag pole, it's done.

299
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,217
You said tired instead of fat.

300
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,385
Nobody digs your music

301
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,012
but you.
You are affected.

302
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,097
Santa Charles, you need
to write in your journal

303
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,140
or take that up
with your therapist.

304
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,933
I'm telling you what I need.

305
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:20,395
My bottom line is suffering
because of your incompetence.

306
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,646
Now, here's the deal.

307
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,690
After this season, you're done.

308
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,109
No, no, no.

309
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,198
We're getting

310
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,033
I just need some time.
No.

311
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,367
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No, absolutely not.

312
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,869
No, no, no, listen to me.

313
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,329
Hear me out.

314
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,166
Let me find my own replacement.

315
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,381
Groomed the way you like it.

316
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,967
- You're funny.
- No, no.

317
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,427
You picked the wrong profession.

318
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,028
You probably should
have been a comedian.

319
00:16:55,389 --> 00:17:00,269
I groom a hand-down, I teach,

320
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,942
but it's with your rules.

321
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:12,614
Let me go out with some
dignity and then I'll retire.

322
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,324
Is that a promise?

323
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,159
Yes.

324
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,451
You told me Santas

325
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,288
don't make promises.
They do now.

326
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,165
All right.

327
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,211
Tell you what, you have
until the end of the season

328
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,257
to find me the best
Santa for the job.

329
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,677
Game on.

330
00:17:32,678 --> 00:17:34,135
Well, let's shake on it.

331
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,054
Let's not shake on it.

332
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,099
Let's remember this moment.

333
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,725
Okay.

334
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:42,727
You're a good friend.

335
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,063
Okay, go.

336
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,148
Have you ever heard
of the heat miser?

337
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,609
You kind of look like her.

338
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,238
Thank you.

339
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,781
Thank you.
No, thank you.

340
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,074
- Thank you.
- I'm not gonna let you down.

341
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,326
- Got it.
- Okay?

342
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,331
Keep it heavy.
Understood, great.

343
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,879
Hey, the name is Orlando.

344
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,258
And next time you're in this
mall, just ask for me, baby.

345
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,885
You'll never wait in line again.

346
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,596
I'm telling my dad.

347
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,098
I'm telling my dad too.

348
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,018
Kids.

349
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:24,019
Great.

350
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,609
Merry Christmas, Ju.

351
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,611
What's wrong?

352
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:33,738
What's wrong?

353
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,615
Oh!

354
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,242
First time in a black mall.

355
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,996
I know how you feel.

356
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:47,501
Barbecue smell,
greens, cornbread.

357
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,340
I know what you
want for Christmas.

358
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,009
You wanna be able to do this.

359
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,388
Back at you, Ju.

360
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,641
What do you want this year?

361
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,642
A turtle.

362
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:25,373
You're getting too
old for the sled.

363
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:44,558
Ah, seriously.

364
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,519
Ah!

365
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,439
Ugly Christmas sweaters.

366
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,193
Ha-ha-ha, this is my design.

367
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,071
Sites like these steal
indie ideas all the time.

368
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,908
Make a few changes and resell
the imitations as their own.

369
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
You're really leaving, huh?

370
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,580
Not if I can help it.

371
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,750
You're really good at this.

372
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,548
I feel you, and
I'm a 100% on board.

373
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:17,882
Gimme the details.

374
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,301
What's your target demo,
level of experience,

375
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,720
personality type?

376
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,222
Mm-hm!

377
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,182
Through datish.

378
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,059
But you know.
Okay.

379
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,061
Do you want me to put
a competitive salary?

380
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,731
Ooh, can grow a beard naturally.

381
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,983
You get a bit aggressive.

382
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,319
Be aggressive, be aggressive.

383
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,280
Should I set the
parameters to worldwide?

384
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,449
Ooh!

385
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,493
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

386
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,163
Okay, what else do you want?

387
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,831
- Video.
- Oh, I'm good at videos.

388
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,710
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

389
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,754
Anything else?

390
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:00,800
Those yellow things
with expressions.

391
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,802
Oh, smiley face.

392
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,804
- Emojis.
- Ah!

393
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,224
We just got black
Santas last year.

394
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,602
Really?

395
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,645
Whoa, lit!

396
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,731
We lit, we lit!

397
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,983
Period, purr!

398
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,610
- Purr!
- Purr.

399
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,612
- Purr.
- Yes.

400
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,322
Knock, knock.

401
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,199
I'm saying, never mind.

402
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,992
Different era.

403
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,993
Purr!

404
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,721
Charles.

405
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,640
Mm?

406
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:48,807
Mm?

407
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,683
I'm not asleep.

408
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,102
I'm just reading my eyelids.

409
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,188
- Right.
- Mm.

410
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,566
Ooh, uh-oh.

411
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:00,486
Somebody wants something.

412
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,904
Mm?

413
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,198
Who me?

414
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,910
I know when you get all
squirrly and touchy like this,

415
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,330
you want to say something
or you want something.

416
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,583
Mm-hm, you all right?

417
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,463
I can't figure out what
to do and what should I do?

418
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,007
You've been putting
it off for a long time

419
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,010
and we both knew this
day would come, right?

420
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,346
- Mm-hm.
- But I think retirement

421
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,515
is going to be good
for both of us.

422
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,141
- Retirement?
- Yeah.

423
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,893
I mean, think about it.

424
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,564
Now, we get to stop putting
off that trip to Edinburgh.

425
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,357
- Edinburgh.
- Come on, it's been years

426
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,441
we've been talking about it.

427
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,402
- Edinburgh?
- Yes!

428
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,652
Are you saying it right?

429
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:43,736
I'm saying it right.

430
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,115
- Edinburgh.
- E-D-I-N.

431
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,033
S-A-N-T-A-I-N.
Are you trying

432
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:49,994
to say Eaglewood?
No baby, no.

433
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,411
What Edinburgh?

434
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,413
- Edinburgh, we do, baby.
- No, no, no.

435
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,206
Black people.
Yeah, we're black.

436
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,542
Mm-hm, we'll be there.

437
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,669
- Why go to Edinburgh?
- Do something

438
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,005
different, honey.

439
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,673
Let's go to Alabama too.

440
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:07,886
Mm, awwh, but I wanna see the
Christmas markets, big papa.

441
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,722
But that's why they
have the internet.

442
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,558
In person and on Christmas.

443
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,767
Edinburgh?

444
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,768
Yes.

445
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,521
My God, you can't hate me

446
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,899
because I'm not
being Santa Claus.

447
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,192
I mean, I'm doing
my due diligence.

448
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,111
Baby, you can sit
in this chair all day

449
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,656
and all night doing
your due diligence.

450
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,366
Well, look, if we not
gonna go to Edinburgh,

451
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,452
can you do me a favor?

452
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:37,290
Just go talk to Clarence, hmm?

453
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:41,002
Listen, the boy's went
through a rough patch.

454
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,837
He don't even like Christmas.

455
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,673
He's not a holiday person.

456
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,343
You're right, all right,
but look, he needs purpose.

457
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,719
Hmm.

458
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,057
And you just might be
able to change his mind.

459
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,516
See, there he go.

460
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,101
I know you was up to something.

461
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,396
Oh, I'm always up to
something, big Papa Santa.

462
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,315
Um.

463
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,649
Mm, come on.

464
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,275
You tricked me again.

465
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,276
Oh, yes.

466
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,492
Well, you better, you
better give me some purpose.

467
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,286
Talk to Clarence, baby.

468
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,414
Mm-hm.

469
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:22,503
In case you forget,
his room is right here.

470
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,464
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

471
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,177
Hey, Unc, what's up?

472
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,554
I know this is a dumb question,
but are you busy tomorrow?

473
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,516
No, man, I'm just trying to
piece my life back together.

474
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:38,184
Yeah.

475
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,770
Why don't you take a break
and come with me to work?

476
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,231
You done with interviews?

477
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,983
Yeah, nobody wants this job.

478
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,567
I'll be doing this
till I'm dead.

479
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,861
Oh man, Uncle Charles,
you ain't gonna die.

480
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,531
You gonna live forever
like the Rio Center.

481
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,908
That's what I thought.

482
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,951
But I think you should
come to work with me.

483
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,536
The kids will cheer you up, man.

484
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:57,537
They enjoy it too.

485
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,875
Okay, okay, I'll go, whatever.

486
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,960
- Yeah.
- Take a shower.

487
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,003
Yeah.

488
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,462
But I'm not wearing a costume.

489
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,172
It's not a costume.

490
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,051
It's a uniform and
you're not that cool.

491
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,178
It's a costume.

492
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,223
The snickerdoodle
cookies are disgusting.

493
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,896
Ooh, Holy North Pole.

494
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,948
The IRS will never catch me.

495
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,920
Time for more video.

496
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:53,093
Hmm.

497
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:05,730
What the?

498
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,731
Oh my God.

499
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,108
Oh my God.

500
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,110
Hello, my love.

501
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,695
Oh, my little vanities.

502
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,072
I'm Vaingirl 21.

503
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,239
Thank you for logging in.

504
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,158
No!

505
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,076
Not Vaingirl 21.

506
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,495
But y'all, my friends
sent me this video earlier

507
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,621
and I was cracking up.

508
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,039
You have to see this.

509
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,582
This is Santa Charles
for the ultimate-

510
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,167
- I'm so fired.

511
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,460
- I've never heard of the-
- How am I gonna afford

512
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,837
my clothes?
This had me rolling.

513
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,838
Look at him.

514
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,674
Why is that kid
doing that to him?

515
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,426
He started doing this
crazy dance like this.

516
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,803
He was doing
this little roll with it.

517
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,429
I don't know about that.

518
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,264
We're gonna have to like,
make it a little cuter.

519
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,974
Ooh, I like that, okay.

520
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,768
Come on, Vaingirl 21.

521
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,436
We're gonna make
this into a hashtag.

522
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,064
Mall santa hashtag
Ultimate Santa Challenge.

523
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,066
Oh, hashtag Ultimate
Santa Challenge!

524
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,442
You guys wanna do it with me?

525
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,860
And we gonna roll it

526
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,154
and we gonna do the
Santa belly with it.

527
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,656
I'm so fired.

528
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,740
Okay y'all, so make
sure you do the dance

529
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,325

530
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,743
And when they're picking
the next mall Santa,

531
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,120
we gotta show up.

532
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:02,996
- Oh, no, no, no!
- Does anyone wanna

533
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,831
do a meetup with me?

534
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,164
Okay, thanks.

535
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:05,999
So I'll let you guys-
Oh my gosh.

536
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,126
Not Vaingirl 21!

537
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,127
Oh God.

538
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,338
Breathe, Terrell.

539
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,339
Woo-sah!

- Rastafari!

566
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,706
Emma, right?

567
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,166
Yeah.

568
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,209
Is there anyone that
can help us out here?

569
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,585
We just wanna sign up, Emma.

570
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,087
I mean, I've been here
with Joseph and Charles

571
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,130
and Kiki and Dashaun.

572
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,924
Yeah, Denise, can you?

573
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,218
You must be in charge, Denise.

574
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,220
Elizabeth will take
great care of you, okay.

575
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,889
It's Emma, why does everyone
keep calling me, okay.

576
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,890
- Miss Denise.
- Um, okay.

577
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,021
Um, guys, uh, no, Santa
Charles will be here soon

578
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,732
and you guys can
just talk to him.

579
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,025
What in the?

580
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,278
Orlando!

581
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,446
We are upon a red light security

582
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,073
for this crowd out here, right?

583
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,450
I could use an extra pair
of hands and a barricade

584
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,785
and a small tank.

585
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,995
We're not under siege.

586
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:49,996
Not yet.

587
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,749
You got pepper spray?

588
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,459
- Mm-hm.
- Okay, good, good, good.

589
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,797
Use it if you have to,
but only if you have to.

590
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,340
And never on the kids.

591
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,135
No, no, no, that's a
lawsuit waiting to happen.

592
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,345
Copy that, Big D.

593
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:08,807
Don't call me that.

594
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,351
Ooh, you're right.

595
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,146
Inappropriate.
Very!

596
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,028
♪ Merry Christmas
and Happy New Year ♪

597
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,029
Wow!

598
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,822
How amazing!

599
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:28,326
Terrell, why are you bumping
around like some lost duck?

600
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,537
The post went viral.

601
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:36,167
Apparently, we were too
aggressive, too too aggressive.

602
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,502
It was picked up
by at Vaingirl 21.

603
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,629
She has over 20 million
followers on Vid Feed.

604
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,841
Way more than Diamond Dave.

605
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,259
Oh my God.

606
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,469
Yeah?

607
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,429
Diamond Dave.

608
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,015
Yeah, yeah, when posting.

609
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,603
People are getting sick all
the time when they go viral.

610
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,315
I forgot to refresh the page.

611
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,025
I know.

612
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,736
Yeah, we'll refresh it later.

613
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,489
We'll refresh the page
later and call Diamond

614
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,532
and get the disease handled.

615
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,409
I'm so fired.

616
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,497
No, not, it's 'cause
you've got the people viral

617
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:20,461
and the people, the
fresh, the viral page.

618
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,213
What is he talking about?

619
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,758
Unc, going viral means basically

620
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,510
the whole world seen it.

621
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,804
What?

622
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,030
Before you say anything,
let me explain.

623
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,907
- Please do.
- It's gonna be the one

624
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,743
because I think I
should be the one.

625
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,328
Explain.

626
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,790
Um.

627
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,250
We did what you asked
and we went wide, woo!

628
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,210
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hm.

629
00:32:01,211 --> 00:32:03,045
- Uh-huh.
- Even went viral.

630
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,089
Is that why it looks
like a Santa convention

631
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,007
exploded outside of my mall.

632
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,384
Maybe we went too wide?

633
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,052
- Yeah.
- We can make an announcement

634
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,472
over the intercom and send
the store Santas packing.

635
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,058
No, no, no, no, no.

636
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,351
This is good.

637
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,937
This is exactly what we needed.

638
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,272
Hmm?

639
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,690
There's a lot of
Santas out there.

640
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,692
We're bound to find
someone we both like

641
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,610
and can move forward with.

642
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,863
Hmm.

643
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,573
Well.

644
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:30,698
But those aren't

645
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:31,699
real Santas.
Yeah.

646
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,993
They're viral.

647
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,786
- He learned that word.
- They didn't refresh.

648
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,788
Right?

649
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,207
I'm keeping an open
mind, Santa Charles.

650
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,459
Are you?

651
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,255
Yeah, but I'm just saying
that they're viral Santas.

652
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,716
Okay, so what's the
plan for the interviews?

653
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,384
There's a lot of folks out there

654
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,261
and, from the looks of them,
they'll be competitive.

655
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:53,180
That sounds cutthroat.

656
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,181
Oh, I know, I know.

657
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,975
Something, something's
in the air.

658
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,145
I imagine a bunch of Santas
trying to ruin each other

659
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:05,482
for likes and for a chance of
the coveted Santa Mall job.

660
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,193
Mm, it's definitely not
covered by insurance.

661
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,736
It could be a multi-day task.

662
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,863
And we could hold interviews
in the parking lot

663
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,448
and I could start a signup sheet

664
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,574
to get an accurate head count.

665
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,367
Hey!

666
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,368
Okay?

667
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,208
- I got it.
- What?

668
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,667
Judge.

669
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,338
What did you say?

670
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,050
You wanted a Santa Claus
that would be what?

671
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,344
Ame...
Amenable.

672
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,386
Yes!

673
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,013
I couldn't remember that word,

674
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:41,185
but listen, we have a challenge.

675
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,729
They have to be up for the par.

676
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:50,736
They have to do
things, obstacles,

677
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,990
and flippedy-flip
and whippedy-whip.

678
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,622
That's what we call the
amenable Santa challenge!

679
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,753
Okay, so, so what
are you thinking?

680
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,883
That's all I got.

681
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,529
Werk!

682
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,447
Oh, oww!

683
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,993
Who falls asleep in a sauna?

684
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,955
What you want, man?

685
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,249
How did you find a sauna?

686
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,376
I found one.

687
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,962
Follow me.

688
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,548
Where are we going?

689
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:54,134
Less talking, more walking boy.

690
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,668
You didn't find a gym, did you?

691
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:14,028
What are you doing?

692
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,989
- Shh!
- Man, you acting weird.

693
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,407
What is this?

694
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,159
Some kind of Santa
experience initiation

695
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,661
where you teach me how to
duck cookies effectively?

696
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,624
Listen, I'm not
supposed to do this,

697
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,503
but I want you to
be Santa Claus.

698
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:37,594
Only problem with that is
I don't want to be Santa.

699
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,764
Man, I just came to spend some
time with my favorite uncle.

700
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:42,974
Very interesting word.

701
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,685
Time.

702
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:50,731
I'll say you spent a
lot of time in prison.

703
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:51,732
Here we go.

704
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,070
Your PO's not playing.

705
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,697
He's very serious.

706
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,117
If you become Santa and
allow him to see you

707
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:06,038
in a different light,
you understand that,

708
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:07,122
you're helping children.

709
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,916
I saw how children see you,

710
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,336
when they see you,
their faces light up.

711
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,672
There's something
about this suit

712
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:18,677
once you put it on, it
kind of erases your past.

713
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,054
You become something new.

714
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,473
You have a purpose.

715
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,725
Uncle Charles?

716
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,726
No.

717
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:35,651
You think you're
the only criminal

718
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,737
in the family, don't you?

719
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
No.

720
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,498
Let me show you something.

721
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,045
See that?

722
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,133
That's my father,
your grandfather,

723
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:02,511
and his father, my grandfather.

724
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,055
Do you know what my
grandfather did for a living?

725
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,267
He was a bootlegger
from Chicago.

726
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,936
They called him Big Draws.

727
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,772
Do you know what they
called your grandfather?

728
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,691
What?

729
00:37:14,692 --> 00:37:16,567
Poon Daddy.

730
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:17,944
He was a con artist.

731
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,198
We all had a past.

732
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,242
They put on a suit
and erased their past.

733
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,244
They started giving.

734
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,205
I even have a past.

735
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,708
I used to be a gymnast.

736
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,169
Now that's criminal.

737
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,964
Especially if saw
me in them tights.

738
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,261
My point is, put on a suit,

739
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,681
it gives you a purpose.

740
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,433
You got it.

741
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,437
Uncle Charles, I
don't want to be Santa.

742
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,065
As a kid, this is all
you ever wanted to do.

743
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:00,152
I was eight.

744
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,488
Of course, I thought this was
the coolest job in the world.

745
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,698
You're a fat man in
a red velvet suit

746
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,201
and nobody judges you.

747
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,497
But then I grew up and I
realized that all you do

748
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:14,291
is pedal dreams and
wishes to little kids.

749
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,959
It's not real.

750
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,670
None of this is real.

751
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,970
That's what you think I am?

752
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,807
Fat man in a red suit.

753
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,853
This is real.

754
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,605
You're real!

755
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,191
Uncle Charles, there's a
thousand other guys out there

756
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,151
that like to play
dress-up just like you.

757
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,195
You don't need me.

758
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,780
But they're not real!

759
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,198
And they're not you.

760
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:48,909
They're from Instatake.

761
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,910
Face.

762
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,788
The thing with the bird.

763
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,789
Instaface, Unc.

764
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,499
You know what I'm saying?

765
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,419
They're insta, influencers, man.

766
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,296
I love you.

767
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,382
But you gotta understand
that not everybody

768
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,467
gets what they
want for Christmas.

769
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,220
You of all people
should know that.

770
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,013
I do.

771
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,224
That's not what you get.

772
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,475
It's what you give.

773
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,020
Whatever man.

774
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,690
I got bigger fish to fry and
bigger problems to solve.

775
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,233
So I'm gonna find
me something to eat.

776
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:23,152
And I guess I'll
find my own way home.

777
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,406
Now when you say you gonna
find your own way home,

778
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,992
do that mean you're
gonna steal a car?

779
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:30,993
No.

780
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,123
Where'd you get that robe from?

781
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,559
Hey.

782
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,103
I think I'm lost.

783
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,897
Okay.

784
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,108
And where are your parents?

785
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,653
I don't know.

786
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,489
They're probably worried.

787
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,825
Where's your family?

788
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,459
Santa Charles is your daddy?

789
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Uncle.

790
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,380
Mom and dad are gone.

791
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,925
You are so lucky!

792
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,470
I wish I had an uncle Santa.

793
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,391
I guess he's not so bad.

794
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,518
Gosh, there you are.

795
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,687
I was so worried.

796
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,606
Thank you.

797
00:40:41,607 --> 00:40:42,648
No problem.

798
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:43,650
Come on, let's go.

799
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:22,896
We're live, action!

800
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,815
Are you Santas
ready for a challenge?

801
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,900
Yeah!

802
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,028
I said, are you Santas
ready for a challenge?

803
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,196
Yeah!

804
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,864
The Ultimate Santa Challenge.

805
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,533
Yeah!

806
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,326
I'm your host, DJ Snowbiz.

807
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,705
And this store is
your playground.

808
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:41,540
We also have souvenirs.

809
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,583
We have hats, shot glasses,

810
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:47,212
snow boats, novelty towels,
T-shirts, miniatures,

811
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,799
and various water packages
available for purchase, okay?

812
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,218
There will be three
days of Santa Games.

813
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,720
And at the end of the game,

814
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:57,556
we'll crown our next mall Santa.

815
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,142
But you don't have to take

816
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,310
my word for it because
Santa Charles is here

817
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,354
to let you know that
he's been making a list

818
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,939
and checking it twice.

819
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,399
And at the end of the games,

820
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,819
he will decide whose
been naughty or nice.

821
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,576
Ah, first of all, I'd
like to thank you guys

822
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,038
and welcome you
to the Santa Games.

823
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,665
This is not a job.

824
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,666
Hm?

825
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,796
It's an honor and a privilege.

826
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,258
This is not a suit or a costume.

827
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,259
It's a uniform.

828
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,721
I'm proud to wear it.

829
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,849
Some of you guys know this,
some of you guys don't.

830
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,310
A part of a legacy here,

831
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,438
three decades sitting in
that chair right there.

832
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:49,858
A grandfather, a father.

833
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,779
But this is not about
being a mall Santa.

834
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:58,617
It's about listening and love.

835
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:02,454
Love for the job,
love for the people,

836
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:05,207
love for the community.

837
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:09,962
I remember you, Stacey
Howard, wanted a firetruck.

838
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,468
Kids, they don't get
everything they want,

839
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:21,014
but they do get to
see a Santa Claus

840
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,016
that looks like them.

841
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,017
Hmm?

842
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:30,858
So welcome to the first
annual Santa Games.

843
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,071
Come on, Santa!

844
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:37,323
Come on, Santa!

845
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,862
Can I help you?

846
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,196
It's not what it looks like.

847
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,408
Mm, looks like you're
stealing from Santa.

848
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,536
What are you doing then?

849
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:28,540
Borrowing from Santa,
without his permission.

850
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,333
You lose a bet or something?

851
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,751
Worse.

852
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,962
I think I just found
my Christmas spirit.

853
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,088
In the storage closet?

854
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,549
Is that where I left it?

855
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,721
Oh, you know, I never
could find the hats

856
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:46,600
in the midst of all
that other stuff.

857
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:47,602
See here.

858
00:44:51,189 --> 00:44:53,440
Your uncle is going
to be so pleased.

859
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,942
Please, don't
tell Uncle Charles.

860
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,943
Okay.

861
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,488
I want to do this on my own.

862
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,575
If it's in my blood,
my family legacy,

863
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,203
then it's meant to be.

864
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,789
But if not,
and I fail at this too,

865
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,903
then at least Uncle Charles
won't have to get his hopes up.

866
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,670
All right, I won't say a word.

867
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:16,713
Okay?

868
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,300
But I do think he's gonna know.

869
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,427
I just have a feeling.

870
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,470
He'll know.

871
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,684
Can you help me with this beard?

872
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,103
I thought you'd never ask.

873
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,274
All right.

874
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,610
Let's see, oh yeah, first
you gotta take this net off.

875
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:40,278
Put your head down.

876
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,696
Mm-hm.

877
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,031
Awwh.

878
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,533
Behind those ears.

879
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,409
Yup.

880
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,869
Hold on.

881
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,788
Can you breathe?

882
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:49,955
Just.

883
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:50,956
Ho-ho-ho.

884
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:55,544
So proud of you.

885
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:01,592
Next.

886
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,767
Next.

887
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,314
So, I'm, I'm really
sorry about that.

888
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,942
Thank you.
Thanks.

889
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:24,407
All right, first and
last name, Santa.

890
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,783
Thank you.

891
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:45,011
Tell us your name.

892
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:46,053
My name is Stephanie.

893
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,763
Wah gwan, me name Wayne.

894
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:52,100
You know, straight
from Jamaica, boi-boi!

895
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,352
Hi, I'm Adam.

896
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,230
Hi, my name is Clyde.

897
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,527
My name is Nick.

898
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,530
And Nick, why do
you want to be Santa Claus?

899
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,781
Wait, wait, hold on.

900
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,158
Who are you?

901
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,702
Who are you to be
asking me questions

902
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:13,121
or what was, what's
happening right now?

903
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,789
Me want to be Santa Clause

904
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,709
and I'm come here to show Santa
can be everywhere, yuh know.

905
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,336
I'm here for one reason.

906
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,754
Total world domination.

907
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,839
Did it, and now
he's on the elf team.

908
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,591
Oh, oh, mum, mum, mum!

909
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:26,051
Come on, our boy is on TV!

910
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,635
Come fast, fast, fast, fast!

911
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,263
So, basically.

912
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,771
Welcome to day one
of the Santa Creators.

913
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,574
All right, and we're back
with what looks like hampers

914
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:54,287
of Santa's dirty laundry.

915
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,123
I wonder what we're
gonna do with that?

916
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,375
Can't hear you.

917
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:02,879
But if you guessed wash
and fold, you're wrong.

918
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,925
This game is called
Santa's Pajamas.

919
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,431
When I count to three,
you'll race to the hampers

920
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,392
and grab a matching pajama set.

921
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:19,188
We have elf,
gingerbread and snowman.

922
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,232
Options are limited.

923
00:48:21,233 --> 00:48:22,942
So choose wisely.

924
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,276
And go!

925
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,452
Oh wow.

926
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,957
Illegal contact!

927
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,000
There's no fighting
in the North Pole.

928
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,129
We have jammies for everybody.

929
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,476
Oh shirt!

930
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,648
Try out?

931
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,816
Try out?

932
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:05,900
What?
You don't think

933
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,610
there's a need to try out?

934
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,696
I don't think there's
a need to try out

935
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,906
when you find what it is
that you're looking for

936
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,741
and it's sitting in the chair.

937
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,245
I am a fat man in this hot...

938
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:20,457
How does he do this?

939
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:24,294
Oh, Santa Charles.

940
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,795
I know of him.

941
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,131
Right, what do you know
of Santa Charles?

942
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,799
Cool dude.

943
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,096
Now it's time for the one,
the only, Santa Charles.

944
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,358
Good afternoon, Santas.

945
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,196
Please try to separate in
the most scientifical ways.

946
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,655
Gingerbread to the left.

947
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,574
Elves in the middle.

948
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,366
Snowmen to the right.

949
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,410
The losing team
will, unfortunately,

950
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,204
be kicked out of the games.

951
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:02,082
If you don't have a
costume on, bye-bye.

952
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:09,882
Oh, can I tell them
Designs by Terrell?

953
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,010
Designs by Terrell.

954
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,846
Take a picture, it's
gonna last longer, mm-hm.

955
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:21,727
And, again, if you don't
have a costume, off you go.

956
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,609
Listen, you guys
all did a good job.

957
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,444
See you day two.

958
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,197
Good night, have
a good night, guys.

959
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,368
We'll see you back here bright

960
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,746
and early tomorrow
morning for day two.

961
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,270
Thank you.

962
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,273
Got the pizza guys.
Oh.

963
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,651
Look who I found
roaming the halls

964
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,444
like a lost little puppy.

965
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,656
And look, he doesn't
have his beard on.

966
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,616
Hi!

967
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,909
Hey, I hope you don't mind,

968
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,786
we couldn't decide
on what topping to get.

969
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,163
So we just got cheese.

970
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,957
Yeah, and they got fruit punch,

971
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:28,876
ginger ale, energy
drinks and water.

972
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,920
Or if you're feeling brave,

973
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,214
I make a mean protein shake.

974
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,510
I'm nicknaming Santa's
Ultimate Challenge.

975
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,178
I don't think I
have any competition,

976
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,555
but to be honest with you,

977
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,432
there's one particular
one on my team.

978
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,142
Are they gonna hear this?

979
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:45,643
Okay, cool.

980
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,770
So there's one particular
Santa on my team.

981
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,771
Nick.

982
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,315
Buff daddy, Big Santa.

983
00:51:50,316 --> 00:51:53,568
He's just always angry
and wants to hit people.

984
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,111
The 'Roid Ranger.

985
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,946
I think it might be something
in his protein shakes.

986
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,781
I think he taken
some of the ting.

987
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,074
He needs to slow it down.

988
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,117
It's not healthy
for your man beat.

989
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,118
You know what I'm saying?

990
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,411
But then some of the other ones,

991
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,496
you know, they all
right, you know.

992
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,290
Day one done.

993
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,125
Yeah, you know, we started
off a little rocky, you know.

994
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,168
But you know what, mate?

995
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:13,338
We got it done, we edged it out.

996
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,632
You know what, I think
day two's gonna be a doozy.

997
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,301
I mean everything that
went through with the PJs,

998
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,844
but you two look
a little intense.

999
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,804
This man.

1000
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:22,388
Are you scared?

1001
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,431
No, but you should be.

1002
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,432
Ooh.

1003
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,353
I'm just glad I found a
shirt that could fit me.

1004
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:31,564
I actually found the
shirt, and you're welcome.

1005
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,191
Yeah.

1006
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,068
You know what, it
was a little crazy.

1007
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,819
You guys think the
rest of the challenges

1008
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,529
are gonna be like that?

1009
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,240
Nah, man, me don't think so.

1010
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,284
I really just
wanna say something.

1011
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:47,289
I'm just so happy to be
here with all of you.

1012
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,874
Back home in London,

1013
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,919
you know, I don't
have a lot of friends.

1014
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:55,755
You know, with that sweater,
I mean, yeah, I see why.

1015
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:57,298
Look, I'm just here
to make a statement.

1016
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,675
And what's that?

1017
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:01,427
That women can be Santa too.

1018
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:04,722
Now, I'm here because I
wanna be the next Santa,

1019
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,142
the first and one and
only female Santa.

1020
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,813
While we're at it,
Clyde, now I know

1021
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,399
you're to compete as
well, but we all know

1022
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,068
there's something hiding
underneath that Santa beard.

1023
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,445
Ho-ho-ho, I'm Santa.

1024
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,908
All right.

1025
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,911
Well, it's obvious that you
don't want to be here, I mean.

1026
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,037
Me, I love Christmas.

1027
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,289
I love all of it, you know.

1028
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,582
I love Christmas.

1029
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,583
I love everything
about Christmas.

1030
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,877
The decorations, trees, music.

1031
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:36,379
I even love the cold air.

1032
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,881
Me wanna show the
world that Christmas,

1033
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,509
it be universal, you know.

1034
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,597
I just want the gig period.

1035
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,099
Yeah, he wish.

1036
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,559
Okay, well, I already
told you why I'm here.

1037
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,353
Clyde, so what's up?

1038
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:55,815
Well, I guess I just want
something to believe in.

1039
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,985
You know, it's something
I always wanted.

1040
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,319
Mm.

1041
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,657
Awh, Clyde, you're
a serious dude.

1042
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,698
Okay, you hit me one more
time, whey you want, eh?

1043
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:10,496
Oh, hey look,
everyone, grab a pub.

1044
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,956
All right.
Sorry.

1045
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,417
Everybody, cheers.

1046
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,710
All right.

1047
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:18,212
To all of us.

1048
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:22,091
May our journey be
worth it, but tough.

1049
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:26,053
And as Team ELf, may
we be indestructible.

1050
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,930
- Yeah.
- And all those other Santas,

1051
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,057
you know, they don't
know what's coming.

1052
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,309
- We are!
- We are coming.

1053
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,519
- We're coming!
- Yeah!

1054
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,314
- Yeah, man.
- Coming, all right.

1055
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:37,441
Let's come.

1056
00:54:52,164 --> 00:54:54,624
Oh! Charles!

1057
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,543
Mm, it's just after 11.

1058
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,212
Come on, what are you doing?

1059
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,172
You gotta gimme a minute
to do some research.

1060
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,215
Research on what?

1061
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:03,299
To go and look in the cookie jar

1062
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,718
and eat up all the cookies?

1063
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,304
Okay, I mean, it may look like

1064
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,014
I'm just eating the cookies,

1065
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,557
but I'm doing research
for the games tomorrow.

1066
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,351
I gotta know this stuff.

1067
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:16,812
Mm-hm, okay, research.

1068
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,649
Look, being Santa
Claus is not just a job.

1069
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:23,069
It's a way of life, okay?

1070
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,863
- Mm-hm.
- Look at me.

1071
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,533
S-A-N-T-I-N-C.

1072
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,368
Say that again.

1073
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,996
I'm S-A-N-T-I-N-C.

1074
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,374
Forgot the A this time.

1075
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,584
Oh, baby, please go to bed.

1076
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,919
Forgot the A.

1077
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,254
Yep, right after
I do this research.

1078
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,839
Mm-hm, okay.

1079
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,260
Make sure you leave
Clar some cookies.

1080
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,223
Turn the light off, baby.

1081
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:54,475
- Use your clapper.
- Oh!

1082
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:55,769
Oh God.

1083
00:56:02,234 --> 00:56:04,110
Little crevices.

1084
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:05,111
Nooks.

1085
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,075
What we having, man?

1086
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,076
Hmm.

1087
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:15,371
Guess.

1088
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,416
I bet you all
nodding and reindeer.

1089
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,751
A snickerdoodle.

1090
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,717
You good, you good.

1091
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,718
You learning.

1092
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,554
And you got your glass.

1093
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1094
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,640
What?

1095
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,144
That's my milk.

1096
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,730
I saw you reaching.

1097
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:43,190
Your milk is in there
where you had your lips.

1098
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,276
Remember?
It's the same jug, Unc.

1099
00:56:45,277 --> 00:56:47,111
No, no, new jug, my jug.

1100
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,447
See my jug, my jug.

1101
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,823
Your lips, carton.

1102
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,199
Unc, I got a question for you.

1103
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,162
Hey, hey, you got a ques...?

1104
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,460
Yeah, go ahead and ask.

1105
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:03,919
Can I have a cookie?

1106
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,631
Oh man.

1107
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:10,886
The fact that you asking me
instead of just going in there,

1108
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,096
I love that, man.

1109
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,183
No, I don't want those
nasty snickerdoodle anyway.

1110
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:20,019
Well good 'cause
you can't have one.

1111
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,938
Why not chocolate
chip or something?

1112
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,900
It's a basic cookie.

1113
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,985
Chocolate chip is bluh.
They're the best.

1114
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,487
It's a basic cookie.

1115
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:30,488
Peanut butter?

1116
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,574
Sixties.

1117
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,369
What's the nastiest cookie?

1118
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,372
Rocky Road.

1119
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:40,748
Rocky Road Cookies?

1120
00:57:40,749 --> 00:57:42,375
That's what I said.

1121
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,834
What about oatmeal raisin?

1122
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,337
- Woo.
- Uh!

1123
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,965
Wee!

1124
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,643
Miss Clause is here.

1125
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,896
Santa Charles is really
walking away from it.

1126
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,776
Nick!

1127
00:58:07,777 --> 00:58:09,151
Elves.

1128
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:11,278
Excuse me, I love
a woman in charge.

1129
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,446
Oh, of course you do.

1130
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:13,489
Can I help you?

1131
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,824
No, but I can help you.

1132
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:15,991
I'm not interested.

1133
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,410
Okay.

1134
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,328
I guess I won't tell you
that the first challenge

1135
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,622
is a Santa trivia game.

1136
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,959
I appreciate you for
not telling me that.

1137
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,627
Is there anything else
you don't wanna tell me?

1138
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,505
I'd love to, but I can't.

1139
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,923
You shouldn't.

1140
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,425
I definitely shouldn't tell you

1141
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:34,051
that the second challenge
is a guessing game

1142
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,846
involving Santa Charles'
favorite cookie.

1143
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:38,764
But that's all I know.

1144
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,725
When I become queen
of this store one day,

1145
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,601
maybe you and I
should go grab lunch

1146
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,145
or something?
Merry Christmas.

1147
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,438
Oh, oh!

1148
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:48,232
Do you have any kids?

1149
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,900
No.

1150
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,403
Yeah, see, you're
not really my type,

1151
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,822
but I do wanna see
you win though.

1152
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:55,906
What can I say?

1153
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,199
I'm a feminist.

1154
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,534
Oh God, gross.

1155
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,120
- Elves, elves.
- I love women.

1156
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,750
Yeah, come in, come in.

1157
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:07,960
All right guys, look
at us, Team Elf.

1158
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,754
Team Elf, Team Elf, Team Elf!

1159
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,046
Okay, look, y'all look.

1160
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,631
Okay, so mall
security over there

1161
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,800
was just telling me
there's gonna be two games.

1162
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,470
Something about a
guessing game of cookies.

1163
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,181
The other one is basically
like a Santa trivia game.

1164
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,849
Hold on, we gotta guess cookies?

1165
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:23,809
I'm you're guy, promise you.

1166
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,686
- You guys are-
- It's a home-run.

1167
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,104
Only for now.

1168
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,397
Hey, what's wrong
with your hat, man?

1169
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,107
You look like you're
leaning a bit.

1170
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,443
Oh, interesting.

1171
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:34,570
Huh, I'm like a
leaning tower of pizza.

1172
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,072
All right, better?

1173
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,033
Yeah, man.

1174
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:39,950
All right.

1175
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,703
No mistakes.

1176
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,581
Mistakes are okay as
long as you remain friends.

1177
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,625
Aye, man, we're trying to
win this thing, all right.

1178
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:51,212
Morning Santas and
welcome back for day two.

1179
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,463
Are you ready for more games?

1180
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:56,091
Yeah!

1181
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,302
Gingerbread, Elf,

1182
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,805
Snowmen, are your teams ready?

1183
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,723
Yeah!

1184
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:03,724
Great.

1185
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:06,727
Now it's time for The Santa,

1186
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,941
a trivia game hosted by the
one, the only Santa Charles.

1187
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:19,198
Listen up, guys.

1188
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,116
The questions are
all multiple choice.

1189
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,994
So you all stand a chance, okay?

1190
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,455
You say you wanna play too.

1191
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,416
Well, let's see.

1192
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,461
Questions, please.

1193
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,462
Be aggressive.

1194
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:37,925
First question.

1195
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:42,930
How many reindeer
does Santa have?

1196
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:45,307
A, eight, B, nine.

1197
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,687
- I know this one!
- C as many as he wants.

1198
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,323
B, B it is, it's definitely B.

1199
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,328
Boards, please.

1200
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,544
And the answer is B, 9.

1201
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:29,059
Where exactly was mommy
when she kissed Santa Claus?

1202
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,978
Underneath the mistletoe?

1203
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,606
Underneath a little bow?

1204
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,691
C, at Ice Cube's house?

1205
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,735
Y'all, I think, I think it's,

1206
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,320
I think it's a trick question.

1207
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,988
Why your mama kissing Santa?

1208
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,407
I think it's a trick question.

1209
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,579
Board, please.

1210
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:55,962
You all right!

1211
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:04,553
Now, name a country in which
Santa is known as Pere Noel.

1212
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,305
Can you guys say that?

1213
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:07,973
Pere Noel.

1214
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,350
Good, look at that!

1215
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:10,435
Look at them!

1216
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,354
- A, France.
- Yes.

1217
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,688
B, Belgium.

1218
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,149
C, Watts.

1219
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,735
Pere Noel?

1220
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:24,114
What you doing, eh?

1221
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,157
Board, please.

1222
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,910
It's not, it's not.

1223
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:32,039
They stupid.

1224
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,083
I'm sorry, elves,
you got that wrong.

1225
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:38,087
It's actually, A, France.

1226
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,588
You guys just sit
there and breathe, okay.

1227
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,048
I got this.

1228
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,174
Hey, it was an honest mistake.

1229
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,676
Yeah, it's all right.

1230
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,261
We're still best friends.
Bombaclat, man.

1231
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,097
Who had the biggest
hit of her career

1232
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:52,893
with the song "Santa
Baby" in 1953?

1233
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,812
A, Eartha Kitt.

1234
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,605
B, Prince.

1235
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:00,818
- Multiple choice.
- C, Beyonce.

1236
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,904
I mean,
what is the A for though?

1237
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,698
Ah, answer is A!

1238
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,282
We got it right!

1239
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,118
That's all that
matters, we're friends!

1240
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,248
What black song plays all
day long during Christmas?

1241
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:15,499
A?

1242
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:19,920
What group does Eddie
Lavert sing with?

1243
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,296
You guys just sit
there and breathe.

1244
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,464
Okay, I've got this.

1245
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,300
- Boards?
- Listen, listen.

1246
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,762
C, Elves, you got that wrong.

1247
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:29,763
Okay?

1248
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,268
Ahh, answer is A.

1249
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,272
B.

1250
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,398
Yeah man,

1251
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,733
that's what I'm saying!

1252
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:41,734
A.

1253
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:49,324
What is Santa's favorite cookie?

1254
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:52,078
It don't matter,
he eat anything.

1255
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,380
Final tie-breaking round.

1256
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,466
Gingerbread, you're
gonna sit this one out.

1257
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,219
It's between the
elves and the snowmen.

1258
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:10,429
Okay?

1259
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,682
This is the question.

1260
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,936
First team to me with
their chalkboard wins.

1261
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,898
Who was the first Mall Santa?

1262
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,484
A, Colonel Tim.

1263
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,278
B, Colonel Nim.

1264
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,739
C, Colonel Sanders.

1265
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,450
D, Popeye.

1266
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:33,578
I know this one, wait, wait!

1267
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,123
You're gonna be
the one to write?

1268
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,375
Yes, yes.

1269
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,460
Oh-ho!

1270
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,878
Snowman!

1271
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,213
He's the snowman!

1272
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:46,131
You did it, you did it!

1273
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,716
You did the thing, man.

1274
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,177
But you wrong.

1275
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,932
It's trivia not trash.

1276
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:55,933
Yeah.

1277
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:58,477
Nice try.

1278
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,399
What you got, Elves?

1279
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,407
That's gonna be hell.

1280
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,784
It is.

1281
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,913
But you know what,
Elves, you got one!

1282
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,624
B, Colonel Nim!

1283
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:25,797
Gingerbread and Elves
team, you tied up.

1284
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:31,468
Elves, Gingerbread, you're
on the next round.

1285
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,469
Woo-hoo.

1286
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,180
This is a good game.

1287
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:36,932
Great, great.

1288
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,768
Hey, Sugar.

1289
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:51,697
Well, as far as Team Elf, goes,

1290
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:56,786
first you got, you got this
old, I guess, Asian guy.

1291
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,038
His name's Adam.

1292
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,499
Have you ever had a gas bubble

1293
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,209
that just you can't get rid of?

1294
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,627
He's all right.

1295
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,129
He's probably the
worst-smelling person

1296
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,255
I've ever met in my entire life.

1297
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:09,923
Stephanie.

1298
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,842
Maybe she come back to the
island with me, you know?

1299
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,218
Um, he could be second place.

1300
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,344
He could play the reindeer.

1301
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:18,016
Fireside and candle lights.

1302
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:24,606
Stephanie, me,
perhaps a little wine.

1303
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,235
I like to romanticize about...

1304
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,447
reindeer, huh?

1305
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,615
Reindeer.

1306
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,200
And I'm not done yet.

1307
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,119
I'm, I didn't finish.

1308
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:44,625
Moving forward,
it will be every man

1309
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,753
and woman for themselves.

1310
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,004
The next game is called-
This is a little game

1311
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,714
I call smell my finger.

1312
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:53,342
Guess the cookie
correctly, you move on.

1313
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,470
Guess it wrong, you're done.

1314
01:06:58,848 --> 01:06:59,933
First up, please.

1315
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,690
Chocolate chip.

1316
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,775
You got it right.

1317
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,778
Next contestant, please.

1318
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,908
Chocolate chip.

1319
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,034
Oh man, no.

1320
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,118
I wanna redo!

1321
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,662
- I don't care.
- I want a redo.

1322
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,372
I don't care!

1323
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,623
You're wrong.

1324
01:07:24,624 --> 01:07:26,584
We bringing a blindfold
to up the ante.

1325
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:29,671
He's very excited.

1326
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,217
Chocolate chip.

1327
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:36,260
No.

1328
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:37,427
Oh, man!

1329
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:38,680
Work on that.

1330
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:41,848
Not right now.

1331
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:44,269
Right now with the nails.

1332
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:47,771
Back it out, back it down.

1333
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,190
No, this gotta be snickerdeedle.

1334
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,650
What'd you say?

1335
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:54,778
Snickerdoo,
snickerdicky, snookerdook.

1336
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,446
Yeah, something like that.

1337
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,699
He's from the south.

1338
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:00,909
Behold.

1339
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,953
Hmm.

1340
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:04,621
Gingersnap.

1341
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:06,123
You're right.

1342
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,291
Next!

1343
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:08,792
Both elves.

1344
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,128
Smell my finger.

1345
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,462
Shortbread.

1346
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,089
Wow, he's right.

1347
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,508
My friend got it right.

1348
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,510
You're a happy elf.

1349
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,138
Bligh, bligh.

1350
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:24,474
Mm, that's definitely
a biscotti biscuit.

1351
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:26,685
Oh, no!

1352
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,395
It's not a bloody biscuit.

1353
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,063
It's a cookie!

1354
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:32,983
There's no tea over here.

1355
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:33,984
Bullocks!

1356
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:37,154
Bloody cookies.

1357
01:08:37,155 --> 01:08:39,490
Take it home for Team Elf.

1358
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,367
No.

1359
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,660
No, no!

1360
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:46,538
No!

1361
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:47,539
Next!

1362
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,834
Are you from San Diego?

1363
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,753
You got a boo-boo.

1364
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:56,590
No, no, no.

1365
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:57,759
Special one for you.

1366
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,552
It's a macaroon, man.

1367
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,473
Well, whata, whata, yuh
boy right!

1368
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:11,481
Sheila E.

1369
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,316
Sheila E. Elf.

1370
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:17,778
Oatmeal.

1371
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:18,821
You're right.

1372
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:23,075
It's good for your
system, oatmeal.

1373
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,076
Roosh.

1374
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:26,912
Woo, now that's a big elf.

1375
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:29,624
Um, you want a hamburger?

1376
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,710
Maybe get two cookies for you.

1377
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:36,505
- Peanut butter.
- Oh, damn.

1378
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:37,924
Chocolate chip.

1379
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,258
Pretzel?

1380
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,970
That boy's good.

1381
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,723
You good, boy, you good!

1382
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,687
And just like that, we're
down to the final five.

1383
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:53,940
Let's give it up for them.

1384
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:00,113
We'll see you on the
final day, everybody.

1385
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,826
Thanks, Santa.

1386
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:07,787
I think one of them might
actually win this thing.

1387
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:10,164
It happens.

1388
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,415
What the fudge candy apple?

1389
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,085
You really gonna leave this?

1390
01:10:57,086 --> 01:11:00,255
About time she finds out
how hard the job really is.

1391
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,883
She's gonna see how hard
it is to be Santa Claus.

1392
01:11:02,884 --> 01:11:04,761
This is what you
gonna leave us with?

1393
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,597
You gotta be kidding me, man.

1394
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,642
That's what you
gonna leave us with?

1395
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,831
Give it up for Stephanie.

1396
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:38,753
Adam.

1397
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Wayne.

1398
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:47,803
Nick.

1399
01:11:50,598 --> 01:11:51,974
Nick, come on!

1400
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,562
And Clyde.

1401
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,982
One of these competitors
is about to become

1402
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,777
the next Mall Santa.

1403
01:12:03,778 --> 01:12:06,154
But before we jump
into day three,

1404
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,906
the final day of
the Santa Games,

1405
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,950
a quick word from our sponsor.

1406
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:13,496
The woman who signs my checks,
Denise Rainer, everyone.

1407
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:18,834
Is this on?

1408
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:22,504
Thank you, DJ Snowbiz, and I
just have one thing to say.

1409
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:27,300
And that is, thank
you and thank you.

1410
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:29,678
No, no, no, no, no.

1411
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:32,681
Santa Charles,
you have made this

1412
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:35,016
one Christmas
season to remember.

1413
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,852
Hmm, your final season.

1414
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:40,230
And on behalf of
myself, your fans,

1415
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,357
and all of Santa's helpers,

1416
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,568
we wanted to do something
a little different,

1417
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,903
something meaningful.

1418
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:48,573
You're gonna make me slave cry.

1419
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,451
Cookies!

1420
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,997
They're vegan.

1421
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:00,083
I am so proud of how
you structured the rules

1422
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:03,378
of this competition and
how you did so without bias

1423
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,380
or prejudice or flatulence

1424
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:09,885
and how you took the time
for each competitor to dig in

1425
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,721
and help them find their
full Santa potential.

1426
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,724
Mm, with that level of
grit and determination,

1427
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:19,228
I think we can be confident
that your family's legacy

1428
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,522
is in good hands.

1429
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,860
Thank you, Denise.

1430
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:29,029
Thank you, but no need to put
Santa Charles on the spot.

1431
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,865
Let's let him enjoy
his cookies in peace.

1432
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,783
He earned them after all.

1433
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:37,288
Now are we ready for
the final challenge?

1434
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,917
I can't hear you.

1435
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:48,965
It's time for an obstacle
course unlike any other.

1436
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:52,510
A game that's gonna make
you feel real sentimental.

1437
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:55,639
Please, please, a
round of Santa applause

1438
01:13:55,640 --> 01:14:00,269
for a game we're calling
Santa's extra special delivery.

1439
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,855
Yes, yes, yes!

1440
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,358
Grab the Santa sack
and fill it with toys.

1441
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:08,401
Then take the sack
around the world

1442
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,236
before delivering
it to Santa Charles

1443
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,073
for the final elf battle.

1444
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,492
Don't be nervous.

1445
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:18,078
It's only Santa's entire
Christmas Eve routine.

1446
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,579
What could go wrong?

1447
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,622
May the best Santa win.

Easy peasy, right?

1454
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,553
You will have seven minutes
to complete the course.

1455
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,680
Three.

1456
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:37,640
Two.

1457
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,640
Go, go, go.

1458

Okay, first one in.

Oh, is this allowed?

1460
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:49,568
First one out.

1461

Come on, come on, out
the door, out the door!

1462

Come on, Clyde!

1466
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,592
Shoes off.

1467
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,720
You're supposed to
be jogging, Santa.

1468
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,347
Shoes off, let's go, let's go.

1469
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,348
Oh!

1470
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,934
Shoes off.

1471
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,227
Here we go, here we go.

1472
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,438
Oh, Wayne, Wayne, go!

1473
01:15:26,439 --> 01:15:27,814
Ease up, meh man.

1474
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:30,026
Okay, okay, this way now.

1475
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,739
Man, come on, here we go.

1476
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,240
Let's go!

1477
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,451
Ooh!

1478
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,494
Oh, sorry.

1479
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,539
Somebody's got the
Christmas spirit.

1480
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,709
Or a bit of spirits.

1481
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,090
This is Santa's
extra special delivery.

1482
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,633
These Santas will
race their snow globes

1483
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:58,303
around the world three times.

1484
01:15:58,304 --> 01:15:59,597
Let's hope this works out.

1485
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:02,975
Get out the way.

1486
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,437
Move it now.

1487
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:14,402
It looks like these snow globes

1488
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,739
are knocking over
all of these Santas.

Y'all watch that now.

1499
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:47,812
You guys got it.

01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,986
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1501
01:16:56,987 --> 01:16:57,987
Come on!

1502
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:05,829
Hey, Bob Marley!

1503
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,289
Here they come!

1504
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,505
You're blocking
me, boy, watch out now.

1505
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,175
Go, go, go!

1506
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,680
Ah!

1507
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:26,015
Oh!

1508
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:27,016
Awwh!

1509
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:29,185
Come on.

1510
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:30,520
Is this it?

1511
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:33,399
Could this be the
end of the games?

1512
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,654
Go!

1513
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:47,912
Go!

1514
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Go!

1515
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,811
Teamwork!

1516
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:12,980
This is great.

1517
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:36,712
Since you guys didn't
complete your task,

1518
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,297
I'm still Santa.

1519
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:40,298
What?

1520
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:46,471
Still Santa.

1521
01:18:46,472 --> 01:18:49,098
That is not what
we talked about.

1522
01:18:49,099 --> 01:18:51,434
Still Santa.

1523
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,228
That's not what we talked about.

1524
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:57,482
I'm still, ep-re-ruh-ruh, Santa.

1525
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,901
Uh-uh-uh-uh, that's
not what we talked about.

1526
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,194
That's what you came up with.

1527
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,695
- That's not what I-
- Your rules!

1528
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,907
- Charles!
- Hey, Unc.

1529
01:19:06,408 --> 01:19:08,284
Clarence.

1530
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,869
Game's not over yet.

1531
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,413
Santa never misses a delivery.

1532
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:15,458
Thank you, Aunt Carol.

1533
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,628
Wait a minute, you knew?

1534
01:19:18,629 --> 01:19:22,340
Yeah, he wanted
to do it himself.

1535
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:23,967
Oh, and that beard.

1536
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,094
I wanted to help him
glue it on this morning.

1537
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:29,889
But yeah, he wanted to
do that himself too.

1538
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:32,475
I thought that
hat looked familiar.

1539
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:34,978
That's what hat
my granddady wore.

1540
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:35,979
Let's go, yo.

1541
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,822
Nah, man, yuh all shame me!

1542
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,950
In order to win, you
must capture my hat.

1543
01:19:53,998 --> 01:19:55,040
Go, go, go!

1544
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,122
Are you proud of yourself?

1545
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,708
You have a camera?

1546
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,335
You get a hat.

1547
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,336
You good!

1548
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,343
It's only one person
I'll choose to be Santa.

1549
01:20:53,724 --> 01:20:55,225
I don't want it.

1550
01:20:57,394 --> 01:20:58,896
I said I don't want it!

1551
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:05,276
What are you saying?

1552
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,570
You do all this?

1553
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:13,451
Didn't I'll tell you, your
actions, they mean something.

1554
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:15,661
Your decisions mean something.

1555
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,413
Why would you say
something silly like that?

1556
01:21:17,414 --> 01:21:18,748
You'll do all this.

1557
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:20,292
Oh, hold up, I'm
just playing, man.

1558
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:23,795
I'll do it.

1559
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,257
But under one condition.

1560
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,846
What are your conditions, man?

1561
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,557
If my crew can be Santa too.

1562
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,400
You're a dance group?

1563
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,153
Wait, so you're
thinking all five of you?

1564
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,239
Yes, ma'am.

1565
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:52,281
That might work.

1566
01:21:52,282 --> 01:21:54,033
Financially, that could be good.

1567
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:56,369
Let me ask you this.

1568
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,121
Why?

1569
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:03,251
'Cause that, that's real.

1570
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,837
That's the gift of
giving you're doing.

1571
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:07,755
That's the gift I
was talking about.

1572
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:12,678
You got a new life and you're
giving them a chance from it.

1573
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:15,972
I know.

1574
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:19,518
You think I can
get a better hat?

1575
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,397
Yeah, this is Poon Daddy's.

1576
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,691
That's a legacy.

1577
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:30,529
Wear that with pride.

1578
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,073
Ho-ho-ho!

1579
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:53,676
Now, I get to go to Edinburgh!

1580
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:54,677
Yes!

1581
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:55,888
Not Alabama?

1582
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:47,355
- Santa Stephanie!
- Hey, how are you?

1583
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,523
How old are you?

1584
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:50,191
Oh baby, I forgot.

1585
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,484
Are you a fairy?

1586
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:53,069
I'm more like an angel.

1587
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,238
Where are you from?

1588
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:56,822
Ohio.

1589
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,783
How do you do it?

1590
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,201
Do what, Kitty?

1591
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,412
Deliver all the
presents in one night.

1592
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:07,041
Mommy said that
you don't like milk.

1593
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,376
Oh, that's right.

1594
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,752
You know me lactose intolerant.

1595
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,129
It's not good for me
stomach, you know.

1596
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,131
Hey, Santa Nick.

1597
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:15,716
Huh, yeah?

1598
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,969
Where's your belly?

1599
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,638
Oh, it kept getting
stuck in the chimney.

1600
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:21,848
So I got rid of it.

1601
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:34,194
Give it up for Santa Clarence.

1602
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:36,445
Ho-ho-ho!

1603
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:41,994
All right, who's first?

1604
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,289
What do you guys
want for Christmas?

1605
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,373
A unicorn.

1606
01:24:47,374 --> 01:24:49,041
A unicorn?

1607
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,627
Makeup and puzzle.

1608
01:24:51,628 --> 01:24:53,629
A puzzle?

1609
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:54,755
What about you?

1610
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,800
I want a Christmas present.

1611
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:00,886
A Christmas present, what kind?

1612
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:01,971
A dress?

1613
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,681
The little red one.

1614
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:04,683
A red one?

1615
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:10,105
Santa!

1616
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:13,816
Ho-ho-ho!

1617
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,031
Uh, heh.

1618
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:25,996
Ah.

1619
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,961
Well, we had a good run.

1620
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,131
Ah.

1621
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,179
Leave my mark.

1622
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:44,180
Ah.

1623
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,267
Huh.

1624
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:50,686
Well.

1625
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:07,504
Finally, Mr and Mrs Claus
get what they want.

1626
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,624
A vacation!
Mm, thank you, big Santa.

1627
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:14,335
- Brown sugar.
- Woo!

1628
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,129
Well, you can take the
boy outta the North pole,

1629
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:21,133
but you can take the
North Pole out of the boy!

1630
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,927
Big Santa's on the way.

1631
01:26:22,928 --> 01:26:25,179
Can I say that?

1632
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,348
Oh.

1633
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,647
Hello.

1634
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:36,023
It's me, Scott.

1635
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,401
I'm still here, I
didn't leave yet.

1636
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:41,529
No, I'm actually
still in the hotel

1637
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,906
waiting for all of
the team to finish up

1638
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:45,449
and good stuff, you know.

1639
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,326
I didn't want to
go quite home yet

1640
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:49,870
'cause I think I'm gonna
surprise the mates.

1641
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,998
You know, head out there,
you know, sit on their lap.

1642
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:55,292
Oh, I actually got a
present for Clarence.

1643
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:57,420
Yeah, he's gonna love these.

1644
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,255
It's a flower.

1645
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,881
He doesn't actually like flowers

1646
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:02,383
and he specifically
told me that,

1647
01:27:02,384 --> 01:27:05,094
but I think it'll warm
his heart a little bit.

1648
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,721
Give him a little
Christmas cheer.

1649
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:09,640
So, mm, smells like Christmas.

1650
01:27:09,641 --> 01:27:11,016
So I bought this for him.

1651
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,602
And yeah, I'm gonna go
hang out with the mates.

1652
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,646
Yeah, maybe have some
eggnog, something, you know.

1653
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,316
Have a little time before
I get back to London town.
