1
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,233
- Sebek.

2
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,604
Sebek.

3
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,220
Sebek.

4
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,493
- Reheema.

5
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,064
- Sebek.

6
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,290
- Reheema!

7
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,578
Reheema!

8
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,916
- The
lost city of Saqqara,

9
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,820
home of the first man.

10
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,789
Built from clay.

11
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,427
U-khany Sesebek and
his love Reheema Mense

12
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,898
have been reincarnate
lovers for centuries.

13
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:50,569
Legends evolve over time.

14
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,939
No one knows exactly
where it all began.

15
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,310
A tale of two lovers
charged with great purpose.

16
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,747
A love meant to bring
about prosperity and riches

17
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:03,748
to the great lands.

18
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:12,390
A bond meant to be
carried out for eternity

19
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:15,927
centered around a stone mazar.

20
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,976
The two lovers charged
with great purpose,

21
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:33,445
fueled by an unbreakable bond,

22
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:37,816
maintained the cycle of
balance for centuries.

23
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,886
Great kings and gods clashed

24
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:43,788
all seeking the
lost city of Saqqara

25
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,991
and the power of the stone.

26
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,272
A different prophecy
has come to light.

27
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,112
One of wrath and vengeance,

28
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:12,584
and if ever unleashed,
the two scorned lovers

29
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,954
will bring about the apocalypse.

30
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,049
- You just couldn't
resist, could ya?

31
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,383
- We are treasure
hunters, right?

32
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,022
I mean, we can't just borrow.

33
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,090
- Free bird.

34
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,392
Free bird.

35
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,830
It's not nice to take things
that don't belong to you.

36
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:14,045
Why don't you come out
real nice and slow like?

37
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,114
We can kiss and make up.

38
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,425
- Daniela.

39
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:03,495
You mind telling me what
all the fuss was about?

40
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,964
- The lost city of Saqqara.

41
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:08,533
- A map.

42
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,468
- Not a map, the map.

43
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,573
This can't be.

44
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,844
Noe, take a look at this.

45
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:22,947
- That's disgusting.

46
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,649
- Just...

47
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,318
Would you?

48
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,953
Oh God, that's disgusting.

49
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,590
- Looks recent.

50
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,758
- That's not possible.

51
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,063
What are you doing?

52
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:39,764
- Every time you say
that's not possible

53
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,033
something impossible happens.

54
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,034
- That's...

55
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,135
That's absurd.

56
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,372
- Do you remember our
other cave guy, Bismak?

57
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,175
- Of course I do.

58
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:53,478
- Tall, kind, bit of an
oddball, but congenial.

59
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,013
What about him?

60
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:56,748
- He died getting us the
coordinates to this place

61
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,184
after you said that
it was impossible

62
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,286
the ancient priests of
Saqqara would dare think

63
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:04,055
to booby trap the entrance
to an embalming chamber.

64
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,557
- Well, now that you mention it,

65
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,424
I wasn't that fond of him.

66
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,325
- Mm.

67
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:13,131
Well, good thing he had a brother
who doesn't speak English.

68
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,404
- I found the map to the
lost city of Saqqara.

69
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,772
- Questionable.
- And you're going on

70
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,273
about booby traps.
- A man's death.

71
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,743
- And caves when we could very
well be standing in a place

72
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,578
that's over 5000 years old.

73
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,146
- 4800 B.C.
- Yeah, whatever.

74
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,583
- The lost city of Saqqara,

75
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,451
where the first
pharaoh was born.

76
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,986
- I went to the
same school as you.

77
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,054
I know the tales.

78
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,591
Pharaoh's would be charged
with reincarnating two lovers

79
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:41,226
to bring about a
plentiful harvest

80
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,961
and renewal to their kingdoms.

81
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,263
A cycle that must be continued

82
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,699
or risk the wrath of the gods.

83
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:50,201
- A risk that Pharaoh
Tesnemar did not heed.

84
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,878
He wanted their power

85
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,180
to live forever and got
greedy in the process.

86
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:03,114
Cursed his kingdom.

87
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,415
Blah blah blah blah blah.

88
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,752
- Be careful!

89
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,534
U-khany Sesebek.

90
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,942
- Hey, Biyombo, could you...

91
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:36,781
- What?

92
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,823
A seal.

93
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,570
- That's...

94
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,538
Weird.

95
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,532
- The seal is odd.

96
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,300
- Odd as in good

97
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,670
or odd weird?

98
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:38,743
- I don't know, but I've never
seen markings like these.

99
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,414
And for this time period,
it seems inconsistent.

100
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,349
- I thought the
lost city of Saqqara

101
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,084
was of the old continent.

102
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,720
- Precisely, but this symbol.

103
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,225
It's unlike any carbon fiber
or protein I've ever seen.

104
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,495
I mean, the only thing I
have to compare it to...

105
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,429
Unless.

106
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,835
That's not possible.

107
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,833
- Biyombo.
- Biyombo.

108
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,269
- Biyombo!

109
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,238
Hang on!

110
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,350
Do you hear that?

111
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,055
Hm.

112
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:01,559
Nothing.

113
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,931
- He didn't bury Reheema in
the lost city of Saqqara.

114
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,301
- How can you be so sure?

115
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:15,039
- Because the lost city
of Saqqara isn't a city.

116
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:24,382
Look.

117
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,383
We are to be the
first to find Sebek.

118
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,684
That was the arrangement.

119
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:37,722
The tablet we found is
not of Egyptian origin.

120
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,223
That can only mean one thing.

121
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,426
- This is it.

122
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,995
- The power of the gods.

123
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,966
Seriously, look at you.

124
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,837
You didn't think I
came all this way,

125
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:57,909
tolerated your little
sandbox adventures, for what?

126
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,246
Treasures and riches?

127
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,785
The stone of Zahad is
the key to the one thing

128
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,588
that money cannot buy.

129
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,492
- Texts of Hades.

130
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,538
- Now.

131
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,543
If we're quite done with the
bravado and the pleasantries

132
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,380
please get on with it, my dear.

133
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:41,152
What have you found?

134
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,382
- Be careful.

135
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,028
- Obsidian basalt.

136
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,831
Used as a false mask to hide
the tablet's true origin.

137
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,645
- Are these men
really necessary?

138
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,286
- These men are part
of the Piyidi tribe

139
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,189
trying to protect their lands

140
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:54,225
from the principality
that keeps the rivers dry

141
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,994
and the people poor so
please show some respect.

142
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,969
- One can never be too careful

143
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:09,006
especially in a tomb
that predates the...

144
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,777
- Sager, our job
was to find Sebek

145
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,079
and conclude a search
that began ages ago,

146
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,048
a search for the
lost city of Saqqara.

147
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,752
- Well, I suggest
you do your job.

148
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:39,437
- This is...

149
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,304
This is it.

150
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,682
The encryption reads,

151
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,820
"follow that which
unveils itself in fire.

152
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:19,977
"And in light never before."

153
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:23,214
- Fire.

154
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,416
Are you sure?

155
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,152
It has to be something more.

156
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,497
- I didn't see that coming.

157
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,047
- You sure about this?

158
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,859
- If we find the lost
city of Saqqara first

159
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:16,093
we can renew the cycle.

160
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,899
What better way to stop
it, but from the inside?

161
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:58,402
Besides, you really
think it'll stop?

162
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:26,197
Be careful!

163
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:32,169
It's very rare to have an
unguarded tomb this far

164
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,672
from Anubis or even
the feet of Horus.

165
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:38,876
- What is this place?

166
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:40,778
- Hatusun.

167
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:43,948
The room...

168
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:50,955
of the in between.

169
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:57,528
- This place is cursed.

170
00:25:40,072 --> 00:25:40,971
- Stay calm.

171
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,945
What are the men saying?

172
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:52,182
- The men believe
this place is pure evil.

173
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:09,233
- Hatusun.

174
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,703
There's something written here.

175
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,811
In this life or in the
depths of the underworld

176
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,769
- Calm.

177
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:19,670
Stay calm.

178
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,605
- Daniela.

179
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,337
Holy shit.

180
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,280
Do you think?

181
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:06,050
- It is Sebek.

182
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,087
- He looks scorched.

183
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:27,771
Oh my God.

184
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:32,042
- No.

185
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,611
No mummy I've ever researched
has appeared this way.

186
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,586
- They burned him alive
inside the sarcophagus.

187
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,130
- But there's a message here.

188
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:05,909
The path to life
begins with death.

189
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,017
And there's something else.

190
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:36,907
- Daniela.

191
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:39,843
They want you

192
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:42,913
to stop chanting the
evil words of a dead man.

193
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:11,608
Shit!

194
00:30:26,392 --> 00:30:27,291
Hey!

195
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,393
Oh shit.

196
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,213
No time to site see!

197
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,172
- That's not possible.

198
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,775
- Let's talk about this after
we make it to the surface!

199
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,860
- We must seal this tomb.

200
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,830
- What about your men?

201
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,366
- The men knew
what they signed up for.

202
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:02,913
- We must this seal this tomb.

203
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:04,281
- No!

204
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,450
I have to find the stone!

205
00:33:06,452 --> 00:33:09,519
We're close, I can feel it.

206
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:12,823
- If we don't seal this tomb,
Sebek will regain his power.

207
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:16,660
If that happens, there won't
be a world to live forever in.

208
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:24,601
- Go.

209
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,771
Forward, forward.

210
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:42,052
- These formations must
be over 10,000 years old.

211
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,892
- I think older.

212
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:53,663
- They said this
place belonged to Hades.

213
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,902
- In your stories, what was
the purpose of this place?

214
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:08,078
- It is said Sebek and Reheema
are to perform a ritual.

215
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,161
A sacrifice of true love.

216
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,101
- In my studies
we spoke of nahem,

217
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,637
but it meant great curse.

218
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,941
- There are many curses.

219
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:41,878
- Like one of reincarnation,
over and over and over again.

220
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,949
- No, it's much more than that.

221
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:53,957
- Your people are at war?

222
00:34:55,394 --> 00:35:00,464
- My people are victims
of the evil regime.

223
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:09,439
It is not war if both
sides don't believe

224
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,408
they are on the side of good.

225
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,978
- Now that Sebek is
free, what of the legend

226
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,046
of your stories?

227
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,416
- I don't know.

228
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:23,353
It wasn't supposed
to be possible.

229
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,525
- We just woke an evil
creature from the dead.

230
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,293
I'd say everything's
on the table.

231
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:55,919
- He needs two things to
perform the sacrifice.

232
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:02,993
Something about that
pours from beneath

233
00:36:03,896 --> 00:36:06,696
that may reveal it.

234
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,268
That's all I know.

235
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,603
- Chaka!

236
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,938
Come on!

237
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:34,110
Hey, come on.

238
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,314
Come on!

239
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:41,384
- No, Sebek controls the dead.

240
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,987
Reheema controls the living.

241
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:48,058
The wounds are effecting him.

242
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,225
We've gotta get him out of here.

243
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:51,361
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

244
00:38:51,363 --> 00:38:53,963
Stop, Sebek, not live time.

245
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,065
Stop Sebek.

246
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,735
Go, leave me, leave me.

247
00:38:58,737 --> 00:38:59,569
Go without me.

248
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,770
It's not enough time.

249
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,240
Stop Sebek, go.

250
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,277
Go!

251
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,415
Get outta here.

252
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:23,827
- I found something!

253
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:33,636
- They're right behind me!

254
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:40,944
- You must hurry!

255
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,187
- Disgusting!

256
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,494
- You were going to leave us!

257
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:02,699
- Be careful, I'm here
under still order.

258
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:10,340
As of now our business
is officially concluded.

259
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,643
You failed me far
too many times.

260
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:19,149
Because of you, I may have
lost the stone for good.

261
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:24,254
I trust that you can
find your way stateside.

262
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,503
- In what world would someone
like you be better than me.

263
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,675
You were playing the
living dead from the start.

264
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,114
- Let her go.

265
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,951
We have to find Sebek.

266
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:56,686
- No.

267
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,089
- What do you mean?

268
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,625
- I mean,

269
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,862
something tells me Sebek is
the least of our worries.

270
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:24,514
- Look at this.

271
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:37,293
Saqqara often referenced
as the lost city.

272
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,431
Believed to be located
under the Saharan Desert.

273
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:45,368
Said to be only accessible by
means of the Stone of Zahad.

274
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,771
Many have searched for
the city to no avail.

275
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,208
- The Stone of Zahad.

276
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,643
And Sager thinks
he'll be the first

277
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:55,445
to unveil this
wonder to the world.

278
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:58,948
But who is Zahad?

279
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,417
Why would his stones
convey so much power?

280
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,354
- Zahad translates
to all-knowing.

281
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,389
He must have been a
deity of some kind.

282
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:10,760
- And the Egyptian story
is lush with vegetation.

283
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,197
An Egyptian version
of the creation story.

284
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,665
- The stone must be the key.

285
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,636
- But not just any key.

286
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:40,156
A gateway between this
world and the underworld.

287
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,461
- For anyone to get a hold
of such a power if it exists

288
00:42:45,463 --> 00:42:47,530
would be infinitely dangerous.

289
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:50,767
They could tip the scale
between who lives and who dies.

290
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,270
- Immortality.

291
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,438
True power.

292
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,182
Sebek's tomb was
away from Horus.

293
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,886
- Because he wasn't
of the royal court?

294
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,958
- No, no, I think we're missing
the bigger picture here.

295
00:43:16,361 --> 00:43:17,360
- What do you mean?

296
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:21,931
- If Sebek is back
from the dead, right,

297
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:23,633
there's two questions.

298
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,069
First, where's Reheema?

299
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:27,570
Has she also been awakened?

300
00:43:27,572 --> 00:43:31,274
And second, what does he
need to renew the cycle?

301
00:43:32,444 --> 00:43:34,010
- Well, what does
he want with us?

302
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:34,944
- I don't know.

303
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,045
- Why would he spare your life?

304
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,984
- Maybe he blames us
for awakening him.

305
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:47,056
- Maybe he needs something.

306
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:50,727
Something that
only we would know.

307
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,297
Get down!

308
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:08,544
- It says here something was
used to sanctify Sebek's tomb.

309
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:11,881
- Sebek's tomb?

310
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,549
- The Scarab of Ra.

311
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,252
The Scarab of Ra!

312
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:20,990
- Wait for me!

313
00:44:50,955 --> 00:44:53,022
- What took you so long?

314
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:57,760
- All the entry points
have been compromised.

315
00:44:57,762 --> 00:45:00,830
That thing took
down an entire unit.

316
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:05,968
- That's not a thing.

317
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,106
It's her.

318
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:12,942
It's Reheema.

319
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,192
Nothing leaves this room.

320
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:30,293
Do you understand?

321
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,466
- Torch lights.

322
00:46:57,816 --> 00:46:59,215
What do we have?

323
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:34,010
- I don't know.

324
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:25,448
- You, turn around.

325
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,150
Turn around, let
me see your hands!

326
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:29,085
What?

327
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,180
- The Scarab of Ra is gone.

328
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,548
He must have come back for it.

329
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,049
- This is really bad.

330
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:36,852
It looks like something that
we would uncover on a dig.

331
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:38,020
- We have to go.

332
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,221
- Well, let's
figure it out later.

333
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:40,356
Let's get outta here!

334
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,378
What the hell did
we just witness?

335
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,147
- You know what, this
is significant, okay?

336
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:07,049
It's not a coincidence
that he's back here now.

337
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:08,651
- Well, let's
figure it out later.

338
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,985
Right now we have to go.

339
00:53:09,987 --> 00:53:11,420
First we have to contact...

340
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,327
- Hello, little birdie.

341
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:27,937
Tell me what you know.

342
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,506
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

343
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:31,340
- The map.

344
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:33,209
The scarab.

345
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,109
Give 'em to me.

346
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,582
- Look, there is no map, okay?

347
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,816
We don't have time to be...

348
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:42,551
- Stop it!

349
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:52,528
- Seems like you're
employer wanted an upgrade.

350
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,096
Hey, love?

351
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:56,765
See, you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

352
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,903
- Crow, if we don't stop Sebek
from completing the ritual

353
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:02,471
then we're all dead.

354
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,243
- Not all.

355
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:08,777
Not all.

356
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:10,479
See, you don't get it, do you?

357
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:15,317
You're just a bird
fluttering about.

358
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:18,354
Fluttering around in your cage.

359
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:27,162
Get 'em to the truck.

360
00:54:38,376 --> 00:54:42,978
Let's see if you weasel
your way out of this one.

361
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,867
- Sebek.

362
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,768
Sebek.

363
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:30,252
- Don't go to America, Vikka?

364
00:56:35,092 --> 00:56:38,093
Don't go to America, Vikka!

365
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,966
Stay here, Vikka.

366
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:48,604
Learn about the wonders
of the world, Vikka.

367
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,976
Fulfill your destiny, Vikka.

368
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,179
Destiny.

369
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:02,651
That's strange.

370
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:10,926
- Sebek.

371
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,165
- Khufu.

372
00:57:17,902 --> 00:57:18,801
- Sebek!

373
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:21,203
- Khufu!

374
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:32,981
Good, breathe.

375
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:35,350
Sebek is just an urban legend.

376
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:47,129
The tale of the first man
and woman creating you and I.

377
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,280
Where did you get this?

378
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,916
- The bedtime
story is real, yes?

379
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:13,922
- Show me.

380
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,018
Run, Khufu.

381
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:45,487
Take this to the others.

382
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:55,230
Let 'em know the
prophecy has begun.

383
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:26,762
- Stop.

384
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:29,765
- Is this really necessary?

385
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:38,640
Some detail you
have there, Sager.

386
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:45,347
- You know, my
grandfather, had character.

387
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,417
A meticulous man.

388
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:57,392
- Look who I found
snooping around.

389
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,573
- What a beautiful
family picture.

390
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,279
I was just explaining
how my grandfather

391
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:23,352
amassed the riches that
you're privy to today.

392
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:16,238
You see...

393
01:01:19,576 --> 01:01:20,809
without chaos...

394
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,350
There can be no order.

395
01:01:49,506 --> 01:01:52,774
You have something
very valuable to me.

396
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,979
- You left us in
that tomb to die.

397
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:00,482
- Sebek is trying to bring
about the apocalypse.

398
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,552
- The apocalypse?

399
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:07,089
Do you even know the
meaning of the word?

400
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:11,693
It means to reveal that
which was once hidden.

401
01:02:14,965 --> 01:02:17,833
You know, my grandfather
was stationed

402
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,769
in Cairo during the war,

403
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:23,238
somewhere beyond the
outskirts of the city.

404
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:28,076
Met a traveling man, faceless.

405
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:32,647
- Is that?

406
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:38,053
- The Book of Hades,
god of the underworld.

407
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:43,859
- You keep it here?

408
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:48,697
What does it say about
the ritual, about Sebek?

409
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:49,831
The lost city of Saqqara?

410
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,566
- I used to stay
up late at night

411
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:55,036
listening to him speak
of the Stone of Zahad

412
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:59,141
and the ancient battles
of the pharaohs.

413
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:02,144
Kings and gods.

414
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:07,215
He spoke of one taking the
place of two to become all.

415
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,421
- Sager, he came to
the museum yesterday.

416
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,524
- Sebek?

417
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:17,058
- He took the Scarab of Ra.

418
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:20,729
- The Scarab of Ra?

419
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:36,077
- He's
here for the book.

420
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:41,016
- Go find him!

421
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:44,853
- We have to protect the book.

422
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:47,856
- It could only go back
to where it all began.

423
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:49,758
- What does that mean?

424
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,127
- You're a smart girl,
you figure it out.

425
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:00,468
- Watch 'em.

426
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:10,045
- He's here.

427
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:12,113
- Daniela, when this is all over

428
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,748
you and I are gonna have
to have a serious talk.

429
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,818
You've been saying some
really crazy things lately.

430
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,454
- It could only go back
to where it all began.

431
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:20,722
- What are you talking about?

432
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,190
- Sager.

433
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:25,627
He said it could only go
back to where it all began.

434
01:04:25,629 --> 01:04:27,162
- So what?

435
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:29,431
- So even if he gets the book
we still no where to find him.

436
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:30,866
- And that will somehow
give us more time

437
01:04:30,868 --> 01:04:31,666
to break the curse?

438
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:32,567
- Yes.

439
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:44,613
- He's still missing
something he needs.

440
01:04:45,682 --> 01:04:46,882
- What is he missing?

441
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:48,316
He has the scarab,
he's here for the book.

442
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:49,551
What else does he need?

443
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:00,495
Where'd you get that?

444
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,434
- Sebek gave it to me.

445
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:08,470
- I can't, how?

446
01:05:17,915 --> 01:05:19,281
- We have to get out of here.

447
01:05:19,283 --> 01:05:21,249
No one is safe here.

448
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:30,859
Not today, sandman!

449
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,529
- Let's move, the book!

450
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:58,753
- Everything's ready to go.

451
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,359
- If you did your job then
we would have the stone!

452
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:10,832
- Sebek isn't going to the
tomb to resurrect Reheema.

453
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:15,370
- What do you mean?

454
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:18,173
- He's going to the
tomb to stop her!

455
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:21,376
- And what would
happen if he does?

456
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:27,449
- The lost city and everything
inside will be lost forever.

457
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:41,696
- These helicopter blades,

458
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:44,532
makes it a little
hard of hearing.

459
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:50,238
Makes me all crazy.

460
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:52,841
Got me all foggy.

461
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:00,115
- I didn't see a damn thing.

462
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,953
- We cut them off in
the desert up ahead,

463
01:07:04,955 --> 01:07:07,055
but we do this my way.

464
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:09,891
- But what happens
when we catch 'em?

465
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,628
- I don't know, be creative.

466
01:07:15,565 --> 01:07:19,501
Take the next chopper out,
but take out the trash.

467
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:27,475
Let's go!

468
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:29,411
Immortality awaits!

469
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:46,761
- We won't...

470
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:48,396
- Sager's a maniac.

471
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:52,033
We have to find Sebek.

472
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:55,970
- I think we just did.

473
01:07:58,909 --> 01:07:59,808
- Stay here.

474
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:01,476
- Stop!

475
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,732
Noe!

476
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:31,633
Noe!

477
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:51,352
- Hey.

478
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:54,556
Did I get him?

479
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:56,891
- You died.

480
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:01,362
The stone saved you.

481
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:04,766
- I don't understand.

482
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:09,103
- It doesn't have
any power left.

483
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:10,371
It doesn't have any
power remaining,

484
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,073
but I think this is
how Sebek is able

485
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:13,708
to regenerate his life force.

486
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,046
- We have to stop Sebek
from completing the ritual.

487
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:19,447
- Yeah, come on.

488
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:20,608
- Pull up.

489
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,010
Pull up.

490
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:22,910
Pull up!

491
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:42,957
- On your back.

492
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,192
Prepare for...

493
01:12:53,103 --> 01:12:54,235
- Don't move.

494
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:56,938
- Sager.

495
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:00,942
We have to stop Sebek from
completing the ritual.

496
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:04,212
- You just don't get it, do you?

497
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:05,847
You are the ritual.

498
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,254
- What are you talking about?

499
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:16,057
- The stone was filled
with Sebek's life force.

500
01:13:17,127 --> 01:13:18,960
Without it...

501
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:45,386
Sebek can't complete the ritual.

502
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,193
Sebek is alive.

503
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,264
His power can be
gained by another.

504
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:05,339
I shall have everlasting power.

505
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:20,354
- Hold on, Noe.

506
01:14:26,863 --> 01:14:27,295
Shit.

507
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:22,650
- What do you
want me to do with him?

508
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:23,518
- Bring him.

509
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:27,188
He'll be useful
where we're going.

510
01:15:48,011 --> 01:15:49,310
Hello, little friend.
