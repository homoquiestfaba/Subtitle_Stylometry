1
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,748
Why don't we watch TV?

2
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,253
You're originally
one of those on the screen

3
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,752
But you won't be the winner

4
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:12,292
You... why do you catch me here?

5
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,056
Your figure is not so good

6
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,336
Don't you wanna be the Princess?

7
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,568
I'll see if you can meet my standard

8
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,674
My figure is already good enough

9
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:27,475
What do you want me to do?

10
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,776
Don't bother me

11
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,243
To leave here, you have one only way

12
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,617
Your weight must be below 70 pounds!

13
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:44,455
Cherrie

14
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,253
You scared me, Hong

15
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,090
You're going out for a meal in the rain?

16
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,861
They forgot to buy it for me

17
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,887
Have you had it yet?

18
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,332
Yes. They've been finding you

19
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,229
Damn Hurry up

20
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,241
What? You let Sisi go on stage first?

21
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,270
I won't go on stage tonight

22
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,446
What should I do then?
Somersault or Muay Thai?

23
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:14,146
Don't be angry
You're the planned Princess

24
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,747
She's a clown. You're a star

25
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,757
She's much worse than you

26
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:20,686
And once you go on stage

27
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,627
no one will ever remember her

28
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,330
Look, she really performs Muay Thai

29
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,932
I've seen miss Sisi's resume

30
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,167
She's one of
the best Muay Thai players in HK

31
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,032
Really cool

32
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,101
Powerful punches

33
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,749
Cherrie!

34
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,726
Where have you gone?

35
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,287
Go get the clothes for Queenie

36
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,226
Yes...

37
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,353
Is it okay? Is it okay?

38
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:59,627
Sisi. Great, Sisi

39
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,193
Should have some tricks
to entertain people

40
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,331
Queenie, the next one is you

41
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,269
What?

42
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,534
It's your turn

43
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:08,733
Why don't you say it earlier?

44
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,172
Don't put your dirty stuff everywhere

45
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,736
My skirt worths $50,000
You can't afford to pay

46
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,074
Queenie! Get away!

47
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,310
Why so many people?

48
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,677
Why always block my way?

49
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,315
What monkey show do you wanna play now?

50
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,381
Go see the physician

51
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,388
Take care

52
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,419
You look so ugly putting these clothes on

53
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,954
And you'll probably get a cold soon

54
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,591
Who are you talking about?

55
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,893
Of course is you. Need to say it again?

56
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,202
Save the money. You can't get cured

57
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,281
So late?

58
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:02,226
That lady told me
to change the clothes again. So tired

59
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,039
No

60
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,611
Let's go and eat something

61
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,818
Sorry. I gotta remove the makeup
for Queenie later

62
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,382
You're not her assistant

63
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,316
just her fitness coach

64
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,421
Miss Kong told me to look after Queenie

65
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,226
Leave her alone. Let's go

66
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,628
Have a meal together No...

67
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,860
Let's go

68
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,771
I don't want her misunderstood it

69
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:53,368
The contest now reaches the climax

70
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,376
Tonight's Princess
of Weight Watcher is...

71
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,211
No. 12, Miss Fei Tong!

72
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,421
Calm down. Put down your knife

73
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,119
Don't kill me. No!

74
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,219
It's totally useless killing him

75
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,459
You're so pretty and have a bright future

76
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:16,465
Shouldn't get in jail for this pervert

77
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,833
My husband's never a pervert

78
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,430
You bitch!
Say it again or I'll slash him!

79
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,873
No... don't do that. Cool it...

80
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:26,208
Dare let him go
and fight with me with a knife!

81
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,610
I'm not that stupid

82
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,171
You come and I'll slash him!

83
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,949
Stay calm...

84
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,247
Who'll be the Queen
of Weight Watcher tonight?

85
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,780
Louder!

86
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:42,655
Louder Cool it...

87
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:43,957
Hold on!

88
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,295
Turn up the television's volume!

89
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,094
Alright...

90
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,004
No. 10, Queenie

91
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:57,475
I guessed it would be her

92
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,679
Sure... these are all setups

93
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,850
How about turning it off?

94
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:06,882
Okay...

95
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:07,886
Butt out!

96
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,547
You dare to hit my husband!

97
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,718
I like to do it

98
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,054
Actually all of you're right...

99
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,354
Let's sit down and talk

100
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,827
He is right? He didn't divorce his wife

101
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,696
He said he'd buy me a flat
but it's a lie

102
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,824
You son of a bitch!

103
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,801
Oh no

104
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,463
You can't promise what you can't to women

105
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,770
A man always makes promise
when he's on the bed

106
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,975
You're right Butt out!

107
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,042
Miss, put down your knife

108
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,706
Or he'll easily get hurt

109
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,339
If you hurt him, we can do nothing...

110
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,145
but accuse you of damaging others

111
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,051
Better find a social worker to solve it

112
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,885
I'll shoot you dead and shoot myself

113
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,824
Come one

114
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,419
Have negotiation specialists come?

115
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,624
Have they come?

116
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,125
Have negotiation specialists come?

117
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,734
Come to die!

118
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,205
Let him go, or I'll shoot you
and shoot myself

119
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,501
Have you opened the safety lock?

120
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,713
Help me do it

121
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,587
Your hand that held the gun
is still shivering

122
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,856
Give me the cigarette

123
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,223
You'll see if your wife knows you smoke

124
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,633
Therefore I smoke now. Give me

125
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,770
Treasure the happy times, fat guy

126
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,765
Yes, sir

127
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,706
I'll be more careful next time

128
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,141
Next time?

129
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,689
You go first
I'm gonna write the report

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,588
No. Last time you wrote
so many wrong words

131
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,600
And I was blown up

132
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,760
Let me do it myself

133
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,563
Bastard! Crying for a whole night

134
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,145
Doesn't seem like water

135
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,987
That guy won't get home so early

136
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,458
It's better, though. Won't bother me

137
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,193
You forgot it? I can't take the pill

138
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,260
Or I'll be as fat as a pig

139
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:43,803
He can't use condom. He's allergic to it

140
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,342
No

141
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,669
I won't have baby. It's so painful

142
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,444
I'd rather live without children

143
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,654
I can only refuse him every time

144
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,690
He's back. Talk to you later

145
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:02,989
Many things to do

146
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,638
Darling, I'm back

147
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,735
I'm loaded. See how cool it is!

148
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,005
Don't pretend to be sleeping

149
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,745
Deeper breath means you're sleeping?

150
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,649
You snore while sleeping
Don't you know?

151
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:04,756
I'm telling you now...

152
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,587
No... I'm really sleeping

153
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:12,697
I'm very sleepy. Don't...

154
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:25,000
1, 2, 3, 4

155
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,802
What do you mean?

156
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,881
You know why
I am not in the safe period today

157
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,883
I'll be busy when you're in safe period

158
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,248
Then use the condom

159
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,118
I'm allergic to condom! How to use?

160
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,623
So let's sleep earlier

161
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,888
We have... not that staggering

162
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,259
2 months
We haven't done it for 2 months

163
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,894
Are you calculating this kind of stuff?

164
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,760
Did you marry me just for this?

165
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,062
No...

166
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,898
I gave up working as superintendent
just for you

167
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,164
You know how much I sacrificed?

168
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,638
If I went on I'd be the commissioner soon

169
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,107
You... do you wanna do what I did today?

170
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,610
Listen. Today

171
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,441
I was forced to turn on TV

172
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,539
Then they took my gun
and then they pissed me

173
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:04,514
Do you wanna do what I did today?

174
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,482
How come you speak so loud?

175
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,383
You're annoyed so you blow me up!

176
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,683
I speak loudly? You speak so loud first

177
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,349
Isn't it loud?

178
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,787
Alright, let me find a girl
with lower voice

179
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,251
Go ahead

180
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,355
You petty guy aren't willing
to treat them a cup of tea

181
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,628
Who wanna know you?

182
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,191
Sure. Who wanna know me?

183
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,068
I'm not petty. I'm a saver

184
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:28,073
It's virtue. Kindness

185
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:32,074
Alright... you're so kind
and have virtue...

186
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,835
How about...

187
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,646
sleeping outside?

188
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,312
What? I can't hear it clearly

189
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,081
You sleep outside

190
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:47,691
Listen. I will not sleep
outside the bedroom!

191
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,039
What's up?

192
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,643
Superiors have decided
to transfer Inspector Ma

193
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,373
He's gone and you should get promoted

194
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,710
I don't care

195
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:14,412
Promotion means salary up
but benefits cut

196
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,150
and take the blame for others. Let it go

197
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,782
Don't say it this way, sir

198
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,383
We're more confident if you get promoted

199
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,788
Talk about it later

200
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,409
Yes sir

201
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,821
What? Got crazy just when you got up?

202
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,220
No. Just have a morning dance

203
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,057
Let's dance together. Come on

204
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,928
No. I gotta go to the toilet

205
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:07,571
Good morning... Good morning...

206
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:09,096
How are you? Fine, thanks

207
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,806
You look so fine, Tak

208
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,010
Sure. Nice sleep last night

209
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,481
Thank you

210
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,836
Good morning...

211
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,540
Come here, Tak
Something to talk with you

212
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,748
Yes, sir

213
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,250
You already knew that Ma is transferred?

214
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,284
No... why do I know?

215
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,252
Coz he made a serious mistake

216
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,154
This post is still empty

217
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,094
One must lead 3 teams

218
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,232
It's vital Yes...

219
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,899
And in these 3 teams...

220
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,693
You're the most experienced one

221
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,436
So I hope you'll work hard...

222
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,839
Yes, sure...

223
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,443
to work for your new boss

224
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,410
New boss...

225
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,673
He's called William, former HQ member

226
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,820
He's a Dr. In criminal psychology

227
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,511
Are you okay?

228
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,586
You look shocked

229
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,053
Good. Good idea

230
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,087
Criminal Psychology... Dr., good

231
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,895
You gotta have a chat with him

232
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,531
Sir, I'm going if nothing special

233
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,035
Tak, one more thing

234
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,171
A reporter of a pop magazine in Mainland

235
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,770
comes to HK to take some info

236
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,639
I want you to help him
He's called Tin Fuk

237
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,979
The paparazzi are so mad

238
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,043
I won't work with him if he's one of them

239
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,919
I don't know. Just helping him will do

240
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,115
Which bastard thinks of this bullshit?

241
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,352
My wife! That's her nephew

242
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:16,761
So... your wife... so let me help him...

243
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:18,429
Tell him to find me, sir

244
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:19,999
I never force you, do I?

245
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,970
No... you don't...

246
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,671
Good morning...

247
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,448
What? How impolite

248
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,316
Sorry, sir. Got the wrong info

249
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,188
Doesn't matter. I won't blame you

250
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,987
More relaxed, Even better

251
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,527
You looked so glad...

252
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,222
It doesn't matter...

253
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,528
Give me a pair of gym shoes!

254
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,633
Reporting. Inspector Wong of CID has come

255
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,637
Inspector Wong

256
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,439
Give way, please...

257
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,399
Cheung... how long has he died?

258
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,938
Damn. Cheung hasn't died

259
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,146
Ask the coroner, you fool

260
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,518
Sir, where's Tak Wong in CID?

261
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,751
The 3rd floor upstairs

262
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,260
Thank you very much

263
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,927
Tak, 2 men find you Who?

264
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,694
One old-fashioned and one cool

265
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:02,731
Okay, thanks

266
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,506
Good morning, Tak... Good morning...

267
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,034
Are you Tak Wong?

268
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,275
Wait a second

269
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,646
Welcome... You're Tak Wong, right?

270
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,677
Sure. Just call me Tak

271
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,983
With your leadership...

272
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,149
I believe we'll have a huge progress

273
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,783
Thanks... I'm here to learn from you

274
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:28,884
You're welcome...

275
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,088
We're hardworking staff

276
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,395
Just a bit lack
in newest technologies and theories

277
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,461
This way...

278
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,534
This is your room

279
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:41,332
Do you mind calling you William?

280
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,199
I don't mind, but...

281
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,971
But I like to call myself Tin Fuk

282
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,773
Tin Fuk...

283
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:48,440
So you're Tin Fuk?

284
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,345
Yes, who do you think I am?

285
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,347
Nothing... I thought you're Tom Cruise

286
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,753
What can I do for you?

287
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,377
Let me introduce myself

288
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,714
I'm a reporter of Unveil in Mainland

289
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:03,187
Investigating a man
suspected of sexual abuse in Shanghai

290
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,924
He works in HK and the victim was killed

291
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:08,455
We'd like HK police to find him for us

292
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,594
Yes, this is Ken

293
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,772
You're Tak Wong? Who are you?

294
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,433
William, William Hung

295
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,846
Nice to meet you William Hung

296
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,742
This is Tin Fuk, right?

297
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,580
Come into my room

298
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,616
Can you give me a cup of milk tea?

299
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:32,855
Thanks

300
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,461
This is Ken

301
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,692
Suspected of a sexual abuse case
in Shanghai last year

302
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,863
He held an actress
into the dungeon for 15 days

303
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,395
giving her nothing to eat

304
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,374
The lady ran out
and reported to the police

305
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,671
The police then arrested Ken

306
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,508
But in the court
the girl refuted her own statements

307
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,577
Ken is then acquitted of a charge

308
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:02,144
We believe Ken gave her
a lot of money in advance

309
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,519
making her refute
the statements on purpose

310
00:22:04,923 --> 00:22:05,912
How about now?

311
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,616
Ken's found to have moved...

312
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,890
and is flirting
with a lady boss of a beauty company

313
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,758
We gotta know
if he's any link with this case

314
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,601
We'll help you as much as we can

315
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,895
But there's a strange murder case
here today

316
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,264
How strange?

317
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,633
It's famished

318
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:24,673
Famished?

319
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,589
What's up, Luck?

320
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,092
The dead's stomach
and throat was seriously hurt

321
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:45,562
Too much stomach acid...

322
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,224
Causes it to flow back

323
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,496
She's believed to have eaten very few...

324
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,936
and drunk so little when she's lost

325
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,030
I think it's the cause of death

326
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,439
Observing the hair follicle...

327
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,172
it may have stayed in a place
with high temperature

328
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,339
leading to dehydration of the body

329
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,682
And now she have 70 pounds left

330
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,544
70 pounds?

331
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,252
Yes, 70 pounds

332
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,715
One interesting finding

333
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,751
Her mouth was stuffed
with a piece of paper

334
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,919
What's that?

335
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,355
Have you been to the supermarket?

336
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,633
It's the price tag calculating the weight

337
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,494
Psycho

338
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,067
Many killers with abnormal psychology
in US act like this

339
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,869
They think they can control everything

340
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,942
They control the dead's body and behavior

341
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:36,311
Once they've succeeded
they'll probably do it again

342
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,874
You mean he'll break the law again?

343
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,778
Work or it'll happen again. Go

344
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,947
Can I work with you, Tak?

345
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,892
Can he work with us, sir?

346
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,085
No problem

347
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,024
Thank you

348
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,435
You haven't even lost a catty these weeks

349
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,911
Have you referred to the menu?

350
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm already 120 pounds. It's alright

351
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,710
But our aim is 113 pounds

352
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,545
Just editing the pics
in the computer is ok

353
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,826
Have you drunk any alcohol?

354
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,586
Mind your own business

355
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,722
But our contract says
that you can't drink, and...

356
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,495
can't take medicines
not prescribed by a doctor

357
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:32,662
Get out...

358
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:34,071
Piss off!

359
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,301
I got it

360
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,076
Miss Kong, I'm gonna quit

361
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,447
Do you know Ivy is dead?

362
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,848
How come?

363
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,451
The police have just been
to Forever Beauty

364
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,089
They'll come just then. Go prepare it

365
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,165
But Queenie's attitude...

366
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,764
Okay... talk with me tomorrow. Go

367
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,701
The cops are coming
You gotta go... from back door

368
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,375
Who are you looking for, sir?

369
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:22,579
Hello, I'm Inspector Tak Wong

370
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm gonna discuss a murder case
with your boss, miss Kong

371
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,886
What's wrong with the alarm?
Who opens the back door?

372
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,458
Sorry, sir. I gotta check the back door

373
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,592
Just sit down and tell me
where the door is

374
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,499
Over there

375
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,325
I'm going with you, sir

376
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,737
Just sit down here, sit down

377
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,410
Let him go... what a trouble...

378
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:54,417
Anything happened?

379
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,245
Sorry, miss

380
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,589
Don't take it...

381
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:10,990
So you've come here now?

382
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:13,730
That is Ken, isn't it?

383
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,747
Sorry... sorry...

384
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:37,388
Scared me

385
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,189
What a hit!

386
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,964
Lucky that I'm a policeman
If I were a wolf...

387
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,124
that's great

388
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,441
Bull

389
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:56,846
The one who ran is Ken

390
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,709
Ken? Who's he?

391
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,047
The one I'm looking for

392
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,658
Thank you very much

393
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:17,899
Call me if anything happens
Thank you...

394
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:20,336
You can call on me at any time
Thank you...

395
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,532
Sir...

396
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,107
Come on, talk something

397
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,337
Sir What's up?

398
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:27,542
What?

399
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:30,940
What to say in front of
2 senior barristers?

400
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,740
Just tell you their names

401
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:36,476
She said she's just
normal friends with Ken

402
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:40,049
They've been here so long
Ken's probably run

403
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:41,992
Still no Ken's departure record

404
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,688
I think he's still in HK

405
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,925
The cops have been finding you

406
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,032
Avoid them. Don't come out

407
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,558
You're back?

408
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,284
Still staying up?

409
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,954
You idiot. It's gonna be dawn now

410
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:20,962
Watching VCD

411
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,430
A housewife should watch VCDs

412
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,834
Or what else can I do?

413
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:27,326
What're you talking about?

414
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,806
A housewife has nothing to do
with other stuff but VCDs?

415
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,274
Go to sleep

416
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,416
Was that model really famished?
Yes

417
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,445
He must be a psycho

418
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,243
Of course. Dare to deny?

419
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,989
If he's not a psycho

420
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:48,993
can he do this kind of stuff? You...

421
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,726
He's not a psycho, I am

422
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,322
2 days later is ok. Is that good?

423
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,731
Keep your promise!

424
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,160
Go take a bath

425
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,499
According to criminal psychology

426
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:06,471
He left no traces in this action

427
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:09,912
It's so perfect. He must do it again

428
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,773
You mean he'll be mass murderer?

429
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:13,847
Yes

430
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,752
This kind of people
take killing as an art

431
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,880
They're usually nervous breakdown

432
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,085
lonely, and fleshless

433
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,291
How come? Why're they fleshless?

434
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,358
They usually forget to eat

435
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,762
which leads to malnutrition, so those...

436
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,737
who're fleshless can easily
be nervous breakdown

437
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,764
Nervous breakdown makes them even weaker

438
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,404
You think it like this?

439
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,432
What? It's not me

440
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,468
It's from a report
from Columbia University

441
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,110
What... what university?

442
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,378
Columbia University

443
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,815
Columbia University...

444
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,616
And they're not sociable

445
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:52,623
Hard for them to get along
with colleagues

446
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,750
Dreaming of being pursued every day

447
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,222
When did you read it?

448
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:00,656
When you're watching soccer matches

449
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,962
I thought you only know
how to put on makeup

450
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,767
According to criminal psychology...

451
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,374
The killer must be satisfied
with his performance

452
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,938
So he must act again

453
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,843
You study criminal psychology

454
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,715
Yes, I've just read a report...

455
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,883
from Columbia University

456
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,549
It says the fleshless people...

457
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,618
is easily be nervous breakdown

458
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,425
making them unable to eat

459
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:34,624
Unable to eat means they'll get weak

460
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,657
Get weak and be nervous breakdown

461
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,896
Nervous breakdown and they'll...

462
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,932
In a word, fleshless

463
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:44,036
You're so hard working. What a surprise

464
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,536
Yes, I love that...

465
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,771
Dr. Bin Laden

466
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,705
You've forgotten, honey

467
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,649
It's Dr. Shelton

468
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,413
Hello

469
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,449
Hello I am William

470
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,216
I'm Ling, Tak's wife

471
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:00,721
I worked as a police before

472
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:01,156
Really?

473
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,092
She worked here before

474
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:07,060
You're husband's good
in criminal psychology

475
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:12,793
Take a seat...

476
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,566
Take some food, thanks

477
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:18,038
Dr. Shelton

478
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,442
You study of criminal psychology, too

479
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,577
We women know nothing about it

480
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,411
It's my husband who tells me

481
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,577
He tells me when he's read the reports

482
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:32,347
He read a German
Dr. Ernest's report last week

483
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,756
His theories are similar to Dr. Shelton's

484
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,718
If you like them, I think you may even...

485
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:41,625
study the report written
by Robert. Ressler of FBI

486
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,690
I can lend it to you

487
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,860
Sure...

488
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,666
Honey. I'm here to tell you...

489
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:49,866
I've found an important clue

490
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:50,636
What is that?

491
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,142
Just discuss with us

492
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,942
The murderer is thin

493
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:58,210
If he dragged the 80-catty body
to the alley

494
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,443
He must need very much effort

495
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:00,948
So I believe...

496
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:03,920
the 1st crime scene is not far away
from the alley

497
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,258
And the body was not even
left traces of being dragged

498
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,784
Tak, I think we gotta set the boundary...

499
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,854
to the distance walking 5 minutes

500
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,226
from the alley

501
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,727
And we must keep an eye on the
spokespersons of Forever Beauty

502
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,101
Sisi and Fei Tong

503
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,507
I fear the killer will take them
as the next targets

504
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,339
How about this, director Chan

505
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,308
Fei Tong, you'll sit here...

506
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,614
So what'll I do then?

507
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,643
Eating

508
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,122
Eat again? Yes

509
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,826
Miss Si, Miss Lui

510
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,885
We're CID
We wanna record the statement with you

511
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,488
We're working, sir

512
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,666
It's about 10 minutes. Very quick

513
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,862
Let's finish these scenes first

514
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:57,403
Sir, how about asking you a question?

515
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,637
If correct
I'll record the statement right now

516
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,711
Is a dumpling masculine or feminine?

517
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:04,537
It's masculine. Why?

518
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,382
Coz it has phimosis!

519
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,090
Not funny? Sorry

520
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,955
Camera, action

521
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:21,231
Eat, and it will keep you young

522
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:26,935
Cut!

523
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:28,967
What's up?

524
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,634
I've played in the movie
for a whole month

525
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,439
Eating dumplings every day

526
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:35,070
Do I have any dialogue?

527
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,580
Haven't you seen the screenplay?

528
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,806
Speak when you have to. Now you don't

529
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:41,781
Eat'em! Hurry...

530
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,147
Sorry. Just kidding

531
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:44,785
Action!

532
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:08,442
No... director, I...

533
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:10,342
I gotta go to the toilet. I'm fed up

534
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,414
Need someone to go with you?

535
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,680
No. All human beings know
I master Muay Thai

536
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,655
Sometimes I'm even afraid of
my own ability

537
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:22,922
April

538
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,226
Don't be so passive

539
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,027
Feel dizzy once you see handsome guys?

540
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,533
What's up?

541
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,040
What happened?

542
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,310
Nothing, just gave a sigh

543
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,282
Crazy

544
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,261
Artists are all crazy

545
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:03,199
Sigh without reason. Crazy

546
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,462
Crazy again

547
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,316
What are you doing?

548
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,280
Playing Muay Thai

549
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,523
Nothing... I've eaten too many dumplings

550
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:29,148
Muay Thai can help digestion...

551
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,592
and keep the skin white

552
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:32,362
What's up, sir?

553
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,456
How about putting down your gun
and play it with me?

554
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,202
Not funny?

555
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,369
I'm going to the toilet. Bye!

556
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,714
Not yet. Can't wrap yet

557
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,724
Still long time to go

558
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,056
April

559
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,800
Do it 3 times?
Too bad if anyone marrying her

560
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,384
I'm a Mainland reporter
Can you give me an autograph?

561
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:32,389
I have interviews in HK

562
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,186
Mainland people also notice me!

563
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,848
I'm your fan

564
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,725
Help...

565
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:40,859
She's got trouble!

566
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,099
Are you okay?

567
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,333
Where's miss Si?

568
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,436
Somebody caught her...

569
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,464
Bull, tell all other spokespersons...

570
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,477
to stay in safe places and not to go out

571
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:54,239
Got it

572
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,178
You stay here I can help you...

573
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,772
Stay here!

574
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,686
Who?

575
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,623
I'm the cop who records
the statement this morning

576
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:55,895
It's you

577
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,041
Why hang up, Sisi? Got angry?

578
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,340
Sisi has trouble

579
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,140
Tell Queenie and other people
to stay in the Center

580
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,707
Queenie and I are in the Center
but the power is cut

581
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,013
I'm scared

582
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,052
Calm down. I'm coming

583
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,879
Lock the door and wait for me

584
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,885
Hurry, hurry...

585
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,218
I'm gonna see if Cherrie's fixed it

586
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,194
Goddamn! Stay with me!

587
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,414
It's me, Ken Is that you?

588
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,749
I'll let you go if you don't yell

589
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,045
Cherrie

590
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,992
Cherrie

591
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,859
I can only talk to you like this

592
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,094
Why are you here?

593
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,960
I wanna see you

594
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,195
Miss Kong misses you so much

595
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,174
We parted

596
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,472
You know I love you

597
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,842
The cops called me
and said they're coming

598
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,341
You gotta go

599
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,717
I won't go without you

600
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:31,161
If you do love me, listen to me. Go

601
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,927
What happened, Cherrie?

602
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,460
Don't play with me!

603
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,130
I won't go without you

604
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,305
You gotta go

605
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,336
Cherrie!

606
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,925
Are you okay?

607
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:06,722
Sure

608
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,637
Is it abduction?

609
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,407
Is it TV's funny program?

610
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,912
Are there many cameras shooting me?

611
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,139
Are you playing?

612
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,381
Then a host comes out and say I win

613
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:33,913
Give me car and house and something

614
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,255
Are you giving me anything?

615
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,951
No I don't want them. I just want money

616
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,596
$300,000 is enough. Stop it

617
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,030
Come out!

618
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,459
Do I look good? Where's my powder puff?

619
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,506
My powder puff's gone...

620
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,308
I gotta put on makeup!

621
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,245
I'm so scared...

622
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:10,083
Help me!

623
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:15,591
Let me go!

624
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,600
No problem

625
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,299
You meet my standard and you can go

626
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,235
Who are you? Where are you?

627
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,703
I can't see you

628
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,969
If you see me, you must die!

629
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,340
No... don't let me see you

630
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,612
I can't see you...

631
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,744
Let me go, please

632
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,253
You checked your weight, did you?

633
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,920
Yes...

634
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,686
Only 100 pounds. Thin enough

635
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,749
Not enough

636
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,453
You can go if you can be
70 pounds in a week

637
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,509
Did you kill Ivy?

638
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,246
She's just too weak to stand it

639
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:11,418
Don't kill me...

640
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:14,380
I can do whatever you want. No...
Okay

641
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:17,289
If you can make me laugh, you can go

642
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,092
When I was a child

643
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,769
I wanna be a model

644
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,964
but my career not good enough

645
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,941
Then I went to play comedies

646
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,604
Alright. If you can make me laugh
in 1 minute

647
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,703
I'll let you go

648
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,782
What does Bruce Lee like to say most?

649
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,452
Don't know? The answer is yelling

650
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:52,326
You know, when he fights
he says, Whatcha!

651
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,597
Yes. A riddle. Star Wars

652
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:02,236
Guess 2 objects

653
00:44:02,339 --> 00:44:03,271
What's the 1st one?

654
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,331
It's jewel!

655
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:09,278
Jewel...

656
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:13,348
How about another one?

657
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,015
It's ball? Why?

658
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,883
Ball...

659
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:28,128
Not funny? Sorry...

660
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,064
Let me think...

661
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,936
Got it. You must laugh this time

662
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,632
Once upon a time...

663
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,500
What? Why do you laugh?

664
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:43,377
1 minute is over, idiot

665
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,114
No... this is really funny
Listen to me...

666
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,311
Once upon a time...

667
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,226
Listen to me!

668
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:01,630
This is really funny...

669
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,568
You don't need to send me home

670
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,467
This is our duty. No problem

671
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,910
Top floor? You gotta walk many stairs

672
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,812
Cheap rent, and I can take it as a sport

673
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,050
You can go now

674
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,392
Sorry, I really don't wanna come in

675
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:35,159
But I wanna go to the washroom. Can I?

676
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,329
Sorry, my home is a mess

677
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:47,504
Excuse me, the washroom...

678
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,171
Over there Thanks

679
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,551
Renowned spokesperson
of fitness company Sisi...

680
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,522
was help captive from the scene...

681
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,580
of Media Art at 3 am

682
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,559
Her assistant was hurt
and is now in the hospital

683
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,620
We'll now ask the chief inspector
Mr. Wilson Chow

684
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,292
Is this case related
to that case of Ivy last time?

685
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:15,868
We assume that the 2 cases...

686
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,936
Thank you

687
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:23,304
Are you okay?

688
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,276
Can I lean on your shoulder for a while?

689
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,162
Did you...
study in Pui Yin Secondary School?

690
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,399
Why do you ask it?

691
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,404
Because I did study there

692
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,945
You look weak...

693
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:04,016
but you got the gold medal
in shot put. Cool

694
00:47:04,688 --> 00:47:07,384
It's about technique, not power

695
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,749
Technique? Really?

696
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:11,818
Which year did you graduate?

697
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,892
Did you ever see me in school?

698
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,559
No, I didn't
And which year did you graduate?

699
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,227
Maybe I didn't ever notice you

700
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,135
So many gals noticed me

701
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:23,800
I don't think so!

702
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,830
You finally laugh

703
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,775
Talk on phone later. Goodbye

704
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,834
Goodbye

705
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,430
Bull, where's Tak?

706
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,191
Wanna drink some soup?

707
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:25,795
Inspector Chow's scolding inside

708
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,036
What happened?

709
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,734
Sisi's dead, with legs chopped off

710
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,936
How come?

711
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,443
They said Sisi is just
70 pounds without legs

712
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:43,277
I said he'd do it again

713
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,648
Any traces found at the scene?

714
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:46,685
No

715
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,882
More perfect this time

716
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,887
Why's it become so big?

717
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,558
Sure. I can't get in charge of big deals

718
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,157
Do small stuff for the rest of my life

719
00:48:57,534 --> 00:49:00,002
The case will be transferred
to Inspector Tit

720
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,205
Still pretending to be cool? How?

721
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:07,872
Tak

722
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,310
Your wife's come. Go have a chat

723
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,940
Come on... nothing

724
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:15,878
Have some soup

725
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,385
No appetite

726
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,522
It's just their business

727
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:31,528
Why're you so angry?

728
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,264
Damn it. Their business

729
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,303
I've been doing small jobs

730
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:41,677
Now it's getting bigger
and is then transferred

731
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,077
Aren't they pointing against me?

732
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,413
Why do they point against you?

733
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,433
You murderer!

734
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:48,933
You murderer!

735
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,374
When I hold a gun...

736
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:53,814
I feel frozen and can't say a word

737
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:00,950
Go tell the doctor

738
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,186
What? Doctor?

739
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,218
I'll get fired if other know it

740
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,993
I think it's work pressure

741
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:10,827
You still have many leaves
Better take some

742
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:11,856
No

743
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,997
I must catch that guy
red-handed this week

744
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,272
Or else I'll be a pawn
for the rest of my life

745
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,404
Excuse me, I wanna lose weight

746
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:28,941
Do you have many kinds of treatment?

747
00:51:28,986 --> 00:51:30,613
Please introduce some

748
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,624
Can I help you, Mrs. Wong?

749
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:40,556
My pal said it costs
a lot for the 1st time

750
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,529
Need $100,000 or more?

751
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:44,728
Hello, my name's Cherrie
I'm the consultant

752
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,632
Are you Mrs. Wong?

753
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,761
Yes, I am

754
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:49,329
Take a bath and have a sauna

755
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:51,273
I'll give you treatment
on lymphatic system

756
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:54,233
Are there many renowned spokespersons?

757
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,142
I like stars so much

758
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,980
They often come
when there're few customers

759
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:03,585
Can you tell me
when they'll come? Thank you

760
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,951
I don't take tips

761
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,023
I'll try my best. Follow me

762
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,026
Thank you very much

763
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,458
The 1st victim is Ivy...

764
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,456
then Sisi the 2nd

765
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,395
If counting in fame

766
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:25,400
the least famous is Ivy

767
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,367
the next is Fei Tong

768
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:39,552
Honey

769
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,317
Wait... What?

770
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,294
Come on, in the middle...

771
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,023
Ready? Are you ready?

772
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:47,860
Sure

773
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,667
What? You brought me flowers

774
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,240
You... why're you so romantic suddenly?

775
00:52:57,541 --> 00:53:00,339
Don't you remember? We'll do it tonight

776
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,706
I remember

777
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:03,735
Alright...

778
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,010
Wait... listen to me now...

779
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,882
We only talk about romance, not others

780
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,580
Okay, Talk for a whole night
after this...

781
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,589
Listen to me Put off your clothes...

782
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:17,487
Talk about this... No...

783
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,188
Wait... What?

784
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,254
Give me some time. It's quick

785
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,461
Okay... hurry up, hurry up...

786
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,939
I just thought
you'd take some underwear out

787
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:40,709
The people suspected in the case
Friend of Fitness...

788
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:44,151
Forever Beauty, 1, 2, 3, 4...

789
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,119
Good enough?

790
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,118
You reconstructed the case?

791
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,559
Cool. It's professional...

792
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,192
Better than the police. Look...

793
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,596
Look at the colors. Have all needed

794
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,930
It's so good to frame it here
Okay...

795
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,128
I know you're not admiring me

796
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,137
Kidding only. Kidding

797
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,969
Kidding? You've been looking down on me

798
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:05,167
It was really a joke

799
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,142
I'm not arguing with you tonight

800
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,008
Let's talk about romance. Take them away

801
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:10,376
You always think of these things

802
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,005
You know how much I've thought?

803
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,346
How much? You just wrote down...

804
00:54:14,384 --> 00:54:16,750
These things... This is the truth

805
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,286
No... I really...

806
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,619
I shouldn't have said that, okay?

807
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,148
You always think I'm trash
I'm not...

808
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,252
You think I'm a fool!
What're you talking about?

809
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,694
I'm here not to argue with you...

810
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:28,425
I've spent so much time
but you just took a glimpse

811
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:29,432
Why are you so angry?

812
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,127
Look, what do you look like?

813
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:32,635
You idiot!

814
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:34,360
You hit me?

815
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:35,564
I'm gonna call the police

816
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,163
I don't wanna talk with you. Go out

817
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:39,437
What? What do you say?

818
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,005
I won't go out

819
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,810
I say I won't and I won't say it again

820
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,113
I'm lying here. See what you can do

821
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:55,054
Come on baby, come on

822
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,728
Don't trouble me!

823
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:17,673
You'll see

824
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,334
I'm back to mum's place

825
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:58,083
What should I do? I made her go

826
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:03,252
As a gentleman, I shouldn't act like this

827
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:06,421
She investigated the case. No big deal

828
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:08,124
She goes. What should I do?

829
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,928
Kick the bucket

830
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,595
What's wrong with investigation?

831
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:16,470
Just show her talent

832
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:20,067
Why acted on impulse?
Should apologize to her last night

833
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,238
Sorry, it's my fault

834
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,838
That'd be alright

835
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:28,112
It's seven years after we got married

836
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,482
We've gone through ups and downs...

837
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,146
Have you finished?

838
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:33,483
I've heard it. No need to be so loud

839
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,833
Sorry

840
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,306
Hide the necklace or you can't cheat me

841
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,574
I forgot. Too bad

842
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:56,277
Where do you go?

843
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,145
Go to lavatory and then mum's place

844
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,173
It's your mum's birthday?
You've dressed up

845
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,645
Just for your sincerity
let you off this time

846
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:07,213
You do?

847
00:57:07,991 --> 00:57:09,015
You do?

848
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,193
What's the matter?
You do? Then I make it

849
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:13,627
What?

850
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,221
You agreed last night

851
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:18,229
It's just expired

852
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,235
Expired? This isn't the milk

853
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,738
I don't care about that. C'mon

854
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,672
This time no

855
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:26,437
No? No more excuse. C'mon

856
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:27,909
I've put on the necklace

857
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,343
Put it off

858
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,812
Why?

859
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,109
Why don't you put it off?
That'll bring bad luck

860
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,809
Why don't you put it off?

861
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,545
Put it off and open the door

862
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:36,950
Quiet

863
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,283
You can still put it off

864
00:57:38,321 --> 00:57:40,755
Quiet, please

865
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,640
Can't imagine...
there're so many negative news...

866
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,409
but still
there're so many people coming here

867
00:58:06,082 --> 00:58:07,879
The influence of media's really great?

868
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,646
There're 7 or 8 magazines
inviting them to take pix

869
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,555
Look. They don't eat nor sleep

870
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,649
How can they stand it?

871
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,158
You've worked for a long time
Take a break

872
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:26,359
I got to enjoy every moment
when I see Fei

873
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,432
Why don't you date her?

874
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,838
Why don't you have affair instead?

875
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,542
She and I are different

876
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,208
She looks perfect from this point

877
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:41,279
But she doesn't if I get closer

878
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:43,385
You have good imagination

879
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,415
Doesn't it sound good?

880
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,284
But you'd be disappointed

881
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,552
Paparazzi aren't entertaining

882
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:54,222
Those interviewees
either feel unhappy...

883
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,093
or hate us

884
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,394
Anyway we can't make them happy

885
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:03,069
Then you should change your job

886
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:05,404
You look smart. You can be an artist

887
00:59:05,442 --> 00:59:06,875
Brad Pitt can't compare to you

888
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,347
Paparazzi?

889
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,741
They're from Pau Magazine

890
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:18,920
I knew them when doing reporting
of Pitt and Aniston

891
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:19,646
I drive them away

892
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,385
Don't... let them take pix

893
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,461
Yes

894
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:30,831
Yes

895
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:33,499
What? So awful

896
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:35,971
Got it

897
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:37,296
What's the matter?

898
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:39,904
Nothing. We got wind of the case

899
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,567
Ken's in a car dump. They go catch him

900
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:44,643
Let's go

901
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,444
Don't. Too many cooks spoil the broth

902
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,314
Back to the station
to see if they make it

903
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,818
Doing less is the best

904
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:57,750
What? Who's this?

905
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,061
Not sure. No number displayed

906
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:00,824
It must be those gals

907
01:00:00,864 --> 01:00:04,925
It says Ken is in 103
Lai Ching Villa, Mau Shing Street

908
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,600
Need to tell Inspector Tit?

909
01:00:08,705 --> 01:00:10,536
No. If these are fake then we're over

910
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,370
The team's gone. Don't tell him

911
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:13,441
So what should we do?

912
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,003
Let's go to see now

913
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,206
How about the gals? Right

914
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,682
You go and I stay here

915
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:27,052
Call me if anything happens
Give you a chance

916
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:27,852
No thanks

917
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:29,756
I have my wife

918
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,428
There's half an hour left

919
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:47,142
Last night...
didn't find you in the bulletin

920
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,335
Didn't you? I didn't

921
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,041
But I looked carefully

922
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,050
I found you look different

923
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,887
But I think you were more beautiful

924
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:01,088
Don't laugh at me

925
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,385
I think you're bushed
after working a couple of days

926
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:09,930
No I don't but I worry what's going on

927
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:12,958
Don't worry. I'll protect you

928
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,102
Sorry, we don't rent to a couple of men

929
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,436
CID

930
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:50,698
Sorry sir...

931
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,971
I'm so sorry...

932
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,616
Sorry... I'm so sorry...

933
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:42,888
Ken!

934
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:52,924
Ken! You can't run. Put your arms down

935
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,912
Don't go. Get back!

936
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,987
You murderer!

937
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:21,461
Repay my son's hatred!

938
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:38,380
Shit...

939
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:57,897
Are you okay?

940
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:07,943
How can you take us home
at the same time, sir?

941
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,307
Miss Lui...

942
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,812
Tell your assistant
to drive the car to get here

943
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,043
We follow your cars

944
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,678
My car's there and I drive it to get here

945
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:17,515
Thanks

946
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:30,862
When're you available? I buy you dinner

947
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,330
Sure

948
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,200
But...

949
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:36,467
don't tell anyone that I was ugly

950
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,172
You've told that?

951
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,608
No. Don't worry

952
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,412
It may be my car alarm. I go take a look

953
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,214
Stay in the car. Lock the car up

954
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,687
Start the engine and wait for me

955
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,095
Miss...

956
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:05,395
Miss!

957
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:11,373
He's been out so long
Does he have trouble?

958
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,772
We'd better go

959
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,269
Better wait for a while

960
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,743
Sure. Wait for a while

961
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,268
It's useless to wait

962
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,205
Let me go to see them

963
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,442
Go ahead, but I only wait 5 minutes

964
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:26,819
I'll drive away after 5 minutes

965
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,623
Okay

966
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,532
What's wrong with Bull?

967
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,234
How's Tin Fuk?

968
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:59,846
His arm and some ribs are broken
It isn't too serious

969
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,012
How about the gals?

970
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,253
Queenie and Fei are missing

971
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,386
Cherrie's in the room

972
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,189
I go have a look

973
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:16,720
Ling

974
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,295
I know her

975
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:31,135
Cherrie

976
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:35,342
It's you

977
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,181
I'm Tak's wife
He's responsible for this case

978
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,718
I went to Friend of Fitness...

979
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,950
just for any clues

980
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:45,425
Sorry

981
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,020
Take the murderer as soon as possible

982
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,195
Save Fei and Cherrie

983
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,191
We'll do our best. Don't worry

984
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,733
You should take a rest

985
01:07:55,671 --> 01:07:57,070
But I'm so scared

986
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,664
It's so terrible

987
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,040
I'm so scared!

988
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,604
I understand

989
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,247
You can try to... sleep for a while

990
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:11,651
Have a sweet dream
Tomorrow's another day

991
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:45,044
Who is she?

992
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,986
Bull's mother

993
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,083
Is she okay?

994
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:52,787
Very sad

995
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:54,959
Sure

996
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,356
Me too

997
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,565
I know

998
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:04,671
The saddest thing is...

999
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:07,869
that I can't be too sad in front of her

1000
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,835
If I'm too sad...

1001
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:13,574
she may not be able to stand it

1002
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,747
Bull has been working with me for years

1003
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,888
He's been following me
when he entered CID...

1004
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,250
Sorry, it's such a mess

1005
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:52,854
What... this is a mess?

1006
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,782
Thank you for going out with me

1007
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,090
We're friends now

1008
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:04,899
Do you have something to ask me?

1009
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:09,633
What's the relationship
between you and Ken?

1010
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,506
He's been seeking
after me but I refuse

1011
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,515
And he hasn't given up

1012
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,774
Does he give you money?

1013
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,517
I don't get the money
I don't love him

1014
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,225
Has he ever sought after other models?

1015
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,290
I think not

1016
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,762
Then he's quite devoted to you

1017
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:42,765
We need you to save Queenie and Fei

1018
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,336
He's been sending phone messages to me

1019
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,574
But I never answer any

1020
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:52,746
I got another one today

1021
01:10:55,651 --> 01:10:57,278
Meet in Hunghom station at 5 today

1022
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:58,377
Lure him out

1023
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,093
Team A, has the shop been open?

1024
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:15,265
Yes but no customer

1025
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,006
Team B, is the glass clean?

1026
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:20,166
Clean

1027
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,870
Team C, finished the breakfast?

1028
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,172
Not yet

1029
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,346
Keeping an eye on the kitten
She looks nervous

1030
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28,447
Team A got it Team B got it

1031
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:29,684
Team C got it

1032
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:32,284
The kitten's got a call

1033
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:33,753
Should be SMS

1034
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,289
Team B, have you seen the mouse?

1035
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:37,856
Not yet...

1036
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:41,558
Perhaps the SMS tells the kitten
where to dine out

1037
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,459
Follow her?

1038
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:48,665
Yes

1039
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:52,800
Keep an arm's distance
Don't alert the kitten

1040
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,010
Team A, any mouse?

1041
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,074
No

1042
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,414
The kitten gets off the car, Tak

1043
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:08,854
It seems that she switches the place

1044
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:12,549
What's she doing?

1045
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,123
The kitten gets on the minibus
Follow her?

1046
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,356
Wait a minute...

1047
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:18,559
No minibus. Enter station
then go into tunnel

1048
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:22,696
Shit! The mouse's found us

1049
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,866
Team A, ambush the kitten Got it!

1050
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,804
Team B... attention. The kitten's coming

1051
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,174
You go back. There's accident

1052
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,253
Tak, the kitten gets in the subway

1053
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,454
Keep an eye on the kitten. I'm coming

1054
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,414
Report location...

1055
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:09,281
Where're you?

1056
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:22,895
Where?

1057
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:29,864
Tak, can you hear me?

1058
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,238
Team C, the kitten
is going to your point

1059
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:34,003
Got it

1060
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,162
Tak... he's run away

1061
01:14:05,908 --> 01:14:06,897
Report location

1062
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,236
We're inside the bus

1063
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:17,778
Friend of Fitness?

1064
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:24,689
Where are you?

1065
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:26,521
We're going to Chatham Road

1066
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,960
I'm Tak Wong
I'm not available at the moment...

1067
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:34,464
I'm going to Friend of Fitness, Tak
Join me, quick

1068
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,100
No...

1069
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:42,468
Help...

1070
01:15:42,504 --> 01:15:43,562
Stop!

1071
01:15:43,972 --> 01:15:45,599
Stop. Police!

1072
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,668
Help... Stop!

1073
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:57,144
Stop!

1074
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:05,692
Police! Stop!

1075
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,262
Help...

1076
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:15,497
What's up? Cherrie's inside

1077
01:16:23,212 --> 01:16:25,703
Don't worry, hold... hold on

1078
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:34,978
Is that Ken?

1079
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,990
Ran at the back door
You look after her

1080
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:38,259
It's okay

1081
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,235
Okay

1082
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,700
You'd better get home

1083
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,469
I'll work so long tonight

1084
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,043
Let me send her home. She lives near us
Sure

1085
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,077
Call me if anything happens

1086
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:46,888
You gotta sleep early tonight

1087
01:17:47,262 --> 01:17:48,923
I don't know if I can sleep

1088
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,198
Come in if you're free

1089
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,837
Sure. I'm still staying up
Let's have a chat

1090
01:18:02,945 --> 01:18:05,072
How are you going?

1091
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,072
It's heard that Ken ran again

1092
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:10,043
Yes... we're searching for him

1093
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,885
My paparazzi friends
in Hong Kong sent me a tape

1094
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:17,517
It's about Fei Tong

1095
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,351
I don't know if it's useful

1096
01:18:19,895 --> 01:18:22,659
I've sent them to police

1097
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:23,630
Look

1098
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,424
Tak, it's for you

1099
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:32,005
Look

1100
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,004
Serve yourself, I change clothes

1101
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:41,574
Okay

1102
01:19:14,516 --> 01:19:16,381
Read these rare books

1103
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,619
The Fitness Consultant Cherrie

1104
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:35,027
and I were in the same college
but 2 forms lower

1105
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:36,189
Such a coincidence

1106
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:37,797
But at that time...

1107
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,914
No wonder she's a fitness consultant now

1108
01:21:00,956 --> 01:21:03,083
Mess things up? What a savage

1109
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:29,811
Are you human being?

1110
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:32,279
Ken loves you so much
but you don't go with him?

1111
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,083
Remember the ballet team in college?

1112
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:36,449
You're so fat

1113
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:43,728
You're more than 70 pounds?

1114
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:45,524
Totally different from other classmates

1115
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:48,827
You can't participate in the X'mas Ball

1116
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,002
Come if you keep under 70 pounds

1117
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:58,740
Remember the attitude
of the manager last time?

1118
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:01,147
Do you remember?

1119
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:02,944
Do you remember!

1120
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:04,747
We'll call you later

1121
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,355
So fat, still want to be an OL

1122
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:14,395
You'll never able to give birth, hurray

1123
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,828
You're happy, you're happy now?

1124
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:18,695
I've checked your body

1125
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,293
You've taken too many pills for slimming

1126
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:25,998
which affect your kidney and liver

1127
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,373
You'll never be able to have baby

1128
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:33,471
Now is my turn

1129
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:36,443
You must revenge

1130
01:22:56,504 --> 01:23:08,382
70 pounds...

1131
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,086
They spend so much...

1132
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:24,426
to lose weight. What do they do for?

1133
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:26,195
Flattering the guys

1134
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:31,305
I'm working on it with Cherrie

1135
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,536
It doesn't work. It's not fair

1136
01:23:35,777 --> 01:23:38,143
Everyone should have 70 pounds to be fair

1137
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:40,671
Why don't you be one of them?

1138
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,445
You're the one inside Cherrie?

1139
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:47,148
I'm much cleverer

1140
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:49,287
I just give Ken something

1141
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,383
then he helps me to deal with those women

1142
01:23:58,934 --> 01:24:00,128
Help me!

1143
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:01,430
I did them...

1144
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:03,427
I did them all!

1145
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:13,140
Cherrie, wake up

1146
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:17,082
You can't let it control you. Wake up

1147
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:20,148
Don't stop. You're right

1148
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,656
Go ahead!

1149
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,386
No phone number displayed

1150
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,192
Miss!

1151
01:24:42,844 --> 01:24:44,072
What's up?

1152
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:10,502
Help... It's me!

1153
01:25:11,072 --> 01:25:13,472
I can't control myself...

1154
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:15,208
I did them all!

1155
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:29,523
I'm Tak Wong
I'm not available at the moment

1156
01:25:29,557 --> 01:25:30,581
Please leave a message

1157
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,651
Inspector Wong
we got Ken's body in Friend of Fitness

1158
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:35,255
The forensic is coming

1159
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:49,071
You're sick
See the doctor and you'll be okay

1160
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:38,683
Shoot me

1161
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:41,782
Shoot me!

1162
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:47,626
Why don't you shoot me?

1163
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,155
Coz you have no bullets

1164
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,601
Why do you know?

1165
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:56,098
It isn't your turn now!

1166
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,921
I forget it, sorry

1167
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,421
Honey... you scared me

1168
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:23,691
Are you okay?

1169
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:29,731
Do you get hurt?

1170
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:31,430
Okay

1171
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:32,295
Let's go

1172
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:34,774
Why don't your hands shiver?

1173
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,171
No. They've been shivering

1174
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:40,106
Let's go. Call back-up, quick

1175
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:44,014
She's nervous breakdown
She has dual personality

1176
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:46,646
That's not the original Cherrie

1177
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:48,219
Gotta save her

1178
01:28:48,523 --> 01:28:50,491
Don't worry. I didn't kill her

1179
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:51,514
Call an ambulance

1180
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:53,521
Thank you

1181
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,105
Tea time!

1182
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:15,371
What? You're free

1183
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:16,948
Need to do nothing?

1184
01:29:16,985 --> 01:29:18,612
Sure Sure?

1185
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,010
Go find some

1186
01:29:21,055 --> 01:29:23,046
Go home and do it
