00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,501
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,520
- [Narrator] The following
is based on a true story.

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,550
Some names have been changed.

4
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:25,216
(slow paced music)

5
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:37,774
(indistinct chatter)

6
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:56,364
- Ouch, that hurt!

7
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:59,114
I'm telling mom when we get home!

8
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,420
- Alright, let's keep it down
to a dull roar back there!

9
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,116
- We're just having fun Edward.

10
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:09,345
- Y'all acting like a
barrel full of monkeys.

11
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:11,764
(kid imitating monkey)

12
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:14,014
(laughing)

13
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,220
The monkey business gotta stop

14
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,033
or we're staying right here!

15
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,683
- You can't do that.

16
00:02:48,072 --> 00:02:51,072
(children laughing)

17
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,880
- No more monkey business.

18
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,923
I'm the monkey in charge here okay?

19
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,283
Sit.

20
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:04,643
Stay.

21
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,477
You too.

22
00:03:15,477 --> 00:03:18,477
(children laughing)

23
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:21,381
You too.

24
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:25,649
Okay.

25
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,168
(slow paced music)

26
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:53,480
- How much did we pay for this one?

27
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,680
- [Blonde] 350.

28
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,660
- I put 180 in so far,

29
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,610
what do you figure?

30
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,083
I say we ask 1,000 firm.

31
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,530
- Alright, that's what, $500 profit?

32
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,780
- [Blonde] If we sell it.

33
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,930
- Split three ways, that's nothing.

34
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,445
- Your folks home?

35
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,740
- I don't know, my grandma is though.

36
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,573
Why?

37
00:04:20,573 --> 00:04:21,580
- I don't know.

38
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,190
What you gonna do tonight?

39
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,280
- I don't know, nothing I guess.

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,223
- [Narrator] Your mom and
dad want us home for dinner.

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,260
- How much you figure we made this month?

42
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,430
- Not enough.

43
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,580
This isn't working too good.

44
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,180
These things just aren't moving.

45
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,580
- I need some money.

46
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,110
I need some money bad.

47
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,070
- What are you talking about?

48
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,800
Your parents got more money than God.

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
- Yeah, well my folks have
had so much for so long

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,730
that they don't think much of money.

51
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,560
They live like dirt farmers.

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,008
- Yeah.

53
00:04:48,008 --> 00:04:49,650
I guess 78 acres of dirt,

54
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,393
richest suburb of San Francisco.

55
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,030
This place is worth
more than Rhode Island.

56
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,720
- I can hit up my grandma though.

57
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,583
I'd have to lie.

58
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,493
I could do that.

59
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,280
- Maybe if I got some money I could get

60
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,410
my parents off my back.

61
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,390
I'm supposed to be a podiatrist
like dear old dad you know.

62
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,210
- You gonna live for now man.

63
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,060
Risk, daring, it all comes
to the fast and the strong.

64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,450
That is who makes it in this world.

65
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,620
The bold and the daring.

66
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,443
- Like you and your old cars huh?

67
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,232
You're very bold and daring.

68
00:05:27,878 --> 00:05:29,913
(grunting)

69
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,793
- [Jim] What'd you do that for?

70
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:32,626
You okay?

71
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,389
- Okay, so the car
thing ain't working out.

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,443
There's got to be way
to score some big money.

73
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:51,290
(horn honking)

74
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,183
- Talk about it later, I gotta go.

75
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,940
- Yeah, go home to mommy and daddy.

76
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:06,431
(slow paced music)

77
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,600
- You know Odessa, sometimes
I feel like I've got

78
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,030
all a man could ever need.

79
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,090
Take a look, it's not much, but it's ours.

80
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,493
Come here my darling Hannah.

81
00:06:42,597 --> 00:06:43,440
We have a beautiful daughter,

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,253
and a beautiful grandchild.

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,220
Yes, and a beautiful wife.

84
00:06:51,153 --> 00:06:53,830
- Oh, I told the girls
down at work that if

85
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,170
you ever won the lottery,

86
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,830
you'd probably just buy a new
battery for that old tractor.

87
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,350
- Maybe, and a new transmission
for the old school bus.

88
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,670
- Look, Lee's coming by
for Hannah in an hour

89
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,910
and they're gonna stay for dinner.

90
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,000
Now Hannah, you tell grandpa be sure to

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
get washed up and ready.

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,190
- Hannah, you tell her that
I'll be done in 20 minutes.

93
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,860
- I think it's about time you started

94
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,070
putting your nose to the grindstone Fred.

95
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,190
Frankly, you're becoming an embarrassment

96
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,040
and I won't have it.

97
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,670
You've been given everything,

98
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,140
now do something with it

99
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,750
instead of squandering it away--

100
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,650
- You were giving everything too.

101
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,130
What do you do?

102
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,490
- What's that supposed to mean?

103
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,260
- You inherited everything from Grandma,

104
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,820
so why are you acting like you earned

105
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,070
everything on your own?

106
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,640
- Don't use that tone with me young man.

107
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,980
I've worked.

108
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,430
I run this quarry and I run this family.

109
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,463
Fred enough.

110
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,463
- You need to prove you're
worthy of our family name.

111
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,470
It's an old name, a proud name.

112
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,610
We've been a part of the
history of this state

113
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,160
since the gold rush and
I won't have my only son

114
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,470
treat his heritage like the dole.

115
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,500
You just seem to have one harebrained,

116
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,820
worthless scheme after another.

117
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:22,019
(slow paced music)

118
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,120
(horse neighs)

119
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,210
- You're leaving again dad?

120
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,483
- Rodeo up at Calgary.

121
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,472
- Can I go?

122
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,710
- No, you got school and you
gotta be man of the house

123
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,543
while I'm gone.

124
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,423
Well maybe I don't want to
be the man of the house.

125
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,470
- Times gonna come when
you gotta measure up

126
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,230
to being a man whether
you're ready or not.

127
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,780
Life doesn't always wait on ya.

128
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,920
Here, why don't you load
up that other horse for me

129
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,520
while I say goodbye to your mom.

130
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:26,794
Go on.

131
00:09:46,094 --> 00:09:48,677
(horse neighs)

132
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:52,823
Whoa whoa Tim!

133
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,672
Come on Tim, you gotta
show that horse who's boss.

134
00:09:57,672 --> 00:09:58,505
- [Mom] Jack.

135
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,750
- He's spooked some dad!

136
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,160
- Spooked?

137
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,090
Easy.

138
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:04,390
- You're being a little
hard on him aren't ya?

139
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,287
- Yeah well maybe you're being
a little too soft on him.

140
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:15,856
- Come on mom.

141
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,090
- Still think we could
renovate this place?

142
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,463
- Yeah we could.

143
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:29,490
But we don't even have
enough for the down payment.

144
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,566
- Oh I think my grandma
on cough up the dough.

145
00:10:32,566 --> 00:10:34,270
But think about how much work it is.

146
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,270
I got a better idea.

147
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,183
- What?

148
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,430
Use grandma's money, make some big money.

149
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,083
- [Jim] Yeah right, how?

150
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,313
- A movie.

151
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,793
We come up with a story, produce it.

152
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,030
- What do we know about making movies?

153
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,610
- Nothing, who does?

154
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,360
I got a friend at film
school says it's a breeze.

155
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,193
You know what they make.

156
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,157
People like stories
about crime and violence.

157
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:06,340
- I saw this Clint
Eastwood movie last week.

158
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,783
They hijacked this bunch
of kids, it was great.

159
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,633
- Kids.

160
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,193
That's really smart.

161
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,350
People would pay ransom
right away for kids.

162
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,350
- Yeah, but they blew
it in the movie Fred.

163
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,893
- Yeah, yeah, but if you did it right,

164
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,773
really planned it.

165
00:11:27,446 --> 00:11:29,020
See that's where they always screw up.

166
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,770
They're stupid, they don't plan it.

167
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,550
You remember that busload
of kids that crashed?

168
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,393
How upset everyone was?

169
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,170
For a bus full of kids you
could get a million dollars.

170
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,003
Easy.

171
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,200
- What the heck, two million.

172
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,810
- Three million huh?

173
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,450
- Five million.

174
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,033
Five million dollars from
the state of California.

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,450
Let's plan it.

176
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,170
See if it can work.

177
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,203
- That's crazy.

178
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,973
- Yeah we are.

179
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,490
But what else you got to do?

180
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:07,453
It's just a game.

181
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,780
See if we can come up with something.

182
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,400
- Come up with what?

183
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,283
A movie on a crime?

184
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,260
(ominous music)

185
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,093
- A crime.

186
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,493
A perfect crime.

187
00:12:22,728 --> 00:12:25,395
(ominous music)

188
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,952
(slow paced music)

189
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,600
- [Brunette] Just like clockwork.

190
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,029
- You did too!

191
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:43,980
I'm telling mom!

192
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,130
- I got your peanut butter fix for ya.

193
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,963
Kisses.

194
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,689
- Hey mom!

195
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:50,980
- You better not.

196
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,480
- No fighting.

197
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,370
You have homework?

198
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,330
- [Girl] I don't but Peter does!

199
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,263
- How would you know anyway?

200
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:01,623
- Mom, he hit me!

201
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,800
He's been a pest all day!

202
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,633
- She's lying!

203
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:06,183
She's just trying to get me in trouble!

204
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:07,610
- Stop it!

205
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,350
I come home from work
and you two start it up,

206
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,770
the both of you, fight fight fight.

207
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,393
Just cool it.

208
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,290
- [Fred] All right Jim come
on, you've got enough time.

209
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,440
What do you got for me?

210
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,540
- I've looked through hundreds of pages

211
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,240
of County section Maps,

212
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,100
I finally found the perfect place.

213
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,060
Chowchilla.

214
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,750
It's remote, it's got
plenty of escape routes,

215
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,063
far from the law, and just the right size.

216
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,653
- Taking this a little bit
serious for a game aren't you?

217
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,720
- This is excellent work Jim.

218
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,180
Attention to detail.

219
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,570
I like it.

220
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,713
How far is this place?

221
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:54,413
- It's only three hours from here.

222
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,560
- Let's go for a ride.

223
00:13:59,087 --> 00:14:01,670
(bell ringing)

224
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,780
This is good.

225
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,120
- This is ridiculous.

226
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,360
Come on, let's go home.

227
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,260
- Come on, relax, what's the big deal?

228
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:38,060
Man can you believe this place is only

229
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,663
three hours from Portola Valley?

230
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:42,270
The kids though.

231
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,410
- Too many kids.

232
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,060
Too many people around here
and way too much traffic.

233
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,500
- Summer school starts in two weeks.

234
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,730
There'll be a lot less kids then.

235
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,340
- Can we get out of here?

236
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,413
You guys are getting a little too serious.

237
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:05,308
(ominous music)

238
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,820
- We'd have to have him get
pretty far from the school.

239
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,330
- He turns on road 16.

240
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,333
Map this on your chart there.

241
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,463
When he goes down road 12, he's
as far from anyone possible.

242
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:02,177
(indistinct chatter)

243
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,683
- Look at that guy, dumb is a post I bet.

244
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,923
- This is the place.

245
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:14,072
- Place for what?

246
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:19,138
- What do you think we've
been cruising this dump for?

247
00:16:19,138 --> 00:16:21,063
We got this thing all
damn near planned out.

248
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,253
Don't we?

249
00:16:25,063 --> 00:16:27,061
- Damn near.

250
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:27,894
Damn near.

251
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,503
- Are you in?

252
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:40,451
'Cause it's a go.

253
00:17:03,738 --> 00:17:06,155
(applauding)

254
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,935
- [Narrator] Now shooting down the chute

255
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,935
we've got Johnny Miller!

256
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:26,638
(loud horn honking)

257
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:28,401
Okay, Johnny takes his full eight seconds!

258
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:29,891
Nice job cowboy!

259
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:31,641
That's the way to go!

260
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,660
All righty now, up next we got

261
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,880
Tim Pearson out of chute number four.

262
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,620
He's riding Bambino.

263
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,749
And Tim's representing
the Pearson Farms today!

264
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:44,916
So good luck to you Timmy!

265
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,043
- Okay son, make me proud.

266
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:54,906
- Good to go.

267
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,489
(loud ringing)

268
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,210
- [Narrator] Ooh, tough luck there.

269
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,803
Hang in next time there Timmy!

270
00:18:14,605 --> 00:18:15,624
(indistinct speaking)

271
00:18:15,624 --> 00:18:16,457
- Thanks.

272
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,283
- You're never gonna
win a buckle that way.

273
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,170
- I think you did just fine.

274
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,873
You get a buckle from me anytime.

275
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:44,344
(slow paced music)

276
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,530
- Okay, we'll wait to
register these things

277
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,231
until just before.

278
00:19:23,231 --> 00:19:24,064
- [Rick] Why?

279
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:25,640
- In case anybody gets the license plates,

280
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,030
the information will get
lost in the bureaucracy.

281
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,250
- Alright, we got to
refit these interiors,

282
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,580
and we got to install the CBs,

283
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,256
and you guys have got to get a name

284
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,496
out of the phone book that we
can register these things to.

285
00:19:34,496 --> 00:19:36,350
- We're gonna do all this in a month?

286
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,470
- We gotta finish before
summer school's out.

287
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,720
You got any better ideas?

288
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,600
- Hey, is it safe to do the
work here at your folks?

289
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,000
- Let me worry about that.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,550
Also, I got an old x-ray machine.

291
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,410
- An x-ray machine?

292
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:52,010
- Yeah, and some parachutes
and some mannequins too.

293
00:19:53,745 --> 00:19:54,578
- Hey Jim.

294
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,347
We're gonna be late for dinner.

295
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:13,208
- Watch your step squirt.

296
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,129
- I will.

297
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,129
- Hey, I didn't know you could talk.

298
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:19,470
- Bye Tim.

299
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,969
- [Children] Ooh!

300
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,545

301
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:31,726

305
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:51,492
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

306
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,290
- Alright, here's how I figure it.

307
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,100
The kids, after we
transfer 'em into the vans,

308
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,520
we drive around till we get to the place

309
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,357
where we're gonna hide 'em,

310
00:21:06,357 --> 00:21:07,663
and we do have to hide 'em.

311
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,130
Where's Rick?

312
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,513
- Mom made him stay at
home, clean his room.

313
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,994
- We're gonna do this Jim, is he in?

314
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:18,714
(gun firing)
(glass shattering)

315
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:20,264
- He'll do anything I tell him.

316
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,503
- Yeah?

317
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,433
I'm telling you,

318
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,493
he better.

319
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,102
- He will.

320
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:35,260
(loud gun firing)
(glass shattering)

321
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,330
So where could you hide them.

322
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,270
I mean, where could you
hold a bunch of kids

323
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,310
until the ransoms delivered?

324
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,630
How could you be sure that they're gonna

325
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,530
stay put unless you're there yourself?

326
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,007
- I am way ahead of you.

327
00:21:49,854 --> 00:21:53,258
(loud gun firing)
(glass shattering)

328
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:56,175
(slow paced music)

329
00:22:21,033 --> 00:22:22,550
- Come on back!

330
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,977
Come on, come on back!

331
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,060
Alright, watch your side.

332
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:30,416
Watch it on the side!

333
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,195
Alright good form, good form!

334
00:22:33,195 --> 00:22:34,278
Come on back!

335
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,048
Come on back!

336
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:00,490
- [Narrator] What's the matter darling?

337
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,310
You've been blue.

338
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,530
- It's nothing.

339
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,820
- It's been nothing for three weeks now.

340
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,693
Come on honey.

341
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,820
- I hurt Tim's feelings.

342
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,350
- [Mom] I thought you liked him?

343
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,760
- I do, he asked me to the movies.

344
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,530
- [Mom] That's nice.

345
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,310
- I couldn't give him an answer.

346
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,910
Bonnie and Wendy were there
and they laughed at him.

347
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:26,660
- Well you can still say yes if you want.

348
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,070
- He's been avoiding me this whole time

349
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,403
and summer school's almost over anyway.

350
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,150
- You know, sometimes
you feel like you'd never

351
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,813
get another chance at anything.

352
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,534
But you always do.

353
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:43,273
Hey, I promise.

354
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,673
- Thanks mom.

355
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:55,194
(loud clanking)

356
00:24:31,247 --> 00:24:32,299
(creaking)

357
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,491
- [Narrator] What's that?

358
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,391
- The roof!

359
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,988
- Come on Rick, let's get out of here!

360
00:24:36,988 --> 00:24:37,821
Get out!

361
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,078
Hold on!

362
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,457
Hold up, hold up!

363
00:24:49,457 --> 00:24:52,624
The dirt's gonna collapse the trailer!

364
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:57,016
- What's the problem?

365
00:24:57,016 --> 00:24:59,240
- The dirt's gonna collapse the trailer.

366
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,680
- Relax.

367
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,970
- Relax?

368
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,070
You go down there, I'm not going in there.

369
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,300
- Get my toolbox.

370
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,823
Go get some two-by-fours out
of that lumber pile alright.

371
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,763
Hurry up!

372
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,460
(ominous music)

373
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,410
Strong son of a gun for an old guy.

374
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,170
I'll have to be on him.

375
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,043
All the time.

376
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,510
- You know, I'll be glad
when summer school is out

377
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,990
so that I can put a little
more time in on this place.

378
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:14,490
- You've been working it
too hard on both ends.

379
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,343
Maybe you should think about
cutting back on the driving.

380
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,030
- I hate to admit it but

381
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,220
those kids are beginning
to get on my nerves.

382
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:26,783
They're getting sassier
and louder every year.

383
00:26:28,537 --> 00:26:30,783
- Well you're getting older every year.

384
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,213
- Older am I?

385
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,943
Older?

386
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,522
Come on, let's wrestle huh?

387
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:43,522
- No Edward.

388
00:26:44,488 --> 00:26:46,738
(laughing)

389
00:27:00,157 --> 00:27:02,824
(ominous music)

390
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,586
- [Little Boy] Oh you always get it!

391
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:21,375
- Nuh uh, you got it yesterday!

392
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,556
- Yeah, right after you
took it from my hand.

393
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:24,389
My turn!

394
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:26,507
- No you got it yesterday!

395
00:27:26,507 --> 00:27:28,973
- Would you two stop it?

396
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:30,159
- [Little Boy] Oh she started it!

397
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,007
- I got it first!

398
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,459
He's gonna take it away from me!

399
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:33,413
- You know what?

400
00:27:33,413 --> 00:27:35,813
I have a good mind to take
you both to the pound.

401
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:40,063
I don't want to hear another
peep out of either one of you.

402
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,640
- Okay, shut the door.

403
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,473
Perfect.

404
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,560
Get those extra Jerry cans.

405
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:05,340
We are three hours away.

406
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,990
Man I can't taste the adrenaline.

407
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,200
This is it!

408
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,523
We can't miss!

409
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,110
Come on, let's do it!

410
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,740
We have planned it to
perfection, it is foolproof.

411
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,490
- Yes, we're really
gonna do this aren't we?

412
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,620
- Yes.

413
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,453
- Yes!

414
00:28:19,453 --> 00:28:22,700
- Okay, he picks up those
kids at the pool at 4 o'clock,

415
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,633
let's move!

416
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:36,953
You can't back out now.

417
00:28:36,953 --> 00:28:38,357
We're counting on you.

418
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:39,263
You got your gun?

419
00:28:43,216 --> 00:28:44,566
- George Hill here we come.

420
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:56,683
- Let's go.

421
00:28:58,648 --> 00:28:59,481
Don't bunch up.

422
00:28:59,481 --> 00:29:02,531
One at a time, one at a time, come on.

423
00:29:02,531 --> 00:29:03,935
Alright, here we go.

424
00:29:03,935 --> 00:29:05,492
Come on.

425
00:29:05,492 --> 00:29:06,484
Get up.

426
00:29:06,484 --> 00:29:07,651
There you are.

427
00:29:15,764 --> 00:29:18,419
Alright, keep it down.

428
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:19,699
- It's almost over!

429
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:22,569
One more day of summer school!

430
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,967
- [Kids] One more day!

431
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:25,454
One more day!

432
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:27,188
One more day!

- [Fred] Right on schedule.

00:30:27,912 --> 00:30:30,029
- We're really gonna do this aren't we?

442
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,058
- Yeah we are.

443
00:30:31,058 --> 00:30:32,513

444
00:30:32,513 --> 00:30:35,550
- Man, my head's pounding like crazy.

00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,383
- Mine too.

446
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:39,428

470
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,660
- Get in back.

471
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,490

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,692

Do you want anybody hurt?

Alright.

(screaming)

482
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,300

(ominous music)

484
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:51,775

You're going first, you understand me?

Come on kids, jump down here.

00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,603
Watch your head.

505
00:34:28,603 --> 00:34:29,436
- Where are you taking us?

506
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:30,607
I need to know!

507
00:34:30,607 --> 00:34:31,770
- You sit back and do nothing!

508
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,317
You understand me?

509
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:35,135
Nothing, until I tell you to do it!

510
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:36,035
Let's go!

511
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:36,868

518
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:19,586
(screaming)

519
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,214
Yes, we did it.

520
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:23,270
Like clockwork.

521
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,103
4:35.

522
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,993
(loud sobbing)

523
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:42,615
- [Narrator] I'm scared Edward.

524
00:35:42,615 --> 00:35:45,239
What are they gonna do to us?

525
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,489
- It's alright.

526
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:49,993
It's some kind of a joke I'm sure.

527
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:50,826
- [Narrator] What are they gonna do to us?

528
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:52,826
- It's not a joke is it?

529
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:56,956
They're going to kill us all aren't they?

530
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,713
- No, no, no, no, no they're not.

531
00:35:58,713 --> 00:36:01,331
- What are they gonna do to us?

532
00:36:01,331 --> 00:36:03,590
- [Narrator] I'm scared.

533
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,090
I'm scared Edward.

534
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,000
- At least I can depend on you Wrigley.

535
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:05,844

536
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:22,879

538
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,823

540
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:50,930
Can you hear me?

541
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,373
Speak to me, talk to me!

542
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:54,960
You've got to stop.

543
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:02,613
Get some air back here.

544
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,196

546
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:15,135
(ringing)

547
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:18,355
- Superintendent Tatum.

548
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:20,602
No, we haven't heard anything.

549
00:38:20,602 --> 00:38:22,649
Well it's probably a breakdown.

550
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:23,502
Yes you see the drivers
(ringing)

551
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:27,030
are instructed not to leave the bus..

552
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,550
Well that doesn't sound like Ed Gray.

553
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,770
Well I'll check into it

554
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,855
and I'll get back to you Mrs. Alanzo.

555
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,105
Yes, thank you.

556
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:37,536
Yes.

557
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:40,040
Superintendent Tatum.

558
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,873
No, no.
(ringing)

559
00:38:40,873 --> 00:38:42,053
We think it may be a breakout.

560
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,210
We're checking into it.

561
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,760
Yes sir.

562
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,015
Superintendent Tatum.

563
00:38:46,015 --> 00:38:48,182
(ringing)

564
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,394
- Hello.

565
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,227
- [Narrator] Is Edward home yet?

566
00:38:51,227 --> 00:38:52,370
- No he's not.

567
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,991
He was supposed to be
here to bail hay but--

568
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:57,324
(dial tone)

569
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,683
- I couldn't find the bus on his route.

570
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:23,210
- [Narrator] What do you mean?

571
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,320
- What do you mean?

572
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,750
- Ed's bus.

573
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:26,600
Couldn't find it.

574
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,830
We covered the route twice.

575
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,190
- I've got my other two
men looking everywhere.

576
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,273
Expanding out from the original route.

577
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,710
Right now, it's nowhere to be seen.

578
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,060
- Nowhere?

579
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,580
What do you mean nowhere?

580
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,510
It's a big yellow bus.

581
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,930
Where is it?

582
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,030
Where's my babies?

583
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,253
Where's our kids?

584
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,543
(coughing)

585
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,400
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, we're almost there.

586
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,373
It's gonna be okay.

587
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:20,030
- Almost where?

588
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,863
Back home?

589
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,558
- We'll sing a song.

590
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:25,906
♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪

591
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:27,573
- But I'm not happy.

592
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,336
- Then we'll sing if you're sad

593
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:31,982
and you know it clap your hands.

594
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:36,466
♪ If you're sad and you
know it clap your hands ♪

595
00:40:36,466 --> 00:40:41,466
♪ If you're sad and you
know it clap your hands ♪

596
00:40:41,475 --> 00:40:43,987
♪ If you're sad and you know it ♪

597
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:46,367
♪ Then your face will surely show it ♪

598
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:51,367
♪ If you're sad and you
know it clap your hands ♪

599
00:41:02,135 --> 00:41:03,203
- [Narrator] We've got it.

600
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:06,788
It's in Berenda Slough
off road 14 and a half.

601
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:08,738
I don't see anybody there though, over.

602
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:12,859
(sirens blaring)

603
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,563
- It's the bus, they found the bus.

604
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:37,043
The kids, the kids are gone.

605
00:41:39,685 --> 00:41:42,352
(ominous music)

606
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,783
(coughing)

607
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:15,312
- It smells.

608
00:42:15,312 --> 00:42:17,610
It's making me sick.

609
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,743
- Gasoline, they're refilling the tanks.

610
00:42:24,266 --> 00:42:26,016
- I'm gonna get sick.

611
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,486
- Alright.

612
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:30,106
Come here.

613
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:30,939
Come here.

614
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,433
- Edward.

615
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:38,555
Edward, I have to pee.

616
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:39,388
- [Kids] Me too.

617
00:42:39,388 --> 00:42:40,667
- Just go ahead and do
what you've done before.

618
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,568
Go ahead, go ahead and do it.

619
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:43,401
Do it.

620
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:44,234
(loud banging)

621
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:45,704
- Hey!

622
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:47,787
I want it quiet in there!

623
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:52,218
- [Narrator] Mommy, I wanna go home.

624
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:17,730
- A doll, nothing else.

625
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,490
Not a footprint, not a trace.

626
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:24,253
- Les, I've got a faint tire track here.

627
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,003
- Shoot it.

628
00:43:28,029 --> 00:43:28,862
Yeah.

629
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,730
- Tire prints show a lot of weight.

630
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,080
- Looks like another set of wheels

631
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,530
got stuck a little over here.

632
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:44,740
- You think the kids might not have been

633
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,923
transferred into another bus?

634
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,460
- [Les] I think we're talking vans.

635
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,973
Small delivery types maybe.

636
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:56,226
(ominous music)

637
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:13,005
(faint crying)

638
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,452
- Let's get to work.

639
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:47,753
Okay, let's do it.

640
00:44:50,026 --> 00:44:51,109
You, get out.

641
00:44:52,353 --> 00:44:54,520
Come on, come on, get out.

642
00:45:04,442 --> 00:45:06,275
Take your clothes off.

643
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,163
Take your clothes off.

644
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:21,103
The pants.

645
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,673
Take the pants off.

646
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,660
Come on, come on hurry up.

647
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:36,140
Get down.

648
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,250
- What is this?

649
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,770
Hey, just what do you fellas want?

650
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,920
Listen, those kids are
suffocating in there.

651
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,550
They're dying of thirst.

652
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,400
They're sitting in their own waste.

653
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,413
- Get down the hole, now.

654
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:00,850
- It works.

655
00:46:13,162 --> 00:46:15,495
(screaming)

656
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:20,790
- Give me a piece your clothing.

657
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,290
All he's got is a shirt.

658
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,280
- We got to get a piece
from each kid, remember.

659
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,113
Give me your glasses.

660
00:46:26,113 --> 00:46:27,426
- What's your name?

661
00:46:27,426 --> 00:46:29,497
- Ricardo, Ricardo Alanzo.

662
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,600
- How old?

663
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,690
- Eight.

664
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,523
Are you gonna kill me?

665
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:35,576
- Maybe, give me your glasses.

666
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:36,973
- I need 'em to see.

667
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:39,758
- [Fred] Give me your glasses.

668
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:41,258
- Here, take them.

669
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:44,567
- What are you doing!

670
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:51,817
Go on, down in there.

671
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:55,484
- [Jim] He's got a
flashlight in there okay.

672
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:02,112
(screaming)

673
00:47:06,716 --> 00:47:07,549
What's your name?

674
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:08,382
- Peter Rogers.

675
00:47:09,483 --> 00:47:10,316
- [Jim] How old?

676
00:47:10,316 --> 00:47:11,700
- Nine.

677
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,210
- Alright, just give him your shirt.

678
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:15,857
Give it to him.

679
00:47:22,747 --> 00:47:24,414
Go on, go on, go on.

680
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:37,564
Come on!

681
00:47:40,655 --> 00:47:41,740
- [Jim] What's your name?

682
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,030
- Tim Pearson.

683
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,030
- This is tough guy.

684
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,373
Give me your belt tough guy.

685
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:49,053
Give me your belt.

686
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:51,188
- No I'm not gonna give you my belt.

687
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:53,457
No, no my mother gave it to me.

688
00:47:53,457 --> 00:47:54,540
Let go of me.

689
00:47:57,008 --> 00:47:59,080
- Oh look, we got the champ here.

690
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,233
Down the hole champ.

691
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:11,923
(screaming)

692
00:48:16,808 --> 00:48:20,141
(indistinct chattering)

693
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,890
- I think Sheriff Holman's here.

694
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,832
Sheriff Holman, he's here.

695
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:29,948
- What took him so long?

696
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:30,781
- I don't know.

697
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:31,614
He'll be here any second now

698
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:32,538
and I'm sure he'll have
something to tell us.

699
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,440
- Oh there.

700
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,720
- There she is.

701
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,840
Where's that damn husband of yours?

702
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,412
- What?

703
00:48:38,412 --> 00:48:39,245
- [Narrator] Jack don't.

704
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:40,310
- Where is he?

705
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:43,000
He was always a little strange
as far as I was concerned.

706
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,530
- What are you saying Jack?

707
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:47,270
My Edward would never do
anything to harm a child.

708
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:50,070
Why he's driven you to
school and your children.

709
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,900
- Yeah, well you don't have a kid missing.

710
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,500
You don't know how we feel.

711
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,740
- Oh yes I do.

712
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:56,570
I've got my husband missing.

713
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,650
And he's as good and
decent as any man alive.

714
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,540
And you all better just pray to God

715
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,573
how lucky you are that those
children are with Edward.

716
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,380
- [Jack] There he is.

717
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,693
- Please, I have a statement.

718
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,080
I've just been informed that the

719
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,120
President of the United
States has dispatched

720
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:21,210
50 FBI agents to Chowchilla.

721
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:22,750
- What about you?

722
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:23,910
What are you doing?

723
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:26,393
- I know this is no ease to some of you,

724
00:49:26,393 --> 00:49:28,890
but we and the federal government

725
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,970
are about to commence
with the biggest manhunt

726
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,760
in California history.

727
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,889
- What have you found out?

728
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,690
They've been gone for eight hours.

729
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,523
Why?

730
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,363
Why have they taken our children?

731
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,233
Why?

732
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,170
- We're working with everything we have.

733
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:51,067
- [Narrator] They're doing nothing.

734
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:53,486
- Why hasn't anything happening?

735
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:55,501
- He'll be safe.

736
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:56,668
He'll be fine.

737
00:49:58,284 --> 00:49:59,781
(screaming)

738
00:49:59,781 --> 00:50:02,281
- [Narrator] I don't wanna go!

739
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,588
- Sally, how many more
are your in your van?

740
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:08,066
- Just me and Wendy.

741
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:09,524
Where's my brother?

742
00:50:09,524 --> 00:50:10,857
- I'm over here!

743
00:50:11,797 --> 00:50:13,267
- [Edward] Come on Wendy.

744
00:50:13,267 --> 00:50:16,017
- Edward, don't let them do this!

745
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:19,731
(screaming)

746
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:40,731
- [Narrator] Watch out!

747
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:42,044
- Go go go.

748
00:50:42,044 --> 00:50:44,377
(loud thud)

749
00:50:45,703 --> 00:50:48,370
(ominous music)

750
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,565
- You'll be alright.

751
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:03,482
We're gonna be alright.

752
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:10,290
(loud thudding)

753
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,623
(screaming)

754
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,154
- Hold up hold up, what are you doing?

755
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:17,987
It's not enough.

756
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,370
- Right, the plates, the batteries,

757
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:22,451
we've got almost 400 pounds on here.

758
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:23,520
I think it's enough.

759
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,540
- Do as I tell you.

760
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,907
- Fred, it's enough.

761
00:51:32,503 --> 00:51:33,503
- Better be.

762
00:51:35,047 --> 00:51:36,130
It better be.

763
00:51:46,139 --> 00:51:48,806
(ominous music)

764
00:51:50,014 --> 00:51:52,681
(loud thudding)

765
00:51:55,975 --> 00:52:00,975
- It's okay, it's alright.

766
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,267
- [Narrator] I wanna go home.

767
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,003
- Edward, Edward look here.

768
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:47,820
Edward look here.

769
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,230
What is it?

770
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,770
- Air.

771
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,743
Some sort of fan system for fresh air.

772
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,123
Sounds weak.

773
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,610
Yeah it is weak.

774
00:53:12,468 --> 00:53:14,801
(screaming)

775
00:53:18,477 --> 00:53:20,727
(creaking)

776
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,483
Get back!

777
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:38,490
- [Rick] Is that a cop?

778
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,277
Oh my god, Jim there's
a cop right behind us.

779
00:53:40,277 --> 00:53:41,563
- [Fred] Shut up!

780
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:43,493
Just stay cool.

781
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:59,690
- Can't stop can we?

782
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,363
We couldn't just let them go could we?

783
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:03,830
- Just stay cool.

784
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:04,973
- Wait, wait.

785
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:10,290
We'll wait until the morning.

786
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,540
We'll call in the ransom.

787
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,610
I still think five millions the best.

788
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,362
- [Narrator] I'm scared.

789
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,578
- [Narrator] Water!

790
00:54:31,578 --> 00:54:32,873
- [Tim] Edward, there's food in here!

791
00:54:34,214 --> 00:54:35,978
Get out the water!

792
00:54:35,978 --> 00:54:37,918
(indistinct yelling)

793
00:54:37,918 --> 00:54:39,073
- Stay back!

794
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:39,906
Calm down!

795
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:44,878
Stop, get back!

796
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:46,890
This has to be rationed!

797
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,133
You have to share, do you
know what share means?

798
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,880
We've got to share this!

799
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,110
Now we don't know how long...

800
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,302
All right.

801
00:54:56,302 --> 00:54:57,135
- [Tim] Don't step on that.

802
00:54:57,135 --> 00:54:58,096
- Okay line up.

803
00:54:58,096 --> 00:54:59,872
Line up like you're doing
waiting for the bus.

804
00:54:59,872 --> 00:55:01,455
All of you line up.

805
00:55:05,863 --> 00:55:08,030
(ringing)

806
00:55:10,746 --> 00:55:13,829
(indistinct chatter)

807
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:29,805
- Les, there's 200 press types out there.

808
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:31,150
This one woman from from New York City

809
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,213
just took a cap from LA to get here.

810
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:35,480
A 200-mile cab ride.

811
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,720
She wants to report.

812
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,771
- Yeah?

813
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:38,803
To report what?

814
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,070
Kids have been gone 18
hours and no message.

815
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,120
Why don't think call?

816
00:55:45,847 --> 00:55:48,347
(busy signal)

817
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:54,799
- Man.

818
00:55:57,217 --> 00:56:02,034
There's not a phone in
Chowchilla that's not busy.

819
00:56:02,034 --> 00:56:03,720
- How're we supposed to phone in a ransom

820
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,670
if all the phones are busy man?

821
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:06,710
- Try again.

822
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,260
- We've been trying to get
through for three hours.

823
00:56:22,694 --> 00:56:24,944
(coughing)

824
00:56:31,699 --> 00:56:32,990
- The airs getting awfully
thin in here Edward.

825
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:36,833
I mean that fan's starting to get slower.

826
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,613
- Yeah.

827
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:42,403
I've been watching it for quite a while.

828
00:56:48,077 --> 00:56:50,297
- What are we gonna do when it quits?

829
00:56:50,297 --> 00:56:52,070
What are we gonna do if it quits Edward?

830
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:55,424
- Hold on now, none of
that you understand?

831
00:56:55,424 --> 00:56:56,507
None of that.

832
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,600
I'm gonna need your help.

833
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,433
You understand?

834
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:03,236
Good.

835
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,320
We've been here for about

836
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,533
almost 14 hours.

837
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,280
We got to get out.

838
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,466
- [Tim] How are we gonna do that Edward?

839
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:18,570
- I can help.

840
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,090
I'm little but let me help.

841
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,053
- Yeah yeah yeah.

842
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:29,843
I tell you what.

843
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:32,430
We want to take the mattresses

844
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,230
and pile them up.

845
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:37,312
Okay squirt, you're gonna help.

846
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:38,848
Help pile up the mattresses over here.

847
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:40,348
Come on, let's go.

848
00:57:41,455 --> 00:57:44,315
- [Tim] Hey, come on get up.

849
00:57:44,315 --> 00:57:47,148
We're gonna move these mattresses.

850
00:57:50,654 --> 00:57:53,321
Let's go, we're gonna move this.

851
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,227
Let's move it over here.

852
00:57:58,249 --> 00:58:00,416
(ringing)

853
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,879
- [Reporter] Mrs. Rogers, can
you tell us about your kids?

854
00:58:06,879 --> 00:58:08,500
- They're just kids.

855
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,723
Cats and dogs.

856
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,033
I miss them so much I could die.

857
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,670
How could anyone do such a thing?

858
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,683
They're just children.

859
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:30,873
If whoever out there is watching,

860
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:33,973
please,

861
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:37,133
my babies.

862
00:58:39,004 --> 00:58:41,353
Please don't hurt my babies.

863
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:45,629
(loud sobbing)

864
00:58:45,629 --> 00:58:46,543
- Hold on honey, hold on.

865
00:58:47,896 --> 00:58:50,063
- [Mrs. Rogers] I'm sorry.

866
00:58:52,317 --> 00:58:54,567
(coughing)

867
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:16,963
- I can't do it.

868
00:59:17,867 --> 00:59:19,773
We need something, a crowbar or something.

869
00:59:20,776 --> 00:59:22,359
That's would do it.

870
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,120
That's what we need.

871
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,520
- [Tim] Fine I'll get it.

872
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,353
- No, no, no.

873
00:59:27,353 --> 00:59:28,186
- [Tim] It'll work.

874
00:59:28,186 --> 00:59:29,400
- The roof.

875
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,740
- Edward we need, we need it--

876
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,590
- Don't touch it.

877
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,870
It could bring down the whole roof.

878
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,970
Kids, kids, get back.

879
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,150
Get back against the trailer.

880
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,602
Way back.

881
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:47,642
Get back of the trailer,
back of the trailer.

882
00:59:47,642 --> 00:59:49,059
Come on, come on.

883
00:59:50,263 --> 00:59:52,263
Get back of the trailer.

884
00:59:55,139 --> 00:59:55,972
That's it.

885
00:59:59,842 --> 01:00:01,340
Let's get it up.

886
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,484
Get it up, that's it.

887
01:00:03,484 --> 01:00:05,734
(scraping)

888
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:12,934
(suspenseful music)

889
01:00:30,492 --> 01:00:31,325
Come on.

890
01:00:38,829 --> 01:00:39,912
Give me that.

891
01:00:56,114 --> 01:00:57,364
It moved a bit.

892
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:01,153
You see that?

893
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:04,793
- We gotta get back there Jim.

894
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,920
What if something happens to those kids?

895
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,970
- Nothing's gonna--

896
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,220
- Jim, you were in there!

897
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,520
And that roof could
collapse at any second!

898
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,110
- Don't go chicken on us.

899
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,623
Fred finds out he'll be mad.

900
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:24,383
- You know, I never really
dreamed we'd do this.

901
01:01:28,998 --> 01:01:31,810
Did you hear those kids screaming Jim?

902
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,000
Did you?

903
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,923
- They're kids.

904
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,290
They'll get over it.

905
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,123
They're probably--

906
01:01:37,123 --> 01:01:39,579
- Jim, have you been watching the news!

907
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:42,010
The whole federal government's involved!

908
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,810
There's reporters from all
over the world in Chowchilla!

909
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,103
- Settle down damn it.

910
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,070
It is perfect.

911
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,370
It is perfect!

912
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:53,020
It has been pulled off perfectly.

913
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,217
- The hell it is.

914
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:58,243
Perfect.

915
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:03,870
- Okay.

916
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,700
Alright, we'll take
them some food later on.

917
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:07,533
Not now.

918
01:02:07,533 --> 01:02:09,370
Not until it's after dark.

919
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:10,963
It's too dangerous until then.

920
01:02:18,351 --> 01:02:20,680
(coughing)

921
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,588
- Sally give me your hand.

922
01:02:22,588 --> 01:02:23,421
Here.

923
01:02:25,421 --> 01:02:26,254
You got it?

924
01:02:26,254 --> 01:02:27,087
- Uh huh.

925
01:02:35,206 --> 01:02:36,373
- Put that up.

926
01:02:52,785 --> 01:02:56,202
- Yeah they put something on top of this.

927
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,660
Feels like a battery.

928
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:03,746
A big one.

929
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:09,388
It's coming.

930
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:12,683
Little by little it's coming.

931
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:17,523
- Here Edward.

932
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:48,630
(creaking)

933
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,650
- [Mrs. Rogers] Whoever
is out there watching,

934
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,860
please, please don't hurt my babies.

935
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:56,013
- Ugh, turn off that TV.

936
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:00,162
I can't hear anymore
of that terrible news.

937
01:04:00,162 --> 01:04:02,345
Those poor children.

938
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:03,480
Isn't that awful?

939
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,710
- It's tragic.

940
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,890
It's terrible, it's just terrible.

941
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,513
- Who could do such a thing.

942
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,100
- This is what society's coming to.

943
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:14,520
- [Narrator] The police
await more reinforcements

944
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,469
from the FBI as the manhunt

945
01:04:16,469 --> 01:04:18,623
continues throughout the area.

946
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:19,863
Live from Chowchilla.

947
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,013
- [Mom] You're not eating much Rick.

948
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:32,970
- I'm just not hungry mom.

949
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,000
- You look tired too dear.

950
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,840
You get enough rest?

951
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,403
- Probably too much rest.

952
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,210
I want you boys to start
doing more around here

953
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,860
to help your mother.

954
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,810
Is that understood?

955
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:44,643
- Yes.

956
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,780
Come on Rick, we gotta
drive over to Fred's.

957
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,190
- Fred, that young man.

958
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:53,000
He's inherited everything from his family

959
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,700
except their brains if you ask me.

960
01:04:56,215 --> 01:04:58,393
- Are you sure you're
feeling all right darling?

961
01:04:59,797 --> 01:05:00,790
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

962
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,562
I'm just feeling a little queasy.

963
01:05:03,562 --> 01:05:04,979
Can I be excused?

964
01:05:08,006 --> 01:05:09,006
- Excuse me.

965
01:05:23,514 --> 01:05:26,264
(faint whirring)

966
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:02,243
- Get 'em on the ground.

967
01:06:02,243 --> 01:06:04,283
Be careful, be careful.

968
01:06:04,283 --> 01:06:07,283
It could still have some acid in it.

969
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:31,827
Alright, be careful.

970
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:36,110
- Edward, Edward, some of the little kids

971
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,460
are fainting from the heat.

972
01:06:42,553 --> 01:06:45,136
(solemn music)

973
01:06:46,614 --> 01:06:47,614
- All right.

974
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:50,410
All right.

975
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:53,057
Here, dampen this with water.

976
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,880
You dampen this with water

977
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,640
and then wipe their faces with it.

978
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,993
- But the water is going fast.

979
01:07:02,993 --> 01:07:05,210
- It's okay, you just do what I told you.

980
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,087
Go ahead now.

981
01:07:07,007 --> 01:07:07,840
Come on.

982
01:07:10,672 --> 01:07:13,255
(solemn music)

983
01:07:29,468 --> 01:07:32,051
(loud banging)

984
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:18,676
(solemn music)

985
01:08:32,835 --> 01:08:34,674
We're done for kid.

986
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:37,257
I'm telling you we're done for.

987
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:43,210
- No we're not.

988
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,043
No you're not.

989
01:08:44,043 --> 01:08:44,876
We're not done for Edward.

990
01:08:44,876 --> 01:08:46,400
Listen to me, we're not done for.

991
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,385
Now don't give up.

992
01:08:47,385 --> 01:08:48,817
We're gonna do it Edward alright.

993
01:08:48,817 --> 01:08:51,618
You get up Edward, right now you get up!

994
01:08:51,618 --> 01:08:52,535
You get up.

995
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:55,964
You get up.

996
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,754
You get up.

997
01:08:58,754 --> 01:09:01,837
You get up Edward, don't you do this!

998
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,690
- [Jim] Man, what if they
can trace my handwriting?

999
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:09,703
- They won't?

1000
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,990
We have to write a note.

1001
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,010
We can't get through on the phone's,

1002
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:17,660
all the phones are busy,
we can't get through.

1003
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:18,980
- That's not how you spell ransom.

1004
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,530
R-A-N-S-O-M?

1005
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:21,460
- Yeah.

1006
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,540
- No, there's an E at the end.

1007
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:24,210
- No there isn't.

1008
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,700
- Sign the note Beelzebub.

1009
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:26,710
The name of the devil.

1010
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,520
That will really throw them off.

1011
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:29,820
- How you spell Beelzebub?

1012
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,733
- B-E-A-L-S-A bub okay?

1013
01:09:43,371 --> 01:09:44,297
- Alright, "To whom it may concern,

1014
01:09:44,297 --> 01:09:45,537
"your bus has been kidnapped.

1015
01:09:45,537 --> 01:09:46,957
"We demand five million dollars in ransom

1016
01:09:46,957 --> 01:09:48,317
"to be put into suitcases.

1017
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:50,327
"Use old bills, use a CHP plane,

1018
01:09:50,327 --> 01:09:51,220
"drop off the...

1019
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:52,900
"We are Beelzebub."

1020
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,733
This is great.

1021
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:54,610
This is good.

1022
01:09:54,610 --> 01:09:56,060
- That's good, and then what?

1023
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:00,673
- Okay, you guys will go
up on top of the mountain.

1024
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:04,640
No wait, Jim you'll go
up on top of the mountain

1025
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,730
and you'll hang out by those blinkers.

1026
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:08,080
You have to hijack a private plane.

1027
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:10,400
We'll throw out the
dummies with the parachutes

1028
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,720
and then you'll jump out later

1029
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:13,720
over that airstrip at the mountain base.

1030
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,420
The plane will be on autopilot.

1031
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,710
They'll be tracking it on radar

1032
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:19,197
but no one will be aboard.

1033
01:10:21,730 --> 01:10:23,430
- The note Fred.

1034
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:24,880
- What, the note the note, it's perfect,

1035
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,713
it's fine, it's great.

1036
01:10:25,713 --> 01:10:27,380
Don't worry about the note.

1037
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,480
- If we're gonna give it to the governor,

1038
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,930
I mean, what, are we gonna just walk up

1039
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:32,550
and hand it to him?

1040
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,403
How are we gonna deliver the note?

1041
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,910
- We'll get it there.

1042
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:41,953
We'll get it there.

1043
01:10:49,665 --> 01:10:52,665
(crickets chirping)

1044
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:56,376
(coughing)

1045
01:10:58,543 --> 01:11:01,218
- [Narrator] My feet are sore.

1046
01:11:01,218 --> 01:11:04,014
- Listen, listen, I need your help okay?

1047
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:04,847
Listen you get up.

1048
01:11:04,847 --> 01:11:07,036
Ricardo you get up.

1049
01:11:07,036 --> 01:11:09,649
Get up, you be careful.

1050
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:11,308
Be careful alright.

1051
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:12,225
Be careful.

1052
01:11:13,163 --> 01:11:14,798
Ricardo right here, I need you right here.

1053
01:11:14,798 --> 01:11:16,453
I need you to be shining this alright?

1054
01:11:17,744 --> 01:11:18,661
Be careful.

1055
01:11:20,264 --> 01:11:21,347
Hold this up.

1056
01:11:22,897 --> 01:11:24,480
Be careful alright.

1057
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:33,508
- [Narrator] Let's get this down.

1058
01:11:35,268 --> 01:11:37,873
- We can do something with this.

1059
01:11:37,873 --> 01:11:40,790
(slow paced music)

1060
01:12:35,258 --> 01:12:36,091
Edward!

1061
01:12:39,806 --> 01:12:40,639
Edward!

1062
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:47,677
(faint buzzing)

1063
01:12:51,382 --> 01:12:53,799
(screeching)

1064
01:12:57,241 --> 01:12:58,074
- Edward.

1065
01:12:59,332 --> 01:13:02,000
Edward, one of the fans stopped.

1066
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,173
Help help us.

1067
01:13:11,647 --> 01:13:12,480
- Edward!

1068
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:15,397
Edward!

1069
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:27,021
(solemn music)

1070
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,912
I got some light.

1071
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,573
(screaming)

1072
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,510
- It's alright.

1073
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:11,116
- [Ricardo] Let me help.

1074
01:14:14,477 --> 01:14:16,248
- But be careful.

1075
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:17,081
Come on.

1076
01:14:19,671 --> 01:14:21,907
- [Narrator] What's happening?

1077
01:14:21,907 --> 01:14:23,730
- [Rick] Are we going
back there now or what?

1078
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:25,390
- [Jim] Relax Rick.

1079
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,030
- Relax?

1080
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,760
Jim there's 26 kids in there.

1081
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,310
He leaves enough food for five.

1082
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:35,020
- We can't go back there now.

1083
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:36,370
We got to send in the note.

1084
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:39,503
- Send the note to who?

1085
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,923
What are we, we walk up
and hand it to some cop?

1086
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,400
That's real smart.

1087
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,803
A real work of genius.

1088
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:54,703
Perfect crime.

1089
01:15:00,222 --> 01:15:04,330
I'm just saying we got
to go back there now.

1090
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,463
- We will, later.

1091
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:08,960
You think I want them to die?

1092
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,633
They're worth nothing dead.

1093
01:15:30,305 --> 01:15:32,250
- You go through, you look around.

1094
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,620
But be careful.

1095
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:35,650
Make sure that there's nobody around.

1096
01:15:35,650 --> 01:15:36,483
Okay?

1097
01:16:14,839 --> 01:16:15,672
Did you see anyone?

1098
01:16:15,672 --> 01:16:17,120
- [Tim] No, I don't see anyone.

1099
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:17,953
- You sure?

1100
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:20,055
- [Tim] Yes I'm sure.

1101
01:16:20,055 --> 01:16:21,918
- Well we're getting out.

1102
01:16:21,918 --> 01:16:22,814
We're getting out.

1103
01:16:22,814 --> 01:16:24,481
- We're getting out.

1104
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:28,054
- We're getting out of here.

1105
01:16:28,054 --> 01:16:29,290
We're getting out of here kids.

1106
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,349
Hurry up, come on.

1107
01:16:30,349 --> 01:16:31,846
We're going home.

1108
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:33,738
We're going home, come on.

1109
01:16:33,738 --> 01:16:35,361
Come on, let's go.

1110
01:16:35,361 --> 01:16:37,861
(light music)

1111
01:16:44,441 --> 01:16:45,274
Okay.

1112
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,973
The monkeys coming up next.

1113
01:16:57,770 --> 01:17:00,090
They gave their name
on the way going down.

1114
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,855
Let 'em give their name
on the way going up.

1115
01:17:01,855 --> 01:17:02,990
Say your name Peter.

1116
01:17:02,990 --> 01:17:04,828
- Peter, Peter Rogers.

1117
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:06,036
- That's right.

1118
01:17:06,036 --> 01:17:07,203
Come on Wendy.

1119
01:17:08,253 --> 01:17:09,153
Say your name.

1120
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:10,486
- [Wendy] Wendy.

1121
01:17:16,997 --> 01:17:19,080
- [Narrator] Julie Smith.

1122
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:30,689
- [Narrator] Kylie Spencer.

1123
01:17:53,987 --> 01:17:55,154
- Come on Sal.

1124
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:57,261
Come on.

1125
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:58,094
Jump up.

1126
01:18:04,955 --> 01:18:07,872
(slow paced music)

1127
01:18:28,317 --> 01:18:29,333
- [Narrator] Where are we Edward?

1128
01:18:33,429 --> 01:18:38,429
- [Narrator] It sure doesn't
look much like Chowchilla.

1129
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:39,680
- It sure doesn't.

1130
01:18:42,462 --> 01:18:43,920
No, I don't know where we are,

1131
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,120
but I want you all to stick together.

1132
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,850
Now stick together.

1133
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,340
Come on, follow me.

1134
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,873
(ominous music)

1135
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:36,574
Come on, come on.

1136
01:19:38,095 --> 01:19:40,803
Shh, I see a car.

1137
01:19:40,803 --> 01:19:41,835
Hide, come over here.

1138
01:19:41,835 --> 01:19:44,495
Come over here, come on.

1139
01:19:44,495 --> 01:19:46,328
Get moving get moving.

1140
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:56,390
Hey!

1141
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:57,223
Hey!

1142
01:19:58,148 --> 01:19:59,454
Hey!

1143
01:19:59,454 --> 01:20:00,847
Hey you!

1144
01:20:00,847 --> 01:20:01,680
Hey hey!

1145
01:20:02,952 --> 01:20:05,952
(children shouting)

1146
01:20:23,023 --> 01:20:23,856
Hey wait.

1147
01:20:31,583 --> 01:20:34,500
(melancholy music)

1148
01:20:39,478 --> 01:20:41,536
- They've been found.

1149
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:43,036
All of them.

1150
01:20:43,036 --> 01:20:44,286
Safe and sound.

1151
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,050
- No no no no, there's
plenty of weight on top,

1152
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:03,150
they'll never get out.

1153
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:07,543
I'd kill ya.

1154
01:21:09,346 --> 01:21:10,363
- I can't believe it.

1155
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,443
This is crazy.

1156
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,900
- You're coming with me?

1157
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:17,733
- Yeah.

1158
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:20,743
I can't believe it.

1159
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:24,660
- All right I'm gonna go north to Canada.

1160
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,643
You guys go south.

1161
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:28,603
- I'm not going.

1162
01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,200
- You gonna stay?

1163
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,300
That's good, you stay here.

1164
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,270
You get rid of everything.

1165
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,913
You get rid of all the evidence.

1166
01:21:38,675 --> 01:21:40,113
- I don't believe this.

1167
01:21:40,113 --> 01:21:42,180
- They got nothing though.

1168
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,230
They don't have a clue, they got nothing!

1169
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,923
We have contingency plans.

1170
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,473
- What contingency plans?

1171
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,270
- I've got to talk to mom.

1172
01:21:58,478 --> 01:22:01,061
(solemn music)

1173
01:22:11,234 --> 01:22:14,753
- Tell them,

1174
01:22:14,753 --> 01:22:16,267
tell them that I'm sorry.

1175
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,513
I don't want them to think
that they failed with us.

1176
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:28,590
I'm sorry Rick.

1177
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,880
- Tell me that this is just a dream.

1178
01:22:45,826 --> 01:22:50,826
(sirens blaring)
(applauding)

1179
01:24:02,743 --> 01:24:03,576
- I love you.

1180
01:24:03,576 --> 01:24:05,159
I love you so much.

1181
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:39,199
(coughing)

1182
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,308
- I don't know how they
stayed alive down there.

1183
01:24:46,308 --> 01:24:47,273
It was like a sewer.

1184
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,520
- Trailer was bought by one
Frederick Woods the fourth.

1185
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,820
- [Narrator] That's the
name of the quarry owner.

1186
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:57,151
- Yeah that's right, his son.

1187
01:24:57,151 --> 01:24:59,471
A very wealthy son from Portola Valley.

1188
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:00,945
We're running a check on him now.

1189
01:25:00,945 --> 01:25:02,110
- Not too many kids from Portola Valley

1190
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:03,290
have rap sheets on them.

1191
01:25:03,290 --> 01:25:04,123
- This one did.

1192
01:25:04,123 --> 01:25:06,610
Fred Woods prior, tampering with vehicles.

1193
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:08,160
And he had accomplices.

1194
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,590
Two other kids James
and Richard Schoenfeld.

1195
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:11,910
- [Narrator] Really?

1196
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:14,440
- Pull the mug shots and
release them to the press.

1197
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,313
I want everyone in the country
looking for these bastards.

1198
01:25:25,071 --> 01:25:26,071
- Oh my god.

1199
01:25:29,075 --> 01:25:30,492
You didn't Ricky.

1200
01:25:35,489 --> 01:25:36,406
- I did it.

1201
01:25:38,252 --> 01:25:39,085
- My god.

1202
01:25:41,852 --> 01:25:42,685
And Jim?

1203
01:25:46,143 --> 01:25:46,976
- Jim too.

1204
01:25:56,408 --> 01:25:57,241
- Oh.

1205
01:26:01,705 --> 01:26:03,872
(sobbing)

1206
01:26:07,908 --> 01:26:09,825
- What should I do mom?

1207
01:26:37,174 --> 01:26:39,253
- [Father] Tim!

1208
01:26:39,253 --> 01:26:40,603
Tim get on out here.

1209
01:26:45,180 --> 01:26:46,013
- [Tim] Yeah?

1210
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:51,120
- You lost that buckle
your mama made for you huh?

1211
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:51,953
- Yes sir.

1212
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,887
I mean sorta.

1213
01:26:54,887 --> 01:26:57,900
I mean, I mean, I mean sorta the guys--

1214
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:58,823
- It's yours son.

1215
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,793
Edward told me what
you did down there and,

1216
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,483
and you're more a man than I'll ever be.

1217
01:27:11,425 --> 01:27:12,425
This is yours champ.

1218
01:27:29,036 --> 01:27:30,890
- How'd it get started?

1219
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:33,503
- Money, a game, a joke.

1220
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:36,373
That's how the whole thing got started.

1221
01:27:37,539 --> 01:27:39,770
- That's where the idea came from?

1222
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:41,403
- It's just a crazy idea.

1223
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:44,070
I never thought we'd really do anything.

1224
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:46,243
And then, then Fred comes up.

1225
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:50,357
"Let's do some preliminary stuff.

1226
01:27:50,357 --> 01:27:51,357
"That wouldn't hurt.

1227
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:53,817
"Buy a trailer and stuff."

1228
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,890
Now he says you won't be taken alive.

1229
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:02,233
(solemn music)

1230
01:28:23,536 --> 01:28:26,286
(sirens blaring)

1231
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:35,973
(indistinct yelling)

1232
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:02,368
(ominous music)

1233
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:11,776
(slow paced music)

1234
01:29:38,137 --> 01:29:40,887
(birds chirping)

1235
01:30:09,782 --> 01:30:10,615
- Ed.

1236
01:30:12,237 --> 01:30:13,154
What is it?

1237
01:30:15,504 --> 01:30:18,421
(slow paced music)

1238
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,373
What is it?

1239
01:30:21,373 --> 01:30:22,733
- I ain't no hero.

1240
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:25,067
They keep calling me a hero.

1241
01:30:26,624 --> 01:30:29,550
- If you're not a hero then nobody is.

1242
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,083
You're as good as they come.

1243
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:33,950
- I thought I'd failed.

1244
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,500
I thought we were all going to die.

1245
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:42,453
Odessa,

1246
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:47,143
I was afraid.

1247
01:30:49,270 --> 01:30:50,370
- Oh we're all afraid,

1248
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:53,210
but you didn't die Edward.

1249
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:54,483
We're all safe.

1250
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:00,073
And this just makes us
know what's important.

1251
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:04,980
Every precious moment we have together

1252
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:07,850
with the ones we love.

1253
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:13,602
(slow paced music)

1254
01:31:32,358 --> 01:31:35,275
(slow paced music)

1255
01:31:49,324 --> 01:31:51,824
(light music)
