1
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,953
Operator: GOOD MORNING.
WALCOTT COOKIES.

2
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,955
NO, YOU'VE GOT
THE RIGHT NUMBER.

3
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:24,723
Man in costume:
HELLO THERE. HI.

4
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:26,175
HELLO, EVERYBODY.
HA HA!

5
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:27,893
BEST COOKIES
IN THE WORLD.

6
00:00:27,895 --> 00:00:29,645
HELLO THERE.

7
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,850
Woman: YES!

8
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,669
Man: MISS McKENZIE?

9
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,771
Charlie McKenzie: YES?

10
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:43,192
Man: YOU'RE NEXT.
GO ON IN.

11
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:46,512
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
HALLMARK CHANNEL
AND FRIENDS OF NCI

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,319
Man: NOW, MISS McKENZIE,

13
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,289
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT
SINCE WALCOTT COOKIES

14
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,124
HAS TAKEN OVER
THIS COMPANY,

15
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,893
WE'RE LOOKING TO TRIM
SOME OF THE FAT

16
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,761
FROM THE PREVIOUS
OPERATIONS.

17
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,497
Charlie: WELL, I CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T CALL MYSELF
PART OF THE FAT.

18
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:08,350
Man: MR. WALCOTT
WILL MEET WITH YOU
PERSONALLY IN AN HOUR.

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,436
Charlie: BUT--BUT THE WOMAN
RIGHT BEFORE ME--

20
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:11,603
Man: GOOD-BYE.

21
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:14,389
Charlie: THANK YOU.

22
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,612
Woman: SO, YOU HAVE TO MEET
WITH THE BIG MAN.

23
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,281
WOW. I WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE YOU.

24
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,783
Charlie: STACY,
I CAN'T LOSE THIS JOB.

25
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,786
WALCOTT HAS BOUGHT
ALL THE COMPETITORS
IN THIS TOWN.

26
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,321
I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

27
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,823
AND WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE TO MEET WITH ANYONE?

28
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:31,757
Stacy: FACE IT, BABE.

29
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,991
WHEN YOUR UNIT
MOVES MORE COOKIES

30
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:34,526
THAN THE REST OF
THE COMPANY COMBINED,

31
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,728
YOU'RE SITTING PRETTY
WHEN A TAKEOVER HAPPENS.

32
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:38,931
Charlie: WHAT'S THIS?

33
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,132
Stacy: WHEN ALL THIS
WENT DOWN,

34
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:41,800
I WENT TO THE WALCOTT
COOKIE WEB SITE.

35
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:43,235
I CLICKED ON
THE CORPORATE BUTTON

36
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,003
AND HAD THEM SEND ME,
A PERSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDER,

37
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,305
THE COMPANY PROFILE,

38
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,674
CHOCKED FULL OF
WALCOTT SOUND BITES.

39
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,642
YOU MEMORIZE THAT,
AND YOU ARE GOOD TO GO.

40
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,244
Charlie: THANKS FOR SHARING
THIS A LITTLE EARLIER.

41
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,012
Stacy: OH, SWEETIE,
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

42
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,848
AND--WELL, I HAD
TO MEMORIZE IT.

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,616
OK. LET'S LOOK
AT YOUR RESUME.

44
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,236
HMM. OREGON STATE.
YEAH!

45
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,921
NOT MUCH OF A FOOTBALL TEAM,
THOUGH, HUH?

46
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,857
Charlie: WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

47
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,692
Stacy: GUY TALK.
THE LOVE IT WHEN
YOU TALK SPORTS.

48
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,260
Charlie: SPORTS. RIGHT.

49
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:11,830
Stacy: 2003 GROSS SALES
FOR ALL WALCOTT
COOKIE DIVISIONS?

50
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:13,065
Charlie:
FISCAL OR CALENDER?

51
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,900
Stacy: FISCAL.
Charlie: 248 MILLION.

52
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,319
Stacy: OK. TOTAL PROJECTED
ADVERTISING EXPENDITURE?

53
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:22,841
Charlie: UNPUBLISHED:
14 MILLION. 62% SPOT TV.

54
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,942
Stacy: UNPUBLISHED?

55
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,794
Charlie: LOOK, I KNOW
WHO MY COMPETITORS ARE.

56
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:28,814
WELL, I KNOW WHO
MY COMPETITORS WERE.

57
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,136
SO...

58
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:35,337
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

59
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:38,390
Stacy: NO.

60
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,926
WALCOTT SAYS,
AND I QUOTE,

61
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,329
"WALCOTT COOKIES IS
AND ALWAYS WILL BE
A FAMILY COMPANY.

62
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,697
"OUR STABILITY
OVER 3 GENERATIONS

63
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,232
"HAS BEEN BASED
ON THE IDEALS

64
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,034
"THAT WE'VE IMPORTED INTO
OUR CORPORATE MOTTO.

65
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:52,738
"FAMILY, INTEGRITY, VALUE,

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,406
"AND STABILITY.

67
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,608
"NOTHING MEANS
MORE TO ME THAN
THOSE CORE VALUES.

68
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,377
"I EXPECT THEM
OF EVERY EMPLOYEE

69
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,163
"JUST AS THE CUSTOMER
EXPECTS NOTHING LESS

70
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,615
OF A WALCOTT COOKIE."

71
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,235
NOTHING SAYS
STABILITY MORE...

72
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:10,138
THAN A MARRIED WOMAN.

73
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,392
GO AHEAD. IT'S NOT
GOING TO BITE. JUST TRY IT.

74
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,694
Charlie: I DON'T NEED
TO BELONG TO SOMEONE
TO BE STABLE.

75
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,129
Stacy: MMM. MM-HMM.
I GOT IT.

76
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:18,130
JUST TAKE
THE WEDDING BAND.

77
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,298
Charlie: NO.

78
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,216
Stacy:
HAVE YOU NOT HEARD
A WORD I JUST SAID?

79
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,801
Charlie: YES.
I JUST DON'T THINK BEING
BETROTHED TO A MAN

80
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,436
IS THE MODEL OF STABILITY.

81
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,488
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT'S
HAPPENING WITH YOU AND TROY.

82
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,906
Stacy: HMM.

83
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,641
WELL,

84
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:30,943
TROY AND I ARE JUST...

85
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,245
GOING THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH,
THAT'S ALL.

86
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:35,814
Charlie: STACY,
HE MOVED OUT 3 MONTHS AGO.

87
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,482
Stacy: SO?
WE HAD A DATE
LAST WEEKEND.

88
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:39,001
Charlie:
YOU'RE DATING YOUR HUSBAND?

89
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,086
Stacy: OK, THIS IS NOT
ABOUT ME AND TROY, OK?

90
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,587
THIS IS ABOUT
MAKING SURE

91
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,157
THAT YOU'RE NOT
UNEMPLOYED IN
HALF AN HOUR.

92
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,842
WE ARE NOT TALKING
ABOUT MARRIAGE.

93
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:48,760
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
YOU KEEPING YOUR JOB,

94
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:51,113
A JOB YOU HAVE WORKED
YOUR BUTT OFF FOR.

95
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,339
Charlie: THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

96
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,724
LOOK, THIS--THIS IS A LIE.

97
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,643
Stacy: CHARLIE, YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.

98
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:07,545
THAT RING WILL OPEN UP
DOORS FOR YOU. TRY IT.

99
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,880
Charlie:
THESE RINGS ARE STUCK.

100
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,365
DO YOU HAVE LOTION?

101
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:11,383
Stacy:
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE.

102
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,218
YOU CAN GET IT BACK
TO ME LATER.

103
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,329
Charlie: HI.
CHARLIE McKENZIE.

104
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,530
I'M HERE TO SEE
MR. WALCOTT.

105
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,032
Woman: YOU CAN GO IN.
HE'S EXPECTING YOU.

106
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,534
Charlie: THANKS.

107
00:04:31,588 --> 00:04:33,071
Walcott: NO--LOOK,

108
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,173
NO, NO. I DON'T CARE
WHAT BOTCHNER THINKS.

109
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,975
THE FRENCH
ARE PREDATORS.

110
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,710
LOOK, IF THEY DON'T
FIX THE PRICE BY MONDAY,

111
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,711
HE'LL BE SHOVING
CHOCOLATES--

112
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,712
Man: HOW'S THAT, GOOD?

113
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,680
Walcott: YES.

114
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:44,249
TELL HIM I SAID THAT.
THANK YOU.

115
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,751
THANK YOU, GUYS.
THANK YOU.

116
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,152
HI. SORRY ABOUT
THE MESS.

117
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,353
I WON'T BE SETTLING IN
FOR A FEW MORE DAYS,

118
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,622
AND PARDON
MY FRENCH EARLIER.

119
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,291
Charlie: OH. NO...

120
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,593
IT'S ACTUALLY--
IT'S AN INTERESTING PHRASE.

121
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,095
"PARDON MY FRENCH."
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

122
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,563
FRENCH ARE KNOWN FOR
THEIR FOUL LANGUAGE.

123
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,598
Walcott: THEY'RE FOUL
ALL RIGHT,

124
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,899
AND THEY'RE KILLING
MY MARGINS ON CREAMOS.

125
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,117
EDWARD WALCOTT.

126
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,919
Charlie: OH, I'M SORRY.
CHARLIE McKENZIE.

127
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,604
Edward: PREDATORS.
Charlie: WHAT'S THAT?

128
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:06,688
Edward: UH, THE FRENCH.

129
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,939
PREDATORY PRICING.

130
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,274
THEY LOVE OUR COOKIES,
BUT THEY HATE TO
ADMIT IT.

131
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,342
SO THEY SQUEEZE ME
OUT OF THE MARKET

132
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,810
BY CUTTING
THEIR PRICES,

133
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,145
AND THE GOVERNMENT
SUBSIDIZES THEIR LOSSES.

134
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,180
Charlie: SO YOU SAY THAT
THEY LOVE YOUR COOKIES.

135
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:16,515
Edward: THE FRENCH?
OH, YEAH. THEY LOVE 'EM.

136
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,482
THEY'RE COOKIE CRAZY.

137
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,850
IT'S A INTERNATIONAL
SCANDAL.

138
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,052
Charlie: YOU COULD RAISE
YOUR PRICES

139
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,154
AND INCREASE YOUR
MARKETING EXPENDITURE.

140
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,823
THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE
SHOULD JUSTIFY IT.

141
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,459
AND THEN YOU JUST
PLAY UP THE QUALITY ANGLE.

142
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,995
WE MAY COST MORE,
BUT WE'RE WORTH IT.

143
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:33,165
Edward: WELL, THAT'S
AN INTERESTING APPROACH.

144
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,200
WINSTON SAID
YOU WERE GOOD.

145
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,368
AH! OREGON STATE.

146
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,754
Charlie: OH, YES.
EXCELLENT MARKETING PROGRAM.

147
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,305
LOUSY FOOTBALL TEAM,
THOUGH.

148
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:41,406
Edward: UH-HUH. YEAH.

149
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,058
MY BROTHER JUST STARTED
THERE AS HEAD COACH.

150
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,443
Charlie: [CHUCKLES]
WELL, I DID HEAR

151
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,279
THAT THEY'RE HAVING
A REBUILDING YEAR.

152
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,681
SO I'M SURE HE'S GONNA
TURN THEM AROUND.

153
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,616
Edward: ARE YOU TRYING
TO KISS UP TO ME,
McKENZIE?

154
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,935
Charlie: NO, IT'S JUST
THAT THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD
WHEN I WAS THERE.

155
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,354
Edward: A SIMPLE
YES OR NO WILL DO.

156
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,756
Charlie: YES, SIR,
I--I WAS KISSING UP TO YOU.

157
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,958
Edward: [LAUGHS]
I LIKE YOU.

158
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,593
McKENZIE,
YOU GOT JUST THE RIGHT
AMOUNT OF BONE.

159
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,161
FROM WHAT I'VE READ
IN YOUR PERFORMANCE REVIEWS,

160
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,563
YOU'RE JUST WHAT
WE NEED AROUND HERE.

161
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,630
YOU BEEN MARRIED LONG?

162
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,150
Charlie: HMM?
Edward: THE ROCK.

163
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,869
Charlie: OH. ACTUALLY--

164
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,738
Edward: [LAUGHS]
I HEARD THIS JOKE
AT THE, UH...

165
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,339
AT THE CLUB
THE OTHER DAY.

166
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,776
WHAT'S THE LONGEST SENTENCE
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

167
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,411
I DO.

168
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,913
IT'S SO SHORT.

169
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,248
I JUST LOVE THAT.

170
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,067
OH, MAN.

171
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:26,785
UM--SO--SO HOW LONG?

172
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:27,853
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN MARRIED?

173
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:28,887
Charlie: YEARS.

174
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,522
UM, ACTUALLY, UH,

175
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:34,326
TODAY IS MY
8 1/2 YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

176
00:06:34,328 --> 00:06:37,629
I'M JUST SO SENTIMENTAL
FOR ANNIVERSARIES.

177
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,464
ANNIVERSARIES AND SPORTS.

178
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,799
IT'S--IT'S MY LIFE.

179
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,384
MICHAEL JORDAN'S BIRTHDAY,
I JUST, LIKE, CRY.

180
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:43,935
Edward: YEAH.
I'M SENTIMENTAL, TOO.

181
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,170
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR 15 YEARS.

182
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,738
GOT A LITTLE BOY,
12 YEARS--

183
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,839
WELL, HE'S
12 YEARS OLD NOW.

184
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,474
THAT WAS A WHILE BACK.
LITTLE ROBBIE.

185
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,009
I MISS HIM LIKE--
LIKE CRAZY.

186
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,795
HE'S BACK EAST WITH
HIS GRANDPARENTS

187
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,547
THAT SQUIRREL
WAS ROBBIE'S IDEA.

188
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,648
THE LOGO.

189
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,083
Edward: KIDS?
Charlie: KIDS?

190
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,551
AS IN...DO YOU HAVE ANY?

191
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,952
Charlie: OH--OH. YEAH.

192
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:02,988
KIDS. I DEFINITELY--
I--I HAVE KIDS.

193
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,123
I HAVE ONE--ONE--
ONE KID.

194
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:07,159
Edward: BOY? GIRL?
Charlie: YES...GIRL.

195
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,226
Edward: AM I
MAKING YOU NERVOUS?

196
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,428
Charlie: YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

197
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,595
Edward: YEAH.
A LITTLE BIT. YEAH.

198
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,880
THAT'S OK.
I UNDERSTAND.

199
00:07:11,882 --> 00:07:13,215
A POTENTIAL NEW BOSS
AND ALL.

200
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,633
AHEM. OK.

201
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:16,968
FAMILY, INTEGRITY,
VALUES, STABILITY.

202
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,104
NOTHING IS MORE
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN
THOSE CORE VALUES.

203
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,305
I EXPECT THEM OF
EVERY EMPLOYEE

204
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,339
JUST AS EVERY CUSTOMER

205
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,941
EXPECTS NOTHING LESS
OF A WALCOTT COOKIE.

206
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,042
Charlie: SO WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT

207
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,026
MY PERFORMANCE REVIEWS?

208
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,011
Edward: OH, NO.

209
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,712
THAT'S JUST A BUNCH
OF PAPER

210
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,214
WITH SOME
MIDDLE MANAGER'S
RAMBLINGS ON IT.

211
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,615
IT DOESN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING ABOUT
THE PERSON

212
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,183
RIGHT IN HERE,
ALL RIGHT?

213
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,535
LISTEN, I'M A LITTLE BIT
LATE FOR MY NEXT MEETING,

214
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,170
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TAG ALONG?

215
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:39,191
YEAH, WE'RE A FAMILY
COMPANY, CHARLIE.

216
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:40,725
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS?

217
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,026
Charlie: THAT THE COMPANY
HAS BEEN HANDED DOWN

218
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,395
FROM GENERATION
TO GENERATION.

219
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,846
Edward: WRONG. IT MEANS
WE CARE ABOUT FAMILIES.

220
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:46,181
WE BELIEVE IN
THE POWER OF FAMILIES.

221
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:48,183
FAMILIES EAT
WALCOTT COOKIES, CHARLIE.

222
00:07:48,185 --> 00:07:50,068
SO WE HAVE TO THINK
LIKE A FAMILY.

223
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,703
LET ME SHOW YOU.

224
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,372
Charlie: THE BREAK ROOM.

225
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,307
Edward: NOPE, NOT ANYMORE.

226
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,775
THIS IS OUR IN-HOUSE
DAY CARE CENTER.

227
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,743
3 FULL-TIME TEACHERS
WILL PROVIDE A SAFE

228
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,961
AND EDUCATIONAL
ENVIRONMENT

229
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:02,013
FOR UP TO
20 CHILDREN A DAY.

230
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,399
A HAPPY EMPLOYEE IS
A PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYEE.

231
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,319
Charlie:
OH. WE WERE VERY HAPPY
WITH OUR OLD BREAK ROOM.

232
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,371
Edward: LOOK,
I KNOW THIS WHOLE
TAKEOVER BUSINESS

233
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,139
IS VERY TRAUMATIC,

234
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:11,890
BUT THE FACT IS
THE STOCK OF YOUR
OLD COMPANY

235
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,091
WAS DROPPING
LIKE A ROCK.

236
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,693
IT WAS JUST
A MATTER OF TIME

237
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:16,194
BEFORE ALL OF YOU
COULD HAVE BEEN
OUT OF WORK, SO...

238
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:18,430
Charlie: MR. WALCOTT,
ABOUT THE WHOLE
FAMILY THING--

239
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:19,564
Edward: I KNOW.
IT'S WONDERFUL,
ISN'T IT.

240
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,183
IT'S POWERFUL IDEA.
IT'S A MONEYMAKER, TOO.

241
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,617
LOOK, I'M GONNA
SLEEP ON THIS TONIGHT.

242
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,570
YOU COME SEE ME
TOMORROW MORNING,
AND WE'LL TALK, OK?

243
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:28,106
Charlie: WAIT. SIR?

244
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,859
OK.

245
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,436
Charlie: HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

246
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,523
I LIED TO THE THE CEO
OF WALCOTT COOKIES.

247
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,424
Stacy: I THOUGHT THE IDEA
WAS TO KEEP THE JOB

248
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,426
YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD FOR
ALL THESE YEARS.

249
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,561
Charlie: I LIED.

250
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,130
AND AFTER ALL OF THOSE YEARS
OF MY FATHER LYING,

251
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:56,568
I SAID THAT I WOULDN'T
BE LIKE THAT.

252
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,919
Stacy: IT IS AMAZING

253
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,071
THAT EVEN THE THOUGHT
OF AN IMAGINARY RELATIONSHIP

254
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,974
IS MAKING YOU
FREAK OUT.

255
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:07,045
Charlie:
THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

256
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,396
Stacy: WHO'S KIDDING?

257
00:09:08,398 --> 00:09:10,749
Charlie:
I--I DON'T NEED A MAN,

258
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,551
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T
NEED A MARRIAGE.

259
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,753
Stacy: WELL, I DON'T
REGRET ANY OF IT.

260
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,538
AT THE VERY LEAST,
I HAVE NICOLE.

261
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,556
Charlie:
YEAH, AND THAT'S GREAT,

262
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:20,525
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE MOTHERING TYPE.

263
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,427
IT'S ALL MY PARENTS FAULT.

264
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,563
Stacy: YOUR DAD
WAS A WORKAHOLIC.

265
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,282
Charlie: YEAH.
AND MY MOTHER?

266
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:30,218
MY MOTHER WAS SO CAUGHT UP
IN HER FANCY HOME

267
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,636
AND ALL HER PARTIES

268
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:34,155
THAT SHE PUT
THE NEEDS AND WANTS
OF HER DAUGHTER LAST.

269
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,007
Stacy:
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

270
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,342
YOUR MOTHER
LOVED YOU VERY MUCH,

271
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,643
AND EVEN THOUGH
HE DIDN'T SAY IT,

272
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,311
WE BOTH KNOW THAT YOUR
FATHER LOVED YOU, TOO,

273
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,863
IN HIS OWN WAY.

274
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:43,765
Charlie: THEIR WHOLE
MARRIAGE WAS A FARCE.

275
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,083
Stacy: DID IT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU

276
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,901
THAT YOU'RE EXACTLY
LIKE YOUR FATHER?

277
00:09:46,903 --> 00:09:50,555
THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T KEEP
A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP.

278
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,191
WORK ALWAYS COMES FIRST.

279
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,760
YOU CAN HAVE BOTH.
YOU JUST CHOOSE NOT TO.

280
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,128
Charlie: THAT IS NOT TRUE.

281
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,530
I HAVEN'T MET
THE RIGHT GUY.

282
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,864
Stacy:
OH, CHARLIE, COME ON.

283
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,866
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
THE TRUTH HERE.

284
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:10,241
Charlie: YOU'RE RIGHT.

285
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,177
TOMORROW MORNING
WHEN I MEET WITH
WALCOTT AGAIN,

286
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,145
JOB OR NO JOB,
I'M TELLING HIM THE TRUTH.

287
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,547
Stacy:
YOU DO THAT,

288
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,482
AND YOU'LL BE COLLECTING
UNEMPLOYMENT.

289
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,778
Edward: LOYALTY IS CRUCIAL.

290
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,479
IF WE DON'T MAKE
AN EXAMPLE TODAY,

291
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,665
IT'S TOO LATE
TO DO IT TOMORROW.

292
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,933
Man: ASHTON--

293
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,134
Edward: I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE TOLD YOU.
HE LIED TO ME.

294
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,402
SO I WANT HIS STUFF
OUT OF HERE BY NOON.

295
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,436
Man:
I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

296
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:40,405
Edward: OK, BROOKE,
WHAT'S NEXT?

297
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,008
OH. UH, CHARLIE.
HOW ARE YOU?

298
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,310
Charlie: MR. WALCOTT,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

299
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,277
Edward: I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU, TOO.

300
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,512
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU

301
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,513
SINCE OUR MEETING
YESTERDAY.

302
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,247
BROOKE, I WANT YOU
TO HOLD ALL MY CALLS.

303
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,082
HERE, COME WITH ME.

304
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,934
Charlie:
MR. WALCOTT, THERE'S
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW.

305
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:54,819
Edward: NO, NO, NO.
CHARLIE, I KNOW.

306
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,054
I ALREADY KNOW.

307
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,540
CHARLIE,
YOU'RE JUST RIGHT
FOR WALCOTT COOKIES.

308
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,225
YOU GOT THE BACKGROUND,
THE EXPERIENCE,

309
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,726
AND JUST THE RIGHT
ATTITUDE.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

310
00:11:01,728 --> 00:11:04,663
Charlie: I'D LOVE TO,
BUT, MR. WALCOTT--

311
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,747
Edward: NO, NO, NO, NO.
COME HERE.

312
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,881
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

313
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:07,999
YOU'RE GONNA--
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE--

314
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,217
Woman: GOOD MORNING,
MR. WALCOTT.

315
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:11,186
Edward: MORNING.
RIGHT IN HERE.

316
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:15,306
MM-HMM.

317
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,809
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

318
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,812
Charlie: [SIGHS] THIS IS
MY OLD BOSS' OFFICE.

319
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:21,980
Edward: OH, NO,
NOT ANY MORE.

320
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,214
NOW IT'S YOURS.

321
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,850
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF MOVING ALL YOUR
STUFF IN HERE.

322
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,318
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
THE WINDOWS.

323
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,387
I MEAN,
IT'S A CORNER OFFICE.

324
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,072
Charlie: BUT, SIR,
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT.

325
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,390
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

326
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,391
Man: GOOD MORNING,
MR. WALCOTT.

327
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,126
Edward:
COME ON IN, PETER.

328
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,095
UH, PETER BRADLEY,
CHARLIE McKENZIE.

329
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,296
Peter: HELLO, MISS McKENZIE.

330
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,764
Charlie: HI.

331
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,199
Edward: CHARLIE MIGHT BE
STAYING ON WITH US.

332
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,200
Peter:
CONGRATULATIONS.

333
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,334
Charlie: THANK YOU.

334
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,336
Peter: UH, HERE'S THAT
REPORT THAT YOU WANTED.

335
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,337
Edward: THANK YOU, PETER.

336
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,156
Peter: IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU.

337
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:51,676
Charlie: YEAH. LIKEWISE.

338
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,112
OH, MY GOODNESS.

339
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,231
Edward: YEAH. YOU KNOW,
PETER'S A GREAT GUY.

340
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,366
HE MIGHT BE
PERFECT FOR YOU.

341
00:11:58,368 --> 00:11:59,617
Charlie: PERFECT FOR ME?
AS YOUR ASSISTANT.

342
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:04,055
Edward: WELL, YEAH.
I CAN'T HAVE MY EXECUTIVES

343
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,123
TIED DOWN WITH
THE MUNDANE.

344
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,392
I NEED YOU OUT THERE
THINKING, INNOVATING.

345
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,960
Charlie: ABOUT THAT, I--

346
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,045
Edward: CHARLIE, YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SALARY.

347
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:12,530
Charlie:
NO. NO, SIR. I--

348
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,733
Edward: THAT'S OK.
LET'S--LET'S DO THIS NOW,

349
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,367
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY.

350
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:17,836
HERE YOU GO.

351
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,254
HERE.

352
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,856
Edward:
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

353
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,292
Edward: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

354
00:12:24,294 --> 00:12:25,410
OF COURSE YOU KNOW
THAT'S JUST TO START.

355
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,195
THERE'LL BE BONUSES
AND STOCK OPTIONS.

356
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,164
Charlie:
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

357
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,582
IS THAT A PERIOD
OR A COMMA?

358
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,301
Edward: OH, YEAH.
SORRY. THAT'S, UH,
THAT'S A COMMA.

359
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:37,038
Charlie: WELL, THAT IS
A VERY NICE COMMA, SIR.

360
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,423
[SIGHS]

361
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,091
Edward: WELL, LIKE I SAID,
WE WANNA...

362
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,609
WE WANNA KEEP YOU,
CHARLIE.

363
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,528
NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING
YOU WANTED TO TELL ME?

364
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,698
Charlie:
WELL, I JUST--I, UM...

365
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,233
I JUST--I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THAT-

366
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,135
Edward: [LAUGHS] YEAH?

367
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:51,753
CAT'S GOT YOUR TONGUE.

368
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,272
YOU CAN'T SPEAK, CAN YOU?
THAT'S THE WALCOTT WAY.

369
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,740
LOOK, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

370
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,242
WE'LL CELEBRATE
THIS WEEKEND OVER DINNER.

371
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,943
YOU PICK THE PLACE.
CONGRATULATIONS, CHARLIE.

372
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,646
I CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOUR FAMILY.

373
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,849
Charlie: THANK YOU?

374
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,284
Stacy: SWEETIE,
IT IS SIMPLE.

375
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,120
WE'LL INVITE
THE WALCOTTS OVER FOR
A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

376
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,355
YOU CAN USE MY HOUSE.

377
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,190
BUT FIRST, WE HAVE
TO FIND YOU A HUSBAND.

378
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,025
Nicole: YOU'RE GETTING
MARRIED, CHARLIE?!

379
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,410
Charlie:
OH. NO. NO, NO, NO.

380
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,295
YOUR MOM AND I ARE JUST
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

381
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,180
TO PRETEND TO BE
MARRIED TO ME.

382
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:21,166
Nicole:
TOMMY'S DAD DID THAT

383
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:23,101
AND GOT THROWN
OUT OF HIS HOUSE.

384
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,804
Charlie:
OH. NOT THAT KIND, NICOLE.

385
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,039
Stacy:
CHARLIE'S JUST HAVING SOME
FRIENDS FOR DINNER,

386
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,625
AND SHE WOULD LIKE
SOMEONE TO APPEAR
TO BE HER HUSBAND.

387
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:32,911
SHE NEEDS A DAUGHTER, TOO,
SO I VOLUNTEERED YOU.

388
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,081
Nicole:
OK. OK, I'LL DO IT...

389
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,317
BUT HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

390
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:44,189
Stacy: OK.
ESCORT SERVICES.

391
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,374
Charlie: OH...
NO, NO, NO. NO.

392
00:13:46,376 --> 00:13:47,458
I DON'T THINK SO.

393
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,827
WE NEED
A PROFESSIONAL HERE.

394
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,228
Stacy: CHARLIE...

395
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,779
THESE GUYS
ARE PROFESSIONALS.

396
00:13:51,781 --> 00:13:54,883
Charlie: NO! NOT THAT KIND
OF PROFESSIONAL.

397
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:57,702
NOW WHAT ABOUT
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW RHONDA?

398
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,654
Stacy: OH. WELL,
SHE IS A LITTLE HAIRY.

399
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:03,007
Charlie: NO. DIDN'T SHE
USED TO WORK FOR THAT--
THAT TALENT AGENT...

400
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,577
THE GUY WHOSE CLIENTS
WERE IN CATS?

401
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,828
Stacy: MARVIN GOLD?

402
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,113
YEAH, BUT I THINK
IT WAS A COMMERCIAL
FOR CAT FOOD.

403
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,733
Charlie: OH. OK. WELL,
HE CAN FIND US AN ACTOR,

404
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,618
SOMEONE TO PLAY
MY HUSBAND.

405
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,919
Stacy:
CAT FOOD OR CAT LITTER?

406
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,120
Charlie: IT DOESN'T MATTER.

407
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,590
WELL, HE DOES REPRESENT
HUMANS, RIGHT?

408
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,291
Stacy: YEAH.
SURE, I GUESS.

409
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:22,026
Charlie: OK.
SO THIS IS PERFECT.

410
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,345
WE HIRE AN ACTOR,
A PROFESSIONAL.

411
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:26,998
SOMEONE WHO HAS
THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME:

412
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,167
MY HUSBAND.

413
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:33,354
Marvin: GET OUT OF HERE!

414
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:38,076
NEVER LIGHTEN
YOUR HAIR OR DARKEN
MY DOOR AGAIN, HUH?

415
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,546
Stacy: I HOPE
HE FOUND SOMEONE.

416
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,381
I'M SURE HE HAS
DOZENS OF ACTORS.

417
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:46,784
DID YOU SEE THOSE
STACKS OF PICTURES?

418
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,456
Marvin: HEY, UH, LADIES!

419
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,325
COME ON IN.

420
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,297
Stacy: HAVE YOU
BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT?

421
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,799
Marvin:
NO. I JUST GOT HERE.
I SLEPT LIKE A BABY.

422
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:04,168
COFFEE?

423
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,307
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF GIVING THE GUYS
SOME PAGES TO PERFORM.

424
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,075
IT'S A LITTLE PIECE

425
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,610
OF THE RUSSIAN
ROULETTE SCENE

426
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,912
FROM APOCALYPSE NOW.

427
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,613
Stacy: THE DEER HUNTER.
Marvin: HUH?

428
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,849
Stacy: THE RUSSIAN ROULETTE
SCENE'S ACTUALLY...

429
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:18,933
DEER HUNTER.

430
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:20,585
Charlie: MAYBE WE CAN
JUST MEET THEM.

431
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,503
Marvin: OK.
SUIT YOURSELF.

432
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,422
IT'S YOUR DIME.

433
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,757
HA HA HA!

434
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,158
LADIES...

435
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,429
THIS IS
SHELDON HORNWALL.

436
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,014
Sheldon: HI.

437
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,265
Charlie: HI, SHELDON.

438
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,135
Sheldon: I'VE PREPARED
A SHORT SCENE FOR YOU.

439
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,137
Charlie: OH...

440
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,888
UH, YEAH.
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

441
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,158
WE JUST WANT TO SEE
HOW WELL YOU CAN IMPROVISE.

442
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:47,211
Sheldon: YEAH.
I GUESS I CAN DO THAT.

443
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,263
Charlie: OH, GREAT.

444
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:52,050
LET'S--LET'S--LET'S
SIT HERE, AND--AND, UH,

Charlie: OH.
LOOK, HONEY.

449
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,762
THEY HAVE THAT
ROAST LAMB YOU LIKE.

450
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:06,481
Sheldon: YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE LAMB.

451
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,167
IT MAKES ME GASSY.

452
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,102
Charlie: WELL,
YOU ALWAYS LIKE IT
WHEN I MAKE IT.

453
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,638
Sheldon: OK. OK.

454
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,006
I'LL HAVE THE LAMB.

455
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:15,990
[CRYING] I'LL HAVE THE LAMB.

456
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:19,010
JUST DON'T YELL AT ME!

457
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,845
Stacy: UH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
SHELDON?

458
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:22,480

Marvin: IF ARE GONNA
SCARE ALL THESE GUYS,

463
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,323
WE'RE NEVER GONNA

464
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,076
Charlie: WELL,
I ASKED YOU FOR A MAN,
NOT A MOUSE.

465
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,812
Marvin: YOU WANT A MAN?

466
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,832
I'LL GIVE YOU A MAN.

467
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,202

478
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,215
Charlie: HOW ABOUT A MOVIE?

480
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:19,037
THEN AFTER, WE CAN TAKE
A WALK ALONG THE RIVER.

481
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,538
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT.

482
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,773
Charlie: THAT

483
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,875
Marcus: THEN I SUPPOSE
WE SHOULD GO.

484
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,810
I WANNA MAKE SURE

00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,809
Gold: HEY! HEY! WAIT!

491
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,528

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,147
Stacy: WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
HE WAS PERFECT.

493
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,316
Charlie: HE WAS A PIG.

494
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,535
Stacy: YOU ARE NOT ACTUALLY
MARRYING HIM, CHARLIE.

495
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,603
HE IS PLAYING A ROLE.

496
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:56,157
Charlie: OH, FINE.
CAN I SEE SOME
MORE PICTURES?

497
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,145

00:25:08,858 --> 00:25:10,858
AND YOU'RE A DEDICATED
HUSBAND AND FATHER.

680
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,193
GET OUT THERE
AND PRETEND YOU LOVE ME.

681
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:15,162
Buck: WAIT.
WHY CAN'T I JUST BE BUCK?

682
00:25:15,164 --> 00:25:17,998
Charlie: HA HA HA! YEAH.

683
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,533
NO ONE'S REALLY NAMED BUCK.

684
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:20,901
COME ON.

685
00:25:20,903 --> 00:25:22,403
Buck: SO,
WHAT'S SHE PAYING YOU?

686
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:26,407
Nicole: PAY? YOU MEAN
YOU'RE GETTING PAID?

687
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,475
Charlie: ENOUGH. LET'S GO.

688
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:31,378
Nicole: I WANNA TALK
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS.

689
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,130
Charlie: FINE. LATER, OK?

690
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,749
Nicole: SURE,
BUT TIME IS MONEY.

691
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,351
RIGHT, DAD?

692
00:25:37,353 --> 00:25:38,919
Charlie: DON'T ANSWER THAT.

693
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:47,161
LOOK WHO'S BACK.

694
00:25:47,163 --> 00:25:49,697
FRANK, THIS IS EDWARD
AND VICTORIA WALCOTT.

695
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:51,899
Edward: OH, FRANK,
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

696
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,601
I HOPE OUR EARLY ARRIVAL
DIDN'T MESS YOU GUYS UP.

697
00:25:53,603 --> 00:25:55,502
Buck: DON'T BE SILLY, ED.
MAY I CALL YOU ED?

698
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:56,470
Edward: WELL, YEAH.

699
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,339
Buck: MRS. WALCOTT,

700
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:01,308
YOU ARE CERTAINLY
IN FINE SHAPE.

701
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,444
YOU WORK OUT, RIGHT? HUH?

702
00:26:03,446 --> 00:26:04,378
Charlie: FRANK.

703
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,679
Victoria:
THAT'S OK, CHARLIE.

704
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:08,048
I APPRECIATE A MAN NOTICING.

705
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,251
Buck: ED,
YOU LUCKY MAN, YOU.
LOOK AT THIS WOMAN!

706
00:26:10,253 --> 00:26:11,585
YOU LOOK FANTASTIC!

707
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:12,453
Charlie: HONEY.

708
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:14,421
Edward: WELL, SHE'S--

709
00:26:14,423 --> 00:26:16,290
Charlie: HONEY,
DON'T YOU NEED TO GO
START THE BARBECUE?

710
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:17,291
Buck: GO AHEAD, BABE.

711
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:18,692
Charlie: GEE,
YOU LOVE BUG, I WOULD,

712
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:21,996
BUT I DON'T THINK
I KNOW WHICH KNOB TO TURN.

713
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,497
Buck: OH. WOMEN.

714
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:24,815
Charlie: EXCUSE ME.

715
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,433
Edward: UH-HUH.

716
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,169
Nicole: HOW DO
YOU KEEP YOUR FIGURE?

717
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,272
DO YOU MOSTLY DO
CARDIO OR YOGA?

718
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:34,074
Charlie: NICOLE, WOULD
YOU COME HELP YOUR FATHER?

719
00:26:34,076 --> 00:26:35,909
Nicole: OK.

720
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,014
Charlie: OK, THIS
IS NOT WORKING.

721
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,699
Buck: I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING
PRETTY WELL FOR IMPROV.

722
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,217
USUALLY I WORK
WITH A SCRIPT.

723
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:45,119
Charlie: "ED,
YOU LUCKY GUY, YOU"?

724
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:48,155
Buck: HE HAS
A BEAUTIFUL WIFE.
I WAS JUST BREAKING THE ICE.

725
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:49,390
Charlie: WELL, IT WAS
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE.

726
00:26:49,392 --> 00:26:51,091
AND YOU,
NOT ANOTHER WORD, OK?

727
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:54,511
WE ARE GOING
TO BE THE QUIETEST,
HAPPIEST FAMILY EVER.

728
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,264
Nicole: NOT FOR WHAT
WE'RE BEING PAID.

729
00:26:57,266 --> 00:26:59,533
RIGHT, DAD?

730
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,936
Charlie: OK. BARBECUE.

731
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:06,774
YOU GO HELP.
SWEETIE? COME ON.

732
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:11,862
FRESHEN UP YOUR DRINKS?

733
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,614
Edward: OH, NO.

734
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:16,533
Victoria:
I LIKE HIM, CHARLIE.
SPEAKS HIS MIND.

735
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,335
Charlie: THAT'S MY FRANKIE.

736
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,171
Victoria: I LIKE A MAN
WHO SPEAKS HIS MIND.

737
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:24,508
Edward: OH, HE'S DIRECT.
THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY.

738
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,679
I'M DIRECT, VICTORIA.
I SPEAK MY MIND.

739
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,369
Edward: OH, HE'S DIRECT.
THAT'S A GOOD QUALITY.

740
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:38,522
Victoria: WELL, IT WAS CUTE.

741
00:27:38,524 --> 00:27:40,607
Edward: SO,
HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

742
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,327
Buck: WELL, THAT'S A STORY
THAT'LL MAKE A MOVIE.

743
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,845
Victoria: WELL, TELL US.

744
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:48,248
Buck: IT'S A LONG STORY.

745
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,616
Charlie: REALLY LONG STORY.

746
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:51,485
Edward: OH, JUST TELL US THE
SHORT VERSION.

747
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:55,556
Nicole: YEAH, GIVE 'EM
THE SHORT VERSION, DAD.

748
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:57,558
Charlie: DO YOU GUYS
WANT SOME DESSERT?

749
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,361
Edward: OH, NO. NO. NO.
GO AHEAD, FRANK.

750
00:28:00,363 --> 00:28:02,229
I LOVE A GOOD STORY.

751
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:04,248
Buck: WELL...

752
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,369
IT WAS FEBRUARY, 2 DAYS
BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY.

753
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,903
YOU GUYS ARE NEW
TO THE WEST COAST,

754
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,472
SO YOU'LL FIND OUT
THAT FEBRUARY

755
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:16,143
IS A VERY...WET...MONTH.

756
00:28:16,145 --> 00:28:17,761
IT WAS POURING.
I WAS GETTING DRENCHED.

757
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,881
A TAXI CAB PULLED UP TO
A RED LIGHT.

758
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:22,716
I JUMPED INSIDE FOR SHELTER,

759
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:27,037
AND SITTING IN THE BACKSEAT
IS MY DREAM GIRL.

760
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,557
MY BEAUTIFUL CHARLIE.

761
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,292
SHE WASN'T STARTLED.

762
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,261
SHE JUST SMILED AND NODDED.

763
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:38,065
I FELT LIKE MY HEART
WAS ABOUT TO LEAP
OUT OF MY CHEST.

764
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,768
I WAS...SPEECHLESS.

765
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,636
Charlie: OH, HONEY,
YOU'RE BORING THEM.

766
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,538
Edward: NO. NO.
NO, HE'S NOT.

767
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,739
STOP THAT. GO AHEAD.

768
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:48,342
Buck: WELL, SHE JUST
GOT OUT ON HER STOP,

769
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:50,077
WESTSIDE MALL.

770
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,478
I RAN AFTER HER,
BUT LOST HER IN THE CROWD.

771
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,047
Victoria: WELL, HOW DID YOU
END UP TOGETHER?

772
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:58,852
Buck: WELL, THIS IS THE PART
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

773
00:28:58,854 --> 00:29:00,721
Charlie: THAT'S
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

774
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:03,223
Buck: I DIDN'T
KNOW HER NAME.

775
00:29:03,225 --> 00:29:05,292
DIDN'T HAVE
AN ADDRESS, NOTHING.

776
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:09,196
SO, A YEAR TO THE DAY,
A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE
VALENTINE'S DAY,

777
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,298
I FIND MYSELF
AT A FLOWER SHOP.

778
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,200
THAT LITTLE VOICE IN MY HEAD

779
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:17,304
SAYS, "BUY ROSES."

780
00:29:17,306 --> 00:29:21,241
SO I GO INSIDE, BUY A DOZEN
LONG-STEMMED ROSES

781
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:23,343
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

782
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,679
IT STARTS TO RAIN.

783
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,681
I'M WALKING HOME,

784
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,485
WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, BANG!
THERE SHE IS!

785
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:34,254
SITTING IN A TAXI CAB
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

786
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:37,441
I RUSH OVER, JUMP INSIDE,
HAND HER THE ROSES,

787
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,493
AND ASK HER TO MARRY ME
ON THE SPOT.

788
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,228
Victoria: AND SHE SAYS YES?

789
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,030
Buck: RIGHT THEN
AND RIGHT THERE.

790
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:46,233
Victoria: OH, HOW ROMANTIC!

791
00:29:46,235 --> 00:29:48,268
Nicole: HE'S VERY GOOD.

792
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,720
Charlie: SHH.

793
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:52,489
Edward: WELL, I THINK
SHE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

794
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:56,944
Charlie: WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF LOSING
THIS BIG ROMANTIC.

795
00:29:56,946 --> 00:29:59,780
Buck: OH. MWAH!

796
00:29:59,782 --> 00:30:01,615
Edward: THAT STEAK
WAS WONDERFUL.

797
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:03,350
DID I TASTE
SOME NUTMEG IN THAT?

798
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:05,352
Buck: YES.

799
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:08,355
IT'S CHARLIE'S
MOTHER'S RECIPE, ACTUALLY.

800
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:10,457
YOU GUYS GOTTA COME OVER
FOR HER LAMB CHOPS SOMETIME.

801
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:11,892
THEY'RE FABULOUS.

802
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,193
Victoria: OH!

803
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:14,828
Edward: LAMB CHOPS
ARE MY FAVORITE.

804
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,097
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO THAT REALLY SOON.

805
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:19,032
Nicole: I'LL
CLEAN THE TABLE, MOM.

806
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,367
Nicole: THANK YOU, SWEETIE.

807
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:21,535
Victoria: I'LL HELP, NICOLE.

808
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:24,037
Edward: SO, YOU ENJOY
THE CLUB HERE?

809
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,005
Buck: THE CLUB?

810
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,206
Edward: YEAH,
THE GOLF CLUB.

811
00:30:26,208 --> 00:30:27,641
YOU CAN'T TELL ME

812
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:29,476
YOU LIVE ON A BEAUTIFUL
COURSE LIKE THIS,
AND NEVER PLAY.

813
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:31,645
Buck: I'VE NEVER
PLAYED A DAY IN MY LIFE.

814
00:30:31,647 --> 00:30:32,880
Charlie: FRANK. HONEY.

815
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:34,648
Buck: HA! JUST KIDDING!

816
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,583
YEAH. ACTUALLY, I'M OUT
THERE EVERY CHANCE I GET.

817
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:39,620
Edward: OH, WELL,
WHAT DO YOU HIT, FRANK?

818
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,989
Buck: WELL, I'M SURE
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR
WHAT YOU HIT, ED.

819
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,259
Edward: I'M ABOUT
A 16 HANDICAP.

820
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:48,295
Buck: WELL, THERE YOU GO.
SEE, I'M ONLY AN 8 HANDICAP.

821
00:30:48,297 --> 00:30:50,564
Edward: YOU'RE
AN 8 HANDICAP?

822
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,267
Victoria: HONEY, DO WE
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT GOLF
AT EVERY MEAL?

823
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:56,069
Edward: THE MAN SAYS HE'S AN
8 HANDICAP, VICTORIA.

824
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,204
Victoria: SO,
HE'S AN 8 HANDICAP.

825
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,206
Buck: IS THAT WRONG?

826
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,477
ACTUALLY, I'M MORE
LIKE A 6 OR, YOU KNOW, 4.

827
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,679
Edward: NOW, YOU'RE
TOYING WITH ME, FRANK.

828
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,514
I LIKE THAT. I LIKE THAT.

829
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:08,982
YOU HEAR THAT, CHARLIE?
HE LIKES THAT.

830
00:31:08,984 --> 00:31:10,283
Charlie: HA HA!

831
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,451
Buck: HUH?

832
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,020
Edward: GOLF IS MY PASSION.

833
00:31:13,022 --> 00:31:15,756
Buck: FOR ME,
IT'S A RELIGION.

834
00:31:15,758 --> 00:31:17,958
Edward: WELL, I'M GLAD
WE DID THIS, CHARLIE.

835
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,993
YOU'RE GONNA FIT RIGHT IN
OVER AT WALCOTT COOKIES.

836
00:31:19,995 --> 00:31:21,461
WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

837
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,563
Charlie: THANK YOU,
MR. WALCOTT.

838
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:23,764
Victoria: CONGRATULATIONS.

839
00:31:23,766 --> 00:31:24,731
Charlie: THANK YOU.

840
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:25,732
Edward: GOOD NIGHT.

841
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:28,168
Victoria: BYE-BYE.

842
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,153
Edward: HEY,
SEE YOU AT WORK.

843
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,040
Charlie: YEAH,
SEE YOU AT WORK.

844
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:38,278
OH, WAIT.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?

845
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,713
NO, NO, NO.
GO TO THE CAR.

846
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:42,482
GO TO THE CAR
AND GO HOME.

847
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,287
GREAT. OK.
YES, GOOD.

848
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:52,476
YES. WELL, THAT'S IT.

849
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,860
Buck: THAT'S IT?

850
00:31:53,862 --> 00:31:54,895
Charlie: YEAH,
PIECE OF CAKE.

851
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,380
Nicole: CAN WE DISCUSS
MY PAY NOW?

852
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,398
Charlie: UH, LATER.

853
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,266
Buck: UH, LET ME
HELP YOU CLEAN UP.

854
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:02,002
Charlie: OH,
IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

855
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,404
Buck: IT WAS OUR BARBECUE.
I INSIST.

856
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,974
Charlie: FINE. COME ON.

857
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:09,409
Nicole: WE COULD'VE
JUST USED THE DISHWASHER.

858
00:32:09,411 --> 00:32:11,378
Buck: DISHWASHERS
ARE FOR SISSIES.

859
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,582
Charlie: THANKS, BUCK.

860
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:17,584
NOT MANY MEN WHO WOULD
VOLUNTEER TO DO HOUSEWORK...

861
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:18,986
Buck: MAYBE YOU JUST HAVEN'T
MET THE RIGHT MAN.

862
00:32:18,988 --> 00:32:21,154
BESIDES, I DIDN'T
DO IT ALONE.

863
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:24,141
BIG NICK'S GOT MY BACK.

864
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,843
Charlie: OK. WELL,
UM, HERE YOU GO.

865
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:28,962
THANKS. KEEP IN TOUCH.
GOOD LUCK.

866
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:31,765
OH, UH, BREAK A LEG, RIGHT?

867
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,199
Buck: YEAH.

868
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,018
HEY, CAN I GET A RIDE?

869
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,037
Charlie: OH, SURE.
I'LL CALL YOU A CAB.

870
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,207
Buck: THAT'S GOTTA BE, LIKE,
A $50 CAB RIDE.

871
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:41,441
Charlie: HOW'D YOU GET HERE?

872
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:43,443
Buck: WELL,
I HAD GOLD DRIVE ME.

873
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:44,611
I FIGURED IT WAS
THE LEAST HE COULD DO.

874
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,347
Charlie: OK.
I'LL JUST GET MY KEYS.

875
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:50,417
NICOLE, WE'RE GIVING YOUR
FATHER HERE A RIDE HOME.

876
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:51,785
Nicole: I CAN'T.

877
00:32:51,787 --> 00:32:53,920
ERIKA'S COMING OVER,
AND WE'RE DOING OUR
HOMEWORK TOGETHER.

878
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:55,739
Charlie: OK.
THIS'LL BE FINE.

879
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,824
I'LL JUST CALL ERIKA'S MOM,

880
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:00,560
AND, UH,
THIS'LL TAKE A MINUTE.

881
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,564
Nicole: BUT WE STILL
HAVE TO DISCUSS MY PAY, MOM.

882
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:06,933
Buck: I THINK YOU SHOULD
HOLD OUT FOR THE BIG MONEY.

883
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:08,435
Nicole: GOOD IDEA.

884
00:33:08,437 --> 00:33:11,672
Charlie: I APPRECIATE
YOU WATCHING THE GIRLS,
MRS. NELSON.

885
00:33:11,674 --> 00:33:12,806
I WON'T BE LONG.

886
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:15,242
Mrs. Nelson:
NO PROBLEM.

887
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:19,112
Buck: SO, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
AN EX OR GAY FRIEND

888
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:21,114
WHO COULD PLAY
YOUR HUSBAND
FOR THE NIGHT?

889
00:33:21,116 --> 00:33:24,451
Charlie: WOW! YOU DON'T HOLD
ANYTHING BACK, DO YOU?

890
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:25,452
[CHUCKLES]

891
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:26,586
Buck: HEH. SORRY.

892
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,990
MY MOUTH TENDS TO MOVE
FASTER THAN MY BRAIN.

893
00:33:29,992 --> 00:33:31,958
Charlie: OH.
LATELY MY JUDGMENT

894
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,694
HAS CEASED TO WORK
ALTOGETHER, SO...

895
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,029
Buck: I KNOW--I MEAN,
I DON'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I HEARD

896
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:39,766
OF SOMEONE PRETENDING TO
HAVE A FAMILY TO GET A JOB.

897
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,835
SERIOUSLY...

898
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:43,603
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL...

899
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,038
SMART...

900
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,506
PROBABLY HARD-WORKING.

901
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,608
THE GUYS SHOULD BE
KNOCKING DOWN YOUR DOOR.

902
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,245
BUT YOU'RE, UH, PROBABLY
TOO BUSY FOR DATING.

903
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,548
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

904
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,482
Charlie: REALLY?

905
00:33:55,484 --> 00:33:57,050
Buck: YES.

906
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:59,619
JUST BECAUSE I'M AN ACTOR
DOESN'T MEAN I'M LAZY.

907
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,121
THIS IS A CAREER FOR ME.

908
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,890
I DO COMMERCIALS,
THEATER...

909
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:08,361
SOMETIMES I'M A COWBOY
AT KIDS' PARTIES.

910
00:34:08,363 --> 00:34:10,897
I DON'T KNOW. BEFORE YOU
KNOW IT, THE YEAR'S FLOWN BY.

911
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:13,800
Charlie: YEAH. WITH
ALL THE LATE NIGHTS

912
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,170
AND THE WEEKENDS
I PUT IN AT WORK,
I--SERIOUSLY,

913
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:20,140
WITHOUT MY ORGANIZER,
SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT MONTH IT IS.

914
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,759
Buck: HEH. SEE, WE
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

915
00:34:25,213 --> 00:34:26,630
Charlie: DO YOU WANT
A RIDE OR NOT?

916
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,647
Buck: SURE.
Charlie: GET IN.

917
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,015
Buck: ALL RIGHT.

918
00:34:49,738 --> 00:34:52,105
WELL...THAT'S IT.

919
00:34:52,107 --> 00:34:56,276
YOU KNOW, I WAS REALLY
HOPING THE MARRIAGE
WOULD WORK OUT.

920
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:58,528
Charlie: THANKS, BUCK.

921
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,614
Buck: I WASN'T PERFECT,
WAS I?

922
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:02,949
Charlie: NO. BUT YOU
HAD YOUR MOMENTS.

923
00:35:02,951 --> 00:35:05,185
Buck: AND YOU, YOURS.

924
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,754
GOOD NIGHT THEN.

925
00:35:07,756 --> 00:35:09,222
Charlie: GOOD NIGHT.

926
00:35:15,497 --> 00:35:19,032
Buck: YOU KNOW, IF YOU EVER
NEED A SPOUSE FOR A BAR MITZVAH

927
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,867
OR A WEDDING
OR ANYTHING REALLY,

928
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,035
LET ME KNOW.

929
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:24,137
Charlie: I'LL REMEMBER THAT.

930
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,158
Buck: OR...

931
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,144
W-WE COULD JUST GO OUT
TO DINNER OR SOMETHING.

932
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:34,514
Charlie: OH. LIKE A DATE?

933
00:35:34,516 --> 00:35:37,284
Buck: WE COULD JUST CALL IT
DINNER AND CONVERSATION.

934
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:38,919
Charlie: HMM...

935
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,453
PROBABLY NOT.

936
00:35:40,455 --> 00:35:44,024
IT SEEMS A LITTLE
TOO WEIRD, YOU KNOW?

937
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,492
Buck: YEAH.

938
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,063
ALL RIGHT.

939
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:55,602
IN THAT CASE, THUS ENDS
MY SINGLE ONE-NIGHT
PERFORMANCE

940
00:35:55,604 --> 00:35:57,137
AS YOUR HUSBAND.

941
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:01,241
GOOD NIGHT, SWEET LADY.

942
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:06,479
AH.

943
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:08,481
HOW YOU DOING TODAY?

944
00:36:21,864 --> 00:36:23,046
Charlie: MORNING.

945
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,464
Man: GOOD MORNING.
Woman: MORNING.

946
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:26,967
Charlie: GOOD MORNING,
MR. SQUIRREL.

947
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:28,018
Mr. Squirrel: HI, CHARLIE.

948
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,670
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

949
00:36:41,216 --> 00:36:42,983
Peter: MRS. McKENZIE,
GOOD MORNING.

950
00:36:42,985 --> 00:36:45,952
Charlie: IT IS. IT IS
A BEAUTIFUL MORNING, PETER.

951
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,287
DO YOU HEAR THE BIRDS
SINGING OUT THERE?

952
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,788
Peter: UH,
IN THE RECEPTION AREA?

953
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,756
Charlie: IN THE SKY, PETER.

954
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,024
Peter: OH, NO, I DIDN'T.

955
00:36:51,026 --> 00:36:51,658
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GO LISTEN?

956
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,526
Charlie: NO. COME IN.

957
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,931
Peter: I APPRECIATE
THAT YOU REQUESTED ME

958
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,699
FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT,
MRS. McKENZIE.

959
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,903
Charlie: NOW FIRST OFF,
NO MORE MRS. McKENZIE.
CALL ME CHARLIE.

960
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:03,870
Peter: OK, CHARLIE.

961
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,405
Charlie: ANY CALLS?

962
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:07,641
Peter: MR. WALCOTT. HE SAID
HE'S GONNA STOP BY AT 8:30.

963
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,309
Charlie: OH. GREAT.

964
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,577
HOW DO I LOOK?

965
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,779
Peter: YOU LOOK,
UH, BEAUTIFUL.

966
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:15,148
Charlie: OH. STOP IT.
YOU GOT THE JOB.

967
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,250
Peter: MR. WALCOTT
ALWAYS SAYS,

968
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:19,085
"THE TRUTH MAY NOT
ALWAYS BE POPULAR,

969
00:37:19,087 --> 00:37:20,820
BUT IT'S ALWAYS THE TRUTH."

970
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,322
Charlie: HMPH.

971
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,141
Peter: UH, I'M GONNA GO
FOR SOME COFFEE.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

972
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,128
Charlie: YES. PLEASE.
ONE SUGAR, DASH OF MILK.

973
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,302
HMPH, I DOUBT
IF YOU SAW THIS.

974
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:36,770
Edward: IS EVERYTHING
SPELLED CORRECTLY?

975
00:37:36,772 --> 00:37:37,871
Charlie: OH. PERFECT.

976
00:37:37,873 --> 00:37:40,006
Edward: GOOD. I WANT
EVERYTHING PERFECT.

977
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,359
WE STARTED TEST MARKETING
YOUR IDEAS FOR THE BRANCH
MARKET, CHARLIE.

978
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,262
NUMBERS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF.
I'M VERY IMPRESSED.

979
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:46,730
Charlie: OH, THANK YOU.

980
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:49,449
UH, I HAVE SOME IDEAS
THAT I'D LOVE TO RUN
BY YOU.

981
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:50,483
Edward: WELL, WE'LL HAVE
A LOT OF TIME FOR THAT.

982
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,085
WE'RE GONNA BE SEEING
A LOT OF EACH OTHER.

983
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,870
Charlie: WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR TAKING THE INTEREST

984
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,089
IN WORKING CLOSELY WITH ME.

985
00:37:56,091 --> 00:37:58,825
Edward: OH, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEAN, CHARLIE.
WE'RE GONNA BE NEIGHBORS.

986
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:00,794
Charlie: OH.
ARE YOU MOVING OFFICES?

987
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:03,263
Edward: I'M GONNA RENT
THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR TO YOURS.

988
00:38:03,265 --> 00:38:06,967
Charlie: THE HOUSE--
THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR
TO ME. HUH.

989
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,752
Edward: ISN'T THAT--
ISN'T THAT GREAT? YEAH.

990
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:10,704
VICTORIA AND I,
WE BOUGHT A HOUSE
OUT IN MALIBU

991
00:38:10,706 --> 00:38:12,472
WHEN WE RELOCATED
OUT HERE

992
00:38:12,474 --> 00:38:14,173
AND WE'RE HAVING IT
REMODELED TOP TO BOTTOM.
IT'S A MESS.

993
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:17,193
SO WE'VE BEEN STAYING
OUT IN THIS HOTEL.
VICTORIA JUST HATES IT.

994
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,562
THEN WE SAW YOUR PLACE
ON A GOLF COURSE

995
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,781
AND MET FRANK
AND THEN THE HOUSE
NEXT DOOR'S FOR LEASE

996
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:25,235
AND WE THOUGHT,
PFF, WHY NOT?
WHAT LUCK, RIGHT?

997
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:27,237
Charlie: OH, BOY.

998
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,989
Edward: I MEAN THE HOUSE
IS NOT OUR DREAM HOUSE,
BUT IT'LL DO IN A PINCH,

999
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:31,458
AND IT'S ON A ROBERT TRENT
JONES
COURSE. MMPH!

1000
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,209
Charlie: RIGHT.
TOUGH COURSE.

1001
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:35,462
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GONNA LIKE IT.

1002
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:39,032
THERE'S A LOT
OF SAND AND JUST
WATER EVERYWHERE.

1003
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:41,634
Edward: YEAH, YEAH.
IT HASN'T HURT
FRANK'S GAME, RIGHT?

1004
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:42,919
Charlie: OH, WELL,
ABOUT THAT, MR. WALCOTT--

1005
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,587
Peter: ONE SUGAR AND A DASH
OF--

1006
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:46,006
GOOD MORNING, MR. WALCOTT.

1007
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:49,009
Edward: YEAH.
AND A GOOD MORNING
IT IS, PETE.

1008
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:52,729
Charlie: THANKS.

1009
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:54,230
Peter: GOOD NEWS?

1010
00:38:55,317 --> 00:38:57,851
Charlie: SURE. S-SURE.

1011
00:38:58,437 --> 00:39:00,103
OH...

1012
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:06,659
Stacy: NO.
HE'S MOVING IN
NEXT DOOR TO ME.

1013
00:39:06,661 --> 00:39:07,894
Charlie: I HAVE TO MOVE IN.

1014
00:39:07,896 --> 00:39:09,729
Stacy: INTO MY HOUSE,
WITH ME?

1015
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,548
Charlie: NO. YOU'LL MOVE IN
TO MY PLACE.

1016
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,999
Stacy: I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN STAY THERE.

1017
00:39:13,001 --> 00:39:15,035
I'M USED TO
LIVING IN A HOUSE,
NOT AN APARTMENT.

1018
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:17,237
I HAVE A BACK YARD,
A FRONT YARD,
AND THERE'S STAIRS.

1019
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,671
Charlie: OH, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

1020
00:39:18,673 --> 00:39:20,173
Stacy: MOVE TO THE SUBURB.
IT'S GREAT.

1021
00:39:20,175 --> 00:39:21,274
Charlie: ABOUT WALCOTT.

1022
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:24,010
Stacy: OH. OH, I KNOW.
TELL HIM THE HOUSE

1023
00:39:24,012 --> 00:39:26,112
IS BUILT ON AN
ANCIENT BURIAL SITE.

1024
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,947
TELL HIM THERE'S
RADON IN THE SOIL.

1025
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,949
Charlie: I DO LIKE
THE RADON IDEA.

1026
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,018
I MEAN IF HE THINKS
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE HOUSE,

1027
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,154
HE CAN'T MOVE IN, RIGHT?
Stacy: RIGHT! YEAH!

1028
00:39:34,156 --> 00:39:37,590
YEAH, LIKE
IT WAS HAUNTED OR...
OH, WAS ROACH-INFESTED.

1029
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,325
I KNOW A GUY
WHO DOES ROACHES.

1030
00:39:39,327 --> 00:39:40,693
YOU KNOW A GUY
WHO DOES ROACHES?

1031
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:42,695
YEAH. I MET HIM
ON AN INTERNET
PERSONAL SITE.

1032
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:44,531
HE'S A BUG WRANGLER
FOR THE MOVIES.

1033
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,033
HE GETS THESE BIG
AFRICAN HISSING SUCKERS
BY THE BUCKETFUL.

1034
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:48,601
I'LL CALL HIM.
I'LL GET A QUOTE.

1035
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:50,804
BESIDES HE OWES ME.
WE HAD AN AWFUL DATE.

1036
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,705
Charlie: BUT I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DATING YOUR HUSBAND.

1037
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:54,874
Stacy: HONEY, I'M JUST--
NEED TO KEEP MY OPTIONS OPEN

1038
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:56,709
IN CASE TROY KEEPS
ACTING LIKE A JERK.

1039
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,144
Charlie: A BUG GUY?

1040
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,879
Stacy: BECAUSE HE MADE THEM
SOUND SO INTERESTING.

1041
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:01,381
Charlie: OH...
Stacy: DROP IT.

1042
00:40:01,383 --> 00:40:02,482
WE NEED TO FOCUS, RIGHT?

1043
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:04,884
WE NEED TO GET BUCK
BACK A-S-A-P.

1044
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,388
WE NEED HIM NOW.

1045
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,956
Gold: SORRY.
HE'S NOT AVAILABLE.

1046
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,591
Charlie: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NOT AVAILABLE?

1047
00:40:11,593 --> 00:40:13,493
Gold: HE'S DOING DINNER
THEATER IN FRESNO.

1048
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,395
Stacy: FRESNO? THAT'S
OVER 2 HOURS AWAY!

1049
00:40:15,397 --> 00:40:18,331
Charlie: OK, GOLD.
WHAT'S IT GONNA COST?

1050
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,934
Gold: I'D LOVE
TO TAKE YOUR MONEY,
BUT HE'S BOOKED.

1051
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:23,336
UH, WHAT ABOUT
JIMMY ROCKWELL?

1052
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,239
HE AND BUCK GO OUT
FOR THE SAME ROLES
ALL THE TIME.

1053
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:27,507
Charlie: IT HAS TO BE BUCK.

1054
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,042
Gold: WHAT ABOUT
CORBIN GRAVES?

1055
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:31,744
YOU JUST COMB HIS HAIR
OVER THE TOP OF HIS HEAD,

1056
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:34,781
AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE.

1057
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,127
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO REACH HIM.

1058
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,568
IT'S COMING BACK TO ME.

1059
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:01,574
MAYBE I COULD GET HIM HERE
IN MAYBE END OF NEXT WEEK?

1060
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:15,121
I'VE GOT HIS NUMBER SOMEWHERE.
I'LL CALL HIM.

1061
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:18,491
YOU'LL BE IN WEDDED BLISS
IN NO TIME.

1062
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:23,363
Charlie: WHAT IF BUCK
DOESN'T SHOW UP?

1063
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:25,548
Stacy: OH, YOU'LL TELL
WALCOTT THAT HE'S IN REHAB.

1064
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,368
THAT'S IT.
WE'LL SAY THAT HE'S, UM,
HOOKED ON PAINT FUMES.

1065
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,402
Charlie: EHH.

1066
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,320
Nicole: NICE TOUCH.

1067
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,771
Stacy: THANK YOU.

1068
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:32,772
Charlie: WE ARE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE PICTURE

1069
00:41:32,774 --> 00:41:34,841
OF THE PERFECT FAMILY.

1070
00:41:34,843 --> 00:41:36,910
Stacy: WELL, SAY THAT
YOU'RE MOVING TO A BETTER
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

1071
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:39,145
Nicole: SO IF WE'RE GONNA
GO ON WITH THIS ACT,

1072
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:42,048
I REALLY THINK I
SHOULD BE GETTING PAID
FOR MY PERFORMANCE.

1073
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,234
Stacy: NICOLE, YOU
ARE DOING IT FOR CHARLIE.

1074
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,685
Nicole: BUCK'S GETTING PAID.

1075
00:41:45,687 --> 00:41:47,554
Charlie:

1076
00:41:47,556 --> 00:41:49,989
Nicole: I CAN CRY ON CUE.
YOU WANNA SEE ME?

1077
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:52,325

00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,396

1079
00:41:56,398 --> 00:41:58,231
BUT YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME
ALONE HERE WITH HER.

1080
00:41:58,233 --> 00:41:59,933
Stacy: CHARLIE,
SHE'S NOT AN ATTACK DOG.

1081
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,434
BESIDES, IT'LL BE
GOOD FOR YOU.

1082
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:04,037
Charlie: WHOA, W-WAIT,
I...I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO FEED HER.

1083
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,371
WHAT IF SHE GETS SICK?

1084
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:06,672
Stacy: BYE-BYE.

1085
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:09,976
NOW, SWEETIE,

00:42:14,382 --> 00:42:16,032

00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,500

1106
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:23,483
Edward: AH, YES IT IS.
I WAS LUCKY TO GET A TEE TIME.

1107
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,651
YOU KNOW, I JUST
CAME OVER TO SEE IF
FRANK WANTED TO JOIN ME.

1108
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,520
Charlie: OH. YEAH.
HE DOESN'T DRINK TEA.

1109
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,788
BUT THANKS
FOR THINKING OF HIM.

1110
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,256
Edward: NO, NO.

1111
00:43:30,258 --> 00:43:31,791

1112
00:43:31,793 --> 00:43:34,494
UH, YEAH. I GOT A ROUND WITH
BILL OWENS OVER AT FOOD BARN.

1113
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:36,396
IT'D BE A GREAT TIME
FOR FRANK AND I
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

1114
00:43:36,398 --> 00:43:37,664
TO BOND A LITTLE BIT,
YOU KNOW.

1115
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:40,633
Charlie: OH, HE WOULD
LOVE TO, BUT HE CAN'T.

1116
00:43:40,635 --> 00:43:45,638
HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS,
AND I DON'T EXPECT HIM BACK
UNTIL MUCH LATER TODAY.

1117
00:43:48,743 --> 00:43:50,176
Edward: OH.

1128
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,534

Charlie: OH. OH, WAIT.

1134
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:23,910
DIDN'T YOU WANT

1135
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:25,378
IT'S SATURDAY.

YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1143
00:44:44,733 --> 00:44:46,299
Charlie: I'LL COME, TOO.

1144
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:47,967
Edward: WH--I THOUGHT

1145
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:51,170
Charlie: RIGHT. BUT I LOVE

Buck: HUH.

1162
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,088
Charlie: BUCK, HAVE YOU
EVER PLAYED GOLF BEFORE?

1163
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,173
Buck: OF COURSE NOT.
WHO HAS TIME FOR GOLF?

1164
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:29,075
Charlie: YOU JUST AGREED
TO PLAY GOLF.

1165
00:45:29,077 --> 00:45:30,610
Buck: HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

1166
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:33,112
Charlie: OH...

1167
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:55,168
Buck: FORE!

1168
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,937
Owens: OH, TOO BAD THEY
PLANTED THAT TREE THERE.

1169
00:45:57,939 --> 00:46:00,139
AT LEAST THAT ONE
WENT MORE THAN 50 FEET.

1170
00:46:00,141 --> 00:46:03,242
Buck: YEAH. THE CLUB.

1171
00:46:03,244 --> 00:46:05,978
I HAD THIS WHOLE
METAL PART SHORTENED.

1172
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,548
THE SHOP SAID
IT WOULD HELP.

1173
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:11,951
YOU MAY GO, SURE.

1174
00:46:16,758 --> 00:46:20,626
Edward: OH! THAT'S
A GREAT SHOT, BILL. YEAH.

1175
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,617
VERY SHREWD FRANK,
LETTING OWENS BEAT HIM.

1176
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,101
Charlie:
LETTING OWENS BEAT HIM?

1177
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:30,536
YEAH. OH. OH, RIGHT.

1178
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,338
LETTING OWENS BEAT HIM.

1179
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,373
Buck: LET'S GO
GET OUR GOLF ON.

1180
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,477
Edward: OK. WE'LL CATCH
YOU GUYS DOWN THERE.

1181
00:46:37,479 --> 00:46:38,678
Buck: ALL RIGHT.

1182
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,979
Owens: YOU SURE
THIS IS YOUR GAME?

1183
00:46:39,981 --> 00:46:42,081
Buck: YEAH. JUST GET
MY RHYTHM GOING.

1184
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:44,584
Charlie: S-SO, YOU LIKED
WHEN HE HIT THOSE 5 BALLS
INTO THE LAKE?

1185
00:46:44,586 --> 00:46:45,818
Edward: GOD,
THAT'S VERY CLEVER.

1186
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:47,453
I BROUGHT MY GAME
DOWN A NOTCH OR 2,

1187
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:49,589
BUT FRANK
REALLY OUTDID HIMSELF.

1188
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:52,358
Charlie: [LAUGHS]
THAT'S MY FRANKIE.

1189
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:20,186
Stacy: CHARLIE?

1190
00:47:21,322 --> 00:47:22,655
BUCK?

1191
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:37,136
Troy: WHOA! WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA.

1192
00:47:37,138 --> 00:47:39,872
Stacy: TROY.
YOU STARTLED ME.

1193
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:40,873
WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

1194
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:43,009
Troy: IN THE SHOP.
I'M DRIVING A LOANER.

1195
00:47:43,011 --> 00:47:44,410
WHO'S BUCK?

1196
00:47:44,412 --> 00:47:45,511
Stacy:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1197
00:47:45,513 --> 00:47:46,746
Troy: LOOKING FOR MY GOLF
CLUBS.

1198
00:47:46,748 --> 00:47:47,880
I WAS GONNA PLAY
A ROUND TODAY.

1199
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:49,181
WHO'S BUCK?

1200
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:50,950
Stacy: YOUR CLUBS
ARE IN THE CORNER
WITH YOUR SHOES.

1201
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,885
OR THEY WERE YESTERDAY.
SOMEONE MUST'VE
BORROWED THEM.

1202
00:47:52,887 --> 00:47:54,387
Troy: LIKE WHO?
Stacy: CHARLIE.

1203
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:56,322
OR BUCK.
I DON'T KNOW.

1204
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:57,590
Troy: WHO IS BUCK?

1205
00:47:57,592 --> 00:47:59,058
Stacy: YOU KEEP
ASKING ME THAT.

1206
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,359
Troy: AND THE ANSWER IS...?

1207
00:48:00,361 --> 00:48:02,812
Stacy: A FRIEND OF CHARLIE'S...
AND MINE.

1208
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,897
Troy: I GUESS I'M NOT
PLAYING GOLF TODAY.

1209
00:48:04,899 --> 00:48:07,934
SO, WHERE'S NICOLE?
MAYBE SHE WANTS TO
GO SEE A MOVIE.

1210
00:48:07,936 --> 00:48:10,703
Stacy: IT'S SATURDAY.
YOU KNOW SHE SPENDS THE DAY
WITH HER FRIENDS.

1211
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:16,359
Troy: OH...SO...WE'RE HERE
ALL ALONE.

1212
00:48:17,445 --> 00:48:18,694
Stacy: DON'T GET ANY IDEAS.

1213
00:48:18,696 --> 00:48:20,363
Troy: HONEY, WE'RE MARRIED.

1214
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,065
Stacy: DOESN'T MEAN
I'M EASY.

1215
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,568
Troy: ONE LITTLE KISS.

1216
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,208
Owens: WELL, GOOD SHOT, ED,
BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1217
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,710
Edward: YEAH. I'M
A LITTLE OFF MY GAME TODAY.

1218
00:48:50,712 --> 00:48:51,711
Owens: YEAH.

1219
00:48:51,713 --> 00:48:53,713
Buck: WHAT'S MY SCORE,
BUTTERCUP?

1220
00:48:53,715 --> 00:48:55,648
Charlie: 116.

1221
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:03,255
Buck: [CHUCKLES]
CAN THEY STILL CATCH UP?

1222
00:49:03,257 --> 00:49:06,058
Owens: SURE. ALL YOU NEED
TO DO IS SINK THAT ONE

1223
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,895
AND THEN HOPE THAT IT
TAKES ME 34 STROKES
TO PUTT THIS OUT.

1224
00:49:09,897 --> 00:49:12,598
Buck: HEY, DON'T LAUGH.
IT'S A TRICKY GREEN.

1225
00:49:21,309 --> 00:49:22,675
YEAH!

1226
00:49:24,078 --> 00:49:25,911
HEAT'S UP NOW, HUH?

1227
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:35,888
Edward: OH...

1228
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,674
Buck: NOT SO CONFIDENT
NOW, ARE WE?

1229
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:51,804
Owens: GOOD GAME.

1230
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:52,705
Buck: WE'LL HAVE
TO GET A REMATCH.

1231
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:54,507
Owens: ANYTIME, FRANK.

1232
00:49:58,346 --> 00:49:59,945
Edward: THAT'S THE WAY.

1233
00:50:00,815 --> 00:50:04,784
NICE ROUND.
THAT WAS A CLINIC.

1234
00:50:04,786 --> 00:50:05,885
Charlie: REMATCH?

1235
00:50:05,887 --> 00:50:07,887
Buck: WHAT? I WAS JUST
GOING ALONG WITH--

1236
00:50:07,889 --> 00:50:10,189
AH...OW.

1237
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:17,129
P.A.: 3-4's UP,
UP ON TEE ONE.

1238
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:22,068
Edward: HAVE TO ADMIT,
FRANK'S QUITE A BIT BETTER

1239
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,069
THAN THAT BETSON FELLA.

1240
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:24,503
Owens: YEAH, WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO HIM?

1241
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:25,838
Edward: OH, BETSON,
WELL, I HAD TO LET HIM GO.

1242
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,773
HE FUDGED HIS QUARTERLY
REPORTS,

1243
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,108
TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF
LOOK BETTER.

1244
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,178
WALCOTT FAMILY DEMANDS
HONESTY AND INTEGRITY.

1245
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,546
YOU CAN'T MAKE COMPROMISES
ON THAT.

1246
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:36,549
Owens: NO, YOU CANNOT
COMPROMISE ON HONESTY
AND INTEGRITY.

1247
00:50:36,551 --> 00:50:39,652
UH, THANK YOU FOR A VERY
GOOD GAME, GENTLEMEN...

1248
00:50:39,654 --> 00:50:41,203
AND, UH, OH, HEY, CHARLIE...

1249
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,489
I'M LOOKIN' FORWARD
TO WORKIN' WITH YOU.

1250
00:50:43,491 --> 00:50:45,124
Charlie: THANK YOU.

1251
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,565
Edward: CHARLIE, I'VE GOT
A GOOD FEELING ABOUT YOU,

1252
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:54,133
AND I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA SEEM SUDDEN,

1253
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:57,069
BUT I WANT YOU TO HEAR ME
OUT BEFORE YOU SAY NO, OK?

1254
00:50:57,071 --> 00:50:58,671
I'D LIKE TO MOVE YOU

1255
00:50:58,673 --> 00:51:00,022
TO OUR EUROPEAN OFFICE.

1256
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:01,540

1257
00:51:01,542 --> 00:51:04,043
Edward: WELL, UH, CHARLIE,
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD WHY.

1258
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:06,545
Charlie: PLEASE, I TRUST
YOUR JUDGEMENT.

1259
00:51:06,547 --> 00:51:08,347
Edward: WELL, I'D LIKE YOU
THERE TO OVERSEE THINGS.

1260
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:09,281

OUR ENTIRE
EUROPEAN SALES FORCE

1262
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:12,551
WILL BE BASED OUT OF LONDON.

1263
00:51:12,553 --> 00:51:14,653
NOW, I KNOW THIS IS
A BIG DECISION FOR YOU
AND FRANK.

1264
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,955
Charlie: OH, FRANK'LL
LOVE IT, RIGHT, HONEY?

1265
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:18,691
Edward: OK, WELL, LOOK,
YOU TWO TALK ABOUT IT

1266
00:51:18,693 --> 00:51:20,626
THEN MEET US UP THERE
IN THE CLUB HOUSE, OK?

1267
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:24,230
Charlie: YES.

1268

[BUCK SIGHS]

1269
00:51:25,767 --> 00:51:27,867
Buck: I WAS PRETTY GOOD
TODAY, HUH?

1270
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:29,535
Charlie: YOU COULD HAVE
COST ME MY JOB.

1271
00:51:29,537 --> 00:51:31,437
Buck: COST YOU YOUR...
Charlie: YEAH.

1272
00:51:31,439 --> 00:51:32,304
Buck: YOU JUST
GOT A PROMOTION.

1273
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,372
THAT OWENS GUY LOVED ME.

1274
00:51:33,374 --> 00:51:34,807
Charlie: OH, WE GOT LUCKY.

1275
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:36,175
Buck: NO LUCK TO IT.

1276
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,778
I'M GOOD
AT PLAYING HUSBAND.

1277
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,379
NOW, IF YOU WERE
A BETTER WIFE

1278
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:41,914
AND DIDN'T HIT ME
ALL THE TIME,

1279
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:43,315
THINGS MIGHT GO
A LITTLE BIT MORE SMOOTHLY.

1280
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:45,601
Charlie: YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GUESS I'M NOT GREAT
AT PLAYING WIFE.

1281
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:46,786
Buck: WELL...

1282
00:51:46,788 --> 00:51:48,320
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU KEEP IT UP,

1283
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:51,123
WE MIGHT HAVE TO GO
INTO MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

1284
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:52,558
[CHARLIE LAUGHS]

1285
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,559

Buck: YEAH.

1287
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:59,632
Stacy: I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MOVING OUT
OF THE COUNTRY.

1288
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:01,801
Charlie: WELL, I CAN HARDLY
BELIEVE IT, MYSELF.

1289
00:52:01,803 --> 00:52:03,769
AT LEAST, I'LL BE OUT OF
WALCOTT'S SIGHT

1290
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:05,471
AND I CAN JUST DROP
THIS WHOLE CHARADE

1291
00:52:05,473 --> 00:52:07,673
AND GET BACK
TO WHAT I DO BEST: WORK.

1292
00:52:07,675 --> 00:52:09,024
Stacy: WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT NECKLACE?

1293
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,744
Charlie: OH, BUCK
GAVE IT TO ME.

1294
00:52:11,746 --> 00:52:13,262
Stacy: WOW.
THAT WAS NICE OF HIM.

1295
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:16,465
Buck: I, UH, TOOK SOME OF
YOUR THINGS OUT OF THE DRYER

1296
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,466
TO DO SOME LAUNDRY.

1297
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,984
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

1298
00:52:18,986 --> 00:52:21,287
I FOLDED SOME OF
YOUR UNMENTIONABLES.

1299
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:24,206
Charlie: GIMME THOSE.

1300

Stacy: DO, TOO! I KNOW
THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES.

1303
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,162
SHE LIKES YOU.

THE SAME THING.

00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:33,165
Charlie: OH!

00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:36,702

Buck: I CAN FIX IT,
IF YOU WANT.

1313
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,148
I JUST NEED A SET OF PLIERS
AND A PIPE WRENCH.

1314
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,417
Stacy: SURE. THERE SHOULD BE
SOME TOOLS UNDER THE SINK.

1315
00:52:54,155 --> 00:52:56,255

JUST LIKE THAT.

WADDED UP IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

ALL THOSE THINGS

BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
SHE DID IT

1914
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,691
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT
GETTING THIS JOB

1915
01:18:50,693 --> 01:18:52,426
WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING IN HER LIFE.

THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT

AND INTEGRITY.

HONESTY AND INTEGRITY

WHEN YOU'RE THE CEO,

TO SUIT YOURSELF.

Charlie: ACTUALLY BECOMING
A WIFE AND MOTHER.

THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH.
