1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,600
I just don't think I can
give you that promotion.

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,808
It's because of
my guts isn't it?

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,100
Here at Derbish and
Browns we're looking

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,200
for someone with that drive
to succeed deep down inside.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,960
Or outside is fine too so.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,940
Is there anything I can do? I'm
gushing with ideas. I have umm.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,519
Let's see how the day goes.

8
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:40,640
Final decision won't be until five o'clock
so if you'll just excuse me.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,680
Yes you're excused sorry.
Shelly, can you bring in some cleaner please?

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,893
Horace was here.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,028
Yeah, the guts guy.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,524
There he is. How'd it go?

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,000
Terrible. Because
I didn't get it.

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,580
That's bull!

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,065
Hey you guys need to be quiet, people are
trying to add and subtract numbers in here.

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,380
You know what Janet is so nice.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,160
She really is.
Yeah she's the best.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,719
Maybe she's thirsty.

19
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:22,178
Dude great point.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,780
I'll be right back. Hold
down the fort. You got this.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,240
Hey Janet I thought you might be thirsty from
all that number crunching you were doing.

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
God I'm so so so
sorry. I am so sorry here.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,080
Just kind of rub that around so you want
to form a base and then just sort of go

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,680
counterclockwise. We're
going to need some soap.

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,963
Who's got soap?!

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,667
Why can't you just be normal?

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,428
What's going on out here?

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,306
Janet spilled water.

29
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,440
So yeah I came in with that
tre, swish. Beat the buzzer man.

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,580
Won the game, best
moment of my life.

31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
Aww I was awarded best
whitler in the eighth grade.

32
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,720
Shh.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,707
What the hell is
wrong with this guy?

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,102
Do I have something on my face?

35
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:19,200
That's Horace, don't look directly
at the guts. This is Brody.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,600
Yeah he's super cool and
smells way better than you so.

37
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,860
I can smell him from here.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,360
I don't know if you know this
or not but that's disgusting.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
You look like a used band-aid.

40
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,160
You look like a prince.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,220
Why don't you just put
a shirt over that bro?

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,200
That's a great idea, which is
why I'm glad I had it, but um

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
you know the blood soaks through the
fabric and it ruins all my clothes

44
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,450
so what I had to do was cut holes
in my shirt. I cut my ties too.

45
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,669
Watch out!

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,740
Is that pee?

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
He said watch out man.

48
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,618
Yeah that's pee.

49
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:58,197
Pee pee bro.

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,840
Nobody does that to me.

51
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,480
Hey blood brothers man.

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,220
I'm sorry okay.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,747
Sorry not gonna cut it bro.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,331
I'm gonna fight you.

55
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,740
After work.

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,211
Five o'clock.

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,195
In the parking lot.

58
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,000
You're dead.

59
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
Wait hey wait I don't
know how to fight.

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,880
Wait which parking lot?

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
There's like three parking lots.

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,772
Brody which parking

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Hey

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,100
Thought you'd be
long gone by now.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
No I can't leave until
five. Have you seen him?

66
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,590
Yeah he's right over there.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,320
This is our boy Brody,
Brody this is our boy Janet.

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,850
Nice to meet you.

69
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
Janet actually likes him?

70
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,146
Maybe he's not that
strong and you can take him.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,160
I really feel like
we're crushing it.

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Well

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,853
Maybe he's forgotten about it.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
Did he just come up with
that dance move right now?

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,080
Yeah.

76
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,548

77
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,940
Got them at the state
fair when I was 12.

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,367
I'll give you 50 bucks if you
hit him hard enough to hurt him...

79
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,800

don't like kill him.

89
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,077

about upper management?

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,909

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,580

We need to get back
to number crunching.

104
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,181
No guts, no glo.

105
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,127
