1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,531
For most sets,
if there was a second story...

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,207
...it's not really a second story, it's a--
There's a staircase that goes up...

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,567
...and then you're shooting
a bit of an elevated set.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,003
They're not really on the second floor.
But we really are on the second floor.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,926
This had to be set up
so that all our equipment...

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,404
...150 people sitting in the balcony
and everything would be there.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,609
And it also had to be set up so that
we could get equipment up and down...

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,650
...and still shoot the show
in this environment.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,962
It's Friday night in Hollywood
with Harriet Hayes...

10
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,128
...Simon Stiles, Tom Jeter...

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,648
...Jeannie Whatley...

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,608
How you doing?
Tim Busfield, <i>Studio 60</i> cast member.

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,647
Welcome. Here we are at
<i>Studio 60 Live on the Sunset Strip.</i>

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,881
That's the show.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,044
This is the backstage area.
The set was designed by Carlos Barbosa.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,568
Tommy originally had a very imp--

17
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,166
Very important to Tommy and Aaron
that they had a theater...

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,481
...not necessarily a studio.

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,291
We could have shot it here
at Warner Bros. like on a sound stage...

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,249
...but we really didn't wanna do that...

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,568
...because there wasn't just
any romance to movie sets.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,006
Nothing exciting about them.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,003
So they decided
if they went into a theater...

24
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,766
...and embodied the theater
much like David Letterman might do...

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,082
...that it would give us
a bit of history and romance.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,242
I kept thinking about,
"This is a group of people...

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,602
...who get together every week
and put on a show.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,205
This is a group of people
who get together...

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,486
...every week and put on a show. "

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,847
And as I kept--
That was the mantra. I went:

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,048
"Well, isn't that a theater experience?

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,971
So why couldn't it be
that the world that we set up...

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,920
...which is somewhat fictitious,
would take place in an old theater?"

34
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,802
Like the Pantages or the Egyptian
or the Chinese...

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,487
...that made-up, you know,
1930s art deco shell.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,167
And it's just a shell that houses inside
the television studio.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,290
Hey, I gotta go. All right.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,040
Welcome back.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,283
Anyway. So come with me.
This is a...

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,444
More a backstage area.
Backstage's very important to the show.

41
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,967
You're gonna see a lot of scenes
in the backstage...

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,647
...because it's backstage
and at a <i>Saturday Night</i> Live-type show.

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,688
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,683
Danny and I are taking over the show.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,370
- You are?
- I'm your boss now...

46
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,127
...so we're gonna have to postpone
this fight for a couple of years.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,611
- Really?
- Yes.

48
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,649
No, I mean you're really
taking over the show?

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,211
Yes.

50
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,725
Or we could just end it now.
The fight.

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,564
- That'd be fine too.
- First of all...

52
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,085
...could you stop telling people
we broke up...

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,050
...because of the national anthem?
It makes me sound like an idiot.

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,090
Actually, consensus is
it makes me sound like an idiot.

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,811
As we move around the backstage...

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,486
...I'm gonna show you something
that I think is really cool.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,961
There's a lot of sets
that are gonna come in and go.

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,408
You're gonna see a lot of pieces
of the set that are gonna--

59
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,925
Like this, like this car.

60
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,801
There might be a car sketch
in the back of a cab.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,884
- Right, that's right.
- Yeah, I went through that.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,730
We're doing it.

63
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,011
Matt, you can get another director,
you can get someone good.

64
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,925
I don't want someone else,
I want you.

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,927
The joke was, "I don't want
someone good, I want you. "

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,765
I know where the joke was.

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,560
The steel here, the set,
what's really cool about this is...

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,882
...all this stuff right here,
again, showing history...

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,566
...and showing
what a real theater would have.

70
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,282
And knowing Tommy Schlamme's style,
if you've watched Tommy's work...

71
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,211
...with <i>The West Wing</i>
or <i>Sports Night...</i>

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,761
...or, you know, his work on <i>E.R.</i>
and those shows...

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,684
...where people can really move...

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,128
...you're gonna see areas where cameras
can follow, just like we did right there.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,931
We had a walk-and-talk last Friday.
We started up here...

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,886
You could pan--?

77
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,963
Tilt up here, we came
all the way around over to the band...

78
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,010
...we came down, all through here...

79
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,844
...then we ended up in these hallways.

80
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,442
It took us three hours to light.

81
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,043
Three hours. And Tommy goes,
"An hour. Why aren't we lit yet?"

82
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,244
And then it took us about five hours
to shoot the night.

83
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,970
And it was-- it's just, it's just--

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,205
it takes a lot of time,
it's just a lot of work. But it's...

85
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,569
The outcome was, it was-- I have
never done a shot like that in my life.

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,851
- Go, camera C, arm it around.
- On 2, back up.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,128
Just about, please.

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,681
Okay, got it.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,047
Let's make that a nice dissolve
tonight. That should be a push-in--

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,771
This is the-- This is the office for--

91
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,049
it was Judd Hirsch's office on the show,
but now it's gonna end up being...

92
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,409
...where Whitford and Perry hang out
for most of the show.

93
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,848
This is of course a 35 mm camera,
or maybe a 16 mm camera.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,446
It's a 16, because
Tommy likes to shoot pilots on 16...

95
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,085
...because it's good luck.
I don't know why...

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,241
...but that's what he likes to do.

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,209
Anyway, more actors
and people like that, it is the office.

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,964
We're gonna work our way
back over here.

99
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,361
I'd love to. I'm on an EPK tour
right here.

100
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,124
- This is Matthew Perry.
- Hi, how are you?

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,521
Might remember him
from <i>The Whole Ten Yards.</i>

102
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,491
Anyway. So we're--
We're moving deeper into the space.

103
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,290
This is some secretary's place...

104
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,649
...where there's gonna be sex and
all kinds of things going on in the show.

105
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,161
This is the control room,
this is where my character works.

106
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,731
Because I'm the control room
director...

107
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,450
...and this is Tommy Schlamme,
the director.

108
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,246
The guy's got more Emmys
than anybody has ever had in their life.

109
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,442
He's gonna go into the Hall of Fame,
he's got nine.

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,647
- I'm sorry, what?
- Emmys.

111
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,444
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, yeah, that's-- Sorry.

112
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,251
I guess I didn't say that clear enough,
I ran that together.

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,523
He's like, if you were to look at all
the California Angels out in the field...

114
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,523
...there's that many.
It's crazy, it's crazy.

115
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,523
Anyway, this is the control room
on the show.

116
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,170
This is where I'm gonna hang out.

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,526
What's the time
on Peripheral Vision Man?

118
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,011
-3:45.
- Tell the writers...

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,924
...they're gonna have to stretch it
25 seconds.

120
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,050
Making it longer was
the missing ingredient in making it funny.

121
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,210
- Stand by. We got a change at four-A.
- Ninety seconds live.

122
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,361
This is Brad Whitford.

123
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,683
You probably recognize Brad
from <i>Revenge of the Nerds II.</i>

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,088
That was some of his best work
right there.

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,890
- I have to go downstairs.
- Matt's not there.

126
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,122
- Where is he?
- He's being taken in a separate car.

127
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,520
- Why?
- Because the press is...

128
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,648
...about 8 minutes
behind all of us tonight.

129
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,009
I'm going over there now.

130
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,323
But not to talk to your boss, or take over
the show, or hit it out of the park.

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,131
But to tell Matt before you do,
because that's your next step.

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,884
I have no intention of telling Matt.

133
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,850
That's nice, but I have no reason
to trust you and every reason not to.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,570
- Why?
- You work in television.

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,007
And now we're back
right where the tour began.

136
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,925
This is the door I came through
at the very top.

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,481
I don't think we really looked
into this prop room over here.

138
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,166
We have props
and all kinds of, you know...

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,322
Anything we need for the sets.

140
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,848
And that takes us back now
into the theater itself.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,970
Come with me. We've done a full loop.

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,164
And if you put it all together,
I think you'll really--

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,970
And you know Tommy's work,
you'll know...

144
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,771
...that this is a lot of how
Tommy's gonna shoot the show.

145
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,402
- There's this and then she steps into it.
- Okay.

146
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,369
And it becomes, you know, her shot.

147
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,050
But I can do two simple
film cameras, you know.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,409
- We'll do what we did yesterday.
- Yeah. Right, right, right.

149
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,040
- Exactly, but I've gotta shoot the video.
- Right.

150
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,642
The four-camera video,
because I only have the squibs twice.

151
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,848
And then everything is...

152
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,849
I'm not thinking about
how do I stick out...

153
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,129
...with the large sea of television shows
that are out there.

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,443
All I can do is do the best job
that I know how to do right now...

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,769
...and try to figure out what's
the best way to shoot this show...

156
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,527
...with the material that I've read
and the actors that I have.

157
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,048
That's my job.
My job is not to reinvent the wheel.

158
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,602
The wheel's, I think,
a really structured, good wheel.

159
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,570
So I'm just figuring out
how to put it on my cart right now.

160
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,644
So I'm not thinking-- I mean,
I do think there is ways...

161
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,325
...that people are sort of feeling...

162
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,723
...that now television you've gotta catch
the eye of the viewer right away...

163
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,927
...you gotta do something.

164
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,447
Visually you've gotta tell the story
in a unique and different way...

165
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,329
...than it's ever been done.

166
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,882
<i>West Wing</i> had a visual look to it
that I think was unique.

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,601
But the visual look was completely
dictated by the way Aaron wrote.

168
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,285
Aaron still writes that way...

169
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,171
...so some of that look
will duplicate itself, you know.

170
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,243
There is no reason. it works that way.

171
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,602
I don't have to go,
"Well, I've done that already...

172
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,728
...I need to reinvent something else. "

173
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,842
I just can't be a party to the line
that's gonna be crossed...

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,923
...if we allow them their way on this.

175
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,201
I won't pay a $73 million fine.

176
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,000
I won't pay a 73 cent fine.

177
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,562
I won't time-delay the news
and I won't say I'm sorry.

178
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,524
I no longer recognize the authority
of the FCC in this matter.

179
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,371
I'm gonna have to be ordered
by a federal judge.

180
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,602
And when they come
to get my transmitter...

181
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,366
...they better send a group
a hell of a lot more scary...

182
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,761
...than the Foundation
for Friendly Families...

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,048
...or whatever the hell they are.

184
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,725
Let those guys embed themselves...

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,008
...with the Second Marine Division
for a while.

186
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,041
They'll rejigger their sense
of what's obscene in a quicker way.

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,531
Anyway, this is the stage.

188
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,331
This is where you might hear
a "Live from Studio 60--"

189
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,648
This is, you know...

190
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,882
...Felicity Huffman,
who we have actually.

191
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,441
Felicity Huffman in the pilot.

192
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,250
These sets will change all the time...

193
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,129
...I'm sure each week
these are gonna change.

194
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,489
The thing we're not gonna see which is--
Just to show you how much work--

195
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,369
This is already massive and huge...

196
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,329
...but it's only a shell
of what it's gonna be.

197
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,403
Everything you've seen here
is still gonna expand...

198
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,928
...and grow out in the vision
of what Tommy and Aaron had.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,162
I've been a fan of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
for a long time.

200
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,523
I've always thought it would be fun
to set a show behind the scenes...

201
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,251
...at a late-night
sketch comedy TV show.

202
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,687
I like going behind the scenes
of things...

203
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,490
...we don't necessarily get to see,
you know.

204
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,130
I had always said
on <i>The West Wing:</i>

205
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,808
"Let's show the 5 minutes before
and after what we get to see on CNN. "

206
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,527
And same thing here.

207
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,447
You know, we all watch <i>Saturday</i>
<i>Night Live</i> and other shows on TV.

208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,286
Let's show what we don't
ordinarily get to see.

209
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,011
And also what's nice, I think...

210
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,891
...just the way on <i>The West Wing</i>
what we were able to see...

211
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,565
...tell stories about our leaders...

212
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,166
...where they weren't
either Machiavellian or dolts.

213
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,121
They were genuinely good people,
good at their jobs, trying to do well.

214
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,729
I thought, "Is it possible that we can
show people who work in Hollywood...

215
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,360
...also as good people...

216
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,370
...who were good at their jobs,
trying to do something good?"

217
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,211
it may be a slightly harder
mountain to conquer...

218
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,089
...but we're gonna give it a shot.

219
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,241
It is about hard work...

220
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,850
...it's not about the fun and games
of doing-- Living in Hollywood...

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,651
...and a sort of romantic nature
of what our lives are like.

222
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,565
These are people who get up
really early and work really late.

223
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,404
And usually don't go to bed.
They're gonna live in this environment...

224
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,601
...which is our show.

225
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,286
It was a very interesting...

226
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,010
...question for me,
because I certainly...

227
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,645
...before I read it, was not looking
to do another one-hour drama.

228
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,327
I certainly was not looking, you know,
necessarily to do it with the two guys...

229
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,201
...who I had done
<i>The West Wing</i> with.

230
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,966
But it became very clear
after reading it...

231
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,281
...that this is the best material...

232
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,603
...and I realized
that I didn't act all my life...

233
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,001
...so that I could stop acting.

234
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,764
What's great about this is
it's a drama...

235
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,771
...so you can play real stuff,
but it takes place in this kind of--

236
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,969
In this funny world that people
don't normally get to see, you know.

237
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,248
So in <i>West Wing</i> people were funny...

238
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,449
...but, you know, their job was
kind of running the country.

239
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,362
And here it's very serious people
who take very seriously being funny.

240
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,444
I'm writing more personally
than I have before.

241
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,682
You know, I have no relationship
to the White House...

242
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,121
...or to ESPN or anything like that.

243
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,250
In this show, writing about people
who work in television...

244
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,883
...and living a life where
there are public complications...

245
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,362
...and weekly pressure to succeed...

246
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,445
...where failure, when it happens,
happens on such a massive stage.

247
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,291
Those things are a little closer to me...

248
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,523
...so it's both fun and frightening
at the same time.

249
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,286
My manager called and said,
"There's a new script by Aaron Sorkin. "

250
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,041
And because I love him so much
I said, "Send it over. "

251
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,886
A lot of us don't get this kind of material
and of course I read it...

252
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,651
...fell in love with it,
asked my fiancé to read it.

253
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,451
He's a screenwriter
and he came in to the--

254
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,211
I told Aaron and Tommy this,
he came in to the bedroom...

255
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,522
...and he just looked like
he'd been shot.

256
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,808
And he said, "This is one of
the best scripts I've ever read...

257
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,849
...movie or TV or anything. "

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,607
I think that Aaron and Tommy,
our director and writer-producer...

259
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,651
I think very few people in television
would you classify as geniuses.

260
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,441
If you're a really good television writer,
chances are you don't stay that long.

261
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,523
But these cats are really--
They're geniuses.

262
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,963
And I'm just-- I'm--
I'm having the time of my life.

263
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,640
I mean, 16-17 hour days is like:

264
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,849
"Oh, damn, I should have got a job
at the post office. What is this?"

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,367
Look, I didn't wanna write
your damned mongongo fruit sketch.

266
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,000
I'd pay more attention
to your general tone of voice with me.

267
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
You're right.

268
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,562
I apologize.

269
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,171
It's just I'm saying, I don't--

270
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,322
You don't wanna work
on my sketch, fine.

271
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,562
But you don't wanna work on it
because it's black...

272
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,087
...that makes you the pool boy
at the little house of Uncle Thomas.

273
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,891
We're not doing a documentary
of what happens at <i>SNL.</i>

274
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,405
Certainly we're--

275
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,531
it's been inspired a lot
by behind-the-scenes accounts...

276
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,561
...of the early days of <i>SNL,</i>
of the current days of <i>SNL.</i>

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,810
That-- You know,
what you're seeing are people...

278
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,089
...Sunday through Friday.
They don't sleep a lot...

279
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,369
...they don't leave the building a lot,
they've got 90 minutes of television...

280
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,330
...to write, rehearse,
produce and execute.

281
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,850
And they want every show
to be as good as their best show.

282
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,525
The thing that's cool about it is...

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,731
...there's an infinite number
of possibilities of where you can go...

284
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,325
...where you can go with the show...

285
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,403
...and things that you can do
with all the characters.

286
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,961
There are so many things happening
not only as the show...

287
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,246
...but in the show within the show.

288
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,084
The show within the show
is fascinating.

289
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,925
It's going to take viewers
into the next dimension of television.

290
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,924
It's not just what you see
on your TV screen.

291
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,005
It's on a TV screen on your TV screen.

292
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,650
It's very complicated.

293
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,201
We're so behind the scenes
we don't know what's real anymore.

294
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,443
I think I'm behind the scenes
by just being here.

295
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,490
Because I'm--
I'm sort of like borrowed, right?

296
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,361
And I'm borrowed to play a guy
who's gonna be fired anyway, right?

297
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,284
So it's like--

298
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,127
You gotta play how to disappear.

299
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,250
In my life, I don't like the idea
of disappearing in anything.

300
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,606
Especially if I'm on something.

301
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,845
They'll deal with the opening 60 seconds
for the West Coast delay.

302
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,246
- Wesley?
- Yeah.

303
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,165
- You're fired.
- No kidding.

304
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,525
Escort him off the property.

305
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,684
He doesn't talk to any press
while he's on this property.

306
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,608
I remember with <i>Sports Night</i>
people asking:

307
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,128
"I don't understand,
is this a drama or a comedy?"

308
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,331
The fact of the matter is
I don't do either one well enough...

309
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,642
...to only do one of them...

310
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,847
...so I have to do both.

311
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,685
I don't think
you could type Aaron.

312
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,929
He uses comedy to get
to the dramatic moments...

313
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,003
...and he uses drama to get
to the comedy moments.

314
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,960
Like any great writer, he's just
not writing joke, setup, joke, setup.

315
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,248
So it's impossible to tell
where Aaron's gonna go.

316
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,767
It's what comes to him
and what comes through him.

317
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,127
He pays such close attention
to character...

318
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,322
...and it's all about the relationships,
which is...

319
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,163
...I think, ideal for actors
and audiences and yeah, so it's-- it's--

320
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,009
it's an honor to get to say those words,
and there's a lot of them too, so...

321
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,730
So, yeah, very cool, very cool.

322
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,609
I have a theater background.

323
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,922
And in theater nobody ever asks:

324
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,801
"Is it a drama or a comedy?"
Just, "Is it a musical or a non-musical?"

325
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,962
This is a non-musical.

326
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,124
It's so crazy when playing a character
within a character within the show...

327
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,291
...and then also being
that kind of character on the outside.

328
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,169
Like I am a sketch comedy guy.

329
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,765
You know, my background
is Second City...

330
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,365
...and Groundlings and stuff like that.

331
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,684
So you're trying to, "Okay, act
like you're getting ready for a sketch" ...

332
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,882
...and I'm really getting ready
for a sketch...

333
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,168
...but then I'm a character doing it,
it's--

334
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,120
it's insane, it's just crazy,
but it's all good.

335
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,966
We're live in eight, seven, six...

336
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,130
...five, four...

337
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,170
My fellow Americans...

338
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,807
...I'm here to speak to you tonight
about a very serious subject.

339
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,041
My legacy.

340
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,048
"Legacy" is a 480 SAT word,
which it turns out...

341
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,441
...does not mean
"a woman with nice legs. "

342
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,250
The writers are very open as far as...

343
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,610
The first rehearsal we had
they came to us and said:

344
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,242
"You know, tell us what characters
you're comfortable with, tell us--

345
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,724
Pitch us sketches, we're always
looking for interesting sketches...

346
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,087
...crazy characters,
things you've done before.

347
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,287
Come to us, we'd love--"

348
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,761
So, it's-- I think that's rare
that writers are that open...

349
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,966
...and are, you know, open to you,
kind of bringing your own ideas...

350
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,122
...about the character
and about the words.

351
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,361
This is an ensemble show...

352
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,081
...there are a lot of characters
and moreover, it's...

353
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,641
We're very, very lucky
with the cast that we've got.

354
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,043
We had a wonderful population
of great actors to choose from.

355
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,004
And Tommy and I
feel incredibly lucky...

356
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,049
...that these guys decided
to come to our show.

357
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,641
Playing a network executive is--
I now understand...

358
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,610
...what Anthony Hopkins felt
when he played Hannibal Lecter.

359
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,082
You go very, very deep, very dark.

360
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,165
It's an ugly, ugly, ugly place to exist.

361
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,324
You got a thing for one of these guys?
Or both of these guys?

362
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,211
I don't know
either one of them personally.

363
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,284
Is that a question you were asked
when you hired me?

364
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,805
You bet your ass it was.

365
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,044
I need to get started now,
I need to get to Matt and Danny.

366
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,043
I'm gonna wanna meet with them
before any hands are shaken.

367
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,441
- They're not gonna audition for you.
- We're gonna have a conversation.

368
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,689
- What will you say in this conversation?
- Whatever I damn well please.

369
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,088
You saw how fast
I fired Wes Mendell?

370
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,765
Screw this up...

371
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,161
...I'll fire you faster.

372
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,244
I'm not like every other heterosexual
male in show business, Jordan.

373
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,811
I don't find you charming.

374
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,402
And you've earned
the loyalty of absolutely no one.

375
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,201
People fear and loathe me
and I like that feeling.

376
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,091
It's good. I'm such a doormat
in real life.

377
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,123
So you go ahead,
you take your first steps...

378
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,487
...toward making us all classy again.

379
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,971
We've been waiting for you.

380
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,368
That's your office.

381
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,891
I'm excited to work with Brad.

382
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,170
I really respect him
as a dramatic and a comedic actor.

383
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,164
And we had pretty good chemistry...

384
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,163
...in the couple of episodes
of <i>West Wing</i> I did.

385
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,930
And here we get to play
different people.

386
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,248
And already in the couple of days
we worked together...

387
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,880
...we bounce off each other really well.
Our energies kind of--

388
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,201
We've got good chemistry.

389
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,762
There's kind of a-- Sort of
a Butch and Sundance thing...

390
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,561
...to these guys that one is--

391
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,762
I think Danny's...

392
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,609
...a little stiller, a little less buffeted
than Matt's character is.

393
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,362
But it's-- He's a lot of fun
to work with.

394
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,250
Are people looking at us right now?

395
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,201
I think they are.

396
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,089
Could you punch me in the face
or something?

397
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,969
Because to a casual observer
this appears...

398
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,884
...a little homoerotic for my comfort.

399
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,644
I definitely hear you on that.

400
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,281
- What should we do?
- Get off me.

401
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,969
- All right, just play it cool.
- Yeah.

402
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,846
The acting part
with Aaron Sorkin's words...

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,650
...is the relatively easy part.

404
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,565
And I'm not saying it's easy,
but it's exciting and inspiring...

405
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,131
...and the words are so brilliant.

406
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,282
You wait your whole career
to have lines like this.

407
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,081
Not yet, it's not. And until it is,
we're all gonna act professionally.

408
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,241
You understand?

409
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,930
We're gonna act, dress, talk,
write and behave professionally.

410
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,651
You are an adolescent,
oversexed whoremonger...

411
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,802
...with the sensitivity
of a head of cabbage.

412
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,486
And all that will begin
in just a few minutes.

413
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,211
I am the luckiest actress in town
that I get to say these words...

414
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,721
...and be directed
by Tommy Schlamme...

415
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,123
...even though his name is
Tommy Schlamme, which is crazy.

416
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,126
And Aaron's words are just, it's--
You know, it's just...

417
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,046
...I'm lucky, I'm so lucky
and I know that I'm lucky.

418
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,487
I actually love this process.

419
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,324
I'm not cynical about this process.

420
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,962
I'm not, "Gee, look at these other people
who work in television. "

421
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,562
And they're sort of either trying
to get your job or trying--

422
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,006
I-- Most of my experiences...

423
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,602
...95 per cent of my experiences
in this business have been really great.

424
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,371
And I feel very fortunate
to be able to do what I get to do.

425
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,966
So I'd like that to come across in this.

426
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,322
That even though it's tough
and even though it's difficult...

427
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,211
...and even though there's some
very high-maintenance human beings...

428
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,646
...that exist in this world...

429
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,201
...for the most part, they're people
who have come together...

430
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,971
...to work really, really hard,
long, long hours...

431
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,447
...to sort of do something
that is just gonna be enjoyed...

432
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,489
...by a lot of people
while they're eating dinner...

433
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,564
...or they're passing by or maybe they're
sitting down and really absorbing it.

434
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,960
Not on her back, on her stomach.

435
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,650
- How you doing, Kim?
- I want Tom to take his pants off.

436
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,366
Life's full of disappointments
and that will probably be one of them.

437
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,043
Stand back. Pieces might fly.

438
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,441
- You're on Vicodin?
- Yeah.

439
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,329
I may have exceeded
the recommended dosage.

440
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,087
- Should you be out of bed this soon?
- I play with pain.

441
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,481
- Where's your wife?
- Sitting right next to her husband.

442
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,688
- I was just talking to you.
- Sure.

443
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,203
I'm on a little Vicodin and some Percocet
and a steroid called Nortisone.

444
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,725
The side effect of which is mania.

445
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,962
I swear to God,
it says so right on the bottle.
