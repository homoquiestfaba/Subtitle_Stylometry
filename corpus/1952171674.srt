1
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,356
I wanna die!
Please!

2
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:20,695
Please!
I wanna die!

3
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,735
Who's suffering now,
Callisto?

4
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,308
And you thought
you were getting oblivion.

5
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:41,093
Well, this place makes Tartarus look like
a day at the beach.

6
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:43,378
How long ya in for?
Eternity?

7
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,787
That's gotta smart.

8
00:01:04,195 --> 00:01:05,555
Get over it!

9
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,461
I'm doomed to be obsessed
for eternity...

10
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:12,277
...with a woman who despises me.

11
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:13,761
What a nightmare!

12
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,288
No kidding.

13
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:19,558
You'd think... after
what I told him...

14
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:22,747
...about you,
that you would give me more respect.

15
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:26,437
Him?

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,999
You mean "Him"...

17
00:01:33,216 --> 00:01:34,963
He's come to trust me.

18
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,719
I have his ear from time to time.

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,857
I told him your... desire.

20
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,665
You mean,
he's gonna let me go back...

21
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,836
Well, he shares with you
an interest in Xena.

22
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:47,208
She's someone he thought
he had in his grasp...

23
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:49,191
...but now he's not
so sure.

24
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:53,041
You mean to tell me those stupid,
maudlin missions she goes on...

25
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:55,086
...are gonna end her up in Paradise?

26
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,680
Probably not Paradise.

27
00:01:57,681 --> 00:02:00,805
Most likely, she'll be born...
higher up the karmic ladder.

28
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,376
Right, she cooks my family,
destroys my life...

29
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:07,362
...and I end up in Hell
while she gets another shot.

30
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:08,804
That's fair.

31
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,736
Gotta love the irony.

32
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,785
You tell him... if he wants her here,
I'm the woman for that job.

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,134
You must not harm her physically...
in any way.

34
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:22,346
Your victory must be a spiritual one.

35
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,360
She's found a road
to redemption...

36
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,971
...The way of the warrior.

37
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:27,836
You'll need to get her off
that path.

38
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:30,961
And you have to agree
to take care of one other thing for him.

39
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,264
Yes?
What's that?

40
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:36,471
You know the man
they call... Caesar?

41
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,640
That Xena can really
mess up a dream, can't she?

42
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:14,710
Who are you?
How do you know about my dreams?

43
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,715
I know everything about your life, Caesar.

44
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,917
...What it's been and what it can be.

45
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:21,730
I'm here to help you get
everything you've ever desired.

46
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:24,731
It's through me
you finally fulfill your destiny.

47
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,116
I can give you ultimate power...

48
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,844
...and free you from your greatest torment.

49
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:33,665
Xena...

50
00:03:34,146 --> 00:03:36,160
Yes... Xena.

51
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:40,311
I can't tell you how much
we have in common in that way.

52
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,044
Let me guess...
This Eli guy,...

53
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,432
...he's the one that taught you all this
"love your enemy" stuff?

54
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,405
That's right.

55
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,420
Xena, why do we have to go see
a preacher?

56
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,347
...When there are battles to fight,
butts to kick?

57
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:02,555
'Cause whatever Gabrielle wants,
Gabrielle gets.

58
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:05,760
Excuse me. When's the next ship
for Athens?

59
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,828
What'd you do that for?
I had him.

60
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:18,797
Right.

61
00:05:29,216 --> 00:05:30,778
What do you want with me?

62
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:32,389
Caesar's reward.

63
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:35,383
Six million dinars.

64
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:38,804
-Six million dinars?
-That's quite a temptation...

65
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:41,569
...Not for me,
for every killer in Europe.

66
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:43,740
So, it's come to this.

67
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:45,775
Caesar wants me out of the way so bad...

68
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:47,765
...he's willing to deplete
his fortune to do it.

69
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:52,278
I think it's time I put an end
to this feud between Caesar and me.

70
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,784
You're not gonna try to make peace
with that slime, are you?

71
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
No.

72
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,045
I'm going to kill him.

73
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,562
<i>In the time of ancient gods,...</i>

74
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:15,890
<i>...warlords...</i>

75
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:17,266
<i>...and kings...</i>

76
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:21,484
<i>...a land in turmoil
cried out for a hero.</i>

77
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,720
<i>She was Xena.</i>

78
00:06:32,993 --> 00:06:34,672
<i>A mighty princess...</i>

79
00:06:34,673 --> 00:06:36,691
<i>...forged in the heat of battle.</i>

80
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,471
<i>The power...</i>

81
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:45,766
<i>The passion...</i>

82
00:06:48,781 --> 00:06:50,097
<i>The danger...</i>

83
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:58,272
<i>Her courage will change the world.</i>

84
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:03,064
XENA, THE WARRIOR PRINCESS

85
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,337
Xena...

86
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:10,497
Xena, you can't just
walk into Rome and kill Caesar.

87
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,793
It's an opportunity
to kill a lot of romans.

88
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:14,311
I say we do it.

89
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:17,217
We're not doing anything.
I'm going to Rome, not you.

90
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,933
Gabrielle, I can't take you,
not after that vision.

91
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,227
What vision?

92
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,723
I had a vision once that...

93
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:26,478
...Gabrielle and I would die
at the hands of romans.

94
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:29,400
It's bad enough that we can run
into romans anywhere...

95
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,403
-...but if you and I were to go to Rome...
-Ok.

96
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:33,873
Well, what if I ask you
not to do this?

97
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:37,430
Gabrielle, he's an evil man,
and he's trying to kill me.

98
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:40,428
I have to take him out
or die trying.

99
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,179
It's the way of the warrior.

100
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:45,683
Was I in this vision?

101
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,952
-No.
-Then I should go with you.

102
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,352
Amarice, you're staying here
with Gabrielle.

103
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:54,167
As her bodyguard?

104
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,327
As her friend.

105
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,434
You could learn something
if you listened to her once in a while.

106
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,529
You promise you won't follow me?

107
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:08,513
I promise.

108
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,551
Xena... Be careful.

109
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:35,165
There's Xena's head.

110
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:41,802
Kill him.

111
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,298
-Move it!
-Take "Xena" with you.

112
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,499
Please, no!

113
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,192
I did as you said.

114
00:08:57,193 --> 00:09:00,739
So far, I've had eight impostors
try to claim the reward.

115
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,721
Xena will defeat any mercen'ry
who attacks her.

116
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:05,457
Of course.

117
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,968
The reward was just
to get her attention.

118
00:09:09,436 --> 00:09:11,186
She will come to you.

119
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,369
You need to be ready.

120
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,493
Yes. Well, I've made plans for that,
of course.

121
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,132
Really? Well...

122
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,220
I suggest you just have
one more card to play.

123
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,176
It's him. It's Eli.

124
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:00,918
Your heart is pure, Mazin.

125
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:06,490
Abba...

126
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:10,115
Make Mazin's body
as whole as his spirit.

127
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,609
Rise, Mazin.

128
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:33,609
It's done.

129
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:35,173
You're healed.

130
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:36,809
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

131
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,800
Now, go.
Good luck.

132
00:10:39,241 --> 00:10:40,441
Go.

133
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:44,168
Go.

134
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:58,849
Gabrielle...

135
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,854
Eli...

136
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,803
I'm so happy to see you...

137
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:09,572
I heard you were teaching in Greece.
I set out to find you.

138
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:11,263
Where's Xena?

139
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:13,902
She... has some work to do.

140
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,694
This is my friend, Amarice.

141
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:19,348
Hello, Amarice.

142
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,094
If somebody threatened your mother,
would you fight to defend her?

143
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:27,821
Amarice and I
have some philosophical differences.

144
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:31,269
I see.
We've got a lot to talk about.

145
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,659
Come on.

146
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:42,056
Can you teach me to heal?

147
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,720
All I can do
is try and teach you how to love.

148
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:50,817
But if you love
with all your heart and soul...

149
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,360
...If you become love itself...

150
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,932
...then you can heal.

151
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,096
Why is love the key?

152
00:12:00,162 --> 00:12:02,493
Selfless, pure love,...

153
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:06,367
...is the only expression
of divine perfection we have in this world.

154
00:12:07,486 --> 00:12:09,484
It's the greatest power
one can possess.

155
00:12:09,485 --> 00:12:10,685
Oh, come on...

156
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:12,900
The only real power's
at the end of a sword.

157
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,912
Did you hear that?

158
00:12:21,153 --> 00:12:22,339
What?

159
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,288
Boots.

160
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:34,479
And if the other side
has more swords?

161
00:12:34,736 --> 00:12:37,751
If you can love your way out
of this one, be my guest.

162
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:41,595
-Brutus...
-Hello, Gabrielle.

163
00:12:44,883 --> 00:12:47,098
You're doing Caesar's bidding again?

164
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:50,300
Caesar believes Xena is trying to kill him.
He has to protect himself.

165
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:52,333
With me.

166
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:54,439
I understand.

167
00:12:55,102 --> 00:12:56,812
Let these people go.

168
00:12:56,813 --> 00:13:00,198
My orders are
to arrest you, Eli and his followers.

169
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,226
You'll be taken as hostages...

170
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:04,005
...against Xena killing Caesar.

171
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,818
Caesar's promised me
no one will be hurt.

172
00:13:07,106 --> 00:13:08,513
And you believe him...

173
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:10,524
Our friends are at war,
Gabrielle.

174
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:13,516
I'm sorry this brings us into conflict,
but it's inevitable.

175
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,685
Of course it is.

176
00:13:17,325 --> 00:13:18,535
Move.

177
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:21,628
Let's go!

178
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:23,069
Come on.

179
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:55,481
-Who the...?
-At ease.

180
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:22,929
Let's make this short and sweet.

181
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:33,556
Brings back memories,
doesn't it, Xena?

182
00:14:40,457 --> 00:14:41,653
Guards!

183
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:35,401
-This way!
-Look behind every...!

184
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,865
My, that was a shocker now,
wasn't it?

185
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:56,788
Don't bother. You've already done
all the damage you can to me.

186
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,602
Thanks, by the way.

187
00:15:58,643 --> 00:15:59,843
For what?

188
00:15:59,844 --> 00:16:02,861
I wanted to cease existing
and you did your best to help.

189
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,794
But as you can see, it didn't take.

190
00:16:04,795 --> 00:16:06,666
They wouldn't let me off the hook
that easy.

191
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,295
Who's "they"?

192
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:11,360
I don't know.
Whoever it is that does the final judging.

193
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,443
They sent me to a place
that makes Tartarus look like...

194
00:16:14,444 --> 00:16:17,245
...the Elysian Fields.
They call it Hell.

195
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:20,103
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer gal.

196
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,286
The one who runs things down,
where I come from,...

197
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:28,655
...he's very interested
in what happens in this life.

198
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,724
He figures Caesar
will be very valuable to him.

199
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,442
And, of course, he also figures
you might be an obstacle.

200
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:37,239
Then he figures right.
And I won't be the only one.

201
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,383
Plenty of people will oppose
Caesar becoming emperor.

202
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,858
Ah, you know
about the emperor thing...

203
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,605
The laurel wreath kind 'a gave it away.

204
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,829
I'm guessing that he'll anounce it...

205
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,422
...when the Senate reconvenes
on the Ides of March.

206
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,744
My, aren't you the clever girl?

207
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,222
Yes, some people will be unhappy...

208
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,050
...but everybody has their price.

209
00:17:00,051 --> 00:17:01,657
Even the honorable Brutus.

210
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:04,063
Caesar's gonna give him Gaul
and that should keep him smiling.

211
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,810
But it's you, my darling...

212
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,855
It's you that I'm worried about.

213
00:17:10,344 --> 00:17:12,147
I'm here to make you
an offer.

214
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:13,441
Forget it.

215
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,852
-Afraid you'll be tempted?
-Yeah, that's right.

216
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,264
I'll give you a little hint.

217
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:19,593
Gabrielle's in roman hands
as we speak.

218
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,704
-You lie.
-Do I?

219
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,437
My lord gave me a thorough briefing
as to what's happened...

220
00:17:24,438 --> 00:17:26,824
...to you and Gabrielle
since the last time we met.

221
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,371
I know everything about India and Eli.

222
00:17:31,505 --> 00:17:34,466
So you're not the only clever girl now,
Xena, are you?

223
00:17:34,788 --> 00:17:38,773
Gabrielle's on her way to a roman prison
in the Appenines as we speak.

224
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:40,737
So...

225
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,609
About my offer...

226
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:44,808
Get lost.

227
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:48,159
Oh, but I'm not going anywhere,
Xena.

228
00:18:16,576 --> 00:18:18,097
Come on!
Move it!

229
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,698
Move it! Go!

230
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:33,360
Keep moving!

231
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:50,393
Jailer, these prisoners
are to be held here.

232
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,192
Yes, we've been waiting for them.

233
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:56,047
Those crosses...
Who are they for?

234
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,949
We're expecting a boatload
of pirates any day.

235
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:09,256
No!

236
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,925
Don't harm Gabrielle!

237
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:16,608
Of course not!
I'm still useful to you, Brutus!

238
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,220
Get up.

239
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:20,940
Not until you pardon her
for what she just did.

240
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:22,766
She attacked one of my men.

241
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,402
And I remember a time
when mercy was shown to you!

242
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,313
Put down your swords.

243
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,595
Chain her to the prop.

244
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:49,280
Oh, please...
Can't you just break my legs?

245
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,201
Come on, you.
Move it!

246
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:53,862
Get in there.

247
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,863
Nice move.

248
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,646
You know, if I had a little backup
maybe I could have pulled it off.

249
00:20:02,928 --> 00:20:06,346
You don't really think those crosses
are for a boatload of pirates, do you?

250
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:08,055
Caesar's never lied to me.

251
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:11,199
There's a first time for everything.

252
00:20:53,761 --> 00:20:55,160
Hello, Brutus.

253
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,225
I have a deal for you.

254
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,089
You tell me where my friend,
Gabrielle, is,...

255
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,231
...and I will give you some information
that will save your stinkin' life.

256
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:12,606
Deal?

257
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,295
Tell you what...

258
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:19,787
You promise to tell me
and I will go first.

259
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:21,836
Do I have you your word?

260
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:24,096
And you trust me?

261
00:21:24,229 --> 00:21:27,022
Everyone says that Brutus
is an honorable man.

262
00:21:27,023 --> 00:21:28,629
Do I have your word?

263
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,304
Yeah.

264
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:34,345
Beware the Ides of March,
Brutus.

265
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:35,925
Why the Ides of March?

266
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:38,970
Because on that day,
Caesar will declare himself emperor.

267
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,052
I don't believe you.
Why would he do that?

268
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:43,253
Greed...

269
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:46,040
Lust for power...
An ego the size of the Aegean.

270
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:49,615
Of course, he plans to rid himself
of anyone who would stand in his way.

271
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:51,300
What are you saying?

272
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:53,494
He's too smart
to kill you in Rome.

273
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:55,787
You have much too much support there.

274
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:57,723
But I have firsthand knowledge...

275
00:21:57,764 --> 00:22:00,159
...that he's been talking
to assassins in Gaul.

276
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,422
So...

277
00:22:04,264 --> 00:22:05,624
Your turn.

278
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:11,255
Come on, Brutus.

279
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,541
Gabrielle saved your life once.

280
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:16,895
Give me a chance to save hers.

281
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:22,308
I put her in a prison compound
at the foot of Mt. Amaro.

282
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:26,436
I don't believe what you said
about Caesar.

283
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,896
It's your funeral.

284
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:35,493
Brutus...

285
00:22:37,417 --> 00:22:39,427
Was it snowing on Mt. Amaro?

286
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:42,040
Yes, it was snowing when I left.

287
00:23:38,174 --> 00:23:39,435
I did it.

288
00:23:40,016 --> 00:23:41,343
Did what?

289
00:23:41,344 --> 00:23:43,560
You two are sitting there
like a couple of bumps on a log.

290
00:23:43,561 --> 00:23:46,363
-What could you have done?
-She did nothing.

291
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:48,192
That's right, I did nothing.

292
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,400
We're gonna be nailed to crosses
tomorrow morning...

293
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,385
...and you two are bragging about
doing nothing?

294
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:53,959
You don't understand, Amarice.

295
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,402
In order to become
a perfect vessel for love...

296
00:23:56,403 --> 00:23:58,230
...one has to cease all activity.

297
00:23:58,231 --> 00:24:00,288
Not only physical, but mental as well.

298
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,407
It's only when you've reached
that state of emptiness...

299
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,121
...that you're ready, at last,
to be filled with love.

300
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:09,702
Just in time, too.

301
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:12,325
You'll be able to love the people
who crucify us...

302
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:43,365
I just keep coming back.

303
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:45,723
In that way, I'm more dependable
than your chakram.

304
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,206
My lord sees everything, Xena,...

305
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:49,996
...and you don't have
to go through with this.

306
00:24:49,997 --> 00:24:53,392
I can arrange it for you and Gabrielle
and all her peaceful little friends...

307
00:24:53,393 --> 00:24:55,990
...to just walk out of here
and no one gets hurt.

308
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,877
And you and Gabrielle can live
happily ever after.

309
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:01,471
What's the catch?

310
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,990
Well, there is one little thing.

311
00:25:03,991 --> 00:25:05,763
You have to drop your sword...

312
00:25:05,764 --> 00:25:08,963
...and join Gabrielle
in fulfilling a life of loving kindness.

313
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:12,403
I'm still not interested.

314
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:14,115
That's because
you haven't heard it all, yet.

315
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:15,918
I'm offering you complete serenity.

316
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,626
Go on.

317
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,749
There's a reason you can't allow you
and your partner peace.

318
00:25:24,475 --> 00:25:25,798
It's your guilt.

319
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:28,057
It motivates everything you do.

320
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:29,912
Torments you.

321
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:32,714
Invite me into your soul...

322
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,411
...and I can purge you of that guilt.

323
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,704
I can cleanse you of that shame
that drives you.

324
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,860
I can give you peace if you let me.

325
00:25:43,981 --> 00:25:45,772
What's it gonna be, Xena?

326
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:47,654
Serenity and happiness?

327
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:51,223
Or another ride in that wagon
with your friend Gabrielle?

328
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:52,613
Think of your vision.

329
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:57,220
You're trying to tempt me
from my way by offering me peace.

330
00:25:58,661 --> 00:25:59,961
In a nutshell.

331
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:01,962
That guilt you're depending on...

332
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:03,729
I put it all behind me.

333
00:26:04,695 --> 00:26:06,488
You see, I know now what I have to do.

334
00:26:06,489 --> 00:26:08,696
I have to be the best warrior
I can be.

335
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:12,368
To redeem myself,
I have to fight evil with a sword...

336
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:15,180
...and that's what I'm gonna do,
no matter what the consequences.

337
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:18,510
Damn!

338
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:21,104
Brutus...

339
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,266
Welcome.

340
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:29,341
You... deposited our little friend
in a safe place, I trust?

341
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:31,222
-Yes.
-Perfect.

342
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,760
Caesar...

343
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:37,244
They were building crosses
when I was there.

344
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:38,443
Of course.

345
00:26:38,444 --> 00:26:40,954
You can't have a crucifixion
without crosses, Brutus.

346
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:43,393
You're crucifying Gabrielle...

347
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,589
All of them.

348
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:49,340
But you told me she would be safe. You
were only going to use her as a distraction.

349
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:53,153
Well, what would distract Xena
more than her best friend's execution?

350
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,950
Tomorrow, on the Ides of March...

351
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:58,819
...The very day I need Xena
most distracted.

352
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:01,665
What happens
on the Ides of March?

353
00:27:03,244 --> 00:27:05,870
I'm going to make an announcement,
Brutus.

354
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:08,247
An announcement that will change history.

355
00:27:09,403 --> 00:27:11,314
How are the troops looking up there?

356
00:27:12,284 --> 00:27:13,996
-Excellent.
-Good...

357
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:17,234
Because in a few days, I want you to take
command of one of those legions.

358
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,945
The thirteenth, if you like.

359
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,749
-March 'em into Gaul.
-Why Gaul?

360
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:24,341
I can't tell you that right now, Brutus,
but,...

361
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:26,293
...trust me.

362
00:27:27,175 --> 00:27:28,432
Marc Antony!

363
00:27:29,354 --> 00:27:30,541
How are you?

364
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:39,318
I always thought I'd die in battle,
not hung on a cross.

365
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,770
Do you think Xena will make it in time?

366
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:44,606
She'll be here.

367
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,803
All right,
let's keep it simple.

368
00:28:05,924 --> 00:28:07,905
I keep the vision from coming true...

369
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,721
...and you leave Caesar alone.

370
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,555
Ok, Xena.
You had your chance.

371
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:34,349
-It's Xena!
-Find her!

372
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,485
Xena...

373
00:28:49,765 --> 00:28:51,372
I'm so glad to see you...!

374
00:28:51,373 --> 00:28:54,304
Listen... That vision
is not going to happen, all right?

375
00:28:54,642 --> 00:28:55,853
Here.

376
00:28:55,854 --> 00:28:57,052
Take this.

377
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:59,423
Come on, Eli.
Get up!

378
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:03,747
All right, let's go!

379
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,565
-They're trying to escape!
-Get them!

380
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,323
-Go ahead! Run!
-This way!

381
00:30:00,906 --> 00:30:03,206
-Run! Move!
-We need more men!

382
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:04,407
Go!

383
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:06,200
Go!

384
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,769
No.

385
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:17,512
Run for the woods!
Go!

386
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,199
No.

387
00:31:22,496 --> 00:31:24,001
Go! Let's go!

388
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:29,024
No!

389
00:31:34,266 --> 00:31:35,575
Get up!

390
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,416
I can't, Gabrielle.

391
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,589
It's my spine...

392
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:43,438
I can't move.

393
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:53,381
Interesting.

394
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,798
No, Gabrielle, no!

395
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:55,936
Gabrielle...

396
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:02,976
Xena...

397
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:24,382
You're crying?

398
00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:26,650
Don't cry.

399
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:30,802
I won't.

400
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:32,692
Rest.

401
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,985
It won't be long, now.

402
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:12,542
Rome is under threat.

403
00:34:12,543 --> 00:34:15,562
I have conclusive proof
that Caesar is responsible.

404
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:21,224
Friends!

405
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,700
Caesar...

406
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:25,811
-Hail, Caesar.
-Most welcome.

407
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,718
He thinks he's a god.

408
00:34:32,963 --> 00:34:35,328
I made you leave
the way of love.

409
00:34:36,356 --> 00:34:38,844
-It was my fault.
-I had a choice.

410
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,145
To do nothing or save my friend.
I chose the way of friendship.

411
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,534
I'm sorry for all the times
I didn't treat you right.

412
00:34:51,844 --> 00:34:52,824
Xena...

413
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:55,831
You've brought out the best in me.

414
00:34:58,691 --> 00:35:01,895
Before I met you,
no one saw me for who I was.

415
00:35:03,474 --> 00:35:06,060
I felt... invisible.

416
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,944
But you saw
all the things that I could be.

417
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:12,502
You saved me, Xena.

418
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:16,262
I wish...

419
00:35:17,877 --> 00:35:19,077
What?

420
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,109
...that I had 'a read your scrolls
just once.

421
00:35:26,127 --> 00:35:27,600
You would have liked them.

422
00:35:29,623 --> 00:35:30,823
I know.

423
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,622
It's time!

424
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:50,832
On your feet!

425
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,859
What's the matter, Brutus?

426
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,568
-Do you have anything to tell me?
-Tell you?

427
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,965
-What do you mean?
-About this...

428
00:36:27,966 --> 00:36:29,816
...announcement you're going to make today.

429
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:31,048
Oh, that.

430
00:36:31,129 --> 00:36:33,321
Yes, well, at first,
you probably won't like it, but...

431
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:35,387
...I plan to persuade you.

432
00:36:35,468 --> 00:36:37,314
Are you ready for your trip to Gaul?

433
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,178
-I'll be ready.
-Good.

434
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:55,250
Don't give me that confident look.

435
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,197
You're about to die like a slave
and drag your friend with you...

436
00:36:58,198 --> 00:36:59,781
...and it's all right by me.

437
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:04,616
Your lord might not feel
the same way.

438
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,963
He sent you on a mission, didn't he?

439
00:37:08,345 --> 00:37:11,539
Making Caesar dictator
was his main concern.

440
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,821
And once he's ruling...

441
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:16,353
...making him an agent of my lord
will be easy.

442
00:37:16,354 --> 00:37:18,392
So while you lie here
helpless...

443
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:20,388
...he's declaring himself emperor.

444
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,842
Good senators!

445
00:37:23,843 --> 00:37:26,037
True patriots of Rome!

446
00:37:26,038 --> 00:37:27,830
Your attention, please!

447
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:30,620
I have an important announcement
to make!

448
00:37:49,678 --> 00:37:51,966
To quell civil unrest...

449
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:56,935
...I have decided to make an important
change to our government.

450
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,345
Gabrielle...

451
00:38:05,775 --> 00:38:07,987
You were the best thing in my life.

452
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:11,609
I love you, Xena.

453
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,973
And I must supply...

454
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,949
...the leadership
so desperately needed.

455
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,603
On this day...

456
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,456
...the 15th of March...

457
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,615
...I declare myself...

458
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,162
And you, Brutus?

459
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,791
Gabrielle...

460
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,516
Gabrielle...

461
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:32,374
