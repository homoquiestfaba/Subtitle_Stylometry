1
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,179
What exactly
are you looking for, Mr. Warren?

2
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:17,137
A pen pal?

3
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,531
No, I'm looking to get married,

4
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,706
start a family.

5
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:22,838
Well...

6
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:24,753
You came to the right place.

7
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,451
I can introduce you to
some beautiful Filipinas,

8
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,758
there are plenty of them
around here.

9
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,283
But you're looking
at the wrong book.

10
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:36,112
That only has photos of
girls from overseas.

11
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:38,549
That's what I want,
they make the best wives.

12
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:42,510
Were you married before
to a Filipina?

13
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:44,729
No, I was never married.

14
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:48,690
Cause you sound as if
you're talking from experience.

15
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,040
I spent 20 years
in the Merchant Marines.

16
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:53,695
I did a lot of traveling
through the Far East.

17
00:02:57,046 --> 00:02:59,527
Do you have any other girls
I could look at?

18
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:00,789
Why?

19
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,792
You didn't see anyone you liked?

20
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:07,143
Some of them look like
bar girls to me.

21
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:11,103
Well, I think that's about it.

22
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,802
But let me look at
my other file.

23
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,718
Maybe I can find someone.

24
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,722
Or I could leave you my name,
and you could contact me.

25
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:26,815
You're in luck!

26
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,298
Take your pick.

27
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,009
These three look like
bar girls too.

28
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,579
Wow...

29
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,581
She's beautiful.

30
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:58,412
Her name is Dalisay Dimagiba.

31
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,588
She's 21 years old.

32
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:05,593
You know, "Dalisay" means "pure"
in Tagalog.

33
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,669
[speaking Tagalog]

34
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,661
So we're gonna tear down
this wall over here, right?

35
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,837
And then this is gonna be
the baby's room.

36
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,013
Well, you know,
when the time comes...

37
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,841
Then once
we're settled upstairs,

38
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:00,148
Nick is gonna start on
expanding the store.

39
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,542
And then once Uncle Ralph
moves to Florida,

40
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:04,544
we're going
to rent out his place.

41
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,372
You're not having
second thoughts about

42
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,244
selling your parents's place
to Nick, are you?

43
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:10,898
No, no, of course not.

44
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,944
The place is nothing but
bad memories for me.

45
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,206
The sooner, the better.

46
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,383
Come on,
it wasn't all that bad!

47
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:20,037
Uncle Ralph,
you lived above them,

48
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:22,039
I lived with them,
I should know.

49
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,954
It's not going to be
the same around here,

50
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,260
you're going to California,

51
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:27,088
and you moving down
to Florida.

52
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,872
Don't remind me!

53
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:29,743
Oh, come on!

54
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:31,919
No more noise,
no more pollution,

55
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:33,747
no more subway... 
[Sound of a subway passing.]

56
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,618
Come on, peace and quiet.

57
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,620
A great place to die!

58
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:39,970
Oh come on,
don't be so dramatic!

59
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,365
I'm not being dramatic,
it's the truth!

60
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:47,064
You retire down there,
you die down there.

61
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,719
Now I don't know about you,
but if I'm gonna die,

62
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,591
I wanna die up here
with the family,

63
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,723
instead of down there all alone.

64
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,726
- He's talking about dying
again? - What else?

65
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,381
Alma, what did I tell you
about touching the blueprints?

66
00:09:59,642 --> 00:09:59,990
What?

67
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,601
- Are your hands clean?
- Yes!

68
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:03,603
I had my arms on it,
I wasn't really touching it.

69
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:05,474
You gotta be very careful
with these things,

70
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:06,693
they're very expensive.

71
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,130
I know,
I was just showing it to Jan!

72
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,481
Where do you want this
furniture?

73
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:13,917
- What furniture?
- It's here!

74
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:16,790
- The furniture's here!
- The dining room set?

75
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,096
- You asked them to deliver it?
- Well, they called.

76
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,924
They're not supposed to bring it
until they finish upstairs,

77
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:22,447
they haven't even started yet!

78
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:23,405
But you're not listening,

79
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:25,363
they called and
said if they delivered it today,

80
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,365
they wouldn't charge me
for the delivery...

81
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,673
- Where we supposed to put it?
- We could find a place for it.

82
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,676
We're saving all that money,
and it came from North Carolina.

83
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,809
- How big is it?
- It's big.

84
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:37,332
It's big.

85
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,814
- Put it in back.
- You got it.

86
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:44,121
- Where the hell is your
brother? - I don't know...

87
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,950
Oh shit, it's late!
I gotta get out of here.

88
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,996
I gotta go pick up my kid.

89
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,654
[Sound of subway passing by.]

90
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,401
[Subway noise gets louder.]

91
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,974
What about your brother?
Ain't you gonna wait for him?

92
00:11:11,018 --> 00:11:13,150
I can't wait for forever.
I got my own life to live.

93
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,021
But you promised.

94
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:15,283
You said you were going
to talk to him,

95
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:16,545
find out what's going on.

96
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,721
Look, I got stuff coming!

97
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,201
I'm starting to get worried.

98
00:11:20,244 --> 00:11:21,245
So what are you worried about?

99
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,247
My brother said he'd sell you
the building, didn't he?

100
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:24,684
But I get this funny feeling

101
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:27,164
your brother plans on staying
in your parent's apartment.

102
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:28,949
Yeah, well, he better not!

103
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:32,430
Jan, your brother hasn't been
around this long in over 15
years.

104
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:33,605
Oh, it's only temporary,

105
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:35,564
where else was he supposed
to stay when he got back?

106
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:37,305
"Back" was supposed to be
for only a week.

107
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:38,610
He's here a month already!

108
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:40,874
I don't think he's even looking
for another place to live!

109
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,529
Jan, I gave a down payment
to the contractor,

110
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,357
I don't even have a start date.

111
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,750
What is the matter with you?

112
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,534
You couldn't wait until
everything was signed?

113
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,580
You, of all people,
you know my brother!

114
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,364
Please, do me a favor,

115
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:55,018
talk to your brother,
find out what's going on.

116
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:57,412
Forget about me
wanting to expand the store.

117
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:58,718
Do it for Alma.

118
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,372
That's all she talks about
is moving upstairs.

119
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:03,374
It'll break her heart
if this falls through.

120
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:05,159
[Sound of car 
honking impatiently.]

121
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:14,081
Hey, where were you yesterday?

122
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,170
Couldn't make it.

123
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:18,650
That's all you got
to say for yourself?

124
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,652
I kept that super waiting
for an hour!

125
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:22,785
This is the last time!

126
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,222
I convinced that guy to hold
that place for a week

127
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,616
so you could see it, and you
don't even bother to show up?

128
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,097
Look, it's not
the only apartment in New York.

129
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,488
Oh yeah?

130
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,663
Then you find one yourself.

131
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:34,362
Don't expect anymore help from
me. You better find one quick.

132
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:36,756
As soon as these papers are
signed, I'm taking my kid,

133
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,062
we're going out to California,
permanently.

134
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:41,108
You better not
fuck up my plans!

135
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,286
Hey, Dean!

136
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,812
You wanna take a look
at these blueprints?

137
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:52,162
Some other time, I'm tired.

138
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:06,220
[speaking Tagalog]

139
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,507
You're Filipina?

140
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,814
That's right.
How did you know?

141
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:48,817
I spent a lot of time
traveling to the Far East.

142
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:54,083
Your wife?

143
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:55,302
Soon, I hope.

144
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,827
She's beautiful!

145
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,134
Trying to get her over,
so we can get married.

146
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,700
That sounds romantic.

147
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,137
Yeah, I know.

148
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:08,358
[Sound of door opening.]

149
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,799
The shit's gonna hit the fan
when they'll find out.

150
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,627
Look at it this way...

151
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,716
If I'm staying,
so are you.

152
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:22,285
Shit, it's no big deal
if I go down to Florida.

153
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,157
My life is almost over.

154
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,462
You're just starting out.

155
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,464
I know what this
place means to you.

156
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,727
The same as when
your parents built it,

157
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,555
it meant a lot to them too.

158
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,035
And now look at!

159
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:35,646
Sister...

160
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,085
So bitter, she can't wait
to sell the place off.

161
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:43,132
And you know you who's gonna
wind up with everything?

162
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,221
The whole kitten kaboodle?

163
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,353
Your cousin, Nick.

164
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,268
The errand boy!

165
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,358
Do they know about
the Philippine girl?

166
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,055
No, not yet.

167
00:16:58,278 --> 00:16:59,453
Any news yet?

168
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:00,932
It's too early.

169
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,195
Uncle Ralph...

170
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:03,805
Go to the bathroom.

171
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:06,721
Shit, I gotta take some leak!

172
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,028
See you later.

173
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,293
[Apartment door closing.]

174
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:16,731
[speaking Tagalog]

175
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,742
It's been almost three weeks

176
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:06,135
since I received 
your last letter.

177
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,138
I'm wondering why 
I haven't heard from you.

178
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,793
I spoke to Miss Amador 
at the agency,

179
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:15,928
and she told me that your visa papers should be processed soon.

180
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,931
I hope all is well with you.

181
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,499
Take care, 
and say hello to your family.

182
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,724
I'm really looking 
forward to seeing you.

183
00:29:30,464 --> 00:29:31,639
Love...

184
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:33,946
[Sound of door opening.]

185
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:35,774
Hi!

186
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,951
Don't bother to knock,
just let yourselves in.

187
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:42,084
Take a guess
where we just came from?

188
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,651
Surprise me.

189
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,784
Our lawyer's office.

190
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:46,828
Where else?

191
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:50,527
Finally.

192
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:57,099
Let's get all of this over with.

193
00:29:57,143 --> 00:29:59,928
Everything's down on paper,
just the way we discussed.

194
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:02,148
You're welcome to look
everything over.

195
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,803
Our lawyer looked it over,
everything's in order.

196
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,935
All we need is your signature.

197
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,763
I've changed my mind.

198
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,289
What are you talking about,
"change your mind"?

199
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:14,856
Change your mind about what?

200
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,726
I'm not gonna sign.

201
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,120
What do you mean
you're not gonna sign?

202
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,862
Exactly what I said.
I'm not signing.

203
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,821
I'm staying.
I want to keep this place.

204
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,910
I knew he was gonna pull shit
like this, I knew it!

205
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,737
You're signing.

206
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:29,175
I need this goddamn money!
Now you sign it!

207
00:30:30,176 --> 00:30:31,177
I'm not signing.

208
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:33,396
I'll send you your half
when I get it.

209
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,876
Yeah, I don't believe you.

210
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:38,140
We all agreed on this
after you mother died.

211
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:40,577
I spent a lot of money already.

212
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:41,535
And what about Alma?

213
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,190
She's expecting to move
in here any day now.

214
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,322
I don't know what to tell you.

215
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:48,585
All I know is that I'm staying.

216
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,240
You selfish son-of-a-bitch,
you got one helluva nerve!

217
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:52,981
You are not gonna
fuck up my plans now,

218
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,940
you sign these goddamn papers!

219
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,336
Where the hell do you think
you're going?

220
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,512
- We're not through yet.
- Well, I am.

221
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,558
After everything I did
for your family,

222
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,385
you treat me this way!

223
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:07,387
- You son-of-a-bitch!
- Nick!

224
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,912
[Sound of subway passing.]

225
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:14,089
Make sure you close the door
when you're through.

226
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:15,743
Go on!

227
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:16,787
Go on! Disappear!

228
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,702
That's all you've done
your whole life!

229
00:31:18,746 --> 00:31:19,573
Run away!

230
00:31:20,748 --> 00:31:22,532
Run away,
and this time don't come back!

231
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:23,882
Hey Dean!

232
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,058
Look what came today!

233
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,755
Thanks, Uncle Ralph!

234
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:31,759
What's this shit?

235
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:40,072
[speaking Tagalog]

236
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:58,020
- Hey, Dick, how you doing
today? - Not bad, Dean!

237
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:00,196
Hey, Manny and Mo, let's go!

238
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,024
Let me get in the street
sometime this week!

239
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,461
Time is money!

240
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,723
Aye, aye, Captain!

241
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,296
[Sound of hood slamming shut.]

242
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,169
Hey, hey, Dino!
You looking for something?

243
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:21,000
That smells exotic!

244
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,176
Looking for these, Romeo?

245
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:27,136
Listen, what are you,
the Two Stooges?

246
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,225
Gimme the picture and
the fucking letters,

247
00:41:29,269 --> 00:41:31,140
I don't have time
to jerk off, alright?

248
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:32,533
That's the best you can do?

249
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:34,404
Come on, where'd you
pick her up? Chinatown?

250
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,624
Wo Hop's? What happened?
Who is she?

251
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:39,540
I gotta get out in the street.
Give me the fucking letters!

252
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:41,324
Take it easy. We just
wanna know who she is.

253
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,239
- Wanna play that game?
- Whadya mean...?

254
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,373
[Sound of Dean gunning motor.]

255
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:49,507
Oh!

256
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:52,858
Take it easy. We're just
trying to have a few laughs.

257
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,512
What are you trying to do?
Kill us?

258
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:55,382
Come here.

259
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,428
No bullshit,
does she do your shirts?

260
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:02,258
Give me the fucking pictures
and the letter right now.

261
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:03,651
What if we don't want to
give them to you?

262
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:06,001
What if you don't?
These your tools?

263
00:42:06,045 --> 00:42:06,959
Yeah, they're my tools.

264
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:08,830
I'm gonna toss 'em
in the East River,

265
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:09,265
that's what.

266
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:11,267
Don't do that, my Allen
wrenches are in there.

267
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:13,661
I don't give a fuck
if you got your sister in there.

268
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,010
Give me the fucking...

269
00:42:15,054 --> 00:42:16,229
And the letters.

270
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,013
- You want your tools?
- Yeah, yeah.

271
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:18,710
Back up.

272
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:20,233
I wanna give them to you.
Back up.

273
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,278
Have a nice day, assholes!

274
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:23,236
[Screeching tires.]

275
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:04,538
[speaking Tagalog]

276
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:51,629
[Sound of rooster crowing.]

277
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:09,168
[Knocking sound on front door.]

278
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,735
Coming!

279
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:20,353
[More knocking.]

280
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:26,664
So, you bought a new lock?

281
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,450
I hope you spent your money
on a good one.

282
00:44:40,025 --> 00:44:41,548
I'm impressed.

283
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,214
Remember these?

284
00:44:57,651 --> 00:44:59,522
I want you
to tell me right now

285
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,524
why you won't sign these papers.

286
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,178
I'm gonna settle down.

287
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:05,137
I'm going to get married.

288
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:07,269
My brother getting married!

289
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,750
I guess that means you want
to start a family, too, right?

290
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,534
Yeah. Why?
Is anything wrong with that?

291
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:13,841
Yeah, I'll tell you what's
wrong with that.

292
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:15,887
You don't deserve a family!

293
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,671
What do you know about family?

294
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,848
What do you know
about this family?

295
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:23,242
How sweet?
I'm touched!

296
00:45:23,285 --> 00:45:26,201
Are you trying to tell me
that you care for them now?

297
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:27,463
You're a real fucking hypocrite.

298
00:45:29,074 --> 00:45:30,858
You didn't even have the decency
to visit them at the cemetery.

299
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:33,078
Look, don't walk away from me!

300
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:36,908
Isn't 20 years enough? Don't you
ever get tired of running away?

301
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,389
- What are you talking about?
- What about him?

302
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:43,392
It wasn't bad enough that he had
to drink himself to death,

303
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,046
you had to leave me
and Mom alone

304
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,787
while you were cruising
somewhere

305
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,789
on the other side
of the fucking world!

306
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:52,314
Jesus, you couldn't even
come home for his funeral!

307
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,664
By the time I found out,
it was too late.

308
00:45:54,708 --> 00:45:56,318
Oh too late, my ass!

309
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:00,105
You were on some drunken binge
with one of your bimbo
girlfriends.

310
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,283
Why did you leave me
here all alone?

311
00:46:05,458 --> 00:46:07,765
This place was fucking hell

312
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:10,463
taking care of
that sick miserable woman!

313
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:13,640
If it wasn't for Nick,

314
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:15,773
we would've been
out on the streets!

315
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:18,471
I tried...

316
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:21,822
I tried so hard
to keep this place,

317
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:22,997
but did you care?

318
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,435
No, you never even stayed
long enough to care!

319
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:29,482
No wonder Nick had to
take care of Mom's funeral!

320
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:32,746
Shit, you couldn't even
come home for that!

321
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:41,407
I don't want to be
part of your family.

322
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:43,539
No, I just want to leave.

323
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,628
I'm gonna take my kid,

324
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:48,153
and I'm gonna
forget all about this place.

325
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:50,416
[speaking Tagalog]

326
00:53:41,174 --> 00:53:43,132
What do you mean you don't
know where Miss Amador is?

327
00:53:43,176 --> 00:53:44,960
You're her secretary right?

328
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,181
Well, I'm gonna talk
to you anyway.

329
00:53:48,921 --> 00:53:51,880
Look, Amador promised me this
girl'd be here 3 months ago,

330
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:53,578
she should be here by now.

331
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,840
She...

332
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,145
Yeah...

333
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:57,843
You don't understand...

334
00:53:58,757 --> 00:53:59,845
Look, I heard about agencies,

335
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:02,935
you take people's money, they
never hear from you again...

336
00:54:03,588 --> 00:54:04,110
Could you...?

337
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,287
Lady, is this the only phone
in New York, huh?

338
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,810
What?

339
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,726
Look, you'd better be telling
me, you don't understand.

340
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:14,947
I gave you every fuckin'
last penny I have...

341
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,079
Yeah, but you don't...

342
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:17,950
Hello?

343
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,343
Hello?

344
00:54:19,778 --> 00:54:20,605
Hello!

345
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:21,649
Fuck!

346
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,262
Go on, knock yourselves out!

00:54:28,439 --> 00:54:31,137
[Crowded bar noise.]

348
00:54:32,443 --> 00:54:34,314
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you...

349
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:38,449
Shipmate...

350
00:54:40,146 --> 00:54:42,801
Could you get another drink for
this girl, this guy, you, me,

351
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:44,150

when I'm going to
start sending them more money.

713

I thought we just
sent them money.

714

But that was over
three weeks ago.

you send them all the money,

924
01:46:43,179 --> 01:46:45,747

925

926
01:46:49,098 --> 01:46:51,709
My cousin, Tess,
must be worried by now.

927
01:46:51,753 --> 01:46:54,408
She was expecting me
at work tonight.

928
01:46:55,626 --> 01:46:58,020
What's this
with your cousin, Tess?

929
01:46:58,586 --> 01:47:01,893
Everything is Tess this,
and Tess that.

930
01:47:01,937 --> 01:47:03,895
Ever since your cousin got
involved,

931
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:05,984
the whole thing's fallen apart.

932
01:47:08,117 --> 01:47:09,466
Why don't you just...

933
01:47:22,871 --> 01:47:25,221
Why don't you just
take the money?

934
01:47:26,962 --> 01:47:28,746
And give it
to your cousin, Tess,

935
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:31,270
and her Howdy Doody
son-of-a-bitch boyfriend,

936
01:47:31,314 --> 01:47:32,924
and we'll be done with it.

937
01:47:32,968 --> 01:47:34,317
I'm sorry.

938
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,450
I can't take the money.
It's too late.

939
01:47:36,493 --> 01:47:40,149
There's nothing I can do now.
I have to work to pay them back.

940
01:47:40,497 --> 01:47:42,368
Why don't you just take
the goddamn money

941
01:47:42,412 --> 01:47:43,544
and pay them back?

942
01:47:44,632 --> 01:47:46,242
I can't take the money.
I want to work.

943
01:47:47,417 --> 01:47:48,331
Okay.

944
01:47:49,201 --> 01:47:50,986
Okay, you can work.

945
01:47:52,335 --> 01:47:54,772
And then you'll stay
here with me and

946
01:47:54,816 --> 01:47:57,340
we can use the money
to get married.

947
01:47:57,819 --> 01:48:02,650
I mean, it's not gonna be that
big wedding I promised you...

948
01:48:03,868 --> 01:48:07,829
I'm probably not gonna be able
to bring your parents over
but...

949
01:48:09,526 --> 01:48:12,660
But we can have
a nice, small affair.

950
01:48:13,095 --> 01:48:15,314
There ain't nothing wrong
with small, right?

951
01:48:15,358 --> 01:48:18,187
We can have a small, nice,
intimate affair.

952
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:19,841
And then, later on...

953
01:48:20,537 --> 01:48:23,235
We can have the wedding you
want.

954

What do you say?

955
01:48:26,195 --> 01:48:27,370
Your family doesn't want me
here.

956
01:48:28,763 --> 01:48:29,981
Forget about my sister,
forget about my cousin,

957
01:48:30,025 --> 01:48:30,939
forget about my family.

958
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:33,376
You're gonna be
living here with me.

959
01:48:33,594 --> 01:48:34,464
Here?

960
01:48:35,726 --> 01:48:37,032
Yeah. Where else?

961
01:48:37,293 --> 01:48:40,209
But you're not even supposed
to be living here.

962
01:48:40,252 --> 01:48:42,385
I already explained that to you.

963
01:48:44,605 --> 01:48:47,390
Are you trying
to tell me something?

964
01:48:49,435 --> 01:48:51,481
Can we just be friends?

965
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,918
What do you mean "friends"?

966
01:48:54,702 --> 01:48:57,052
I just want to be your friend.

967
01:49:02,274 --> 01:49:03,493
I have to go.

968
01:49:11,283 --> 01:49:13,242

My cousin, Tess,
must be worried by now.

972

Fuck Tess!

973
01:49:37,092 --> 01:49:38,267

976

twenty years of my life,
running away,

977
01:50:43,158 --> 01:50:45,290
drifting around the world...

978
01:50:49,077 --> 01:50:52,167
Being everywhere except where
I should have been.

979
01:50:55,213 --> 01:50:58,564
And now what you see here
is all I have left.

980
01:51:02,351 --> 01:51:06,224
It never meant anything to me,
but now it means so much.

981
01:51:10,881 --> 01:51:12,666
So I decided to stay.

982
01:51:18,759 --> 01:51:22,197
And I'm this far away,
this fucking far away...

983
01:51:22,458 --> 01:51:24,155
from losing my home,

984
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:25,983
my family's gone,
my parents are gone,

985
01:51:26,027 --> 01:51:28,203

to do with me!

by a thread.

and now,

989

you tell me that
you're gonna leave me?

990

I mean...

991
01:51:40,650 --> 01:51:42,304
Was I stupid?

992
01:51:42,739 --> 01:51:46,395
Was I stupid to think that
I could find my way back home?

993
01:52:04,674 --> 01:52:06,328
Don't leave me.

994
01:52:08,765 --> 01:52:10,158
Marry me.

995
01:52:12,247 --> 01:52:13,509
I can't.

996
01:52:15,685 --> 01:52:17,861
What do you mean you can't?

997
01:52:17,905 --> 01:52:19,733

998
