1
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,345
Heck, I'm awake.

2
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:06,146
I'm awake.

3
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,781
What are you doing?

4
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,649
[Inaudible]

5
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:09,450
Come here.

6
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,696
Good morning.

7
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,163
They are good mornings
waking up with you.

8
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,008
Kampo, let's play a game.

9
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:41,809
What kind of game?

10
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:46,947
I'll ask a question.

11
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:48,382
And you answer.

12
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:49,383
Oh, what do you want to know?

13
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:52,486
Tell me about your friends.

14
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,124
Oh, well, I don't have
that many friends other

15
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,292
Than the guys on the swim team.

16
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:01,895
But I don't hang out
with them all the time.

17
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,196
Next question.

18
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:03,997
OK.

19
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,667
How about your family?

20
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,368
You do have a family, don't you?

21
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,308
Kampo?

22
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,578
Tell me about your family.

23
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:20,180
I have a brother named Jett.

24
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,382
Well, that's a start.

25
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,718
Tell me about Jett.

26
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:29,389
Well, he's older than
I am, bigger than I am.

27
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,926
And he works and lives
in Washington, DC.

28
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:33,727
Washington?

29
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,829
Oh, I love Washington.

30
00:06:35,929 --> 00:06:40,434
Cherry blossoms in the
spring there are beautiful.

31
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,401
I wouldn't know.

32
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,269
I've been there.

33
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,637
What about your... your parents?

34
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,905
Where do they live?

35
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,808
My parents are dead, Jessie.

36
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,478
I'm sorry.

37
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:53,346
I don't like to talk about it.

38
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,749
Sometimes it helps
to talk about it.

39
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,217
Yeah, I know.

40
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,821
Remember, I'm the psych major.

41
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,990
It's just I never had
anyone I felt close

42
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,291
Enough to to talk to about it.

43
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,828
What about Jett?

44
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,764
There's just certain
things we can't talk about.

45
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,432
Well, how long has it
been since you've seen him?

46
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,837
Six months.

47
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,573
I mean, it's not like he
doesn't care about me.

48
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,809
Jett's been paying
for my college.

49
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:25,045
He's been taking care of me
ever since our parents died.

50
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:28,949
How old were you
when it happened?

51
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,918
12 years old.

52
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:31,919
Oh, so young.

53
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,222
[Scream]

54
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,423
WOMAN: (SHOUTING) Oh my god.

55
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,224
You asshole.

56
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,226
I can't believe you.

57
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,728
Aw, man.

58
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,195
Call an ambulance.

59
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,697
No, I don't know what to do.

60
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:24,898
What am I supposed to do?

61
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:25,699
You hit him.

62
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:36,109
And I'll be at the
library until about 6:00.

63
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:37,510
And we're still on
for dinner, aren't we?

64
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,445
Yes.

65
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,579
Now, let's go.

66
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,014
I have to make a quick
stop before I drop you

67
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:42,349
Off at your class, all right?

68
00:09:58,999 --> 00:09:59,733
Agents.

69
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,001
Back away from the body, please.

70
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:01,669
Hey, look, it
wasn't my fault, man.

71
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:02,435
He just ran out, OK?

72
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,236
WOMAN: Oh my goodness.

73
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,188
Hector's dead.

74
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:21,989
Yeah.

75
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,023
We found the postcard.

76
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,826
But there's no luck
locating the key.

77
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:26,626
Yes, I understand.

78
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,986
Good evening.

79
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,088
Topping this evening's
news at 6 o'clock

80
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,759
Is the death of Hector Ramirez,
brother of reputed drug lord,

81
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,527
Manuel Ramirez.

82
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,730
It happened this morning
shortly after 10 o'clock

83
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,597
At the First Federal Bank.

84
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,168
That must be what we saw
this morning at the bank.

85
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,871
Manuel Ramirez, the
bearded drug czar

86
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,572
Heads a powerful cartel.

87
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,408
He is on the run from the
DEA, and believed to be hiding

88
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,676
Somewhere in South America.

89
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,813
Federal authorities are hopeful
that recent developments

90
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,214
May flush Ramirez out.

91
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:34,661
I take it you're not the maid.

92
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,898
Don't those do not disturb
signs mean anything anymore?

93
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,971
Hey, whatever it is
you're looking for,

94
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm fairly certain
it's not on me.

95
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,344
You're really in on position
to play games with me.

96
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,579
Well, why don't you untie me?

97
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,613
We can try a new position.

98
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,155
If anyone's going to get
poked, it's going to be you.

99
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:25,645
Now, just what should
I blow off first?

100
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,950
Ah, I know what.

101
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,624
It that how I taught
you to tie a square knot?

102
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,164
Oh, goddammit, Jett.

103
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:18,565
You always do this.

104
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,466
It's not fair.

105
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:20,267
You cheat.

106
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,903
I don't cheat.

107
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,204
I'm just a better
player than you.

108
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,172
That's all.
Oh yeah?

109
00:13:25,272 --> 00:13:26,273
Well, then play
with yourself then.

110
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,542
Jett, no.

111
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,313
No, Jett.

112
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,216
No.

113
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:39,752
Yes.

114
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:40,553
[Moaning]

115
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,354
Yes.

116
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,491
Yes.

117
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,324
Oh, god.

118
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,125
Oh.

119
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,127
What's wrong?

120
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:20,928
What are you?

121
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,062
An amphibian?

122
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,232
I mean, I gotta come up
for air once in a while.

123
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:28,335
Well, Jett used to say I
was a fish in my past life,

124
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:32,940
Because I can hold my breath
underwater almost four minutes.

125
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,341
Four minutes?

126
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,476
Come on, nobody can hold
their breath for four minutes.

127
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:38,145
What about those guys
that dive for pearls.

128
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,179
It just takes practice.

129
00:14:41,781 --> 00:14:43,616
All right, I can see
you don't believe me.

130
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,484
[Laughs]

131
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,253
How about a little bet then?

132
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,054
A bet?

133
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,388
For what?

134
00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:49,189
What else?

135
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,229
Food, my second favorite
pleasure in life.

136
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:04,137
When I win, you will cook dinner
for me for an entire month.

137
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,773
In the unlikely event
that... excuse me,

138
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,077
The highly unlikely
event that you win,

139
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,645
I will cook dinner
for you for a month.

140
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,446
Cook?

141
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,248
Mhm.

142
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,250
Wait a minute.

143
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,221
When I win pizza...

144
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,189
[Coughs]

145
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,757
Pizza does not count as dinner.

146
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,930
OK.

147
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,299
Let's do it.

148
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,100
OK.

149
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:45,545
On you mark, get set, go.

150
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,226
Make all the
necessary arrangements.

151
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,560
I'll go personally this time.

152
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,361
Boos, please.

153
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,862
You have to wait six months.

154
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,164
Silencio.

155
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,965
I cannot wait
another six months.

156
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,567
And I will tolerate
no other mistakes.

157
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,368
Vamanos.

158
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,883
56, 57, 58.

159
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,819
Call me [inaudible].

160
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,254
Yes!

161
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,157
Yes!

162
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:38,858
How do you do that?

163
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,262
Oh, it's like learning
how to ride a bike.

164
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,796
Once you learn,
you never forget.

165
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,597
Mm.

166
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,371
You're going to have time
to practice your knots.

167
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,773
I have to go under for a while.

168
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:55,508
Do some hotel hopping.

169
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,309
Good.

170
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,577
I could use some new towels.

171
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,016
Talk about the check
is in the mail.

172
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:05,118
It's hard to
believe this thing's

173
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:06,453
Worth a bazillion bucks.

174
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:08,621
Oh, just the stamps are.

175
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:10,223
They're not worth
quite a bazillion.

176
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,491
But you're not that far off.

177
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:15,362
But, uh, this thing is a
key to Ramirez' future.

178
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:20,600
The word around the office
that Ramirez wants it back.

179
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,734
The boss thinks
he's going to come

180
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,002
And try and get it himself.

181
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,137
Duh, now.

182
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,805
Our brilliant bosses are
the ones who delivered

183
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,207
This thing this morning to me.

184
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:28,007
No.

185
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,075
No, really... personally.

186
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:29,876
You're kidding.

187
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:30,977
Nope.

188
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,579
They want me to try
and use this for bait

189
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:35,047
To try and trap him with it.

190
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,184
Well, that's going to put a
crimp in our plans, isn't it?

191
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,485
Oh, does it?

192
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,187
Well, yeah.

193
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,522
Ramirez was going to give
the postcard back anyway

194
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,924
Once... once you got him
safely out of the country.

195
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,226
If the agency knows
you have it, you're

196
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,294
Going to have to give it back.

197
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,296
It's state's evidence.

198
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:50,096
OK.

199
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:50,930
I'll give it back.

200
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,100
Like hell you will.

201
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:58,305
This is our ticket out
of the civil services.

202
00:18:58,405 --> 00:19:02,775
Sweetheart, how long you've
been in the espionage business?

203
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,911
I mean, you're overlooking
one of our most

204
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,079
Time honored traditions.

205
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,715
And what's that?

206
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,516
The double-cross.

207
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,723
See, I will use this
postcard as bait.

208
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,291
As the loyal
agent that you are.

209
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,828
And I will accept this
postcard as payment

210
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,697
For helping that
drug pushing amigo

211
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:30,603
To cruise on past customs, with
his delightful nontraceable

212
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:31,804
Funds.

213
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,874
As the disloyal scoundrel
you turned out to be.

214
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,711
Only see, Ramirez won't
quite make it to the airport.

215
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,012
- He won't?
- Nope.

216
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:40,980
He has a tragic accident.

217
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,982
Aw.

218
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:45,017
I'll send flowers, and a card.

219
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,388
And all of his nontraceable
funds, they disappear.

220
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,590
Without a trace.

221
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,726
And our agency, well, they
get back to their precious four

222
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,528
Curtiss Jenny stamps.

223
00:19:55,628 --> 00:20:00,166
And we walk with
$64, give or take.

224
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,734
Take.

225
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,535
Always take.

226
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,360
Speak.

227
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,628
All the arrangement
have been made.

228
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,531
We leave for Los
Angeles within the hour.

229
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,310
Leave me.

230
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:21,608
[Inaudible] How can I say?

231
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:22,409
Classic.

232
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:29,882
First off, [inaudible]

233
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,720
Just your being here
tells me that you're

234
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,855
Mixed up in this some what.

235
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,690
Come on, Sal, you still
bitter about that Iran deal?

236
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,091
Look, look here.

237
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,860
I getting my fingers broken for
doing favors for your people.

238
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,996
It's not the way I
usually do business.

239
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,999
[Inaudible]

240
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:47,934
Yes.

241
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,102
But pain lingers on.

242
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,839
So tell me, what is cut?

243
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,707
And what assurances
do I have that

244
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,375
I will not end up with
Colombian necktie.

245
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,711
Hey, every job has certain
risk and a price to pay.

246
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,480
I am only interested in cut.

247
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,514
What is it?

248
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:03,550
And what do I have
to give you for it?

249
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:04,884
How about you
give me some names.

250
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:05,685
And I'll give you one.

251
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:06,919
It's simple.

252
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:07,954
What name is that.

253
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,924
Like Curtiss Jenny.

254
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,729
Oh.

255
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,298
Easy, easy, easy.

256
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,702
For you, 25% to do
with as please, Sal.

257
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:25,137
But it's going to cost
you plenty of names.

258
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,173
And as far as reinsurance,
Ramirez is going to lose

259
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:29,476
It at all in one fell swoop.

260
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:33,045
Default on his debts to
his associates, and zap.

261
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,148
He owes that much, yeah?

262
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,718
Fighting a drug war
these days is expensive.

263
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,887
When Ramirez's buddy
Noriega got pinched,

264
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:44,023
He panicked, made mistakes.

265
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:46,025
He got messy.

266
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,827
So we checkmated him.

267
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,829
He not only lost face
with his drug buddies,

268
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,931
But he pissed a whole
bunch of them off.

269
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:54,333
So now he's hiding out
down in South America.

270
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,469
And he sends his brother
up here to some bidding.

271
00:23:56,569 --> 00:23:57,637
He gets killed.

272
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:59,405
You getting the picture?

273
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:00,206
Oh, yes.

274
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:01,508
I get picture.

275
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:05,044
So I will bring
you list tonight.

276
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:06,913
Then I can assume
we have a deal.

277
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,315
No, until I get paid,
you can assume nothing.

278
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,086
OK.

279
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:15,087
Then tonight at 7:00...

280
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,689
No, no, no.

281
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,090
What do you mean, no?

282
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,458
I will set place for meeting.

283
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,061
All right.

284
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,630
Where?

285
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,166
Well, it seems to me I
remember you like movies

286
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,768
About [inaudible] fancy beach.

287
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,141
Get on with it.

288
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:38,044
You know where is old
theater on Birchwood?

289
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:41,047
Yeah.

290
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,116
I know where that is.

291
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,986
There is double feature.

292
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,254
I will bring the popcorn.

293
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,877
If a man truly loves a woman,
he will never leave her.

294
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,046
But you must have a tree.

295
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,380
For you man must lead the hunt...

296
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,181
You know what all this
salt's going to do

297
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,316
To your blood pressure, Sal?

298
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,517
WOMAN 1 (IN MOVIE): Or
you should go hungry.

299
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:52,885
WOMAN 2 (IN MOVIE): You
two speak with idle words.

300
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,221
If I had a man like Duran,
he could leave for years,

301
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:56,022
[Spits]

302
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:58,625
And I would wait for him.

303
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:01,628
WOMAN 1 (IN MOVIE): But you
do not have him, do you?

304
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,462
Only Lystra has
that good fortune.

305
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,370
[Grunting]

306
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:26,518
Hey come on, Harold.

307
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,020
Cut the crap, huh?

308
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,422
Someone else had to know
about my meeting with Kerovac.

309
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,059
Yeah, he was a good contact.

310
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:35,127
HAROLD (ON PHONE): Look,
I'm sorry about Kerovac.

311
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:38,497
But as far as we're concerned,
there's nothing to worry about.

312
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,365
Nothing?

313
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,299
Nothing?

314
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,434
That could have
been me, asshole.

315
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,235
HAROLD (ON PHONE): Right.

316
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,436
But it wasn't.

317
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,304
So relax.

318
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,138
Trust me.

319
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,407
I have some good news for you.

320
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,608
It's going to cheer you up.

321
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,376
Yeah?

322
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,478
What kind of news?

323
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,815
HAROLD (ON PHONE): The Ram
man, he's making his move.

324
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:56,916
What, Ramirez?

325
00:26:57,016 --> 00:26:58,017
HAROLD (ON PHONE): Yeah.

326
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,219
We got the word that
he's on his way to LA.

327
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,191
From who?

328
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:07,193
HAROLD (ON PHONE): A
very reliable source.

329
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,896
Do you still have the postcard?

330
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:10,697
Yeah.

331
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,564
It's right here with me.

332
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,666
HAROLD (ON PHONE):
That's my boy.

333
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:15,668
I'll be in touch with you.

334
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:16,669
And Jett...

335
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,670
Yeah.

336
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,140
HAROLD (ON PHONE): Try and relax

337
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:30,616
[Grunting]

338
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,745
That'll do it.

339
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,648
No more piano
concerts for a while.

340
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,449
You'll survive.

341
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,785
Oh, Jesus Christ.

342
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:15,788
Jesus frigging Christ.

343
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:16,755
You OK, Jett?

344
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,925
Yeah, I'm fine.

345
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:19,926
Can you move it?

346
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,828
I said I'm fine.

347
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,996
Just a flesh wound then, huh?

348
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,933
You know, I should
kick your ass.

349
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,536
Sweetheart, you, uh,
think you can find some bed

350
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:32,839
Pans that need emptying.

351
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,541
I think it's a
good time to look.

352
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,877
I think it's a good time
for you to get that groin

353
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:38,978
Pull looked at, you know?

354
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:44,616
All right, Harold.

355
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,218
Level with me.

356
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,187
We've been in LA for
less than 24 hours.

357
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,322
And somebody already
tried to take my head off.

358
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:51,590
Well, it's the freeways, Jett.

359
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,959
They bring out the
worst in people.

360
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:02,268
All right, Jett.

361
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:05,437
Couple of minor details
we've been holding back on.

362
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,338
Oh, that's great.

363
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,673
That's great.

364
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,541
Holding back information breaks
our basic trust, partner.

365
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,877
So why don't you try
talking to me, huh?

366
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,279
All right, before you go
getting off on the high horse

367
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,281
Here, let me give you
my reasons why, OK?

368
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:16,082
Yeah.

369
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,283
Well, I'm listening.

370
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,418
Now, we had to wait for
Ramirez to make his move.

371
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:20,452
And he made his move.

372
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,154
That still doesn't
answer my question.

373
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,890
He wants to set the
meeting up with you.

374
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,756
Why me?

375
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:26,358
Because this is
your deal, Jett.

376
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:27,894
Remember, you set this up.

377
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,030
All right.
All right.

378
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,431
Who else knows
about this meeting?

379
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,832
- Just you and me, pal.
- Just you and me?

380
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:34,800
- That's what I said.
- Good.

381
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,002
You just keep it
that way, all right?

382
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:36,802
Fine.

383
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:45,377
Now, I think I should be
there as backup, just in case.

384
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,378
In case of what?

385
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,679
What, are you
expected more trouble?

386
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,115
No, I just thought, well,
with the hand, what happened

387
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,116
At the hotel, you might need...

388
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,383
No, I'll be fine.

389
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,584
You just set up the meeting.

390
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,053
OK?

391
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,588
Sure.

392
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,592
It'll probably be soon,
and someplace local.

393
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,496
Shit.

394
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,834
Where you gonna be?

395
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:12,471
Someplace safe... neutral.

396
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,739
I'll contact you.

397
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:18,444
Whatever you say, partner.

398
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:23,682
Fuck.

399
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:24,683
Rest the hand, Jett.

400
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,330
What are you doing here?

401
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,035
This is not a social affair.

402
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:18,070
I have important
business to attend to.

403
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,046
What kind of business?

404
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:28,747
Matters that don't concern you.

405
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:32,985
Are you sure?

406
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:39,591
What's the matter, baby?

407
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:42,361
You don't mix business
with pleasure anymore?

408
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,245
MAN (ON PHONE):
Kampo, are you there?

409
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,879
Call me when you get in.

410
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,315
About last night, I'm sorry.

411
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:04,616
Beep.

412
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:05,784
Hi, it's me.

413
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,053
Call me.

414
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,421
Beep.

415
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,222
Beep.

416
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,923
Beep.

417
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,859
Where were you when
your parents died?

418
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:24,503
Forget I even asked that.

419
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:26,004
It's none of my business.

420
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:32,978
At home.

421
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,618
I was in trouble for getting
bad grades on my report card.

422
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,153
So my parents took away
the thing that meant

423
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:42,488
The most to me at the time.

424
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,923
Swimming?

425
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,293
Not only that, they
also grounded me

426
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:50,262
From using our backyard pool.

427
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,197
I was so upset.

428
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:58,070
That night, my parents
went to a dinner party,

429
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,471
Leaving Jett in charge.

430
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:00,272
What a break?

431
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,073
I thought.

432
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,174
One more swim.

433
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:05,811
So after they left,
I got ready to go in.

434
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,347
And just as I was about
to dive into the pool,

435
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:11,083
Jett comes out of the house and
says, get away from the pool...

436
00:34:11,183 --> 00:34:12,851
Just like a big brother.

437
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:15,454
So what'd you do?

438
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,655
What little brothers do best.

439
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:17,723
I pissed him off.

440
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,461
That wasn't a good idea.

441
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:23,262
Why?

442
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:24,663
What happened?

443
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,465
He chased after me.

444
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,668
We went around and around
the edge of the pool.

445
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:30,802
He almost got me.

446
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:36,275
And suddenly, he slipped
and fell into the water.

447
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,743
What happened next?

448
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,716
Nothing.

449
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:49,221
See, Jett had hit his head
on the edge of the pool.

450
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,757
And he was lying
there at the bottom.

451
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:53,225
Did you know he was in trouble?

452
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,694
Yeah, he wasn't moving.

453
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,598
I had to dive in
and bring him up.

454
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,900
He started splitting up water.

455
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,536
That's a good sign.

456
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,471
So he was OK.

457
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,338
You saved him.

458
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,840
Yeah, he was OK.

459
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,809
I still called emergency.

460
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:13,579
And they notified my parents and
sent an ambulance to the house.

461
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,250
So you called emergency.

462
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,117
Thank God.

463
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:22,087
Thank God for what?

464
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,423
My parents ran that red
light, and were killed rushing

465
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:28,194
Home to see how Jett was.

466
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:31,363
They died instantly, never
knowing that Jett was OK,

467
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,031
And that I was the
cause of everything.

468
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,606
[Phone ringing]

469
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:41,873
Hello.

470
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,513
Hello?

471
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,380
Jessie, is that you?

473
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,621
Hello!

[Knocking]

476
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,296
Who is it?

477
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,764
It's me, Jessica.

478
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,343
Can I come in?

479
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:18,143
Sure.

480
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:23,582
I've been trying
to call you all day.

481
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,583
I left messages.

482
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,584
I just got home.

483
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,360
What is it?

484
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,427
Term paper time?

485
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,862
Yeah, I got three of
them this semester.

486
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:43,802
Need any help?

487
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,771
Can you type?

488
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,639
70 words a minute.

489
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,642
Whoa, that's 60
more than I can type.

490
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:51,443
You're hired.

491
00:36:56,782 --> 00:36:58,684
Listen, about last night.

492
00:36:58,784 --> 00:37:02,654
Please, Jessie, just forget it.

493
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:03,722
No, I never would have...

494
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,156
Can we drop the subject
right now, please?

495
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:12,964
Look, Jessie, I'm
not pissed at you.

496
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,232
I wasn't last night either.

497
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:20,606
It's just that what I told
you is something I never told

498
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:21,940
Anyone before, not even Jett.

499
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,447
I'm glad you could talk to me.

500
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:33,852
Look, for what it's worth,
I really did feel a lot

501
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,588
Better last night after I left.

502
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,358
I'm glad.

503
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,659
I've never been that
good with letting

504
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,895
People get inside my head.

505
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,398
That's why I had to go.

506
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,866
I just needed to be
alone for a little while.

507
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,838
I understand.

508
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:53,772
Thanks, Jessie.

509
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:57,576
Come here.

510
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,818
Listen, you worthless
piece of shift.

511
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,154
I'm risking everything
by just being here.

512
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:10,322
I haven't the time
or the patience

513
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,690
To deal with your
stupid little problems.

514
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,594
No, hombre.

515
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:16,595
I can afford to wait no longer.

516
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,267
Just do it.

517
00:38:22,368 --> 00:38:25,704
Set the meeting for tonight
and leave the rest to me.

Did you locate him?

520
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,843
Yes.

521
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:32,644
Good.

522
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:33,445
Very good.

Excellent.

525
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,290
Excellent.

(WHISPERING) Kampo, wake up.

Go back to sleep.

00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:16,888
- Wake up.
- What is it, Jessie?

530
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:17,723
Shh.

531
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:19,658
There's somebody in your room.

532
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:22,127
Turn on the light.

533
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,630
I probably won't be able
to find anything anyways.

Who is it?

00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:35,907
I have a gun.

Yeah, you and I know that.

540

But the burglar doesn't.

541
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,947
You don't have a gun.

542
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,482
In fact, you never even fired
one before, you little pussy.

to greet your brother?

Oh, hey, man.
I'm sorry.

weird way of saying hello.

549
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,368
How long you been in LA?

550
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,436
Two days.

551
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,037
I tried to contact you earlier.

552
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:07,005
Was that you on the phone?

553
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:07,806
No, I didn't call.

554
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,274
I stopped by at school.

555
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:10,776
You didn't call my machine?

556
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:11,710
No.

557
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,579
I didn't call your
machine or you.

558
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,246
Why?

559
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:17,148
Well, it's... it's
probably nothing.

560
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,886
I've just been getting some
weird phone calls, that's all.

561
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:21,687
Oh, really?

562
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,689
How so?

563
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,256
Well, like, somebody
calls my machine.

564
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:29,394
And then they hang up
as soon as I pick it up.

565
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,329
When did this start?

566
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,263
Just this afternoon.

567
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,970
[Clears throat]

568
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,405
Oh, I'm sorry.

569
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:43,008
Jess... uh, Jett, this
is Jessica Roberts.

570
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,843
Jessie, this is
my brother, Jett.

571
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,644
JESSICA: Hi.

572
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:46,444
How you doing?

573
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:47,345
Nice meeting you.

574
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,114
Nice to meet you.

575
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,617
Hey, listen, how about
a toast, you guys?

576
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:55,754
You, uh, do have glasses
in this pit of yours.

577
00:40:58,323 --> 00:40:59,057
Yeah.

578
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:00,258
Can't guarantee they're clean.

579
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,059
Hey, man.

580
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,028
What's that on your tie?

581
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,230
Can't expect miracles, huh?

582
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,265
Kampo tells me you live in DC.

583
00:41:07,365 --> 00:41:08,199
Yeah.

584
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,235
What else did he
tell you about me?

585
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:12,203
That you're a
successful businessman.

586
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,505
Ha.

587
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,740
- Here you go.
- Ooh, hey.

588
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,774
These are nice.

589
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:16,708
Just for you, babe.

590
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,182
Ladies first here, huh?

591
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:28,687
Beauty before age.

592
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,029
To life.

593
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:46,004
[Burp] Good year.

594
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,138
You're a pig, man.

595
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:50,709
I see you still practice
those good manners, huh?

596
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,645
He taught me everything I know.

597
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,146
So what kind of
business are you in?

598
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,485
Personal finance and
business speculations.

599
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:01,286
Why?

600
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,689
Just curious.

601
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:05,691
Will you join us
for dinner tonight?

602
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,526
Hey, look, I was going to
treat the two of you, you know,

603
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:10,796
For scaring the crap
out of you earlier.

604
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:13,264
No, I insist.

605
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,766
See, she really hates to cook.

606
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,002
But we made a bet, and she lost.

607
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:20,038
And now she has to
cook for a whole month.

608
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:22,874
I won't even ask
what the bet was over.

609
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,309
So you'll come?

610
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,177
7 o'clock sharp?

611
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,012
Do I have a choice?

612
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:27,813
No.

613
00:42:30,616 --> 00:42:32,150
Sounds like she means business.

614
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,752
She does.

615
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:34,552
OK, then.

616
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:37,723
I guess I better be on time.

617
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:38,523
Yeah, OK.

618
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:39,858
Good.

619
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,359
Now give me full details when
I see you this afternoon.

620
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,029
Yeah, it's at Westside
Fencing Center.

621
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:44,830
OK.

622
00:42:57,843 --> 00:42:59,778
Hey, put that thing out, man.

623
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:01,847
Ah, dammit, dammit, dammit.

624
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,448
You clown.

625
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:05,116
What happened to your hand?

626
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,885
I've been meaning to ask
you since last night.

627
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,353
Got slammed in a car door.

628
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,155
That's smart.

629
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,123
When did Jessie leave?

630
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,793
About an hour ago.

631
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:15,627
What time is it now?

632
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,028
It's almost 8 o'clock.

633
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:18,096
Shit.

634
00:43:18,196 --> 00:43:20,398
I'm late for class.

635
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:21,499
Hey, Kampo.

636
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,168
Yeah?

637
00:43:23,268 --> 00:43:24,636
I like Jessica, man.

638
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,437
She's full of fire.

639
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,674
How long you two been going out?

640
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:30,208
Two weeks.

641
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,509
Ooh, two weeks, huh?

642
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,011
That's a new record for you.

643
00:43:35,847 --> 00:43:36,682
Yeah.

644
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:37,916
She's quite a woman.

645
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:40,451
I won't argue with that.

646
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,319
She hates businessmen.

647
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,591
Hey, Jett.

648
00:43:46,692 --> 00:43:49,394
Yeah?

649
00:43:49,494 --> 00:43:50,395
I told her about Mom and Dad.

650
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:02,708
Hey, Kampo, here's
something to hold you over

651
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:04,109
For the next couple
of months, man.

652
00:44:08,714 --> 00:44:09,414
Thanks Jett.

653
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:10,215
You butthead.

654
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,255
Glad you're here.

655
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,457
Looking good, Kampo.

656
00:44:19,557 --> 00:44:23,594
Hey, now get to cl...
Now get to class,

657
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:25,296
Man, before they drop you.

658
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,097
[Phone ringing]

659
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:28,934
Hey, butthead.

660
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,401
Could you get that phone?

661
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,374
Hello

662
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:41,780
Who was it?

663
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,613
Jessie?

664
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:44,082
Nah, it was the wrong number.

665
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,183
Hey, don't forget
about tonight.

666
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,852
Right.
7 o'clock sharp, huh?

667
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:48,987
I left the directions
to Jessica's house

668
00:44:49,087 --> 00:44:51,322
By that notepad
their on the phone.

669
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,190
All right?

670
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,759
See you later.

671
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:54,559
All right, man.

672
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:55,360
Take care.

673
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:04,229
With the other three
fingers providing

674
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,464
The control of the tip.

675
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,567
If you grip too tightly, then
you lose that point mobility.

676
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:11,736
And if you don't grip
tightly enough, then... well,

677
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:12,737
You get disarmed.

678
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,328
Hope you're not
thinking about turning

679
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,764
In your service revolver
for one of those things.

680
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,272
Hand's looking better.

681
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,878
Too bad I can't say the
same thing about you.

682
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,449
Jett, you light up my life.

683
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,250
You know that?

684
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:04,155
So what's up?

685
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:07,092
The Ram man, he
wants the meeting

686
00:47:07,192 --> 00:47:10,896
Tonight, Jones construction
site by the water tower.

687
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:12,163
Yeah, I know where that's at.

688
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:14,732
Figured you did.

689
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,801
Could have told me this morning
over the phone, you know?

690
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:19,037
I'm missing a hell
of a ballgame.

691
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,473
No, the line was bugged.

692
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:23,341
Ramirez?

693
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:26,144
Probably.

694
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,914
That oily bastard.

695
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:31,182
How'd he get a line on you?

696
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:34,719
You were supposed to
be someplace neutral.

697
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:35,520
Don't know.

698
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,122
I'll find out tonight.

699
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:39,457
I still think I should
come along as backup.

700
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,225
No.

701
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:41,292
I'll be fine.

702
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:42,627
Ramirez won't fuck with me.

703
00:47:42,727 --> 00:47:45,997
Remember, I got the
ace in the hole.

704
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,499
Yeah, well,
speaking of the ace,

705
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:51,502
I hope you got it
up your sleeve.

706
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:54,339
It's safe.

707
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:58,276
He may ask to see it.

708
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,377
Don't worry about it.

709
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:02,147
You'll still get your cut.

710
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,449
It's just that I
told Ramirez you'd

711
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:09,921
Show him the postcard
tonight as good faith.

712
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:11,756
You know, why
would Ramirez care

713
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:12,890
So much about this postcard?

714
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:15,826
I mean, it's no
big thing to him.

715
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:18,829
Well, it seems Juan
Valdez is a little edgy

716
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:23,501
Since his brother ate all
that chrome at the bank.

717
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,737
Unless you and him know
something that I don't.

718
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:33,611
Well now, Jett, that would
break our basic trust,

719
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:35,546
Wouldn't it?

720
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:40,218
Besides, like you
said, why would I

721
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:41,652
Risk my share of the cut?

722
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,691
Because you're a
greedy man, Harold.

723
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,598
And you got no balls.

724
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:57,335
Touche, Jethro.

725
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,206
Touche.

726
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:53,358
Why do you stand
so far away from me?

727
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,425
Ven aqui, mi amigo.

728
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:55,593
Come closer, my friend.

729
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:04,135
Are we on schedule?

730
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,704
There was a few minor setbacks.

731
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:08,339
May I assume that
you have taken

732
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,575
Care of these minor setbacks?

733
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:11,376
Yeah.

734
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:13,611
While all the artillery?

735
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,080
Protection.

736
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,148
One never knows who
his friends and enemies

737
00:50:17,248 --> 00:50:19,350
Are in this crazy business.

738
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,151
Are you my friend?

739
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,324
Friends don't bite the
hands that feed them.

740
00:50:26,424 --> 00:50:27,458
Lay off my brother.

741
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,560
I know nothing of your brother.

742
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,329
So he tapped his
own phone, huh?

743
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,797
And Kerovac, he
slit his own throat?

744
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:36,033
Not to mention the fucked
up attempt on my life.

745
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,603
If I had wanted you dead,
you would not be here

746
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,305
Now insulting my friendships.

747
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,573
And as for Kerovac, he's
a fool, and unworthy

748
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:43,774
Of my consideration.

749
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,176
And my brother's phone?

750
00:50:45,276 --> 00:50:46,444
Yes.

751
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,846
For that I am responsible.

752
00:50:48,946 --> 00:50:51,015
Why?

753
00:50:51,116 --> 00:50:52,383
McBain told me he
thought you might

754
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:53,418
Be staying with your brother.

755
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:54,352
Oh, fucking McBain.

756
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:56,354
And it is my life
that is in risk

757
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:57,455
By coming back to the States.

758
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,724
Do you understand?

759
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:01,492
Did you bring the postcard?

760
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:04,129
I'd like to see it.

761
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,164
No.

762
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,099
But it's safe.

763
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,569
You've got to remember, I hold
all the cards in this game.

764
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,771
And this whole thing
goes down on my word,

765
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,641
And my word... [grunt]

766
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:12,297
He's not coming.

767
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:16,534
I could have told
you he'd be late.

768
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,270
We might as well
just get started.

769
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:22,407
If you're so hungry, eat.

770
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:24,008
Where are you going?

771
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:26,511
Home.

772
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,078
Kampo, I didn't
mean to upset you.

773
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:29,079
Yeah.

774
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,515
Well, somehow you
still managed to.

775
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:31,982
I mean, that's the
problem with you, Jessie.

776
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:35,085
You just don't think
sometimes before you speak.

777
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,655
When Jett tells me he's going
to be somewhere, he's there.

778
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:46,331
I just need to be alone
for a little while.

779
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,131
OK?

780
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,003
Yo, Weezy, get a
look at this guy.

781
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,740
Oh, man.

782
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,042
This guy's really messed up.

783
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,579
Looks like Fuzzy's boys
are painting the town.

784
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,116
Nah, Fuzzy does much
better work than this.

785
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,785
This guy's not even dead.

786
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,322
I mean, Fuzzy's
ruthless, but [inaudible]

787
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,791
[Garage door opening]

788
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:56,801
Why are my ears burning?

789
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:57,602
Fuzzy?

790
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:10,581
Ah, now, correct
me if I'm wrong.

791
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:14,552
But didn't we discuss the
relocation of your operation.

792
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:15,753
What did we say?

793
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:16,554
Taiwan?

794
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:38,376
Having trouble packing?

795
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:40,845
I'm not having trouble
packing anything.

796
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:41,846
I'm packing this.

797
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:49,153
Nice gun.

798
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,121
[Gunshot]

799
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:53,424
And it's loaded.

800
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:25,122
[Gunshots]

801
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,025
I thought you told me he would
be bringing me the postcard.

802
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:09,366
McBain, I believe he
might have talked.

803
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:11,268
WOMAN (ON PHONE): I don't
care what you believe.

804
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,670
I'll take care of it.

805
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,006
May be able to kill two
birds with one stone.

806
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:20,511
I hope so for your sake.

807
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:21,579
WOMAN (ON PHONE): Buenas noches.

808
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,026
No!

809
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,227
Jett!

810
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:38,028
Jett!

811
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,472
[Sobbing]

812
00:57:14,131 --> 00:57:14,832
No!

813
00:57:36,253 --> 00:57:36,954
Go ahead, take a sip.

814
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:38,756
It'll make you feel better.

815
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,124
The body's been taken care of.

816
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:40,925
Thank you.

817
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:42,126
That'll be all.

818
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:44,261
Officer Kersey, could
you come with me, please?

819
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:54,304
Put that down.

820
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,774
Just following
standard procedures.

821
00:57:56,874 --> 00:57:58,175
Why don't you just
leave me alone.

822
00:57:58,275 --> 00:57:59,443
My brother dies outside.

823
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:01,278
And you and your
people are up here

824
00:58:01,378 --> 00:58:05,950
Taking pictures, and snooping
around like I was guilty.

825
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,452
We know you had nothing to
do with your brother's murder.

826
00:58:08,553 --> 00:58:09,954
We just have to make
sure our investigation's

827
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:12,957
Thorough so we can find out who
killed your brother and why.

828
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:14,424
You can understand
that, can't you.

829
00:58:14,525 --> 00:58:16,961
I don't want to understand
anything right now.

830
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:20,898
Please, just a few
more questions.

831
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,266
Was your brother's
visit planned?

832
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,300
No.

833
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,935
None of his visits
where ever planned.

834
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:27,404
He traveled a lot for business.

835
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,940
Whenever he came to LA,
he'd stop in to see me.

836
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,375
Mhm.

837
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:34,144
And what can you
tell us about this?

838
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,447
I wrote that on the pad over
by the phone... directions

839
00:58:37,548 --> 00:58:39,483
To my girlfriend's house.

840
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:42,386
Jett was supposed to
come over for dinner.

841
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:43,187
Make a note of that.

842
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,928
That'll be enough
questions, Lieutenant Weller.

843
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,430
You and your people
are relieved.

844
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,966
You do the uniform justice.

845
00:58:56,066 --> 00:59:00,705
Oh, Weller, did you find
anything on the body?

846
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,309
Haven't heard the
Dodgers score, have you?

847
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:06,143
Sure.

848
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:08,412
It's four to four in the ninth.

849
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,615
Hell of the game.

850
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:11,415
Hell of a game.

851
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:12,316
Thanks for the cooperation.

852
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,158
I'm sorry about all this.

853
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:27,698
It's a damn freaking
lousy time to bother you.

854
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,701
Don't then.

855
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:31,602
I don't have a choice.

856
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:37,274
I worked with your brother.

857
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,475
He was my friend.

858
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,610
My brother was not a cop.

859
00:59:42,379 --> 00:59:43,447
I know.

860
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:46,717
I'm not a cop.

861
00:59:46,817 --> 00:59:49,687
I'm a federal agent,
just like Jett.

862
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:51,455
My brother was a businessman.

863
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:54,892
Kampo, I suggest you listened
to what I have to say.

864
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,061
Your life may be in danger.

865
00:59:57,161 --> 00:59:58,629
Who are you?

866
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:03,433
Name's McBain, Harold McBain.

867
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:05,770
Jett was my partner.

868
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:06,603
Look, I'm sorry.

869
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:07,404
It's just that...

870
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:08,806
That's all right.

871
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:12,442
Been a lousy day for me too.

872
01:00:12,542 --> 01:00:13,878
What am I supposed to do?

873
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:16,580
Right now, you can listen.

874
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:18,916
Your brother worked
for a special agency

875
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:23,020
Tucked away between the Treasury
Department and Foreign Affairs.

876
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,855
What does that have to do
with my brother's death.

877
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:28,525
Kampo, this just wasn't
another tuition visit.

878
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,796
Jett was in LA on assignment.

879
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:36,967
We'd like to use you, Kampo,
to get to Jett's killer.

880
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:37,935
Why would they want me?

881
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:38,936
I'm just a college student.

882
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,971
Well, Jett was staying
with you, right?

883
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:43,640
Now, whoever
killed him may think

884
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,142
That he told you something.

885
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:47,044
He didn't say a word to me.

886
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,879
Christ's sakes, I
didn't even know he

887
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,115
Was a federal agent until now.

888
01:00:51,215 --> 01:00:52,082
All right, Kampo.

889
01:00:52,182 --> 01:00:53,383
I know.

890
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:58,689
But just try and think, did
Jett say anything unusual?

891
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:01,625
No.

892
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:05,763
Did he... give you
anything to hold for him?

893
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:07,998
No, nothing.

894
01:01:08,098 --> 01:01:09,233
Anything, Kampo.

895
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,602
He didn't give me anything.

896
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,005
All right, Kampo.

897
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:17,875
It's been a long day.

898
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:21,178
I'll leave you alone.

899
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:24,248
Everything that I've told you
is pretty highly classified.

900
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:28,552
So don't repeat a
word to anyone, OK?

901
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:29,920
What about tonight?

902
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,890
My men will be
watching your apartment.

903
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,925
You'll be fine.

904
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,894
Why don't you get out of those
wet clothes, have a drunk,

905
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:40,064
And try and get some sleep.

906
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:43,133
I'll pick you up in the morning.

907
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:47,337
Here's a 24 hour number
you can reach me at.

908
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,705
Don't be afraid to use it.

909
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:51,375
Your tax dollars
are paying for it.

910
01:01:51,475 --> 01:01:54,745
The number spells out any time.

911
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:59,649
And Kampo, try and relax.

912
01:02:03,187 --> 01:02:04,088
You'll be fine.

913
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:15,132
Trust me.

914
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:49,699
Who's there?

915
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,304
Who are you?

916
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:55,105
Hey, what do you want?

917
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,256
Nice work.

918
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:16,660
Just in case your boss
decides I'm expendable.

919
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,229
To the warehouse, boys.

920
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:20,397
Andele.

921
01:03:20,497 --> 01:03:21,198
Andele.

922
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:56,000
[Whistling]

923
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,838
Relax, Kampo.

924
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:36,606
How do you know my name?

925
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:40,110
Tell me, what do you know?

926
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:40,911
About what?

927
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,679
What are you talking about?

928
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:44,281
Ah, truly you disappoint me.

929
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,551
I expected so much more
from Jett's little brother.

930
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:49,153
Really, I don't know
what you're talking about.

931
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:50,520
I'm just a college student.

932
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,688
Enjoy it.

933
01:04:51,788 --> 01:04:53,657
It is the last time in
your life that people

934
01:04:53,757 --> 01:04:55,192
Will expect nothing from you.

935
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:03,067
Unfortunately, I have not
the time or the patience.

936
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:04,668
Did you kill my brother?

937
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,437
Yes.

938
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:10,207
Dirty fucking scum!

939
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:12,676
You see how easy it is, Kampo?

940
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:15,812
You ask me a question, I
answer it... simplemente.

941
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:19,816
Now, once again, tell
me, what do you know?

942
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,685
Son of a bitch.

943
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:25,990
Oh, your brother,
he surprised me.

944
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:28,225
It took a great deal
of stamina and courage

945
01:05:28,325 --> 01:05:30,594
For him to make it back to you.

946
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,762
He must have wanted to tell
you something before he died.

947
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,731
I'll kill you.

948
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:38,002
Oh, the puppy growls.

949
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:40,637
You know, it is so interesting.

950
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,172
Right now, mi amigo,
you would do anything

951
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:42,973
You could to get me.

952
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:45,209
Es verdad?

953
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:47,844
Shortly, you will do anything
you can to get away from me.

954
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:53,650
Wait.

955
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,152
Wait.

956
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:56,120
Wait!

957
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,121
Wait!

958
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:58,122
What is this?

959
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,500
[Gasping]

960
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:25,015
Amazing how the body reacts to
a sudden change in temperature.

961
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,917
Quite draining, hm?

962
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:30,254
Kampo, spare yourself
this barbaric [inaudible].

963
01:06:30,354 --> 01:06:32,956
It is so distasteful.

964
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:33,757
Now, tell me.

965
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:36,260
What do you know?

966
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:37,761
Nothing.

967
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:40,897
You see, college, during
each time you do not answer

968
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,366
My question, I
will instruct them

969
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:43,600
To hold your head
under the water

970
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,237
For a longer period
of time until... well,

971
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,239
Until you pass out or drown.

972
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:56,213
Come on, scholar.

973
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:58,715
Being able to coax
answers from your mind

974
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:00,717
Is a student's greatest asset?

975
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:01,718
Hm?

976
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:03,687
Getting weaker?

977
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:06,190
Having a hard time seeing?

978
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,691
You're hearing is going.

979
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,193
Is that not correct?

980
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:10,260
Yes.

981
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,696
Ah, see, that is the
first correct answer

982
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:13,863
You have given me.

983
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:14,664
Now tell me.

984
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:16,666
What do you know?

985
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,168
Postcard.

986
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:20,670
Ah, excellent.

987
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,172
Excellent.

988
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,674
What about the postcard.

989
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:28,645
I don't know anything
about the postcard.

990
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:32,149
[Gasping]

991
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:07,083
Donde esta la tarjeta postal?

992
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,118
[Inaudible] Spanish.

993
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:09,186
La timbre postal.

994
01:08:09,286 --> 01:08:10,187
I don't speak...

995
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:11,788
La tienes bien cuidada?

996
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:12,956
- Speak Spanish.
- The postcard.

997
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:13,757
Where is it?

998
01:08:13,857 --> 01:08:14,558
Is it safe?

999
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:16,193
[Inaudible] Yes.

1000
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:21,665
I believe you.

1001
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:27,637
Get him out of my sight.

1002
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,768
Oh, those goddamn Mets.

1003
01:09:08,612 --> 01:09:10,013
Took you long enough.

1004
01:09:13,116 --> 01:09:15,018
What did he say?

1005
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,152
He knows nothing.

1006
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:16,953
Really?

1007
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,526
You call this nothing?

1008
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:43,980
Shit.

1009
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:58,094
He's gone.

1010
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,629
I told you not to
leave him alone.

1011
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,164
I only left him alone
for a couple of minutes.

1012
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:01,998
That's all.

1013
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:04,534
Long enough to let him escape.

1014
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,002
Well, check the property.

1015
01:10:06,102 --> 01:10:08,104
In his condition, he
could not have gone far.

1016
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:08,905
Now!

1017
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:18,081
Well, well, well.

1018
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:27,023
Ramirez family sure
is getting sloppy.

1019
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:29,359
Guess our climate
doesn't agree with you.

1020
01:10:32,929 --> 01:10:34,364
Sloppy?

1021
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:35,765
You asshole.

1022
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:37,434
I'd be out of the States
by now if you were taking

1023
01:10:37,534 --> 01:10:38,868
Care of business properly.

1024
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:42,005
Yeah, well just remember who
needs who for this little deal

1025
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:42,806
To work.

1026
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:49,245
What I need you do is to
take care of this kid once

1027
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,246
And for all.

1028
01:11:28,251 --> 01:11:30,219
After I get in the car,
I want you to follow us.

1029
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,788
Where are you going
to direct him to?

1030
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,523
Do as you're told
and follow us.

1031
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,392
And how are we
going to know where?

1032
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:38,261
[Inaudible] and listen.

1033
01:11:38,362 --> 01:11:40,364
I want you to fire in
the car a few months

1034
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:41,798
Miles away from the airport.

1035
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,266
I'll handle the rest.

1036
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:53,577
Jessie?

1037
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:57,046
Jessie?

1038
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:09,092
Relax, Kampo, she's fine.

1039
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:11,227
She's very fine.

1040
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,897
You were part of it all along.

1041
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:16,165
Why?

1042
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:17,000
I collect stamps.

1043
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:23,740
Well, almost 10 AM.

1044
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,775
Where does the time go, huh?

1045
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,777
What happens at 10 AM?

1046
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:29,212
I'll be a very wealthy man.

1047
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:33,383
And the two of you will be dead.

1048
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:37,654
Now I have to pick up
Senor Ramirez at the bank,

1049
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:40,990
And escort him to his airplane.

1050
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,860
Unfortunately, he'll be just as
accident-prone as his brother.

1051
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:56,205
Oh, speaking of brothers, Kampo,
tell Jett is was a sweet deal,

1052
01:12:56,305 --> 01:13:00,644
A very sweet deal.

1054
01:13:11,621 --> 01:13:13,490
Oh god.

1055
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:14,658
Are you all right?

1056
01:13:18,194 --> 01:13:20,063
Come on, we have to go.

1057
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:21,064
I have to get dressed first.

1058
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:22,031
Change in the car.

1059
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,032
Where are we going?

1060
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,200
- To the bank.
- Bank?

1061
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,034
Why?

1062
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:29,939
I'll explain to you in the car.

1063
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:32,408
[Engine sputtering]

1064
01:13:47,657 --> 01:13:48,357
Dammit!

1065
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:50,059
What is it?

1066
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:51,294
Bastard cut all the wires.

1067
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:52,095
Oh, god.

1068
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:52,962
What are we gonna do?

1069
01:13:57,467 --> 01:13:58,167
I have an idea.

1070
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:58,968
I'll be right back.

1071
01:17:12,161 --> 01:17:14,063
Any problems with the kid?

1072
01:17:14,163 --> 01:17:18,567
Problems have only just begun.

1073
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:20,069
Get in.

1074
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:21,070
Get in!

1075
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:50,499
JESSICA: Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1076
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,434
Sure.

1077
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:52,501
Whatever you say.

1078
01:17:52,601 --> 01:17:55,138
KAMPO: Pass your
briefcase back to Jessica.

1079
01:17:55,238 --> 01:17:57,606
You're making a big
mistake [inaudible],

1080
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:59,575
Just like your brother did.

1081
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,543
KAMPO: Bastard.

1082
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:01,677
I should fucking
kill you right now.

balls... the huevos, eh?

01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:10,519
Where are you taking me?

1087
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:13,189
Somewhere I can drop you off
to the proper authorities.

1088
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:13,990
Bad idea.

1089
01:18:19,562 --> 01:18:22,932
[Gunshots]

1090
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:42,318
Get out of the car.

1091
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:43,319
Get out!

1092
01:18:43,419 --> 01:18:44,120

01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:50,760
Put your hands up.

1094
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,761
Put them up.

1095
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:57,733
Kampo, my men are just outside.

1096
01:18:57,834 --> 01:19:00,203
You're sealed in.

1097
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:01,704
Give it up.

1098
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:03,239
There's no reason
for you to follow

1099
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:04,473
In your brother's footsteps.

1100
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:05,374
Shut up.

1101
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:08,577
Put your hands up.

1102
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:11,047
Jessie, get out of the car and
handcuff this piece of shit.

1103
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:23,459
Kampo... Kampo, why put
the girl at risk as well?

1104
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,461
Your plan will never work.

1105
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:26,429
I said shut up.

1106
01:19:32,201 --> 01:19:32,869
Jessie!

1107
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:38,842

1109
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,298
RAMIREZ: After him.

1110
01:20:02,398 --> 01:20:04,133
He went behind
the wooden crates.

1111
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:11,074
Come on, college student.

1112
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:13,276
There's no way out for you.

1113
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:14,177
All I want is my briefcase.

1114
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:16,679
[Gunshots]

1115
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,150
Carlos?

1116
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:24,120
Cacho?

1117
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:25,121
Answer me.

1118
01:20:25,221 --> 01:20:26,589
Do you have my briefcase?

1119
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,564
Shit.

1120
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,533
You're a dead man, Kampo.

1121
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,421
Ramirez [inaudible].

1122
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:07,863
Surprises.

1124
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:39,428
[Bang]

1125
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:40,896
This neighborhood
has gone to hell.

1126
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:02,318
Kampo!

1127
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:03,819
You can't hide from me.

1128
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:08,791
Kampo!

1129
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:56,605
[Gunshot]

1130
01:23:01,177 --> 01:23:03,079
Dios.

1131
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:04,080
Mi Dios.

1132
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:16,025
[Inaudible]

1133
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:21,997
Fuck you.

1134
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:23,499
Don't move.

1135
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:24,500
Don't move.

1136
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:32,975

1137
01:23:42,218 --> 01:23:42,918
[Sirens]

1138
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:46,322
Come on, let's go.

1139
01:23:46,422 --> 01:23:47,123
Let's go.

1140
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:48,124
It's over.

1141
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:48,924
Not yet.

1142
01:26:41,930 --> 01:26:42,631
MAN: Damn.

1143
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:44,767
What the hell was that?
