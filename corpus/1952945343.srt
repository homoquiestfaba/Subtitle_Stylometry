1
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,032
You, you're out.

2
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,958
How goes it, Mitchel?

3
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,072
Prison makes me nervous, Billy.

4
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,795
Let's go, then.

5
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,273
Here's something new for you.

6
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,518
You can't smoke in the fucking pub.

7
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,397
They done it in Ireland.

8
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,511
They done it, fuck me,
they done it in France.

9
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,351
New York, they've made the fags,

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,040
so they burn out
if you leave them in the ashtray.

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,112
Tastes like shit as well.

12
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,150
You been to New York, Billy?

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,228
Well, that's another fucking story,
isn't it?

14
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,198
The guy that owned this flat,
this doctor,

15
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,555
got into heavy schtook with,
shall we say, a money lender.

16
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,149
Left everything.

17
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,678
- You're the money lender?
- Well...

18
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,513
Part of a firm.

19
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,791
And, we'd like you to be onboard.

20
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,919
I don't think so, Billy.

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,270
Still, you stay.
Think about it. Whatever.

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,671
Where you gonna go otherwise, right?

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,231
What? £80 they give you
to make your way in London.

24
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,588
In London?

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,998
What is it, £47 a week
jobseekers allowance?

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,472
850 a week, this place.

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,753
On Kennington Road.

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,876
Here.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,149
I won't use it.

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,270
You need it.

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,918
And you need me, mate.

32
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,031
You need your friend, Billy.

33
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,712
There's a party tonight,
of course there's a party.

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,353
Usual, down at the Hanover.

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,392
Don't be late.
It's your party, isn't it?

36
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,916
Did they hurt you in there, Mitchel?

37
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,832
Nah, not so you'd notice.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,558
They hurt me in there, Mitchel.

39
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,515
I know they did, Joe.
It's all right now. Here.

40
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,834
You don't have to do that.

41
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,077
Yeah, I do.
It's a tax you pay for being all right.

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,718
You missed the World Cup.

43
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,595
Let's have it.

44
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,990
Fuck off.

45
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,950
Go on.

46
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,073
That's a shit place to park.

47
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,114
You're a legend.

48
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,873
A little something
for a rainy day, mate!

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,115
Here you go, mate!

50
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,119
Welcome back, brother.

51
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,029
Shame we can't talk about work
in a place like this, Mitch.

52
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,834
There's something I want
to throw you way.

53
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,315
If you don't talk about work here,
Danny, where do you talk about it?

54
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,351
- It's full of fucking reporters, isn't it?
- What?

55
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,749
Do you know what I mean?

56
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,077
Fucking congregation
of fucking southeast villains like this.

57
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,475
I mean, see that one over there?
There.

58
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,431
Right, she's writing a fucking book.

59
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,876
And they all want their
fucking picture taken, don't they?

60
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,788
They all want their photo in it.
Fucking bunch of fucking tossers.

61
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,917
The pad you're in, yeah?

62
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,349
I don't need to tell ya
there's no free lunches.

63
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,630
There are other things I can do,
and maybe I want to fucking do them.

64
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,512
No, it ain't like you think.

65
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,671
I ain't going back inside, Billy, ever.

66
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,119
For fucking no one.

67
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,276
Then don't get caught,
you fucking cunt.

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,759
There's a bit of a ruckus
in the cellar, lad.

69
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,949
I think it's your sister.

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,475
Did you invite my sister?

71
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,715
Me? No.

72
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,394
She's a fucking cow.

73
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,193
Come on, darling.

74
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,070
What are you going to do?
Are you going to kill me?

75
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,758
- Aye, I may.
- You going to kill me?

76
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,400
Hey, hey. Yo, bro. It's all cool, yeah.
It's a'right.

77
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,031
When you're black,
I'll fucking tell you.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,639
I told him.
I told him it was only kissing.

79
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,793
Christ, Mitch, that ain't right.
That's...

80
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,751
I don't give a fuck who it is!

81
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,393
That's Purple Dave's nephew.

82
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,351
- Which Purple Dave?
- Eh?

83
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,752
Hey, what's up?
Where you going? Mitch?

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,433
- You look nice, Briony.
- Yeah? Do you like it? I stole it.

85
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,709
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?

86
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,989
You get some rest
and no more drinking, right?

87
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,758
I've not been drinking.
I've not been fucking drinking.

88
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,359
- On my meds, some chance.
- Briony, you've been drinking.

89
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,471
- Get some rest.
- I've not been drinking.

90
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,113
I've not... Ugh!

91
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,549
Fuck! Smells like someone's
been drinking in here.

92
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,069
West 11. End of the road.

93
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,395
And make sure she gets
to the front door, yeah?

94
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,272
If you care about me,
you come and take care of me.

95
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,799
We tried that.

96
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,669
Here.

97
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,635
All right.

98
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,835
I haven't been drinking!

99
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,239
Fancy a drink?

100
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,598
All right. Not here.

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,433
Somewhere else.

102
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,239
Never again.

103
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,075
Where's Mitch?

104
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,719
Mad Tommy said...
Mad Tommy with the mad hairpiece,

105
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,594
that this party was for a criminal,
just out of Pentonville.

106
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,233
I was a criminal.

107
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,512
Presently, I am just unemployed.

108
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,835
Are you handy?

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,036
What, with hammers and such?

110
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,993
I might have something for you.
A job, I mean.

111
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,714
I'm serious. I am.

112
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,071
Is it too little for you now?
What a tradesman makes?

113
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,435
No. I know how little I need.

114
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,674
To be happy?

115
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,555
To be alive.

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,228
I'm Penny.

117
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,795
I'm Mitchel.

118
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,197
<i>Look, I have this, um, friend.</i>

119
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,513
<i>We go back ages.
She lives in Holland Park.</i>

120
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,712
<i>She's... retired.</i>

121
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,591
<i>Friend your age? Retired?</i>

122
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,278
<i>You'd know who it was
if I told you.</i>

123
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,595
<i>She's gone a bit Howard Hughes.</i>

124
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,471
Still blind, you old fraud?

125
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,995
I need a favour.

126
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,270
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Put it back.

127
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,392
- I found it in a bin, down the estates.
- Right.

128
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,673
You know what?

129
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,749
Put it away.

130
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,189
Yes?

131
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,675
My name's Mitchel.
I was told that I was expected.

132
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,436
We may well be expecting you.

133
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,472
I've been out of communication.

134
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,520
Go round there and there's a door.
The kitchen door.

135
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,718
Don't.
We keep the curtains closed.

136
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,109
Right.

137
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,873
Are you a thief?

138
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,633
I've never stolen anything.

139
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,079
Why did you go to prison?

140
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,517
I was in an altercation.
It got out of hand.

141
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,109
Do you like violence?

142
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,955
I will hurt someone
before they hurt me.

143
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,559
- Sometimes they come over the walls.
- The paparazzi.

144
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,071
They're outside my house
all the fucking time.

145
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,315
You know, it's got a bit much.

146
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,959
Right.

147
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,435
If they got over, if they got in...

148
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,275
Did you fuck Penny?

149
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,595
No.

150
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,712
That's odd. She's fucked everyone
I've ever met. Except Jordan.

151
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,115
Thank you very much.

152
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,314
Could you get someone off the property
if you needed to?

153
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,399
I mean, if I needed you to,
could you help look after me?

154
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,429
Yes.

155
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,675
Uh, you have to sign a piece of paper.
A...

156
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,677
Non-disclosure agreement.

157
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,358
Do you have a camera phone?

158
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,037
Jordan will take care of everything.

159
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,833
- Money.
- Thank you, miss.

160
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,473
What she does these days,
mainly, is paint.

161
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,831
She has a studio upstairs.

162
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,230
The papers would say she daubs.

163
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,190
See, you're not allowed
to do more than one thing,

164
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,834
which is why a polymath,
such as myself,

165
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,593
prefers to do nothing.

166
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,271
It's all about privacy, you see.
This day and age.

167
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,709
Privacy.

168
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,190
I fancy celebrities
rather like the Olympians of old.

169
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,151
They do wonder out there,
the little people,

170
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,158
what their gods are doing,
who they're fucking,

171
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,478
who they've chained to a rock,
or turned into a fucking ass.

172
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,835
All this could be yours, later,

173
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,517
if you haven't nicked any
<i>Screaming Popes.</i>

174
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,474
Are you fixed up?

175
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,755
For now, I am.

176
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,951
It's a nice day,
if you like that sort of thing.

177
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,239
Everything you could possibly need
is in here. Tools, ladders, paints.

178
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,589
If there's anything else,
we have an account, down the road.

179
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,672
You've seen her in films?

180
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,472
Getting her kit off.

181
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,152
If it wasn't for Monica Bellucci,

182
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,999
she'd be the most raped woman
in European cinema.

183
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,190
And all before the age of 30.

184
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,312
Of course, she's also
very serious about her acting.

185
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,194
Apart from not wanting to do it,
she's incredibly serious about her craft.

186
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,479
Her husband's a fuckwit.

187
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,509
His cars.

188
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,275
He hasn't a call for them.
He's in Spain. Drunk.

189
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,157
They should be covered.
They need to be taken care of.

190
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,508
Yes.

191
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,076
Well, if we could find the fucking titles,
they'd have all have been sold.

192
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,990
You will arrive promptly at 7:30,
work commences at 8:00 sharp.

193
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,396
At 11:00, you'll have a tea break.
At 1:00, lunch for one hour.

194
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,954
- Monday's you'll do painting...
- Jordan, I'm not sure of this...

195
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,832
Please, bear with me.
I'm making all this up.

196
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,678
I'm a model of efficiency.

197
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,837
Wednesdays, the roof.
Thursdays, windows.

198
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,999
Friday, the patio. Saturday, party.
Sunday, go to church.

199
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,998
And pray, I pray you,
for all of us entire.

200
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,275
Right.

201
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,149
Are you an actor?

202
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,835
Am.

203
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,913
I'm resting.

204
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,593
You are no longer employed, Mr Lee.
I thought I made that perfectly clear.

205
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,870
Lighten up, mate.

206
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,559
So I had a camera.

207
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,635
Did I use it?

208
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,558
- Did I?
- You have already been replaced.

209
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,399
I don't think so.

210
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,159
You see, I know too much,
don't I? Eh?

211
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,629
Cup of tea, Jord.

212
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,030
Two sugars.

213
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,078
There's a good boy.

214
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,312
Get the fuck out of here,
you fat, fucking cunt!

215
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,955
And you go anywhere near the tabloids,
and I will chop you up in court

216
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,640
until there's nothing left
but a fucking stain!

217
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,589
Fuck off.

218
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,958
Thank you. No heroin today.

219
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,949
They'll take your photograph
until they realise you're nobody.

220
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,875
They're kind enough to think
we're all somebody, for a minute.

221
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,677
Is next Monday suitable?

222
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,436
Oi! You want a talking to.

223
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,473
He's got no idea, that posh cunt!
No idea! No fucking idea, mate!

224
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,478
You've got to ask yourself
how he became posh in the first place.

225
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,875
His grandfather probably did
your grandfather with a shovel.

226
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,911
You don't want to fuck with me!

227
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,110
I don't have to fuck with you,
you're already fucked.

228
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,549
Out of a job, anyway.
Don't ever go there again.

229
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,956
Oh, we'll see about that.
Your manor now, is it, eh? Eh?

230
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,833
Maybe it's enough for you.
How's your brother?

231
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,110
- What's your name?
- Harry Mitchel.

232
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,236
Bullshit.

233
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,509
You want to see my driver's licence,
Lee-Lee?

234
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,949
Fuck off.

235
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,276
Detective Sergeant Bailey, Mr Mitchel.

236
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,433
Might I have a word?

237
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,035
Now, we get a daily bulletin about all
ex-prisoners returning to our manor.

238
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,157
And I recognise your name,
of course, but, hey,

239
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,519
there's no address.

240
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,108
Now why no address
when you so clearly have one.

241
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,549
I'm not on parole.

242
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,275
- I'm a free man.
- 'Course you are.

243
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,635
Where's the owner?

244
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,112
How about a nice cup of tea?
Two sugars.

245
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,113
Your friend Billy Norton
is sailing close to the wind.

246
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,909
You'd be wise to avoid him.
And dodges like this flat.

247
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,718
Which, if I were to look into it...

248
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,910
Yeah, I got my eye on you, Mitchel.

249
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,509
You're in my manor.

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,036
What is it? What you want?

251
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,310
Consider it rent on the flat.

252
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,268
- I'll see meself out.
- Yeah, you will.

253
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,391
- Fucking cunt.
- I heard that!

254
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,471
You ready to clock in?

255
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,556
You're sailing close to the wind, Billy.

256
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,875
- Eh? What?
- Policeman told me.

257
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,196
You spoke to a fucking copper about me?

258
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,389
The same one
who got my address from you.

259
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
Oh, Bailey? Oh, fuck Bailey.
You don't worry about him.

260
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,193
Right. Hope the fucking lift's working.

261
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,593
We start at the top,
we work our way down, right?

262
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,709
When you finish this gaff, mate,

263
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,353
you want to be near
the front fucking door.

264
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,799
I shit you not.

265
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,829
Get your mum.

266
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,155
Your mum, yeah?

267
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,190
Go on, get...

268
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,389
What have you got for me?

269
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,192
Let's have a look then.

270
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,789
No, you're a bit short, love.

271
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,070
I had a difficult week.

272
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,475
I had to buy a plane ticket,
my father's got cancer.

273
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,469
Yeah? I could give a rat's fucking arse
about your Hindu psychodramas.

274
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,670
You know, I'll tell you what,
I'll tell you what,

275
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,391
you can double up next week.

276
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,475
- All right?
- Yeah.

277
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,397
- All right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

278
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,109
Hello.

279
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,158
I'm Anthony Trent.

280
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,951
This is my house.

281
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,717
That is, it was my house
before it became your house.

282
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,955
And now you want what?

283
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,357
Funnily enough,
I thought I might collect some things.

284
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,517
They made me write prescriptions
apart from everything else.

285
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,154
I'm a doctor.
I'm being investigated.

286
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,195
It's a sad story, Anthony,
but given the people involved,

287
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,117
I think it will get sadder
if you come here again.

288
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,515
I reckoned it was a mistake to come.

289
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,154
Nice night.

290
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,319
Fuck yourself.

291
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,116
How's the eating? You eating?

292
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,710
You know I don't like to eat.
It makes me sick.

293
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,353
There's only so far
I can take care of you.

294
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,591
Mum went down helping you.

295
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,154
Didn't have a life until
she had cancer because of you.

296
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,552
I didn't come here for a lecture.

297
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,113
You came for a proper feed
of meat and vegetables

298
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,389
and you're going to
fucking well have it.

299
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,271
If I cook this,
and if you don't eat it, we're done.

300
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,112
- Want vodka.
- I don't have any fucking vodka.

301
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,753
All right?
Have a fucking vegetable.

302
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,438
- Want a vodka.
- You can't have vodka with your meds.

303
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,470
I want a fucking vodka.

304
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,670
You can't have fucking vodka
with your meds!

305
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,553
Can't eat with that staring at me.

306
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,872
Join the fucking club.

307
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,952
I already told you
he's not in any condition for visitors.

308
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,672
What is the problem, please?

309
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,155
He wants to see our Mr Anonymous.

310
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,840
- His name is Joe.
- What's his last name?

311
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,477
Matron, I'll deal with this.

312
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,999
As a relative.

313
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,838
A nephew perhaps?

314
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,428
- That's right, I'm his nephew.
- Please.

315
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,632
Joe is not in good shape.
I think he has 24 hours or less.

316
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,715
- What?
- I'm very sorry.

317
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,555
Do you wish to see him?

318
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,790
- Please.
- I'm Dr Raju.

319
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,469
Mitchel.

320
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,949
Mitchel.

321
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,949
Hello, Joe.

322
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,118
You should see the other guy.

323
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,959
Who is the other guy, Joe?

324
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,192
It's important you tell me
who the other guy is.

325
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,038
It doesn't make a difference.

326
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,754
Yes, it makes a difference.

327
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,116
I don't want to die, Mitch.

328
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,629
I thought I wouldn't mind,
but I do.

329
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,032
Well, that's the difference, Joe.

330
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,034
So you tell me who did this.

331
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,472
Kid from the estates.

332
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,636
About 16.

333
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,588
Footballer.

334
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,309
Real one.

335
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,269
Scouted.

336
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,634
This morphine is a rush, Mitch.

337
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,035
I lived as long as I could.

338
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,355
I tried.

339
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,393
Well done, son. Well done.

340
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,031
- I need a burial plot.
- <i>What?</i>

341
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,958
I don't want to start from the beginning again
and tell you I need a burial plot.

342
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,036
Now if you ask me fucking why.
Just get it done.

343
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,551
<i>It'll cost ya. Not just money.
I told ya, I need your help tomorrow.</i>

344
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,798
- Right.
-<i>None of the lads are...</i>

345
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,274
Now it's one flat.
One flat, that's all.

346
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,315
This is it.

347
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,430
You know who I am,
and you know what this is.

348
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,349
He don't leave money here.

349
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,280
Look, just gimme something.
I got to have something.

350
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,311
I told you, I got nothing.

351
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,353
- Where is he?
- He's out.

352
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,753
- You'd better get out of here.
- Eh?

353
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,599
Why? Why's that then?

354
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,756
Why? Without what belongs to me.

355
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,075
Nothing belongs to you.

356
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,992
- What the fuck you say to me!
- My brother's coming over.

357
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,516
- Yeah, your brother is?
- What the fuck you doing?

358
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,232
Fucking get off me!
Fuck off!

359
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,759
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Billy?

360
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,918
Nothing broken. Ribs.

361
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,279
Nobody wants to pay compensations.

362
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,512
Bones and teeth, you pay for them.

363
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,709
Right.

364
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,950
We seem to be missing your NHS number.

365
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,354
Taken care of, Matron.
Thank you.

366
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,637
- Right. Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you. No, thank you.

367
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,429
Good man.

368
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,791
I'll fix you up
with some pain killers.

369
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,155
I thought you was behind me.
I said that.

370
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,078
I said, if it gets moody, run.
I said that in the van.

371
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,155
No, you didn't.

372
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,800
So what's this...
this other job you got?

373
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,555
I don't have a job.

374
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,668
Listen, I run into Lee
down the Feathers.

375
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,314
He says...
He says you got his job.

376
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,360
He says he don't mind
'cause it's you.

377
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,276
But, car collection in the garage.

378
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,071
It's outrageous, Lee says.
Like '60s Silver Cloud.

379
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
And her, Lee says
she's out of her mind.

380
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,316
Yeah? Well, word's got around
and there's an interested party.

381
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,429
Yeah?

382
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,512
You put it all in a container, right?

383
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,272
Cars, paintings, jewellery, furniture.
Off to France.

384
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,113
What's your point, Billy?

385
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,117
Well, it'd be worth knocking it over.
You and me.

386
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,834
We'd have a grateful party.

387
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,915
Billy.

388
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,632
We got that car, them paintings.

389
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,796
Who do you think
the cops will pull first?

390
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,829
Well, there is that.

391
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,632
Put it out of your mind,
you fucking understand me?

392
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,276
Calm down, Mitch. I've been asked.
I asked you. I got me answer. Done.

393
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,398
- What?
- Burial plot.

394
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,750
Courtesy of a mate
you never knew you had.

395
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,590
Same one who wants
the paintings and the cars?

396
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,953
Bury your friend. Or not. Or not.
Up to you.

397
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,356
- Any last words?
- Yeah.

398
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,673
We're all fucked.

399
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,229
Where'd you get the dog?

400
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,555
A lady had him tied to some railings.

401
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,717
- Where'd you get the Scotsman?
- Outside Marks and Spencer.

402
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,068
- Who's paying him?
- I am.

403
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,269
With what?

404
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,118
I gave him a wank
while pretending to be his mum.

405
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,277
- Fuck sake, Briony. Shh.
- It's common in Scotland.

406
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,240
- Did he tell you that?
- No, I just know it.

407
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,509
Come on.

408
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,069
Well...

409
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,355
Well...

410
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,432
If you're a real doctor, do you do,
like, plastic surgery and stuff?

411
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,755
- Plastic surgery?
- I'd quite like my chin done. Ooh!

412
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,759
That's like a bit of a dance.
Do you dance?

413
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,193
Can't dance with this hat.

414
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,991
Is it terrible to say
that I'm enjoying myself?

415
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,197
No, it's essential that
you enjoy yourself.

416
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,113
My wife was a very shrewish woman.

417
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,709
I told her finally,
"I love you, but I want to enjoy my life."

418
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,310
She was more outraged by that
than anything I'd ever said to her.

419
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,159
I am divorced.

420
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,958
I would like to see your sister, Mitchel,
with your permission.

421
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,197
Sanji, it's a free country.
And you're a good man, but she's...

422
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,719
I don't mind if she's got problems.

423
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,913
Will you let me try?

424
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,954
There we go.

425
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,079
I read a lot in prison, Sanji.

426
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,317
There was a poet named Rilke.
He's got a line.

427
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,395
"Everything terrible is something
that needs our love."

428
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,911
- And that over there is terrible.
- No.

429
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,229
But it doesn't want your love.

430
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,555
It wants your fucking PIN number.

431
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,115
You're a good man, Sanji,
no good will come of it.

432
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,713
Saving people. Being a saint.

433
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,510
And they just buried one,
didn't they?

434
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,310
Will you see her home?

435
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,638
That's what I was talking about.

436
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,234
- Tell her not to pay the piper.
- Oh, no, no, no.

437
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,079
I'll take care of it.
It'll be my pleasure.

438
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,472
- How many kids have you got?
- I don't know. Three.

439
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,357
There's a lot you don't know,
you fucking jaffa.

440
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,150
- All right.
- Hi, there.

441
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,159
How was it up the 'Ville?

442
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,111
Better to be out.

443
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,948
Got a favour to ask.

444
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,957
Ask and you shall receive, my son.

445
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,356
Two kids up Kennington Estates
did a <i>Big Issue</i> seller.

446
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,950
Lit him on fire?

447
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,758
Rite of passage.

448
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,311
Rite of passage?

449
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,230
So is that.

450
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,670
Calm down.

451
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,479
- I'll ask around.
- You do that.

452
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,160
One of them's a football player.
Scouted.

453
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,950
Everyone knows who did this.

454
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,072
Someone had better bring me
a fucking name. Someone had better.

455
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,035
Fuck.

456
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,595
- How many in a baker's dozen?
- 13.

457
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,869
Thirteen.

458
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,717
Did you have an accident?

459
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,391
A strenuous workout, Jordan.

460
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,355
Are you fit for work?

461
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,115
Work is what you do when you'd
rather be doing something else, right?

462
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,553
Always has been for me.

463
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,957
I get them from Hong Kong.

464
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,473
Not personally.

465
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,877
How did you become a criminal,

466
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,150
since you're not a big oink
with a missing chromosome?

467
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,113
Do you want the real answer?

468
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,155
Well, I was thinking
about something else.

469
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,389
And what were you thinking about

470
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,748
when you were thinking
about something else?

471
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,715
Whatever it was, I wasn't
thinking about it clearly enough.

472
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,833
We used to have parties.

473
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,879
My husband's half-sister's stepfather
had a daughter by his previous...

474
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,195
God, no, I think it was
his second previous.

475
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,508
Strapping girl
with big teeth and dyslexia.

476
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,390
She got married here under an awning.

477
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,511
So did I. It's the Cape Canaveral
with shitty marriages.

478
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,351
Well, it's the garden for it.

479
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,598
So what was it like in prison?

480
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,951
The truth is, it was embarrassing.

481
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,595
Hmm.

482
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,068
There's something to say
about those roses,

483
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,838
but I can't think what it would be.

484
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,273
- Well...
- No, I don't want a plan for them.

485
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,389
They're beyond fucked.

486
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,637
Now, you'd better go inside.

487
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,273
- They're on the roof. They're up there.
- Shit!

488
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,879
Up here, for fuck's sake!

489
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,713
Show us something!

490
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,110
One day I wondered what a shot
of me dead would be worth.

491
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,035
They pay big for morgue photos.

492
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,353
Charlotte, you filthy slag!

493
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,313
Is that your new fuck buddy, Charlotte?

494
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,159
What are you running away for?

495
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,036
Charlotte, suck his cock!

496
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,988
I went to RADA.

497
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,152
Have I seen you in anything, Jordan?

498
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,268
Well, I was on a kids' show.

499
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,879
Then I was on methadone.

500
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,472
Then I was a producer.

501
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,869
Seriously.

502
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,828
Listen, Jordan, I think you should
consider a bit more security.

503
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,993
Burglar lights. Basically everywhere.
And the house isn't wired all that well.

504
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,392
You'd be the expert.

505
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,997
I'll leave you to it, all right.

506
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,553
Let's go inside.

507
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,555
Yeah.

508
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,872
How you finding the place?
You comfortable?

509
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,756
No, I'm talking to someone else.

510
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,872
Well, don't hurt him hurt him.
Fucking hurt him.

511
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,834
Yeah. What is it with you?

512
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,756
Yeah. Bye, bye, bye, bye.

513
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,318
Bunch of fucking morons.

514
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,716
These people drive you fucking crazy.

515
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,029
Cunts.

516
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,309
Warm, isn't it?

517
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,598
You haven't got a mobile, have you?
Get him a mobile.

518
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,154
One with an answering machine
so we can keep in touch.

519
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,875
Do you read books?

520
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,237
- Yeah.
- Ah, just finished reading a book.

521
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,829
The jury's still out whether we're
noble savages or just fucking savages.

522
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,916
All them years on an inquiry,
they still don't fucking know.

523
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,399
What do you think?

524
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,272
Some were noble, some were savages.

525
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,755
Uh-huh.

526
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,799
Fucking savages.

527
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,273
That was good what you done in Brixton.

528
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,076
Took a lot of heart to stand up
half a dozen mechanical Islamics.

529
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,714
Fuck me.
Who knows what them cunts get up to.

530
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,469
There was four of them.

531
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,909
- Yeah.
- What it took was stupidity.

532
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,909
This cunt...

533
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,277
What is this cunt doing?

534
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,759
No, no, no.
That's not stupidity, you see.

535
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,399
No. Stupidity runs away like a cunt,

536
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,476
and then a bigger cunt,
he comes back to me

537
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,875
and tells me that he fucking run away.

538
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,348
See, a man like you,
you send a message.

539
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,596
What? That I can take a beating?

540
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,870
I'm only alive
because they saw me hit Billy.

541
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,555
Yeah, well.
They were very decent Zulus.

542
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,389
Decent no more.

543
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,038
- They don't know who's behind Billy.
- Right.

544
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,116
You have to be very careful about that,
you see?

545
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,356
Cunts like Billy, they've always got
someone behind them. Am I right?

546
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,199
I mean even a spade who's just
come out of a fucking tree.

547
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,229
You can never imagine
some cunt like that was in charge.

548
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,316
Can you fucking imagine it?

549
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,269
Yeah, well, I'm gonna put you in charge
of a high rise in Peckham.

550
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,679
Need a bit of discipline there, you know,
been one or two boom-boom incidents.

551
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,075
The natives are restless
and all out of bollocks.

552
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,668
I see. I'm very honoured.

553
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,352
But I'm still learning the ropes.

554
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,072
That's old Navy talk.

555
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,993
In case you don't quite understand
what that means,

556
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,878
it means you have to learn the ropes
before you become an able seaman.

557
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,958
- You understand that?
- Specialised business, isn't it?

558
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,435
- Hmm.
- So I think I should hold off.

559
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,078
Well, if you want to tag along
with that cunt a little bit longer,

560
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,952
then that's up to you.

561
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,349
Oh, fuck me.

562
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,674
Bit early for that.

563
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,919
Oh, I got a little surprise
for you Thursday night.

564
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,395
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

565
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,640
He'll pick you up.
If he's still about.

566
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,313
Good night, sweetheart.

567
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,799
She in there or what?
You giving her one?

568
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,909
Yeah, you're a guy working.

569
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,109
We're just guys working, too!

570
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,798
- Is she in there?
- She's not here.

571
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,512
Oh, come on,
she must be in there, yeah?

572
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,358
Who's giving her one?
You must know who's giving her one.

573
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,595
Give us something, mate,
I've got kids to feed.

574
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,709
What's your name, yeah?

575
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,353
Come on!

576
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,277
Come on, who are you?
You doing her, yeah?

577
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,191
Her husband crashed a car in Spain
and incinerated a fucking viscount.

578
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,513
- Lovely.
- Now I have a dental situation.

579
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,634
She wants to know if you can drive.
Can you drive?

580
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,510
So, you're not a criminal.

581
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,436
You're just like anybody
who might have gotten pinched

582
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,118
for hitting someone in a bar.

583
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,599
- There was more to it than that.
- Was or is?

584
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,755
Was.

585
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,840
So what do you want
out of life, Mitch?

586
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,190
Out of all this worthless shit?

587
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,198
Enough to eat, a bed to lie in.
So I can think.

588
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,429
You had that in jail.

589
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,079
Could you get me a drink?

590
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,915
A scotch.

591
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,677
This place is a mausoleum.

592
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,438
I didn't offer you one.

593
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,357
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

594
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,992
Listen, what you are,

595
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,359
it's not what everybody is.

596
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,150
It's all right to have trouble
with the basics.

597
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,277
It would be odd if you didn't.

598
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,079
Where would you be if you were me?

599
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,194
Los Angeles.

600
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,430
There's no milk
and mice shat in the sugar.

601
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,436
I suppose a biscuit's
out of the question.

602
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,754
Fuck off.

603
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,753
What we here for?

604
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,429
To pack.

605
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,359
They're not here yet.

606
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,793
They will be.

607
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,393
You've been down to my property.

608
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,392
You took money from my Mitchel.

609
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,559
- But Billy Norton said it was...
- No.

610
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,240
Billy Norton is a cunt.

611
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,436
Fuck Billy Norton.
Fuck you.

612
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,554
How much you take off my Mitchel?

613
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,192
- Fifty.
- Giz it.

614
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,153
Who do you work for?

615
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,713
- The police...
- No, that's your day job.

616
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:22,709
Cunt.

617
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:28,639
You go down to my property again
and take my money off my boys

618
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,676
and you'll end up in there.

619
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,309
Is that clear?

620
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,029
Nothing clearer.

621
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,553
How's your egg sarn?

622
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,550
- It's all right.
- Is it? Lovely.

623
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,669
Fuck off.

624
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,629
Go on.

625
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,392
You can't seriously advise me

626
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,873
that what I've been doing
is worth anything.

627
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,718
Yes, I can. I just did.

628
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,239
Do you know what a woman's for in film?

629
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,315
Go on then.

630
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,919
What this job is that
I'm supposed to want?

631
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,315
- I'm listening.
- A woman is there

632
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,908
to get the hero to talk about himself.

633
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,759
About his hopes.
About his fears.

634
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,314
Maybe even about his
fascinating fucking childhood.

635
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,317
But I can't... I can't do it.

636
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,471
Either you're getting your kit off,

637
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,718
opening up the trousers or brains
of an idiot in a piece of shit.

638
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,356
Or you're shooting MOS in Genoa
with some geriatric Italian pervert

639
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,109
who really artistically needs the hero
to stick his thumb up your arsehole

640
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,470
in the 17th sex scene.

641
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,749
Right.

642
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,235
Do you like the place?

643
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,519
- Needs a bit of work.
- Yeah.

644
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,433
You know, I was in Italy.

645
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,949
And...

646
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,272
And I started to fizz.

647
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,072
My arms felt light.

648
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,749
Dirty.

649
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,233
My mind was racing
and I couldn't breathe.

650
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,797
And I thought that I was going to die.

651
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,229
So I thought I'll just go home
and I'll have a week for myself.

652
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,351
I'll have a week for myself.

653
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,109
A bath.

654
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:43,838
But then I couldn't go out again
and now it's all this.

655
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,912
You ever had it since?

656
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,789
Fear?

657
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,995
Um...

658
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,154
Thanks for coming on,
for taking the job.

659
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,034
I haven't taken the job.

660
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,268
Good night.

661
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,518
The man who did this,
did the White House.

662
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,515
Seriously, went to America,
as one does when things go wrong.

663
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:35,709
I've heard of that.

664
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,556
You spent the night with her?

665
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,076
I'm going to pretend
you didn't ask the question.

666
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,390
- Did she tell you why she quit working?
- She doesn't like it.

667
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,794
Doesn't see the point.

668
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,918
She didn't tell you why she quit?

669
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,558
She was raped in Italy.

670
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,110
There were no police involved,
no newspapers.

671
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,151
She can't really report things.

672
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,475
- What happened to the man who did it?
- Well, it's an interesting story.

673
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,950
Turns out there were Quaaludes
dissolved in his Adescian Chianti.

674
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,799
A fucking lot of Quaaludes.

675
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,478
He's on a machine in Barnet.

676
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,676
You're late.
You knew about it.

677
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,511
What's the surprise, Billy?

678
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,072
You'll see, won't you?

679
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,915
Good of you to turn up, Mitchel.
Was this cunt late?

680
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,110
You know Mr Beaumont and Mr Fletcher.

681
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,789
He's not one of them.

682
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,356
- He's not one of them?
- He's not one of them.

683
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,756
- He's not one of them, Billy.
- He's got a fucking foreskin, mate!

684
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,270
I got done by the Nation of Islam!

685
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,478
- And even if he was one of them...
- And even if he was, what?

686
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,792
What, you go down there, Bill,
and pick up the first black boy you saw?

687
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,675
Example, you said.
Even if it wasn't him, which it is him.

688
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,677
Well, it fucking is now.

689
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,952
You know when I was a kid,
I was underprivileged, yeah?

690
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,112
My mother, don't get me wrong,
she kept a nice place and that.

691
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,312
Just after the war,
weren't a lot of money about.

692
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,030
But you know what, I remember
driving my girlfriend to Bermondsey,

693
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,435
so she could go to a party
with another boy.

694
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,714
Well, she didn't think I knew.
But I did. I fucking knew.

695
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,280
She made me feel like a right cunt.

696
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,230
What's that got to do with me?

697
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,875
Fuck!

698
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,158
Fuck me. Look at that.

699
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,594
Right in the heart.

700
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,199
Well, ain't we all.

701
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,159
You're an accessory now.

702
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,398
It's a bit like being married,
you know. It's for life.

703
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,511
Now, men that take it
to the next level,

704
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,949
they can do anything
they fucking want, Mitchel.

705
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,750
Except keeping a guy like Billy
from fucking up.

706
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,633
- Well, we're of the same mind, here.
- You stupid cunt!

707
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,748
Bill, take that down the estate,
will you?

708
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,511
- That could be difficult, Mr Gant.
- Oh, really?

709
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,033
Take that cunt down the fucking estate.

710
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,948
Make the other fucking Zulus see it.
Or I'll fucking bury you, cunt!

711
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,834
Now I'd invite you for a drink,
but I'm running a bit bad at the moment.

712
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,793
You should ask a man before you
put him under this sort of contract.

713
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,115
Yeah? Let's have a word.

714
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,199
I didn't ask to know your business.

715
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,799
I don't want to know
your fucking business!

716
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,672
Well, now you know my fucking business.

717
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,917
What you want and what you don't want
are two different fucking things.

718
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,390
- Now are we still friends?
- You're safe, if that's what you mean.

719
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,478
As houses. Now, I know you.
And I know that cunt.

720
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,079
You want me to kill him?
I'll fucking kill him now.

721
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,838
- I didn't say that.
- You did.

722
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,951
No, no, no. That's what you said.
You said it.

723
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,674
- You said exactly that.
- Take it as you like, I didn't say that.

724
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,949
You don't have a cunt like that
working for you.

725
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,310
- I didn't fucking say that!
- You fucking said it. You fucking said it!

726
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,115
You said it. You know what the most
powerful fucking thing is?

727
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:40,188
Yeah, knowing what can go wrong.
For anybody, at any fucking time.

728
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,833
Do you know that?

729
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,395
Well...

730
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,512
Look, what we shouting for?

731
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,470
- Why... Why are we shouting?
- Fuck!

732
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,311
We don't shout at one another a lot.

733
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,159
Let's do lunch,
we'll sit down somewhere nice.

734
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,870
Have a chat.
Like fucking men!

735
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,435
Cunt.

736
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,398
Fucking cunt.

737
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,315
- What do you think?
- I want to live there.

738
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,273
When I was a kid, I imagined a big
fuck-off house in London, this house.

739
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,073
But it's his house.

740
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,350
You have money of your own, right?

741
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,955
- You ever had much money?
- On and off. Not freedom.

742
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,832
- What's that?
- What?

743
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,877
I'm not being a fucking existentialist
with a Gauloise,

744
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,993
I'm just asking a question.

745
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,357
Ask another one.

746
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,159
How would you feel about
going to a restaurant? Like people?

747
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,559
You would be sitting in a restaurant
with a man

748
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,472
who just got out of Pentonville,

749
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,511
after doing three years for GBH.

750
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,992
As much as I love the idea,

751
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,634
I think it's the worst thing
I could possibly do to you.

752
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,878
Yeah, you'd be ripped apart.
I wouldn't want that.

753
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,717
Okay, I'm going to be very brave here.

754
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,354
I'm going to be very bold
and very brave.

755
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,794
If I fell a little in love with you
in the countryside,

756
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,719
what would you do about it?

757
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,914
Anything.

758
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,514
Everything.

759
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,592
I was talking shit earlier
about going to a restaurant.

760
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,993
- I can't. I mean, I can't even...
- I know. I know.

761
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,869
Is she in there, mate!

762
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,672
Oi, where's the cunt
with the long hair?

763
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,598
There's nowhere to hide, mate!

764
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,955
Are you fucking her?

765
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,069
You are, aren't you?

766
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,236
Bet she smells lovely!

767
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,317
There he is!
Up here mate, smile for the camera!

768
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,355
I want you to organise collections,
Streatham, Clapham and Kennington.

769
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,080
- Don't know about that, Mr Gant.
- Call me Rob.

770
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,237
I'm not expecting you to go
door to door, not in that suit.

771
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,998
Fuck me, have a look at you.

772
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,195
You know you could be
anything you want to be.

773
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,469
That's what I've always heard.
"You could do anything."

774
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,590
Yeah.

775
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:17,236
People don't get given chances.
Not like the chance I'm giving you.

776
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,351
Now, your mate Mr Norton,
your friend Billy.

777
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,157
He couldn't run a firm,

778
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,398
he couldn't even bring me
the right spade.

779
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,030
I can recommend the lemon sole,
it's blinding.

780
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,399
Bit flash in here, I know,
but it's fucking British, isn't it?

781
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,189
I'll have the steak, rare and mash.
Thank you.

782
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,793
I want to go with the lemon sole

783
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,480
and some mashed potatoes with it,
and a few bobby beans.

784
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,390
Start with bottle of Sancerre
and a bottle of Haut-Brion.

785
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:14,197
And a glass for each one.
One glass, the right fucking glass.

786
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,192
- Sir?
- Send me the sommelier.

787
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,279
You know, the wine geezer.

788
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,874
You're looking for two Kennington kids
who bashed up some old wino.

789
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,191
One of them is a
young footballer with promise.

790
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,993
And I've got a lot of money
behind him. Future revenue.

791
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,477
Also, it's the love for the game.

792
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,034
- Isn't that lovely?
- Well, he's the belle of the ball.

793
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,315
Right.

794
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,430
No one's going to put him
in a frame, Mitch.

795
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,195
You like this gaff?
You like the life, yeah?

796
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,278
Well, you're going to have to
give up your day job.

797
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,197
- Not a chance.
- Ah.

798
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,438
Lovely out in the country,
isn't it, mate?

799
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,835
That's proper England, you know.
Jerusalem.

800
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,991
You're a fucking gangster.
You're part of my firm.

801
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,230
Well, there are times when a gangster

802
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,274
- is something to be.
- And when is that?

803
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,754
You're not gonna come and work for me,
that's obvious.

804
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,518
So when the fuck is it?

805
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,037
You saw me shoot that fucking spade.

806
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,629
Eh?

807
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,549
You really think I'm going to let you
walk free around this fucking planet?

808
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:44,749
It ain't gonna happen.

809
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,110
See what you have to understand
is that if I was a gangster, Rob,

810
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,554
- you'd be the first to fucking die.
- Huh.

811
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,630
I wouldn't work for you. I'd kill you
and take everything you've got.

812
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,714
- Oh.
- If I were a gangster.

813
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,078
That's why you don't want me
to be a gangster.

814
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,758
That's why nobody wants me
to be a gangster,

815
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,394
'cause I could not stop if I started.
Do you get it?

816
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,073
Don't ask again.

817
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,829
That's for the steak.

818
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,354
Welcome.

819
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,118
I was just getting very high.

820
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,831
Of course you are.
It's 6:00 a.m.

821
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:37,071
You haven't been paid yet.

822
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,912
Rent on the flat.

823
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,437
I'm not taking the job.

824
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,513
You all right?

825
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:11,516
Well, I wasn't expecting you,
but you'll do.

826
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,274
This is my two friends.
Mr Fletcher, Mr Beaumont.

827
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,192
- All right?
- Yeah.

828
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,032
So what are you doing here?

829
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,672
I thought the place would be empty.
I came to collect some things of mine.

830
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,429
- Of yours?
- That I'd left behind when I...

831
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,073
When I had to leave.

832
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,397
You had to get your things in my flat?

833
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,078
It sounds silly,
but it used to be mine.

834
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,077
No, no, no, no.
It was never yours.

835
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,959
- Since I still had a key.
- Oh, you still got a key, yeah.

836
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,359
- But that's...
- That's my key.

837
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,594
You all right? Don't be nervous,
there's no need to be nervous.

838
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,632
- I'm not nervous.
- You're not?

839
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,990
- No.
- What, you always like that?

840
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,989
What?

841
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,116
When I was a kid I used to love
going to the seaside with my uncle.

842
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,151
Well, he wasn't my uncle.
He was with my mum.

843
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,349
She had me,
but he wasn't my uncle.

844
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:31,031
He used to do things to me.

845
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,910
You know how that made me feel?

846
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,918
Did you hear about Kennington?

847
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,479
- No.
- Go fuck yourself, Danny.

848
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:44,828
Everyone knows who I'm looking for

849
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,871
and no one's bringing him to me.
I don't like that, Danny.

850
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,076
All right,
but you didn't hear it from me.

851
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,395
What's his name and where is he?

852
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:59,631
I can't be seen with you, here, ever.
Not in England.

853
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,629
I don't want them to take your photograph.
They can't have you.

854
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,397
There's no need for that.
No need for that, Mitch!

855
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,351
Shall we go for a ride, Billy,
you and me?

856
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,879
Or are you gonna get the hell
out of here?

857
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,718
- You're fucked, mate.
- How's that, Billy?

858
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,878
Gant's got a hard-on for you.

859
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,911
- I ain't a fucking homosexual.
- Fuck this Gant's...

860
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:54,756
Fuck this Gant's homosexual shit.

861
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,276
If he is, if he is,
free country, isn't it?

862
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,871
I get you... I...
I get you the sweetest deal

863
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,599
and you shit all down it.
You just shit all down it.

864
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,355
Your head's all fucked up. Eh?

865
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,548
It's all fucked up in your head.
He said you owe him, you owe him.

866
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:15,079
I don't owe him anything.

867
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,070
Get out of here, Billy.

868
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,275
- Give us me some fucking keys then.
- One last thing.

869
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,796
Three years ago when I did that guy,
how did your hands look afterwards?

870
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,554
How did your hands look, Billy?
You think I didn't fucking know?

871
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,070
- You think I didn't fucking know, Billy?
- You're gone! You're gone, man!

872
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,717
- I'm talking to a zero!
- Don't come around here again!

873
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,514
Gant wants that motor. Wants it!

874
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,712
Wants that fucking...
Wants that Bacon painting.

875
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,114
- Wants it.
- It's not want he wants.

876
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,550
Watch out for a big Bosnian fucker!

877
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,278
Next time, he'll come!

878
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,197
Hey, hey, hey! Woah.

879
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,600
- Have a word. Don't be shy.
- Hey, what's the rush?

880
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,479
- Who do you think that is?
- Some cunt.

881
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,714
How do you feel about guns, Jordan?

882
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:16,915
My dear boy, I'm a trained actor.
I can feel anything about anything.

883
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,271
You took it from a passing philosopher,
I imagine.

884
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,630
You got somewhere to put it?

885
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,709
I do.

886
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:05,992
I need to borrow a car.

887
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,479
Why fuck around?

888
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,633
Hello, Billy.

889
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,835
- Fuckin' A!
- Get up! Get up!

890
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,955
Don't! Fuck! Fuck!

891
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:17,391
Come here! Come here!

892
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,919
We can...
We can work it out!

893
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,593
- You're hurting me.
- You were in my house, Billy,

894
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,757
- where I fucking live!
- He told me to go.

895
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,519
What happened to the owner
of my old place, Billy? Huh?

896
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,232
It was...
It ain't to frame you, I swear.

897
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,079
- The fuck it isn't.
- That fucking stupid bastard,

898
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,795
he went in and he tried to get in
to get some fucking clothes.

899
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,148
- Who?
- I don't know. I don't know.

900
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,317
Yeah. So, Gant lost it! Yeah,
you know like he done that night

901
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,558
with the fucking spade!
He fucking lost it.

902
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,752
Yeah, so he took the cunt down
to fucking Brighton.

903
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,155
He took him down, he fucked him
up the fucking arse

904
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:57,556
and he cut his fucking head off, man!

905
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,472
I swear, Gant will kill everybody!

906
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,070
Yeah, everyone who belongs to you,
I swear, everybody.

907
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,792
Does he know about my sister?

908
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,151
Everybody knows about your sister.

909
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,276
Come here! Come here!
Look at me, you cunt!

910
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,949
Mitch! Mitch! Mitchy, it's me,
you remember me?

911
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,676
You remember me,
you remember Billy, don't ya?

912
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,275
Come here.

913
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,075
No, no, no. That's Gant's money.
That's Gant's money, don't touch it.

914
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,839
No, it's not, Billy. No, it's not.
Just another fuckin' gangster, Billy.

915
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,036
All the money is mine.
All the fucking money is mine!

916
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,957
Don't! Give me that money.
I'll give you my own fucking money.

917
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,230
- Stay there!
- I'll give you my own fucking money.

918
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,478
What have you done to me?

919
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,917
- <i>Is he all done and dusted?</i>
- It's Mitchel.

920
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,274
And what physical condition
is that Billy in?

921
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,632
Can we talk a little business, Rob?

922
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,514
I don't feel we got
too much more to say.

923
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:59,631
Any more out of you and I'll be
paying you a fucking visit

924
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,239
and I'll cut your fucking throat!

925
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,429
- That's mine!
- Give me.

926
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,120
That's mine, you cunts!

927
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,718
Don't you love this place?
My friend owns it.

928
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,189
Alfons!

929
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,198
This is my sibling, Mitchel.
Mitchel, this is Alfons.

930
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,349
A pleasure.

931
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,473
I shall order for you both.

932
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,597
Yeah, all right,
but nothing nasty.

933
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,956
- That's Alfons.
- Without a doubt.

934
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,789
Have you been drinking?

935
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:40,276
Can we not talk about
anything important for a change?

936
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,510
Like the fact I've left Dr Raju.

937
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,234
No longer.
Me and Dr Raju, <i>finito.</i>

938
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,518
You took his PIN number?

939
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,712
- What?
- His PIN number?

940
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,038
Money, money, money,
it's all you ever talk about.

941
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,116
- Your tie's undone.
- Yeah, it's been a long day.

942
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,277
Listen.
There are some people after me.

943
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,391
- And they might try and hurt you.
- Ooh!

944
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,995
- Yeah.
- Ooh!

945
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:11,118
Very much so. So I want you out
of the country until I settle something.

946
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,749
Well, the world's got an infinite
number of places, could be anywhere.

947
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,388
Yeah, one of them's Paris.
Here, a train ticket.

948
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,873
Ooh, Paris!

949
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:24,193
All right. But I'm going to need
more money than my usual.

950
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,912
- None.
- Of course.

951
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,632
- Yeah?
- No excuses.

952
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,069
And stay there, right.
Until I call.

953
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,790
You're not my dad, all right?

954
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,594
Alfons, can we get...

955
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:41,192
What should we have...
Two triple Sambucas on fire.

956
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,231
- Briony.
- Make sure they're on fire.

957
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,269
I like it when you take care of me.

958
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,395
I love you.

959
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,231
- Don't miss the train.
- What?

960
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,477
Mitchel, I'm not going to drink,
I promise I won't drink.

961
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,431
I promise I won't drink!

962
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,358
Yeah, can I get my Sambucas please, Alfons?

963
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,515
- You haven't been anywhere.
- Not yet.

964
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,918
I've taken a job.

965
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:32,039
That's good.

966
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,988
- I have to go to LA.
- Get out of London.

967
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:46,355
- Yeah, it doesn't suit me.
- Right.

968
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,478
Will you come with me?

969
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:55,069
There's something I have to do first.

970
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,752
But you'll come to America?

971
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:02,913
Yeah, I will.

972
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,754
- Heard of the Chateau Marmont?
- Yeah.

973
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,555
They have a list, it doesn't exist.

974
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,513
Your name will be on it.

975
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,789
<i>Watch out for a big Bosnian fucker!</i>

976
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,433
<i>Next time, he'll come!</i>

977
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,272
You have a visitor.

978
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:58,109
I'm not sure how to say this,

979
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,434
but it's the sort of thing a celebrity

980
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,028
really cannot afford to have
in the newspapers.

981
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,316
What are we going to do with him?

982
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,951
Billy's get found dead everywhere.

983
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,955
I'm going to need your help.
Are you able?

984
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,873
If I can poison a producer
with his own Quaaludes,

985
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,275
I should say I'm equal
to just about anything.

986
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:30,870
Compared to most people,
I'm a fucking Borgia Pope.

987
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,235
<i>What do you intend to do
about this Bosnian fucker?</i>

988
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,834
<i>This Storbor?</i>

989
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,520
<i>Kill him.
Kill who hired him.</i>

990
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:44,029
<i>We're gonna need a fuck
of a lot of drugs.</i>

991
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,912
<i>You have found your man.</i>

992
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,555
<i>Right.</i>

993
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,349
I am what I say I am.

994
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,955
Lads!

995
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,472
I hear you've been looking for me.

996
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:43,312
You have balls, my friend.
I'll buy you a drink.

997
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,271
No, I want to do a deal.

998
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,436
Did you find something
at your house, huh?

999
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,677
That was a funny thing you did.
I like your style.

1000
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,919
- You coming?
- As long as my new friend comes too.

1001
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,918
- You're so fucked, mate!
- Yeah, why not.

1002
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,712
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1003
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,877
You ever heard of the Beatles?

1004
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:34,874
<i>Niet.</i>

1005
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,593
John Lennon was me uncle.

1006
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,118
Who's this wanker?

1007
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:48,119
I love you.

1008
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,637
- What did you want to talk about?
- We talk or you're getting paid.

1009
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,431
- Yeah.
- What does he mean, getting paid?

1010
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,873
Does everyone get this high?

1011
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,671
What do you mean, getting paid?

1012
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:15,271
As in, you do Gant, I'll double it.

1013
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,396
Have you got the balls to kill Gant?

1014
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,958
I have killed babies.

1015
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,718
That's good to know.

1016
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,989
Let it happen, mate.
You're done.

1017
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,275
Mr Mitchel, look,
I won't say anything!

1018
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:12,238
It's not just grass.

1019
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,309
Fuck!

1020
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,759
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Briony, where are you?

1021
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,395
- I'm in Paris, where else?
- Good girl. Stay there, all right?

1022
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,515
All right.

1023
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,629
Breathe.

1024
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,155
Fuck!

1025
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:51,995
Briony?

1026
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:20,513
Where's Briony?

1027
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,553
Well, well, well.

1028
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,478
What lovely surprises.

1029
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,516
Oh, you have no fucking idea.

1030
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,716
Thank you for coming in.

1031
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,195
Would you get down there, please?

1032
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,475
What the fuck are you doing?
That's just dope, mate.

1033
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,715
Please.

1034
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,274
Right here. Right here.

1035
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,070
Yes?

1036
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:40,597
- How the fuck did you get in?
- Your missus let me in.

1037
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,119
I've got 60 grand here.
In this room.

1038
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,395
Get it.

1039
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:12,639
Don't open it.

1040
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,908
- Why not?
- Because there's a fucking gun in it.

1041
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:17,839
Out you come.

1042
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,154
Get into bed.

1043
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,391
You and me could be great.

1044
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,439
People will remember us.

1045
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,669
- It's funny what you remember.
- Oh, yeah.

1046
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,670
I wrote a poem for a girl once,

1047
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,035
she signed her name to it
and gave it to her other boyfriend.

1048
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,270
What's that got to do with me?

1049
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,633
My client has no knowledge
of any of these matters.

1050
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:44,875
At the time of the incident,

1051
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,639
my client was already in transit
to the United States.

1052
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,952
Heard you'd been looking for me.

1053
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,508
<i>This is a matter for
the London Metropolitan Police.</i>

1054
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,119
<i>No further questions at this time.</i>
