1
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,600
Xiao-Qing

2
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,299
Sis?

3
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,275
I almost lost control again.

4
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,661
I have practiced the mystic arts for five hundred years,

5
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:59,325
will soon be transcendent and archive immortality.

6
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,950
But every time I tried, I failed.

7
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,150
Yes.

8
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,876
You were risking your life all the time.

9
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,650
In my heart,

10
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:29,150
there is a hollow.

11
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:32,575
Am I missing something?

12
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,617
Every time I was about to transcend,

13
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:37,650
Something would shatter my mind and throw me into chaos.

14
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,198
What do I miss?

15
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:50,374
Hold it.

16
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,650
This Jade Hairpin? You've been wearing it all the time,

17
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,950
and never allow me to touch it.

18
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,400
Now you can touch it.

19
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:02,225
It belongs to you, in the first place.

20
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,150
Hold it tightly.

21
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:27,500
【Five hundred years ago】

22
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,750
It was in the late Tang Dynasty, the world was slipping into chaos.

23
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,950
It was in the late Tang Dynasty, the world was slipping into chaos.

24
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Demons and monsters were haunting the human world.

25
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:34,825
The Emperor was obsessed with the idea of achieving immortality,

26
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,450
But Lord of Greater Yin, the Supreme Taoist, failed him repeatedly.

27
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:39,175
The Emperor was furious.

28
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,575
The Supreme Taoist commanded the people to catch snakes for him

29
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,150
and used snakes to enhance his power

30
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,900
to regain the Emperor's favor.

31
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:27,150
[Chanting] I have prepared myself, guide the Spirits to my flesh.

32
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,500
[Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body.

33
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:39,575
[Chanting] I have prepared myself, guide the Spirits to my flesh.

34
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:44,825
[Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body.

35
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,602
Assassin!

36
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,975
Assassin is on the bow, catch her!

37
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,775
The archers are in position!

38
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,252
Where does she go?

39
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,075
Ah, you're here, miss.

40
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:16,900
Who are you?

41
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,575
I know it's chaotic outside,

42
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,600
but don't be afraid.

43
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,325
Where is this place?

44
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,950
Here is the snakecatcher village.

45
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,225
What's your name? Where do you live?

46
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:31,325
I...

47
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:47,850
Miss, is there anything you can remember?

48
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,075
Ah, snakecatchers are back.

49
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,575
It was Xuan who brought you here yesterday.

50
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:57,950
Xuan?

51
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,475
Most of villagers here live by catching snakes.

52
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:05,450
We built our village like this,

53
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,650
it's because there are lots of beasts in the woods around the village.

54
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,275
it said there are also demons out there.

55
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,825
I'm a demon, I'm gonna eat you!

56
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,224
Ah, demon is coming! You have no place to run!

57
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,575
Be careful, watch your step.

58
00:08:16,575 --> 00:08:17,325
Auntie!

59
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:19,325
The herbs collected by Xuan worked great!

60
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:20,400
My injury has almost healed!

61
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,700
Be careful next time, it's very dangerous to catch snakes.

62
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,575
Wow! See how pretty that girl is?

63
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,700
Sister Hua, could you hand me a jar of realgar wine?

64
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,150
Those wine are great,right? They mixed a lot realgar with them.

65
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:31,825
Miss? Shall we go?

66
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,650
Xu Xuan! you are the last, again!

67
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:42,950
Just stay outside, live with snakes.

68
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:07,675
It's brother Xuan!

69
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,325
You are awake!

70
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,825
Dudou?

71
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,950
Why are you hiding here?

72
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:31,950
Xuan, you haven't caught any snake, have you?

73
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,350
Do you want my snakes?

74
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,325
Ha! Why do you want to join with us, since you are so afraid of snakes?

75
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,200
Those herbs you collected could not be used to deduct your tax.

76
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,825
Although I can't use them to deduct tax, to save some lives, that's enough for me.

77
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,200
Brother Xuan is back!

78
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,125
Do you bring toys for us?

79
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,325
Look at this and this.

80
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:46,825
Who wants this?

81
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,825
Miss?

82
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,575
Xuan, she can't remember anything.

83
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,325
Miss

84
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,700
Don't worry, everything will be OK.

85
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,525
I can take you to the place where I found you, tomorrow.

86
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,325
Maybe we can find some clues.

87
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,325
Nowadays, we are catching snakes down there.

88
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,325
Why do you catch snakes?

89
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
In last few years, the country was in turmoil,

90
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:32,800
Our taxes were getting heavier and heavier.

91
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,075
The Supreme Taoist allows us to use snakes to deduct our taxes,

92
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,575
and said people who catches snakes will be free from his servitude.

93
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,075
So, villagers began to catch snakes.

94
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,325
Catching snakes is a tough job,

95
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,825
if you don't do it,

96
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,475
life will be much tougher than now.

97
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,325
Look, it was under that waterfall.

98
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:54,325
I know it's a short cut, Dudou.

99
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,325
But it's already difficult enough for us to climb.

100
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:58,075
What shall we do with her?

101
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:03,850
Dudou!

102
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,075
You know magic!

103
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,325
I will go there by myself.

104
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:28,100
Take you time to climb.

105
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,575
Dodou, we can't let her wait us,

106
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:35,900
can we?

107
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,900
Dudou?

108
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,950
Just head home!

109
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,075
It is really a great thing to have magic.

110
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:25,400
It seems that you must be one of those who practice mysitc arts.

111
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,400
I can't recall anything.

112
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,325
What is this place?

113
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,575
This is the hut I built.

114
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,825
Usually I will make some small stuffs here.

115
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:34,950
or dry my herbs.

116
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:36,775
Maybe one day I can be a doctor,

117
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:38,075
then I won't have to catch snakes anymore.

118
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
Bao-An-Tang

119
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,275
Why do you call it Bao An Tang?

120
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:44,225
This?

121
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,900
It's just a plaque I found near river.

122
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,825
Speak of that, at that day I was making umbrellas

123
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,325
when I suddenly heard Dodou was barking.

124
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:51,350
When I got there,

125
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,350
I saw you were lying on a rock by the waterfall,

126
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,575
Half of your body was in water.

127
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,100
For the sake of everyone,

128
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,225
I have to command you to assassin the Supreme Taoist.

129
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,425
Master, I know he is our enemy,

130
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,650
The brothers and sisters will thank you.

131
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,725
But I've just finished my trainning.

132
00:13:09,725 --> 00:13:10,775
There are rules in this world.

133
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:13,325
There are lots of things you have to do even if you don't want to.

134
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,075
Did you just recall something?

135
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,075
Xuan,

136
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,825
Is there something you don't want to do,

137
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,325
but you have to do?

138
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,075
me?

139
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,525
I have tons of those things.

140
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,350
But, since I'm living in this world,

141
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,350
I definitely want to experience this world carefreely.

142
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,700
So, I try to learn a bit of everything.

143
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,350
Medicine, divination, Astrology, Occult, Five elements and Eight Trigrams.

144
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,300
I know a little bit of all those things.

145
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,575
Even if I can't choice my destiny,

146
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,150
I shall make my life carefree.

147
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,400
[Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body.

148
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Are you all right?

149
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:09,850
I'm flying.

150
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:14,025
I'm flying right now!

151
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:17,350
You!

152
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:19,025
You see!

153
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,550
It feels so good!

154
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,525
I'm riding the wind,

155
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,400
freely wondering between heaven and earth!

156
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,800
Xuan!

157
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,825
It's okay. I'm cling on this.

158
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:37,825
What is it?

159
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,575
Come up, we can talk it later.

160
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,150
OK

161
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,475
Miss?

162
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,900
Isn't she the assassin the Supreme Taoist wanted?

163
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,450
Indeed, it's her.

164
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,075
Supreme Taoist?

165
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:19,050
Asssassin?

166
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:19,850
Be careful, it could e atrap

167
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,075
Let's cut off one of her hands before she wakes up

168
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,825
Who is here?

169
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,600
This Jade Hairpin,

170
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,450
You can bring it with.

171
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:13,075
It seems this hairpin has something to do with me.

172
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,675
You are awake.

173
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,150
It looks like a magic weapon.

174
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,075
But I don't know how to use it.

175
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,575
Preicous Jade

176
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,075
Preicous Jade?

177
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,375
Preicous Jade

178
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,575
Preicous Jade

179
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:42,275
Preicous Jade Workshop!

180
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,325
What's that?

181
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,375
I have heard of this place.

182
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,575
It's in the ginkgo woods just outside Yongzhou City

183
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:49,075
It's a unremarkable workshop,

184
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:50,825
but they have some extremely skillful craftmen.

185
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,325
Your hairpin is from there.

186
00:17:52,325 --> 00:17:53,825
We can go to there and ask them for its details.

187
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:56,325
Thank you, Xuan.

188
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,575
Actually, you don't have to help me,

189
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,950
you don't even know who I am.

190
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,575
Although I don't know who you are,

191
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,825
I think

192
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:07,200
You're not a wicked people.

193
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,975
We bring the order from the Supreme Taoist.

194
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,325
Open your gate!

195
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,325
I need everyone to be present!

196
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:20,075
Supreme Taoist...

197
00:18:20,825 --> 00:18:21,775
Those two soldiers

198
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,325
Hurry, we shall leave.

199
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:48,450
Your honor, snakes are extremely hard to find this year.

200
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,225
We are risking lives to...

201
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:55,075
Nowadays, the world is in turmoil, demons are haunting the country.

202
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,075
As the Supreme Taoist, my Master

203
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,575
works hard on this magic, slays demons for the country.

204
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:01,775
Yes, we understand, demons will eat human's flesh,

205
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,950
and kill people without thinking.

206
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,950
It's an honor to have Supreme Taoist to proctect us.

207
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,075
But, tonight, I'm here to find out,

208
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,150
Whose umbrella is it?

209
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,725
also

210
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:17,950
Is there a unknown woman in white in your village?

211
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:19,950
Speak!

212
00:19:25,175 --> 00:19:28,225
Don't worry, as long as you tell me the truth,

213
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:29,525
you won't be harmed.

214
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,150
Yes, yes, I will tell you.

215
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:33,975
I saw her was with Xu Xuan.

216
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,575
Search the village.

217
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:39,325
Yes

218
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,425
How long shall we hide here? Everyone is anxious and scared.

219
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,075
Such important task,

220
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:03,575
Master should send me to do it.

221
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:04,850
The scout is back!

222
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,975
Is it really she who injured you?

223
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,150
Yes.

224
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,925
Not just injured me,

225
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:27,125
she almost killed me.

226
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,150
Als, I don't know why,

227
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,975
The Supreme Taoist's fleet is coming in this way.

228
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Master,

229
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,575
She must has turned to that Taoist,

230
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,325
betrayed us.

231
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:41,500
And Master, there was a snakecatcher by her side.

232
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,575
And Master, there was a snakecatcher by her side.

233
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,400
They acted as if they were lovers.

234
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,075
Really?

235
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,125
Master

236
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,100
The mysitc art I taught you

237
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,875
is meant to let you help each other,

238
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,975
Share your power, merge them into the source.

239
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,450
We will share our weal and woe together.

240
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:26,850
Thank you, Master.

241
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,500
Thank you, my brothers and sisters.

242
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,950
I have restored my power.

243
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:30,825
Master

244
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:32,850
Thet White Snake must have betrayed us.

245
00:21:32,975 --> 00:21:33,450
Otherwise...

246
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,475
Master, Sister won't betray us.

247
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:39,575
Please let me to bring her home.

248
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,475
You?

249
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,100
Everyone knows you two are close.

250
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
Master,

251
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,325
please curse me with the Scroching Death Scales.

252
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:55,825
In three days, bring her and the Jade Hairpin back here.

253
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,600
Otherwise, the Death Scales will be activated,

254
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,050
and even I can not save your life.

255
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:00,575
Understand.

256
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,075
Chang-Pan

257
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:10,575
So, those things belong to that boy, right?

258
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,825
Tell my Master, lead him to here.

259
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:19,575
Yes

260
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,325
If I could drain her power,

261
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,100
I won't need you villagers to catch snakes anymore.

262
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:52,575
We will be Yongzhou City soon.

263
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:58,075
Are you still trying to recall your past?

264
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,325
It's indeed inconvenient if a person can't remember her past.

265
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,650
Where has she been? who has she meet?

266
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,075
What has she done?

267
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,325
However,

268
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,100
Some things are better left forgotten than remembered.

269
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,550
It said, just as the blooming flowers and the withering grasses,

270
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,200
life is fleeting, filled with odreals and seldom happiness.

271
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,575
If so,

272
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,650
we only need to remember those happiness, and everything will be fine.

273
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,850
Captain

274
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,575
the song you sang is too old fashion.

275
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,100
It's outdated for a long time.

276
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,650
Let me try something new.

277
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,075
Ok, let you sing.

278
00:23:54,225 --> 00:24:01,925
<i>Can't you see the river which flows to the east,</i>

279
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,850
<i>No one knows where it comes from,</i>

280
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,900
<i>no one knows where it goes to.</i>

281
00:24:13,425 --> 00:24:20,700
<i>Can't you see the sun which hangs over the city?</i>

282
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:25,950
<i>It will disappears behind hills tonight,</i>

283
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,625
<i>and will rise again tomorrow morning.</i>

284
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:38,300
<i>Why bother yourself with those earthly affairs?</i>

285
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:45,825
<i>I just realize this floating life is a dream.</i>

286
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:53,050
Why bother yourself with those earthly affairs?
 

287
00:24:53,225 --> 00:25:00,325
<i>This floating life is but a dream.</i>

288
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,825
It's great.

289
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:05,450
You are right

290
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:08,100
But, even if the floating life is a dream,

291
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,825
to have times like this,

292
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,925
it's still great.

293
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,825
If you like me, I meant it.

294
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,900
I can teach you

295
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:16,575
Ok.

296
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,925
Have you learned it?

297
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:54,400
Let's sing together.

298
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,575
Don't worry, don't worry, we have plenty time to try.

299
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,100
A woman with unknown past,

300
00:26:13,225 --> 00:26:15,475
A power with unknown soruce,

301
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,325
What if I'm a demon?

302
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,125
Demon?

303
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,825
It's said demons are monsterous beings,

304
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,975
feed on human's flesh and vitality.

305
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,450
How can you be a demon?

306
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,825
Even if you are a demon, so what?

307
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:30,325
For example...

308
00:26:30,325 --> 00:26:31,075
Dudou!

309
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,075
Even if Dudou turns into a demon, I still like him.

310
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:36,925
And even as a demon, he will like me.

311
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,400
Right?

312
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,775
Really?

313
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,600
Never said that,

314
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
I'm just trying to earn a living.

315
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,100
Why can I speak now?

316
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,350
Why am I speaking now? How can I speak?

317
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,450
I'm not supposed to speak!

318
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,575
What if I'm treated as a demon, and slayed by a Taoist, because I can talk?

319
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,225
Why does my voice sound like this? Why does my voice sound like this?

320
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:01,150
Shh, quite.

321
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:01,725
The boatman will hear you.

322
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:02,975
I don't want to speak.

323
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,200
Be careful!

324
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,650
There are some rapids,

325
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,875
don't fall over.

326
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,325
You really turn to human.

327
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:48,350
I will kill your!

328
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,700
Captin!

329
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:10,950
Look out

330
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,950
Cold...

331
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,225
Xuan! Xuan!

332
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:05,575
Let's go, right now!

333
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,975
I'm talking to you,

334
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,975
Xuan, let's go, hurry!

335
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,075
Xuan!

336
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:26,825
What are you doing!

337
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,450
Aren't you afraid of snakes?

338
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,100
She's a snake demon!

339
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,950
Shut up!

340
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,575
I won't leave her here alone.

341
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,075
I don't care, I'm leaving.

342
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,325
Dudou, Why did he hug me?

343
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,575
Your body were as cold as ice.

344
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:01,350
Xuan was worried, so he hugged you,

345
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,075
used himself as a stove,

346
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:04,650
so you can wake up.

347
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,850
It was so cold that the whole room was frozen.

348
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:09,850
We didn't left you behind. You know?

349
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,975
You are here.

350
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,900
I thought you left without a goodbye.

351
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,300
That tail...

352
00:31:53,675 --> 00:31:55,850
I'm really a monster.

353
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,600
What then?

354
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:02,075
There are plenty of wicked people with two legs in this world,

355
00:32:02,925 --> 00:32:04,650
you just have a tail, so what?

356
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,425
You are not a wicked people.

357
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,325
Your honors

358
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:47,925
my families took great pains to flee to here,

359
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:49,325
please offer me some foods.

360
00:32:49,325 --> 00:32:51,325
Why are there so many stinky beggars in the city?

361
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:54,400
Don't stand there, get out of the way!

362
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,450
Those refugees...

363
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,975
they are so pitiful.

364
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,825
They're the lucky ones.

365
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,825
At least, they can find some shelters in Yongzhou City.

366
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:17,825
What happened?

367
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:19,225
Nothing...

368
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,700
Let's go.

369
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,075
Hey! A dog is still here.

370
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,900
<b>【 Precious Jade Workshop 】</b>

371
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,450
Faster!

372
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,650
Feels I have been here before.

373
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,825
Mu, Li, Position No. 31.

374
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:51,350
Stop!

375
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,600
Ah, we have guests.

376
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,125
Why do you come back to my humble abode, dear?

377
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,650
Is there something wrong with your magic weapon?

378
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:09,450
Yes.

379
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,200
We want to know the origin of this magic weapon.

380
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:21,925
Interesting

381
00:34:27,225 --> 00:34:28,725
Although you are a human,

382
00:34:28,725 --> 00:34:28,750
you smell like a demon.

383
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,575
you smell like a demon.

384
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:38,950
Ah, you have been intimate with a demon, haven't you?

385
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,725
In this case,

386
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:46,850
come.

387
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:15,075
All kinds of demons within a hundred miles

388
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:18,575
if they need a presonal magic weapon for their task,

389
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,900
will visit our Pericous Jade Workshop.

390
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,575
We are the forging shop for demon's weapon.

391
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:57,825
Go to work

392
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,825
This Jade Hairpin is not yours, it belonged someone else.

393
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,325
It designed to drain other's power,

394
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:23,150
and transfer them to its owner.

395
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,850
Draining power?

396
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,375
Right.

397
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:29,300
This thing, is quite formidable.

398
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:45,100
Last time you were here, dear, you wanted to modify it,

399
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,575
so that you can use it.

400
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:49,450
Approve.

401
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,625
Approve.

402
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,350
No way.

403
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,100
But, the modfication may cause some unknown problems.

404
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,800
No wonder.

405
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,125
She lost her memory when I met her.

406
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,825
Ah...That's right.

407
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:08,825
It took someone's power, but,

408
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,975
But it may also took the memory of its owner.

409
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,600
Without memory,

410
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,075
how can someone control his power?

411
00:37:20,225 --> 00:37:21,675
It's the way of this world,

412
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,525
for every gain, a loss.

413
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:27,400
Wonderful, wonderful.

414
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,350
Then, why you...

415
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:30,350
But she insisted.

416
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,875
And I, the old fox, have some self-pride.

417
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:36,075
Tricks like grafting magic,

418
00:37:36,075 --> 00:37:37,600
altering the world,

419
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,475
turning a human into a demon,

420
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,800
turning a demon into a human, and other Heaven-defying things,

421
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
we have interests in.

422
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:49,600
Then, about its original owner,

423
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:51,475
could you help us to find some clues?

424
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:54,225
Of course

425
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,575
What a large scale.

426
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:28,575
Her magic is powerful, and share the same source as mine.

427
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,825
I know it's a snake scale.

428
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,075
Snake?

429
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,200
Snake-catcher!

430
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:14,225
Xiao-Bai!

431
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:19,575
Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai... Xiao-Bai...

432
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:20,825
Xiao-Qing?

433
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,075
Xiao-Bai?

434
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,475
Xiao-Qing!

435
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,075
You are Xiao-Qing.

436
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,825
I...

437
00:39:34,825 --> 00:39:36,575
I recall who I am.

438
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,825
That day, Master gave the Jade Hairpin to you,

439
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,825
command you to assassinate the Supreme Taoist,

440
00:39:47,975 --> 00:39:50,700
Can't you remember those things, Sis?

441
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,200
Why does Supreme Taoist ask people to catch snakes?

442
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:59,575
That bastard Taoist is practicing the art of Greater Yin,

443
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:01,200
it shares the same source of snake clan.

444
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,400
He drains the souls and essences of our snakes to boost his power.

445
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:08,700
Master loathes Supreme Taoist, loathes all the people.

446
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:11,325
As Master said, human are vicious.

447
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,825
Everyone of them is vicious.

448
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,575
But he is different.

449
00:40:16,175 --> 00:40:19,575
When I lost my memory, I didn't have any clues.

450
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:21,825
It was he saved me.

451
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,850
No matter how different it is, he is still a human!

452
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,075
Turns out that Supreme Taoist has practiced such wicked art.

453
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,725
Hypocritical!

454
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:30,575
You're a snakecatcher, you's accomplice

455
00:40:30,575 --> 00:40:31,775
I really don't know what Supreme Taoist did.

456
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:33,450
Accomplices must die.

457
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,900
What do you want?

458
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,475
Xiao-Qing, let him go.

459
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,150
Xuan!

460
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,825
As a snakecatcher,

461
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,825
perseveringly followed sis all the way,

462
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,075
you must plot something!

463
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,575
As a little demon, so fierce,

464
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:56,975
it's not good for your practice.

465
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,725
You!

466
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:00,350
Speak!

467
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,575
What are you plotting?

468
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,100
You're really assisting Taoist of Greater Yin.

469
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,925
I don't know what Taoist of Greater Yin, Greater Yang.

470
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,700
I don't know what happened to this cake, either.

471
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,100
Sis, see, he is with Supreme Taoist.

472
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,950
I believe him.

473
00:41:29,125 --> 00:41:30,450
Believe?

474
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,125
I don't believe!

475
00:41:35,975 --> 00:41:37,475
I will kill you, snake catcher.

476
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,400
Look out!

477
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:46,200
Dodge!

478
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,200
Sis, haven't you forgotten what Master taught you over and over again?

479
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,350
Human are cunning liars and robbers.

480
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,350
Xiao-Qing,

481
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:57,700
Although I can't remember that,

482
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,350
I have seen all the things with my own eyes,

483
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,150
he's absolutely not.

484
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,775
I still remember that!

485
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,325
Come with me

486
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,150
Be careful.

487
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:11,650
There is something wrong with this place.

488
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,075
I never thought,

489
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:31,100
there is such a secret passage under this pagoda.

490
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:38,000
We have to find a way out.

491
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,700
Xiao-Bai!

492
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,100
Xiao-Bai!

493
00:43:34,225 --> 00:43:35,800
Vermilion Bird is on the top, Black Tortoise is in the center.

494
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,350
The center repesents Internal Trigram, the gates repesent External trigram.

495
00:43:37,624 --> 00:43:38,275
Eight different gates.

496
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,275
Gate of Life

497
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,225
The Gate of Life is in this way.

498
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:02,200
Don't worry,

499
00:44:03,275 --> 00:44:05,225
We passed through the Gate of Life, it's safe now.

500
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,825
What is this place?

501
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,600
It seems

502
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,825
this is an underground magical trap used to imprison demons,

503
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,825
but it can't harm human.

504
00:44:24,925 --> 00:44:27,825
Why is there a underground trap created by Taoists?

505
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,750
Maybe it was a Taoist temple at the first place, but became desolate.

506
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,775
Others altered it into a tower.

507
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,075
Don't worry

508
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,825
I can figure out how the trap works.

509
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:41,075
I'm sure we can get out.

510
00:44:41,925 --> 00:44:44,675
Now, I'll find a way out. Stay here, wait for me.

511
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,950
The Heaven and Earth follow the same rule, everythings in this world are from the same source.

512
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,075
We shall conquer millions of trails, to prove our righteous belief.

513
00:45:07,675 --> 00:45:10,775
Ghosts and demons shall be terrorized, Spirits and monsters shall be disintegrated.

514
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:14,450
Slay monsters and extinguish demons, destory their bodys and shatter their souls.

515
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,175
[Chanting] Let the Greater Yin gather the Power I need, be the place to forge my body.

516
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:29,600
I prepared this magic weapon for years,

517
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:30,975
Bring it with you,

518
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:32,850
and assassinate the Lord of Greater Yin.

519
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,600
Miss?

520
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,725
I recall everything now.

521
00:45:49,975 --> 00:45:51,650
I've found the way out. Let's go.

522
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,575
Xuan...

523
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,850
Are demons destined to be slayed?

524
00:45:59,225 --> 00:46:00,350
Xiao-Bai...

525
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,225
You...

526
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:14,350
Slaying monsters, extinguishing demons, forcing us to catch snakes,

527
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:16,850
but nobody cares the world is in turmoil.

528
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,975
I only know that the more we slay demons,

529
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:20,475
the more chaotic the world is.

530
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:23,725
Xiao-Bai

531
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:25,850
no matter what happens,

532
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,850
I will be with you.

533
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,750
Slay monsters and extinguish demons, destory their bodys and shatter their souls.

534
00:48:05,725 --> 00:48:06,500
Dodou...

535
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,100
You...

536
00:48:14,175 --> 00:48:15,225
Sis?

537
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,250
Xiao-Qing,

538
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,350
I'll go with you.

539
00:48:18,725 --> 00:48:20,475
Sis, you finally understood.

540
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,175
Where are you going?

541
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,675
Xuan

542
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,100
Let's separate.

543
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,100
Why?

544
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,475
The way of this world are merciless.

545
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,100
There are rules in this world.

546
00:48:33,725 --> 00:48:35,225
There are things you have to do,

547
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:38,225
even if you don't want to.

548
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,850
You are a human.

549
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,600
I am a demon.

550
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,350
As you said,

551
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,350
Some things are better left forgotten than remembered.

552
00:48:57,925 --> 00:48:59,350
You're right.

553
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:01,850
Human and demon are different, the way of this world cares nothing about love.

554
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,200
But we care.

555
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,600
I will find a way.

556
00:49:14,675 --> 00:49:16,075
I'll come back

557
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:18,225
Wait for me

558
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,425
You are a human.

559
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,100
Being with me will only ruin you.

560
00:49:48,975 --> 00:49:52,100
Sis, he won't come back.

561
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,725
We shall go now.

562
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,350
Sis...

563
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:03,975
We have accompanied each other day and night for hundreds years.

564
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,250
But it feels different,

565
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:09,850
with him.

566
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,350
Through hard practicing

567
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,850
and lots of ordeals,

568
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:26,125
we demons try so hard to gain these attractive bodys,

569
00:50:26,225 --> 00:50:28,350
these delicate features.

570
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,425
But we will always reveal our ture self, from time to time.

571
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:39,000
At that time, will he still like you?

572
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,350
I remember that Master said,

573
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,850
only human understand the taste of love and desires.

574
00:50:49,175 --> 00:50:51,975
When I woke up, I thought I was a human.

575
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,750
What's good about the taste of love and desires?

576
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:00,350
Right now, I'm lying here,

577
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,725
this big stone statue holds me in its arms,

578
00:51:03,475 --> 00:51:05,425
it also feels good.

579
00:51:06,475 --> 00:51:08,475
The stone statue is cold.

580
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,250
So Am I ?

581
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:17,800
What's that on you body?

582
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,850
Don't touch me.

583
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,850
It's the curse of Sorching Death Scales.

584
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,100
I promised Master

585
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:26,100
that I would take you back to the cave in three days.

586
00:51:26,225 --> 00:51:27,100
Otherwise...

587
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,100
The Death Scales will be activated, and it will tear up your body and kill you.

588
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,725
Why did you...

589
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:33,600
Hurry up, surround the tower.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

590
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
Sis...

591
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,350
Youth,

592
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:40,225
I can help you.

593
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,925
Really?

594
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:44,825
Youth,

595
00:51:44,825 --> 00:51:49,150
I had been young, been frivolous, been indulgent,

596
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,925
and I am filled with lots of regrets nowadays.

597
00:51:55,825 --> 00:51:57,225
You shall know

598
00:51:57,225 --> 00:52:00,425
One day, you might be regret for this.

599
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:01,600
If we can't be together

600
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,350
I'll regret it immediately.

601
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,850
Great, youth is youth.

602
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,650
For every bussiness, there is an offer and payment.

603
00:52:10,975 --> 00:52:14,275
Are you sure you can pay me with what I want?

604
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,050
Whatever you want.

605
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,850
Good.

606
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,100
There is a way.

607
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,350
I can turn you into a demon.

608
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,850
I, demon?

609
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:26,325
Yes, demon.

610
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:30,350
If you are a demon, you can be together.

611
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,350
However

612
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,450
You have to trade with your essence.

613
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:42,950
The magic weapons we created for all kinds of demons

614
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,075
are perfused with essences of human.

615
00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:48,150
Those greatest of magic weapon

616
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,825
are forged with the essences.

617
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:56,200
This is why our Preicous Jade is so famous in the demon world.

618
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:59,100
I need to become a demon.

619
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,600
I accept.

620
00:53:01,975 --> 00:53:02,950
Great.

621
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,850
But, do you know,

622
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,000
what will happen if you become a demon?

623
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,700
You are born to be a human,

624
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,150
enjoy the peace and comforts of the human world,

625
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,350
take them for granted without knowing why.

626
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:21,825
Being a demon,

627
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,225
Heaven wants you died.

628
00:53:23,225 --> 00:53:24,575
Human wants you died.

629
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:26,125
The Taoist wants to kill you.

630
00:53:26,125 --> 00:53:29,100
Other demons also will kill you.

631
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:32,850
Once I take away your essence,

632
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,850
being a demon,

633
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:37,225
You can only be the weakest and littlest kind.

634
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,725
No matter how hard you try, you can not become powerful.

635
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:42,575
I understand now.

636
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,650
Let's do it.

637
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:45,075
Good

638
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,000
We have a deal.

639
00:54:14,675 --> 00:54:16,075
Ah, I almost forgot,

640
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,325
To turn a human into a demon

641
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:21,325
I also need to take one thing from you.

642
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,825
What thing?

643
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:27,825
No, No, you can't

644
00:54:27,925 --> 00:54:29,500
Let him go.

645
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,200
Beauty, we meet again

646
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,175
What's the secret of this hairpin

647
00:54:48,175 --> 00:54:49,500
that let a little demon as you

648
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,800
dare to assassinate my Master?

649
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:56,775
A snake that have become a snake demon,

650
00:54:56,775 --> 00:55:00,075
draining your power to enhance the art of Greater Yin that my Master taught

651
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:02,475
will be better than draining thousands of snakes.

652
00:55:02,475 --> 00:55:03,075
You...!

653
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:06,850
So I told my Master

654
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,600
that you are in Snake-catcher Village

655
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:12,550
Now, Master should arrive there soon.

656
00:55:13,575 --> 00:55:15,675
Since I can capture you by myself.

657
00:55:15,675 --> 00:55:18,100
How should I share with my Master?

658
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,350
You little Taoist have so many wicked ideas.

659
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,325
But thanks for your informations,

660
00:55:23,325 --> 00:55:24,950
once we beat you,

661
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,250
then we'll deal with your Master.

662
00:55:26,725 --> 00:55:27,350
Hum...

663
00:56:09,275 --> 00:56:11,725
Ah, it turns out that you're a so ugly Taoist.

664
00:56:12,225 --> 00:56:14,225
No wonder you got jealous,

665
00:56:14,225 --> 00:56:16,725
once you see the beautiful statue in the tower,

666
00:56:16,725 --> 00:56:19,425
and smashed him.

667
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:35,250
Let's see how you will get out of my trap.

668
00:58:02,325 --> 00:58:04,325
Xuan, Xuan

669
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,450
Wake up

670
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,675
Xuan, Xuan

671
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:12,175
Xuan

672
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,600
It's still here, still here.

673
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:25,075
How are you feeling?

674
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:34,350
Dudou!

675
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:35,550
You have a tail now!

676
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:36,550
Look!

677
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,350
I'm a demon now!

678
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,075
Yes, you have a tail now!

679
00:58:40,075 --> 00:58:41,825
Dudou, where is your tail?

680
00:58:41,825 --> 00:58:43,325
What about my tail?

681
00:58:43,325 --> 00:58:44,825
Where is my tail!

682
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:46,225
Turns out it was Dudou's tail.

683
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,425
My tail!

684
00:58:47,425 --> 00:58:48,475
Yours!

685
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:49,825
See, Dudou,

686
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:50,775
we're all demons now.

687
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,200
From now on, if I get good stuffs,

688
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,150
there will be your share.

689
00:58:57,625 --> 00:58:58,575
Let's go, Dudou!

690
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:03,825
Dudou!

691
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:05,175
I'm running so fast now.

692
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,575
Too fast, I can't catch up.

693
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:29,225
I'm back!

694
00:59:29,225 --> 00:59:31,475
I am a demon now, Xiao-Bai.

695
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,575
Haven't you been taken away the essence?

696
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:35,950
Run so fast...

697
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:52,075
Xiao-Bai, Xiao-Bai!

698
00:59:52,225 --> 00:59:54,075
Where are you, Xiao-Bai?

699
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,325
Xiao-Bai!

700
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,575
Xuan, Xuan

701
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:14,825
Don't drain me.

702
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,575
I beg you, I beg you

703
01:00:18,875 --> 01:00:20,400
Xuan, look.

704
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,075
Demon is coming, run!

705
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:56,075
Xiao-Bai! Xiao-Bai!

706
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,400
Xiao-Bai?

707
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:08,325
Hurry up!

708
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:46,100
Xiao-Bai, Xiao-Bai!

709
01:02:49,850 --> 01:02:50,850
It's so big!

710
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,325
Is that Xiao-Bai?

711
01:02:52,325 --> 01:02:52,350
Xuan, I figure we'd better to change back.

712
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,650
Xuan, I figure we'd better to change back.

713
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,400
You really come back.

714
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:02,400
But Sis now is a gaint serpent.

715
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,825
The Taoist grabbed Sis's hairpin,

716
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:10,325
And sis somehow drained his power.

717
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,975
How could this happen?

718
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:17,150
Really? You turned youself into a demon?

719
01:03:18,725 --> 01:03:21,575
Boy, how long did you know her?

720
01:03:21,875 --> 01:03:24,200
How deep could you fall for her?

721
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,775
You was just infatuated with sis's beauty.

722
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,850
Now, my sis turns into this scary look.

723
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,550
Do you still like her?

724
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,200
Where is she going now?

725
01:03:37,675 --> 01:03:39,400
Your snakecatcher Village.

726
01:03:39,925 --> 01:03:42,550
Boy, don't you know?

727
01:03:42,725 --> 01:03:44,825
Supreme Taoist is ahead to your snake catcher village,

728
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:47,075
and sis is going to deal with him.

729
01:03:47,175 --> 01:03:47,950
Supreme Taoist

730
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:52,325
That village will soon be doomed.

731
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,225
Our village?

732
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,075
Love?

733
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,525
Xuan, What should we do now?

734
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:05,825
Back to village

735
01:04:20,225 --> 01:04:22,825
The fleet of Supreme Taoist arrived at snake catcher village?

736
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:25,025
I saw with my own eyes, there are lots of boats.

737
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:28,775
Is it possible he knows where we are hiding,

738
01:04:28,775 --> 01:04:30,075
wants to pick a fight?

739
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,200
How did he know where we were?

740
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:32,900
Is there someone....

741
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,825
Chang-pan is quite loyal.

742
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:36,450
Green snake is cursed with the Death Scales.

743
01:04:36,675 --> 01:04:38,325
They can't betray us.

744
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:40,075
Is White Snake the one who betrayed us?

745
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:42,075
She surrendered to the Supreme Taoist.

746
01:04:46,475 --> 01:04:48,450
There is a traitor in our clan.

747
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:51,325
If we are waiting for the enemy to come to our door, we are waiting for death.

748
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:54,900
But if we fight for our lives, we might survive this.

749
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:58,325
All members of our clan attack the snake catcher village!

750
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:02,613
Slay the traitor! Kill Taoists! Destroy the snake-catcher village!

751
01:05:02,913 --> 01:05:06,000
Slay the traitor! Kill Taoists! Destroy the snake-catcher village!

752
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,550
Slay the traitor! Kill Taoists! Destroy the snake-catcher village!

753
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:15,225
Everyone! Run for your life, our village is in danger.

754
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,350
A gaint serpent,

755
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,425
it's coming.

756
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,900
Run for your life, leave the village!

757
01:05:19,525 --> 01:05:20,375
What nonsense are you talking?

758
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,575
The walls of our village are high enough, why should I fear?

759
01:05:22,575 --> 01:05:24,450
Yongzhou City, it was already ruined by the gaint serpent.

760
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,325
Everyone, run for your life. Leave! now!

761
01:05:26,325 --> 01:05:27,425
The walls of Yongzhou is built by stones.

762
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:28,825
Ruined by a gaint serpent? Nonsence.

763
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:29,725
Xuan

764
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,750
You're finally home.

765
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,575
Auntie, leave here, hurry up.

766
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,825
Ok, I'll go home and pack things up.

767
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:36,100
Don't bother pack up, leave...

768
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,675
The Lord of Greater Yin, the One who See through the Unreal and Divine the Truth.

769
01:06:07,850 --> 01:06:10,075
A gaint serpent?

770
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:22,350
But you're a demon.

771
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:25,950
How could we know you're not lying?

772
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:28,750
As a Supreme Taoist, don't protect the people,

773
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,025
you are doing nothing but wicked.

774
01:06:33,475 --> 01:06:34,450
He's really a demon.

775
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:36,075
Yes, I am a demon.

776
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:37,575
But I'm still Xuan!

777
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:39,975
I came back to warn you run away.

778
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,150
Yongzhou City was destroyed

779
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:42,825
Here will soon be destroyed, too.

780
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,875
Listen to me, get out of here...

781
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,075
You...

782
01:06:46,075 --> 01:06:47,375
You are demon!

783
01:06:49,875 --> 01:06:51,325
A powerless little demon.

784
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:53,700
Catching snakes, Catching snakes,

785
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,950
To enhance your power, you forced us to risk our lives to catch snakes,

786
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,525
drove Xiao-Bai to turn herself into a gaint serpent!

787
01:07:05,675 --> 01:07:06,750
She is comeing.

788
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:08,200
Release me. I can stop her.

789
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,850
Never mind, I let you go.

790
01:07:31,475 --> 01:07:32,075
Xiao-Bai!

791
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:38,550
Xiao-Bai

792
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:39,810
Those people in Yongzhou City

793
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:41,150
You were not intentional to harm them,

794
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,350
you were defending soldiers of Supreme Taoist

795
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,200
But those people lived in the village, even though they caught snakes,

796
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,900
they are innocent.

797
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:50,075
You can't turn snake catcher Village into another Yongzhou City!

798
01:08:43,425 --> 01:08:45,225
Xiao-Bai!

799
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,450
Xiao-Bai, listen to me

800
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,700
I have turned myself into a demon

801
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,825
We're both demons, now.

802
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:12,150
I know you are a gaint serpent now, so what?

803
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:16,575
This world is so vast that it has place for countless mountains and lakes.

804
01:09:16,575 --> 01:09:18,350
Comparing to it, your gaint body means nothing.

805
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:22,575
Xiao-Bai, even I am the weakest demon,

806
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,075
I will risk everything to protect you.

807
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,700
If this world don't allow us to be together.

808
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,900
We will travel to the end of this world,

809
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:33,450
In this vast universe, there will be a place for us.

810
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:36,075
We shall stay together day and night

811
01:09:36,075 --> 01:09:38,200
be a pair of carefree demons.

812
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:43,200
Xiao-Bai...

813
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,325
Xiao-Bai!

814
01:09:59,375 --> 01:10:00,150
Sis!

815
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,900
sister

816
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,900
What a gaint serpent!

817
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,450
Thanks to you, little demon,

818
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,725
I had time to set up this Demon Trap.

819
01:10:38,875 --> 01:10:43,050
Soon, your bodies and souls will be disintegrated.

820
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:57,950
What is it?

821
01:10:58,950 --> 01:11:01,450
This is your soul.

822
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,725
Snake catcher, litte demon,

823
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,225
Disintegrating your soul, do you understand?

824
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,825
Once your vitality is consumed,

825
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,150
your soul will be disintegrated.

826
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,575
And you will vanish forever, no more reincarnation.

827
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,050
No more reincarnation?

828
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:19,825
What a pity!

829
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:22,325
It's a waste to disintegrate you like this,

830
01:11:22,475 --> 01:11:24,825
It's better to let me make use of you.

831
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,825
Once I finish the art of Greater Yin,

832
01:11:31,825 --> 01:11:33,775
I will transend mortality,

833
01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:36,825
The Emperor will realize

834
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:39,900
that I know how to live forever.

835
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,825
Live forever?

836
01:11:45,925 --> 01:11:47,825
Although you talked about Taoism and immortality,

837
01:11:47,825 --> 01:11:49,900
you just covet our power.

838
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:51,325
Come on, drain my power!

839
01:12:02,725 --> 01:12:03,600
What is this?

840
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:07,700
Bastard Taoist

841
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,575
You have drained the curse of Scorching Scales from me,

842
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,150
The time has come, you will suffer the curse soon.

843
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,325
Trivial trick.

844
01:12:37,525 --> 01:12:39,475
It's you! Hussy bitch!

845
01:12:40,675 --> 01:12:42,575
You have hunted so long,

846
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:45,825
today I shall fight you until death.

847
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:47,525
Master!

848
01:13:39,975 --> 01:13:41,200
Xiao-Bai!

849
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:48,725
The Bright Fire!

850
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,825
The Static Earth!

851
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,475
Be careful!

852
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:59,099
Look out

853
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:37,275
Master! Sis!

854
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,775
Catch!

855
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,825
Xiao-Bai!

856
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:36,200
Go!

857
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,850
Kill them all!

858
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,975
Close the door, quick. Hold on!

859
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:48,650
Master,

860
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:50,975
Today we have finally killed our greatest enemy.

861
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,650
Now, I return the hairpin to you now.

862
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,700
I let your sister take this hairpin to assassinate that Taoist,

863
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:04,150
never thought she would use it to steal power for herself,

864
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,825
turned herself into such a gaint serpent.

865
01:17:05,825 --> 01:17:06,325
Master,

866
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:07,575
You wronged my sister.

867
01:17:07,575 --> 01:17:08,825
She did this for...

868
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,075
The Taoist is died.

869
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,275
What do I need this hiarpin for?

870
01:17:16,225 --> 01:17:17,950
Master...

871
01:17:17,950 --> 01:17:21,975
That Taoist made me so miserable.

872
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,825
One day I suddenly realized

873
01:17:25,225 --> 01:17:26,625
if Taoist can do this,

874
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:28,800
Sis...　　　　　　　　　why can' I?　　　　　　　　

875
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:29,125
run...　　　 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　

876
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:29,325
run...　　　　　　if Taoist can drain your power,　　　　　　　　

877
01:17:29,325 --> 01:17:30,725
run...　　　　　　if Taoist can drain your power,　　　　　　　　

878
01:17:30,725 --> 01:17:33,575
SO CAN I!

879
01:17:33,575 --> 01:17:34,825
Sis...

880
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,725
Xiao-Bai!

881
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,400
These little demons with limited powers

882
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,600
shall be the best tonics for my power!

883
01:18:11,875 --> 01:18:15,325
Remember the mystic art I taught you little demons?

884
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:19,200
Share your power, merge them into the source.

885
01:18:20,975 --> 01:18:24,075
Merge them into me!

886
01:19:58,575 --> 01:20:00,050
Xiao-Bai

887
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:02,025
Xuan

888
01:20:02,725 --> 01:20:05,450
I have lost all my power.

889
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,150
Then, you can't push me away anymore.

890
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,200
Xiao-Bai

891
01:20:50,875 --> 01:20:51,775
Look out!

892
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:02,325
Xiao-Bai

893
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,800
The Constellation of Girl

894
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,600
The Constellation of Net

895
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:10,450
It imitated the twenty-eight constellations.

896
01:21:12,975 --> 01:21:15,075
The Constellation of Heart, The Constellation of Ghost.

897
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:17,145
Neck, Horn, Chariot, and Wings, the four constellations on the south-east

898
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,325
Gate of Life, Gate of Life

899
01:21:26,075 --> 01:21:27,150
It's right over there.

900
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:54,899
What are we waiting for?

901
01:21:54,899 --> 01:21:57,150
Hurry, let's rescue Xuan out of there.

902
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,575
No, we can't. They're demons.

903
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:01,175
Yes, and the girl in white,

904
01:22:01,175 --> 01:22:02,575
she is also a demon.

905
01:22:03,725 --> 01:22:05,525
That is Xuan.

906
01:22:05,525 --> 01:22:06,975
He was Xuan,

907
01:22:06,975 --> 01:22:07,825
Now it's a demon.

908
01:22:07,825 --> 01:22:10,075
Yes, we nearly lost our lives just now.

909
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,150
I told you if we let them out,

910
01:22:12,375 --> 01:22:13,900
we will all die.

911
01:22:14,425 --> 01:22:15,950
If Xuan didn't save you,

912
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:16,825
You all already died.

913
01:22:16,825 --> 01:22:18,325
Dudou is also a demon now.

914
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:19,575
Dog, dog demon.

915
01:22:19,575 --> 01:22:20,325
What's wrong about a dog demon?

916
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,075
Xuan and I are both demons.

917
01:22:22,075 --> 01:22:24,200
We still risk our lives to save you!

918
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:40,450
Xuan

919
01:22:53,350 --> 01:22:57,500
Their souls were blew away.

920
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:00,575
If we stay here,

921
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:04,850
our souls will also be all be disintegrated.

922
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:17,825
Don't worry

923
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,325
Villagers

924
01:23:19,475 --> 01:23:21,225
shall come and save us.

925
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:26,150
Xuan

926
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,775
I remembered you said

927
01:23:29,725 --> 01:23:34,825
life is fleeting, filled with odreals and seldom happiness.

928
01:23:34,975 --> 01:23:38,825
If we can remember those happiness, that is enough.

929
01:23:38,825 --> 01:23:40,350
Right.

930
01:23:41,275 --> 01:23:42,900
Do you remember...

931
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,575
those dandelions,

932
01:23:45,575 --> 01:23:47,525
that boat,

933
01:23:48,050 --> 01:23:50,575
and the tower.

934
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,825
I remember.

935
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,800
If you remember them,

936
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:03,700
that's enough.

937
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:39,825
Xuan

938
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,450
Listen

939
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,325
Someone outside is dismantling the trap.

940
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:45,575
Xuan

941
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,775
Xuan

942
01:24:55,975 --> 01:24:57,375
Xuan

943
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:02,075
Xuan

944
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,075
Xuan

945
01:25:05,575 --> 01:25:09,950
You promised me, we will get out there together.

946
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,825
We have lots lots of place to visit.

947
01:25:23,275 --> 01:25:24,125
Don't leave.

948
01:25:24,525 --> 01:25:25,825
Xuan

949
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,875
Xuan

950
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,550
Don't leave me

951
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:48,075
{\a1}<i>Can't you see</i>

952
01:25:48,075 --> 01:25:51,950
{\a1}<i>which flows to the east?</i>

953
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:59,075
{\a1}<i>No one knows where it comes from,</i>

954
01:25:59,075 --> 01:26:02,325
{\a1}<i>no one knows where it goes to.</i>

955
01:26:00,225 --> 01:26:01,425
Xuan

956
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:02,300

957
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:02,325
Xiao-Bai

958
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:03,925
Xiao-Bai

959
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:05,825
no matter what happens,

960
01:26:05,925 --> 01:26:07,200
I will be with you.

961
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,450
There are plenty of wicked people with two legs in this world,

962
01:26:11,725 --> 01:26:13,450
you just have a tail, so what?

963
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:16,325
I'll come back,

964
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,075
Wait for me.

965
01:26:21,225 --> 01:26:22,025
Have you learned it?

966
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:23,575
Let's sing together.

967
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,325
Don't worry, don't worry, we have plenty time to try.

968
01:26:30,325 --> 01:26:32,300
<i>Why bother yourself　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

969
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:35,350
<i>with those earthly affairs?　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

970
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,575
<i>I just realize this floating life　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

971
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:42,900
<i>is a dream.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

972
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:46,950
<i>Why bother yourself　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

973
01:26:47,975 --> 01:26:50,725
<i>with those earthly affairs?　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

974
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:56,725
<i>This floating life is but a dream. 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　</i>

975
01:26:56,725 --> 01:26:57,950
Xuan

976
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:42,775
XUAN!

977
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,025
Where is Xuan?

978
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,475
Xuan

979
01:28:01,825 --> 01:28:07,325
Xuan, Xuan!

980
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,350
The last moment

981
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:20,200
I saved his soul.

982
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:22,325
But the hairpin was actived,

983
01:28:22,325 --> 01:28:25,400
You consumed all your power, and was turned into the white snake

984
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:30,075
I exhausted my last breath of strength.

985
01:28:30,075 --> 01:28:32,825
sealed my memories in the hairpin.

986
01:28:35,375 --> 01:28:39,325
Today you finally opened the seal.

987
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,825
Memories can be restored,

988
01:28:46,825 --> 01:28:50,650
But, the immorality, I can't achieve.

989
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,200
You still can't free yourself?

990
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:57,200
This moment of joy,

991
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,200
I kept in mind for five hundred years.

992
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:00,950
Was it worth for?

993
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,450
Even if I have to give up what I gained last one thousand years,

994
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,075
it worths.

995
01:29:17,675 --> 01:29:19,775
I'll always be your side.

996
01:29:26,175 --> 01:29:27,575
What about him?

997
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:28,650
Where is he?

998
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:30,700
His soul was saved.

999
01:29:30,850 --> 01:29:32,200
He must be reborn

1000
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,400
in somewhere in this world.

1001
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,275
I need to find him.

1002
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,400
No matter where was he reborn in this life,

1003
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,825
He drank the water of Lethe too many times.

1004
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:47,900
Even if you can find him,

1005
01:29:48,325 --> 01:29:50,825
I'm afraid he won't be the person you remembered.

1006
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,275
No matter where he is in this world,

1007
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,850
no matter how he looks like now,

1008
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,825
no matter whether he remembers me or not,

1009
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:09,450
I need to find him.

1010
01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:13,325
Because

1011
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:16,575
I can remember.

1012
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,700
Wait, wait

1013
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:43,150
Wait for a moment. Wait for a moment.

1014
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:48,325
You always forget something.

1015
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:50,475
Thank you, brother-in-law.

1016
01:30:50,725 --> 01:30:52,575
Well, I will leave you alone.

1017
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:13,650
Miss?

1018
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,025
Miss!

1019
01:31:18,675 --> 01:31:19,575
Miss,

1020
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,575
You lost your hair pin.

1021
01:31:32,925 --> 01:31:34,625
Thank you. Sir.

1022
01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:40,775
This hairpin looks ancient,

1023
01:31:41,075 --> 01:31:42,325
it must be a precious thing.

1024
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:43,350
Right.

1025
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,150
We have to thank you to return it, young Sir.

1026
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:47,225
It's a thing must not be lost.

1027
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,900
You looks very familiar, young Miss.

1028
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,825
Where are you from?

1029
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,575
It's a long story.

1030
01:31:55,475 --> 01:32:10,475
There is a mid-credits scene, around 1:35:00; the credit itself is a easter egg too, Have fun.

1031
01:35:11,625 --> 01:35:22,450
<i>I ask the Goddess of Spring, why are you so hurry?</i>

1032
01:35:23,225 --> 01:35:32,975
<i>With the wind and rain, you are leaving like a flying veery.</i>

1033
01:35:34,025 --> 01:35:43,725
<i>Though Spring Goddess won't age,</i>

1034
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:52,675
<i>We are afraid she will age,</i>

1035
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:19,525
<i>This fussy sentiment，only belongs to human.</i>

1036
01:36:26,125 --> 01:36:30,825
Have you brought what I want?
