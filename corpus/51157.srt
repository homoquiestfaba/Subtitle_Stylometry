1
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:20,821
"Mr. Speaker,
will the 30s go down as the decade...

2
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,890
"which witnessed the destruction...

3
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:26,191
"and downfall of the British empire?"

4
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:31,200
"That witnessed
the wanton self-destruction...

5
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:34,869
"of the British empire?"

6
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,838
"lf lndia were granted...

7
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,775
"self-government...

8
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,674
"it would mark the downfall

"lt would mark and consummate...

10
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:55,219
"the downfall of the British empire."

11
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,475
Mr. Inches, you're wanted!

12
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:15,842
On my way.

13
00:05:35,032 --> 00:05:36,897
-Good morning.
-Good morning, madam.

14
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,697
Have to do something
about Miss Sarah's gramophone.

15
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,603
I don't want to start the day
with a family altercation.

16
00:05:42,673 --> 00:05:44,106
-No, madam.
-Hello, Mommy.

17
00:05:44,174 --> 00:05:45,573
Good morning, darling.

18
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,408
Inches, kindly tell my daughter
to turn off that bloody gramophone.

19
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:53,313
Trashy music all over the house.

20
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,510
There you go, sir.

21
00:05:55,085 --> 00:05:57,451
She knows I can't stand it.
Why does she do it?

22
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,455
Leave it to me, sir, will you?

23
00:06:01,392 --> 00:06:02,825
Have you been drinking?

24
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:04,986
This time of the morning, sir? Certainly not.

25
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:07,895
If you have,
I hope it's your damn whiskey and not mine.

26
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,029
What time is Mrs. P coming?

27
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:14,400
Early afternoon, sir.

28
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:18,567
-Early afternoon? Why not this morning?
-Because you told her to come after lunch.

29
00:06:18,642 --> 00:06:20,906
Pure invention, I did nothing of the sort.

30
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:22,843
You said you're going
to town this morning...

31
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:25,245
so she would not be required
until after lunch.

32
00:06:25,282 --> 00:06:27,546
I've changed my mind,
I need to redraft the speech.

33
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:29,210
-Get her here now!
-Yes, sir.

34
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:33,985
-Thank you.
-Mrs. Churchill?

35
00:06:34,491 --> 00:06:36,459
-Mrs. Landing.
-Good morning, madam.

36
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,518
Is something the matter? What's wrong?

37
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,153
It's Mr. Monks, madam.

38
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,289
-Butcher?
-Yes, madam.

39
00:06:42,566 --> 00:06:45,160
It seems we haven't paid
his bill for several weeks.

40
00:06:45,235 --> 00:06:50,332
And he says he'd rather not provide us with
any more meat until the account's settled.

41
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:54,067
Inches!

42
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:57,438
I'll write a check and you send
one of the girls to deliver it.

43
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:58,708
Thank you.

44
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,511
Inches, liver salts.

45
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,313
Good morning, sir.

46
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,020
-Good morning.
-Morning.

47
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:17,190
-Randolph, you look dreadful.
-Thank you, Mama.

48
00:07:17,267 --> 00:07:19,462
All those double brandies late last night.

49
00:07:19,536 --> 00:07:22,972
I'm not in the same league
as my beloved papa.

50
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,736
It's very bad of a young man
to drink so much--

51
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:28,642
Don't start nagging
at this time of the morning, please?

52
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:30,211
Let me wake up first.

53
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:34,840
Who is it?

54
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:37,409
Winston, have you paid Mr. Monks?

55
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:40,221
The butcher from Westerham,
have you paid his bills?

56
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,157
My dear Clemmie,
I'm trying to save lndia from Mr. Gandhi...

57
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:47,061
and his gang of subversive Hindus,
to save British imperial power...

58
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:49,793
from a disastrous eclipse,
and save the Tory Party...

59
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,267
from an act of shame and dishonor.

60
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,566
In other words, you haven't paid the bill.

61
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:57,436
For God's sake, woman,
I can't do everything!

62
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,817
Good morning, Mrs. P!

63
00:08:14,892 --> 00:08:17,224
Good morning, Mary! How's she going?

64
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:18,352
Fine, thank you.

65
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:20,020
You look lovely!

66
00:08:20,998 --> 00:08:22,829
I thought he said after lunch.

67
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,765
He did. He's changed his mind.

68
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:28,601
I wish he didn't do that. I have to take
the girls to Westerham to buy shoes.

69
00:08:28,672 --> 00:08:31,163
Heaven knows when
I'll get another opportunity.

70
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,935
-Mr. Churchill?
-Mrs. P, at last!

71
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,001
Good morning.

72
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,014
We have much to do
and very little time in which to do it.

73
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:43,379
Inches, please tell Mr. Churchill
I've decided to go to town with him.

74
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:46,354
-What time will he be leaving?
-11:30, madam. On the dot.

75
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,490
We'll revise this speech...

76
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:53,721
and go on to the second chapter...

77
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,454
on the way up to London.

78
00:08:55,866 --> 00:08:58,266
-Today?
-Anything wrong with that?

79
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:01,270
No, of course not, Mr. Churchill.

80
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:04,430
And bring my notes
for the Battle of Blenheim.

81
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:13,342
-Clemmie, did I keep you waiting?
-Not more than usual.

82
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,908
-Good morning, Mrs. Churchill.
-How are you, Mrs. P?

83
00:09:15,986 --> 00:09:18,819
-I think I'm fine--
-As happy as a clam, aren't you?

84
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,517
Don't let him boss you about,
he's a dreadful bully.

85
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:23,856
Nonsense, Mrs. P adores me.

86
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:38,172
-How are you getting on with your book?
-Very well.

87
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:40,802
Volume 2, Chapter 20,
the Battle of Blenheim.

88
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:42,970
We're already on page 800 and something.

89
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:46,311
I think the publishers
hoped for something a little shorter.

90
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:48,943
Bugger the publishers,
this is more than a biography.

91
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,384
It's a panegyric...

92
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:53,514
a tribute to my great
and illustrious ancestor.

93
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:57,185
Get a move on, Jenner, overtake!

94
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:05,327
Remember when Randolph and I went off...

95
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:07,131
to see the battlefield?

96
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:09,029
Of course.

97
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,633
I dreamt about it last night.

98
00:10:12,342 --> 00:10:13,900
I could see everything.

99
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:16,877
The enemy being routed...

100
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:20,405
Europe saved from those ravaging hordes...

101
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:23,648
and there was Marlborough...

102
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:25,948
riding into history.

103
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,155
Our eyes met.

104
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:33,089
I think he smiled at me.

105
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:35,933
You shouldn't have had so much cheese.

106
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:36,331
You shouldn't have had so much cheese.

107
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,593
Stilton always gives you nightmares.

108
00:10:48,412 --> 00:10:51,677
"Mr. Speaker, the loss of India...

109
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:55,750
"would mark and consummate
the downfall of the British empire.

110
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:58,151
"lf we cannot do our duty in lndia...

111
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:01,722
"we shall have shown ourselves unworthy...

112
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,658
"to preserve the vast empire...

113
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:08,489
"which still centers upon this small island.

114
00:11:09,766 --> 00:11:11,256
"It is alarming...

115
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:15,095
"and also nauseating to see Mr. Gandhi...

116
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:17,470
"a seditious Middle Temple lawyer...

117
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:21,837
"now posing as a fakir
of a type well known in the East...

118
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,940
"striding half-naked up the steps
of the Viceregal Palace...

119
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:30,719
"to parley on equal terms...

120
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:34,282
"with the representative
of the King Emperor. "

121
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:40,752
Councils, private members' bills,
second reading.

122
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,267
What a monstrous speech.

123
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:52,666
You're his friend, Bracken.

124
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:56,179
You should tell him to stop making
a fool of himself. It's pathetic.

125
00:11:56,246 --> 00:12:00,148
Britain is losing her grip on its
imperial affairs. He's trying to stop the rot.

126
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,206
Rubbish.

127
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:05,118
Winston's a self-serving opportunist.
That's why nobody trusts him. No loyalty.

128
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:07,452
Does his party count for nothing?

129
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:10,493
Is it disloyal to defend
what one believes in passionately?

130
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,052
He's attacking government policy,
so he's attacking his own party.

131
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:18,534
It's about time he toed the line
and stopped being such a bloody nuisance.

132
00:12:19,336 --> 00:12:21,304
Wrong hat, Tom.

133
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:29,439
Mr. Woods, this is appalling.

134
00:12:30,814 --> 00:12:34,841
You must remember that your husband
lost a very substantial sum...

135
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,011
as a result of the Wall Street crash.

136
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,920
We're bankrupt.

137
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,380
Not exactly.

138
00:12:40,824 --> 00:12:44,487
But I have made it clear to your husband
that economies are necessary.

139
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:45,956
What did he say?

140
00:12:47,397 --> 00:12:51,128
He promised to cut down to three bottles
of champagne in the evening.

141
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:00,308
There was a time...

142
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:04,274
when people used to rush into the chamber
to hear me speak.

143
00:13:06,016 --> 00:13:09,315
"It's Winston," they'd cry.
"Winston's on his feet."

144
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,583
Now they hurry away...

145
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:16,554
as if to avoid an embarrassing accident.

146
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:20,852
I'm finished, Brendan.

147
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,623
Nonsense.

148
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,226
A ghost....

149
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,696
Witnessing my own demise.

150
00:13:51,094 --> 00:13:52,254
Diana.

151
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:53,987
Desmond.

152
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:57,363
-Have you met my husband?
-At the wedding. Good to see you again.

153
00:13:57,434 --> 00:13:59,334
I'm so glad to see you.

154
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:01,764
Hello, Morton, how's the spying game?

155
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:04,602
I'm not a spy, I'm a civil servant.
Where's your father?

156
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:08,303
I'm afraid he's having a black-dog day.
We rely on you to get him out of it.

157
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:11,973
He returned from London in a terrible mood.
He's been like that ever since.

158
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:27,387
Winston!

159
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,003
Come on, Winston, lunch in five minutes.

160
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:37,039
Dogs look up to you.

161
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:39,439
Cats look down on you.

162
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,501
Pigs treat you as equals.

163
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,476
What is it? India?

164
00:14:48,518 --> 00:14:49,712
Partly.

165
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,251
-Partly these.
-What about them?

166
00:14:52,322 --> 00:14:53,550
Full of Herr Hitler.

167
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,246
Made me think.

168
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,623
At 35, I was Home Secretary...

169
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:01,994
37, First Lord of the Admiralty...

170
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:05,501
at 50, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
doing pretty well.

171
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:07,660
-Not bad.
-Now look at me.

172
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:11,564
No power, no prospect of power.

173
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:13,900
Look at Hitler.

174
00:15:14,878 --> 00:15:17,870
From bugger-all to head of state in 10 years.

175
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,746
-Come and have some lunch.
-Not hungry.

176
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,312
-Everyone's waiting.
-Let them wait.

177
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,286
Come and have a drink at least.

178
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:33,329
What have you got there?

179
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:37,593
-I'll show you indoors.
-Will it cheer me up?

180
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:40,434
Not exactly.

181
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,895
You may be right about Germany.

182
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,434
What do you mean?

183
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:51,107
What is all this?

184
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:54,247
It's a report from our air attaché in Berlin.

185
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:58,712
He says the Nazis
have in training over 8,000 pilots.

186
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:00,955
Sounds as if Hitler...

187
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,582
is creating an air force.

188
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:05,525
I would say so.

189
00:16:05,762 --> 00:16:07,821
Yes, but the Prime Minister would not.

190
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:09,531
God help us, Desmond.

191
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,835
England is lost in a pacifist dream.

192
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,900
People prefer that to the nightmare of war.

193
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:21,137
Passchendaele and the Somme
are all too close for comfort.

194
00:16:22,746 --> 00:16:25,180
If people are dreaming,
it means they're asleep.

195
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,244
It's time they bloody woke up.

196
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:41,623
Mr. Baldwin?

197
00:16:42,132 --> 00:16:43,224
Prime Minister.

198
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,289
Herr Brecker.

199
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,529
My government is very displeased
by a number of scurrilous...

200
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:51,096
and totally unfounded attacks
on the Third Reich...

201
00:16:51,174 --> 00:16:54,143
that seem to emanate from
your ambassador's office in Berlin.

202
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,872
-Sir Robert?
-Yes. I'll make the appropriate inquiries.

203
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:59,437
If it's true, we shall take immediate action.

204
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:03,475
I deplore any attempt
to create feelings of doubt and suspicion.

205
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,816
I am anxious to work
closely with Germany...

206
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:07,288
under the new order.

207
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:09,120
Thank you, Mr. Baldwin.

208
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:11,918
Mr. Wigram.

209
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:15,564
Perhaps you will let me know
the results of these inquiries.

210
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,561
Our most recent dispatch
from our ambassador reported...

211
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:21,229
that Nazi policy is intensely anti-Jewish.

212
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:24,171
Is that "scurrilous and totally unfounded"?

213
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:28,509
The Jews have become far too prominent
in many aspects of German life.

214
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:31,576
Their influence is disproportionate.

215
00:17:31,715 --> 00:17:34,115
Our policies are merely
adjusting the balance.

216
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:37,219
Is that why you built a concentration camp
outside Munich?

217
00:17:37,387 --> 00:17:40,322
It is a place of protective custody,
Mr. Wigram.

218
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:44,356
Remember, it was the British
who invented the concentration camp...

219
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:46,793
during the Boer War, I believe.

220
00:17:47,497 --> 00:17:49,761
We are merely following your good example.

221
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:03,476
Jolly good, what you said in there.

222
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,841
Nothing but bully boys, these damn Nazis.

223
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:09,510
-They get away with it, that's the trouble.
-Nobody does anything about it.

224
00:18:09,586 --> 00:18:10,746
That's right.

225
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,515
-Very alarming.
-lt is.

226
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:15,386
-Desmond Morton.
-Ralph Wigram.

227
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,425
Foreign Office, Central Department.

228
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:21,021
Dear. I'm sorry, have we met before?
I'm terrible at faces.

229
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,565
I'm afraid it's my training,
military intelligence.

230
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:28,070
I have a filing cabinet instead of a mind.
I'm going to Charing Cross, can I drop you?

231
00:18:28,138 --> 00:18:29,696
Yes, thank you.

232
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:33,169
Thank you very much.

233
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:02,398
Deuce.

234
00:19:07,444 --> 00:19:09,878
I think she wants to do it professionally.

235
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,906
-Annoying people?
-No, the stage.

236
00:19:14,217 --> 00:19:15,241
Nonsense.

237
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,045
Girls go on the stage
to marry into a good family.

238
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:23,753
Sarah already belongs to a good family.
Ladies do not become chorus girls.

239
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,030
There's no cake.

240
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:33,095
-Pardon, sir?
-You've forgotten the cake.

241
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,037
-There isn't any.
-That's what I'm telling you, silly girl.

242
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,734
We don't have any cake.
That's what she means.

243
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:42,437
Don't have any cake? Of course
we have cake. Dundee cake from Fortnum's.

244
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:44,973
-Thank you, Peggy.
-Yes, ma'am.

245
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:49,880
-What on earth's going on?
-We have to make economies, Winston.

246
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,877
What are you talking about?

247
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,423
I'm worried about money,
I went to see Mr. Woods.

248
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:56,254
Four queens. Why?

249
00:19:56,826 --> 00:19:58,521
He's my accountant as well.

250
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:00,823
You could've told me,
could've gone together.

251
00:20:00,897 --> 00:20:03,161
I wanted to see exactly how bad things are.

252
00:20:04,134 --> 00:20:07,865
-Could be worse, that's the answer.
-We've got the most enormous overdraft.

253
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,598
-We're paying it off.
-No, we're not.

254
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:13,040
For God's sake, Clemmie,
I'm working day and night.

255
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:16,010
All these articles for
The Evening Standard, Marlborough...

256
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,411
not to mention the constituency work.

257
00:20:18,548 --> 00:20:20,607
I know, that's why we have to economize.

258
00:20:21,284 --> 00:20:23,809
Like depriving me of my Dundee cake.

259
00:20:26,556 --> 00:20:28,786
You're paying all of Randolph's debts.

260
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:31,326
Randolph is hopeless with money,
we all know that.

261
00:20:31,394 --> 00:20:32,827
He's irresponsible.

262
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,590
I'll talk to him.

263
00:20:42,772 --> 00:20:44,831
-It's your turn.
-What?

264
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:48,239
-It's not--
-lt is, come along.

265
00:20:49,212 --> 00:20:50,975
You just won the last trick.

266
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,449
Bezique, double bezique.

267
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,484
Score it.

268
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:59,687
Double bezique, 500 points.

269
00:20:59,756 --> 00:21:02,316
-Winston, I know how to score.
-Do it.

270
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,992
It's not just Randolph,
it's this house, it's Chartwell.

271
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,964
That's where all the money goes.

272
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:11,090
All right.

273
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:12,691
We employ 18 people here.

274
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:13,758
Surely not.

275
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:16,305
It's ruinously expensive.
We shouldn't have bought it.

276
00:21:16,373 --> 00:21:17,397
Don't start.

277
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:19,305
-You went behind my back.
-I did not.

278
00:21:19,376 --> 00:21:22,243
You knew I didn't like it
and you deliberately deceived me.

279
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:25,543
-That's not true.
-I never saw such an ugly house.

280
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,120
You may find the house ugly, I do not.

281
00:21:34,224 --> 00:21:36,055
Anyway, that's beside the point.

282
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:41,964
-Come with me.
-What for?

283
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:43,590
I want to show you something.

284
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,964
-Don't change the subject.
-I'm not.

285
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,064
Come with me, please.

286
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,649
That's why I bought it.

287
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:06,044
Not because the house is beautiful,
but because of that.

288
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:08,984
What you can see from the house.

289
00:22:09,292 --> 00:22:10,281
England.

290
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:13,623
Look at it, Clemmie.

291
00:22:14,864 --> 00:22:16,388
Nowhere in the world...

292
00:22:16,466 --> 00:22:19,435
could you find a landscape
more ravishing than that.

293
00:22:21,004 --> 00:22:22,596
And it's ours...

294
00:22:23,773 --> 00:22:27,402
to look at and to cherish
for the rest of our lives.

295
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:31,906
I would die for it, Clemmie.

296
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,149
Winston.

297
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,266
Ralph!

298
00:22:57,707 --> 00:22:59,766
Some rather unwelcome news, I'm afraid.

299
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:03,677
The Cabinet has decided
to sell aircraft engines to the Germans.

300
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:04,907
I don't believe it.

301
00:23:04,981 --> 00:23:07,950
To be precise,
118 Rolls Royce PV-12 Merlins.

302
00:23:08,017 --> 00:23:09,006
God almighty.

303
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:11,645
Designed for civilian use, I am told...

304
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,087
but we know
they can be used for fighter planes.

305
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:15,454
This is total madness.

306
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:18,961
"Trade should have no boundaries,"
says the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

307
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:22,725
"lf we don't sell, somebody else will."
I suppose there's some logic in that.

308
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,630
What are we doing here, Van?

309
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:27,795
We make recommendations,
write briefing notes, nobody listens.

310
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:29,839
Nobody in Downing Street gives a damn.

311
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:32,136
They're not very interested...

312
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:35,411
in uncomfortable things like political reality.

313
00:23:53,663 --> 00:23:55,893
Surely the Germans aren't allowed to rearm.

314
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:57,933
Try telling that to Mr. Hitler.

315
00:23:58,001 --> 00:24:00,060
Why doesn't the government do something?

316
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:03,105
They don't want to provoke another war.
Who does?

317
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:06,233
-And they feel guilty.
-About what?

318
00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:09,073
The Treaty of Versailles,
it was far too punitive.

319
00:24:09,145 --> 00:24:11,409
It robbed the Germans of their self-esteem.

320
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:14,917
-He's tired. I'm getting him ready for bed.
-Thank you, Ethel.

321
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,346
Shall we go up?

322
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,686
Mr. Baldwin believes a strong Germany...

323
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:23,350
will keep Russia in its place.

324
00:24:23,426 --> 00:24:26,987
The government regards the Communists
as a greater threat than the Nazis.

325
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:29,156
-And are they?
-I think not.

326
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:32,360
Nazism is more than just
a political movement.

327
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:33,929
It's a cult...

328
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:36,933
a religion based on the idea of racial purity.

329
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:40,336
Mankind, the Nazis believe,
is divided between...

330
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,469
the man-gods and the subhumans...

331
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,645
aliens who will be used
as beasts of burden...

332
00:24:45,715 --> 00:24:47,205
or merely disposed of.

333
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,679
Those with pure Aryan blood
are the man-gods.

334
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,786
The beasts are the Jews.

335
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:56,658
You ready for bed?

336
00:24:58,428 --> 00:24:59,861
Charlie.

337
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:01,688
Daddy.

338
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:07,794
Charlie, my boy.

339
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:09,268
Hello, beautiful boy.

340
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,567
You ready for bed?

341
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:12,641
Yes, you ready for bed?

342
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:19,980
Sweet dreams, big man.

343
00:25:23,152 --> 00:25:24,483
Good night, sweetheart.

344
00:25:25,054 --> 00:25:26,419
Good night.

345
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:39,396
What part of Germany
are you from, Herr Baron?

346
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:42,569
Bavaria, some 10 miles from Munich.

347
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:46,108
-Do you know it?
-I was there last year with my family.

348
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:47,902
On holiday?

349
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:51,469
No, researching for my book
on the Duke of Marlborough.

350
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,574
-Having a look at the battlefields.
-How very exciting.

351
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:57,947
One has to visit the actual places...

352
00:25:58,021 --> 00:26:00,546
tread the terrain, as it were.

353
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:02,250
We nearly had tea with Hitler.

354
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:05,385
-ln Munich?
-At the Ambassador hotel.

355
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:06,621
The Regina hotel.

356
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,491
The Ambassador's in Vienna.

357
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:11,432
Please, don't interrupt me
when I'm trying to interrupt you!

358
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:14,492
Herr Schroder...

359
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,471
have you ever seen Herr Hitler?

360
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,031
-I've met him.
-Really? When was this?

361
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:24,204
Quite recently.
I was having dinner with friends.

362
00:26:24,347 --> 00:26:26,042
Hitler was the principal guest.

363
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:29,285
-What's he like?
-My first impression...

364
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,709
insignificance.

365
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:33,950
Utterly insignificant.

366
00:26:34,023 --> 00:26:36,821
A gray face, slate gray.

367
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:40,596
Melancholy jet-black eyes, like raisins.

368
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:41,062
Melancholy jet-black eyes, like raisins.

369
00:26:42,064 --> 00:26:44,225
A figure out of a ghost story.

370
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:47,834
He talked on and on, endlessly.

371
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,800
"Out of Parsifal," he said...

372
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:53,073
"l shall make a religion."

373
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,872
His oily hair fell
into his face when he ranted.

374
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,474
Then...

375
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,244
quite suddenly, he left.

376
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:06,914
He bowed to me like a waiter...

377
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:09,048
who has just received a fair tip.

378
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,152
When he left...

379
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,263
nobody moved...

380
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:18,188
nobody spoke.

381
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,359
We all sat in silence.

382
00:27:22,838 --> 00:27:23,964
Rather like this.

383
00:27:32,547 --> 00:27:35,038
"After the Great War,
we were told that Germany...

384
00:27:35,117 --> 00:27:37,881
"would be a democracy
with parliamentary institutions.

385
00:27:38,286 --> 00:27:41,050
"All this has been swept away.
What do you have?

386
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:43,887
"Dictatorship, the most grim dictatorship.

387
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,553
"You have the persecution of the Jews.

388
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:48,992
"You have militarism and appeals...

389
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:51,396
"to every form of fighting spirit."

390
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,233
Baldwin won't like that.

391
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,895
He sincerely believes
that Hitler does not want war.

392
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:58,496
-Baldwin.
-Not just Baldwin, many others.

393
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,000
They're wrong.

394
00:28:00,075 --> 00:28:02,839
You think so, I think so,
but don't underestimate them.

395
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,004
They admire Hitler. They won't like it.

396
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,274
They can lump it.

397
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:08,380
Order!

398
00:28:11,186 --> 00:28:14,713
"You have dictatorship,
most grim dictatorship."

399
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,527
Order!

400
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:23,029
"You have the persecution of the Jews.

401
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,991
"You have militarism...

402
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,629
"and appeals to every form
of fighting spirit."

403
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:30,933
Germany wants peace!

404
00:28:31,006 --> 00:28:34,601
"We have steadily marched backward
since the Great War.

405
00:28:36,878 --> 00:28:38,869
"Fears are greater.

406
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:40,939
"Rivalries are sharper.

407
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:44,841
"Military plans are more closely concerted.

408
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,356
"And because of our disarmament,
Britain is weaker."

409
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,623
Order!

410
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:56,725
The right honorable
gentleman must be heard!

411
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:58,265
"The war mentality....

412
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:01,325
"The war mentality is springing up again.

413
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:06,265
"Britain's hour of weakness
is Europe's hour of danger."

414
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,069
Mr. Pettifer.

415
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:14,949
Mr. Speaker, although one is loathe...

416
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:17,849
to criticize anyone
in the evening of his days...

417
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,717
nothing can excuse
the right honorable member for Epping...

418
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:22,848
for having permeated his entire speech...

419
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:25,859
with the atmosphere
that Germany is arming for war.

420
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:30,695
May I remind the right honorable member
that a poll conducted...

421
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,667
by the League of Nations found that
over 90 percent of the British people...

422
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:36,761
favor international disarmament?

423
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:37,827
Hear, hear.

424
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:39,770
And let us not forget...

425
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:43,242
that a child born
on the day the Great War ended...

426
00:29:43,378 --> 00:29:47,371
is now just old enough
to die in the next Great War.

427
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,041
It is our duty, Mr. Speaker...

428
00:29:49,117 --> 00:29:51,449
to ensure that there is no next Great War.

429
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,611
This country wants peace!

430
00:30:03,064 --> 00:30:05,532
People say, "Winston won't mind.

431
00:30:06,334 --> 00:30:08,131
"He's used to being shouted at."

432
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:09,670
They're wrong...

433
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,496
and it hurts deeply.

434
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,801
Especially from your own party.

435
00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:18,209
The Tories don't want to be made to think.

436
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,840
What you're saying is right.
That's what matters.

437
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:23,007
They don't listen, that's what matters.

438
00:30:23,084 --> 00:30:25,678
It's like banging
your head against a brick wall.

439
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:28,747
One can't go on forever.

440
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:31,384
Most men of my age have retired.

441
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,320
They do a bit of gardening,
enjoy a spot of golf...

442
00:30:35,397 --> 00:30:39,128
enjoy a few years of quietude.

443
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,196
And die.

444
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:46,632
All those dreams of standing
shoulder to shoulder...

445
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:49,438
with Marlborough and all the other heroes....

446
00:30:49,511 --> 00:30:51,035
Stupid nonsense!

447
00:30:51,513 --> 00:30:54,914
If you give up now, then you'll never know.

448
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,575
Give up, give up what?

449
00:30:58,153 --> 00:31:02,249
-There's nothing to give up.
-You're depressed, black dog's barking.

450
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:04,622
Perhaps he's barking the truth.

451
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:16,399
Do you remember last year
when lnches fell ill?

452
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:20,265
It wasn't the flu,
it was something more serious.

453
00:31:20,408 --> 00:31:23,741
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Because he told me not to.

454
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:26,405
Doctor said he should
give up work completely...

455
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,005
but he refused.

456
00:31:29,184 --> 00:31:31,744
"Mr. Churchill needs me," he said.

457
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,446
And it's not just lnches,
it's Mrs. P, the staff...

458
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:38,492
your constituency workers, me,
we're all the same.

459
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,723
You have the ability to make people
carry on, no matter what.

460
00:31:41,796 --> 00:31:44,094
You're only trying to cheer me up. Don't.

461
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:46,258
All these years I've put up with...

462
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:50,098
the miseries of political life,
because I believe in you...

463
00:31:50,205 --> 00:31:52,139
and somehow I survived.

464
00:31:52,207 --> 00:31:54,903
But to have you here
all the time in retirement...

465
00:31:54,976 --> 00:31:58,412
bad-tempered, getting in everybody's way.

466
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:02,616
That is something I just could not survive.

467
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,289
You're getting pretty good at this.

468
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,227
Ninety bricks an hour,
isn't that right, Harry?

469
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:18,494
-Nearer to 60, I should say, sir.
-Very well.

470
00:32:18,566 --> 00:32:20,261
Between 60 and 90.

471
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:24,999
I've become a member...

472
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:28,542
of the Amalgamated Union
of Building Workers.

473
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,769
-Fully paid up.
-Very good.

474
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:34,415
This material...

475
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:37,612
you're feeding me
about the German air force...

476
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:40,381
it's too generalized.

477
00:32:40,455 --> 00:32:44,414
-Facts and figures is what I need.
-That stuff doesn't come in my direction.

478
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:47,120
-How do I get hold of it?
-I don't think you can.

479
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:50,062
Top secret, eyes only.
Goes straight to the Foreign Office.

480
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:51,621
See what you can do.

481
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:54,501
I got thrashed again in the House, last week.

482
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:57,094
I need muscle, Desmond.

483
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,770
I need to fight back.

484
00:33:02,844 --> 00:33:04,106
Come in.

485
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:08,138
I thought you left ages ago.

486
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:09,945
I've been reading this.

487
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,214
-Drink?
-Yes.

488
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,346
It's a report from Berlin.

489
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:17,420
Hitler's cabinet has approved a new law.

490
00:33:18,193 --> 00:33:21,356
It means, in effect,
the compulsory sterilization...

491
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:23,989
of all those suffering
from hereditary illnesses...

492
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:28,195
which are deemed, and I quote,
"to affect the health of the nation."

493
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:29,427
Bad.

494
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:31,404
Racial purity, this....

495
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,468
This is just the beginning.

496
00:33:37,312 --> 00:33:39,473
I'll have a word with the Prime Minister.

497
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:42,414
Much good that'll do,
he'll say it's German domestic policy.

498
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,076
It has nothing to do with us.

499
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,243
Which is true.

500
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:50,254
In all honesty,
there's very little I can do, if anything.

501
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:53,226
You, on the other hand,
may think otherwise.

502
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:04,605
Have you brought any of this
to the attention of the government?

503
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,037
I've tried.

504
00:34:06,107 --> 00:34:09,543
I've sent briefing notes to Mr. Baldwin
and all members of the cabinet.

505
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:13,103
-Have you had any reaction?
-Nobody pays any attention.

506
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:16,749
Hitler's war machine is getting
more powerful every day...

507
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,844
and the British public's being
deliberately misinformed.

508
00:34:20,055 --> 00:34:22,224
Or at least deliberately kept in the dark.

509
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:22,918
Or at least deliberately kept in the dark.

510
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:28,052
I've made a summary of the figures
issued by the government...

511
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:30,825
comparing our military strength
with that of Germany.

512
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,166
On the next page are my own figures,
which are much nearer the truth.

513
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:40,574
Germany will soon be strong enough
to wage an aggressive war...

514
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:43,644
which is what I believe they intend to do.

515
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:46,409
Your figures are very precise.

516
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:49,948
Much more so than the information I have.

517
00:34:50,385 --> 00:34:53,411
Presumably, you have access to
other reports, other statistics.

518
00:34:53,488 --> 00:34:55,683
All of it as precise and detailed as this.

519
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:58,624
Far more detailed.
As I say, this is only a summary.

520
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,558
Then I don't see how I can help you.

521
00:35:00,629 --> 00:35:02,221
Your position....

522
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:05,391
I may be called Director
of the lndustrial lntelligence Center...

523
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:06,729
but don't be fooled.

524
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:09,099
I'm no more than a civil servant.

525
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,832
I have no public voice,
which is what you need.

526
00:35:11,906 --> 00:35:13,305
Yes, it is.

527
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,976
In that case,
I think you should talk to Winston.

528
00:35:17,045 --> 00:35:18,808
Winston Churchill?

529
00:35:19,814 --> 00:35:21,076
But surely he's....

530
00:35:21,149 --> 00:35:22,411
Past it?

531
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:23,846
I don't trust him.

532
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:27,080
First, he joins the Tory Party.
Then he switches to the Liberals.

533
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:30,352
Now he's back with the Tories again.
He has no judgment.

534
00:35:30,425 --> 00:35:33,360
Maybe, but he has an extraordinary instinct.

535
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:37,220
He knows when something's important
and should be pursued.

536
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:41,925
He's wrong about lndia, of course.
He's been wrong about a lot of things.

537
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:45,101
But I believe he's right about Germany.

538
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:49,009
I shall be seeing him at the weekend.

539
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:51,739
If you'd like me to take anything
down to Chartwell...

540
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:53,872
I shall be happy to do so.

541
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:56,016
But that would mean....

542
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:02,854
You're suggesting that I remove secret
documents from a government office...

543
00:36:02,924 --> 00:36:06,382
and show them to someone
who has no right to see them.

544
00:36:06,828 --> 00:36:08,625
It's a criminal act.

545
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:11,225
But perhaps a necessary one.

546
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:19,740
-Marjorie?
-Yes, Mr. Wigram?

547
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:23,107
-An envelope, I need a large envelope.
-An envelope?

548
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:26,405
-Yes, do we have any large envelopes?
-How large?

549
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:30,417
Just to take some papers.
Just an ordinary large-size envelope.

550
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:33,943
If you give the papers to me, I'll post them.
What's the address?

551
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:38,049
No, it's nothing to do with work.
Where do we keep the envelopes?

552
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:43,890
Is this big enough for you?

553
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,095
It's fine, perfect.

554
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:49,067
Thank you.

555
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:39,075
They must be back in the office
on Monday morning.

556
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:42,885
-So, I need them back by Sunday evening.
-You have my word.

557
00:37:44,659 --> 00:37:48,095
If it says, "Don't walk on the grass,"
I never do.

558
00:37:49,597 --> 00:37:51,121
Never used to.

559
00:37:53,201 --> 00:37:55,829
-Sunday evening, then.
-Sunday evening.

560
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:04,042
Out. Definitely out.

561
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:08,139
-Can we have some more lemonade?
-No, let's finish the set first.

562
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,986
Where did you get this?

563
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:17,247
A chap in the Foreign Office, Ralph Wigram.
Head of the Central Department.

564
00:38:17,325 --> 00:38:20,419
-Risky business, pinching this.
-Useful?

565
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,294
This'll make the buggers jump.

566
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:33,938
Half-past 11:00. Where the hell is he?
Morton promised.

567
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:37,434
-Perhaps you should telephone.
-Telephone who?

568
00:38:37,512 --> 00:38:40,174
Don't they know how important this is?

569
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,084
Hello?

570
00:38:50,425 --> 00:38:51,949
-Mr. Wigram?
-Yes.

571
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:55,426
Brendan Bracken, just returning that.
Sorry I'm late.

572
00:38:55,497 --> 00:38:58,989
Car broke down, bloody nuisance.
There's a note in there from Winston.

573
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:01,501
He'd love to have you
come down for Sunday lunch.

574
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:03,799
He'll be in touch. Good night.

575
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:05,904
Good night.

576
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,468
Mr. Churchill.

577
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:17,441
Mr. Speaker, before I am derided yet again...

578
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,317
and before any further insults
are hurled at me...

579
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:25,154
in the evening of my days...

580
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:28,091
It's nearly midnight, Winston.

581
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,723
...Iet me give you some facts and figures,
some food for thought.

582
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:34,864
Let me describe to you...

583
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:39,168
the method of aircraft manufacture
in Hitler's Germany.

584
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:42,904
Sit down, Winston, we've heard it all before.

585
00:39:43,611 --> 00:39:47,172
This, you will not have heard,
I can assure you of that.

586
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:53,151
Airplanes destined for the Luftwaffe...

587
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:55,989
are not manufactured in one place.

588
00:39:56,591 --> 00:40:00,083
Throughout Germany,
a large number of firms...

589
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:03,824
are making seemingly innocent
component parts...

590
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:07,634
which are then dispatched
to great, central factories...

591
00:40:07,702 --> 00:40:10,296
where they are assembled very rapidly...

592
00:40:10,371 --> 00:40:13,431
into fighter and bomber aircraft...

593
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:17,742
Iike a jigsaw puzzle or Meccano game.

594
00:40:18,713 --> 00:40:21,416
It's very clever, very effective.

595
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:25,883
And above all, it conceals
the true scale of German rearmament.

596
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:29,181
I am reliably informed...

597
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,720
that the working population of Dessau...

598
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,422
a small town near Leipzig...

599
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,998
increased last year...

600
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,792
by 13,000 people.

601
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:43,630
And why was that?

602
00:40:44,172 --> 00:40:47,266
What is manufactured in Dessau
that requires...

603
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:50,606
such an enormous influx of workers?

604
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:53,912
Lager beer?

605
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:57,616
Lederhosen?

606
00:40:58,586 --> 00:40:59,883
Sausages?

607
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:03,286
Aircraft.

608
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:08,259
That is why I say we must act decisively.

609
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:12,226
And we must act now,
to put our defenses in order.

610
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:16,798
If we do not, history will cast its verdict...

611
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:21,332
with those terrible,
chilling words, "too late."

612
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:23,675
Hear, hear.

613
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:28,243
Mr. Ferguson, the right honorable
gentleman and member for 18 years....

614
00:41:33,721 --> 00:41:35,552
Charlie would so love a dog.

615
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:38,592
-I'm sure we could find you one.
-Off you go.

616
00:41:40,728 --> 00:41:44,994
I'm afraid our garden's too small.
It's the size of a postage stamp.

617
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:47,692
We have an absolute menagerie here.

618
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:52,203
Winston has cats, dogs,
geese, donkeys, wild swans...

619
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,905
pigs, not to mention the children.

620
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:58,776
-I don't know how you manage.
-I've written my own epitaph.

621
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:02,177
"Here lies the woman who was always tired.

622
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,447
"She lived in a world
where too much was required."

623
00:42:07,622 --> 00:42:11,251
-Are landscapes your specialty?
-On the whole, yes.

624
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:14,688
Less troublesome than portraits.

625
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:19,332
A tree can't tell me
that I haven't done it justice.

626
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,664
I don't know how you find time for painting.

627
00:42:21,736 --> 00:42:25,172
I wouldn't do without it.
It keeps me sane. I mean it.

628
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,740
I couldn't exist without paints and brushes.

629
00:42:30,878 --> 00:42:32,937
The black dog will get me.

630
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:35,977
Are you a worrier?

631
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:39,249
Yes, I'm afraid I am.

632
00:42:39,854 --> 00:42:42,823
Then you should definitely take up painting.

633
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:45,992
It's good for the spirit, calms the nerves.

634
00:42:47,862 --> 00:42:49,853
What do you worry about?

635
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:52,022
Almost everything, really.

636
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:56,160
My wife, my son. Are they happy?
Will they be all right?

637
00:42:56,904 --> 00:43:01,000
The state of my finances,
the state of the world, the state of my roof.

638
00:43:01,075 --> 00:43:02,372
-Your what?
-My roof.

639
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:06,209
We have a leaky roof.
Every time it rains, it's a nightmare.

640
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:09,345
But most of all...

641
00:43:10,351 --> 00:43:13,878
I'm worried about these papers,
these documents I'm showing you.

642
00:43:13,955 --> 00:43:16,753
If anyone found out,
I'd be in the most terrible trouble.

643
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:19,292
Nobody will find out, don't worry.

644
00:43:20,461 --> 00:43:22,861
It's all strictly confidential.

645
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,525
-May I call you Ralph, if it's not too sudden?
-Please, do.

646
00:43:26,634 --> 00:43:31,094
The recognizing
and acknowledging of fear...

647
00:43:31,172 --> 00:43:32,969
is a mark of wisdom.

648
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:37,769
For example, I can't stand
too near the edge of a platform...

649
00:43:37,845 --> 00:43:40,780
when an express train is passing through.

650
00:43:41,482 --> 00:43:44,508
Second's action would
end everything forever.

651
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:50,251
My doctor says it's a form of melancholia.
We call it my black dog.

652
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,525
Painting drives it away.

653
00:43:52,593 --> 00:43:55,790
As does bricklaying. I'm building a wall.

654
00:43:56,263 --> 00:43:58,322
It goes well with writing.

655
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:01,701
Two thousand words and 200 bricks a day.

656
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,536
What's the time? I feel peckish.

657
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:09,107
-It's nearly 4:00.
-I knew it, time for tea.

658
00:44:09,176 --> 00:44:11,736
When we have visitors,
we have Dundee cake.

659
00:44:11,812 --> 00:44:15,248
It's a great treat these days.
I'm particularly fond of Dundee cake.

660
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:16,408
Come along!

661
00:44:16,484 --> 00:44:19,078
I'll take these, you bring the easel.

662
00:44:20,354 --> 00:44:23,983
My old man said, follow the van

663
00:44:24,058 --> 00:44:25,855
And don't dilly-dally....

664
00:44:25,926 --> 00:44:29,521
Come on, don't try and fold it up.
It's a bloody nightmare.

665
00:44:29,597 --> 00:44:32,395
And don't dilly-dally on the way

666
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:35,094
I hear you went to Chartwell.

667
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:36,466
Yes.

668
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:39,637
-Did you have fun?
-Yes, we did rather.

669
00:44:40,074 --> 00:44:42,338
I didn't know
you were chummy with Winston.

670
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:44,605
I'm not, not chummy.

671
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,678
-I wonder what he wants you for.
-What do you mean?

672
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:51,684
Winston's so-called friends
are people who are useful to him.

673
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:55,051
The idea of having a friend
because you like someone has no place...

674
00:44:55,122 --> 00:44:56,111
in his world.

675
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:59,123
-You have to be very careful.
-What of?

676
00:45:00,227 --> 00:45:02,388
He demands total loyalty.

677
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:06,131
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me."

678
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:11,365
Do you know what Lloyd George
said of him?

679
00:45:11,439 --> 00:45:14,306
He said he would make a drum
of his own mother's skin...

680
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:16,809
in order to sound his own praises.

681
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:26,481
Walk on.

682
00:45:29,457 --> 00:45:31,391
Who's this article for?

683
00:45:33,227 --> 00:45:34,558
The Daily Mail.

684
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:43,267
Damn good, The Daily Mail.
Big fee, big readership.

685
00:45:43,337 --> 00:45:45,567
What more could a fellow ask?

686
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,574
Walter Guinness telephoned this morning.

687
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:55,405
-How is he?
-He's very well.

688
00:45:55,483 --> 00:45:58,418
-He's asked me to go on a cruise.
-A cruise?

689
00:45:59,754 --> 00:46:01,085
Very nice.

690
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:03,689
It's more of an expedition, really.

691
00:46:05,593 --> 00:46:08,027
Fine, you'll enjoy a little rest.

692
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:16,834
Where's Walter planning to go,
south of France?

693
00:46:17,605 --> 00:46:18,833
Komodo.

694
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:23,073
Komodo, where the hell is that?

695
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,941
Just below the Philippines, near Bali.

696
00:46:28,215 --> 00:46:30,649
That's halfway around the bloody world.

697
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:33,584
What on earth makes him want to go there?

698
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,152
-Something to do with catching dragons.
-Dragons?

699
00:46:37,558 --> 00:46:41,722
They're more lizards, really,
but they're very big. They're for the zoo.

700
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:43,453
Wait a minute.

701
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:46,964
Walter Guinness is seriously suggesting...

702
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:50,765
going halfway around the world
searching for some damn lizard.

703
00:46:50,838 --> 00:46:53,329
-ls that right?
-Yes.

704
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:57,937
-He must be mad. What's the point of it?
-lt would be a great adventure.

705
00:46:58,012 --> 00:47:01,345
-You'd be away weeks, months.
-About four months.

706
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,882
Who else is going on this trip?

707
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:09,581
Evelyn, of course, two of their cousins,
and a man called Terrence Phillip.

708
00:47:09,723 --> 00:47:11,714
-Who's he?
-Art dealer.

709
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:14,761
We met him
at one of Walter's dinner parties.

710
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,164
Clemmie, you have four children...

711
00:47:19,834 --> 00:47:21,802
who require your love and support...

712
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:24,895
not to mention a husband
who has to work 20 hours a day...

713
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,837
to keep this household afloat.

714
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:29,876
And you think it's all right,
do you, to leave us...

715
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:33,402
to go off chasing lizards
with Walter Guinness?

716
00:47:35,916 --> 00:47:37,884
What am I supposed to say to that?

717
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:42,150
Don't you think it just might be construed
as just a little selfish?

718
00:47:44,592 --> 00:47:46,355
Well, don't you?

719
00:47:50,264 --> 00:47:53,961
Do not accuse me of being selfish.
Do not dare!

720
00:47:54,034 --> 00:47:56,867
I spent the last 26 years of my life
trying to please you.

721
00:47:56,937 --> 00:47:59,337
And I've done everything,
and I mean everything!

722
00:47:59,406 --> 00:48:02,000
I put your happiness
before the children's happiness...

723
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:03,668
before my happiness!

724
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:06,212
You are the most self-centered man
I have ever met.

725
00:48:08,716 --> 00:48:09,808
So...

726
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,251
don't accuse me of being selfish.
Don't you dare.

727
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:21,728
Sorry, sir.

728
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:23,325
I thought somebody....

729
00:48:31,637 --> 00:48:34,003
The sprouts misbehaved.

730
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,529
Yes, sir.

731
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:06,169
Mrs. Pussycat, Mr. Pug is very sorry.

732
00:49:08,508 --> 00:49:10,442
Pussycat, do let me in.

733
00:49:12,278 --> 00:49:14,644
Mr. Pug is very lonely out here.

734
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,150
Mrs. Pussycat, please.

735
00:49:52,285 --> 00:49:55,982
-Mommy, open the window.
-What darling?

736
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:58,683
-Open the window!
-I can't hear you.

737
00:49:58,758 --> 00:50:02,194
That's why you need to open the window!
The leather strap, pull up!

738
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:05,162
-lt won't budge, you'll have to shout.
-We are shouting.

739
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:08,826
-Bye, Mommy, find a dragon!
-Pull up on the leather strap!

740
00:50:12,705 --> 00:50:14,172
Goodbye.

741
00:50:14,907 --> 00:50:18,035
-Goodbye, Clemmie.
-Goodbye.

742
00:50:39,232 --> 00:50:43,760
-And how are you this morning, sir?
-All right, I think. Thank you for asking.

743
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:47,067
Missing her, of course,
but that's to be expected.

744
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,108
No point in dwelling on her absence,
we must KBO.

745
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:54,271
Yes, sir, "keep buggering on"
at all times, sir.

746
00:50:57,049 --> 00:51:00,951
KBO, that's the order of the day.

747
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:10,893
"We are entering...

748
00:51:10,997 --> 00:51:13,761
"a period of danger...

749
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:16,534
"and of anxiety."

750
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:19,064
Comma.

751
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:21,434
"Let us stop...

752
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:25,004
"and see exactly...."

753
00:51:25,077 --> 00:51:27,102
No, scrub that.

754
00:51:30,316 --> 00:51:31,544
Bugger.

755
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,915
Thank you, kindly.

756
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:40,551
"We are entering upon a period of danger...

757
00:51:40,626 --> 00:51:42,150
"and of anxiety."

758
00:51:42,428 --> 00:51:44,123
You're repeating yourself.

759
00:51:44,196 --> 00:51:47,131
All right, don't break your heart about it.

760
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:50,960
"And how do we stand...

761
00:51:51,337 --> 00:51:54,829
"in this long period of danger?"

762
00:51:55,942 --> 00:51:57,705
Pause for emphasis.

763
00:51:58,444 --> 00:52:01,436
Look of doom and foreboding.

764
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:04,712
"There is no doubt...

765
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:08,482
"that the Germans
are superior to us in the air...

"at the present time.

"they will possibly be three...

00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:22,761
"or even four times our strength."

770
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,400
Where did he get all that information?

771
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:33,775
He makes it his business
to be well informed.

772
00:52:33,846 --> 00:52:37,441
I don't like it, it could do immense damage
to our trade with Germany...

773
00:52:37,516 --> 00:52:39,484
not to mention the cost of rearmament.

774
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:41,918
Where does he think
the money's coming from?

775
00:52:41,988 --> 00:52:44,513
I want him isolated. Tell the whips.

776
00:52:44,991 --> 00:52:47,789

"To urge preparation of defense...

784
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:11,511

"On the contrary, if war was imminent...

"Your dear letters are
the only bright spot in my life, Clemmie.

862
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:45,222
"I fill my days writing inflammatory articles
about Germany...

863
00:57:45,758 --> 00:57:49,023
"and thus incurring
the wrath of Stanley Baldwin...

864
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,152
"which pleases me no end. "

865
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,860
Evening Standard. Have you seen it?

866
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:56,156
Yes.

867
00:57:56,235 --> 00:57:58,863
You haven't had much luck
as far as Winston is concerned.

868
00:57:58,938 --> 00:58:00,428
He's more voluble than ever.

869
00:58:00,506 --> 00:58:02,872
Germany is his new hobby.
He won't let go of it.

870
00:58:02,942 --> 00:58:04,341
You've got to make him.

871
00:58:04,377 --> 00:58:05,844
-Excuse me, sir. 10:30?
-Yes.

872
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:09,712
I will not allow him to interfere
with government policy...

873
00:58:09,782 --> 00:58:12,512
nor indeed with the smooth running
of the party machine.

874
00:58:12,585 --> 00:58:14,314
I'll do what I can.

875
00:58:14,553 --> 00:58:16,987
Have a word
with someone in his constituency.

876
00:58:17,056 --> 00:58:18,614
Yes, of course.

877
00:58:19,992 --> 00:58:21,857
A word about what exactly?

878
00:58:21,927 --> 00:58:24,725
There must be a large amount
of local party members...

879
00:58:24,797 --> 00:58:28,233
who were dismayed, not to say alarmed,
by his behavior.

880
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:30,661
Encourage them to speak up.

881
00:58:31,203 --> 00:58:34,400
Tell them to make him aware
of their displeasure.

882
00:58:35,141 --> 00:58:37,769
Say he's erratic, totally unreliable.

883
00:58:59,999 --> 00:59:01,728
-Ralph.
-Hello, Van.

884
00:59:02,334 --> 00:59:04,564
-Enjoying it?
-Very much, you?

885
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:06,294
Immensely.

886
00:59:07,206 --> 00:59:10,505
-Winston's been very active recently.
-Active?

887
00:59:10,576 --> 00:59:13,238
Yes, endless speeches,
all those newspaper articles...

888
00:59:13,312 --> 00:59:16,543
Evening Standard, Daily Mail,
everywhere you look.

889
00:59:16,782 --> 00:59:20,149
-Created a lot of anxiety.
-Yes, I'm sure.

890
00:59:20,286 --> 00:59:22,652
-Not surprising, really.
-No.

891
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:26,558
His information is remarkably detailed.

892
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:29,526
I'm starting to wonder where it comes from.

893
00:59:29,729 --> 00:59:32,789
Of course, a lot of it could come
from your department.

894
00:59:32,898 --> 00:59:34,991
Yes, it could, I know.

895
00:59:37,336 --> 00:59:40,430
Winston started to make some real impact.

896
00:59:41,273 --> 00:59:44,037
Slowly but surely, attitudes are changing.

897
00:59:44,577 --> 00:59:48,411
It would be unfortunate
if something were to go wrong.

898
00:59:49,081 --> 00:59:50,241
Wrong?

899
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:52,782
Yes, one has to be very careful.

900
00:59:53,252 --> 00:59:56,244
No unnecessary risks,
if you know what I mean.

901
00:59:57,857 --> 00:59:58,915
Yes.

902
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:01,658
Here we are.

903
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:04,990
Hello. Here you are, my darling.

904
01:00:28,454 --> 01:00:31,821
"We must defend our island
from foreign aggression." Stop.

905
01:00:31,891 --> 01:00:32,880
All clear.

906
01:00:32,958 --> 01:00:36,325
"We should repudiate
all defeatism and passivism." Stop.

907
01:00:36,395 --> 01:00:37,623
Bugger!

908
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:39,594
West room 93.

909
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:42,230
It's for you, sir. Mr. Wigram.

910
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:45,964
"Our country can only be saved
if it is strong."

911
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:48,135
Ralph, how are you?

912
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:49,706
Winston...

913
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:52,509
I can't go on with this.

914
01:00:52,578 --> 01:00:55,809
I'm sure they know something.
We have to stop this now.

915
01:00:56,015 --> 01:00:59,143
Listen, Ralph, just a little longer.

916
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:02,411
Winston, are you sure
we're not making matters worse?

917
01:01:02,488 --> 01:01:04,422
I don't believe we are.

918
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,723
It's so very important,
what you're doing, Ralph.

919
01:01:07,893 --> 01:01:09,724
You mustn't stop now.

920
01:01:10,095 --> 01:01:14,293
Ralph, KBO, remember our motto.
Keep buggering on.

921
01:01:31,851 --> 01:01:34,445
"Life is drab without you, Clemmie.

922
01:01:35,187 --> 01:01:38,350
"If it weren't for Mary,
I'd be utterly miserable. "

923
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:41,755
Now, I just want to show you the scale,
the distance.

924
01:01:41,827 --> 01:01:44,193
There's the South of England,
where we live...

925
01:01:44,263 --> 01:01:48,029
and there is Austria,
where you went last Christmas with Mommy.

926
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,592
-And you remember how far away that was.
-Yes.

927
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:54,332
Now, I'll show you where Mommy is now.

928
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:55,771
Let her go!

929
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:58,275
Miles and miles away.

930
01:01:58,344 --> 01:02:02,212
"Your desert-island picnic
with Mr. Phillip sounds idyllic.

931
01:02:02,281 --> 01:02:04,909
"I wish I could've been there with you.

932
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:08,414
"It is over 1 1 weeks since you left Chartwell.

933
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:12,283
"And I'm counting the seconds
until you return. "

934
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:15,418
...to Komodo, where the dragons are.

935
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:18,327
-lt really is a long way.
-Yeah, it is.

936
01:02:18,397 --> 01:02:19,830
Paragraph.

937
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:24,094
"Diana's gone back to her husband."

938
01:02:24,637 --> 01:02:25,626
Comma.

939
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:29,001
"But I fear the marriage will not last." Stop.

940
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:31,338
Inches, out! I'm in the middle of a letter!

941
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:32,877
-Telephone, sir.
-Out!

942
01:02:32,945 --> 01:02:35,641
-The man says it's important.
-He can call later.

943
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:37,147
-Really important.
-Who is it?

944
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,707
-Major Sankey.
-Who is Major Sankey?

945
01:02:39,785 --> 01:02:42,549
One of your constituency workers.
You should talk to him.

946
01:02:42,621 --> 01:02:44,919
-Now?
-Yes. He's been ringing all morning.

947
01:02:44,990 --> 01:02:48,323
All right. Inches,
you're the most irritating clug on earth!

948
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:52,421
I was in the middle of a letter to my wife,
now I've lost my train of thought.

949
01:02:52,498 --> 01:02:54,693
Idiot! Have you no sensitivity?

950
01:02:54,767 --> 01:02:58,203
There's no need to be insulting, sir.
I was just passing on a message.

951
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,965
Shut up, lnches. How dare you?

952
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:02,837
Tell the girl to put the call through up here.

953
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,468
-She's gone to lunch, sir.
-Then do it yourself.

954
01:03:05,544 --> 01:03:07,739
I'm not acquainted with the mechanism, sir.

955
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:10,281
God almighty. Bloody hell!

956
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:14,251
-You're very rude to me, lnches.
-You're very rude to me, sir.

957
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,811
Yes, but I'm a great man.

958
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:20,617
You're a stupid old bugger.

959
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:25,622
Mr. Churchill's in trouble.

960
01:03:26,966 --> 01:03:28,524
What do you mean?

961
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,263
Mr. Baldwin, or someone higher up,
is trying to get him pushed out.

962
01:03:32,338 --> 01:03:33,270
Of what?

963
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:35,273
The Conservative Party.

964
01:03:35,975 --> 01:03:38,773
Don't be daft,
they wouldn't do a thing like that.

965
01:03:38,844 --> 01:03:42,177
They don't like his speeches on Germany.
They want to shut him up.

966
01:03:42,247 --> 01:03:45,808
Can they do that, Mrs. P? Just kick him out?

967
01:03:46,051 --> 01:03:48,178
They could, I suppose, yes.

968
01:03:50,022 --> 01:03:53,150
Organize a vote of no confidence,
something like that.

969
01:03:53,425 --> 01:03:55,950
-He'd never get over it.
-I know.

970
01:03:56,395 --> 01:03:58,056
I'll tell you this, Mrs. P.

971
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,622
If they do kick him out,
I shall never vote Tory again.

972
01:04:01,867 --> 01:04:04,335
Never! Not even Liberal.

973
01:04:04,403 --> 01:04:07,031
Bastards! How dare they? Buggers!

974
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:10,269
This is absolutely the worst day
of my whole bloody life!

975
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:12,105
I'm surrounded by enemies.

976
01:04:13,112 --> 01:04:16,648
They call me a warmonger
because I speak the blunt truth?

977
01:04:16,648 --> 01:04:16,704
They call me a warmonger
because I speak the blunt truth?

978
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:19,848
Baldwin is behind all this,
Stanley bloody Baldwin!

979
01:04:19,917 --> 01:04:22,442
No better than an epileptic corpse.

980
01:04:25,857 --> 01:04:28,849
"Who is in charge of the clattering train?

981
01:04:28,926 --> 01:04:31,759
"The axles creek and the coupling strain.

982
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:34,263
"The pace is hot, and the points are near.

983
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:37,165
"And sleep has deadened the driver's ear.

984
01:04:37,735 --> 01:04:40,932
"And the signals flash
through the nights in vain.

985
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:42,629
"For Death...

986
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:45,604
"is in charge of the clattering train."

987
01:04:50,615 --> 01:04:53,277
He'll be needing a glass of champagne.

988
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:55,041
Possibly two.

989
01:04:56,621 --> 01:05:00,557
Charlie, Mommy's nearly finished.
Then, I promise, we'll go to the park.

990
01:05:01,459 --> 01:05:03,427
There's someone to see you, ma'am.

991
01:05:03,494 --> 01:05:05,792
-Who?
-Mr. Pettifer.

992
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:07,660
Pettifer, to see me?

993
01:05:08,866 --> 01:05:11,130
We'll go in a minute, darling.

994
01:05:12,837 --> 01:05:14,771
What are you reading, Charlie?

995
01:05:19,544 --> 01:05:21,512
Good afternoon, Mr. Pettifer.

996
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:23,279
Mrs. Wigram.

997
01:05:23,948 --> 01:05:27,315
-I'm afraid my husband's not home.
-lt was you I came to see.

998
01:05:27,919 --> 01:05:29,477
Please, do sit down.

999
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:30,919
Thank you.

1000
01:05:32,423 --> 01:05:36,291
I need your help
in a rather delicate and confidential matter.

1001
01:05:36,994 --> 01:05:40,327
The Prime Minister feels
it would be advantageous...

1002
01:05:40,631 --> 01:05:43,862
if your husband did not see
quite so much of Mr. Churchill.

1003
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:45,094
What do you mean?

1004
01:05:45,169 --> 01:05:48,104
It's perhaps not wise, not good for him.

1005
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:49,696
Not wise for who?

1006
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:51,575
Your husband.

1007
01:05:52,009 --> 01:05:54,534
Then shouldn't you be telling this
to my husband?

1008
01:05:54,612 --> 01:05:57,274
I'm quite sure he takes note of what you say.

1009
01:05:57,381 --> 01:05:59,815
What my husband does is his own business.

1010
01:06:00,051 --> 01:06:01,985
I wouldn't dream of trying to interfere.

1011
01:06:02,053 --> 01:06:03,748
No, of course not.

1012
01:06:03,988 --> 01:06:08,049
But do remember, your husband's the head
of an important part of the Foreign Office.

1013
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:11,857
It's not a good idea
for him to tell Mr. Churchill what's going on.

1014
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:13,021
Why?

1015
01:06:13,464 --> 01:06:15,364
If indeed he has been.

1016
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:18,796
Please, Mrs. Wigram,
don't let's argue about this.

1017
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:22,101
Please, Mr. Pettifer,
don't treat me like a child.

1018
01:06:23,608 --> 01:06:26,577
If your husband persists
in seeing Winston...

1019
01:06:27,178 --> 01:06:31,376
he may find himself being posted
somewhere inconveniently distant...

1020
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:35,116
which would, of course,
be difficult with regard to your son.

1021
01:06:35,186 --> 01:06:37,711
Difficult for him to travel, I mean.

1022
01:06:38,122 --> 01:06:40,522
Difficult also, I should imagine...

1023
01:06:40,591 --> 01:06:44,755
to find the appropriate medical assistance
in certain parts of the world.

1024
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:49,061
I dare say,
it would mean your having to stay here.

1025
01:06:50,067 --> 01:06:52,831
You've made a foolish mistake, Mr. Pettifer.

1026
01:06:53,304 --> 01:06:54,931
A tactical error.

1027
01:06:55,173 --> 01:06:59,041
When a member of the government comes
to my house and threatens me so openly...

1028
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,237
it only shows how important it is...

1029
01:07:01,312 --> 01:07:04,304
that my husband continue his friendship
with Mr. Churchill.

1030
01:07:04,382 --> 01:07:06,475
That is my opinion, anyway.

1031
01:07:10,688 --> 01:07:13,418
Please, give my regards to your husband.

1032
01:07:13,724 --> 01:07:17,023
-Do tell him what I said.
-I think I prefer not to.

1033
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:19,622
Good afternoon, Mrs. Wigram.

1034
01:07:27,171 --> 01:07:30,106
-What do you want, Mr. Churchill?
-I'm looking for a letter.

1035
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:31,573
What letter?

1036
01:07:31,642 --> 01:07:34,770
I thought there might be something
from Clemmie.

1037
01:07:35,413 --> 01:07:36,744
Not today.

1038
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,578
It's not easy to post letters
in that part of the world.

1039
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:49,119
Perhaps tomorrow.

1040
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:59,130
Does the name "Terrence Phillip"
mean anything to you?

1041
01:07:59,203 --> 01:08:02,331
Terrence Phillip? Yes. Art dealer, I think.

1042
01:08:02,573 --> 01:08:04,131
Anything known?

1043
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:06,206
Good-looking?

1044
01:08:06,277 --> 01:08:09,735
Rather dashing, plenty of money.
His father was rich.

1045
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:12,240
-Married?
-No.

1046
01:08:14,085 --> 01:08:17,543
Clemmie seems to be
quite chummy with him.

1047
01:08:17,622 --> 01:08:19,453
She keeps mentioning him.

1048
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:22,117
-He's on the boat with her?
-He is.

1049
01:08:24,595 --> 01:08:27,223
-I'm idiotically jealous.
-Winston.

1050
01:08:27,298 --> 01:08:30,062
-I'm sure she's in love with him.
-Rubbish.

1051
01:08:30,134 --> 01:08:32,534
She writes about him in every letter.

1052
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:35,037
"Terrence and I did this,
Terrence and I did that."

1053
01:08:35,106 --> 01:08:38,234
-They're companions, friends on holiday.
-I know Clemmie.

1054
01:08:38,309 --> 01:08:41,472
I can read between the lines.
I know her thoughts.

1055
01:08:41,812 --> 01:08:45,043
Don't be ridiculous.
She loves you, Winston, very deeply.

1056
01:08:45,116 --> 01:08:47,414
-I'm a rotten husband.
-Nonsense.

1057
01:08:47,485 --> 01:08:51,649
I suppose he's the romantic type.
You know, all that sort of stuff.

1058
01:08:51,856 --> 01:08:53,847
Never got much of that from me.

1059
01:08:53,925 --> 01:08:56,519
It never seemed important,
even when I was young.

1060
01:08:56,594 --> 01:08:59,688
Daisy Fellowes,
she tried to seduce me at the Ritz.

1061
01:09:01,332 --> 01:09:02,594
Wasn't interested.

1062
01:09:02,667 --> 01:09:06,034
Used to think
it was because I smoked too much.

1063
01:09:06,137 --> 01:09:10,437
-Tobacco is bad for love, old age is worse.
-You're talking nonsense, Winston.

1064
01:09:10,508 --> 01:09:14,877
"I've lived too long, I'm in the ruck
I've drunk too deeply of the cup

1065
01:09:14,946 --> 01:09:19,679
"l cannot spend, I cannot fuck
I'm down and out, I'm buggered up"

1066
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,342
Where did you get that from?

1067
01:09:21,419 --> 01:09:25,287
It's a translation from the Russian.
Pushkin, I believe.

1068
01:09:29,026 --> 01:09:31,358
You may laugh, Desmond Morton...

1069
01:09:31,729 --> 01:09:33,890
but I think about it all the time.

1070
01:09:33,965 --> 01:09:35,956
Clemmie and that fellow.

1071
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,558
She'll be home soon, Winston.

1072
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:44,500
Wrap me up in me tarpaulin jacket

1073
01:09:45,576 --> 01:09:49,137
And say a poor trooper lies low

1074
01:09:49,981 --> 01:09:52,541
Get six stalwart lancers

1075
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,274
to carry me

1076
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:58,146
with steps silent, mournful

1077
01:09:58,889 --> 01:10:00,652
and slow

1078
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:06,219
Mr. Churchill!

1079
01:10:09,433 --> 01:10:10,957
Inches, you're drunk.

1080
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:12,662
She's here, sir.

1081
01:10:13,437 --> 01:10:14,529
What?

1082
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:18,175
-Taxi's coming down the drive, sir.
-What are you talking about?

1083
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:19,937
Mrs. Churchill, sir.

1084
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:21,876
-She's here?
-Yes, sir.

1085
01:10:23,047 --> 01:10:24,412
She's here!

1086
01:10:30,121 --> 01:10:31,611
Out of my way!

1087
01:10:38,729 --> 01:10:40,060
Lovely.

1088
01:10:41,699 --> 01:10:43,223
Thanks very much.

1089
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:58,878
Why are you all wet?

1090
01:10:59,316 --> 01:11:02,285
I thought I'd never see you again.

1091
01:11:08,025 --> 01:11:09,390
Here I am.

1092
01:11:17,168 --> 01:11:19,329
Mr. Inches, how are you?

1093
01:11:30,614 --> 01:11:32,411
So, you had a good time?

1094
01:11:32,483 --> 01:11:33,814
Wonderful.

1095
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:38,187
I missed you very much.

1096
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:41,051
I missed you, too.

1097
01:11:43,694 --> 01:11:45,252
I'm not sure...

1098
01:11:46,464 --> 01:11:48,227
that I believe that.

1099
01:12:00,778 --> 01:12:04,043
You seem to have seen
a lot of Mr. Terrence Phillip.

1100
01:12:04,114 --> 01:12:05,172
Yes.

1101
01:12:05,983 --> 01:12:07,473
You like him?

1102
01:12:07,551 --> 01:12:09,075
He was good fun.

1103
01:12:09,487 --> 01:12:10,749
Good fun?

1104
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:13,322
He's very interesting.

1105
01:12:15,793 --> 01:12:17,920
I hear he's much in demand.

1106
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:21,389
All the hostesses in London want him
at their dinner table.

1107
01:12:21,465 --> 01:12:22,523
Yes.

1108
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:26,596
I'm sure they do.

1109
01:12:32,543 --> 01:12:35,740
You should ask him here for the weekend.

1110
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:40,912
Did you...

1111
01:12:41,218 --> 01:12:43,118
fall in love with him?

1112
01:12:51,128 --> 01:12:52,891
He made me like him.

1113
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:05,599
Mr. Pug...

1114
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:10,873
your new island looks lovely.

1115
01:13:14,018 --> 01:13:16,213
At Versailles it was laid down...

1116
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,779
and at Locarno it was confirmed
that Germany was forbidden to take...

1117
01:13:19,857 --> 01:13:22,655
any armed forces into the Rhineland zone.

1118
01:13:22,726 --> 01:13:26,059
And for 18 years,
the fortresses of Frankfurt, Koblenz...

1119
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:29,793
and the other garrison cities on the Rhine
have been empty...

1120
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:32,427
but gradually, under dictator Hitler...

1121
01:13:32,503 --> 01:13:36,166
Germany has been asserting
her independence from treaty obligations.

1122
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,470
First, she left the League of Nations...

1123
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:41,306
then set about rebuilding her army,
navy and air force.

1124
01:13:41,378 --> 01:13:45,075
Until today, when her forces play at war
and mimic battle...

1125
01:13:45,149 --> 01:13:49,210
Germany is seen again to be
one of the great armed powers of Europe.

1126
01:14:12,209 --> 01:14:13,801
We're powerless.

1127
01:14:14,845 --> 01:14:17,746
Hitler's preparing to tear the world apart...

1128
01:14:18,449 --> 01:14:19,780
and we can do nothing.

1129
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:22,045
Of course we can, and we shall.

1130
01:14:23,787 --> 01:14:26,017
I should never have
shown you those papers.

1131
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:27,387
What do you mean?

1132
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,586
Perhaps the Prime Minister's right.

1133
01:14:31,328 --> 01:14:34,320
Perhaps we should try to find a compromise
with Herr Hitler.

1134
01:14:34,398 --> 01:14:37,162
Don't be ridiculous,
you know that's impossible.

1135
01:14:37,234 --> 01:14:40,670
Then perhaps we should
let him have his own way.

1136
01:14:40,971 --> 01:14:44,407
For God's sake, Ralph,
what ridiculous nonsense is this?

1137
01:14:44,475 --> 01:14:48,036
Ralph, you're tired. We should go home.

1138
01:14:48,212 --> 01:14:51,045
Hundreds of thousands of people will die.

1139
01:14:51,315 --> 01:14:52,612
Millions.

1140
01:14:53,517 --> 01:14:55,075
And I shall be responsible.

1141
01:14:55,152 --> 01:14:58,383
-Ralph, that's just not true.
-Partly responsible, then.

1142
01:14:58,455 --> 01:15:01,049
How would you be remotely responsible?

1143
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,616
By showing those papers to Winston.

1144
01:15:03,694 --> 01:15:05,719
By stirring up public opinion.

1145
01:15:05,796 --> 01:15:09,664
By making it impossible for the government
to reach a settlement with the Nazis.

1146
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:13,928
Hitler is unstoppable. In three years,
he's made himself dictator of Germany...

1147
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:16,837
dumped the Treaty of Versailles,
rebuilt the armed forces.

1148
01:15:16,907 --> 01:15:20,775
He'll march into Austria,
and then Czechoslovakia, and then...

1149
01:15:21,412 --> 01:15:23,972
God knows what, the whole of Europe.

1150
01:15:24,848 --> 01:15:26,975
There may be a war.

1151
01:15:27,051 --> 01:15:28,712
I grant you that.

1152
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,647
Nevertheless, we shall win.

1153
01:15:32,156 --> 01:15:33,953
How can you say that?

1154
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:36,585
It's just mindless optimism.

1155
01:15:37,895 --> 01:15:41,695
When I was in school,
I had a friend called Murland Evans...

1156
01:15:42,499 --> 01:15:46,959
and one day we were talking about
what we would do when we were grown up.

1157
01:15:47,705 --> 01:15:50,071
And I don't know why I said this...

1158
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,165
or why I thought it.

1159
01:15:52,943 --> 01:15:54,342
But I said:

1160
01:15:54,812 --> 01:15:59,044
"One day in the future,
Britain will be in great danger...

1161
01:16:00,084 --> 01:16:02,382
"and it will fall to me...

1162
01:16:02,686 --> 01:16:05,052
"to save London and the Empire."

1163
01:16:06,623 --> 01:16:08,284
Schoolboy fantasy.

1164
01:16:09,226 --> 01:16:12,525
I wanted to play for England
and go climb Everest.

1165
01:16:12,696 --> 01:16:14,027
My destiny.

1166
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:18,063
And I truly believe it.

1167
01:16:19,603 --> 01:16:21,867
You're an extraordinary man, Winston.

1168
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:23,531
I am, I know it.

1169
01:16:24,241 --> 01:16:28,439
Nobody but you could say that sort of thing
and expect people to believe it.

1170
01:16:28,512 --> 01:16:30,742
Destiny is what I believe in.

1171
01:16:32,082 --> 01:16:33,845
Destiny commands...

1172
01:16:34,485 --> 01:16:35,975
we must obey.

1173
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,330
Not a very jolly lunch, I'm afraid.

1174
01:16:52,402 --> 01:16:53,960
Look out for yourself, Ava.

1175
01:16:54,037 --> 01:16:56,562
Take care of Ralph, he needs you so much.

1176
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,733
I will. Thank you, Clemmie.

1177
01:17:00,744 --> 01:17:02,006
Goodbye.

1178
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:11,347
"All over Europe...

1179
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:13,848
"is the hush of suspense.

1180
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:18,121
"And in many lands, it is the hush of fear.

1181
01:17:19,863 --> 01:17:22,661
"During these last few years...

1182
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,433
"the world has grown gravely darker.

1183
01:17:27,671 --> 01:17:29,901
"We have steadily disarmed...

1184
01:17:29,973 --> 01:17:34,808
"partly with a sincere desire
to give a lead to other countries...

1185
01:17:35,512 --> 01:17:39,380
"and partly through
the severe financial pressure of the time.

1186
01:17:40,651 --> 01:17:43,211
"But a change must now be made.

1187
01:17:44,655 --> 01:17:50,093
"We must not continue longer on a course
in which we alone are growing weaker...

1188
01:17:50,627 --> 01:17:53,687
"while Germany is growing stronger."

1189
01:17:53,764 --> 01:17:55,129
Hear, hear.

1190
01:18:00,237 --> 01:18:01,932
Prime Minister....

1191
01:18:02,005 --> 01:18:03,802
Hello, Winston.

1192
01:18:06,844 --> 01:18:11,611
I hear there's a nonsensical rumor
that you're about to retire.

1193
01:18:12,349 --> 01:18:14,715
Please, state that that isn't the case.

1194
01:18:14,785 --> 01:18:18,380
I should be making
an official announcement in due course.

1195
01:18:18,455 --> 01:18:22,255
But please, be discrete,
I don't want everybody to know.

1196
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:24,226
I'm very surprised.

1197
01:18:24,628 --> 01:18:27,495
You're much loved in the country, Stanley.

1198
01:18:27,598 --> 01:18:29,896
I've had my day. I'm exhausted.

1199
01:18:30,334 --> 01:18:35,033
You know, some days I am so tired,
I can hardly turn over the pages of a book.

1200
01:18:36,974 --> 01:18:39,272
We've had our differences.

1201
01:18:39,776 --> 01:18:41,801
Profound differences.

1202
01:18:42,946 --> 01:18:44,777
But I've always admired...

1203
01:18:44,848 --> 01:18:47,715
your great political skills.

1204
01:18:49,586 --> 01:18:51,781
Winston, let me tell you something.

1205
01:18:51,855 --> 01:18:56,485
To my mind, war is the greatest folly
that can afflict mankind.

1206
01:18:56,560 --> 01:19:00,087
-Absolutely, no question about it--
-Please, don't interrupt.

1207
01:19:00,163 --> 01:19:04,099
Maybe you're right about Hitler.
Perhaps this war is inevitable.

1208
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:06,567
But I believe that I am also right.

1209
01:19:06,637 --> 01:19:10,095
I have done everything in my power
to preserve peace...

1210
01:19:10,173 --> 01:19:13,506
and I would do exactly the same,
all over again.

1211
01:19:14,912 --> 01:19:16,675
Bloodshed, sorrow...

1212
01:19:17,114 --> 01:19:18,877
irreparable loss...

1213
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:22,585
that's what I've been hoping to prevent.

1214
01:19:22,953 --> 01:19:24,750
But, as I say...

1215
01:19:25,756 --> 01:19:27,656
you may well be right.

1216
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:51,070
So many telegrams today!

1217
01:19:51,915 --> 01:19:54,247
German troops are on the march.

1218
01:19:54,451 --> 01:19:57,750
Thousands of them. Hence all the telegrams.

1219
01:19:58,255 --> 01:20:02,214
Hitler's planning to invade the world,
and we're planning to do nothing about it.

1220
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,453
What do you make of that, Marjorie?

1221
01:20:05,595 --> 01:20:10,089
Perhaps we should go home?
Or we could take a stroll in St. James's Park.

1222
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:15,331
It's remarkable weather for this time of year,
and we're hardly much use here, are we?

1223
01:20:21,578 --> 01:20:23,375
Sorry, Marjorie.

1224
01:20:25,148 --> 01:20:26,809
It's a poor joke.

1225
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:33,885
Thank you for these.

1226
01:20:39,663 --> 01:20:43,599
Marjorie, I meant to ask,
what time is the defense meeting tomorrow?

1227
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:46,830
I don't think you're required
at that meeting, Mr. Wigram.

1228
01:20:46,903 --> 01:20:49,531
We haven't received any notification.

1229
01:20:51,041 --> 01:20:52,531
Not required?

1230
01:20:55,412 --> 01:20:56,538
Fine.

1231
01:20:58,415 --> 01:21:00,542
Funny how word gets around.

1232
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:09,887
Thank you very much.
Come on, my little man.

1233
01:21:13,296 --> 01:21:15,730
Charlie, it's snowing, how lovely.

1234
01:21:15,865 --> 01:21:18,527
-Ethel, can you manage?
-Yes, thank you, ma'am.

1235
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:23,231
We should go find Daddy in the garden
and make a snowman, what do you think?

1236
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:26,604
Oh, silly Mommy.

1237
01:21:28,712 --> 01:21:30,145
Silly Mommy!

1238
01:21:32,916 --> 01:21:37,478
We wish you a merry Christmas
We wish you a merry Christmas

1239
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:41,784
We wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year

1240
01:21:42,892 --> 01:21:45,053
-Shall I take him?
-Thank you.

1241
01:21:45,128 --> 01:21:48,291
Come on, young man,
what you need is a bath!

1242
01:21:48,365 --> 01:21:49,696
Good bath.

1243
01:21:50,734 --> 01:21:52,395
Be up in a minute.

1244
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,134
Ralph?

1245
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:02,400
What's wrong?

1246
01:22:03,246 --> 01:22:04,508
Nothing.

1247
01:22:06,015 --> 01:22:07,880
-Drink?
-Please.

1248
01:22:54,631 --> 01:22:56,826
The snow has settled.

1249
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,191
How wonderful.

1250
01:22:59,469 --> 01:23:03,166
We must take Charlie to the park,
he's never seen snow like this.

1251
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:05,503
So beautiful, like a painting.

1252
01:23:06,309 --> 01:23:09,836
You must telephone to the office.
Tell them you won't be in today.

1253
01:23:09,946 --> 01:23:13,939
Just for two or three hours.
It is Christmas, after all. They'll spare you.

1254
01:23:14,317 --> 01:23:18,583
I'm afraid I absolutely forbid you
to go to work on a day like today.

1255
01:23:33,303 --> 01:23:35,498
Poor turnout from Whitehall.

1256
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:37,972
I know, pretty bloody awful.

1257
01:23:38,541 --> 01:23:43,001
We had lunch with him a few days ago,
and he was very upset then.

1258
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:45,980
I was quite frightened. Do you think--

1259
01:23:46,049 --> 01:23:49,883
It says a pulmonary hemorrhage
on the death certificate.

1260
01:23:49,953 --> 01:23:52,581
I think we should leave it at that.

1261
01:24:11,908 --> 01:24:15,207
He said it was all pointless,
everything he tried to do.

1262
01:24:17,113 --> 01:24:18,774
Was it pointless?

1263
01:24:21,217 --> 01:24:23,651
His life was very precious to me.

1264
01:24:25,355 --> 01:24:27,323
Please, tell me it wasn't wasted.

1265
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:30,757
Ava, my dear, you'll be very proud of him.

1266
01:24:31,427 --> 01:24:33,987
People often act heroically...

1267
01:24:34,063 --> 01:24:37,897
because they don't fully appreciate
the dangers that lie ahead.

1268
01:24:37,967 --> 01:24:41,596
Ralph saw all those dangers
and was afraid of them...

1269
01:24:42,605 --> 01:24:46,200
but he did what he did, in spite of his fear.

1270
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,804
No man can be braver than that.

1271
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,209
Thank you, Winston.

1272
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,685
What is it?

1273
01:25:32,789 --> 01:25:34,620
Any invading force...

1274
01:25:35,525 --> 01:25:38,426
would march across
our little bit of England...

1275
01:25:38,494 --> 01:25:40,428
on their way to London.

1276
01:25:43,399 --> 01:25:45,560
I wonder how long we've got.

1277
01:25:58,648 --> 01:26:00,172
This is London.

1278
01:26:00,249 --> 01:26:03,343
You will now hear a statement
by the Prime Minister...

1279
01:26:03,419 --> 01:26:06,183
the right honorable Neville Chamberlain.

1280
01:26:06,322 --> 01:26:08,552
I am speaking to you...

1281
01:26:08,825 --> 01:26:12,226
from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.

1282
01:26:13,696 --> 01:26:17,860
This morning,
the British ambassador in Berlin...

1283
01:26:17,967 --> 01:26:21,903
handed the German government
a final note...

1284
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:27,137
stating that
unless we heard from them by 1 1:00...

1285
01:26:27,944 --> 01:26:30,412
that they were prepared at once...

1286
01:26:30,613 --> 01:26:33,343
to withdraw their troops from Poland...

1287
01:26:33,416 --> 01:26:36,476
a state of war would exist between us.

1288
01:26:39,155 --> 01:26:44,092
I have to tell you now that
no such undertaking has been received...

1289
01:26:45,128 --> 01:26:46,891
and that, consequently...

1290
01:26:46,963 --> 01:26:50,660
this country is at war with Germany.

1291
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:03,702
Mr. Churchill!

1292
01:27:04,313 --> 01:27:06,178
Upstairs, Mrs. P.

1293
01:27:06,249 --> 01:27:09,878
-What's the matter?
-Telephone, sir. The Prime Minister's office.

1294
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:31,764
First Lord of the Admiralty, back in power!

1295
01:27:34,209 --> 01:27:37,144
Jolly good show, marvelous!

1296
01:27:40,448 --> 01:27:43,212
I have been made a member
of the War Cabinet.

1297
01:27:43,285 --> 01:27:46,743
Mrs. Churchill and l
must now make our home in London.

1298
01:27:47,222 --> 01:27:50,988
Needless to say, we shall return to Chartwell
whenever possible.

1299
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:53,391
Every one of you will be looked after...

1300
01:27:53,461 --> 01:27:57,022
and either retained here,
or found good jobs elsewhere.

1301
01:27:57,098 --> 01:27:59,430
Mr. Inches has all the details.

1302
01:28:00,135 --> 01:28:03,229
There may be
difficult and painful times ahead.

1303
01:28:03,872 --> 01:28:06,568
But now that I'm in charge of the Navy...

1304
01:28:06,641 --> 01:28:10,509
Mr. Hitler and his Nazi thugs
had better look out.

1305
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:13,776
We're going to teach them a lesson
they'll never forget!

1306
01:28:16,618 --> 01:28:18,176
Good luck, sir.

1307
01:28:40,742 --> 01:28:43,734
Mr. Inches, I think a glass of champagne
might be in order.

1308
01:28:43,812 --> 01:28:47,043
With respect, sir,
I think we might save that for happier days.

1309
01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:48,139
Quite right.

1310
01:28:48,216 --> 01:28:51,083
However, there's a good claret
you may be interested in.

1311
01:28:51,152 --> 01:28:54,644
It is a very good year,
I can't tell you which year.

1312
01:29:06,101 --> 01:29:09,093
Not the House of Commons, the Admiralty!

1313
01:29:09,904 --> 01:29:11,838
I've got a navy to run!

1314
01:29:37,899 --> 01:29:40,527
Just before the Battle of Blenheim...

1315
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:44,100
Marlborough said to his aide:

1316
01:29:44,873 --> 01:29:48,001
"Today, I conquer or die."

1317
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:52,145
Now I know how he felt.

1318
01:29:58,153 --> 01:29:59,518
Thank you.

1319
01:30:00,989 --> 01:30:02,286
For what?

1320
01:30:03,258 --> 01:30:05,954
For being rash enough to marry me...

1321
01:30:06,294 --> 01:30:09,286
foolish enough to stay with me...

1322
01:30:10,799 --> 01:30:14,257
and for loving me in a way...

1323
01:30:14,669 --> 01:30:17,194
I thought I'd never be loved.

1324
01:31:03,184 --> 01:31:04,446
At ease.

1325
01:31:07,555 --> 01:31:09,750
-Good evening.
-Good evening, sir.

1326
01:31:09,824 --> 01:31:12,622
-I'm the new First Lord.
-Yes, sir, we know that.

1327
01:31:12,694 --> 01:31:13,854
How do you know?

1328
01:31:13,928 --> 01:31:16,726
A signal was sent to the fleet this afternoon.

1329
01:31:16,798 --> 01:31:18,231
What signal?

1330
01:31:18,633 --> 01:31:20,567
"Winston is back," sir.

1331
01:31:22,904 --> 01:31:24,599
"Winston is back."

1332
01:31:28,143 --> 01:31:30,475
And so he bloody well is!
