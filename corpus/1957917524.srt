1
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,958
Literally walking here!

2
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,333
You little brat!

3
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,708
Nobody is stealing your toilet paper,
Grandma.

4
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,875
He asked me to come to his comedy show.

5
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,791
I swear.
The best Broadway show last night.

6
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:54,833
COMING SOON

7
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,583
KAHMUNRAH
The Disappointing Son

8
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,416
FRAGILE

9
00:02:16,916 --> 00:02:20,291
<i>I got rhythm</i>
<i>I've got a new job</i>

10
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:23,375
<i>Your boy, Ronnie's gonna be a star</i>

11
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,958
Holy cow! Look at this place.

12
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,125
The acoustics are… amazing--

13
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,458
Well, look at you, big guy.

14
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,708
Try not to upstage me, Mr. Naughty Bones.

15
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:41,458
Okay, Ronnie, just gotta get through
this snoozefest of a night job,

16
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:46,500
nail your auditions during the day,
and then Broadway pays the bills, baby.

17
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,416
Night Guard

18
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:52,458
A manual, huh?

19
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,541
INSTRUCTION MANUAL

20
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,250
I'm more of an improv guy.

21
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,416
Man, being this talented is exhausting.

22
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,041
I'm awake.

23
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,041
What?

24
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:19,500
Hello?

25
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:27,166
What? Where'd you come from? Give me that.

26
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,708
That's stealing,
you thieving little chimp!

27
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,041
That's no chimp.

28
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:35,833
That's a capuchin, a new-world monkey
from Central and South America,

29
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:38,958
donated to this museum in the year 1962.

30
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:40,375
Who are you supposed to be?

31
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,208
Theodore Roosevelt,
President of these United States.

32
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,291
Great. My first night,
and I get a wacko with a monkey.

33
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:50,208
-I'm calling the police.
-I wouldn't do that.

34
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:57,541
I give this guy three minutes, tops.

35
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,916
Are you the new night guard?

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,333
Yeah.

37
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,458
Good.
'Cause we never found the old night guard.

38
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,291
He swears he didn't eat him!

39
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,916
Night guard!

40
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,041
Laaa make popcorn.

41
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,416
Popcorn hot.

42
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,208
-Did you see where he went?
-Huh?

43
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,041
No. He's a slippery one.

44
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,083
Yep.

45
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,041
Found you, night guard!

46
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,000
Tiny people!

47
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,500
Hey! Who are you calling tiny, Gigantor?

48
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,875
-Stop right there.
-Huh?

49
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:19,083
I, Joan of Arc,
have had a heavenly vision of the future,

50
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,500
and you're not in it because you're dead.
Boop.

51
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,416
Come on.

52
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:37,333
Why?

53
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,416
Why?

54
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:48,041
Two minutes and two seconds.
That's a new record, everyone!

55
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,208
Hope you had fun-fun, dumb-dumb.

56
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,583
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

57
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:58,250
Forget this job! Forget Broadway!

58
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,125
-I'm going back to Ohio!
-Hey.

59
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,666
Great. There goes another one.

60
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:21,041
Seriously, guys? Again?

61
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,125
Evening, Lawrence.

62
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,791
I presume you saw that man
fleeing in abject terror?

63
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,125
Very funny, Teddy.

64
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,916
But listen, you gotta stop
scaring the new guys off, okay?

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,125
I'm leaving for the summer,
and I need someone to replace me.

66
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,458
Sorry, Larry,
but he wasn't a good fit for us.

67
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:38,000
If only there were a fine young gentleman
with your last name

68
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,500
that would be a perfect fit
for this institution.

69
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,125
Dropping hints left and right.

70
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:44,875
Oh, no. I'll call McPhee.

71
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,458
Mother, this bubble bath you sent me
is too sudsy.

72
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,375
I can't find my boats.

73
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,291
Dr. McPhee, it's Larry.

74
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,208
Right!

75
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:07,541
Well, just so you know, "Mother" is my
pet name for my supermodel girlfriend.

76
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,625
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

77
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,916
Well, we got a little problem.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,541
The new night guard
that you just hired just quit.

79
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,291
Woe is me.

80
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,625
Where else in New York City will I find

81
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,666
someone who's capable of sitting at a desk
and staring blankly into space?

82
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,625
Besides, this isn't your problem.

83
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,708
You're going off to your
fancy new position at the Tokyo Museum.

84
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,500
Look, I still really care
about this place, all right?

85
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,416
And I'm gonna find
the right person for the job.

86
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,875
<i>Whatever. I'm doing my pores now.</i>

87
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,625
What am I gonna do?

88
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,291
Here's an idea that we just came up with.
What about Master Nick?

89
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,458
You know,
the smaller, healthier version of you?

90
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,416
Ha ha.

91
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,166
But why do you guys keep insisting
that I hire my son?

92
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,833
-He knows the secret of this place.
-Why, he practically grew up here.

93
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,958
-And he would never run away.
-Like the last guy. Remember him?

94
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,583
Yeah. He was just here.

95
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:57,750
I don't know.

96
00:07:57,833 --> 00:08:01,166
This is a big job, and Nick's still trying
to find his footing and confidence.

97
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,875
I mean, he's still just a teenager.

98
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,416
Teenager schmeenager. You were
a teenager when you first started.

99
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,375
No, I wasn't.

100
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,916
I meant mentally. Emotionally.

101
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,875
Larry, Nick is a smart, capable kid,

102
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:16,500
and we believe that he is the perfect fit
to protect this museum.

103
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,083
Huh. You might be right.
Maybe it is Nick's time to shine.

104
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,666
-Coming through!
-Huh?

105
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,958
Out of the way! Step aside!

106
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:27,958
Sorry.

107
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:40,416
Mia.

108
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,916
Are you okay?

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah. Hi, Mia.

110
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:52,750
What brings you here
to this side of the hallway?

111
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:58,750
I'm auditioning for jazz band next fall.
Aren't you, Mr. DJ Perfect Pitch?

112
00:08:58,833 --> 00:08:59,666
Wow.

113
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,000
You can correctly identify
any note in any song at any time,

114
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,916
and suddenly you've got a nickname.

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,125
I think it's cool.

116
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,791
You dropped an orange.

117
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,708
Yeah.

118
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,125
My mom makes me take a piece of fruit
whenever I leave the house.

119
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,291
Then she texts me to make sure I ate it.

120
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,375
That's her now.

121
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,458
"Orange you getting hungry?"

122
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,583
Okay. That's not embarrassing.

123
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:24,750
Fruit jokes. Very mom.

124
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,458
So, I heard you got a summer job
at a yogurt place?

125
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,041
Yeah. It was that
or play bass in a subway station

126
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,583
for loose change
and unsolicited criticism.

127
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,250
Cool.

128
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,291
I mean, yogurt's cool.
Otherwise, it would melt.

129
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,916
High five for yogurt. Never mind.

130
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,208
Don't know why I did that.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,166
So, since you're gonna be here for
the summer, maybe you want to,

132
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,458
maybe one night, you know, go on--

133
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,125
Wait! I forgot, I'm late for my--

134
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:59,958
Nick Daley.
This is your last call. I'm waiting.

135
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,750
Sorry, Ms. Montefusco.

136
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm auditioning for jazz band in the fall.

137
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,000
I didn't know you played an instrument.

138
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,708
Well, technically, I don't.

139
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,583
-You're a singer?
-No.

140
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,750
-Deck crew?
-No.

141
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,000
-Tech crew?
-Uh-uh.

142
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,166
-Composer?
-No.

143
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,500
-Roadie?
-Nope.

144
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,791
-Stand mover-upper-downer?
-No, ma'am.

145
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:26,833
Are you sure you're in the right room?
Because that last one wasn't even a thing.

146
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,708
Actually, I'm a deejay.

147
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,291
A deejay?

148
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,416
I know this may seem a little out-there,

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,458
but I have this idea
to accompany the band.

150
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,083
I'd start with a classic jazz loop,

151
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,791
and mix it with a vaporwave thing
with some microtonality,

152
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,583
and two against three polyrhythms.

153
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,500
A what?

154
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,458
It's a multi-tonal PolyWave that--

155
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,125
Never mind the technical name.

156
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:51,333
There's a little bit of a buildup,
but wait till you hear the bass drop.

157
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:56,791
Okay. Here we go.

158
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,791
I'm right on time for my audition slot,

159
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,041
<i>Ms. Montefusco</i>

160
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,666
<i>'Cause everyone knows</i>
<i>Being on time is cool</i>

161
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,500
What's up, Rick?

162
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,500
Hi, Bodhi. It's Nick.

163
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,791
And your low E-string
is a quarter tone off.

164
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,958
Wait your turn, Bodhi.

165
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,166
Nick here was just
in the middle of convincing me

166
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,125
to add a deejay to jazz band.

167
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:40,416
A jazz band deejay?
That sounds so not normal.

168
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,166
Let's give him a chance, Bodhi.

169
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,458
It takes guts to try something
with such a high chance of failure.

170
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,458
To risk that kind of embarrassment,

171
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,166
he must be extremely confident
in his abilities.

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,833
Okay. Here we go.

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,166
Oh, sorry, that was the wrong one.

174
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,083
Wait.

175
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:06,166
Forget it. This was a terrible idea.

176
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,916
-Actually, I--
-What was I thinking?

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,750
I'm sorry I wasted your time,
and possibly broke your piano.

178
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,250
I'll just take my leave.

179
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:16,541
I mean, who says that, right?
I'll be going now.

180
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,750
Nick, wait.

181
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:21,541
Ms. Montefusco, I'm pretty sure it's Rick.

182
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,125
Yo, Nick. How'd the audition go?

183
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,791
Great! Just great.

184
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:30,208
I was so extremely confident
in my abilities that I decided to quit,

185
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,541
and, you know, leave them wanting more.

186
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,541
Okay.

187
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,083
So, you were saying something
before you went in.

188
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,791
How we're both gonna be here
over the summer,

189
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,250
and how, I don't know,
maybe we should go on a…

190
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,791
What? No.

191
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,500
I just,
I was just gonna wish you good luck.

192
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,750
Okay. Well, have a great summer, I guess.

193
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,750
Yeah. Bye.

194
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,083
I'm such an idiot.

195
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,458
All right.

196
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:04,208
Classic Daley father-son dinner night
just like old times.

197
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,625
Yay. Dinner.

198
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,375
Man. I'm sorry about your audition, bud.

199
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:09,458
How you holding up?

200
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,208
I don't know what's wrong with me.

201
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:16,375
I can't get in the band.
I can't ask the girl I like out.

202
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:17,541
I'm useless.

203
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,041
It's like I step up
to the free-throw line,

204
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,333
but I'm so afraid of missing the shot
that I don't take it at all.

205
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,250
Basketball metaphors. Okay.

206
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:29,583
Well, buddy, you miss 100% of the shots
you don't take.

207
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,166
Although, I guess if you're at the line,

208
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,791
that's a free throw,
so you have to take it.

209
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,208
It doesn't matter.

210
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,583
Anyway, speaking of taking a shot,

211
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:39,458
what if I told you
I got you the best summer job ever?

212
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,791
Is it at a beach resort in Saint Bart's?

213
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:42,875
What? No.

214
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,416
Wait for it.

215
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Night guard at the museum!

216
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:47,416
What?

217
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:49,791
That's hot.

218
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:52,416
Are you serious?

219
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Yes!

220
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,041
Now that I'm gonna be
director of the Tokyo Museum,

221
00:13:56,125 --> 00:14:00,125
I need someone to take my place, and
you're the only person who fits the bill.

222
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,291
It's just,

223
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,583
I love hanging out
with everyone at the museum,

224
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:06,000
but a night guard is a big deal.

225
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,916
I literally can't do anything right.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,333
You do not want me
in charge of a museum, okay?

227
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,916
I'll just mess it up.

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,791
Buddy,
when have you ever messed anything up?

229
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,208
Dang it.

230
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,166
Here.

231
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,541
Thanks.

232
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,250
I don't know, Dad.

233
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,125
Just 'cause you did the job
doesn't mean I can.

234
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,125
I'm not sure I've got what it takes.

235
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,958
Sure you do. You're a Daley.

236
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,208
Anyway.

237
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,750
Look, Nicky, I know you've been
knocked down a couple of times,

238
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,166
but that's just
'cause you're not seeing things through.

239
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,625
You just need to get your confidence back.

240
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,375
And I've got a hunch that
this museum job will do just that.

241
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,375
How?

242
00:14:48,458 --> 00:14:50,750
You're just gonna have to
trust me on this.

243
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,250
That museum has a way of
bringing things to life,

244
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,291
and I'm not just talking
about the exhibits.

245
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,625
So, what do you say?

246
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,791
Okay.
But I'm pretty sure Mom has other plans.

247
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,916
Oh, trust me.

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,916
Your mother and I have
co-parenting down to a science,

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,291
and she is going to love this museum idea.

250
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,291
I don't love this museum idea.

251
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,166
-J--
-Nope!

252
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,333
I'm telling you, Erica,
this is a good idea.

253
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:23,416
Larry, have you ever noticed that all of
your ideas revolve around the museum?

254
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:26,958
Nick, could you give us a minute?

255
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,041
Sure.

256
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,333
I thought you guys were
gonna go somewhere else.

257
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:37,416
Okay. Yeah, no,
I'll just go work on my music,

258
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,750
which will never be appreciated by anyone.

259
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,291
Night guard?

260
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,708
Do you really think that's gonna help Nick
become a confident and capable adult?

261
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,291
He doesn't even return my fruit texts.

262
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,291
You're one in a melon

263
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,250
What?

264
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,083
Look, I know he's got
some growing up to do,

265
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,916
but I think this job is precisely
what he needs.

266
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,625
Along with a soundproof room.

267
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,583
How is Nick supposed to learn how to
lead people if he's all alone in a museum?

268
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,291
No, no, no, he won't be alone.

269
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,250
There's a big, fun, you know, night crew.

270
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:14,916
Night crew?

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,791
I really think we should sign Nick up

272
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,250
for the
Genius Entrepreneurship Enrichment Camp.

273
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,500
You realize that spells "Geec," right?

274
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,500
Right. Well, math is the new sports.

275
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,625
Look, Larry--

276
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,083
Erica, you remember what I was like
before we split up.

277
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:33,000
I was not my best self. I just wasn't.

278
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:36,250
But that museum job,
it changed me for the better,

279
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,000
and I think it'll change Nick too.

280
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,125
You know what, Larry? You're right.
You did change.

281
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,291
And, I don't know how or why,
but working there turned your life around.

282
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,333
Almost like magic.

283
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:47,666
Watch it.

284
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:49,916
Yeah. Almost.

285
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,250
You know, you and I didn't always
see eye to eye as a couple,

286
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,750
but you've always been a good dad.

287
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,958
If you think this will help Nick,
I'm willing to give it a try.

288
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,125
Thank you.

289
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,041
For what it's worth,
we still make a pretty good team.

290
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,166
Yeah.

291
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,750
But if anything happens
to my sweet baby boy,

292
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,833
I will go to Japan and personally
throw you into Mount Fuji!

293
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,291
That's fair.

294
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,750
Nicky, was that all you?
Bud, you've got real talent.

295
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:32,083
Thanks, but no one's ever gonna hear it.

296
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,541
Well, how about a little good news?

297
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,166
Mom said yes! You start tomorrow.

298
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:37,708
Cool.

299
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,541
Hey, if I can do it, I know you can.

300
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,625
You'll be fine.

301
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:44,125
Because, if anything happens to you,
your mom's gonna kill me.

302
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:45,291
But it won't.

303
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,958
This is your shot, kid. Here.

304
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,291
You're gonna need it.

305
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,583
It's yours now.

306
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:53,791
I believe in you, Nicky.

307
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,125
That makes one of us.

308
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:12,166
Well, well, well. If it isn't Nick Daley,
my new night watchman.

309
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,250
Right on time at three minutes late.

310
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,833
Sorry, Dr. McPhee.

311
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,791
Look, the only reason I agreed
to give you this position

312
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,208
is because your late father--

313
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,541
My father's still alive.

314
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:26,750
I know, but he was always late,
just like you are right now.

315
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:30,000
Anyway, he assured me
you'd be a responsible replacement.

316
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,916
My feeling is that you won't be

317
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,125
because I inherently distrust
and dislike teenagers.

318
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,000
-Dang it.
-That slipped out.

319
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,083
Oh, no.

320
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:43,333
Okay. Well, you probably have important
museum doctor stuff to do, so--

321
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:44,541
Rexy, heel.

322
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,666
That was weird. You're a weird boy,
and you make me uncomfortable.

323
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,000
If anything happens
to my priceless exhibits,

324
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:55,000
it's coming out of your paycheck.

325
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,875
And please
don't do anything fireable tonight.

326
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,875
Okay, he's gone!

327
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,041
Night guard!

328
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,166
Yeah!

329
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,916
Hey, everybody.

330
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:14,958
Nice to see you too, Dexter.

331
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:19,208
Here's your crown back, Attila.

332
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,708
-Nick.
-You're welcome.

333
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,416
Nick. Nick, Nick, Nicky, Nicky, Nick!

334
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,791
Very inventive, Laaa.

335
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:35,750
But please put the extinguisher back
when you're done with it.

336
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,625
Good idea.

337
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,250
It's great to see you again, Nick.

338
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:49,166
What a fantastic idea
to hire you for this position.

339
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,291
-I wonder whose idea that was, huh?
-Right.

340
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,416
You have some foam on your nose.

341
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,541
We're thrilled that you will be
carrying on the Daley tradition.

342
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:03,875
Not "daily," as in daytime.
"Daley," as in your last name.

343
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:08,125
Obviously, you will be working at night.
I'll stop talking now so you can speak.

344
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,625
It'll be great to hang out
with you guys every night.

345
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,333
I just hope I'm up to the job.

346
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:17,375
Of course you are.
All you need is grit, moxie, and--

347
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,041
Give me gum-gum, Dumb-Dumb's son-son.

348
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,958
My name's Nick, and I don't have gum.

349
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,083
You do now,

350
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,791
'cause you stepped in some-some.

351
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,250
I'm just gonna block him out.

352
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,583
Nicola!

353
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,250
Never turn your back on conflict.

354
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,750
We must have the courage
to face our enemies,

355
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,000
not bury our heads in the sand
like the cowardly ostrich.

356
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,000
Not everything is about you, Jiji.

357
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:46,208
Right. Thanks, Joan. Good advice.

358
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,083
She scares me a little.

359
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,291
I know, right?

360
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:55,500
Just as the Roman army
was emboldened to take Carthage,

361
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:59,625
we shall now take that giant candy bar!

362
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,833
Charge!

363
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,250
Yeah!

364
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,125
Jedediah. Octavius.

365
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:16,291
You guys are gonna need a longer rope.
Or some cash.

366
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,041
Want me to unwrap it for you?

367
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,166
That won't be necessary, Nicholas.

368
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,625
I am a master swordsman,
trained in the elite Praetorian guard.

369
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,375
Maybe you could
just rip the corner a little.

370
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,416
I love me my nougats.

371
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,916
Nick! We have a surprise for you.

372
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,875
In honor of your first night
at the museum, we all got you gifts.

373
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,666
Mine is my old glasses case.

374
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:55,250
Thanks, Teddy. But I don't wear glasses.
Also, somebody shot this?

375
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:58,083
That case saved me
from an assassin's bullet.

376
00:21:58,166 --> 00:22:01,125
I consider it a good luck charm,
and I'd like you to have it.

377
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,083
Of course, now and again,

378
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,708
I'll need to borrow it
to put my glasses in, or sometimes mints.

379
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,125
I keep mints in it also. Little secret.

380
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,875
Here, Nick.

381
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:15,333
Thanks, Sacagawea.
Authentic Shoshone Indian beads.

382
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,416
Actually, they're from the gift shop.

383
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,125
I also got you this poster.

384
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,750
A poster of your museum.

385
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:23,208
Our museum.

386
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:24,291
Thanks.

387
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:27,833
Hey, Dexter. Is that banana for me?

388
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,125
Laaa unscathed.

389
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,833
I've been reading Laaa the dictionary.
Trying to build his vocabulary.

390
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:45,750
Sacagawea adequate teacher.

391
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,916
Hey, guys, my dad's calling.

392
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,083
Say hi, everybody.

393
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,208
<i>Laaa!</i>

394
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,291
<i>Dada!</i>

395
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm not your father, Laaa.
We've covered this.

396
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,958
<i>So, how's the Tokyo Museum?</i>

397
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,208
It's pretty cool.

398
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,458
They've got a robot here that gives tours.

399
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,708
<i>Welcome to the Tokyo Museum.</i>

400
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:07,250
And the toilets? Smarter than I am.

401
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,875
<i>Welcome to the toilet.</i>

402
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,708
<i>Anyway, you know the rule.</i>

403
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:16,166
Yep.
"The tablet brings everything to life,

404
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,958
and everyone's gotta be in the museum
by sunrise, or they turn to dust."

405
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,333
Established that.

406
00:23:21,416 --> 00:23:25,833
Right, but just one more thing.
Don't forget to lock the basement.

407
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:27,166
The basement?

408
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,250
Sure. No problem.

409
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,125
<i>Right, but before you do that,</i>

410
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:37,250
<i>I'm gonna need you to go down</i>
<i>through the basement</i>

411
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,500
<i>and lock the loading dock.</i>

412
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,375
Do I have to, Dad?

413
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,916
<i>Hey, gang,</i>
<i>can you give me and my son a moment?</i>

414
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,833
-Yeah, sure.
-You got it.

415
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,958
-These are the moments you remember.
-Cat's in the cradle. Roger that.

416
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,125
We'll be over here
looking at something else.

417
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,375
<i>Nicky, I know you've always been</i>
<i>afraid of the basement, and that's okay</i>

418
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,750
<i>because there's some seriously</i>
<i>scary stuff down there.</i>

419
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,208
<i>But this is</i>
<i>the most important part of the job.</i>

420
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:09,708
<i>Sometimes new exhibits come in,</i>
<i>and they could be dangerous.</i>

421
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:11,625
Okay. Got it.

422
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:14,166
<i>You're going to be fine, buddy. All right?</i>

423
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,375
<i>I know the museum's</i>
<i>in good hands with you,</i>

424
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,625
<i>because you're not just my son,</i>
<i>you're the best person I know.</i>

425
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,208
<i>And you can do anything,</i>

426
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,083
<i>specifically starting with</i>
<i>locking the loading dock, I would advise.</i>

427
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:26,541
<i>Gotta go.</i>

428
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,416
<i>I tried ordering pizza in Japanese,</i>

429
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,916
and some delivery guy just showed up
with several tanks of lobsters. So…

430
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,166
Bye, Dad.

431
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,333
All right, Nick. Here we go!

432
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:40,583
Your first big charge as the night guard.
We're all counting on you to keep us safe.

433
00:24:40,666 --> 00:24:46,416
Okay. Off to the basement!
Off I go. What could go wrong?

434
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,875
He'll be all right, right?

435
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:54,125
Oh, he'll be fine. You heard the man.
What could go wrong?

436
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:02,333
Come on, Nick. You're the night guard now,
and you just gotta lock the loading dock.

437
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,041
Don't be scared.

438
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:09,125
It's really scary in here.
Just don't be scared.

439
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,625
Dad said the one thing I have to do
is lock the loading dock.

440
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,250
And that's all I gotta do. That's it.

441
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:18,166
'Cause I'm the night guard,
and it's my job to lock the loading dock.

442
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:20,875
Gotta get through this.

443
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,500
Get it off! Goodbye.

444
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,708
Okay, how hard can this be?

445
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,333
Nuts.

446
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:33,000
Come on. Come on.

447
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,708
What was that?

448
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,125
Oh, no.

449
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,208
Whoops.

450
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,375
Stupid keys. Which key is it?

451
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:42,875
Come on, come on, come on!

452
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,041
Well, good enough!

453
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,541
I love messing with the new guys.

454
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,916
You think we were too much?

455
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,833
Nah. Why should the gang upstairs
have all the fun?

456
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,625
Behold!

457
00:26:18,708 --> 00:26:21,625
As written by Anubis
in the <i>Book of the Dead</i>,

458
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:25,333
I, Kahmunrah, have returned!

459
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:32,083
Time to commence my plan
to rule the world!

460
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:37,625
Which is going to have to wait a sec
because my foot's asleep.

461
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,083
Wake up, foot. Wake up.

462
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,750
I command you to stop tingling!

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,166
Welp, all done locking the loading dock
with locks.

464
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,708
So, how did it go?

465
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:54,458
Oh, dear. Why are you so sweaty?

466
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,166
Global warming?

467
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,291
Come on. Who knew burning coal
would lead to all this?

468
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,250
Did someone turn on a fan?

469
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:10,166
I'm sure Woolly just broke some wind.

470
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,416
Well, no judgment here.

471
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,791
But let's clean these up.

472
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,958
Can't have a mess
my first night on the job.

473
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:20,791
Wait! There's something missing.

474
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:22,583
Well,
it's not the locked loading dock door.

475
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:24,875
That's not missing, because I locked it.

476
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:29,625
No. The tablet! The tablet is missing!

477
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,083
Come on, guys.

478
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:36,375
If we don't find that tablet,
everyone in this museum is in danger.

479
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:38,333
-She's right. Let's go.
-Bully!

480
00:27:38,416 --> 00:27:39,708
Oh, no.

481
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,541
Where could it be? Who could've taken it?

482
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:48,083
I did.

483
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:52,666
That's right, Larry, I'm back, and you…

484
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,125
Look different? Have you had work done?

485
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,416
Larry's my dad.
Who are you supposed to be?

486
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,791
Zip it, son of Larry.

487
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:06,875
You will refer to me as Kahmunrah,
King of Kings.

488
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,958
-Good gravy!
-Nick!

489
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:13,708
Your father thought he defeated me,
but I'm back with a vengeance.

490
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,166
Where did you even come from?

491
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,208
The basement. Duh.

492
00:28:18,291 --> 00:28:19,541
I thought you locked it.

493
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,000
I did.

494
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:23,875
Okay, I heard a scary noise
and I chickened out.

495
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:27,166
That was me! I was the scary noise.

496
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,250
I was trying this new guttural thing.

497
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,958
Well, it worked better
with the acoustics in the basement.

498
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,541
And now that I have the tablet,

499
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:43,500
I'll use it to awaken
my army of the underworld.

500
00:28:43,583 --> 00:28:44,583
That sounds bad.

501
00:28:45,166 --> 00:28:46,958
It is bad.

502
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,291
And don't interrupt me.

503
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:52,250
I'll rule the world, and--

504
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,958
Dude, just give me back the tablet.

505
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:58,041
You did it again. You interrupted me.
I want to kill you so many times.

506
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,333
Kahmunrah.

507
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:13,625
As I was saying, I'll rule the world,
and everyone will bow to me.

508
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,791
Kahmunrah out.

509
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,041
Quick, he's headed
through the Hall of Miniatures.

510
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,791
Where do you think you're going,
tough guy?

511
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:27,375
Feel the wrath of my mighty sword!

512
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,958
Fire!

513
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:39,916
Fie on my penchant for sandals.

514
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
There he is!

515
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:44,625
Get back here,
so I can stab you in the other foot!

516
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:46,250
Come on, guys.

517
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,333
Charge!

518
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,875
-Nick!
-Oh, no!

519
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,333
Thank the god of personal training.

520
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,083
And with power like that,

521
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:04,875
you'll never stop me from taking revenge
on all those who doubted me.

522
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,041
Especially you, Daddy.

523
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,375
You wouldn't let me be king of Egypt.

524
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:15,625
But forget Egypt.
I'll be king of the world!

525
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,958
Well, you can take
the boy out of the underworld,

526
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,625
but you can't take
the underworld out of the boy.

527
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,166
He's headed for the Africa exhibit!

528
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,541
Quick, I know a shortcut.

529
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:28,666
Out of my way, you lame ducks!

530
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,583
Later, alligator.

531
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:34,208
Too slow, cheetah. Not today, Mufasa.

532
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,541
Nothing clever to say for a moose!

533
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,375
Come on!
We've gotta stop that freaky pharaoh.

534
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:42,625
Technically, he's not a pharaoh.

535
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:46,166
He was passed over for his younger brother
because he's an unstable tyrant.

536
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:53,416
Intruder, surrender,
or face the blade of Joan of Arc.

537
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,708
Really? Let's dance.

538
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:59,625
No dancing. Only fighting with swords!

539
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,458
Silly knight. That was a metaphor.

540
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:05,750
The only metaphor I need is
to literally vanquish you in battle.

541
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,916
Metaphors are literally not literal.

542
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:13,083
Fine. How about after I slay you,

543
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,166
I dance on your grave?

544
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,416
No! There's no dancing.
I was just trying to roast you.

545
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,000
Well, in that case, you're too late.

546
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,041
I was burned at the stake 600 years ago.

547
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,875
I didn't mean literally!

548
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,166
Quick, grab the tablet!

549
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,791
Yes.

550
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,166
World domination, here I come!

551
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,833
-Huh?
-Give Laaa tablet!

552
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:53,333
-Well, since you asked so nicely. Psych!
-Hey!

553
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:02,291
Yes.
Just like I planned it from the beginning.

554
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,166
Now, if you'll excuse me--

555
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:06,750
It's you.

556
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,000
Was going extinct once not enough for you?

557
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:12,416
Eat him, Rexy. Eat him!

558
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,833
No, don't eat me!

559
00:32:14,916 --> 00:32:17,041
Or it will be a real short movie!

560
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,541
Made it out completely unsca--

561
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,458
Yeah. That's solid gold.

562
00:32:29,083 --> 00:32:30,625
He's getting away!

563
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:32,458
We need to figure out how to open this.

564
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,958
I got this.

565
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,416
I'ma blow this puppy to kingdom come.

566
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,875
Everybody, stand back!

567
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,458
Fire in the hole!

568
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:47,541
We are going to need a bigger cowboy.

569
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:48,458
Hey!

570
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,958
Wait. I have the keys.

571
00:32:53,583 --> 00:32:55,000
You're in charge, Rexy.

572
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,791
Huh? Where did he go?

573
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,166
Wait. I'm having a vision.

574
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,291
Right.
I forgot Joan has those mystical visions.

575
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,333
<i>We are chasing Kahmunrah</i>
<i>through a hallway of color.</i>

576
00:33:08,416 --> 00:33:09,291
<i>But wait!</i>

577
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:13,041
<i>He slips and bumps into George Washington.</i>

578
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,916
That's ridiculous.

579
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,458
How are we supposed to
find George Washington in New York City?

580
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:20,166
Metropolis Art Museum

581
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,083
That's how.

582
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,625
Oh, well, that makes perfect sense.

583
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,083
The Metropolis Art Museum!

584
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:26,666
But that's across town,
and we don't have all night.

585
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,458
You know the deal.
At sunrise, we turn to dust.

586
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,875
Subway
Seah Ave. Station

587
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,416
Come on. I've got an idea.

588
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,583
B Uptown

589
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,291
Are you all cosplaying for
the comic book convention in town?

590
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,625
Really? You think I'm weird?

591
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:48,625
There's a man over there dressed
as a pirate, feeding a churro to a lizard.

592
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,833
Attagirl. Aren't you a pretty ballerina?

593
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:54,416
You walked the plank right into my heart.

594
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
What a weirdo.

595
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,958
Yeah.
She'd never make it as a real ballerina.

596
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,291
METROPOLIS ART MUSEUM

597
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,708
I've made it!

598
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:10,291
Finally.

599
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,250
Awaken, my loyal subjects!

600
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:14,916
I'm alive!

601
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,458
I'm alive.

602
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:19,125
And I'm still broken?

603
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,875
And my nose itches.

604
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,333
Look what the sphinx dragged in.

605
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,541
Welcome, your highness.

606
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:32,916
About time.
I'm freezing, and this is my summer tunic.

607
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,458
Yes.

608
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:39,291
My destiny is so close I can feel it.

609
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:43,500
And my kingly instincts tell me
it's this way.

610
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:46,166
Though the map does say it's that way.

611
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,875
Well, let's just go with the map.

612
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,833
The <i>Book of the Dead</i>
warned us about this jerk coming back.

613
00:34:51,916 --> 00:34:53,500
Well, I'm gonna go grab a latte.

614
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:00,458
Well, Kahmunrah definitely
brought the tablet here.

615
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,500
This place is big.

616
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,875
Everything is big to us.

617
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,125
Yeah.

618
00:35:08,208 --> 00:35:09,458
I don't get it.

619
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:12,750
How's Kahmunrah gonna get to
ancient Egypt from an art museum?

620
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:16,000
Of course! The Temple of Dendur!

621
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,083
Dur-dur?

622
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,625
Not, "Dur-dur." Dendur.

623
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:21,375
It's an ancient Egyptian temple
on exhibit here.

624
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:23,750
Nick,
just as the tablet brings us to life,

625
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:26,500
it can bring any art exhibit to life
as well.

626
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,458
The tablet's magic will allow Kahmunrah to

627
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,875
enter the temple
and go back to ancient Egypt.

628
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:33,750
What? How is that possible?
He's gonna time travel?

629
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:36,541
Kahmunrah could use
the art in the temple as a portal,

630
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,583
just like Laaa is doing
with <i>Whistler's Mother</i>.

631
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,083
Laaa! Stop that.

632
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,833
Get out of my house, you half-naked brute!

633
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:48,541
Unpleasant! Distressing!
Alarming! Calamitous!

634
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,083
Maybe I should take back that dictionary.

635
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,083
Nick, if Kahmunrah
goes back to ancient Egypt,

636
00:35:54,166 --> 00:35:56,000
who knows what terror he could unleash.

637
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,166
As Laaa would say, "Everybody go…"

638
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,208
I can't believe this is happening.

639
00:36:02,291 --> 00:36:05,416
Why couldn't I have a normal summer job,
you know?

640
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,916
One without a maniac who rose from
the dead to cause an apocalypse.

641
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,583
Is that too much to ask?
We don't even know which way he went.

642
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:12,791
He went that way.

643
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:14,916
Wow. How do you know?

644
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,500
Because I am an expert in
tracking, surviving, outwitting,

645
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,333
and also, I can see him right over there.

646
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:21,708
Stupid map!

647
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:22,791
Let's get him!

648
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:25,208
It's going to be one of those days.

649
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,625
-Charge!
-Let's go!

650
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:29,958
He's too fast!

651
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,958
Maybe you're just too slow.

652
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:37,000
Hey, Kahmunrah.
How do you like oil paintings?

653
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
What?

654
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,333
Bully!

655
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:47,583
<i>Row, row, row our boat</i>
<i>Gently down the Delaware</i>

656
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:51,708
Duh, don't worry, General Washington,
we got him.

657
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:54,083
Let go of me, you philistines!

658
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:56,166
There he is! Crossing the Delaware.

659
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:01,708
Stand back or wig boy gets it.

660
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,166
This is what I get
for going to New Jersey.

661
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,416
Wait, I got an idea!

662
00:37:08,333 --> 00:37:10,291
We're going down, men.

663
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:17,625
Those half-wits are never going to quit.

664
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,958
I must find some way to get rid of them.

665
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,166
It's time for backup.

666
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,875
The ultimate backup.

667
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:43,583
I summon you, O God of Gods, to rise!

668
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,166
Yes!

669
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,500
Who dares awaken me?

670
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,833
It is I, the great Kahmunrah.

671
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:02,291
Mighty Seth, God of Chaos,
I need your assistance.

672
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:11,541
Nearly, I can do it just--

673
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:13,375
Wow, you're not very god-like.

674
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,708
Frankly, I'm a little underwhelmed.

675
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:16,958
A little help.

676
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:19,375
Hello, anybody out there? Help me!

677
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,333
Now, I thought-- I--

678
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,541
I'm sorry,
I thought I had it but thank you.

679
00:38:24,625 --> 00:38:26,541
So, what can I do for--

680
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,625
Excuse me.

681
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,750
I stand corrected.

682
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:36,291
I guess big things
do come in small packages.

683
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:41,291
Hey! I'll have you know that I am the
tallest in my whole family of jackal gods.

684
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,916
Fine, fine, I take it back.
You're not little at all.

685
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,083
Good. Now, you said you needed my help.
What's on your mind?

686
00:38:49,166 --> 00:38:50,208
Well, you see,

687
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:54,750
I have this ragtag collection of misfits
that I need taken care of.

688
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,791
That's them now.

689
00:38:59,333 --> 00:39:01,750
Come on out, Kahmunrah.
We know you're in there!

690
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,125
Do me a solid and charbroil them,
will you?

691
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,625
What's in it for Seth?

692
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,708
Together we will rule the world.

693
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,291
With the power of this tablet,

694
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:17,166
we can awaken the army of the dead and
force mankind to bow to our every whim!

695
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:21,041
You are kind of a doofus, you know that?

696
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:25,500
But I am down with ruling the world,
that's for sure. You know it.

697
00:39:28,416 --> 00:39:29,416
It won't budge.

698
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,625
What is that?

699
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,083
Your demise, Lesser Larry.

700
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:39,625
Meet Seth, the God of Chaos!

701
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:40,958
Hey.

702
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,625
The God of Chaos is named Seth?

703
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,541
Shouldn't you have a scarier name? Like…

704
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,916
Okay, Seth works. We're cool.

705
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,541
Destroy them!

706
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,958
Pretty green fire.

707
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,333
Are you kidding me?

708
00:39:57,416 --> 00:40:00,541
How are we supposed to escape
if you can't even hit them?

709
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,125
Hey, I am the God of Chaos.

710
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:04,541
If you wanted accuracy,

711
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:08,125
you should've woken up the
God of Always Hitting Stuff He Aims At.

712
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,041
What? He's a real god.

713
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,291
No, he is. He's a friend of mine.
I will introduce you to him one day.

714
00:40:16,666 --> 00:40:18,291
Enough of this child's play!

715
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,958
This will keep them busy
as we make our escape.

716
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,541
Great Scott.

717
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:27,333
They don't call me the scorpion whisperer
for nothing.

718
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,208
I don't think he heard you.

719
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:35,583
He just needs a little dose of chaos!

720
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,875
Run!

721
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:44,250
Great, now we're being hunted by
a giant, god-powered scorpion!

722
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,916
We must get out of sight.

723
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,708
There!

724
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,458
What are we gonna do?

725
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:58,833
Let's sneak out while the scorpion
is looking the other way.

726
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,833
Nick…

727
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,000
It's a fruit text from my mom.

728
00:41:05,083 --> 00:41:08,250
-She's reminding me to eat my apple.
-You've got to be joking.

729
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,166
Nick!

730
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,291
I respect all living things,
but for you, I'll make an exception.

731
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,333
You stop, stink bug!

732
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,125
Take this!

733
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:37,375
Ouchie.

734
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,750
You've heard of the slice-of-life?
This is the opposite!

735
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,708
Stink bug go…

736
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:55,541
That classic, Laaa.

737
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:58,833
Worst first night ever.

738
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,208
Uh-oh.

739
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,416
Hello, son.

740
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,750
Oh, it's you again, Father.

741
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:08,416
Your image seems to be
carved on everything.

742
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,166
Why do you get to be in all the museums
and not me?

743
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,041
You really wanna
have this conversation now?

744
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,708
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

745
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:19,791
Because I'm about to be
the most powerful pharaoh ever!

746
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:24,833
So this whole thing is
because you have daddy issues?

747
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,083
You should try a therapist.

748
00:42:27,166 --> 00:42:29,333
It's much cheaper than all this nonsense.

749
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,125
Yes!

750
00:42:33,208 --> 00:42:34,875
Now with this magical tablet,

751
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:40,208
we shall go back to ancient Egypt
and make all our dreams come true!

752
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,375
Hopefully, not all our dreams.

753
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:46,666
I keep having this one dream
where I'm trying to play the violin,

754
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,666
and it's made of bugs and I'm riding this,
like, weird slug-cat thing.

755
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,958
Here it is, the Temple of Dendur.

756
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,458
Walk carefully, team.
He could be anywhere.

757
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:00,333
Kahmunrah's done it.

758
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:02,750
He's traveled back to ancient Egypt!

759
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:07,250
And now we must follow him
into almost certain doom.

760
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,166
Oh, no. This is bad.

761
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,541
This is very, very bad.

762
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,250
This is very, very, very, very--

763
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,666
And now it's bad, and my face hurts.

764
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,583
Is it bad?

765
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:18,458
Or is it your chance to show Kahmunrah
what you're really made of?

766
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,958
Still going with bad.

767
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,541
Okay, we have about four hours
until sunrise before you'll turn to dust.

768
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:24,583
Timer - 03:59:58
PAUSE

769
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:25,833
I hope this works.

770
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,083
My first portal.

771
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,125
Come on. Kahmunrah couldn't have gone far.

772
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:34,625
Man, this sand is super hard to walk in.

773
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,458
It will be stuck in our shoes for days,

774
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:40,333
but that will be a luxury to
look forward to if we survive all of this.

775
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:49,625
Well, we're closer,
but we've still got a long way to go.

776
00:43:49,708 --> 00:43:51,291
Looks like we'll have to walk.

777
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:52,250
Good!

778
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,208
You know, I like walking and talking.

779
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,791
This will give us time to
get to know each other better.

780
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,541
How many times have you come back to life?

781
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:03,625
For me, a gazillion times.
The first time, I was so surprised…

782
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:07,083
I think I smell Kahmunrah's musk.
Have we picked up his tracks?

783
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:10,208
No, not yet. That wind back there
must've covered them up.

784
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,291
Are you serious?

785
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:13,250
We're in the middle of ancient Egypt!

786
00:44:13,333 --> 00:44:14,666
We're never gonna find him.

787
00:44:15,916 --> 00:44:17,208
Nicholas, what's wrong?

788
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:20,333
Looks like Nick's got a little hitch
in his giddyap.

789
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:22,375
Sorry, it's just--

790
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,250
I'm not cut out for this.

791
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,458
I'm only 18.

792
00:44:27,083 --> 00:44:29,750
I'm just a stupid kid
who's in way over his head.

793
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:31,791
Do not say that, Nick.

794
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,041
When I was 18,

795
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:35,958
I led the French army to victory
over the English.

796
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:38,958
And I was only 14
when I led the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

797
00:44:39,041 --> 00:44:44,333
And I was just 13 when I helped Rome
claim victory in the Battle of Carthage.

798
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:47,041
And Laaa discovered fire when he was 11.

799
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:55,291
Fire burn.

800
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,291
I know the feeling.

801
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:59,625
Look, I get it.

802
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:02,791
You guys are amazing.
That's why you're in a museum.

803
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:06,416
But I'm not like you, okay?
Things don't work out for me.

804
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,208
I blew it with the girl I like,
nobody wants to listen to my music,

805
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,500
and, by the way,

806
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:14,916
I unleashed an ancient god
bent on destroying the world.

807
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,833
Every time I get a chance
to do something cool,

808
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,458
I always mess it up.

809
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:21,791
Come on, Nick. That's not true.

810
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,666
You give up on yourself way too easily.

811
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:25,833
You can do this.

812
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:28,750
Your father stood up to Kahmunrah,
and so can you.

813
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:33,625
But I'm not my dad.
I'm not a hero like him or you guys.

814
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:36,875
Nick, you have your own gifts
that make you strong.

815
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:40,083
You just need to believe in yourself
like we do.

816
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:44,500
Now the question is, where is Kahmunrah?

817
00:45:46,166 --> 00:45:48,416
I picked up his trail. He went that way!

818
00:45:49,083 --> 00:45:51,083
All right, everyone. That way!

819
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,750
That way!

820
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,666
No, Laaa. It's this way.

821
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,500
But you said that way!

822
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,041
You know what's weird?

823
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,000
Every time I come back to life,
I put on, like, 15 pounds.

824
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,166
Please stop talking.

825
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,333
-Think maybe it's the stress.
-A boat. Finally.

826
00:46:09,416 --> 00:46:11,375
Quick, we'll take it down the Nile.

827
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,791
Okay, we'll take that boat.

828
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,791
Seriously, you should cover
your eyes when you sneeze.

829
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,375
They've taken the river.

830
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:31,625
Then we'll follow them by boat.

831
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,250
Laaa no like water.

832
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,541
Come on, gang, don't dawdle. All aboard!

833
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:46,541
Why are we going so slow?

834
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,416
This way, Laaa.

835
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,000
Ha! This way.

836
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:01,833
This reminds me of my days paddling
down the Little Missouri River.

837
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:05,208
One day, I came across a gaggle of
impressionable youths, and I thought,

838
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:08,625
"I bet they'd love to hear a chapter
from my exhilarating adventures."

839
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,333
And in the midst of a tale,

840
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,375
where I taught a buffalo
to play shuffleboard,

841
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:16,000
I turn and realize
those rapscallions had stolen my boat!

842
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,416
We're going slow again.

843
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,958
That's because Teddy stopped paddling

844
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:21,333
to tell a long-winded story
about being long-winded.

845
00:47:21,416 --> 00:47:23,416
Sorry! I use my hands when I talk.

846
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:27,208
Oh, boy. At this rate,
we'll never catch up to Kahmunrah.

847
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:30,791
Wait! I see something. A vision.

848
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,500
Another vision? What do you see?

849
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,166
It's about you, Nick,

850
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,916
and whether or not
you will defeat Kahmunrah.

851
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,875
Really? Do I?

852
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,041
<i>I see Kahmunrah.</i>

853
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:43,916
<i>He is using the tablet to</i>
<i>release an ultimate evil!</i>

854
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,416
<i>But Nick and Kahmunrah face off and--</i>

855
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,125
And? Do I win?

856
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,458
I don't know. The vision ended.

857
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:53,625
Now all I see is Laaa's hairy back.

858
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,625
What's wrong, Laaa?

859
00:47:55,708 --> 00:47:56,708
Dinosaur!

860
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,541
You're imagining things, buddy.

861
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:02,291
Dinosaurs have been extinct
for millions of years.

862
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Laaa!

863
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,166
He says we're in ancient Egypt,
not the Jurassic period.

864
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,500
Wait! That's no dinosaur!

865
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:21,041
That's a Nile crocodile
just like the one in the museum!

866
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:23,541
Laaa!

867
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:25,750
Laaa!

868
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,333
Fear not, Laaa. Help is on the way!

869
00:48:28,416 --> 00:48:31,625
I've never wrestled a crocodile,
but I did wrestle a bear once.

870
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:35,333
I was taking my morning constitutional
on a hiking trail in Yellowstone--

871
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,791
Teddy, will you stop it? Laaa's drowning!

872
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,166
Me forgot. Me no swim.

873
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:46,041
Dinosaur!

874
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,416
Grab the oar!

875
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,166
Is everyone okay?

876
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,166
Everyone but Laaa!

877
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,166
Hey, I think I have an idea.

878
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,250
Attila, quick. Can you get me over there?

879
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,166
On second thought, I changed my mind!

880
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,875
Laaa, grab my hand!

881
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:12,666
That's your hand!

882
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:17,916
Yikes!

883
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,416
Nick!

884
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:25,333
We did it!

885
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:28,791
Is it gone?

886
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:29,875
Oh, no!

887
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:40,458
Back off, croc.

888
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:44,375
Or become my next pair of boots.

889
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:51,708
Nick, that was incredible!
You saving Laaa and all of that.

890
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:54,875
Yeah, but our boats are destroyed,
and we lost Kahmunrah.

891
00:49:55,375 --> 00:49:57,958
There's no way we're gonna
catch up to him before sunrise.

892
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:01,458
And it's all my fault. I doomed us all.

893
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,875
-Well, this reminds me of the time--
-Teddy!

894
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:09,833
I know, I know. I ramble.

895
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,333
At long last,
we've arrived at the Temple of the Sun!

896
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:19,333
We're one step closer to ruling the world.

897
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:23,000
Great Ra, God of the Sun,

898
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:27,875
I, Kahmunrah, King of Kings,
request to enter your--

899
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:32,083
Who dares to step upon the grounds
of this sacred temple?

900
00:50:32,166 --> 00:50:34,625
It's me, birdbrain. The God of Chaos!

901
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,083
Stop it, you're embarrassing me.

902
00:50:39,166 --> 00:50:40,416
I'm not with him.

903
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,583
Never mind.

904
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,583
Sorry that I asked.
The door is that way. Just go.

905
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,625
Yes.

906
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:52,583
The door to the ultimate treasure.

907
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:56,958
Only the keenest of intellects
can decipher how to open it.

908
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,541
You're really a train wreck,
you know that?

909
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,916
Well, thank you.

910
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,250
Well, at least we're in.

911
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:07,083
Should be smooth sailing from here.

912
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,916
Looks like this place is booby-trapped.

913
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,500
Thanks for the heads-up!

914
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:16,916
Now get me out of here!

915
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,750
"Get me out of here, please,"
is how we say it like a big boy.

916
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,833
Great, now we're lost in the desert
with no idea where to go.

917
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,083
Do you think I can get GPS
in ancient Egypt?

918
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,333
Wait, Nick. Look what's on the horizon.

919
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:32,125
He went this way.

920
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,375
-That way!
-Huh?

921
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:35,875
Laaa, no. This way!

922
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,208
Ha! This way.

923
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:40,791
You really gotta watch
where you're going, Laaa.

924
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,083
You wanna be alive
for the end of the world, don't you?

925
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,333
Of course he does. We all do!

926
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,208
Except for the end of the world part.

927
00:51:47,291 --> 00:51:49,166
Strange. I'm having déjà vu.

928
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,625
When I fought for France,

929
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:54,083
it felt as if I was fighting to
prevent the world from ending.

930
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:56,333
Except back then, I was all alone.

931
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,958
This time it's different, Joan.

932
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:00,666
You're not alone.
You have friends who've got your back.

933
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,750
And I have yours, <i>mon amie</i>.

934
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,375
Timer - 01:37:25

935
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,833
Look, Nick! It's Kahmunrah's boat.

936
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:16,875
He must be here at the Temple of the Sun!

937
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:19,041
Isn't it magnificent?

938
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:22,958
Thanks. You are not too bad yourself.

939
00:52:24,208 --> 00:52:26,333
Come on, everyone. Not a second to lose.

940
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:30,916
It appears they've already
let themselves in.

941
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,416
This place is mustier than Sunday britches
on a Friday polecat.

942
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,166
Is that a real thing
or do you just make that stuff up?

943
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,291
I make 'em up.

944
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:45,416
I'm not really sure what a polecat is,
but it sounds cowboy-ish, am I right?

945
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:49,166
Hey! Kahmunrah was here
not too long ago. We're gaining on them.

946
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,875
We've got to catch them before sunrise,
and we turn to dust! Come on!

947
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:57,083
Wait, look. I've seen
these hieroglyphs before on the tablet!

948
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,916
And these! I'm pretty sure
they're ancient musical notes.

949
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,583
I knew the tablet
brought everything to life,

950
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,208
but I didn't know it played music.

951
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:06,083
I guess your dad was right.
You are a musical genius.

952
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:09,875
He said that? I mean, yeah. No, of course.
Dads are supposed to say stuff like that.

953
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:11,083
Doesn't mean anything.

954
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:13,250
Anyway, what does this mean?

955
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:16,625
It appears the tablet is a key
to opening the sarcophagus.

956
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,458
With three sacred chords,

957
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,833
Kahmunrah can summon his soldiers
from the underworld!

958
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,875
We must stop him before he reaches
the top chamber of the temple!

959
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:27,958
We have one hour left.
There's still time to fix this! Let's go!

960
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,291
These tracks are fresh.
They must be close.

961
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:37,500
And watch where you step, everyone.
There could be booby traps.

962
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:39,791
Booby.

963
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,000
Dook!

964
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:43,708
-Huh?
-He said duck!

965
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,208
Pretty sure he said "dook."

966
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,666
From now on, everyone stay close.

967
00:53:52,916 --> 00:53:53,916
Too close.

968
00:53:56,958 --> 00:53:59,291
Okay, monkey. We watch for trap.

969
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:03,416
Huh? Fire help see trap.

970
00:54:04,958 --> 00:54:06,041
Good idea, monkey.

971
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,958
Monkey ghost!

972
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,166
I really like what they did
with the columns here.

973
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:29,500
Very third dynasty.

974
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:33,291
Seriously, must we stop at every room?

975
00:54:33,375 --> 00:54:37,958
You know, I may be the God of Chaos,
but I'm such a sucker for interior design.

976
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,083
Kahmunrah!

977
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:43,625
You again?

978
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:44,708
Blast them!

979
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:49,541
Give us the tablet, Kahmunrah!
You're outnumbered.

980
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:53,166
You're right.
I'll just have to even the odds then.

981
00:54:53,916 --> 00:55:00,416
Statue Warriors of Death,
consider yourselves my new bodyguards!

982
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:04,875
You never had a chance, son of Larry.

983
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:09,541
Man. What are we supposed to do now?

984
00:55:09,625 --> 00:55:12,375
Come on, Octavius.
Nick needs a major pick-me-up,

985
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:16,250
and us two buckaroos
need to flimflam those shim-shams.

986
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,250
I understood about 40% of that,

987
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:21,708
but I believe what you are saying
is that it is time for us to save the day.

988
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:26,541
I hate being small!

989
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:29,416
Yes, it's a huge inconvenience!

990
00:55:35,583 --> 00:55:38,833
Enough speaking softly, Nick.
Bring out the big stick!

991
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:41,875
Haka!

992
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,333
It's the eyes! Go for the eyes!

993
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,583
Nick, a little help?

994
00:56:15,666 --> 00:56:18,166
Okay, Nick, you got this.
Just take the shot.

995
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,250
What's the worst that can happen?
No, you know what?

996
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:22,958
What's the best that could happen?

997
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,041
Hey, Hawkeye, looking for this?

998
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:32,166
I never thought that we'd go out
as a bite-sized snack

999
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,916
for two Egyptian house pets.

1000
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:36,708
If we're gonna be tater tots,

1001
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,375
hopefully, your fancy armor
will give 'em a tummy ache.

1002
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:42,708
Jedediah, you sweet, simple genius!

1003
00:56:43,416 --> 00:56:45,541
Choke on this, foul serpent!

1004
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,958
And don't forget to swallow!

1005
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:52,791
Yeah!

1006
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:57,666
That's nasty!

1007
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,208
And don't come back!

1008
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:03,250
Uh-oh.

1009
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:10,000
Your tongue is like a cactus.

1010
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,333
And you could really use a mint.

1011
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:21,083
Yes!

1012
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:22,458
Hey, Count Hawkula!

1013
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,208
Dook!

1014
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,541
Did I say dook? I meant duck.

1015
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:34,916
Bravo, Nicholas!

1016
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,541
Now, let's go get the bad guy.

1017
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,833
Well, this is it.

1018
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,750
The moment of my revenge
against a world that doubted me!

1019
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,750
Especially you, Daddy!

1020
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:52,625
You embarrass me.

1021
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:55,083
Why do I always get teamed up
with bad guys

1022
00:57:55,166 --> 00:57:57,833
with unresolved childhood trauma?

1023
00:57:57,916 --> 00:58:01,000
You should want to be evil for you,
not for him.

1024
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:03,750
It doesn't matter! My time has come.

1025
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,666
It's the beginning of the end!

1026
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,500
Well, which is it?
Is it the beginning or is it the end?

1027
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,041
What? It's both.

1028
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:14,458
Obviously, the end has a beginning.
It has to start somewhere.

1029
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:17,000
Can you remind me
never to time travel with you again?

1030
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,083
It's exhausting.

1031
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:22,166
Kahmunrah, stop! Don't do it!
This could mean the end of everything!

1032
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,500
Not according to him.
He says it's just the beginning.

1033
00:58:25,583 --> 00:58:26,666
Everyone, shut up!

1034
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:30,416
Once I insert the tablet
into the sarcophagus,

1035
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,833
with three simple chords,
my army will rise!

1036
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,291
I mean our army.

1037
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:39,166
That hurts like you wouldn't believe!

1038
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,083
Well, maybe next time
you should be more considerate.

1039
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:47,208
Come on,
we can't let that bully play those chords.

1040
00:58:47,291 --> 00:58:48,666
Bully!

1041
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,083
I mean, yes, I agree.

1042
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:54,666
Don't let them near the tablet.
Bonus points if you kill them.

1043
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:57,500
This is gonna get messy, which I like.

1044
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:03,291
Okay. First chord.

1045
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:09,583
One chord down.

1046
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:12,416
And now for the second chord.

1047
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,875
Nick!

1048
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:24,750
And now for the moment
I've been waiting for.

1049
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:28,875
The final chord!

1050
00:59:28,958 --> 00:59:30,666
No! We're too late.

1051
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,333
Only a miracle can save us now!

1052
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:51,458
A monkey and a caveman
shot out of that bird's mouth,

1053
00:59:51,541 --> 00:59:53,166
and then he slapped you!

1054
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:54,291
What a twist.

1055
00:59:57,625 --> 01:00:00,875
All right, now for the final chord.

1056
01:00:00,958 --> 01:00:03,041
Only miracle save us now.

1057
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,250
Giddyap, tiger!

1058
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:09,750
A cowboy and a Roman
riding a hairless cat.

1059
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:10,666
What are the odds of--

1060
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:14,458
Now for the final chord.

1061
01:00:29,458 --> 01:00:30,750
Sic 'em.

1062
01:00:38,291 --> 01:00:39,291
Remember, team,

1063
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:42,041
it's not the size of the dog in the fight,
but the fight in the dog,

1064
01:00:42,125 --> 01:00:44,583
and don't even notice
those dogs are humongous.

1065
01:00:44,666 --> 01:00:47,041
I meant us dogs. We got a lot of fight.
Never mind. Let's go!

1066
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:50,875
Bully!

1067
01:01:16,791 --> 01:01:19,000
Charge!

1068
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,958
Nice job, everyone,
we've got 'em on the ropes!

1069
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,916
Spoke too soon!

1070
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,250
Yes, attack, my minions. Attack!

1071
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:42,416
There's too many of them,
and they just keep coming!

1072
01:01:56,666 --> 01:01:57,666
Teddy!

1073
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:02,541
This is why you never mess
with a Rough Rider! Joan, catch!

1074
01:02:03,083 --> 01:02:07,041
I'm having a vision of me
smacking you with this flashlight!

1075
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,125
Laaa!

1076
01:02:11,416 --> 01:02:12,750
My eyes!

1077
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:17,458
Attila!

1078
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,291
Sacagawea!

1079
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:24,583
Nick, you're up!

1080
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,833
Wow, I can't believe that actually worked.

1081
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,291
Come on, you lazy god.

1082
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,791
Destroy it all!

1083
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,875
Okay, you asked for it.

1084
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,666
Wow. Glad I'm not on your bad side.

1085
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:56,875
And let's keep it that way!
No more calling me lazy! It's very mean.

1086
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:06,250
All right, Nick, think.

1087
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:10,083
If music brought them out,
maybe music can put them back.

1088
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,250
Cover me! I'm going for the tablet!

1089
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:15,000
Nick, no! It's too dangerous!

1090
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:16,791
I got us into this mess,

1091
01:03:16,875 --> 01:03:21,541
and I'm gonna get us out.

1092
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:23,125
Nick!

1093
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,875
Seriously? That was easy.

1094
01:03:25,958 --> 01:03:27,875
I'm not dead yet, Kahmunrah.

1095
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,375
Thanks to these inauthentic
Shoshone gift shop beads.

1096
01:03:31,458 --> 01:03:33,000
He's okay!

1097
01:03:48,375 --> 01:03:52,083
Hey, Seth! Laser eyes are pointless
if you can't hit a target.

1098
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:55,375
How dare you? Watch and admire.

1099
01:03:55,458 --> 01:04:00,708
Concentrate. Control your breathing.
Visualize your target and shoot!

1100
01:04:06,666 --> 01:04:11,083
I used my god powers to defeat myself?
Who could have seen that coming?

1101
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:14,583
Fine. Leave son of Larry…

1102
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:18,541
to me!

1103
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:20,166
Oh, boy.

1104
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:38,625
Okay,
the chords that released the army were,

1105
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,750
a D minor augmented seventh,
and an A half-diminished seventh,

1106
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:42,916
and a C minor ninth.

1107
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,666
Maybe if I play them in reverse,

1108
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,375
the army will go back
to where it came from.

1109
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:52,625
What are you doing? Get away from there!

1110
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:54,916
Just two more.

1111
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:00,375
That's quite enough!

1112
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:08,083
This is it, son of Larry.
The beginning of your end!

1113
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,083
Nick!

1114
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,375
Stay strong, everyone.
We must avenge Nicholas!

1115
01:05:26,083 --> 01:05:27,875
-Wait a minute.
-Huh?

1116
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:31,916
I'm all right.
Thanks to Teddy's good luck charm.

1117
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,416
All according to plan!

1118
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:36,208
Well, yeah, more or less.

1119
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:39,291
I don't care how many times
you cheat death.

1120
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,791
Without these instructions,

1121
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:43,750
you'll never harness
the power of the tablet.

1122
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:47,666
Wait, maybe that's not the tablet I need.

1123
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:50,041
This is no time to check for fruit texts!

1124
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,416
What on earth are you doing?

1125
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:55,875
Ending this.

1126
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:00,416
No!

1127
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,083
Nick, look out!

1128
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:17,708
If I'm going back, you're coming with me!

1129
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,666
Hey, I'm okay. Did we win?

1130
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:23,666
I am flying!

1131
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:33,708
This is the end of the end!

1132
01:06:36,666 --> 01:06:37,791
Oh, no!

1133
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,166
We got you, Nick.

1134
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:46,083
You'll regret this, son of Larry!

1135
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,750
The name's Nick. Nick Daley.
And I'm the new night guard.

1136
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:58,166
No!

1137
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,083
Looks like he's ancient history.

1138
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,500
I hate you so much sometimes.

1139
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,250
Run!

1140
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:18,333
Ouch.

1141
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:25,958
We did it, guys. We won.

1142
01:07:27,416 --> 01:07:28,750
And we got the tablet.

1143
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,750
Uh-oh. It's sunrise.

1144
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:35,666
We're not gonna make it back in time.

1145
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:38,583
I'm afraid she's right. It's much too far.

1146
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,458
Then, I guess this is <i>au revoir</i>.

1147
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:44,750
Although, technically,
that means "until I see you again,"

1148
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:47,541
which is clearly not going to happen.

1149
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:51,000
But at least I can say
I have friends like you.

1150
01:07:55,291 --> 01:07:58,166
Come on, guys,
there's gotta be something we can do.

1151
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:00,125
Don't worry about us, son.

1152
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,541
The important thing
is that you saved the world.

1153
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:03,916
I'm so sorry.

1154
01:08:05,041 --> 01:08:06,791
I messed everything up.

1155
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,791
I wish there was some way

1156
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:11,916
this stupid tablet could magically
get us back to the museum.

1157
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Wait a minute.

1158
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,458
Maybe there is.

1159
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:19,208
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

1160
01:08:19,291 --> 01:08:20,791
We're all going home together.

1161
01:08:20,875 --> 01:08:24,291
Genius, my boy. A portal to the museum!

1162
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:32,250
Boy, am I glad I gave you that poster.

1163
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:33,958
Now, let's go home.

1164
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,541
All right, tablet. Do your thing.

1165
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:42,875
-Come on now!
-Huzzah!

1166
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,416
Laaa.

1167
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:02,958
Rexy, we're home!

1168
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:06,208
Heel, Rexy, heel!

1169
01:09:08,291 --> 01:09:09,625
I missed you too, big guy.

1170
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:11,750
We made it just in time.

1171
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,958
He said, "Thank you for saving us, Nick."

1172
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:23,416
"After putting us in terrible danger
in the first place."

1173
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,375
Nick.

1174
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,750
Bye-bye, son of dada.

1175
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:33,500
Laaa.

1176
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:41,208
Nick, I had a vision again!

1177
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:46,625
You will defeat Kahmunrah.
Or perhaps it was more of a memory.

1178
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:49,125
In any event, it's been an honor.

1179
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,958
Heigh-ho, Jiji, away!

1180
01:09:57,541 --> 01:09:59,666
You did real good, partner.

1181
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:03,541
Nicholas, you would've made
a great commander in my day.

1182
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:04,625
Giddyap, tiger!

1183
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,125
-Hey, Dad.
-<i>Hey, Nicky.</i>

1184
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:13,166
<i>How'd your first night on the job go?</i>

1185
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:17,750
You know, it was nothing special.
Kind of dull, really.

1186
01:10:17,833 --> 01:10:19,166
<i>Dull, was it?</i>

1187
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:21,916
<i>Okay, to be honest,</i>
<i>things got a little crazy, and-and I--</i>

1188
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,166
<i>Lawrence, you couldn't have found</i>
<i>a better man to replace you.</i>

1189
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:27,208
<i>He's a chip off the old block.</i>

1190
01:10:27,833 --> 01:10:29,916
Growing up among my people, the Shoshone,

1191
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,250
we learn at a young age
that we all have a brave spirit.

1192
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,125
You just had to find yours.

1193
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,458
Take care, Nick.

1194
01:10:37,583 --> 01:10:38,583
You too.

1195
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:41,583
Thank you for everything.

1196
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:50,916
<i>I'm proud of you, Nick.</i>

1197
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,416
<i>I don't know what happened tonight,</i>
<i>and frankly, I'm kind of afraid to ask,</i>

1198
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,833
<i>but it sounds like you did all right.</i>

1199
01:10:55,916 --> 01:10:56,958
Thanks, Dad.

1200
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,875
I mean, the truth is,
I hit a few snags here and there,

1201
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:02,375
but it's not like
it was the "end of the world."

1202
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,333
Okay, maybe it was almost
the end of the world, but, like--

1203
01:11:06,666 --> 01:11:08,541
I gotta go! Dr. McPhee's here.

1204
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:10,583
-<i>Nick--</i>
-Later!

1205
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,708
On the phone, are we?

1206
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:16,750
I hope the job's not interfering
with your personal life.

1207
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:20,583
Hi, Dr. McPhee! What's-- What's good?
I was just--

1208
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:21,666
Not interested.

1209
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,208
Anyway, everything looks good.

1210
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:26,458
No sign of mischief
or other teenage shenanigans.

1211
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:28,208
You can go home now.

1212
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:31,041
Wait a minute.

1213
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:32,375
What is that?

1214
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,166
Look. It's a cute little kitty statue!

1215
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,083
Yeah! Yeah, I found it
when I was locking the loading dock

1216
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:41,416
like I was supposed to.

1217
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,625
Good find, Nick.

1218
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:46,083
I'll put it right here on your desk,
so you can look at it every night.

1219
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:48,958
Gee, thanks.

1220
01:11:49,041 --> 01:11:50,625
Now, if you'll excuse me,

1221
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:53,708
I'm going to order some outfits
for my new little kitty.

1222
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,625
See you tonight, Rexy.

1223
01:12:00,625 --> 01:12:03,041
But first there's something I gotta do.

1224
01:12:10,208 --> 01:12:13,708
Nick, you're back. What can I do for you?

1225
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:15,250
Look, Ms. Montefusco,

1226
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:17,375
I know you weren't a fan
of my first audition,

1227
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,375
but I'm not giving up that easy.

1228
01:12:19,458 --> 01:12:22,375
Huh? What's happening?

1229
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,250
I'm just asking for a second chance.

1230
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,875
So, before you kick me out,
just listen to this.

1231
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,583
Hit it, guys.

1232
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:01,750
Yeah!

1233
01:13:02,416 --> 01:13:03,708
Indeed!

1234
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:17,625
Joan!

1235
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:23,041
Come on, everyone. Let's conga!

1236
01:13:23,708 --> 01:13:24,708
This way!

1237
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,833
That way!

1238
01:13:25,916 --> 01:13:28,375
-Laaa, this way!
-This way!

1239
01:13:28,958 --> 01:13:29,958
Dexter!
