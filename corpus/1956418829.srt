jason used to mow the lawn
at our old house.

179
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,369
- I don't need help
finding a job, mom.

180
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,837
- No, but that's terrific.

181
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,839
I'm always looking for boys
with experience.

182
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,641
- I... I don't know.

183
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:33,178
Sure. Maybe.

184
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,880
- I think it's a great idea,
honey.

185
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,115
And you can finally start
saving up for that car.

186
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:38,917
- A car.

187
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:41,853
Well, listen, no pressure.
I mean, the pay's not bad

188
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,556
and the job has its perks.

189
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,658
Well, listen, I'll let you guys
get back to your unpacking.

another time.

192
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,629

193
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,134

194
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,072
- Nicole, you're going
to love purity falls.

195
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,908
It's very family friendly.
And I know everyone.

I'll introduce you.

Honey, what's wrong?
- [Sobs]

198

I didn't...

199
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,852
I didn't want
to upset the kids, but...

200
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,656
I lost my husband
last year.

201
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,058
- Oh, poor thing.

202
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,495

- Yes.

your husband, I just...

you should know.

209

- It tears you up,
doesn't it?

210
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:43,081

overwhelmed.

so close to campus we can walk.

I'm suddenly feeling
a lot more confident.

I know someone

if you lose.

00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,449
- Really?
- Yeah.

356
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,217
- Yeah, sure.

357
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,153
We'll meet you guys there.

358
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,587
- Okay. Cool.

359
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,922
- Okay.

360
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,431
- I know what you've been
doing.

361
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,566
- Take it easy.
- Stay away from her.

362
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,175
Don't even think
about coming back.

363
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,776
Because I'll kill you.

364
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,617
What are you looking at?

365
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,996
- You okay?

366
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,531
- Yeah.

367
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,933
- Who was that guy?

368
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,401
- I don't know.

369
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,970
Probably just
some crazy old drunk.

370
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,606
- You don't know him?

371
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,143
- Never seen him before
in my life.

372
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,890
- Well, hello there.

373
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,560
It's jason, isn't it?

374
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,696
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

375
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,065
- Hmm. What can I do
for you, jason?

376
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,501
- I remember you saying

377
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,402
that you had
a landscaping service,

378
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:01,339
and that you might
be interested in hiring me

379
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,040
to work for you.

380
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,244
My friend daniel says
that he works for you.

381
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,779
- Yes, daniel's one
of my best employees.

382
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,348
Come on in.

383
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,289
Do you mind
taking off your sandals?

384
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,125
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

385
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:29,500
So can I get you
something to drink?

386
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,736
- No.

387
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,070
I'm fine.

388
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,438
- Please sit.

389
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,915
So, do you have
any landscaping experience?

390
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,783
- Well...

391
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:48,219
I helped my dad take care
of our lawn.

392
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,755
I mean, I know
what needs to be done.

393
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,190
- Hmm. I bet you do.

394
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,826
Are you sure that I can't
get you some wine?

395
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,662
I won't tell your mom.

396
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,798
- Sure. Why not?

397
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,133
- [Sighs]

[giggles]

399
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,789
so--so--so jack's turning
the tiller the wrong way around.

400
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,290
And the instructor yells out,

401
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,459
"hey, you might want
to watch out for that buoy."

402
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,195
You know, and as soon
as he says that, bam.

403
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,931
- [Laughs]
- he just runs right into it.

404
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,534
And you know that those things
are made out of metal, right?

405
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,868
- Yeah.
Did it mess up the boat?

406
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,804
- Yes. Completely.

407
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,439
I mean, there was
a whole scratch

408
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,107
straight down
the middle of it.

409
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,476
So the instructor then says,

410
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:48,312
"I think we'll just pretend
that's the way we found it."

411
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,047
- [Laughs]

412
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,317
- and jack, I mean,
he just never lived that down.

413
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,453
- That sounds so fun.

414
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,855
I mean, I would love
to learn how to sail.

415
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,725
- Yeah, you need a lot
of upper body strength for it.

416
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,394
But I could tell that
you'd be really good at it.

417
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,730
- Thanks.

418
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,298
- Do you want
some more wine?

419
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,633
- Yeah, sure.

420
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,669
- Oh! Oh, that's going
to stain.

421
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,938
I am so sorry.

422
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,674
Well, can you
help--help me...?

423
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,542
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:26,150
- Thanks.

425
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,653
You're my hero.

426
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,455
- No problem.

427
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,258
- Do you know that
ever since I saw you,

428
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,694
I couldn't take
my eyes off you?

429
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,229
- Really?

430
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,697
I...

431
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,998
I felt the same way.

432
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,401
You're beautiful.

433
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:46,470
- So, you like
older women, then?

[Both sigh]

435
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,760

00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,029
I wasn't expecting that.

437
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,565
- Yeah. I believe in...

438
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,436
Taking advantage of
an opportunity when it arises.

here at purity falls?

441
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,482
- Well...

442
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,284
I'm certainly liking it
a lot better now.

443
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,286
- Yeah? You didn't
like it before?

444
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,288
- It's all right,
I guess.

445
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,926
It still feels
kind of weird

446
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:44,729
not having my dad around.

447
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,764

don't you?

448
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,133
You still got your mom.

449
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,901
Your sister.

00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,637

the job, right?

- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

expecting you on Saturday.

I can't take this.

- Of course you can.
I know where you live.

a quick shower

462

before I get out of here?

463
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,033

a kiss first.

But if you'll excuse me,

535
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,249
I do need to find
somebody else for karen.

536
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,218
I like to keep
my clients happy.

537
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,021
- No hard feelings then?

538
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,656
- Of course not, sweetie.

539
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,393
Goodbye, jason.

540
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,695
- Goodbye.

541
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:04,815
- Yo, hold up.

542
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,750
Hey.
- Hey, man.

543
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:08,152
- Dude, what happened?

544
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,920
- Nothing.

545
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:11,488
- That guy come back?

546
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,857
- No, just forget about it.
I got to get to class.

547
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,597
- Why didn't you tell me
about courtney?

548
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,266
- Tell you what?

549
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,334
- You know.

550
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,003
- You went to see her.

551
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,839
- Yeah, and she sent me
to some woman's house.

552
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,942
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

553
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,777
She tried to come on to me
and I bolted.

554
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,646
- You...

555
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,948
Dude, you shouldn't
have done that.

556
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:40,584
- I'm pretty sure having sex
for money is illegal.

557
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,052
What was I supposed to do?

558
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,487
- [Scoffs]

559
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,656
- what, you actually
enjoy doing it?

560
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,524
- Sometimes.

561
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,326
I mean, yeah.

562
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:51,962
It's great if you don't
overthink it.

563
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:53,831
[Scoffs]

564
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:56,867
I get to hook up
with beautiful women

565
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,669
and make some money.

566
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,205
I mean, how many guys
in here would kill

567
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,873
to trade places with me?

568
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,008
You just...

569
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,177
You just got to be careful.

570
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,646
But if it's not for you, man,
it's not for you.

571
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:11,448
It's better to figure
that out now.

572
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:12,750
Later.

573
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,860
[Knock on door]
- yes?

574
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,262
- Hi, I'm amber weston.

575
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,897
You wanted to see me.

576
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,900
- Hi, amber.
I'm nicole johnson.

577
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,202
- Nice to meet you.

578
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,938
- Please, come in
and have a seat.

579
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,274
I've been talking to students
this week

580
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,144
that were friends
with chad griffith.

581
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,813
He was your boyfriend,
wasn't he?

582
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,817
- Yes, he was.

583
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,089
- I'm so sorry, sweetie.

584
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,592
- Chad's parents
won't tell me anything.

585
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,494
- What do you mean?

586
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,263
- About what the police
were saying.

587
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,765
If there are any suspects
or anything.

588
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:03,467
- Suspects?

589
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,736
I thought he slipped
and hit his head.

590
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:08,338
- Well, that's what people
are saying, but...

591
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:13,977
The police asked me
if I knew anyone that...

592
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,280
[sighs]

593
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,315
...That wanted to hurt chad.

594
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,551
- Hurt chad?

595
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:21,919
- I knew something
was going to happen.

596
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,487
[Sighs]

597
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,656
- what do you mean?

598
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:27,758
- It doesn't matter now.

599
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,961
- Was he doing
something illegal?

600
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,131
You can tell me.

601
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,206
- He told me he was
going to stop

602
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,508
once he made enough money.

603
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,310
He said he was going to stop.

604
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,079
- Amber, you need to tell me
what chad was doing.

605
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,550
- He was...

606
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,720
He was sleeping
with older women...

607
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,791
For money.

608
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,227
- Have you talked to the police
about this?

609
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:04,962
- Yeah, but...

610
00:31:04,997 --> 00:31:07,598
I don't want to get any
of his friends in trouble.

611
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,300
- Other boys
were doing this too?

612
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:13,804
- We were going to go
get out of town.

613
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,706
Start over somewhere new.

614
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:21,879
I was...

615
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,248
[sighs]

616
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:29,353
I got to get back
to class now, so...

617
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,090
- Amber.

618
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,525
I'll talk to the police
and see what I can find out.

619
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,295
- Thank you.

620
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,636
[Door closes]

621
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:53,911
- hey, mom?

622
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:56,580
- Hello, jason.

623
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,315
- Courtney.

624
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,683
What are you doing here?

625
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,218
- Hey.

626
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,920
Courtney invited me over
for drinks tonight.

627
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,755
Justine is spending the night
at heather's.

628
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,491
So if you want to order a pizza
or something, go ahead.

629
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,560
- Actually, I was thinking
about going to daniel's.

630
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:11,828
Can I borrow the car?

631
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,163
- Sure, honey.

632
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:18,835
- You know, my husband's old
car is still in the garage.

633
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,672
I thought I'd keep it just in
case I needed a spare one day,

634
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:24,408
but why don't I
give it to jason.

635
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,410
- Really?

636
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,111
- Courtney, that's too much.

637
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:30,113
- Oh, well, look,
it's no big deal, really.

638
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,682
It's just taking up space.

639
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,717
I mean, you'd be doing me
a favor.

640
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:35,052
It does need
a tune-up, though,

641
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,587
and the tires need
to be changed soon.

642
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,756
- Well, now that jason
has his new job,

643
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,525
he can take care of all
those grown-up problems.

644
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,428
Jay, what do you think?

645
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,230
- Sure.

646
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:48,632
That's great.

647
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,767
Thank you, miss mcqueen.

648
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,202
- Don't mention it.

649
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,838
You can pick up the keys
tomorrow.

650
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,941
- Good night.
- You too.

651
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,980
Are you expecting
something in return?

652
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:06,383
- No strings attached.

653
00:33:14,727 --> 00:33:17,260
- [Nicole sighs]

654
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,762
I needed this so much.

655
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,330
- I hear you.

656
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,199
How's the new job going?

657
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:25,902
- I'm relieved to say
that I'm loving it.

658
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,671
- Well, that's great, right?

659
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,272
You didn't think you would?

660
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:32,042
- I haven't worked full-time
since jason was born.

661
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,477
- Hmm.

662
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,278
- After we lost kyle,

663
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,180
things got tight.

664
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:40,250
I had some insurance money
in savings,

665
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,753
but that's for the kids'
college.

666
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,722
I was really worried
about going back to work.

667
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:50,494
But now, I feel more confident
in having a career again.

668
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,396
- That's because
you're a survivor.

669
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,131
Like me.

670
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:57,067
And I think that
deserves a toast.

671
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,003
To sisters,
doing it for themselves.

672
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,271
- Cheers.

673
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:03,006
Mm.

674
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,508
Speaking of,

675
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,376
I hear you're getting
an award.

676
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:07,644
- Oh, that's nothing.

677
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,346
- The entrepreneurial
spirit award?

678
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,048
Sounds like something to me.

679
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:12,816
- [Laughs]
well, mayor wiley

00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,085
is presenting the award
to me this weekend,

681
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,720
and I'm having a party here.

682
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,156
You have to promise
that you're going to come.

683
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:20,424
- I wouldn't miss it.

684
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,359
You're a real
community role model.

685
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,994
- Oh, stop.
- No, really.

686
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,862
You're a successful
businesswoman

687
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,497
giving back
to the community.

688
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,467
And you have amazing taste
in jewelry.

689
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,335
- Well, one has to have
their priorities.

690
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,371
- Cheers to that.

691
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:40,510
[Knocks]

692
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:43,814
- hi.
- Hi.

693
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,416
- Come on in. I've got
the car keys in the kitchen.

694
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,256
- Look, courtney,
I really appreciate this,

695
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,292
but you know I can't
afford it right now.

696
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:57,227
- Well, I'm sure your mom
can help out

697
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:59,429
with the insurance
and the repairs.

698
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,631
- Look, don't tell her
I said anything,

699
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,968
but we've... We've really had
to watch our spending lately.

700
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:07,537
- Oh, well,
that's not my business.

701
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:10,474
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have suggested it.

702
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:11,975
- Just, things have...

703
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,710
Things have been tough
since dad died,

704
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,513
and mom's doing her best,

705
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:18,181
but she's...

706
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:19,449
I mean, she's not you.

707
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,919
- Jason, I owe you an apology.

708
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,155
I should have told you
more about this job.

709
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,790
You were not prepared,

710
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,692
and that was really
unfair of me.

711
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:31,695
You know, I used to be
like your mom.

712
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,330
What my mistake was

713
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,198
is that I relied on my husband
for everything.

714
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,769
- It couldn't have been easy
when he passed away.

715
00:35:39,872 --> 00:35:41,805
- It's been a struggle.

716
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,573
I mean, I loved jack to bits,

717
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:46,810
but he was a dreamer and,
you know,

718
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,678
he had grand ideas,

719
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:51,081
but they weren't necessarily
that practical.

720
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:56,019
Before he died,
he ran up a lot of debt

721
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,454
that I didn't know about,

722
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,656
and so by the time
we paid for his funeral,

723
00:35:59,758 --> 00:36:02,225
there was no more money
left in our savings.

724
00:36:02,261 --> 00:36:04,995
And the bank were ready
to take away our house.

725
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:06,596
- That's...

726
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,165
I'm sorry, that's terrible.

727
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:11,001
- I'm not proud of it.

728
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,036
If I didn't have
this extra income,

729
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:16,206
I'd probably be out
in the street.

well, look,

731
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:24,014
seeing as I have a car
to take care of now...

732
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,585
Maybe you and I
can help each other.

733
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,420
- Not if you're not
comfortable.

734
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,656
I don't want my boys doing
anything they feel bad about.

735
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:34,891
- But daniel says
he really likes it, and--

736
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,427
- daniel's very popular
with my clients.

737
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,464
- I just--I know the money
would take some stress off mom,

738
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,135
and I... I want to help
support my family.

739
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,103

740
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,905

I'm very discreet,

or justine knowing about this.

a landscaping job.

what she needs.

used car.

00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,624
I'm sorry for...

893
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,026
Being out late.

894
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:51,560
I'm sorry for not calling.

895
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,129
- Honey--
- I'm sorry for everything.

896
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,543
[Door closes]

897
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,178
- I didn't get paid
for last night.

898
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:10,980
- I just spoke to karen.
She told me what happened.

899
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:12,081
Are you okay?

900
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,716
- Yeah, her husband is crazy.

901
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,885
I saw a gun in his
dresser drawer.

902
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,320
How long has she been
doing this?

903
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:19,622
- Karen is a very
lucrative client, okay?

904
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,223
That marriage has been over
for years.

905
00:49:21,326 --> 00:49:22,558
Her husband's leaving
on Tuesday.

906
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,293
She wants you
to come back then.

907
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,962
Just get the money
up front this time.

908
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,563
- No. Thank you.

909
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,333
- Excuse me?
- I said no.

910
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,735
Look, I'm taking a break.

911
00:49:32,837 --> 00:49:34,837
I don't need this kind of
stress in my life right now.

912
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:36,605
- Jason, we have
an arrangement.

913
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,374
- No, we don't have
an arrangement.

914
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:40,609
I said I would help you out,
and I have been.

915
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,812
But I'm taking a step back.
- I don't think you realize

916
00:49:42,847 --> 00:49:44,280
how good you've got it
with me.

917
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,215
Most people would be
taking advantage of you.

918
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,717
- Feels like right now
the only person

919
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,151
trying to take advantage of me
is you.

920
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:50,653
- [Scoffs]

921
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:52,521
I can't believe
you just said that.

922
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:55,491
- Look, I'm sorry--
- take your next client,

923
00:49:55,526 --> 00:49:57,426
and we can forget
about this conversation.

924
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,296
- That is all you care about,
is your clients.

925
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,299
I'm done.
- Jason!

926
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,802
Jason!

927

[Door closes]

928
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:24,220
- hey. You okay?

929
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,921
- You should have warned me
about karen's husband.

930
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:29,325
- Yeah. That guy's a jerk.

931
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,826
- Yeah, a jerk with a gun.

932
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:34,530
I'm through, man.
I told courtney that I'm done.

933
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,232
- How'd she take that?

934
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:39,168
- That's not my problem.

935
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,270
- Look, maybe a short break
is okay.

936
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,206
You can't let this take up
your whole life.

937
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,575
I mean, just recharge
your batteries.

938
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,843
Get back into it
when you're ready.

939
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,245
- No, man.

940
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,881
I'm--I'm done for good.

941
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,252
- Just...

942
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:58,020
Just be careful,
all right, man?

943
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,523
- All right.

944
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,257
Hello?

945
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:41,764
Daniel?

946
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,634
Hey, man, you shut
the lights off?

947
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:03,519
- Old wires.

948
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:06,822
This part of the building's
old.

The power used to go out
all the time when I went here.

00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:12,695
- I'm benjamin.

952
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,264
A friend of courtney's.

953
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:18,267
- I don't know any courtney.

954
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,568
- [Chuckles]

955
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,903
yeah, I'm sure some people

956
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,771
go for the dumb,
pretty boy routine,

957
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:24,039
but I don't.

958
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:27,977
Your next client,

959
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,812
she wants you
to go tonight.

960
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,418
- I told her that I'm out.

961
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:38,120
- Yeah.

962
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,055
The thing is...

963
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,892
That's not really
up to you.

964
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:50,699
I bet the ladies
just love you.

965
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,768
Bet you bring in
all kinds of cash.

966
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,503
Maybe you're tired of giving it
all to courtney.

967
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:56,639
Maybe you want to keep more
for yourself, is that it?

968
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,707
- No.
- Maybe I don't believe you.

969
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:02,011
- Fine.

970
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:04,813
I'll do it.

00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:08,317
- What will you do?

972
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:12,221
- I'll keep working
for courtney.

973
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,358
- Maybe you're smarter
than you look.

974

Don't think about
backing out again.

your little sister a visit.

- Of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

- Congratulations.

- You didn't have
to get me anything.

- I wanted to.
You deserve it.

- Stop.
- I mean, really,

986
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:54,363
how many women
have won that award?

987

- Well, not enough
as far as I'm concerned.

988

- Nicole, have you met
mayor wiley?

- I haven't.

Please call me sam.

here in purity falls.

to make me blush.

you were thriving.

have another.

- Hi, miss johnson.

- Thank you.

You must have every boy in the
neighborhood working for you.

- It was a pleasure
meeting you.

- Can I let you in
on a little secret?

- Sure.

- Well...

- Yeah.

Well, they bring me
a lot of happiness too.

as my own children,

any of my own.

to see him.

with you for a minute.

What are we doing
out here?

1036
00:55:48,446 --> 00:55:49,912
- I thought...

1037
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:51,347
I thought you could use
some fresh air.

1038
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:53,415
- Oh. No, I hate fresh air.

1039

I need another drink.

to drink, karen.

Am I ruining
your little party?

1044
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:05,627
Good. You deserve it
after what you did to me.

1045
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,096
- And what have I done to you?

1046
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,698
- Your boy, jason,

1047
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:11,667
was in such a hurry
the other night

1048
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,235
that he forgot his belt.

1049
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,938
Bill found it
the next morning.

1050
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,373
- Oh.

1051
00:56:17,408 --> 00:56:18,907
Oh.

1052
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,851
- I tried to convince him that I
bought it for him as a present,

1053
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:32,554
but he... He got very angry.

1054
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:34,289
So now he wants a divorce.

1055
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,991
- Well, maybe you should
give him one.

1056

- Really?

1057
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:40,829

Then I'll be left with nothing.

"business trips."

the house before he gets back.

going to do?

00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,687
- Well, I can lend you
a bit of money, karen,

1067
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:08,323
but I'm sure that you have other
friends that have money too.

1068
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:09,992
- Oh, no.

1069
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:13,862
You're going to do more
than "loan me a little money."

1070
00:57:13,898 --> 00:57:15,564
You're going
to give me money.

1071
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,666
After all,
this is all your fault.

1072
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,168
- Oh, it's my fault, is it?

1073
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,303
- Yes. Putting ideas in my head,

1074
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:24,706
sending your boys over
to tantalize me, to prey on me.

1075
00:57:24,742 --> 00:57:26,508
- Karen, you're drunk,
sweetheart.

1076
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,777
I think you should go home,
lie down for a little bit

1077
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,780
and sober up so that you don't
say something you might regret.

1078
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:33,081
- Oh.

1079
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:35,384
Well, I might be drunk,

1080
00:57:35,419 --> 00:57:37,119
but you're loaded, courtney.

1081
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,087
I want $100,000.

1082
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,355
- Are you out of your mind?

1083
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,258
- I want $100,000,

1084
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:46,061
or I will tell everybody
about your little business,

1085
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:47,763
miss entrepreneur.

1086
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,998
Oh, I know you think
you run the town.

1087
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,168
You've got your thumb
on the pulse.

1088
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,003
Just wait till they hear
this little story.

1089
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,772
I've got a title for it.

1090
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,874
"Cul-de-sac madame."

1091
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,877
- So you're willing to ruin
yourself as well, are you?

1092
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,979
- I'm already ruined.

1093
00:58:04,014 --> 00:58:06,215
I've got nothing to lose.

1094
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:07,783
- Karen, I want you to leave.

1095
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,485
Now.

1096
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:12,087
- Okay.

1097
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,555
I'll leave.

1098
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:15,724
I want $100,000,

1099
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,228
and I expect that cash
tonight, or I'm calling...

1100
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:20,929
[mouthing]

1101
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:22,865
- watch your step, karen.

1102
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,266
- Watch your back.

1103
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,171
[Indistinct chatter]

1104
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,115
- everything okay?

1105
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,550
- Yeah.

1106
00:58:43,487 --> 00:58:46,455
Karen and her husband
are getting divorced.

1107
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,223
- Oh. That's too bad.

1108
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,526
- Yeah, she seems
really stressed.

1109
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:53,228
Speaking of which,

1110
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:55,297
are you okay?

1111
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:57,599
- Oh, yeah, it's just...

1112
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:00,102
Jason's been acting
strange lately.

1113
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,837
And this investigation
at school...

1114
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,706
- What investigation?

1115
00:59:04,742 --> 00:59:06,942
- Do you remember that boy
who drowned a while back?

1116
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,343
- Mm, yes.

1117
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:10,946
I-I think I remember
something about that.

1118
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:12,447
- I spoke with
his girlfriend,

1119
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,182
and she told me
that he was involved

1120
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,784
in illegal activities.

1121
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:17,519
- Really?

1122
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,855
- And the police don't think
his drowning was an accident.

1123
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:22,357
- What?

1124
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:23,992
- They think he may
have been murdered.

1125
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,428
Isn't that awful?

1126
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:29,298
You just never know

1127
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,333
what's going on
in people's lives.

1128
00:59:31,368 --> 00:59:33,869
They can seem perfectly normal
on the outside.

1129
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,771
But underneath...

1130
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,205
- Excuse me.

1131
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,308
Can I steal courtney away
for a second?

1132
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,043
I just want to grab some
pictures for the paper.

1133
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,445
- Of course.
- Please excuse me, nicole.

1134
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:50,218
- [Sighs]

1135
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,428
do you know where
the restroom is?

1136
01:00:00,564 --> 01:00:01,897
Thank you.

1137
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:12,674
Oh!
- Oh!

1138
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:14,576
- I'm sorry, I was looking
for the restroom.

1139
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:15,877
- It's right down there.

1140
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:17,145
- Thank you.

1141
01:00:25,089 --> 01:00:27,255
- Sorry, I got out
as soon as I could.

1142
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,224
- No worries.
- So, what's up?

1143
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,892
Did your mom
say something?

1144
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,929
- No, mom's still over
at the party.

1145
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,331
- Oh.

1146
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,200
So, what's--what's the big
emergency?

1147
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:40,535
- Do you know a guy
named benjamin?

1148
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:43,505
- Yeah. Yeah, I know benjamin.

1149
01:00:43,607 --> 01:00:45,707
Did he come by?
Did he say something to you?

1150
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,509
- Well, yeah, he--

1151
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:49,378
he was in the locker room
last night after you left.

1152
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,681
He gave me my next client,
and then he freaked out on me.

1153
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:54,216
- Dude.

1154
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,084
That kid is a psychopath.

1155
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,253
You need to stay
away from him.

1156
01:00:58,288 --> 01:00:59,955
I think even courtney
is scared of him.

1157
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,757
- Why does she
keep him around?

1158
01:01:01,792 --> 01:01:04,126
- He kind of got her started.

1159
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,394
He needed her contacts,

1160
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:07,763
and I guess she saw
an opportunity.

1161
01:01:07,798 --> 01:01:10,399
But he sort of stepped out
on his own now.

1162
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,134
Try to get me to work
for him instead.

1163
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,836
- Is that who hit you
the other day?

1164
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,106
- I told him to go to hell.

1165
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:19,775
I'm not working for a lunatic
like that.

1166
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,143
- Dude, we need to go
to the police then.

1167
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:22,577
- How do you think
they've got away with it

1168
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,979
all these years?
[Cell phone buzzing]

1169
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,581
I mean, courtney's probably
paying them off.

1170
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:28,450
Is that your next client?
- Yeah.

1171
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,585
Yeah, I should probably go.

1172
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,654
- All right, well, I'll head
back to the party, all right?

1173
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,089
- All right.
Meet me back here?

1174
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,557
- Yeah.

1175
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,908
- Hello.

1176
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:54,309
Wasn't expecting you.

1177
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,311
- Hello, karen.

1178
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:57,779
It's been a while.

1179
01:01:57,815 --> 01:02:01,550
- Yes, it has.

1180
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:03,585
- Courtney asked me
to give this to you.

1181
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:07,489
- Didn't realize
you still worked for her.

1182
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:09,925
- Yeah, from time to time.

1183
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:13,228
I hear you're all alone
tonight.

1184
01:02:14,298 --> 01:02:15,931
- Guess so.

1185
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:18,567
- Would you like
some company?

1186
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:20,902
- Why not?

1187
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:23,271
You were always
my favorite.

1188
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,456
It's been a while.

1189
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,232
What's this?

1190
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,134
Oh! Ah!

1191
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:57,639
[Gasping]

1192
01:02:58,575 --> 01:03:00,375
[gunshot]
[drops gun]

1193
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,612
[groans]

1194
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,379
- benjamin.

1195
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:42,617
Benjamin?
What happened?

1196
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,085
- She shot me.

1197
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:46,755
Karen shot me.

1198
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:48,924
- Well, we got to call you
an ambulance.

1199
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,458
- No!

1200
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:52,360
Gunshot wounds get reported
to the police.

1201
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:55,263
When they find karen's body,

1202
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,465
they'll figure out
what happened.

1203
01:03:57,568 --> 01:03:59,734
- You're right.
- So call your friends.

1204
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:02,704
You must have a client
who's a doctor.

1205
01:04:03,974 --> 01:04:05,340
- Are you sure
that karen's dead?

1206
01:04:05,442 --> 01:04:08,243
- Of course I'm sure.

1207
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,511
- I don't like mistakes.

1208
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,379
- I don't make
mistakes.

1209
01:04:11,415 --> 01:04:13,715
- You sure about that?
- What's that supposed to mean?

1210
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,417
- When you went to see jason
at school,

1211
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,185
did you hurt him?

1212
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:18,787
- What? No.

1213
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,255
- No?

1214
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,593
- I scared him a little bit,
but I didn't hurt him.

1215
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:26,061
- I just wanted you
to talk to him.

1216
01:04:26,096 --> 01:04:27,796
- You wanted him
back in line.

1217
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:29,764
I got him back in line.

1218
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,368
- You punched daniel after I
sent you to go and talk to him.

1219
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,736
- I'm not saying
I'm not going to do it.

1220
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:36,271
I'm just saying--

1221
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:38,573
- he was being difficult,
and now he's not.

1222
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:40,208
Why are you bringing this up
right now?

1223
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:42,043
Please call someone.
- I didn't want him hurt.

1224
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:45,146
I didn't want
any of my boys hurt.

1225
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,215
- Sometimes things
get out of line.

1226
01:04:47,317 --> 01:04:49,284
Accidents happen.

1227
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,786
Will you please
call someone?

1228
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:54,222
- Is that what happened with
chad? Was that an accident?

1229
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,458
- What are you talking about?

1230
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:57,792
- Did you kill him?

1231
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:06,801
You did kill him.

1232
01:05:06,837 --> 01:05:08,603
- What does it matter?

1233
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:10,605
He wasn't going to work
for you anymore.

1234
01:05:10,641 --> 01:05:12,641
- You're out of control.

1235
01:05:12,676 --> 01:05:13,975
- And you're too soft.

1236
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:15,944
That's why you pay me.

1237
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:17,846
I clean up after your messes.

1238
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:19,881
- I didn't want you to kill
