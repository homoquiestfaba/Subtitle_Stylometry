405
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:09,841
Near them on the sand,
half sunk, a shattered visage lies,

00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,258
whose frown and wrinkled lip

407
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,681

well those passions read,

409

which yet survive,
stamped on these lifeless things...

410
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,568
the hand that mocked them,

411
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,240
and the heart that fed.

412
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,741
And on the pedestal, these words appear:

413
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,369
'My name...

414
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,084

And the Lord said unto Cain,
"Where is Abel, thy brother?"

When to the sessions
of sweet silent thought,

Up, there you go.

454
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,223
And it came to pass
when they were in a field,

455
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:40,466
that Cain rose up against Abel his brother
and slew him!

[rattle mimicking thunder]

457
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:47,694
And the Lord said unto Cain,
"Where is Abel, thy brother?"

458
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,064
And he said, "I know not.

459
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:54,239
Am I my brother's keeper?"
And the Lord said, "What has thou done?"

00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:58,108
When to the sessions
of sweet silent thought

461
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:03,332
I summon up remembrance of things past.

00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,501

463

and with old woes, new wail,
my dear time's waste.

464
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,803
Then can I drown an eye unus'd to flow,

for precious friends hid,
in death stateless night,

466
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,891
and weep afresh love's long
since cancell'd woe,

467
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:28,185
and moan the expense
of many a vanished sight.

468
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:33,864
That this nation under God
shall have a new birth of freedom,

469

[man] I heard it through the walls.

741
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:44,198
He made noises, strange noises,

742
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:47,741
which he characterized as a cough.
[chuckles]

743
01:10:47,826 --> 01:10:50,826
Frightening.
I've never heard such a cough.

744
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,583
And this cough did to not respond
to any kind of syrup or elixir,

745
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,249
and it was an extremely rattly cough.

746
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:59,586
No, I was not sad
to see Mr. Kincaid leave.

747
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,343
[woman] It was not a contagious cough.

748
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:03,512
Nobody here became ill.

749
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,339
It was a nervous cough.

750
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,184
I would not rent to a contagious cougher.

751
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,979
I've never heard of a nervous cough.

752
01:11:11,058 --> 01:11:13,228
I understand
that you are about to leave us.

753
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:16,520
The nervous system spreads its tendrils
throughout the body.

754
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,935
I saw a picture of it in a book.

755
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:20,863
The nervous system
does not have tendrils.

756
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,453
I don't pretend to be a physician
or a botanist,

757
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:28,160
but I know the nervous system
extends through the body

758
01:11:28,242 --> 01:11:30,412
and I presume that is how it learns

759
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:33,584
of the various physical conditions
that it imitates.

760
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:36,504
Mrs. Flannery is quite right.
I've seen that picture.

761
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:40,843
My point is only that Mr. Kincaid
was not a contagious cougher.

762
01:11:40,921 --> 01:11:44,431
- I don't rent to such.
- Is there any more chicken and dumplings?

763
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,142
The bowl came to me last.

764
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:49,388
Yes, there's more.
We don't stint at this table.

Leaving us tomorrow,
jumping off the map so to speak?

769
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:05,608
Yes, indeed. My brother and I are
setting off in the morning for Oregon.

770
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,066
Oregon?
Oh, you have people out there or are you...

771
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:12,077
Just scoop from her plate, Mrs. Halliday.
Grandma Turner's quite done.

No, I... Not exactly.

Well, go ahead and tell him, Alice.
Don't be tongue-tied.

He's well fixed out there.

You are not certain
whether you are going to be married?

781
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,015
Has the gentleman not proposed?

782
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,515
He... Well, he...

783
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:47,110
He will propose once they meet each other.
I'm sure Alice will pass muster.

784
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,913
The match is a good one.

785
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,528
I'm joining him in a business opportunity,

786
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:54,787
and he's declared himself ready to marry
when he finds a suitable match.

787
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:58,920
Alice can be very sociable and attractive
when she has a mind to be.

788
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,383
She doesn't always have a mind to be.

803
01:13:46,338 --> 01:13:47,258
Indeed.

804
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,506
Why to you?

805
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,852
I believe they assumed he was my dog.

806
01:13:54,805 --> 01:13:57,885
Well, I don't know what to say.
President Pierce is a nervous creature

807
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:00,435
and excited by animals larger
than himself.

808
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:04,271
Almost all animals are larger
than President Pierce.

01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,518
Well, what of it?

all the way to the Willamette Valley.

What if he does?

813
01:14:13,740 --> 01:14:15,990
There are property rights.
The dog is my property.

My property barks. There you have it.

815

what's what.

We'll leave off then.

Better anyway not to advertise
to the Indians.

Well, they don't bother us none.

Could I ask your advice, Mr. Knapp?

867
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,344
Certainly, Miss.

01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:03,505
Would you like some supper
or coffee with us?

869
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:04,965
No, thank you.

870
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,393
My hired boy, Matt,

871
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:13,356
he told me that my brother promised him
half his wages

872
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:14,858
when we get to Fort Laramie.

873
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:18,033
- How much he say that was?
- [Alice] Two hundred dollars.

874
01:18:18,485 --> 01:18:20,145
Two hundred dollars is half?

875
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,451
Yes.

876
01:18:23,115 --> 01:18:25,405
And the other half
when we get to the Willamette Valley.

877
01:18:25,492 --> 01:18:29,202
- High price.
- It is an extravagant wage.

878
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:31,874
Is it?

879
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:34,957
- That's a high price.
- You think the boy's telling a story?

880
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,923
Now that your brother is no longer...

881
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,168
I don't know.

882
01:18:40,006 --> 01:18:42,216
Gilbert was not a good businessman.

883
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:47,643
He had an enterprise in Iowa City
that ended poorly,

884
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,433
and earlier, another that...

885
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,846
He was a failure.

886
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:55,769
That's a high price.

887
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,437
Well, there is another problem.

888
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,284
[sighs]
I cannot find any money in the wagon.

889
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,873
I believe Gilbert kept it
in his waistcoat.

890
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,285
Then he's still got it.

891
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,127
A half-day's ride.

892
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:16,418
[Knapp] Where to?

893
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,423
How do we find him?

894
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,086
Oh, I don't think so.

895
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:25,764
[exhales] I suggest you not argue
with the boy until we get to Fort Laramie.

896
01:19:26,344 --> 01:19:27,184
And then?

897
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:29,470
[exhales]

898
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:31,022
Well...

899
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,805
maybe I will talk to the boy.

900
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:36,731
See if I can shake him loose
from his story.

901
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,903
Four hundred dollars. I don't know.

902
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,568
I will have to think on this one.

903
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:18,145
[Knapp] Miss? Could I have a word?

904
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,570
Certainly, Mr. Knapp.
Could I offer you supper?

905
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,572
Well, thank you. I've had mine.

906
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:26,905
[Knapp clears throat]

907
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,912
This is awkward, Miss, but...

908
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:33,252
people have complained to Mr. Arthur
and myself about your little, uh...

909
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,155
- President Pierce?
- [yips]

910
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,667
- I have no doubt but that's your dog.
- He is not my dog.

911
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,166
- Miss?
- He was...

912
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,840
Mr. Longabaugh's.

913
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,590
I know it's terrible, the noise.
I don't know what to do.

914
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,505
Well then, I thought he was your dog.

915
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,598
Maybe this is quite a simple matter. Uh...

916
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:52,854
Can I put him down for you, Miss?

917
01:20:55,934 --> 01:21:00,194
All right. Well, could we not
just scare him off?

918
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,942
[Knapp] Well, no.

919
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,863
We are his food and he will follow us,
long as he can.

920
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:08,322
And a wolf might play with him...

921
01:21:08,613 --> 01:21:09,573
uh...

922
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,065
before he eats him.

923
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:12,368
Faster is better.

924
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:14,084
Yes. I understand.

925
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:18,253
I will attend to it right away.

926
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:21,325
[dog whimpers]

927
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:25,511
Oh.

928
01:21:28,008 --> 01:21:29,588
I regret to have to tell you...

929
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,469
I talked to your boy, Matt.

930
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:35,271
I could not get him to budge.

931
01:21:36,808 --> 01:21:38,688
Thank you, Mr. Knapp. You are...

932
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:41,055
very kind to extend yourself.

933
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:44,901
Here we go, little dog.

934
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,060
- [distant gunshot]
- [gasps]

935
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,682
[two more gunshots]

936
01:22:38,912 --> 01:22:41,292
I set President Pierce down, and...

937
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:43,579
[sighs]

938
01:22:45,418 --> 01:22:46,628
Uh...

939
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:49,133
he moved just as I fired.

940
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,216
He skittered off, Miss. I...

941
01:22:54,678 --> 01:22:56,258
I don't believe I hit him at all.

942
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:58,637
[whispers] Oh, my God.

943
01:22:58,723 --> 01:23:00,733
I should have deputized Mr. Arthur.

944
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,561
That man is a crack shot.

945
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:05,114
- I didn't expect...
- Well, it was very kind of you.

946
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:10,688
I do not think
you will see President Pierce again.

947
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:13,994
[man urging oxen forward]

948
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:45,102
I'm... I'm sorry to trouble you again.

949
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:48,229
You're no trouble, Miss Longabaugh.

950
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,276
I do apologize, Mr. Knapp.

951
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,744
Interrupting your supper.

952
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:57,235
Please, set your mind at ease, Miss.

953
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:01,949
It is my duty to guide the train
and meet square any unexpected problem.

954
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,207
Well, things are developing for the worse.

955
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,995
- Yeah?
- [Alice] My boy, Matt,

956
01:24:07,083 --> 01:24:10,343
has asked me to affirm
his arrangement with my brother.

957
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:14,337
He asked me to declare he will receive
his two payments in Fort Laramie,

958
01:24:14,424 --> 01:24:15,434
and in Oregon.

959
01:24:16,092 --> 01:24:18,222
He says if I will not affirm it,
he will depart.

960
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:21,143
He will join the first party
of go-backers we meet.

961
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:22,805
And leave you.

962
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,978
Leave you out here with the wagon
high and dry.

963
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:27,061
[Alice] Yes.

964
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,523
Well, well, well.

965
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:31,606
- Yes, but...
- [Knapp] Please, sit down, Miss. We...

966
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,446
- We better talk about this.
- I don't like it.

967
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,701
But I don't know
that it is wrong of him to ask.

968
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,242
He is doing a job for pay.

969
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,498
You are very broad-minded
to see the other side of it.

970
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,580
But then what shall I do, Mr. Knapp?

971
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:51,285
Shall I confess I have no money?
What is right?

972
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:54,014
What is right?

973
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,387
Miss Longabaugh...

974
01:25:01,387 --> 01:25:06,347
I cannot offer to drive your team
or tend your wagon in place of the boy.

975
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:08,524
- Mr. Arthur...
- I would not ask you to do so.

976
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:10,813
Oh, indeed.
These are my thoughts, not yours.

977
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:15,194
Mr. Arthur and I have to ride
one in front of the train, one behind.

978
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:18,396
We take turns, pilot and drag, but...

979
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,950
Will you trust me for a day?

980
01:25:24,035 --> 01:25:25,745
Well, certainly. But how so?

981
01:25:27,205 --> 01:25:29,245
Tell the boy you affirm the agreement.

982
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,043
I want to think on this for a day.

983
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:36,841
I have a notion
that you may think is crackpot, but...

984
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,010
I do not believe it is.

985
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,802
I'm sure it is not crackpot.

986
01:25:41,678 --> 01:25:42,718
We'll see.

987
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,351
[inhales]

988
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:45,470
Give me a day.

989
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,177
I must talk to Mr. Arthur.

990
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:49,097
Then we will talk tomorrow and...

991
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:52,194
If you think it is a bad idea, well then,

992
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,687
we will have only taken one extra day
of the boy's labor.

993
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:10,961
Afternoon, partner.

994
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,251
Mm-hmm.

995
01:26:14,043 --> 01:26:15,003
[clucks]

996
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:17,462
Which is worse, partner?

997
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,126
Dust or mud?

998
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:21,969
Both, I guess.

999
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,389
Say... [clears throat]

1000
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:28,812
I was thinking of proposing
to Miss Longabaugh.

1001
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,188
That right?

1002
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,355
Yes, and...

1003
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,779
if she accepts, well then...

1004
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,450
I will settle in Oregon.

1005
01:26:41,487 --> 01:26:43,197
This would be my last wagon train.

1006
01:26:45,491 --> 01:26:47,331
I will farm.

1007
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:51,405
[Arthur grunts]

1008
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:53,962
Well...

1009
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:56,044
we'll see how she takes it.

1010
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,959
Well, I guess I'll head back up.
[clears throat]

1011
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:02,048
Unless you desire a swap.

1012
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:03,592
Nope.

1013
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:07,432
- Afternoon.
- Yep.

1014
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:09,813
Hep!

1015
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:19,073
[fiddle music playing]

1016
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,891
- Miss.
- Good evening, Mr. Knapp.

1017
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:54,559
May we talk for a moment?

1018
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,359
So your crackpot notion?

1019
01:28:03,736 --> 01:28:04,946
[sighs] Yes.

1020
01:28:05,029 --> 01:28:05,859
[clears throat]

1021
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:09,704
Before I expose it, may I ask something?

1022
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:10,914
Certainly.

1023
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:11,834
What...

1024
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,707
possibilities do you look forward to
in Oregon?

1025
01:28:18,209 --> 01:28:19,419
I don't quite know.

1026
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,051
[sighs]

1027
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,669
Gilbert knows... knew someone there.

1028
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,512
A Mr. Vereen who owns an orchard,

1029
01:28:26,592 --> 01:28:30,512
or maybe more than one orchard,
and a cartage company.

1030
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:34,596
[sighs] He was vague about his connection
with Mr. Vereen,

1031
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:38,651
and... and about his own
prospective position.

1032
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:42,105
I don't wish to slight
my brother's memory, but he could...

1033
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:45,742
exaggerate the nature of an opportunity.

1034
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,164
And...

1035
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:50,160
And Mr. Vereen's interest in myself...

1036
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:55,078
I fear that may also
have been speculative.

1037
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:58,366
I see. [clears throat]

1038
01:28:58,499 --> 01:29:02,419
So, this is no definite
prospect of marriage.

1039
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:04,963
- No contract.
- I...

1040
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:07,838
No.

1041
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:09,755
Well...

1042
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:10,854
[exhales]

1043
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,810
My idea then is this...

1044
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,978
And I submit it in respect,
Miss Longabaugh.

1045
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:23,939
I propose to assume your brother's debt
to the hired boy and to...

1046
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,199
to ask you to marry me.

1047
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:38,750
Oh.

1048
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:41,751
I submit it in respect.

1049
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:46,213
Oh.

1050
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:50,468
I have ambushed you.

1051
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:51,840
[scoffs]

1052
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,928
- I'm very sorry.
- No, no, no.

1053
01:29:54,013 --> 01:29:56,723
I should clarify
what brings me to say these things,

1054
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,428
or I will seem like the veriest bounder.

1055
01:29:58,976 --> 01:30:03,686
[sighs] I found myself thinking
about certain matters. Um...

1056
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,441
I have been busting trail for 15 years.

1057
01:30:08,986 --> 01:30:11,906
Last 12 with Mr. Arthur.
Mr. Arthur's a top man.

1058
01:30:12,573 --> 01:30:16,413
[sighs] Top man, but he is...
he is getting older.

1059
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:18,960
Slower to straighten in the morning.

1060
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:22,627
- Sleeping on the ground, Miss...
- Yes.

1061
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:25,708
To have no family
and to sleep on the ground...

1062
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,967
- Yes, it cannot be easy.
- Looking at him, well...

1063
01:30:31,717 --> 01:30:35,297
I myself have come to the age
where either I will settle

1064
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:39,098
and have children
who can take care of me when I'm old

1065
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:40,936
or I will not.

1066
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:43,484
That time will have passed.

1067
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:44,978
Yes.

1068
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:48,647
So I found myself thinking, well...

1069
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:54,370
if I met a maiden or a widow of honor,

1070
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:55,369
uh...

1071
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,369
perhaps I would...

1072
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,910
- Yes.
- ...present myself...

1073
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:02,327
[Alice] Yes, I understand.

1074
01:31:02,623 --> 01:31:03,503
Uh...

1075
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:05,747
Yes.

1076
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:13,183
You're acquainted with the 1872 Grant?

1077
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:16,758
I am not.

1078
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,345
A settler in Oregon can claim 320 acres.

1079
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:24,395
A... married couple can claim 640.

1080
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,019
There is a, um...

1081
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:33,607
In Fort Laramie, there is a Mr. Bourgeois
who can sanctify marriage.

1082
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:37,871
Do you engage in divine worship?

1083
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:39,583
Yes.

1084
01:31:40,286 --> 01:31:41,576
I am a Methodist.

1085
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:43,577
Yourself, Miss?

1086
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,670
I'm Episcopalian.

1087
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,007
What is your Christian name, Mr. Knapp?

1088
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:57,597
Uh, William.

1089
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,893
I am Billy Knapp.

1090
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:02,476
I am Alice Longabaugh.

1091
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:07,941
Now I suppose it is my turn to think.

1092
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:09,321
Of course.

1093
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:10,899
We will, um...

1094
01:32:11,817 --> 01:32:13,987
We will let the boy keep working then?

1095
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,489
On his assumption of payment?

1096
01:32:17,073 --> 01:32:18,373
[soft whine in distance]

1097
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,235
[bark in distance]

1098
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:28,126
- [woman] What are you doing, Israel?
- Walking backwards.

1099
01:32:28,501 --> 01:32:31,171
Going to walk the rest of the way
to Oregon backwards.

1100
01:32:31,587 --> 01:32:33,257
- Don't do that.
- [Israel] Why not?

1101
01:32:33,339 --> 01:32:34,799
I said don't do that.

1102
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,928
- Don't do that!
- [grunts]

1103
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:54,025
Noon here!

1104
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:56,320
[excited chatter]

1105
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:06,865
[Knapp exhales]

1106
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:08,995
[sighs] Thank you.

1107
01:33:13,796 --> 01:33:15,796
- [indistinct chatter]
- [oxen mooing]

1108
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,525
Best not to get too far
from the train, Miss.

1109
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:39,991
It's like the ocean out here.

1110
01:33:40,823 --> 01:33:42,953
Easy to get lost, Miss.

1111
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,330
I thought I should add... [clears throat]

1112
01:33:46,412 --> 01:33:49,122
Alice, lest I seem hard-nosed...

1113
01:33:50,791 --> 01:33:53,171
If you see fit to decline my proposal,
why...

1114
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:56,085
there's more than one way to skin a cat.

1115
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:59,007
We might find a boy from another wagon
to drive your team,

1116
01:33:59,091 --> 01:34:01,091
use your oxen as payment.

1117
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:04,427
We will get you to Oregon, safe and sound.

1118
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:08,521
I don't wish to present myself
as the only alternative to ruin this.

1119
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,771
But I'm inclined to accept your proposal.

1120
01:34:14,106 --> 01:34:15,146
All right.

1121
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:17,442
And I don't take yourself
to be hard-nosed.

1122
01:34:20,571 --> 01:34:21,451
All right.

1123
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:24,120
My dear brother was very hard-nosed.

1124
01:34:25,493 --> 01:34:27,163
But never very successful.

1125
01:34:27,745 --> 01:34:29,245
It was frustrating for him.

1126
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:32,038
- I'm very sorry you have lost him.
- [Alice] Yes.

1127
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:34,464
But he is with his creator.

1128
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:37,051
His way is easy now.

1129
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,473
Yes, his way was difficult.

1130
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:41,177
[chuckles]

1131
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:44,852
I must say,
it was difficult to be with him.

1132
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,716
I was very nervous being with him.

1133
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:52,056
Not afraid of him.
He would not hurt a fly. I was just...

1134
01:34:53,771 --> 01:34:54,941
not at ease.

1135
01:34:56,023 --> 01:35:00,573
I was eaten up by nerves at the thought
of talking to Mr. Vereen, for instance.

1136
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,368
And yet, you...

1137
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:08,951
are so very easy to talk to.

1138
01:35:12,415 --> 01:35:14,245
Perhaps we'll find comfort together.

1139
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,050
I had hoped for that as well.

1140
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:20,918
Yes, William.

1141
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,966
- [man] Come on, boys! Push harder!
- [men grunting]

1142
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:30,016
Come on!

1143
01:35:47,616 --> 01:35:49,616
Well, it...

1144
01:35:50,202 --> 01:35:51,122
[clears throat]

1145
01:35:54,957 --> 01:35:56,877
It appears Miss Longabaugh is...

1146
01:35:57,793 --> 01:35:59,843
inclined to accept my proposal.

1147
01:36:10,347 --> 01:36:11,467
[Arthur] Mm-hmm.

1148
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,693
Of course, you will do fine solo.

1149
01:36:17,605 --> 01:36:20,855
No doubt about it. Man of your skills
will always be in high demand.

1150
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,491
Where the hell is that hobble?

1151
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,320
Oh, never mind. Here it is.

1152
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:36,866
That man is a wonder.

1153
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,339
Well, he can read the prairie like a book.

1154
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:42,708
To see him cut for sign, well,

1155
01:36:43,088 --> 01:36:45,628
you'd think the good Lord
dealt us each our five senses

1156
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:47,796
and bottom dealt Mr. Arthur one extra.

1157
01:36:48,219 --> 01:36:49,089
Hmm.

1158
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:52,350
Still... he is old.

1159
01:36:54,099 --> 01:36:56,269
I don't know how it'll go for him.

1160
01:36:56,852 --> 01:36:58,852
I can't help feeling in the wrong.

1161
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:02,525
Your first responsibility
is to your household.

1162
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:05,244
- Yes, but...
- [Alice] I'm sorry.

1163
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:07,779
I should not dismiss it
with an easy apothegm.

1164
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,159
- Yes.
- Gilbert had a saying for any situation.

1165
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,203
A ready bit of wisdom.

1166
01:37:16,413 --> 01:37:18,173
He was very certain.

1167
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:19,669
He was a doughface?

1168
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,416
How did... Oh! [nervous laugh]

1169
01:37:22,878 --> 01:37:26,838
Yes. He was an admirer
of President Pierce, yes.

1170
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:30,222
He had fixed political beliefs.

1171
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,255
All of his beliefs were quite fixed.

1172
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:37,602
He would upbraid me for being wishy-washy.

1173
01:37:39,854 --> 01:37:41,694
I never had his certainties.

1174
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:44,149
I suppose it is a defect.

1175
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,073
I don't think it's a defect at all.

1176
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:48,491
Oh, no.

1177
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:51,526
Uncertainty...

1178
01:37:52,908 --> 01:37:55,198
That is appropriate
for matters of this world.

1179
01:37:56,495 --> 01:37:59,115
Only regarding the next
are we vouchsafed certainty.

1180
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:00,667
Yes.

1181
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,672
I believe certainty regarding
that which we can see and touch,

1182
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:08,764
it is seldom justified, if ever.

1183
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:13,678
Down the ages, from our remote past,

1184
01:38:13,762 --> 01:38:15,472
what certainties survive?

1185
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:20,057
And yet we hurry to fashion new ones.

1186
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:22,864
Wanting their comfort.

1187
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:25,570
Certainty...

1188
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:27,782
[Knapp chuckles]

1189
01:38:28,694 --> 01:38:30,154
...is the easy path.

1190
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:32,865
Just as you said.

1191
01:38:38,495 --> 01:38:40,115
"Straight is the gate..."

1192
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:44,166
"And narrow the way."

1193
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,090
Indeed.

1194
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,180
Indeed.

1195
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,346
[approaching hoofbeats]

1196
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:00,520
[man] Sign, Mr. Arthur?

1197
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:02,734
Horses.

1198
01:39:03,187 --> 01:39:04,517
You keep on.

1199
01:39:05,606 --> 01:39:06,856
Gonna talk to Mr. Knapp.

1200
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:21,618
- Hey!
- [man] Whoa! Whoa!

1201
01:39:22,748 --> 01:39:24,118
Where's the woman?

1202
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:25,535
Huh?

1203
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:27,745
Miss Longabaugh. Where is she?

1204
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:29,457
Went over there.

1205
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:31,216
Over there? Why's that?

1206
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:34,757
I don't know. Heard that mutt barking.
President Pierce.

1207
01:39:35,344 --> 01:39:36,264
[grunts]

1208
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:39,849
Hah! Hah! Yah, yah, yah! Yah!

1209
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:43,765
Yah!

1210
01:40:13,632 --> 01:40:15,132
[dog barking nearby]

1211
01:40:24,643 --> 01:40:26,193
[dog continues barking]

1212
01:40:29,523 --> 01:40:30,733
[kisses, clucks]

1213
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,069
- [barking continues]
- [Alice giggling]

1214
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,786
[laughing]

1215
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,760
- What are they, Mr. Arthur?
- Prairie dogs, ma'am.

1216
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,970
- [Alice] Aren't they darling? I believe...
- Ma'am, we best, uh...

1217
01:40:58,052 --> 01:41:01,852
President Pierce is trying to understand
what those creatures are,

1218
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:05,140
whether they're squirrels
and he should try to chase them,

1219
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:07,555
- or if they're other dogs.
- Get down.

1220
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:09,980
- Mr. Arthur?
- Get down now, Miss.

1221
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,774
- Get down!
- Mr. Arthur!

1222
01:41:11,857 --> 01:41:12,857
[Alice screams, dog yelps]

1223
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:15,112
Sit down below that rise there.

1224
01:41:15,402 --> 01:41:16,572
But aren't...

1225
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:19,414
- Just do as I say.
- [Alice stammers]

1226
01:41:19,490 --> 01:41:21,330
- We aren't going back?
- Not directly.

1227
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:46,272
We're in for a fight.

1228
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:48,727
He won't answer my peace sign.

1229
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:52,355
And we can't make a run for it
through this dog-town.

1230
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,069
There's only one savage.

1231
01:41:56,735 --> 01:41:58,195
[cackles]

1232
01:41:59,029 --> 01:42:00,739
Yeah, you keep looking. [chuckles]

1233
01:42:03,617 --> 01:42:04,737
- [Arthur grunts]
- [gasps]

1234
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:08,826
It's a war party and we probably
look like easy pickin's.

1235
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:11,669
[grunts] What they'll do, they'll rush us.

1236
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,550
'Course dog holes
is as bad for them as for us,

1237
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:17,591
and they don't know how to fight.

1238
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,546
If they was to come front and back,
I couldn't handle them,

1239
01:42:20,634 --> 01:42:23,604
but they rush in a bunch,
like damn fools.

1240
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,474
I beg your pardon, Miss.
Now you keep low here.

1241
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:27,854
Take this.

1242
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:30,640
- No.
- Take it. Take it now.

1243
01:42:30,727 --> 01:42:33,267
Got two bullets in it.
It ain't for shooting Indians.

1244
01:42:33,355 --> 01:42:34,765
If I see we're licked,

1245
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:37,687
I'm gonna shoot you and then
I'm gonna shoot myself, so that's okay.

1246
01:42:37,776 --> 01:42:39,776
But if you see that I'm done for,

1247
01:42:39,862 --> 01:42:41,662
well, you're gonna have to do
for yourself.

1248
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,539
Now you put it right there
so's you can't miss.

1249
01:42:46,618 --> 01:42:49,868
- No, no, no, no, no!
- This is business, Miss Longabaugh.

1250
01:42:49,955 --> 01:42:52,165
If they catch you, it won't be so good.

1251
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,289
After they take off
every stitch of your clothes

1252
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:55,536
and have their way with you,

1253
01:42:55,627 --> 01:42:57,417
they'll stretch you out with a rawhide,

1254
01:42:57,504 --> 01:43:00,514
and then they'll drive a stake through
the middle of your body into the ground

1255
01:43:00,591 --> 01:43:04,261
and then they'll do some other things,
and we can't have that.

1256
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:05,854
Now, we ain't licked yet.

1257
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:07,805
But if we are...

1258
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:11,060
you know what to do.

1259
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:17,274
- [men whooping, firing guns]
- [Arthur] That's supposed to scare us.

1260
01:43:17,482 --> 01:43:19,532
Won't bother us none, will it, Miss?

1261
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,740
No, Mr. Arthur.

1262
01:43:21,153 --> 01:43:23,743
That Indian in the middle there...
he's the mucky muck,

1263
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:26,282
and if I shoot him,
well, that's bad medicine,

1264
01:43:26,366 --> 01:43:29,196
and I think they'll all lose their spit
and light out.

1265
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,116
Anyway, we're gonna have us a good fight.

1266
01:43:34,583 --> 01:43:35,633
[cocks gun]

1267
01:43:36,668 --> 01:43:38,128
[thundering hooves approaching]

1268
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:46,088
[horse squeals]

1269
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:47,600
Dog hole!

1270
01:43:55,896 --> 01:43:56,766
[horse squeals]

1271
01:43:56,897 --> 01:43:57,937
[Arthur] Dog hole!

1272
01:43:58,023 --> 01:43:58,903
Ha!

1273
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:12,037
[man screaming]

1274
01:44:12,579 --> 01:44:13,909
- [gunshot]
- [shouts]

1275
01:44:15,123 --> 01:44:16,753
- [gunshot]
- [horse whinnies]

1276
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:28,391
[horse grunting]

1277
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,436
- [gunshot]
- [silence]

1278
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,903
[Arthur] They got the lay of the land now.

1279
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:46,449
Yah!

1280
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:49,698
This time they'll come with a purpose.

1281
01:44:50,492 --> 01:44:51,952
You all right, Miss?

1282
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,405
Yes, Mr. Arthur.

1283
01:44:53,495 --> 01:44:56,035
- [men hooting, firing guns]
- [thundering hooves]

1284
01:44:56,123 --> 01:44:58,173
[Arthur] They ain't gonna do this all day.

1285
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:01,378
This'll tell the tale.

1286
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:24,527
Come on.

1287
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:28,609
- [horse squeals]
- [man grunts]

1288
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:51,353
- Mr. Arthur?
- Hold on, Miss.

1289
01:46:01,438 --> 01:46:02,518
[Arthur grunts]

1290
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,340
[dog barks]

1291
01:46:46,233 --> 01:46:47,613
Oh, my.

1292
01:46:50,278 --> 01:46:51,278
[groans]

1293
01:46:56,326 --> 01:46:57,656
Poor little gal.

1294
01:46:59,788 --> 01:47:01,498
She hadn't ought to have did it.

1295
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:06,342
[Arthur sighs]

1296
01:47:07,337 --> 01:47:08,297
[dog whines]

1297
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:09,840
[heavy sigh]

1298
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,063
Oh, my.

01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:19,885
You did not wake me.

1321
01:49:21,513 --> 01:49:22,973
For I was not asleep.

1322
01:49:23,056 --> 01:49:25,556
Oh? Not asleep. I see.

1323
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:28,732
I apologize for disturbing anyone else

01:49:31,898 --> 01:49:33,438
How much to go, you reckon?

1326
01:49:33,525 --> 01:49:36,855
Oh, not a great distance.
Not great at all. We're making good time.

1327
01:49:36,945 --> 01:49:39,405
You haven't been to Fort Morgan before,
I take it.

1328
01:49:39,489 --> 01:49:41,449
Me? No.

1329
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:45,164
- You?
- Oh, yes, many times. Many times.

1330
01:49:45,662 --> 01:49:46,832
Ferrying cargo.

1331
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:51,464
Him's yourn?

1332
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:54,626
As much as he's anyone's.

1333
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:56,883
- Isn't he, Clarence?
- As much as anyone's.

1334
01:49:57,757 --> 01:50:00,677
- A loved one?
- By somebody, perhaps.

1335
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:02,641
You did not know him?

1336
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:05,266
We knew him only at the end.

1337
01:50:08,685 --> 01:50:11,515
No, I have not been to Fort Morgan.

1338
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,265
I know little of cities.

1339
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:16,896
I'm a trapper living alone mostly
in these last years,

1340
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:20,855
but I would descend into town
every so often with my pelts.

1341
01:50:21,197 --> 01:50:24,327
Uh, sell them and talk.
Keep my hand in talk.

1342
01:50:24,409 --> 01:50:27,749
You gotta keep your hand in talking
even if you live in the wild.

1343
01:50:27,829 --> 01:50:28,869
It's true. Practice.

1344
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:31,495
In town, I would talk to them
was interested.

1345
01:50:31,583 --> 01:50:35,843
Saloon mostly, till they asked me
to take my business elsewhere.

1346
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:39,764
What kind of sense that make?
There was only the one saloon.

1347
01:50:40,383 --> 01:50:42,973
Keeper called me tedious.

1348
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:44,513
Tedious! Me.

1349
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:47,519
If tidings from the greater world
are tedious,

1350
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,769
I would descend from the mountains,

1351
01:50:49,851 --> 01:50:53,191
not having talked for many months,
with much to tell.

1352
01:50:53,271 --> 01:50:55,901
Much to tell, having stored considerable.

1353
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:59,532
Though for many years,
I did not live alone in the wild.

1354
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:01,701
I did have a consort,

1355
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:03,990
a stout woman of the Hunkpapa Sioux.

1356
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:06,374
We had a companionship of sorts.

1357
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,910
But there is a lady present.

1358
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:12,615
A life together marked
by the passing of the seasons

1359
01:51:12,707 --> 01:51:15,287
and the corresponding travels of game.

1360
01:51:15,377 --> 01:51:17,627
In the latter,
she took very little interest.

1361
01:51:17,712 --> 01:51:20,382
Well, her duties was domestic.

1362
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:22,375
I would track and trap,

1363
01:51:22,467 --> 01:51:24,427
and she would terry hearthside.

1364
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:25,721
We did not talk.

1365
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:31,144
She had no English and I am not schooled
in the gibberings of the nations.

1366
01:51:31,226 --> 01:51:32,886
Well, I say we did not talk,

1367
01:51:32,977 --> 01:51:36,187
but sometimes we would, often at length,

1368
01:51:36,272 --> 01:51:40,532
each in own tongue without benefit
of understanding the other.

1369
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:43,490
But the sound of a human voice
is a comfort

1370
01:51:43,571 --> 01:51:45,411
when you're cabined up in the woods

1371
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:48,910
and all'd otherwise be
but the murmur of wind

1372
01:51:48,993 --> 01:51:52,503
and the clop of snow
from an overloaded branch.

1373
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:54,870
Well, I said
"not understanding each other,"

1374
01:51:54,958 --> 01:51:57,128
but it weren't entirely so.

1375
01:51:57,293 --> 01:52:00,553
I could often read by means
of the tenure of her speech

1376
01:52:00,630 --> 01:52:02,800
or certain facial expressions,

1377
01:52:02,882 --> 01:52:05,842
the emotional import
of what she was saying.

1378
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:08,257
And she was often vexed with me.

1379
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:09,716
I seldom knew why.

1380
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:11,926
And then she moved on.

1381
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:18,400
Did you love her?

1382
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:19,771
Oh, I don't know.

1383
01:52:19,858 --> 01:52:22,688
I never even knew her name,
but I will say this.

1384
01:52:22,777 --> 01:52:27,817
The nature of them vocal intonations
and the play of feeling upon her face

1385
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:30,118
helped me to gather that, uh...

1386
01:52:31,035 --> 01:52:33,365
people are like ferrets, or a beaver.

1387
01:52:33,788 --> 01:52:35,248
All pretty much alike.

1388
01:52:35,457 --> 01:52:36,707
Yeah, one like the next.

1389
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:39,706
I don't doubt it's the same
even if you travel to Siam.

1390
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:41,459
People are not the same.

1391
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:44,590
[stammering] There are two kinds,
utterly distinct.

1392
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:46,383
And what would those be, madame?

1393
01:52:46,468 --> 01:52:49,638
- Lucky and unlucky?
- No, hale and frail.

1394
01:52:50,096 --> 01:52:52,846
Difficult to knock to the floor,
or wilting.

1395
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:56,192
Those are not the two kinds.
You well know the two kinds.

1396
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:58,309
One kind. Ain't no two kinds.

1397
01:52:58,396 --> 01:53:00,316
Unless you mean trapper and townsman.

1398
01:53:00,398 --> 01:53:01,938
Upright and sinning.

1399
01:53:02,317 --> 01:53:03,397
Don't be a fool.

1400
01:53:03,485 --> 01:53:05,195
Fool? [chuckles] Oh, yes.

1401
01:53:05,278 --> 01:53:07,658
I know, "tedious fool."

1402
01:53:07,864 --> 01:53:10,414
You're not the first
to lodge that complaint.

1403
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:13,162
I challenge your credentials, madam,

1404
01:53:13,244 --> 01:53:14,664
for assessing human worth.

1405
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:16,326
People are like ferrets.

1406
01:53:16,456 --> 01:53:17,916
People are not like ferrets,

1407
01:53:17,999 --> 01:53:22,669
and I speak not on my own authority,
but on that of the Holy Bible.

1408
01:53:22,754 --> 01:53:25,094
And here I speak on high authority.

1409
01:53:25,173 --> 01:53:28,383
My husband, Dr. Betjeman, was an expert,

1410
01:53:28,510 --> 01:53:33,310
a lecturer at the Chautauqua
on moral and spiritual hygiene,

1411
01:53:33,389 --> 01:53:34,809
- now retired.
- Moral hygiene...

1412
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:37,101
I have the benefit of his insights.

1413
01:53:37,435 --> 01:53:39,765
His lectures were spectacularly attended.

1414
01:53:40,313 --> 01:53:45,153
He was... He is considered an expert
on spiritual betterment.

1415
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:48,113
Jacob's ladder?

1416
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:49,860
Betterment?

1417
01:53:50,907 --> 01:53:53,577
But I don't suppose you have ever
been much occupied

1418
01:53:53,701 --> 01:53:55,371
with the betterment of your soul.

1419
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:58,293
Well, I'm not an enemy of betterment,

1420
01:53:58,832 --> 01:54:02,792
but I am kept very busy with my traps.

1421
01:54:03,127 --> 01:54:04,297
[loud guffaw]

1422
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:05,379
[softer guffaw]

1423
01:54:05,463 --> 01:54:06,973
Your husband isn't with you.

1424
01:54:08,216 --> 01:54:10,176
We have been separated for some time.

1425
01:54:11,094 --> 01:54:13,264
He has been... East.

1426
01:54:13,805 --> 01:54:17,135
Illness has kept him,
but now we shall be reunited.

1427
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:21,024
- It will be a great joy.
- He awaits you in Fort Morgan?

1428
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:25,981
Yes. I have been living with my daughter
and son-in-law these last three years.

1429
01:54:26,401 --> 01:54:28,901
Parents should not burden
the household of the child.

1430
01:54:28,987 --> 01:54:30,357
This was wrong of you, madame.

1431
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:31,908
I was not a burden.

1432
01:54:32,156 --> 01:54:35,366
- I was welcome in my daughter's house.
- Oh, she would say so, of course,

1433
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:38,331
but no doubt you could read
in her facial expression,

1434
01:54:38,413 --> 01:54:43,253
as pointed out by the tedious man,
that your presence was not wanted.

1435
01:54:43,793 --> 01:54:45,463
We each have a life.

1436
01:54:45,587 --> 01:54:48,967
Each a life only our own.

1437
01:54:49,424 --> 01:54:51,634
You know nothing of me
or my domestic affairs.

1438
01:54:51,718 --> 01:54:55,178
I know that we must each
spin our own wheel and play our own hand.

1439
01:54:55,263 --> 01:54:59,103
I was once at cards
with a man named Cipolski.

1440
01:54:59,183 --> 01:55:01,393
- This was very many years ago...
- He a Polack?

1441
01:55:02,729 --> 01:55:05,649
- He was Polonais, oui. And we...
- I knew a Polack.

1442
01:55:07,817 --> 01:55:08,897
We were at cards.

1443
01:55:09,277 --> 01:55:12,657
My hand was poor, I folded,
but Cipolski and four others remained.

1444
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:15,619
Cipolski said to me,
"René, I am in distress.

1445
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,790
You must play for me
while I perform mes nécessités."

1446
01:55:17,869 --> 01:55:19,039
My necessaries.

1447
01:55:19,704 --> 01:55:22,584
I said, "Friend, no.
I cannot wager for you."

1448
01:55:22,665 --> 01:55:24,745
He said, "Of course you can.
We know each other well.

1449
01:55:24,834 --> 01:55:26,344
You wager as I would do."

1450
01:55:27,086 --> 01:55:29,376
I say, this is quite impossible, no?

1451
01:55:29,797 --> 01:55:33,797
How a man wager,
it is decided by who he is,

1452
01:55:34,177 --> 01:55:38,807
by the entirety of his relation to poker,
right up until the moment of that bet.

1453
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:41,225
I cannot bet for you. Pourquoi pas?

1454
01:55:41,309 --> 01:55:45,609
I cannot know you, not to this degree.

1455
01:55:45,688 --> 01:55:47,978
We must each play our own hand.

1456
01:55:48,107 --> 01:55:50,277
"No, Cipolski." I say, "No.

1457
01:55:50,610 --> 01:55:54,070
We may call each other friend,
but we cannot know each other so."

1458
01:55:54,155 --> 01:55:57,115
You can know him. People are like ferrets.

1459
01:55:57,200 --> 01:56:00,580
- People are not like ferrets!
- You misunderstand, mon vieux.

1460
01:56:00,787 --> 01:56:02,957
We can know each other, oui,
to a certain level,

1461
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:04,959
but to know entire, impossible.

1462
01:56:07,085 --> 01:56:08,875
- Poker is a gambling game.
- Mmm.

1463
01:56:09,087 --> 01:56:12,757
You have pursued a life
of vice and dissipation

1464
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,470
and you are no doubt expert
in such pursuits,

1465
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:19,470
but no conclusions drawn
from such an existence

1466
01:56:19,555 --> 01:56:21,715
will apply to a life rightly lived.

1467
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,098
Life is life.

1468
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:25,903
Cards will teach you
what you need to know.

1469
01:56:25,979 --> 01:56:29,859
You, madame, you speak of your life
with your husband, who awaits,

1470
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:33,951
and you fly to him with the certainty
he loves you as he did three years ago.

1471
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,030
Bon, three years.

1472
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:40,159
There was a flame.
You do not know there is.

1473
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:43,413
Among decent people,
relations are eternal.

1474
01:56:44,163 --> 01:56:47,633
Decent people stay true...
to others, to themselves.

1475
01:56:47,709 --> 01:56:50,249
- [René] Life is change.
- [woman] Presumptuous man.

1476
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:51,916
You say my daughter doesn't love me,

1477
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:54,755
- that my husband no longer does...
- If he ever did.

1478
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:56,381
- [gasps]
- No offense, madame.

1479
01:56:56,467 --> 01:56:59,467
My point is that we can never know,
not to the deepest level.

1480
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:03,394
And the word "love,"
well, it can have different meanings, no?

1481
01:57:03,474 --> 01:57:06,274
- Now hold on there, mister.
- [woman] I know what love means!

1482
01:57:06,352 --> 01:57:09,862
Your husband was a lecturer, oui,
he was an educator.

1483
01:57:09,939 --> 01:57:11,729
Would you say he was a man of charisma?

1484
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:12,936
He was. He is!

1485
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:16,196
Bon, love would mean something
quite different to such a person

1486
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:17,659
who commands the love of the crowd

1487
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:21,579
than it would to a person who can
only coax love through subservience.

1488
01:57:21,784 --> 01:57:25,714
I did not coax love from Dr. Betjeman.

1489
01:57:25,788 --> 01:57:27,458
[stammers] I am not a wheedler.

1490
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:30,252
My husband's love was freely given,
and endures.

1491
01:57:30,334 --> 01:57:33,634
His love was different from yours,
it's all I say.

1492
01:57:34,047 --> 01:57:36,967
The person widely admired
accepts love as a tribute

1493
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:39,970
and he confers his own love as an honor,

1494
01:57:40,053 --> 01:57:43,393
for, coming from him,
it must have great worth.

1495
01:57:43,473 --> 01:57:47,853
But you, madame, you would not
receive this gift splendidly

1496
01:57:47,935 --> 01:57:51,225
as one who has no need,
but you would grasp it as a beggar!

1497
01:57:51,314 --> 01:57:52,984
- Ain't no call for that!
- How dare you!

1498
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:54,936
Of course the great man, the admired man,

1499
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:58,106
he might well accept other loves,
simply as his due,

1500
01:57:58,196 --> 01:57:59,566
from some of those who admire him.

1501
01:57:59,655 --> 01:58:01,945
And why not, if the admirer's comely?

1502
01:58:02,033 --> 01:58:05,833
It is a love of a different kind,
of course, than the domestique.

1503
01:58:06,454 --> 01:58:09,004
- But in France, we say... [grunting]
- You...

1504
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:11,632
- You deplorable...
- [trapper] Ease up there now, lady!

1505
01:58:11,709 --> 01:58:14,549
- You depraved...
- Take it easy. He's just a Frenchman!

1506
01:58:14,629 --> 01:58:16,629
[panting, gasping]

1507
01:58:16,714 --> 01:58:19,224
- You've given her a fit, Frenchie!
- [horse whinnying]

1508
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:21,470
- We must stop the coach!
- Coachman won't stop.

1509
01:58:21,552 --> 01:58:23,642
[René]
He must stop. We are the passengers!

1510
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:25,601
- Coachman won't stop.
- We must stop. Coachman!

1511
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:28,231
- [galloping hooves]
- [horse whinnies]

1512
01:58:28,309 --> 01:58:29,269
Coachman!

1513
01:58:29,393 --> 01:58:31,063
Coachman, I say!

1514
01:58:31,145 --> 01:58:33,105
We must stop!

1515
01:58:33,523 --> 01:58:36,113
Coachman! Coach... Merde.

1516
01:58:37,652 --> 01:58:38,652
He will not stop.

1517
01:58:38,736 --> 01:58:40,146
He never stops. Policy.

1518
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,990
You're all right. You're all right, miss.

1519
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:46,039
Please... stop doing that.

1520
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:53,130

You'd think with the business we're in,

1555
02:01:25,820 --> 02:01:27,070
I wouldn't be so...

1556
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,409
What is your business?

1557
02:01:29,740 --> 02:01:30,700
Well...

1558
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:33,543
I like to say that we're...

1559
02:01:33,869 --> 02:01:36,409
- reapers.
- Harvesters of souls.

1560
02:01:36,497 --> 02:01:39,917
We help people
who have been adjudged to be ripe.

1561
02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:43,211
- You're bounty hunters.
- Literal man!

1562
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:47,167
Cruel man! Yes, fine. Bounty hunters.

1563
02:01:47,258 --> 02:01:50,678
An ugly title.
As if emolument were the point.

1564
02:01:50,761 --> 02:01:53,351
Is the cobbler not paid for his shoes?

1565
02:01:53,431 --> 02:01:55,771
- It's an honest calling.
- So, uh...

1566
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:57,807
him on the roof, he was wanted?

1567
02:01:58,394 --> 02:02:01,194
Oh, Mr. Thorpe was very much wanted,

1568
02:02:01,272 --> 02:02:03,482
- judging by what they're paying for him.
- [chuckles]

1569
02:02:03,566 --> 02:02:06,856
- What'd he do?
- Oh, I don't know. Does it matter?

1570
02:02:07,361 --> 02:02:09,991
Just as you said, madame,
there are two kinds of people.

1571
02:02:10,364 --> 02:02:13,204
In our business, they are dead or alive.

1572
02:02:13,534 --> 02:02:15,754
So you will take them alive?

1573
02:02:15,828 --> 02:02:16,908
I didn't say that.

1574
02:02:18,581 --> 02:02:20,881
Neither do I take them alive.

1575
02:02:20,958 --> 02:02:23,838
'Course, it's entirely different business,
and I work alone.

1576
02:02:23,919 --> 02:02:26,959
Yes, well, we're a duo, a tandem, a team.

1577
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:30,050
They're so easily taken
when they're distracted, people are.

1578
02:02:30,134 --> 02:02:33,554
So, I'm the distractor
with a little story,

1579
02:02:33,637 --> 02:02:36,177
a little conversation, a song, a sparkle.

1580
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:39,351
And Clarence does the thumping
while their attention is on me.

1581
02:02:39,435 --> 02:02:41,015
[Clarence] He's very good, this one.

1582
02:02:41,103 --> 02:02:42,903
- You should see him.
- No, he's good.

1583
02:02:43,773 --> 02:02:44,983
I can thump.

1584
02:02:45,399 --> 02:02:47,529
[man] Mr. Thorpe up there, a typical case.

1585
02:02:47,818 --> 02:02:50,738
I told him the story
of the Midnight Caller.

1586
02:02:59,705 --> 02:03:02,115
[whispers] "Someone is outside, knocking."

1587
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:04,958
"No, don't open it, mother.

1588
02:03:05,503 --> 02:03:07,923
What living thing
could be out in such a storm?"

1589
02:03:10,216 --> 02:03:11,506
You know the story,

1590
02:03:11,634 --> 02:03:15,434
but people can't get enough of them,
like little children.

1591
02:03:16,472 --> 02:03:19,772
Because, well, they connect the stories
to themselves, I suppose,

1592
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:21,640
and we all love hearing about ourselves,

1593
02:03:21,727 --> 02:03:26,517
so long as the people in the stories
are us, but not us.

1594
02:03:26,607 --> 02:03:28,357
Not us in the end, especially.

1595
02:03:29,193 --> 02:03:31,243
The Midnight Caller gets him...

1596
02:03:31,987 --> 02:03:32,947
never me.

1597
02:03:33,781 --> 02:03:35,071
I'll live forever.

1598
02:03:38,869 --> 02:03:39,949
I must say...

1599
02:03:41,163 --> 02:03:45,383
it's always interesting watching them
after Clarence has worked his art,

1600
02:03:45,459 --> 02:03:46,919
watching them negotiate...

1601
02:03:48,045 --> 02:03:49,085
the passage.

1602
02:03:51,006 --> 02:03:51,876
Passage?

1603
02:03:53,717 --> 02:03:54,757
From here to there.

1604
02:03:55,511 --> 02:03:57,471
To the other side. Watching them...

1605
02:03:58,389 --> 02:04:01,349
try to make sense of it
as they pass to that other place...

1606
02:04:03,519 --> 02:04:06,809
I do like looking into their eyes
as they try to make sense of it.

1607
02:04:09,525 --> 02:04:10,395
I do.

1608
02:04:11,986 --> 02:04:12,896
I do.

1609
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:17,370
[trapper] Try to make sense of what?

1610
02:04:18,159 --> 02:04:18,989
All of it.

1611
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:23,996
[woman] And do they ever...

1612
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:27,127
succeed?

1613
02:04:32,006 --> 02:04:33,046
How would I know?

1614
02:04:33,507 --> 02:04:34,587
I'm only watching.

1615
02:04:34,675 --> 02:04:38,255
- [coachman] Whoa!
- [horses whinnying]

1616
02:04:38,345 --> 02:04:40,845
Well, Fort Morgan.

1617
02:04:40,931 --> 02:04:43,851
I presume we're all staying at the hotel?

1618
02:04:43,934 --> 02:04:47,444
Including Mr. Thorpe.
Too late to drop him with the sheriff.

1619
02:04:52,902 --> 02:04:55,912
I suppose Mr. Thorpe will stay
in your room, Clarence.

1620
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:59,280
- Don't fancy much having him in mine.
- Whatever you say, boss.

1621
02:04:59,825 --> 02:05:01,485
Or we could sit him up in the parlor.

1622
02:05:01,911 --> 02:05:03,791
Little surprise for the guests
in the morning.

1623
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:06,251
Give him a newspaper, sir,
and a glass of port.

1624
02:05:06,832 --> 02:05:07,792
[chuckling]

1625
02:05:08,167 --> 02:05:10,747
- [both grunting]
- Oof!

1626
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:14,297
- You clumsy fool!
- Sorry, sir.

1627
02:05:14,381 --> 02:05:16,631
Don't apologize to me.
It's Mr. Thorpe, isn't it?

1628
02:05:17,259 --> 02:05:18,719
[Clarence] Sorry, Mr. Thorpe.

1629
02:05:22,181 --> 02:05:23,221
Joking aside...

1630
02:05:23,682 --> 02:05:25,022
your room, I think, Clarence.

1631
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:27,350
[Clarence]
Whatever you say, sir. If you say so.

1632
02:05:27,436 --> 02:05:28,896
No worries about him snoring.

1633
02:05:28,979 --> 02:05:31,269
- [Clarence] I'm not worried, boss.
- You never worry.

1634
02:05:31,357 --> 02:05:33,607
- One of your virtues.
- [Clarence] Thanks very much.

1635
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:36,651
[grunts] There we go.

1636
02:05:37,696 --> 02:05:38,566
[door shuts]

1637
02:05:49,416 --> 02:05:51,456
- Go ahead on.
- Oh, après vous.

1638
02:05:59,343 --> 02:06:00,553
Ladies first.

1639
02:06:03,013 --> 02:06:04,563
I must be helped down.

1640
02:06:08,435 --> 02:06:09,515
[René clears throat]

1641
02:07:00,613 --> 02:07:03,373
Will someone open the door for a lady?

1642
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,040
Dr. Betjeman is waiting.

1643
02:07:24,261 --> 02:07:25,221
Step.

1644
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,140
Step.

1645
02:07:27,890 --> 02:07:28,890
Step.

1646
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:30,597
Step.

1647
02:07:31,602 --> 02:07:32,482
Step.

1648
02:07:33,145 --> 02:07:34,055
Step.

1649
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:35,650
Step.

1650
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:37,360
Step.

1651
02:07:37,441 --> 02:07:38,281
[coachman] Yah!

1652
02:07:38,817 --> 02:07:39,687
[man] Step.

1653
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:41,778
[coachman] Yah! Yah!

1654
02:07:49,328 --> 02:07:50,408
Yah! Yah!

1655
02:07:53,582 --> 02:07:55,252
Yah! Hiyah!

1656
02:08:00,589 --> 02:08:02,719
[coach sounds fading]

1657
02:08:35,332 --> 02:08:37,792
[instrumental western theme plays]
