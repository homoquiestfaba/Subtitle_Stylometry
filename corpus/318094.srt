1
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
You will travel far
my little Kal-el

2
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,400
But we will never leave you
even in the face of our death

3
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,100
You'll make my strength
your own

4
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,800
You will see my life through
your eyes

5
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,500
as your life will be seen
through mine

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
The son becomes the father

7
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,000
the father...

8
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,400
the son

9
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,200
In spite of your past...

10
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,900
I know your a good man

11
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,400
and all the good man,
deserves a second chance.

12
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,500
The moment I received
first letter,

13
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,500
I knew you were not
like the rest.

14
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,100
You came from nothing

15
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,000
and you worked so hard
to get what you are

16
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,200
and I have made a
few mistakes

17
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,900
You've said that if I helped you

18
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
get out of the prison

19
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,700
you will take care
of what you have.

20
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,000
You showed me pleasures
they've never known

21
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,600
that's why you deserve
everything.

22
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,900
the rest is mine

23
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,000
We're done

24
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,900
whoa! ohh!
Oh Clark..

25
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,500
Oh my boy...

26
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,000
- Will you get this thing out!?
- Alright

27
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,100
Lex, your friends give me
the creeps

28
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,300
Prison is a creepy place Kitty.

29
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
One needs to make creepy friends
in order to survive.

30
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,800
They are the man with my best talents
as worth less than side of cigarettes

31
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,000
Do you know the story of Metheus?

32
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,200
No, of course you don't.

33
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,700
Metheus was a guy who stole the power
of fire from the other guys

34
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
and gain control of it the essence

35
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,300
He get his technology, he get his power.

36
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,000
So we're stealing fire?

37
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,600
Actually, sort of, you see
whoever controls the technology

38
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,700
controls the world

39
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,500
the Roman Empire ruled the world
because they built roads

40
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,100
the British Empire rule the world
because they built ships

41
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
America, they got bombs,
so on and so forth

42
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,400
Sounds great Lex,
but you're not a god.

43
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,700
Gods are selfish beings
who fly around with little red capes

44
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,700
and don't share their powers
with the mankind

45
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Hey boss, we found something

46
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,500
I don't want to be a God.
I just want to bring fire to the people.

47
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,500
And..
I would be god.

48
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Wow!

49
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,500
Is this His house?

50
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,400
I don't think so,
this is more of a monument

51
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,600
of a long den of extremely
powerful civilization.

52
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,600
This is where they learn who he was

53
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
this is where he came from god.

54
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,900
My son,

55
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,300
You do not remember me,
I am Jor-el

56
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,200
I am your father

57
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,600
By now, I will have been dead
many thousands of your years

58
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,100
(..you are the only survivor
of planet Krypton..)

59
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,300
Embedded with the crystals
before you

60
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Is the total accumulation of all
literature and scientific facts

61
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,600
from dozens of other worlds,
spanning the 28 known galaxies

62
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
In this fortress of solitude

63
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,400
We shall try to find
out the answers... together

64
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,900
Can he see us?

65
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,400
No, he's dead

66
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,700
Kal-el, speak.

67
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,200
Tell me everything,
starting from the crystals

68
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,700
Boy

69
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,300
Don't worry.
They're very much exploited.

70
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:24,000
5 years, if your father was alive
he never would let you go

71
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,600
I almost gave up hope.
I just wanted to see weekend.

72
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,000
Ohh Clark..

73
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,900
Did you find what you're looking for?

74
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,300
- I've thought home might still be better

75
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,600
- your home?

76
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
That place was a great one

77
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,900
But no one's left

78
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,300
Clark, you knew this was a big place.

79
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,100
You don't know who's out there

80
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,500
And even if you are the last,
your not alone.

81
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,000
- Sorry
- Watch out will ya?

82
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,800
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

83
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,100
Sorry

84
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,800
Great, would you be careful?

85
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,500
- Jimmy!
- Mr. Clark!

86
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,600
I mean Kent.
Mr. Kent welcome back.

87
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,700
Oh my god.

88
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Uhm.. uhh.. wait right there,
I'll be right back.

89
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,700
Oh hey, sorry guys.
I, ahh, just looking for a place to live in

90
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,900
If you know anything...

91
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,700
Behind you Mr. Kent

92
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,300
I made it myself

93
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
- It's a cake

94
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,300
Ohh.. Looks...

95
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,800
delicious

96
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
I'm on it chief. Hey look who's back

97
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,500
Hey chief, thank you for
giving my job back

98
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
Don't thank me

99
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,300
It was his time

100
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,500
Let's get you set up, alright?

101
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,400
Uhm.. Ok, so I got to run but
I'll be back to check on you a sec.

102
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Mr. Kent, ok. You know where
you can find me.

103
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
Ohh.. yeah.. He looks just like his mom.

104
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,000
specially when he comes to get into trouble

105
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,200
Lois?

106
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,200
Oh yeah, well I guess you've been gone

107
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,200
It was reported Lois Lane as a mommy.

108
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,900
- Oh, you know, uhm..
i'll just take that

109
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,900
- I'm Sorry
- No, uhm.. she's got wedding.

110
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,900
- Wait, she's married?
- Yes

111
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,800
- No, not really.
It's more like a long engagement.

112
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,700
But don't ask Ms. Lane
because she hates that question.

113
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,300
Are you alright? You look like
you could use a drink.

114
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,700
- This place is so tacky
Why we would be back here?

115
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,600
Kitty, when you were doing your nails
with your fur coats on line

116
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
I was busy unlocking the secrets

117
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,000
of one of those advance civilizations in the universe

118
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,800
Weren't there two of them?

119
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,700
- Sounds like a Hocus Focus to me

120
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,700
More naturally to a primitive mind
and insufficient inadvance technology

121
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,800
would be indistinguished full for magic

122
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,500
full of magic sings
vehicles, weapons, entire continents

123
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,500
all alone.

124
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,300
To think that one could
create a new world

125
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,500
Such as simple like marching

126
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
and it's like a sea monkey

127
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,700
and all it needs is form

128
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,700
Lika a.. sea monkeys

129
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,000
Exactly...

130
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,900
like sea monkeys

131
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,500
Clark, is doing a little soul searching

132
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
for the last couple of years

133
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,200
He's on loans

134
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,900
Yeah? You must be joke
on the bank

135
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,900
I'm coming back?

136
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,100
Yeah, well, you know,

137
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,100
exchange...
i mean of course exchange

138
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,400
but sometimes makes you
can't even think for a change

139
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:03,700
could change...

140
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,100
and Lois, a woman
like her line

141
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,100
better much to
settle down?

142
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,400
You know, if you ask me,
she'll never tell you this

143
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,100
but if you ask me, she's still
in love with you know who

144
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,500
The original station generated
7.5 billion pounds of thrust

145
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,900
just an inital course phrase

146
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,700
but by bringing back
flowing 777

147
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Yes?

148
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,600
If this large uses peverelistic claim

149
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,900
why isn't only being covered
by one news network?

150
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,700
Why don't we say those Christians

151
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,100
would opposed large breathing

152
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,100
- be careful...
- I know

153
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,400
- be careful... careful

154
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,500
Wow, that's really something Lex

155
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,300
Wait for it

156
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,700
Wow, that's really something Lex

157
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,700
It's freakin' gone with the wind

158
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Turn off the camera

159
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,000
I ain't getting it

160
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,400
I said turn off the damn camera

161
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,400
I think there is something wrong

162
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
No, that wasn't you

163
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,200
Ignition to the T minor's 1 minute
from your target seperation

164
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,100
CDR's 12 o' clock
3 minutes in counting

165
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,500
Roger!

166
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,400
- Houston, do you copy?

167
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
- Houston, do you copy?

168
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
Oh my god!

169
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,100
What the..?

170
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,700
Please, there's nothing to worry about

171
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,600
It seems that we are experiencing
a slight power out

172
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,900
- Loading to 40,00 feet
- Roger! 40,000 feet

173
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,400
Is that it?

174
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,500
I don't think so

175
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Yes sir, I hate to say this

176
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,800
but it looks like we don't have
to screw up the launch

177
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,400
- boarding booster ignition

178
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,300
- Roger, boarding booster ignition

179
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,900
boosters are non-responsive

180
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,700
we're still counting down permission

181
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,100
but Four we have a problem

182
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,200
Go

183
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,800
No such boosters were still
counting down with permission

184
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,200
Flight Four you have 30 seconds

185
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,600
What!?

186
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,200
Please be covered, we can't
shutdown the boosters

187
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
we can still be able to manage
to launch and recover

188
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,000
to the emergency field

189
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,100
Launch

190
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,200
The object is non responsive

191
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,800
Don't be alarmed, it's
absolutely normal

192
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,400
Over ride is non responsive

193
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,500
Alright, over ride is non responsive

194
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,100
And if you were lucky, you may
hear with your faint was so improved

195
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,400
I could use a little help

196
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,300
I should use...

197
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,300
Insert your boost ignition
in 5 seconds

198
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
What the hell is that?

199
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,100
There's some kind of unidentified
coming from the North

200
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:08,900
Roger that

201
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,500
and it's coming fast

202
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,900
Is everyone alright?

203
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,600
Are you ok?

204
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,400
Well, I hope this experienced hasn't
put you off from flying

205
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,100
Stastically speaking, it's still
the safest way to travel

206
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:30,800
Ok everybody

207
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,900
listen up

208
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,800
I wanna know it all,
everything,

209
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,400
also, I wanna see photos of him
everywhere

210
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,100
No, I want V photos

211
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,600
Sports, how to get that plane
out of the stadium

212
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,400
Travel, where'd he go?
Is it a vacation? If so, where?

213
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,100
Gossip, does he met somebody

214
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,900
Fashion, he's got a new suit

215
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,600
Ahh.. Health, has he gain weight

216
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,700
Physics, how is this little affair to stop

217
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,200
Longer, shorter..

218
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,400
Politics, does he still stands for truth

219
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,000
Justice

220
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,500
All that stuff

221
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:03,400
Life style, Superman returns

222
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,300
Come on!

223
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,900
What's the use of it?

224
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
This mysterious electro-magnetic
pulse knocked out

225
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,100
portable devices in entire power
grants cause may have

226
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,400
destructive event during
the highly...

227
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,800
- Lois,
- Yes?

228
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,100
In my office

229
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,800
This goes to everyone,

230
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,800
.. it's Superman!

231
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,100
The story is VMP chief,
every electronic device

232
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,600
in the East Coast Store

233
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:44,500
- Do you get it?
- Yes

234
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,900
Lois, three things sold on paper
tragedy, sex, sensible

235
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:49,300
People are sick of tragedy

236
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,900
You know you can't write
when you gain about sex

237
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,200
- Are you alright?
- Yeah -Sure?

238
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,700
Hi!

239
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,700
Hello!

240
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,100
Who are you?

241
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
I'm Clark Kent

242
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,100
and I'm a friend of your mom's

243
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,100
Really? She never make
shirk to you

244
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,300
Really? Never?

245
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,400
No

246
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,200
Jason, come near me.

247
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,000
Daddy's office is boring

248
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,300
Daddy's office is boring!?

249
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,000
Clark, hey, welcome back!

250
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Yeah, we were just talking

251
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,700
- Did you take your vitamins?
- Yes

252
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:50,700
- Eyedrops?
- Yes

253
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,600
- I'll be wrong?
- Yes

254
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,900
All like wise

255
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,900
He's a little fragile

256
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,100
but he's gonna grow up
big and strong

257
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,100
just like his father, yes?
- Yes

258
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,600
- Oh, I saw you on the...
Oh yeah, that was nothing

259
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,500
- Can I have your stapler?
- Oh yeah

260
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,500
Thanks

261
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,800
Congratulations, you look best,
incredible

262
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,200
Yeah, can you believe it?

263
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,200
So, how about your trip?
where'd you do, what you see,

264
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,200
anyone special?

265
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,300
There's so much where
to begin

266
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,300
How's my little guy?

267
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,800
Kiddo, how are you?

268
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,700
- Please?
- Again?

269
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,400
- Again
- Again

270
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Oh, this is Clark

271
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,600
Clark, Richard.
Richard, Clark

272
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:51,600
- Richard White
- Hi!

273
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,700
Clark is... well, is Clark

274
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,100
Well, it's great to finally meet you,
I heard so much

275
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,000
Oh, you have?

276
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,400
Oh yeah, Jimmiy's won't
shut up about you

277
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,100
- Better run
- Where?

278
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,200
You heard Perry

279
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,400
Superman's back, and he thinks
I'm the only one equipped to

280
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,600
So what?

281
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,000
i don't know

282
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm not

283
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Quite a power punch to check
out the black out

284
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,900
- Goodbye Mom!
- Bye!

285
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,900
And she's gone

286
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,100
I'm so proud I met you

287
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,100
Oh he's cute!

288
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,000
- Running to trouble
- Just to see the other guy

289
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,200
What are we going to do?

290
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,400
Ah Lois?

291
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,500
Hey Clark, how was it
coming back to work?

292
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,700
Well, I'm good,
I hope

293
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,100
Yeah, you know.. uhm..
Never mind

294
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,600
But I was wondering

295
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,100
Since I've got back and have a really
hard chance to catch up with

296
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,600
Maybe you like, you
could go grab some...

297
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,200
Wait I met someone,

298
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,500
It sounds like you were from
totally different worlds

299
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,100
We just have a strong connection
that you knew you were

300
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:32,900
destined to be with each other

301
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Then he just takes off,
without explaining why

302
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,100
or why he didn't say goodbye

303
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,600
Sounds silly enough

304
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,600
Well maybe this Clark didn't
say goodbye

305
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Because he had to know it

306
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,600
I wanted to say goodbye

307
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,100
but maybe it was difficult one

308
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:50,700
Difficult?

309
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
What so difficult about it? Bye!

310
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,400
Easy

311
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,600
What's the matter about saying goodbye?

312
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,400
What were we talking about?

313
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,100
Taxi! Hey!

314
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,700
Taxi!

315
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,900
Wow! Thanks!

316
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,600
Goodnight Clark

317
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,000
I think you've been acting a
little different lately

318
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:22,600
Have I?

319
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,800
You know those

320
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,300
article you wrote...

321
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,800
"Why the world doesn't need Superman"?

322
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,300
No, no, no.. no

323
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:34,000
the other one

324
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,500
Was he were,
before we met?

325
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,700
Richard, come on. It was a
title of an interview

326
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,400
Plus it was your Uncle Perrie's idea

327
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,100
No, no, no, I know..
It's ok.. It's ok

328
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,500
Richard, It's a long time ago

329
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Were you in love with him?

330
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,600
He's Superman, everyone's
in love with him

331
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:09,800
So were you

332
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,700
Even though you've been
as a human being

333
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,200
They can be a great people, Kal-el
they wish to be

334
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,800
They only lack the light
to show the way

335
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,800
This reason, above all

336
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,500
Their capacity for good,
I've sent in you

337
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
My only son..

338
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,000
Hold the gun

339
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,200
Holy shit!

340
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,800
Roosevelt, could use
a little privacy

341
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,000
Are you alright miss?

342
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,600
My heart

343
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,000
Please

344
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,700
Just hold on tight

345
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,500
Bingo!

346
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,500
What did you do?

347
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,300
I didn't do anything

348
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Call me Katherine

349
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,300
Katherine

350
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,200
Do you have places to go,
people to save?

351
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Yes

352
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,500
Do you like a tea or cup
of coffee somtime?

353
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,800
I know that's full when
their out for a drink

354
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,200
- Goodnight Katherine!
- Goodnight!

355
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,000
Hey Kent!
He wants to see you

356
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,800
Oh thank you!

357
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,300
Kent, go will ya?

358
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:21,400
These are a comic that were taken
by a 12-year old in camera

359
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,800
Look in a sky chief,

360
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,300
- It's a bird -It's a plane
- No, it's...

361
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,900
You wanted to see me?

362
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,400
Yeah Kent, come on in.
Seat down.

363
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,400
I want to talk a little story of you

364
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,800
Ok, first of all,

365
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,200
Lois, I don't understand what
your doing sneaking around

366
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,600
covering this light

367
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,000
It wasn't just a black out chief

368
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,900
cellphones, pagers.. airplanes

369
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,600
Any other paper in this town
has got a female reporter,

370
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,400
a good looking female reporter

371
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
stashed on a roof
covering Superman?

372
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,100
and you two are the ones
who pay the streets

373
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,900
Chief, I've done Superman

374
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,200
I've covered him!
You know what i mean

375
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,300
But there are dozen other
stories out there

376
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:06,100
Name one

377
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,000
Well, there was a museum
robbery last night

378
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,000
Even Superman missed that one

379
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,700
Why don't you guys track
down Lex Luther?

380
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,500
maybe he's got something to say

381
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,300
Let's see yesterday's news

382
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,300
You know, I like that idea

383
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,900
Perry, Lex Luthor is a career criminal
that nearly killed him for got sex

384
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,200
Jimmy, how did Lex Luthor
get out of the prison?

385
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,000
When his appeals came up,
they called Superman as witness,

386
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,100
and he never showed.

387
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,500
I wonder how pissed that
must take Superman?

388
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:43,900
A lot..

389
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,200
...a lot

390
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,400
give him to Polly

391
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,900
- Lois, Superman
- But what about the...

392
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,300
- James, blackout

393
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,000
Great, thanks chief

394
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,900
Lois, I'm sorry

395
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,600
I hated to stay on this kind
of relationship

396
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,100
Relationship?

397
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,600
- Hi mommy!
- Hi you...

398
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,200
Hey guys

399
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,600
You got an A on Science

400
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,000
It's something right?

401
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,300
Perry, he shot Superman
back into my life

402
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:41,500
Ok, how about this

403
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,600
we'll stay late,we get dinner

404
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,900
I will help you on Superman

405
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,500
You and Clark work
for blackout

406
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:47,500
together

407
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,700
alright for you Clark?

408
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:50,300
Just well..

409
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,200
I was not pretend!

410
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,300
No breaks for hours..

411
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,800
You did it like we turned about

412
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:24,700
you didn't actually
have to cut them!

413
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:29,000
A man can always tell that
woman's pretending

414
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,200
especially Superman

415
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,200
Mmh.. mmh.. mmh.. mhh..

416
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,500
So did you get your rock?

417
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,900
I did

418
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,300
Weird, seem sounds you're right

419
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:42,300
the blackout spreads from
a specific origin light

420
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,100
Where?

421
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:44,800
I'm not sure yet

422
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,700
So with super hearing,
you can hear each sound by itself

423
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:50,300
all at once?

424
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,500
125lbs., faster than speeding bullet,
draws his power from the sun

425
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,900
Invulnerable to any from the kryptonite,
and he never was

426
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,700
Krypton?

427
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,700
Radio active pieces of the world,
It's deadly

428
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,900
The end

429
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,000
Jimmy, Jason

430
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,100
Let's go get a piece on treck
of corn or something

431
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,400
- Keep it goin' ok?
- Oh yes!

432
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,800
So, do you found a place
to live yet?

433
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,900
Uh, no, I'm still looking

434
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,000
You know, Lois, I've
wanted to ask you about...

435
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:06,700
Great!

436
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,000
Thanks

437
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,300
Let's talk when I get back

438
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,300
Sure

439
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:34,400
Sorry if I may be disturbing

440
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:35,500
No, fine, really

441
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:40,500
Just wasn't expecting.. you

442
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:44,800
So the press wouldn't claim that it
wasn't you, the best in press conference

443
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,600
It's only fair that I answered
most people

444
01:09:58,900 --> 01:09:59,700
So..

445
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:01,900
You're here for an interview?

446
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,500
Ok then..

447
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:10,300
Right pocket

448
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,100
Let's start with the big question,
where'd you go?

449
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:21,300
To Krypton

450
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,200
You told me it was destroyed
ages ago

451
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:25,400
It was..

452
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,900
But when the astronomers
started to find it

453
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,200
I had to see it for myself

454
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:36,900
Oh your back

455
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,500
and everyone seems to be
pretty happy about it

456
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,000
Everyone?

457
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,100
I've read the articles, Lois

458
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,000
Yeah, so did a lot of people, Tomorrow
night, they're giving me the Pulitzer

459
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:50,500
Why did you write it?

460
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:54,500
How could you leave us like that?

461
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,200
I moved on. So did the rest of us.
That's why I wrote it

462
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:05,100
The world doesn't need a savior.
And Neither do I.

463
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:25,200
Lois, will you come with me?

464
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,100
Why?

465
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:31,600
There's something
I wanna show you

466
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,400
Please

467
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,700
I can't be gone long

468
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,900
You won't be

469
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,000
Clark told me the reason why
he left without saying goodbye

470
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:12,400
because it was too
inbareable for you

471
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:15,200
personally I think that's a little crap

472
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,300
Clark?

473
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,200
Just a guy with me

474
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,600
Maybe it's right

475
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,000
You know when I'm..

476
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,700
with you.. takes me all the time

477
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:35,700
Not like this
