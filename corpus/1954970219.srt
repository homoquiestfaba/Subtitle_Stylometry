1
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,721
- What's up?
- I'm looking for Giovanni?

2
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:40,438
- Where's Giovanni?
- Over there. He's expecting you.

3
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:49,005
It should appear any minute no.
Come.

4
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:56,760
It's the only one of the seven islands
darker than the night.

5
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:10,122
I wouldn't miss it for anything.

6
00:02:12,407 --> 00:02:13,840
Can you see it? There!

7
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:24,000
- Ginostra.
- It's the Sciarra del Fuoco.

8
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:27,645
The last eruption
was 600 years back.

9
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:34,404
If you come from the south part,
it looks like a pregnant woman,

10
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:39,039
but from the north, it looks like
an old man ith a long beard.

11
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:48,964
600 years, that's young,
for a volcano anyway.

12
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:15,841
The first two months,
he lost the use of his legs.

13
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:20,599
The X-rays showed nothing organic.
It as the trauma.

14
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,843
- And now?
- He's fine.

15
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,558
He spends his days here.

16
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,119
How about his mental condition?

17
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:32,926
He's a very secretive child.
That's him.

18
00:04:42,727 --> 00:04:45,525
He speaks English.
His father taught him.

19
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:49,123
Ettore, you have visitors.
Get up.

20
00:04:58,287 --> 00:04:59,879
I'm Matt Benson.

21
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:10,275
Come and get dressed. Excuse us,
we'll be right back. Let's go.

22
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,518
I prefer to question the boy
in my house.

23
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,359
I want to start tomorrow.

24
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:29,957
We ask Rome,
but we decide in Lipari.

25
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:33,597
Sicilians are a polite,
but proud people.

26
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,083
My wife prepared this for you.

27
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,881
It's mozzarella,
tomato and prosciutto.

28
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:06,796
- Is it mozzarella di buffa?
- Yes, I think it is.

29
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,125
It's not buffa.

30
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:29,880
Stop the car!

31
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,366
I'm gonna be sick.

32
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:00,602
You okay?

33
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:05,765
Yes. We can go.

34
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:26,605
Let's see. Milk, coffee, cereal.

35
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,760
- These should last a few days.
- One more trip and it's done.

36
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:35,443
- Do you want me to help you?
- No, thank you, it's okay.

37
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:46,116
Did you sleep well?
Don't just stand there, come help.

38
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:50,520
I found peanut butter.
It's amazing, in this tiny store.

39
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:53,326
Tina would have killed me
if I hadn't found it.

40
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,445
Paola, where is the phone?

41
00:07:58,527 --> 00:08:00,882
Ah, I found it.
Hello?

42
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:04,643
Mom, hi.
Can you hold on a second?

43
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:10,282
Ettore, go down to the cove
and try this out.

44
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:14,118
I got you twelve gauges,
I hope it's okay.

45
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:18,196
No, mom, they're hooks for fishing.
I was talking to Ettore,

46
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,598
the boy that Matt's working with,
he's going to be staying here.

47
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,725
This island is the end of the world!
There's no water.

48
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:28,436
They bring all the water by boat.
I just bought 200 bottles.

49
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:32,486
Can I call you back mom,
I'm really busy? I love you.

50
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:39,242
So the lady is letting you have
half of the house?

51
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:42,440
- Is everything okay?
- Just one more bag.

52
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:45,167
Do you mind hiding the bike?
I don't want Tina to see it.

53
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,238
- I'll give it to her when Matt comes.
- Okay.

54
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,762
She's going to love it. Thank you.

55
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,756
What's going on?

56
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:14,202
Excuse us. Let me speak.

57
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,526
Sorry.

58
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,078
- You all okay?
- We must go no.

59
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:21,920
Thank you for your help.
We live at Santa Ginostra,

60
00:11:22,087 --> 00:11:25,238
you can come and visit us
on Sundays and Thursdays.

61
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,440
You'll be welcome.

62
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,875
Thank you. I will.

63
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,600
Ettore,

64
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:57,925
grab a chair.

65
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:00,606
For what?

66
00:12:01,807 --> 00:12:03,286
We're going to ork.

67
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:15,646
- Why not inside?
- Inside is my home.

68
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:19,595
This is our office. Over here.

69
00:12:25,527 --> 00:12:27,165
Come here.

70
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,525
In front of Ginostra.

71
00:12:37,287 --> 00:12:38,800
Ho do you like it here?

72
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,681
No problem?
My wife, my daughter?

73
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:46,126
No.

74
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:50,965
Here, take a look.

75
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:54,916
What is it?

76
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,403
- Smell.
- I don't know.

77
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:01,157
- Coke?
- It's not a game, come on.

78
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:04,920
I'm not a dog.

79
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:09,323
- Doesn't it ring any bells?
- I don't know what it is, okay?

80
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:13,442
It's Semtex.

81
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,877
Joe Manzella used this
to kill your family.

82
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:24,197
Ho often did your dad
go to New York?

83
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:27,560
- Leave my dad out of this.
- Twice a month on average.

84
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,559
I have his passport here.

85
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:31,960
You can have it.

86
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,684
All I can do is put Joe Manzella
and his buddies away for a while.

87
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,077
That's not enough for me.

88
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,884
- You knew your dad was Cosa Nostra?
- No he wasn't. Never!

89
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,642
He as the personal chef
of Frank and Joe Manzella.

90
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:06,367
The mafia bosses of Ginostra.

91
00:14:06,527 --> 00:14:10,759
When Frank was forced to move
to New York, he sent for your father

92
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,919
twice a month, to cook for him
and his family. They were real close.

93
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,998
They were like
your family too, right?

94
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:20,326
Mister, I am eleven years old,

95
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,802
you asked me about my father.

96
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:28,236
I loved him,
he loved me, and he's dead.

97
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:44,483
Ettore, come up here.

98
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,516
What are you doing here?
I can't take my eyes off you.

99
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,804
You don't like the fish?

100
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,361
This fish is up against
some merciless critic.

101
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,239
Ettore's dad
was one of the best local chefs.

102
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:02,526
Paola is a wonderful cook as well.

103
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,521
- Yeah but his fish had...
- Fennel instead of lemon!

104
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:08,803
I used hat I had.

105
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,320
So, how long
are you going to stay?

106
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:20,196
One week. Tina has to start school
on the twelfth.

107
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:24,879
In one week, you'll have time
to see every beautiful sight.

108
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,925
And no matter
how long you stay,

109
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:31,442
you won't have time
to see all the ugly ones.

110
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:37,722
Well, we'll be back
in three months, for Christmas.

111
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,640
Four months.
Too long away from your husband.

112
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:46,602
I am planning a long week-end
in New York, next month.

113
00:15:50,967 --> 00:15:54,004
I'm trying to learn
all the names of the volcanoes.

114
00:15:54,767 --> 00:15:56,519
I know there's Lipari,

115
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:00,161
and Vulcano, and...

116
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,477
- Allicudi...
- Allicudi.

117
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,445
- Your turn.
- No, your turn.

118
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:07,563
She's allergic to volcanoes.

119
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:10,236
Are you afraid?

120
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:14,801
No, more like impatient.

121
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:18,720
Wondering everyday
if it's going to erupt,

122
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:23,486
when we know we have one chance
in a million to see it wake up.

123
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:28,482
It's like having a ticket for a show
that may never open.

124
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:30,160
Isn't that better?

125
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:33,122
Actually,
I would like to see it blow up.

126
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:38,962
No, here boredom
catches up with you

127
00:16:40,007 --> 00:16:41,838
and it won't let go.

128
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:44,478
It grows on you.

129
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:48,076
Enough!

130
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:52,436
He loves this country
more than I do.

131
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,005
And maybe
more than he loves me.

132
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:59,365
- What are you talking about?
- I thank volcanoes for one thing.

133
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,722
The "Santa Ginostra".

134
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,404
- Who makes this wine?
- The nuns.

135
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,003
Taste before investigating,
Mr. FBI Man.

136
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,761
In Sicily, do as Sicilians do.

137
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,877
Elena and Giovanni
make quite a pair.

138
00:17:22,327 --> 00:17:26,923
- He was a little pushy.
- That didn't seem to bother you.

139
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:36,276
Tina feels right at home here,
nothing phases her.

140
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,922
She really likes Ettore.

141
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:58,646
I'm sure your work with him
will go fine. Children sense things.

142
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:03,718
Oh, I love this place.

143
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:10,436
- Do you know how owns the house?
- No, I don't.

144
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:14,525
It's going to be too big for you
when we're gone.

145
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,042
I'm glad you've come.

146
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:25,965
We have to be careful
with Tina here.

147
00:18:26,407 --> 00:18:29,638
Giovanni says it goes down 500 feet.

148
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:39,522
You could have died up there.

149
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,999
I took the night ferry
and lost my way.

150
00:20:48,087 --> 00:20:51,079
I thought the convent as higher up.

151
00:20:52,927 --> 00:20:57,682
Santa Ginostra is a sanctuary,
protected from all, even the FBI.

152
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:02,400
I was told anyone could come here
on Thursdays.

153
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:06,446
I'm just an ordinary visitor.
And a neighbor now too.

154
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:09,926
Follow me.

155
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:14,800
- Do you know our wine?
- Yes.

156
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:18,405
- And our perfumes?
- No I don't.

157
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:25,957
We banished Rome's God.

158
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:28,919
We worship the abyss.

159
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:37,402
Sister Chiara.

160
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:43,597
Take this visitor to our shop.
You may find something for your wife.

161
00:21:49,087 --> 00:21:50,406
I'll make you a deal...

162
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,126
as a neighbor.

163
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:34,682
This is where
the flowers are pressed.

164
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:39,039
We mix jasmine, mimosa,
local roses and many others.

165
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,400
Our composition is a...

166
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:45,799
a secret.

167
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,718
Those wild flowers remind us that

168
00:22:50,887 --> 00:22:55,438
before the lava flow, Ginostra
was covered with trees and meadows.

169
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:02,926
Here you are.
The choice is yours.

170
00:24:25,807 --> 00:24:29,686
Tell Joe Manzella
I'm here to get him.

171
00:24:58,167 --> 00:24:59,646
Did you sleep well?

172
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:05,006
- I went back to bed.
- I missed the ferry.

173
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,764
Why didn't you take the helicopter?

174
00:25:15,087 --> 00:25:16,918
It wasn't available.

175
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,762
What are we going to
talk about today?

176
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,038
How about, you.

177
00:25:31,567 --> 00:25:36,038
Why have you brought your family?
It could be dangerous, if I talk.

178
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:42,038
Don't you worry about that.

179
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:30,120
Okay. Paola!

180
00:26:35,407 --> 00:26:37,557
- Paola!
- I'm here.

181
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:44,836
- Look at the shells we found!
- Ah, ho beautiful!

182
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:51,045
His specialties?

183
00:26:52,327 --> 00:26:54,238
I can't talk about it.

184
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:56,636
You can.

185
00:26:57,767 --> 00:26:59,598
I blacked out just after.

186
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:03,520
I don't remember a thing
until the hospital.

187
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,803
Before the explosion.

188
00:27:06,687 --> 00:27:07,722
Tell me.

189
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:13,276
- I'd rather give you names.
- I'm not interested in names now.

190
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:21,437
I didn't think of my mother,

191
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,480
I looked for my father.

192
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:29,038
I heard him shouting,

193
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:33,604
he was shouting to my sisters
to get out.

194
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:38,159
The flames didn't seem
to touch him,

195
00:27:38,887 --> 00:27:41,447
he was holding my sisters
in his arms.

196
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,082
They were like two balls of fire
in his hands.

197
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:47,958
The flames of hell.

198
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,324
Then, all of a sudden,

199
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:57,805
he weakened and fell forward
over the wheel

200
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,717
and that's all I saw.

201
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:05,560
The explosion hurt me, here.

202
00:28:08,447 --> 00:28:10,005
And I blacked out.

203
00:28:13,887 --> 00:28:16,082
What happened that morning?

204
00:28:20,247 --> 00:28:21,396
What?

205
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:25,519
They left me alive
to kill the bastards who did it.

206
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:35,116
Come over here.

207
00:28:41,327 --> 00:28:44,603
What makes you think
Joe Manzella wasn't alone?

208
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:48,396
He is the boss of seven islands.
Everyone works for him.

209
00:28:50,367 --> 00:28:54,804
Did your father ever mention anybody
special, he might have met here

210
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,764
that stands out, maybe someone
outside the Cosa Nostra,

211
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,644
maybe from the police?

212
00:29:03,047 --> 00:29:04,719
Marty Del Piero?

213
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:09,682
No.

214
00:29:13,927 --> 00:29:18,045
Give me some names of the people
who were closest to Manzella.

215
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:21,515
Two names.

216
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:26,836
Beppe Puglisi.
Santo Ragusa.

217
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:34,356
Okay.

218
00:29:34,687 --> 00:29:36,200
That'll be all for today.

219
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:40,200
I'll check them out
with the D.A.

220
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:00,759
Ginostra is the most
beautiful island in the world.

221
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,881
Ettore was born here,
like the Manzellas,

222
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:07,325
and he was a happy child.

223
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:21,000
But the Manzellas forced the people
into silence and submission.

224
00:30:24,607 --> 00:30:25,926
Look, can you see there?

225
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,438
That's Ettore's house.
It's an old mill.

226
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,075
His uncles and cousins live there.

227
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,398
They washed every stone
to purify it,

228
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:39,879
to erase memories of Ettore's father
after he betrayed the Mafia.

229
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:54,279
Now, do you want to fly over
to see the convent on the other side?

230
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,440
No, later.

231
00:30:57,847 --> 00:31:00,998
I have to get to the D.A.
to check out some names.

232
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:20,158
What do you know about me?

233
00:31:20,567 --> 00:31:23,161
Well... your name, your age...

234
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:25,166
Not much.

235
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:28,119
And... the accident.

236
00:31:29,047 --> 00:31:30,480
It wasn't an accident.

237
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:36,725
Doesn't your husband
tell you nothing? Never?

238
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:41,005
About his job? Not really.
Only what you'll tell me.

239
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:55,603
- Why did Matt come here?
- I don't know exactly,

240
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:59,482
- to investigate.
- He came from New York just for me?

241
00:32:00,087 --> 00:32:03,841
Yes, I guess.
Are you impressed?

242
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,521
My dad went to cook in New York
lots of times,

243
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:09,281
but I'm sure
that's not the only reason.

244
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:12,041
Don't you think
you should ask Matt?

245
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,566
I'm going to bed.

246
00:32:14,727 --> 00:32:17,719
I put some blankets in your room
in case it gets cold.

247
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:20,485
Sweet dreams.

248
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:28,397
- Who is it?
- The names you gave me were bullshit.

249
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:29,920
Turn on the light!

250
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,564
Those two guys are doing
two hundred years apiece.

251
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:39,966
And you knew it, didn't you?

252
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:43,919
- If you touch me, I'm gone.
- And you still protect them.

253
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,760
- You can't say that.
- Your mother,

254
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:49,566
your two sisters
and your father...

255
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:52,161
You're hurting me,
you're hurting me on purpose!

256
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:55,319
What are you protecting kid?
What?

257
00:32:55,487 --> 00:32:56,886
- Listen to me.
- Don't' touch me...

258
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:58,924
What are you protecting?

259
00:32:59,087 --> 00:33:03,478
Do you wanna let your mother and
father and your sisters' go this way?

260
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:07,959
Or do you wanna get those people
who took them away?

261
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:13,601
Don't talk to me like that.
I can get people to hurt you.

262
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:17,521
Make up your mind kid because
I'm on a plane back to America.

263
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:21,646
You wanna stop, we stop now,
right fuckin' now!

264
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,806
You're only a kid, I understand.
But now's the time to grow up.

265
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,562
It's too soon for you,
but that's the way it is.

266
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:33,880
You wanna go on
or do you wanna stop?

267
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,085
Let's go on.

268
00:33:38,127 --> 00:33:40,163
Alright.
Now I believe you.

269
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,915
Okay.

270
00:34:04,047 --> 00:34:06,481
She hasn't changed much
since New York.

271
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:11,082
I followed her for two months
while she was with Frank.

272
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:22,956
Manzella.

273
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:24,685
That's his territory.

274
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:35,599
- Why don't you take him?
- Naples is off limits.

275
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:41,042
Okay, let's wait until he gets back
to Ginostra, to get him.

276
00:34:50,007 --> 00:34:52,521
Ettore, here are you?

277
00:34:53,127 --> 00:34:54,765
Here.

278
00:34:55,887 --> 00:35:00,005
Aren't you interested in history?
It's our ancestors!

279
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,805
Nobody is here.

280
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:09,084
Fontanella's closed to the public.
Today, it's all ours.

281
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:14,838
No, the Celts, my ancestors,
came here in the 4th Century AD.

282
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:17,718
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I know that,

283
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:21,243
- you already told me.
- For once, it wasn't in war.

284
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,637
They offered your ancestors,
their Gods in thanks.

285
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:28,676
And that's how come the Celtic Gods
have the bodies of Apollo or Diana.

286
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:31,680
"Lose ten pounds in two weeks",
are you interested?

287
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:34,197
Are you saying I'm a little...

288
00:35:34,367 --> 00:35:37,996
No, it's just that I can
get you tapes, very cheap.

289
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,362
I know a man in Catane
who has hundreds of them.

290
00:35:40,527 --> 00:35:43,360
If you call him, use my name,
Matt doesn't get involved.

291
00:35:43,527 --> 00:35:46,200
I wouldn't expect this
from the son of a great cook.

292
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:50,360
Please don't talk about my father.
My dad and I were like that.

293
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:39,996
I'll put it near the pond.
I'd love to take it to New York.

294
00:36:40,167 --> 00:36:42,317
Maybe I can bring it for you.

295
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:46,159
- Where did it go?
- What?

296
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:50,355
The escort, where are they?
I can't believe it.

297
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,839
Look out! Jessie!

298
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,441
Are you okay?

299
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:04,635
- He wants to kill me.
- Who is he?

300
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:06,638
- Start the car!
- Get down, get down!

301
00:37:07,407 --> 00:37:08,920
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Shut up!

302
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:13,440
It was an accident.
It's a small road!

303
00:37:13,727 --> 00:37:16,719
I'll pay for the car,
I'm sorry, please!

304
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:18,806
Ettore!

305
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:21,926
Ettore!

306
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:26,604
God damn, God damn!
Ettore!

307
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,559
Etorre!

308
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:34,597
Help! Somebody!

309
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:40,521
Help!

310
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:50,722
Jessie,

311
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,203
- I'm here.
- Where did he go?

312
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:54,886
Help me, I'm stuck!

313
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,563
That's it!
You're coming with me.

314
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:05,356
Don't move! Freeze!

315
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,481
Get back.

316
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,755
Drop the knife or I'll shoot.

317
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,556
Drop it!

318
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,245
Get in the pick-up.

319
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,286
Start it.

320
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:26,517
Don't move! I mean it.

321
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,203
Start this fuckin' pick-up!

322
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:35,165
I'll kill you.

323
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,239
I'm not joking.
I'll shoot you.

324
00:38:43,327 --> 00:38:47,366
Get back!
Get back you son of a bitch!

325
00:38:51,607 --> 00:38:52,676
Wait.

326
00:39:02,367 --> 00:39:03,846
Give me the gun.

327
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,727
- Yeah?
- What the fuck's going on?

328
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:51,919
The escort left them at Rapallo.

329
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:56,157
- Ten minutes from the villa!
- I don't know. I'll check it out.

330
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,079
<i>If you guys
can't guarantee our security,</i>

331
00:39:58,247 --> 00:40:01,205
I'm gonna ask the FBI
to get us back to the States,

332
00:40:03,207 --> 00:40:05,323
Shit, Shit!

333
00:40:05,727 --> 00:40:08,446
<i>I've got my wife and kid here!</i>

334
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:11,198
It won't happen again!

335
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,437
I'll get you more cars
in front of the house.

336
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:20,998
But Jessie should not go out
too much, especially with the kid.

337
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:32,486
Calm down. I'll take care of this.
It won't happen again, okay?

338
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,763
Okay keep me posted.

339
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:46,601
Why didn't you tell him
about the pick-up?

340
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:49,600
Our security is his concern,

341
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:51,837
the pick-up's ours.

342
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:57,596
I swear that man
wanted to hurt Ettore.

343
00:41:00,287 --> 00:41:02,642
Look, the perfume from Santa Ginostra.

344
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,245
Excuse me. I rang.

345
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:40,001
Oh, I couldn't hear you,
because of the waves.

346
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:41,202
Okay.

347
00:42:42,087 --> 00:42:45,079
- Is Matt home?
- No, he'll be back at five.

348
00:42:45,247 --> 00:42:47,966
If you can wait
I'll get you a drink on the terrace.

349
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:50,402
- Sure, okay.
- It's up here.

350
00:42:50,767 --> 00:42:52,200
Thanks.

351
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,085
I'll be right back.

352
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,523
- What does Manzella want now?
- He was with a colleague.

353
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:41,961
Why he does come here?

354
00:44:32,447 --> 00:44:33,766
Hello!

355
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,720
It looks better like this.

356
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:07,757
- And I can see her from my bed.
- Thanks for bringing her back to me.

357
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:12,201
It's her all right.
I'd recognize her anyhere.

358
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:15,599
I'm staying longer.

359
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,080
I called the office, and they said
I could stay another week.

360
00:46:23,207 --> 00:46:25,437
You don't look happy.

361
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:30,078
I am, but Giovanni
will never agree to it.

362
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:33,239
It makes things
much more complicated for him.

363
00:46:33,887 --> 00:46:37,038
- He said it wasn't a problem.
- And Tina, she has to give...

364
00:46:37,207 --> 00:46:41,837
- You called Giovanni?
- He came by this afternoon.

365
00:46:42,247 --> 00:46:47,037
- Why didn't you tell me.
- I forgot. Look at her face,

366
00:46:47,447 --> 00:46:49,881
- What did he want?
- it's so serene.

367
00:46:51,407 --> 00:46:53,398
So we can go back
on the eleventh.

368
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:57,765
That's plenty of time for me
to get things for Tina for school.

369
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:02,324
Be happy I'm staying.

370
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,560
Come on, please.

371
00:47:14,407 --> 00:47:16,921
I don't want to see those bastards.

372
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:20,602
- They're your family.
- I have no family.

373
00:47:21,927 --> 00:47:24,600
Well, seems you have to.

374
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:29,204
The court allows them one visit
every four months. It's the law.

375
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:30,686
Whose law?

376
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:34,157
They disowned my father.
They didn't even come to his funeral.

377
00:47:34,327 --> 00:47:38,320
They took my house.
What do you want? They're bastards.

378
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:43,847
I'll take care of them.
It'll go quickly.

379
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:47,556
You can just come in
for five minutes, and it'll be over.

380
00:47:48,687 --> 00:47:51,247
It'll be okay, I promise.
Come on.

381
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:55,923
Uncle Gino's already killed,
and not only once.

382
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:01,605
I'll go in first.

383
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,963
You can leave us, thank you.

384
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:08,846
- How nice meet you.
- Hi, I'm Jessie.

385
00:48:09,007 --> 00:48:11,805
Here is my family.
Rosa,

386
00:48:11,967 --> 00:48:13,195
- Nice to meet you.
- Maria,

387
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:17,644
- Bambini,
- Vicenzo, her husband.

388
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:21,243
- Rosa speak very well English.
- Oh good.

389
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:23,716
Matt's gone to get Ettore.
Please, come in.

390
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:27,880
- Fine. How is Ettore?
- Ettore is fine, thank you.

391
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:32,686
Please have a seat.

392
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:44,006
Stefano was my baby brother.

393
00:48:51,247 --> 00:48:53,920
Yes a tragedy.
My baby bother.

394
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:55,361
I'm sorry.

395
00:48:57,247 --> 00:49:00,239
We haven't seen Ettore
in four months. How is he?

396
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:03,285
He plays a lot, outside...

397
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:10,083
- I hope he's not too difficult.
- Oh no, not at all,

398
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:12,317
he's a lovely boy, I adore him,

399
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:15,763
he's very strong, very courageous.

400
00:49:16,807 --> 00:49:17,796
Courageous?

401
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:29,122
He is saying he is worried
about Ettore's courage.

402
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:43,557
We loves Ettore.
We love Ettore very much.

403
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,564
Oh, here they are.

404
00:49:49,007 --> 00:49:51,396
- Matt Benson?
- Mr. Greco. How are you?

405
00:49:51,567 --> 00:49:54,445
- My family.
- Vincenzo.

406
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:08,121
Ettore, would you like to go to
the kitchen and get them a drink?

407
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:11,518
There's orange juice in the fridge
for the children.

408
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:41,080
It has been very difficult for him.
He hates everybody.

409
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,198
He wants everybody to pay.

410
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:46,835
This family visit
has been allowed by the court,

411
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:51,197
under condition Ettore suffers
no pressures of any kind,

412
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:53,835
no threats and no intimidation.

413
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:58,125
He is here under my protection
and my responsibility.

414
00:50:58,287 --> 00:51:01,165
If I see any coercion,
I will ask you to leave

415
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:04,326
and no further visit
will be allowed.

416
00:52:24,327 --> 00:52:25,919
Matt!

417
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:50,719
<i>I repeat. We cannot land.</i>

418
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:53,640
<i>We must hurry.
There are too many. We'll go back.</i>

419
00:53:13,647 --> 00:53:17,401
<i>We are in position.
We await instructions. Over.</i>

420
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,922
<i>Benson? Benson?
What's your position?</i>

421
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:36,679
Matt, do you read me?

422
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,436
Matt, do you read me?

423
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:42,077
<i>Alpha 43. We're in position.</i>

424
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:43,441
- We must go no.
- Wait.

425
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:44,676
<i>Matt, where are you?</i>

426
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:55,362
Okay.

427
00:53:55,847 --> 00:53:57,326
What the fuck are you doing?

428
00:53:57,687 --> 00:54:00,076
- Giovanni, we're coming.
- It's too late.

429
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:23,486
Go, go, go!

430
00:54:36,927 --> 00:54:39,122
Matt, it's too late,
he's getting away!

431
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:17,804
Giovanni, we're here.

432
00:55:24,007 --> 00:55:26,077
<i>Manzella has escaped.</i>

433
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:29,355
<i>...in Sicily.</i>

434
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:34,323
<i>In the last fifteen years,
I have worked as a cook</i>

435
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:36,678
<i>for Joey and Frank Manzella,</i>

436
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,522
<i>in their houses
in Ginostra and Brooklyn.</i>

437
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:46,723
<i>I have witnessed many dealings
of the Cosa Nostra</i>

438
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:51,597
<i>and I request to be put
in the Witness Protection Program.</i>

439
00:56:56,407 --> 00:57:00,639
<i>Before I agree to testify, I demand
that my family be protected</i>

440
00:57:01,127 --> 00:57:03,197
<i>and brought to America.</i>

441
00:57:03,367 --> 00:57:08,077
<i>I entrust the safety of my family
to Matt Benson of the FBI.</i>

442
00:57:09,447 --> 00:57:13,565
<i>The commitment to the truth
is a brave decision, Mr. Greco.</i>

443
00:57:16,127 --> 00:57:20,405
<i>But what guarantee do I have
that my family will be safe?</i>

444
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:25,117
Elena warned us, it's easy
to fall in love with Santa Ginostra.

445
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:27,755
<i>I'm the agent
in charge of your case.</i>

446
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:30,120
What the?

447
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:32,603
<i>You have my word...</i>

448
00:57:32,767 --> 00:57:36,237
- What is it?
- It's a tape I left in.

449
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:50,239
- Put Tina to bed, I'll be right up.
- I'll help. I'm not ready for bed.

450
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:52,125
I'll clean up,
I'll be up in a minute.

451
00:58:25,367 --> 00:58:26,561
You can't get out.

452
00:58:30,287 --> 00:58:33,279
Give me the keys,
give me the fucking keys!

453
00:58:33,447 --> 00:58:34,846
You lied to me.

454
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:38,884
I'm going to tell you the truth.

455
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:41,762
You said you didn't know
my father.

456
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:46,998
I knew him. He came to see me
in Brooklyn. To talk.

457
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:48,442
What about?

458
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,124
- The Cosa Nostra.
- You're lying!

459
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:55,562
My dad never talked!
You forced him,

460
00:58:55,727 --> 00:58:58,639
you're a fucking cop!
My dad is not a traitor!

461
00:58:59,047 --> 00:59:00,526
Listen to me.

462
00:59:01,527 --> 00:59:05,281
Frank Manzella sent his mistress
to Santa Ginostra

463
00:59:05,447 --> 00:59:07,722
where his brother Joe
could protect her.

464
00:59:07,887 --> 00:59:10,481
But Joe fell in love with the girl.

465
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:15,596
He asked your father
to poison Frank and he refused,

466
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,522
and refusing Joe meant
signing your death warrant.

467
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:23,922
Your father wanted
to take care of his family

468
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:28,239
and the only way he could do it
as to become a federal witness.

469
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:33,603
And in return,
I promised

470
00:59:35,727 --> 00:59:40,437
to protect his family and bring you
all to America to start a new life.

471
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:42,916
And we're all dead!
You killed us!

472
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:46,443
- You're the one who killed us!
- Stop it!

473
00:59:47,847 --> 00:59:49,326
I screwed up.

474
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:51,881
I screwed up.

475
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:56,842
Someone in the justice department
warned Manzella

476
00:59:57,447 --> 01:00:00,359
and your father
became a sitting duck.

477
01:00:01,687 --> 01:00:04,406
I came here to find that bastard
that betrayed me.

478
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:08,806
It's your revenge you're after.
You don't care about me or my family.

479
01:00:08,967 --> 01:00:10,844
I'll bring you Manzella!

480
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:14,201
And you'll help me
find who betrayed me.

481
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:17,480
No! Keep away from me,
you fucking cop!

482
01:00:17,927 --> 01:00:20,395
Hold your voice down!
You'll wake everybody up.

483
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:23,923
I don't care! I'm going to
tell Jessie what's between us.

484
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,520
What are you talking about, kid?

485
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:29,157
That you didn't protect my family?
That you got us killed!

486
01:00:29,647 --> 01:00:32,445
You're scared she'll leave you
if she knew what kind of man you are?

487
01:00:32,607 --> 01:00:35,041
- Maybe I'll just tell her...
- Matt!

488
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:44,360
I don't want my wife to know
anything about this.

489
01:00:44,687 --> 01:00:48,726
I'll tell her what a shit you are!
Let go of me! You're choking me.

490
01:00:50,007 --> 01:00:53,761
Listen to me! Listen to me!

491
01:00:54,807 --> 01:00:58,766
If my wife or anybody
finds about this,

492
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,282
you won't get what you want.

493
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:04,439
You won't get what you want.
Listen to me.

494
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:08,237
I'm the only one here who can
help you get Manzella!

495
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:12,765
I'm the only one!

496
01:01:23,487 --> 01:01:27,480
I'll help you get what you want.
We'll get him.

497
01:01:35,087 --> 01:01:36,520
I promise you.

498
01:01:39,847 --> 01:01:41,246
Go to sleep.

499
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:55,159
- You rang?
- Giovanni is not home?

500
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:57,242
No.

501
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,998
- I was going to number 18.
- Oh. Okay.

502
01:02:02,047 --> 01:02:03,275
Will you come on Sunday?

503
01:02:04,527 --> 01:02:07,724
We're having a party by the islands.

504
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:10,361
Thanks.

505
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:14,476
- Matt. I wanted to tell you...
- Yes?

506
01:02:16,687 --> 01:02:18,245
We can help you.

507
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:42,925
Tischka! Cut it out!

508
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:49,642
Come in.

509
01:02:55,407 --> 01:02:58,240
- Bring the mower back up!
- No!

510
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,637
Who the hell's going to steal it?

511
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:05,916
My wife... Susanna...
for forty years now.

512
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:08,806
- Matt Benson.
- Nice to meet you.

513
01:03:17,447 --> 01:03:19,324
- Here, have a seat.
- Thanks.

514
01:03:22,527 --> 01:03:25,121
Elena told me about you yesterday.

515
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:29,122
- What will you have to drink?
- Same as you.

516
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:31,795
Honey, could you bring us
a couple of whiskeys!

517
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:35,040
So...

518
01:03:36,807 --> 01:03:39,241
You see... Retirement.

519
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:48,124
I met him for the first time...
thirty-five years ago?

520
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,875
- Thirty.
- Thirty. On Malcolm Street.

521
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:54,678
When I was tailing
Giuseppe D'Alba.

522
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,524
Honey, could you leave us?

523
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:14,084
It wasn't me who betrayed you, Matt.
You believe me?

524
01:04:18,247 --> 01:04:21,398
I received your request to protect
Ettore's family,

525
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:25,879
when his father decided to enter
the federal witness program.

526
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:29,637
But you know how slowly
things move here.

527
01:04:30,327 --> 01:04:34,639
Before we could do anything, it had
all blown up in our faces, literally.

528
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,598
Two months later,
I was due for retirement,

529
01:04:38,767 --> 01:04:43,761
I didn't speed up the investigation,
and understand... in Lipari,

530
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:48,560
we already have
too much on our plates.

531
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:59,076
I've lost a son
in this dirty fucking war

532
01:05:00,287 --> 01:05:05,122
and, on his grave,
I tell you it wasn't me.

533
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:09,206
Do you believe me?

534
01:05:12,727 --> 01:05:14,479
Yeah, I believe you.

535
01:05:22,087 --> 01:05:23,406
They love sugar.

536
01:05:25,447 --> 01:05:28,837
You're making a big mistake
having that kid at your house.

537
01:05:33,727 --> 01:05:37,436
You're an American,
an easy prey.

538
01:05:38,527 --> 01:05:42,964
They'll trap you in that den of yours
and choke you on their own soil.

539
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,720
It always rains for re-enactments.

540
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:29,239
They were all against me
coming here.

541
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:33,366
All of them, except Giovanni.

542
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:38,117
I don't know why he's here. He could
have had a great career in New York.

543
01:06:39,527 --> 01:06:44,078
His father as a cop in Gela.
Got killed when Giovanni was eight.

544
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:57,003
It always rains for re-enactments.
This sucks!

545
01:07:01,407 --> 01:07:05,195
I'll have two cops in the car
with you, to play your family.

546
01:07:05,807 --> 01:07:08,480
Don't try to remember
what happened,

547
01:07:09,047 --> 01:07:11,641
just do what comes naturally.

548
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:16,598
- Did you come by my house Saturday?
- Yeah, I wanted to talk to you.

549
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:18,075
What about?

550
01:07:19,647 --> 01:07:21,399
Well, I'll tell you later.

551
01:07:31,407 --> 01:07:34,126
When I give that signal,
send the car okay.

552
01:07:34,287 --> 01:07:37,199
The virgins from Santa Ginostra
aren't here yet.

553
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:42,721
The nuns ere the first to arrive
after the explosion.

554
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,764
Go on, I wanna see the kid.
I'll catch up.

555
01:07:44,927 --> 01:07:48,317
Okay, We'll start without them.
Alright, go!

556
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,559
What is it now?

557
01:08:07,487 --> 01:08:11,639
- Nothing. Close your window.
- It was open. It was sunny that day.

558
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:24,239
<i>Dino, Leonardo,
the boy's cold. What do I do?</i>

559
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:25,920
Is everybody ready?

560
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:27,566
<i>Yes.</i>

561
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:30,322
Okay, start the car moving.

562
01:08:41,247 --> 01:08:43,841
- Manzella's here.
- Where?

563
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:47,886
On Ginostra. We are planning
to set him up again.

564
01:08:50,087 --> 01:08:52,647
You are supposed to keep out
of the operation.

565
01:08:52,807 --> 01:08:54,559
It's a request from the D.A.

566
01:08:56,847 --> 01:08:58,565
Hey, hold on!

567
01:09:00,247 --> 01:09:01,396
Oh fuck, the kid's jumped out.

568
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:04,885
Hey, hold on!

569
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,086
Come here!

570
01:09:13,287 --> 01:09:15,005
Who was watching him?

571
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:18,125
- He went that way.
- Where?

572
01:10:05,647 --> 01:10:07,000
It's all right.

573
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:18,239
We'll get them,

574
01:10:18,727 --> 01:10:22,436
believe me.
On my daughter's head.

575
01:10:41,807 --> 01:10:44,446
I'd prefer you to go back sooner.

576
01:10:44,967 --> 01:10:47,640
I've had a great time
with you and Tina here,

577
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,560
but things are getting
more difficult.

578
01:10:50,727 --> 01:10:53,924
But I told you, Giovanni
said it was safe...

579
01:10:54,087 --> 01:10:56,965
Of course Giovanni
would be delighted if you stayed.

580
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,402
Don't tell me you're jealous!

581
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:04,557
Something's going on.
You don't work with Ettore anymore.

582
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:08,800
- You don't pay attention to him now.
- I want to give him some time.

583
01:11:08,967 --> 01:11:12,801
It's not easy for him,
hat he has to tell me.

584
01:11:12,967 --> 01:11:15,322
I feel like you're
keeping things from me.

585
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:20,277
- Important things, between you two.
- What do you mean? There's nothing.

586
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:26,963
So, you were happy
that I was here

587
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:30,878
- and no you want me to leave.
- Yes,

588
01:11:32,447 --> 01:11:34,517
I want you to go home!

589
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:52,844
Oh, Lord,
Bless and sanctify this act

590
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:55,965
for the purification of my body
and soul.

591
01:12:33,967 --> 01:12:36,686
Take it, it's yours.

592
01:12:38,007 --> 01:12:39,963
Look how nice it is.

593
01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:44,283
It's an angel.
I give you an angel.

594
01:12:45,807 --> 01:12:49,482
Give it life and tenderness.

595
01:12:54,327 --> 01:12:55,965
Keep it.

596
01:12:59,447 --> 01:13:01,802
So that it may always eat.

597
01:13:02,687 --> 01:13:04,757
So that it will always be free.

598
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:42,716
- I want to go home!
- You don't like it here?

599
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:46,201
My home is over there, not here.

600
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:51,837
- We have to give them time to forget.
- Forget what?

601
01:13:53,487 --> 01:13:56,843
Time for you to forget
what they have done again.

602
01:14:00,647 --> 01:14:03,081
They don't want me
to go to Ginostra.

603
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:06,757
What do you want to do there.
There is nothing to see.

604
01:14:21,767 --> 01:14:25,476
The Manzellas' father was the richest
building contractor in Sicily.

605
01:14:25,847 --> 01:14:30,045
But that wasn't enough for him,
he wanted to conquer Naples.

606
01:14:31,407 --> 01:14:35,639
He got involved in politics. He even
tried to get elected mayor,

607
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:39,801
but the Neapolitans sent him
back home to his island.

608
01:14:42,327 --> 01:14:46,605
After that,
he decided to build a bridge,

609
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:49,920
so he would never have to
set foot in it again.

610
01:14:50,767 --> 01:14:54,316
When he had to drive from the airport
to get a boat for Ginostra,

611
01:14:54,487 --> 01:14:56,205
he would throw his garbage
out of the window,

612
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,325
as if the city was
just one big dump.

613
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:05,597
What do we do about that pretty
little nun from Santa Ginostra?

614
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:12,196
Let her run free. Soon, I'll be
able to arrest her for complicity.

615
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:16,357
Why haven't you arrested her yet?

616
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:21,801
- I mean her complicity with you.
- With me?

617
01:15:23,647 --> 01:15:26,241
Well, at the station they're saying
that you instructed the pilot

618
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:28,523
to fly over the Ginostra convent

619
01:15:28,687 --> 01:15:31,121
to sabotage Manzella's arrest.

620
01:15:31,287 --> 01:15:33,562
That's the "unofficial" version.

621
01:15:34,287 --> 01:15:36,164
You're investigating me?

622
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,517
If you keep missing Manzella,

623
01:15:39,687 --> 01:15:43,202
you'll have more time
to investigate us.

624
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:02,317
I'll climb down, I love it.

625
01:16:05,807 --> 01:16:08,002
How do you make "Bucatini"?

626
01:16:08,607 --> 01:16:10,325
A la matriciana,

627
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:13,839
Al pesto, with seafood...

628
01:16:14,327 --> 01:16:16,158
And with sunfloer seeds?

629
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:20,838
With sunflower seeds?
Only in Milano they can eat that.

630
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:27,280
The dinner when they decided
to kill Greco, they served bucatini

631
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:30,396
with sunflower seeds.

632
01:16:33,487 --> 01:16:37,719
The earth on volcanoes
is too black for sunflowers to grow.

633
01:17:45,287 --> 01:17:46,720
Fourth floor!

634
01:17:49,327 --> 01:17:51,158
Fourth floor!

635
01:17:52,447 --> 01:17:54,597
Hey! Fourth floor!

636
01:17:57,287 --> 01:17:58,959
Fourth!

637
01:19:53,127 --> 01:19:57,006
Hey! Where's Giovanni,
is he alright?

638
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:00,239
- Where?
- He's there. He's okay.

639
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:30,843
Why did you scream?

640
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,686
You screamed.

641
01:20:42,007 --> 01:20:44,646
- I heard you scream.
- Let go of me! You're crazy!

642
01:20:49,927 --> 01:20:51,201
I fell.

643
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:20,799
Yes operator. Can you get me
the District Attorney?

644
01:21:29,127 --> 01:21:30,845
<i>District Attorney.</i>

645
01:21:31,007 --> 01:21:33,601
Hello? Is Matt Benson there?

646
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:36,925
<i>What name?</i>

647
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:41,160
It's very urgent.
This is Jessie, his wife.

648
01:21:41,327 --> 01:21:44,876
And I need to talk to him.
It's really important.

649
01:21:45,047 --> 01:21:46,366
<i>One moment.</i>

650
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:51,317
Thank you. You see,
he hasn't come back.

651
01:21:53,687 --> 01:21:57,726
And I'm very frightened.
It's just that...

652
01:21:57,887 --> 01:21:59,320
<i>Hold on, please.</i>

653
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:03,844
It's just not like him to not call.
So can you tell me anything?

654
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:08,436
<i>Matt Benson has been
taken off the case. Good-Bye Ma'am.</i>

655
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:12,239
I hate you.

656
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:50,326
Your dog's not barking anymore.

657
01:22:51,327 --> 01:22:54,683
Maybe you killed him.
You would.

658
01:23:03,007 --> 01:23:06,124
The Grecos' killing
has really hurt me,

659
01:23:06,647 --> 01:23:08,444
it has hurt me bad.

660
01:23:10,047 --> 01:23:12,880
The kid's my responsibility now.

661
01:23:15,727 --> 01:23:18,321
I don't care about the kid.

662
01:23:21,527 --> 01:23:23,961
I would like the two of you
to meet.

663
01:23:26,487 --> 01:23:27,806
What for?

664
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:32,597
You could say
he's both our responsibility now.

665
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,645
I want to be alone.

666
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:41,240
Go away.

667
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:51,403
Ettore's family's tickets.

668
01:23:51,567 --> 01:23:54,843
They were supposed to leave
three days after the car bomb.

669
01:23:55,007 --> 01:23:56,406
Nobody's used them.

670
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:42,238
I had an affair with a woman
in New York, twenty years ago.

671
01:24:44,407 --> 01:24:46,443
She had a baby.

672
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:51,400
A baby I didn't want
and I didn't want to see.

673
01:24:53,567 --> 01:24:55,080
It was a girl,

674
01:24:56,487 --> 01:24:58,682
and she grew up alone,

675
01:25:00,207 --> 01:25:02,596
between Brooklyn and Queens.

676
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,764
My wife would have died
if I had told her.

677
01:25:15,327 --> 01:25:16,680
I didn't say anything

678
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:23,041
but I only accepted the missions
that would keep me here, to forget.

679
01:25:27,367 --> 01:25:30,165
The girl's mother
never held it against me.

680
01:25:32,927 --> 01:25:36,158
We hadn't planned anything,
it just happened

681
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:39,277
and the girl,

682
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:46,445
I never knew,

683
01:25:48,527 --> 01:25:52,759
but I think
she must have hated me.

684
01:26:02,767 --> 01:26:06,885
Then, when she turned seventeen
she became beautiful

685
01:26:08,487 --> 01:26:12,002
and she met Franck Manzella.

686
01:26:13,847 --> 01:26:18,204
My daughter became
Franck Manzella's mistress.

687
01:26:20,487 --> 01:26:23,843
Then his brother Joe's mistress,

688
01:26:29,247 --> 01:26:33,286
and they used her
in their business.

689
01:26:43,767 --> 01:26:46,804
When you called me
to protect the Grecos,

690
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:49,922
because the father
as going to talk,

691
01:26:50,807 --> 01:26:54,959
I knew he would denounce
Joe and my daughter.

692
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:00,403
I didn't hesitate.

693
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:06,164
You see...

694
01:27:12,487 --> 01:27:14,318
she is my daughter.

695
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:34,079
Lie down.

696
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:21,803
Tomorrow,
I'm going to have you arrested.

697
01:28:49,327 --> 01:28:53,366
Where's the lizard?
Where is it?

698
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:04,158
Where's the lizard?

699
01:29:05,287 --> 01:29:07,437
Maybe he'd like some toast
and butter,

700
01:29:07,607 --> 01:29:10,440
what do you think,
scrambled eggs?

701
01:29:11,127 --> 01:29:13,595
Okay. Here,
you sit over here darling.

702
01:29:14,207 --> 01:29:17,279
Get your tush up
don't fall off.

703
01:29:17,527 --> 01:29:20,485
Okay, put a little milk in the bowl,

704
01:29:20,887 --> 01:29:25,881
okay let's see, okay lambsky,
here we go. Breakfast.

705
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:30,359
There's a plane tomorrow at 9:00.
We're taking it.

706
01:29:31,127 --> 01:29:33,038
- Wait...
- We're taking it!

707
01:29:34,927 --> 01:29:36,246
I'll call Giovanni.

708
01:29:36,407 --> 01:29:39,365
- Do it now.
- Nice milk...

709
01:29:39,847 --> 01:29:41,166
Lamby.

710
01:29:41,407 --> 01:29:44,046
- Come on lamby.
- I'm leaving.

711
01:29:44,207 --> 01:29:47,438
- You're imagining things.
- I'm afraid here, of everything,

712
01:29:47,607 --> 01:29:49,165
- even afraid of you.
- He doesn't want any milk.

713
01:29:52,567 --> 01:29:55,001
I don't know what's happening
but its...

714
01:29:58,047 --> 01:30:00,083
How far will you go?

715
01:30:01,687 --> 01:30:03,120
Forgive me.

716
01:30:05,207 --> 01:30:08,802
The sea is getting rough. If we
don't go we could be stuck here.

717
01:30:08,967 --> 01:30:11,083
What about Ettore?

718
01:30:11,687 --> 01:30:13,279
You wanted all this.

719
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:18,639
There is nothing I can do for him.
Don't use him now.

720
01:30:20,527 --> 01:30:22,085
Call Giovanni.

721
01:30:48,687 --> 01:30:49,961
Giovanni. Matt.

722
01:30:50,127 --> 01:30:51,162
<i>Del Piero's dead.</i>

723
01:30:51,327 --> 01:30:52,362
What?

724
01:30:53,087 --> 01:30:54,759
<i>He poisoned himself.</i>

725
01:30:55,727 --> 01:30:56,762
What?

726
01:30:56,927 --> 01:30:59,839
<i>He was found
at the edge of the swimming pool.</i>

727
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:05,160
He poisoned himself?

728
01:31:09,007 --> 01:31:10,122
Was there a note?

729
01:31:10,287 --> 01:31:11,322
<i>No.</i>

730
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:14,196
Who found him?

731
01:31:14,367 --> 01:31:18,645
Susanna. I've got to go.
I'm there now.

732
01:31:24,087 --> 01:31:26,362
Okay, okay.

733
01:33:06,647 --> 01:33:08,365
Did you call Giovanni?

734
01:33:16,687 --> 01:33:18,598
I lost a friend,

735
01:33:21,247 --> 01:33:25,206
in Boscoreale.
Marty Del Piero.

736
01:33:29,047 --> 01:33:31,117
We worked together in New York,

737
01:33:32,967 --> 01:33:34,798
a long time ago.

738
01:33:39,767 --> 01:33:42,565
I'm through here.
I want to go home.

739
01:33:44,607 --> 01:33:46,916
Tomorrow, after the funeral.

740
01:34:12,367 --> 01:34:15,325
You little prick!

741
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:22,246
Are you fuckin' trying to kill me?
Are you crazy?

742
01:34:32,807 --> 01:34:35,241
Mommy, I can't find Ettore.

743
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:44,120
Ettore! Ettore!

744
01:34:59,247 --> 01:35:01,283
Where's Ettore?

745
01:35:21,887 --> 01:35:23,081
Tina.

746
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:28,204
- Love, did you see Ettore leave?
- No.

747
01:35:37,927 --> 01:35:39,406
Ettore!

748
01:36:25,247 --> 01:36:26,919
Giovanni, it's Jessie.

749
01:36:27,087 --> 01:36:30,238
I can't find Ettore anywhere.
I don't know what's happened.

750
01:36:31,847 --> 01:36:33,678
Do you know where Matt is?

751
01:36:35,687 --> 01:36:37,757
Could you come over right away?

752
01:36:39,967 --> 01:36:42,003
Yes, right away. Thank you.

753
01:36:56,767 --> 01:36:58,166
Matt!

754
01:36:59,487 --> 01:37:01,717
Ettore has disappeared,

755
01:37:02,127 --> 01:37:05,403
Giovanni thinks
he might have gone to Ginostra.

756
01:38:34,647 --> 01:38:36,763
Jessie, Jessie.

757
01:38:40,287 --> 01:38:42,357
Is there any news of Ettore?

758
01:38:43,927 --> 01:38:45,838
Calm down.

759
01:38:49,247 --> 01:38:51,715
We'll find him. I promise you.

760
01:38:52,367 --> 01:38:55,564
Don't worry. He just needed
to get away, okay?

761
01:38:55,887 --> 01:38:57,957
Where's Matt?
Is the funeral over?

762
01:38:58,127 --> 01:39:02,166
He's probably with the magistrates.
All the officials were there.

763
01:39:03,367 --> 01:39:07,155
People want to get to know Matt.
Especially his methods.

764
01:39:07,327 --> 01:39:10,160
I need to find Matt.
I need to tell him about Ettore.

765
01:39:10,327 --> 01:39:13,956
You will. I am going to Ginostra.
Ettore must have gone back there.

766
01:39:14,687 --> 01:39:17,520
I called the helicopter,
it's arriving.

767
01:39:18,007 --> 01:39:20,680
But, I need the car.

768
01:39:22,847 --> 01:39:25,964
But... Matt has mine.
I need to be able to leave.

769
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,924
I can't just be left stranded here.

770
01:39:28,087 --> 01:39:30,920
Matt will be back soon.
Don't worry.

771
01:39:31,087 --> 01:39:34,557
You have to stay here anyay.
In case Ettore comes back.

772
01:39:37,207 --> 01:39:38,606
I need the car.

773
01:39:47,087 --> 01:39:48,486
Thank you.

774
01:40:01,087 --> 01:40:04,318
Let's go. Quickly.
Go, go.

775
01:44:02,007 --> 01:44:03,645
Ettore!

776
01:44:07,207 --> 01:44:09,357
Ettore! Stop!

777
01:44:11,367 --> 01:44:12,925
Ettore!

778
01:44:19,727 --> 01:44:22,719
- What you doing? Are you alright?
- Let go of me.

779
01:44:26,167 --> 01:44:27,646
I killed Manzella.

780
01:44:32,647 --> 01:44:34,000
I'm free now.

781
01:44:35,127 --> 01:44:36,799
You took my gun.

782
01:45:11,247 --> 01:45:13,966
It's starting to wake up.
We need to evacuate. Call the base.

783
01:45:14,127 --> 01:45:17,164
Icarus to base,
Icarus to base...

784
01:45:17,327 --> 01:45:20,080
The volcano is erupting
we must evacuate the island.

785
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:21,965
I repeat.
We must evacuate the island.

786
01:45:28,847 --> 01:45:31,441
I see a car.
It's Manzella's car.

787
01:45:31,607 --> 01:45:35,236
You see the body?
I see a body by the car. Lower!

788
01:45:35,407 --> 01:45:37,204
I can't. There's a side wind.

789
01:45:37,367 --> 01:45:39,562
That's Benson's car.

790
01:45:41,207 --> 01:45:42,879
Lower!

791
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:49,323
The body is Manzella.

792
01:45:49,647 --> 01:45:51,285
Get out of here. Now!

793
01:46:43,407 --> 01:46:44,681
Ettore!

794
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:46,766
What's happening?

795
01:46:48,327 --> 01:46:51,239
- We're getting out of here.
- What about Ettore?

796
01:46:52,167 --> 01:46:53,441
What about him?

797
01:46:54,487 --> 01:46:56,079
- I'm letting him go.
- But I thought...

798
01:46:56,247 --> 01:46:57,600
- It's all over.
- Matt...

799
01:46:57,767 --> 01:47:00,122
- He's Giovanni's problem now.
- Tell me what's happening!

800
01:47:00,287 --> 01:47:01,515
Start packing!

801
01:47:31,847 --> 01:47:33,565
My car slipped into the crater

802
01:47:34,327 --> 01:47:37,956
and crashed into Manzella's pick-up.

803
01:47:40,327 --> 01:47:44,525
They will accuse me of his murder
when they find the two cars.

804
01:47:45,487 --> 01:47:48,877
I'll say it was me,
it's the truth.

805
01:47:53,207 --> 01:47:56,802
I am a criminal because
I'm keeping a criminal in my house.

806
01:48:03,567 --> 01:48:05,125
Get the hell out of here.

807
01:48:06,047 --> 01:48:09,119
- You're free.
- Where do you want me to go?

808
01:48:09,567 --> 01:48:13,480
- They want to kill me.
- I'll tell them you ran away.

809
01:48:34,807 --> 01:48:36,320
It's Giovanni.

810
01:48:40,127 --> 01:48:42,766
They've come to arrest him.

811
01:48:50,207 --> 01:48:51,845
What did you do?

812
01:48:52,567 --> 01:48:55,684
I'm not a murderer.
A revenge is not a murder.

813
01:49:12,647 --> 01:49:14,444
Matt, stop them!

814
01:49:16,127 --> 01:49:17,879
Don't let them land.

815
01:50:33,727 --> 01:50:35,319
Bastard!

816
01:51:21,407 --> 01:51:24,046
I can't. I can't get it down.

817
01:51:57,727 --> 01:51:59,524
Elena!

818
01:52:04,447 --> 01:52:05,880
Elena!

819
01:52:12,567 --> 01:52:15,161
Elena! Elena!

820
01:52:15,487 --> 01:52:16,920
Elena!

821
01:52:26,007 --> 01:52:27,281
Elena!

822
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:38,600
Elena!

823
01:52:43,927 --> 01:52:48,842
What are you doing?
We must leave. They're evacuating.

824
01:52:49,007 --> 01:52:51,760
No, I've been waiting for years.

825
01:52:57,047 --> 01:52:59,277
I've got to get Matt.
He killed Manzella.

826
01:52:59,967 --> 01:53:04,279
The volcano is going to fuck me.
I have to get a picture of the cars.

827
01:53:04,927 --> 01:53:07,760
- Elena, come on!
- No, no.

828
01:53:18,487 --> 01:53:20,523
Come on lamb, come on.

829
01:53:50,127 --> 01:53:51,765
Come on lamby.

830
01:53:52,087 --> 01:53:53,725
Come on lamby, let's play.

831
01:53:54,247 --> 01:53:57,444
If the lave covers the evidence,
I'm screwed.

832
01:53:59,607 --> 01:54:01,359
Where's your damn camera?

833
01:54:07,327 --> 01:54:08,840
He didn't do it.

834
01:54:11,767 --> 01:54:13,246
What?

835
01:54:14,207 --> 01:54:17,199
I was with Matt. He was here,
at the time Manzella disappeared.

836
01:54:17,527 --> 01:54:19,324
What are you talking about?

837
01:54:21,047 --> 01:54:22,958
You heard me.

838
01:54:28,087 --> 01:54:29,679
You fucked him?

839
01:54:32,207 --> 01:54:36,405
I didn't say that. I said he didn't
kill Manzella. He is innocent.

840
01:54:38,127 --> 01:54:40,687
What about you?
Are you innocent too?

841
01:54:44,967 --> 01:54:48,084
- Bitch!
- If you insist, I'll testify.

842
01:54:48,487 --> 01:54:51,445
You fucking bitch!

843
01:55:23,647 --> 01:55:25,160
We're safe here.

844
01:55:26,807 --> 01:55:30,197
Even if there is a tidal wave.
We're on high ground.

845
01:55:31,607 --> 01:55:33,484
The guards have left!

846
01:55:35,447 --> 01:55:38,678
- They obey Giovanni.
- Come on lamby, come on.

847
01:55:39,607 --> 01:55:41,518
Come and play with me.

848
01:55:42,367 --> 01:55:46,838
Come on lamby, come on.
Come on lamby,

849
01:55:47,487 --> 01:55:50,285
Mommy, mommy, come and see,
the lamby's sick.

850
01:55:52,447 --> 01:55:55,598
Maybe you played with it too much.
It's not a toy.

851
01:56:24,127 --> 01:56:26,118
- It's a bomb.
- What?

852
01:56:26,807 --> 01:56:29,560
They've put a bomb in it.
Get away!

853
01:56:29,727 --> 01:56:30,796
What?

854
01:56:35,247 --> 01:56:36,760
It's all right.

855
01:57:25,327 --> 01:57:29,320
Mommy, what's happening?
I'm scared.

856
01:57:50,847 --> 01:57:52,280
Jessie!

857
01:57:56,887 --> 01:58:00,118
It's all over. Sweetheart.
You alright?

858
01:58:00,527 --> 01:58:02,518
Okay, okay, sweetheart?

859
01:58:03,367 --> 01:58:05,358
You okay? It's alright.

860
01:58:05,607 --> 01:58:07,677
It's all over.

861
01:58:09,127 --> 01:58:10,606
It's all over.

862
01:58:11,207 --> 01:58:12,640
It's all over now.

863
02:00:26,287 --> 02:00:27,879
It's done.

864
02:01:05,807 --> 02:01:09,436
This is Benson. Tell him to come
and get us at the Villa Massina.

865
02:01:09,607 --> 02:01:11,996
The boy's back.
He's okay.

866
02:01:16,607 --> 02:01:18,120
Tell him to hurry.

867
02:01:41,727 --> 02:01:43,285
Fucking weather.

868
02:01:44,087 --> 02:01:47,443
Ginostra wakes up
and everything goes to hell.

869
02:01:49,247 --> 02:01:50,919
I know what you did.

870
02:01:53,607 --> 02:01:55,040
What did I do?

871
02:01:57,607 --> 02:02:00,075
Forget it.
I've come for the boy.

872
02:02:00,807 --> 02:02:04,277
Manzella's dead.
I'm responsible for him.

873
02:02:04,567 --> 02:02:07,081
You can't keep him here any longer.

874
02:02:10,847 --> 02:02:14,283
- I'll bring him back tomorrow.
- No, no. I'll take him.

875
02:02:20,567 --> 02:02:22,558
Let him get his things.

876
02:02:23,527 --> 02:02:26,405
Someone is going to
come and get his stuff tomorrow.

877
02:02:30,687 --> 02:02:33,281
- I'll get his coat.
- What?

878
02:02:34,047 --> 02:02:36,003
Matt, what are you doing?

879
02:02:39,887 --> 02:02:41,161
Matt!

880
02:03:41,287 --> 02:03:42,606
Giovanni!

881
02:03:44,207 --> 02:03:45,526
Giovanni!

882
02:03:47,367 --> 02:03:48,595
Give me the boy!

883
02:03:50,807 --> 02:03:52,923
- Give me the boy.
- What?

884
02:03:53,647 --> 02:03:56,844
- Come on. I'll bring him tomorrow!
- What are you talking about?

885
02:03:59,367 --> 02:04:01,198
Matt, Matt!

886
02:04:03,447 --> 02:04:05,597
Matt! Help me!

887
02:04:08,207 --> 02:04:09,526
Matt!

888
02:04:10,327 --> 02:04:11,442
Matt!

889
02:04:12,407 --> 02:04:15,046
He's chained me. Help!

890
02:04:17,367 --> 02:04:19,597
Matt, help me!

891
02:04:20,687 --> 02:04:22,405
They are coming to get me.

892
02:04:23,927 --> 02:04:25,724
What are you doing? Stop it!

893
02:04:38,367 --> 02:04:41,564
Ettore! Brake the light!

894
02:04:44,407 --> 02:04:47,080
The stones in your pocket!

895
02:04:48,687 --> 02:04:50,200
Break the light!

896
02:05:10,167 --> 02:05:11,759
- Bastard!
- Matt.

897
02:06:21,887 --> 02:06:23,525
Take his gun!

898
02:07:29,807 --> 02:07:31,445
Wash your hands.

899
02:07:35,367 --> 02:07:36,686
Wash them good.

900
02:07:41,247 --> 02:07:42,805
Giovanni is coming!

901
02:07:45,647 --> 02:07:48,400
It's not Giovanni.
It's for us.

902
02:07:49,647 --> 02:07:52,320
- We have to go right now.
- Where are we going?

903
02:07:52,847 --> 02:07:55,884
- Back to New York.
- What about Ettore?

904
02:07:56,247 --> 02:07:58,124
He's coming with us.
