1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:03,045
(wind howling)

2
00:00:10,216 --> 00:00:12,633
(calm music)

3
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:22,926
(loudspeaker feedback)

4
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,833
Testing; One, two, three.

5
00:00:28,053 --> 00:00:32,826
I, Patrick Lee, here and
now announce my candidacy

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,800
for the president of the United States.

7
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:40,874
I will be running a totally new campaign.

8
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:43,315
(indistinct)

9
00:00:46,754 --> 00:00:49,171
(calm music)

10
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,786
In solving problems facing us today.

11
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,346
And I challenge all others
running for this high office

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,723
to join me in solving those
problems facing us today,

13
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,196
and may the individual who
solves the most problems

14
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,220
be elected as president of
the United States of America.

15
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:22,642
(Celeste applauds)

16
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:27,355
(calm music)

17
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,697
Whoa!

18
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:33,696
(Lee thuds)

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,657
Are you okay?

20
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:36,292
Huh?

21
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,285
Oh yeah, yeah.

22
00:01:38,309 --> 00:01:39,756
I'm okay, whoa.

23
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,657
Oh gosh.

24
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:41,880
I'm a little shook up.

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,957
Are you sure?

26
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,359
You know, you're bleeding from the head.

27
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:47,652
What?

28
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:49,126
Really?

29
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,523
Where are my glasses?

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,406
These things?

31
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,723
They're broken.

32
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,336
Damn!

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,893
Those are my eyes!

34
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,876
You know, I'm Celeste.

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,916
Here, let me help you up.

36
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,757
No, it's okay.

37
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,496
I can take care of myself.

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,656
You probably have better things to do.

39
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,966
I can't just leave you here like this.

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,356
Yeah, it's okay.

41
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,116
I can take care of myself.

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,426
You know, I was on my way to breakfast.

43
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,766
The restaurant's just
a few blocks from here,

44
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,806
have you had breakfast yet?

45
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,830
Wait, you were the one who clapped.

46
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,833
Yeah, your presentation was inspired.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,956
You didn't think it was
boring or a pile of platitudes?

48
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,593
No, you could tell
it was from the heart.

49
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,623
Do you like poached eggs?

50
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,126
So have you held any office,

51
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,063
and I mean any political office at all?

52
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:53,076
President.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,546
Oh, president of what?

54
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,446
Oberoende, it's a micro nation.

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,316
A nation within a
nation, right here in LA.

56
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,416
Well like the Cherokee Nation?

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,916
That's my nation, you know?

58
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,916
We have 380,000 tribal citizens.

59
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,233
How about your nation?

60
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,846
Well, we had a few now and
then, and over the years,

61
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,256
but now you're looking
at its sole inhabitant.

62
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,386
Oh, we gotta start somewhere.

63
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,966
We still have time to
get everything together.

64
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,571
So you're with me?

65
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:29,856
Yeah, I like what you have to say.

66
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,856
But you have to stop
preaching on street corners.

67
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,196
So you've heard of me before.

68
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,270
You could say that.

69
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,308
So how is the campaign gonna be funded?

70
00:03:40,332 --> 00:03:41,142
No problem.

71
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:41,975
Oh.

72
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,999
I'm so sorry.

73
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,926
So you were saying, that
financing the campaign

74
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,426
is not a problem?

75
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,216
Are you a multimillionaire?

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,799
Do I look like one?

77
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:04,383
No, but I just figured, it might help.

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,623
Well, I have enough to
get by, but I'm no Trump.

79
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,886
Actually, those would
donate to the campaign

80
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,506
will fund the solutions to the problems

81
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,246
close to their hearts.

82
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,756
And when we have enough money
to solve a particular problem,

83
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,430
its solution will be implemented.

84
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,923
That's a good idea.

85
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Thanks.

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
Here.

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,206
So how are you gonna get
people to believe in you enough

88
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,243
to part with their hard-earned cash?

89
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,170
Oh well, if I just had
enough charisma I could do it.

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,836
I think I may be of service.

91
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,653
So my lack of sight isn't a negative?

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,106
Well actually FDR was elected four times

93
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,480
and he was in a wheelchair.

94
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,533
I think your Asperger's
might be more of a problem.

95
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,753
Are your doctor?

96
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:09,906
No. No, I'm just observant.

97
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,286
Huh.

98
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,433
Well, would you like to visit Oberoende?

99
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,103
Sure, let's go.

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,620
My car's just on the corner,

101
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,333
but without my goggles I'm legally blind.

102
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,603
So you need to chauffeur.

103
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:30,859
(calm music)

104
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,413
I think we're here.

105
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,563
Okay, gimme a second.

106
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:43,026
All right, you're all set.

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,283
I know how this works.

108
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:46,563
Mind your head.

109
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,175
Ah, okay.

110
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,749
Okay, approaching the stairs.

111
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,813
This is Oberoende.

112
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,536
Nice touch.

113
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,646
What?

114
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,670
The doormat.

115
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,276
Oh, thanks.

116
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,673
And I see you're a CPA.

117
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:10,116
I am.

118
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Ring the doorbell.

119
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,896
Don't you have a key?

120
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,203
Sure, but just do it.

121
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,515
Okay.

122
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:22,697
("Oberoende Anthem")

123
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,721
What is that?

124
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,013
Oberoende national anthem.

125
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,611
Shall we?

126
00:06:29,635 --> 00:06:30,635
Okay.

127
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:33,351
(door beeps)

128
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,375
In we go.

129
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,283
This is my office.

130
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,043
Those are my certificates,

131
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,053
and those are my collection of telephones.

132
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:06,634
(upbeat music)

133
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:22,836
Huh?

134
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,966
You can't wear those in public.

135
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,646
Why not?

136
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,473
Definitely a stereotype.

137
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,794
Oh.

138
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,073
If I'm blind, I'm blind.

139
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,016
Maybe an operation could help.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,966
That'll be expensive.

141
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,896
If you plan on being
president, we can find the money.

142
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,193
Oh cool.

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,178
So what do you think?

144
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:49,956
Oh, definitely not another country,

145
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,366
but then again, in your mind it could be.

146
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,353
This is my office,
base of my operations.

147
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,900
And where do you live?

148
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:05,110
(calm music)

149
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,013
Welcome Oberoende.

150
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:15,570
(enchanting music)

151
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,396
(enchanting music)

152
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,420
What do you think?

153
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,863
Yeah, this is more like it.

154
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,970
Beautiful.

155
00:08:46,758 --> 00:08:48,306
We can have a feast in here

156
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,766
and this could double
as a campaign office.

157
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,790
I agree.

158
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,566
Bedrooms are on the third floor.

159
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,590
More stairs.

160
00:08:57,615 --> 00:09:00,032
(calm music)

161
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:19,770
(calm music)

162
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,066
Is this where you sleep?

163
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,090
Usually.

164
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,176
Looks comfortable.

165
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,333
Oh, it's very comfortable.

166
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,323
Would you like to check it out?

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Not now.

168
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,947
(calm music)

169
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,456
Where do you keep your clothes?

170
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,863
Oh, in the closet.

171
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,950
Okay.

172
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,067
Mm-mm.

173
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:17,091
Nope.

174
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,283
Okay, we need to get you a new wardrobe.

175
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,853
Um, is there something
wrong with my clothes?

176
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,496
One would only have to
look in a mirror to know.

177
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Hmm.

178
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,483
Does this mean you're dressing me up?

179
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,173
Yeah, dressed up you won't look bad.

180
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,396
Yup, we can definitely
make use of this space,

181
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,323
plan a grassroots campaign
starting with your friends.

182
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,953
I don't have any friends.

183
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,773
Don't worry, I have a few.

184
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,437
(men chanting)

185
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:09,937
(people chattering)

186
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,513
Hi, I'm Patrick Lee.

187
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,083
Thank you for coming here.

188
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,603
Thank you for filling out the cards.

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,770
And uh...

190
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,366
Thank you for your donations.

191
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,136
We want you to know

192
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,226
that the money you
contribute to this campaign

193
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,816
will go towards solving the
problems you have identified.

194
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,566
So make sure to write down
the problems you want solved

195
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,393
on the cards you've received.

196
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:03,417
(audience applauds)

197
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:06,149
Thank you.

198
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,756
(men chanting)

199
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,576
Do you like the fried bread?

200
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,343
Yes, it's very delicious.

201
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,193
But it's not very healthy.

202
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,466
It's a staple of the
(indistinct) circuit.

203
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,913
It's born of a time
when that's all we had.

204
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,487
Yes, I know that.

205
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,446
I wanna thank you for
putting all this together.

206
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,250
It's very impressive what you did, it's...

207
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,876
Excuse me for a moment.

208
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,643
A good friend of mine is here.

209
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,837
(calm music)

210
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:03,126
I am Patrick Lee, nice to meet you.

211
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,960
We met.

212
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,826
Have you forgotten my name already?

213
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,266
Samuel Brightcloud.

214
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,733
Oh right, Sam.

215
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,763
Celeste is really something.

216
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,016
Do you know how she got
so many people to show up?

217
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,723
Don't you know who she is?

218
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,190
No.

219
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,136
She could have been the
chief of the Cherokee nation,

220
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,663
she had it in her grasp.

221
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,356
She chose to leave Oklahoma
and come here to California

222
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,966
and many of her followers came with her.

223
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,616
Is she a politician?

224
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,640
No, a born leader, like
Mankiller before her.

225
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,366
Mankiller?

226
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,486
Wilma Mankiller, the first woman Chief

227
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,713
of the Cherokee nation.

228
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:50,389
(calm music)

229
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,749
("Oberoende Anthem")

230
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:02,848
I'm coming!

231
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,277
I'm almost there.

232
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,586
Patrick Lee?

233
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,457
Yes.

234
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,496
Oh, I have a package for you.

235
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,816
Is it my new eyes?

236
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,986
That's right.

237
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,663
Oh, thank God for insurance.

238
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:30,471
(speaking in foreign language)

239
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,536
Hello, this is Catalina
Vargas reporting for KSMX News.

240
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,176
Now while most of you know,
presidential candidates,

241
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,936
there are some that are not
as popular or as famous,

242
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,606
but still have that intent
to win the big prize

243
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,836
come this November.

244
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,786
So today we are gonna introduce you

245
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,446
to a hopeful local candidate
by the name of Patrick Lee.

246
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,126
As we interview him here,

247
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,826
inside his national campaign headquarters

248
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,406
located in Los Angeles.

249
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,696
Good afternoon.

250
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,856
Mr. Lee, I hear you're
running for president

251
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,023
of the United States?

252
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,876
Yes, what do you want?

253
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,856
The Spanish language station?

254
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,403
We talked about it, for Hispanic voters.

255
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,966
I'm Celeste Seedlingsun, I'm
Patrick's campaign manager.

256
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,466
[Patrick] But I don't speak Spanish.

257
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,603
English is fine.

258
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,376
First of all, what is
it that you're wearing?

259
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,756
And also are you playing some
type of virtual reality game?

260
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,590
Oh these?

261
00:15:28,614 --> 00:15:30,336
These are my new eyes.

262
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,166
I can't see you without them.

263
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,000
Oh.

264
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,256
Excuse me, Patrick is legally blind.

265
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,713
You don't need to wear
these for this interview.

266
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:41,107
Ah, of course.

267
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,006
Mr. Lee, we're actually
wanting to feature you

268
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,436
and do this interview to
put it in our segment,

269
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,296
it's called "Daylight."

270
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,546
It actually airs at the
end of our broadcast,

271
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,433
and it's usually pieces that
are both humorous and unusual.

272
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,726
Do you think I'm funny or strange?

273
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,486
Not necessarily, but besides
the fact that you're blind,

274
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,333
I also understand that you're autistic?

275
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,176
Yes, I have Asperger's syndrome.

276
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,776
And yet you're running for
president of the United States?

277
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,186
Well, I don't think

278
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,856
any of those conditions are a disability.

279
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,686
Actually it helps me to concentrate

280
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,136
on focusing to solve the problems.

281
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,946
Interesting, and how is it
that you intend on winning?

282
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:29,826
Well, my campaign will
be completely different

283
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,806
from the history of all politics.

284
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,376
I'll be running a totally
positive campaign.

285
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,283
There'll be no money
allocated to media time.

286
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,886
Are we paying for this?

287
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,720
No, no.

288
00:16:42,744 --> 00:16:45,456
This is what we call a
public service announcement.

289
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,213
Oh great, I'll log it in as such.

290
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,356
You know, let's conduct the interview

291
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,826
in front of the desk.

292
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,236
Okay, yeah. Good idea.

293
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,486
- Come on.
- Slowly, Mr. Patrick.

294
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,766
Yes, right you front of the desk.

295
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,656
I'm right behind you.

296
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,062
Gimme a second right here.

297
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:03,895
Yeah.

298
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,728
I'm just gonna move the monitor.

299
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:05,562
I got him, perfect.

300
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:07,776
Oh it's just me, Catalina Vargas.

301
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,056
Okay, we're just gonna
continue our interview.

302
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,306
If you could look straight,
the camera's pointing at us.

303
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,139
Perfect.

304
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:13,973
Yeah. No, this way.

305
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:15,006
Great.

306
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,586
So you were saying you aren't interested

307
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,950
in spending any money on media ads.

308
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,066
Oh right, there will be no
money allocated to media ads,

309
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,986
including promoting for myself

310
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,796
or talking bad stuff
about other candidates

311
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,236
running for the high office.

312
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,326
In fact, all the money will go
towards solving the problems

313
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,806
facing us today in America
and around the world.

314
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,846
Wow, that seems like
a really lofty goal.

315
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,306
How do you intend on
carrying out this campaign?

316
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,147
Well, it's simple;

317
00:17:43,171 --> 00:17:45,753
It starts right here, Oberoende.

318
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:49,926
See, it's a micro nation,
a nation within a nation.

319
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,866
And I'm the president of it, well now,

320
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,176
but I'm also gonna be the president

321
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,616
of the United States later.

322
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,703
We're gonna change everything from within.

323
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,196
Okay, one second.

324
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,536
Excuse me, could you be so kind?

325
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,147
Stay right there.

326
00:18:06,171 --> 00:18:10,088
(speaking in foreign language)

327
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,056
Keep rolling, Jorge.

328
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,766
Keep rolling.

329
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,406
Right here, Mr. Patrick Lee, Yes.

330
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,626
We're gonna continue our interview.

331
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,876
Please tell us more.

332
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,256
Tell us more about what?

333
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,666
About how you were talking

334
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,936
about the different lofty
goals that you have.

335
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,406
Oh, well one of the things

336
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,406
is we're not gonna
waste tax payers dollars

337
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,325
on traveling around the
country all the time-

338
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:37,016
(phone ringing)

339
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,836
Hello?

340
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,510
[Julia] Patrick, this is Julia.

341
00:18:44,262 --> 00:18:45,828
Julia?

342
00:18:45,852 --> 00:18:48,636
[Julia] Julia Vanderbilt,
the third, your client.

343
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,286
Oh, hi Julia.

344
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,606
[Julia] Look, I really must insist

345
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,916
you continue to do my taxes.

346
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,413
I told you I can't do it.

347
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,536
[Julia] Absolutely unacceptable.

348
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,610
I can't find anyone else of your caliber.

349
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,606
Well, it's not that,

350
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,016
I just don't have any time.

351
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,386
The campaign's taking up all my time.

352
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,906
I've dropped all my clients, not just you.

353
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,046
[Julia] Patrick, Patrick,

354
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,546
we've been together for so many years

355
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,946
and you understand my portfolio.

356
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,056
Plus no one can find
that special loophole,

357
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,916
I could pay you more.

358
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,383
Well, it's not that.

359
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:24,756
I'm going to be president.

360
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,657
[Julia] Don't be silly.

361
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:27,636
You don't have a chance in politics,

362
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,739
you're just wasting your time.

363
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:32,136
Cut, cut, you're not taping this, right?

364
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,756
Sorry Celeste, we
can't have you do that.

365
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,286
Keep rolling, Jorge.

366
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,936
[Julia] What's going on there?

367
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,756
Oh, I think I'm being
interviewed by a TV station.

368
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,590
[Julia] What?

369
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,063
Is this call being recorded?

370
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,767
I think so.

371
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,458
(phone beeping)

372
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,686
That's okay, Celeste
just removed the phone.

373
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,710
Oh, well I have many loyal supporters.

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,156
Oh, well talking about loyal supporters,

375
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,403
how are the American people
going to vote for you?

376
00:20:05,427 --> 00:20:07,266
How are they gonna know
about your policies

377
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,556
and your procedures?

378
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,196
Well, the internet will be my vehicle

379
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,678
and my solutions will be
spreading like a provise

380
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:17,188
on the inter...

381
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:18,516
(object clatters)

382
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,716
Oh gosh.

383
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,233
I don't like that, what is that?

384
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,786
Oh no, your monitor broke.

385
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,016
Here, let me help you.

386
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,726
What, my monitor?

387
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,076
Yeah, you stepped on it.

388
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,966
It's okay, here.

389
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,366
That's not good for
television, and be careful.

390
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,656
Here, I'm just gonna put it on your chair,

391
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,756
you can deal with that later with Celeste.

392
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,589
Are you okay?

393
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,422
Uh-huh.

394
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:39,256
Any cuts or anything?

395
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,416
Okay, let me reframe you.

396
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,875
Let's get back to the interview.

397
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:42,817
Okay, uh-huh.

398
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,096
You were talking to me about solutions

399
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,900
and how they were gonna spread.

400
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:49,026
It sounded like a virus.

401
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,496
Oh, provise.

402
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,386
It was a word that I coined.

403
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,406
So see, like a virus it
endangers, it spreads,

404
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,896
and it hurts the host from within.

405
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,166
But a provise, it empowers

406
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,926
and it enlightens from within, provise.

407
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,733
So see, our solutions will
go provo on social media.

408
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,480
(phone ringing)

409
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,272
Oh God, another call.

410
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:17,296
Hello?

411
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:22,986
I told you I don't have time for this.

412
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,820
I'm bu...

413
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:24,876
Barb!

414
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,373
No, no, listen.

415
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:29,042
(Patrick sighs)

416
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,066
Barb.

417
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,136
I can't...

418
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:34,605
Barb, no I'm here.

419
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,039
Yes.

420
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,063
No, no, no.

421
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,393
I'm running for president.

422
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,043
Yes, of the United States of America.

423
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,146
Yes.

424
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,299
Cut, cut, we didn't agree to this.

425
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:56,736
(speaking in foreign language)

426
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,376
Sorry, there won't be
any more interruptions.

427
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,816
Okay, thank you.

428
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,736
Mr. Lee, we can actually
finish our interview

429
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,086
right over here.

430
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,496
Do you need assistance?

431
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,330
Yes please.

432
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:07,814
- Here's my arm.
- Okay.

433
00:22:07,838 --> 00:22:09,145
And we'll just walk over here.

434
00:22:09,169 --> 00:22:09,978
Okay.

435
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:10,812
All right.

436
00:22:10,836 --> 00:22:14,070
And then if you could just
slightly turn around, perfect.

437
00:22:14,094 --> 00:22:14,904
Turn around?

438
00:22:14,928 --> 00:22:16,038
Yeah, there you go.

439
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:17,046
- Okay.
- All right.

440
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,393
Let me make sure.

441
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,403
Jorge, you got the angle?

442
00:22:19,427 --> 00:22:20,826
Great, all right.

443
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,406
Now, we were talking about solutions.

444
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,806
What solutions are those?

445
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,206
Oh right, so the
solutions to the problems

446
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,286
that my campaign contributors
specify in their donations.

447
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,136
So people can send you money

448
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,036
and ask for example, to end homelessness?

449
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,084
Yes, and I come up with
a plan to achieve it.

450
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,066
("Oberoende Anthem")

451
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:42,899
What's that noise?

452
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:43,923
What's that music?

453
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,250
Oberoende national anthem.

454
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:52,107
(banging on door)

455
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,050
I'll get rid of him.

456
00:22:55,363 --> 00:22:57,006
(Patrick sighs)

457
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,030
I guess he gave up.

458
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,746
Jorge, let's get back to the interview.

459
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,026
Now, Mr. Lee, why don't you talk to us

460
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,096
about what your current solutions

461
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,106
that you're working on are?

462
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,126
Well, first of all,

463
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,976
we have to compare the
amount of money contributed

464
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,776
to solving a specific problem

465
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,268
and then see how much money-

466
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,792
(car honking)

467
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,586
Patrick, I need to talk to you.

468
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,326
No, no, he's busy right now.

469
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,159
Sorry, this can wait.

470
00:23:23,183 --> 00:23:24,042
You're gonna have to come back later.

471
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:24,967
Stick with me, man. I need you.

472
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:26,676
I need you like the
windmill needs the breeze,

473
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,996
like the crop needs to rain,

474
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,406
like the stool needs the pigeon man.

475
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,683
We're inseparable.

476
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:31,926
Sir, I'm in the middle of an interview.

477
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,382
Chris, is that you?

478
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:34,216
I need you, man.

479
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,946
The answer is no!

480
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,346
I'm no longer in the tax business.

481
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,936
I'm running for president.

482
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,643
More like falling on your face.

483
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,696
No negativity please.

484
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,537
Well, in a month or two,

485
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:48,696
you'll be asking me to pick
you up off the streets.

486
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,530
And don't ask you to fund

487
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,876
your little stupid campaign either.

488
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,746
Where's the camera?

489
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,579
Where's the camera?

490
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:54,603
[Jorge] Over here.

491
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,256
Really, I have many loyal supporters.

492
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,626
Wait, is this a live feed?

493
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,497
Yes.

494
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,026
How my outfit look?

495
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,466
Sorry, I forgot you blind.

496
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,056
You know this guy's brilliant.

497
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,166
If anybody should be president,

498
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,176
it's my main man right here, Patrick Lee.

499
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,165
I mean, he's a legend
in the field of taxes,

500
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:13,266
he be doing mine the last few years.

501
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,796
But enough about him.

502
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,386
Check out my late night show,

503
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,636
seven days a week, "Chris' Show."

504
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,385
We got porn stars, guest stars-

505
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:21,319
("Oberoende Anthem")

506
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,776
(knocking on door)

507
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,610
(speaking in foreign language)

508
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,696
(phone ringing)

509
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,154
Cut!

510
00:24:27,178 --> 00:24:29,595
(calm music)

511
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:34,067
(birds chirping)

512
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:41,940
(water sprinkling)

513
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,213
Thank you so much, enjoy.

514
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:54,096
(speaking in foreign language)

515
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,117
Auntie Lilly, what will you have?

516
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:58,806
(speaking in foreign language)

517
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,816
I think I'll try a Jonathan

518
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,036
in memory of Johnny Appleseed.

519
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,646
Hmm, he certainly was a respected man.

520
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,770
Thank you very much.

521
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,026
May these seeds grow into trees

522
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,636
that bear much fruit, Auntie Lilly.

523
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,803
Wado, Celeste.

524
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,806
I hope your campaign blossoms.

525
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,293
May we solve the
problems you've submitted.

526
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,753
Thank you.

527
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,198
I'd like to talk to you.

528
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:26,032
Sure.

529
00:25:26,056 --> 00:25:28,497
Can you take over for me please?

530
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:29,521
Sure.

531
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,993
Hi, welcome to Patrick
Lee's seed for change.

532
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,473
What are we doing here?

533
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:43,053
Do you really believe this
man can become president?

534
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,573
I know what I know, and I
must do what I believe is right.

535
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,996
I believe we're wasting our time

536
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,266
on this stupid little campaign.

537
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:59,013
I respect your opinion,
but I know what I'm doing.

538
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,066
Everyone can make a mistake and recover,

539
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,762
but only if you don't go too
far in the wrong direction.

540
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:09,203
(calm music)

541
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,383
Samuel, what do you think?

542
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,207
Why do you wanna become president?

543
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,036
To solve problems.

544
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,310
You seem to have enough
problems of your own.

545
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:26,796
It doesn't seem to bother Celeste.

546
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,286
You are just an
accountant, not a politician.

547
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,706
Celeste is a charismatic leader

548
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,593
and a great community organizer.

549
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,380
But things are not always
what they seem with her.

550
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,376
I'm not completely sure
what her motives are,

551
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,896
but the sooner you dissolve your campaign,

552
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,723
the better for her and you.

553
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,536
You don't think I should be running?

554
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,113
I think I've made it very clear.

555
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,500
Probably a lot of
people may feel this way,

556
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:01,146
but I have a mission.

557
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,276
A mission you will never accomplish.

558
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,986
A mission that I must accomplish!

559
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,686
As president of the United States?

560
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,753
No, as the president of Oberoende.

561
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,516
What is this Oberoende, a
figment of your imagination?

562
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,346
Let me show you.

563
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,993
It's a nation within a nation.

564
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,947
It's a micro nation.

565
00:27:22,794 --> 00:27:23,794
A what?

566
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:26,850
It's Oberoende.

567
00:27:28,637 --> 00:27:31,554
(enchanting music)

568
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,190
What do you think?

569
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,836
Are you okay?

570
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,143
Celeste designed this for you.

571
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,606
What?

572
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:54,075
Admit it, this was Celeste's idea.

573
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,686
No.

574
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:58,416
She at least helped put this together.

575
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,546
This is the seal of Oberoende.

576
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,856
I designed this way before
even meeting Celeste.

577
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,506
Don't lie to me!

578
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,031
(dramatic music)

579
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,805
(Patrick groans)

580
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,960
Please forgive me, I
didn't want to believe you.

581
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,696
But now I know the truth.

582
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,687
What's going on?

583
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,243
I opposed your campaign.

584
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,523
Now I know that we're brothers.

585
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,445
(calm music)

586
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,116
I'm sorry if I frightened you,

587
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,943
but these are sacred Cherokee
symbols that you've assembled.

588
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:47,806
This must be a sign, a sign
that this was meant to be.

589
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,026
So does that mean you
have changed your mind

590
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,526
about my campaign?

591
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,550
Oh, from now on you are
Patrick Dark Horse Lee.

592
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:10,168
(knocking on door)

593
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,977
I want to apologize for not believing you.

594
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,843
You know, I came here to
California reluctantly.

595
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,096
I've known you since you were a child,

596
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,656
and I have never really
believed in your visions.

597
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,826
I thought there were just a way for you

598
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,016
to manipulate others.

599
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,603
And what's changed your mind?

600
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,886
(Samuel sighs)

601
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,426
I saw the seal of Oberoende,

602
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,853
exactly as you described
it in your visions.

603
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:49,866
So now you understand my mission.

604
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,256
If you feel that he will
make a great president,

605
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,803
I believe you must be right.

606
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,256
But to tell you the truth,

607
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,153
rather than him, I believe
you should be president.

608
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,770
I will be.

609
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,630
What?

610
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,823
It was in my vision.

611
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,916
(calm music)

612
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:20,856
(birds chirping)

613
00:30:27,612 --> 00:30:30,422
(dramatic music)

614
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:33,113
(siren wailing)

615
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,042
(dramatic music)

616
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:47,267
(Patrick groans)

617
00:30:53,043 --> 00:30:55,669
Is something wrong, officer?

618
00:30:55,693 --> 00:30:56,976
I wanna talk to you.

619
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,196
This is not what it looks like,

620
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,236
these are my new eyes.

621
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:05,515
I'm not an officer, I'm the son of Sam.

622
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,348
(dramatic music)

623
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:07,237
What?

624
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:09,126
No, don't kill me!

625
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,596
I can't see you.

626
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,220
The son of Samuel Brightcloud.

627
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,183
He carries, but not as boldly as I do.

628
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:18,576
(Patrick sighs)

629
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,267
What about the badge?

630
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,586
It's a Cherokee star.

631
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,536
I'm Seco, with NARM,

632
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,710
the Native American
Revolutionary Movement.

633
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,706
Okay.

634
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,856
I believe my father's
welcomed you to the tribe.

635
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,706
They call you brother Dark Horse.

636
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,876
Yes.

637
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,756
It seems like Dark
Horse has a broken leg.

638
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,616
I don't understand.

639
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,276
Don't you usually put a horse
with a broken leg to sleep?

640
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,286
Not necessarily.

641
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,686
I mean, that's assuming he has no value.

642
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,686
But a champion horse
has a career as a stud.

643
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,576
Okay, stud.

644
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,586
Somehow you convinced
Celeste and my father

645
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,643
that your campaign has a chance,
but I don't believe that.

646
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,780
Why not?

647
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,360
Because your philosophies on life

648
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,813
are against human nature.

649
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,003
Because I'm a pacifist?

650
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,546
Are you saying violence
isn't the answer.

651
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,523
It's an answer, it's not a solution.

652
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,240
You're just playing with words.

653
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,056
You can't change someone
by just knocking them,

654
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,223
striking them down.

655
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:30,170
You must reason with them
and treat them as an equal.

656
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,646
Change 'em from within,

657
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,170
that's the only way you
can really change someone.

658
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,956
Not in the real world.

659
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,086
Power is all people look at.

660
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,816
You're weak, so you're looking
for another alternative.

661
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,496
But the powerful have always ruled,

662
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,276
and the weak have always been rolled over.

663
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,896
It's just the way things are.

664
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,383
I know the way things are,

665
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,856
I'm talking about the
way things should be.

666
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,536
It just seems I'm wasting my time.

667
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,860
I hope you see the light

668
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,203
because my tribe seems
to think you're somebody,

669
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,206
but I don't see anything at all.

670
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,463
Don't worry about it.

671
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,826
One day, the blind will be able to see,

672
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,103
perhaps that day is today.

673
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,945
We'll see about that, stud.

674
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:21,968
(pensive music)

675
00:33:21,992 --> 00:33:24,492
(Seco scoffs)

676
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,756
In your first line,
you present yourself,

677
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,123
your name and the office
you're running for.

678
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,816
And then, why you're in the race.

679
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,143
A little of your background and
what you hope to accomplish.

680
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,526
Then and only then do
you go into the specifics

681
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,916
of your campaign and why
people should vote for you

682
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,986
rather than anyone else.

683
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:52,709
Do you think you have all of that down?

684
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,306
I guess.

685
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:55,798
Pretty much.

686
00:33:55,822 --> 00:33:56,632
Oh, okay.

687
00:33:56,656 --> 00:33:57,846
You're gonna be on a stage next week.

688
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,706
You have to be ready.

689
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:02,346
Please have the lines and
the speech patterns down.

690
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,180
Do you really think

691
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:05,136
I should be talking to a crowd of people?

692
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,696
You're running for president.

693
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,306
You can't do everything
from your computer.

694
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,376
Oh, I don't think I'm ready.

695
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,367
Okay.

696
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,126
You know, you have to get
out and meet more people.

697
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,343
Expand your horizons.

698
00:34:18,574 --> 00:34:21,066
I just wanna solve problems.

699
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,353
Shouldn't that be enough?

700
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,826
Okay, we're putting in
some pretty heavy hours,

701
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,000
maybe I should move in.

702
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,876
It could really cut the
travel time back and forth

703
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,003
and I could save the money on rent.

704
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,023
Sure, we should work
more closely together.

705
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
I agree.

706
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
You do have the extra bedroom.

707
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,943
Oh, right.

708
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:50,919
I guess that'll be okay.

709
00:34:50,943 --> 00:34:52,746
Then it's settled.

710
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,720
I'll start moving my stuff in tomorrow.

711
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,780
Yes.

712
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,173
I think that'll work.

713
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,703
Okay, let's practice your presentation.

714
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,446
Who am I talking to?

715
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,220
Just pretend there's an audience.

716
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,110
Okay.

717
00:35:17,006 --> 00:35:18,807
It just doesn't feel right.

718
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,426
I'm nervous.

719
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,106
Do you think you'll be less nervous

720
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,863
when there's people actually there?

721
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:30,164
(Patrick exhales)

722
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:30,997
Okay, okay, wait.

723
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:31,956
Don't breathe into the mic.

724
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
Let me show you.

725
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,026
I am Patrick Lee and I'm
running for president

726
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,666
of the United States.

727
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,829
I can do that.

728
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:41,853
Okay.

729
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:45,996
I'm Patrick Lee,

730
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,843
and I'm running for the
president of the United States.

731
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:51,388
(Celeste groans)

732
00:35:51,412 --> 00:35:52,836
Do you know what was wrong with that?

733
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,216
No.

734
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,646
Oh, it sounded like you were reading.

735
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,623
There's no emotion at all.

736
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,413
I have to be more excited?

737
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,836
Do you remember the
part about the eagle?

738
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,946
Yes.

739
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,970
Try that.

740
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,116
The Eagle is the symbol of our country.

741
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,413
It represents strength and freedom.

742
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,659
What happened?

743
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:19,493
What did we talk about?

744
00:36:19,517 --> 00:36:22,866
There's no emotion at all.

745
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,156
Here, I'll show you.

746
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,405
Just watch me.

747
00:36:25,429 --> 00:36:28,896
(Patrick groans)

748
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,256
The eagle is the symbol of this nation.

749
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,916
It represents strength and freedom.

750
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,396
The eagle has a right
wing and a left wing.

751
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,336
Both wings must work in unison

752
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,036
or this great bird cannot fly,

753
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,823
cannot soar majestically through the sky.

754
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,376
Without both wings, both
sides working as one,

755
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,713
this country will not survive.

756
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,056
I want this country to fly, to soar.

757
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,226
And you, you are the
feathers in these wings

758
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,766
that will carry this
campaign to Washington

759
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,518
and the White House.

760
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:15,006
(Patrick applauds)

761
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,527
Oh man, I mean...

762
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:22,477
I know the words, but I
can't speak like that.

763
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,640
No.

764
00:37:23,664 --> 00:37:27,296
But when I'm finished with
you, you'll be able to do it.

765
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,237
(enchanting music)

766
00:37:28,261 --> 00:37:32,886
Every person has a voice and
every voice is different.

767
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:35,073
You just haven't found yours yet.

768
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,910
But when you do, you will be able to soar.

769
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,356
All right, these go in the meeting room.

770
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
Okay.

771
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,916
Just a few more boxes

772
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,866
then we're back to rehearsing your speech

773
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:54,158
for the high school.

774
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:56,364
Oh, not the speech again.

775
00:37:56,388 --> 00:37:57,197
Yeah.

776
00:37:57,221 --> 00:37:58,030
(phone ringing)

777
00:37:58,054 --> 00:37:59,054
Oh, I'll get it.

778
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,573
Patrick Lee's campaign
offices, how can I help you?

779
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,710
Barb who?

780
00:38:10,302 --> 00:38:11,496
Who?

781
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Hello?

782
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,230
Hello?

783
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,686
Strange call.

784
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,960
[Patrick] Oh no!

785
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:18,793
(glass breaking)

786
00:38:18,817 --> 00:38:19,817
Are you okay?

787
00:38:20,544 --> 00:38:22,189
[Patrick] I'm okay.

788
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:23,824
(glass breaking)

789
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:25,181
I'm coming up.

790
00:38:29,149 --> 00:38:31,741
(calm music)

791
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:34,348
(ship honking)

792
00:38:37,764 --> 00:38:39,366
(calm music)

793
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,990
It's beautiful up here, up on the deck.

794
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:44,827
(ship honking)

795
00:38:44,851 --> 00:38:48,546
This ocean air is so refreshing.

796
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,076
I love this breeze on my face.

797
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,850
(waves crashing)

798
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,033
This is a fantastic place to dream.

799
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,890
It's my favorite place in Oberoende.

800
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,156
Sometimes I'll come up here

801
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,816
and imagine I'm on a voyage
to some exotic destinations.

802
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,093
Like the pictures on the walls?

803
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,736
I've never really been to those places.

804
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,243
Even in my mind, I've always been alone.

805
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:22,910
I don't even know what
happened to my parents.

806
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:27,303
I guess they couldn't deal
with my peculiarities.

807
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,543
Mine were very intense.

808
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:36,628
They instilled their goals
and their dreams in me.

809
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,743
They both died young, in a plane crash.

810
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,686
Who raised you then?

811
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,810
The whole community.

812
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,310
I was a child of the tribe

813
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,563
and Sam Brightcloud became my mentor,

814
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:58,740
though being headstrong
I seldom listened to him.

815
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:01,871
I barely remember my parents.

816
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,046
I mean, they seemed to
be on the edge of my life

817
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,253
and just disappeared
when I was very young.

818
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,153
You didn't get to know them?

819
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,963
They went their own way.

820
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,653
I was raised first at a foster home,

821
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,893
and then at an institution.

822
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,007
I kept their books since the age of 10,

823
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:33,216
and they said if it wasn't for me,

824
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,253
they might never have stayed afloat.

825
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:39,336
(calm music)

826
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Like this boat?

827
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,460
Yeah, like this boat.

828
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,571
(keyboard clacking)

829
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,723
What are you still doing up?

830
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,053
Is that a game you're playing?

831
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,356
I thought you took this
campaign seriously.

832
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,913
You need to get your sleep.

833
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,166
Well, it's a game all right,

834
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,993
but it's a game to save lives.

835
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,146
Another one of your inventions?

836
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,016
Everything, even the game
can have more than one purpose.

837
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,166
Sure, to hook you, to entertain,

838
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,383
to keep you up all night, right?

839
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,340
No.

840
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,962
For instance, this card that I clicked on.

841
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,266
It reads, "The people who are crazy enough

842
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:37,257
to think they can change the
world are the ones who do."

843
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,546
Great quote.

844
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,106
Do you know who said it?

845
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,344
No.

846
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:44,766
Sorry, you just lost three points

847
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,596
and have to move back three spaces.

848
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,905
And you're that much
further from your goal.

849
00:41:48,929 --> 00:41:49,739
(Celeste sighs)

850
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,636
I'm not interested in playing any games.

851
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:53,343
We both need to get more sleep.

852
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,340
You're not even gonna guess who said it?

853
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,896
I guess, you know the answer.

854
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,506
Of course I do.

855
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,280
I'm the one who invented this game.

856
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,956
It's a quote from Steve jobs.

857
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,776
[Celeste] A genius who
is no longer with us.

858
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,066
[Patrick] Do you know why?

859
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:15,900
He died?

860
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:16,926
Of what?

861
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,760
I don't know.

862
00:42:17,784 --> 00:42:21,096
Pancreatic cancer, duh?

863
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,196
See this game educates the players,

864
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,936
plus the money that's paid to play

865
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,906
will go towards research
developing new treatments

866
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,613
and eventually a cure.

867
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,026
You know, the person I
respected the most in the world

868
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,203
died of pancreatic
cancer, Wilma Mankiller.

869
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,976
She was the first woman
chief of the Cherokee Nation.

870
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I know.

871
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,396
And she said, "We must
trust our own thinking,

872
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,311
trust where we're going
and get the job done."

873
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:52,465
(automated cheers)

874
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:53,347
Yes.

875
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,726
But you're not gonna cure cancer

876
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,350
at three o'clock in the morning.

877
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,540
No.

878
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:02,814
(Patrick yawns)
One step at a time.

879
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:07,266
You need to get your
sleep or you won't function.

880
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:09,786
You know, you're lucky I'm
here to take care of you.

881
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:10,952
Yes.

882
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:11,911
(enchanting music)

883
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:13,767
I'm lucky you're here.

884
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:16,521
I agree.

885
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:21,465
(enchanting music)

886
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,167
(Seco grunting)

887
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:25,203
There you go.

888
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,923
We have to be ready
and in place, Grey Horse.

889
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,086
I need you to flank me
at the 50 yard line.

890
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,110
Yes sir.

891
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:41,676
(Secco grunting)

892
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
One more.

893
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,980
All right, take it.

894
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:51,970
Good work.

895
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:53,890
Thanks man.

896
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,506
Be ready to converge on my signal.

897
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,203
If anything looks
suspicious, we take action.

898
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,240
Seco, why are we protecting this guy?

899
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,576
Celeste's orders.

900
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,503
Besides, her and my father
will be on that stage.

901
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,416
Ladies and gentlemen,

902
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,440
the next president of the
United States, Patrick Lee!

903
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:30,898
(audience applauds)

904
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:40,083
Hi, I'm Patrick Lee.

905
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,636
And I'm the first solution candidate

906
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,273
running for the president
of the United States.

907
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,770
I want more than just your
votes, because this campaign

908
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,536
is not just a campaign for the presidency.

909
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,306
It is a campaign that will change

910
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,498
the whole political system.

911
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:02,522
(audience applauds)

912
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,056
Our objective is to find solutions

913
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,226
to the problems facing our
nation and the world around us.

914
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,456
And I'm not going to wait

915
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,123
until I hold the highest
office in this nation.

916
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,566
The process starts right here right now,

917
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:23,166
because we represent the solution we seek.

918
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,143
Blind leading the blind!

919
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,883
Yes, I am legally blind,

920
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,576
but you don't have to have 2020 vision

921
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,076
to be able to find the solutions

922
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,011
to the problems facing us today.

923
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:40,118
(audience applauds)

924
00:45:41,112 --> 00:45:44,173
I will not make any
promises that I cannot keep.

925
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,470
The only promise I will make

926
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,328
is that I won't make any promises.

927
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:54,605
(audience laughing)

928
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:57,156
(audience applauds)

929
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,966
If other candidates are running a sprint,

930
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:02,823
I will be running a marathon.

931
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,443
If they are playing checkers,
I will be playing chess.

932
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,723
This is much more than just
a race and just a game.

933
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,106
I challenge any candidate
seeking this high office

934
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,576
to join me in solving the
problems facing us today

935
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,750
in the United States and around the world.

936
00:46:23,774 --> 00:46:26,774
(audience applauds)

937
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,383
The symbol of our nation
is the majestic eagle.

938
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,973
It represents strength and freedom.

939
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,866
The eagle has two wings, the
right wing and the left wing.

940
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,657
We don't need Cheeks and
savages telling us what to.

941
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:48,490
(gun fires)

942
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,324
(audience gasps)

943
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,347
(people screaming)

944
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,453
Both wings must work in unison,

945
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,636
or the great bird cannot fly.

946
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,636
And these wings will carry this campaign

947
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,813
to Washington and the White House.

948
00:47:08,544 --> 00:47:10,476
[Celeste] Help, call 911!

949
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,706
Patrick, stay with us.

950
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:12,730
Patrick?

951
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:14,481
Help!

952
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:18,421
(speaking in foreign language)

953
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,416
In breaking news;

954
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,996
Independent presidential
candidate, Patrick Lee,

955
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,346
who's branded himself as the
problem solving candidate

956
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:31,626
has a few problems of his own,

957
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,066
after an unidentified gunman
now in police custody,

958
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:39,246
fired upon him when he was giving a speech

959
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,196
on a high school football field.

960
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,416
On the international scene,

961
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,996
the tensions between India and Pakistan

962
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:48,936
over the disputed territory of Kashmir

963
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,023
are continuing to intensify.

964
00:47:51,047 --> 00:47:52,116
(siren wailing)

965
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:52,950
[Sam] Doctor?

966
00:47:52,974 --> 00:47:54,145
[Doctor] Yes.

967
00:47:54,169 --> 00:47:55,566
Doctor, is he gonna be all right?

968
00:47:55,590 --> 00:48:00,590
Yes, fortunately the bullet
missed his vital organ.

969
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,396
We have stopped the bleeding
and closed the wound.

970
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,606
He is out of surgery and
is now in stable condition.

971
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,567
But is he awake?

972
00:48:07,591 --> 00:48:08,613
Can we see him?

973
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:11,890
What is it?

974
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:14,706
It's a skin gun,

975
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,613
it's used during surgery
to replace damaged tissue.

976
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,016
Oh.

977
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,183
Did you use it on me?

978
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,656
It's mainly used for burn
victims and large wounds.

979
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,836
It sprays a small amount
of stem cells on the wound

980
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,096
and it grows into skin,
often hardly leaving a scar.

981
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,913
This is just gonna be a small scar.

982
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,360
(calm music)

983
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:39,194
(Patrick chuckles)

984
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:40,759
Cool.

985
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:42,273
A small scar.

986
00:48:44,143 --> 00:48:47,182
(calm music)

987
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:49,123
Room 437, this is it.

988
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:51,710
I hope he's okay.

989
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:53,151
[Sam] Go ahead.

990
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,176
I didn't know something
like this was gonna happen.

991
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,946
I feel terrible.

992
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,986
What did I do to anger someone so much?

993
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,434
Do you know who did it?

994
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:10,956
You know, they haven't released a name.

995
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,333
We don't know anything yet.

996
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,496
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

997
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,726
But there's a reporter
outside, named Catalina Vargas?

998
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,346
She says she knows you?

999
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,596
Do you think you'd be
up to talking to her?

1000
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,250
Sure, yeah.

1001
00:49:27,274 --> 00:49:30,530
I think she might be able to
answer some of my questions.

1002
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:31,916
Thanks.

1003
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:34,866
Hi Patrick, remember me?

1004
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,076
I was the first reporter
that covered your campaign.

1005
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,633
Yeah, right.

1006
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,366
Hi. Welcome Ms. Vargas.

1007
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,386
You can call me Cat,

1008
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,756
and honestly you look really good

1009
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,780
considering you're recovering
from an assassination attempt.

1010
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,816
Did you know that Theodore Roosevelt

1011
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,906
was shot in the chest during
his campaign for president,

1012
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,826
and he still finished his speech?

1013
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,026
Do you want to see my wound?

1014
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,050
Oh.

1015
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,616
What can you tell us about
the man that shot him?

1016
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,346
We don't have much
information at this time.

1017
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,846
How's he doing?

1018
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,486
Well from what I know,
physically he's doing well.

1019
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,273
But you're concerned for his wellbeing?

1020
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,426
Well, I wanna know why,

1021
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:18,396
why would he shoot me?

1022
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,836
Well, what I can tell you

1023
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,506
is that he has a history of mental illness

1024
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,896
and he was also under
the influence of alcohol.

1025
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,236
[Reporters] Mr. President!

1026
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,626
Mr President!

1027
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,036
[Reporter 1] Mr. President,
what's your response

1028
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,536
to the recent assassination attempt

1029
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,546
on a presidential candidate?

1030
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,096
Well, it's terrible.

1031
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,226
Now I'm not familiar with this individual

1032
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,206
or even that he was a candidate,

1033
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:43,986
but it's an example of just
how dangerous it's becoming

1034
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:47,646
for somebody who wants to
run for an elected office.

1035
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:48,479
Next.

1036
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,312
[Reporters] Mr. President!

1037
00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:50,336
Mr. President!

1038
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,536
[Reporter 2] Are you going
to assign secret service

1039
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,943
to Patrick Lee's campaign?

1040
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,186
Well, it's really not
my decision to make,

1041
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:59,376
that's for secret service to decide.

1042
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,906
Now this candidate doesn't
belong to either political party.

1043
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:06,456
As far as I understand he's
got a very small following,

1044
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,586
so it's not likely,

1045
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,163
but that's really secret
service's decision.

1046
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,956
How's he looking Dr. Zen?

1047
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,506
Healing very well Miss Seedlingsun.

1048
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,836
Mr. Lee, you are making
excellent progress,

1049
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:23,076
but you will need be to in
a wheelchair for a while

1050
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,803
until the swelling around
your spine goes down.

1051
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:27,753
A wheelchair, huh?

1052
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,303
Something to look forward to.

1053
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,126
Well, we'll see.

1054
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:37,086
A lot of people are rooting
for you, myself included.

1055
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,723
A lot of mail is coming
to the hospital for you.

1056
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,546
Best of luck for your campaign.

1057
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,926
Thank you, doctor.

1058
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:44,976
Okay. I gotta go.

1059
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,176
[Patrick] Bring that mail.

1060
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,250
All right, see you.

1061
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:51,172
Wow, do you think that's true?

1062
00:51:51,196 --> 00:51:52,006
(Celeste chuckles)

1063
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,826
You are rising in the polls.

1064
00:51:53,850 --> 00:51:55,446
There's nothing like a good tragedy

1065
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:58,522
for people to rally behind the underdog.

1066
00:51:58,546 --> 00:52:00,346
I hope I can get out of here soon.

1067
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,793
I feel useless.

1068
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,316
What can I do now?

1069
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,436
Win, you can win.

1070
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,386
I'm blind, and autistic.

1071
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,287
And the doctor just told me

1072
00:52:11,311 --> 00:52:14,160
that I have to be in a wheelchair for...

1073
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:15,396
Ugh, who knows how long.

1074
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,226
But your numbers are rising every day,

1075
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,936
you're at 1% in the polls.

1076
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,186
You must forge ahead.

1077
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,117
As an accountant,

1078
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:26,496
I can tell you that 1% isn't
statistically significant.

1079
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,326
Of course it's significant,

1080
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:30,126
people are asking for solutions.

1081
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,466
They're listening to your philosophies.

1082
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:34,526
Now is the time to run with it.

1083
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,756
If only I could.

1084
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,456
Look, you can lay here
and feel sorry for yourself,

1085
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,586
or you can get back to work.

1086
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,926
Well what kind of solutions
are they asking for?

1087
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,246
Because of your situation,

1088
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:48,756
they're asking for a solution
to the gun controversy.

1089
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,093
Okay then, that's what we'll give them.

1090
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:53,196
Okay.

1091
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,326
You have to be in the oval
office to do anything about that.

1092
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:58,206
You don't have the power to do
anything about it right now.

1093
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,243
Well, we don't know that until we try.

1094
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,396
If we can prevent what happened
to me from happening again,

1095
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,163
we can save countless lives.

1096
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,256
How many camping offices have opened

1097
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,599
while I've been laid up here?

1098
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:15,096
[Celeste] Oberoende is
in 10 cities nationwide

1099
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,973
and five countries around
the world have requested it.

1100
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:21,486
Hmm, let's see how much
money has been donated

1101
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:23,316
to solve this particular problem,

1102
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,833
and then we'll decide
what direction to take.

1103
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:29,929
(bright upbeat music)

1104
00:53:45,996 --> 00:53:49,163
(bright upbeat music)

1105
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:57,814
We are gonna miss you, Mr. Lee.

1106
00:53:57,838 --> 00:53:59,856
Now don't work too hard, okay?

1107
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,536
And be careful,

1108
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,360
there looks like there's a
pretty large crowd out there.

1109
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,466
Look, Patrick, there's 100 people

1110
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:10,053
waiting out there for you.

1111
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,713
Come on, let's go greet your public.

1112
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,473
Lose the goggles.

1113
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:20,532
(enchanting music)

1114
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,475
Sam, Secco?

1115
00:54:34,499 --> 00:54:36,544
Great to see you.

1116
00:54:36,568 --> 00:54:39,068
Mr Lee, you forgot your bag!

1117
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:42,927
OMG, is that Patrick Lee?

1118
00:54:42,951 --> 00:54:44,216
(girl screaming excitedly)

1119
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,602
What's going on?

1120
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:48,838
What's happening!

1121
00:54:48,862 --> 00:54:50,503
(gun fires)

1122
00:54:50,527 --> 00:54:52,368
(girl screams)

1123
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:54,108
(dramatic music)

1124
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:55,503
Drop the gun!

1125
00:54:55,527 --> 00:54:57,486
Put your hands behind your back.

1126
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,776
You're under arrest.

1127
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,892
Why?

1128
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:00,726
Why?

1129
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,676
Unlawful discharge of
a firearm, that's why.

1130
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,936
But it was an accident.

1131
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,286
Someone could have been killed!

1132
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:07,206
He's the one who saved Patrick's life.

1133
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,932
Well then you can bail him out

1134
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:10,056
and tell that to the judge.

1135
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,889
Come on, move it.

1136
00:55:10,913 --> 00:55:11,723
Let's go!

1137
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,106
[Sam] Don't worry, Seco, we'll fix this.

1138
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:17,286
Patrick, any comment on
what transpired here today,

1139
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,694
as you were trying to leave the hospital?

1140
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:23,226
(Patrick whimpering)

1141
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:25,626
You can't bring a deadly
weapon into a situation

1142
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,800
and call it protection.

1143
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:29,523
That includes the police.

1144
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:34,026
I could see solving this gun controversy

1145
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,583
is not gonna be easy.

1146
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:38,774
(bright upbeat music)

1147
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:55,545
So the success of the R&D department

1148
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:58,008
has made the manufacturing of the casings,

1149
00:55:58,032 --> 00:56:00,096
especially the small needle,

1150
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,704
they're right to
specification and work great.

1151
00:56:03,728 --> 00:56:06,696
So the neuro toxins are safe, right?

1152
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,426
So our research shows
the tests worked great

1153
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,426
both indoors and outdoors
at various ranges.

1154
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:14,736
Some people are sometimes
confused afterwards,

1155
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,556
but it really works
fine and nobody's hurt.

1156
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:18,580
That's great.

1157
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,786
So anyway, what do you think, Patrick?

1158
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,260
I think we have a solution.

1159
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:25,481
We did that!

1160
00:56:25,505 --> 00:56:27,696
Wow, congratulations guys.

1161
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,986
Wonderful.

1162
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,660
All right, we've been trying
to solve this for a while.

1163
00:56:31,684 --> 00:56:33,411
Yeah.

1164
00:56:33,435 --> 00:56:35,874
(enchanting music)

1165
00:56:35,898 --> 00:56:38,398
(all applaud)

1166
00:56:47,669 --> 00:56:49,813
(birds chirping)

1167
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:52,806
Thank you for coming
to our press conference.

1168
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,486
Patrick Lee's campaign polling

1169
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:57,306
has wavered between one
and two percentage points,

1170
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,216
so I am aware that most of you assigned

1171
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,196
to cover this press conference

1172
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:06,306
are either fledgling reporters
or well seasoned pros

1173
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,946
who may well be in line to be replaced

1174
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:10,683
by fledgling reporters.

1175
00:57:10,707 --> 00:57:11,517
(all laugh)

1176
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:14,586
Well, we have good news for you,

1177
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:18,513
because today maybe the
turning point in your career.

1178
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:22,626
Patrick Lee is the
first solution candidate

1179
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,546
for the presidency.

1180
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:29,106
Today, we will be revealing
one of those solutions,

1181
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:32,286
a solution that will
hopefully save hundreds,

1182
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,953
perhaps thousands of lives.

1183
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:37,566
Here to explain it to you

1184
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:42,590
is the next president of the
United States, Patrick Lee.

1185
00:57:43,908 --> 00:57:46,408
(all applaud)

1186
00:57:50,692 --> 00:57:53,442
(birds chirping)

1187
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:56,230
Good afternoon.

1188
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,856
As many of you may know,

1189
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,373
I was recently a victim of gun violence.

1190
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,226
And it bothered me greatly

1191
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,086
to think that others
may have to go through

1192
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,513
such a traumatic experience.

1193
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:13,116
The second amendment of our constitution

1194
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:16,806
guarantees the right of
citizens to bear arms,

1195
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:21,696
both for sport and to protect
themselves and their families.

1196
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,526
Conversely, other citizens may
feel that in the modern era,

1197
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,556
with the protection of the
police and the military,

1198
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,706
there's no need to have private firearms

1199
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,926
which may lead to mayhem

1200
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,963
in the hands of unscrupulous people.

1201
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,976
Today, after working with
over Oberoende organizations

1202
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,186
across the United States
and around the world,

1203
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,243
I want to announce our
solution to the problem.

1204
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:51,171
(woman gasps)

1205
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,476
Smart Magic.

1206
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,666
But before I answer your questions,

1207
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,973
I would like to demonstrate Smart Magic.

1208
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:00,509
And to demonstrate any type of magic,

1209
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:03,033
we will need a volunteer
from the audience.

1210
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:05,420
How about the woman in green?

1211
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:07,395
Okay.

1212
00:59:07,419 --> 00:59:10,236
Excuse me, I would need
to wear these to see

1213
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,703
because I'm legally blind.

1214
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,876
I know politicians have
a thing about the press.

1215
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,936
You're not gonna use me for
target practice, are you?

1216
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:19,956
Oh no, no.

1217
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,136
Don't worry, I won't shoot you.

1218
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,476
Please, introduce yourself.

1219
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,450
Susan Wright with Channel Three News.

1220
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,093
Great, follow me.

1221
00:59:39,223 --> 00:59:42,276
(gun fires)

1222
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,106
Wow, that was a great shot.

1223
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,903
Thanks, your turn.

1224
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,720
Aim at the center of the target,

1225
00:59:50,742 --> 00:59:51,742
and pull the trigger.

1226
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,700
Try it again.

1227
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,596
What's wrong?

1228
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,826
It won't fire.

1229
00:59:59,850 --> 01:00:01,806
That's because it's a smart gun.

1230
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:04,230
Only someone who's
programmed for it can use it.

1231
01:00:05,073 --> 01:00:06,616
Oh wow.

1232
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,433
Now, try this one?

1233
01:00:13,236 --> 01:00:15,486
(gun fires)

1234
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,616
Almost no kickback.

1235
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,826
You just shot a magic
tranquilizer bullet,

1236
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,263
virtually no recoil.

1237
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:26,076
Anyone else wanna try?

1238
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,636
Hello, Uncle Mitch?

1239
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,076
Hi, this is Susan.

1240
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,846
I heard you were in LA?

1241
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,216
Look, this is no standard
press conference.

1242
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:36,006
You have to get a media
van out here right away.

1243
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:38,922
Oh, and if we have a firearms
expert, send them too.

1244
01:00:38,946 --> 01:00:41,346
(gun fires)

1245
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,056
Wow, that's fantastic.

1246
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,080
Thanks.

1247
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,254
And that ladies and
gentlemen is Smart Magic.

1248
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:49,088
(audience applauds)

1249
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,620
I want you all to give this a shot,

1250
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,966
but we also wanna answer
all of your questions.

1251
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,166
But before we do so,

1252
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:59,883
I wanna take this opportunity
to announce my running mate.

1253
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,516
I'm sure some of you have already guessed.

1254
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,306
Please welcome the next vice president

1255
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,005
of the United States Celeste Seedlingsun.

1256
01:01:10,029 --> 01:01:13,029
(audience applauds)

1257
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,220
Thank you.

1258
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,287
This is more like it.

1259
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:19,327
(all laugh)

1260
01:01:19,351 --> 01:01:20,161
[Woman] All right!

1261
01:01:20,185 --> 01:01:22,386
We know we have a difficult race to run,

1262
01:01:22,410 --> 01:01:24,036
and it doesn't take a blind man

1263
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,626
to see that America needs
visionary leadership

1264
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,877
to tackle the problems that
affect us all as human beings.

1265
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:36,186
(all applaud)

1266
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,136
We will now take questions.

1267
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:38,970
Celeste.

1268
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:41,471
(all clamor)

1269
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,346
Is this brand new weaponry

1270
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,496
that you guys are using and
introducing in your campaign?

1271
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,696
Not exactly, it is all
based on existing technology.

1272
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,546
A smart gun technology
has been around for years

1273
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,006
and tranquilizing projectiles

1274
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:59,556
have been used on animals for decades.

1275
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:03,156
We've combined the two into Smart Magic,

1276
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:05,398
smart guns, magic bullets.

1277
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:07,839
(all clamor)

1278
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,283
Aren't you Mitch Morgan from INN?

1279
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:16,446
Yes I am, thank you for having me here.

1280
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,866
So these bullets can stop an attacker?

1281
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:24,546
Yes, and their accuracy is far superior.

1282
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:28,326
How fast can this so-called
bullet take someone down?

1283
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,366
Well, there are two chemicals involved;

1284
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,346
The first is a mild neurotoxin

1285
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:35,676
that causes immediate effect
on the nervous system.

1286
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,836
The second is the tranquilizer

1287
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,176
that slows down all bodily functions,

1288
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,366
rendering the attacker unconscious.

1289
01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:43,675
[Reporter 3] Patrick, how did you-

1290
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:45,663
(calm music)

1291
01:02:45,687 --> 01:02:47,976
(birds chirping)

1292
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,776
Usually, public demonstrations

1293
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,236
highlight or expose a problem,

1294
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,076
but we will be demonstrating
solutions to those problems.

1295
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,276
Our objective is to find
solutions and to promote them.

1296
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:04,656
Today we pro walk for smart magic.

1297
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,647
All right.

1298
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:06,788
[Man] Yeah.

1299
01:03:06,812 --> 01:03:09,876
A pro walk is neither
a march nor a protest.

1300
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,366
A march has military connotations

1301
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:15,426
and a protest is against something.

1302
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:18,336
A pro walk is always positive.

1303
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:22,053
It's always for something
never against anything.

1304
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,736
Here we have the Smart Magic
sweatsuits we designed for you.

1305
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,226
As we wear our hearts on our sleeves,

1306
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:36,456
so must we wear our
feelings and our beliefs.

1307
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,436
In our pro walk, we will
wear our words and thoughts.

1308
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,776
We don't need to carry large signs

1309
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,813
that could be used as a weapon.

1310
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,296
We are not going to walk in a huge crowd

1311
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,053
that can, to some, seem threatening.

1312
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,556
We'll walk single file, five feet apart.

1313
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,116
When a light turns red,

1314
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:02,556
please wait patiently for it
to change before continuing

1315
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,580
so no intersections are blocked
and no one is left behind.

1316
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:10,385
(calm music)

1317
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,833
Today is our first pro
hike for Smart Magic.

1318
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:40,236
If we take our time and
help each other along,

1319
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,756
we will all reach the top together

1320
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,683
and make a powerful
statement to the world.

1321
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:51,682
(enchanting music)

1322
01:04:51,706 --> 01:04:56,706
Come on guys.

1323
01:05:08,428 --> 01:05:11,345
(enchanting music)

1324
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:22,373
(enchanting music)

1325
01:05:22,397 --> 01:05:23,397
Yeah!

1326
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,247
Woo!

1327
01:05:40,223 --> 01:05:43,386
(upbeat music)

1328
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,606
The independent candidate for president,

1329
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:49,026
Patrick Lee's solution
to the gun controversy

1330
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:51,936
is using Smart Magic technology.

1331
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,306
Now he and his group made quite a splash

1332
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:58,146
in Los Angeles this weekend,
as they hosted a pro walk.

1333
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:01,206
You'll also see a sign
that is bigger, brighter,

1334
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:03,096
and visible only at night.

1335
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,866
Now folks, it comes down tomorrow,

1336
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:08,736
so if you wanna get a selfie,
tonight is your last chance.

1337
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,697
Hey, Hey!

1338
01:06:09,721 --> 01:06:11,076
Ho, ho!

1339
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:13,326
Smart Magic's got to go.

1340
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:18,012
Four, three, two, one,
keep your hands off my gun!

1341
01:06:18,036 --> 01:06:19,386
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1342
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,220
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1343
01:06:20,244 --> 01:06:22,146
Smart Magic's got to go.

1344
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:24,636
Scenes like this are
happening around the country.

1345
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,726
Protests and boycotts against gun shops

1346
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,726
that have decided to carry Smart Magic.

1347
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,336
Some reports claim the
National Gun Association

1348
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,346
is behind these boycotts,

1349
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,473
but the NGA has officially denied it.

1350
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:39,123
Are we ready with plan B?

1351
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:42,936
Well, we have applications
for Smart Magic franchises,

1352
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,606
for entrepreneurs across the country.

1353
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,666
We're gonna have a few stores
up and running really soon.

1354
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:51,546
We're here with Judy and Alex Robertson,

1355
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:55,716
franchise owners of a
Smart Magic gun shop.

1356
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,946
They are two survivors

1357
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:00,813
of what is now being called
the Smart Magic Massacre.

1358
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:03,243
What time did this take place?

1359
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,616
It was about 2:00 AM, Judy
and I plus one of our employees

1360
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,446
had stayed late to get everything ready

1361
01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:11,796
for today's grand opening.

1362
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:13,916
And we had just turned the lights out

1363
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,006
and we were about to head home.

1364
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:17,886
That's when we saw like
the flickering lights

1365
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:20,346
coming towards us
through the front window,

1366
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:24,516
and we received several death threats.

1367
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,203
So we were obviously already nervous.

1368
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:32,796
I thought we were gonna die.

1369
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,787
It's okay.

1370
01:07:33,811 --> 01:07:34,983
We're safe now, dear.

1371
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,970
We've obtained security
camera footage of the incident.

1372
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,196
The footage you're about
to see is pretty graphic,

1373
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,223
so we must ask for viewer
discretion before watching.

1374
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,246
[Alex] They approached
the front of the shop

1375
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:54,306
so we grabbed some Smart
Magic firearms and ammo.

1376
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,916
They were prepared for confrontation

1377
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,916
and they were wearing body
armor, they were well armed.

1378
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,086
You can see there.

1379
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,576
We hit that man on the
leg with the magic bullet,

1380
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,601
the guy went down in seconds.

1381
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:07,176
(gunshots ringing)
(alarm bell ringing)

1382
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,276
Our building alarm was triggered

1383
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,433
and all three of us started firing back.

1384
01:08:12,475 --> 01:08:13,896
(siren wailing)

1385
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,176
[Reporter] Alex is that
you saving that man's life?

1386
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,396
[Alex] We could hear
the sirens approaching,

1387
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,396
any of the attackers that were
still conscious had run off.

1388
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,606
So I felt it was safe
that we put out the flame

1389
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:26,430
before the guy was seriously burned.

1390
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:30,846
(radio chatter)

1391
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,606
But one question, your
attackers are wearing body armor,

1392
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:39,153
how were you able to take them out?

1393
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:42,666
We were just aiming for their arms,

1394
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,436
their legs, their butts,

1395
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,706
like any place that was
vulnerable to our ammo.

1396
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:50,376
So none of them were
permanently injured?

1397
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,283
No, we're told they're
conscious and under arrest.

1398
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,276
Wow, they went down so fast.

1399
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,686
We're just as surprised as you are.

1400
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,966
I mean, we'd heard all about this weaponry

1401
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:03,186
when we decided to open
a Smart Magic franchise,

1402
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:06,936
but we never expected
it to be this effective.

1403
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,846
And if it wasn't, we'd be dead.

1404
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:13,116
Other reports from Smart Magic
locations throughout the US

1405
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,973
show sales skyrocketing.

1406
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:18,726
Several major cities across the US

1407
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,196
have asked to test the weapons

1408
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:22,986
for their city's police departments.

1409
01:09:23,010 --> 01:09:26,106
Even the leaders of the
National Gun Association,

1410
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:28,176
who were originally skeptical,

1411
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,426
have asked to meet with
presidential candidate, Patrick Lee.

1412
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,950
(all applaud)

1413
01:09:35,785 --> 01:09:38,376
We have had a long and
fruitful discussion with Mr. Lee

1414
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,756
and Miss Seedlingsun,

1415
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,396
along with members of
the gun control lobby.

1416
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,286
We have come to the conclusion
that we are in support

1417
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:46,510
of this new solution
to the gun controversy.

1418
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:48,996
While we originally thought Smart Magic

1419
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,916
would give a false sense of security

1420
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:52,566
to those who wanted to protect themselves

1421
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:53,736
and their families,

1422
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:55,506
we now accept that it has been proven

1423
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:57,936
to be a viable weapon system.

1424
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,256
So much so that the NGA is
joining the gun control lobby

1425
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:05,016
to back Patrick Lee's run for president

1426
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,243
of the United States.

1427
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:10,026
Presidential Dark Horse Patrick Lee

1428
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,006
stopped by the White House this afternoon

1429
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:14,673
after having a very successful
meeting with the NGA.

1430
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,546
Now it has been confirmed
that he is up 15%

1431
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:19,896
in the national polls

1432
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,866
and has also been invited
to join democratic

1433
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:26,316
and Republican nominees for
the first presidential debate.

1434
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,836
Now this should make
for a very interesting

1435
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,246
and amazing opportunity

1436
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:33,246
to see him in the presidential debate.

1437
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,946
And now onto international news.

1438
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:38,856
The border dispute
between India and Pakistan

1439
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,626
continues to escalate,

1440
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,713
which causes more
concern around the world.

1441
01:10:44,713 --> 01:10:47,130
(calm music)

1442
01:11:02,876 --> 01:11:05,876
(keyboard clatters)

1443
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,300
What are those figures?

1444
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:14,796
Have you been working
on this the entire time

1445
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:16,773
instead of rehearsing for the debate?

1446
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:22,356
Well, I think I just
solved another problem.

1447
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,733
Oh, what?

1448
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,063
I discovered how to
eliminate national debt.

1449
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,946
Are you kidding?

1450
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:33,003
You think I spent all that
time just for the fun of it?

1451
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,963
Oh, my neck is killing me.

1452
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,606
Well, I've actually been spending

1453
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,926
a lot of time planning this,

1454
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,683
but the missing part of the
solution just came to me.

1455
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,116
Wait, so that's a formula

1456
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,183
for eliminating the national debt?

1457
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,336
Yeah, by cryptocurrency.

1458
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,056
I mean, it's not like E equals
MC squared, but it'll work.

1459
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,047
Wow, okay.

1460
01:11:59,071 --> 01:12:01,720
This is gonna really give
us a hand up in the debate.

1461
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,020
Oh, I can't use this
for the debate actually.

1462
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,356
Why not?

1463
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,946
Well, because I have to implement it

1464
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:11,171
when I'm in the White House.

1465
01:12:11,195 --> 01:12:13,116
So?

1466
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:13,957
Did you forget?

1467
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:17,646
We made a promise not
to make any promises.

1468
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:19,733
Okay, but this could
really put us ahead.

1469
01:12:19,757 --> 01:12:22,596
No, we have to keep this under wraps.

1470
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:24,783
I can't believe I
didn't see this coming.

1471
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,666
Is there anything else
you've been keeping from me?

1472
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:35,433
Well, I have a plan for
eliminating federal income tax.

1473
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,253
Can we use that in a debate?

1474
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,143
No.

1475
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,576
What are we even training for

1476
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,126
if we can't use all of your ammunition?

1477
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,156
Well, we can use whatever
we've already accomplished.

1478
01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:51,063
Okay, but if we win, we can use it then?

1479
01:12:52,302 --> 01:12:55,593
Yeah, but we still need the
Congress to go along with it.

1480
01:12:56,853 --> 01:12:57,663
Okay.

1481
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:58,896
(enchanting music)

1482
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,663
I'll figure out how to say it
without making any promises.

1483
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,546
Your hair is getting too long,

1484
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,616
we have to cut it before the debate.

1485
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,086
Don't wait up for me.

1486
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:12,696
I've got a presentation
with some top educators

1487
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,036
about our new way of running
the nations' schools.

1488
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,686
Wish me luck.

1489
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:18,936
Well, with your powers of persuasion,

1490
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,313
you don't need any luck.

1491
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:25,986
No more playing with numbers.

1492
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,366
Focus on the campaign

1493
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,273
and memorize those talking points.

1494
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,911
(keyboard clatters)

1495
01:13:39,935 --> 01:13:42,352
(calm music)

1496
01:14:06,427 --> 01:14:09,177
(dramatic music)

1497
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:18,814
("Oberoende Anthem")

1498
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:21,331
Who is it?

1499
01:14:23,298 --> 01:14:25,356
(knocking on door)

1500
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,826
Back already?

1501
01:14:26,850 --> 01:14:28,233
Did you lose your key card?

1502
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:32,706
(enchanting music)

1503
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:35,706
Barb, what are you doing here?

1504
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:36,730
I wanna talk.

1505
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:38,583
About what?

1506
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,050
Let me in.

1507
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:44,620
I don't think that's a good idea.

1508
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,230
What would you suggest?

1509
01:14:51,182 --> 01:14:53,166
Why?

1510
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:54,243
After all this time.

1511
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:58,780
I miss you.

1512
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:01,863
You really hurt me.

1513
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:06,933
You still love me, don't you?

1514
01:15:08,308 --> 01:15:13,210
Of course I do, you're the
one who broke up with me.

1515
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,080
I changed my mind.

1516
01:15:20,537 --> 01:15:24,403
I've been calling you, but
you refuse to talk to me.

1517
01:15:27,342 --> 01:15:30,243
I've been a little tied up.

1518
01:15:30,267 --> 01:15:32,043
You always used to say you loved me,

1519
01:15:32,067 --> 01:15:33,753
but you never had time for me.

1520
01:15:37,230 --> 01:15:41,136
I'm sorry, I was busy with my clients,

1521
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,393
growing the business.

1522
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,283
Yeah, just like you're
busy with your campaign.

1523
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,920
We haven't seen each
other in all this time.

1524
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:53,853
What changed?

1525
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:58,143
I'm older now, more mature.

1526
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:01,790
I think we could really make it work.

1527
01:16:03,596 --> 01:16:06,013
(calm music)

1528
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,720
We had some really good times up here.

1529
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:17,440
Remember that one time

1530
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:21,753
where you and I were fooling around naked,

1531
01:16:23,490 --> 01:16:25,203
and that helicopter flew over?

1532
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,326
You know, we could try it again.

1533
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:35,350
Now that it's dark.

1534
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,850
I really don't know.

1535
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:43,520
I have a whole new life now.

1536
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:47,733
I know, I miss you.

1537
01:16:50,182 --> 01:16:52,083
We were meant to be together.

1538
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:55,570
I know that now.

1539
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,913
If I felt that you really meant that.

1540
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:07,820
I still love you, but
you broke up with me,

1541
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:10,503
and when I really needed you the most.

1542
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,493
I was losing my sight
and the belief in myself,

1543
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:20,793
and you just made it worse.

1544
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:24,726
I'll make it up to you.

1545
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,106
I promise, Pat.

1546
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:28,743
Please, just give me a chance.

1547
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:33,889
(calm music)

1548
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:39,123
Wait, you're not doing this
for your citizenship, are you?

1549
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:41,970
No.

1550
01:17:42,814 --> 01:17:44,164
No, I've got my green card.

1551
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:48,020
We could tie the knot,

1552
01:17:49,597 --> 01:17:51,740
we could make this official.

1553
01:17:51,764 --> 01:17:53,432
I have to think about this.

1554
01:17:53,456 --> 01:17:54,956
No, don't think.

1555
01:17:56,017 --> 01:18:00,963
We could make this work
with me as your wife.

1556
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:04,953
I get it, you really think I can win.

1557
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,593
Yes, with me by your side.

1558
01:18:12,266 --> 01:18:15,393
You don't love me,
you wanna be first lady.

1559
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:20,883
Yes, but I also love you.

1560
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:23,913
We make the perfect team.

1561
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,993
Your brains, my beauty.

1562
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,750
I may be blind, but I
can see right through you.

1563
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,100
We've been together way
too long for me not to.

1564
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,469
What are you saying?

1565
01:18:39,493 --> 01:18:41,013
I'm saying we're through,

1566
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,900
like what you said when you broke it off.

1567
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:48,336
You son of a bitch!

1568
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:50,316
No cussing, please.

1569
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,296
You think you're so powerful

1570
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,796
now that you're gonna debate the big guys?

1571
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,706
Well, I'm not so helpless
that I can't bring you down.

1572
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,886
Well fine, go ahead and try.

1573
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:01,116
I don't care.

1574
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:04,296
You forget, I worked
with you in the office.

1575
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,186
I know all of your secrets.

1576
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:07,710
Well, you got nothing on me.

1577
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,116
You think you have the upper hand?

1578
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,963
Yes, I think I finally do.

1579
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:19,053
We'll see about that.

1580
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,046
You'll miss me when I'm gone.

1581
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,486
No, I won't.

1582
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:31,536
And ever since you left,

1583
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,527
I learned how to stand on my own two feet.

1584
01:19:37,432 --> 01:19:40,146
(Patrick groans)

1585
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:41,253
I can see that.

1586
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,103
Goodbye, Mr. President.

1587
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:55,053
He's all yours bitch!

1588
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:04,030
I'm waiting.

1589
01:20:05,215 --> 01:20:06,215
Oh gosh.

1590
01:20:08,093 --> 01:20:09,093
That was Barb.

1591
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:11,020
Who?

1592
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:16,326
My ex-girlfriend, she
wanted to get back together.

1593
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,676
Ow.

1594
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,406
Well you two did a fine job.

1595
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:22,773
I can't believe I didn't foresee this.

1596
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:27,003
Ow, my good leg!

1597
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,313
Barb and I are over, we're finished.

1598
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,213
You never told me about her, why?

1599
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,213
She's young and attractive,

1600
01:20:49,894 --> 01:20:52,811
I just didn't want you to be upset.

1601
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:57,473
I don't wanna lose you.

1602
01:20:57,497 --> 01:21:00,426
But we don't have that
kind of relationship,

1603
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,776
it's only business.

1604
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,423
Yeah, I know.

1605
01:21:04,647 --> 01:21:06,723
But I just thought maybe.

1606
01:21:10,085 --> 01:21:11,300
When we first met...

1607
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:14,740
Never mind.

1608
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:20,493
I have been so dishonest.

1609
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:23,917
I can't believe it.

1610
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:27,213
You gave up everything for
me, you've been honest.

1611
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:34,716
I don't think I can do this anymore.

1612
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:37,143
Come on, don't give up, okay?

1613
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:42,243
I haven't been entirely
honest with you either.

1614
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,040
Really?

1615
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:50,193
I'm a seer.

1616
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,866
Yeah, you've been my eyes and my voice.

1617
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,725
I can't thank you enough.

1618
01:21:57,749 --> 01:21:59,376
No, no, no, no, you don't understand.

1619
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:02,166
I never saw or heard you
announce your candidacy

1620
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:03,190
for the president.

1621
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:09,530
Before the day we met, I had
a vision of it, like a dream.

1622
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,253
I have visions, I'm a seer.

1623
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:18,306
And you came all the way from Oklahoma

1624
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:22,773
to help me with the
president, the presidency?

1625
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,473
Not exactly.

1626
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,393
My vision was that I would be president.

1627
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:34,105
(elevator dings)

1628
01:22:34,129 --> 01:22:36,816
(upbeat music)

1629
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,106
Ladies and gentlemen,

1630
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,076
welcome to the first presidential debate.

1631
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,406
I'm Roberta Ann Bartlett,
your moderator for tonight,

1632
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:48,156
coming to you live from
Eastern Missouri University

1633
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,746
in St. Louis.

1634
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:52,446
At the podium to the right, we
have Senator William Dempsey.

1635
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:54,402
He's the Republican nominee for president.

1636
01:22:54,426 --> 01:22:56,156
(audience applauds)

1637
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,786
On your left at the podium,

1638
01:22:57,810 --> 01:22:59,739
we have Governor John MCC McCadden.

1639
01:22:59,763 --> 01:23:00,573
(audience applauds)

1640
01:23:00,597 --> 01:23:03,066
And he is the democratic
candidate for president.

1641
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,496
We are getting started a few minutes late,

1642
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,196
we've been waiting for
word from Patrick Lee.

1643
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,596
He's the independent
candidate for president,

1644
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:12,456
as to whether he is going to be able

1645
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,956
to make the debate tonight,

1646
01:23:13,980 --> 01:23:16,716
so unfortunately we will
have to start the debate

1647
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:17,946
without him.

1648
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:19,926
I know how much he wanted to be here

1649
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:23,016
since he lept to 15%
in the national polls,

1650
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,806
so we will leave his podium on stage

1651
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:29,076
in the event he arrives
to the debate late.

1652
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:32,226
I was going to ask the first
question of Patrick Lee,

1653
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,046
instead I will ask the two of you.

1654
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:39,126
What is your opinion of candidate Lee?

1655
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,233
Senator Dempsey.

1656
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,806
Well, I don't think he's
prepared to be president.

1657
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,176
He has no real experience

1658
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:49,896
in any international or
public service position,

1659
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,716
and he's not a member
of any political party.

1660
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:55,626
For once, I pretty much agree with Bill.

1661
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:58,806
Lee's lack of experience may be the reason

1662
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,546
he is not here tonight.

1663
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:04,656
The presidency is a
very demanding position.

1664
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:08,736
You have to know every aspect
of running this country

1665
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:09,966
and dealing with other countries.

1666
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:14,826
You have to know everything,
from education and employment-

1667
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:16,386
Hi Sam.

1668
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,036
Excuse me, Mr. Brightcloud.

1669
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,526
Do you know what happened to Patrick Lee?

1670
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:23,731
Do you know why he's not
at the presidential debate?

1671
01:24:23,755 --> 01:24:25,176
No comment.

1672
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:26,010
But-

1673
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:27,549
No.

1674
01:24:27,573 --> 01:24:28,896
Cut.

1675
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,320
Can you tell us where
candidate Lee is hiding?

1676
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:33,936
No comment.

1677
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:35,343
And Miss Seedling, sir?

1678
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:37,630
Same answer.

1679
01:24:42,086 --> 01:24:42,966
(Davies shrieks)

1680
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:43,990
I know karate.

1681
01:24:44,806 --> 01:24:45,667
Is this TMZ?

1682
01:24:45,691 --> 01:24:47,466
Mr. Davies, we met before.

1683
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:49,986
You're one of Patrick Lee's CPA clients,

1684
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:51,316
he did your taxes.

1685
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,346
Yeah, he said everything
was legit, right?

1686
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:55,356
Do you buy any chance
know where he is tonight?

1687
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,966
He was supposed to be at
the presidential debate.

1688
01:24:57,990 --> 01:24:59,136
It's not over, is it?

1689
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,636
Well, no.

1690
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:03,126
Look, I know Patrick,
we're really close.

1691
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:05,316
And if I know my man, he'll
make a dramatic entrance

1692
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,836
at the last minute and steal the show.

1693
01:25:07,860 --> 01:25:10,176
Well, you heard it here first, folks.

1694
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:13,116
Patrick Lee is either
going to steal the show

1695
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,346
or be a no-show.

1696
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:17,166
I'm gonna toss it back
to you in the studios.

1697
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,896
Well, this has been
a very fruitful debate.

1698
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,886
You did not agree on your answers
to the topics put forward,

1699
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:28,416
so I think the public has a
very clear idea before them.

1700
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,846
Something has happened
over the last few days

1701
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,556
that has threatened this nation

1702
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,806
and also the rest of the world.

1703
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:37,236
As you know, the longstanding conflict

1704
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,316
between India and Pakistan
has flared up again.

1705
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:43,806
Thousands of individuals have died

1706
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:45,576
on the border between these two countries

1707
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,256
and now the leaders are threatening

1708
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,923
to use nuclear weapons on each other.

1709
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:54,576
If that happens, millions more will die

1710
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,493
if this is not deescalated.

1711
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,236
What do each of you feel should be done

1712
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,126
to resolve the situation?

1713
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:05,016
First to you, Governor McCadden.

1714
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,806
Since we are not one
of the two adversaries

1715
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:09,456
in this conflict,

1716
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:14,436
I feel it is an important
task for the United Nations.

1717
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,376
They have already gone
into emergency sessions

1718
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,666
in this situation,

1719
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:22,086
and I am hopeful that
the nations of the world

1720
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,806
will be able to figure something
out and end this conflict.

1721
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:29,256
After all, India and Pakistan

1722
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:33,036
have a population of
over 2 billion people,

1723
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,366
and combined they have
enough nuclear weapons

1724
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:39,156
to not only kill their own populations,

1725
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:44,076
but enough to end all of life on earth.

1726
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:45,636
Senator Dempsey.

1727
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:49,056
Well, I disagree with John
on this important point.

1728
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,293
This is a conflict between
two sovereign nations.

1729
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:56,016
Yes, both sides have attacked each other.

1730
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:59,586
Both sides have crossed
one another's borders.

1731
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:02,106
Both sides have suffered casualties.

1732
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:03,486
And at this point it appears

1733
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:07,266
that both leaders are hot heads.

1734
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:08,826
But I believe this is a situation

1735
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:10,176
where the two must come together

1736
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,576
to bring an end to this conflict.

1737
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,796
Thank you for your heartfelt responses.

1738
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:17,583
We are now gonna go to
your closing statements.

1739
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,693
Wait, wait, I'm getting
an important bulletin.

1740
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:25,146
It seems there has been a secret meeting

1741
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:27,453
between the leaders of India and Pakistan,

1742
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:31,716
and they've seemingly
resolved their conflict.

1743
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,696
As we speak, troops are moving back

1744
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,706
across their respective borders

1745
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:38,316
and all hostilities have ceased.

1746
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:39,546
It seems your answer,

1747
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:42,423
Senator Dempsey is actually taking place.

1748
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:44,406
Thank God.

1749
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:46,566
Now we can have an election after all.

1750
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:47,590
What?

1751
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,400
Can you put that on the back screen?

1752
01:27:51,747 --> 01:27:53,316
(audience gasps)

1753
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:56,316
We're receiving the official photograph

1754
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:58,476
of this groundbreaking meeting

1755
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,461
that occurred less than an hour ago.

1756
01:28:00,485 --> 01:28:03,568
(audience applauds)

1757
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,376
The Associated Press,

1758
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,317
(speaking in foreign language)

1759
01:28:15,550 --> 01:28:18,186
(dramatic music)

1760
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,216
Well, nobody could have
predicted what transpired tonight.

1761
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,216
It looks like we have just
received a preliminary poll

1762
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,496
of this evening's presidential debate.

1763
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:28,746
Are you sure this is accurate?

1764
01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:31,596
Apparently the numbers
have been confirmed.

1765
01:28:31,620 --> 01:28:33,966
The results of our instantaneous poll

1766
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:35,526
on who the American people feel

1767
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:38,076
won this evening's presidential debate;

1768
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:41,406
At 28% governor John McCadden.

1769
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:44,316
32%, Senator William Dempsey.

1770
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:49,340
And at an amazing 40%, independent
candidate, Patrick Lee.

1771
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,406
Apparently Mr. Lee has won a debate,

1772
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:55,446
he did not even attend.

1773
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:57,126
We have now learned that the meeting

1774
01:28:57,150 --> 01:28:59,616
between the leaders of India and Pakistan

1775
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,736
with Patrick Lee and Celeste Seedlingsun

1776
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,386
have now been arranged

1777
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:08,436
by Oberoende India and Oberoende Pakistan.

1778
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,326
Now it is also confirmed

1779
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:15,350
that in addition to Oberoende
existing in all 50 US states,

1780
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,863
they are also in over
100 nations worldwide.

1781
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:23,196
In a stunning development
early this morning,

1782
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:26,466
federal agents raided
the campaign headquarters

1783
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:27,723
of Patrick Lee.

1784
01:29:28,710 --> 01:29:32,526
Taking computers, file
cabinets, literally everything

1785
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,836
they could get their hands on.

1786
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,296
Acting on an anonymous tip,

1787
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:38,556
they are looking for items

1788
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:41,706
related to his former CPA business.

1789
01:29:41,730 --> 01:29:45,096
There are allegations that
his handling of client taxes

1790
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,383
may be in question.

1791
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,076
We have also heard there may be evidence

1792
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:52,986
that the attempted assassination plot

1793
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:55,266
may have been hatched and carried out

1794
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:57,489
by his own campaign team.

1795
01:29:57,513 --> 01:29:58,384
[Reporters] Mr. President!

1796
01:29:58,408 --> 01:29:59,659
Mr. President!

1797
01:29:59,683 --> 01:30:01,073
Mr. President!

1798
01:30:01,097 --> 01:30:01,907
[Reporter 4] Mr. President,

1799
01:30:01,931 --> 01:30:03,486
do you have any comment on the recent raid

1800
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:05,616
on Patrick Lee's campaign headquarters?

1801
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,876
There's a rumor going around

1802
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:08,763
that you knew about it beforehand.

1803
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:12,876
That's not true, okay?

1804
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:14,856
Patently false.

1805
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:17,196
We found out about it as it happened,

1806
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,596
just the same as you did.

1807
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,497
Next question please.

1808
01:30:20,521 --> 01:30:21,721
[Reporters] Mr. President!

1809
01:30:21,745 --> 01:30:22,679
Mr. President!

1810
01:30:22,703 --> 01:30:23,647
Mr. President!

1811
01:30:23,671 --> 01:30:25,116
[Reporter 5] Yeah, but isn't it strange

1812
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:27,216
that it happened right after
he took the lead in the polls

1813
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,373
and right before arriving back in the US?

1814
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,826
This is an inconsequential
candidate, okay?

1815
01:30:35,850 --> 01:30:38,406
He's not on a ballot in any state,

1816
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,236
and this was a coordinated joint effort

1817
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:42,546
between the IRS and the FBI.

1818
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:45,366
And frankly, it should be
solved before the election

1819
01:30:45,390 --> 01:30:49,176
so a cloud of distrust doesn't
hang over, Mr. Lee's head.

1820
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:50,167
[Reporter 5] So are you saying

1821
01:30:50,191 --> 01:30:52,386
that you agree with the raid?

1822
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:54,096
I didn't say that.

1823
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:57,636
I said, I understand
how these agencies work

1824
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,226
and they're just doing their jobs.

1825
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,928
No more questions until
we have more information.

1826
01:31:01,952 --> 01:31:02,997
[Reporters] Mr. President!

1827
01:31:03,021 --> 01:31:04,047
Mr. President!

1828
01:31:04,071 --> 01:31:04,880
Mr. President!

1829
01:31:04,904 --> 01:31:05,714
(bright upbeat music)

1830
01:31:05,738 --> 01:31:09,932
It's wonderful to see so
many friends here tonight.

1831
01:31:09,956 --> 01:31:11,619
Now I wanna remind you all

1832
01:31:11,643 --> 01:31:15,419
that Mr. Lee is not on
the ballot of any state,

1833
01:31:15,443 --> 01:31:18,996
so you must write in his name
on your ballot as president

1834
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,243
when you vote this November.

1835
01:31:22,821 --> 01:31:23,630
Are you nervous?

1836
01:31:23,654 --> 01:31:24,518
Yes.

1837
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:26,308
Tell me what's bothering you?

1838
01:31:26,332 --> 01:31:27,626
I didn't do anything wrong,

1839
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:29,076
and the whole government's
coming down at me.

1840
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:32,556
Don't worry, the establishment's
just getting desperate.

1841
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:33,780
This will all blow over.

1842
01:31:34,830 --> 01:31:36,036
You came outta nowhere

1843
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:38,110
and they don't know how to deal with you.

1844
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:40,386
They're grasping at straws.

1845
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,660
They have nothing on you.

1846
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:43,498
I know that,

1847
01:31:44,264 --> 01:31:46,577
but how do you know?

1848
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:49,713
I just know, trust me.

1849
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:51,790
Okay.

1850
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:53,526
Can I wear my new eyes?

1851
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:56,316
No, no, absolutely not,
we talked about this.

1852
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,416
They're way too distracting.

1853
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,216
We want the audience to see your eyes,

1854
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,526
even if you're not making eye contact.

1855
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:05,136
But remember to turn your
head from side to side

1856
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,446
and address the entire audience.

1857
01:32:07,470 --> 01:32:09,456
You don't want me to see them?

1858
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:12,756
No, seeing all those people
could trigger your Asperger's.

1859
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:14,766
What about the sound from the crowd?

1860
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,296
Couldn't that trigger it?

1861
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:19,656
Possibly, but that's what
the earplugs are for, okay?

1862
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,576
They're not gonna drown
out the crowd completely,

1863
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,900
they will muffle it a bit.

1864
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:25,986
Maybe your vision's correct.

1865
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:27,816
Maybe we should switch places,

1866
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,856
maybe you should be
running for the president.

1867
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,256
I thought I was the teacher,

1868
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,106
but I realized, I've learned more from you

1869
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:38,883
about being a good president
and I'm still learning.

1870
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:44,291
Don't worry, I can wait eight years.

1871
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:47,320
Earplugs.

1872
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:49,656
Thanks.

1873
01:32:49,680 --> 01:32:51,726
So let's give a warm welcome

1874
01:32:51,750 --> 01:32:55,086
to the next president
of the United States,

1875
01:32:55,110 --> 01:32:57,549
Patrick Dark Horse Lee.

1876
01:32:57,573 --> 01:33:01,333
(audience applauds)

1877
01:33:01,357 --> 01:33:05,317
(bright upbeat music)

1878
01:33:05,341 --> 01:33:08,341
(audience applauds)

1879
01:33:15,655 --> 01:33:18,905
(bright upbeat music)

1880
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:27,007
I am not a man of words, as you know.

1881
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:33,153
I may not be able to see,

1882
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:38,631
but I can hear you, like
thunder in the night.

1883
01:33:38,655 --> 01:33:41,738
(audience applauds)

1884
01:33:43,603 --> 01:33:46,656
I was told that the audience comprises

1885
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:51,366
of all political parties,
all genders, all ages,

1886
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:54,006
all races, and creeds,

1887
01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:57,426
people from every state
of the United States

1888
01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:00,333
and many countries around the world.

1889
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,344
Please cheer for yourselves.

1890
01:34:03,368 --> 01:34:06,846
(audience applauds)

1891
01:34:06,870 --> 01:34:11,727
For you represent the change
that the world wants and needs.

1892
01:34:15,343 --> 01:34:19,176
I have run a different type of campaign,

1893
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:22,893
and I have let you and your
concerns do most of the talking.

1894
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:28,296
We believe that whatever
we do in our campaign

1895
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:31,116
must have more than one purpose.

1896
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:35,073
And this, this gathering
gathering is no exception.

1897
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:39,423
You are standing on the next solution.

1898
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:44,136
The land that is cleared
for this gathering

1899
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:47,406
will be the solution to
the homeless crisis in LA.

1900
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:49,773
It will be called Angel City.

1901
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:54,660
It will eliminate Skid Row
from the streets of LA.

1902
01:34:54,684 --> 01:34:57,767
(audience applauds)

1903
01:34:59,010 --> 01:35:00,963
Once this solution is tested,

1904
01:35:02,430 --> 01:35:06,186
it could be spread to other
cities in the United States

1905
01:35:06,210 --> 01:35:08,338
and around the world.

1906
01:35:08,362 --> 01:35:11,445
(audience applauds)

1907
01:35:13,866 --> 01:35:17,608
I would like to get a bit
personal for a moment.

1908
01:35:17,632 --> 01:35:19,506
(pensive music)

1909
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:23,573
When I was a young man, I was very naive.

1910
01:35:25,873 --> 01:35:27,910
Eventually I got into the habit

1911
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:30,940
of something that I was comfortable with,

1912
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:34,536
but that made my relationship

1913
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,673
with other people very limited at best,

1914
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:42,306
and computers and other technologies

1915
01:35:42,330 --> 01:35:44,556
made it easier and easier

1916
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:49,056
to limit my one on one
personal communications.

1917
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:54,080
When I got older, I started
to miss the companionships

1918
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:58,083
that others took for granted.

1919
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:02,163
I was in a relationship
with a woman much younger.

1920
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:04,683
I wanted to have a family.

1921
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,136
I wanted to have a legacy

1922
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:11,346
so that others would
know that I had existed,

1923
01:36:11,370 --> 01:36:13,386
and as you probably guessed,

1924
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,783
that relationship did not work out.

1925
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:19,953
But I learned something
much more important.

1926
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:24,936
I learned to be independent,
to be self-motivated

1927
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,303
and to live my purpose.

1928
01:36:28,410 --> 01:36:32,406
Today, I just found out
that two of the candidates

1929
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:34,596
for the major political parties

1930
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:37,836
has accepted my challenge.

1931
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,726
From this day on,

1932
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:42,066
they'll be using their campaign donations

1933
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:44,379
to solve actual problems.

1934
01:36:44,403 --> 01:36:46,794
(audience applauds)

1935
01:36:46,818 --> 01:36:49,469
And their coffers are bigger than mine.

1936
01:36:49,493 --> 01:36:52,757
This makes me very happy.

1937
01:36:52,781 --> 01:36:55,864
(audience applauds)

1938
01:36:57,615 --> 01:37:01,030
And what makes me even
more happy and secure

1939
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,813
is that I finally found my family.

1940
01:37:09,689 --> 01:37:13,073
You, you are my family.

1941
01:37:13,097 --> 01:37:14,911
(audience applauds)

1942
01:37:14,935 --> 01:37:16,957
Right in, Patrick Lee!

1943
01:37:16,981 --> 01:37:18,761
Right in, Patrick Lee!

1944
01:37:18,785 --> 01:37:20,633
Right in, Patrick Lee!

1945
01:37:20,657 --> 01:37:22,440
Right in, Patrick Lee!

1946
01:37:22,464 --> 01:37:24,343
Right in, Patrick Lee!

1947
01:37:24,367 --> 01:37:26,544
Right in, Patrick Lee!

1948
01:37:26,568 --> 01:37:29,376
Even if I don't win this election,

1949
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,920
I know that you will carry out my ideas

1950
01:37:32,897 --> 01:37:35,076
and my plans will move forward

1951
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,571
in the United States and around the world.

1952
01:37:38,595 --> 01:37:39,669
(audience applauds)

1953
01:37:39,693 --> 01:37:41,629
You, you are my legacy.

1954
01:37:41,653 --> 01:37:45,689
And long after I am
gone and only a memory,

1955
01:37:45,713 --> 01:37:48,377
you will carry on!

1956
01:37:48,401 --> 01:37:51,668
(audience applauds)

1957
01:37:51,692 --> 01:37:55,529
(bright upbeat music)

1958
01:37:55,553 --> 01:37:57,530
We the people love Lee!

1959
01:37:57,554 --> 01:37:59,445
We the people love Lee!

1960
01:37:59,469 --> 01:38:01,158
We the people love Lee!

1961
01:38:01,182 --> 01:38:03,174
We the people love Lee!

1962
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:05,103
We the people love Lee!

1963
01:38:05,127 --> 01:38:07,147
We the people love Lee!

1964
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:09,064
We the people love Lee!

1965
01:38:09,088 --> 01:38:10,942
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1966
01:38:10,966 --> 01:38:12,934
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1967
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:14,937
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1968
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:16,911
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1969
01:38:16,935 --> 01:38:18,805
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1970
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:20,672
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1971
01:38:20,696 --> 01:38:22,532
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1972
01:38:22,556 --> 01:38:24,554
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1973
01:38:24,578 --> 01:38:26,648
Patrick Lee, lead the way!

1974
01:38:26,672 --> 01:38:28,639
Patrick Lee, lead the way!
