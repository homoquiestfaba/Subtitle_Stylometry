00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,929
[clears throat]
Let me try this thing.

00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,391
Okay. Dude, hold it still.

3
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:18,893
Hey. l'm Bobby, uh, from New York.

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:20,645
l heard about the show.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,771
There's a million dollars to be won,

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,022
and l know l can win it.

7
00:00:23,107 --> 00:00:26,317
l wanna be on the show because--

8
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,652
well...

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,070
for the money.

10
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,615
There's this whole reality TV craze thing
sweeping across the nation.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,991
l know there's money to be made.

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,620
l wanna be on a reality show
because it's not real!

13
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,621
lt's all make-believe.

14
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,748
All these TV shows are bullshit.

15
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,417
All l need is a little money,

16
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,210
if you know what l mean.

17
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,214
Not quite a million, but 500,000
would give me some justice.

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:54,011
The reason l wanna be on the show
is because l wanna be a a star.

19
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,888
l would jump at the opportunity

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,640
to participate in a contest with a few...

21
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,810
overall mediocre college kids...

22
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,562
especially for a million dollars.

23
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:06,023
What would l do for a million dollars?

24
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:09,277
l think l'd do just about anything
for a million dollars.

l still feel like we're being watched.

65
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,706
lt's a good idea that
we kept the cameras

66
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,793
because we paid a fortune
to rent this place out.

67
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,378

546
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,953
[gasps]
Yes!

547
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,039
Mmm! l'm so hungry.

548
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,333
You have a Jacuzzi, woman!

549
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:45,046
l guess l am just
gonna haνe to get in the Jacuzzi!

550
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,422
Whoo!

551
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,466
l coming to join you!

552
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,730
Now that...

553
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,232
that is awesome.

554
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,156
[Philip]
He's in the lead!

555
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,658
He's gonna do it!

556
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:14,784
- He's gonna do it!
- [rings bell]

557
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,119
Congratulations, Techno!

558
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,664
Yeah! Tonight, l get the crib!

559
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:23,292
[Philip]
Not quite yet, Techno.

560
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,586
l need you to do something.

561
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,173
What l want you to do
is push Jack in the pool.

562
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,466
- What?
- What?

563
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,301
All the keys are at the bottom.

564
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:34,136
- Uh-uh.
- He'll drown.

565
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,764
Well, not if he finds the right key.

566
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,766
That's like 9 feet deep, man!
That's crazy!

567
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,270
[Philip]
Push Jack into the pool.

568
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,606
Come on.

569
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:49,485
[Techno]
No, no.

570
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,904
This is a joke, right?
This has got to be a joke.

571
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,657
l guess Techno doesn't
want to be the winner.

572
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:59,870
Whoever pushes Techno into the pool
is the winner.

573
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,835
Hasta la vista! Yo!

574
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,837
[Philip]
Congratulations, Jack.

575
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:10,214
[all yelling, shouting]

576
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,966
[Jack]
l'm the winner!

577
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,636
Somebody's gotta do something!

578
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:16,887
Yo, where are the divers?

579
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,556
The keys!

580
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,016
Somebody's gotta do something!

581
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,774
We need divers! We need help!

582
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:29,859
Come on!

583
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,319
We need fucking help!

584
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,494
[all talking]

585
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,249
Jack!

586
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,473
Get him oνer!

587
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,892
He's okay! He's okay!

588
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:10,691
[all talking]

589
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,498
l don't get this contest.

590
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,000
What do you mean?

591
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,712
Don't you find it
a little weird, any of this?

592
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:35,049
Yeah, but that's how
these things work, Rube.

593
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,717
They're just trying to scare us.

594
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,802
They're trying to freak us out.

595
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,304
This is bullshit.

596
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
l don't know if l want to keep going.

597
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,769
Come on, let's just stay in it for two days
and see how it goes.

598
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,813
lt's a million dollars, Ruby.

599
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,773
You know what?

600
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:53,609
l just need a minute to think, all right?

601
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,985
[sighs]

602
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,654
l'll come in in a little bit.

603
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,031
- You sure?
- Yeah.

604
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,075
Okay, fine.

605
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,638
[all talking]

606
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,308
[Philip] When was the last time
any of you saw Ruby?

607
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,436
Yeah, l left her by the pool.

608
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,647
Well, she said she wanted
to think for a minute.

609
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,899
l'll go get her.

610
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,154
This is crazy.

611
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,656
Ruby?

612
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,577
Rube?

613
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:58,716
Okay. So no sign of her,

614
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,510
but l found her necklace in the pool.

615
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,220
[Philip]
Gina?

616
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,890
Ruby quit.

617
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,308
What?

618
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:09,685
Gina, Ruby has been sent home.

619
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,897
And, uh, l have some
bad news for you, too.

620
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,815
lt looks like you're being sent home, too.

621
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,404
You're sending me home?

622
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,825
Looks like all your friends
decided to vote you off.

623
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:27,620
Why?

624
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,165
You were the last one to see Ruby.

625
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,709
lf she was trippin' out,
you should have been supportiνe.

626
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:37,546
Are you serious?
You're gonna blame me for that?

627
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,174
Okay, Gina,

628
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,053
did Ruby at any time indicate that she
was distressed or upset?

629
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,264
No, she just said she wanted
to sit by the pool for a minute.

630
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,726
Well, then did you ask her if she
needed or wanted some company?

631
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,437
No, l did not ask her
if she wanted or needed company.

632
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,689
Since when does not asking someone
if they want company wrong?

633
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,275
So you're saying that you didn't ask her.

634
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,069
So basically you abandoned her
in her time of need?

635
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,947
Jack, stop with this lawyer shit, okay?

636
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,657
You know what? Enough!

637
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,784
l'm sorry, okay?

638
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:10,287
Gina, we're all really sorry.

639
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,666
l can't believe you guys.

640
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,461
l mean, doesn't any one of you
find it really strange

641
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,381
that Ruby left her necklace in the pool?

642
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,633
Wouldn't she at least look for it
before she left?

643
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,677
[Philip]
We can't stop the show for Ruby's necklace.

644
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:27,179
We will make sure
she gets her necklace.

645
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,766
Fine.

646
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:35,813
Oh. You know what?

647
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:37,690
Voting me out...

648
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,275
is actually a really good strategic move.

649
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,279
Because everybody here knows
that l'm the frontrunner,

650
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,240
and that is a conspiracy.

651
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,574
lt's not a conspiracy.

652
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,576
He made us vote for someone,
and we νoted for you.

653
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,663
[speaking Spanish]

654
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,169
[Philip]
Enough with this, Gina!

655
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,629
You're being sent home!

656
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,966
[Gina speaking Spanish]

657
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,552
You guys,

658
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:09,013
l will see you in the morning.

659
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,684
[man laughs]

660
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,188
This...

661
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,648
This is a joke, right?

662
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,027
[Gina chuckles]
What's funny?

663
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:34,056
Oh, no! No! Please!

664
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,682
Please!

665
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:40,687
Please! Please don't!

666
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,023
Please! Por favor!

667
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,776
[speaking Spanish]

668
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,869
Por favor.

669
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:01,291
Please.

670
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,230
No! No! No!

671
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,606
No! No!

672
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:39,830
[screaming]

673
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:56,513
What are you doing in here?

674
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,432
You're not supposed to be in this room.

675
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,726
This contest is so screwed up.

676
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,811
There are no rules.

677
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,313
So l'm gonna make up my own.

678
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:07,107
You mind if l join you?

679
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,109
Be my guest.

680
00:42:18,912 --> 00:42:21,038
Don't even think about it.

681
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,625
[whispering, indistinct]

682
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,874
Ah.

683
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:08,085
[Philip]
All right, you guys.

684
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,336
Only seven of you remain

685
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,797
to compete for
the one million dollars!

686
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,174
[cheering]

687
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,718
As you all know,

688
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:20,180
one challenge is a continuing one,
the lack of food.

689
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:23,100
l'm sure you're all starving.

690
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,018
However, in this challenge,

691
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:30,023
each one of you is going to be faced
with a very primal fear.

692
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,525
Blood!

693
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,694
[all groan]

694
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,821
l like blood!

695
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:38,198
But if you succeed,
you will have a meal.

696
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,742
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

697
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,202
l'm famished!

698
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:45,747
Yum yum yum.

699
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,000
Yum yum.
[laughs]

700
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:50,460
[Philip]
Bobby, open the drape!

701
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,757
[all gasp]

702
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,093
- Man!
- Oh, man!

703
00:43:58,219 --> 00:43:59,469
[laughs]

704
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:00,679
On camera?

705
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,514
And they're totally gonna air this.

706
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:08,270
Each of you have to cut out
and edible piece with your name.

707
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,772
And then you're having it for lunch.

708
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:12,482
Gross, dude.

709
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,608
Beware, though.

710
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,902
lf you cut the wrong piece,
it gets very bloody.

711
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,155
- You're kidding.
- Do it.

712
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,659
What are you getting?

713
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,369
A rib!

714
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,412
Oh, God!

715
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,539
- What is he getting?
- A rib.

716
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,960
Ugghhh!

717
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,880
Oh, my God.

718
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,299
Oh, my God!

719
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,675
That sucker's bleeding.

720
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,094
Whoo-hoo!

721
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,095
Yeah!

722
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,347
That is disgusting!

723
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,807
l got a big piece of meat.

724
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,852
- Blaah!
- Aahhh!

725
00:44:57,445 --> 00:44:58,945
Oh! Shit!

726

Aarrgghh!

734
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,913
lt'd be better if it was cooked, Jack.

735
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,958
Why? l heard you like raw meat.

736
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:54,751
No, l don't like raw meat.

737
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,712
Oh, Mr. Hee-Haw over there
likes his meat cooked.

738
00:45:57,797 --> 00:45:59,756
l like it worked.

739
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,425
What is this shit?

740
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:02,884
lt's probably cow's stomach lining.

741
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:06,054
Hey, Colin, when you get angry,
do you beat your meat?

742
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,764
That was cheesy.

743
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:10,183

You can't be watching me.

762
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:57,022
Hey, l'm not lying.

763
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:01,735
Why don't you do something,
and l'll tell you what you did.

764
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:06,781
Oh!

765
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,450
Obscene gestures!

766
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,535
Come on, show me your tits.

767
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,621
You're watching us in the bathroom?

768
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:13,955

[pounding on door]

780
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:04,357

you will hunt each other
with paintball guns.

784
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,159
The contestant who has been shot
the fewest times,

785
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:15,660
of course, is the winner.

786
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:18,163
No one is allowed to hide
or avoid action.

787
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:22,042
You have ten seconds
before you start shooting.

788
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,335
Go!

What are you doing?
You're the driνer.

801
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,703
Then where's your paint gun?

802
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,329
Right here.

803
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:42,831
[laughs]
You're dead.

804
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,999
Shit!

805
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:47,836
Are you crazy?

806
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,715
l guess l forgot to tell you about this part,
Techno.

807
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,842
[laughs]
l'm just testing you.

808
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:56,636

809
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:59,514
What's going on here?
Did l miss something?

810
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,225
- Yeah, you are missing something.
- What?

811
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,021
All right. Listen up.

812
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:10,400
Remember that part in Average Joe

813
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,152
where they brought out all these hunks?

814
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:15,530
l mean, that really pissed me off.

815
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,073
You know what l'm saying?

816
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:19,159
Yeah, l--l totally agree with you.

817
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,203
They did need something
for the third act, right?

818
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,663
l mean, to kind of spice it up.

819
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,165
Am l right, Techno? Come on.

820
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,917
Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.
You're so right!

821
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:31,004
You know, they bring out
these fucking goddamn hunks,

822
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,132
totally humiliate
the fuck out of these poor,

823
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,593
pathetic, fat, ugly pieces of shit!

824
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:39,471
That really pisses me off!

825
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,681
Yeah, yeah. lt really pissed me off, too!

826
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:45,018
Techno, come on now.
What's wrong with you?

827
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,686
You're too agreeable.

828
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,063
[laughs]
l think it's time for you to go.

829
00:51:53,903 --> 00:51:55,695
Bye.

830
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,574
What do we have here, Grady?

831
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,993
Sheriff, we got a Jane Doe.

832
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,496
No injuries to speak of, but, uh...

833
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,831
take a look at her fingernails.

834
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,465
Looks like she was buried alive.

835
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,842
Tried to dig her way out.

836
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,596
We just found this girl buried alive.

837
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,932
You know anything at all
that might help us?

838
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:28,770
No. No, l'm sorry.

839
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:35,401
You seen anything strange
going on in the neighborhood?

840
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,531
Nope.

841
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,745
ls there anything else
l can help you guys with?

842
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,996
No, that should do it.

843
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,540
Oh.

844
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:49,749
Cool.

845
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,751
You enjoy your sandwich.

00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,394
You are such an asshole.

[growls]

851
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,647
Mmm.

852
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,694
You know the cameras can see us.

853
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,571
l don't care.

854
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,489
[clears throat]

855
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:25,910
So...how do you really
feel about her, Bobby?

856
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,705
l'm so hungry, l could eat her saliva, Jack.

857
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:29,831
Ew.

858
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:30,999
Where's Techno gone, Jack?

859
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,794
They're probably
eating worms in the garden again.

860
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,379
Techno quit the paintball challenge.

861
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,214
Well, they probably sent him home.

862
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:39,883
Where else would he be?

863
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,427
l am so famished!

864
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:44,888
l could eat you, dude.

865
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,808
You know what? We should
go find some food.

866
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,268
All right.

867
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,230

- She was buried alive.
- Oaky. lt's fake.

881
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,088
All right? This is all make-believe.

882
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:02,590
lt's all a part of the little game.

if we take a look around.

1033

Actually, that'll be a problem with me

1034
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,613
because, you know,
l'm shooting this reality show,

1035

and all my guests, you know,
they haνe to be sequestered.

So if you come in, you'll ruin my show.

01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:33,744
Of course.

1038
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,162
We understand.
