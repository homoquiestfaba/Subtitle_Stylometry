1
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,692
{\i1}In 1973 the Chilean army overthrew{\i}

2
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,609
{\i1}President Allende{\i}

3
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:06,234
{\i1}and General Pinochet{\i}

4
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,109
{\i1}took control of the country.{\i}

5
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:10,109
{\i1}After 15 years of dictatorship,{\i}

6
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:11,192
{\i1}Pinochet faced{\i}

7
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,525
{\i1}increasing international pressure{\i}

8
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:15,400
{\i1}to legitimize his regime.{\i}

9
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:16,775
{\i1}In July, 1988,{\i}

10
00:01:16,942 --> 00:01:18,400
{\i1}a referendum was held.{\i}

11
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:20,067
{\i1}The people would vote YES or NO{\i}

12
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,609
{\i1}to another 8-year term{\i}

13
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,318
{\i1}for Pinochet.{\i}

14
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,026
{\i1}For 27 days, the two sides{\i}

15
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:27,692
{\i1}would fight it out daily on TV:{\i}

16
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,942
{\i1}15 minutes for the YES camp{\i}

17
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:30,359
{\i1}and 15 for the NO.{\i}

18
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:48,067
First of all, I'd like to say

19
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,901
that what you're about to see

20
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,359
fits with the current social context.

21
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,942
We believe the country is ready

22
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,775
for communication like this.

23
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,151
Absolutely.

24
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,400
Remember, the citizens

25
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:07,359
have increased demands about the truth,

26
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:10,234
and what they want.

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,901
Let's be honest:

28
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,359
Today, Chile is thinking of its future.

29
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:19,483
Let's watch.

30
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,192
{\i1}The new soft drink has arrived!{\i}

31
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,359
{\i1}It's young, liberated, and Free!{\i}

32
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,984
{\i1}The time has come{\i}

33
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:38,609
{\i1}The time is right for Free {\i}

34
00:02:38,817 --> 00:02:40,859
{\i1}It's what you were waiting for{\i}

35
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,442
{\i1}It was made for you{\i}

36
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,650
{\i1}And now, Free!{\i}

37
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:48,650
{\i1}Refresh yourself now!{\i}

38
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:51,442
{\i1}And feel Free!{\i}

39
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,276
{\i1}Free like you{\i}

40
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,567
{\i1}Now, you. Now, Free!{\i}

41
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:08,901
It's OK, but...

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,734
Why the fuck is there miming in my film?

43
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:16,151
When did we talk about miming?

44
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,109
There is no doubt that...

45
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:26,442
that it is very well done,

46
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:30,859
You can see the effort.

47
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,734
Carlos,

48
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,901
This is very, very, very original.

49
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,442
It might work in the US,

50
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:46,359
but we have to trust our product.

51
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:48,109
We have a product

52
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:49,901
different to the competition.

53
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:52,442
It invites you to be young,

54
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,151
and be brave.

55
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,276
If you're brave, you're Free.

56
00:03:57,442 --> 00:03:58,525
I think.

57
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:01,984
This is everything our youth needs.

58
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:05,609
Music, a rebellion,

59
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:07,650
an idyll.

60
00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:10,234
But with order and respect.

61
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,026
Excuse me. There's a Mr. Urrutia...

62
00:04:13,192 --> 00:04:14,525
No, we're in a meeting.

63
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:16,026
He's here.

64
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,400
Here?

65
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,151
Please go and see. Go on.

66
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:22,567
OK.

67
00:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,318
Take a look at the 30-second version.

68
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,984
There's no miming in it.

69
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,151
Thanks.

70
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,817
José Tomás Urrutia?

71
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:32,650
Yes.

72
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:34,567
The communist?

73
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,026
Yes.

74
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,109
What do you want?

75
00:04:44,276 --> 00:04:46,942
You've become very fucking important.

76
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:51,817
No wonder you won't take my calls now.

77
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:53,192
I work.

78
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:56,942
What's going on?

79
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:58,734
How's Vero doing?

80
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:00,734
Well, I suppose.

81
00:05:01,192 --> 00:05:02,775
What can I do for you?

82
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,359
I'm working on the campaign

83
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,817
for the referendum.

84
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,192
I know.

85
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,859
For the NO campaign, of course.

86
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:18,026
Everyone knows.

87
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,151
What does everyone know?

88
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:22,151
That you're with the NOs,

89
00:05:22,318 --> 00:05:24,567
and you want me to do the campaign.

90
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,359
Who?

91
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:27,318
Me.

92
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:28,151
You?

93
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:29,442
Yes. Me.

94
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,442
No.

95
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,067
Besides...

96
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,609
Why are you bothering with it?

97
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,775
This election is rigged from the outset.

98
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:41,400
Listen,

99
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,817
international pressure

100
00:05:44,984 --> 00:05:45,984
has forced Pinochet to agree

101
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:47,901
to an opposing campaign.

102
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:49,734
This is our chance

103
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,942
to overthrow the dictatorship.

104
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:53,984
So, Pinochet set up a referendum

105
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,483
in order to lose it.

106
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:57,901
No, be serious,

107
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,276
I'm being serious, man.

108
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,151
Pinochet could win this vote

109
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:03,734
without cheating, if he wants.

110
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:04,650
Really?

111
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:06,109
That's what's so terrible.

112
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:06,984
Legally?

113
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,026
People either vote for him

114
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,359
or not at all.

115
00:06:09,525 --> 00:06:10,775
No, let's take a cab.

116
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:11,901
We'll take a bus.

117
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:14,692
A political campaign

118
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,609
takes up a lot of time.

119
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,650
A lot of people... A good team.

120
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,234
Of course, but the campaign

121
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,650
is in the hands

122
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,192
of experts in political communication

123
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,234
who know their job and do it well.

124
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,567
Let me tell you that at first,

125
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:32,942
I wasn't too sure,

126
00:06:33,109 --> 00:06:34,984
but they've surprised me.

127
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:37,692
Good people, responsible, capable.

128
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,692
What I need, man...

129
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,859
is an external opinion.

130
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,318
An opinion!

131
00:06:45,483 --> 00:06:46,817
Just an opinion from me?

132
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,109
I wouldn't even give you that.

133
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,276
Calm down, man.

134
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:51,692
No!

135
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,192
I didn't know

136
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,400
you were pals with that communist.

137
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,026
Urrutia's no communist.

138
00:06:58,192 --> 00:06:58,942
Yes he is.

139
00:06:59,109 --> 00:06:59,775
No.

140
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,192
He was my classmate. I know him.

141
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,234
No, he's not a communist.

142
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,901
What is he, then?

143
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:08,234
He's the other...

144
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:10,692
Christian Democrat?

145
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:11,734
No.

146
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:13,359
Socialist?

147
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:14,192
No!

148
00:07:14,609 --> 00:07:15,442
It doesn't matter,

149
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,901
they're all forms of communism.

150
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,483
No, I know Urrutia from...

151
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,775
He's a family friend.

152
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:25,734
Are you going to tell me

153
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:27,276
how microwave works?

154
00:07:27,609 --> 00:07:30,650
It's laser technology.

155
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,109
Invisible heat,

156
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,567
and you say "a" microwave.

157
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:36,734
A microwave.

158
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:37,692
Yes.

159
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:43,359
You were offered the NO campaign?

160
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,067
Are we going to talk about that

161
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,483
or about a microwave?

162
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,775
You tell me, dickwad.

163
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:56,483
Yes.

164
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,525
Yes,

165
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,650
but I said no,

166
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:06,984
I didn't have the time,

167
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:10,067
I had my hands full, and I couldn't.

168
00:08:10,234 --> 00:08:12,609
I'm only going to give them my opinion.

169
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:15,483
Even if it hurts you.

170
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:16,650
Thank you.

171
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,400
You're such a showoff, asshole.

172
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:20,567
Loads of people are offering me work.

173
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,817
Freelance.

174
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:23,859
With your family background,

175
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,901
I never should have hired you.

176
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,734
You'd have passed up a goldmine.

177
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:28,984
And what about you?

178
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,775
Forget my loyalty to Pinochet.

179
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:35,984
Please be coherent.

180
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,276
You didn't share that goldmine

181
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:39,692
with the communists.

182
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:42,067
Enough with the communists, old lady.

183
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:44,276
An old lady? No, an old man.

184
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,775
Who's on board with the campaign?

185
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:48,234
I don't know.

186
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,525
Did they call anyone from abroad?

187
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,400
No, just me I think.

188
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,234
You?

189
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,192
Yes.

190
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,192
But you've been away for ages.

191
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:00,775
What do you know about it? Nothing.

192
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:01,817
Do they have money?

193
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:02,901
No.

194
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,234
The communists don't have money.

195
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,151
It's not them.

196
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,109
Oh no? So who is it then?

197
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,692
Everyone but the communists.

198
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:11,817
Not the communists.

199
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,192
Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet Union

200
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,942
didn't put any money in.

201
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,276
No.

202
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:19,026
The Americans did.

203
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,984
No, they're on our side.

204
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,192
And yet they did it.

205
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:25,359
The CIA financed the coups

206
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:26,525
and are supporting us.

207
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,359
How much are they paying you?

208
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,859
The Americans are with the NO.

209
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:14,442
...for public spaces,

210
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,775
we've designed some posters.

211
00:10:16,942 --> 00:10:18,151
This doesn't mean

212
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,442
that these are the definitive ones:

213
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,650
"If I govern, you govern"

214
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:27,400
"YES, for a winning country"

215
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,234
"We are millions."

216
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,567
Lucho Guzman.

217
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:33,567
Explain to us your theory

218
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:35,650
about reactionary people.

219
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:37,400
No, Minister.

220
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:38,859
What I meant to say

221
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,400
is that the concept of dictatorship

222
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,151
packs a strong punch.

223
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:43,567
And that on top of that,

224
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,817
now they're going to say it on TV.

225
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:48,525
15 minutes of screen time.

226
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:51,026
15 minutes of TV

227
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,901
split into different opinions

228
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,859
lost in the middle of the night.

229
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:56,901
That's what the opposition has.

230
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,192
The YES camp will have those 15 minutes

231
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,192
and all of the remaining time, too.

232
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,817
They didn't have that platform before.

233
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,942
Platform? How many parties are there?

234
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:07,151
Seventeen.

235
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,817
It'll be chaos.

236
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:11,359
They'll fight like cat and dog.

237
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:14,442
The general is respected everywhere.

238
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,234
Even the biggest hypocrites

239
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
know he's modernized this country.

240
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,400
Do you know what I've heard

241
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:22,192
my fellow Argentineans say?

242
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,942
"We want a Pinochet."

243
00:11:24,942 --> 00:11:26,859
Everyone wants a Pinochet.

244
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:28,775
Show him.

245
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:30,151
You control the radio,

246
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,109
the newspapers, television. But...

247
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,109
we have to get him out of uniform,

248
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:36,234
and compose

249
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,442
an elegant, very Chilean anthem,

250
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:39,567
for the people to sing

251
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:42,318
with pride, to the general in a suit.

252
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,067
That spells trouble.

253
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,942
How about in black tie?

254
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,609
I prefer him in a suit.

255
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,318
I think we should take advantage

256
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:58,276
of his blue eyes, his smile.

257
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,650
We'd need to test it, Minister,

258
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:02,067
to be sure.

259
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,442
I'd make him wear a pearl.

260
00:12:05,026 --> 00:12:06,400
It's very elegant.

261
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,318
I'll have to talk to him.

262
00:12:12,109 --> 00:12:13,525
Pinochet out of uniform

263
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,109
is a government without soldiers,

264
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,151
in other words, progress.

265
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:18,734
This country's progress

266
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:20,817
has been stunning.

267
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:23,109
It's not like Latin America.

268
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,525
You don't realize the...

269
00:12:26,734 --> 00:12:28,901
your influence in the world.

270
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,775
But these "gauchos" keep protesting.

271
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,817
The country is full of ingrates.

272
00:12:33,984 --> 00:12:35,609
They forgot everything.

273
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,984
So scare them.

274
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:39,859
Excuse me?

275
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:41,901
You've lost me.

276
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:43,109
Shouldn't we show

277
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,400
a nicer face?

278
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,734
If you want to scare people,

279
00:12:45,901 --> 00:12:47,817
scare them with their past.

280
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,525
Their past of poverty,

281
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:51,901
endless queues for bread.

282
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:52,859
The opposition

283
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:54,067
misses socialism,

284
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,400
but the only thing people care about

285
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,942
is handouts.

286
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,067
They know

287
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:01,650
socialism makes them unhappy.

288
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,192
Here, you have a system

289
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,609
in which anyone can get rich.

290
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,901
Careful, not everyone.

291
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:11,318
But anyone.

292
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:14,609
You can't lose when everyone

293
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:17,400
is dreaming about being that anyone.

294
00:13:26,192 --> 00:13:27,483
Move, dammit!

295
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:30,525
Move, you idiot!

296
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,609
Free the political prisoners!

297
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,817
Free them all!

298
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,650
Why just some of them?

299
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,650
Veronica!

300
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,192
Fucking cops!

301
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:47,234
Stop it!

302
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,901
Why are you hitting her?

303
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:52,567
You're hitting a woman!

304
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,318
Out!

305
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:01,318
How can you hit a woman?

306
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:02,984
Let her go, motherfucker!

307
00:14:03,192 --> 00:14:04,442
Let her go, asshole!

308
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,151
Let go of me!

309
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:10,984
How much longer?

310
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,984
How much longer, for fuck's sake?

311
00:14:16,942 --> 00:14:18,442
That's right.

312
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,817
Turn the news on.

313
00:14:39,984 --> 00:14:40,859
OK.

314
00:14:41,942 --> 00:14:42,817
There.

315
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:49,400
{\i1}Free the nation{\i}

316
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,734
{\i1}from frayed populist paths{\i}

317
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,942
{\i1}and economical stagnation{\i}

318
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,234
{\i1}and lead it to modernization{\i}

319
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:58,650
{\i1}and progress for all Chileans.{\i}

320
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,650
{\i1}Augusto Pinochet Ugarte.{\i}

321
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,067
{\i1}from a very young age {\i}

322
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,859
{\i1}showed his love for serving his country,{\i}

323
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:10,067
{\i1}influenced by the stories{\i}

324
00:15:10,234 --> 00:15:11,817
{\i1}of the nation's forefathers{\i}

325
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:13,901
{\i1}which set ablaze his courage,{\i}

326
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:18,067
{\i1}and made him enter the military.{\i}

327
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,151
{\i1}From dawn to dusk,{\i}

328
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:21,984
{\i1}he worked tirelessly...{\i}

329
00:15:22,151 --> 00:15:23,234
{\i1}Give me that.{\i}

330
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,567
{\i1}...Devoting all of his time,{\i}

331
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:27,734
{\i1}his attention and his energy.{\i}

332
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:28,901
{\i1}He sacrificed himself.{\i}

333
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,151
{\i1}He endured everything{\i}

334
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:32,567
{\i1}to accomplish his mission{\i}

335
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:34,318
{\i1}to save Chile.{\i}

336
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:44,026
{\i1}Iorana, President{\i}

337
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:49,442
{\i1}Hear the voices of your people{\i}

338
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,984
{\i1}Thank you for coming{\i}

339
00:15:53,192 --> 00:15:54,775
{\i1}Ariki Nui{\i}

340
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:55,817
{\i1}Carmen!{\i}

341
00:15:56,483 --> 00:16:00,525
{\i1}For being here, Ariki Nui{\i}

342
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:02,359
{\i1}Ariki Nui{\i}

343
00:16:04,775 --> 00:16:09,192
{\i1}Iorana, President{\i}

344
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:13,734
{\i1}We will always be here{\i}

345
00:16:15,026 --> 00:16:18,151
{\i1}Thank you for giving us{\i}

346
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:22,901
{\i1}A home to live in{\i}

347
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:28,567
{\i1}Ariki Nui, Ariki Nui{\i}

348
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,400
{\i1}Mahu Ariki Nui{\i}

349
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,483
{\i1}My main concern{\i}

350
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,442
{\i1}is...{\i}

351
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,859
{\i1}not losing what we've won.{\i}

352
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,400
{\i1}That's what matters.{\i}

353
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:20,359
This is for Simon, OK?

354
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,525
OK.

355
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,192
Is he asleep?

356
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:24,483
I don't know.

357
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:43,525
Nice.

358
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,318
How have you been?

359
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:55,775
Fine.

360
00:17:56,151 --> 00:17:57,026
Fine.

361
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:58,318
And Simon?

362
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:03,109
He feels lonely.

363
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,901
And the maid?

364
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,400
Fine.

365
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:10,609
Is she a good cook?

366
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:12,525
Yes.

367
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:19,276
He's not alone.

368
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:21,109
He knows I'm here.

369
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,942
Did they hit you much?

370
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,109
No.

371
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,817
That kid understands everything.

372
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,067
No, he doesn't get any of it.

373
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:40,442
Neither do I, to tell you the truth.

374
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,942
The maid can't do everything.

375
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:52,359
You're going to work for the NO?

376
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,400
To do what?

377
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,692
To win.

378
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:08,151
You'll legitimize Pinochet's sham.

379
00:19:09,192 --> 00:19:11,525
You'll say yes, he's my president.

380
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,442
this is my constitution.

381
00:19:14,609 --> 00:19:15,859
Mercenary.

382
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,734
The boy has to get up at 7am.

383
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:20,525
Why don't you stay tonight?

384
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,859
We'll have breakfast together.

385
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:23,859
OK.

386
00:19:24,734 --> 00:19:25,984
Are they paying you well?

387
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,567
I can't complain.

388
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:28,692
Oh, well.

389
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:40,859
Let me give him a kiss, please.

390
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,359
Go ahead.

391
00:19:48,442 --> 00:19:50,192
I love you, sweetheart.

392
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:59,984
We're going to get rid of Pinochet.

393

Right.

401
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,650
René, we're listening.

402
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:45,817
Is that all?

403
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:47,942
I think so, isn't it?

404
00:21:48,567 --> 00:21:51,318
Sorry. There's nothing else?

405
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,775
Something else?

406
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,901
Something else...

407
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:02,734
Something a little lighter.

408
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,525
A little nicer.

409
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:07,567
Comrade,

410
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:08,817
do you think

411
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,483
that what's going on in Chile is nice?

412
00:22:12,442 --> 00:22:14,567
No. Let's see...

413
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,901
It moves me as it moves all of you.

414
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,067
However,

415
00:22:20,692 --> 00:22:22,276
I think that

416
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,067
it's not very appealing.

417
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,234
Well. Let's try.

418
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:28,151
Let's try, from both sides,

419
00:22:28,318 --> 00:22:31,442
to give more constructive opinions.

420
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:34,942
Me too?

421
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:35,942
Everyone.

422
00:22:36,109 --> 00:22:38,109
Let's give our opinions, and move on.

423
00:22:38,276 --> 00:22:41,109
I'd like to know if anyone thinks

424
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,151
we can win with this campaign.

425
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:48,650
I think the main objective...

426
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:49,567
Excuse me?

427
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:51,567
We must open the eyes

428
00:22:51,734 --> 00:22:53,234
of those who don't want to vote.

429
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,483
That's the main objective.

430
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,192
Dictatorship has destroyed this country

431
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,525
and will continue to destroy it,

432
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,984
with its economic success

433
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,067
and 40% of the population

434
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:09,318
living below the poverty line.

435
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:11,734
We all agree

436
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,984
we want to win the referendum,

437
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:16,276
but some only want to win,

438
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:19,442
without really reforming Chile.

439
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:22,942
We want another kind of victory.

440
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,192
But the advertiser

441
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,318
asked a different question.

442
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:27,650
Our comrade asked

443
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:30,609
if you think that we're going to win.

444
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:32,901
The answer is no.

445
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,151
We don't think that we're going to win.

446
00:23:34,318 --> 00:23:37,109
The referendum was lost from the moment

447
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:38,901
the fascist right called for it.

448
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,650
Then why pitch this campaign?

449
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:43,859
To raise awareness

450
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:44,901
and fill the spaces

451
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,775
the dictatorship had to open,

452
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,067
and which we won.

453
00:23:48,234 --> 00:23:49,234
Let us fill them.

454
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,276
Exactly.

455
00:23:50,442 --> 00:23:51,692
Let them allow us to win,

456
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,525
maybe, but let them accept us.

457
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,151
If we already lost, we should give up.

458
00:23:57,318 --> 00:23:59,901
This referendum is a fraud, we know it.

459
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,318
Dad, what are you doing?

460
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:40,567
I'm working.

461
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,775
This isn't work, you're playing.

462
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:44,609
Hand me the rocket.

463
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,026
It's over there.

464
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,026
I'm going to put it together!

465
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:49,318
Really?

466
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,234
It's already put together.

467
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:52,942
Then I'm going to drive it.

468
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:55,775
Stop it, please.

469
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,859
I want to play with my train.

470
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:01,609
Go to bed.

471
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:25,109
Abstentions: 35.1%, 146...

472
00:25:25,276 --> 00:25:26,567
"YES" votes: 19%.

473
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,984
Abstainers: 76,2%.

474
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:30,276
That's it.

475
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:31,483
Thank you.

476
00:25:32,276 --> 00:25:34,400
What do you think of this?

477
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,276
A feeling of false hope,

478
00:25:37,442 --> 00:25:39,151
deeply internalized,

479
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:43,067
preventing the voters from feeling free

480
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:45,026
at the moment of voting,

481
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:48,192
because they're completely repressed.

482
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,567
As a result,

483
00:25:49,734 --> 00:25:51,483
with so many unanswerable questions,

484
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,609
the results are quite unsure.

485
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:57,567
As for the fear,

486
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,442
it is significantly increasing

487
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:02,859
the number of undecided voters.

488
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:05,026
These two are the undecided groups, no?

489
00:26:05,192 --> 00:26:07,359
Those who don't know if they'll vote?

490
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:08,483
Yes.

491
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,151
It's impossible.

492
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,234
You can't make

493
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,734
a campaign with such extremes.

494
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,609
Their interests are too different.

495
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,109
It's impossible.

496
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,609
How impossible, would you say?

497
00:26:22,318 --> 00:26:23,817
We need a miracle.

498
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,192
I think you've said the key word.

499
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,525
We need a miracle.

500
00:26:28,692 --> 00:26:30,609
In other words, God,

501
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:32,234
and His celestial army,

502
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,192
angels and archangels.

503
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,276
Faith.

504
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,067
That's what's going to change Chile.

505
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,984
This country needs

506
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,525
a divine act.

507
00:27:01,234 --> 00:27:01,984
How are you?

508
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,067
Fine.

509
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,901
I don't want to lose any clients.

510
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:11,567
Or get beat up.

511
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,318
Nobody will know.

512
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:15,151
I'm not here.

513
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,067
José Tomás, Alberto Arancibia.

514
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:18,901
Inside this rat lurks my mentor,

515
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,026
my best friend.

516
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,151
He came but "he's not here."

517
00:27:23,483 --> 00:27:24,192
OK?

518
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,151
Don't worry, I understand.

519
00:27:27,442 --> 00:27:29,318
Can I get you a drink?

520
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,026
Would you like that?

521
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,483
We have a group of undecided voters

522
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,942
who, in reality, would vote NO.

523
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:37,442
But the indecision

524
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:39,234
involves whether to vote or not.

525
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,109
What?

526
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:42,109
They're the old ladies,

527
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:44,400
around 60 or 65 years old,

528
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,901
middle class, or lower middle class.

529
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,109
They are scared of what NO represents,

530
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:51,318
a return to socialism, to recession,

531
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:52,942
to queues and all that.

532
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:56,276
And there's the young people who think

533
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:59,525
that this election is fixed,

534
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:00,734
and it's useless.

535
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,775
We have to find a solution.

536
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:05,318
No, a product.

537
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:06,901
We need a product

538
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,276
that is sufficiently appealing

539
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:11,817
to old ladies and to young people.

540
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,692
Ms. Carmen?

541
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,359
Do you have a second?

542
00:28:15,525 --> 00:28:17,609
We'd like to ask you something.

543
00:28:18,567 --> 00:28:22,026
While we were chatting, René told us

544
00:28:22,192 --> 00:28:23,400
that you're voting YES.

545
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:24,984
Is that true?

546
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,109
She's voting YES.

547
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:28,525
Her silence shows

548
00:28:28,692 --> 00:28:30,859
that she's voting YES.

549
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:33,734
Could you tell us why?

550
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:36,775
I'm doing fine.

551
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:40,234
My son is in college.

552
00:28:40,692 --> 00:28:41,984
My daughter has work.

553
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:44,109
And what about

554
00:28:44,276 --> 00:28:46,109
the dead, the tortured,

555
00:28:46,276 --> 00:28:47,775
and the disappeared?

556
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:49,734
What do you think about that?

557
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:52,859
It's not that I don't care about it, but

558
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:55,192
that's all in the past.

559
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,817
Democracy is the future.

560
00:28:58,442 --> 00:29:01,400
My General says we can have an opinion

561
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:02,692
thanks to this vote.

562
00:29:02,901 --> 00:29:05,192
Democracy is the problem.

563
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,775
The old man's taken hold

564
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:08,234
of the term "democracy."

565
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:11,192
We haven't worked that much,

566
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,567
we spent our time walking and eating.

567
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,775
That's work, too, José Tomás.

568
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:17,734
Isn't it, Alberto?

569
00:29:17,901 --> 00:29:18,817
No!

570
00:29:19,734 --> 00:29:20,901
We haven't talked

571
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,234
about what defines us as an opposition:

572
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:26,067
human rights,

573
00:29:26,984 --> 00:29:29,609
exile, injustice,

574
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:31,775
arbitrary arrests, torture,

575
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:33,318
disappearances.

576
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:36,026
All the pain we've lived through.

577
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,109
We didn't even mention it.

578
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:41,859
We have to.

579
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,525
It's got nothing to do with it.

580
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:44,734
We must talk about it.

581
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:45,775
It's too dark.

582
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:47,109
That's fear.

583
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:50,817
We can't bombard folks with fear.

584
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:52,942
They're scared. Terrorized.

585
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:54,942
We have to find a product

586
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,734
that appeals to people.

587
00:29:57,109 --> 00:29:59,775
Democracy isn't a product.

588
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:02,442
Fine, let's call it a concept.

589
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:04,525
We have to offer

590
00:30:04,984 --> 00:30:06,901
something pleasing,

591
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:09,483
but which has meaning, something...

592
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,817
happy.

593
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:16,026
Let's list everything that's happy.

594
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,567
Happiness, joy, fulfillment.

595
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:19,859
Yes, but what is...?

596
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,109
Springtime, parties.

597
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,859
The calm after the storm.

598
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,984
To me, democracy's fun.

599
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:30,859
It's appealing.

600
00:30:31,483 --> 00:30:32,734
It's something...

601
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:35,650
attractive to experience.

602
00:30:35,817 --> 00:30:37,442
A fun product.

603
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:39,567
Then happiness itself.

604
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:40,525
Of course.

605
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:42,901
What's happier than happiness?

606
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:43,817
Nothing.

607
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:46,109
Happiness in itself is happy.

608
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:48,400
What's happier than that?

609
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:51,318
Come on, we need to be serious here.

610
00:30:52,234 --> 00:30:54,400
If you think I'm going to stand there

611
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:56,817
in front of all the whole coalition,

612
00:30:56,984 --> 00:30:58,151
and say our campaign

613
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,859
will be based on jokes,

614
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:02,109
and happiness,

615
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:02,984
you're nuts.

616
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:04,567
It's totally naïve

617
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:05,859
and disrespectful.

618
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:09,067
We have to consider their pain,

619
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,775
their neglect.

620
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:12,109
Where is that?

621
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,359
How am I going to tell them

622
00:31:13,525 --> 00:31:14,901
that our concept is happiness?

623
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:15,901
Why not?

624
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:33,901
How's it going?

625
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,442
They're there.

626
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:38,442
Pass me the...

627
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:39,400
Now?

628
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:40,859
Thank you.

629
00:31:41,026 --> 00:31:42,151
You're welcome.

630
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:44,942
They're here.

631
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:46,234
I'm on it.

632
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,067
Hey, Diego.

633
00:32:00,567 --> 00:32:01,984
This is what we have.

634
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:07,483
I like these ones best.

635
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,609
And Guzman?

636
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:11,609
Is he watching you?

637
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:13,067
Is he watching me?

638
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,109
How?

639
00:32:14,276 --> 00:32:15,775
No, he won't know how.

640
00:32:15,942 --> 00:32:17,609
Great. Is he here or not?

641
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:18,650
No.

642
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,483
Fine.

643
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,650
Look, here he is.

644
00:32:20,817 --> 00:32:21,525
Fernando.

645
00:32:21,692 --> 00:32:22,483
How are you?

646
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,942
It's good to see you.

647
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,151
René Saavedra, Fernando Costa.

648
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,318
We know each other.

649
00:32:26,483 --> 00:32:27,151
Really?

650
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:28,151
Through work.

651
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:30,067
I've rescued him before.

652
00:32:31,234 --> 00:32:32,483
He's going to work with us

653
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,734
as a director.

654
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,650
You know very well

655
00:32:36,817 --> 00:32:38,984
that I don't do that.

656
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,151
You've done it a thousand times.

657
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:47,026
I don't know, call up a rocker,

658
00:32:47,192 --> 00:32:49,026
a folk singer,

659
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:50,734
someone to write an anthem.

660
00:32:50,901 --> 00:32:53,483
No. I want a jingle.

661
00:32:54,692 --> 00:32:56,067
No art,

662
00:32:57,318 --> 00:32:59,942
no folk, no pop, no rock,

663
00:33:00,483 --> 00:33:01,400
a jingle.

664
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:02,442
Do you really think

665
00:33:02,609 --> 00:33:04,234
they'll let us go out on air?

666
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,276
Yes.

667
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,109
They'll throw us in jail!

668
00:33:08,276 --> 00:33:09,067
We don't know.

669
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:09,942
We don't?

670
00:33:10,109 --> 00:33:11,234
We don't know.

671
00:33:11,692 --> 00:33:13,442
The key thing is all being here.

672
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:15,775
Thanks. Many wouldn't have dared.

673
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:17,067
Listen,

674
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:20,359
if you draw a line with this vote,

675
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:22,109
what's left?

676
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,234
No more!

677
00:33:25,026 --> 00:33:27,234
No more Pinochet and dictatorship!

678
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,276
Well?

679
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:29,318
It could work!

680
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,817
It's perfect, man.

681
00:33:30,984 --> 00:33:32,483
No more torture, no more deaths.

682
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,775
No more censorship.

683
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,151
No more abuse.

684
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,026
No more debt, no more interest,

685
00:33:38,192 --> 00:33:39,817
no more unpaid bills.

686
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:42,650
How's things with you?

687
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:44,650
We need more people, more time.

688
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:45,859
More content.

689
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,234
We have to fill 15 minutes

690
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,775
every day for a month.

691
00:33:48,942 --> 00:33:50,483
They fill each day.

692
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,067
3 weeks to go and we got nothing.

693
00:33:53,234 --> 00:33:54,192
15 minutes is too much!

694
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,775
We better get to work.

695
00:33:55,942 --> 00:33:58,567
That one... It's finished.

696
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:00,483
See you at the production office.

697
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:02,609
Yeah, he's coming.

698
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:05,442
How are you, Lucho?

699
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,525
We're about to begin.

700
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:11,775
Is everything OK?

701
00:34:11,942 --> 00:34:13,151
Yeah. How are you?

702
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:14,026
Fine.

703
00:34:14,192 --> 00:34:15,151
Great.

704
00:34:17,318 --> 00:34:19,859
Weren't you going to give it up?

705
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,859
It's just advice.

706
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:27,151
Don't bullshit me, man.

707
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,234
You have an easy life with your son,

708
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,400
your own house,

709
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:35,692
a sports car,

710
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:38,109
plenty to eat.

711
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:39,942
No one has bothered you

712
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:41,775
since you got here.

713
00:34:43,276 --> 00:34:45,400
Let's be partners.

714
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:48,442
I'll cut you in on the agency.

715
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:49,692
You're a rat, boss.

716
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:50,525
Why?

717
00:34:50,692 --> 00:34:52,984
You threaten me and you offer me...

718
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:54,609
Hello. How are you?

719
00:34:54,775 --> 00:34:55,567
How are you?

720
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:56,692
How about those dishes!

721
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:57,567
They're great!

722
00:34:57,734 --> 00:34:58,483
We're ready for you.

723
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,692
We'll be right over.

724
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,609
Whenever you say!

725
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:03,942
A partnership?

726
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:05,192
Yes.

727
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,942
A good percentage.

728
00:35:07,109 --> 00:35:08,901
I'm going to do this anyway.

729
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,400
That camp.

730
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,609
Hello.

731
00:35:11,775 --> 00:35:12,650
How are you?

732
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,650
Nice of you to come.

733
00:35:14,817 --> 00:35:16,276
Hello. You look nice.

734
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:17,692
Thank you.

735
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:20,234
I'm handling everything, it's all fine.

736
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,859
Excellent, thank you.

737
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:24,650
This is suicide, don't be an idiot.

738
00:35:25,483 --> 00:35:26,318
Fire me.

739
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,525
First positions!

740
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:28,359
Get out.

741
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:29,442
Fire me!

742
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:30,276
Get out!

743
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:31,483
Fire me!

744
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,359
Leave.

745
00:35:32,525 --> 00:35:33,859
Go ahead, fire me.

746
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:36,901
Think about my offer. It's good.

747
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,901
Fine. We're done here. It's perfect.

748
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,276
What is it?

749
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:42,984
Important accounts

750
00:35:43,151 --> 00:35:44,942
from the state broadcaster.

751
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,276
I'll talk with the bitch. Where is she?

752
00:35:47,442 --> 00:35:48,525
Over there.

753
00:35:49,151 --> 00:35:51,483
It's great, isn't it?

754
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,525
It's perfect.

755
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:54,400
Everything OK?

756
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:55,276
Is it working?

757
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:56,109
Yes.

758
00:35:56,276 --> 00:35:57,067
Is it?

759
00:35:57,234 --> 00:35:58,318
Chicken.

760
00:35:58,483 --> 00:35:59,650
Mind the radiation.

761
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:02,942
Don't get too close.

762
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:03,901
I'll stay away.

763
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:04,901
Yes.

764
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:08,567
I don't think this thing's very safe.

765
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:10,609
You OK with the skirt?

766
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:12,318
Yes, I feel comfortable.

767
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:13,359
Good.

768
00:36:13,817 --> 00:36:16,318
Great. Everything suits you.

769
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:20,318
It's really good. It's beautiful.

770
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:21,692
What dish did you choose?

771
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:22,525
What?

772
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:23,817
What dish did you choose?

773
00:36:23,984 --> 00:36:25,234
We'll start with dessert.

774
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,192
We're getting ready to shoot.

775
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:31,734
First of all,

776
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:34,192
I'd like to say

777
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,192
that what you're about to see

778
00:36:37,775 --> 00:36:41,067
fits with the current social context.

779
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,400
After all, today,

780
00:36:45,026 --> 00:36:46,984
Chile is thinking of its future.

781
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,067
Let's go.

782
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:55,525
{\i1}They say what they like{\i}

783
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:58,151
{\i1}I have freedom of thought{\i}

784
00:36:59,234 --> 00:37:01,234
{\i1}Because I feel it's time{\i}

785
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,026
{\i1}To find freedom{\i}

786
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,859
{\i1}We're tired of the abuse{\i}

787
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:12,276
{\i1}It's time to change{\i}

788
00:37:12,817 --> 00:37:15,901
{\i1}We're done with poverty{\i}

789
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:19,151
{\i1}I'm going to say NO{\i}

790
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:25,151
{\i1}Chile{\i}

791
00:37:25,318 --> 00:37:27,984
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

792
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:30,817
{\i1}Chile{\i}

793
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:33,692
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

794
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,692
Is that all you have?

795
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:45,567
Because...

796
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:48,442
This is all we have as,

797
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:50,817
let's say, a draft.

798
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,859
This is the campaign.

799
00:37:53,234 --> 00:37:55,151
It's like an ad for Coca-Cola.

800
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:56,734
It's more than that!

801
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:01,359
With all due respect,

802
00:38:01,525 --> 00:38:03,901
we're doing something much more serious.

803
00:38:04,942 --> 00:38:06,067
I was also exiled.

804
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,442
He's Manuel Saavedra's son,

805
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,151
I don't know if you know him.

806
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:10,734
Everyone knows Manuel Saavedra.

807
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:14,567
We're using advertising language

808
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:17,609
that is universal, familiar, attractive,

809
00:38:18,692 --> 00:38:19,901
optimistic,

810
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:23,483
but with a political concept behind it.

811
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:25,067
Ricardo.

812
00:38:27,483 --> 00:38:28,276
Look, José Tomás,

813
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:30,984
I understand perfectly well that

814
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,942
there's advertising semiology.

815
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,442
This is a campaign.

816
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:38,775
We must be pragmatic.

817
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,650
We are, by getting involved in

818
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:43,400
a referendum held for the dictatorship.

819
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:44,525
We're taking big risks,

820
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,442
we have no idea what's going to happen.

821
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:47,650
I understand.

822
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:49,609
But I also understand

823
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:51,942
that there are ethical limits.

824
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:54,109
What's your name?

825
00:38:54,942 --> 00:38:55,859
René Saavedra.

826
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:56,817
René.

827
00:38:56,984 --> 00:38:58,942
I knew your father very well.

828
00:38:59,318 --> 00:39:02,192
René, maybe in your editing room,

829
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:05,359
making ads for big corporations,

830
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:07,775
you've lost a little perspective.

831
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:09,734
We have physically suffered

832
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,067
the violence of this dictatorship.

833
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,650
My brother has disappeared,

834
00:39:15,192 --> 00:39:17,483
my best friends' throats cut.

835
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:20,276
This is a campaign of silence.

836
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,483
We understand, and for good reason,

837
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,525
your pain,

838
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:27,400
and the pain of all of those involved.

839
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:29,650
But you're missing a key point.

840
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,775
I'm not an idiot, José Tomás.

841
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:34,151
I get what this is about.

842
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:36,067
This is legitimization.

843
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:38,318
This is a campaign to silence

844
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:40,359
what has really happened.

845
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:42,359
I'm shocked, Fernando.

846
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:44,525
I'm sorry, comrade and friend of mine,

847
00:39:44,692 --> 00:39:46,109
you're involved in this shit.

848
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:50,901
I see here what you really are.

849
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:53,234
Those images are what you are.

850
00:39:53,442 --> 00:39:55,775
I see your point, but understand...

851
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:58,192
I understand perfectly well!

852
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:00,567
But I will not be party to something

853
00:40:00,734 --> 00:40:03,318
for which history will never forgive us!

854
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,483
So you can go fuck yourself, asshole.

855
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:08,525
Go get fucked, yourself.

856
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:11,276
Excuse me.

857
00:40:22,276 --> 00:40:23,359
Listen.

858
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:26,234
Yes.

859
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,775
Where are the parties in this?

860
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,234
They're here, in this idea.

861
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,234
I see all the parties,

862
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,318
but you explain it better.

863
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:39,525
The rainbow represents

864
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:41,609
all the political parties?

865
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,234
Is that the idea?

866
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,359
Yes, they're all there.

867
00:40:45,525 --> 00:40:48,442
It's all in the rainbow.

868
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:50,567
All the party colors

869
00:40:50,734 --> 00:40:52,775
and political tendencies are there.

870
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:55,067
For example: the red,

871
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:56,359
which is very powerful,

872
00:40:56,525 --> 00:40:58,901
represents the radicals, communism.

873
00:40:59,067 --> 00:41:00,067
Socialism!

874
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:01,151
Sorry, socialism.

875
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:03,567
There's blue, that's very...

876
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:04,734
The most hopeful one,

877
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:07,026
for the Christian Democrats.

878
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:09,359
The green is totally...

879
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:11,026
Social Democrat.

880
00:41:11,483 --> 00:41:13,859
Orange for the Humanists,

881
00:41:14,026 --> 00:41:16,901
and all those who feel included in that.

882
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,318
The PPD can also feel included.

883
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:21,359
All the colors are there.

884
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:23,901
And they all, democratically,

885
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,609
bring their differences to the NOs.

886
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:54,817
I'll go on foot.

887
00:41:55,109 --> 00:41:56,109
Comrade?

888
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:59,192
Are you ashamed to be with us?

889
00:42:02,192 --> 00:42:04,400
Goodbye, brave one!

890
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,359
Don't be an asshole!

891
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,318
You misunderstand our politicians.

892
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:11,442
Some are worth the bother.

893
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:12,942
Please!

894
00:42:14,483 --> 00:42:16,609
They all want out while they can.

895
00:42:16,775 --> 00:42:18,567
We already got what we wanted.

896
00:42:18,734 --> 00:42:20,609
Now it's time to work!

897
00:42:56,859 --> 00:42:58,026
Excuse me, René,

898
00:42:58,234 --> 00:43:00,067
I don't mean to be a pain,

899
00:43:00,234 --> 00:43:01,942
but what is this shit?

900
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:03,901
Are you selling chickens?

901
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:05,901
It's something else, Veronica.

902
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,109
Then, this is it.

903
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:10,942
NO, orange, NO, singing bird,

904
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:12,192
NON, petit arbre.

905
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,234
NO, mental age of 5.

906
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,984
No, it's not that.

907
00:43:16,525 --> 00:43:17,400
Shit!

908
00:43:18,692 --> 00:43:19,650
This.

909
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:21,525
NO, rainbow.

910
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:23,442
Almost. That one, yes.

911
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:25,067
Almost.

912
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:26,026
OK.

913
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,567
Something like...

914
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,942
Yes.

915
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,192
Looks good on you.

916
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:46,151
But we're going to win.

917
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:47,276
With that?

918
00:43:47,442 --> 00:43:49,151
Yes. With that.

919
00:43:49,901 --> 00:43:50,775
Sure.

920
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:20,400
Where were you, man?

921
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:26,984
I was at the station.

922
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:30,859
They want the title to be:

923
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:33,026
"Hair Salon Love."

924
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:34,901
No, that's really bad.

925
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:36,609
Really bad.

926
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:38,609
Too menopausal.

927
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:45,234
Can I have that?

928
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:48,318
Thank you.

929
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:50,942
You've got a lot of nerve.

930
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:58,318
This is going to make us famous.

931
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:33,151
A rainbow?

932
00:45:33,318 --> 00:45:35,026
Yes, a rainbow.

933
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,734
But it's for faggots, isn't it?

934
00:45:40,151 --> 00:45:41,567
No, I think it has to do

935
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:44,192
with the flag of the Mapuche people.

936
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,359
Gay Mapuches?

937
00:45:46,525 --> 00:45:48,650
No, Mapuche Indians.

938
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:55,609
Do you know why you're paranoid?

939
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:57,609
Because you've got

940
00:45:57,775 --> 00:45:59,483
homosexual communists

941
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,483
there in your office.

942
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:02,984
No Mr. Minister, in my office.

943
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,609
there are no homosexuals nor commies.

944
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:09,483
Don't worry about it.

945
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,775
No-one will see that propaganda.

946
00:46:11,942 --> 00:46:13,192
You think?

947
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:15,984
Of course. Everyone will be sleeping.

948
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:16,942
I'm sleeping at that time.

949
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:17,901
Me too.

950
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,692
See? Everyone's sleeping.

951
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:24,942
Who's behind the NO campaign?

952
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:26,734
I don't know any of those people.

953
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:28,400
Who are they?

954
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:31,817
People too much at ease for me.

955
00:46:33,442 --> 00:46:35,692
Be careful what you say, Guzman.

956
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:36,817
If I open that door

957
00:46:36,984 --> 00:46:38,817
you have to close your eyes.

958
00:47:04,483 --> 00:47:06,692
Give me that.

959
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:11,525
Stay here.

960
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:24,984
MARXIST TRAITOR

961
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:39,276
Don't go out!

962
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:40,775
Carmen!

963
00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:44,942
What are you doing?

964
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:54,650
What are you doing here?

965
00:47:54,817 --> 00:47:56,901
Go to bed.

966
00:47:57,442 --> 00:48:00,483
Go! This is a nice neighborhood.

967
00:48:15,942 --> 00:48:17,609
Go to bed, Ma'am!

968
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:21,109
Go to bed, you old bitch!

969
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:26,067
Brats.

970
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,984
Let's go inside, Carmen.

971
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:47,525
Did you see them? Do you know them?

972
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:49,067
I saw them up close.

973
00:48:49,234 --> 00:48:50,734
What happened?

974
00:48:51,067 --> 00:48:53,318
We were all threatened last night.

975
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:56,067
Not me, as no-one knows I'm here.

976
00:48:56,234 --> 00:48:58,109
Why are you surprised?

977
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,318
They know where we live and work,

978
00:49:00,483 --> 00:49:02,359
they know everything.

979
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:05,109
Calm down, we'll be fine.

980
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,901
The eyes of the world are watching us.

981
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:10,609
I've been being followed for ages.

982
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:13,026
It's normal that they follow us.

983
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,650
It means we're doing well.

984
00:49:14,817 --> 00:49:16,525
We're getting to them.

985
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:18,567
We have to go to the theater.

986
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:20,192
The actors are waiting.

987
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:21,483
Let's go.

988
00:49:24,026 --> 00:49:26,817
Let's go again! From the top!

989
00:49:28,026 --> 00:49:28,734
Come on.

990
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:29,609
From the top.

991
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:32,775
This is a positive message, isn't it?

992
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:35,067
With happiness and...

993
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,567
Smiling... As much as you can.

994
00:49:37,734 --> 00:49:39,067
We'll try.

995
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:42,692
Like "We Are The World". Up there.

996
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,609
No. Nothing like that!

997
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:50,525
No.

998
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:51,442
That was never...

999
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:53,650
No. Let's go.

1000
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:04,109
{\i1}It isn't a ring shining on your finger{\i}

1001
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:06,901
{\i1}It isn't the prince of the gypsies{\i}

1002
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:09,483
{\i1}It isn't the sword of a musketeer{\i}

1003
00:50:09,859 --> 00:50:12,483
{\i1}It isn't a mystery for the sorcerer{\i}

1004
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:16,067
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1005
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:18,901
{\i1}I don't want it, no{\i}

1006
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:20,942
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1007
00:50:21,483 --> 00:50:24,109
{\i1}I don't want it, no, no{\i}

1008
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:28,026
{\i1}I hate seeing him every day{\i}

1009
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,901
{\i1}I don't like his cold smile{\i}

1010
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:33,442
{\i1}I don't like his literature{\i}

1011
00:50:33,817 --> 00:50:36,650
{\i1}I'm depressed by his mini-culture{\i}

1012
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,359
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1013
00:50:40,192 --> 00:50:42,400
{\i1}I don't want it, no{\i}

1014
00:50:42,984 --> 00:50:44,692
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1015
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:47,067
{\i1}I don't want it, no, no{\i}

1016
00:50:49,234 --> 00:50:51,901
{\i1}His words and deeds bring nothing{\i}

1017
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:54,817
{\i1}He's no leader to follow{\i}

1018
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:57,609
{\i1}His words fail to move me{\i}

1019
00:50:57,817 --> 00:51:00,775
{\i1}He simply cannot move me{\i}

1020
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,109
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1021
00:51:03,942 --> 00:51:05,817
{\i1}I don't want it, no{\i}

1022
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:08,609
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1023
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:11,276
{\i1}I don't want it, no, no{\i}

1024
00:51:12,026 --> 00:51:13,276
The editing room is in back.

1025
00:51:13,692 --> 00:51:14,734
Action!

1026
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:20,734
Action!

1027
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,942
{\i1}Don't think that he's indispensable{\i}

1028
00:51:40,109 --> 00:51:42,692
{\i1}Don't think that he's eternal {\i}

1029
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:45,525
{\i1}Don't fluster me with nonsense{\i}

1030
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,109
{\i1}I don't like him in any way{\i}

1031
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:51,567
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1032
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,234
{\i1}I don't want it, no{\i}

1033
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,151
Let's do the shot now.

1034
00:51:57,318 --> 00:51:58,525
Ready, Matías?

1035
00:51:58,692 --> 00:51:59,942
We got it.

1036
00:52:01,775 --> 00:52:03,442
Silence! Sound?

1037
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:04,525
Rolling!

1038
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:06,234
Camera?

1039
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Speed!

1040
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:08,318
Action!

1041
00:52:08,483 --> 00:52:09,901
Isn't he too tall?

1042
00:52:10,067 --> 00:52:11,483
No, he's perfect.

1043
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:15,151
{\i1}I don't like it, no{\i}

1044
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:16,026
What happened?

1045
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:16,901
Fernando?

1046
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,984
Get me some homemade bread...

1047
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:19,984
It's weird.

1048
00:52:20,151 --> 00:52:21,734
There's nothing else right now.

1049
00:52:21,901 --> 00:52:22,775
No, but how...

1050
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:24,609
Fernando, please.

1051
00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:28,942
Fernando, this looks good.

1052
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:30,359
I don't care,

1053
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:32,234
no one eats baguettes here.

1054
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,151
It's fine. It's not a problem. It works.

1055
00:52:35,692 --> 00:52:37,901
It needs identity.

1056
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:39,942
Is this a picnic to you?

1057
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,109
What did we talk about?

1058
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:44,692
People have to see themselves in it.

1059
00:52:44,859 --> 00:52:46,942
Please, it's lovely. It's fine.

1060
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:48,400
It's great.

1061
00:52:48,567 --> 00:52:49,817
It looks nice.

1062
00:52:49,984 --> 00:52:50,942
Fernando, it's great.

1063
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:52,942
Help me. Stop being a drag.

1064
00:52:54,525 --> 00:52:56,151
Hello, Pato, how are you?

1065
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:57,442
Thank you for coming.

1066
00:52:57,609 --> 00:52:59,276
Hello, Patricio. How are you?

1067
00:52:59,984 --> 00:53:01,234
How are you, Pato?

1068
00:53:02,567 --> 00:53:04,192
Hello. René Saavedra.

1069
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:05,483
How are you?

1070
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:08,650
We'll mike you up.

1071
00:53:09,192 --> 00:53:10,901
Silence, we're going to roll.

1072
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,483
Three...

1073
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:15,318
Two...

1074
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,859
One... Action!

1075
00:53:17,026 --> 00:53:19,984
{\i1}We democrats are transparent.{\i}

1076
00:53:20,483 --> 00:53:23,318
{\i1}We understand that government,{\i}

1077
00:53:23,483 --> 00:53:24,775
{\i1}or "public affairs"{\i}

1078
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:26,234
{\i1}to the Romans,{\i}

1079
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,026
{\i1}interests us all{\i}

1080
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:32,525
{\i1}and should take place in public view.{\i}

1081
00:53:34,026 --> 00:53:36,067
{\i1}I am trained in democracy.{\i}

1082
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,276
{\i1}Chilean democracy{\i}

1083
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:41,650
{\i1}made great efforts{\i}

1084
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:44,276
{\i1}to move our country forward,{\i}

1085
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:47,276
{\i1}to stimulate its growth,{\i}

1086
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:49,984
{\i1}for social justice...{\i}

1087
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:52,650
René.

1088
00:53:54,192 --> 00:53:55,192
René.

1089
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,400
What's up, man? Don't be childish.

1090
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:00,942
You think they're ruining your campaign,

1091
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:02,650
and we're losing votes?

1092
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:04,276
What's up with you?

1093
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,234
Nothing.

1094
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,734
I think there is.

1095
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,483
It doesn't belong to you.

1096
00:54:15,192 --> 00:54:17,026
They have the right to speak.

1097
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:18,567
We've kept our mouths shut

1098
00:54:18,734 --> 00:54:20,901
for too long now.

1099
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:23,775
Important people are involved.

1100
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:26,026
It's a drag.

1101
00:54:26,984 --> 00:54:28,026
Action!

1102
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:52,234
{\i1}I'm the mother{\i}

1103
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,650
{\i1}of Alfredo Rojas Castañeda, disappeared{\i}

1104
00:54:55,817 --> 00:54:58,318
{\i1}on March 4, 1975.{\i}

1105
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:00,817
{\i1}I'm the sister of Nicomedes Segundo.{\i}

1106
00:55:01,192 --> 00:55:03,026
{\i1}I'm the wife of Enrique...{\i}

1107
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:04,859
{\i1}Newton Morales Saavedra...{\i}

1108
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:06,234
{\i1}...detained...{\i}

1109
00:55:06,525 --> 00:55:07,817
{\i1}I'm the mother of Manuel...{\i}

1110
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:08,901
{\i1}Miguel Angel...{\i}

1111
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:10,234
{\i1}...disappeared...{\i}

1112
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:12,567
{\i1}I'm the sister of Ruperto Torres,{\i}

1113
00:55:12,734 --> 00:55:17,151
{\i1}disappeared 13 October 1973.{\i}

1114
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,817
{\i1}You can decide{\i}

1115
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,318
{\i1}to never let this happen again.{\i}

1116
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,567
{\i1}No more disappearances.{\i}

1117
00:55:53,901 --> 00:55:55,067
It's good.

1118
00:55:55,442 --> 00:55:57,359
It's good, but a little ugly.

1119
00:55:57,984 --> 00:56:00,151
It doesn't fit with what we're doing.

1120
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,734
We're using it, no matter what.

1121
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:05,151
Why?

1122
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:07,026
Because it's good.

1123
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:09,234
Because it has content,

1124
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,109
and we have 15 minutes to fill.

1125
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:13,483
No matter what? Why that tone?

1126
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:16,151
What tone?

1127
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:20,109
Who makes the decisions here?

1128
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,276
You're not the boss, you know.

1129
00:56:23,442 --> 00:56:25,109
I'm not arguing this bullshit.

1130
00:56:25,276 --> 00:56:27,359
What bullshit, motherfucker?

1131
00:56:27,567 --> 00:56:29,609
We're working. Take it easy!

1132
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:31,359
This isn't personal!

1133
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:33,318
My joy is different than yours.

1134
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:35,067
Oh, really? What's mine then?

1135
00:56:35,234 --> 00:56:36,359
I don't know.

1136
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:38,984
What happened here in the last 15 years

1137
00:56:39,151 --> 00:56:40,650
was never shown on TV

1138
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,734
Doing that now is my joy.

1139
00:56:42,901 --> 00:56:45,567
Yes, but if it goes wrong,

1140
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:47,318
it's going to look pathetic.

1141
00:56:47,483 --> 00:56:48,692
It works.

1142
00:56:50,483 --> 00:56:52,192
I got goosebumps.

1143
00:56:53,026 --> 00:56:55,525
It's visceral. I love it.

1144
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:57,483
I'd put it in.

1145
00:56:57,692 --> 00:56:58,984
It's in then.

1146
00:57:03,442 --> 00:57:05,151
And what if we mention it's been

1147
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:08,026
15 years since we've had a show

1148
00:57:08,192 --> 00:57:09,859
that is dissident?

1149
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:11,817
Yes, of course. There's...

1150
00:57:11,984 --> 00:57:13,318
the greeting, right?

1151
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:15,984
The slogan is "Happiness is coming."

1152
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:18,151
"Chile, happiness is coming."

1153
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:19,734
"Hello. Chile, happiness is coming."

1154
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:21,276
No, actually...

1155
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:23,400
"Chile, happiness is coming"

1156
00:57:23,567 --> 00:57:24,984
and "hello" after.

1157
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,359
Weird, right?

1158
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:28,734
Yes, but I think it works.

1159
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:31,442
And then, "It's been 15 years since..."

1160
00:57:31,609 --> 00:57:32,984
Exactly.

1161
00:57:34,192 --> 00:57:36,567
We could try it once.

1162
00:57:36,734 --> 00:57:37,734
If not, we start over.

1163
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:39,151
You're shooting it.

1164
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:40,775
Perfect, thank you.

1165
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:42,483
We'll do it then.

1166
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:43,692
OK.

1167
00:57:45,067 --> 00:57:46,151
Rolling.

1168
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:49,276
Mark.

1169
00:57:49,442 --> 00:57:51,359
Patricio Bañados, take one.

1170
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:52,525
And...

1171
00:57:53,775 --> 00:57:54,734
Action.

1172
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:58,192
Chile, happiness is coming.

1173
00:57:58,359 --> 00:57:59,609
Hello.

1174
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:01,817
For the first time in 15 years,

1175
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:04,442
{\i1}those who don't share {\i}

1176
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:05,525
{\i1}the official point of view{\i}

1177
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:06,775
{\i1}are talking to you{\i}

1178
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,692
{\i1}through their own TV show.{\i}

1179
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,400
{\i1}I am returning to my profession{\i}

1180
00:58:12,567 --> 00:58:14,692
{\i1}that I was removed from.{\i}

1181
00:58:15,276 --> 00:58:17,775
{\i1}15 minutes in 15 years isn't much.{\i}

1182
00:58:17,942 --> 00:58:19,859
{\i1}Let's talk about that coming happiness.{\i}

1183
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,567
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

1184
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:24,859
{\i1}Chile{\i}

1185
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,901
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

1186
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:30,234
{\i1}Chile{\i}

1187
00:58:30,734 --> 00:58:32,359
{\i1}Happiness is coming{\i}

1188
00:58:33,984 --> 00:58:35,901
{\i1}They say what they like{\i}

1189
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:38,442
{\i1}I have freedom of thought{\i}

1190
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:41,067
{\i1}I feel that it's time{\i}

1191
00:58:41,234 --> 00:58:42,984
{\i1}To find freedom{\i}

1192
00:58:43,692 --> 00:58:46,400
{\i1}We're tired of the abuse{\i}

1193
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,817
{\i1}It's time to change{\i}

1194
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,859
{\i1}We're done with poverty{\i}

1195
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:53,442
{\i1}I'm going to say NO{\i}

1196
00:58:54,234 --> 00:58:56,650
{\i1}A rainbow is born{\i}

1197
00:58:56,859 --> 00:58:58,775
{\i1}After the storm{\i}

1198
00:58:59,276 --> 00:59:01,109
{\i1}I want to see flourish{\i}

1199
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:03,650
{\i1}A thousand ways of thinking{\i}

1200
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:06,775
{\i1}Without dictatorship{\i}

1201
00:59:06,942 --> 00:59:08,775
{\i1}Happiness will come{\i}

1202
00:59:09,692 --> 00:59:11,483
{\i1}I think about the future{\i}

1203
00:59:12,567 --> 00:59:14,318
{\i1}I'm going to say NO{\i}

1204
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,276
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

1205
00:59:17,483 --> 00:59:19,942
{\i1}With the power of my voice{\i}

1206
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:21,901
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}

1207
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:25,109
{\i1}I sing it without fear{\i}

1208
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:26,525
{\i1}We're going to say NO{\i}
