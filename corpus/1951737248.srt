1
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,400
...duty to welcome you
here on the behalf of...

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,700
...all the other artists, and musicians
with combined talents...

3
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,400
...went in to the creation of this
new form of entertainment: Fantasia.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
What you'll see on the screen...

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,400
...is a picture of various abstract images...

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
...that might pass to your mind...

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,000
...if you seat in a concert hall,
listening to this music.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,500
Now, there are three kinds
of music on this fantasia program.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,900
First is the kind
that tells a definite story.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,100
Then there's the kind that,
while has no specific plot...

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,200
...does paint a series
of more or less definite pictures.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,300
And there's the third kind;
music that exist simply for tones sake.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,200
And the number that opens
out Fantasia program...

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
...is music of this third kind.

15
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,400
You know, what's amazing is that many of
these musicians are playing for the very first time.

16
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Thanks to Steve Martin's two week
Master Musician Home Study Course.

17
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,600
More about that later.

18
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Hello and welcome
to Fantasia 2000.

19
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,400
 It's been more that 60 years since
Walt Disney and his artists teamed up...

20
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,600
...with Maestro Leopold Stokowski
to create a film they titled: The Concert Feature.

21
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,300
I think, we're all glad that they
changed the name to Fantasia.

22
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,700
You know, Fantasia was meant
to be a perpetual work in progress.

23
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,200
Every time you went to see it, you'd experience
some new pieces along of some old familiar favorites 

24
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,900
But that idea felt
by the way side until now.

25
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,500
So, let me turn things over
to the great Itzhak Perlman...

26
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,000
...who, I've just been informed,
plays the violin.

27
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,200
Well, so do I.
Can I have my violin, please?

28
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,400
Ah, thank you.

29
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,600
All right, boys.
Hoo. Oh, sorry.

30
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Could I have another string thingy please?
Oh, and camera back on me?

31
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,600
Camera back on me!

32
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,900
When you hear a title like Pines of Rome,
you might think of tree line streets and romantic ruins.

33
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,000
But when the Disney animators
heard this music...

34
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,700
...they thought of something
completely different.

35
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,700
Here is the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
conducted by Maestro James Levin...

36
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,400
...performing Ottorino Respigi's
Pines of Rome.

37
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Hi. Next, we're gonna take you
to the streets of New York City...

38
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,900
...for piece that's been inspired
by couple of my favorite artists.

39
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,300
First, there's the illustrator Al Hirschfeld,

40
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,300
who's been drawing celebrities and
Broadway stars for most of the 20th century.

41
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,200
And then, there's the composer
and song writer George Gerschwin,

42
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,400
who took Jazz off the streets,
dressed her up and took it to the concert hall.

43
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,500
My friend Ralph Grierson
plays piano on this next number.

44
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,900
And it all starts with the single slinky note
on the clarinet and a simple line on a piece of paper.

45
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
Rhapsody in Blue.

46
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,100
Hi. You may not know this,
but over the years...

47
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:26,300
...the Disney artists have cooked up
dozens of ideas for new Fantasia segments.

48
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,600
Some of them made it
to the big screen this time...

49
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,700
but others, lots of others
- how can I put this politely - didn't.

50
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,800
For example:
The Danish illustrator Kay Nielsen...

51
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,600
...drew these sketches for a segment
inspired by Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries.

52
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,900
Here they are.
And there they go.

53
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,200
Now, Salvador Dali, you know,
the limp watches guy...

54
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,500
he got in to the act with an idea that
featured baseball as a metaphor for life.

55
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,400
How come that didn't work?
Makes perfect sense to me!

56
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Let's see. Then, we had a bug ballet, and a baby ballet, and for a time,

57
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,700
they even considered the sequence inspired by the polka and the fuge.

58
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,000
From Weinberger's Schwanda, the bagpiper.

59
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,900
But finally - a success.

60
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:18,600
The Disney artists wanted to create a short film
based on Hans Christian Anderson's wonderful fairytale -

61
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,100
The Steadfast Tin Soldier. But they could
never find the perfect musical match.

62
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Until now.

63
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Here is Yefim Bronfman playing
Schostakovich Piano Concerto No. 2...

64
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,300
...and the Steadfast Tin Soldier.
