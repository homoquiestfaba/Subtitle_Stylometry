you that little bitch

(Vince) No, I believe
you got me mistaken.

351
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,710
That actually was Trey.

So it was you.

this is next time.

wouldn't be appropriate.

520
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:14,734
(Trey) Look, I'm not trying
to get married or anything.

521
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,213
<i>I just thought we could</i>
<i>be friends or something.</i>

522
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,251
<i>Look.</i>

523
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,585
Here's my number again.

524
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,783
No strings attached.

525
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,950
If you ever want
to talk to me,

526
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:32,190
just call me
on one of your cell phones.

527
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,566
<i>(Sida)</i>
<i>Snap out of it, okay?</i>

528
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,727
He is not
on Carlton's level,

529
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,930
not even a little bit.

530
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,441
(Keily) And what exactly
is Carlton's level, Sida?

531
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,066
(Sida) You know I'm not
a big fan of Carlton,

532
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,373
but he is at least
a step up from him.

533
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,574
Goodness gracious.

534
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,584
[knocking at door]

535
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,155
(Trey)
Hello?

536
00:20:58,223 --> 00:20:59,622
Southside Barbecue.

537
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:00,623
(Katherine)
The door's open.

538
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:01,624
Come on in.

539
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,024
I just came
out of the shower.

540
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,063
(Trey)
Oh, okay.

541
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:19,304
Place looks familiar.

542
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,868
Been here before.

543
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,878
This is real nice.

544
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,778
I like this.

545
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:30,887
(Katherine)
Hey.

546
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,184
(Trey)
Hey.

547
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,519
(Katherine)
I know you.

548
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,116
(Trey) Yeah, I was
just looking around

549
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:37,821
and said I delivered
food here for you before.

550
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,296
(Katherine)
Yeah, it's not every day

551
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:44,131
that I get a cute young man
to deliver my food for me.

552
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,533
(Trey)
Me?

553
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,536
(Katherine)
Yeah.

554
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,731
Have a seat.

555
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,171
I got your money
right over here.

556
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,902
(Trey)
All right.

557
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,913
(Katherine)
Oh, sh-

558
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:05,723
This is a mess.

559
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,493
Oh.

560
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,654
Um, you didn't see that,
did you?

561
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,630
(Trey)
No, not all of it.

562
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,997
(Katherine)
I'm so embarrassed.

563
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,433
(Trey)
Don't be, ma'am.

564
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,561
I mean,
you have a nice body.

565
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,866
Please don't call me ma'am.

566
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,031
It makes me feel old.

567
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:23,233
Just call me Kat.

568
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:28,007
Kat, you have a nice body.

569
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,159
Kat, right?

570
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,261
(Katherine)
Mm-hmm.

571
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,507
What are you thinking?

572
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,675
(Trey) I don't know.
A lot of things.

573
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,777
(Katherine)
Like?

574
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,312
(Trey)
Like, I don't know.

575
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:16,293
(Katherine) Well, what do
you want to know about me?

576
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,659
(Trey)
Well, I know, every year,

577
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,699
you let the AKKs
throw a party at your house.

578
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,235
That's about it.

579
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,234
(Katherine)
Okay, well,

580
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,635
I'm sure that's not
the only thing you're thinking,

581
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,665
so let me just let you know
that I don't make it a habit

582
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,405
to sleep with men
five or six years my junior

583
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:37,471
who deliver ribs
to my house.

584
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,143
And, yes,
I'm married.

585
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:44,882
But I'm separated,
and it's going on two years now.

586
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:51,191
And, yes,
you were incredible.

587
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,491
(Trey)
Are you serious?

588
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:56,091
(Katherine)
Yeah.

589
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,102
Do you have a girlfriend?

590
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,694
(Trey) Nah, nah, not really.

591
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:06,108
(Katherine) It's usually a "yes" or
"no" answer that follows that question.

592
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,669
(Trey)
Well, not at the moment.

593
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,681
She kind of occupied
at the present time, you know,

594
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:13,809
so no.

595
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,045
(Katherine)
Can I ask you something?

596
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:22,753
(Trey)
Sure.

597
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,557
(Katherine) Can you
keep this between us?

598
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,156
I mean, you kind of caught me
at a weak moment.

599
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:31,066
(Trey)
Come on, girl.

600
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,228
You got my word.

601
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,236
I won't tell a soul.

602
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:33,737
[record scratching]

603
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,900
All she had
was just a robe on, man.

604
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,942
Next thing you know,

605
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,033
I'm trying to walk
all through it.

606
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,042
(Vince)
You lying.

607
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,043
(Trey)
What you mean, lying?

608
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:42,044
(Vince)
I don't believe that.

609
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,808
She got naked like that?

610
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:44,871
She got a big booty?

611
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,578
(Trey) Dog, the booty's so big,
I didn't know what to do with it.

612
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,449
I was looking everywhere,
you know what I'm saying?

613
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,488
Let me tell you-
let me tell you something.

614
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,954
Hey, you know
how I like booty.

615
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:52,955
You already know.

616
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:53,956
She made me work out more.

617
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,390
That's why
I'm working out right now.

618
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,059
(man) Hey, Mack, you
can't keep ignoring

619
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,597
the notices we sent you.

620
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,997
<i>(Mack) Look, I told you last
week that I was going to try</i>

621
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,400
to apply
for a second mortgage.

622
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,698
<i>(man)</i>
<i>You couldn't even get the loan</i>

623
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:07,703
for a Hot Wheels.

624
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,239
(Trey) Hey, man, you
ain't going to come in here

625
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,501
and talk to my uncle
like a little kid.

626
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,099
(Mack) Hey, Trey,
I can handle this.

627
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,405
Back up.

628
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:14,911
(man)
Take the offer, man.

629
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,744
(Mack)
I am not going to foreclose.

630
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,374
I'm going to get you
that $75,000.

631
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,387
<i>(man)</i>
<i>Talk to your uncle.</i>

632
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,891
(Trey)
Get up out of here, man.

633
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,983
(K-3)
Listen to this.

634
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,528
Three, two, wick-a-wick, one.

635
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,995
(No Doubt) Flip-a-tick,
talk the talk

636
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,656
like a clock
with a hole in my sock.

637
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,223
I could kiss a gnat
strapped with my gat.

638
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,327
I hit you with the word, y'all.

639
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,269
Like a ninja turtle,

640
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,239
I talks with the po-po.

641
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,641
And I flow
on the low-low.

642
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,679
(K-3) Can you see where
he's going with that?

643
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:49,873
I mean,
can you see it?

644
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:50,880
You see that?

645
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:51,881
It's fire right there.

646
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,882
He's hot.

647
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,714
Nobody's
talking like that.

648
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:56,048
Come on.

649
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,918
Come on.

650
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:06,054
(Vince)
Come on.

651
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,063
(Trey)
Hey, what's up, V?

652
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,064
(Vince)
Hey, what's up?

653
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,327
(Trey)
Hey, where your dad at?

654
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,426
(Vince) He's in the
back in the kitchen.

655
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,470
You okay?

656
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,334
(Trey) Yeah, I just need to
ask him something, that's all.

657
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,338
It's nothing.

658
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,874
(Vince)
Uh.

659
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,341
What the...

660
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,783
See, Vick?

661
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:37,021
This is the part of the pig
that whitey will let us eat.

662
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,086
Know what I'm saying?

663
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:42,861
And we turn it
into a delicacy,

664
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,370
'cause we creative,
you know what I'm saying?

665
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,497
<i>(Mr. Vickers) I don't
understand why that was done.</i>

666
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,902
I am so deeply troubled.

667
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:56,880
I am so ashamed.

668
00:26:56,948 --> 00:27:01,351
To do that to another
human being, that's wrong.

669
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,854
I'm sorry, man.

670
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,915
It just really hurts me
to think about it.

671
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,485
(Cinque)
It's all right, Vick.

672
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:15,124
It's just a small microcosm
of what they did to break us down.

673
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,134
(Mr. Vickers) But why would
they do that to people?

674
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,464
(Cinque) 'Cause your
people is wrong, Vick.

675
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,003
(Mr. Vickers) Yeah, but why
would they do that to everybody?

676
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,038
<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>Excuse me.</i>

677
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,801
I didn't mean
to interrupt,

678
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:26,071
but I need to talk to you,
Mr. Vickers.

679
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,839
(Mr. Vickers)
We'll continue this later.

680
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,641
(Cinque)
Yeah, you all right, Vick?

681
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:30,646
I'll holler at you.

682
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:31,682
I'm gonna be
right over here.

683
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:35,980
(Mr. Vickers)
What's up?

684
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:41,856
Well, I've been working here
for almost two years now, sir.

685
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,157
And I need
some more money, so...

686
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,891
(Mr. Vickers)
Oh, Trey...

687
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,159
(Trey) Think I could
get a raise, sir?

688
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,793
(Mr. Vickers)
I wish I could.

689
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,564
We're on a very strict budget here.

690
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,798
I just bought
a bunch of radio time.

691
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:56,465
We're pinching pennies.

692
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,133
(Trey) Well, I'll work
overtime, whatever it takes.

693
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,804
(Mr. Vickers) Trey, I cannot
afford to pay you overtime.

694
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,211
Son, you know
how hard it is

695
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,307
to run a black business
in this town?

696
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,512
And white people are not exactly
busting my door down

697
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,851
for the ribs
and the African artifacts.

698
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,723
It's just not making it,
all right?

699
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,726
I hope you understand that.

700
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,490
<i>Do you?</i>

701
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,053
(Trey)
Yes, sir.

702
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,792
I understand.

703
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,005
(Vince)
Mm, mm, mm.

704
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,570
I just love it
when you come here.

705
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:39,208
You can wash clothes for free
any time you want.

706
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:40,216
You hear me?

707
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,718
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

708
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:43,879
<i>What's up, dog?</i>
<i>Where you going?</i>

709
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,582
(Trey) Man, your dad
won't give me no raise.

710
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,750
[Vince laughing]

711
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,691
I could've told you
that wasn't gonna happen.

712
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,388
Hey, but I got
some other news, though.

713
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,953
Remember old girl
I was telling you about?

714
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,020
I've been talking to her
over the internet.

715
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,031
(Trey)
Yeah.

716
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,592
(Vince) Me and baby
about to link up.

717
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,831
(Trey) Man, how much
you spend so far?

718
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,339
(Vince)
Hey, man.

719
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,000
Now, you done known me
since we was kids, man.

720
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,704
Why you keep insulting me
with questions like that?

721
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,213
What me and this girl got
is real, man.

722
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:13,341
I mean, I'm offended that you
would even think otherwise.

723
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,578
(Trey)
How much?

724
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,744
(Vince) Man, I told
you what we got is real.

725
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,651
But it's about $700.

726
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,747
<i>About, yeah,</i>
<i>roughly $700.</i>

727
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,384
But I'm telling you, man,
what we got is real.

728
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,392
We about to walk down
the aisle.

729
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,292
We gonna two-step,
jump over the broom.

730
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,421
We got the reception planned.

731
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,466
Got ribs and chicken
for the reception.

732
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,591
It's gonna be
off the chain.

733
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,329
(Trey) Look, man, we got to
go watch the front, so come on.

734
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:33,335
(Vince)
Hey, hold on.

735
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,565
And it's not $700 anymore.

736
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,268
It's $698.50.

737
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:40,243
Mm, mm, mm.

738
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,006
I'm telling you.

739
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,607
Hey, do you want
potato salad with that?

740
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,082
Okay.

741
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:49,882
506 Castle Drive.

742
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,012
Got it.

743
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,147
All right,
see you in 30.

744
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,817
Thank you.

745
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,793
(Trey)
506 Castle Drive?

746
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,692
(Vince)
Yeah.

747
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:00,788
(Trey)
Oh, damn.

748
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,594
(Vince) Oh, snap,
is that- is that the-

749
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,759
Hold on,
I got it.

750
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:04,859
(Trey)
No, no, no, no, no.

751
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,096
Let me take this.

752
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,968
I got to go apologize
for what happened.

753
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,971
Don't worry about it.

754
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,007
(Vince)
Apologize for...

755
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,201
(Trey)
To go, please. To go!

756
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,904
506.

757
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,741
(Vince)
Blockin'.

758
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,974
(Trey) Girl, be
looking at me like that.

759
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,985
You know you wild.

760
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,248
[laughs]

761
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,654
Mm, mm, mm.

762
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:29,192
(Katherine)
Here.

763
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,522
(Trey)
What's this?

764
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:36,465
(Katherine) Just a little
something to show my appreciation.

765
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:39,162
(Trey) There's, like,
over $1,000 in here.

766
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:40,329
(Katherine)
Yeah, I know.

767
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,134
(Trey)
Nah, I can't take that.

768
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,471
(Katherine) Yes, you
can, and you will.

769
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,668
(Trey)
Nah, I can't take that.

770
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,040
I'm sorry.

771
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,079
I can't.

772
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,342
This?
No, I can't do that.

773
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,348
I can't do that.

774
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,611
I got to go.

775
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,589
[doorbell rings]

776
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,591
Oh, shit.

777
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,628
[whispering indistinctly]

778
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,403
(Katherine)
Come on.

779
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:16,463
It's just my friends.

780
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,372
Come on.

781
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,640
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

782
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,645
(Dedra)
Hey.

783
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,206
(Katherine) Um, hey,
thank you for the ribs,

784
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,911
and, you know,
I forgot your tip.

785
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:28,975
(Trey)
You know what?

786
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,213
Don't even worry
about that.

787
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,846
And have a good night.

788
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,289
And, ladies,
y'all look real nice.

789
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:35,417
Have a good night.

790
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:36,517
Good lot of food
back there.

791
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,061
I'll see you.

792
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,456
(Dedra) I know you
ain't forget his tip.

793
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:43,659
[laughing]

794
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,667
Ribs.

795
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,725
[laughing]

796
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:46,770
(Candace)
Kind of young, Kat.

797
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,237
(Katherine)
He's the delivery boy.

798
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,274
(Candace)
Mm-hmm.

799
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,308
Cute robe.

800
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:52,343
(Katherine)
I'll get the wine.

801
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,741
Y'all make a plate.

802
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:54,300
(Vince)
So what happened?

803
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,473
(Trey)
She gave me $1,000.

804
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,540
(Vince) Oh, she done
turned you into a trick.

805
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,142
(Trey)
No, that makes me the pimp.

806
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,346
(Vince)
No, she would be the pimp.

807
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,683
(Trey) No, that makes her the John.

808
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:05,688
(Vince)
So that makes you the ho.

809
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,190
- No.
- Yes.

810
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,190
(Trey)
Whatever, man.

811
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,487
She gave me a grand,
all right?

812
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,492
What you saying?

813
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,493
(Vince)
It's all right.

814
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,154
I'm just hating anyhow,
but it's cool, though,

815
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,258
because when Bunni gets here,
the script is gonna be flipped.

816
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,267
[laughing]

817
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,964
(Trey) I'm really happy
for you, man, for real, man.

818
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,301
(Vince)
Oh, no, no, no.

819
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:23,305
I'm happy.

820
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:24,671
Let me show you
what I'm doing to this room.

821
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,370
Let me show you
how I sexed this room up.

822
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,606
Check this out.

823
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,616
[smooth R&B music playing]

824
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,365
[giggling]

825
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,366
[clears throat]

826
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,700
That was, uh-
That was pretty cool, huh?

827
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,331
[humming uncomfortably]

828
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,613
(Trey) Man, what's with all
the white spots on everything?

829
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,139
(Vince)
Hm?

830
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:11,018
(Trey) Anyway, Vin,
on the real, man,

831
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,078
I got to jet.

832
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,420
I'm going to holler at you,
all right?

833
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,426
(Vince)
You ain't got to do all that.

834
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,657
(Trey)
I love you, man.

835
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,291
You need a sock
or something.

836
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:23,334
Damn!

837
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,001
[brakes squeak]

838
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,566
(Sida)
Oh, great.

839
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:34,975
It's the pest.

840
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,138
(Trey) Look, I wouldn't
say I'm the best,

841
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,841
but I'm pretty close to it.

842
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:39,007
How you doing, Keily?

843
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,015
(Keily) Good. How are you?

844
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,016
(Trey)
I'm doing great.

845
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,575
Think I could talk to you
for a minute?

846
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,018
(Sida) No, actually,
Keily, we got to go.

847
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,385
(Keily)
I got a minute.

848
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,687
(Sida)
Oh, you do?

849
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,092
(Trey)
All right.

850
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,223
Um, so where's the man?

851
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,893
(Keily)
He's at football practice.

852
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,300
(Trey)
Kind of figured that.

853
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,361
None of your cell phones
are ringing.

854
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:02,963
(Keily)
Funny.

855
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,440
(Trey) So you mean to tell
me, out of three phones,

856
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,942
you couldn't
give me a call?

857
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,376
<i>(Keily) Trey, I have been with
Carlton for over six years.</i>

858
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,277
And I care for him deeply,
okay?

859
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,612
(Trey)
Aha.

860
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:13,980
(Keily)
What?

861
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,986
(Trey) You never
said you loved him.

862
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,954
(Keily)
I do love him.

863
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,480
(Trey)
Are you in love with him?

864
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,288
(Keily) Don't you
think you're asking

865
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,455
some awful personal
questions here?

866
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,555
I got to go.

867
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,896
(Trey)
Wait, Keily.

868
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,902
Look, just give me
one chance, all right?

869
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,164
Can we just
meet up once?

870
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,433
Have sodas
or something?

871
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:38,873
(Keily)
Seriously?

872
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:40,604
You know,
Carlton would have a fit

873
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,270
if I did something
like that.

874
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,677
(Trey)
He don't have to know.

875
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,920
I just can't.

876
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,149
(Trey)
Keily.

877
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,657
Just once, all right?

878
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,193
<i>I promise</i>
<i>I won't bug you anymore.</i>

879
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:03,133
What exactly
do you want from me?

880
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,503
(Trey)
Well, I don't know.

881
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,200
Just think about it,
all right?

882
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,238
I'll think about it.

883
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,280
I got to go.

884
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,814
(Sida)
Are you crazy?

885
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,112
You know Carlton has spies
all over this place.

886
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,116
(Keily)
Sida, stop trippin'.

887
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,584
(Sida) What do you
see in him anyway?

888
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:23,642
He delivers ribs.

889
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,155
Oh, now,
there's a bright future.

890
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,692
(No Doubt) Hot water,
corn bread, I said.

891
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,522
Got popped by the feds.

892
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,994
Now I'm seeing red.

893
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,030
I peed in my bed.

894
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,792
I must be dead.

895
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,663
Flip-a-tick,
talk the talk

896
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,224
like a clock
with a hole in my sock.

897
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,135
(K-3)
We 'bout to get so paid.

898
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:45,266
<i>(No Doubt)</i>
<i>I hit you with the word, y'all.</i>

899
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,504
<i>Like a ninja turtle.</i>

900
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,342
<i>I talk with the po-po,</i>

901
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,247
<i>but I flow</i>
<i>on the low-low.</i>

902
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,946
(Trey) Now, when you
gonna be honest with them?

903
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,420
(Mack)
Trey, I build dreams.

904
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,979
I don't tear them down.

905
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:03,322
(Trey) Look, now, we got
three weeks left to get 75K.

906
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,055
(Mack) I know that. I know that.

907
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,096
<i>(No Doubt)</i>
<i>All right, from the top, baby.</i>

908
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,691
<i>I'm coming in.</i>

909
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:14,101
(K-3) Let's do this
bonfires right now.

910
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,537
(No Doubt)
Yo, dog.

911
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,769
Yeah.

912
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,540
[Mack chuckles]

913
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,878
(Trey)
Here, have this.

914
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,941
(Mack)
What's this?

915
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,851
Hey.

916
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,024
<i>Hey, I can't take this.</i>

917
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,457
Man, this is your savings.

918
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,621
(Trey) You need
that more than I do.

919
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,686
Plus, I owe you.

920
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,198
You my nephew, man.

921
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,234
You don't owe me nothing.

922
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,827
(Trey)
Look, Unc,

923
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,634
you didn't have to take me
when my dad died, all right?

924
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,436
But you did.

925
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:54,034
And I'm grateful
to have you in my life.

926
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,840
Plus, I know how important it was
for you and my dad

927
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,473
to keep this studio
up and running.

928
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,780
This studio's more than just
a place to make music.

929
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:04,946
It's a diversion
for the youth in the community.

930
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:08,458
Look, I see the big picture,
all right?

931
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,458
So take that.

932
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,893
I know it's not much.

933
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:14,158
I'm going to come up
with something.

934
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:15,999
Trey.

935
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,934
<i>(Trey)</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>

936
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,065
(Mack)
I love you, man.

937
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,742
(Trey)
I love you too, Unc.

938
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,381
Gosh, it's really slow today.

939
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,820
(Cinque)
Yeah.

940
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,186
But anyway,
like I was saying, right?

941
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,323
<i>The white woman puts the change</i>
<i>on the counter</i>

942
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,920
instead of in my hand.

943
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,363
Know what I'm saying?

944
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,457
So I say to her politely-

945
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,466
I wasn't rude.

946
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,093
I said to her politely,

947
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,195
I said, "That's not how
I gave you my money.

948
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,740
I placed my money
in your hand."

949
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,468
(Mrs. Vickers)
Oh, what a bitch.

950
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,100
<i>(Cinque)</i>
<i>That's herway...</i>

951
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:04,341
of making me feel
like I'm not human.

952
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:05,746
You got
to understand something.

953
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,650
White people don't see us
as equal,

954
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,178
which, in turn, makes us feel
unwanted in this society.

955
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,316
(Mr. Vickers)
No, you are wanted.

956
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,951
And you are accepted.

957
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,859
<i>And why do white people</i>

958
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,329
treat people with such disdain?

959
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,826
(Trey)
What's up, everybody?

960
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:25,869
<i>(Vince)</i>
<i>Hey, what's up, boy?</i>

961
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,868
(Trey)
What's-

962
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,529
Nah. Cool.
What's up?

963
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,573
Why you crying, Mr. Vickers?

964
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,039
(Carlton) I told you to
stay away from my girl.

965
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:35,578
(Vince)
Hey, man.

966
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,840
(Cinque)
Stop it before I break it.

967
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,176
(Carlton)
All right, all right, all right.

968
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,343
(Cinque) This is the second time I
had to remove you from the premises.

969
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,351
<i>Get out.</i>

970
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,352
<i>(Carlton)</i>
<i>I'm leaving.</i>

971
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,321
You been warned, Trey.

972
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:49,849
Stay your ass
away from Keily.

973
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:51,155
(Vince) Hey, man, I
don't know your girl,

974
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,388
but I'm going
to sit down with Trey,

975
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,260
and we gonna
come up with something

976
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,765
where we can work it out.

977
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,234
(Carlton)
Shut your ass up!

978
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,771
(Vince) What the hell
is wrong with him?

979
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,965
You hitting her?

980
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,007
[mouthing words]

981
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,838
(Katherine)
Oh, thank you so much.

982
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,537
I mean, look,
I'm not in love.

983
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,738
It's just...

984
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,375
this young man
is just so passionate.

985
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,376
<i>(Dedra)</i>
<i>To get passion,</i>

986
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,977
much is required.

987
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,544
I call it the three C's.

988
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,852
<i>Comfortability,</i>

989
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:22,222

992
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,797

<i>(Katherine)</i>
<i>Look, you guys,</i>

994
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,995
it's not even that serious.

995
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:39,475
I mean, it just feels so good
to feel wanted again.

996
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,101
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

997
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:45,239
Being wanted
and feeling wanted just,

998
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,113
it makes you
want to be wanted

999
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,049
<i>while wanting</i>
<i>to want something.</i>

1000
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,283

(Katherine)
No.

1002
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,058
(Dedra) Actually, girl,
I like them young too.

1003
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,119
That way, you can mold them

1004
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:02,665
into whatever you want them
to be, like Play-Doh.

1005
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:08,768
I just hope that my sorers
can keep my business to themselves.

1006
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,937
Why are y'all
looking at me?

1007
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:14,772
I do not have
a big mouth.

1008
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,838
I didn't tell about you
getting caught stealing.

1009
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,847
I didn't tell her
about that.

<i>(Dedra) Okay, why you got to</i>
<i>bring that up in front of her?</i>

Man, what you guys want, man?

00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:42,972
(K-3) Yo, I got some
fire for you, man.

1022
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,905

even remotely close to that.

1026

00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,980
Y'all, hold on right quick.

Yo, it's 97.3,
hip-hop and R&B.

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,959
Yo, and if you think
I'm going to let them in,

00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,261
What I'm gonna do is,

00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,632
I'm going to put this microphone
up to the intercom,

1037
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,297
and we gonna see what fire
these dudes have been talking about.

1038

that little boom box out there.

1043
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,478
Matter of fact, go ahead
and play a sample of that fire.

1044

to check with you first

before I speak to someone?

have to hear it in the streets first?

That's probably, what,

What are you all doing?

1140
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:02,120
(Dedra) Well, I have
your uncle's SIM card

1141
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,689
from his cell phone.

1142
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,962
(Sida) You took your husband's
SIM card out his cell phone?

1143
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,731
You know that's fowl, right?

1144
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:10,365
(Dedra) Well, technically,
it's my SIM card,

1145
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:13,069
'cause I bought it
and put it in his phone.

1146
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,441

what a SIM card is.

(Sida) Okay, and how
did you pull that off?

1148
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:20,177
(Dedra) Well, I went
to see him play in DC.

1149
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,219
And then after I put it on him,
he fell asleep,

1150
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,017
and I switched
the SIM cards.

1151

So let's see what's new
in Jason's life.

Oh, now, this one right here
looks nothing like me.

Nice boob job, though.

1154
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:44,701
She has a natural
little teardrop shape to it.

1155
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:49,678
It looks good.

1156
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,544
Ugh.

Look at her.

1158
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,579
She needs a wax.

1159
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,588
(Sida) She needs a hatchet
or a weed whacker, something.

1160
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,214
Ew, that's nasty.

1161

(Dedra) Oh, I think
I know this one.

1165
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,096
I believe he told me
it was his cousin from L.A.

1166
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:21,042
Well, let's just see who that is
near her mouth, shall we?

1167
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,945
Let's zoom in.

1168
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,505
Bingo.

1169
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,483
I'd recognize
those genitals anywhere.

You see that mole
shaped like a cockroach?

1171
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:31,686

Unfortunately.

And you see
that angle?

1175
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,221
He must've
taken that one himself.

1176
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,627
(Sida) Yeah, yeah, that's
definitely a POV shot.

1177
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:41,629
(Dedra)
Mm-hmm.

1178
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,687
(Sida)
Definitely.

1179
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,832
(Keily) Okay, Aunty, look,
I think you've had enough.

a little upset here,

just close it?

Oh, okay, now,
this one is upsetting.

1189

(Sida)
Why?

1190
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,719
(Dedra)
'Cause that's a girl-rilla.

1191
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:13,763
Oh, I can't believe
I slept after that.

1192
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,731
Oh, my God,
call the clinic.
