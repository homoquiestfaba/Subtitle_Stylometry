00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,926
Hydra Two to Hydra One.
Approaching on your flank.

2
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,626
Roger, Hydra Two.
First rendezvous complete.

3
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,431
Hell of a way to earn our keep,
isn't it, Vaughn?

4
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,301
Babysitting a corpse.

5
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:01,373
Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker, last
of the great global boogeymen.

6
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,247
"Ours not to reason why,
ours but to do and die."

7
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,596
Hydra Two, this is Vaughn at Trinity
Base. Defense grid disengaged.

8
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:30,165
Commence attack.

9
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,474
Hydra Three, rendezvous completed.
On my lead.

10
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,648
Move it! Move it! Come on!

11
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,399
Let us rock and let us roll!

12
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,744
Nick, take care of her.

13
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:30,252
Isn't that sweet? His last words,
"Nick."

14
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:56,336
Colonel Fury. Sir. S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent
Alexander Goodwin Pierce.

15
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,973
I'm pleased to inform you

16
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,487
that your intelligence protocol
has been reactivated.

17
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,181
They've asked you resume your post

18
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,521
as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s public director,
effective immediately.

19
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,603
Well, unfortunately, Pierce, you're
gonna have to tell S.H.I.E.L.D.

20
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,544
To shove it up their collective
end zones.

21
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,549
They put me out to pasture five
years ago.

22
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,083
Or didn't they brief you on that
particular piece of intel?

23
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,749
Sir, sir, these orders come
from the President himself.

24
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,156
The President?
Yes, sir.

25
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,800
The answer's the same.

26
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:01,865
Now, why don't you take your blow-dryer
and get the hell out of my afternoon sun.

27
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,202
Always a pleasure to see the old
warhorse chewing out the troops.

28
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,545
So, they sent you, too.

29
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:18,216
Contessa. Contessa Valentina
de Allegro Fontaine.

30
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:22,993
Quite a mouthful when you try
and wrap your tongue around it.

31
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,895
Don't let the blue blood fool
you, Pierce.

32
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,901
Val's an old hand at the sexpionage
game, aren't you?

33
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,863
It's been a long time, Nick.

34
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,767
You don't look any worse for wear.

35
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:43,344
We need you back.

36
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,650
Maybe I've gotten used to the wilderness.
And maybe you're full of it.

37
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,916
Hydra's back in the game, Nick.
Oh, that's impossible!

38
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,121
Von Strucker's dead, I killed him myself.
Yesterday, Hydra stormed Trinity Base.

39
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,325
They stole Von Strucker's body and
they killed Clay in the process.

40
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,399
Damn.
I'm sorry about Clay, Nick,

41
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:11,932
but it looks like Hydra's trying
to send you a message.

42
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,179
Looks like I heard it.

43
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,729
I imagine this stirs up some pretty
unpleasant memories for you, sir.

44
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,166
All I have to do is look in
the mirror, Pierce.

45
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,034
I lost an eye to that madman.

46
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,802
You rot in hell, you bastard.

47
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,968
If I may say so, Colonel,

48
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,740
working alongside a legend
such as yourself,

49
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,747
really promises to be quite
a thrill.

50
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:54,548
How long have you been with the outfit?
Actually this is my first field assignment.

51
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,418
Terrific! Nice to know they sent the best.

52
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,688
Well, I did graduate top of my class
at the S.H.I.E.L.D. Kirby Academy.

53
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,456
I'm an accredited instructor

54
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,623
of advanced rappelling and
single-line physical ascent.

55
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,793
I also have an alpha-class rating
in explosives use and disposal.

56
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,837
How's your needlepoint?
I beg your pardon, sir?

57
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:12,928
S.H.I.E.L.D. Base to Hunting Party.

58
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,996
How's your needlepoint?

59
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,668
I show you on approach at
one-eight-three. Acknowledge.

60
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:21,110
Oh, relax, kid. I'm just blowing
smoke up your hoo-ha.

61
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,978
This is Hunting Party approaching
restricted fly zone

62
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,952
with quarry on board. Please advise.
S.H.I.E.L.D. Base to Hunting Party.

63
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,352
We are disengaging radar shield.

64
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:05,156
Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D.

65
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,854
The Supreme Headquarters International
Espionage Law Enforcement Division.

66
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,472
Colonel, there's no smoking
on board the heli-carrier.

67
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,373
New world health regulations.
What?

68
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:30,007
Speak up, Pierce, my ears just popped.
It must be the altitude.

69
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,481
All right.

70
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,016
Infrared retina scanners engaged
for elevator number three.

71
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,652
Why aren't we moving?

72
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,596
New security system, sir.
State of the art.

73
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,657
One hundred percent impregnable.

74
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,364
Great. Why aren't we moving?

75
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,840
Unregistered passenger.
Searching personnel databank.

76
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:00,471
Computer index matched
to Fury, Nicholas Joseph.

77
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,613
Security clearance alpha.

78
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,117
Please stand by for repeat retina
matrix recognition.

79
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,410
System error.

80
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,613
Please expose both eyes to full
room scan.

81
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,122
Update your files, moron,
I only got one.

82
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,853
Unregistered individual. Going...

83
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:17,293
System disengage.
...security breach.

84
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,526
Fire detection alert.
Proceed to the nearest fire exit.

85
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,430
Do not, repeat...
Override. Override!

86
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,435
...do not use this elevator.

87
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,803
Master code 0094.
Pierce...

88
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:32,275
Do not, repeat, do not use
this elevator.

89
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,811
Fire detection alert.

90
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,144
Must have been stuck.

91
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:43,280
Proceed to the near...

92
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:54,132
Well, well, well, look what
the cat dragged in.

93
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,261
Timothy Aloysius Dugan.
Ain't you dead yet, you swine?

94
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,137
Nick Fury. So good to see you, man.
Swine.

95
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,509
I wish it were under better
circumstances.

96
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,147
I see you met Pierce.
Yeah, thanks.

97
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:14,646
Kate. Meet our newest recruit,
Kate Neville.

98
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,749
You're thinking of Clay Quartermain.

99
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,553
You're wishing you had a chance
to say goodbye.

100
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,790
Kate's in charge of our new
Parapsych Division.

101
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,528
What are you, a mind reader?
We prefer the term ESPers.

102
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,799
I had my natural ability
augmented with implants.

103
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,369
Neural implants.
Come on.

104
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,710
You know what I'm thinking now, darling?
I don't need ESP for that.

105
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:48,214
Been a few changes since you last
called the shots around here.

106
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,313
Oh, hell. What rock did he crawl
out from under?

107
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,381
Well, I was just getting to that.

108
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,360
You're looking at the new Director
General of S.H.I.E.L.D.

109
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,794
Talk about falling upwards, huh?

110
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:02,867
So, we meet again, Fury.
Well, I'm not surprised, Pincer.

111
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:07,497
Guys like you tend to cling to the bowl
no matter how many times you flush.

112
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,573
Well, I see you haven't
changed.

113
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,671
But let's get one thing
straight here.

114
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,874
S.H.I.E.L.D. Was created to function
as a permanent multinational strike force,

115
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,315
not as your own personal army.
You understand?

116
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,411
Look, Nick, come on. Excuse us.

117
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,485
Better watch your step, Fury.

118
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,752
I had you pink-slipped before,
and I can do it again.

119
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,125
The world's changed since you ran
off to the wilds.

120
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:35,656
Your particular brand of vigilantism
isn't going to cut it anymore.

121
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,759
With all due respect, Director,
if the world had changed

122
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,964
you wouldn't need people like me,
now, would you?

123
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,381
And put out that cigar!

124
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,347
Team Romeo to forward
three-niner-seven.

125
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,255
Team Romeo report to
three-niner-seven.

126
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,478
The prodigal son returns.
Gabe.

127
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:30,044
How's my favorite mad scientist?
Enduring, Nicholas, enduring.

128
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,556
So, where's my new toy?

129
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,854
This thing calibrated?
Yes, it is, sir.

130
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:39,694
Look at this, Nick. Something
to keep your Weatherby company.

131
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,790
It's a 200-ampere electric gun.

132
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,427
The hand grip is keyed to your
thermal signature alone.

133
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,995
So, anybody tries to fire it,
boom, they'll get it in the neck.

134
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,200
Don't leave home without it.

135
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,842
Come this way, Nicholas. I have
something else I want to show you.

136
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,856
You need to sign these, Colonel.
What are they?

137
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,831
Receipts for the new ordnance.
W4 forms.

138
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,336
No, thanks.
And a tax withholding statement.

139
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,534
You see, the Human Resources
Department insists that you sign them.

140
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,202
Please.
Things have changed, Nick.

141
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,041
Bean counters have taken over
the world.

142
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,086
What is that?

143
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:41,319
That's our prototype LMD,
Life Model Decoy.

144
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,655
Reducible in size for easy
transport.

145
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,445
Not a bad looking guy, huh?
Not a bad looking guy, huh?

146
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,349
The cerebral matrix has been
programmed

147
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,321
with your memory engrams
and reflex tapes.

148
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:15,258
In other words, it not only talks
like you, it moves like you.

149
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,394
I don't know whether to congratulate you
or drive a stake through its heart.

150
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,798
I don't know whether to congratulate
you or drive a stake...

151
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,062
Turn it off, Gabe.
Commander Dugan.

152
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,663
Ready for you on the bridge, sir.
We're on our way.

153
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,001
Get yourself suited up.

154
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,853
Clay Quartermain was wearing
contact lenses

155
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,383
fitted with high-res micro cameras
during the assault.

156
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,731
The scrolls at the bottom of
the screen are Clay's vital signs.

157
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,595
Are you sure you're up to this,
Nick?

158
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,541
Nick, take care of her.

159
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,979
Isn't that sweet? His last words,
"Nick."

160
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,654
I assume he meant his boyhood
chum, Nick Fury.

161
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:22,523
And I further assume that you're
watching this now, Colonel.

162
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:28,692
Well, rest assured, your friend's death
is only the beginning. Revenge is mine.

163
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,766
Who the hell is that?
Andrea Von Strucker.

164
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,072
You're telling me that monster
had a daughter?

165
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,705
And a son. A brother, Werner.

166
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,475
They've taken up where their father
left off, reuniting Hydra splinter groups,

167
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:50,954
making overtures to almost every
terrorist organization in the world.

168
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,583
Trying to bring them all under
one umbrella.

169
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,891
Excuse me, sir. What I don't
quite understand is,

170
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,726
you know, apart from filial
devotion,

171
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,029
why go to so much trouble to recover
their father's corpse?

172
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,126
The Death's Head virus.

173
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,162
The what, sir?

174
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,837
The retrovirus was initially developed
by the Nazi biochemist, Arnim Zola.

175
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,375
Der Totenkopf, literally
the Death's Head,

176
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,413
because of the facial contortions
suffered by its victims.

177
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,856
It was going to be Hitler's
doomsday weapon.

178
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,225
Fortunately, the Allies stopped Hydra
before they could unleash it.

179
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,958
Ten years ago, Von Strucker
tried to raise the Fourth Reich

180
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,091
courtesy of der Totenkopf.

181
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,160
Clay and Nick trapped him in
his lab,

182
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,671
and the mad Baron fell victim
to his own weapon.

183
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,197
The Allies agreed that the virus
should be totally destroyed,

184
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,039
eradicated from the face of
the earth.

185
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:49,376
They couldn't make a vaccine?
Not for the Death's Head.

186
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,780
Trust me, son.
This is one very nasty germ.

187
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,014
Compared to it, the Ebola virus
is like a mild case of the sniffles.

188
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,955
What's the problem, if it's been
eradicated?

189
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:04,121
Remnants of the virus bonded with
Strucker's DNA. It's in his cells.

190
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,357
Theoretically it could still
be liberated.

191
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,025
Gabe, who would it take for Hydra
to reproduce the virus?

192
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,593
It would take Dr. Arnim Zola.

193
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,571
He's still alive.
Yeah.

194
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,734
He did 30 years in Spandau Prison,
and when he got out he disappeared.

195
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,970
Until six weeks ago.

196
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,071
Interpol got a whisper on his
location, passed it along to us.

197
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:27,380
So, it's safe to say every Hydra agent in
the phone book is out looking for him.

198
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,421
We have him in a S.H.I.E.L.D.
Safe house in Berlin.

199
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,959
Well, what the hell are we
standing here for? Let's go.

200
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,108
Sleep, Father. Dream.

201
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,549
Your children will not fail you.

202
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:13,890
It's time, Andrea.
The lieutenants are waiting for us.

203
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,226
Come.

204
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,577
Greetings.

205
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,815
Fräulein Von Strucker, are you
aware of the time difference?

206
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,219
I was asleep. There had better be
good reason for this.

207
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:45,423
In a few moments you can decide for
yourself if the reason is good enough.

208
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:53,299
Look at you, my father's trusted
lieutenants.

209
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,064
I am disgusted.

210
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:58,803
How dare you...
Silence!

211
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:06,344
I see the remnants of what was once
the world's greatest terrorist organization,

212
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,819
squabbling like animals for
table scraps.

213
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:15,014
For too long, Hydra has been
splintered and weak,

214
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,824
divided by our enemies and reduced
to warring factions.

215
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:22,196
Tonight, that changes.

216
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:30,201
Very soon, Hydra will be in possession of
the most dangerous weapon ever created.

217
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:37,071
The dream of a new order my father
envisioned is within our grasp.

218
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,576
What is this?

219
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:47,113
Someone who dared to question
my authority.

220
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:55,031
I am sure you all remember
your fellow lieutenant from London.

221
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,801
Powerful, presumably invincible.

222
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,788
If there are any other concerns

223
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:24,852
regarding the direction of
my leadership

224
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,258
by all means, do voice them now.

225
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:39,436
Then let this moment be a call to arms
for each and every one of you.

226
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:43,314
We are the soldiers of anarchy.

227
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,785
And it is time that the world
fear us once again.

228
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,299
Do you think they got the message?
I think so, yeah.

229
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,059
They are happy when they have
a strong leader.

230
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:09,338
Have you chosen the target yet
for our first strike?

231
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:13,309
Yes. It's a small island
off the coast of New York.

232
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,742
What island?
Manhattan.

233
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:23,717
Tell me, Werner. Do you think the deaths
of eight million Americans

234
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,723
will be enough to get the world's
attention?

235
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,917
Where is she?
She'll be here.

236
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,652
Five more minutes.

237
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,385
Why do we need her, anyway?
Nick, Interpol helped us find Zola,

238
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:09,661
they would like to be there when Kate
reads his mind, so just relax.

239
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,770
You know I never liked this city.
Why?

240
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,478
We had some good times here.
We?

241
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,642
You mean you had some good
times here.

242
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:27,251
You and Clay.

243
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:31,047
You two were impossible
to work with.

244
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:36,156
I felt like a complete outsider
until...

245
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:02,444
"I died for beauty but was scarce
adjusted in the tomb"

246
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,790
"When one who died for truth was
lain to rest in the adjoining room"

247
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:15,055
Colonel Fury. Contessa.

248
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,634
Inspector Gail Runciter,
Berlin Interpol.

249
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,135
Is something wrong?

250
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,399
"Beauty is truth and truth
is beauty

251
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:29,174
"That's all ye on this earth know
and all ye need to know"

252
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:33,684
Is that part of the recognition code?
No, I just felt like saying it.

253
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,710
Who's your friend, here?
A Hydra agent,

254
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,187
and not one of your admirers.

255
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,781
Perhaps we should move before one of his
colleagues comes looking for him.

256
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,827
Let's go.
Is your safe house nearby?

257
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:47,524
Yeah, follow us. Let's take
the subway. Let's go.

258
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,905
There they are!

259
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,246
Go! Go!

260
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,021
Seatbelts fastened.

261
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,463
Tray tables in an upright position.
Here we go!

262
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:30,704
Scare you?
That was interesting.

263
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,771
I've never done that before.

264
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:35,335
Yeah, but just make sure
you pick the right wall.

265
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,643
Let's go find the doctor.

266
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:52,025
Dr. Zola.

267
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,796
So, we meet again.

268
00:28:56,868 --> 00:29:00,531
You are holding me illegally.

269
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,835
What do you know about the Death's
Head virus?

270
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,842
Death's Head is the perfect
weapon, you know.

271
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,606
When was Hydra last in contact
with you?

272
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,342
How long would it take to reproduce the
RNA sequence from Von Strucker's body?

273
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:20,255
Reproduction of the virus
would take me mere hours.

274
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,987
When was Hydra last in contact
with you?

275
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,723
That would be telling.
Wouldn't it, Colonel?

276
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,129
Are you ready to scan him, Kate?

277
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,846
Warm hands, Fräulein.

278
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,983
Very nice.

279
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:28,158
What did you do to her?

280
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,023
Kate, are you all right?
Get him out of here, now!

281
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,254
Don't worry, we'll get him
out of here.

282
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,288
What happened, Kate?
I have never seen anything so evil.

283
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,163
Were you able to pick up anything?

284
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:41,035
No, not really. Someone's already
been inside his head.

285
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:46,533
They set a posthypnotic trap for me.
Hydra's made contact. Damn it!

286
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:51,344
Can he do what he claims?
Yes. Yes, he can.

287
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,543
All right, we need to get him
out of here ASAP.

288
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:56,212
Hydra's going to make a run
for Zola.

289
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,052
I want double-A security on this one.
Yes, ma'am. Commander.

290
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,989
All right, Val. Take it.
Okay.

291
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,459
Colonel.
Bring the van around?

292
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,688
Yes, ma'am, we're ready to move.

293
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,320
Make sure there's a medical team
standing by.

294
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,627
I wasn't sure before, now I am.

295
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,000
Not only is Hydra outside the safe
house but they're inside as well.

296
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,373
Can we meet somewhere
we won't be disturbed?

297
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,906
This is urgent, Colonel,
it won't wait.

298
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,607
Get Dugan on the line.
Yes, sir.

299
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,118
Right away, sir.
I'm going upstairs. I'll be right back.

300
00:31:40,431 --> 00:31:42,331
I'm over here, Colonel.

301
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:50,938
Inspector?

302
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,813
What's this all about?

303
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:03,685
This is about getting the two
of us alone in a room together.

304
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,247
Is it true what women say
about you?

305
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,363
Well, that depends on if you're talking
of one of my ex-wives or my mother.

306
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:18,329
What's the matter, Colonel?
Don't you find me attractive?

307
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,631
Look, there's a lot going on
right now.

308
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,504
Why don't we just take a rain check
on the heavy breathing, here?

309
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:28,011
You said the safe house is
compromised. Who's the spy?

310
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,341
Me.

311
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,816
Twenty thousand volts, Fury.

312
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,684
Do I have your attention?

313
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,272
So much for the late great
Colonel Nick Fury.

314
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,644
What have you done to me?
You've been kissed

315
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,683
with the kiss of death.

316
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,728
You...

317
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:23,756
Pleasant dreams, Fury.

318
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:28,670
I told you revenge was mine.
And now, Zola will be, too.

319
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,514
Commander, he's coming out of it.

320
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,650
Nick, you okay?

321
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,289
Nick, you had this in your hand
when we found you.

322
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,124
What does it say?
"It's all downhill after the first kiss.

323
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,720
"Love, Viper."

324
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,965
Nick, what happened?
I got bit by a snake.

325
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,469
She took you out so Hydra could
storm the safe house.

326
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,971
They got Zola, Nick.
We led them right to him.

327
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,168
The attack at the art gallery
was just stage dressing.

328
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:08,076
If this woman is in fact
the real Viper,

329
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,377
then what happened to the real
Inspector Runciter?

330
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,845
Hydra's been jerking our chain
six ways to Sunday.

331
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,796
Subject, Fury, Nicholas.

332
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,697
The patient has not responded
to nutritive and detox treatment...

333
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,564
I feel fine, Gabe.

334
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,296
Feel like a damn bratwurst.

335
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,861
You could get me out of here
and get me some mustard.

336
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,839
Comprehensive scanning indicates

337
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:41,345
Fury has been poisoned
with a synthesized alkaloid.

338
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:46,577
Prognosis, neuritis, anaphylactic
shock, respiratory failure

339
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,810
and imminent...

340
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,079
Say it, Gabe.

341
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,451
Go on, say it.

342
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,321
Imminent death.

343
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:08,470
To conclude, the poison
has been synthesized

344
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:13,875
to simulate the skin secretion
of the Dendrobate genera.

345
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,379
What's that?
Colombian tree frog.

346
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:22,577
The most deadly toxin in all
of nature. There is no serum.

347
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:27,654
I'm sorry, Nick.
Brilliant.

348
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,620
How long do I have before Kermit
bites me the big one?

349
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,063
About 48 hours from the initial
point of exposure.

350
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,727
Which means we've already wasted...
Seven hours.

351
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,236
Gabe, how long before the first
symptoms hit?

352
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,272
They've already started.

353
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,468
You're running a low-grade fever,
it'll climb.

354
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:48,478
You'll start to feel a gradual loss
of motor coordination.

355
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,605
Okay, okay, I get the picture.
Get me out of this thing.

356
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:52,672
Nick, this is serious.
Get me out of this thing!

357
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,981
You can't just brush this aside.
I'm not.

358
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,115
There's nothing you can do?

359
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,990
There's one possibility,
but it's such a long shot...

360
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:09,228
I built my reputation on long shots.
Are you sure this woman kissed you?

361
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,234
Yeah, she kissed me.

362
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:14,533
If the poison was passed from her lips,
then she has to be immune to it.

363
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,768
The toxin must have been engineered
from her specific genetic template.

364
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,707
What's that mean?

365
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,907
If we could get a sample of
her blood, we might, might,

366
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,712
be able to synthesize an antiserum.

367
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,144
Consider it done.
No way, Nicholas.

368
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:33,213
I'm confining you to
the infirmary.

369
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:35,452
Physical exertion will only
accelerate the effects of...

370
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:40,828
Gabe, I do not intend to spend the last
few hours of my life on this planet

371
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,059
in the heli-carrier sickbay.

372
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:49,297
I'll get that vampire's blood
if I have to suck it from her neck.

373
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,385
I'm sorry about what happened
between us, Nick.

374
00:37:11,295 --> 00:37:15,664
Don't you think it's a little early
to be handing out the olive branch?

375
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:30,004
Damn it, Nick. Don't you see
I'm trying to call a truce here?

376
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,348
Val...

377
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,318
Whatever we had between us
is ancient history.

378
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,021
I've put it behind me.
You should, too.

379
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,097
Why don't I believe you?

380
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,597
'Cause you know me.

381
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,699
Nick, what do you want me to say?
That it happened too fast between us?

382
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,834
That Clay got in the way?

383
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:03,772
I got scared, I walked.
Yeah, into someone else's bed.

384
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,808
Well, I learned that move from you.

385
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,551
All right, listen, as much as I'd like
to sit here and lick old wounds,

386
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,614
we got a job to do, okay?

387
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,790
I want all dedicated persons on the bridge
ASAP for a full intel breakdown.

388
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,331
You think you can handle that?

389
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,731
Oh, I'll manage, Colonel.
Good.

390
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,665
You know something, Nick?

391
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,301
I was such a fool to think the years
would have made a difference.

392
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,212
Pincer was right, you haven't
changed.

393
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,915
You're the same jerk I walked
out on five years ago.

394
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:16,150
Where's Fury?

395
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,387
Right behind me, sir.
You're serious?

396
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,324
He's been back on the job less than
48 hours and he's already lost Zola?

397
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,953
Well, that's the least of
his problems.

398
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,328
I don't recall asking for your
opinion, Lieutenant.

399
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:34,132
Fury. That true? You managed
to screw things up again?

400
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,239
Get away! Don't touch him!

401
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,932
I'm addressing S.H.I.E.L.D. Director,
Jack Pincer. Listen carefully.

402
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,902
Death's Head virus has been set
to explode somewhere in Manhattan.

403
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,278
You have until 6:00 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time tomorrow

404
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:19,544
to assemble one billion US dollars.

405
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,942
You'll be told where and when
to deliver it.

406
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:26,045
Any attempt to evacuate Manhattan

407
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,786
will result in the immediate
release of the virus.

408
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,662
Be in no doubt as to the seriousness
of your situation.

409
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:37,360
We will demonstrate the effectiveness
of our virus within hours.

410
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:43,032
Rest assured, against a force such
as ours, there is no protection.

411
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:47,541
Against Hydra, there is no shield.

412
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:52,207
Watch it! Watch it!
Back off! Back off!

413
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,252
Put that fire out!

414
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:06,523
I want a code three alert.

415
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,862
I want an emergency planning session
in the war room, 1400 hours!

416
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,869
And I want to know how that thing
got in here.

417
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,700
By the way, Fury...

418
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,473
How did you know which one of
me to shoot?

419
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:19,873
I didn't.

420
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,313
High alert!
All across here, tape it off!

421
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,886
Hydra's really done it this time,
Nick. This is big.

422
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,685
I should've known not to get back
involved with you again, Timothy.

423
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:37,022
Pincer's scheduled a teleconference
with the President.

424
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:39,858
Good. We can use all the big guns
we can get.

425
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,558
I think we now know what Viper meant
by a demonstration.

426
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,330
The real Inspector Runciter, she's
been dropped off at a Berlin hospital.

427
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:49,531
She's been infected with
the Death's Head virus.

428
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,277
They're bringing her on board now.

429
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,678
Let's go!
Coming through here!

430
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:03,677
Clear the corridor. Coming through.
Security, can you give us a pass, please?

431
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,779
Coming through here.

432
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,518
Keep back, crew! Over to
the side, please.

433
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,884
Coming through.

434
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,708
Let's go. Clear the corridor!
Stay back.

435
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,491
If Nick holds up...

436
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,260
Colonel, we got the President
on screen one.

437
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,826
Heads up, people. Showtime.

438
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,809
Good to have you back, Colonel.
Good to be here, sir.

439
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:03,676
Is this a viable threat?
Yes, sir.

440
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,274
We wouldn't be in this situation
if we hadn't dropped the ball in Berlin.

441
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:10,184
Mr. President, Gabe Jones,
Deputy Director.

442
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,781
I'd like to clarify something, sir,
before we proceed any further.

443
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:18,385
It is crucial that the public
does not get any word of this.

444
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:22,295
You'll have to avoid any media leaks.
Understood.

445
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:25,096
Now, having said that, what do you
people intend to do about this?

446
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,536
Sir, we're concentrating all of our efforts
on finding Viper's base of operations.

447
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,733
Good, let's find it and
then bomb it.

448
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,300
The only thing these terrorists
respond to is force.

449
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,973
Bad idea. They'd see us coming.

450
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:42,415
Then what do you suggest?
I suggest we split our focus.

451
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,114
The main group tries to locate
the warheads.

452
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:48,488
How do you propose to do that?
Well, sir, they won't be coming by air.

453
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,687
All we'd have to do is throw
a no-fly zone over the city.

454
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,629
Logic suggests they'll be using
a ground-based delivery system.

455
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:56,996
Let's say a bus or a semi.

456
00:43:57,067 --> 00:44:00,468
This vehicle would have to be retrofitted
with extensive electronics.

457
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:04,473
Apparently, the virus also requires
a very precise storage environment.

458
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:08,170
Between minus 10 and 15 degrees
Celsius, in its inert state.

459
00:44:08,245 --> 00:44:11,874
Which means we're looking for
a rig with a refrigeration system.

460
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,680
And what if your people aren't able to
track down these missiles? What, then?

461
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:20,190
If we can locate Viper's base of
operations and try an insertion strike,

462
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:22,521
Viper will cover all the contingencies.

463
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,153
She should have the disarmament
code on her.

464
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,527
God help us if you're wrong,
Colonel.

465
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,829
Please keep me informed.
Our prayers are with you.

466
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:39,341
From this moment on, I want to know
about every idea that you guys entertain,

467
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:42,106
from the moment it pops into
your head!

468
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,471
Am I understood?
Yes, sir.

469
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,125
Sir.
Yeah.

470
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,161
I had the lab run that tape
through Voice Stress Analyzer.

471
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,291
Viper's psych profile suggests

472
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,461
that she'll release the virus
even if her demands are met.

473
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,970
I'm aware of that.

474
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:12,031
I'll be damned if I give the President
something else to chew on.

475
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,679
You all right, Colonel?

476
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,583
Between you and me and that ESP
chip in your head,

477
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,088
I'm beginning to feel the effects
of Viper's cocktail.

478
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:33,295
She still cares about you, sir.

479
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,422
You don't have to be an ESP
agent to see that.

480
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:39,765
Yeah, well, I got eight million other
lives to worry about right now.

481
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,738
Running a little low on
Hallmark moments.

482
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:46,535
And I know a lie when
I hear it, too.

483
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,944
What you got caged up there?
The robot that self-destructed.

484
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:53,847
See, I scraped up what was left and
this is the remains of the motherboard.

485
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,579
You see the charming thing
about the electronics industry

486
00:45:56,653 --> 00:46:00,054
is the remarkably tidy records
that they keep.

487
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:05,084
Now, this motherboard was inside
a laptop which was sold in Unimak.

488
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,356
Unimak? Where's that?

489
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,364
It's one of the Aleutian Islands.
Right here.

490
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,899
Now, another thing jumped out.

491
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,232
Now the Viper gave the deadline
as 6:00 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time.

492
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,032
And why? Why did she do that?

493
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,404
I mean, she could just as easily
have said noon New York Time.

494
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:23,378
That points to the fact that her
headquarters are not on the East Coast.

495
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,644
It's not much to go on.
But it's all we got.

496
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,185
All right, listen up, two teams.
Val, you got the important job.

497
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,845
The Manhattan sweep.
You find the virus bomb.

498
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:31,979
Got it, Nick.
Good.

499
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,488
Timothy, you run the show from here.
Got it.

500
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,047
Great. Pierce, you, Kate, with me.

501
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,889
I want a transporter here in 10 minutes
ready to rock and roll, extra fuel pods

502
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,292
and pack the LMD. Get it?

503
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,853
Got it.
Good!

504
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:45,130
Nicholas, the Aleutians cover
a huge area.

505
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,931
Let's narrow it down before you go.

506
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,564
There's no time for that, Gabe.
Now, listen to me.

507
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,734
Sooner or later, Viper's gonna have to
communicate with somebody in New York.

508
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,869
Probably her idiot brother,
right?

509
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,937
Scale all the wave bands for her voice.
Once you get a mesh, triangulate.

510
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,074
With any luck I'll be within
minutes of her royal nastiness.

511
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,311
I'm gonna have to veto that.

512
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,146
You're in no condition
to lead a field operation.

513
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:09,522
I'm the best man for the job,
and you know it, Pincer.

514
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:12,585
You try it, and I'll have you
thrown in the brig.

515
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,154
I won't have you jeopardizing this
mission for some personal vendetta.

516
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:19,168
Nicholas. I don't know how
to say this, but maybe he is right.

517
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:22,735
Yours is not the only life
at stake here.

518
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,172
Are you really up to leading
a field operation?

519
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:31,408
Of course not, Gabe. But who the hell
else is going to do it? The LMD?

520
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:54,392
Wild Wing 4, show me 30 miles
out on the scope.

521
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:58,206
Stealth distorters engaged, sir.

522
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:02,541
We should be completely masked now.
Copy, anything from our birds?

523
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:06,709
They're doing long range
30-and-excess sweeps, but nothing yet.

524
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:10,048
All right, let's take this bird
a little lower, just in case.

525
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:19,996
Damn it, Fury, what do you think
you're doing?

526
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,690
You're endangering the mission.

527
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,528
Now, you turn that ship around
right now, or you'll be...

528
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,162
You're talking to a dead man, Pincer.
I got nothing to lose.

529
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,570
Maybe not. But your team members do.

530
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,041
Now, I am addressing agents
Pierce and Neville.

531
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:37,513
I am ordering you to return to base.
I'll have you both up on charges.

532
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,882
How about it people? Any takers?

533
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:45,511
I'm terribly sorry, Colonel, but...

534
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:50,525
I seem to be having a spot of bother
with my headphones. What was that?

535
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,287
I'm sorry sir, you're breaking up.

536
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,800
No takers, Pincer.
Catch you on the rebound.

537
00:48:57,868 --> 00:49:01,065
Don't you dare cut me off,
you comic book coward.

538
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:05,336
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
people.

539
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:09,641
Expect a little something extra
in your Christmas stockings this year.

540
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,909
If we live till Christmas, that is.

541
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:20,518
Tim, we need another lead down
here.

542
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,184
I might have something here,
hang on.

543
00:49:23,694 --> 00:49:25,321
Give us the coordinates, Tim.

544
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,728
All right hang on, Val,
we're still homing in on it.

545
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,195
Okay, got it.

546
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:39,403
8.4B, 6D, it's in the alley.

547
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:04,323
Alpha Team, this is Chief Surgeon.

548
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,801
The truck appears to have two
operatives in the rear.

549
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:10,702
Move in. Carefully.

550
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,819
Wait, wait.

551
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,838
Go.

552
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,008
What is it? What's happening?

553
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:01,747
It's a decoy, the real virus
truck's still out there somewhere.

554
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,471
You all right, sir?
Fine.

555
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,572
Pierce, anything yet?
No, nothing yet, sir.

556
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,452
You know, since I've blown my career,
now, by supporting you, Colonel,

557
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,514
maybe you'd satisfy my curiosity.
Why did you leave S.H.I.E.L.D.?

558
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,859
I didn't.

559
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:44,625
When the Iron Curtain was sent to the
cleaners, I was suddenly out of style.

560
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,366
Not diplomatic enough.

561
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,170
It was time for me to move on.

562
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,874
Because they changed the rules?

563
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,445
For me, Kate, there never were
any rules.

564
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:02,412
Big Nest to Bad Bird.
Copy, Big Nest.

565
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:07,185
We just intercepted a burst transmission.
We got a voice print match for Viper.

566
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:10,158
Triangulated your target zone,
and you're almost right over it.

567
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:11,717
Bingo.

568
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,658
Sir, we're right over something.
I have a proximity alert.

569
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:19,361
We have two surface-to-air missiles
being launched.

570
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,028
So much for stealth distorters.

571
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:25,564
How close?
Close. Impact, 20 seconds.

572
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,577
All right, let's move or we're gonna have
two heat seekers up our exhausts.

573
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,272
Hang on, people.

574
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,445
It's no use, Colonel, they're
closing.

575
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:41,017
Can we bail out?
It's 15 seconds. Bail out, sir?

576
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:44,185
Bail out, grab your gear.
Grab your gear.

577
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:59,373
We lost all contact with them, Gabe.
Micro band and UHF.

578
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,740
They were blown out of the sky.

579
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,439
Well, I'm not surprised,
I knew Fury would screw up.

580
00:53:06,983 --> 00:53:08,917
There could be another reason,
Timothy.

581
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:11,351
A transmission glitch,
a sudden static charge.

582
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,322
Maybe, but let's be realistic.

583
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:18,619
We can't count on Fury
knocking out Hydra's HQ.

584
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,063
What are you going to tell Val?

585
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,096
Nothing yet, not till I have to.

586
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,138
Head Nurse to Chief Surgeon.

587
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,195
Yeah, talk to me Val.

588
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,937
Checked out all possibilities,

589
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:35,008
it's all negative.
We're running out of time, here.

590
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:37,239
Copy, scanning a wider area now,
stand by.

591
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,153
Okay, Val, we've got one last
possible on the screen now,

592
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,711
but it's moving away from Manhattan.

593
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,724
Give us the coordinates, Tim.
We got to do something.

594
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,692
All right, 6A and 14C.

595
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,098
Call me as soon as you get
a visual.

596
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:59,701
Got it?
Yeah, got it.

597
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,655
Disengage gear.

598
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,935
Arm yourselves, check your
weapons.

599
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:52,344
All right, let's go kick some
Hydra butt.

600
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,337
Chief Surgeon to Head Nurse, have
you located the suspect vehicle yet?

601
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,835
Yes sir, I have it in sight now.

602
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:19,006
It's still moving away from
New York.

603
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,985
Its thermal's showing a refrigerated
area in the rear.

604
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,487
And five passengers.

605
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,051
Are you sure this is it?
It looks like a garbage truck.

606
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,255
We will be there shortly.

607
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,202
As soon as we are set up,
I will call the island

608
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,760
and let them know we are
operational.

609
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,001
Ja, and ask them
if the money has been paid.

610
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:48,010
And when our escape helicopter
will be here.

611
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:56,750
Well, this is stupid,
they're going around in circles.

612
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,084
Right, take these people out.
Sir,

613
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,884
I happen to know that area
very well

614
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,357
and the prevailing winds
at this time of the year.

615
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,918
That bomb goes off, the Death Head
virus will cover Jersey, Pennsylvania

616
00:56:06,996 --> 00:56:09,692
and most of Ohio in 10 hours.

617
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,064
Now, you want to explain to
the governors of those states

618
00:56:12,135 --> 00:56:15,036
why you just wiped out 40 million
people?

619
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:23,212
I didn't think so. So, sir, if you'd be kind
enough to shut up, I'll get back to work.

620
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,323
Kate, Kate.

621
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,274
Lasers.

622
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,846
Allow me.

623
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,990
A blow to the brachial plexi
should suffice.

624
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:48,990
I was top of my class in advanced
silent killing.

625
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,090
I can do this in my sleep.

626
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,636
Damn it.

627
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,518
Bloody hell.

628
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,529
Sorry.

629
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:35,309
If you weren't such an idiot,
I would suspect you for treason.

630
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,441
Wait a minute.

631
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,077
I feel it, too.

632
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,785
Something's not right.
What do you mean?

633
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:57,496
It's all been too easy. Let's go.

634
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:12,372
Let's go. Move along. Come on.

635
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,242
You liked my kissing so much
that you're back for more?

636
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,880
I'm amazed you've lasted
this long.

637
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:32,362
Tell me something.
Even if you get the money

638
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,767
you're still going to release
the virus, aren't you?

639
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,395
Of course I am.

640
00:59:38,775 --> 00:59:41,471
What better way to convey my father's
message?

641
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,978
And you're willing to sacrifice
your brother to do it?

642
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,539
Werner? Please.
Werner was always expendable.

643
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:52,215
His life is a small price to pay
for the coming revolution.

644
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,989
And what revolution might that be?

645
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:58,619
Oh, Colonel! The world is on
the verge of a great change.

646
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:03,527
The once-great global powers are
scurrying about like feeble old men,

647
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,501
praying for deliverance that
will not come.

648
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:13,972
I danced on your poisonous
father's grave.

649
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:18,241
I'll dance on your grave too,
sweetness.

650
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,118
Tell me, how is Hydra's dental
plan?

651
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:30,549
Kill him.
No.

652
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,926
Fury is already dead.

653
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,931
And there will be plenty of time
for fun and games.

654
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,230
Later.

655
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,137
You can have the woman.

656
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,702
And I'll have that pretty
one there.

657
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,272
Search them thoroughly.

658
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,338
Get up.

659
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,464
Hands behind your back.

660
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:13,061
Turn.

661
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,194
They're clean.

662
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,040
Really.

663
01:01:20,943 --> 01:01:24,401
The eye patch.
You really are suspicious, aren't you?

664
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:27,914
You know, it's not a very
attractive trait.

665
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,555
No wonder people don't like you.

666
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,754
An electronic lock pick.

667
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:46,791
Oh, there it is. I thought
I left it in my other patch.

668
01:01:49,172 --> 01:01:51,003
You bore me, Fury.

669
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,503
Take them, lock them up.

670
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,410
Turn around. Move it.

671
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:06,653
Are all systems checked,
are we fully operational?

672
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,384
Ja.
Good.

673
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:11,518
I will give you the signal
when the time comes.

674
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,928
And it will come soon.

675
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,762
I think it's arrived, Dugan.

676
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,655
Go, go, go.

677
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:53,029
Maybe you should rest, sir.
Conserve your energy.

678
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:56,498
Viper screwed up putting me
in here.

679
01:02:56,572 --> 01:03:00,099
Probably had a fever of 103,
I'm normal now.

680
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,667
Colonel, I...

681
01:03:03,146 --> 01:03:06,309
I wish to apologize for my
conduct earlier.

682
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,509
I really behaved foolishly.

683
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:12,584
In the unlikely event that
we actually survive this mission,

684
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,153
I shall resign.

685
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:17,920
Enough of the martyr routine,
Pierce.

686
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:22,795
You're a bit on the retentive side but
you've got the makings of a good agent.

687
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:51,183
I got them, Val. Journey's end.
Looks like an abandoned shipyard.

688
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,630
Well, the good news is there's
only one exit.

689
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:57,928
And the bad news?
If, as I suspect,

690
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,596
the virus is loaded into a short range
missile in the back of this truck...

691
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,373
They couldn't miss Manhattan
if they tried.

692
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,418
Check one.

693
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,809
Sir.

694
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,289
Well.

695
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:06,765
Thirty minutes to the deadline.

696
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:14,566
Thirty minutes.

697
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:36,956
We got to go.

698
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:42,795
Chief Surgeon to Head Nurse. We got
to go. Start preparing your stations.

699
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,065
Weren't we coordinating our incision
with the other surgical team,

700
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:46,130
shouldn't we wait?

701
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:52,138
Val, we've lost contact with
the other team.

702
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,683
Their transporter may have
been brought down.

703
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,446
We can't count on them.

704
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,954
We're doing everything we can
to find him, Val.

705
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,687
Just because Nick's out of touch, doesn't
mean he's out of the game, Timothy.

706
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,129
The patient needs surgery ASAP.

707
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:13,430
So let's start prepping for OR.
Now, please.

708
01:06:13,836 --> 01:06:18,739
The subject is still setting up.
Let's wait. Just a few minutes more.

709
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:32,651
What's happening?
You know the saying,

710
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,589
"If thine eye offend thee,
pluck it out"?

711
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,351
This one's been annoying me lately.

712
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:48,202
Relax, its only plastic.

713
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:53,007
With a little Cracker Jack
surprise inside.

714
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,007
What exactly is it?
Cyclonite.

715
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:58,706
With a stun flash directional
charge.

716
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,114
Take cover.

717
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,756
I just spoke with the President.
He wants a progress report.

718
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:19,528
What should I tell him?

719
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:22,469
We've located their
communications channel.

720
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,566
We've isolated their launch
position.

721
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,836
Tell him to start praying.

722
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,421
Halt!

723
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:54,134
Come on!
Yes.

724
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:21,160
Val, 20 minutes. We can't wait
any longer.

725
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,061
We've had no word from Beta Team.
We have to go.

726
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:28,536
I'm commencing jamming of the
communication systems in 90 seconds.

727
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,099
Val, are you reading me?

728
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:40,344
Val, come in, please.

729
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,111
I'm reading you.

730
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,374
Do you have to?

731
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,180
Garotte!

732
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,120
Freeze!
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

733
01:10:04,466 --> 01:10:05,831
Don't move, don't move, don't move!

734
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,635
Down, down, stay down!

735
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:10,933
Freeze.

736
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:14,499
You wouldn't dare shoot.

737
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:21,915
You'll put the whole city at risk.
Only if I miss, laughing boy.

738
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:35,156
Head Nurse to Surgeon.
Operation over.

739
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,164
Patient sedated.

740
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,530
Sir, you're burning up.
Never mind me.

741
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,165
It's 20 minutes to Viper's deadline,
go on, get out of here.

742
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:22,608
We can't leave you.
Viper's poison must be getting to me.

743
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:25,044
That's an order. Go on.
No, Colonel.

744
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:27,376
We all knew the score

745
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:31,613
when we signed up for this field
trip. That is an order, go.

746
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:36,019
Come on, you heard the colonel,
let's go. Come on.

747
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,196
The trigger signal comes in
by modem, see.

748
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,496
His sister calls in the five-digit
number sequence by satellite phone,

749
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:47,899
completely independent.

750
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,995
So what are the digits?
The digits are in code.

751
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:54,240
The assumption is, only Viper
knows what the numbers are.

752
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:56,210
So let's pull the plug.
No modem, no signal, right?

753
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,473
No, don't, it may be rigged.

754
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:07,913
Are you getting this, Tim?

755
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,991
Loud and clear, Val, we're online.

756
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,355
Feel free to contribute any
suggestions.

757
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,955
Something, anything.

758
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,398
The abort code.
Your guess is as good as mine, my love.

759
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,459
Look, don't touch anything.
We're working on it up here.

760
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,437
Any word from Nick?
No, not a word.

761
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:25,905
We've kept all the channels open,
but all the frequencies are dead.

762
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:28,072
Well, then, so are we.

763
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,080
Along with the entire population
of greater New York.

764
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:43,681
Fury's regalia will make a handsome
addition to the trophy case.

765
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:47,990
You're getting sentimental
in your old age, Zola.

766
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,694
Any moment we should be
hearing from Manhattan.

767
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,665
Your brother. What will become
of him?

768
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:06,878
Werner believes a helicopter waits
to spirit him away to safety,

769
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:11,386
just as he believes that the decision
to detonate the warheads was his.

770
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:15,253
You are every bit as ruthless
as your father.

771
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,923
I'd like to think so.

772
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:25,324
I only wish he could be here
to share in our victory.

773
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:42,380
Mistake.

774
01:13:43,118 --> 01:13:45,643
You underestimated an old man.

775
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,712
I wouldn't do that, doc.

776
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,986
Those things have a way
of backfiring.

777
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:58,863
How stupid do you think I am?

778
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,637
What was the question?

779
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,346
Detonation in 10 minutes.

780
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,919
Look, Fury, you're too late.

781
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,155
Which way?

782
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,964
Let me concentrate a minute.

783
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,098
Can I help? What can I do?

784
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,506
Follow me.
There they are.

785
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,446
Something tells me it's this way.

786
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,656
Revenge is mine.

787
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:13,764
How much ammunition have we got left?
Just a couple of rounds.

788
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:22,946
I can't hear you, Colonel Fury.
What, no witty ripostes?

789
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:27,250
No clever comebacks? I said,
"Revenge is mine."

790
01:15:27,322 --> 01:15:29,688
Don't you have anything to say?

791
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,928
I always heard living well
is the best revenge.

792
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:43,528
But I just killed you.

793
01:15:43,605 --> 01:15:47,405
No, you just killed my life
model decoy.

794
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:49,510
Useful little toy, isn't it?

795
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:08,754
Thank goodness I've been trained
in hand-to-hand combat.

796
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,320
Yes, that's very comforting.

797
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:22,302
Close, close. Damn it.

798
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,850
Haven't lost my touch.

799
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:37,918
That's an LMD, folks.
He's just taking a short siesta.

800
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,622
Pierce, arm your control panel.
I want to call New York.

801
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:58,102
Colonel, the equipment's over
here.

802
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:04,042
We're outnumbered, Colonel.
Don't worry about it, kid.

803
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,216
You know, he's a bit uglier
than I remember.

804
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:12,989
Your frozen Pop-sicle.
Get it, Andrea? Pop-sicle.

805
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,461
You know, that's the problem
with the Third Reich.

806
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,293
No sense of humor.

807
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,433
Detonation in five minutes.

808
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,003
This is Hydra headquarters

809
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,567
calling S.H.I.E.L.D. In Nueva York.
Is anyone listening?

810
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:33,410
Nick. Thank God, I thought
you were dead.

811
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,245
I was, but now I'm better.

812
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:42,449
Quiet, quiet, Nick Fury,
you swine, I knew it.

813
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:45,254
Listen, they've activated the countdown.
I'm aware of that, Tim.

814
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,592
Look, there's only one way to stop it.
You must get us the abort code.

815
01:17:53,735 --> 01:17:54,997
Pierce here, Commander.

816
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:57,597
Working on it.

817
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:05,045
You heard the man.
Sorry, what was the question?

818
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:10,016
My poison must have reached your brain
if you think I'm going to give it to you.

819
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,151
Kate.

820
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:40,212
Kate. The numbers.

821
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:53,425
Now, you listen to me. Now, you dig
deep. You can do it, you can do it.

822
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:16,581
Detonation in two minutes.
You're our only chance.

823
01:19:16,651 --> 01:19:20,644
The numbers, I need the numbers.
Now, you dig deep.

824
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:24,116
3.
All right, Kate, you can do this.

825
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:26,091
You can do this.

826
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:29,858
And a 7, 9, 0.
Detonation in one minute.

827
01:19:30,932 --> 01:19:35,164
Now, you dig deep, you can do this,
you can do this.

828
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,531
You can do this.

829
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:42,236
Oh, it's a 6. 6.

830
01:19:45,347 --> 01:19:48,805
3, 7, 9, 0, 6.

831
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:51,944
You got that, Val?
3, 7, 9, 0, 6. Got it.

832
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:53,920
No, no, wait, wait.

833
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,388
The last number is wrong, it's
a 9, not a 6.

834
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:58,483
We're not going to get another
chance, are you sure?

835
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,585
I think so.
You think so?

836
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:04,257
What's it going to be Nick?
9 or 6? It's your choice.

837
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:12,906
9, 9.

838
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:18,745
No, 6, 6, 6!

839
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,629
The situation's contained, Nick.

840
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,038
We're okay.

841
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,172
I always knew we would be.

842
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:51,307
Like hell, you did.

843
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,719
Score one for the free world.

844
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:08,259
All right.

845
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:12,061
Let's get the old man off ice
and get the hell out of here.

846
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:15,460
Sir...

847
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,131
Like I said before, kid,
don't worry about it.

848
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,299
He's right to worry, Fury.

849
01:21:20,375 --> 01:21:23,867
You got lucky with the numbers game,
but your luck's about to run out.

850
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:27,073
In ten seconds they'll be coming
through the door with a hundred men.

851
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,173
You haven't got a chance.

852
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,524
Really?

853
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:55,767
Get up. Come on.

854
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,038
Chamber three.

855
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,807
Buddy, I know you're hurting.

856
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,871
How are those spasms, are they
still getting worse?

857
01:22:00,949 --> 01:22:02,075
Yeah, they are.

858
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:07,383
Listen, once I get this medicine
in me, how long before it works?

859
01:22:07,455 --> 01:22:10,185
I am going to run a computer
program on her template.

860
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,089
Then as soon as we have
the data together...

861
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,492
I will see you in hell for this.

862
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,788
We'll do lunch.

863
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,160
Quite a woman, Nicholas.

864
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:22,760
That's too high maintenance
for me.

865
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,510
What the hell is that?

866
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,814
Colonel Fury, sir.
There's another countdown.

867
01:22:44,726 --> 01:22:47,422
Val, it's Nick, do you read me?

868
01:22:53,201 --> 01:22:54,862
Come on, come on.

869
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,868
What the hell's going on?

870
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:00,168
Come on.

871
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:54,091
She's halfway to China by now.

872
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:15,173
Okay.

873
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,913
That should do it, Nicholas.

874
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:23,547
It'll only take a few moments for your
body to start metabolizing the antiserum.

875
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:25,115
Thanks, Gabe.

876
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:30,964
You were damn close that time.
Yeah. Close only counts in horseshoes.

877
01:24:31,032 --> 01:24:35,230
Just keeping you on your toes, pal,
just keeping you on your toes.

878
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:39,069
You might have some
residual discomfort, Nicholas.

879
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,132
A few days of diminished
motor coordination.

880
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,270
Fury.

881
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,338
Pincer.

882
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:50,145
What, you've come to wish me well?
Hardly.

883
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:53,119
If you think I've forgotten your
breach of protocol, you're mistaken.

884
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:55,986
I'm putting in a request for
a full disciplinary tribunal.

885
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,821
Well, imagine that. What are
the charges?

886
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:02,158
For starters, insubordination.
Incitement to mutiny.

887
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,926
Unauthorized use of a military
vehicle.

888
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,762
You forgot one.

889
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:10,168
Attempted grievous bodily harm.

890
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:16,274
How was that for diminished
motor coordination?

891
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,849
Oh, boy.
Sir.

892
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:26,813
Mr. Director, sir. Mr. Pincer.

893
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,515
Let me see that.

894
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,337
Peaceful, isn't it?

895
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:50,636
Mmm.

896
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,875
What's on your mind, Nick?

897
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,418
Hydra.

898
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:00,349
S.H.I.E.L.D.

899
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:05,750
Sometimes I think we're the only thing
that keeps each other in business.

900
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:13,891
You know Val, there's something
I want to get straight between us.

901
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,799
I'm not stopping you.

902
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,766
What I'm trying to say is that...

903
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:31,350
Maybe I lost more than my job
when I parted ways with S.H.I.E.L.D.

904
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:39,282
And maybe it took a dose of dying
for me to realize it.

905
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:44,329
Well, that sounds an awful lot
like an apology to me.

906
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,999
Yeah.

907
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,598
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

908
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:53,837
Well, maybe I enjoy watching
you squirm.

909
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:59,678
Saints preserve us, you two are
getting me all weepy-eyed.

910
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:01,806
How long have you been eavesdropping,
you old swine?

911
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:03,407
Long enough.

912
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:07,383
We did good, Nick. It's gonna
take Hydra years to regroup.

913
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,389
Doesn't mean I'm gonna sleep
any better at night.

914
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:10,583
Viper's still out there

915
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,853
and we haven't recovered
Von Strucker's body.

916
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:15,361
You still think he poses
a threat to us?

917
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:19,196
Let's just say I get the feeling
this particular war isn't over yet.

918
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,964
And it never will be. If it's not Hydra,
it's gonna be somebody else.

919
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:25,301
There's a whole nest of Vipers
out there.

920
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:26,931
Oh, yeah.

921
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:29,167
Got you something.

922
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,405
Call it a belated homecoming gift.

923
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,576
Cuban, my favorite.

924
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:38,581
You're trying to get me court-martialed.
Didn't see a thing, sir.

925
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:42,313
You know, there's hope for you
yet, Pierce.

926
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,589
What, you're not going to smoke it?

927
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,687
Yeah, I've been thinking
about quitting lately.

928
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:54,133
An army of sociopaths out there,
who'd love to see me cash in my chips.

929
01:27:54,202 --> 01:27:55,533
Why should I help them along?

930
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:00,303
Big words for a one-eyed man.

931
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,588
I thought I'd lost you, Father.

932
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:52,726
I have walked through
the fires of hell,

933
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,196
looked into the face of the beast,

934
01:28:57,565 --> 01:29:00,625
and I have returned.

935
01:29:04,072 --> 01:29:06,506
Let the world tremble this night.

936
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:10,637
Our work has just begun.
