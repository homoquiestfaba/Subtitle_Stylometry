1
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,910
Verified, Becker 1.

2
00:02:00,015 --> 00:02:02,830
I've got your suspect northbound
on Market, heading right on Basket.

3
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:06,549
Link at 12, Henry 1.
You can vector at 135.

4
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:09,955
OK, 43.
Helming a call at 5-4 and Main.

5
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,821
Connect 40 to a backup.

6
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,926
13-A, 43.

7
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:44,766
22, did you clear?

8
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:49,770
22 clear.
I need a number identified.

9
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:12,507
Can you turn that shit off?

10
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,972
Yeah.
- Pasco's double-crossing me now.

11
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:27,185
He's buying from Lopez. That
son of a bitch owes me 100 grand.

12
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,757
I'm losing my patience.

13
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,861
He thinks he's safe with me in here.

14
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,947
Well, what do you want me to do?

15
00:03:34,032 --> 00:03:36,673
You know what to do.
- All right, don't worry about it.

16
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:38,778
I'll take care of it.

17
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,817
Good morning.

18
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:08,929
You're gonna be late for work.
- I don't care.

19
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:13,134
What are you doing today?
- I'm on another stake out with Mac.

20
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:18,764
I gotta listen to his stories again.

21
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,868
You should stay home, then.

22
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,870
I'd better get going.
I'm late now.

23
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:30,234
I gotta go.
See you later?

24
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:34,041
See you later.
There's some coffee down there.

25
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:17,156
Yeah.

26
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,223
Look at the life on this baby?

27
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,247
God, I love cars.

28
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,520
Hey, pal, out of the car.
Can't you read the sign?

29
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:43,624
No touching the cars.

30
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:52,662
What did you say?
- I said out of the car.

31
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,464
Hey, Garrett.

32
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,622
Garrett, what's going on?
Can we talk about this?

33
00:06:20,727 --> 00:06:22,916
Too late.
You went behind our backs.

34
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:25,021
Dealing with Lopez is
not in the contract.

35
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:26,635
It was a one shot deal, I swear.

36
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,825
I was in a bind.
- You owe us 100 grand.

37
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:29,867
I'll get it for you.

38
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,328
I swear, I'll get it by Friday.

39
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,475
Friday?

40
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,734
How many chances do
you think you get?

41
00:06:34,838 --> 00:06:36,194
Remember, you buy from us.

42
00:06:36,298 --> 00:06:37,618
No Lopez, no nobody.

43
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:38,627
Right?

44
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,505
I'll get you $50,000 in an hour.

45
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,102
I swear, I'll get the rest on Friday.

46
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:43,041
Friday?

47
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,257
What's this Friday shit?

48
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,474
Man, today's Tuesday.

49
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,247
I don't have the time.

50
00:06:47,351 --> 00:06:48,636
Johnny?

51
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,574
Kill her.

52
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:51,679
Garrett?

53
00:07:00,593 --> 00:07:02,992
Yeah.

54
00:07:03,096 --> 00:07:05,096
All right.

55
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:07,147
I like his coat.

56
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:13,557
What time you got?

57
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,573
7:20 in the morning.

58
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:16,616
20 seconds.

59
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,146
20 seconds.

60
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,327
Do you know something?

61
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,336
This is like an anniversary for me.

62
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,620
I'm a real happy man today.

63
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,594
Yeah?

64
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:24,158
Why?

65
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:28,225
About a year ago, when I was working
for the Riverside Police Department,

66
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:29,407
we got this call, right?

67
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:31,005
Somebody had broken into a house.

68
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:34,793
So I show up on the scene, I start
checking out the area, and whatnot...

69
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:36,323
All of a sudden, this guy takes
off from behind some bushes.

70
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:38,455
The report also said this
guy was armed and dangerous.

71
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,979
And I'm running behind this guy,
and I'm screaming in my most

72
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:43,136
authoritative voice, halt!
Halt or I shoot.

73
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,838
And he ain't paying no
attention to me, right?

74
00:07:44,943 --> 00:07:45,985
So I get pissed off.

75
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,766
So I pull out my gun, and I take aim.

76
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:50,088
I start shooting.

77
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:51,130
I can't hit him, man.

78
00:07:51,235 --> 00:07:52,555
I swear to God, I tried my best.

79
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,910
I couldn't hit the son of a bitch.

80
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,613
Finally I shot like,
two, three, four times.

81
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,559
Fourth shot, hit the ground.

82
00:07:57,664 --> 00:07:58,985
Ricocheted, hit his heel.

83
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,175
The dude went down, I
caught him, I cuffed him.

84
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,017
Funny thing about it,
I got an accommodation

85
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,615
for not killing the guy.

86
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,161
Some TV news reporter did a
story on me, said that I shot

87
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:10,490
warning shots over the
head of a fleeing felon

88
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,679
who was armed and dangerous.

89
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,966
I couldn't believe it.

90
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,641
Everybody thought I was
like, the big humanitarian.

91
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,121
Truth of the matter was I was
trying to inoculate that son

92
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,925
of a bitch with my 357 magnum.

93
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,592
That's a great story, ain't it, Ron?

94
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:24,531
Yeah, Mac.

95
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:25,818
It's great.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,922
I like it.

97
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I guess I'd better record it.

98
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:56,021
Don't move.

99
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,898
Now get up nice and easy.

100
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:58,941
Come on.

101
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,045
Come on.

102
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,633
You wouldn't shoot
us, would you, officer?

103
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,838
I think I'll start a
collection of these.

104
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:15,694
How old are you?

105
00:09:15,798 --> 00:09:18,509
I'm 23.

106
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,984
Christ, he's just a kid.

107
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:25,287
I want you to count to 500 before
you come through that door.

108
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,504
Do you understand me?

109
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,407
Yes.

110
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:29,511
Do you understand me?
- Yes.

111
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:30,674
That's stupid.

112
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,412
We can't let him go.
Let's off him.

113
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:33,385
He's a cop.

114
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,053
Put the gun away.

115
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,158
Put the gun away!

116
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,638
All right, start counting.

117
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:44,611
One.

118
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,489
I can't hear you.

119
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:47,531
1, 2...

120
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:48,400
That's it.

121
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:56,504
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

122
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:00,495
All right, Garrett!

123
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,338
You're something else, man.

124
00:10:02,442 --> 00:10:10,441
Who.

125
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,954
Code 33.

126
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:16,450
Officer down.

127
00:10:16,553 --> 00:10:20,134
Code 30... 10th and Jay.

128
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:21,211
Let's go.
- Shit.

129
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,184
Let's crank it up.

130
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,288
Let's get out of here.

131
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,370
Did you see the look
on that cop's face?

132
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:30,733
I loved it.
- Look, don't get carried away.

133
00:10:30,837 --> 00:10:33,515
This is business, Johnny, not fun.

134
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:34,800
Dumbass punk.

135
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:37,859
If it wasn't for Shanks,
you'd be washing cars and kissing ass.

136
00:10:37,964 --> 00:10:39,389
Hey, stop putting me down, man.

137
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,882
I'm going to run this show
when Shanks gives the word,

138
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,413
and you know it.

139
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,949
And now every cop in this
city will be looking for us.

140
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:45,749
Piece of shit.

141
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,861
Why don't you junk it?

142
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,877
What do you mean, piece of shit?

143
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,614
It's a piece of shit!

144
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,719
It is not a piece of shit.

145
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:10,322
Christ.

146
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:12,338
It's Jake's kid.

147
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:13,624
Two white men.

148
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,258
Tell me which way they went.

149
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:16,509
They went north.

150
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:18,803
North on... on the highway.

151
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:20,907
What were they driving?

152
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,198
Driving a black...

153
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:27,492
Black Impala.

154
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:29,596
Custom.

155
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,469
There's nothing we can
do for him down there.

156
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,193
If there's a Heaven, I
hope you're looking down

157
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:10,297
when I blow these guys away.

158
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:23,312
Lincoln 44, Lincoln 44, Baker 1.

159
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,856
Lincoln 44, be advised, I have
positive contact on that 1958

160
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,962
black and white convertible.

161
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,834
Lincoln 44, Baker 1.

162
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:50,630
Be advised, suspect vehicle
is eastbound on Highway 280.

163
00:12:50,734 --> 00:12:51,638
OK, 43.

164
00:12:51,743 --> 00:12:54,871
Handle a call at 54 Main.

165
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,136
This is unit 44.

166
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,256
Do have visual contact, proceeding

167
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,280
to highway, southbound at Merritt,

168
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,504
in pursuit two suspects.

169
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,118
Black custom Impala, custom
paint, flames on the sides.

170
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:14,648
Texas tags.

171
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:19,548
Frank, George, Henry, 671.

172
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,652
Request backup.

173
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,885
I'll take this floor.

174
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,831
You go upstairs.

175
00:14:47,936 --> 00:14:50,126
We've got a lot of area to cover.

176
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,168
What about backup?

177
00:14:51,273 --> 00:14:52,697
Fuck backup.

178
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:56,728
I'm gonna get these sons of
bitches for what they did.

179
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:13,924
Freeze!

180
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,071
Down on your knees.

181
00:16:15,176 --> 00:16:16,809
All right, all right.
I'm down.

182
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,338
Put your hands on your head.
Now!

183
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,103
Move it!

184
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,181
All right!

185
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:22,857
Easy.
Don't shoot.

186
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:23,795
Shut up.

187
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,899
Shut up!

188
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,167
Shit.

189
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:35,021
Man.

190
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,864
All right, Al Capone.

191
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:37,837
Stand up.

192
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:38,810
Come on, let's go.

193
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,914
Stand...

194
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:45,762
Dumb shit, falling for that, man.

195
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:46,804
Get the keys.
- Relax.

196
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:47,986
I'm trying to find it.

197
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,975
The damn thing... relax.

198
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,053
You know, Johnny?

199
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:53,999
I got a better idea.

200
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,355
What?
What?

201
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:56,779
Lean forward.
Lean forward some...

202
00:16:56,884 --> 00:16:57,752
What is it, man?

203
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:58,691
Lean forward!

204
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:01,749
I... what?

205
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:39,079
Ron... man, what did you do, man?

206
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,747
Have you gone crazy?

207
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,851
I got hit from behind.

208
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,808
I didn't do it.

209
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:01,254
Let me have your gun, man.

210
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,938
So what happened to Johnny?

211
00:18:40,042 --> 00:18:41,259
How come you left him?

212
00:18:41,363 --> 00:18:43,622
I told you, we got separated.

213
00:18:43,726 --> 00:18:46,195
For Christ's sakes, man,
it's lucky I got out

214
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,420
of there with my life, myself.

215
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:51,790
The cop was fucking nuts.

216
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,737
He was a pound short of a shilling.

217
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,023
Any more of this coffee left?

218
00:18:55,127 --> 00:18:57,004
The cop's a dead man.

219
00:18:57,108 --> 00:18:59,993
Shanks was grooming Johnny
to take over the operation.

220
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,245
Johnny.

221
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,669
Johnny.

222
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:05,486
Johnny was a day late, a dollar
short, and on the wrong train.

223
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:06,562
He was a punk.

224
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,717
Face it, Garrett,
you never liked him.

225
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,038
And you did, right?

226
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,741
I'd like to take care
of this cop myself,

227
00:19:11,845 --> 00:19:14,974
but Johnny's gone, and
Shanks will take care of him.

228
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:16,537
We got business to take care of.

229
00:19:16,641 --> 00:19:17,719
We gotta take care of Lopez.

230
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,283
He's getting out of hand.

231
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:23,558
He's moved his operation to
a bigger warehouse downtown.

232
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,444
This small timer has got big ideas,

233
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:29,398
and he's giving himself some
muscle to back himself up.

234
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:34,473
Are you sure of that?

235
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:36,905
I want you to take care of him.

236
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,009
And don't blow it.

237
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,197
What was that?

238
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,059
I said, don't blow it.

239
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,535
I thought Shanks ran this operation?

240
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,620
I mean, since when did you take over?

241
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,430
Well, la dee da.

242
00:20:08,534 --> 00:20:10,534
So that's what it's about?

243
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,347
I got some parts to move out.

244
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:18,092
I gotta go.

245
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,197
Yeah, it's getting late.

246
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:31,300
You know, Garrett, I don't
trust those sons of bitches.

247
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,103
And us here...

248
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:59,835
I got into this business
because I love cars.

249
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:01,939
I really love cars.

250
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,483
Well, if you ever feel like you

251
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:10,124
need to do something
with Clinton and Tulson,

252
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,228
let me know.

253
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:18,102
Just keep your eye on 'em.

254
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,953
Did you assist with the
autopsy on the victim?

255
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:42,448
Yes, I did.

256
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,097
And based upon your findings,
what is your conclusion?

257
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:50,059
I have determined that the
assailant was standing, holding

258
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:52,839
the weapon approximately 2 inches

259
00:21:52,943 --> 00:21:58,227
from the victim, who was
handcuffed and kneeling.

260
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:01,111
Detective Maguire, did
you find any evidence

261
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:02,398
that would suggest that there was

262
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:04,502
a second suspect in the area?

263
00:22:07,055 --> 00:22:08,654
Look, I'm sure there was.

264
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:11,052
He probably went out a
window, or something.

265
00:22:11,156 --> 00:22:12,304
That is your opinion.

266
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,570
I am asking you, detective,
is there any evidence

267
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,213
that would suggest
that a second person

268
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:23,808
might have hit Detective Taylor
from behind, as he testified?

269
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:25,685
There was no evidence.

270
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:30,169
Ronald Taylor, you are hereby
sentenced to 15 years to life.

271
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,670
I order that you be placed
in a federal penitentiary

272
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:34,340
for your own protection.

273
00:22:34,444 --> 00:22:37,502
You will be transferred to a
straight correctional facility

274
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,039
as soon as authorities
deem it appropriate.

275
00:23:14,588 --> 00:23:18,412
Where did you two get all this stuff?

276
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:22,756
I'll give you $500 for the lot.

277
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,633
6,000.

278
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,954
Come on.

279
00:23:26,058 --> 00:23:27,518
The last batch of stuff
I got from you guys

280
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:30,438
is still sitting in the warehouse.

281
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,419
500.

282
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:35,129
6,000.

283
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,250
This stuff is hot.

284
00:23:37,354 --> 00:23:38,189
You guys are crooks.

285
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,204
I'll call the cops.

286
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:42,671
Andy, Ramirez, come on
over here for a minute.

287
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,839
Bad mistake, my friend.

288
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:58,713
Bad mistake.

289
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:39,742
What are you in for?

290
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:41,847
Hey, I'm talking to you.

291
00:24:44,296 --> 00:24:47,250
Touch me again, and
I'll pull your asshole

292
00:24:47,354 --> 00:24:49,717
through that garbage
disposal you call your mouth.

293
00:25:13,561 --> 00:25:15,561
51.

294
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:28,924
Gentlemen, I'm Senior Corrections.

295
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,114
Officer Michael Prentice.

296
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:34,102
I'd like to welcome you all on board.

297
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:39,107
The rules in this federal
penitentiary are very simple.

298
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,749
You will cooperate.

299
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,634
You'll be issued the inmates'
manual, which will tell you

300
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:46,893
about the rules and
guidelines that you

301
00:25:46,997 --> 00:25:49,848
must follow while you're
in this institution.

302
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:53,359
For the next 30 days, you'll
be at a reception program

303
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:55,463
and/or orientation.

304
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:59,093
You'll be assigned to a team
of correctional professionals

305
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:01,804
who will manage your stay here.

306
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:05,419
After this meeting you'll get
your medical examinations,

307
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,721
and you'll be issued
your jail clothing.

308
00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:13,065
My advice to you, you can
make your prison stay as hard,

309
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,394
or as easy as you want to.

310
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:19,564
Participate in all the
programs, and act like adults.

311
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:24,431
Any violations of the rules will
result in disciplinary action.

312
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:25,925
Thank you.

313
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:28,029
Follow the yellow line.

314
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:42,331
A, D, and E blocks,
stand in for lockdown.

315
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,265
All right, Taylor.

316
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,933
Here's your new home.

317
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,038
Lock it down!

318
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,029
All lockdown units, report for count.

319
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:45,241
Welcome to the big league, slugger.

320
00:27:45,345 --> 00:27:46,944
Name's Dieter Guthrie.

321
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:50,176
Former baseball player from
the state of Tennessee.

322
00:27:50,281 --> 00:27:52,281
How you doing?

323
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,842
Well, there ain't much to the place.

324
00:27:55,946 --> 00:28:00,360
- head bunk's yours, of course.

325
00:28:00,464 --> 00:28:01,403
There's the shitter.

326
00:28:01,507 --> 00:28:05,017
Take turns cleaning it, twice a week.

327
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,720
There's a TV.

328
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,285
Watch anything you like.

329
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:10,389
As long as you like what I like.

330
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,781
You know... word has it
that you're a policeman.

331
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:20,553
Now, I don't find any
offense with that.

332
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,952
I figure, live and let live.

333
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:25,906
But... there' some
boys in this place

334
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:28,513
that do find an
offense to that, so I'd

335
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:31,190
watch my ass in more ways than
one, if you know what I mean.

336
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,233
Yeah, yeah.

337
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:34,337
I met your welcoming committee.

338
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,090
Great bunch of guys.

339
00:28:36,194 --> 00:28:40,401
Well, our welcoming committee
is calling you the executioner.

340
00:28:40,505 --> 00:28:43,111
I'm not an executioner.

341
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:44,605
Damn.

342
00:28:44,709 --> 00:28:47,003
Another innocent man.

343
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:51,523
You know, this whole place
is filled with innocent men.

344
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:53,087
Except me.

345
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,191
I did it.

346
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,404
Say, Maguire, I'm curious...

347
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:15,122
How does it feel to turn
in your own partner?

348
00:29:15,226 --> 00:29:17,521
You don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

349
00:29:17,624 --> 00:29:19,050
I had no choice.

350
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:20,162
He was your partner, man.

351
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:21,760
You stabbed him in the back.

352
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:22,699
Look, you weren't there.

353
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,437
Neither one of you guys were there.

354
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:26,418
So why don't you just get
out of my face, all right?

355
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:29,094
What do we got here,
an attitude problem?

356
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:00,098
Decided to take the 500?

357
00:30:00,203 --> 00:30:02,203
We came to throw you another offer.

358
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,798
Good catch.

359
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:15,703
You called?

360
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,547
Hey, what's going on around here?

361
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,292
Other suppliers have tried
to invade our territory.

362
00:30:20,397 --> 00:30:24,289
Our clients, like Ramirez, are
giving our drivers a bad time.

363
00:30:24,393 --> 00:30:26,965
They say they think they can
get parts from other sources.

364
00:30:30,441 --> 00:30:33,603
Make an example of Ramirez.

365
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:37,878
Well, as usual, Tulson,
I'm way ahead of you.

366
00:30:37,983 --> 00:30:42,502
And by the way, this is
the last time I tell you...

367
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:44,605
Don't tell me what to do.

368
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:22,889
That maniac's getting out of hand.

369
00:31:22,993 --> 00:31:25,913
Somebody's going to have to
take over this operation,

370
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,137
and we can't let it be Garrett.

371
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,778
Maybe we should put a leash on him?

372
00:31:30,883 --> 00:31:31,612
Yeah.

373
00:31:31,717 --> 00:31:33,717
Permanently.

374
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:27,363
Guys.

375
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,492
What are you doing?

376
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:33,516
Shit.

377
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,940
Jesse.
- Shanks.

378
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:35,913
Where you been, man?

379
00:32:36,017 --> 00:32:36,991
I missed you.

380
00:32:37,095 --> 00:32:39,095
I've just been so busy.

381
00:32:39,145 --> 00:32:40,119
Personal problems, and all.

382
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,266
You know, Shanks.

383
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:42,865
Yeah, I know how it is.

384
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:45,402
Morales has been real
good to you this week.

385
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,043
And you've missed appointments.

386
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:49,955
You've been avoiding me, man.

387
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
And that's not healthy.

388
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,914
You know who I am?

389
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,418
Hey, Shanks, come on, man.

390
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:03,267
Back off!

391
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:05,283
You killed Johnny.

392
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:06,916
He didn't have a chance.

393
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:07,994
Fuck you, asshole.

394
00:33:08,098 --> 00:33:10,566
I didn't kill anybody.

395
00:33:16,718 --> 00:33:18,718
It's only the beginning, Taylor.

396
00:33:36,322 --> 00:33:37,711
Put a leash on me?

397
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,387
Put a leash on me, right?

398
00:34:03,778 --> 00:34:05,655
What do you know
about this guy so far?

399
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,115
Name is Henry Tulson.

400
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:09,861
Has a list of priors dating
back to the early '70s.

401
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:10,904
Chop shop operator.

402
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,606
That sound familiar?

403
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:15,457
Breaks down cars, chops
'em up, sells off the car

404
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:17,716
parts for far more
than the car is worth.

405
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,107
Big business.

406
00:34:19,211 --> 00:34:20,288
Who did he work for?

407
00:34:20,394 --> 00:34:21,852
Someone by the name of Shanks had

408
00:34:21,957 --> 00:34:24,946
a multimillion dollar operation
before he went to prison.

409
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:26,858
The guy Taylor killed
was Shanks' cousin.

410
00:34:26,962 --> 00:34:28,248
Did you know that, detective?

411
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:29,638
No, I didn't.

412
00:34:29,742 --> 00:34:32,210
You know, this whole situation
is starting to bother me.

413
00:34:32,314 --> 00:34:34,504
I got a bad feeling about Taylor.

414
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:37,320
Like... maybe he
didn't kill anybody.

415
00:34:37,424 --> 00:34:38,814
Maybe he was telling the truth.

416
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:42,325
Maybe the DA's office
railroaded him for no reason.

417
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,028
The suspect was handcuffed.

418
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,523
Yeah, I was there.

419
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,503
But Johnny didn't go into
that building by himself.

420
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,762
I know that for sure.

421
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:52,647
If I could just find his partner...

422
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:54,073
At least we got a good
lead here, though.

423
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:56,401
It's the small businessmen
who buy the stuff.

424
00:34:56,505 --> 00:34:59,112
You can take an $8,000 car,
break it down into parts,

425
00:34:59,216 --> 00:35:01,476
and sell it for more than $35,000.

426
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:02,866
You think they're going to talk?

427
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,465
Taylor was my partner.

428
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:07,314
It was my testimony
that put him away.

429
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,747
That still keeps me awake at night.

430
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:12,146
I'm going to find this guy.

431
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,988
And I'm going to put him away.

432
00:35:14,092 --> 00:35:16,212
Prove me wrong, detective.

433
00:35:16,317 --> 00:35:17,776
Prove me wrong.

434
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:19,881
You bet.

435
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:32,479
Louis Howard, report to industries.

436
00:36:48,596 --> 00:36:49,639
Well, excuse me.

437
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:51,743
I have to go see the man now, Ron.

438
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:01,839
Who's that?

439
00:37:01,943 --> 00:37:03,750
Local pusher?

440
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,855
Flush.

441
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:10,701
You have a package for me, honey?

442
00:37:10,806 --> 00:37:12,648
Got nothing for you this week.

443
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:14,664
What are you talking about?

444
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:16,768
Sit down, bitch.

445
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:22,832
All right, guys.

446
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,936
Back to work, back to work.

447
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:28,671
What do you mean?

448
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:29,679
I was supposed to get
a package every week.

449
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:30,652
That was the deal.

450
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,425
Hey, holmes, you been late, bro.

451
00:37:32,529 --> 00:37:33,711
You've been missing appointments.

452
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:35,206
Is that the way you're
gonna repay Shanks

453
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,048
for all that stuff for you?

454
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,160
Morales, please.

455
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:39,133
I haven't been myself.

456
00:37:39,237 --> 00:37:41,705
I've been sick.

457
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:43,809
Holmes, you pay me...

458
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,999
Taylor!

459
00:37:57,103 --> 00:37:59,674
Knock off the bullshit
and get back to work!

460
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:04,644
He reminds me of an
umpire I used to know.

461
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:23,379
You boys are doing some good work.

462
00:38:23,484 --> 00:38:25,484
Leave me alone.

463
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:42,078
You fellas know what?

464
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:43,989
I just love the smell of gas fumes.

465
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:46,770
It reminds me of home.

466
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,682
Why don't you just go
ahead and ask that driver

467
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:50,524
for a ride out of here, Jesse?

468
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:51,984
Hell, I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

469
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:53,721
You guys ever really
think about breaking out

470
00:38:53,826 --> 00:38:54,938
of this place?

471
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,962
Just about every second I'm awake.

472
00:38:58,066 --> 00:39:00,152
You see that vehicle there?

473
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,307
Man, it just goes right out.

474
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:04,669
Just right out to the outside.

475
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,095
You gotta understand, Taylor...

476
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,528
Dieter, he's an old timer like me.

477
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:10,821
But that truck is our
only way out of here,

478
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:13,637
and we just don't have
the balls to do it.

479
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:14,924
Speak for yourself, dude.

480
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:17,028
Ha ha ha.

481
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,250
Hey!

482
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:58,354
Get over here!

483
00:40:04,209 --> 00:40:05,321
You the guy who called?

484
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:07,546
Yes, I called.

485
00:40:07,649 --> 00:40:09,649
Let me get this right...

486
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,995
You want a transmission
for a 280 SEL,

487
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:15,573
you want a rear panel for a BMW 735,

488
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,764
and you want 12 alloy BBS rims?

489
00:40:17,868 --> 00:40:18,702
That's right.

490
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:20,058
It's exactly what I want.

491
00:40:20,162 --> 00:40:21,484
What are you going to
do with all that stuff?

492
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,985
What you mean, what I'm
doing with all this stuff?

493
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:26,245
Yeah.

494
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:27,635
I'm redecorating my house with it.

495
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,165
That's what I'm doing with it.

496
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,400
Man, why you wanna ask me
some stupid questions, man.

497
00:40:31,424 --> 00:40:32,639
I can't sell it to you.

498
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:35,073
And who the hell are you?

499
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:36,360
Who am I?

500
00:40:36,464 --> 00:40:39,070
Who am I?

501
00:40:39,174 --> 00:40:40,356
I'm American Express.

502
00:40:40,461 --> 00:40:41,155
I'm Visa.

503
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:42,442
I'm the Discover Card.

504
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:44,353
Look, man, my money
is good, all right?

505
00:40:44,458 --> 00:40:46,855
I work eight hours a day,
I work 10 hours a day.

506
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,072
I work Saturdays and Sundays.

507
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:49,393
I got customers.

508
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:51,236
I do side jobs, I do
in jobs, I do out jobs.

509
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,452
I'm a job man.

510
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:53,737
That's what this
whole thing is about.

511
00:40:53,841 --> 00:40:56,275
Jobs, man.
And... wait a minute, newsflash.

512
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:57,630
Newsflash.

513
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,368
You're not selling to me
because I'm a black man.

514
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:00,688
That's it, isn't it?

515
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,731
I'm a black man, he
won't sell it to me.

516
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:02,705
That's right.

517
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:03,886
You know what?

518
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,103
I'm a black man with five children.

519
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:09,483
Jamal, Janice, Shaquan,
Shawonga, and...

520
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:10,351
And Elvis.

521
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:11,325
That's right, Elvis.

522
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:12,714
And Elvis is sick.

523
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,558
Elvis is so sick, he
has to live in a bubble.

524
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:16,572
You gonna bust my little boy's
bubble just because I'm black.

525
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:18,902
I'm gonna call the NAACP, the SPCA...

526
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:20,569
Wait a second.

527
00:41:20,674 --> 00:41:21,960
Wait a second.

528
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:22,933
It takes a couple of
days to get these things.

529
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:24,670
I can't get 'em overnight.

530
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,514
I got a shipment coming in Thursday.

531
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,321
Come back on Thursday.

532
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:29,920
Thursday.
All right, then.

533
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:30,858
Thursday's good.

534
00:41:30,962 --> 00:41:31,831
I'll be back Thursday.

535
00:41:31,935 --> 00:41:33,152
Yeah, come back then.

536
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:35,029
Pleasure doing business
with you gentlemen.

537
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:36,385
And I like your establishment.

538
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:37,739
It's so beautiful around
here, and everything.

539
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:39,060
Just come back Thursday?

540
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,382
Just do me a favor.

541
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:41,460
And my son will be
able to get that neck

542
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:43,440
transplant that he needs.

543
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:46,255
I'm going home to
take care of him now.

544
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
Later.

545
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,534
Hey, we got to load up right.

546
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:22,334
Well, get it.

547
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:24,438
Let's get out of here.

548
00:42:37,348 --> 00:42:39,364
Everything's here but the radios.

549
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,588
The boss says the radios
will be here next time.

550
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:45,759
OK.

551
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,863
5,500.

552
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:50,556
Boss said 7,500.

553
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,321
7,500?

554
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:52,850
6,500.

555
00:42:52,954 --> 00:42:54,657
Boss said 7,500.

556
00:42:54,761 --> 00:42:55,804
I'm not paying 7,500.

557
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:58,932
7,000.

558
00:42:59,036 --> 00:42:59,975
7,000?

559
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,079
OK.

560
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:29,796
Rover unit one, all clear.

561
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,900
East gate.

562
00:43:33,584 --> 00:43:36,296
Ronald Taylor, you have a visitor.

563
00:43:53,918 --> 00:43:56,316
Hi.

564
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,783
Let me say hi to Chelsea.
- OK.

565
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,251
Here, Daddy wants to say hi.

566
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:02,364
Hi, Daddy.

567
00:44:02,468 --> 00:44:04,101
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

568
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:05,110
Fine.

569
00:44:05,214 --> 00:44:06,152
You miss daddy?

570
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:07,508
Yeah.

571
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:09,611
Let me speak to mommy again.

572
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:15,640
How is it?

573
00:44:15,745 --> 00:44:17,900
It's not that bad in here.

574
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:20,993
I worry about you all the time.

575
00:44:21,098 --> 00:44:23,098
I love you.

576
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:23,982
Don't worry about me.

577
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:27,006
I can take care of myself.

578
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,292
How's Chelsea doing?

579
00:44:28,397 --> 00:44:31,560
She misses you.

580
00:44:31,663 --> 00:44:34,027
How's the money holding out?

581
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:36,183
There's still plenty in the bank.

582
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:40,354
And my mom's going to get
me in where she works.

583
00:44:40,458 --> 00:44:43,064
It's only part time.

584
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:45,983
It'll be good for to get out.

585
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:49,598
Besides, we could
use the extra money.

586
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:51,059
I wanted us to have a good life,

587
00:44:51,163 --> 00:44:54,465
and I turned it all to shit.

588
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:56,569
You don't need this.

589
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:00,234
You don't need me.

590
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,389
Don't say that.

591
00:45:02,493 --> 00:45:04,493
I love you.

592
00:45:04,544 --> 00:45:06,544
None of this matters.

593
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,210
We only have a short time.

594
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:13,060
Let's not ruin it, honey.

595
00:45:13,164 --> 00:45:16,744
I want you to divorce me.

596
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,516
What?

597
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,359
It's better for you.

598
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:22,549
For the baby.

599
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:24,564
You can start fresh.

600
00:45:24,668 --> 00:45:27,240
But I don't want a divorce.

601
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:28,387
You can beat this thing.

602
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,492
We know you didn't do it.

603
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:34,643
Mac called.

604
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:39,406
He says he's on to something.

605
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,143
I thought he forgot about me.

606
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,576
He wants to talk to you.

607
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,704
He says he'll call
you later this week.

608
00:45:46,808 --> 00:45:49,102
A waste of time.

609
00:45:49,207 --> 00:45:51,639
Visiting hours are over.

610
00:45:51,744 --> 00:45:59,743
Inmates report to block E.

611
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:08,392
Closing up!

612
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:10,498
All right.

613
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,330
Hey!

614
00:47:01,432 --> 00:47:02,336
Taylor?

615
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,621
Report down to the kitchen.

616
00:47:03,725 --> 00:47:05,725
They've got a little job for you.

617
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:44,947
Hey, pig!
You're gona die!

618
00:47:45,051 --> 00:47:46,442
Hey, back it off, man.

619
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:48,547
Come on!

620
00:48:29,645 --> 00:48:31,869
Sorry about the little
mess downstairs, boss.

621
00:48:36,284 --> 00:48:37,777
Yeah, the jerk set me up.

622
00:48:37,883 --> 00:48:38,994
Everything all right?

623
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:40,627
Yeah.

624
00:48:40,732 --> 00:48:43,999
There was a monkey down
there waiting for me.

625
00:48:44,104 --> 00:48:46,104
Asshole.

626
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:51,194
You really think
that shit's gonna work?

627
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:54,427
It won't stop a knife,
but it'll slow it down.

628
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,728
I wore a flack jacket
for 15 months in 'Nam.

629
00:48:57,832 --> 00:49:00,057
Never thought I'd be
wearing one again.

630
00:49:00,162 --> 00:49:04,542
Especially one made out of
"Newsweek," for Christ's sakes.

631
00:49:04,645 --> 00:49:05,722
You see a lot of shit over there?

632
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:08,920
Yeah, I saw my share.

633
00:49:09,024 --> 00:49:10,346
I thought, if I could
only survive this,

634
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,585
the rest of my life would be gravy.

635
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,690
You ever kill anybody?

636
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:34,049
Can't even tell the difference.
- Yeah.

637
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:35,579
Yeah, you couldn't tell it, man.

638
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:39,542
Just, looks like you're
wearing an umpire's vest.

639
00:49:39,645 --> 00:49:42,739
You're really hung up on
that baseball stuff, aren't ya?

640
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,915
Good luck to you, man.

641
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,019
Thanks.

642
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:15,046
Bring 'em in.

643
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:31,120
It's nice to see you
doing an honest day's work.

644
00:50:31,225 --> 00:50:33,225
Go to hell.

645
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:33,405
Hey!

646
00:51:33,509 --> 00:51:35,509
Yeah, boy!

647
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,052
Fuck him, man.

648
00:51:41,156 --> 00:51:42,407
Fuck you.

649
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:44,180
I get it.

650
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:47,308
No, he ain't shit.
- Yo.

651
00:51:47,412 --> 00:51:49,984
Yo.
- Just come on out this way.

652
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:52,088
Come here.

653
00:51:54,363 --> 00:51:56,363
Keep going.

654
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:58,638
Real costume show.

655
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:01,766
It ain't no show, man.

656
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,408
Them dudes are for real.

657
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:07,258
You mind your own business,
they leave you alone.

658
00:52:07,362 --> 00:52:09,135
At least most of the time.

659
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:10,491
You're in the wrong place.

660
00:52:10,595 --> 00:52:12,854
Yeah.

661
00:52:38,227 --> 00:52:40,227
This is for Johnny!

662
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:57,100
Attention in the yard.

663
00:52:57,204 --> 00:52:59,775
Attention in the yard.

664
00:53:30,397 --> 00:53:32,969
Bend over!

665
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:40,373
There's nothing worse
than a cop gone bad.

666
00:53:40,477 --> 00:53:42,477
Thomas should have finished you off.

667
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,126
You could have done
us all a big favor.

668
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,933
I won't die in this place!

669
00:53:46,037 --> 00:53:47,844
I wouldn't put any money on that.

670
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:49,950
Close five.

671
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:00,219
I won't die in this place!

672
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:04,320
I won't die in here!

673
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:10,611
So what are you getting at?

674
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:15,269
What I'm getting at is Shanks is out.

675
00:54:15,373 --> 00:54:16,416
Look, he's in the joint.

676
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,361
He does nothing.
We do all the work.

677
00:54:18,466 --> 00:54:20,898
Why shouldn't we have
the lion's share?

678
00:54:21,003 --> 00:54:23,158
I don't know about this.

679
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:26,391
He has powerful friends
in and out of prison.

680
00:54:26,495 --> 00:54:28,495
This is a dangerous move.

681
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:30,249
Garrett, you know, he's right.

682
00:54:30,353 --> 00:54:31,396
When he finds out
about this, he's not

683
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,203
going to take this lying down.

684
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,490
You can bet on that.

685
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:36,747
Don't worry about Shanks.

686
00:54:36,852 --> 00:54:40,224
I'll take care of him the
way I did Tulson and Johnny.

687
00:54:40,328 --> 00:54:42,328
So the cop was telling the truth?

688
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:44,151
Nobody fucks with me.

689
00:54:44,256 --> 00:54:46,896
I've got a bad feeling.

690
00:54:47,002 --> 00:54:49,002
I don't know about this.

691
00:54:52,632 --> 00:54:55,899
I know that you were
really tight with Tulson,

692
00:54:56,003 --> 00:54:57,915
but I think we can
work this thing out.

693
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:00,348
I really do, all right?

694
00:55:00,452 --> 00:55:02,781
Look, what I do is in the
best interest of the business.

695
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:17,449
You know, there's always
resistance to change.

696
00:55:17,553 --> 00:55:19,360
Look, why don't you just
think this thing over?

697
00:55:19,465 --> 00:55:22,071
There's no rush, you don't
have to make any big decision.

698
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:24,176
Just think it over.

699
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,250
OK.

700
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:28,883
Good.

701
00:55:28,987 --> 00:55:31,561
I'll think about it.

702
00:55:31,664 --> 00:55:33,664
I'll let you know.

703
00:55:37,503 --> 00:55:40,110
Cut me in.

704
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:40,875
What?

705
00:55:40,979 --> 00:55:42,979
Cut me in.

706
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:51,841
Yeah.

707
00:56:21,888 --> 00:56:25,364
Clinton, I have a brilliant idea.

708
00:56:28,631 --> 00:56:30,681
All right, gentlemen,
stand back from your cells.

709
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:32,785
Lock it up.
Lockdown.

710
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,001
So there it was, bottom
of the ninth, two men out.

711
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:49,137
But we got three runners
on, and the score is 4-3.

712
00:56:49,242 --> 00:56:50,389
Army's lead.

713
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:53,899
Well, who do you expect
comes up to the plate?

714
00:56:54,003 --> 00:56:55,290
That's right.

715
00:56:55,394 --> 00:56:56,541
Old Dieter.

716
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,765
Now, that pitcher is just
scared to death of me.

717
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:01,059
You see, I already got two
hits off of this turkey,

718
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:04,604
and he's up there
sweating rosary beads.

719
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:06,447
So that first pitch comes...

720
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:09,123
It damn near takes my head off.

721
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:10,444
Ball one.

722
00:57:10,548 --> 00:57:13,085
Second pitch, low and outside.

723
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,371
Ball two.

724
00:57:14,475 --> 00:57:17,603
Third pitch comes, damn near
knocks me off the plate.

725
00:57:17,707 --> 00:57:18,959
Ball three.

726
00:57:19,063 --> 00:57:22,260
Boy, I got this turkey
right where I want him.

727
00:57:22,366 --> 00:57:24,173
I just cock that big bat back.

728
00:57:24,277 --> 00:57:26,918
I want me a base hit on
this next pitch, though.

729
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:28,726
Here it comes.

730
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:31,089
Damn near takes off my head again.

731
00:57:31,194 --> 00:57:33,592
I say hey, run batted
in is a run batted in.

732
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,241
Threw my bat down, started
going to first base.

733
00:57:37,346 --> 00:57:40,543
Umpire says, strike one!

734
00:57:40,646 --> 00:57:42,107
I said, what the hell?

735
00:57:42,212 --> 00:57:42,872
Strike?

736
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:44,123
I said, all right.

737
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:44,991
OK.

738
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:47,008
I went back, got my big stick.

739
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:48,468
I'm ready for the next pitch.

740
00:57:48,572 --> 00:57:51,352
I wanted a base hit, anyway,
you know what I mean?

741
00:57:51,457 --> 00:57:52,708
Here comes the ball.

742
00:57:52,812 --> 00:57:53,751
Low and inside.

743
00:57:53,855 --> 00:57:56,183
Hell, couldn't hit it if I wanted to.

744
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:59,451
Umpire says, strike two.

745
00:57:59,556 --> 00:58:00,946
Strike two?

746
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:01,744
God damn.

747
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,822
Now, that made me mad.

748
00:58:02,926 --> 00:58:04,595
Now, I was hot.

749
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:05,534
All right.

750
00:58:05,637 --> 00:58:07,341
I dug back into that...

751
00:58:07,445 --> 00:58:09,842
That batter's box, and I'm
ready for that next pitch.

752
00:58:09,947 --> 00:58:12,311
Now, that count's three and two.

753
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:13,805
Here comes the ball.

754
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:17,872
I swear to God, Mr. Taylor,
hit in front of the plate

755
00:58:17,976 --> 00:58:20,270
before it crossed it.

756
00:58:20,374 --> 00:58:22,391
I started going to first base.

757
00:58:22,495 --> 00:58:26,144
Umpire said... strike three.

758
00:58:26,248 --> 00:58:28,248
Strike three!

759
00:58:28,299 --> 00:58:29,828
God damn.

760
00:58:29,932 --> 00:58:31,462
God damn, that made me mad!

761
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:36,258
And I had that... that big, 40
ounce baseball bat in my hand,

762
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:37,093
and...

763
00:58:37,197 --> 00:58:38,448
I just...

764
00:58:38,553 --> 00:58:43,141
You telling me you killed the umpire?

765
00:58:43,245 --> 00:58:47,276
Well, I ain't proud of it, but...

766
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,570
That's the truth.

767
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:55,167
In front of 2,500 witnesses.

768
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:59,858
Christ, listening to you
reminds me of my partner.

769
00:58:59,962 --> 00:59:00,797
God damn.

770
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:02,901
Strike three.

771
00:59:07,262 --> 00:59:09,417
Why are you doing this, Garrett?

772
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:11,259
I told you I was going
to think about it.

773
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:14,700
Yeah, well, I thought about
it, man, and I changed my mind.

774
00:59:14,804 --> 00:59:16,229
You know, I really did.

775
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:18,975
You've got to anticipate
the future if you want

776
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:22,382
to get ahead in this world.

777
00:59:22,486 --> 00:59:23,771
And you didn't.

778
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,336
You hesitated.

779
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,263
Now, you know they say about
the quick and the dead?

780
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:31,626
You're a bad risk, Clinton.

781
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,260
A bad risk.

782
00:59:33,364 --> 00:59:35,519
Please don't do this to me.

783
00:59:35,622 --> 00:59:38,439
Well, I'm sorry.

784
00:59:38,543 --> 00:59:41,497
Fuck you, Garrett!

785
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:44,347
Fuck me?

786
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:47,441
Fuck you.

787
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:08,870
I don't want anymore mistakes.

788
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:10,137
Don't worry, holmes.

789
01:00:10,242 --> 01:00:11,771
I made one just like
this in San Quentin.

790
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,829
It blew the motherfucker's head off.

791
01:00:14,933 --> 01:00:19,278
You roll this real tight,
pack some matches in it,

792
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:21,746
some metal from your zipper.

793
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:25,917
Light the end, and bang,
the motherfucker's dead.

794
01:00:26,021 --> 01:00:28,559
He'd better be dead this time.

795
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:32,590
One more fuck up, and it's your ass.

796
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:35,231
What you got?

797
01:00:35,336 --> 01:00:36,204
Come on.

798
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,247
Come on.

799
01:00:37,352 --> 01:00:38,811
Are those mine.
- Yeah.

800
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:40,028
Come on.
You don't draw 'em.

801
01:00:40,132 --> 01:00:41,314
Who in the hell taught you this game?

802
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:42,600
Dieter, come on.

803
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:44,704
No!

804
01:00:55,703 --> 01:00:57,703
Dieter!

805
01:01:03,176 --> 01:01:06,513
Hey, Dieter, man, stay with me.

806
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:07,799
It'll be OK.

807
01:01:07,903 --> 01:01:08,772
It'll be OK, man.

808
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:10,876
Hey...

809
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:18,087
Strike... strike three, man.

810
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:20,346
Dieter!

811
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:22,362
Dieter!

812
01:01:22,466 --> 01:01:23,336
No, man!

813
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,483
No!

814
01:01:24,587 --> 01:01:26,587
No!

815
01:01:30,147 --> 01:01:32,147
Are you going that way?

816
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:39,915
Hey, man.

817
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:42,313
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
come to see you sooner.

818
01:01:42,417 --> 01:01:43,633
I really feel bad.

819
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:45,545
It was my testimony
that put you in here.

820
01:01:45,649 --> 01:01:47,649
There's nothing you could have done.

821
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,229
You're a good cop, Mac.

822
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:51,569
Yeah, well, I know you didn't
kill that punk Johnny Shanks.

823
01:01:51,593 --> 01:01:54,095
I've been tailing this guy that
runs a foreign car dealership

824
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:55,659
over on the east side.

825
01:01:55,763 --> 01:01:57,085
You know the place?

826
01:01:57,189 --> 01:01:58,023
Yeah.

827
01:01:58,127 --> 01:01:59,379
Yeah, I know the place.

828
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:01,534
Yeah, well, I'm pretty
sure that it's a front.

829
01:02:01,637 --> 01:02:03,306
Is he the son of a
bitch that set me up?

830
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,834
Could be.

831
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,295
I can't prove it yet, but
there's been a lot of action

832
01:02:06,399 --> 01:02:07,754
in the streets.

833
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:09,771
A lot of people being killed
over on the east side,

834
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,196
and every one of the victim seems

835
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,038
to be related to a chop shop.

836
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:14,359
Well, what can I do?

837
01:02:14,463 --> 01:02:15,609
How can I help?

838
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:17,070
Well, right now all you
can do is just stay alive

839
01:02:17,174 --> 01:02:19,294
until I can get you
out of here, buddy.

840
01:02:19,398 --> 01:02:20,857
Just stay alive.

841
01:02:20,963 --> 01:02:22,283
Yeah.

842
01:02:22,388 --> 01:02:25,098
It's getting to be a full time job.

843
01:02:25,202 --> 01:02:27,202
Take care.

844
01:02:34,656 --> 01:02:37,298
Can't see you until another week.

845
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:40,167
That's a long time.

846
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:24,915
Now I need a big favor.

847
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:26,201
Name it.

848
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:27,696
I need fresh vehicles.

849
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,547
I need one a month, every month.

850
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,318
Not too flashy.

851
01:03:32,422 --> 01:03:34,021
They gotta have air conditioning.

852
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:35,446
My homeboys got a lot of business

853
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:37,428
to do out in the desert.

854
01:03:37,532 --> 01:03:40,069
Tell me when, and where.

855
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:41,216
I'll see to it.

856
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,059
I'll give you the specs
in a couple of days.

857
01:03:43,163 --> 01:03:46,570
And Mr. Shanks,
don't disappoint me.

858
01:03:46,673 --> 01:03:48,411
I've never disappoint you, Ralph.

859
01:03:48,515 --> 01:03:50,114
I don't intend to now.

860
01:03:50,218 --> 01:03:50,878
Good.

861
01:03:50,982 --> 01:03:52,373
Let's keep it that way.

862
01:03:52,478 --> 01:03:53,937
And what happened the other day?

863
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:57,205
I thought Thomas was your main man?

864
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:58,733
He couldn't even waste that pig.

865
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:02,314
If some pig killed my
cousin, he'd be dead already.

866
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:03,565
Don't you worry about Taylor.

867
01:04:03,669 --> 01:04:05,720
I'll take care of him on my own time.

868
01:04:50,834 --> 01:04:53,163
There's a phone call
for you in the office.

869
01:05:05,537 --> 01:05:08,283
Yeah, Garrett, I
need a late model Mercedes.

870
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:10,473
Something really
nice, like a 500 SEO.

871
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,577
It's gotta have air conditioning.

872
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:14,574
Yeah, air conditioning.
Right.

873
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:15,860
Yeah, Garrett, look...

874
01:05:15,964 --> 01:05:16,658
Don't worry about.

875
01:05:16,763 --> 01:05:17,945
I'll take care of it.

876
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:19,475
OK, I haven't heard from Tulson.

877
01:05:19,579 --> 01:05:20,413
Where the hell is he?
I'm getting worried...

878
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,628
Man, I don't know.

879
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:23,228
He's been acting
really peculiar lately.

880
01:05:23,332 --> 01:05:25,140
Yeah, I think it has something
to do with his mother,

881
01:05:25,244 --> 01:05:26,669
or something.
Maybe he's down in Florida?

882
01:05:26,773 --> 01:05:27,885
Florida?

883
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,511
What the hell's he doing in Florida?

884
01:05:29,797 --> 01:05:30,944
Look, Garrett, you just get that car.

885
01:05:31,048 --> 01:05:32,404
All right, I'll take care of it.

886
01:05:32,508 --> 01:05:33,654
Look, don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

887
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:35,080
Have Tulson call me tomorrow.

888
01:05:35,184 --> 01:05:36,332
All right.
All right, the same time...

889
01:05:36,436 --> 01:05:37,305
Now, you'd better start taking

890
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:38,173
care of business, Garrett.

891
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:40,278
All right, be well.

892
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:03,615
You want some?

893
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,597
No.

894
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,821
Did you hear what I said?

895
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:10,635
I was short by half last month.

896
01:06:10,741 --> 01:06:12,201
I've got a price.

897
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:13,417
I take all the risks.

898
01:06:13,522 --> 01:06:16,753
Look, we had a nice
arrangement for a time, OK?

899
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:18,561
We don't need you anymore.

900
01:06:18,665 --> 01:06:22,001
So you're off the payroll.

901
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:23,323
What are you talking about?

902
01:06:23,427 --> 01:06:24,470
You heard what I said.

903
01:06:24,575 --> 01:06:25,512
We're not going to pay you anymore.

904
01:06:25,617 --> 01:06:29,022
Why are you doing this to me?

905
01:06:29,128 --> 01:06:30,830
I got my orders.

906
01:06:30,935 --> 01:06:33,680
Shanks' orders?

907
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,488
Come on.

908
01:06:35,593 --> 01:06:37,920
You mean to tell me
he never mentioned

909
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:39,832
anything like this to you?

910
01:06:39,937 --> 01:06:43,030
I've saved his ass a dozen times.

911
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:44,281
Without me, he's finished.

912
01:06:44,386 --> 01:06:46,472
Look, settle down, all right?

913
01:06:46,576 --> 01:06:48,729
I'm going to let you
in on something...

914
01:06:48,834 --> 01:06:51,858
There's going to be a
change in the organization.

915
01:06:51,962 --> 01:06:55,890
Now, if something should
happen to Shanks...

916
01:06:55,994 --> 01:06:57,994
I'd be willing to put
you back on the payroll.

917
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:02,791
You want some?

918
01:08:18,403 --> 01:08:20,524
All right.

919
01:08:20,627 --> 01:08:21,531
Did I not do you right?

920
01:08:21,634 --> 01:08:22,991
Isn't that nice?
Top...

921
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:24,868
Hey, man, this thing
got air conditioning?

922
01:08:24,972 --> 01:08:26,606
Wraps said it would.

923
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:28,065
I just serviced it myself.

924
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:30,881
I mean, this thing is
colder than the North Pole.

925
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:32,272
Yeah, but does it have a stereo?

926
01:08:32,376 --> 01:08:34,183
I brought my tapes.

927
01:08:34,287 --> 01:08:35,746
Top of the line, bro.

928
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,912
I'm telling you, you're going
to get some get down bass.

929
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:39,813
What a rush you'll get with that.

930
01:08:39,917 --> 01:08:41,517
Yeah, but does it have power?

931
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:43,741
Does it have power?

932
01:08:43,845 --> 01:08:46,139
This is a luxury car, my friend.

933
01:08:46,243 --> 01:08:48,363
It's nothing but power.

934
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:50,530
Now look, we're going to have
a better one for you guys

935
01:08:50,554 --> 01:08:51,597
next month, all right?

936
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:52,466
Here you go.

937
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,619
Enjoy, and drive safely.

938
01:08:54,724 --> 01:08:55,384
OK.

939
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,567
All right.

940
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,670
Have a good trip.

941
01:09:03,588 --> 01:09:05,588
Go with God.

942
01:09:55,549 --> 01:09:57,549
Sayonara, Jack.

943
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:21,026
Hey man, what's going to?

944
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:23,667
You set my homeboys up.

945
01:10:23,771 --> 01:10:25,509
Three of my best.

946
01:10:25,614 --> 01:10:29,228
They didn't get more than
a mile from your shop, man.

947
01:10:29,333 --> 01:10:31,835
They got their car, right?

948
01:10:31,939 --> 01:10:33,399
They're dead.

949
01:10:33,504 --> 01:10:35,902
And now you're dead.

950
01:10:36,006 --> 01:10:37,883
Hey, Wrap... hey,
what's going on, man?

951
01:10:37,987 --> 01:10:38,647
Pres?

952
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:40,767
Pres, back these guys off.

953
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:43,965
Shanks... cut me off?

954
01:10:44,069 --> 01:10:46,363
Well, we'll see who needs who.

955
01:10:46,468 --> 01:10:47,719
Pres!

956
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:49,353
You can't do this to me, Pres!

957
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:51,457
Get your ass over here!

958
01:10:58,007 --> 01:11:00,007
No!

959
01:11:12,953 --> 01:11:13,821
Hey!

960
01:11:13,926 --> 01:11:15,926
I want him!

961
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:23,970
If you want him that
bad, you can have him.

962
01:11:29,844 --> 01:11:32,312
I should kill you
myself, you son of a bitch.

963
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:33,494
Well, why don't you?

964
01:11:33,599 --> 01:11:35,892
Because you've got something I need.

965
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:37,664
And I didn't kill your cousin.

966
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:38,638
It was his partner.

967
01:11:38,742 --> 01:11:39,785
He set me up.

968
01:11:39,889 --> 01:11:41,889
He set me up, too.

969
01:11:41,975 --> 01:11:44,790
Who is it?

970
01:11:44,894 --> 01:11:46,424
Who is it?

971
01:11:46,528 --> 01:11:47,397
Garrett.

972
01:11:47,501 --> 01:11:49,501
It's James Garrett.

973
01:12:06,618 --> 01:12:09,259
I heard the angels call, but I

974
01:12:09,364 --> 01:12:11,901
don't want to take the fall.

975
01:12:12,005 --> 01:12:15,029
I would wait a thousand
years, my friend.

976
01:12:18,366 --> 01:12:21,181
I'll be with you tonight.

977
01:12:21,285 --> 01:12:24,240
I'll be your guiding light.

978
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:27,402
You know I've always wanted you.

979
01:12:27,506 --> 01:12:30,356
Yeah.

980
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:33,450
So give me one more night.

981
01:12:33,554 --> 01:12:35,554
To calm my appetite.

982
01:12:35,606 --> 01:12:39,810
I've been waiting
here too long for you.

983
01:12:39,914 --> 01:12:42,313
Yeah.

984
01:12:42,418 --> 01:12:45,406
Just give me one more day.

985
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:47,318
And don't turn me away.

986
01:12:47,422 --> 01:12:50,586
I'm the one for you,
and you know it's true.

987
01:12:54,234 --> 01:12:58,371
Hear the thunder,
and does it make you

988
01:12:58,475 --> 01:13:01,186
wonder how you were my girl?

989
01:13:01,291 --> 01:13:03,291
Never turn me down.

990
01:13:06,573 --> 01:13:09,493
You always came with me.

991
01:13:09,597 --> 01:13:11,891
It was no fantasy.

992
01:13:11,996 --> 01:13:14,150
I'll be waiting just for you.

993
01:13:14,254 --> 01:13:18,252
Don't lie to me, I
know you want me, too.

994
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:20,476
Asking me, one more night.

995
01:13:20,581 --> 01:13:22,909
To calm my appetite.

996
01:13:23,013 --> 01:13:27,567
Well, I've been waiting
here too long for you.

997
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah.

998
01:13:30,104 --> 01:13:33,337
Just give me one more day.

999
01:13:33,441 --> 01:13:35,178
And don't turn me away.

1000
01:13:35,282 --> 01:13:38,792
I'm the one for you,
and you know it's true.

1001
01:13:42,443 --> 01:13:45,014
Give me one more night.

1002
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,143
One more night.

1003
01:13:48,247 --> 01:13:50,247
Just give me one more night with you.

1004
01:13:54,469 --> 01:13:57,493
One more night.

1005
01:13:57,597 --> 01:13:59,404
One more night.

1006
01:13:59,509 --> 01:14:02,254
So give me one more night with you.

1007
01:15:26,157 --> 01:15:29,390
Don't even breathe.

1008
01:15:29,494 --> 01:15:31,648
Now, you do exactly what I tell you.

1009
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:34,465
Start the car.

1010
01:15:34,569 --> 01:15:36,585
Start it.

1011
01:15:36,688 --> 01:15:40,789
Put your hands up on the wheel,
and drive out nice and slow.

1012
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:57,056
Now I remember where I know you from.

1013
01:15:57,160 --> 01:16:00,045
It was the restaurant, right?
Wasn't it?

1014
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:02,513
Garrett, you son of a bitch.

1015
01:16:02,618 --> 01:16:05,364
It's all over for you.

1016
01:16:05,468 --> 01:16:06,718
Really?

1017
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:08,664
Did Johnny have to die, too?

1018
01:16:08,768 --> 01:16:11,792
That was my partner that you set up.

1019
01:16:11,897 --> 01:16:13,897
Your partner?

1020
01:16:17,006 --> 01:16:18,363
Now I understand.

1021
01:16:18,467 --> 01:16:20,899
Why'd you do it?

1022
01:16:21,004 --> 01:16:23,750
I needed time to get rid of Shanks.

1023
01:16:23,854 --> 01:16:25,765
And your partner happened
to have been there.

1024
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:27,121
That's all.

1025
01:16:27,225 --> 01:16:28,824
You mean to tell me
this whole damn thing

1026
01:16:28,928 --> 01:16:30,179
was just to get rid of Shanks?

1027
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:33,099
Well, Shanks was gonna
groom that idiot Johnny

1028
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:34,455
to take over the operation.

1029
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:37,756
Now, let me ask you something...

1030
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:39,530
Are you here by yourself, or are we

1031
01:16:39,633 --> 01:16:43,388
gonna to have a million
copies down our ass?

1032
01:16:43,492 --> 01:16:44,638
Yeah.

1033
01:16:44,742 --> 01:16:46,898
And they're probably
outside right now.

1034
01:16:54,614 --> 01:16:56,614
I don't believe you.

1035
01:17:03,095 --> 01:17:03,928
Hey, Taylor?

1036
01:17:04,032 --> 01:17:06,987
Got some mail for ya.

1037
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,580
Move it up.

1038
01:18:52,683 --> 01:18:54,683
Right here.

1039
01:19:18,715 --> 01:19:19,654
Taylor.

1040
01:19:19,758 --> 01:19:21,758
Good luck.

1041
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:27,232
Help!

1042
01:19:27,336 --> 01:19:28,240
Help!

1043
01:19:28,344 --> 01:19:30,916
Help!

1044
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,020
Help me, please!

1045
01:19:33,105 --> 01:19:34,009
Please, help me!

1046
01:19:34,114 --> 01:19:35,052
Please!

1047
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:36,408
Please help!

1048
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:38,389
Please!

1049
01:19:38,493 --> 01:19:39,639
Please, I can't take it!

1050
01:19:39,744 --> 01:19:40,856
No!
Get it off!

1051
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,829
Help!

1052
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:42,802
Help me!

1053
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:44,907
Get it off!

1054
01:21:43,896 --> 01:21:45,947
Gotta be quiet.

1055
01:21:46,051 --> 01:21:49,144
Don't want to wake up mommy, now.

1056
01:21:49,248 --> 01:21:51,248
Goodnight.

1057
01:21:57,139 --> 01:21:59,139
Ron?

1058
01:22:14,655 --> 01:22:16,290
Sweetheart.

1059
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:18,306
You go to sleep now.

1060
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,523
Daddy's home.

1061
01:22:19,627 --> 01:22:21,294
Everything's gonna be OK, all right?

1062
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,400
Go to sleep.

1063
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:36,380
I broke out.

1064
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:38,570
They killed Mac.

1065
01:22:38,673 --> 01:22:39,612
I gotta get even.

1066
01:22:39,716 --> 01:22:41,280
If I don't do it, no one else will.

1067
01:22:41,384 --> 01:22:43,295
They won't listen to me.

1068
01:22:43,401 --> 01:22:46,355
It's the only chance
I've got to clear myself.

1069
01:22:46,459 --> 01:22:48,459
But they'll be looking for you.

1070
01:22:48,545 --> 01:22:50,545
They'll kill you if they find you.

1071
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:54,889
I love you.

1072
01:22:56,955 --> 01:23:00,118
Please... please don't do this.

1073
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:02,222
Let's do this the right way.

1074
01:23:05,506 --> 01:23:07,506
There is no right way.

1075
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:21,806
Find Garcia, tell him to
get everybody over here.

1076
01:23:21,911 --> 01:23:23,718
We gotta get out of here
sooner than I thought.

1077
01:23:23,822 --> 01:23:24,865
You come with me.
- Right.

1078
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:25,803
We're going to have some company.

1079
01:23:25,908 --> 01:23:27,908
We don't have much time.

1080
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,108
Leave that alone.

1081
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,212
I'll go to the door, and
check the office window.

1082
01:23:41,826 --> 01:23:42,903
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1083
01:23:43,008 --> 01:23:44,503
Be gentle.
Gentle with that, my man.

1084
01:23:44,607 --> 01:23:45,476
Come on.

1085
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:46,624
Come on, easy.

1086
01:23:46,727 --> 01:23:47,561
Hold on.

1087
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:49,474
Wait a minute.

1088
01:23:49,578 --> 01:23:51,697
Wait a minute.

1089
01:23:51,801 --> 01:23:53,018
Wait a minute.

1090
01:23:53,122 --> 01:23:53,957
Come on.

1091
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:55,104
Go upstairs.

1092
01:23:55,208 --> 01:23:57,208
Drag that along the upstairs door.

1093
01:26:47,012 --> 01:26:48,368
You want it?

1094
01:26:48,472 --> 01:26:50,472
You've got it!

1095
01:27:09,812 --> 01:27:12,037
OK, asshole.

1096
01:27:12,141 --> 01:27:14,470
It's time to wake up.

1097
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,667
Who's the asshole now?

1098
01:29:14,971 --> 01:29:18,100
You killed my partner.

1099
01:29:18,205 --> 01:29:21,159
I underestimated you.

1100
01:29:21,263 --> 01:29:24,113
You set me up.

1101
01:29:24,218 --> 01:29:27,972
You'll never know that
for sure, because you're

1102
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:30,161
not gonna leave here alive.

1103
01:29:30,266 --> 01:29:32,316
I don't expect to
get out of here alive.

1104
01:29:32,421 --> 01:29:34,923
That's not why I came.

1105
01:29:35,027 --> 01:29:37,027
I came for you.

1106
01:29:57,722 --> 01:29:58,870
Drop the gun!

1107
01:29:58,975 --> 01:29:59,808
Drop it!

1108
01:29:59,913 --> 01:30:00,816
Drop the gun!

1109
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:02,920
Drop it!

1110
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:21,689
Shit.

1111
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:47,668
Ron?

1112
01:30:47,772 --> 01:30:49,303
You in a hurry, man?

1113
01:30:49,407 --> 01:30:51,407
How about a lift to the hospital?

1114
01:30:58,027 --> 01:30:58,791
Hey, man.

1115
01:30:58,895 --> 01:30:59,764
Where the hell have you been?

1116
01:30:59,868 --> 01:31:01,190
I thought you were dead.

1117
01:31:01,294 --> 01:31:02,371
Hey, man, you know me.

1118
01:31:02,476 --> 01:31:04,005
I'm too tough to die.

1119
01:31:04,109 --> 01:31:05,465
I ain't hearing too well, though.

1120
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:06,715
That's nasty, ain't it?

1121
01:31:06,819 --> 01:31:09,114
Look, man, it was 10...

1122
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:10,817
Well, it was two guys, right?

1123
01:31:10,922 --> 01:31:12,416
I took 'em on, you know?

1124
01:31:12,521 --> 01:31:13,250
And I was fighting them, but
Garrett caught me from behind...

1125
01:31:13,354 --> 01:31:14,397
Mac, Mac, Mac...

1126
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:16,065
He had me chained to a chair, man.

1127
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:17,074
He had a knife.

1128
01:31:17,178 --> 01:31:18,950
It was a... it was a machete.

1129
01:31:19,054 --> 01:31:21,765
And he was cutting
like this, and he...

1130
01:31:21,869 --> 01:31:23,712
I moved, and he cut my ear off.

1131
01:31:23,816 --> 01:31:26,145
And... I kept
fighting 'em, though.

1132
01:31:26,249 --> 01:31:28,334
And... is that your wife, man?

1133
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:30,439
She looks pretty good.
