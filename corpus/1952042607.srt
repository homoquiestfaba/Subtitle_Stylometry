- Mmm-hmm.

506
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,720
There is a soul trapped in
agony out there right now.

507
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,087
Oh, no!

508
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,852
Oh, I don't care.
It's happened before, innit?

509
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,863
Not like this.
Not when Rube was in charge.

510
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,367
Fuck Rube. Fuck Rube.
It's not my bloody problem.

511
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,993
Seriously, I don't care.

512
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,935
(SIGHING) Where's Roxy?

513
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,700
(CHUCKLING) You know
what is my problem, though?

514
00:27:55,774 --> 00:28:00,507
I really need some Viagra in, like,
an IV thing that goes in your arm.

515
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,102
MASON: Yeah. I love you.

516
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,616
- You don't look so hot.
- I got boned with bad reap info.

517
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:09,250
That shit don't float in my bowl.

518
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,954
- What did Cameron say?
- I haven't found him yet.

519
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:13,856
Follow me.

520
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,757
Cameron! George needs some answers.

521
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,729
Ah, Roxy. Just who I was looking for.

522
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,232
Have you said hello to
Police Commissioner Cusek?

523
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,133
Commissioner, it's
an honor and a privilege.

524
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,602
Pleasure's all mine, Officer.

525
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,162
I was just telling the Commissioner
here that there aren't enough

526
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,266
African-American ranking
officers in the police force.

527
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,903
Now, maybe it's time
for a promotion, hmm?

528
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,278
I don't want any affirmative
action quota bullshit.

529
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:41,750
(LAUGHING) Well, then,
how about a drink?

530
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,517
Love to.

531
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,325
(WHISPERING) See you later.

532
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,732
Ah, so glad you could make it.
I was getting worried about you.

533
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,394
You should be worried.
You gave me the wrong reap time.

534
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,267
Easy, princess.

535
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:03,298
What happened?

536
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,501
The Treo said 5:52.

537
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:09,411
I was there early, but H. Hart
had already been hit by the car

538
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,278
and taken away to the hospital.

539
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,681
So he was in the ambulance at 5:52.

540
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,721
- Long gone.
- Then he was DOA.

541
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,417
But I didn't even touch him.
Not even close.

542
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,153
Then I suggest

543
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,824
you go to the hospital

544
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,428
and make sure your boy is dead.

545
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:37,635
Take care of business, princess,
and go reap his soul.

546

- I'm looking for Hudson.

549
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,213
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

550
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,340
His parents can't
even see him right now.

551
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,781
You'll have to wait
with everyone else.

552
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,682
No, I just need to see his body.

553
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,379
To say goodbye?

554
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,487
(CHUCKLING) Don't
rush him to heaven, honey.

555
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:27,855
He's still hanging in there.

556
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,757
(STAMMERING) He is?

557
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,428
Must have been
touched by an angel.

558
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,166
The waiting area
is around the corner.

559
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,328
- This way.
- Thanks.

This can't be happening.

561
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:47,640
I just spoke to him this morning.

562
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,806
WOMAN: I can't believe
we're here now.

563
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:54,809
I don't want Hudson to die.

564

(CRYING)

565
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,474
Doctor, is my father gonna be okay?

566
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,001
I hope so.

567
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,306
Good. Here's a picture
to put on your fridge.

568
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:30,618
Thank you.

569
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,020
There's the ship,
there's the plane,

570
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,922
and there's a fast, fast bike.

571
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,555
Are you planning your getaway?

572
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,494
I like to go very fast.

00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,355
Oh.

Wow!

581
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:23,468
- George, you have talent.
- I know. It's me there.

582
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,001
Well, where you heading, sweetheart?

583
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:29,740
- On a secret voyage.
- Who are those people?

584
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,010
A secret.

00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:37,946
Fine, then. It's you and Mom.
You're drifting out to sea.

586

I'm not sure why I'm
taking this personally,

587
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,051
but why are Reggie
and I drifting out to sea?

588
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,730
You were kicked off the boat.

00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,736
Better luck next life.

Those are the words you're
gonna leave your little sister with?
