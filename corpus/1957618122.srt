1
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,937
(epic orchestral music)

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:14,180
- [Narrator] As technology
expands, the world shrinks.

3
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,950
As the population
explosion continues,

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,519
contact among humans increases.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,591
Disease carrying viruses
rapidly expand their boundaries.

6
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,896
Killer insects are
not far behind.

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,267
In South America and Africa,
there live ants so deadly

8
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,102
in a matter of hours
they can devour

9
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,671
an entire elephant to the bone.

10
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,043
This is not science fiction.

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,744
This is science fact.

12
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,281
The story you are about to see

13
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,083
could happen tomorrow.

14
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:58,191
(dramatic instrumental music)

15
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,581
(dirt bike revving)

16
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,409
- Oh, I'm cold Glenny.

17
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,677
Come on, it's our honeymoon.

18
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,278
We're supposed to
spend it in bed.

19
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,580
- I know.

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,547
Just let me finish
up this one roll.

21
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,049
- No.

22
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:00,086
- I just want to capture
you in this fabulous light.

23
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,022
You will be rewarded for this.

24
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,625
- Ah, I like the sound of that.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,461
I love you.

26
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:20,440
Honey, how much further?
- Just up this way.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,909
Honey, look at that!

28
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,511
That's fantastic.

29
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,012
- What is it?

30
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,614
- I don't know, but look at
the way the afternoon sun

31
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,449
hits the top of that.

32
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,283
- Oh, no.

33
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,551
No, no, no.

34
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,519
You don't want us
to climb up there.

35
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:33,786
I'm not going up there.

36
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,021
- That light will look
so good in your hair.

37
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,023
- No, sweetie, no.
- Come on, come on!

38
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:40,193
- Please, I don't
want to go up there.

39
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,930
- Come on, honey.

40
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,899
It'll just take a minute.

41
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,301
Be careful.
- It's disgusting.

42
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,987
(camera shutter clicks)

43
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,357
- Damn!

44
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,358
End of the roll.

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,193
- Oh, great.

46
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,394
Let's go back.

47
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,095
- No, honey just
one more roll, okay?

48
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:16,930
- No!

49
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,164
No, I want to go back.

50
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,365
- It'll be a magazine cover.

51
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,466
Just hold on.

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,104
- [Wife] Oh, boy.

53
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,114
(screaming) Oh, God!

54
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,016
Help me!
(Glenn yells)

55
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,952
Help me, oh God!

56
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,522
(screaming) Glenn!

57
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,157
Oh my God!

58
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,491
Help me Glenn!

59
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,326
Help me!

60
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,729
Hurry!

61
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,799
- Hold on!

62
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,405
(screaming)

63
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,260
(sighs)

64
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,728
- That's it, lady.

65
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,665
Take what you want and then
just throw us guys away.

66
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:34,307
You know, I'm gonna put an
ad in the personals for you.

67
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,308
Young widow.

68
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,578
Eager to mate.

69
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:42,682
You won't be my first love
but I'll be your last.

70
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,788
(door creaks)

71
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,722
Oh, hey.

72
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,923
How are we doing for time?

73
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:52,325
- You're never gonna
make it, Doctor Conrad.

74
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,093
- We will if you let
me drive your car.

75
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:54,927
- No.

76
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:56,162
No, absolutely not.

77
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,497
I've only had the
car for a week.

78
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,998
- Okay, look.

79
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,166
Take good care of Hillary,
I think she's pregnant.

80
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,701
- Congratulations.

81
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:04,370
Okay, here is the key
to your apartment.

82
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,204
- Oh, great.

83
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,706
- I watered your plants.

84
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:09,942
Here is your plane ticket
and your bag's in my trunk.

85
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,444
- Okay, look.

86
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:12,945
If Doctor Pickerall calls,
what are you gonna tell him?

87
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,580
- He'll have your report on
the rover beetle by the tenth.

88
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,115
- Great, Bob Wright calls?

89
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,451
- You decided not to sell
the beach house after all.

90
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,853
- And if Danielle calls?

91
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,789
- You died in a freak
lawn chair accident.

92
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,390
- Did I suffer?

93
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,658
- You are absolutely
not gonna make

94
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,193
the plane, Doctor Conrad.

95
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,494
- Come on, car keys.

96
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,429
- No!

97
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,597
- I'm gonna miss my plane.

98
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,202
- Thank you.

99
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,204
- Be careful.

100
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:44,610
(plane engine revving)

101
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,388
- [Jim] Hey, Bob!

102
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,123
How's it going?
- Great!

103
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,157
So how come you're
three years late

104
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,892
for our big fishing trip?

105
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,160
- Hey, I'm in bugs, man.

106
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,096
Our busy season is
12 months a year.

107
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,164
Now tell me about this
secret new spot of yours

108
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,467
where the salmon will jump
right on to our lines.

109
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,136
- Lake Winaka, just
outside Burly Pines.

110
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,038
Nobody's there
this time of year.

111
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,473
- Sounds perfect.

112
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,642
(helicopter whirring)

113
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,519
You're one lucky guy, Bob,

114
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,287
getting to do this every day.

115
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,056
- Yeah, pretty lucky.

116
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,258
Except for a bill from
the IRS for back taxes

117
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,994
and an ex-wife
who hates my guts.

118
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,732
- Hey, that volcano
looks active.

119
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,100
- Mount Umpachi?

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,103
Nah, she just burps
once in a while.

121
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,808
- So why does
anyone live up here?

122
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,245
- There's a lot of jobs
building the new dam.

123
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,280
And it doesn't get
dark until midnight.

124
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,616
You can fish 18 hours a day.

125
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,904
Come take a look at this.

126
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,342
My secret fishing area is
too dense to land any closer

127
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,911
but the hike's worth it.

128
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,946
- [Jim] Oh man, this is awesome!

129
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,080
- Bug spray?

130
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,315
- No thanks.

131
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,684
Never met a bug I didn't like.

132
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,019
- Suit yourself.

133
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,469
- Fish will jump
right on to our lines.

134
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,270
Where are they?

135
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,639
- I'm telling ya, two weeks
ago there were so many salmon

136
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,342
in here you could
practically walk on them.

137
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,111
- Yeah, well I think
they swam for the border.

138
00:07:59,111 --> 00:07:59,946
- Here.

139
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:01,981
Make it last.

140
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,351
- Maybe we just need
to try different flies.

141
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,553
- Tell you what, in the
morning you tie the new flies,

142
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,822
I'm gonna go get some food.

143
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,363
Oh man, I forgot how
much I love Alaska!

144
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,465
- Yeah, well don't wait
three years to come back.

145
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,733
Life's too short to
work all the time.

146
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,034
- Yeah.
- Hold it.

147
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,369
- What is it?

148
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,638
- Looks like a moose.

149
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,139
He must be asleep.

150
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,109
- Woah, woah, you're
not gonna shoot him!

151
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,878
- Not if I don't have to.

152
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,912
But we might need
to scare him off

153
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,147
if he decides to charge us.

154
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,393
- Wolves?

155
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,463
- And mountain
lions and buzzards

156
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,767
and looks like everything
had a go at the big guy.

157
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,935
- [Hunter] Hey!

158
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,403
- That's our moose!

159
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:58,604
- Then why'd you leave
him for scavengers

160
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,406
to feed on for a week?

161
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,242
- Like hell we did.

162
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:06,579
I'll be damned.

163
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,081
(eerie music)

164
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,319
- That's my arrow.

165
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,854
We've been tracking him.

166
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,857
- We wounded him
like two hours ago.

167
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,417
(helicopter whirring)

168
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,629
(dog barking)

169
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,519
- Murdock's dog.

170
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,555
Hey, Blue.

171
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,628
It should be open by now.

172
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,029
- Good boy, good boy.

173
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,430
(knocking)

174
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,698
- Hey, Murdock!

175
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,136
Something's not right.

176
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,773
What the hell?

177
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:43,242
(eerie music)

178
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,031
- Bob.

179
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:05,865
Look.

180
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,872
- Jeez, is that blood?

181
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,537
First a moose,

182
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:46,305
now a man?

183
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,475
What's loose up here?

184
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,405
- Where is he?
- Inside.

185
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,174
Damnedest thing you ever saw.

186
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,909
- Jim Conrad.
- Chief of Police Croy.

187
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,644
This is Officer Blount.

188
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,046
- How's it going?

189
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,722
- So what do you think, Jim?

190
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,891
One of those flesh
eating viruses?

191
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,893
- What are you asking him for?

192
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,829
- He's a scientist
from Los Angeles.

193
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,030
(knocking)

194
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,865
- [Woman] Hello?

195
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,699
Mister Murdock?

196
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:47,533
- Laura?

197
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,406
- Sheriff Croy?
- I'm sorry, Laura.

198
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,509
It's just not a good time
for you to be here right now.

199
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,343
- Why?

200
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,177
What's going on?

201
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,346
- Trent Murdock's dead.

202
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,047
- What happened?

203
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,282
- I don't know.

204
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,517
I'm just starting to
investigate right now.

205
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,986
I don't want people
wandering in here.

206
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,120
Blount.

207
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,954
- Sure.

208
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
- [Jeff] What did
you need, Laura?

209
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,527
- Mister Murdock
had some fish for me

210
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,895
for my class to dissect tomorrow

211
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,930
but obviously that's
not important now.

212
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,064
- I'll have somebody
to bring them over

213
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:19,965
later on tonight.

214
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,200
- Oh, okay.

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,268
Thank you, Chief.

216
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,102
- You bet.

217
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,105
- Bye, Bob.

218
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:28,607
Bye.

219
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,342
- Oh, uh, Jim Conrad.

220
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,879
- Yeah, you look so familiar.

221
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,249
- He writes books that
nobody can understand.

222
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,517
- James Conrad.

223
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,421
Are you the entomologist?

224
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,656
- Guilty.

225
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,124
- Yes, I knew I'd
seen your face.

226
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,393
Your picture's on the
back of the Unseen World.

227
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,728
It's not very good.

228
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,231
- Oh well, it got some
pretty good reviews.

229
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,300
- Oh no, I meant the picture.

230
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,634
I loved the book.

231
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,902
In fact, I bought a second copy

232
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,204
for the school library.

233
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,905
- Oh, well you just
doubled my sales.

234
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,673
Thanks.

235
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,210
- Laura, I'm sorry but things
are kinda hectic right now.

236
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,644
- Absolutely.

237
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:06,645
Just let me know if
there's anything I can do.

238
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,047
- You bet.
- Bye.

239
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,765
- Been a strange 24 hours.

240
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,334
What's going on up here?

241
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:29,168
- You tell me.

242
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,903
Ain't you the scientist?

243
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,538
- Entomologist.

244
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,541
We know just enough to
know how little we know.

245
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,043
Like, what could reduce
a man to a skeleton

246
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,512
without removing his clothes?

247
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:44,016
Or what could strip a
moose clean in two hours?

248
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:46,151
And what drove the salmon away?

249
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,353
- Thanks for your interest

250
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,589
but I think we can
handle this ourselves.

251
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,104
- Gray Wolf.

252
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,907
- I want to see my brother.

253
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,409
(tense music)

254
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,192
- I don't know how to
prepare you for this.

255
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,694
- Just let me see.

256
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,377
What did this to my brother?

257
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,214
- I don't know,
some kind of animal.

258
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:53,419
- Show me the animal that
tears a man's flesh to the bone

259
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,454
and puts his clothes back on.

260
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,922
- When we found him
covered in the back room

261
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,526
it looked like he had been
trying to fight something off.

262
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:01,794
Conrad, don't touch anything.

263
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,896
The coroner won't be
here 'til tomorrow.

264
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:04,730
- Sorry.

265
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,068
Gray Wolf, I'm gonna ask
you not to tell anybody

266
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:13,138
what you've seen here until we
can figure out what happened.

267
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,210
- I'd like to be
alone with my brother.

268
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,859
(gasps)

269
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,927
- What is it?

270
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,928
- Ants.

271
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,997
- Get away from there!

272
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,164
- [Female Officer]
They're just ants.

273
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,899
I'll get rid of them.

274
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,903
- What are you doing?

275
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,739
- Moving them outside.

276
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,808
- Stand back.
- What are you doing?

277
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,777
- Disinfectant.

278
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,245
I like 'em to suffer.

279
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,416
- Well, you're disgusting.
(Blount chuckles)

280
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,957
- Let me know when I
can come and get him.

281
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,791
- I will.

282
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,566
(rumbling)

283
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:15,901
- Oh, dear lord.

284
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,006
- Okay, that wasn't so bad.

285
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,975
- They are definitely
happening more often.

286
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,809
- What?

287
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,711
Did I miss something?

288
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,645
- He's from LA.

289
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,547
(chuckling)

290
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,984
Hey, I'm gonna go
check on my helicopter.

291
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,189
- Sheriff, I'd like
to run some tests.

292
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,658
Is there any place I
can stay here tonight?

293
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,928
- I think I can come
up with something.

294
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,539
We're going to
Zach Henry's cabin.

295
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,541
He only comes up from Seattle
during the hunting season.

296
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,809
Place is stocked with food

297
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,478
if you know how to
use a can opener.

298
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,747
- [Jim] Thanks a lot, Chief.

299
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:04,883
- I brought you a
new neighbor, Laura.

300
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,385
- [Jim] Howdy, neighbor.

301
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,386
- Hi Doctor Conrad.

302
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,788
- Oh please, call me Jim.

303
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:10,622
- Jim.

304
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,494
- I'll pick you up first
thing in the morning.

305
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:19,731
- Bye Laura.

306
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:20,732
- Bye Chief.

307
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,439
- Man, I need a hot shower.

308
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,273
- Oh, I'm sorry.

309
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,108
There's no hot water.

310
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,709
I just did my laundry.

311
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,379
- That's okay, cold
showers build character.

312
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,620
I think I'm gonna like it here.

313
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,127
(knocking)

314
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,798
Just a second!

315
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,007
- Hi.
- Hi.

316
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,776
- Hi.

317
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,646
I thought you could
use a hot meal.

318
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,583
We dress for dinner.

319
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:14,219
- Thanks.

320
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,993
So how long has Croy
been chief of police?

321
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,928
- For as long as
I've lived here.

322
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,163
He's a real rarity.

323
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,931
Smart and honest cop.

324
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,602
Poor guy, his wife
died a few months ago.

325
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:36,308
- Well, looks like you're
pretty good at something.

326
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:37,843
- Marksmanship.

327
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,112
My father taught me to
shoot when I was 12.

328
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:40,946
- [Jim] Wow.

329
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,147
He was a hunter?

330
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,415
- No. (chuckles)

331
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:46,585
He was a New York
City police captain.

332
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,089
- So how did a big
city girl like you

333
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,560
come to live in a
small town in Alaska?

334
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,229
- She got tired of big city men.

335
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,099
(chuckles)

336
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,402
- Did I mention that Los Angeles

337
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,972
is really just a
collection of small towns?

338
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:13,845
- What's a famous entomologist
doing in Burly Pines?

339
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,048
- Oh, I've known Bob
Hazzard since college

340
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,985
and I really needed to get
out of Los Angeles for a while

341
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,988
so I came up for
the salmon fishing.

342
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:29,061
- Tell me what happened
to Trent Murdock.

343
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,564
- Well, if we were
in a warmer place

344
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,067
I'd be a lot more sure
of what killed Murdock

345
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,837
but right now the only
explanation I can come up with

346
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:42,975
is impossible because the
ground up here is too cold.

347
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,544
- Really?

348
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,316
There's something
I'd like to show you.

349
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,918
Come on.

350
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,453
It's at the school.

351
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,090
The science project
we've been keeping track

352
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,424
of the accelerated earthquake

353
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,427
and geothermal
activity in the area.

354
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,197
But the most fascinating
thing we've discovered

355
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,065
is the underground
temperature change.

356
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:07,899
- Temperature change?

357
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,301
- Yeah.

358
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,503
Mount Umpachi has been
dormant for nearly 2000 years

359
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,272
but lately the
local sulfur springs

360
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,274
have increased in size
and the earthquakes

361
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,808
have become more frequent.

362
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,176
- So the volcano woke up.

363
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:19,745
- Yeah.

364
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,413
- Hey, have you
got a clean side?

365
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,247
- Sure.

366
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:26,885
- Thanks.

367
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,353
- What is it for?

368
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,023
- I want to look at something
I found on Mister Murdock.

369
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,190
Please, go on.

370
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,727
- Well we've been using a
thermo coupler in the ground

371
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,229
and the Anchorage
seismic laboratory

372
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,898
agrees with our findings
that the temperatures

373
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:44,136
and the geothermal activity
are steadily increasing.

374
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,071
So the ground beneath
the town is warming up.

375
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,039
- [Laura] Exactly.

376
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,707
It's like the tropics down there

377
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:52,577
and that's probably what
drove the salmon away.

378
00:21:55,847 --> 00:22:00,552
- I'm afraid we've got a bigger
problem than missing fish.

379
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,520
Take a look.

380
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,727
(eerie music)

381
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:32,517
(tense instrumental music)

382
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,567
- [Jeff] Chad,
breakfast is ready.

383
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,868
- [Chad] Coming!

384
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,243
- There you go.

385
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,212
- Way to go, Dad!

386
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,480
Eggs that look eatable.

387
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,314
- Edible.

388
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,584
(toast crunches)

389
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:06,685
Yeah, I know.

390
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:09,888
You want me to make some more?

391
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,157
- Nah, I like it like this.

392
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,699
- We're doing okay, aren't we?

393
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,968
- Mom would be proud of us.

394
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,904
- Yeah.

395
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,478
Listen, how 'bout we do
something fun this weekend?

396
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,981
- Hey, let's go
rock climbing again!

397
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,849
- Alright, Saturday morning.

398
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,317
Put the ropes and the
harnesses in the four by four

399
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,886
so we don't forget 'em, okay?

400
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:44,489
- You sure you're
up for it, old man?

401
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,024
- I'll carry you home.

402
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,160
(laughs)

403
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,495
What are you laughing about?

404
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,450
- In early January of 1994,

405
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,653
scientists found that many
areas of the western coastline

406
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:18,457
were rising nearly 10
tens faster than normal.

407
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,359
Can anyone tell me
what this means?

408
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,663
Patrick?

409
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,833
- What was the question?

410
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,070
- Chad.

411
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,141
- The rising indicates that
pressure's building underground.

412
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,275
- That's right.

413
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,844
A sign of an
imminent earthquake.

414
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,345
We know that bec--

415
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,782
- Sorry I'm late Miss Sills.

416
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,917
I was helping my
brother with a case.

417
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,752
- I don't think you're ready
to join the force just yet

418
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,621
Scott so why don't
you help Deputy Blount

419
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,490
by following the rules?

420
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,892
Class starts at
eight o'clock sharp.

421
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,327
- Yes Miss Sills.

422
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:01,500
- [Laura] So, look on page 205--

423
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,001
- Chad.

424
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,436
Look, I found the coolest thing.

425
00:25:04,436 --> 00:25:06,605
- What, a camera?

426
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:07,739
- No, dork.

427
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,908
I'll show it to you later.

428
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:15,580
- Okay, we're used to the
normal garden type ants

429
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,349
like the kind found
in your cupboard.

430
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,817
Now they've been around
for somewhere between

431
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,619
50 and 100 million years.

432
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,887
But there's somewhere between 12

433
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,990
and 15000 different
species of ants.

434
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,658
- What's your point?

435
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,030
- Reminds of my
ex sister-in-law.

436
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,331
Big and ugly.

437
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,165
What is it?

438
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,100
- That's a soldier ant.

439
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,601
Marabunta.

440
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:38,670
Every 12 to 15 years they
emerge from deep within

441
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,172
the earth's surface and
they go on killing raids.

442
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,842
They're native to South America.

443
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,144
The queen is twice as large,
can fly and she can lay

444
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:48,914
up to 100,000 eggs
every 20 days.

445
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,684
Okay, these are soldier
ants forming one living

446
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,586
creature spanning an
area of 10 miles long

447
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,254
by three miles wide.

448
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,358
That picture was taken
in Brazil in 1959

449
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,460
when they ate every living
thing in their path.

450
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,395
- Alright, but that's Brazil.

451
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,829
This is Alaska.

452
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,298
- Right, but that volcano
has warmed the earth

453
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,199
below the surface, creating
the perfect environment

454
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,734
for these killers.

455
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,804
- So you think that's what
ate the moose and Murdock?

456
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,272
- Look.

457
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,740
They can strip an 800
pound moose in two hours.

458
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,076
200 pound man in 30 minutes.

459
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,445
- What's that?

460
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:21,947
- That's their ant hill.

461
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,916
Roughly 15 feet high by 20
feet across at the base.

462
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,619
Oh, and after a battle
they carry away their dead.

463
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,423
Now I found an ant body part
in Mister Murdock's remains.

464
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,858
I know the ants
are in Burly Pines.

465
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,228
I just can't figure
out how they got here.

466
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,231
- [Radio] Chief
Croy, come in Chief.

467
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,103
- What is it, Blount?

468
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,338
- [Radio] I called Margie to see

469
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,806
if she wanted a
ride this morning

470
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,809
but the operator said her
phone is off the hook.

471
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,477
- I'll check it out.

472
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,458
(eerie music)

473
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,626
(knocking)

474
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,460
Margie?

475
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,265
Margie?

476
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,206
Margie?

477
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:01,413
Conrad.

478
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,419
- Oh my God.

479
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,045
(kids cheering)

480
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,191
- You know, with all this
extra credit research

481
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,892
you're gonna be on the
honor roll this month.

482
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,061
- Great, Dad'll like that.

483
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,365
- Hey snot nose, come on.

484
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,935
- Scott Blount, don't
use words like snot nose.

485
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,336
- Yes Miss Sills.

486
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,404
Come on Chad.

487
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:01,906
Come on.

488
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,341
- Go on.

489
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,843
You're not gonna have another
short day 'til November.

490
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:05,677
- Okay.

491
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,746
Bye Miss Sills.

492
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,580
- Bye.

493
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,149
- Come on, let's go.

494
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,617
Bye Miss Sills.

495
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,651
I love you.

496
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,186
I'd love to kiss
you, Miss Sills.

497
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:16,955
- Shut up, Scott.

498
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,556
- Come on wimp, I'll race ya.

499
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,627
(adventurous instrumental music)

500
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,887
- This is all you
wanted to show me?

501
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,121
- No, dork.

502
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,257
It's over there where
I scored the camera.

503
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:54,092
Come on, I'll show ya.

504
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,967
(eerie music)

505
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,769
Ain't that something?

506
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,371
- [Chad] What do
you think it is?

507
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,572
- Mine, I found it.

508
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,707
I'm gonna name it after me.

509
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,443
Mount Blount.
(laughs)

510
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,812
First one up is king
of the mountain.

511
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,646
- Cheater!

512
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,123
- King, king!

513
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,057
I win.

514
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,559
- Yeah, but you started first.

515
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,060
- Still king.

516
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,461
- This is too weird, Scott.

517
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,963
We should tell my dad.

518
00:30:31,963 --> 00:30:33,298
- You're chicken.

519
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,034
(mimics chicken clucking)

520
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:37,168
- Such a jerk.

521
00:30:38,636 --> 00:30:40,471
- Where are you going?

522
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,539
Come on.

523
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,473
Come on, stay up here.

524
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,408
Come on.

525
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,676
Gosh dang it.

526
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,910
Hey, I'm king!

527
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,878
Ha ha!

528
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:47,879
I win!

529
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:48,947
You lose!

530
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,782
Me, Mount Blount here!

531
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,450
- Shut up, Scott.

532
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,385
- I win, I'm king.

533
00:30:54,385 --> 00:30:56,287
(mimics chicken
clucking) Chicken!

534
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,422
Chi--
(screaming)

535
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,157
Help, I'm sinking!

536
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,491
Chad, help!

537
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,893
- Hang on!

538
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:03,962
- Help!
- Hang on, Scott!

539
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,530
Give me your hand!

540
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,600
- Something's biting me!
(screaming)

541
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,434
- Scott!

542
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:10,468
Pull up!

543
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,502
Scott!

544
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,004
Scott!

545
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:14,172
Scott!
- Help!

546
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,689
- What's with Margie?

547
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,224
- Is everything okay?

548
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,058
- Nothing's okay.

549
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,226
Margie's dead.

550
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,662
- What are we gonna do?

551
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,564
- I'm calling the
National Guard.

552
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,799
(rumbling)

553
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,607
(glass shatters)

554
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:00,818
- Wow.

555
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,589
- Is everyone okay?
- Yeah.

556
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:13,831
(bashes phone)
(groans)

557
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:14,832
- It's dead.

558
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,337
- Whew!

559
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,373
Maid's day off?

560
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,811
- Why aren't you at the school?

561
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,746
- We got out early.

562
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:30,281
- I gotta find Chad.
- I'll go with you.

563
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,816
- Alright, good.
- He's with Scott.

564
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,384
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

565
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,619
- Hazzard, I want you
to fly to Anchorage

566
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,787
and contact the National Guard.

567
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,654
We need help.

568
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,655
- I'm on it.

569
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,292
- [Laura] What's going on?

570
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,028
- Dad!

571
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,163
- [Jeff] Chad.

572
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,732
- (breathing
heavily) Dad, Scott.

573
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:49,233
He--
- What?

574
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,336
- What happened, son?
- Where's my brother?

575
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,537
- We were in the forest, Dad,

576
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,972
and Scott found a hill.

577
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,506
And he climbed up.

578
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,642
And he started sinking, Dad,
and I tried to help him, Dad,

579
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,476
I really did.

580
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,310
I'm sorry.

581
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,511
We gotta go help Scott.

582
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,312
- Show me!

583
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:04,782
Show me, Chad!
- Come on.

584
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,186
(tense music)

585
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,426
- Come on.

586
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,260
Come on!

587
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,564
You can go faster, come on!

588
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,615
- Chad, just stay with Laura.

589
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,030
Good lord, the ant hill.

590
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,133
- Scott!
- Blount!

591
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,768
- Scott!
- Blount, be careful!

592
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,169
- I'm coming Scott!

593
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,637
I'm coming Scotty!

594
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,678
Scott!
- Blount, stay near the edge!

595
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,180
- Scott, I'm here!

596
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:12,650
Scotty!

597
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,887
Scott, I'm up here boy!

598
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,356
- You won't find anything here.

599
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,824
- Where'd they go?

600
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,626
- The colonies are
massing in the tunnels

601
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,861
preparing for another raid.

602
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,298
- Come on, Blount.

603
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,167
We can't do anything here.

604
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,737
(tense instrumental music)

605
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:57,028
(gun firing)

606
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,828
- Okay, Murdock was
killed first here

607
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,932
and then Margie here
and then Scott here.

608
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,667
Okay, see the pattern?

609
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,902
- No.

610
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,103
- Alright, it's one
systematic device

611
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:40,705
we have learned about marabunta.

612
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,474
See, the colony starts
out on hit raids for food

613
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,277
and they cover ground by
alternating every 30 degrees

614
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,311
until eventually they've covered

615
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,247
every square inch of a circle.

616
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,448
- If what you're
saying is true then--

617
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,716
- Then we're next.

618
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,551
- We've got to
evacuate the town.

619
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,253
- [Jeff] How long do
you think we have?

620
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,922
- Maybe 24 hours, probably less.

621
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,659
Sheriff, where does
your fruit come from?

622
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,593
- I don't know, why?

623
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,861
- Well, I know the answer here,

624
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,164
I just can't figure
out how it happened.

625
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,333
Is there anything here that
shipped from South America?

626
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,369
- I never thought about it.

627
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,472
- Well, what about wood, logs?

628
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:16,307
What are the cabins made out of?

629
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,809
- I think Alaskan pine mostly.

630
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,119
- [Jim] Where did
this come from?

631
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,654
- Scott made it.

632
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:30,488
It's acacia wood.

633
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,923
Where did he get it?

634
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:33,791
- I think Rocky
Point beach, I think.

635
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,026
There's some logs
there that washed up

636
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,195
from a freighter that
sank about 10 years ago.

637
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,965
- Could that freighter have
come from South America?

638
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,266
- Now that you mention
it, I think it did.

639
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,701
It was headed for Japan
and headed up to the bay

640
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,169
during a bad storm.

641
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,338
- So soldier ants must have
been in the acacia wood

642
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,106
the freighter was carrying.

643
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:52,076
- The queen could have her
home in one of those old logs.

644
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,111
We gotta try and find the
queen and destroy her.

645
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:56,614
See, their communication
system is so sophisticated

646
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,249
I think any direct
threat to the queen

647
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,451
would draw the other
colonies out of Burly Pines.

648
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,455
Then it's just a matter of
systematically wiping them out.

649
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,356
- Hey guys.

650
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:07,358
- Where the hell have you been?

651
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:08,426
Did you get help?

652
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,194
- I have a fuel leak.

653
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:11,229
I'll have it fixed
so she can take off

654
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,830
for Anchorage in an hour.

655
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,098
- Change of plans, Bob.

656
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,367
I need you to take me
to Rocky Point beach.

657
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,835
- Okay.

658
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,604
- Alright, I'll supervise
the evacuation from this end.

659
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:21,505
I want you to keep
in radio contact.

660
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,974
- You bet.

661
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,309
- You're gonna need someone
to watch your back, Jim.

662
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,912
Let me have your snake charmer.

663
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:32,617
- You want to fight
soldier ants with a flute?

664
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,552
- It's a little more
powerful than that.

665
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,220
It's a .410 shotgun.

666
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,825
Give me the magnesium shot.

667
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:42,593
Explosives in effect.

668
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,365
- Incinerate the little suckers.

669
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,933
- Great, most beautiful
woman I've ever met

670
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,668
turns out to be a lethal weapon.

671
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,937
(chuckles)

672
00:37:58,075 --> 00:37:59,076
- You know, you're
one of the few people

673
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,379
the whole town trusts.

674
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,147
- Well, what do
you want me to do?

675
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:06,217
- I want you to
lead the evacuation.

676
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,818
The only safe route out
is through Boulder Pass.

677
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,353
Do you think you can get
everybody over to the other side

678
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:12,023
by four o'clock
tomorrow afternoon?

679
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,858
- Yeah, I can do it.

680
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,860
- Alright, if Conrad hasn't
signaled us that he's wiped out

681
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,330
the ants by four o'clock
we're gonna blow the pass.

682
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,065
(sighs)

683
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,200
- If you blow the pass that's
not gonna kill the ants.

684
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,702
- I know.

685
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,936
I know, but at least we'll
contain 'em long enough

686
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,371
to get the military
in here with chemicals

687
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,040
or flamethrowers or
whatever the hell it takes

688
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,875
to wipe 'em out.

689
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:32,910
You must have some
dynamite left over

690
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,179
from clearing the
road at the dam.

691
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,914
- [Gray Wolf] Enough.

692
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,750
- There's one more.

693
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,519
I want you to take Chad with ya.

694
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,987
- Sure.
- No.

695
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,990
Dad, I want to stay with you.

696
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,824
- Thanks.

697
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,498
Listen son, the best way that
you can help me right now

698
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,967
is by going with Gray Wolf.

699
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,102
- Okay.
- Alright?

700
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:58,936
- Yeah.

701
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,675
(flame thrower bursts)

702
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,876
- Homemade flame thrower.

703
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:09,814
You're not just another
pretty face, Conrad.

704
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,817
Now, you've done
this before, right?

705
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:16,520
(flame thrower bursts)

706
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,023
(tense music)

707
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,685
(helicopter buzzing)

708
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,924
- Keep your eyes peeled.

709
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,227
These ants can smell
a new food source.

710
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:37,461
Us.

711
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,063
- Yeah, well I'll wait
right here, thanks.

712
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,531
- Okay, keep this
thing revved up.

713
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:41,832
We may need to get off quick.

714
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,334
- Okay.
- Let's go!

715
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,978
(eerie music)

716
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,906
Ant eggs and larvae.

717
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:24,508
- It looks like you were right.

718
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:58,809
Sorry.

719
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,480
- It's okay, it's okay.

720
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,615
My heart will come
down out of my throat

721
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,849
any minute now.

722
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,680
I guess there's no queen.

723
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,417
- Maybe she floated
out with the tide.

724
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,020
She could be miles away by now.

725
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,695
- Well, she could've left
a forwarding address.

726
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,964
- What do we do now?

727
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,133
- Think of something else.

728
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,949
(screaming)

729
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:32,703
- What's going on?

730
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,537
- Bob!

731
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,008
- He's out of control!

732
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,344
(screaming)

733
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,995
Oh my God.

734
00:44:57,995 --> 00:44:58,829
Oh.

735
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,701
(screaming)

736
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,272
(explosion rumbles)

737
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,315
Jim.

738
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,550
Jim!

739
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,286
(dramatic music)

740
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,762
- Open the valve!

741
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:35,699
- Okay, it's open.
- Okay.

742
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,768
- Light it!
- I'm trying!

743
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,994
(shotgun blasts)

744
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,599
- [Laura] Jim, over here!

745
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:27,718
(shotgun blasts)

746
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,855
- I'm losing pressure!

747
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:38,028
Pump faster!

748
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:40,264
- I'm trying!

749
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,305
(screaming)

750
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,853
We just can't stop them, Jim!

751
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:04,621
- Keep trying, Laura!

752
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,798
(shotgun blasts)

753
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:32,049
(shotgun fires)

754
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:44,695
(shotgun blasts)

755
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,632
- Jim!

756
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:49,900
Jim, what is that over there?

757
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,101
- What?

758
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,703
- Over there!

759
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,503
- A canoe!

760
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,507
- There's just no
way to get there!

761
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,076
- Open up my valve.

762
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,319
- Alright, it's open.

763
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:22,866
- Come on.

764
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:24,968
Alright, ready?

765
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,403
Let's run!
- Okay!

766
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,691
- You take the bow!
- Okay!

767
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,394
- Pull it out!

768
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,151
You got a destination in mind?

769
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,954
- I think we'll follow the
coastline down around that bluff

770
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,356
then we'll have to hike
inland about two miles.

771
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:22,092
There's a river that'll
take us down to Shady Lake.

772
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,127
- [Jim] Are there any
rapids on this river?

773
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,696
- [Laura] I've
never been down it.

774
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:27,264
I'm sure there's
some white water

775
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,900
but nothing we can't handle.

776
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,801
- Watch it!

777
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,640
(screams)

778
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,856
- [Laura] Hold on!

779
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,677
(yells)

780
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,217
(screams)

781
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:24,821
- Hold on!

782
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,510
Are you okay?

783
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,216
- Man-eating ants
in front of us.

784
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:27,617
A waterfall below us.

785
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,618
Define okay.

786
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:30,987
- The ability to keep your head

787
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:34,558
while everyone about
you is losing theirs.

788
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,128
- Then you obviously don't
know the trouble you're in.

789
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:38,962
- Come on!

790
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:55,812
- Hazzard, this is Croy.

791
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:56,613
Come in.

792
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:58,982
Hazzard, come in.

793
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:00,016
This is Croy.

794
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,285
Son, what is it?

795
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,555
- Gray Wolf wants me to
tell you that Mister Perth

796
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:06,890
won't leave his farm.

797
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,558
- I coulda told you
he wouldn't leave.

798
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,093
His wife's buried out there.

799
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,461
You want me to go get him?

800
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,395
- Yeah, thanks.

801
00:52:12,395 --> 00:52:14,464
Hog tie him if you have to.

802
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,366
Chad, why did you
come back here?

803
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,235
- Gray Wolf couldn't
hold me back, Dad.

804
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,737
You know you're gonna need me.

805
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:25,375
- Alright.

806
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,311
Hazzard, come in.

807
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,147
This is Croy.

808
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,548
Hazzard, come in.

809
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,794
- Hey (mumbles).

810
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:48,031
I bet you never thought
you'd miss New York.

811
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,100
(laughs)

812
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:55,939
- What are you looking for?

813
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,009
- This.

814
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,077
- A scarab?

815
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,012
- Yeah.

816
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,947
It's ancient Egyptian.

817
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:07,250
It symbolizes the
enduring human soul.

818
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,518
My lucky charm.

819
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,454
- Well.

820
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:14,524
Hasn't done us much
good lately, huh?

821
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,330
Our chances of getting
out of this alive

822
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,766
aren't very good, are they?

823
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,368
- I think if we work together

824
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,872
our odds of survival
are greatly enhanced.

825
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,201
- What are you
doing here, Blount?

826
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,035
- Sheriff's orders.

827
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:00,503
You gotta come with me.

828
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:01,938
- If you think I'm gonna
leave because some stranger

829
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,640
from Los Angeles says so,

830
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,208
you're a bigger fool
than I thought you were.

831
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,444
- The ants killed Scott
and Margie and Murdock.

832
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,778
Do you want to get eaten alive?

833
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,080
- I got a plan.

834
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,648
- Don't make arrest
you, Maynerd.

835
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:14,951
- Them wholes opened
up last night.

836
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:18,121
Poured gasoline and
turpentine in 'em.

837
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:23,560
That doesn't kill the bastards
I'll toss in some matches.

838
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,228
- And blow us all to Hell?

839
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,763
I'm calling Croy.

840
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,665
- [Maynerd] You
can't make me go!

841
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:30,834
- Blout to Croy, Blout to Croy.

842
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,836
Chief, I need your help.

843
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,144
Sheriff, he says
he's not coming.

844
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:44,114
10-4, I'll do what I can.

845
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:48,585
What's that smell?

846
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,154
- That's my prize milk cow.

847
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,622
- [Blount] What are
you doing, Maynerd?

848
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,291
- [Maynerd] This'll take
care of the little buggers!

849
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:55,392
- Oh, man.

850
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:57,894
(eerie music)

851
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:09,539
Oh no!

852
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,741
- What the hell Blount!

853
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,411
(frantic music)

854
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,813
Look!

855
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,049
Oh my.

856
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,920
- There's more of
'em right there!

857
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:26,456
Get up the ladder!

858
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:27,924
Come on!

859
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:30,260
(grumbling)

860
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,097
(yells)

861
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,198
- [Maynerd] My back.

862
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:36,566
I can't move.

863
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,735
(moaning)

864
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,342
(yelling)

865
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,312
(screaming)

866
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:57,454
- Maynerd!

867
00:55:57,454 --> 00:55:59,789
(screaming)

868
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,268
- How much time do we have?

869
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:13,136
- About two hours.

870
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,704
Hey, hey!

871
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,072
- It's the bait shop.

872
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,841
- Let's check it out.

873
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,937
Bingo!

874
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:49,205
Laura, in here!

875
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,178
- Come in Blount, this is Croy.

876
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,012
Come in.

877
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:00,250
Blount, where the hell are ya?

878
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,254
Where the hell is anybody?

879
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:07,123
Come in Blount, this is Croy.

880
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:07,957
Come in.

881
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,764
- Please God.

882
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,299
Get me out of this.

883
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:17,801
I'll never ask you for
anything else in my life.

884
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:18,635
I swear.

885
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:23,039
- [Jeff] Blount,
where the hell are ya?

886
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,882
(yells)

887
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,328
- What is it?
- Check it out.

888
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,162
- Oh, wow.

889
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,966
- Tank's dry.

890
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,134
- Let me see.

891
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:51,968
Wait.

892
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,104
Here's a canister.

893
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,140
It's pretty dirty.

894
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,808
Might be pretty old.

895
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,383
- [Blount] Help!

896
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,228
- Let me see the funnel.

897
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:19,062
- Okay.

898
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:24,734
(eerie music)

899
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:40,149
That's all there is.

900
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,020
Oh my God.

901
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,257
Jim.

902
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,197
- Ready?

903
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,031
Run!

904
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,567
- Hurry up!

905
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:59,402
- Run!
- They're coming!

906
00:58:59,402 --> 00:59:00,737
Turn it on!

907
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:02,205
- It's on, get on!

908
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,575
- Go!
- I'm trying!

909
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,409
- Go!

910
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:08,745
Go!
- I'm going!

911
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,116
Alright.

912
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:14,284
Okay, hold on!

913
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:34,370
- Blount!

914
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:36,673
Mister Perth!

915
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:37,740
- Help!

916
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,976
Somebody get me outta here!

917
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,582
Somebody get me outta here!

918
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,685
Help!

919
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:49,919
Help, somebody!

920
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,628
Somebody help!

921
00:59:58,628 --> 00:59:59,462
- Blount!

922
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:00,630
- I'm up here, sir!

923
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,131
Help!

924
01:00:02,131 --> 01:00:02,966
Help!

925
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,336
(yells)

926
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,305
Ah, my leg!

927
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:11,040
I think I broke it.

928
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,910
- Get up, get up, get up!

929
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,245
- [Blount] They're after me!

930
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,924
(engine puttering)

931
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,037
- We couldn't find the queen.

932
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,005
- Where's your Dad?

933
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:43,706
- He's out at the farm.

934
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,408
- Can you reach him?

935
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:47,276
- The quake knocked out
all the phone lines.

936
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,212
But I can use the radio!

937
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:50,046
- Great.

938
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,314
Get in touch with him,

939
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,281
tell him to meet
us at the school.

940
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,616
- Yeah, in the chemistry lab.

941
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:54,417
- Roger.

942
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,263
Dad, this is Chad.

943
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:08,264
Do you copy?

944
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,804
Dad, do you copy?

945
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,374
Dad, this is an emergency.

946
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,978
- [Jeff] What's with gasoline?

947
01:01:21,978 --> 01:01:25,581
- [Blount] Perth poured it down
the holes to kill the ants.

948
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,151
(groans)

949
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,085
- Get in.

950
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:29,919
Get in.

951
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:37,560
(yelling)

952
01:01:40,263 --> 01:01:41,397
Blount, don't use your gun!

953
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,398
The place will blow!

954
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:43,900
(Blount screaming)

955
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,068
Blount!

956
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:49,672
(gun fires)
(explosion thunders)

957
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:52,408
(dramatic music)

958
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:01,217
(explosion booms)

959
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,939
- Hey, how's this?

960
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,474
- Oh, that's great.

961
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,109
- Boy, what is that smell?

962
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,310
Sulfur?

963
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,778
- Yeah, I'm trying
to duplicate the odor

964
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:31,114
of the only creature in the
jungle that soldier ants avoid.

965
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,782
Brockamina Cariosa.

966
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:34,283
The stink bug.

967
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,752
- You're kidding me.

968
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,586
- No kidding.

969
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,020
Strange but true.

970
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,623
- Well how much of
this do we have?

971
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,958
- This is it.

972
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,326
- Will it be enough?

973
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,594
- I don't know.

974
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,865
Come on.

975
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:49,932
Great, got it.

976
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:50,800
Let's go!

977
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,503
(dramatic music)

978
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:08,417
- Stay inside!

979
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,820
They're all around the school!

980
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:18,261
- I'll create a diversion!

981
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,195
- Chad, no!

982
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,600
Chad, behind ya!

983
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,172
(extinguisher blowing)

984
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:30,239
Go to the school bus.

985
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:31,507
The school bus!

986
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,354
- Dad, it won't open!

987
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:50,426
Come on!

988
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,241
Dad!

989
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,075
Dad, help!

990
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:27,263
- What are you doing?

991
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,098
- I'm testing my brew.

992
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,235
(spraying)

993
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,006
- It's working!

994
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:41,477
Wait a minute.

995
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:42,812
What's going on?

996
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:47,183
- They sacrificed themselves.

997
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:49,452
- No!

998
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,292
- Help!

999
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:07,703
- Croy!

1000
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:09,038
We need your help!

1001
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:09,872
- What?

1002
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:11,107
- We need your help!

1003
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,609
- I'm kinda busy down here!

1004
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:17,780
- Open up your tailgate and
pull forward to the flag pole!

1005
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:23,886
- Wait, what are you doing?

1006
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,788
- Here, just take this.

1007
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,131
We're gonna swing down.

1008
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:35,965
- Swing?

1009
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:36,966
What do you mean swing?

1010
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:37,867
- Trust me.

1011
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,101
- Trust you?

1012
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,569
Smart women don't trust
men who say trust me.

1013
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:43,306
- Hey look, when the
alternative is being eaten alive

1014
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,474
you can make an exception.

1015
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:55,785
Okay, here.

1016
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,287
- Is the rope
gonna hold us both?

1017
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,455
- [Jim] In theory.

1018
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:00,690
- What, the theory of relativity

1019
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,526
or the one about the
world being flat?

1020
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,733
- [Jeff] Come on!

1021
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,609
- Dad!

1022
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:25,881
- Come on!

1023
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:27,984
- Okay, you ready?

1024
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,819
- Ah, as I'll ever be.

1025
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,391
(screams)

1026
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:48,337
- Look!

1027
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,141
- Chad!

1028
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:52,975
- Help!

1029
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:53,809
Hurry!

1030
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:54,643
Help!

1031
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:55,478
- Come on!

1032
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:57,546
- Hurry!

1033
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:58,381
Help!

1034
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,951
Get me outta here!

1035
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:03,786
- Chad, open the door!

1036
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:12,194
- It's stuck!

1037
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,165
Hurry up!

1038
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,099
- Get back!

1039
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,340
Chad, be careful!

1040
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:32,615
- Jim!

1041
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,493
Pump it!
(Chad screams)

1042
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:45,327
Over here!

1043
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,558
- There, right there!

1044
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:21,564
(pump fizzing)

1045
01:08:21,564 --> 01:08:22,932
Right there!

1046
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,601
(Laura screams)

1047
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:32,808
Dad!

1048
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,216
Dad!
(tires screeching)

1049
01:08:58,033 --> 01:09:00,736
(engine revving)

1050
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,216
- There's no sign of them.

1051
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,718
They must be dead.

1052
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,255
- How much time do we have?

1053
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,792
- 12 minutes before
the pass blows.

1054
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:26,896
Are you alright?

1055
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,297
- Yeah, I'm okay.

1056
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:30,032
- He's more than okay.

1057
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:32,701
You got a brave young man there.

1058
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:36,839
- I know.

1059
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,609
Where's Hazzard?

1060
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:41,810
- He didn't make it.

1061
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,013
- Damn, neither did Blount.

1062
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,449
- That stuff Mister Conrad
sprayed on 'em, it's amazing.

1063
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,718
- How much do we have left?

1064
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,523
- Less than a quart.

1065
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,631
- I say we blow the pass now.

1066
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:04,600
- Not yet.

1067
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,045
- Look at that.

1068
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:22,084
(eerie music)

1069
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:28,591
(explosion rumbles
in the distance)

1070
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,528
- What was that?

1071
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,096
- They blew the pass early.

1072
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:37,533
- Well they must've
had a good reason.

1073
01:10:37,533 --> 01:10:39,735
- What are we gonna do now?

1074
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:41,971
- Hey, have you got a map?

1075
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:43,606
- Yeah, in the back.

1076
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,494
- Okay, we found the moose here.

1077
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,563
Then Mister Murdock
was killed here.

1078
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,231
And then 30 degrees.

1079
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,467
Margie.

1080
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:13,769
And another 30 degrees.

1081
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:14,970
Scott.

1082
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:15,804
Okay, now.

1083
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,340
Yeah, see after the earthquake

1084
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,176
we found Bob Hazzard right here

1085
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:25,314
and then we found Deputy Blount
and Mister Perth right here.

1086
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:26,515
Okay, Shady Lake.

1087
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:27,750
That's where we found
that other colony

1088
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:31,020
and then another
one at the school.

1089
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:32,454
- My God.

1090
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,523
- So they changed direction
after the earthquake.

1091
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,393
- Yeah, their foraging
pattern shifted 180 degrees.

1092
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,295
- What are we gonna do?

1093
01:11:42,731 --> 01:11:45,200
- What's this gray
area right here?

1094
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,268
- That's the new dam.

1095
01:11:46,268 --> 01:11:48,404
It's not on the map yet.

1096
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,405
- Let's go!

1097
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,372
- Wait a minute.

1098
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:51,640
You're suggesting that we go

1099
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,775
to where the ants
are converging?

1100
01:11:52,775 --> 01:11:53,575
- Yeah.

1101
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,444
- Yeah.

1102
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:58,147
(dramatic music)

1103
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:38,754
- Look.

1104
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:41,490
- What?

1105
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,225
There's Burly Pines,
there's Boulder Pass.

1106
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:47,396
- No, below that, about a
mile down the flood basin.

1107
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,167
- They're coming right at us.

1108
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,770
- There's only thing left to do.

1109
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,604
- What?

1110
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:56,672
What is that?

1111
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,075
- Blow the dam.

1112
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:02,211
- What?

1113
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,345
We can't do that, Jim.

1114
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:04,279
- That's crazy.

1115
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:05,547
You'll flood the entire valley.

1116
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,951
- Look, right now Burly
Pines is a ghost town.

1117
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:10,219
Those ants are headed this way.

1118
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,754
They're gonna be in
Anchorage in a month

1119
01:13:11,754 --> 01:13:13,522
and there will be nothing
left alive in their path.

1120
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,157
- There's gotta be another way.

1121
01:13:15,157 --> 01:13:16,024
- Look out there, will ya?

1122
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,659
There's millions of 'em!

1123
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:18,961
Hundreds of colonies
have hooked up now

1124
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:20,796
and they're heading this way.

1125
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:22,965
That flood basin is the
lowest point in the valley.

1126
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:23,899
I'm telling you,
drowning the ants

1127
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:26,535
is the only way to wipe 'em out.

1128
01:13:29,805 --> 01:13:34,576
- How do we blow up the
damn without explosives?

1129
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:35,878
- Well, I said I had a solution.

1130
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:37,346
I didn't say I had a plan.

1131
01:13:37,346 --> 01:13:38,480
- You know, there might
be some dynamite left

1132
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:39,915
in Gray Wolf's
construction trailer.

1133
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,383
- Great, let's go.

1134
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,317
- Yeah, the only problem
is after they built the dam

1135
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:43,652
they flooded the access road.

1136
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:44,920
So we have to go back
up to Burly Pines

1137
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,188
and then come back up
through the valley.

1138
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,423
It takes at least an hour.

1139
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,091
- We don't have
that kind of time.

1140
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,194
- Man, there's gotta
be a faster way.

1141
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,311
- Chad, be careful.

1142
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,813
- Alright, I will.

1143
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,284
- Gray Wolf's construction
trailer's right down there.

1144
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,920
- Okay, I'll need to borrow
one of your climbing rigs.

1145
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,822
- No, I'll go.

1146
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:20,656
- Jeff.

1147
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:29,698
- Alright.

1148
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,669
I'll give you a hand.

1149
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:47,783
Listen, I want you to take
this in case you need it.

1150
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:48,750
I hope you don't.

1151
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,585
- Okay.

1152
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:54,189
- Thanks.

1153
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:56,124
- Hey, be careful.

1154
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,226
- Thanks.

1155
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:59,962
(dramatic music)

1156
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,473
(gun fires)

1157
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:51,780
Yes!

1158
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:54,316
Alright!

1159
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,818
(tense music)

1160
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,229
Aha!

1161
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,407
Yes!

1162
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:21,009
That's it.

1163
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:12,094
(screaming)

1164
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:17,566
(fast-paced dramatic music)

1165
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,846
(spraying)

1166
01:17:46,428 --> 01:17:47,663
- Are you okay?

1167
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,433
- Can't stand to be
away from me, huh?

1168
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,901
- Come on.

1169
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:56,772
Let's go, the ants are
getting closer to the dam.

1170
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,415
I got the cable.

1171
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:11,586
I'll see you on top.

1172
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,488
- It'll be my pleasure.

1173
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,090
- Okay, pull me up!

1174
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:22,898
- Good.

1175
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,961
- What took you guys so long?

1176
01:18:52,961 --> 01:18:57,132
- Only a few dozen ants that
wanted to have us for dinner.

1177
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:03,572
- Come on, throw down the cable!

1178
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,845
- Dad, hurry up!

1179
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:11,513
The ants are coming!

1180
01:19:24,459 --> 01:19:26,061
- Stop it, stop it!

1181
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,003
- Alright, fire it up!

1182
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,605
Get me outta here!

1183
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:38,373
- Okay, he's clipped.

1184
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,713
(cable grinding)

1185
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,718
Jeff, what's going on?

1186
01:19:51,253 --> 01:19:53,855
- You guys, what are you doing?

1187
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:57,192
Don't stop now!

1188
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:06,234
(engine puttering)

1189
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:07,068
- Come on.

1190
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,746
- [Jim] Come on you guys!

1191
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,347
Come on you guys, pull me up!

1192
01:20:19,347 --> 01:20:23,185
(engine stuttering)
- Come on.

1193
01:20:24,352 --> 01:20:26,454
- [Jim] What is going on?

1194
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,162
Come on, you bitch!

1195
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,030
(engine fires up)

1196
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,032
- [Chad] Way to go, Dad!

1197
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:49,744
- Sorry guys, guess I'm
the one that got away.

1198
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,189
Thanks.

1199
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,359
- What did you find?

1200
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,261
- Six bundles of dynamite.

1201
01:21:06,261 --> 01:21:08,430
Some fuse material,
there wasn't much of it.

1202
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,531
- How long are they?

1203
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:10,799
- I wish they were longer.

1204
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,467
- Alright, let's go.

1205
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:27,649
(tires screeching)

1206
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:35,423
- Okay you guys, for the
shockwave to have maximum effect

1207
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:38,126
it needs to start at the
top and work its way down.

1208
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:39,060
Laura, careful.

1209
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,129
Set that fuse at the top.

1210
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,398
Croy, you set the
one in the middle.

1211
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,233
I'm gonna go down and get me
one last look at these beauties

1212
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,502
before I flush 'em
back to South America.

1213
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,971
(tense music)

1214
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,852
- Dad, come on.

1215
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:10,759
- [Laura] Croy!

1216
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:19,401
- Come on, hurry!

1217
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,469
Hurry you guys, the
ants are almost there!

1218
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,570
Hurry up!

1219
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,372
Come on, hurry!

1220
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,707
You guys!

1221
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:26,775
Hurry up Dad!

1222
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:40,422
(helicopter whirring)

1223
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,366
- Chad!

1224
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,569
Get on the helicopter!

1225
01:23:03,244 --> 01:23:04,446
- Okay, it's show time.

1226
01:23:04,446 --> 01:23:06,514
Croy, count to three
before you light yours.

1227
01:23:06,514 --> 01:23:07,749
- Got it.

1228
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,050
- Laura, go ahead
and light yours.

1229
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:09,918
- Okay.

1230
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,586
- Let's make some noise!

1231
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:14,356
(dramatic music)

1232
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:28,470
Croy!

1233
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,138
I need your lighter!

1234
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:41,850
- Jim, come on!

1235
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:46,588
(rumbling)

1236
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:48,356
- It's an earthquake!

1237
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,302
- He's still down there!

1238
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,571
- Wait, what are you doing?

1239
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:27,929
Lower!

1240
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,905
Just jump and hold on!

1241
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:08,603
- Jim, come on!

1242
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:09,838
- Come on, Jim!

1243
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:16,044
(explosion booms)

1244
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,862
(explosion roars)

1245
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:50,745
(explosion thunders)

1246
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:11,232
(dramatic music)

1247
01:26:44,632 --> 01:26:46,334
So how'd you find us?

1248
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,269
- Oh, I got a call from
a Gray Wolf Murdock

1249
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:51,673
asking me to look for survivors.

1250
01:26:51,673 --> 01:26:53,274
- What happens now?

1251
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:57,245
- Marabunta's one of
nature's great mysteries.

1252
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,581
Hopefully most of
them drowned but

1253
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:02,750
the ants that got away could
go under ground for 10 years.

1254
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,219
- So where can I
take you people?

1255
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,653
- Boy, I don't know.

1256
01:27:05,653 --> 01:27:06,854
I guess we'll have to wait 'til

1257
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:09,090
the water in Burly
Pines recedes.

1258
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:10,225
- That could take weeks.

1259
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,292
Months, even.

1260
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:35,783
- So, what are you gonna do now?

1261
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:38,886
- Well, we can't say for sure
that the queen was drowned.

1262
01:27:38,886 --> 01:27:41,222
I've got my theories though.

1263
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:45,460
I'd like to stick
around and test 'em out.

1264
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:48,429
You know, my mom used to say
that being an entomologist

1265
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,298
would be boring.

1266
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:52,367
- She should see you now.

1267
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:57,005
So is there's anyone
back in Los Angeles

1268
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:58,840
who's waiting for you?

1269
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,576
- Nothing human.
