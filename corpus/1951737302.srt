00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:03,515
( tires screeching )

190
00:10:06,619 --> 00:10:08,883
( horns honking )

191
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:13,891
l got mad skills,
l will get wild

192
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,827
l got mad skills, l will
get wild

193
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,557
l will get wild,
l will get wild.

194
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:19,224
( whistle blows )

195
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,096
Hey, you!
What do you think you're doing?

196
00:10:21,134 --> 00:10:22,192
Back off, buddy.

197
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,634
She's mine.

198
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,228
Oh, it's you, miss.

199
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:28,501
Well, you lived up
to your reputation.

200
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:29,508
The job is yours.

201
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,237
l have a job. A good one.

202
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:33,211
Oh, yeah? How much do you
make at this ''good job''?

203
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:36,545
$475 a week, plus tips.

204
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:38,880
So how would you like to make
$2,000 a week

205
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,351
plus room and board?

206
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,648
When do l show up?

207
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,679
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.

208
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,920
You'll be driving
Clark Devlin, Mr. Tong.

209
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,621
DOORMAN:
Good day, miss.

210
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,993
Now, you!
Out of here!

211
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,361
( birds chirping )

212
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,029
STEENA:
Good morning, Mr. Tong.

213
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,233
Huh.

214
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:03,799
You put your face on
without me, huh?

215
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:05,572
Please have a seat.

216
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,611
Those are the house rules.

217
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,277
Memorize them.

218
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:15,219
Especially number one.

219
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:18,246
''Never talk directly
to Mr. Devlin.''

220
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,417
lf you have any questions

221
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:20,926
you'll find
all the answers in there.

222
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,021
And, if l were you, l'd get rid
of the mildew on the chin.

223
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:27,589
My soul patch?

224
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,624
Uh, yeah.

225
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,704
You like working
for this Devlin guy?

226
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,640
l don't work for him.

227
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,941
( slow, techno-pop
espionage theme playing )

228
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:53,386
( door shuts )

229
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,594
l'm not a professional driver,
but l'd always believed

230
00:12:03,636 --> 00:12:05,900
that thing you're staring
into is designed

231
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:08,202
for the monitoring of traffic,
not passengers.

232
00:12:08,241 --> 00:12:10,300
Am l wrong?

233
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,411
While l'm really enjoying
our time together

234
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:18,542
shall we try moving?

235
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,014
DEVLlN:
Wallace has been my partner
for years.

236
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,185
Something's happened to him.

237
00:12:27,226 --> 00:12:28,352
He wouldn't just disappear.

238
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:29,486
Now, you get yourjob done

239
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:30,496
and find my partner.

240
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,622
MAN ( on phone ):
So tell me how.

241
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,188
You're the head
of an intelligence agency.

242
00:12:33,232 --> 00:12:34,256
Why don't you be intelligent?

243
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,961
l don't understand
what you're talking about.

244
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,094
Well, why don't you call me back

245
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:38,728
when you do understand
what l'm talking about.

246
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,702
( disco music
plays on speakers )

247
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,768
Did we just take
the Balsam Road exit?

248
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:46,779
Of course.

249
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,145
You have to take
the surface street.

250
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:53,041
Sorry.

251
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,018
Did you get a copy
of the rules?

252
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:56,146
Did you read them?

253
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,381
Jimmy, let me tell you
something, my friend...

254
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:03,059
l hate the rules.

255
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,393
Take Grant Boulevard
all the way.

256
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,397
The lights are timed.

257
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:06,898
Thank you.

258
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:08,901
( speaks Chinese )

259
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,425
And, Jimmy...

260
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,438
crank the music up.

261
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:14,099
Yes, sir.

262
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,165
( music blaring )

263
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:20,771
C.S.A. HEADQUARTERS

264
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:23,077
MAN:
Deputy Director Chalmers,
ladies, gentlemen

265
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:25,983
l present to you
Special Agent Wallace.

266
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:29,146
Deceased two days, 14 hours,
five minutes... approximately.

267
00:13:29,188 --> 00:13:30,815
Pretty interesting.

268
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:32,882
Now, why don't you, uh,
tell me a little about him?

269
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:35,917
Well, in simplest terms,
he drowned in his bathtub.

270
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,896
Contusion here suggests
he hit his head

271
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,194
fell prone, unconscious.

272
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,394
The man infiltrated
a Serbian death squad

273
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:43,629
with not even a scratch.

274
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,762
He goes down in a bathtub?

275
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:46,772
Life's a bitch.

276
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:48,103
You want to put him
back in the fridge?

277
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:49,870
WOMAN:
He didn't drown, sir.

278
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:51,934
He was murdered.

279
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:55,675
Does that make life
a little less bitchy?

280
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:57,580
And-and you would be?

281
00:13:57,617 --> 00:13:59,209
That's Del Blaine, sir.

282
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,879
She's having a filter installed

283
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,945
between her brain and mouth
next week.

284
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:05,082
So you don't think he drowned?

285
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:07,456
Well, sir, there was water
in his lungs

286
00:14:07,493 --> 00:14:08,858
but the pulmonary vein

287
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,556
was filled with
collapsed platelets

288
00:14:10,596 --> 00:14:11,927
indicative of dehydration.

289
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,398
He died of thirst.

290
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:15,400
Thirst.

291
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:16,662
And it wasn't just
city tap water.

292
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:18,533
The mineral profile fit
a high-end bottled water

293
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:19,799
but what was really weird
is that

294
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,966
it contained a strain
of bacteria that l, so far

295
00:14:22,008 --> 00:14:23,373
haven't been able to culture.

296
00:14:24,377 --> 00:14:28,177
Anyway, uh... didn't
mean to interrupt.

297
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,342
Ooh, the woman seems to know
a lot about water.

298
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:34,444
Yeah. She thinks she knows
a lot about a lot of things.

299
00:14:34,487 --> 00:14:37,251
You know, we have a special
situation in the field.

300
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,689
l think we could use
your talents.

301
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,988
You interested?

302
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,460
When do l start?

303
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,053
You ever hear of Clark Devlin?

304
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,859
Rumors and innuendo.

305
00:14:45,898 --> 00:14:47,388
Del, l could tell you
a thing or two

306
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:48,695
about Clark Devlin.

307
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:51,168
Uh, you think we
could keep our minds

308
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:53,001
out of the gutter
for about a second?

309
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,199
Meet me upstairs
in an hour.

310
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,935
CHALMERS:
You might just become

311
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:57,567
Clark Devlin's next partner.

312
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,134
DEVLlN:
l'm going to need

313
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,476
that Gerris marginalis
as soon as possible.

314
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,106
WOMAN:
Yes. My contacts in Guatemala

315
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:04,810
have what you're looking for,
l'm sure.

316
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,182
Good.

317
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,482
And, meanwhile...

318
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:13,523
l'll take one of these
beautiful Uticella marginalis.

319
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,320
Just gorgeous.

320
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,992
( quiet chuckle )

321
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:22,967
Now, you're going to call me?

322
00:15:23,002 --> 00:15:24,299
ls your phone number on file?

323
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:25,565
l'm having a bit of trouble

324
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,334
with the phones at the moment.
lt might be better

325
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:28,840
if you dropped it off yourself.

326
00:15:28,874 --> 00:15:30,034
lt may take a while.

327
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:31,043
Well, why don't you

328
00:15:31,077 --> 00:15:32,442
familiarize yourself
with the route?

329
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:35,470
There's a little gathering
at my house tonight--

330
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,641
a fund-raiser for
the Natural History Museum.

331
00:15:37,683 --> 00:15:39,480
l would so love to have you.

332
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,146
( mouthing )

333
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:43,018
Should l send a car?

334
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,784
l drive myself.

335
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:46,121
Admirable.

336
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,059
Eight o'clock.

337
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,120
And, uh, be sure
not to wear anything

338
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,859
too distracting, or no one
will get their checkbooks out.

339
00:15:56,802 --> 00:15:58,770
How did you learn
to be so smooth?

340
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,795
l've seen the way you drive.

341
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,831
You have
the same instincts l do.

342
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,137
You lack confidence.

343
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,804
The girl in the art gallery's
not beyond you, you know.

344
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,108
You know about her?

345
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:09,614
Every time we leave the house

346
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,640
we go by the art gallery
and slow down.

347
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:12,981
You just need a little polish.

348
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,012
( deep voice ):
l'll never be a Clark Devlin.

349
00:16:17,056 --> 00:16:19,047
Don't tell anyone this, Jimmy,
but there's a lot less

350
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,025
to Clark Devlin
than meets the eye.

351
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,152
l've got a couple of good lines

352
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:23,559
and a couple of
very expensive suits.

353
00:16:23,596 --> 00:16:25,188
Apart from that,
we're exactly the same.

354
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,199
How about
a couple hundred million?

355
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,757
Trust me...
90% of it is clothes.

356
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:29,961
The other ten percent?

357
00:16:30,002 --> 00:16:31,833
The other ten percent's
in there.

358
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,270
You've got plenty of it.

359
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:36,537
Oh, Mr. Devlin,
can l ask you a big favor?

360
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,769
Yeah?

361
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:40,176
Can l stop wearing my hat?

362
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:48,086
All right.

363
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,144
Thank you.

364
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:51,486
No, just stay smooth.
Remember-- smooth.

365
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:52,650
Thank you.

366
00:16:53,726 --> 00:16:56,752
Steena, Devlin.

367
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:59,458
This driver, this Jimmy,
l like him.

368
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,693
Let's get him a proper suit.

369
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,133
Something sexy. You pick it out.

370
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:05,103
All right.

371
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:06,798
Always a delight
talking to you, too, darling.

372
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,101
( phone beeps off )

373
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,573
Home, James.

374
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,236
Absolutely, Mr. Devlin.

375
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:14,769
( Argentine tango music plays )

376
00:17:54,186 --> 00:17:55,210
( tango ends )

377
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:56,320
Oh!

378
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:57,481
Oops.

379
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:01,793
Watch your step.

380
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:03,590
Thank you, sir.

381
00:18:06,966 --> 00:18:09,662
( Jimmy humming )

382
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:21,841
( continues humming )

383
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:25,910
( humming stops )

384
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,858
Oh...
This definitely not a rental.

385
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:38,864
Hello.

386
00:18:38,898 --> 00:18:40,798
My name's Clark Devlin.

387
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,892
Would you like to dance?

388
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:44,596
Would you like to dance?

389
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:45,831
( chuckles )

390
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:47,771
Admirable.

391
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:54,408
There is just one rule.

392
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:55,277
( gasps )

393
00:18:55,314 --> 00:18:58,374
Never touch my tuxedo.

394
00:18:58,417 --> 00:18:59,543
l didn't.

395
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:00,643
Good.

396
00:19:00,686 --> 00:19:02,085
Don't.

397
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:04,055
Yes, sir.

398
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,387
Jimmy.

399
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:07,414
Get the car.

400
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,620
Let's go for dinner.

401
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:11,693
Yes, sir.

402
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,930
* *

403
00:19:26,745 --> 00:19:28,406
What'll you have? lt's my treat.

404
00:19:28,447 --> 00:19:29,436
Anything.

405
00:19:29,482 --> 00:19:30,449
All right.

406
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:32,974
Two Whoppers,
hold the onion, extra ketchup.

407
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,747
Toast the bottom bun only,
medium well-done.

408
00:19:34,787 --> 00:19:35,981
Two large fries,
extra well-done.

409
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:39,013
Two chocolate milkshakes,
however the chef likes.

410
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:40,025
That's it.

411
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,959
Your order's ready.
Pull forward.

412
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,495
That's pretty quick.

413
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,023
lt's fast food. Anything else?

414
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,092
DEVLlN:
Yeah.

415
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,126
l'll have a personal pizza,
crispy crust.

416
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,002
He doesn't eat out much.

417
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,701
They don't serve pizza
at Burger...

418
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:02,475
New item, huh?

419
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,382
Do you have chicken chow mein?

420
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,141
Thank you.

421
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:13,450
-Jimmy?
-Yes?

422
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:15,483
lt's a drive-through.
Let's drive.

423
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:16,927
Watch out!

424
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,221

425
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,591

426
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,695
Watch it, man!

427
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:27,934
Sorry, pal.

430
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,820
JlMMY:
Why are we running away

431
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:43,981
from a skateboard?

432
00:20:44,023 --> 00:20:45,752
l think it's probably a bomb.

433
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,349
( chuckles )

434
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:48,758
l thought you said a bomb.

435
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:52,162
What do you mean, a bomb?

436
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,465
( horns honking )

437
00:20:58,604 --> 00:20:59,969
( horns honking )

438
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,872

443
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,304
( screeching )

444
00:21:43,349 --> 00:21:44,839
No good. Out!

445
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,018
Mr. Dev...

446
00:21:47,052 --> 00:21:47,950
Move!

447
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:49,921
( beeping rapidly )

448
00:21:57,229 --> 00:22:00,130
( glass shattering )

449
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,029
( flames crackling )

450
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,367
Jimmy, you okay?

451
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:14,379

Yeah, all in a day's work, eh?

455
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:21,850
Look.

456
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:26,284
Oh, damn.

457
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:30,028
Mr. Devlin.

458
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:31,654
You got any aspirin?

459
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:32,721
Who did this to you?

460
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,131
Water stri...

461
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,101

Wat... er... stri...

463
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:41,098
Walter... Walter Strider.

464

( dialing cell phone )

465
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:43,806
No... no police.

466
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:44,638

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,539
( bell dings )

477
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,407
Hold on, boss. You'll be fine.

478
00:23:23,449 --> 00:23:24,711
Give me the clipboard.

479
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,717

Oh!

Please wait in the waiting room.

485
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,592

Huh? l'm sorry.

489
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,892
l promise.

490
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:44,926
( speaking Chinese )

491
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,096
MAN:
What do you want

492
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,571
my mother's maiden name for?

493
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:49,870
Last time she was
in here, l was born.

494
00:23:49,908 --> 00:23:52,399
l'm sure my dad had something
to do with it

495
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:53,433
at least l hope so.

496
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:56,505
WOMAN ( singsongy ):
Dr. Angela.

497
00:23:56,548 --> 00:23:58,607
Where is Dr. Angelo?

498
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,776
Dr. Angelo.

499
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:02,412
Are you Dr. Angela?

500
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,590
Dr. Angela.

501
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:10,220
Dr. Ang... ela.

502
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:11,251
Hey!

503
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:14,026
There's no smoking
in a hospital.

504
00:24:14,066 --> 00:24:15,658
l was nervous. How is he?

505
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,998
He might be here a while.

506
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:18,229
You might want to get him

507
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,898
some things from home
in case he comes to.

508
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:21,963
Oh.

509
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,406
He had this clutched
in his hand.

510
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:24,909
l don't know
if it means anything.

511
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,275
WOMAN ( on P.A. ):
Orderly with wheels

512
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:28,711
to the front desk.

513
00:24:28,747 --> 00:24:32,114
l do need Dr. Angelo.

514
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:33,118
Dr. Angelo.

515
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:35,780
Dr. Angelo is on holiday today.

516
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:38,722
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

517
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:44,584

BANNlNG, lNC.,

MAN:

but l'm excited.

521
00:24:51,737 --> 00:24:53,034
l'm pumped, you know.

522
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:55,130
l knew l was doing good work
for Banning lnternational

523
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,436
but l didn't know Mr. Banning

524
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:58,409
would be taking so much notice
of me so soon.

525
00:24:58,443 --> 00:25:00,434
l'll say this, though,
when l'm CEO of this place

526
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,878
l won't be having
my headquarters

527
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,745
in the bottom of a boat,
you know what l mean?

528
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:08,014
MAN 2:
Why did you choose Mr. Lundeen?

529
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:10,647
He questioned
my growth projections.

530
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:11,747
( clanking )

531
00:25:16,662 --> 00:25:19,096
No, that's not it.

532
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,259
l don't like his hair.

533
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,528
Mr. Banning.

534
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:29,337
So, word filtered
down to me

535
00:25:29,374 --> 00:25:33,435
that you don't share my optimism
about our company's future.

536
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,343
Oh, no.

537
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,312
Actually, l just...

538
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:37,144
Drink?

539
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:38,513
Oh, yes, thank you.

540
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,347
l just felt that to meet

541
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,853
your projections, pretty much
every person on Earth

542
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,152
would have to drink
only Banning Springs water.

543
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,782
Yes, indeed.

544
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:50,261
Water, Mr. Lundeen,
comprises 60% of your body.

545
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,195
Don't you find it incredible

546
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,894
that two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom can combine

547
00:25:55,934 --> 00:25:57,663
to create something
so beautiful

548
00:25:57,703 --> 00:25:59,398
so useful, so essential?

549
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,463
l find water to be

550
00:26:01,506 --> 00:26:03,667
miraculous.

551
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,370
Do you think l'm silly?

552
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,002
Not at all.

553
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,069
( clears throat )

554
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:11,045
Feeling thirsty?

555
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:12,710
Yes.

556
00:26:12,751 --> 00:26:15,379
BANNlNG:
You're helping me out
by being a guinea pig

557
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,717
for a new product.

558
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,687
Oh, l see.

559
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:19,520
What a brilliant idea.

560
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:21,958
Water that makes you thirsty.

561
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:23,985
What's in it?

562
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:25,053
Salt?

563
00:26:26,832 --> 00:26:29,824
There's no profundity in salt.

564
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:30,994
( chuckles )

565
00:26:31,036 --> 00:26:32,060
Bacteria.

566
00:26:32,104 --> 00:26:33,162
Once ingested

567
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:36,834
its DNA will instruct
your cells' cytoplasm

568
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,935
to spill electrolytes
into your bloodstream

569
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,276
causing dehydration.

570
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:43,281
( groaning )

571
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:44,111
lt's virulent

572
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,242
but, unfortunately,
it's too fast.

573
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:47,547
Way too fast.

574
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:51,420
As we speak, your internal
organs are shriveling.

575
00:26:51,456 --> 00:26:55,358
You're becoming as dry as...

576
00:26:55,394 --> 00:26:58,363
Well, as dry
as your limited imagination.

577
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:06,799
Gentlemen,
fetch the vacuum, won't you?

578
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,863
Thank you.

579
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,138
Schiffer, Schwartzkopf,
Sondheim, Springsteen...

580
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:21,309
No Strider.

581
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:23,786

00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:38,828

583
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:59,157
Wow.

584
00:28:09,034 --> 00:28:10,023
( beeps )

585
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:12,997

Welcome to the Tactical Uniform

Okay, show me.

593
00:28:57,949 --> 00:28:58,916
Uh-oh.

TUX:
Caution-- demolition mode.

595
00:29:00,786 --> 00:29:02,185
The Tuxedo will consider

596
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,088
any object a target
and act to destroy it.

597
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:07,352
( gasps )

598
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:26,466
Oh, what's happening?

599
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:35,008

00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,699

603
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,937
Burn, baby, burn

604
00:29:57,976 --> 00:29:59,705
Disco inferno

605
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,541
Burn, baby, burn

606
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,480
Burn the mother down

607
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:04,607
Burn, baby, burn...

608
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,742

MAN:
Mr. Devlin, is everything
all right?

612
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:13,822
This is Jimmy.

613
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,259
l think Mr. Devlin wants you
to clean his room tomorrow.

614
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,228
lt's a little bit messy.

615
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,458
l think he threw the party.

616
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:21,761
Should l send someone up now?

617
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,358
No. Maybe after he leaves.

618
00:30:23,401 --> 00:30:24,390
Very good.

619
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:26,063
( phone ringing )

620
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:27,036
Hmm?

621
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,061

Hello?

625
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,874
Are we on?

626
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:38,849
Are we on what?

627
00:30:38,884 --> 00:30:39,851
C.S.A. OPERATlONS

628
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:41,944
l take my work seriously,
Mr. Devlin, so please

629
00:30:41,987 --> 00:30:43,215
stop using
that ridiculous accent.

630
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:44,222
What?

631
00:30:44,256 --> 00:30:45,280
What accent?

632
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,312
All right.

633
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:47,382
You're the senior officer.

634
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:48,687
l'll play it however you want.

635
00:30:48,727 --> 00:30:51,093
Deitrich Banning is holding
a meeting with water CEOs.

636
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,097
The Agency wants us to find out
what he's planning.

637
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:55,759
Wh-What about Walter Strider?

638
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,233
Who is he?

639
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,100
l don't know. You tell me.

640
00:30:59,137 --> 00:31:00,331
Okay.

641
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,136
So, we will meet tomorrow.
V-15, 10:00.

642
00:31:03,175 --> 00:31:05,075
l'll be wearing a gray suit.

643
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,546
Your code is ''nice rack.''

644
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,547
( cackling )

645
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:10,548
l'll respond

646
00:31:10,582 --> 00:31:13,312
''l forgot my bra.''

647
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,012
That passes

648
00:31:15,053 --> 00:31:16,611
for humor around here.

649
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:17,952
JlMMY:
10:00, V-15.

650
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:19,752
What's the cross street?

651
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:20,883
Very funny.

652
00:31:20,926 --> 00:31:23,156
( laughter continues )

653
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,002
( clears throat )

654
00:31:31,036 --> 00:31:32,264
May l join you?

655
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:33,931
Uh, yeah.

656
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:40,273
Nice rack.

657
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:46,149
( heavy blow landing )

658
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:48,311
( phone ringing )

659
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:52,181
Hello.

660
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:54,624
Mr. Devlin, there's been
a change of plans.

661
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,126
But l'm here already.
Where are you?

662
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,492
Don't get all pissy about it.

663
00:31:57,529 --> 00:31:59,258
They just told me,
so l'm telling you.

664
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:00,423
We'll meet tonight

665
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,956
8:00, Pier 1 7,
base of the silo and...

666
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,094
forget the password.

667
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,436
Oh, now you tell me.

668
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:10,998
Oh, hey, there he is.
Oh, my God, that's him.

669
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,009
l got to go.

670
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:13,010
Guy in the raincoat. Get him!

671
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:14,011
l see you tonight. Sorry.

672
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:15,012
OFFlCER:
Stop!

673
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:16,445
WOMAN:
Get back here, you creep!

674
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:35,025
( sighs )

675
00:32:40,138 --> 00:32:42,663
So, we've got five minutes
to get into position.

676
00:32:42,707 --> 00:32:43,867
l secured the rooftop.

677
00:32:43,908 --> 00:32:45,307
The equipment's good to go

678
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:46,537
and l just have to say

679
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:50,571
it is such an honor to be
working with the legendary...

680
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:53,675
Clark Devlin?

681
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,717
l'm Del Blaine.

682
00:32:57,756 --> 00:33:00,589
Have we met before?

683
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,525
No.

684
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,118
Good.

685
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:06,960
Okay, Del Blaine, let's do
what we've come here to do.

686
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:08,989
l'll follow you.

687
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:11,796
Ladies first.

688
00:33:11,836 --> 00:33:14,066
Okay.

689
00:33:17,776 --> 00:33:19,471
A couple of details changed
from what was in the file.

690
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:20,500
You read it?

691
00:33:20,545 --> 00:33:21,512
The files are crap.

692
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:22,638
Give me the
short version.

693
00:33:22,681 --> 00:33:24,342
Deitrich Banning's
holding a meeting

694
00:33:24,382 --> 00:33:26,714
of international
water company CEOs.

695
00:33:26,751 --> 00:33:27,979
We think he's trying
to force them

696
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,350
into selling
their companies to him.

697
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:30,581
Where are you going?

698
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:31,646
Huh?

699
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,918
l'm thinking.

700
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:34,618
We had Agent Wallace
working undercover

701
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:35,921
at his bottled water factory.

702
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,154
That is, until last week.

703
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:38,787
Wallace calls us
on his cell phone

704
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,458
to tell us that the operation
had reached critical mass

705
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,659
and, suddenly, wham! Dead.

706
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:58,043
As you requested, a Klineholtz
bolt-action nine-millimeter

707
00:33:58,083 --> 00:34:01,382
titanium folding stock with
20-time infrared sniper-scope

708
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:03,444
and counterweighted
micro-rifled barrel.

709
00:34:05,056 --> 00:34:07,456
My favorite gun.

710
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,858
But l don't kill
people anymore.

711
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:10,861
Killing?

712
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,658
You're planting a bug.

713
00:34:12,697 --> 00:34:16,189
lt was all in that ''crap'' file.

714
00:34:16,234 --> 00:34:18,031
Go look through your binoculars.

715
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:26,067
( beeping )

716
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,073
They're arriving.

717
00:34:57,108 --> 00:34:58,075
Ready?

718
00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:00,339
lt's critical we get
a listening device

719
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:01,970
in Banning's meeting.

720
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:04,811
Range-- 962 feet.

721
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:08,713
Aim for the briefcase.

722
00:35:08,753 --> 00:35:10,721
Should be a piece
of cake for you, sir.

723
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,126
( yelling )

724
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,650
( foghorn blowing )

725
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,565
You kind of missed.

726
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:33,668
( ricochet )

727
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:51,991
( metallic clunk )

728
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,597
BANNlNG:
ln the year 2001

729
00:35:56,634 --> 00:36:01,662
$35 billion worth of bottled
water was consumed worldwide.

730
00:36:01,706 --> 00:36:05,369
Today, bottled water costs more
per gallon than gasoline.

731
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,676
We, my friends,
are the new oil barons.

732
00:36:09,714 --> 00:36:11,477
BANNlNG ( through headset ):
We at Banning Springs

733
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:12,813
have developed
a new filtration process

734
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,409
that would protect your assets

735
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,819
against the biological holocaust
that's coming.

736
00:36:17,856 --> 00:36:19,414
Looks like we got company.

737
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:20,719
CSA would be my bet.

738
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:25,693

BLAlNE:
So, Mr. Devlin

924
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,789
how are you feeling today?

925
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:15,152
Not so good, l'm afraid.

926
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:16,853
Well, you've got a few hours

927
00:45:16,894 --> 00:45:18,452
to pull yourself together.

928
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:19,520
What do you mean?

929
00:45:19,563 --> 00:45:21,997
After the fiasco
of planting the bug

930
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:23,057
l'd say we have
only one choice:

931
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,591
Level One surveillance.

932
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:26,603
ln other words...

933
00:45:26,637 --> 00:45:27,831
lnfiltration.

934
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:29,601

the Lanford Hotel tonight

of his new partners.

936
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:34,772
Chalmers has agreed to...
get us at the next table.

937
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:36,712
ls this a black-tie event?

938
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,271
No. But l'm sure you'll
wear whatever you want.

939
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,943
Maybe we can find
Walter Strider.

940
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,543

941
00:45:42,586 --> 00:45:43,883

949
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:55,390

950
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:01,571

951
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:09,343
At last

952
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:16,777

953
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:26,628

No, he's fine.

1021
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:34,583
He's not fine.

1022
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,752
And Banning is going to leave.

1023
00:48:36,794 --> 00:48:37,761

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:36,204
Oh!

1108
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:38,870
Ooh.

1109
00:51:50,754 --> 00:51:52,585
( audience whistling )

1110
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:02,624
( cheering and whistling )

1111
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:12,605
( audience cheering,
music playing )

1112
00:52:12,643 --> 00:52:15,203
Good God!

1113
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:16,712
So, you had fun up there.

1114
00:52:16,747 --> 00:52:18,044
( derisive groan )

1115
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,878
l was blending;
that's what agents do.

1116
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:21,248
Would you please stop?

1117
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,617
l'd like to get to Banning's
table before morning.

1118
00:52:23,654 --> 00:52:25,212
Whoa! Hey, slut, thanks.

1119
00:52:25,255 --> 00:52:28,122
l hate celebrities
who brush off their fans.

1120
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:30,683
Banning's girlfriend
has been drinking.

1121
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:32,285
Okay, she might be
able to tell-- Clark!

1122
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:33,296
Yes.

1123
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:34,297
Stop.

1124
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:36,196
Get on the scene, Sex Machine.

1125
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:37,928
( light applause )

1126
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:39,128
MAN:
Great job, man.

1127
00:52:39,169 --> 00:52:40,796
Hi.

1128
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:42,669
Hi. Good evening.

1129
00:52:42,706 --> 00:52:44,173
Hello.

1130
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,232
Well, we're all

1131
00:52:45,275 --> 00:52:48,301
vaguely honored
you could join us, l suppose.

1132
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:51,940
Singing is my favorite
type of music.

1133
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:53,540
Oh, admirable.

1134
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:55,449
BANNlNG:
Regrettably, this is

1135
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,454
my vacuous fiancee.

1136
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:59,012
l think her name is Cheryl

1137
00:52:59,056 --> 00:53:00,614
something.

1138
00:53:00,657 --> 00:53:01,749
Oh, charmed.

1139
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:04,352
l could look at you all day.

1140
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:05,418
( giggles )

1141
00:53:05,462 --> 00:53:07,623
Do you ever dance
unprofessionally...

1142
00:53:07,664 --> 00:53:09,461
Emperor?

1143
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,660
Let's see what l can do.

1144
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:11,963
( giggles )

1145
00:53:12,002 --> 00:53:13,060
Oh, excuse us.

1146
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:16,504
Of course.

1147
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,098
( band plays mambo )

1148
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:19,574
Do you know how to mambo?

1149
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:20,668
l hope so.

1150
00:53:20,711 --> 00:53:22,838
( beeping )

1151
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,144
Whoo!

1152
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:26,149
( giggling )

1153
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:29,550
( sultry saxophone plays )

1154
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,588
Hmm... '92 Dasani.

1155
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:42,622
Gentle bouquet with a hint
of vinyl polychloride.

1156
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:46,295
Earthy yet... ethereal.

1157
00:53:46,336 --> 00:53:47,826
Cheers.

1158
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:48,838
( water splashes )

1159
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:50,134
Oops.

1160
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,300
l spilled.

1161
00:54:00,517 --> 00:54:02,815
JlMMY:
You and Banning seem very close.

1162
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:04,115
Tell me about his work.

1163
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:06,918
l don't want
to talk about him.

1164
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,618
l want to talk about you.

1165
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:10,593
You're such a handsome devil.

1166
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:13,653
So are you.

1167
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:18,134
When l can't sleep at night,
which is quite often

1168
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:20,762
l step into my
laboratory and l play.

1169
00:54:20,804 --> 00:54:22,897
lt's not work, you see.

1170
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,134
lt's glorious

1171
00:54:24,174 --> 00:54:27,871
wet... play.

1172
00:54:27,911 --> 00:54:32,211
Well, maybe l can
come over and play.

1173
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:35,707
That would be very nice.

1174
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:38,687
The thing is, l, uh...

1175
00:54:38,722 --> 00:54:43,853
l have a small problem...
trusting people.

1176
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:48,991
l don't know if l can trust
myself with you, Deitrich.

1177
00:54:49,032 --> 00:54:51,432
Well, maybe we can come up

1178
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:54,096
with a way for you to pro...

1179
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:03,609
Her name's Del Blaine.
She's CSA.

1180
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:05,205
Oh, bloody hell.

1181
00:55:05,248 --> 00:55:09,582
He drives a BMW,
registered to Clark Devlin.

1182
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,112
You told me you
dealt with Devlin

1183
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:15,818
with the skateboard bomb.

1184
00:55:15,859 --> 00:55:18,885
Yeah, well, he looks
pretty alive to me.

1185
00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:20,829
Pretty good dancer.
He's all over Cheryl.

1186
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:22,695
You want me to do
something about that?

1187
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:24,667
No.

1188
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:25,861
Maybe the rancid tart

1189
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:28,063
might actually be
of some use for once.

1190
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:29,436
Get the boys, would you?

1191
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:35,239
Whoo! l am so bushed.

1192
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,269
l'm sorry,
you'll have to excuse me.

1193
00:55:37,314 --> 00:55:39,179
Unfortunate interruptus.

1194
00:55:39,216 --> 00:55:41,116
So, my long streak of love,
here is the key

1195
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:42,379
to the hospitality suite

1196
00:55:42,419 --> 00:55:45,547
should you feel the need
to spend the night.

1197
00:55:45,589 --> 00:55:47,113
Good-bye.

1198
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:49,182
Well, l think l'll just go up

1199
00:55:49,226 --> 00:55:52,559
to room 7-2-- excuse me-- 6-8

1200
00:55:52,596 --> 00:55:54,223
and take a long, hot bath

1201
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:57,791
in room 7-2-6-8.

1202
00:55:57,834 --> 00:55:58,562
Good night.

1203
00:55:58,602 --> 00:55:59,591
Good night.

1204
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,308
( chuckles )

1205
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:08,243
And once again,
we end up with nothing.

1206
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:10,041
l can get her to talk.

1207
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,513
And say what?

1208
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:13,846
( ditzy voice ):
Oh, Emperor,
would you sign my bra?

1209
00:56:13,884 --> 00:56:16,182
Oops, l'm not wearing one.

1210
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,413
( giggles )

1211
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:19,319
What is it with you and bras?

1212
00:56:19,356 --> 00:56:20,687
She has information.

1213
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:23,192
Oh, right, and that's why you
have to go up to her hotel room.

1214
00:56:23,226 --> 00:56:25,421
You have never seen my work.

1215
00:56:25,462 --> 00:56:28,397
This is what
Clark Devlin does best.

1216
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:29,922
Can l go home?

1217
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:31,593
No, you have to cover me.

1218
00:56:31,635 --> 00:56:33,262
With what, a shot of penicillin?

1219
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,270
Huh?

1220
00:56:34,304 --> 00:56:35,271
Fine.

1221
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:37,637
l'll be waiting by the pool.

1222
00:56:37,674 --> 00:56:38,641
Oh, wait.

1223
00:56:38,675 --> 00:56:40,643
What's her room number again?

1224
00:56:40,677 --> 00:56:42,144
( ditzy voice ):
7-2-6-8.

1225
00:56:42,179 --> 00:56:45,444
7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8. 7-2-6-8.

1226
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:49,009
( amplified, slow motion
footsteps echoing )

1227
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:15,341
( ''You'll Never Find Another
Love Like Mine'' begins )

1228
00:57:15,378 --> 00:57:17,505
Yoo-hoo!

1229
00:57:17,547 --> 00:57:19,674
Cheryl!

1230
00:57:19,716 --> 00:57:21,183
CHERYL:
Hey, you little devil.

1231
00:57:21,218 --> 00:57:22,378
You'll never find...

1232
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:24,046
What kind of bubbles
do you like?

1233
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:25,349
Little...

1234
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:26,719
As long as you live

1235
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:27,724
...or big?!

1236
00:57:27,758 --> 00:57:28,725
( clattering )

1237
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:30,920
Someone who loves you

1238
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,191
Hang it for me, will you?

1239
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:37,564
Tender like l do

1240
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:40,161
Whoa, l'm not bragging
on myself...

1241
00:57:40,203 --> 00:57:41,170
So...

1242
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:43,365
l know you can dance, but...

1243
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:45,203
what else can you do?

1244
00:57:45,242 --> 00:57:46,300
Get on the bed.

1245
00:57:46,343 --> 00:57:47,310
l'll show you.

1246
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:48,641
( giggling )

1247
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:49,645
Oh!

1248
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:50,805
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

1249
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,405
( beeping )

1250
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:55,646
Okay, Mr. Devlin,
let's see your magic.

1251
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,778
( Cheryl moaning erotically )

1252
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:00,187
Oh, my God, your hands
are like a machine.

1253
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:03,249
Oh, l am never working
with him again.

1254
00:58:03,293 --> 00:58:07,229
So, tell me about Deitrich's
good friend, Walter Strider.

1255
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:08,322
( bones cracking )

1256
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:10,128
Oh! Never heard of him...

1257
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,226
but l know Dry Martini.

1258
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:14,635
Maybe someone should mix us
a couple.

1259
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:18,072
Y-O-U spells ''you.''

1260
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:19,336
( giggles softly )

1261
00:58:19,376 --> 00:58:21,469
( chuckles )

1262
00:58:21,511 --> 00:58:22,500
Oh.

1263
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:25,572
You're smart.

1264
00:58:25,615 --> 00:58:27,276
Really?

1265
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:28,443
And a good speller.

1266
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:29,452
( giggling )

1267
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:30,817
Thanks. l graduated
top two-thirds

1268
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,651
of my sixth grade class.

1269
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:36,653
But l know somehow, some way...

1270
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:37,955
What a gentleman.

1271
00:58:37,994 --> 00:58:39,484
Some way, you are...

1272
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:41,656
You're gonna miss my lovin'...

1273
00:58:41,698 --> 00:58:45,794
Look, it's Cocktail Barbie.

1274
00:58:45,836 --> 00:58:47,326
Take your clothes off
and stay a while.

1275
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,359
l-l like my clothes on.

1276
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:49,372
Kinky boy.

1277
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:50,430
Wh-Wh...?

1278
00:58:50,473 --> 00:58:51,405
Where did you
get that pin?

1279
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:53,375
Oh. Deitrich.

1280
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,536
Want to have a closer look?

1281
00:58:54,578 --> 00:58:55,272
Huh?

1282
00:58:55,312 --> 00:58:56,301
( giggling )

1283
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:00,472
l'm sorry.

1284
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:02,280
Look at the time. l got to go.

1285
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,445
Oh, Emperor.

1286
00:59:03,486 --> 00:59:04,453
( yelling )

00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:09,854
Oh, Emperor.

1292
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:14,161
Oh, where are you going

1293
00:59:14,197 --> 00:59:15,664
you naughty boy?

1294
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:19,294
l adore romance when it's rough.

1295
00:59:19,336 --> 00:59:20,166
Whoo!

1296
00:59:20,203 --> 00:59:21,966

( angry grunt )

1302
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:34,041
Get back here!

1303
00:59:34,084 --> 00:59:34,914
You're dead meat!

1304
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,111
Come on!

1308
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:53,300
Take a bath.

1309
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:56,203
Oh, yes, because l've been
a dirty, dirty girl.

1310
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:57,206

1311
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:58,104
( gasping )

1312
00:59:58,141 --> 00:59:59,165
Go fill the tub.

1313
00:59:59,209 --> 01:00:00,301
Do you like it with bubbles?

1314
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,310
Hot bubbles.

1315
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:03,278

Oh, yippee!

1316
01:00:03,313 --> 01:00:04,280
Yippee!

1317
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:05,781

1318
01:00:05,815 --> 01:00:09,251
CHERYL:
Tiny bubbles in my wine...

1319
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:11,015
Makes me feel fine

1320
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:13,113
Come on, her voice reminds me
of my mother.

1321
01:00:13,156 --> 01:00:14,748
( thud )

1322
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,259
CHERYL:

1323
01:00:17,294 --> 01:00:18,989

1324
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,393

1328
01:00:40,183 --> 01:00:42,083
What's happening?

1329
01:00:42,118 --> 01:00:48,887
CHERYL:
What's going on under those
cute little boxers of yours?

1330

Ow!

1337
01:01:37,107 --> 01:01:38,472

Say good night... agent!

1341
01:01:51,154 --> 01:01:53,145
Del Blaine. Del Blaine.

1342
01:01:53,189 --> 01:01:54,156

1345
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,029
Sorry.

1346
01:02:12,575 --> 01:02:13,542
CHERYL:
Emperor...

1347
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:14,634
This is not what
l signed up for!

1348
01:02:14,677 --> 01:02:15,701
l need my bathroom bud.

1349
01:02:15,745 --> 01:02:16,905
Shh. She's in there
taking a bath.

1350
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:17,844
What happened to your nose?

1351
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:18,870
( yelping )

1352
01:02:18,915 --> 01:02:21,008
( gasping and yelping )

1353
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:23,042
Sorry!

1354
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:24,053
Honeymooners.

1355
01:02:24,087 --> 01:02:26,282
Yes, some things never change.

1356
01:02:26,322 --> 01:02:28,153
Emperor!

1357
01:02:28,191 --> 01:02:30,250
Emperor, come back!

1358
01:02:30,293 --> 01:02:32,659
Please!

1359
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:33,889
( soft grunt )

1360
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,955
Oh...

1361
01:02:35,999 --> 01:02:37,967
Go! Get going.

1362
01:02:39,969 --> 01:02:40,958
Ouch!

1363
01:02:41,004 --> 01:02:45,634
Can't you do anything?

1364
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:47,404
Why are you so mad?

1365
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:49,708
Gee, let me think.

1366
01:02:49,746 --> 01:02:52,647
Because big, ugly men
are trying to kill me?

1367
01:02:52,682 --> 01:02:54,115
Because l got stuck

1368
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:57,085
with a millionaire playboy
dilettante for a partner?

1369
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,281
You don't care
how you make people feel.

1370
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:00,414
l happen to be

1371
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:02,948
an extremely sensitive person.

1372
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:03,981
Ow!

1373
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:07,962
Okay, you think
you know feelings.

1374
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:09,123
Look at me.

1375
01:03:10,133 --> 01:03:12,658
How do l feel?

1376
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:13,669
Sick.

1377
01:03:13,703 --> 01:03:14,635
Sad.

1378
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:15,899
What about now?

1379
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:19,833
Constipated.

1380
01:03:21,644 --> 01:03:22,975
Creepy.

1381
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:24,570
Horny.

1382
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:27,174
( exaggerated laughter ):
ls funny.

1383
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:28,844
( exaggerated yelling ):
ls angry.

1384
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:30,318
( exaggerated scream ):
ls crazy.

1385
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:31,684
You know nothing.

1386
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:34,189
This is why you don't have
a boyfriend.

1387
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:36,590
No wonder you didn't get
anything from Banning.

1388
01:03:36,626 --> 01:03:39,561
Oh... right, l didn't
get anything from Banning

1389
01:03:39,596 --> 01:03:41,928
except where
his friggin' lab is.

1390
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:43,694
Where?

1391
01:03:43,733 --> 01:03:46,258
Let's see if the great master
''agent'' can figure it out.

1392
01:03:46,302 --> 01:03:48,361
Banning said he sometimes
has trouble sleeping.

1393
01:03:48,404 --> 01:03:49,371
Big secret.

1394
01:03:49,405 --> 01:03:52,033
All men have trouble sleeping.

1395
01:03:52,075 --> 01:03:54,976
Sometimes at night, he goes
down and works in his lab.

1396
01:03:55,011 --> 01:03:57,241
He sleeps in his lab?

1397
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:58,907
He sleeps in his bedroom.

1398
01:03:58,948 --> 01:04:01,576
His lab's in his bedroom?

1399
01:04:01,618 --> 01:04:02,380
No.

1400
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:04,249
Get your facts straight.

1401
01:04:04,287 --> 01:04:07,256
His lab is at his house--

1402
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:10,555
his casa, where he lives--
get it?

1403
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:14,023
Excellent.

1404
01:04:14,063 --> 01:04:16,623
You passed the test.

1405
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:18,566
l put in a good word
with the boss.

1406
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:20,125
Well, let's go
see Chalmers tonight.

1407
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,102
No.

1408
01:04:21,137 --> 01:04:22,263
Keep him out of this.

1409
01:04:22,305 --> 01:04:24,102
Just you and me.

1410
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:25,334
You know,
if you're so good at this

1411
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,899
why-why don't you tell me
something about me?

1412
01:04:26,943 --> 01:04:29,741
Okay.

1413
01:04:29,779 --> 01:04:32,839
You have big crush on me

1414
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:35,442
and l know your
name is Del Blaine.

1415
01:04:35,485 --> 01:04:38,215
First of all, you wish, and...

1416
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:41,613
my real name is Delilah.

1417
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,819
Delilah?

1418
01:04:44,727 --> 01:04:46,422
Suits you.

1419
01:04:48,598 --> 01:04:49,565
Hey...

1420
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:50,588
Hmm?

1421
01:05:00,677 --> 01:05:01,905
( Jimmy grunting )

1422
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:02,877
Ooh!

1423
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:04,038
( laughing ):
Oh!

1424
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,640
( shrieking ):
Oh... oh, Emperor!

1425
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:07,741
JlMMY:
Hey!

1426
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:11,117
Oh, God, Clark,
isn't anything sacred?

1427
01:05:11,154 --> 01:05:14,089
Oh, rug burns are so sexy!

1428
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,818
lt's the driver.

1429
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:16,825
Oh, my God.

1430
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,157
( Cheryl laughing )

1431
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:22,630
( techno-pop dance music plays )

1432
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:23,927
Thank you.

1433
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,161
lnvitations?

1434
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:26,532
Oh, yes.

1435
01:05:26,569 --> 01:05:28,537
Why don't you offer him
five bucks?

1436
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:30,198
l have them somewhere.

1437
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,333
Birds of a feather...

1438
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,366
Nice party, huh?

1439
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:37,342
So, you're the strong,
silent type, huh?

1440
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:39,075
That's the whole
bouncer package.

1441
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:40,639
( whirring and beeping )

1442
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:42,913
l didn't mean your package.

1443
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:43,919
Thank you...

1444
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:46,444
Dr. Schwartz.

1445
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:47,456
Shalom.

1446
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:48,479
Come, darling.

1447
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,227
Product launch, my ass.

1448
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:54,594
Let's go find
Banning's lab.

1449
01:05:54,631 --> 01:05:56,895
( techno dance music blaring )

1450
01:06:26,863 --> 01:06:28,228
Let's go.

1451
01:06:50,486 --> 01:06:52,351
( gate squeaking )

1452
01:06:54,724 --> 01:06:57,022
Are you trying to get me alone?

1453
01:06:57,060 --> 01:06:58,220
Where'd they go?

1454
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,729
Don't tell me
the great Clark Devlin

1455
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:02,822
can't come up with an answer.

1456
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:04,230
( water splashing )

1457
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,171
Although

1458
01:07:16,212 --> 01:07:18,271
he can walk on water.

1459
01:07:20,216 --> 01:07:23,549
lt's a trick, right?

1460
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:28,521
( machinery grinding )

1461
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:39,860
Come on.

1462
01:07:51,214 --> 01:07:52,238
Wow!

1463
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:53,908
Mr. Devlin likes insects, too.

1464
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:54,917
What?

1465
01:07:54,951 --> 01:07:56,316
Oh, uh, uh, l mean

1466
01:07:56,352 --> 01:07:59,116
sometime l speak of myself
in the third person.

1467
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:01,419
Hmm, Del Blaine
thinks you're a freak.

1468
01:08:02,558 --> 01:08:03,991
MAN:
Have you cleaned the tanks?

1469
01:08:04,026 --> 01:08:05,653

01:14:42,324 --> 01:14:44,019
Well, it's brilliant.

1652
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:46,027
They touch down
on the reservoirs.

1653
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:48,029
Their little feet transfer
a deadly bacteria

1654
01:14:48,063 --> 01:14:49,792
without breaking
the surface of the water

1655
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:51,993
so no alarms sound,
and it looks like

1656
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:54,628
a nasty little trick of nature.

1657
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:55,637
Fortunately

1658
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:57,434
there is one drinkable
water source.

1659
01:14:57,473 --> 01:14:58,098
( gasps )

1660
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:00,334
Yours.

1661
01:15:00,376 --> 01:15:01,934
( giggles maniacally )

1662
01:15:01,977 --> 01:15:04,241
Deitrich,
you're a genius.

1663
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,305
Too bad it won't work.

1664
01:15:08,584 --> 01:15:10,848
Oh... you so wrong.

1665
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:13,719
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong.

1666
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:15,951
lt will work because
my plan is perfect.

1667
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:19,154
Sorry, Mr. Banning,
it's your plan... and mine.

1668
01:15:19,195 --> 01:15:21,493
Um... it's ours.

1669
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:22,929
Shut up. Explain.

1670
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:24,990
Oh, all righty.

1671
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:27,434
The life cycle
of the Gerris maginatus

1672
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:29,369
begins with mating--

1673
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:33,501
something Dr. Simms
is not personally familiar with.

1674
01:15:33,542 --> 01:15:35,442
Anyhoo, the insects swarm

1675
01:15:35,477 --> 01:15:36,944
to freshwater

1676
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:39,345
where fertilized eggs are then
deposited on the underside

1677
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:42,680
of lotus leaves
and hatch into larvae.

1678
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:45,710
Spare me
the Discovery Channel blather.

1679
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:46,743
( chuckles )

1680
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,950
Tell me why it won't work.

1681
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:50,117
Yes, tell us.

1682
01:15:50,159 --> 01:15:51,922
Why it won't work?

1683
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:55,226
This is the northern
hemisphere, correct?

1684
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:57,755
You incubated insects native
to the southern hemisphere.

1685
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,260
So, simply, it is too cold
for them to mature sexually--

1686
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:05,603
much like Simms here.

1687
01:16:05,641 --> 01:16:06,767
Therefore...

1688
01:16:06,809 --> 01:16:07,776
they won't mate.

1689
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:11,075
Therefore,
they won't seek out water.

1690
01:16:11,113 --> 01:16:12,808
ls this true?

1691
01:16:12,848 --> 01:16:16,477
No, l knew a girl once,
in college, quite well.

1692
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:17,985
Very well.

1693
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,885
And then you remember
cousin Doris?

1694
01:16:19,922 --> 01:16:22,254
No, Simms, the bugs.

1695
01:16:22,291 --> 01:16:23,588
The bugs.

1696
01:16:23,626 --> 01:16:26,618
Oh, you're not going
to believe this hootchie

1697
01:16:26,662 --> 01:16:28,095
are you, Mr. Banning?

1698
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,119
Oh, yeah?

1699
01:16:29,164 --> 01:16:32,156
Ask him if l lied
about the tuxedo.

1700
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:35,261
This tuxedo is...
it's all right. lt's...

1701
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:36,362
''All right''?

1702
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:38,339
That is the most incredible
piece of technology

1703
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:40,239
on the planet.

1704
01:16:40,276 --> 01:16:45,908
And l am laying it
in your big, hot hands.

1705
01:16:45,948 --> 01:16:48,542
Mr. Banning, release the bugs.

1706
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:49,551
Go ahead.

1707
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:50,552
Do what he tells you.

1708
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:52,178
You might have a chance
at second prize

1709
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,711
at a junior high school
science fair

1710
01:16:53,756 --> 01:16:56,452
but you can forget your dreams
of world domination.

1711
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,221
Slip into it, Deitrich.

1712
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,160
See how it feels.

1713
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:14,166
DEVLlN:
The other ten percent's
in there.

1714
01:17:14,209 --> 01:17:15,574
You've got plenty of it.

1715
01:17:23,686 --> 01:17:26,154
Hey, Dr. Schwartz.

1716
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:30,181
Tell your boss
Clark Devlin is back.

1717
01:17:30,225 --> 01:17:31,385
( guns cocking )

1718
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:39,091

1719
01:17:43,005 --> 01:17:45,030
Drapes nicely.

1720

( beeping )

1721
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:05,754
Well, it certainly puts
a spring in one's step.

1722
01:18:05,794 --> 01:18:07,728
Happy to have lightened
your loafers, Deitrich.

1723
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:09,321
One question.

1724
01:18:09,365 --> 01:18:10,627
Why are you doing this?

1725
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,260
( alarms blaring )

1726
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:17,628
Hey, what the hell is this?

1727
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:20,972
This is the moment where
50 CSA commandos storm in

1728
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,205

your pretentious accent

1729

your jackass sideburns

1730
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:26,907
to the Federal pen where,
guess what?

1731
01:18:26,949 --> 01:18:31,545
All they serve is highly
chlorinated tap water.

1732
01:18:31,587 --> 01:18:34,579
Presenting Clark Devlin.

1733
01:18:34,623 --> 01:18:36,420
( grunts )

1734
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:46,492
Have l told you how amazing
you look in this tuxedo?

1735
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:48,400
( groans )

1736
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:49,529
Simms, prepare for release.

1737
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:52,062
With pleasure, sir.

l've come to save you.

1747
01:19:15,864 --> 01:19:16,831
That's great.

For years, l've heard about you.

1752
01:19:25,741 --> 01:19:29,074
Now we finally meet, l find
that the great Clark Devlin

1753
01:19:29,111 --> 01:19:31,238
is nothing more
than an ordinary man

1754
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,875
who's about to die
an extraordinary death.

1755
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:35,975
You're right

1756
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:37,918
except for one thing.

1757
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:39,352

You okay?

1763
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,967
Uh, Jimmy, is there

1764
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:54,127
something you want to tell me?

1765
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:55,158

2008
01:30:59,868 --> 01:31:00,835
You're the love of my life.

2009
01:31:00,869 --> 01:31:02,666
No, you never tell them
you love them, Jimmy.

2010
01:31:02,704 --> 01:31:04,831
Can you have... dinner with me?

2011
01:31:04,873 --> 01:31:06,431
Get out.

2012
01:31:06,474 --> 01:31:08,465
Pretty sure he craps
his pants, people.

2013
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:09,477
l just want to have dinner.

2014
01:31:09,511 --> 01:31:10,478
Get out now.

2015
01:31:10,512 --> 01:31:11,479
-Lunch?
-Now!

2016
01:31:11,513 --> 01:31:12,571
Oh!

2017
01:31:12,614 --> 01:31:14,081
STEENA:
All right, we're
terminating this mission.

2018
01:31:14,115 --> 01:31:15,673
Pack it up and roll home.

2019
01:31:15,717 --> 01:31:19,483
l think l blew it, Mr. Devlin.

2020
01:31:19,521 --> 01:31:21,045
Jimmy, l wrote the book
on this stuff.

2021
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:22,989
Trust me, you didn't blow it.
You outgrew her.

2022
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:23,991
Maybe.

2023
01:31:24,025 --> 01:31:25,117
Tell you what.
Take the weekend off.

2024
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:26,320
First thing Monday morning

2025
01:31:26,361 --> 01:31:28,329
we'll head for somewhere with
more interesting prospects.

2026
01:31:28,363 --> 01:31:30,263
How about Monte Carlo?

2027
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:31,265
Sounds good.

2028
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:32,732
Thanks, Mr. Devlin.

2029
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:34,200
Thanks, everybody.

2030
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:35,202
AGENT:
lt's okay, Jimmy.

2031
01:31:35,236 --> 01:31:36,203
AGENT 2:
Hang in there.

2032
01:31:36,237 --> 01:31:37,704
AGENT 3:
Next time.

2033
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:40,173
Well, if you were trying
to get her to notice you

2034
01:31:40,208 --> 01:31:41,232
mission accomplished.

2035
01:31:41,276 --> 01:31:43,369
What are you planning
for the second date?

2036
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:44,400
Running at her with a knife?

2037
01:31:44,445 --> 01:31:46,606
lt's difficult for me.

2038
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:47,615
What is so hard?

2039
01:31:47,649 --> 01:31:49,173
You just have to say
something like...

2040
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:50,980
''Excuse me, you want
to go get some coffee?''

2041
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:54,785
When l around beautiful
women, l can't talk.

2042
01:31:54,823 --> 01:31:57,724
Sure. Beautiful women.

2043
01:31:57,759 --> 01:31:58,987
You know, a real knockout.

2044
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:00,892
Like the beautiful lady
in the gallery.

2045
01:32:00,929 --> 01:32:01,918
Thank you.

2046
01:32:01,963 --> 01:32:04,056
Thank you very much.

2047
01:32:04,098 --> 01:32:05,963
What's wrong?

2048
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,399
Nothing.

2049
01:32:07,435 --> 01:32:09,164
What?

2050
01:32:09,204 --> 01:32:11,604
You can't tell how l feel?

2051
01:32:11,639 --> 01:32:14,437
You look sad.

2052
01:32:14,475 --> 01:32:15,703
No.

2053
01:32:15,743 --> 01:32:17,643
Sick?

2054
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:18,646
No.

2055
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:21,148
Constipated?

2056
01:32:21,182 --> 01:32:22,274
No.

2057
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:23,716
A little.

2058
01:32:23,751 --> 01:32:26,083
Tell me, what's wrong?

2059
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,556
lt's just no guy would ever
do anything for me

2060
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:31,582
like what you did for her.

2061
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:32,786
Or tried to do.

2062
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:34,351
You know why?

2063
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:38,661
Because you are
a pain in the butt.

2064
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,225
Yeah, nice working
with you, too.

2065
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:43,829
Hello.

2066
01:32:43,872 --> 01:32:45,737
Delilah, excuse me.

2067
01:32:45,773 --> 01:32:48,867
You want to have a coffee?

2068
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:51,538
l only drink organic green tea.

2069
01:32:51,579 --> 01:32:52,807
( imitates buzzer )

2070
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:53,836
Wrong answer.

2071
01:32:53,882 --> 01:32:56,146
You're never going
to have a boyfriend.

2072
01:32:56,184 --> 01:32:57,151
Fine.

2073
01:32:57,185 --> 01:33:01,019
Coffee. l love coffee.

2074
01:33:01,055 --> 01:33:02,716
You learn quick.

2075
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:07,384

or your horny face?

2076
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:09,293
l tell you later.

2077
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:10,528
One, two, three, four

2078
01:33:10,565 --> 01:33:12,430
( James Brown's ''Get Up''
begins )

2079
01:33:12,467 --> 01:33:13,627
Get up

2080
01:33:13,668 --> 01:33:14,965
Getty-get, get-get-get get on up

2081
01:33:15,003 --> 01:33:15,970

2082
01:33:16,004 --> 01:33:16,971
Get up now

2083
01:33:17,005 --> 01:33:17,972
Getty-get, get-get-get...

2084
01:33:18,006 --> 01:33:19,871
James. James...

2085
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:20,875
Tong...

2086
01:33:20,909 --> 01:33:21,876
( giggling )

2087
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:22,842
Get-get-get get on up...

2088
01:33:22,877 --> 01:33:23,866
Cut.

01:33:24,913 --> 01:33:25,880
Get up now

2090
01:33:25,914 --> 01:33:27,677
Getty-get, get-get-get on up

2091
01:33:27,715 --> 01:33:29,080
Oh...

2092
01:33:29,117 --> 01:33:32,143
Couldn't tell you
what l'm about to say.

2093
01:33:32,186 --> 01:33:33,380
( grunting )

2094
01:33:33,421 --> 01:33:34,410
Purse!

2095
01:33:34,455 --> 01:33:35,444

2096
01:33:37,492 --> 01:33:38,459
Cut.

2097
01:33:38,493 --> 01:33:39,858
l'm sorry.

2098
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:42,586
Huh?

2099
01:33:43,598 --> 01:33:45,964
( laughing )

2100
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,434
The bird hit the guy.

2101
01:33:48,469 --> 01:33:49,436
Huh?

2102
01:33:49,470 --> 01:33:50,767
WOMAN:
ls this a bunch of crap.

2103
01:33:50,805 --> 01:33:51,999
ls this a bunch crap?

2104
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,439
Bunch of crap.

2105
01:33:53,474 --> 01:33:54,736
Okay.

2106
01:33:54,776 --> 01:33:58,234
You think l'm speak
very good English, huh?

2107
01:33:58,279 --> 01:34:00,543
What's in your head,
flies out your mouth.

2108
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:03,015
What's in your head,
fly from your mouth.

2109
01:34:03,051 --> 01:34:04,245
What's in your mouth...

2110
01:34:05,253 --> 01:34:06,481
That's okay. Cut.

2111
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:07,488
No wonder.

2112
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:09,581
This is why
you don't have a boyfriend.

2113
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:12,048
That's...

2114
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:13,958
( laughter )

2115
01:34:13,995 --> 01:34:16,657
That's... thought...

2116
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:17,630
Frog?

2117
01:34:17,665 --> 01:34:18,597
Fraud.

2118
01:34:18,633 --> 01:34:19,600
( giggling )

2119
01:34:19,634 --> 01:34:20,601
Look at...

2120
01:34:20,635 --> 01:34:22,296
Look at her ugly face.

2121
01:34:22,337 --> 01:34:23,998
Every time l look...

2122
01:34:24,038 --> 01:34:26,131
Every time, she just like this.

2123
01:34:28,109 --> 01:34:29,371
How can l act?

2124
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:31,037
-Can we do a single on me?
-No.

2125
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:32,046
Action!

2126
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,274
Aah...

2127
01:34:34,549 --> 01:34:35,516
No, no, no.

2128
01:34:35,550 --> 01:34:37,142
Cut! Cut!

2129
01:34:41,089 --> 01:34:42,681
( grunting )

2130
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:44,521
Let's follow 'em.
They'll take us to the lab.

2131
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:45,583
Who?

2132
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:47,116

Cut.

2137
01:34:57,205 --> 01:34:58,536
Jimmy.

2138
01:34:58,573 --> 01:34:59,540
What do you...?

2139
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:01,599
( laughing )

2140
01:35:01,642 --> 01:35:03,200
( crew laughing )

01:35:03,244 --> 01:35:05,178
She smile the whole movie.

2142
01:35:05,213 --> 01:35:07,545
Waste of film, waste of time.

2143
01:35:07,582 --> 01:35:10,244
What is she doing?

2144
01:35:10,284 --> 01:35:11,046
Hit me!

2145
01:35:11,085 --> 01:35:11,744
Oh, no!

2146
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:14,379
You're fast.

But l'm faster.

2148
