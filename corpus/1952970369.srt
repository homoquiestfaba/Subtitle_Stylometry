4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,500
And now Sylvester the Skyman brings you

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,001
up-to-the-minute traffic
from our WST news chopper.

6
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,200
Thanks, Pat.

7
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:42,401
Well, folks, we've got a massive jam heading
into and out of Star City International.

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,750
Blame it on all the added security
put in place for the royal arrival.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,300
Hey, it's not every day the crowned
Princess of Vlatava pays our city a visit.

10
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,100
- Cut her some--
- Cut me some.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,200
Hi, this is Dinah.

12
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,300
I can't get to the phone right now.
But I'll call you back.

13
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,900
Uh, hey, it's me.
I know it seems like I'm late again.

14
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:06,201
But I'll meet you in baggage claim. Bye.

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
Smooth, Queen. Real smooth.

16
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,900
I mean, would it have killed you to say:

17
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:11,801
"I love you. I can't live without you.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,700
"Please don't take a cab home"?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Oh, come on. The arrow's green. Move!

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,700
Whew. At least she's not waiting for a cab.

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,300
Wait a minute. I know that guy.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,500
Is that...?

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,800
Merlyn.

24
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,250
Princess Perdita has disembarked.

25
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,701
Her personal security detail
is bringing her out now.

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,750
Please stay behind the ropes.

27
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,800
This will just take a second, people.

28
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,501
We're sorry for the delay.

29
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,200
All clear.

30
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,800
Move! Move! Take her back up!

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,900
Sorry I'm late.

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,900
But you try changing clothes in a hybrid.

33
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,850
Green Arrow.
Justice League of America.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm here to help.

35
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, crap.

36
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,300
Okay, Princess.
Arms around my neck and don't let go.

37
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Merlyn, the bird has flown.
You have your green light.

38
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
Come on!

39
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,600
That dragon almost got us.

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,900
You do realize I'm 10,

41
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:27,600
and do not require fairy-tale metaphors?

42
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,500
Sorry. It's my first time rescuing royalty.

43
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:34,601
It is quite a forgivable sin...
Robin Hood.

44
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,500
Thanks, I, uh--

45
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,000
Your leg!

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Yeah. Minor setback. Unh.

47
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,500
You're being very brave, Princess.
I'm proud of you.

48
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:17,900
Can you make a bandage,
tie it around my leg?

49
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,601
Yes, of course.

50
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,000
Any idea why these guys are
trying to kill you, Princess?

51
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,300
Because I'm not a princess.

52
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,100
My father died last night.

53
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:31,601
I'm the queen now.

54
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,000
You're even braver than I thought.

55
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,100
Staying put's no longer an option,
Your Majesty.

56
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:42,301
- Get ready to run.
- You can run?

57
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,250
You've got an uncle, right? A Count?

58
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:49,850
My only living relative.
Count Werner Vertigo.

59
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,850
So if something happens to you--

60
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,901
He becomes King of Vlatava.

61
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,250
Now it all makes sense.

62
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,300
He's taken her back inside.
Inform the client.

63
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
Kill you! Kill you! Kill you!

64
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,200
Me? Weren't you after the kid?

65
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:37,300
Excuse me.

66
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,901
Kidding, Your Kidness. Kidding.

67
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,000
I got you! I got you!

68
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:57,101
No! Princess, let me go.

69
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,400
So, Arrow, once again
you've stumbled onto my stage...

70
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,400
...and horned in on my act.

71
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:20,100
That's me. Always hogging the limelight.

72
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:23,000
I seem to recall you lost our last duel.

73
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,901
All eight of our last duels.

74
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
- You lost?
- Yeah,

75
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,700
but I've been practicing. A lot.

76
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:31,950
One arrow each?

77
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:34,501
I accept your challenge. On three.

78
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,850
One.

79
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,400
Two.

80
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,400
- Three.
- Three.

81
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,300
[COUGHlNG] What...?

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
If you want something done right....

83
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,800
Vertigo.

84
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,100
Count Vertigo to you, peasant.

85
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Soon to be King Vertigo...

86
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,300
...once l've dispatched
you and the little bi--

87
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,601
Watch your mouth!

88
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,300
Ahh. What would you do without me?

89
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,300
Well, now that you mention it,

90
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:52,101
and since l'm on my knees anyway....

91
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,500
I can't live without you, babe. Literally.

92
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,600
Say yes. After all,
every queen needs a consort.

93
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:13,401
She's right. Every Queen does.

94
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,200
Yes. The answer is yes.
