1
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,286
Roll camera.

2
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:10,682
And... begin.

3
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:15,080
Nice pussy.

4
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:18,284
Nice pussy.

5
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:21,882
Miaow.

6
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,277
You're very content
right now, aren't you Ellen?

7
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:29,317
You live in a nice house...
You wear pretty clothes.

8
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,322
And you're married to a kind man
who's promised to love you forever.

9
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,724
You have no inkling of what lives
at the bottom of the flower box.

10
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:42,765
No sense of longing.

11
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:47,603
No notion even of death itself.

12
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,276
And...

13
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:57,918
...end. And print it.

14
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,159
Wolf, have we established pathos?

15
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,603
Perfectly, Herr Doctor.
And in one take.

16
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,438
Very well let's get the film
to the lab immediately.

17
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,485
I'II need to see rushes tomorrow
before the train in the morning.

18
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:15,557
Albin?

19
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:17,437
Yeah, Friedrich?

20
00:07:17,607 --> 00:07:19,040
Hurry and strike your set,
as you never

21
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:23,041
hesitate to remind me, it's costing
our investors a fortune daily.

22
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:25,482
Shooting outside the studios will
cost them much more, Friedrich.

23
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,603
But such is the price of genius.

24
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:30,156
Thank God, an end to this artifice.

25
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:40,519
Nicely done, Greta.

26
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:43,195
You are developing in a number
of lovely ways.

27
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:47,246
For a moment I even thought I saw a
premonition of evil cross your face.

28
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:50,797
It wouldn't surprise me with all the
spooky shit you've been saying to me.

29
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,606
I told you, it's important
for the realistic effect.

30
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,327
But why do we have
to leave Berlin just now,

31
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,239
at the start
of the theatre season?

32
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:00,682
-Albin, has your man arranged the cars?
-Yes, two.

33
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,760
Do you have any idea the parts I've
been offered at long last? The salaries?

34
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:05,882
Will that be enough?

35
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:08,800
It has to be... they're
the only cars in the region.

36
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,764
Herr Doctor, you're ignoring me.

37
00:08:11,727 --> 00:08:14,719
There was a time when you
didn't ignore me.

38
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:18,835
Why would you possibly want to act
in a play when you can act in a film?

39
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:22,444
Atheatrical audience gives me life,
while

40
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,757
this thing merely takes it from me.

41
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:27,763
Greta...

42
00:08:28,367 --> 00:08:30,517
Ellen is a woman who discovers...

43
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,599
the ultimate expression of love...

44
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,275
in the most exquisite pain imaginable.

45
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:40,400
Does that sound familiar?

46
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,119
It's a very demanding role.

47
00:08:46,127 --> 00:08:49,324
It is the role that will make you
great as an actress.

48
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,842
Consider it
a sacrifice for your art.

49
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,245
Work quickly, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a train to catch!

50
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,203
Hans...

51
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:02,764
Albin, what did you give the cat?

52
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:03,677
Laudanum.

53
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:04,883
Laudanum.

54
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,802
It's hard to keep the damn thing docile
under the lights. Why, did it show?

55
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:10,446
It looked a little pickled.

56
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:12,677
Not as much as Greta.

57
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,238
Things seem to be
well in hand here.

58
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:16,442
Friedrich.

59
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,322
Friedrich.

60
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,646
Friedrich, we have to talk
about the vampire.

61
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,082
Not now, Albin,
it's nearly dark.

62
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,084
Wrap things up for me here,
will you?

63
00:09:26,247 --> 00:09:29,080
Make sure the imbecile Gustav
does not miss the train.

64
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:30,925
And I'll see you all
in the morning.

65
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:32,760
But what kind of clothes
should I pack for him?

66
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,521
What kind of make-up?
How tall is he?

67
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:36,915
Please tell me, Friedrich?

68
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:40,484
Does anybody know
where he's running off to?

69
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:41,756
Perhaps he has a woman.

70
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:42,956
Or a man.

71
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:22,486
We cross the border into Czechoslovakia
a few hours into our journey.

72
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:25,559
Apparently Herr Doctor's already
filmed some of the exteriors there.

73
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:26,523
He has?

74
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:27,922
You didn't know?

75
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,277
No.

76
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:34,120
Strange. Well, you can assume we'll be
filming all of Hutter's scenes there.

77
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,357
The scenes between him
and the vampire.

78
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,240
I thought Dracula lived
in Transylvania.

79
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,363
Strictly speaking,
this is not Dracula.

80
00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:43,916
The author's widow wouldn't
sell us the rights to the novel.

81
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,920
So who's playing Count Dracula?
I mean, Orlock?

82
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:48,242
His name is Schreck.

83
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:51,640
Max Schreck.

84
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:58,044
Apparently he was in the Reinhardt
Company when Murnau was directing.

85
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,243
Schreck? Are you sure
you have the name right?

86
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,480
He's a character actor.

87
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,036
Who told you he was
playing the vampire?

88
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,162
Herr Doctor told me.

89
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,956
I never heard of any Max Schreck
in the Reinhardt Company.

90
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:12,159
Herr Doctor told me he was
with Stanislavsky in Moscow.

91
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:14,124
Oh dear, one of the
Russian school then.

92
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,238
As part of his preparation,
he submerges

93
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:19,877
his own personality into that
of the character he's playing.

94
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,719
That is why he's not travelling
with us.

95
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:25,675
Herr Doctor told me he went
to Czechoslovakia weeks ago.

96
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:28,805
To absorb the flavour of the place,
I suppose.

97
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:30,800
Herr Doctor also told me...

98
00:11:31,327 --> 00:11:33,966
that when we get there
and start filming...

99
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:38,006
Max Schreck will only appear to us
in full make-up and costume...

100
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:40,079
as the vampire.

101
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,277
And furthermore...

102
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,885
we will only film him at night.

103
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,565
And why wasn't I told about it?
I'm the producer.

104
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:51,600
Well, he told me.

105
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,406
Tell me you're not too pretty
to work for me?

106
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,522
Yes, sir.

107
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:12,166
I love the cinema.

108
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:16,206
Friedrich, I just realised this morning,
our financiers, they don't know

109
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,881
what picture you're making.

110
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,437
The crew don't know
what picture you're making.

111
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,245
The cast don't know
what picture you're making.

112
00:12:23,407 --> 00:12:27,036
And now I don't know what picture
you're making. Are you happy?

113
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:27,798
Albin...

114
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,799
I know, tell them nothing.

115
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:32,117
-Ah, yeah, there he is.
-There he is, getting on the train.

116
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:35,726
Gentlemen, I amn Albin Grau,

117
00:12:35,927 --> 00:12:39,237
producer and art director
of this picture.

118
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:41,881
Is it true Murnau is filming
Stoker's Dracula?

119
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:45,915
Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau is Germany's
greatest film maker.

120
00:12:46,087 --> 00:12:47,918
In a class with such masters

121
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,398
as Griffith and Eisenstein.

122
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,837
At present he is supervising
every detail

123
00:12:53,087 --> 00:12:55,806
of this unique
on location expedition.

124
00:12:56,727 --> 00:12:59,446
-The major part, who's going to play?
-Excuse me. Excuse me.

125
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,757
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-Will you be filming in Germany?

126
00:13:24,687 --> 00:13:26,120
Paul, Paul.

127
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,919
Our battle, our struggle,

128
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:47,315
is to create art

129
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:49,884
Our weapon is the moving picture.

130
00:13:52,127 --> 00:13:54,561
Because we have the moving picture...

131
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:57,287
our paintings
will grow and recede.

132
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:59,557
Our poetry will be shadows

133
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,797
that lengthen and conceal.

134
00:14:02,447 --> 00:14:04,915
Our light will play
across living faces

135
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:07,442
that laugh and agonise.

136
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:12,363
And our music will linger
and finally overwhelm

137
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,563
because it will have a context.

138
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,082
As certain as the grave.

139
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:25,045
We are scientists engaged
in the creation of memory.

140
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:28,600
But our memory

141
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,520
will neither blur... nor fade.

142
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,282
What is this?

143
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,762
It looks like... blood.

144
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,235
Good evening.

145
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,279
Herr Doctor...

146
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,839
we've been expecting you.

147
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,758
-The wagon train has arrived.
-And here's the lead mule.

148
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:34,563
Well, what a terrible
journey that was.

149
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,841
How long have you been here?

150
00:15:37,047 --> 00:15:37,843
Not long.

151
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,998
Don't tell me, we have
a busy schedule tomorrow?

152
00:15:40,167 --> 00:15:41,964
No. Exterior shots of the inn.

153
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:44,322
Some shots in here.
Arrival of Hutter's carriage.

154
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:45,886
Welcome.

155
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:46,917
Welcome.

156
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:51,560
I'd like to plan for these night scenes.
When are they to be filmed?

157
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:55,084
They will be filmed soon...
They won't require...

158
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,045
much planning.

159
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:00,600
But I need extra help
to set up the lights.

160
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,120
Surely you can give me
some notice so I can prepare?

161
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,484
Herr Doctor,
where are the extras?

162
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,486
You're looking at them.

163
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,679
Herr Doctor,
hese people cannot act.

164
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:13,561
They don't need to act.
They need to be.

165
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,122
Wolf?

166
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,561
Herr Muller?

167
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:38,358
I was... Sorry, Wolf.

168
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:28,483
All right, Hutter, it's been a fitful
night but you wake refreshed...

169
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:32,516
eager to continue your journey to
the castle of the nobleman

170
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:35,042
who may very well make
your fortune.

171
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,916
Wait, Gustav.
What is that beside you?

172
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,685
Yes, pick it up.

173
00:18:44,927 --> 00:18:47,395
It's a book...
about vampires.

174
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,521
Ah... yes...

175
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:52,842
now you remember.

176
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,726
It was put there last night by the
superstitious peasants, the ones

177
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,562
who warned you not
to enter Orlock's castle.

178
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:05,242
The ones who warned you
not even to dare to speak his name...

179
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:07,841
Nosferatu.

180
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:11,516
The unclean, the undead...

181
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:15,037
least you evoke
the creature itself.

182
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,880
Very good, Gustav

183
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,516
Herr Doctor...

184
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:21,563
Albin...

185
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,604
-I am sorry, Herr Doctor, but...
-Albin!

186
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:24,757
End.

187
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:28,636
Albin, a native has wandered
into my frame!

188
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:36,758
Wolf.

189
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:38,877
Wolf!

190
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,157
What is the matter with everyone?

191
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:46,002
She will not let us go on filming,
unless we replace the crosses.

192
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:48,522
Am I really
being bothered with this?

193
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,200
Herr Doctor, I warned you.

194
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:54,119
You should be more concerned
about these things.

195
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,724
The crosses are not for decoration.

196
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,405
We will put them back.

197
00:20:00,087 --> 00:20:02,396
They just overwhelm
our composition.

198
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:07,875
Albin, the camera.

199
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:11,716
-The head light should be sufficient.
-Henrik, what's this scene number?

200
00:20:11,887 --> 00:20:12,956
Twenty-three.

201
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:14,197
Quickly.

202
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:18,646
Yes... Albin, that's fine,
he'll take care of it.

203
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:19,956
Go in, Henrik.

204
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:23,085
On either side, you open the door
when I give you the cue.

205
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,039
Ready? Are we ready?

206
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:26,242
Yeah, yeah.

207
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,316
And roll camera.

208
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,960
Iris in.

209
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:31,837
And...

210
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:34,562
...begin.

211
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:36,843
Gustav, you walk in very slowly.

212
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:39,837
Very slowly... yes.

213
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,725
Feel your bag, make sure
you have your contracts.

214
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:47,161
You're afraid.

215
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,364
Who was the person
who brought you?

216
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:53,759
You must go into the castle.

217
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,246
The castle calls you...

218
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,642
The gates suddenly open.

219
00:21:01,207 --> 00:21:02,481
You must go in.

220
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:05,199
That's excellent, Gustav.

221
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:07,685
Go forward.

222
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,400
Go forward.

223
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:15,000
And, end.

224
00:21:15,287 --> 00:21:16,003
Wolf?

225
00:21:16,247 --> 00:21:17,157
Yeah, it's okay.

226
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:22,046
I'm in charge of set construction. Who
built all this? We have an agreement!

227
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:25,836
Albin, I sent some local workers
ahead this morning.

228
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:28,043
I'm sorry I didn't explain to you.

229
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:30,038
Please, there's a generator
in the courtyard,

230
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,846
just past the tree on the right,
in the background. Get it working.

231
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,486
Henrik, take this camera.

232
00:21:34,647 --> 00:21:37,639
-We have an agreement!
-Yes, stay here for a moment.

233
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:41,715
Wolf, your camera is here.
Set it up quickly as possible. Yes?

234
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,075
Roll camera.

235
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:55,882
Gustav...

236
00:21:56,407 --> 00:22:00,116
you move forward very slowly,
heading always for the tunnel.

237
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:03,766
This is perfect.

238
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:05,920
Just a dark hole...

239
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:09,804
...that has been unexplored,
untouched...

240
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,158
... for a long, long time.

241
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:16,642
And then...

242
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,043
one night...

243
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:22,282
something crawls out.

244
00:22:28,127 --> 00:22:29,162
Hutter...

245
00:22:31,047 --> 00:22:32,685
meet Count Orlock.

246
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:21,597
Gustav, you must follow him
into the tunnel.

247
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:31,917
Yes, going in.

248
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,161
Make your way down.

249
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:38,237
And...

250
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:40,597
...end.

251
00:23:50,447 --> 00:23:51,243
Wolf?

252
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:56,562
My God.

253
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:58,277
Wolf!

254
00:23:59,327 --> 00:24:00,646
Yeah, got it.

255
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:03,076
Remarkable.

256
00:24:03,447 --> 00:24:06,405
The overture to our
symphony of horrors.

257
00:24:06,607 --> 00:24:09,167
Genius, Hutter. Genius.

258
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,358
He's not from the
Reinhardt Company.

259
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:20,077
Congratulations, Gustav.

260
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:24,483
Yes...

261
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,925
I was good, wasn't I?

262
00:24:27,407 --> 00:24:29,363
I saw his face...
his face.

263
00:24:31,287 --> 00:24:33,164
Where did you find him, really?

264
00:24:34,127 --> 00:24:35,446
In that hole.

265
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:36,676
Gustav...

266
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:38,838
this was your finest moment.

267
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,156
Good, Gustav.

268
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:43,637
Gentlemen, let's pack up.
Shooting is completed for the night.

269
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:46,367
That's it? We came all the way
for one scene?

270
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:50,721
I would have driven anywhere at
any time for that look of Gustav's.

271
00:24:50,887 --> 00:24:53,924
I would like to congratulate Schreck
on his extraordinary appearance.

272
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:57,085
For the remainder of the shoot,
he will be Count Orlock.

273
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:59,124
To himself and to all of us.

274
00:24:59,567 --> 00:25:02,400
Just leave the man alone.
He will be completely authentic.

275
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,401
He is not interested in our questions,
or our praise, or our conversations.

276
00:25:06,727 --> 00:25:09,002
He's chasing an altogether
different ghost.

277
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:12,237
Friedrich. Come quick, it's Wolf!

278
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:19,765
Muller, I can help you.

279
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:22,438
Help me.

280
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:36,639
Albin, you have the cameras safe?

281
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,200
Go, quickly.

282
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,397
-Is my room ready?
-Yes.

283
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:07,276
Nosferatu.

284
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:10,125
Ah, this is too much.

285
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:14,356
Answer me, Herr Doctor. Is this
some stunt to evoke fear in us?

286
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:17,798
Henrik, stop being so theatrical.
You'll wake the whole house.

287
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:21,044
Go on up, Wolf, and have a brandy.
You'll feel better in the morning.

288
00:26:23,887 --> 00:26:25,115
What's happened?

289
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,603
He's ill, obviously.
Take him upstairs

290
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:31,396
and then go outside and help Herr
Grau with the camera equipment.

291
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:33,435
All right? Come on.

292
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:35,438
Bring the cameras
straight to my room...

293
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:36,960
prepare for tomorrow.

294
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,918
Albin, we need to clear the table.
We'll need the ink-well,

295
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:56,681
the quill,

296
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,200
and the contracts.

297
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:02,963
Yes, I...

298
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:04,640
I'd like it darker
and smokier. Dustier.

299
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:09,005
Which case, Paul? Move
that lamp to the far side and...

300
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,806
and you, spread some dust
on the corner. On the...

301
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:34,081
Ah, there you are.

302
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:40,756
It's incredible, no?
I wish you could all see your faces.

303
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Max Schreck

304
00:27:44,087 --> 00:27:46,840
who will be portraying
our vampire, Count Orlock.

305
00:27:47,127 --> 00:27:50,278
As you no doubt have heard,
Max's methods are somewhat...

306
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:52,440
unconventional.

307
00:27:52,607 --> 00:27:55,485
But, I am sure you will come

308
00:27:55,727 --> 00:27:59,037
to respect his artistry in this
matter.

309
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,964
Yes, places everybody.

310
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:04,402
May I have the chair, please?
Quickly.

311
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:07,445
Count Orlock, you will sit here
at the head of the table.

312
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:08,723
Please.

313
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:10,922
Very good.

314
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:15,400
In this scene, the Count is reading
the papers you've brought him...

315
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:20,121
and you are about to make a
considerable amount of money.

316
00:28:21,527 --> 00:28:22,846
No, no make-up!

317
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:26,160
Forgive me, Herr Doctor.

318
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:27,919
Albin clear the set!

319
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:30,003
Elke...

320
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:38,078
Count, you're reading
your documents.

321
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:40,396
That's it.

322
00:28:40,607 --> 00:28:42,040
It isn't right.

323
00:28:43,007 --> 00:28:45,567
Well, try acting it,
for God's sake.

324
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:46,802
What should it say?

325
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:49,237
It's meant to be a contract...

326
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:51,645
a real estate contract.

327
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,645
I'd like some make-up.

328
00:28:54,927 --> 00:28:56,485
Well, you don't get any.

329
00:28:56,807 --> 00:28:58,923
All right, are we ready to begin?

330
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,359
Elke, the phonograph.

331
00:29:11,127 --> 00:29:12,640
Iris in.

332
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:14,923
And...

333
00:29:16,207 --> 00:29:17,481
concentrate...

334
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:19,482
begin.

335
00:29:20,327 --> 00:29:23,160
All right, Orlock, very good.
You are reading your papers.

336
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,477
Read your papers very intensely.

337
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:30,761
After all, how often is it that you
get correspondence from the living?

338
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,442
No, don't look up.
Concentrate on your papers.

339
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:37,763
Not that you actually care about
the details of the contract.

340
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:42,566
All you're interested in are all
those juicy throats waiting for you

341
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:44,565
the moment you get to Germany.

342
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:48,963
Ah now, Hutter,
even though it may repel you...

343
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:51,516
creep in... creep in.

344
00:29:52,487 --> 00:29:54,762
Let us see the expectation
on your face.

345
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:57,361
You're about to make
the biggest sale of your life.

346
00:29:57,807 --> 00:30:01,436
Point out a few details
of the contract. Yes...

347
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,200
Tell him that, that's
particularly beneficial to you.

348
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,525
Reach into your bag.

349
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:10,525
This will seal the deal
and something falls out.

350
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:14,279
Count, what is it?
On your left, on the table.

351
00:30:14,807 --> 00:30:15,842
It's a locket.

352
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:23,805
This is Greta Schroder.

353
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:25,406
No, no, you don't know her.

354
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:26,596
He's supposed to ask who it is.

355
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,916
No... End.

356
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,126
Jesus, Max...

357
00:30:44,287 --> 00:30:46,403
Henrik, can you explain to him...

358
00:30:46,727 --> 00:30:48,240
his motivation?

359
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,565
All right, Count...

360
00:30:50,887 --> 00:30:52,559
think about this...

361
00:30:53,647 --> 00:30:55,797
What is it that inspires...

362
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,121
the most longing in you?

363
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:00,723
That is most desirable...

364
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:03,125
and yet most unattainable?

365
00:31:04,167 --> 00:31:06,635
The light... of the sun.

366
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:10,522
That is the emotion. Use it.

367
00:31:12,527 --> 00:31:15,519
Nosferatu, you read your papers.
Roll, bitte.

368
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:25,480
Who is this woman?

369
00:31:25,847 --> 00:31:27,758
It's Ellen, my wife.

370
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:31,200
She has a beautiful bosom.

371
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:32,604
Oh Jesus...

372
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,803
Gustav, just snatch it back
from him.

373
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:36,201
Yes. Go on.

374
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:38,239
And, vampire, you sign the papers.

375
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:40,597
Take your quill,
sign the papers.

376
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:42,555
Yes, go on.

377
00:31:46,847 --> 00:31:50,840
I understand we are going
to be neighbours.

378
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:00,525
Very nice addition, Count. Yes.

379
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,038
And, Hutter,
how does that make you feel?

380
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:06,756
Yes. Snatch back your papers.
You're happy to be his neighbour?

381
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,280
And, iris out.

382
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:14,923
End!

383
00:32:15,927 --> 00:32:17,155
Excellent.

384
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:20,041
Excellent.

385
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,878
Give the lip-readers a thrill.

386
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:25,440
Wolf, do you have it?

387
00:32:25,687 --> 00:32:26,881
Yes, I got it.

388
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,122
Wolf, have you got it?

389
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,205
Yes, I said I got it!

390
00:32:30,687 --> 00:32:32,166
Excellent. Thank you.

391
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:46,239
Do you think Schreck is all right?
We have left him up at that castle.

392
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,565
He's not in danger.

393
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:52,324
He's a fine actor, but,
all this preparation,

394
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:54,239
it's very strange.

395
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:57,764
You think it is strange enough for him
to go so deep inside his character

396
00:32:57,927 --> 00:32:59,758
that he forgets he's
Max Schreck altogether?

397
00:32:59,927 --> 00:33:01,121
God knows I forgot.

398
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,080
Schreck's peculiarities are
like love-making games.

399
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:07,000
You believe them
when they happen

400
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:10,079
but they always stop short of
anybody being seriously hurt.

401
00:33:33,047 --> 00:33:34,799
The woods decay...

402
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,319
the woods decay and fall...

403
00:33:41,127 --> 00:33:43,163
the vapours weep their burthen

404
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,756
to the ground.

405
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:48,282
Dinner?

406
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:52,915
You set a very mean table.

407
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,966
No rats?

408
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,406
There was a time...

409
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:08,401
when I fed...

410
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,085
from golden chalices.

411
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:13,401
But now...

412
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:15,925
Don't look at me that way!

413
00:34:18,127 --> 00:34:21,324
In my old age I feed...

414
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:25,566
the way old men pee.

415
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:29,681
Sometimes all at once...

416
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:34,684
sometimes drop by drop.

417
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:39,280
I told you...

418
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,679
I feed erratically...

419
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,885
often enormously.

420
00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:59,356
Yes, Max, you may give
the locket to Elke.

421
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:03,242
Gustav, this is a scene from
the previous night. You have met

422
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,917
your host he has brought you home
to his castle, he's giving you a dinner.

423
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:09,201
You can start eating.

424
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:13,163
Very well. Excellent. And, Orlock,
you're merely reading your papers

425
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,881
and totally ignoring your guest.

426
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:17,997
Good.

427
00:35:18,607 --> 00:35:20,518
Wolf, roll camera...

428
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:22,323
and...

429
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:25,003
begin.

430
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,077
Yes.

431
00:35:30,447 --> 00:35:32,005
A thought occurs to you.

432
00:35:32,727 --> 00:35:34,957
Iook at your host.
Very good, Gustav.

433
00:35:36,207 --> 00:35:37,196
Do you think...

434
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:41,757
he might have been the stranger
who drove you to the castle?

435
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:46,475
You watch...
is he even human?

436
00:35:47,527 --> 00:35:50,360
How does it feel to be
eating next to him?

437
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,322
Knowing that you're spending
the night with him...

438
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,637
in the castle, alone.

439
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:00,202
You watch him.

440
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,685
Orlock, drop your paper.
You look at Gustav.

441
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:07,724
Gustav, keep watching him.

442
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,561
Take your right hand
and reach for the bread knife.

443
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:12,123
Watch him...

444
00:36:13,367 --> 00:36:14,356
breathing.

445
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,486
What will happen?

446
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:21,119
Reach out, take the loaf of bread...

447
00:36:21,887 --> 00:36:23,559
and cut yourself a slice.

448
00:36:26,927 --> 00:36:29,566
Yes, slicing, slicing...

449
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:30,956
You are slicing.

450
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,885
Ttoward you, toward you...

451
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:35,316
watching him...

452
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:38,286
...slicing, slicing,
watch out...

453
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:39,842
slicing...

454
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,725
Watch your finger!

455
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:42,804
Damn it!

456
00:36:44,807 --> 00:36:47,640
Look, Nosferatu!
Blood, blood!

457
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,721
Damn it, Murnau.
I really did cut myself!

458
00:36:52,927 --> 00:36:55,157
-Paul, go and check the generator.
-You did that intentionally!

459
00:36:55,327 --> 00:36:56,919
-Calm down!
-I'll see to the light.

460
00:36:57,087 --> 00:36:59,840
-That knife was sharpened like a razor!
-Gustav, remain in character!

461
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:04,159
Jesus Christus get this off me!

462
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:09,363
Schreck!

463
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:13,639
What is the matter with you?

464
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:16,759
He's a Stanislavsky lunatic, that is
what is the matter with him!

465
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:20,920
I contracted you in secrecy
and at great expense.

466
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:25,601
Herr Muller, when will you have your
equipment functioning properly?

467
00:37:25,887 --> 00:37:29,004
I am tired of your
lack of enthusiasm!

468
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,236
I saw you.

469
00:37:30,887 --> 00:37:31,842
Gustav...

470
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:34,085
bring the girls to the car.

471
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:37,367
-I am not happy!
-Gustav, move.

472
00:37:37,687 --> 00:37:39,405
Herr Doctor,
the man is barely breathing.

473
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:42,482
I told you to fix the generator!

474
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,757
No, leave the equipment
and take the camera.

475
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,685
We are done here for today,
Herr Doctor.

476
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:47,484
Albin!

477
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:48,204
Help me.

478
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,635
Everybody to the automobile.

479
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:52,045
Herr Doctor, we're leaving.

480
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:54,563
No...

481
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:55,961
He stays.

482
00:39:27,847 --> 00:39:28,677
Albin...

483
00:39:41,887 --> 00:39:42,842
Yes, Friedrich?

484
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,726
Do you think Wolf's assistant
can finish this film?

485
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:49,477
Paul? No. He has
not enough experience.

486
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,441
What about you?

487
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:54,397
You are the closest we have
to a photographer.

488
00:39:54,887 --> 00:39:58,118
What are you talking about?
The film ends here.

489
00:39:58,607 --> 00:39:59,835
No, Henrik...

490
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,560
this film will go on.

491
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:05,402
Henrik, this film cannot survive
even the briefest interruption.

492
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:07,876
The financiers would take control.

493
00:40:08,047 --> 00:40:09,480
They hate your script.

494
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:13,601
Actually, it may be advantageous
because it makes the crew very edgy

495
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:14,995
and I like that.

496
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,202
Do you hear
what you are saying?

497
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:18,164
You're out of your fucking mind,
you're a fanatic!

498
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:20,677
Please, don't behave like children.

499
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,716
I'll get a new photographer and fly
him back here within the week.

500
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:29,283
Henrik, when you wrote
this scenario,

501
00:40:29,447 --> 00:40:33,235
you had demons of your own
to work out, did you not?

502
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:34,880
Now I have mine.

503
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:38,083
Albin...

504
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:42,403
you're the producer...
keep this company together.

505
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:06,080
How dare you
destroy my photographer!

506
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:07,602
You idiot!

507
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:11,876
Did I kill some
of your people, Murnau?

508
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,759
I can't remember.

509
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:16,764
We have an arrangement!

510
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:21,519
Don't pretend you mourn,
Herr Doctor. I know you.

511
00:41:26,127 --> 00:41:27,845
Why him, you monster?

512
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:30,561
Why not the script girl?

513
00:41:33,927 --> 00:41:35,280
The script girl...

514
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:38,276
I'll eat her later.

515
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:39,916
No, you will not!

516
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:43,477
Our bargain, you agreed
not to hurt my people!

517
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:46,959
Listen to me,
do you understand?

518
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:49,960
This requires that
I go back to Berlin

519
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:53,876
to find another photographer
and then to fly him back here.

520
00:41:54,367 --> 00:41:56,597
And you will control yourself
while I am away.

521
00:41:59,647 --> 00:42:03,481
I don't think we need
the writer any longer.

522
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,443
I don't expect you
to understand this

523
00:42:09,607 --> 00:42:12,997
and I am loathed
to admit it myself...

524
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,727
but, the writer is necessary.

525
00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:18,636
All my crew is necessary.

526
00:42:19,567 --> 00:42:20,636
Do you understand?

527
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:25,719
I don't think the ship is necessary.

528
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:29,963
What?

529
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:31,276
The ship...

530
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:35,842
The ship?

531
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,725
My God, what
are you talking about?

532
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:42,521
I have a dozen scenes on the ship.

533
00:42:43,967 --> 00:42:46,435
But I won't sail.

534
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,481
Then I will replace you
with a double!

535
00:42:50,727 --> 00:42:53,002
I will do every scene
of yours with a double.

536
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:56,762
You, you will have no close-ups.
None whatsoever.

537
00:42:57,087 --> 00:42:58,805
How dare you speak
to me that way.

538
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:02,284
I have shots!
I am the director!

539
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,116
Why didn't you mention this before?

540
00:43:12,687 --> 00:43:15,155
You want to eat the writer?
Be my guest.

541
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:17,477
That will leave you to explain

542
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:20,241
how else your character
is supposed to get to Bremen?

543
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:26,203
Yes...

544
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,882
I will...

545
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:31,121
shoot the scenes at sea
around you.

546
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:34,002
But you will still have
to sail to Heligoland

547
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:36,283
for your death scene.

548
00:43:38,487 --> 00:43:40,045
Or else what?

549
00:43:41,127 --> 00:43:42,116
Or else?

550
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,197
Or else...

551
00:43:44,527 --> 00:43:45,482
...no Greta.

552
00:43:46,327 --> 00:43:48,443
We shoot her scenes there.

553
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:57,963
I'll go to Heligoland...

554
00:43:58,807 --> 00:44:00,718
but I won't sail.

555
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,159
Heligoland is an island.

556
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:05,203
So?

557
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:07,881
So it can only be reached by sea.

558
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:11,001
Or air.

559
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:24,440
And if I agree to fly you in...

560
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:27,683
you will leave my people alone.

561
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,041
Or else what?

562
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,480
Don't think I can't harm you.

563
00:44:33,327 --> 00:44:35,238
Tell me how you would harm me...

564
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:39,399
when even I don't know
how I could harm myself.

565
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:15,523
But thy strong hours indignant
work'd their wills...

566
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:18,045
and beat me down...

567
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:21,037
and marr'd and wasted me...

568
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:25,525
and though
they could not end me...

569
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:29,243
left me maim'd to dwell

570
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:32,524
in presence
of immortal youth.

571
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:37,005
Immortal age...

572
00:45:37,687 --> 00:45:39,962
beside immortal youth.

573
00:45:42,647 --> 00:45:45,400
And all I was in ashes.

574
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:30,479
Albin, what is

575
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,076
the most wondrous thing
you have ever seen?

576
00:46:33,247 --> 00:46:33,918
Er...

577
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:37,127
I saw ectoplasm once.

578
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:40,042
Ectoplasm?
What is ectoplasm?

579
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:43,324
It's the mystical
substance of ghosts.

580
00:46:43,487 --> 00:46:47,366
I saw a spiritualist pull it out
of his mouth in Italy.

581
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:48,886
What did it look like?

582
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:51,121
Seaweed.

583
00:46:52,207 --> 00:46:54,243
Is that what we look like
when we die?

584
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:55,635
I hope not.

585
00:46:56,567 --> 00:47:00,765
What was for you the most,
wondrous thing you ever saw?

586
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,078
I once saw Greta Schroeder naked.

587
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,157
No?

588
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:07,964
Yes.

589
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,239
That beats ectoplasm.

590
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:14,196
Jesus, Max, you scared me to death.

591
00:47:14,527 --> 00:47:16,358
How long have you been listening?

592
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:19,323
We've been looking all over
the place for your coffin.

593
00:47:20,287 --> 00:47:22,164
Maybe it isn't his resting place.

594
00:47:26,607 --> 00:47:28,245
Didn't we have
something to say to him?

595
00:47:30,687 --> 00:47:34,157
Max, the great Friedrich Wilhelm
Murnau went to Berlin

596
00:47:34,527 --> 00:47:38,315
-to find a new photographer.
-Wolf is probably dead.

597
00:47:39,087 --> 00:47:41,078
So you can take
your funny ears off.

598
00:47:41,487 --> 00:47:44,285
Albin, please,
the man is an artist.

599
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,364
Ask him some vampire questions.

600
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:49,243
When did you become
a vampire?

601
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:50,762
I can't recall.

602
00:47:52,127 --> 00:47:54,436
Where were you born?
Were you born?

603
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:56,598
I can't remember.

604
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:00,438
It's not funny any more.

605
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:03,326
Count Dracula wouldn't say,
"couldn't remember".

606
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:05,285
I read that book.

607
00:48:05,807 --> 00:48:08,196
Murnau gave it to me.

608
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:14,482
Now, this is a golden opportunity.
Speaking as a vampire,

609
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:17,445
what do you make
of the book's technical merits?

610
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:19,205
It made me sad.

611
00:48:19,687 --> 00:48:20,563
Why sad?

612
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:25,086
Because Dracula
had no servants.

613
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:29,876
I think you missed the point
of the book, Count Orlock.

614
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,358
Dracula... hasn't had servants
in four hundred years.

615
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,995
And then a man comes
to his ancestral home

616
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:38,159
and he must convince him
that he,

617
00:48:38,487 --> 00:48:41,559
that he's like the man.

618
00:48:42,207 --> 00:48:43,720
He has to feed him...

619
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,003
when he himself

620
00:48:46,207 --> 00:48:48,437
hasn't eaten food in centuries.

621
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:53,000
Can he even remember
how to buy bread?

622
00:48:53,447 --> 00:48:55,881
How to select cheese and wine?

623
00:48:56,127 --> 00:48:59,244
And then he remembers
the rest of it,...

624
00:49:00,127 --> 00:49:03,005
how to prepare a meal,
how to make a bed.

625
00:49:04,487 --> 00:49:05,602
He remembers...

626
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:08,125
his past glory

627
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,041
his armies, his retainers,

628
00:49:11,207 --> 00:49:13,437
and what he is reduced to.

629
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:18,835
The Ioneliest part
of the book...

630
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:21,918
comes when the man...

631
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:26,681
accidentally sees Dracula...

632
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:29,521
setting his table.

633
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,000
But if you're so Ionely

634
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:38,840
why don't you make more vampires?

635
00:49:40,247 --> 00:49:43,364
I can't, I'm too old.

636
00:49:46,047 --> 00:49:47,446
Although...

637
00:49:47,687 --> 00:49:51,043
I seem to remember
I was never able to.

638
00:49:52,487 --> 00:49:54,762
Then how did you become
a vampire?

639
00:49:54,927 --> 00:49:56,042
It was woman.

640
00:49:56,847 --> 00:49:59,042
Now we're getting somewhere.

641
00:50:10,887 --> 00:50:13,242
Schreck,the German theatre

642
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:14,841
needs you.

643
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:22,202
We were together in the night
and then she left me.

644
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:25,923
At first I had a painting
of her in wood.

645
00:50:26,287 --> 00:50:29,324
Then I had a relief of her in marble.
And then...

646
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:33,800
I had a picture of her,
in my mind.

647
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:38,596
But now I no longer
even have that.

648
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,003
What was I saying?

649
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:52,919
This schnapps they make
in these parts.

650
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:59,045
I haven't tasted it in...

651
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:03,725
Take it easy there,
old boy.

652
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,396
Henrik...

653
00:51:19,807 --> 00:51:21,240
what an actor.

654
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:23,396
Yeah.

655
00:51:24,607 --> 00:51:25,801
Dedication.

656
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:33,962
Herr Schreck.

657
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:20,802
Herr Doctor.

658
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:24,002
Herr Doctor.

659
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,683
You wanted reality,
Herr Doctor, here it is.

660
00:52:27,847 --> 00:52:31,078
Ah, I'm not a doctor, but I have
dabbled in pharmaceuticals.

661
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:32,925
-You're the new cameraman, right?
-Yeah.

662
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:35,078
-We tried shoot it now.
-Ah, good.

663
00:52:35,247 --> 00:52:37,841
-Art can never move as fast as life.
-Sure it can.

664
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:40,886
So, what's the lens?

665
00:52:41,047 --> 00:52:42,480
It's thirty-five millimetre, sir.

666
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:45,559
Not my ideal weapon of choice,
but I suppose it'll do...

667
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:46,443
Are you loaded?

668
00:52:46,607 --> 00:52:48,325
-Yes, sir.
-Good, so am I.

669
00:52:48,527 --> 00:52:50,518
Move the camera ten centimetres
to the right

670
00:52:50,687 --> 00:52:52,917
and I'll contrive a possible two
shot, but, wait for my signal.

671
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,284
-Did you get the shot?
-Yes, sir.

672
00:53:03,447 --> 00:53:04,641
And the gate is clean?

673
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:05,796
The gate's clean, sir.

674
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:10,677
I hadn't time to properly prepare
the shot...

675
00:53:11,207 --> 00:53:14,040
What I should have done was filmed
the thing in slow motion.

676
00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,203
It would have been
incredibly moving.

677
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:18,045
What's that, sir, slow motion?

678
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,721
Well I run the film through
the camera too fast...

679
00:53:20,927 --> 00:53:25,000
When it's projected at normal speed,
things appear to be unnaturally slow.

680
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:27,836
Gives everything
a kind of resonance.

681
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,285
It's a shame you won't have
the chance to demonstrate

682
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:34,086
your more esoteric skills
on my production.

683
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:38,401
I'm Albin Grau, he producer.

684
00:53:39,487 --> 00:53:42,081
And at dawn, Hutter tried to fathom

685
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,437
the horrors of his nights.

686
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:45,877
Excellent.

687
00:53:46,447 --> 00:53:48,085
Fritz, roll camera.

688
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:56,236
Iris in.

689
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:00,083
Begin.

690
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:26,646
And end.

691
00:54:26,807 --> 00:54:28,206
Excellent, Gustav.

692
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:31,559
Extraordinary discipline
in the face of ridicule.

693
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,477
Fritz?

694
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:36,397
Yes, well,
that's his performance style.

695
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,724
Yes, I'd like to move in
for another angle on the crypt.

696
00:54:39,887 --> 00:54:41,764
Mark the shot
with some chalk.

697
00:54:43,007 --> 00:54:46,363
I am exhausted now,
and I'm hungry as well.

698
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:50,076
You will get a hot meal in Wismar
right after we're done with the ship.

699
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:20,766
And, end.

700
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,360
Have you ever
considered acting?

701
00:56:25,527 --> 00:56:27,677
No, really, you have
a very interesting face.

702
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:28,757
Are you a producer?

703
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,317
Why can't Herr Doctor film in a
studio like everybody else?

704
00:56:32,687 --> 00:56:35,485
Henrik, would you take my dog
for me?

705
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:40,444
-And thank you. Lovely.
-Yes.

706
00:56:41,247 --> 00:56:43,556
Wismar, is there anything here

707
00:56:43,727 --> 00:56:46,400
that even vaguely resembles
a cabaret?

708
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:49,240
I mean, I'm suffering for my
art, Albin, believe me.

709
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:51,881
what's going on here, anyway?

710
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:55,397
You know, Friedrich tells me
to lock my door at night.

711
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:57,558
And Gustav says
everybody's vanishing.

712
00:56:58,567 --> 00:57:00,683
And you can imagine what
they're saying in Berlin.

713
00:57:01,767 --> 00:57:02,836
Hello, Greta.

714
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:05,083
Hello.

715
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:10,517
You look vaguely familiar.
Where did we meet?

716
00:57:10,967 --> 00:57:11,922
Morocco.

717
00:57:14,927 --> 00:57:18,044
-Yes, you brought me treats.
-Ja, ja.

718
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:20,360
What was your name again?

719
00:57:20,527 --> 00:57:21,323
It's...

720
00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:24,315
Fritzie.

721
00:57:24,847 --> 00:57:26,917
-Fritzie.
-Yes, Fritzie.

722
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:29,917
Fritzie?

723
00:57:30,247 --> 00:57:33,125
-Would you care tojoin us for a drink?
-No, no.

724
00:57:33,327 --> 00:57:35,795
We have to pre-light the set,
yeah?

725
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:40,036
What? What set? What the hell
are you talking about?

726
00:57:40,287 --> 00:57:43,404
We need you to see the sets
with us tonight.

727
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:45,404
Well, give me back
my dogs then.

728
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:47,677
Here.

729
00:57:47,927 --> 00:57:49,519
-Thank you, yes.
-You're welcome.

730
00:57:50,327 --> 00:57:52,795
Left all alone as usual.

731
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,280
Come here, Fru-Fru.

732
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:12,920
She's here, isn't she?

733
00:58:14,127 --> 00:58:15,845
The glorious child.

734
00:58:20,327 --> 00:58:21,077
No.

735
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:22,805
I want to see her now.

736
00:58:23,007 --> 00:58:23,803
No!

737
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,596
I won't act for you again
until you bring her to me.

738
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:30,201
You are destroying everything.

739
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:34,280
My people have to trust me
for you to get what you want!

740
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:38,122
You and I are not so different.

741
00:58:40,047 --> 00:58:42,277
Greta is in your last scene,

742
00:58:42,527 --> 00:58:44,438
that is when you can have her.

743
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:46,680
After my death scene?

744
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:47,603
Yes.

745
00:58:48,047 --> 00:58:50,561
Don't expect realism there,
Murnau.

746
00:58:50,767 --> 00:58:51,961
What do you mean?

747
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:54,197
Don't cheat me, mortal.

748
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,438
You will stay away
from her.

749
00:58:56,607 --> 00:58:59,360
You will stay away
from my crew!

750
00:58:59,647 --> 00:59:02,241
I will finish my picture!

751
00:59:03,447 --> 00:59:06,120
This is hardly your picture
any longer.

752
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:44,242
You are ready?

753
00:59:44,447 --> 00:59:45,243
Yes, Henrik.

754
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:46,317
Right...

755
00:59:48,647 --> 00:59:50,444
He was amazing
because he has...

756
00:59:58,647 --> 00:59:59,966
What a horrible smell.

757
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:03,721
Mind your head.

758
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:09,916
This is it.

759
01:00:11,167 --> 01:00:12,316
He's in here?

760
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:13,118
Yeah.

761
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:14,482
Are you sure?

762
01:00:22,847 --> 01:00:24,963
That answers that question.

763
01:00:25,607 --> 01:00:27,086
How did you find
this place?

764
01:00:28,607 --> 01:00:30,199
I followed Murnau here.

765
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,561
I think you're in the wrong
part of the building.

766
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:36,321
There's probably a sadistic
brothel upstairs.

767
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:10,562
What's wrong?

768
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:11,961
It's all right.

769
01:01:12,367 --> 01:01:13,766
Everyone back to bed.

770
01:01:15,047 --> 01:01:16,082
Greta...

771
01:01:16,487 --> 01:01:17,966
Greta, what is it?

772
01:01:18,687 --> 01:01:20,279
Greta, what is it?

773
01:01:21,207 --> 01:01:23,004
Greta, Greta...

774
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,042
What's happened, Greta?

775
01:01:26,207 --> 01:01:27,117
Please.

776
01:01:27,287 --> 01:01:28,197
It's morphine.

777
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:29,561
Morphine?

778
01:01:32,727 --> 01:01:36,766
Photography and pharmaceuticals by
Fritzie. That's just what I need.

779
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,360
Friedrich knows all about it.

780
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:39,642
What do you mean,
he knows about it?

781
01:01:40,247 --> 01:01:42,397
He knows all about it.
She's fine.

782
01:01:42,927 --> 01:01:44,076
Don't worry, get some sleep.

783
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:43,482
Are you all right there?

784
01:03:16,847 --> 01:03:18,485
This set is not ready.

785
01:03:20,247 --> 01:03:22,317
Can we get any natural light
in here?

786
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:25,798
The set is not ready, and you're
talking about natural light.

787
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:29,759
What's the matter
with you, Albin?...

788
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:32,237
You seem a little anxious
lately.

789
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:37,116
You don't understand, I'm ruined.
I'II never make another picture again.

790
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:39,245
My reputation gone

791
01:03:39,407 --> 01:03:41,318
and you talk about natural light.
Please, Fritz...

792
01:03:42,247 --> 01:03:43,396
Don't worry...

793
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:46,924
-It's the same on every picture.
-Not on my picture!

794
01:04:25,167 --> 01:04:26,919
Friedrich open up.

795
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,840
It's me, Albin.

796
01:04:35,527 --> 01:04:36,880
Friedrich, let us in.

797
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:44,401
Ah, Jesus!

798
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:53,836
What is it?

799
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,879
It's laudanum,
that's what it is.

800
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:59,282
There is no Max Schreck.

801
01:05:04,087 --> 01:05:06,317
If he's not Max Schreck,

802
01:05:07,607 --> 01:05:08,596
who is he?

803
01:05:10,087 --> 01:05:11,281
I don't know.

804
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:14,717
where did you find him?

805
01:05:15,487 --> 01:05:16,636
In a book...

806
01:05:17,687 --> 01:05:19,518
when I was a student.

807
01:05:20,487 --> 01:05:22,955
A series of paintings portraying

808
01:05:23,647 --> 01:05:25,922
a long line of despotic kings,

809
01:05:26,647 --> 01:05:28,524
rumoured to be vampire

810
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:32,243
living in Slovakia
for hundreds for years.

811
01:05:33,447 --> 01:05:37,599
I had forgotten all about it
until she gave me that other book.

812
01:05:38,407 --> 01:05:39,556
What other book, Friedrich?

813
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,876
Dracula.

814
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:44,041
Then I went to scout locations

815
01:05:46,007 --> 01:05:47,486
and there he was

816
01:05:48,207 --> 01:05:50,357
living in an old monastery.

817
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:54,121
What kind of bond did you make
with him?

818
01:05:55,087 --> 01:05:59,126
That he would play the part of an actor
playing the part of a vampire.

819
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:02,162
Why?

820
01:06:03,687 --> 01:06:05,166
What did you offer
him in return?

821
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:09,404
Everlasting life...

822
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:13,395
and Greta.

823
01:06:15,327 --> 01:06:16,396
Greta?

824
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:19,038
How could you do
this, Friedrich?

825
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:22,044
I did it for science.

826
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,045
To preserve it for posterity.

827
01:06:28,727 --> 01:06:31,287
Friedrich! Friedrich!

828
01:06:33,247 --> 01:06:35,044
He's he's gone.

829
01:06:36,207 --> 01:06:37,162
Come on.

830
01:06:39,767 --> 01:06:41,166
What are we going to do?

831
01:06:41,407 --> 01:06:43,318
The call is for two o'clock.

832
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,555
Albin, listen to me.

833
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:11,758
There's no way
off this island.

834
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:13,395
What about the aeroplane...?

835
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:15,797
No, I already checked it.

836
01:07:16,647 --> 01:07:17,841
The fuel tanks are empty.

837
01:07:18,967 --> 01:07:20,161
God!

838
01:07:21,127 --> 01:07:22,116
No.

839
01:07:24,327 --> 01:07:27,364
We're going to have to film
Schreck's scene tonight.

840
01:07:35,247 --> 01:07:37,636
You know I don't like these late
shoots, Friedrich.

841
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:39,440
Where is everybody?

842
01:07:39,967 --> 01:07:41,958
Why don't I have an assistant?

843
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:42,843
Greta...

844
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:46,962
Did you put on this make-up
with a broom?

845
01:07:47,127 --> 01:07:48,526
Stop fussing, Albin.

846
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:50,235
You look beautiful.

847
01:07:50,527 --> 01:07:51,676
Can I have a cigarette?

848
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:52,563
Sure.

849
01:07:54,447 --> 01:07:56,244
Where's my script, Henrik?

850
01:07:56,687 --> 01:07:58,040
He's indisposed.

851
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,196
What's the matter with him?

852
01:07:59,447 --> 01:08:01,836
Greta, don't ask so many questions,
we're busy.

853
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:06,961
Thank you, darling.

854
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:12,479
Why does everybody look
so depressing?

855
01:08:13,967 --> 01:08:16,117
Hey, who died?

856
01:08:54,207 --> 01:08:56,163
Jesus! Look at you.

857
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:02,597
Friedrich.

858
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:05,682
Herr Doctor!

859
01:09:05,887 --> 01:09:07,684
Yes, Greta, what is it?

860
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:11,164
What's the shot?
What are we doing here?

861
01:09:15,967 --> 01:09:17,480
Can you stand for me?

862
01:09:19,727 --> 01:09:20,842
Look at you.

863
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:23,800
Yes, very well.

864
01:09:24,007 --> 01:09:27,920
Now, let us take her robe,
Albin, please.

865
01:09:30,567 --> 01:09:32,683
And she'll need
her wooden stake.

866
01:09:34,767 --> 01:09:38,043
Also, Greta, you will be here,
lying on the bed.

867
01:09:40,447 --> 01:09:41,197
Yes.

868
01:09:44,167 --> 01:09:44,963
Now, Greta...

869
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:46,997
Good.

870
01:09:52,487 --> 01:09:53,397
Now...

871
01:09:54,127 --> 01:09:55,719
in this scene...

872
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:59,841
you make the ultimate sacrifice
for love. Yes?

873
01:10:00,247 --> 01:10:01,123
Yes.

874
01:10:01,847 --> 01:10:03,724
You will seduce the Count...

875
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:05,922
and...

876
01:10:06,727 --> 01:10:10,436
with your wooden stake,
just before, you die,

877
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:12,639
you will despatch him. Yes?

878
01:10:12,807 --> 01:10:14,206
Thank you. Very good.

879
01:10:14,407 --> 01:10:15,237
Now...

880
01:10:16,407 --> 01:10:18,716
In other words,
all you have to do...

881
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:22,840
is, as they say, relax and the vampire
will do all the work.

882
01:10:24,327 --> 01:10:27,717
You had me leave rehearsals in Berlin
just to do that?

883
01:10:29,407 --> 01:10:31,318
Hey, watch it, handsome!

884
01:10:31,967 --> 01:10:33,286
Fifty-two, one.

885
01:10:37,727 --> 01:10:39,683
And for your lean in,
please, Herr Schreck.

886
01:10:40,527 --> 01:10:41,562
Thank you.

887
01:10:45,887 --> 01:10:48,117
And, Albin, her shoes, please.

888
01:10:48,927 --> 01:10:49,757
Yes.

889
01:10:50,527 --> 01:10:52,119
We must go.

890
01:10:52,367 --> 01:10:53,243
Friedrich.

891
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:54,477
Yes?

892
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:57,356
I don't wish to question
your authority, but,

893
01:10:58,447 --> 01:11:00,085
are you sure you know
what you're doing?

894
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:01,919
Yes, exactly. Roll camera...

895
01:11:03,247 --> 01:11:04,566
And, Fritz, ready?

896
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:05,523
Higher.

897
01:11:05,687 --> 01:11:06,324
Albin.

898
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:10,123
And...

899
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:11,961
iris in.

900
01:11:13,807 --> 01:11:14,796
End.

901
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:15,922
What happened?

902
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:18,681
-I saw he, he casts no...
-I'm tired of waiting.

903
01:11:18,887 --> 01:11:22,163
-Calm down.
-No, he casts no reflection.

904
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:26,956
I see him. No, look at him.
Look at him!

905
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:29,761
Look! Please help me.

906
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:31,721
Help me please, Friedrich.

907
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,718
-I'll give you something to calm you.
-No, don't do that.

908
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,845
-Just to calm you. Yes?
-Albin, look at him, please.

909
01:11:37,647 --> 01:11:39,922
Please, please, please.

910
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:41,278
No.

911
01:11:41,967 --> 01:11:45,642
But still, I don't understand
what... No!

912
01:11:57,327 --> 01:11:59,841
It is the role that will make you
great as an actress.

913
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:09,359
Consider it a sacrifice
for your art.

914
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:18,517
That's better, now we can work
in peace.

915
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:34,760
I want her now.

916
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:38,357
No, I need a shot f you clutching
your heart first.

917
01:12:39,287 --> 01:12:40,356
My death scene?

918
01:12:40,567 --> 01:12:42,842
Yes, you must do that
for me.

919
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,155
Very well.

920
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:50,920
Roll camera... and begin.

921
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:56,920
Yes, Count. You kneel down. You'll
have your head on her shoulder,

922
01:12:57,487 --> 01:12:59,557
but you're not feeding, Count.

923
01:13:02,367 --> 01:13:04,517
No, you're not drinking
her blood now,

924
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:08,481
because you have been drinking
her blood all night.

925
01:13:09,447 --> 01:13:11,119
In fact, you can barely move.

926
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:16,883
You are intoxicated with,

927
01:13:17,847 --> 01:13:19,917
with blood and desire.

928
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,600
Greta, can you hear me?

929
01:13:22,847 --> 01:13:23,643
Yes?

930
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,125
Flutter your eyelids.

931
01:13:27,887 --> 01:13:30,447
Yes, now, Greta, you start...

932
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:32,242
to awaken...

933
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:34,686
Find your stake.

934
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,761
Yes, where is it?
Find your stake.

935
01:13:39,687 --> 01:13:43,475
Now, Count, as she raises her stake,
what do you see?

936
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:47,676
Yes, a wooden stake, exactly.
You look at her...

937
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:49,642
betrayed.

938
01:13:49,807 --> 01:13:51,240
Yes, you turn...

939
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:52,677
You rise...

940
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,240
You look around.
The sun is coming.

941
01:13:56,767 --> 01:13:59,884
You grab your heart
in anguish.

942
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,758
Yes, and you start to die.

943
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:05,083
Yes, you start to die alone.

944
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:06,686
In anguish.

945
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:09,595
Die, you you fucking rat bastard.

946
01:14:09,807 --> 01:14:12,605
Vampire pig,
schweine-hund shit!

947
01:14:12,767 --> 01:14:16,999
Yes, die alone! Yes, the weight
of the centuries burns you!

948
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,037
And...

949
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:19,883
End!

950
01:14:23,607 --> 01:14:24,437
Fritz?

951
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:25,722
Ja, got it.

952
01:14:26,527 --> 01:14:27,880
That's enough, Murnau.

953
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:36,246
Hey!

954
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:38,400
Okay, ja.

955
01:14:39,087 --> 01:14:40,156
I want her now!

956
01:14:40,647 --> 01:14:42,717
Go to hell, Murnau!

957
01:14:43,287 --> 01:14:44,037
Begin!

958
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:13,317
Very good, yes.

959
01:15:13,647 --> 01:15:14,921
And slowly we need
to move the camera.

960
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:47,440
Friedrich...

961
01:16:12,407 --> 01:16:15,319
Friedrich he cut the chain
we're trapped.

962
01:16:24,727 --> 01:16:27,480
So, you would
break our bargain?

963
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:31,760
You think you know so much...

964
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:34,636
but I can still kill you.

965
01:16:36,447 --> 01:16:39,245
I can break your necks...

966
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:43,242
drink your blood...

967
01:16:45,127 --> 01:16:47,163
And I could you tried
to trick me!

968
01:16:51,127 --> 01:16:54,085
It's daybreak, is it?

969
01:16:54,327 --> 01:16:57,125
So what? All I need...

970
01:16:57,847 --> 01:16:59,963
is to sleep in darkness.

971
01:17:01,127 --> 01:17:04,517
I will stay here until dusk...

972
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,156
and then...

973
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:10,962
only I will walk out alive.

974
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:17,961
Idiot.

975
01:17:43,967 --> 01:17:46,800
Frankly, Count, I find
this composition unworkable.

976
01:17:48,887 --> 01:17:51,526
Could you return to your original
mark, please?

977
01:18:07,207 --> 01:18:10,483
If it's not in frame,
it doesn't exist.

978
01:19:44,407 --> 01:19:47,683
Then finally you must turn
to meet the sun.

979
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:50,278
The death of centuries...

980
01:19:51,047 --> 01:19:53,436
moon chaser, blasphemer...

981
01:19:54,487 --> 01:19:57,206
monkey, vase of prehistory.

982
01:19:58,087 --> 01:20:01,602
Finally to earth
and finally born.

983
01:20:02,327 --> 01:20:03,157
Yes...

984
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:06,802
Yes.

985
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:09,081
You take the sun.

986
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,315
Albin, could you quickly
collect the wooden stake

987
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:14,797
and return it
to it's rightful place?

988
01:20:15,247 --> 01:20:17,124
It is necessary
for the final frame.

989
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:19,927
To remind us of the inadequacy
our plans,...

990
01:20:20,527 --> 01:20:22,006
our contingencies,...

991
01:20:22,287 --> 01:20:25,916
every missed train,
the failed picnics,...

992
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,964
every lie to a child.

993
01:20:54,647 --> 01:20:56,080
Softly, please.

994
01:20:57,407 --> 01:20:59,125
Our work is nearly complete.

995
01:21:00,567 --> 01:21:04,355
Our very own painting
on our very own cave wall.

996
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:09,523
Time will no longer be a dark spot
on our lungs.

997
01:21:10,207 --> 01:21:12,243
They will no longer
be able to say:

998
01:21:12,727 --> 01:21:14,558
"You would have
to have been there".

999
01:21:15,847 --> 01:21:18,964
Because, the fact is, Albin...
we were.

1000
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:26,280
Is there one among you who might wear
the mantle of camera assistant?

1001
01:21:32,927 --> 01:21:34,883
Could I possibly impose on you to

1002
01:21:35,087 --> 01:21:38,875
collect the slate at my feet
and provide me with an end board?

1003
01:21:46,247 --> 01:21:47,566
Turn it.

1004
01:22:05,327 --> 01:22:06,203
Thank you.

1005
01:22:08,967 --> 01:22:10,685
I think we have it.
