1
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,321
- Frank?

2
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,444
- Brain's dead, heart's fading fast.

3
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,989
- He's lost a massive amount of blood.

4
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,490
- How long has he got?

5
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,743
- I'd say you could
measure than in seconds.

6
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,784
- You know what we have to do right?

7
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,204
- Alex he's not road kill.

8
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,668
- Look this guy's been dropped in our lap,

9
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,295
let's not let the chance go by.

10
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,005
- Jim?

11
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,639
- It's choking in my throat
but I agree with Alex.

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,388
- Yeah but he's a human
being not a guinea pig.

13
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,391
- Well he'll be a dead human being

14
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,723
if I don't give him this virus.

15
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,103
I don't know who you are but God I pray

16
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,854
that this give you life

17
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,694
- [White Coat] I
remeasured his vital signs

18
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:30,896
and there's something really wrong there.

19
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,903
- I know the bastards sinking fast.

20
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,450
Doesn't he look bigger to you today?

21
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,027
- [White Coat] Maybe
he's retaining fluids.

22
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,112
- [Coveralls] Well don't
expect me to wring him out.

23
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,487
- [Man] Well stop making
those goo goo eyes at her.

24
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:02,825
- Good morning everyone.

25
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,373
- Hiya Joanie.

26
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,826
- Good morning Joanne.

27
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,286
- My you're awfully
chipper this morning Rob.

28
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,122
- That's because you are so
lovely this morning Joanne.

29
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,048
- What, you have a two
way mirror in that thing?

30
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,002
- No you are lovely every
single morning Joanne.

31
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,883
- Oh, ah Frank do you
have those numbers for me?

32
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,933
- I'll have them for you
right after breakfast.

33
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,056
- [Joanne] Thank you.

34
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,645
- Oh that's just great.

35
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,352
You turn on the microwave
the power surges.

36
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,026
Wonderful, out altogether!

37
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,028
What else can go wrong?

38
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,030
- Stay calm Larry we are underground.

39
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,861
- Shut up interactive head.

40
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,739
- Yeah Rob what the hell you got in there

41
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,745
that's so fascinating anyway?

42
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,498
- Well actually I'm just
playing a little video golf.

43
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,129
I'm on the 18th hole of the masters

44
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,925
My putting game is almost perfect

45
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,719
and I'm, oh I'm actually
about to go four strokes up.

46
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,975
- Oh, I am sick of this shit.

47
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:18,860
Power going in and out, we
haven't had supplies for weeks.

48
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,237
I'm owed two months back pay.

49
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,693
Does anybody know we're still out here

50
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,494
in this abandoned nuclear dump?

51
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,371
- Yes Larry they know we're still here.

52
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,333
And yes Larry you will get all
the money you've got coming,

53
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,914
including the bonus you were promised

54
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,499
when the research is finished.

55
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:45,349
Look everybody, I know it's
been very difficult lately

56
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,475
but we're on the verge of a breakthrough.

57
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,305
- [Larry] Breakthrough.

58
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,562
If you ask rne our friend in
there is in a world of pain.

59
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,817
- But I didn't ask you.

60
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,862
- His vital signs are really
low Alex he's fading fast.

61
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:03,067
- That's a part of the process
Frank but we all know that.

62
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,278
His body is still accepting the virus.

63
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,373
Once it does molecular
regeneration will accelerate.

64
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,291
- If he doesn't die first.

65
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,705
- He's not going to die.

66
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,098
But if you want to you can leave Larry.

67
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,981
Stockton left, you can go,

68
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,148
anyone of you are free to go at any time.

69
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:38,271
- Fuck you.

70
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,148
I'm not gonna just pack up

71
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,447
and leave after all the
work I've put in here.

72
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,951
Gross!

73
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,450
- [Woman] Mark come on.

74
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,535
- Where the bed?

75
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,370
Okay.

76
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,420
- No stop.

77
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,463
- Okay here's cool.

78
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,792
- [Man] Wendy, let's get out, let's go.

79
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,711
- Oh okay we're coming.

80
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,549
- You're packed?

81
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:51,474
<i>_</i> rm packed.

82
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,226
- Where the hell's Scott?

83
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,226
- Um I think Scott's in his room.

84
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,773
His room.

85
00:09:58,973 --> 00:09:59,690
. Okay-

86
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,231
Okay.

87
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:06,902
- You asshole.

88
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,688
- Hi, we're ready to leave.

89
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,980
- What?

90
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,728
- Come on get packed we're going.

91
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,690
- I already told you
I'm not going camping.

92
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,316
- Alright listen, I don't
wanna argue with you Scott.

93
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,444
I have neither the time nor
the inclination, come on.

94
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,946
- No argument I'm not going.

95
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,950
- Get out of bed, pack now.

96
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,622
- [Scott] Why?

97
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,039
- Because I said so.

98
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,870
- Oh, what is this some
sort of attempt at bonding?

99
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,459
- Pack.

100
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,489
- Oh God!

101
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,158
This is a code red ladies and gentlemen,

102
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,492
I repeat a code red.

103
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,291
- Alex what's going on?

104
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,964
- Some kind of seizure I'm not sure,

105
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,212
I'm gonna call Jim Stockton.

106
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,042
- What?

107
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,251
- What you got a problem with that?

108
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,962
- Yeah Alex he quit

109
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,423
because of how we were using his research.

110
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,757
Do you think he's gonna come back?

111
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,763
- Yes because he cares.

112
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,678
- Is there anything you wouldn't
do to save this project?

113
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,855
- No besides I thought
you'd be glad to see him.

114
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,148
- Oh save it Alex.

115
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,147
- [Alex] Listen prep the O.R. okay Joanne.

116
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,399
- Sometimes you can be
an unbelievable prick!

117
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,901
- Just prepare the O.R. okay?

118
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,402
- Yeah Stockton.

119
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,033
- Stockton it's Alex Hunter.

120
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,990
- What do you want?

121
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,701
- Listen we have a
serious problem down here

122
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:23,660
and we need you.

123
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,207
- I got a flash for you pal
I don't work there anymore.

124
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,963
- I know that but our
guy's in a very bad way.

125
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,295
- [Jim] It's not my problem anymore buddy.

126
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,426
- I understand that Jim

127
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,133
but nobody here knows how the virus works

128
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,388
better than yourself.

129
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,686
He's gonna die if you don't come.

130
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,605
You brought him back to life
you can't just let him die.

131
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,432
- Why not?

132
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,266
Why let him live.

133
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:51,321
Oh geez I forgot, I forgot
Alex the profit motive.

134
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,949
I mean, he's better off dead.

135
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,527
- That's pretty self righteous stuff Jim.

136
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,703
I mean you're not without
sin in all of this.

137
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,451
You're the one that discovered the virus

138
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,284
and you gave it to him
willingly I might add.

139
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,460
- Aren't you judging me you shit.

140
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,337
We both know what would have happened

141
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,711
if I didn't give that to him.

142
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,589
- However you want to
justify it is fine with me,

143
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,674
the point is, he's dying
right now and he needs you.

144
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,973
- Hey Alex guess what?

145
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,523
- Son of a bitch.

146
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,113
- [Joanne] Frank we have
an emergency in O.R.

147
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:34,985
- You're telling me.

148
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,816
You were right, I've been
looking at those numbers

149
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,027
you wanted and Alex has been
speeding up the process.

150
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:39,952
- God I knew it.

151
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,872
- He's been giving Thor the
virus at 10 times the rate.

152
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,200
The poor guys metabolism is way off chart.

153
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,456
- Jesus no wonder he's grown
so much in the last month.

154
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,582
- So what'll we do?

155
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,958
- Well right now we've
gotta save his life.

156
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,380
We'll deal with Alex later.

157
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,131
- Come on, come on, come on.

158
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,462
Stay in there big guy.

159
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,098
- [Alex] Do you read me Frank?

160
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,767
- [Frank] Where the hell have you been?

161
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,264
- [Alex] what are his vital signs?

162
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,597
- Failing, 20 under 200.

163
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,977
- Come on, come on you're
supposed to be tough.

164
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,610
- Zero neural activity.

165
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,777
- [Alex] Let's defibrillate.

166
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,230
- [Joanne] He's dying Alex.

167
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,108
Why not let nature take it's course.

168
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,158
- [Alex] Screw nature.

169
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,121
- 6:44 subject is still in cardiac arrest.

170
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,747
- [Alex] Clear.

171
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,498
Joanne clear out of the way.

172
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:35,962
Frank?

173
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,214
- He's almost flat line.

174
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,135
- [Alex] Clear.

175
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,056
Frank?

176
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,223
- Flat line Alex.

177
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,098
- God damn it let's give
him 200 cc's of epinephrine.

178
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,474
Let's go let's go

179
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,815
talk to me Frank.

180
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:51,937
- [Frank] Nothing Alex.

181
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:52,858
- [Alex] Damn it.

182
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,612
Now?

183
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:57,439
- Nothing Alex.

184
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,614
- God damn it what are you doing?

185
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,409
You can't fucking do this to me.

186
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,364
- Come on Alex enough is enough already.

187
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,371
- Alex enough.

188
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,254
Alex he's dead, alright?

189
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,546
- [Alex] Don't touch me.

190
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,964
- [Joanne] He's dead Alex!

191
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,465
Look you did all you could.

192
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,139
- You shut up, you just shut the hell up.

193
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,693
None of you understood the importance

194
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:36,894
of what I was doing here.

195
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:37,979
- [Larry] What you were doing here?

196
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,985
- Yeah that's right me!

197
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,864
- You know what Alex, why
don't you just go to hell huh?

198
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,490
- Yeah go screw yourself.

199
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,571
- [Frank] People...

200
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,450
- [Larry] This is the thanks we get?

201
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,202
You ungrateful bastard.

202
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,875
- People we've got a heartbeat.

203
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,338
- That's necrosis right?

204
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,632
- Uh uh, necrosis
wouldn't set in that fast.

205
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:03,471
- That's right, you're right, it wouldn't.

206
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,890
- Wait a second Larry didn't
you refill the steroid drip?

207
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,807
- Yeah.

208
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:07,634
- Well...

209
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:08,593
- Where is it?

210
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,687
- [Alex] God damn it where's the back up?

211
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,192
- [Joanne] Sh, what was that?

212
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:24,992
- [Larry] Where the hell did he go?

213
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,445
- Shut up.

214
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,278
- Frank.

215
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,240
- He can't get out, this
whole place is sealed off.

216
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,574
Let's find him.

217
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:37,880
God damn it.

218
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:15,626
- [Larry] Where the hell is--

219
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,452
- [Joanne] Frank!

220
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,378
- Shit.

221
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,595
Shit!

222
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,422
- Larry!

223
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,347
- Help!

224
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,307
- Alex help me!

225
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,638
- Let him go!

226
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,560
- [Joanne] Larry!

227
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,686
- Let him go Joanne!

228
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,726
- No! No!

229
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,403
Come on Larry!

230
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,071
Alex Jesus help me!

231
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,074
No! No!

232
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:47,992
No!

233
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,960
- There's nothing we could have done.

234
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,425
- What's wrong?

235
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,723
- Something came up.

236
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,019
- [Scott] Hey trips off.

237
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,349
- What do you mean.

238
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,311
- A super trooper from the outpost called

239
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,611
and I can't turn my back on it.

240
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,315
- Well what about our camping trip?

241
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,866
- It can't be helped honey.

242
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,033
- Well there's the old stand by,

243
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,953
it's always somebody else's
fault right, never yours?

244
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,787
- Wendy please.

245
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,460
- You quit that job three months ago

246
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,412
now you're just gonna go running back?

247
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,087
- They got a problem.

248
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,794
Loose ends come back to haunt ya honey.

249
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,549
It's not gonna take me that long.

250
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,427
- Then take us with you.

251
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,679
- Wendy shut up.

252
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,095
- Come on I'd rather
you didn't go this time.

253
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,101
- Listen you go, do what you have to do

254
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,774
and we'll wait outside,
we'll go camping afterwards.

255
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,100
How far can the mountains be?

256
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,731
- They're not far but we gotta fly,

257
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,857
there's a short field landing,

258
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,939
I know how you feel about flying.

259
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,447
Come on, it's up to you,
you wanna make the flight.

260
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,154
- I've got Mark he'll take care of me.

261
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,285
Dorothy Parker said you
never really know someone

262
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,457
until you hold their head when they vomit.

263
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,580
Come on.

264
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,748
- Alright let's go.

265
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,830
- Oh good then sound glad.

266
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,712
- This is ridiculous.

267
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:29,673
- Dorothy who?

268
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,467
- Come on, come on.

269
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,764
- What the hell happened?

270
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:42,723
- What the hell happened?

271
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,525
Why don't you tell me Alex?

272
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,567
- What happened?

273
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,941
Isn't that what we created him to do huh?

274
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,397
The super stud soldier.

275
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,733
Isn't that what the Pentagon
funded this whole project for?

276
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,444
- The process was not
engineered to have him

277
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:56,370
respond so out of control.

278
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,413
- Oh cut the shit Alex.

279
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,866
I've been doing a little
late night homework,

280
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,200
going over the data logs,

281
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,878
the progression of the
virus has been way too fast.

282
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:04,704
- I don't know what you're talking about.

283
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,710
- What the fuck have you been up to?

284
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,131
You've been doing this behind our backs,

285
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,584
speeding this whole thing up haven't you?

286
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,170
- Let's have this conversation
some other time okay?

287
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,426
Let's get out of here right now, let's go.

288
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,052
- I'm not gonna leave him here.

289
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,976
- Alex he can't get out and
we'll just come back with help.

290
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,679
- No, no way.

291
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,357
I wanna do this project
myself, no more outside help.

292
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,526
- Oh my God you've
completely lost your mind.

293
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,774
What, have you been under ground too long?

294
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,946
Let's get out of here right now, let's go.

295
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,821
- Alright you wanna stay here Alex fine.

296
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,027
But Rob and I are getting out of here.

297
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:37,862
Can you get us out of here?

298
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,868
- I can't get us out of
here without his hand code.

299
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,995
Now listen, listen, let us outta here

300
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,746
and you can do whatever
the fuck you wanna do

301
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,577
but let's go.

302
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,411
<i>'</i> No!

303
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,871
I'm gonna need your help to catch him.

304
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,126
- Catch him?

305
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,332
Alex did you see what he did in there?

306
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,463
- We can do it.

307
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,294
We'll rig up some tranquilizer guns.

308
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,253
- Tranquilizer guns?

309
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,714
What are you talking about?

310
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,592
What about the virus?

311
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,300
- We were wearing those
suits to protect him.

312
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,727
We're contagious he's
not, a little summer cold

313
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,553
could kill him right now.

314
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,479
- Alright, alright, alright, alright.

315
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,523
Stop messing around Alex, now
get us outta here right now!

316
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:09,935
- Oh dear.

317
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,316
- I said I need your help.

318
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,446
- Oh God.

319
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,996
- Sorry Wen, turbulence.

320
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,371
- Daddy it's this plane of
yours, you need to get a new one.

321
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,044
- It's a Wilco 35 I wouldn't
trade it for the world.

322
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,757
- Okay Mark, I think I need
you to hold my head now.

323
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,132
- Just take a few deep breaths Wendy.

324
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,097
- God you know how many
times I've taken you up here

325
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,223
since you were a child?

326
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,974
You used to love it.

327
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,602
I remember, you memorized
every one of these instruments.

328
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,481
I used to point at 'em
and you'd rattle 'em off.

329
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,606
Do you remember that?

330
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,562
Do you think you could do that?

331
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:54,488
- What?

332
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:58,158
- Nevermind.

333
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,831
- [Joanne] So what was the plan Alex?

334
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,333
Go behind the army's back?

335
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:11,960
- It still is the plan.

336
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:15,460
We're gonna sell him along with the virus

337
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,544
to the highest bidder.

338
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,096
Okay those look good, let's go.

339
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,798
- Alex this isn't even
gonna make him blink

340
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,882
I hate to tell ya.

341
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:25,220
- There's enough in those
to stop an elephant.

342
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,764
- Oh and how the hell are
we supposed to find him?

343
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,059
- This heat sensor.

344
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:31,938
- You got a heat sensor.

345
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,644
- Yeah, okay after you.

346
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:34,570
- Alright.

347
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:36,859
Here Thor.

348
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,920
- Nice and easy.

349
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,721
- Alex we're gonna die in here.

350
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,547
I mean is that what you want?

351
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,223
You wanna die over this thing huh?

352
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,599
- Yeah Alex your money's no
good to you if you're dead.

353
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,522
- Well we better just catch
him before he catches us.

354
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,350
- Oh and then what huh?

355
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:13,855

the lust for life in me.

452
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,414
They harden my tombstone.

453
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,796
- Is there anything that
doesn't make you horny?

454
00:31:20,337 --> 00:31:21,338
- My mother's douche.

455
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:23,974
I saw it once by accident.

456
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,176

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,378
- Oh he's killing me.

465
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,924
It's like father daughter radar.

466
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,886
- Did you hear something?

467
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:05,807

He's right above us.

477
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:46,886

- What the hell you doing?

486
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:14,830
- It won't kill you Alex
but it's enough so you won't

487
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,287

Alright Alex there's

512
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,287

- Come on.

520
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,402
- I hope that hurt you son of a bitch.

521
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,077
- Why couldn't you just stay by the plane?

522
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,626
Why did I let you talk me
into taking you with me?

523
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,211
- Yeah Wendy shut up next time alright.

524
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,421
- Hey super punk why don't you just

525
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:28,798
put your headgear back on?

526
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,219
- You know Mark you
couldn't get a piece of ass

527
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,515
if you were a toilet seat.

528
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,889
- You know you guys are so immature.

529
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,471
- Maybe you can all be quiet
just for a couple of seconds.

530
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,229
Well here we go.

531
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,376
- What is this place?

532
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,124
- It's an old nuclear test facility

533
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,876
we revamped and took over.

534
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:06,832
- [Wendy] Are you kidding?

535
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,087
- [Jim] It's perfectly safe.

536
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,339
- [Wendy] Yeah that's what
they said about Chernobyl.

537
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,545
- Wendy you wanna wait
out by the airplane?

538
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,802
Anybody?

539
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:15,723
- No.

540
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,929
- Hey Wendy your ovaries are glowing .

541
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:20,978
<i>_</i> Very funny.

542
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,235
- I know I've seen some exits
in these old blueprints.

543
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,696
Back when this was a nuclear facility

544
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,657
before we turned her into
a God damn monster shop.

545
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,582
Here it is.

546
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,870
Level C, quadrant three.

547
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,330
- Yeah but wouldn't
Gentec have sealed it off

548
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,006
when they quarantined the place?

549
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,379
- Yeah most likely but
unless you got a better--

550
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,300
- Shh.

551
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,592
- Unless you got a better idea.

552
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,799
I think it's worth a look.

553
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,475
- Alright let's go.

554
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,731
- Doesn't anybody work here?

555
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,601
- You're asking the wrong man fella.

556
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,277
- Hey, you know what?

557
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,319
I got an idea.

558
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,824
Let's all go get really
drunk and go to Vegas huh?

559
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,492
Come on it's not far.

560
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,570
Come on we can go see Siegfried and Roy.

561
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,035
Hey.

562
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:29,923
- That sneaky son of
bitch can be anywhere.

563
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,709
- Kay we got this gun now.

564
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,596
- You know I don't find
much comfort in that.

565
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,013
There's the door.

566
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,519
Aye. yai, yai, yai.

567
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,029
Here hold this for a second.

568
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,870
- Rob, should we worry about the sign?

569
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,829
- Yeah we should be
worried about the sign.

570
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,335
- Great.

571
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,724
- Oh perfect

572
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,625
Okay.

573
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,961
Let's get ready to rumble.

574
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,393
Alright now, now be careful.

575
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,946
- Can you see anything?

576
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:28,325
Rob do you see anything?

577
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,501
- Hand me the flashlight.

578
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,250
Shit.

579
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,670
Get out, get out, get out!

580
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,713
Get out!

581
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,428
Go! Go!

582
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,557
- Oh shit!

583
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:54,984
Great what do we do now?

584
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,436
- Let's call Oprah and hell I don't know.

585
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:01,199
- Hey man, which one's
Siegfried and which one's Roy?

586
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:03,944
- Siegfried's the blond.

587
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,074
- No Roy's the blond.

588
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,406
- Siegfried is the blond for Christ sake.

589
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:09,457
- Everybody knows Roy has the dark hair.

590
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,534
- Yeah well what are you man?

591
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,915
Are you like head of the fan club?

592
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,746
- Hold it a second.

593
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,797
I think we're going the wrong way here.

594
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,171
- Hey wait, wait you know
what I think is really weird,

595
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,925
let me just bounce this
off you really quickly.

596
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,851
Ah Siegfried has this like hero,

597
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:28,847
no, no, seriously,

598
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,147
Siegfried has this heroic
name you know Siegfried,

599
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,818
and Roy has this like you know
country western singer name,

600
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,895
I mean I don't know what it is you know.

601
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:40,946
Roland.

602
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:41,818
What do you think about Roland?

603
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,525
Siegfried and Roland.

604
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,529
- Enough man--

605
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,111
- No I'm serious we
should call their agent.

606
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,696
- You are so messed up.

607
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:48,905
- Where's my angry young man?

608
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,831
- [Scott] Hey, hey, alright.

609
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:52,954
- Ow man that hurt.

610
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:58,753
- Ah everything's wonky, I
can't get any of this to work.

611
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,630
Are you getting anything on the radio?

612
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,050
- I'm not getting a signal.

613
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,464
- That must mean he's
up in the network room.

614
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,549
- I'll go.

615
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,260
- No, no, no, no, I'll go.

616
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,436
- Rob I can fix it.

617
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,981
- [Rob] Yeah well I can fix it better.

618
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:15,807
- [Joanne] Here take this.

619
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:16,732
- That's alright.

620
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,936
Gun of my own.

621
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,770
- Well be careful.

622
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,696
- I Will.

623
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,408
Joanne listen I wanna say,

624
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,952
that I'm sorry about that
video thing you know.

625
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:28,778
- Oh that's okay.

626
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,582
- No, no, no, it was a
really stupid thing to do

627
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:33,829
and I shouldn't be doing stuff like that.

628
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,502
- Rob this is not a really
good time for confession.

629
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,250
- No you're wrong, you're
wrong it's the perfect time

630
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,052
for me to say to you that I
have always had a crush on you.

631
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,676
Wish me luck.

632
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,506
- Good luck.

633
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:49,432
- Thanks.

634
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,452
- You're the one who made me hurt.

635
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:26,345
- No I don't want to hurt you.

636
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,512
But you should let me go.

637
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,763
Let me go and I'll help you.

638
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,936
I'll explain everything to you.

639
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,983
- You know that I'm changing.

640
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:45,071
Things are happening to me.

641
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,664
Look, I'll show you.

642
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:44,046
It needs to be fed.

643
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,424
Like the stuff from the bag.

644
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,514
Like from the minds of those others.

645
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:57,594
- The steriles, you need
the brains for the steriles.

646
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,308
I can get you all you want.

647
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:04,150
- I'm dying, aren't I?

648
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,523
- No, no.

649
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,781
I will save you I swear.

650
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:16,204
Listen, do you realize
you're the first one

651
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:19,290
of a whole new race of beings?

652
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,628
But you need me.

653
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,839
You need me.

654
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,756
- Yes, I need you.

655
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,257
I need you.

656
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,934
Lend me your mind.

657
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:48,645
- What?

658
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:56,577
- This place is as quiet as a tomb.

659
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,500
- That bio lab light's on.

660
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,295
Don't touch anything.

661
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:42,512
- Rob.

662
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:44,639
Rob.

663
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:47,475
Rob.

664
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,649
What's going on up there?

665
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,240
Rob can you hear me?

666
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,531
- Yeah Joanne, I'm up here.

667
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,366
I had a run in with our boy though.

668
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,413
Nice, computer's up.

669
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,662
- Are you alright?

670
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,715
- Yeah I'm minus a shoe and a toe nail

671
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,087
but I think I'll be okay.

672
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:17,968
Ah damn.

673
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,170
- [Joanne] What is it?

674
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:22,302
- Well it seems our boy wants a little

675
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,807
cable chaser after his brains apparently.

676
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,354
- [Joanne] Can you fix it?

677
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,727
- Yeah, I think we
should be able to rewire

678
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,932
some of these circuits hopefully.

679
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,438
I need you to get out the...

680
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:36,149
Let's start with the blue schematics book

681
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:40,404
and I think I'll need the F9
and the F10 right behind you.

682
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,030
- Alright.

683
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,737
- Let's see if we can't get
something rigged up here.

684
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,085
" Rob!

685
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:02,550
- Rob no!

686
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,559
No!

687
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:07,476
No!

688
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,451
- Something's wrong here.

689
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:32,622
- Fuck.

690
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,172
- Oh my God.

691
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,962
What were you doing here?

692
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:43,841
- Wendy not now.

693
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,013
- Yes now.

694
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,841
Look at those things.

695
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:47,925
Is that why mom left

696
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,307
because she knew what you were doing here?

697
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,434
- I quit because of this honey.

698
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,264
- Really?

699
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,644
- Yeah.

700
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:55,725
- When?

701
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,152
Before or after that?

702
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,481
- Look I'm not gonna stand here
and say that I'm guiltless.

703
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,033
I do wanna talk about this
but now's not the time

704
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:04,859
or the place honey, come on.

705
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,410
- No don't touch me.

706
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,657
<i>_</i> [Jim] Wendy.

707
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,498
- I got her.

708
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:12,700
- Good, good.

709
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,627
Scott I'm gonna go look
around, you stay put,

710
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:16,579
sit right there.

711
00:49:17,538 --> 00:49:19,131
When they get back lock the door.

712
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,272
- Wendy.

713
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,536
Wendy?

714
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:44,049
Jesus.

715
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,210
Cozy spot.

716
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,562
Hey, your dad said he quit

717
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,732
because of what was going on here.

718
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,809
- You believe him?

719
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,690
- He's always been straight with me.

720
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:09,116
- I don't know what to think
after what I saw over there.

721
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,160
He always told me his
work here was so important

722
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,205
that was why he had to
spend so much time here.

723
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,373
- Well maybe that's true.

724
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,501
Even if it's not at least he tried

725
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,874
to come up with something.

726
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,464
What'd I get from my dad?

727
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:27,968
He's an asshole.

728
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,512
Trust me, your dad, he's cool.

729
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,814
- Are you just saying that to
try to make me feel better?

730
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,354
- Wendy, I'm not full
of shit all the time.

731
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,779
- Just 90%?

732
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:50,941
- Maybe 75.

733
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,162
- What?

734
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:03,872
- You got a little dirt.

735
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:10,594
- You know, I think that's
the first time you've tried

736
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,467
to touch me above the neck.

737
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,217
- Let's get outta here.

738
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:19,598
- Yeah.

739
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,087
- Fuck this.

740
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,351
- Who the hell are you?

741
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,929
- My, my name's Wendy Stockton
we're here with my dad.

742
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:02,854
- Stockton?

743
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:05,270
You're Stockton's daughter?

744
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,191
' [Wendy] Yeah.

745
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,360
- And future son in law.

746
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,186
- Where is he?

747
00:53:09,395 --> 00:53:11,523
- [Wendy] He's down the hall
in that room on the left.

748
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,152
- Alright, follow me.

749
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,077
- This place is a psycho ward.

750
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,117
- Hello?

751
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:22,620
Hello?

752
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:33,797
- Jim.

753
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,467
Jim!

754
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:37,924
Shit, where is he?

755
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,759
- He was here, so was Scott.

756
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,595
- Oh shit, come on.

757
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:43,520
Come on!

758
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,295
- [Scott] Oh man.

759
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:30,938
- Hello?

760
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,035
<i>Oh man.</i>

761
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:54,753
Oh shit!

762
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,763
- [Scott] Some popcorn
you know what I'm saying.

763
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,341
Some pop yeah rinse it all up.

764
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,471
Alright.

765
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,102
Yeah, get some pop.

766
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,121
- Run Scott!

767
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,047
Go!

768
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:16,999
Don't stop!

769
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:19,877
Keep going!

770
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:25,719
" Dad!

771
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,555
- Daddy!

772
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,385
- Get back!

773
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:29,311
Stay back!

774
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,003
Shit.

775
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:05,801
Come on.

776
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:22,985
- Daddy!

777
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,118
Joanne we have to go after him.

778
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,868
We have to go after him
and try to help him.

779
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:32,074
- Wendy no, Wendy no
there's nothing we can do.

780
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,033
Wendy come on.

781
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:33,867
- But maybe he can hear us.

782
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:34,827
- [Joanne] Wendy we have
to go somewhere safe.

783
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:35,661
- [Wendy] Daddy!

784
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:36,745
- [Joanne] Wendy, Wendy.

785
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:38,797
- I don't wanna leave him here.

786
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,374
- Come on, come on let's go.

787
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,299
- Come on.

788
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,797
I gotta figure out how to
stop this thing, come on.

789
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,684
Alright Scott where's the knife?

790
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,101
- No we gotta go back, we gotta go back.

791
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,679
- Scott, Scott, Scott!

792
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,638
Come here and listen to me.

793
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:55,472
Scott.

794
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:56,307
- What the fuck are you doing?

795
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:57,391
- Your father is dead okay?

796
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,225
Scott.

797
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,059
- Fuck off.

798
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,610
- He killed him alright understand?

799
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,109
Scott, he killed everybody else here.

800
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,281
That's what it does, it kills Scott okay?

801
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,233
Where is the knife?

802
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,943
- I don't know where the knife is.

803
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:08,868
- Hey!

804
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,079
- Alright, come on.

805
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,953
- Where?

806
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,333
- Oh shit.

807
00:58:19,538 --> 00:58:23,384
Alright, you can stay or you can come.

808
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,334
It's your choice.

809
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:53,496
Alright Mark take the gun.

810
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:55,791
If you hear anything
shoot through the door.

811
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,373
Alright Scott, Scott give me the knife.

812
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,962
- Did my father help
you make him this way?

813
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:13,096
- No, your father created a
virus that regenerated tissue

814
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,143
even made it stronger.

815
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,765
We all knew the medical benefits

816
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,816
but we didn't just work for
Gentec we worked for the army

817
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:25,271
and they wanted to take the
project in a different direction

818
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:29,200
they wanted us to create
some kind of a super soldier.

819
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,116
- We're dead.

820
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:34,163
- When you father found out
what they wanted us to do

821
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,079
he resigned.

822
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:40,869
- Does it hurt?

823
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:52,180
I remember you from somewhere.

824
00:59:55,217 --> 00:59:56,560
You used to come to me.

825
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,306
Was it in a dream?

826
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:02,232
- No.

827
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,532
- I was hurting, you made me live.

828
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:11,449
- Yeah.

829
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,822
- Are you God?

830
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,747
- No.

831
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,837
- Why was the boy so important to you?

832
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,124
- He's my son.

833
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,101
- I remember a father somewhere.

834
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,943
- We found Thor out in the desert.

835
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:50,943
- Thor?

836
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,900
- Yeah, transmuted human organism

837
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,405
I forgot who came up with it.

838
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,780
It was almost like he'd
been put there for us.

839
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,707
He'd fallen from the
ledge, he was brain dead,

840
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,250
massive trauma.

841
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,327
We almost had to amputate one of his arms.

842
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,506
- Look like he had more than
his share of arms to me.

843
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,504
- They put the virus in him.

844
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:11,085
- That's right, and it worked.

845
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:13,261
- [Wendy] What gave you the right?

846
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,929
- Well he would have died
if we hadn't used the virus.

847
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,757
- [Wendy] Well maybe
he was supposed to die?

848
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:18,717
- Your dad didn't think so.

849
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,768
Nursed him back to health.

850
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:23,973
He even got kind of close
to him, like a father.

851
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,900
Your dad was a good man.

852
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:27,942
- Yeah?

853
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:28,860
How good?

854
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,402
- What's that supposed to mean?

855
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,655
- I used to hear my
parents arguing at night,

856
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,111
I heard you name.

857
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:42,373
- [Thor] You fed me soup.

858
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,165
- Chicken noodle.

859
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,131
- You read to me.

860
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,755
- The Hardy Boys.

861
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,676
- Yes.

862
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,218
I liked them.

863
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,851
Why didn't you let me die?

864
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:06,601
- I couldn't.

865
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,025
- I wanted it all to end.

866
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,438
- You jumped from that cliff.

867
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,072
Oh God I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

868
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,445
- How long before I die?

869
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:26,869
- Oh the tragedy is that
you're never gonna die.

870
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,209
You're gonna live 1,000 years.

871
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:33,842
You're gonna live forever.

872
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,014
- That is easier said than done, friend.

873
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:56,610
Just,

874
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,068
look at me.

875
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,498
Things are happening to me.

876
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:16,478
- Something <i>seems</i> to
be eating away at him.

877
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,235
Instead of regenerating the
tissues are degenerating

878
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:20,907
and I don't know why.

879
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:23,989
Wait a minute.

880
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,078
Come on.

881
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:32,414
Come on.

882
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:34,541
Okay.

883
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,626
Okay, we're feeding him steriles.

884
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,085
- Steriles?

885
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,170
- Yeah it's the root form of cholesterol

886
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:46,554
and somehow if he doesn't get a dose,

887
01:04:46,758 --> 01:04:48,726
the virus seems to be eating away at him.

888
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,018
He needs steriles.

889
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,271
That's why he took Frank's brains.

890
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:56,818
- Took what?

891
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,443
- I have an idea but I need your help.

892
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:19,132
- What's this?

893
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,379
- Our only chance, come on.

894
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:31,310
- [Scott] It's cold, it's cold.

895
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,263
- Alright, here's what we do.

896
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:35,940
Alright Mark.

897
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:36,767
- It's cold.

898
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:37,601
- Mark I need you to make some holes

899
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:38,856
in these Freon pipes okay?

900
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:39,686
- Freon?

901
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:40,770
- Yeah.

902
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:41,605
- You're insane.

903
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,531
- No it's okay I turned it off out there.

904
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,781
Scott, I need you to open these up.

905
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:52,957
Are you okay?

906
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:53,875
- Yeah, yeah.

907
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,623
- If you want I can
put you somewhere safe.

908
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:57,704
- No it's alright.

909
01:05:57,912 --> 01:05:58,629
. Okay-

910
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,505
Wendy there's something that I wanna say.

911
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:14,187
Urn you were right, I was
in love with your father

912
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,600
but your parents didn't
split up because of me.

913
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:20,944
Your father loved you guys so much

914
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,396
he wouldn't let that happen.

915
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:27,070
- You know you don't have
to tell me all of this.

916
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:27,992
- But I want to.

917
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,415
When your dad left I was pretty hurt

918
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:40,623
and I think, I think one of
the reasons I stayed on here,

919
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,583
besides pure ambition was to spite him.

920
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,889
I just, I just wanted you to know that.

921
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:54,853
- Joanne, thank you.

922
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,159
- [Joanne] Alright Mark is it secure?

923
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:10,986
- Got it.

924
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:12,912
- Okay Scott feed this through to Wendy.

925
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:19,953
- [Scott] Wendy you got it?

926
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:20,878
' [Wendy] Yeah.

927
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:24,833
- Alright we're gonna connect these cables

928
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,918
and we're gonna put out the brains okay?

929
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,752
Go! Go, go, go!

930
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:49,749
Go, go, go!

931
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,002

932
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,185
Alright Scott take these cables through.

933
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,203
Alright turn it on Scott.

934
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:30,873
Oh shit.

935
01:11:51,933 --> 01:11:52,980
- [Mark] It's working.

936
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,151
- Alright Scott switch.

937
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,157
Good we're back on.

938
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,078
Okay.

939
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:09,371
Yeah come on.

940
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,621
Alright switch over again Scott.

941
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,176
Alright we're back on.

942
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,529
Come on go inside, come on, come on.

943
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,752
Alright Mark it's time to go.

944
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:01,711
Come on.

945
01:13:01,919 --> 01:13:02,715
- Let's go.

946
01:13:08,843 --> 01:13:09,639
- Let's go.

947
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:12,972
- Wait Mark.

948
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:13,976
Be careful.

949
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:20,154
- First time you made the first move.

950
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,083
' [Wendy] Okay.

951
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:51,848
. Okay-

952
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,734
- Oh my God he's right behind them.

953
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,449
- Get out of there, come
on get out of there!

954
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,388
- [Wendy] He's gonna get Mark!

955
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:29,431
Oh my God.

956
01:14:29,632 --> 01:14:30,258
- [Scott] No!

957
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:31,092
- [Wendy] Mark!

958
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,223
- [Scott] Don't you go out there.

959
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,107
- We've got to go get him!

960
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,433
- Stop it.

961
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:40,359
Stop it.

962
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:43,464
- Alright, the freezer
should hold him for a while,

963
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:44,961
give us time to think.

964
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,634
- Wait a minute think?

965
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:47,460
What do you mean think?

966
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:49,466
Let's think about the front door.

967
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,717
- We can't get out the front door.

968
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:51,797
My hand isn't coded.

969
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,099
- Then we'll dig our way out.

970
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:02,100
- This place is encased
in six feet of concrete.

971
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:03,434
- Joanne we're never
gonna get out of here.

972
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:05,485
I mean we're gonna be
trapped in here forever.

973
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,233
- No, no don't say that, don't say that.

974
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:09,236
Tell her we're gonna
get outta here alright?

975
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,662
So we're just supposed
to wait here and die?

976
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:16,580
We're just supposed to
wait here for him to come

977
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:18,033
and tear our brains out?

978
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,059
- What do we do?

979
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,602
What if the door doesn't hold?

980
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,309
Think, think.

981
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:43,641
Okay.

982
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:55,828
- Altimeter, the model, flaps, control...

983
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:58,159
- What?

984
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,422
- The, the controls on the, the airplane.

985
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:20,057
I, I remember them but
I wouldn't tell him.

986
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:26,692
And he died thinking that I hated him.

987
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,316
- No he didn't.

988
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,411
- Fuck .

989
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,617
I'm such an asshole.

990
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,374
- No Scott he knew you loved him.

991
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:46,579
- I did.

992
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,836
- I know you did, so did I.

993
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,172
It's okay.

994
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:55,967
- I did.

995
01:17:58,382 --> 01:17:59,725
- Jim.

996
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:01,893
That's it, that's it.

997
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,897
Scott, Wendy I think I
know a way out of here.

998
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,561
Come with me.

999
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:10,485
Come on.

1000
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,123
- Wait Joanne, where are we going?

1001
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:30,046
- We need to find your father.

1002
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:30,964
- Why?

1003
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,128
- His hand is our only way out of here.

1004
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,213
- What'?
- ohh.

1005
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,138
- Yeah.

1006
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:40,933
- Are you serious?
- No, no, no!

1007
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,101
No there's no way that I'm gonna do that,

1008
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:43,928
there's no way.

1009
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,514
- Look it's either that
or we stay here and die.

1010
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:52,940
Come on.

1011
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:13,044
Scott stay close.

1012
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:38,698
- Oh my God.

1013
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:42,615
Daddy?

1014
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:54,461
- Dad we, we, we ah...

01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,219
- Alright Wendy come on.

1017
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,469
- Hey get up.

1018
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:11,315

- Don't look.

1027
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:23,694
- Come on be a man!

1028
01:20:23,902 --> 01:20:24,653

1029
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:29,746
- Wait, Scott wait!

1030

Oh he's alive, he's alive.

1031
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:33,545
Get him up, get him up.

1032

<i>_</i> Dad?

1033
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,012
- We gotta get outta here.

1034
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,304
You hurt bad?

1035
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,848
- I think my legs broken.

1036
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:45,766
- Come on.

1037
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,268
We have to hurry.

- Take it easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

1039

Easy .

1040
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,328
You coulda let me know
what was going on Joanne.

1041
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,077
The last time I saw him he
was a 90 pound weakling.

1042
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,124
I never saw rage like that.

1043
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:13,453
- No one knew Jim, Alex
was pumping him up.

1044
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:28,888
My God.

1045
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:32,347
Oh dear.

1046
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:33,897
The emergency system's down.

1047
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:34,974
- Oh my God.

1048
01:21:36,683 --> 01:21:37,559
- What was that?

1049
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:41,947
- No, no, the other direction.

1050
01:21:58,247 --> 01:21:59,874
- [Scott] No dad no!

1051
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,297
- [Wendy] Daddy!

1052
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:03,502
- [Scott] I can't see anything!

1053
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:04,677
- Jim he's got Wendy I'm going after him.

1054
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,130
- Wait no not right now.

1055
01:22:06,338 --> 01:22:07,635
You won't last two seconds
with that son of a bitch,

1056
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:08,932
we need light.

1057
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:09,975

Wait a minute wait sound, sound...

- What are you talking about?

1060
01:22:13,095 --> 01:22:15,939
- When the, the microwave
it freaked him out.

1061
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:18,438
We can get him with the sound.

1062
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:20,610
- The control room, we can
use the intercom, come on.

1063
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:21,528
- Alright let's do it.

1064
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:22,980
- Yeah come on, come
on, let's go, let's go.

1065
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,285
- [Joanne] Alright we've
gotta get the power back on

1066
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:12,363
if we wanna use the intercom.

1067
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:13,823
- [Jim] What about a manual override?

1068
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,908
- [Joanne] I've tried, nothing.

1069
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,789
- What about the fuse box?

1070
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,870
- [Joanne] Oh come on Jim, a blown fuse?

1071
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,258
- Cross your fingers.

1072
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:11,972
- Unbelievable.

1073
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:12,798
- Yes.

1074
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:13,802
- Go Scott.

1075
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:19,851
