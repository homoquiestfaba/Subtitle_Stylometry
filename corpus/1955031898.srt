the five guys who hired me
to represent them

75
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,154
because you're not
honoring your claim.

honors every claim.

81
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:39,567
up to the limit
of their liability,

which is $100,000
per accident,

your description,
"He hit my five guys."

had one accident.

five things happened.

aren't bowling pins,

95
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,635
as much as your guy
may have treated them
as such.

96
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:14,969
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

97
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:17,806
If your house
is insured for $100,000

98
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,841
and a tornado
carries it away,

99
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:21,543
it carried away one house.

100
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,011
It didn't pick up
every stick of furniture

101
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:25,714
and destroy it
in a separate incident.

102
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:28,483
If that is
what you're saying,

103
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:31,753
well, then there is never
any limit to our liability

104
00:12:31,786 --> 00:12:34,789
and that is the end
of the insurance business.

105
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,991

nobody is safe.

122

Homicidal. We had
the in-laws for the holiday.

123
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:18,933

she'll have
good representation.

doesn't know any lawyers.

132

tossed it into our lap.

135

136
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,836
It's important
to our country, Jim,

137
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:56,805
that this man is seen
as getting a fair shake.

138
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:58,840
American justice
will be on trial.

139
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,775
Well, of course,
when you put it that way,

140
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:02,777
it's an honor to be asked.

141
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,712
But, Lynn,
I'm an insurance lawyer.

142
00:14:04,746 --> 00:14:06,681
I haven't done
criminal work in years.

143
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,716
It's like riding a bike,
isn't it?

144
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,819
You distinguished yourself
at Nuremberg.

145
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:12,554
I was on
the prosecution team.

146
00:14:12,587 --> 00:14:13,822
Not the point.

147
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:14,889
You're no stranger
to criminal law.

148
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,892
Jim, look at the situation.

149
00:14:17,926 --> 00:14:19,961
The man is publicly reviled.

150
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,995
And I will be, too.

151
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,864
Yes, in more
ignorant quarters.

152
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:24,732
But that's exactly why
this has to be done,

153
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,835
and capably done.

154
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:28,837
It can't look like
our justice system

155
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,938
tosses people
on the ash heap.

156
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,846
Suppose I did,
what's the evidence
look like?

157
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,615
Pretty overwhelming.

158
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:43,117
Great. Great.

159
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,787
Everyone will hate me
but at least I'll lose.

160
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,922
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

161
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,024
Well, what do
you think, Tom?

162
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:52,727
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

163
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,796
I think
it's a patriotic duty.

164
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:56,798
It's an important mission.

165
00:14:56,831 --> 00:14:59,033
I told Lynn,
the firm can't say no,

166
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,135
and you'd have a tough time
saying no, too.

167
00:15:02,737 --> 00:15:05,607
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

168
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,642
So, you're doing it?

169
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:09,010
JAMES: Doing what?

170
00:15:09,043 --> 00:15:12,046
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

171
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,381
I may. I have to speak to...

172
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:16,050
Wait, how do you know?
Did they post it
on the bulletin board?

173
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,152
No, I... I was
talking to Richard Earl...

174
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:20,088
Look, if I do this,
I'm going to need your help.

00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,893
Can you work tonight?

177
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:27,962
Well, I have
a dinner date, sir.

178
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,902
It's Tuesday, right?
Yeah, no, I'm free,
completely free.

179
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,036
Thank you, sir.

180
00:15:39,073 --> 00:15:40,909
JAMES: But it's also an honor.

181
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,044
And the Bar Association
asked me

182
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:44,846
because they want
to show that even a spy

183
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,648
gets a capable advocate.

184
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,816
Well, maybe it's
the kind of honor
we could do without.

185
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,151
Hey, honey,
what are you doing home?

186
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,186
I got stood up.

187
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:56,157
Well, that's despicable.

188
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,759
Who is this knot-head?

189
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:58,960
I'd rather not say.

190
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:01,129
MARY: Well, sit down.
We just started.

191
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,330
People are scared.

192
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:04,198
They're building
bomb shelters
to protect themselves

193
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,634
from people like this man.

194
00:16:06,668 --> 00:16:07,835
I go to the store,

195
00:16:07,869 --> 00:16:11,172
people are buying
canned food
and potassium tablets.

196
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:14,008
It's all about this man
and what he represents.

197
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:16,110
He's a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

198
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:17,946
ROGER: Who's a traitor?
The Rosenbergs were traitors.

199
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:18,880
Who were they?

200
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,982
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

201
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:22,984
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

202
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,086
You can't accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

203
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,654
He's not an American.

204
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,056
(SOFTLY)
Oh, listen to yourself.

205
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:29,724
You're defending him already.

206
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:30,792
You're rehearsing it on me.

207
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:32,827
You said you were
just thinking about taking it.

208
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,730
I am just thinking about it,
just very hard.

209
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:38,700
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

210
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,034
Jim, what do we deserve?

211
00:16:40,068 --> 00:16:42,003
Do you know how
people will look at us?

212
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,205
The family of a man
trying to free a traitor?

213
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,140
He's not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

214
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:47,709
(PHONE RINGING)
Roger, get that!
He's not a traitor...

215
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,977
Why do I have to do
all the work?

216
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,812
Oh! You wait
till we say grace.
I'm hungry!

217
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:52,213
He's about the most unpopular
man in this country,

218
00:16:52,246 --> 00:16:53,848
and you're trying
to take second place!

219
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:55,283
Yeah, and I'm third.

220
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,285
JAMES: Carol, you just
dated the wrong guy.
I wanna eat.

221
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:58,853
Mary, don't make
this an argument

222
00:16:58,886 --> 00:16:59,887
when we're not having
an argument.

223
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,189
You're against him,
I'm for him?

224
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:04,025
No, I'm not for him.
I'm not for the Russians
spying on us.

225
00:17:04,058 --> 00:17:07,028
I'm for his right
to have a defense
in a court of law,

226
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:09,063
which is why they call it
a court of law.

227
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,965
I didn't mean
to interrupt dinner.

228
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:12,200
A court of law...
Hey, Doug.

229
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:16,904
Oh, no, not at all.
Hello, Doug.
Jim was just flailing.

230
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:19,173
I'm not flailing.
Go ahead, Doug, you
can join us for dinner.

231
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,009
We're having
meatloaf tonight.

232
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,813
So, you came over
to help Jim think about

233
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,048
whether he's
taking the case?

234
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:29,951
Oh, we're taking it!
It's exciting, isn't it?

we are about to receive.

Good morning, sir.
My name is Jim Donovan.

240

These are my credentials.

241
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:57,812
I am a partner in
Watters, Cowan and Donovan.

242
00:17:57,845 --> 00:18:01,215
I was admitted to
the New York Bar in 1941.

(CHAIN RATTLING)

244
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:09,123
You have been charged
with three counts
and 19 overt acts.

245
00:18:09,157 --> 00:18:11,826
Conspiracy to transmit
United States defense

246
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,361

to the Soviet Union,

conspiracy to
gather secrets,

and failing to register
as a foreign agent.

249
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:25,339
Do many foreign
agents register?

250

If you don't mind
my asking, sir,

251
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:37,085
since your arrest,
where have you been?

252
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,056
I couldn't say for certain.

253
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:45,259
You don't know?

254
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:48,996
They drove me to an airport

255
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,165
and put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

256
00:18:53,301 --> 00:18:54,836
Somewhere hot.

257
00:18:56,037 --> 00:18:57,071
It's hot here.

258
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:00,041
Hotter, very humid.

259
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:02,009

00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,246
Were you beaten?

261
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,281
No.

262
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,283
I was talked to.

263
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,385
Offers were made.

264
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,487
What do you mean?

Offers of employment,
to work for your government.

266
00:19:18,326 --> 00:19:20,962
I was told if I cooperated,

267
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,164
no further charges
would be made against me.

268
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:26,000
And I would be given money.

269
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,436
Hmm.

270
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,037

I can't endorse that.

to urge you

to cooperate with
the U.S. government.

Well, I said no.

276
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:45,086
Perhaps you could relay
to your friends at the CIA
that I meant it.

No, no, no.

for the agency.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

353
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:55,269
Okay, drivers,
here's the deal.

354
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,606
You've been selected
for a mission

355
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,174
which you are
not to discuss

356
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,476
with anyone
outside of this room.

357
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,245
No one.

358
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,313
I don't care who you trust.

359
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:08,315
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

360
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:10,317
The good Lord
when you pray at night.

361
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,286
You don't tell
any of them anything

362
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:14,121
of what
I'm about to tell you.

363
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:19,360
Each of you drivers has
met certain qualifications.

364
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:22,430
High level
security clearance.

365
00:24:22,463 --> 00:24:24,231
Exceptional pilot ratings

366
00:24:24,265 --> 00:24:26,233
in excess of
the required hours flight time

367
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:28,202
in a single-seat aircraft.

368
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,205
We are engaged in a war.

369
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:33,474
This war does not,
for the moment,
involve men-at-arms.

370
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:35,376
It involves information.

371
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,611
You will be
collecting information.

372
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:40,481
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

373
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:44,151
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand

374
00:24:44,185 --> 00:24:46,720
in a full
thermonuclear exchange
with the Soviet Union.

375
00:24:48,756 --> 00:24:50,191
Or it could prevent one.

376
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,727
For public purposes,

377
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,529

00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:59,567
your mission does not exist.

380
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,436
If it does not exist,
you do not exist.

381
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,573
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

382
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:13,647
You work for the CIA now.

384
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,397
So, Jim, I heard
your guy is speaking
with a phony accent.

385
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:33,501
Does he keep that up
all the time?

386
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,270
Actually, I'm pretty sure
that's just the way he talks.

387
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:38,405
He's got the Russian name
but a British passport.

388
00:25:38,439 --> 00:25:41,342
Well, I doubt
that that's genuine.

389
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,644
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

390
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,280
Yes, uh, Judge, you see,

391
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:50,684
I just don't think
that three weeks
is going to do it, here.

392
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:52,686
We... We got
a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

393
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,787
You wanna postpone?

394
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:54,989
Six weeks.

395
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:58,492
I mean, there's just myself
and my associate, basically.

396
00:25:58,526 --> 00:25:59,727
Jim, is this serious?

397
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,761
Sir?

398
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,599
Is this serious?

399
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,268
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

400
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,702
You can see
in the filing...

401
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:11,572
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

Of course, I salute you.

We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:23,250

due process.

he'll be convicted.

all the legal gamesmanship.

475

and that's what
makes us Americans.

makes us Americans

<i>The Article</i>

an 80-foot wingspan.

486
00:31:36,096 --> 00:31:41,602
It's powered by
a single Pratt and Whitney
J57 P-37 engine.

487
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:44,004
10,000 pounds of thrust

488
00:31:44,037 --> 00:31:48,075

of 430 miles an hour.

She may not be quick,

490
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,779
but at your cruising altitude
of 70,000 feet,

491
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,615
nothing will
come close to you.

492

493
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:58,785
The idea is the enemy doesn't
even know you're there.

494
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,687
It looks kind of flimsy.

495
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,694
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude,

496
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,563
and we need
to accommodate the cameras.

497
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:15,669
That's a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

A pin-sharp
panoramic camera

four times as powerful
as any aerial reconnaissance

There seems to be
a subsection
to this list here.

00:33:20,968 --> 00:33:22,970
Well, most of this stuff
came from his studio,

from the hotel room

Where we found him.

Well, yeah.

00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:35,782
The what?

522
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,753
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

523
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,121
There was a warrant.

524
00:33:41,154 --> 00:33:43,223
A civil detention writ
for the arrest of an alien,

525
00:33:43,256 --> 00:33:45,125
but there was

Should it become necessary

875

over Soviet territory,

876

the fuselage.

Now, first,
you activate the circuits.

879

But to start
the 70-second timer,

880
00:52:52,271 --> 00:52:55,174
you need to flip the switch

is a foregone conclusion,

889
00:53:23,235 --> 00:53:25,271
you go down with your plane.

890
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:28,207
Now, if you think
you can ditch and get away,

891
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,909

to a border, fine.

until it no longer
suited our government
to so treat him.

919

920

he was not given
the protections

1046
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:33,872
They want their man back
before he cracks.

1047
01:04:33,905 --> 01:04:36,842
And we want Powers back
for the same reasons.

1048
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:42,547
JAMES: I think
you are saying, sir,

1049
01:04:42,581 --> 01:04:45,016
that there might be
a happy ending for everyone.

1050
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:48,019
Yes, if we, um,
indulge their fiction.

1051
01:04:56,194 --> 01:04:58,630
We want you
to negotiate the swap

1052
01:04:58,663 --> 01:04:59,831
because you're
a private citizen,

1053
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:02,033
so it's not
governments talking.

1054
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:04,769
They don't acknowledge
Abel as a Soviet citizen,

1055
01:05:04,803 --> 01:05:08,573
and we don't
acknowledge East Germany
as a sovereign country.

1056
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,875
We haven't
recognized East Berlin

1057
01:05:09,908 --> 01:05:12,644
since it was annexed
by the Soviets in '45.

1058
01:05:12,677 --> 01:05:15,881
So I act as a negotiator,
representing...

1059
01:05:15,914 --> 01:05:17,749
You're not
representing anybody.

1060
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:18,817
Not a government official.

1061
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,019
You have no
official standing.

1062
01:05:21,052 --> 01:05:23,054
So, some fiction
on our side as well.

1063
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,389
Correct.

1064
01:05:24,422 --> 01:05:27,792
Which means, of course,
you can't rely on
any acknowledgment

1065
01:05:27,826 --> 01:05:30,595
or help if things go south.

1066
01:05:30,629 --> 01:05:32,697
CIA can't be responsible.

1067
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:34,032
We can't be embarrassed.

1068
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:39,104
Where do they want this
negotiation to take place?

1069
01:05:39,137 --> 01:05:40,705
There.

1070
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:41,940
"There"?

1071
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:43,141
East Berlin.

1072
01:05:45,744 --> 01:05:47,913
Well, isn't East Berlin
getting rather...

1073
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:50,148
Oh, yes, the place
is getting complicated.

1074
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,184
Yeah, complicated.

1075
01:05:56,154 --> 01:05:59,658
The Soviet side has been
setting up checkpoints
for the past few months

1076
01:05:59,691 --> 01:06:01,993
to try to stop people
hemorrhaging to
the Western sectors,

1077
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:03,862
and it hasn't worked.

1078
01:06:03,895 --> 01:06:05,697
We have intelligence
to suggest

1079
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,866
that they may go
one step further

1080
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:10,001
and wall off
the entire Eastern sector.

1081

in a nutshell.

Well, fine. Fine.

remains confidential.

give it back to me.

No, no. I...
I mean, now.

1216
01:14:53,357 --> 01:14:55,359
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines

1217
01:14:55,393 --> 01:14:57,628
but local calls
are okay.

1218
01:14:57,662 --> 01:14:59,497
Someone will pick up
day and night.

1219
01:15:08,339 --> 01:15:11,676
Now, this docket
attached to your passport
will serve as your ticket

1220
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:13,611
into and out of
the Eastern Soviet
sector.

1221
01:15:15,713 --> 01:15:17,482
The meeting with Vogel
is set for noon tomorrow.

1222
01:15:24,355 --> 01:15:26,257
There are only a few routes
left to the East.

1223
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:28,493
You take the S-Bahn,
the station we showed you
on the way in.

1224
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:30,795
You're gonna get off
at the Friedrichstrasse
station here

1225
01:15:30,828 --> 01:15:33,731
and walk to the Soviet embassy
on Unter den Linden here.

1226
01:15:33,764 --> 01:15:36,400
Look at the map now.
You shouldn't take it
with you.

1227
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:38,536
You're looking at a map,
you're an American,
you're a spy.

1228
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:40,571
You could
well be detained.

1229
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:42,673
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1230
01:15:42,707 --> 01:15:45,643
You don't...
You don't belong,
so don't stick out.

1231
01:15:45,676 --> 01:15:47,778
Food is scarce over there
and things have started
to fall apart.

1232
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,013
There are gangs,

1233
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:52,316
and rule of law
is less firmly
established over there.

1234
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:54,352
And definitely stay away
from the Wall.

1235
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:55,553
On their side,
there's a line

1236
01:15:55,586 --> 01:15:56,621
cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1237
01:15:56,654 --> 01:15:58,356
They call it
the "Death Line."

1238
01:15:58,389 --> 01:16:00,291
Cross it and
you'll be shot.

1239
01:16:00,324 --> 01:16:02,660
Is there any outcome here
where I'm not either
detained or shot?

1240
01:16:02,693 --> 01:16:05,296
Don't worry too much
about what Michener said.

1241
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:07,365
No, I'm worried about
what you're saying.

"And now they're impatient
to trade him,

1385
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:45,068
"hoping to get in return
this man, Powers,

1386
01:26:45,102 --> 01:26:47,204
"that, perhaps,
has not yet given up

1387
01:26:47,237 --> 01:26:49,239
"all the information
that he has to give."

1388
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:53,243
This is not
an equitable trade, sir.

1389
01:26:54,511 --> 01:26:56,146
But what you're saying is,

1390
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:58,182
if Powers has given up
everything he knows,

1391
01:26:58,215 --> 01:27:00,450
then Moscow would trade?

1392
01:27:00,484 --> 01:27:02,052
Why wouldn't they?

1393
01:27:03,220 --> 01:27:06,256
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison,

1394
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:08,959
the next Russian operative
who gets caught

1395
01:27:08,992 --> 01:27:11,028
might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1396
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:16,400
And you never know.
Abel might want to
see the sky again

1397
01:27:16,433 --> 01:27:19,469
and decide to trade
Russian secrets for
small American favors.

1398
01:27:23,307 --> 01:27:25,375
How can we know this?

1399
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:29,079
We little men,
we just do our jobs.

1400
01:27:29,112 --> 01:27:31,448
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He's just a pilot.

1401
01:27:34,284 --> 01:27:38,121
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet

1402
01:27:38,155 --> 01:27:39,289
when he was shot
from the sky.

1403
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:42,359
People in my country
consider this

1404
01:27:42,392 --> 01:27:44,228
an act of war.

1405
01:27:46,563 --> 01:27:49,333
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, sir.

1406
01:27:49,366 --> 01:27:51,134
The next mistake
our countries make

1407
01:27:51,168 --> 01:27:52,936
could be the last one.

1408
01:27:54,137 --> 01:27:56,406
We need to have
the conversation

1409
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:58,141
our governments can't.

1410
01:28:03,447 --> 01:28:06,116
I will ask Moscow.

1411
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:08,118
Who knows
what they will say.

1412
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:11,388
There are a lot of people,
Mr. Donovan,

1413
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:15,525
who doesn't want this
exchange to ever take place.

1414
01:28:18,462 --> 01:28:21,999
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

1415
01:28:22,032 --> 01:28:23,033
Powers for Abel.

1416
01:28:23,066 --> 01:28:24,534
And Frederic Pryor.

1417
01:28:24,568 --> 01:28:26,069
As I said,

1418
01:28:26,103 --> 01:28:28,272
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs of

1419
01:28:28,305 --> 01:28:30,507

Democratic Republic.

1420
01:28:30,540 --> 01:28:33,110
I'm confident you can
make arrangements.

01:28:33,143 --> 01:28:35,445
I am merely a secretary

1422
01:28:35,479 --> 01:28:37,180
in the embassy
of foreign power.

1423
01:28:37,214 --> 01:28:38,548
Okay, okay.

1424
01:28:38,582 --> 01:28:42,185
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I'll give you his address.

1425

There actually is
a Mr. Vogel?

1426
01:28:44,187 --> 01:28:46,456
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

1427
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,392
Uh, it's a short cab ride.

1428
01:28:49,593 --> 01:28:52,429
And please, Mr. Donovan,

1429
01:28:52,462 --> 01:28:54,298
wear an overcoat
in this weather.

1430
01:28:56,099 --> 01:28:57,301
I had mine
stolen from me.

1431
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,304
What do you expect?

1432
01:29:00,337 --> 01:29:02,172
It was from
Saks Fifth Avenue.

1433
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:04,408
Wasn't it?

But the Soviets decided
not to host me.

Yes. And interest
in the proceedings.

Oh.

1446

Frederic Pryor,

1457
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:20,317
he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1458
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:23,420
But every accident,
properly viewed,

1459
01:30:23,453 --> 01:30:25,555
is an opportunity,
isn't it, Mr. Donovan?

1460
01:30:25,589 --> 01:30:28,558
Well...
Your country refuses
to recognize

1461
01:30:28,592 --> 01:30:31,261
the German
Democratic Republic.

1462
01:30:31,294 --> 01:30:33,296
They prefer to
make up stories

1463

exist, for instance.

We will produce
Rudolf Abel.

You will produce,
at the same time,
the student, Pryor.

At the same time?

1491
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:44,668
Absolutely.

1492
01:31:44,701 --> 01:31:49,272
The exchange on offer
is a Russian at the end
of his life

1493
01:31:51,575 --> 01:31:54,344
for an American student
at the start of his.

1494
01:32:01,284 --> 01:32:04,254
Schischkin? He's not
an embassy secretary.

lose your coat?

You know, spy stuff.

1502

another coat.

said he said he is.

Friend of
the attorney general.

1507
01:32:34,818 --> 01:32:38,522
Just some guy the GDR
tapped to handle this.

1508
01:32:38,555 --> 01:32:40,457
Sounds like
the East Germans

1509
01:32:40,490 --> 01:32:43,226
are fighting for
a place at our table.

puts East Germany
on the map.

But we don't care
about their map.

Stick with
the Russians.

1516
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:59,442
Stick with the Russians.
It's Powers for Abel.

1517
01:32:59,476 --> 01:33:02,612
So, does all this mean
this might actually happen?

1518
01:33:02,646 --> 01:33:04,514
Yeah, that's what
you seem to be telling me.

1519
01:33:04,548 --> 01:33:07,584
We'll put Abel on a plane,
he'll be here Friday.

1520
01:33:07,617 --> 01:33:09,619
So, if Schischkin
gets the okay,

1521
01:33:09,653 --> 01:33:11,821
all that's left
is the mechanics
of the trade.

1522
01:33:11,855 --> 01:33:13,690
How we swap our guy
for their guy.

1523
01:33:13,723 --> 01:33:15,825
Our "guys." Two guys.

it was a good idea

to study Soviet
economics in Berlin

Powers is who we need.

1532

like Powers.

and he let the commies
parade him on television.

say that if it were true

not true.

for pushing,

in any danger

is made?
