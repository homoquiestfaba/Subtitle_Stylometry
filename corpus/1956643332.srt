00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,437
voiceover: In
the spring of 2011,

3
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,440
at the age of 18, my brother Matthew

4
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,510
got his first real girlfriend.

5
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,078
I had somehow thought
that he and I had

6
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,116
an unspoken agreement that
we belonged to each other,

7
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:53,220
which was really
pretty stupid of me.

8
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,468
(bike chains clicking)

9
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,949
(bike rattling)

10
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,853
(birds chirping)

11
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,865
(footsteps)

12
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,033
(door creaks)

13
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,969
- (door slams)
- (bag falls)

14
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,637
(footsteps)

15
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,405
What do you need me to do?

16
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,740
We're in good shape, I think.

17
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,509
- Aren't we, Jeanne?
- Jeanne:  We're fine.

18
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,110
Thank god.

19
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,446
(footsteps)

20
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:56,215

00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,886
(water running)

(rattling)

23
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,098
(footsteps)

24
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,801
I can't believe I'm actually expected
to cook dinner for this girl.

25
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,235
Do you want to eat out?

26
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,704
On me, anywhere in town.

27
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:21,207
What do you need, just tell
me what you want me to do.

28
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,375
Lemme think.

29
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,244
(utensils rattling)

30
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,246
Do these need to be peeled?

31
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,016
- woman sitting:  Yes, just peel them back.
- Okay.

32
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,420
(chair dragging)

33
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,422
(bowl rattles)

34
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:39,659
(slicing and pounding)

35
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,000
(sniffs)

36
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,170
(slicing)

37
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,607
(door squeaks)

38
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:59,846
(door creaks and shuts)

39
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,182
(footsteps)

40
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,019
Yolanda, mama, mama, Yolanda.

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,388
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Thank you for having me.

42
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,257
- Hi, I'm Jeanne.
- Hey, Yolanda.

43
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,325
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

44
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:16,195
- Hi, I've heard so much about you.
- So have I.

45
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,396
Do you know Shirley Chang?

46
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,131
Yes, she's one of my best friends.

47
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,632
How do you know her?

48
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,234
We went to Cunningham
together before she moved.

49
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,270
- I love her so much.
- Yolanda:  She's great.

50
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,339
And we've kept in
touch all these years

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,875
all because she's so good at
keeping up with her friends.

52
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,509
Oh, she's wonderful
about those things.

53
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,978
I can't believe you know her.

54
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:32,913
Mama: Yolanda, can I
get you something to drink?

55
00:03:32,914 --> 00:03:34,180
Oh, no thanks, I'm fine.

56
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,615
- Would you like a tour of the house?
- Yolanda:  Yeah, I would, thanks!

57
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,385
girl with short hair: So Shirley said
that you're working on the school paper.

58
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,619
Yolanda: Yeah, we both
do, actually, next year.

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,088
We're going to be
co-editors together.

60
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,923
voiceover: Oh, (footsteps
drown out voices) cool.

61
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,126
That's why (mumbles) a little bit.

62
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,394
Everything's delicious.

63
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,897
Matthew: Yeah,
this is excellent.

64
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,364
It's really good.

65
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:53,866
The sauce is amazing.

66
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:54,901
Matthew: She made that.

67
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,168
Oh, did you, it's great.

68
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,904
Thanks, yeah, it came out okay.

69
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,539
Could you excuse me a second?

70
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,607
Did you use oregano in it?

71
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,144
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

72
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,880
(coughing)

73
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,150
(retching)

74
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,419
(spitting)

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,923
(toilet flushing)

76
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,192
(spitting)

77
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:27,233
My brother's the cook in our family.

78
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,135
I don't know where he gets it
from, certainly not my mom.

79
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,603
She cooks as little as possible.

80
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,705
Really, did she cook for
you when you were growing up?

81
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:36,375
Actually, my dad cooked
more when we were growing up.

82
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,878
My mom says women were expected
to cook when she was growing

83
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,680
up and she didn't with
that kind of life.

84
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,817
Oh, well, of course
that's true, but when

85
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,854
there's a family, someone
has to put food on the table.

86
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:50,022
Oh, no, I completely
agree but my mom, she's got

87
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,825
a mind of her own, I
mean I love her but

88
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:56,830
she lives her life the
way she wants to live it.

89
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,106
(footsteps)

90
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,819
You coming upstairs?

91
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,589
Matthew: Okay,
give me a minute.

92
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,794
- (footsteps)
- (keys rattling)

93
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,398
(door creaking)

94
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:45,478
(window screeching and shuddering)

95
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,987
(lighter clicking)

96
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:01,094
(lighter clicking)

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,139
Yolanda's really nice.

98
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,807
Yeah, she's great.

99
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,051
I think I'm having
some kind of breakdown.

100
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,586
I can't keep anything
down and half the time

101
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,756
I don't even want to eat and
last night I woke up at two

102
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,792
and I couldn't get to sleep
the rest of the night.

103
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,495
Do I look okay, are
there bags under my eyes?

104
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,766
- No, you look fine.
- Look.

105
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:49,642
(footsteps)

106
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,686
- Did you sleep with her yet?
- Matthew: No.

107
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,688
Will you tell me if you do?

108
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,823
Matthew: Do you
want to hear it?

109
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,727
Yes, you have to tell
me, even if I freak out.

110
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,229
You have to tell me everything.

111
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:14,500
I won't be able to stand it
if we stopped doing that.

112
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,970
- Do you promise?
- Okay.

113
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,807
Does that make everything okay?

114
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,244
No, everything is terrible.

115
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,717
Do you really like
her better than me?

116
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,685
I don't anybody better
than you but I barely know

117
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,421
this girl, I want
to give it a chance.

118
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:38,257
I want to have sexual relationships.

119
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,691
Yeah, I know, you want to grow up

120
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,760
and you want to have
mature adult relationships

121
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,165
and not immature,
stunted ones like ours.

122
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:56,342
Okay, well, I guess
I'm going to bed.

123
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,278
(heavy footsteps)

124
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,714
(door creaks)

125
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,254
You didn't quite make it.

126
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,956
Don't make fun of me,
I've started to make fun

127
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,359
of me all the time
and I don't like it.

128
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,695
I've really upset, you know?

129
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,433
(crying)

130
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,669
I don't wanna...

131
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,837
I don't wanna leave this room
and I don't want to go back

132
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,009
in and I can't just stand
here for the rest of my life.

133
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,783
Matthew: Drama queen.

134
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:44,057
No, no. (sobbing)

135
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,697
I'm going to get something
to eat, you wanna come?

136
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,533
No, I can't eat now.

137
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,805
What am I going to do?

138
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,476
Go.

139
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,380
Go get something to
eat, I'll be all right.

140
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,382
All right.

141
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,620
(door creaks)

142
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,690
(footsteps)

143
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,611
(fast footsteps)

144
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,823
(door slams)

145
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,333
(birds chirping)

146
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:16,515
Are you writing
anything about Yolanda?

147
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,184
Did you like her?

148
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,920
You two seemed to get along well.

149
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,491
She's really nice.

150
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,461
(birds chirping)

151
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:33,399
Mama, I don't want him
to have a girlfriend.

152
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,968
Yes, you do, you know you do.

153
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,172
Don't talk like that.

154
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,511
No, I really don't.

155
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,089
One of the funny things
about being in love

156
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,791
with your brother
is that you can say

157
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:03,529
almost anything you want
about him to anyone you want

158
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,365
because no one wants to go there.

159
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,033
People will bend
over backwards to put

160
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,471
the blandest possible interpretation
on whatever you say.

161
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,540
(footsteps)

162
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,210
(plate rattles)

163
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,780
(footsteps)

164
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,465
(footsteps)

165
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,538
(plate slides)

166
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,006
(plate rattles)

167
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,343
(footsteps)

168
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:56,014
- (plate rattles)
- (plate slides)

169
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,418
(footsteps)

170
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,028
(wrapper crinkling)

171
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,599
(jar rattles)

172
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,939
(wrapper crinkling)

173
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,595
(jar sliding)

174
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,017
(juice pouring)

175
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,957
I'm not hungry.

176
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,695
(door shuts)

177
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,271
(door creaking)

178
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,810
(footsteps)

179
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,811
Matthew: Hi.

180
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,814
- Mama: Hello, dear.
- Hi.

181
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,318
(footsteps)

182
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,057
Matthew did tell me when he
finally slept with Yolanda.

183
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:49,728
It was a horrible thing
to hear but we always tell

184
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,663
each other everything.

185
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,332
(cards slapping)

186
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,603
(spraying)

187
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,344
I've never slept with anyone,
some of my friends have.

188
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,115
But I think I have a little longer
before I start to feel like a reject.

189
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,283
(combing)

190
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,859
(scissors clipping)

191
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,298
Long ago, Mama told me a
girl like me would attract

192
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,703
more boys in college
than in high school.

193
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,510
(scissors snipping)

194
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,552
What I would like to try actually

195
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,722
is the unmentionable
act, the I word,

196
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:54,426
but that concept doesn't go
over so well with Matthew.

197
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,430
(scissors snipping)

198
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:17,949
(whispering)

199
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,918
(laughing)

200
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,087
boy in blue shirt: Shh.

201
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,524
(whispering)

202
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:41,239
It's not that I'm pretty or anything

203
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,910
but I think I could lure
some guy if I tried.

204
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:48,647
I have no experience but I
just think I could do it.

205
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:52,318
It's not high on my
priority list right now.

206
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:59,058
It's always easy to get the
things you don't care about.

207
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,836
Mama is an extremely good writer.

208
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:14,239
The only thing she writes
is her journal and letters

209
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,009
but her language is amazing,
so strong and clear.

210
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,046
I wish she would try to
get something published

211
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,081
but she has no ambition for that.

212
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,852
(pen scratching)

213
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,790
Mama writes long
letters almost every day

214
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,159
to my older brother Will.

215
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,662
He's studying in Paris.

216
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:40,599
After he gets his degree there,
he'll go back to Berkeley.

217
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,702
Mama misses him so badly.

218
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:47,006
It's really hard for
her, his being away.

219
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,511
Will is great but I don't
miss him like Mama does.

220
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,481
He changes the mood of the
house when he's around.

221
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,718
Everything revolves around
him, not that he's bossy

222
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:04,389
or anything but he's just
got a strong personality.

223
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,226
When he's gone, we all loosen
up, go our separate ways.

224
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,230
I actually like it better like that.

225
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,667
Matthew and Will are really tight.

226
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,570
They talk all the time.

227
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,076
(keys clanking)

228
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,213
As long as I can remember,
Jeanne wanted to grow up

229
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,549
as fast as she could
and become an adult.

230
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,722
You could tell that she
didn't like being a child.

231
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,693
She goes to community college.

232
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,863
She spends a lot of time
with her boyfriend Charles.

233
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,668
He seems like a nice guy but
we don't see that much of him.

234
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,102
One of these days I
expect that Jeanne

235
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,940
will leave home and not look back.

236
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,146
Our father died a few
years after I was born.

237
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:04,415
He was already separated
from Mama then.

238
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,487
Will remembers him but
none of the rest of us do.

239
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,891
We all think that maybe
his death was drug related.

240
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,227
Mama was addicted to drugs long ago.

241
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,298
It was probably
around the same time.

242
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,333
We share everything in our family.

243
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,403
We're impossibly close but
there are things in the past

244
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,973
that we don't know that much about.

245
00:18:27,974 --> 00:18:30,041
They've been mentioned,
they've been explained.

246
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:33,712
We can ask about them if we
want but afterwards, we realized

247
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:37,884
that the important questions
somehow never get answered.

248
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,222
Jeanne: Can't get
him off the phone.

249
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,525
He's having a serious
conversation with a girlfriend.

250
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,261
Was it an argument?

251
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,332
(rattling)

252
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,202
(chewing)

253
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,471
(scraping)

254
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,175
I'll try to get him.

255
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,278
(chair scrapes floor)

256
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,615
(footsteps)

257
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,452
I'm not asking for that.

258
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,691
I'm not asking for anything.

259
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:24,562
I wish there was something
reasonable I could ask for.

260
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:27,066
(door clicks)

261
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:32,304
(distant car honking)

262
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,610
(Matthew swallows)

263
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,682
Well,

264
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,317
I guess

265
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,586
that covers it.

266
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,291
I know.

267
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:57,496
No I don't want that.

268
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,468
I told you that I never said that.

269
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:06,572
I didn't say it and
I don't think it.

270
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,114
(door creaks)

271
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,488
(bed springs creak)

272
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,559
Honestly.

273
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,441
No, I like that about you, I
wish I were more like that.

274
00:20:47,113 --> 00:20:47,947
Yeah.

275
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,824
Go ahead, I'll wait.

276
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,834
(bike chains clicking)

277
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,474
(birds chirping)

278
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,118
(phone vibrates)

279
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:46,205
(cellphone rattles)

280
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:06,192
(phone slides across)

281
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:25,477
- (cellphone rattles)
- (phone slides across)

282
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:28,580
(cellphone vibrates)

283
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:33,152
(phone vibrates)

284
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:43,996
(cellphone rattles)

285
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:51,737
(cellphone vibrates)

286
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,177
(birds chirping)

287
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,083
(bike chains clicking)

288
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:06,284
girl: Hi.

289
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:07,353
Hello dear.

290
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,829
(birds singing)

291
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,167
(footsteps)

292
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:28,374
(bag falls)

293
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:35,280
Did you find what you
needed at the library?

294
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,015
Kind of, I'm just
gonna start writing

295
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,750
and see what happens.

296
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:46,191
Did you know that Matthew
and Yolanda broke up?

297
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:48,860
- Mama: Matthew told me.
- When?

298
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,263
Last night.

299
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:55,333
I gathered from him that they
weren't entirely compatible.

300
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,902
What do you mean?

301
00:23:58,137 --> 00:24:01,173
Mama: He said that he wasn't
comfortable with some of her behavior.

302
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,442
Really?

303
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:15,120
Yolanda is much more
socially outgoing.

304
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:19,924
That's plain to see, it
was a problem for Matthew.

305
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,460
girl: Did she
make him jealous?

306
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,695
I don't know.

307
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:30,301
Yolanda seems like a
perfectly nice sweet girl.

308
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,705
I'm sure she didn't
do anything so awful.

309
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,678
Matthew can be a bit old-fashioned
when it comes to girls,

310
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,250
a little conservative perhaps.

311
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,751
(birds chirping)

312
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:49,287
I think Matthew will be
happier with a quieter girl,

313
00:24:49,288 --> 00:24:52,024
somebody a bit more like himself.

314
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,765
- (door opens)
- (door slams)

315
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,232
Matthew: Hi.

316
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,501
So were you planning on
telling me that you broke up?

317
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,136
Matthew: You
found out already?

318
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:07,905
Everyone in town knows except me.

319
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:09,707
Matthew: I haven't even
seen you since it happened.

320
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,276
You have good sources.

321
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:13,779
You talked to Mama about it.

322
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:19,750
(thuds)

323
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,752
Are you sad?

324
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:25,857
A little bit sad and
a little bit relieved.

325
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,826
- Was she cruel to you?
- Matthew:  No.

326
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,695
She wasn't cruel.

327
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:33,064
My theory is she really didn't want

328
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,999
to be in a relationship.

329
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,002
Her theory is different.

330
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,241
(window shutter scraping)

331
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,211
You'll get another girlfriend.

332
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,046
Matthew: I hope so.

333
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,184
She's an interesting person.

334
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,220
I think you and she would get along.

335
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:57,889
I never want to see her again.

336
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,658
I got tickets for
Yolanda and me to see

337
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,929
The Decemberists in
Prospect Park, 14th.

338
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,399
Tony and a girl he's
dating are going too.

339
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,469
- Do you wanna come?
- Yes.

340
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:18,909
(footsteps)

341
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,747
(stairs creaking)

342
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:53,844
(door shuts)

343
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:57,015
(light switch clicks)

344
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,687
(utensils rattle)

345
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,422
(chair slides across)

346
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,257
(utensils rattle)

347
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,027
(wrap crinkling)

348
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:13,832
(cover crunches)

349
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:19,605
(slicing)

350
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:27,112
(chewing)

351
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,934
(rattling)

352
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,502
(mumbles)

353
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,838
I don't think (mumbling) you don't?

354
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,742
- I haven't (mumbling).
- Okay.

355
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,413
(rattling)

356
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,682
(distant chatt)

357
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,952
(rattling)

358
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,622
(mumbles)

359
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:15,560
voiceover: I don't really know a
lot about where our money comes from.

360
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,728
Mama has a trust fund somewhere.

361
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,264
I used to think we lived on that

362
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,133
but then she told us once
that it wasn't a large income.

363
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,303
We don't live extravagantly
but we always seem

364
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,739
to have enough for our needs.

365
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,883
Hi.

366
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,019
voiceover: Hey, busy?

367
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,655
No, I'm on a break.

368
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,525
voiceover: What
are you doing tonight?

369
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:51,195
I'm helping Sarah, she wants
to record a song she wrote.

370
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,897
voiceover: What's your role?

371
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,132
I'm just pressing the record
button, stuff like that.

372
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,767
voiceover: Moral support?

373
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,936
Yeah, for sure.

374
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:00,471
voiceover: Want to meet
upstairs when you get back?

375
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,007
I want to talk about something.

376
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,576
Sure, is it something serious?

377
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,245
voiceover: No, it's no big deal.
I'll tell you about it later.

378
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,581
Okay, what are you doing?

379
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,350
voiceover: Finishing this
Muller book, it's awesome.

380
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,485
You have to read it when I'm done.

381
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,488
Oh great, hurry up and finish it.

382
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,392
- voiceover:  Okay, have a good time.
- Bye.

383
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:29,768
At night, the house is ours.

384
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,238
Mama goes to bed early.

385
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,674
Jeanne putters around in her room.

386
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:38,909
I really don't know
what she does in there

387
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,413
but it seems to keep her busy.

388
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,318
(door creaks)

389
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,157
Matthew: Hang on a second.

390
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,659
What?

391
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,463
With the cigarettes, I
wanted to talk about that.

392
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,432
(door shuts)

393
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,900
So listen.

394
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:05,603
I think we should stop smoking.

395
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:06,438
Really?

396
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,408
Matthew: What do you think?

397
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,410
I don't know.

398
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:15,414
I feel bad that I got you started.

399
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:21,018
That's probably not the
smartest thing in the world.

400
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,320
Matthew: Exactly.

401
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,823
Are you up for it?

402
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:27,959
Okay.

403
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,296
What about these?

404
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,432
I say we flush them.

405
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:37,636
Oh, we don't have to do that, do we?

406
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,942
Okay, maybe we should flush them.

407
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,480
(wrapper crinkling)

408
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,920
I never smoked again
after that night.

409
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,490
I'm sure Matthew hasn't either.

410
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,405
(makeup brush tapping)

411
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,106
(footsteps)

412
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,742
(rattling)

413
00:31:17,743 --> 00:31:20,145
(footsteps)

414
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:27,252
(birds chirping)

415
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,291
The summer is almost over.

416
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,294
I don't want it to go.

417
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,330
I wish I could stop it.

418
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,669
(cars whizzing)

419
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,576
(distant chattering)

420
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,245
(cars whizzing)

421
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,417
(distant chattering)

422
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,825
Pick one.

423
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,393
I can't pick just one.

424
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,828
Suppose you had to.

425
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,498
Suppose you were stranded
on a desert island.

426
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,767
- Don DeLillo.
- DeLillo?

427
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,670
Over Pynchon, over
David Foster Wallace?

428
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,472
You told me to pick
one, I like DeLillo.

429
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,541
I mean I like him
too but over Pynchon?

430
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:25,109
Pynchon is great, why are
you on my ass about this

431
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,478
when you put a gun to my head
and forced me to pick one?

432
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:31,048
Because you picked the wrong one.

433
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,719
Feel free to get in
here whenever you want.

434
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,721
I'm just listening to the boy talk.

435
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:39,491
Tony: What do
you think, Jess?

436
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,928
- (birds chirping)
- You guys are just going to have

437
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:44,394
to settle this by yourselves.

438
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:48,166
There is nothing to settle
here, it is so obvious.

439
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,721
Jess: Oh my god,
don't they look

440
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:14,224
just like boyfriend and girlfriend?

441
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,492
Tony: Hmm?

442
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,694
Jess: Don't you think
they look like boyfriend

443
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,963
and girlfriend more
than brother and sister?

444
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:21,800
Yeah, so what are we doing next?

445
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,810
(dog tags rattling)

446
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:47,224
(car honks in the distance)

447
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,794
This is such a perfect night.

448
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:53,632
This is what I wish life
could always be like.

449
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,904
I know it's just a fantasy
but it's very sweet.

450
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:03,140
Maybe it wouldn't be much
fun if it weren't a fantasy.

451
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,176
We'll never know, will we?

452
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:10,347
Since when did you get
so resigned to your fate?

453
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,517
What makes you say that?

454
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,922
All my life I've known
there's no solution.

455
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,425
I don't have any expectation
of us having a life together.

456
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,493
I never have.

457
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,835
I'm not talking about
the unmentionable act.

458
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:33,070
I don't think that's
such a big deal.

459
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,239
I think that's just a
matter of logistics.

460
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,708
For an unmentionable act,
it gets mentioned a lot.

461
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,545
Oh, do I make you uncomfortable?

462
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:43,248
Come on, you like it.

463
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:47,084
You'd be sad if I lost interest.

464
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,519
If the phase were over,
you'd feel abandoned.

465
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,922
No, I wouldn't.

466
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,408
It'd really be a win-win
situation for you, you know?

467
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,577
What would be?

468
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,749
What we're talking about,
what can't be mentioned.

469
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:22,619
You could just drop it and move onto

470
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,924
an adult, mature relationship
whenever you were ready

471
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:28,558
and I would totally accept it.

472
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,795
Yeah, I just see you
totally accepting that.

473
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:34,965
Really and sincerely, I wish
you would take me seriously.

474
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,467
I take you very
seriously, the only one who

475
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,639
doesn't take you seriously
is making a big mistake.

476
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,355
There's something I don't
ever remember hearing you talk

477
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:02,460
about in this fantasy, the
one with no expectations,

478
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,063
- are there children?
- No.

479
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,699
Okay, I'm not sure exactly
what your limits are.

480
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,802
- No.
- Okay.

481
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,384
- You certainly know how to kill the mood.
- Sorry.

482
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,824
voiceover: (mumbles)
were still living here.

483
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,292
voiceover: They've
been gone a long time.

484
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,895
voiceover: No, because I
remember listening to this song

485
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:40,865
(mumbles)

486
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:44,068
voiceover: When I imagine
Matthew leaving for college,

487
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:47,671
I always pictured a fall setting
with leaves on the ground

488
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:51,208
and everyone wearing
jackets but Princeton

489
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,212
had freshman orientation
before classes started

490
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,647
and he was gone by
the end of August,

491
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,751
when it was still summer.

492
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:08,994
(slapping and rubbing hands)

493
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,801
(rapid footsteps)

494
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,905
(door creaking)

495
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,844
(sandals slapping pavement)

496
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,614
(birds chirping)

497
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:44,294
The house isn't that much
quieter than it was before

498
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,298
but now the quiet moments are awful.

499
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:52,236
I feel as if I'm not
supposed to be here anymore

500
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,539
but I don't have anywhere else.

501
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,375
(birds chirping)

502
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:01,179
(cards shuffling)

503
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:24,001
I decided to go away at
the same time as Matthew

504
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:28,605
to visit my cousin Annie
and her husband Joe upstate

505
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,942
but it was a funny
time for a vacation.

506
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,311
Their kids were
going back to school.

507
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,346
They were busy.

508
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,683
I came home after a weekend.

509
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,629
(computer keys clicking)

510
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,664
We text all the time.

511
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,400
We call a lot.

512
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:58,402
Email, not so much.

513
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,838
It's kind of awful and
depressing somehow.

514
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,174
Facebook is fun sometimes.

515
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,410
Matthew still posts on some blogs

516
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,978
and sometimes I
spoof comments to see

517
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,414
if he can figure out that it's me,

518
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,849
kind of pathetic.

519
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,457
(static)

520
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,361
voiceover: It's actually
closed to the public

521
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,499
but a sophomore girl that
works at the library got me in.

522
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:37,909
Look at this stuff.

523
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,681
voiceover: Matthew sent me a video
letter his second week at school.

524
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,551
He shot it and edited it himself.

525
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:50,087
I think it's so great
that he did that,

526
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,657
so much work for just a letter.

527
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,466
Zoe, you're moving it.

528
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,168
I'm not moving it, I swear.

529
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:05,802
Well, I'm not moving it.

530
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,005
Could it be a ghost moving it?

531
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,940
Zoe: I swear it's moving.

532
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,575
voiceover: Oh, oh my god.

533
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,278
Have you ever hear
this word, paraphilia?

534
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:15,679
voiceover: Paraphilia?

535
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,913
Zoe: Megan, you
have to concentrate.

536
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,949
It means repeated
intense sexual arousal

537
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,019
to unconventional or
social deviant stimuli.

538
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,220
Megan: Sarah, I
thought you were studying

539
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,354
for a chemistry test.

540
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,423
No, this is on
George's Facebook page.

541
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,825
Megan: Why is George
posting about deviant stimuli?

542
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:30,294
Is he coming out or something?

543
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:33,663
No, his whole page is full
of stuff from psychology texts.

544
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,500
This is from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual

545
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:38,002
of Mental Disorders.

546
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,569
Zoe: I think he's just
trying to be perverted

547
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,105
and make it look like
it's an academic--

548
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:43,707
Here's another definition,
sexual arousal in response

549
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:46,743
to sexual objects or
situations that are not part

550
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,746
of society normative
arousal/activity pattern.

551
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,282
Zoe: Okay, let's get
back to the Ouija board.

552
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,218
It stopped talking to us when
you brought up paraphilia.

553
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,020
Sarah: They gave eight
categories of paraphilia,

554
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:59,289
exhibitionism,
fetishism, blah, blah.

555
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,725
Frotteurism, there's one
you don't hear every day,

556
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:05,329
touching or rubbing against
a nonconsensual person.

557
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,531
Megan: Does that mean
that frotteur is a word?

558
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,066
Sarah: Yeah, I think so.

559
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,300
Megan: It's be
a good one too.

560
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,535
Zoe: Maybe it's
a very proper ghost

561
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:12,836
from the olden days and
we're scaring it away

562
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,138
with this sex conversation.

563
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,106
Sarah: Then the ninth
category is called NOS,

564
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,109
not otherwise specified.

565
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:22,280
(birds chirping)

566
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,049
(clinking)

567
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:27,651
When Will went away to Cornell,

568
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,089
I fell into a terrible,
terrible sadness.

569
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:35,159
I knew, of course,
that I would miss him

570
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,663
very much but what I
felt was beyond that.

571
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,803
I hadn't realized how much
I'd come to depend on him.

572
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:52,177
For a woman who's alone, her
children become everything.

573
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,180
And the oldest one...

574
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,584
I know myself better now.

575
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:01,718
I wasn't taken by surprise

576
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,389
in the same way when Matthew left.

577
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,726
voiceover: I probably
should have talked more

578
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:14,431
after Matthew left, it made
Mama think I was depressed,

579
00:42:14,432 --> 00:42:18,735
or maybe I was really
depressed, I don't know.

580
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:20,304
I felt like I was
pretending to be depressed

581
00:42:20,305 --> 00:42:23,039
to avoid having to talk but
maybe I was really depressed

582
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,210
and just thought I was pretending.

583
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,046
Anyway, Mama, who means very well,

584
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:33,484
thought I should see a therapist.

585
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:40,525
Mama: Would you
like some coffee?

586
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:43,561
No.

587
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:48,832
There were also a few times
where she caught me crying.

588
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,569
I cried a lot after Matthew left.

589
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:54,404
It felt natural.

590
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,474
I felt better afterwards.

591
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,678
I don't think anything
was really wrong.

592
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,850
(coffee pouring)

593
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:17,394
So, anyway, that's
all there is to that.

594
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,762
therapist: Your sister
is still living at home,

595
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,530
though, Jeanne, is that right?

596
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:22,232
Yeah, Jeanne.

597
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,067
therapist: Do you
speak to her much?

598
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,570
Once in a while.

599
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,876
We don't have all
that much in common.

600
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,317
You seem like a nice
person but I'm feeling

601
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:42,752
a little uncomfortable.

602
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,188
therapist: Yes, I can tell.

603
00:43:44,189 --> 00:43:46,356
Completely terrified actually.

604
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:49,193
Can you talk about
what you're scared of?

605
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:53,364
girl: If I could do that,
I wouldn't be scared, right?

606
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:56,801
I'm sorry.

607
00:43:58,236 --> 00:44:00,036
I'm being rude.

608
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:01,738
You can be rude if you want to.

609
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,642
I'm really not used to
talking about private matters.

610
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,843
therapist: I
have the impression

611
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,646
- that you sometimes enjoy talking.
- Oh yeah.

612
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:13,217
therapist: In fact, you seem
unusually open about your feelings.

613
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:14,718
Yes, I have this bad habit
of embarrassing everyone

614
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,054
by just blurting things out.

615
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,725
But right now?

616
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:22,660
Yeah, I know you think that this

617
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,995
would be my big chance, right?

618
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:32,869
I'm actually really worried
that you're gonna tell

619
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,206
whatever I say to my mother.

620
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:38,107
Jackie, I always discuss
that issue with parents

621
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,810
before I begin therapy with a minor.

622
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,313
Your mother has agreed
that I will everything

623
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:45,415
you say in strict confidence.

624
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,217
There's only one
exception to that rule

625
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,685
and that's if you say something

626
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,120
that makes me think you're
likely to do harm to yourself.

627
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,357
I'm not gonna do harm to myself.

628
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:54,724
therapist: Then everything
you say will remain

629
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:55,793
in this room.

630
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:03,234
(cars honking in the distance)

631
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,769
Maybe you might
give my mother advice

632
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,237
about what I should do.

633
00:45:07,238 --> 00:45:09,739
Jackie, I will not give
your mother advice about you.

634
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,477
I will not tell her
what you say here, okay?

635
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:14,812
Jackie: Okay.

636
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:20,016
So, you're a private person.

637
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,253
Jackie: Yeah, sometimes.

638
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:26,155
Do you have any confidantes,
anyone you can talk to?

639
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,558
No, not really.

640
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,263
therapist: Do you keep
a diary or a notebook

641
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:34,698
where you can write
your thoughts down?

642
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:35,700
Oh my god.

643
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,908
No, I would never do such a thing.

644
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,043
therapist: You're afraid
your mother might read it.

645
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:51,215
No, my mother would never
do anything like that.

646
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,357
It's just the idea.

647
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,697
Jackie, I think it's
best if we stop for today.

648
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,966
I'm going to ask you to
go home and think about

649
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,068
what you want out of
this therapy, okay?

650
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,170
Okay, okay.

651
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:16,873
I'm going to keep your
appointment for next week

652
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,876
in my schedule and you or
your mother can give me call

653
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:23,047
and let me know what
you decide to do.

654
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,183
voiceover: I felt really
stupid for clamming up

655
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,253
like that, I told myself that
I would just talk honestly

656
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:33,557
to this woman at the next
session but when it came around,

657
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:36,160
I was terrified all over again.

658
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,722
(computer keys tapping)

659
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:15,032
Okay, I guess that's all for now.

660
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:16,967
Um.

661
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:19,969
Do you think it's weird
that we never say,

662
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,871
"I love you," to each other?

663
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,840
Something has to go here at the end.

664
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,074
Right?

665
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:28,345
So anyway, I love you.

666
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,314
Bye.

667
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:34,919
(computer key clicks)

668
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,766
Okay, I guess that's all for now.

669
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:52,368
I'll probably call you later on.

670
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:57,306
There's no need for a long
dramatic goodbye, right?

671
00:47:57,307 --> 00:47:59,209
I miss you so horribly.

672
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,814
Okay, well, good night.

673
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,190
It's really good, the
way you put it together

674
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,692
is really intelligent.

675
00:48:15,693 --> 00:48:17,393
I really like the way you
cut the rooms together.

676
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,895
Jackie: No, I hated that.

677
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,597
I couldn't get it right.

678
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,198
No, it had a good rhythm.

679
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,833
Maybe you should think
about filmmaking.

680
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:25,068
I think you have a talent for it.

681
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,103
Jackie: No, you're crazy.

682
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,105
I just gave up on it and hit upload.

683
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:32,710
Wait, I've got it
open in another window.

684
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,779
voiceover: Hello--

685
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,280
Oh my god.

686
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,615
voiceover: Let's see
what our house looks like.

687
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:40,650
- Matthew:  What?
- Stop it, stop it right now.

688
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,920
Matthew: So you
want me to stop it?

689
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,822
No, wait.

690
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,524
Put it back on.

691
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,760
Matthew: It's still on,
there's no sound in this part.

692
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,563
What's happening,
what's happening now?

693
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,399
Matthew: This is
the shot of Mama.

694
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,401
Oh my god.

695
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,805
voiceover: She's done
it, of course, she's done it

696
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:04,340
more than everyone in
the room put together.

697
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,109
voiceover: So how is it?

698
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,812
(giggles) I love sex.

699
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,179
voiceover: You won't
get anything out of her.

700
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,648
Yeah, but it's
different, she's in love.

701
00:49:11,649 --> 00:49:13,049
It's different when
you love the person.

702
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,719
Look, I'll admit, I haven't had sex.

703
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,920
(girls chuckle)

704
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:18,421
And I feel like I'm in the majority

705
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,857
but listening to everybody
talk about sex all the time,

706
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,726
you start to feel like
some kind of freak.

707
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,393
Why do you feel like a freak?

708
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,095
It's not some magic
key or something.

709
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,297
Even if you have it, you
still feel like other people

710
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,666
are having it more
or having it better.

711
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,367
Yeah, but you didn't even like it.

712
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:33,002
(girl laughing)

713
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,939
It was okay, it was
fine, I didn't dislike it.

714
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,742
Why should I feel
better if you had bad sex?

715
00:49:38,743 --> 00:49:40,644
If I'm like the only
person in the world

716
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,145
who hasn't had sex, I'm going--

717
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,147
voiceover: I thought you
said you were in the majority.

718
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,715
Of feeling that way, if I'm feeling

719
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,552
like I'm the only person in
the world who hasn't had sex,

720
00:49:48,553 --> 00:49:49,886
I'm not going to feel
any more nurtured

721
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:51,588
because you had bad sex.

722
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,590
Megan, you're being
a little hostile.

723
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:54,691
How am I being hostile?

724
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:56,192
I didn't say it was bad sex.

725
00:49:56,193 --> 00:49:57,027
Look, people aren't
going to tell you

726
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,595
about their sex lives.

727
00:49:58,596 --> 00:49:59,896
It doesn't mean you're
the only only one.

728
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:01,130
It just means people like to keep

729
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:02,465
their private lives private.

730
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,767
voiceover: Except for Megan.

731
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,234
(laughing) Yeah, except for you.

732
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,803
Did I start this conversation?

733
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:09,105
Did I start talking
about sex, I did not.

734
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,641
You know that I
haven't had sex either.

735
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:12,842
Megan: I know that but--

736
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,778
Yeah, but you don't count, Jackie,

737
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:14,745
because you're not even trying.

738
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,145
I'm not even trying?

739
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,748
You never even express
any interest in boys.

740
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,283
I can't tell whether you even care.

741
00:50:20,284 --> 00:50:22,418
I do care, I think
about it constantly.

742
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:24,754
Deep down, I'm a total slut.

743
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,089
voiceover: Well,
then go get some.

744
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,891
voiceover: Everyone's
a slut deep down.

745
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:31,227
Then why don't you ever
flirt or even talk about guys?

746
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,329
I don't know, I don't
know how to flirt.

747
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,564
I guess I'm shy.

748
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:36,199
voiceover: You
are so not shy.

749
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,701
Not with you.

750
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,168
voiceover: Just doesn't
want to talk about it.

751
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,670
I think about it constantly
too and it's frustrating

752
00:50:40,671 --> 00:50:43,372
because I know everything I'm
thinking is just a fantasy

753
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,242
that comes from songs and movies.

754
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,011
Maybe it has nothing
to do with reality.

755
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,478
Really?

756
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,247
Megan: I don't
know, I just wonder.

757
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:53,382
Mine feels real.

758
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,785
Megan: But you don't
really know though.

759
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,487
I have a really vivid image
of what it's like in my mind

760
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:01,224
with all the feelings and
emotions rolled up together.

761
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,727
voiceover: Sounds like you
have a lot of vivid images.

762
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:06,495
(laughing) I can totally see
Jackie being a late bloomer,

763
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:08,431
like in 10 years,
jetting around the world

764
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:11,000
having affairs with movie
stars, can't you picture it?

765
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,468
What about me?

766
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,203
Don't I get to jet around
the world with Jackie?

767
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,006
No, you get to go to college
and hook up with some guy

768
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,709
and immediately start
giving us all sex advice.

769
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,577
(girls giggle) You are so rude.

770
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,479
If I get a boyfriend in
college, I don't intend

771
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,348
to be hanging around
with your ass just so

772
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:26,950
I can give you sex advice.

773
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:27,785
- I'm okay.
- Megan:  I'm outta here.

774
00:51:27,786 --> 00:51:29,285
(giggling)

775
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:31,621
Jackie: It wasn't until
my third therapy session

776
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:34,557
that I made my
confession about Matthew

777
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,727
and Linda didn't call
the cops or anything.

778
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:40,797
In fact, she didn't
seem shocked at all.

779
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:43,132
I suppose she saw
the punchline coming.

780
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,233
voiceover: Well, if you're
going to go to the city,

781
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,736
there's no campus.

782
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:51,474
Linda: Are you attracted
to other boys besides Matthew?

783
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,910
No, not really.

784
00:51:54,745 --> 00:51:58,348
Linda: What do you
mean by "not really"?

785
00:51:59,817 --> 00:52:02,952
Well, sometimes I'll
feel attracted to somebody

786
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,655
if they have some good
quality that I like,

787
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:08,057
like if he's an independent thinker

788
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:12,229
or if he says something
really smart or really funny

789
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:18,067
but all that stuff doesn't
mean anything really.

790
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:20,036
Linda: It doesn't
mean anything?

791
00:52:20,037 --> 00:52:22,638
Well, who knows what
that person's really like?

792
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,007
There's no sense falling
in love with a guy

793
00:52:24,008 --> 00:52:26,375
just 'cause he can tell a good joke.

794
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,678
You're concerned you don't
know what they're really like.

795
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,014
Jackie: Sure.

796
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,483
A lot of people find
mystery attractive

797
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,888
but you seem to want
familiarity instead.

798
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:40,624
Yes, that's true.

799
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:43,659
I totally need to know everything

800
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,195
about a person before
I can get into them.

801
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:47,831
What does that mean?

802
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,900
Linda: I don't know,
what do you think it means?

803
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,169
I don't know.

804
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:02,645
Linda: Do you feel
afraid or nervous when

805
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:04,714
you don't know everything
about a person?

806
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,483
Not afraid exactly.

807
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,889
Linda: Does that person
seem dangerous or threatening?

808
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,061
I don't think so, I mean I
don't feel that consciously.

809
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:24,100
Mostly I'm just bored if I
don't know the other person.

810
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,302
Linda: Some people
project positive fantasies

811
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,371
onto an attractive stranger.

812
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:30,139
They imagine that the other person

813
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,075
has all the good qualities
that they're looking

814
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,143
for until proven otherwise.

815
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,945
Not me, I just assume
that everyone is messed up

816
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,882
until proven otherwise.

817
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,716
Linda: Maybe you
should become a therapist.

818
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,985
Really?

819
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:44,888
Well, messed up is not
the proper clinical term

820
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,390
but not projecting positive
fantasies onto people

821
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,061
is a quality that a
therapist needs to have.

822
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:55,464
So how does it work when you know

823
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:57,533
somebody really well,
when you can see

824
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,369
all their little quirks,
their imperfections--

825
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,338
Jackie: Sure.

826
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:02,671
Does that make it difficult

827
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,574
for you to be attracted to them?

828
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,177
Well, it depends on what
the imperfections are.

829
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:09,612
I don't need people to be perfect.

830
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,915
Everybody has their issues.

831
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:14,217
Linda: Do you see
Matthew's issues?

832
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:15,618
Well, of course.

833
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,621
Linda: What are they?

834
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:19,289
Well...

835
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:25,461
Matthew can be a little bit
arrogant, like deep down,

836
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:29,633
he thinks he knows everything
better than everyone.

837
00:54:32,736 --> 00:54:34,839
And he can be judgmental.

838
00:54:37,074 --> 00:54:39,508
He tries not to be like that though.

839
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:42,179
That's something good about him.

840
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:46,415
You can talk to him if
you're upset about something

841
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:49,854
he did and he'll hear
what you're saying.

842
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,700
No matter how much I think about it,

843
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:07,571
what it comes down to,

844
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,777
he's the best person I know.

845
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,814
He's the smartest and
the most sensitive

846
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:21,050
and the most interesting
and it's not because

847
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:25,222
he's my brother, it's because
he's the best person there is.

848
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,557
If he weren't around,
I wouldn't love anyone.

849
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,827
For me, he's irreplaceable.

850
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:38,034
Did you visit any museums?

851
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:41,370
(door creaks and slams)

852
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,540
(footsteps)

853
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,276
Mama: It's Will on the
phone, pick up in the kitchen.

854
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,978
- Tell him I said hi.
- (footsteps)

855
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:52,917
Mama: Jackie just came
home, she says hello.

856
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,021
voiceover: There are
two kinds of people here.

857
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,588
The first kind, which is my group,

858
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:01,524
pretends college is about
studying even though

859
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,526
they know it's really about topic A

860
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,031
and the second group
doesn't even pretend.

861
00:56:10,935 --> 00:56:13,970
This cluster is legendary to
the alleged coed skinny dipping

862
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:17,573
that allegedly happens at
the alleged swimming pool.

863
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,608
I suspect it was a
total myth at first

864
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:21,610
but by now a bunch of people
have probably tried it

865
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:25,382
just because the idea
was put in their heads.

866
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,685
Jackie: Ever
since Matthew left,

867
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:33,490
I've been waiting for the
news that he has a girlfriend.

868
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,192
Sometimes I wish that he
would stop dragging out

869
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:39,429
the suspense and just
get it over with.

870
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:45,969
Linda says that most people
are attracted to mystery

871
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,173
and that I'm attracted to
people I know really well.

872
00:56:50,174 --> 00:56:54,510
voiceover: Sounds like
she's got your number.

873
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:58,181
Are you attracted to mystery too?

874
00:56:58,182 --> 00:57:00,849
voiceover: In some ways.

875
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,685
Is that what you feel
about me, that you know me

876
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:05,289
too well to be attracted to me?

877
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:11,927
voiceover: It's
hard to say exactly.

878
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,363
I don't get it, what's
the big deal about mystery

879
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,365
because people aren't going
to stay mysterious forever

880
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:20,336
and then when the mystery wears
off, you're stuck with them.

881
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:21,804
voiceover: It appears
to be the way it works

882
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:24,440
if you look at married couples.

883
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,375
I think I've got a much
more practical system.

884
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,145
The mystery thing is bad evolution.

885
00:57:29,146 --> 00:57:31,680
voiceover: No, that's
wrong, evolution doesn't care

886
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,583
about the long run, it cares
about getting us reproduced.

887
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:38,421
After that, evolution
doesn't give a fuck.

888
00:57:38,422 --> 00:57:39,922
And by the way, it also
cares about getting

889
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,658
new different genes in the
pool so the more mysterious,

890
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:46,062
the better as far as
evolution is concerned.

891
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:47,731
Yes, you're right.

892
00:57:50,334 --> 00:57:51,600
Completely right as always.

893
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,637
I never thought of it that way.

894
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:55,972
You're so smart.

895
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:02,579
I'm an evolutionary
reject, I'm totally fucked.

896
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,717
Are you unhappy with the therapy?

897
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:10,054
No, it's okay.

898
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:14,123
I'm still not sure what
it's supposed to accomplish

899
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,292
but it's fine.

900
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,760
Linda: Are you
feeling any better

901
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:19,462
than you were when you started?

902
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:23,633
Maybe, I don't think I was
actually depressed or anything.

903
00:58:28,572 --> 00:58:30,306
This has nothing to do
with you, I love you.

904
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:32,541
I think you're completely wonderful

905
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,809
so I wish I could have
a good transference

906
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,511
and think about you all
the time instead of him

907
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,082
and then I'd just be a lesbian.

908
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,753
Did I just say that?

909
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,322
Yes, you did.

910
00:58:46,323 --> 00:58:47,790
Jackie: That's embarrassing.

911
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:51,694
Don't be embarrassed, you
can say whatever you want here.

912
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:55,031
Actually I think I'm 100% hetero.

913
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:03,173
I have had girl crushes
and stuff like that.

914
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,842
Supposed to just say whatever
comes into my head, right?

915
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:11,046
Linda: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

916
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:15,151
I have a friend named
Madeleine whom I totally adore.

917
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,352
Linda: What's Madeleine like?

918
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,987
She's really pretty, um,

919
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:21,624
and she's incredibly sweet,

920
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,927
like she hasn't got a
mean bone in her body.

921
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,863
She's nice to everyone.

922
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:30,933
(car honks in the distance.)

923
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:34,838
She has a boyfriend, I
don't see her that much.

924
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,941
Linda: Would you see
her more if you could?

925
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,045
Yeah, I would love to see her more.

926
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,682
Linda: Is your feeling
for Madeleine different

927
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,186
from your feeling for Matthew?

928
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:52,021
Uh.

929
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,291
Yeah.

930
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:58,761
Linda: How is it different?

931
00:59:58,762 --> 01:00:02,231
Totally different in every way.

932
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:06,402
Is it different in terms
of sexual attraction?

933
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:07,737
Jackie: Yeah.

934
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,140
So you're sexually
attracted to Matthew?

935
01:00:11,141 --> 01:00:12,741
(alarms in the distance)

936
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:14,910
Jackie: Yeah.

937
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,044
(sirens grow louder)

938
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,214
I wasn't completely clear on that.

939
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,083
You gave me the
impression earlier on
that it wasn't sexual.

940
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:25,155
Oh, I said all kinds of
dumb things earlier on.

941
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,963
Linda: You almost
never talk about Will.

942
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,499
- Is that his name?
- Jackie:  Yeah, Will.

943
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,666
Linda: Your oldest brother.

944
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,502
Will.

945
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,605
Linda: How do
you feel about him?

946
01:00:42,606 --> 01:00:44,540
He's pretty cool.

947
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:47,910
I like him basically,
he's a real alpha male,

948
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:52,081
very aggressive, Matthew has
a more balanced personality.

949
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:58,021
(car horns in the distance)

950
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,262
You're wondering if I'm
attracted to Will, I bet?

951
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:07,396
Linda: Are you?

952
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,232
No.

953
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:11,134
Not in the least.

954
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:19,275
Linda: So you've never
thought of him in that way.

955
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:20,609
He's totally not the kind of person

956
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,946
I would feel that way about.

957
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:26,783
The idea of it is just...

958
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,620
Is just what?

959
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:37,726
Jackie: Very unpleasant
and kind of disgusting.

960
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:40,729
In other words, it
would feel like incest?

961
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,567
(Jackie chuckles)

962
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,437
Oh my god, I'm so messed up.

963
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:52,708
(pen scratching)

964
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,277
voiceover: Listen
up, everyone, if you're

965
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:56,545
on the majorette squad and
you're going to the game

966
01:01:56,546 --> 01:02:00,182
in Port Jervis, the bus is
outside the main building.

967
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:03,520
Report to the front
desk for a hall pass.

968
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:06,790
Hey, hey.

969
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,225
Yeah?

970
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,226
You should try out.

971
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,496
Why, do you think I'd
be a good majorette?

972
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:17,032
(chuckles) No.

973
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,201
Then why did you say anything?

974
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,371
(boy chuckles)

975
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,172
What a loser.

976
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:27,744
The weird thing is
I think he's flirting.

977
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,915
(footsteps)

978
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:41,690
Jackie: I'm going
out with Sarah and Alex.

979
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,026
Oh, all right.

980
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,629
We're going to a party.

981
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:47,996
Mama: Really?

982
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,498
What's wrong with that?

983
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:53,670
Nothing, it's just you
don't often go to parties.

984
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:56,472
So I don't know what
time I'll be home.

985
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:59,274
That's fine, have a good time.

986
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,445
Okay, I'll see you later.

987
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:06,316
(rock music blaring)

988
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:32,509
(grunge rock music

989
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,447
- Really?
- boy holding cup: Yeah.

990
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,849
- Jackie: Hi.
- Hi.

991
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,785
Do you remember me?

992
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:43,620
Yeah.

993
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:46,321
We did that Catholic
work at the soup kitchen

994
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,290
last year for a charity drive.

995
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:50,659
Yeah, I totally remember you.

996
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,294
How's Debbie?

997
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,798
She's great, she's studying.

998
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,601
Who do you know here?

999
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,871
(kissing)

1000
01:04:26,496 --> 01:04:27,931
Would you mind?

1001
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:33,702
Okay, I'm totally
inexperienced at that
kind of thing but.

1002
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,870
That's cool.

1003
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,139
Just go for it.

1004
01:05:16,446 --> 01:05:17,280
(rustling)

1005
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:20,550
(Jackie clears throat)

1006
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:39,603
(rustling)

1007
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:43,740
(wrapper crinkling)

1008
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,234
voiceover: It wasn't
until the second I had sex

1009
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:16,405
that it occurred to me to
fantasize about Matthew.

1010
01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:45,735
(sighs)

1011
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,855
(footsteps)

1012
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:36,284
(computer keys clicking)

1013
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,987
After long and
serious consideration,

1014
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,589
I selected email,

1015
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,391
the most impersonal
form of communication.

1016
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:46,796
(computer keys clicking)

1017
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:10,787
(computer keys tapping)

1018
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,282
You seem so comfortable.

1019
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:44,286
I thought it might
weird you out a little.

1020
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,788
voiceover: Of
course it's weird

1021
01:08:45,789 --> 01:08:49,992
but our whole relationship
is weird in the first place.

1022
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:52,494
I wanted to weird you
out more than I did.

1023
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,097
voiceover: It did,
it weirded me out.

1024
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:59,268
It's an interesting weird,
it's got a certain fascination.

1025
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:04,340
Mm (neutral).

1026
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:09,577
I turned this conversation
over in my head for days.

1027
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:12,280
I put different
interpretations on it,

1028
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:14,784
looked it at from every angle.

1029
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:21,556
Linda: What were you feeling?

1030
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,993
I don't know, not too much.

1031
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:30,665
I was pretty cool headed
through the whole thing.

1032
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,135
Linda: Were there
any difficulties?

1033
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:35,103
No, it went fine.

1034
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,072
Were you lubricated?

1035
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:38,741
Jackie: Oh yeah,
I mean he went

1036
01:09:38,742 --> 01:09:42,245
in pretty easily after
the hymen incident.

1037
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,547
It sounds as if
you must have enjoyed

1038
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,649
yourself a little bit at least.

1039
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:48,718
Not really.

1040
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:52,387
Linda: If you
were lubricated,

1041
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:55,058
you must have had some reaction.

1042
01:09:56,726 --> 01:10:00,129
I was wet but I
wasn't really involved.

1043
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:03,299
I felt like a spectator.

1044
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:10,272
Trying to say that I
secretly enjoyed it?

1045
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:11,840
I'm not trying to say that.

1046
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:12,975
I'm saying that it sounds

1047
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:16,111
as if you were
physically responsive.

1048
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,780
Jackie: Yeah.

1049
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:18,614
I was...

1050
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,019
responsive enough for, you know,

1051
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,089
the minimum requirements.

1052
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,631
You don't like the
idea of being attracted

1053
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,735
to anyone other than
Matthew, do you?

1054
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:51,214
(sighs)

1055
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:58,720
I had a dream last
week where I saw a boy

1056
01:10:58,721 --> 01:11:02,390
who wasn't Matthew and
I felt attracted to him.

1057
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:06,261
Linda: What happened
after that in the dream?

1058
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,764
I can't remember it clearly.

1059
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:18,274
I never talked to the boy and
nothing happened between us.

1060
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:22,177
Linda: Who does the boy
in the dream remind you of?

1061
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:24,080
No one in particular.

1062
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:29,017
Linda: Can you describe him?

1063
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,254
Oh god, I can't remember.

1064
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:42,197
He was medium height and
he had long dark hair,

1065
01:11:42,198 --> 01:11:44,868
long for a boy, down to his chin

1066
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,937
and he had a round face.

1067
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,877
Linda: Did those features
remind you of anyone?

1068
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,379
No, not exactly.

1069
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,991
I guess I have a face like that.

1070
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,459
Linda: Yes, you do.

1071
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,461
You think that's me?

1072
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,197
What would that mean?

1073
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:17,499
Linda: I don't know,
what do you think it means?

1074
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,902
I have no idea.

1075
01:12:52,001 --> 01:12:55,070
He's a nasty little twerp, isn't he?

1076
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:56,804
You are so strong,
if that happened to me,

1077
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,107
I would crawl under a rock and die.

1078
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,543
Who gives fuck?

1079
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,585
Two days later, after school,
when no one was around,

1080
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,455
Tristan asked me to
go out with him again.

1081
01:13:13,456 --> 01:13:15,890
He said that he was probably
breaking up with Debbie

1082
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:17,459
because she didn't like his friends

1083
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:20,728
or he didn't like her
friends or something.

1084
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:24,900
He kept saying what a good
time he had on Saturday night.

1085
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:30,439
(computer keys clicking)

1086
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:39,214
Mama: Which one
are you doing first?

1087
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:40,216
Princeton.

1088
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,752
Jeanne: Did you even
need to ask that, Mama?

1089
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,422
Mama: Is that
your first choice?

1090
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:49,524
For now, I'm still doing research.

1091
01:13:49,525 --> 01:13:51,459
(computer keys clicking)

1092
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:52,961
Mama: That's nice,
dear, going away

1093
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:56,331
would be much easier for
you if Matthew is around.

1094
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:59,534
(computer keys clicking)

1095
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:02,304
I'm getting a lot of
resistance from you on this.

1096
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:03,406
Well, yeah.

1097
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:06,174
We're just talking about it.

1098
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,110
You know I'm not in any position

1099
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:08,610
to force you to do anything.

1100
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,912
That's right, you're not.

1101
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,315
I haven't even
expressed a preference.

1102
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:16,718
Yes, but I know what
you want me to do.

1103
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:18,853
Can we talk about
why the idea of going

1104
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,589
to a different school
bothers you so much?

1105
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,992
Go ahead, talk.

1106
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:32,201
(computer keys clicking)

1107
01:14:38,441 --> 01:14:41,110
(door creaking)

1108
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,281
(door shuts)

1109
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:47,116
Hey.

1110
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:47,950
Hi.

1111
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:50,218
(kissing)

1112
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,286
Give me a minute,
I have to go finish

1113
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:53,289
this for Miss Rodriguez.

1114
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:56,991
Phillip has his Mama's van to go

1115
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,626
to the Poconos this weekend.

1116
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,495
This weekend I can't.

1117
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,996
Why not?

1118
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:04,266
It's a vacation and my
brother's home from school

1119
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:07,435
and I have a lot of
stuff to do at home.

1120
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:10,738
So you're busy the whole vacation?

1121
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,607
I don't know, maybe not.

1122
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,442
(computer keys clicking)

1123
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:15,710
Okay.

1124
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:16,545
Whatever.

1125
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,015
Sorry, I just can't do it.

1126
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,221
I really have to finish this.

1127
01:15:26,222 --> 01:15:27,955
(computer keys clicking)

1128
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,192
All right, later.

1129
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,629
(computer keys clicking)

1130
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:38,067
(door creaks and shuts)

1131
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:42,437
Why wouldn't you come with me?

1132
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:44,739
Mama: I don't see any
need to stand waiting outside

1133
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,075
the subway station, you don't
even know when he's going to--

1134
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:50,044
He's on his way now, I'm going.

1135
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,215
Mama: You're making too big
a fuss over this, Jacqueline.

1136
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:55,650
I don't want to be the
only one meeting him.

1137
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:57,419
Come on, come with me.

1138
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,687
Mama: Why don't you want to
be the only one meeting him?

1139
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:00,923
I don't know.

1140
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:04,659
But it should be more of an event.

1141
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,060
Mama: I'm sure it'll
be quite a nice surprise

1142
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,062
with you just meeting him there.

1143
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,098
Don't take him out anywhere,
though, come straight home.

1144
01:16:10,099 --> 01:16:11,099
Oh my god.

1145
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,436
(footsteps)

1146
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:24,078
(birds chirping)

1147
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:26,649
(cars whir by)

1148
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,455
How long have you been waiting here?

1149
01:16:33,456 --> 01:16:35,523
Welcome home.

1150
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,459
This is a small token
of our appreciation

1151
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,026
that you've returned to us.

1152
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:41,596
Di Fara's, all right.

1153
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,930
Is Mama making dinner?

1154
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,267
Of course, but you
can go ahead and have-

1155
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:47,169
- I guess I can handle a slice.

1156
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,772
(cars whir by)

1157
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:54,910
(door creaks and shuts)

1158
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:59,914
Mama: It's so good
to see you, dear.

1159
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:00,716
Jeanne: Hey Matthew.

1160
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,585
Matthew: Hey Jeanne.

1161
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:06,421
Peter completely agreed with me

1162
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:08,590
but he knew I wanted a public room.

1163
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:09,957
He felt we were violating some

1164
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:12,394
unwritten law of roommate life.

1165
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:15,430
No, that's absurd,
you were in the right.

1166
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:16,898
(dishes rattle)

1167
01:17:16,899 --> 01:17:19,601
Matthew: I see his
point in theory but he had

1168
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,304
all these friends over
from Groton on weekends.

1169
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,472
Don't these Princeton
students ever study?

1170
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,673
Matthew: As far
as he's concerned,

1171
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,309
if you wanna to study,
go to the library.

1172
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:31,480
It's ridiculous but there's
no point in arguing with him.

1173
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,457
(door creaking)

1174
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,293
Last time we went out
it was right in the middle

1175
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:49,364
of my period and I figured
like whatever, go for it

1176
01:17:49,365 --> 01:17:51,199
but he was really nervous
and he wasn't sure whether

1177
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,402
he should do it and I was really
surprised 'cause I thought

1178
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,971
that guys these days were
cool with period blood.

1179
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,105
Matthew: Maybe he just
didn't want to bloody up

1180
01:17:58,106 --> 01:17:59,574
his mom's sheets.

1181
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:02,744
It was the back
seat of his mom's car.

1182
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:03,579
Maybe.

1183
01:18:05,414 --> 01:18:08,049
What about you, does
period blood bother you?

1184
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,751
Matthew: I've
never encountered it.

1185
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:10,952
Yes you have.

1186
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,854
I've never encountered
it in a sex context.

1187
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:16,591
I'm pretty sure I'd be okay with it.

1188
01:18:16,592 --> 01:18:18,726
Did this guy get his act together?

1189
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:22,064
Yeah, he was fine
once we got started.

1190
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:26,868
I find that I like sex actually.

1191
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,870
Matthew: That
doesn't surprise me.

1192
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,372
What do you mean?

1193
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:33,575
I've always thought of
you as a sexual person,

1194
01:18:33,576 --> 01:18:35,943
just little things I remember
from when we were kids.

1195
01:18:35,944 --> 01:18:37,945
Jackie: What do you remember?

1196
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:40,748
Nothing particular, I
remember you being all smiley

1197
01:18:40,749 --> 01:18:43,318
and happy whenever we
were up to something,

1198
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:45,152
if we were touching
ourselves or something

1199
01:18:45,153 --> 01:18:49,824
and me being more nervous
or guilty, of course.

1200
01:18:49,825 --> 01:18:51,893
You always seemed to
have your act together.

1201
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,262
Aw, that's too bad that didn't last.

1202
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,766
Matthew: Mm (neutral).

1203
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:03,170
Uh, the last time that
Tristan and I were together,

1204
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:06,040
he asked me to do
something special for him.

1205
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,742
Matthew: Like what?

1206
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:10,745
Well, he wanted me to
put my finger up his butt.

1207
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,515
Matthew: Oh, okay.

1208
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:19,053
I pretended I was grossed
out by it and I said no.

1209
01:19:19,054 --> 01:19:21,823
I could tell he really wanted
it but he dropped the subject

1210
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:23,458
and the thing is I wasn't
bothered by it at all.

1211
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:24,459
I just didn't feel like doing it

1212
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,728
for him right at that moment.

1213
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:29,764
I guess I was being a bitch.

1214
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,833
Matthew: Did you act
all indignant, like,

1215
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:34,436
"I beg your pardon, sir"?

1216
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,372
I think I said, "Ew."

1217
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:42,978
Maybe I'll change my mind
sometime and give him a thrill.

1218
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:45,980
Matthew: It
wouldn't bother you?

1219
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,149
Totally not.

1220
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:51,319
If I loved a boy, I would
do anything for him.

1221
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,522
I would never say no to anything.

1222
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:57,392
You're the last of the romantics.

1223
01:19:57,393 --> 01:19:59,562
Romantic with a capital R.

1224
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:11,906
That last comment was
directed at me I guess.

1225
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:12,975
I guess so.

1226
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,716
Be so great if you has some
horrible disgusting perversion

1227
01:20:21,717 --> 01:20:25,788
that no one else in the
world would ever gratify.

1228
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:31,025
You'd probably never
tell me, would you?

1229
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:32,293
You could at least
pretend you're not watching

1230
01:20:32,294 --> 01:20:34,363
my crotch for a reaction.

1231
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,005
Are you having a reaction?

1232
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:52,981
What's wrong?

1233
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:56,618
This was a mistake.

1234
01:20:56,619 --> 01:20:58,586
Matthew, wait, sit down.

1235
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,087
It's like you're
doing everything you can

1236
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,589
to make it impossible
for me to around you.

1237
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,124
Please don't be
angry with me, please.

1238
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,392
You have to know what you're doing.

1239
01:21:04,393 --> 01:21:05,860
You have to know how
hard you're pushing.

1240
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:09,163
I know, I know, I'm sorry,
I'm really sorry but everything

1241
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:12,500
is at stake, my whole life
is at stake right now.

1242
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:14,001
I'm going to bed.

1243
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:17,339
(door creaks and shuts)

1244
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,016
(heavy breathing)

1245
01:21:29,952 --> 01:21:31,218
Jackie: That was the
last sleepless night

1246
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:33,120
of my life so far.

1247
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:35,958
(heavy breathing)

1248
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,402
(footsteps)

1249
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,080
Hi.

1250
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,248
Hi.

1251
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:04,519
Can we go upstairs
and talk for a second?

1252
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,353
Sure.

1253
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,289
Jackie: Do you need
your coffee first?

1254
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:09,124
Yeah.

1255
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:20,035
(cup rattles)

1256
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,978
There's only one thing
I'm really afraid of

1257
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:34,649
and that's that you'll
withdraw from me emotionally.

1258
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,651
Maybe that's what has to happen

1259
01:22:36,652 --> 01:22:39,387
if we want to have a normal life.

1260
01:22:41,023 --> 01:22:43,991
You mean if I want
to have a normal life.

1261
01:22:43,992 --> 01:22:45,060
No, me too.

1262
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:49,498
Jackie: Really?

1263
01:22:50,866 --> 01:22:55,003
You're a very powerful person,
maybe you don't think so.

1264
01:22:56,572 --> 01:22:58,439
Jackie: I don't
feel powerful.

1265
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,510
But you are, I feel like
I'm caught in your force field

1266
01:23:02,511 --> 01:23:06,682
sometimes, I can't get
my balance (chuckles).

1267
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:12,387
What you're saying is
unbearably sad to me.

1268
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:23,831
I can deal with our being apart.

1269
01:23:23,832 --> 01:23:26,234
I think I can deal with that.

1270
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:32,306
I can deal with you having
other people in your life

1271
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:33,808
but what I can't deal
with is the thought

1272
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:37,211
that I won't be connected to you.

1273
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:40,147
Look at you, though,
you're crying all the time.

1274
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:43,350
You're crying now, is
that what you want?

1275
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,352
(chuckles) Crying
isn't such a bad thing.

1276
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:48,522
You don't understand that
'cause you never cry.

1277
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:52,059
If I cried too, this house
would be like washed away.

1278
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,297
You should try it
sometime, it helps.

1279
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:02,604
Besides, I'm saying
goodbye to something.

1280
01:24:02,605 --> 01:24:06,274
You're supposed to cry
when you say goodbye.

1281
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,578
Drama queen.

1282
01:24:12,981 --> 01:24:15,150
(sobbing)

1283
01:24:19,021 --> 01:24:21,189
(wailing)

1284
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,500
(door creaks)

1285
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:35,537
(sobbing)

1286
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,044
(door shuts)

1287
01:24:42,045 --> 01:24:43,410
What's going on?

1288
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,112
Just leave 'em alone.

1289
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:45,981
(sighs)

1290
01:24:45,982 --> 01:24:48,316
(footsteps)

1291
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,323
(stairs creaking)

1292
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:00,428
voiceover: I
managed pretty well

1293
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:02,463
for the rest of that vacation.

1294
01:25:02,464 --> 01:25:05,133
(water running)

1295
01:25:08,036 --> 01:25:09,771
I did have a little
breakdown when Matthew left

1296
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:12,606
for school but that
wasn't too awful.

1297
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,441
(distant chatting)

1298
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,377
I think he expected it.

1299
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,560
(birds chirping)

1300
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,368
(footsteps)

1301
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:48,475
It was the hardest decision

1302
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:51,245
I made in my entire
life but I never sent

1303
01:25:51,246 --> 01:25:53,849
in my application to Princeton.

1304
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:58,786
I can't describe how I felt
as the deadline approached.

1305
01:25:58,787 --> 01:26:00,688
I don't like to think about it.

1306
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:03,691
(car whirs)

1307
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:06,428
(birds chirping)

1308
01:26:09,732 --> 01:26:11,365
I was looking forward
to telling Linda

1309
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,868
about my decision
but, of course, she
turns it around on me

1310
01:26:13,869 --> 01:26:18,840
and says, "Did you think that
I wanted you to do that?"

1311
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:20,775
I don't know why she's
wasting her time on small fry

1312
01:26:20,776 --> 01:26:23,177
like me, she should be
psychoanalyzing people

1313
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,113
in Vienna or something.

1314
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:31,052
(car honks in the distance)

1315
01:26:31,053 --> 01:26:33,889
(car engine revs)

1316
01:26:39,061 --> 01:26:41,730
(cars whizzing)

1317
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:51,840
This house is my native country.

1318
01:26:53,275 --> 01:26:57,079
Soon I'll have to leave it
and go among foreigners.

1319
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:08,856
In the winter, I began dating
a nice boy named Robert

1320
01:27:08,857 --> 01:27:12,026
who goes to a different high school.

1321
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:14,962
We aren't going to the
same college in the fall

1322
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,298
and everyone seems to think
that romances don't last

1323
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:18,801
when that happens.

1324
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,904
(coffee pouring) I guess we'll see.

1325
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:25,239
Maybe I'll be the
exception to the rule,

1326
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,209
as I am to so many other rules.

1327
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:30,545
(footsteps)

1328
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:39,721
I feel so old lately,
so prematurely old.

1329
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,690
I'm not even 18 yet and
I'm already resigned

1330
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:47,061
to never being happy,
pretending from morning to night

1331
01:27:47,062 --> 01:27:51,465
that I want to same
things as everyone else.

1332
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:53,835
Linda says that I
shouldn't feel fatalistic,

1333
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:56,871
that my life will keep changing.

1334
01:27:56,872 --> 01:28:00,108
She's a smart lady,
I hope she's right.

1335
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:06,348
(birds chirping)

1336
01:28:10,052 --> 01:28:11,418
I'm thinking that I'd like

1337
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:14,155
to major in psychology at college.

1338
01:28:14,156 --> 01:28:16,490
I can't honestly say
that therapy's changed me

1339
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,692
in any big way but
that's one good thing

1340
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:21,062
that came out of it at least.

1341
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:23,097
Linda thinks that I'm
having a transference

1342
01:28:23,098 --> 01:28:25,099
but I'm really
interested in this stuff.

1343
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:28,102
(birds chirping)

1344
01:28:28,103 --> 01:28:29,871
You may be worried
about the possibility

1345
01:28:29,872 --> 01:28:31,138
of getting a therapist who's

1346
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:34,275
as twisted and abnormal as me,

1347
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:38,445
but, you know, I think that's
how it usually happens.

1348
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:40,247
First, you wonder how
your own head works

1349
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:44,218
and then you get interested
in other people's heads.

1350
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:46,989
(birds chirping)
