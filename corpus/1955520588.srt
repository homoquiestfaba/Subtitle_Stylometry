1
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,675
- Isn't that 10 minutes gone Tom?
- You'll lose your Job!

2
00:02:27,185 --> 00:02:30,336
Come on! Let's go!
Come on!

3
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,820
Running roll?

4
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:41,496
We are in side
one of the largest power plants, -

5
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:45,141
- Which supplies electricity to nearly
 22 million consumers.

6
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:50,897
It now seems that its going to be
one of the biggest disasters in decades.

7
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:56,735
For WTSE, this is Tom Merrick
reporting live -

8
00:02:56,945 --> 00:03:00,221
- from inside burning
Evanston Power Plant

9
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:03,457
- We need few more shots before we go.
- 10 minutes gone Tom!

10
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,325
- We must beat the Big Lead!
- We need to get out! Look at this place!

11
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:10,418
Go upstairs now,
or you'll lose your jobs!

12
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,741
Come on. Go!

13
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:08,421
Look! Devil babies and
resurrected dictators are out.

14
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:12,300
I'll tell you when I need. An alien
abduction or catastrophic disaster...

15
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:15,258
What's it's been? An year without
a decent earth quake or flood?

16
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:17,899
That's terrible....

17
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:21,899
I wasn't sure if you're gonna make it.
I'll take care of this later.

18
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,778
Oh! You are warm.
So you are alive.

19
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:33,022
- You looking well, Eleanor.
- You look like crap.

20
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:34,742
I was going poor-chic-style.

21
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,367
Always trying to stand
out from the crowd.

22
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,536
- Thank you for the job.
- No need to thank me...

23
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:42,031
I got an award-winning
news man witht

24
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:45,002
chiken-feet. Never could
understand why you quit.

25
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:48,939
- I was misunderstood.
- Yeah! Why you're a hero in my book.

26
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:51,181
The tape you pulled under
the power plant tops.

27
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:54,511
The fact that network used
it to grab ratings, and

28
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:57,723
still pursuaded you to
resign over it...hippocrates

29
00:04:57,905 --> 00:04:59,861
So where do you want me to start?

30
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,421
Basement, research.
I need a piece on disasters.

31
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,821
I take it that Mother Nature
will not cooperate, the next

32
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,040
best thing is to take my readers
a blast through the past:

33
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,375
"Disasters through history."

34
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:13,543
- Starting out slow ?
- You complaining already?

35
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:17,181
- I see no reason to wait.
- Good luck.

36
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:26,462
This is a recording!
Elizabeth Winterns is not in today.

37
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,576
I know you're there:

38
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:32,937
Okay, I'm here, but not for long.
I will try to get out early today.

39
00:05:33,145 --> 00:05:36,455
I say have a look... personally I
need some balance into my life.

40
00:05:36,665 --> 00:05:39,418
I need those coms for next week:

41
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,697
I'll do a complete search for it,
but it'll have to wait until tomorrow.

42
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,702
What? No! No! Wait! Don't hang up!

43
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:48,818
Excuse me... I'm Tom Merrick.

44
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,141
And I'm overjoyed.

45
00:05:57,585 --> 00:06:01,703
- So... what are you doing here?
- Grayson sent me.

46
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:04,544
No! I mean why National Inquisitor summing
here some kind of pants?

47
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:08,579
- You work here?

48
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:12,374
Yeah, but I'm not Tom Merrick.

49
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:16,294
I had a bad day
went into a few bad years.

50
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:19,039
Could you lend me
some research computer?

51
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:22,684
You know. I'll be back
tomorrow and then I'm all yours.

52
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:26,494
No! It can't wait.
First damn job is to impress the boss.

53
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:30,334
Okay! All those news articles are online.
The code word is Lizland.

54
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:34,424
- Use search engine and hard copies.
- What if I have questions?

55
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:42,773
For emergencies only...

56
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:46,743
Try to leave my desk
as you found it.

57
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,858
DISASTERS, 20th CENTURY

58
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:21,799
"What causes one disaster to
become part of our collective

59
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:24,242
consciousness, while
another fade into history?

60
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:27,098
Maybe some author our attention -

61
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:31,935
- because they remind us of the power
of Mother Nature over Man's technology.

62
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:34,261
Others because they shows us how-

63
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:39,095
- inheritantly flawed our most advanced
technology can be.

64
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,900
There're still others
because they reveal... "

65
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:45,975
Crap.

66
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,380
This is crap.

67
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,424
What the hell...

68
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,819
 Hello?

69
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:59,381
- It's Tom Merrick.
- I hope this's an emergency.

70
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:01,248
Could someone have
altered your data?

71
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:04,205
No way! I have double firewalled
and keep built case guessing!

72
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,549
What is it about, though?

73
00:09:05,574 --> 00:09:07,884
Mau! Where do you get
these pictures from?

74
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:10,567
All images are from our,
Smithsonian Institute

75
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,560
and the Library of
Congress archives

76
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:16,374
- There has to be a mistake.
- If there is it is not on my computer.

77
00:09:16,585 --> 00:09:20,419
 Can not it wait until tomorrow?
 I must...

78
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,425
Whatever it is Merrick, it
can wait until tomorrow.

79
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:30,685
Larry King and Heating Pad
waiting for me at home.

80
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:32,742
Just take a look.

81
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:40,983
Titanic, the Hindenburg fire,
Hurricane Hugo.

82
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:44,222
I hope for your sake you have
more than a history lesson here.

83
00:09:44,425 --> 00:09:46,700
Take a closer look.

84
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,619
Do you still want to catch Larry King?

85
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:59,414
- What is this?
- A guy shows at three disasters, a perhaps

86
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:01,639
across nearly a hundred
years without aging a day.

87
00:10:01,825 --> 00:10:04,489
Now, is it someone trying
a hoax on us, or is this

88
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:06,969
the most incredible DNA
fluke in human history.

89
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:11,502
- Or is he not human.
- Come on Eleaner. It's just us two here.

90
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:14,130
And we are showing our theories.
I don't know what

91
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,484
you found Merrik, but this
is absolutely amazing.

92
00:10:16,665 --> 00:10:20,294
Exactly what the Inquisitor needs.
We get to scoop the globe.

93
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:22,859
- I want 1000 words from you.
- I have no idea what this

94
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:25,319
is all about. We don't know
even the images are authentic.

95
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:27,614
That's why you are flying to D.C.
tonight.

96
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:30,728
Nine o'clock flight. The newspaper
credit card for the ticket.

97
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:32,816
No way. You have to send someone else.

98
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:36,222
We get originals from Smithsonian and
get friends to authenticate them.

99
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:40,054
I was looking for a nine to five job.
Remember? No competitions. No stress.

100
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,859
And make sure we will be running the story
day after tomorrow.

101
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:45,244
- If there's a story.
- If? Why the hell did you

102
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,446
come up here if you don't
think there's a story?

103
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:51,140
Come on Merrik! Admit.
You blood supply is full of adrenaline.

104
00:10:51,345 --> 00:10:53,336
You've never felt this
good in a long time.

105
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,442
There has to be a
reasonable explanation.

106
00:10:55,625 --> 00:11:00,380
Find! The way to fine it is to be on that
flight. You have 36 hours to get the story.

107
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:06,454
Order a ticket to mr. Merrick
to D.C. nine o'clock tonight. Coach.

108
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:57,783
- Hello?
- Kevin?

109
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:02,934
- Hey, buddy. It's me. Your Dad.
- I know.

110
00:12:03,145 --> 00:12:05,601
Listen Kev, I was
wondering...I got a new job.

111
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,924
I would really like if
you came to Chicago.

112
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:11,854
We could hang-out,
watch The Cubs lose...

113
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:18,975
- So. What do you think buddy?
- I do not know.

114
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:24,697
I gotta go. Steve's coming over.
We're going to play some Quake.

115
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:27,658
- I'll put mama.
- Kevin, wait, Kevin.

116
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:29,821
It's Dad.

117
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:37,055
Please call him more than
once every two months.

118
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:39,409
Tom! Bad things happen
to people all the time,

119
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,441
but they do not just
draw back and give up.

120
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,297
This time get yourself a life.

121
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:46,218
As life you and Steve given
Kevin in Atlantic City?

122
00:12:46,425 --> 00:12:49,660
I don't think you're in any position
to give an opinion about that.

123
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,682
Motel theme parks?
Okay it's Casinos.

124
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:55,380
- What is it going to do to our son?
- Stop it, Tom.

125
00:12:55,585 --> 00:12:59,339
You can not only tolerate the fact
that Steve being in Kevin's life.

126
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,742
You know, Steve does things with Kevin.

127
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:07,143
He got us tickets to the final of the
hockey championship at Cops Collosium.

128
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:10,928
Buying half ticket for a kid
doesn't make him father of the year.

129
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,363
No, it does not, Tom.

130
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:17,380
But when Steve do anything with Kevin,
he makes more of a father than you.

131
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:27,602
Are you a photographer?

132
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:30,248
Passengers! Please
fasten your seat belts.

133
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:33,258
No, reporter.

134
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,898
So, like a news paper?

135
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,903
Yeah, like.... news paper.

136
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:46,859
- Are you doing a story about that guy?
- Maybe.

137
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:50,773
Because if you are...

138
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:53,055
... he is right there.

139
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:13,140
- Tighten your seat belt.
- What? What is wrong?

140
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:16,143
We are now flying through
a major turbulence.

141
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:20,338
If you fasten the seat belt
you're going to be comfortable.

142
00:14:20,545 --> 00:14:22,900
It'll be quickly over and done with!
Thanks!

143
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:27,536
- Sir, please take your seat.
- Just a second.

Drop the gun.

Land it!

00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:52,936
We got a bigger problem.

170
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:59,538
He's not gonna hurt anybody. He just wants
us to land, that's right, isn't it?

171
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,535
The two nearest airports are
Grand Rapid and O'Hare. Your call.

172
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:08,863
- Which one is the closest?
- O'Hare may be five minutes.

173
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:10,737
Do it.

174
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:17,541
Going down to 10,000 feet,
heading 2-9-0 by 6-2-0.

175
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:20,020
- Wait!
- We will take it down, like you wanted.

176
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,262
You got no radar, no radio.

177
00:18:24,865 --> 00:18:28,699
- What would you do,if I weren't here?
- I don't understand.

178
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:33,456
If you didn't have a gun pointed at
your head, would you continue to D.C?

179
00:18:34,745 --> 00:18:36,463
No.

180
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:39,816
No, it is considered an emergency.
Code one emergency.

181
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:42,937
We'd land at the nearest strip.

182
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:46,774
- Which is....which is you're doing anyway!
- Yeah!

183
00:18:48,425 --> 00:18:52,054
- Bring her up.
- I thought you wanted us to land?

184
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,495
Bring her up now!

185
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,379
There!

186
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:27,135
Pull her up. Pull her up hard!

187
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:57,815
- We've lost hydraulics.
- Switch to manual. Both sides.

188
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,778
We're on manual. 7000 feet.

189
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:08,621
6700 feet.

190
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:12,500
- Damn it!
- 6400 feet. 27 seconds to impact.

191
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:15,663
- Come on! Come on!
- 6000 feet.

192
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:18,339
22 seconds to impact.
5700 feet.

193
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:20,900
Get her up, get her up.

194
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:29,935
- 5500 feet.
- I got her! I got her!

195
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,219
We're levelling at 5500 feet.

196
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,863
Are you alright?

197
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:52,102
Hadn't we taken her up,
we'd all be dead.

198
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,695
How did you know?

199
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:01,459
I won't be needing this any more.

200
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,816
They are waiting for you.

201
00:21:21,705 --> 00:21:24,299
There was no way that guy
wasn't on the plane.

202
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:29,295
I saw him, the little girl next to me
saw him, the flight-attendant saw him.

203
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,383
Let's not worry about
this alleged gentleman for a while...

204
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:34,860
... and concentrate on you.

205
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:38,694
You see Mr. Merrik, you had the gun.
You commandeered flight 222.

206
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:41,658
Now in my experience, hijackers
rarely work alone.

207
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:45,215
I am NOT a hijacker.
The plane was going down, and...

208
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:49,284
Why don't you tell us
who else was involved?

209
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,608
No one!

210
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:54,494
The last thing I wanted to do  was even
get on in that plane. Believe me!

211
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:58,380
Believe you?
Believe you?

212
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:03,136
Mister I believe in looking directly into
a man's eyes and seeing the truth.

213
00:22:03,345 --> 00:22:08,703
Right now as I look into yours
truth is nowhere inside.

214
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:17,737
Sorry.

215
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:20,937
Ask the pilot. He'll tell you!

216
00:22:21,145 --> 00:22:24,979
As we speak, the agents are interviewing
the all flight personnel and passengers, -

217
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,335
- And I have a forensic
crew sweeping the plane.

218
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:29,297
Good! Then you'll find this brochure.

219
00:22:29,505 --> 00:22:33,339
The itinerary you supposedly saw inspired
you to pull out your gun?

220
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:36,617
For the millionth time, it wasn't MY gun.
It was his.

221
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:39,375
The guy with the brochure,
the guy we couldn't fine

222
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,048
the guy that does't show up
on the flight manifest...

223
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:47,744
... He was not even on
the damn plane when it landed?

224
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,539
While you're sawing holes in my story -

225
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,135
- There's a guy out there
with a list of disasters.

226
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:05,094
The subway is next....
I think.

227
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:09,655
Something's going to happen to it.

228
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:12,299
So now you have designs on a subway?

229
00:23:21,505 --> 00:23:26,420
I need to use a phone.
I get a call, right?

230
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:31,816
Stanton, why don't you bring Mr.
Merrik, a phone?

231
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:08,340
Check with weapons department.
Check Merrick through national BCI.

232
00:24:08,545 --> 00:24:10,979
Stanton, what exactly is that thing?

233
00:24:11,185 --> 00:24:15,337
The digital recorder built
into my watch. I made it.

234
00:24:15,545 --> 00:24:17,934
You're sure that you
want field work son?

235
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:21,023
Perhaps you should've stayed in MIT.
Nothing wrong with being an engineer.

236
00:24:21,225 --> 00:24:23,375
I've always wanted to be in the Beurau.

237
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,774
I mean....I can switch to a corner...
I can be an agent and

238
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,841
still have time to fiddle
around with things like this.

239
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:30,778
- Mind if I get you a watch...
- Forget the watch.

240
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:34,136
Concentrate on this here. Remember?

241
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:39,304
Please, just find Grayson for me?
It's an emergency.

242
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:43,498
Wait, wait...
Transfer me to Research.

243
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,344
Sir! What Merrick did....
It doesn't make any sense.

244
00:24:47,545 --> 00:24:49,456
OK. Follow that line of thought...

245
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:51,621
Well.. the guy hijacks a
plane, doesn't ask for

246
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:53,682
any money, doesn't make
any demands whatsoever...

247
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:57,221
So? What does that tell you? Think.

248
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:03,900
Get a shrink down here.
To see if Mr. Merrick is always honest.

249
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:06,699
That's marvellous.
That's marvellous

250
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,298
- Research..
-  It's Tom Merrick! I need a favour!

251
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:16,017
You left my office in a
complete mess, you hung up

252
00:25:16,042 --> 00:25:18,603
on me the last time we
spoke, and now you want a...

253
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,901
I found something in your system.

254
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,177
Yeah! That's the point of using it...right?

255
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:28,173
I do not understand it all yet,
but it may be something big.

256
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:29,992
Oh!Please Merrik! This
isn't going to be one

257
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:31,481
of the stories of the
century's history?

258
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:34,020
Do you have any idea how many reportes
have dropped that stuff, in my life?

259
00:25:34,225 --> 00:25:37,774
Any of them come in the aeroplane, forces
it to land and get arrested by FBI?

260
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:40,579
Yeah, right! I'm getting out of here.

261
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:43,060
Wait, wait, wait!

262
00:25:43,225 --> 00:25:46,137
There is a file in your system.
Merrick doc.doc

263
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:48,461
I dropped three photos in to it.

264
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:50,386
I need you to make hard
copies of each of them

265
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:52,204
and and bring them down
to me at the FBI office.

266
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,457
I do not have time to be a delivery woman.

267
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:58,225
Look, Merrik! I would like to help, but...

268
00:25:58,425 --> 00:26:02,703
- Listen to me! You are a researcher! So
I hope that you're genetically curious!

269
00:26:02,905 --> 00:26:06,739
Pull the file. Have a look at it yourself.
You won't be disappointed.

270
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:10,733
Merrick doc.doc
I'm counting on you.

271
00:26:17,545 --> 00:26:20,059
Story of the century, my ass.

272
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:33,019
"Titanic", "Hindenburg"...

273
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,422
Wow...!

274
00:27:04,945 --> 00:27:08,142
- What does he want anyway?
- At the end of the day....

275
00:27:20,745 --> 00:27:22,815
What happened to Baker?

276
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,536
What's going on here?

277
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:37,976
Where are we going?

278
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,735
Who the hell are you guys?

279
00:27:56,785 --> 00:27:58,298
Not now.

280
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:27,659
Emergency Medical Team to 348 on the
double quick. Put security on alert.

281
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:30,823
Seal off the building.
Merrick has escaped.

282
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,978
Freeze! Drop the gun!

283
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,782
Drop it!

284
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,814
Drop it! Now!

285
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,581
Against the wall.

286
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,458
No !!

287
00:29:16,385 --> 00:29:18,421
Our orders was to stop him.

288
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:22,584
If we kill Merrick,
it violates the phenomenon on negative law!

289
00:29:34,265 --> 00:29:37,018
Get out of the way! Move!
Get out of the way!

290
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,301
- Let's go!
- What's that?

291
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:03,936
Freeze!

292
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:13,382
- Are you going to kill yourself?
- Come on. Let's go!

293
00:30:17,785 --> 00:30:20,174
- Come on! Let's go!
- He was going to shoot us!

294
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:31,456
Come! Further!

295
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,782
Surveillance displays Merrik's had
at least two assistants:

296
00:30:34,985 --> 00:30:40,139
A woman of 160cm tall, black hair.
Black jacket. And a man...

297
00:30:41,545 --> 00:30:43,376
Stay where you are!

298
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:49,617
Get down!

299
00:31:02,225 --> 00:31:03,658
What the hell was that?

300
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:08,336
It would be a Glock 17L with ballistic
modificatins for an M 136. Right ?

301
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:09,468
Certainly, unheard....

302
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:12,204
That's enough! We got two
males and two females with us-

303
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:15,422
-Running eastwards along
the Fedaral building.

304
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,981
They are armed and dangerous.
Move in! Move in!

305
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:30,455
Why are we runing?
Why am I runing?

306
00:31:40,385 --> 00:31:42,057
What's going on?

307
00:31:51,665 --> 00:31:52,530
What are you doing?

308
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:54,920
It's the siren. They're cops.
They are coming!

309
00:31:55,105 --> 00:31:57,383
If they are cops, they
will straight shoot us!

310
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:58,166
What??

311
00:32:24,345 --> 00:32:25,983
Here!

312
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:34,137
Attention Please!
The train leaves from track on level 1...

313
00:32:34,665 --> 00:32:37,463
What have you got me into?

314
00:32:43,025 --> 00:32:44,299
What...? Ah!...

315
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:19,219
The captain confirms
Merricks statement!

316
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:21,416
We shall contact Grifasi.

317
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:39,538
Where the hell are they?

318
00:33:39,745 --> 00:33:45,183
You guys spread out. Cover the exits. I
don't want any of them to get out of here.

319
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,558
Alright! Listen! If passengers
saw Merrick's guy on the

320
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:52,560
plane, we should be able to get
a sketch of him on the wire.

321
00:33:52,745 --> 00:33:56,579
Let's also get the sketches of the two
freed Merrick.

322
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,264
What's going on?

323
00:33:58,465 --> 00:34:01,014
- All I know for
sure is that the guy

324
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,722
on the photos was on my flight.
- What?

325
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:09,178
He was there. And he had
a brochure... of disasters.

326
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:11,535
And it doesn't make any sense.

327
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:16,660
No! The flight we were in was in the
brochure. My plane was gonna crash.

328
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:21,939
That's why you were arrested. You hijacked
plane all before crashing.

329
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:26,055
Great! So that it makes me
an accomplice to a hijacker.

330
00:34:26,265 --> 00:34:28,825
So! Who was the guy in the
plane with the brochure?

331
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,522
Merrick and him working
on the insides, the two

332
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,043
goons and woman running
with Merrik on the out.

333
00:34:34,225 --> 00:34:36,614
But now at least we got
positive ID on her.

334
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:42,024
The call we allowed Merrick to passed
through to... an Elizabeth Wintern.

335
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:46,059
She's a match with the
woman he just works with.

336
00:34:46,265 --> 00:34:51,293
So Merrik! Whatever all this is about...
What are we supposed to do about it?

337
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:56,462
The brochure he had was
about past disasters.

338
00:34:56,665 --> 00:35:00,340
There's one that hasn't happened yet.
A Subway wreck.

339
00:35:00,585 --> 00:35:03,657
Right here! On the green line
at noon today.

340
00:35:03,865 --> 00:35:06,009
- Wait a little....I
told the FBI, but they

341
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,519
wouldn't believe me.
- Well... I can imagine why..

342
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:11,138
Just one thing
that's little odd.

343
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:15,162
The captain on the flight
confirms what Merricks says.

344
00:35:15,345 --> 00:35:20,738
That Merrick prevented a mid-air collision?
So that he's not a hijacker.

345
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:23,898
Merrick pulled the gun.
He and the other guy

346
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:27,204
probably tried to hijack it...
but got cold feet.

347
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,998
And the story now...The
three big questions: How

348
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:32,529
did Merrick know to prevent
mid-air collision?

349
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:36,664
How did the guy with him get out of the
plane, and passed the security....and why?

350
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:41,143
Why is Merrik run away
from the people who freed him?

351
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:42,359
I do not know, sir.

352
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:45,157
I don't know either..we'll
damn well find out.

353
00:35:57,705 --> 00:36:00,458
Wait until we process the signal!

354
00:36:00,665 --> 00:36:02,064
What's wrong with it?

355
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,403
I don't know. He is in a
shielded containment-bunker.

356
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,248
Now we shouldn't have
affected communication.

357
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:10,384
Grifasi...if you can read me... have them
charge up this place. We need a reset.

358
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:15,659
We can't reset you! We have serious
problems here that takes time to address!

359
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:19,062
- What is he saying?
- This chaotic stuff is a major deviation!

360
00:36:19,265 --> 00:36:22,203
If that's not bad enough, I got
the time the police after me.

361
00:36:22,228 --> 00:36:23,885
Having trouble in getting him.

362
00:36:24,065 --> 00:36:27,694
Find the bastard and eleminate him!
If he keeps on saving more lives -

363
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:31,739
It will be a question why do you come back!

364
00:36:31,945 --> 00:36:33,264
Kiss my ass!

365
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:37,777
Stop, Cortez. We can not
afford any unspecified casualties.

366
00:36:37,985 --> 00:36:40,738
There won't be any unspecified ones.

367
00:36:45,385 --> 00:36:50,140
We have to stop it before something
happens. We have twenty minutes. Let's go!

368
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:52,753
Hold it for a sec! You even don't
know if something's gonna happen.

369
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:55,079
Or even if it did, how'd you know
which train is going to crash?

370
00:36:55,265 --> 00:36:57,221
No, I don't know.

371
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:01,941
But if we don't get every train on that
line stopped, one's gonna be history.

372
00:37:04,585 --> 00:37:06,257
It's clear.

373
00:37:22,065 --> 00:37:24,625
Away! Move away!

374
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,290
Find a security guard,
anyone and say that there

375
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:35,564
is a bomb and they need
to stop all trains.

376
00:37:35,745 --> 00:37:36,876
What're you gonna do?

377
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,808
I'm going to find a way
to kill the power and...

378
00:37:39,985 --> 00:37:41,976
And then what? What is it?

379
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:45,538
It's him! It is this train.

380
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:13,581
We got to get out of here. Come!

381
00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:26,137
- How many stations are on this line?
- There're six. The last is Hill Horn. Why?

382
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:30,861
This is Baker. I need security units
set up in Subway stops...

383
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:35,377
- between Union and Hill Horn immediately-
  Let's get some cars.

384
00:38:42,385 --> 00:38:44,615
Merrick, this train is not stopping.

385
00:38:56,305 --> 00:38:57,658
There he is...

386
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,699
- I do not know how you got
photos you found, but it's

387
00:39:23,724 --> 00:39:26,203
Thrill Seeker's fault. Not mine.
- Thrill Seekers?

388
00:39:26,385 --> 00:39:28,296
What's gonna happen to this train?

389
00:39:28,505 --> 00:39:30,849
I won't tell...that's
part of the agreement.

390
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:33,842
This is Murray Trevor requesting
an emergency reset now!

391
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:37,415
What are you doing? I need that to get off
the train and I need it to get home!

392
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,856
- How is this train gonna crash?
- Ok! The engine driver had a heart attack.

393
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:44,216
When he died he was holding
the deadman's switch.

394
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,201
So the train kept
on accelerating.

395
00:39:45,226 --> 00:39:46,599
After Clayton it couldn't hold
on to the tracks on the curve.

396
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,128
He speaks as if it
HAS already happened.

397
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,837
It did! About 70 years ago.
I'm a tourist.

398
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:56,143
The flight you were in was supposed to be
the worst mid-air collisionin US history.

399
00:39:56,345 --> 00:39:59,655
Because of you nothing! Zero perished!
I need to get a refund.

400
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,594
Insane. Let's stop the train.

401
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:04,838
No! You can't do that.
Just...Just give me that.

402
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:08,540
- Do you travel to disasters?
- Disasters, sporting events...

403
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:11,817
- It's only a few minutes left.
- Let's go!

404
00:40:12,025 --> 00:40:16,257
Wait...wait...It's against rules to
intervene. Please give me back my RTT!

405
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:23,337
Please!
You do not understand!

406
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:25,903
I need it!
Please

407
00:40:28,545 --> 00:40:31,298
Open up! Open up!
It's an emergency!

408
00:40:35,305 --> 00:40:36,738
Open up!

409
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:41,621
It is Whittier. Three stops to Clayton.
We have maybe two more minutes.

410
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,544
Open up!

411
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:56,658
Open up!

412
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:01,341
- He can't hear you. He is dead!
- The emergency brake.

413
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:06,424
Damn.

414
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:09,885
Maybe we can separate
this coach from the others.

415
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,687
No! We don't know
how to do that.

416
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:17,500
Everyone! This train's gonna crash!
Move into the rear coach now! Go!

417
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:20,299
Go! Go!

418
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:25,776
Please! Give me back my RTT!

419
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:29,134
Move! Move!

420
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:48,621
Down the rearmost coach!
Train's gonna crash!

421
00:41:51,185 --> 00:41:54,894
It is the last chance, come on!
I can't wait for you.

422
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:09,333
- What should we do?
- I do not know. Look around!

423
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:14,864
This is it.
One on each side. Both at same time.

424
00:42:38,385 --> 00:42:42,503
Come on, jump!
Come on! Jump!

425
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:54,102
What now?

426
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:44,853
Come on! Move back!
Train's gonna crash!

427
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:49,661
Move back, everybody. Keep moving.
Get on the floor now. Get down!

428
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:46,655
Hey! Thanks.

429
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,899
- Is this your place?
- My folks'. Dad's out.

430
00:45:57,065 --> 00:46:00,853
Dad always said
you can never have too many types of tools.

431
00:46:05,425 --> 00:46:07,336
Do you surely know what you're doing?

432
00:46:07,545 --> 00:46:13,302
Yeah! I once saw him use it when I was
around three. It looked so easy... kidding.

433
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:41,422
Hold the stretcher.

434
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:50,054
- Sure, we have a match.
- Get him out of here.

435
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:54,735
- Oh! Surprise me.
- We talked to the passengers.

436
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:57,982
Merrick and Wintern were on this train,
but they are not.

437
00:46:58,185 --> 00:47:01,097
- Any luck at Union?
- The other two also escaped as well.

438
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:04,297
Oh! Great! It's great!

439
00:47:04,505 --> 00:47:06,336
Okay, listen up folks!

440
00:47:08,505 --> 00:47:13,056
I wanna run search on Merrick, Wintern and
the two unidentified purverts.

441
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:16,263
Check all hospitals, motels, hotels
within 50 miles radius. You know the drill.

442
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:18,856
I wanna check anyone
driving, walking or

443
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:21,563
riding a horse. You know
what they look like.

444
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:24,578
Right now! Results!
Do it! Go!

445
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:33,102
I'm not getting a contact.

446
00:47:33,127 --> 00:47:36,724
You shouldn't have stopped me
from shooting him the first time...

447
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:40,420
- They were not our orders.
- That train would have gone down.

448
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:44,903
We were supposed to interrogate Merrick,
determine the point of deviation and reset.

449
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:48,614
We didn't interrogate him,
and thanks to you he's still walking.

450
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:54,183
Don't let this on me.
The man has figured out.

451
00:47:54,385 --> 00:47:55,864
He knows.

452
00:48:01,065 --> 00:48:03,043
... this kept the death
toll now standing at two.

453
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,321
....of course it could have
easily been in the hundreds.

454
00:48:05,505 --> 00:48:09,180
It is the first subway crash in the
city has eperienced in 20 years.

455
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,775
Transportation authorities now speculating
whether it is operator error or...

456
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:15,499
- Right from the dryer.
- Thanks.

457
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:20,421
I have trying to put the pieces together...

458
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:25,414
In the plane...
That brochure I saw...

459
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:28,423
In this Evanston Power Plant fire....

460
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:31,737
It stated that 12 people died.
There was only 11 dead.

461
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:34,254
Who is the 12th?

462
00:48:34,425 --> 00:48:36,700
- Me.
- What?

463
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:43,219
The tourist guy travels to disasters.
And Power Plant fire was one of his stops.

464
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:49,095
That's right.

465
00:48:50,545 --> 00:48:54,936
His coin was there.
The one he had on the train.

466
00:48:56,265 --> 00:48:59,143
He must have dropped it,
and when I saw it...

467
00:49:01,225 --> 00:49:06,379
I hesitated. I mean...long
enough to change things forever.

468
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:09,383
Because if I hadn't
stopped when I saw it...

469
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:12,780
... I would have been
killed along with my crew.

470
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:15,818
- You can't know that for sure.
- It makes sense.

471
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:20,940
I am alive because that tourist
from the future... dropped the coin.

472
00:49:21,145 --> 00:49:23,582
The two Freaks.... they
are from the future too.

473
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,845
They are to stop me
before I alter the past.

474
00:49:26,025 --> 00:49:29,335
This is nuts. Okay?
The guy from the train was nuts.

475
00:49:29,545 --> 00:49:31,693
But if some future
scientist were to develop

476
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,960
technology for people to
travel through time -

477
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:38,741
- Do you really think this is what they use
it for? To tourism? For entertainment?

478
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:41,754
If what you're saying is
true, they're not coming

479
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:44,362
back to see some TV image
gets blown to bits.

480
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:48,333
They are coming to see thousands of
real live people die....

481
00:49:48,545 --> 00:49:49,734
It's sick.

482
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:53,324
I don't see how it is any worse
than tuning into 6'O clock news...

483
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:58,095
Or reporting.

484
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:03,600
Hey! There's no comparrison
between you and them.

485
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,839
Isn't there?

486
00:50:06,065 --> 00:50:09,455
I've watched some of your news segments...
Occasionally...

487
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:13,585
Sometimes I got carried away.

488
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:17,778
Remember the time you drew
right up to that tornado?

489
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:24,060
That was quite a piece, wasn't it?

490
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:30,140
Thank you for purchasing
Thrill Seekers' ten pack!

491
00:50:30,345 --> 00:50:32,360
Your best value at temporal
travel entertainment!

492
00:50:32,385 --> 00:50:35,124
Your 10 pack covers some of most
famous disasters in the history...

493
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:38,183
- What did you do?
- I do not know.

494
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:40,660
Starting from April 14, 1912,
sinking of the "Titanic" -

495
00:50:40,865 --> 00:50:46,701
and the December 24, 1998 the catastrophic
fire at the Evanston Power Plant.

496
00:50:46,905 --> 00:50:48,896
And of course the big three.

497
00:50:49,105 --> 00:50:51,926
That's right. Those legendary
3 days in June when

498
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:54,601
you get back to back, to
back a plane crash, -

499
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:58,460
- A train wreck
  and the grand daddy of all disasters...

500
00:50:58,665 --> 00:51:03,534
The Copps Coliseum fire....
that killed more than 11,000 people...

501
00:51:03,745 --> 00:51:05,303
It's tomorrow!

502
00:51:05,505 --> 00:51:09,942
When you're ready to begin your first trip
just use remote temporal transmitter-

503
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:12,898
- with the built in isometric
frequency blocker -

504
00:51:13,105 --> 00:51:16,734
- that guarantees you from
the time police detection.

505
00:51:16,945 --> 00:51:20,301
Within seconds we rescue you to
the start of another adventure...

506
00:51:20,505 --> 00:51:23,542
- He's there. At Copps Coliseum.
- Who?

507
00:51:25,185 --> 00:51:26,823
My son.

508
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:35,134
- Hello?
- Kevin, I need to talk to your mother!

509
00:51:35,345 --> 00:51:37,537
She's not here.
Christie's here.

510
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:40,682
Okay! I need you to
listen very carefully.

511
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:42,158
I can't explain how I know this!

512
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,768
But tomorrow during the hockey
game, there's gonna be a fire .

513
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:47,190
You, your mother and
Steve cannot be there.

514
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:48,439
I don't understand!

515
00:51:48,625 --> 00:51:52,459
I'll explain later.
Just promise me you won't go to the game.

516
00:51:52,665 --> 00:51:53,663
No! I wanna go!

517
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:56,682
Kevin, this is one
time you gotta trust me.

518
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:59,140
Promise me you won't go!

519
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:03,782
Talk to me, Kevin.

520
00:52:03,985 --> 00:52:07,342
Mom said you might get jealous,
because I'm doing stuff with Steve.

521
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,242
No, it is not
that, believe me...

522
00:52:14,145 --> 00:52:16,454
I guess that he didn't believe you?

523
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:19,065
I have to get there. I'm
gotta stop them from going.

524
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,399
Okay! Maybe there's
something else we can try.

525
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:24,816
You suggested a bomb threat somewhere!
We can try that at Copps Coliseum.

526
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:27,459
No! There are situations
like that all the time.

527
00:52:27,665 --> 00:52:29,926
When the security sweeps
and when they don't

528
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:32,160
find anything, the game
goes on as planned.

529
00:52:32,345 --> 00:52:36,054
We can give the deivce you took from time
traveller. That will get their attention.

530
00:52:36,265 --> 00:52:38,309
Maybe! But by the time you
explain what the hell

531
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:40,168
it is, the Coliseum
will all be in history.

532
00:52:40,345 --> 00:52:42,620
No! This is an emergency! The FBI would
be able to move in pretty quickly.

533
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:47,262
No matter what FBI comes up with
those two people will destroy the arena.

534
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,933
They need those 11,000 people dead.

535
00:52:53,945 --> 00:52:55,822
Maybe we can slow them down.

536
00:53:01,425 --> 00:53:04,895
Wintern got parents in The Heights,
couple of friends in Eastburn...

537
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:07,824
... And one ex-boyfriend on the Gold Coast.

538
00:53:12,345 --> 00:53:13,983
Put him through.

539
00:53:14,185 --> 00:53:17,416
It is Patterson from the office.
It's Merrick.

540
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:19,422
Line 2.

541
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:28,739
I didn't cause the subway wreck.
I tried to stop it from crashing.

542
00:53:28,945 --> 00:53:31,095
Then why not turn yourself in?

543
00:53:31,345 --> 00:53:33,374
The man and woman who
grab me from your

544
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:35,681
office they tried to
stop me from saving it.

545
00:53:35,865 --> 00:53:39,983
Now they wanna take down Copps Coliseum
tomorrow during the hockey championship.

546
00:53:40,185 --> 00:53:41,777
You got to stop them.

547
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:44,317
I'll tell you what! Why
don't you come down here

548
00:53:44,342 --> 00:53:46,679
and work with me to identify
who these two are...

549
00:53:51,225 --> 00:53:54,376
Thank you. We got it.
It's her parents' place.

550
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:56,206
The sketches I ordered
of those two that helped

551
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:57,885
Merrick to escape, I want
them to be delivered -

552
00:53:58,065 --> 00:54:02,422
- along with the photos of Merrick and
Wintern to the Copps Coliseum security.

553
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:06,334
Tell them to get extra police
and fire managers, just a precaution.

554
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:09,582
Do you believe it that those two
are looking for Copps?

555
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:13,300
I do not believe a damn thing he says.
But I do believe in covering all the bases.

556
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:15,254
Should I call off
the search Sir?

557
00:54:15,279 --> 00:54:18,159
I don't know. Maybe he's
just trying to put us off.

558
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:25,058
Oh! You gotta be kidding?
I should be there in three hours if I fly.

559
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:29,577
You are suspected hijacker. If you go near
an airport, cops will be all over you.

560
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:33,858
Don't worry. It is old,
But it can get us there.

561
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:37,580
If we take turns at driving
even if we stay away major highways -

562
00:54:37,785 --> 00:54:41,460
- We'll get to Copps Coliseum in 15 hours.
Well before the game.

563
00:54:41,665 --> 00:54:44,161
I already emailed my mom.
I told her that we're

564
00:54:44,186 --> 00:54:46,888
taking the car. So...well...
Let's get out of here!

565
00:54:57,705 --> 00:55:01,414
- Finally getting him.
- How could you let this happen?

566
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:04,458
What the hell is going on?

567
00:55:04,665 --> 00:55:07,259
- Grafasi looks different.
- Looks like there's some leakage...

568
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:10,370
Do you have any idea what you've done?
By not stopping

569
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,564
Merrick, nearly 500 people
lived, who were supposed to die.

570
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:16,467
So? Time-shift police again zeored
on your organisation again?

571
00:55:16,492 --> 00:55:18,047
Just give up the
hatch money and...

572
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:20,864
Do you think that we're dealing
with some law enforcement issue

573
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:21,878
What else is there?

574
00:55:22,025 --> 00:55:26,303
Just a few little problems like population
shifts in the hundreds of millions, -

575
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:29,046
plus new governments and
technology popping up

576
00:55:29,071 --> 00:55:31,557
and disappearing, you've
never even heard of.

577
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,862
- What happening in L.A.?
- Who cares about L.A.?

578
00:55:35,025 --> 00:55:37,175
My kid lives in L.A.

579
00:55:37,385 --> 00:55:43,062
Southern California was wiped out
in a fusion melt down 22 years ago.

580
00:55:43,265 --> 00:55:45,017
What?

581
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:49,581
I have to get back to my time.
You have to get us a reset now!

582
00:55:49,785 --> 00:55:55,223
You still don't get it! Do you?
Your timeline does not exist any more.

583
00:55:55,425 --> 00:55:58,497
Do you understand?
Your family, your friends are all gone.

584
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:01,208
And temporal accelerator...
that's right...

585
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,849
The core technology of
Stanza-displacement...

586
00:56:04,025 --> 00:56:07,654
Somebody Merrick saved one on that plane
killed its inventor -

587
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:11,494
In an automobile accident
three years before he invented it.

588
00:56:11,705 --> 00:56:15,698
So right now we can't
reset anybody anywhere.

589
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,517
But Sir you're in a containment bunker.
So the accelerator

590
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,844
should be shileded against
any timeline deviations.

591
00:56:21,025 --> 00:56:23,276
We never had deviations
of this magnitude before.

592
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:25,281
It's blown all over
like fish out of water.

593
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,581
Have we got a team working on it?

594
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,970
A team? Get the whole
dame conglomorate on

595
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:32,280
this. I have to get a
reset and save my son.

596
00:56:32,465 --> 00:56:36,458
Listen Cortez! I have bigger problems
here than worrying about your progedy!

597
00:56:36,665 --> 00:56:38,993
If we are lucky, I
repeat if we are lucky,

598
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:41,399
we might have a working
model within a week.

599
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:42,777
Then you can reset us?

600
00:56:42,802 --> 00:56:45,727
We can stop Merrik before
he gets on that plane.

601
00:56:45,905 --> 00:56:50,820
That's the plan. But nothing's gonna happen
unless we get a stable temporal zone.

602
00:56:51,025 --> 00:56:53,898
That means that you two
have to make it damn sure

603
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:56,681
that Merrick doesn't cause
any more deviations-

604
00:56:56,865 --> 00:57:00,619
- from the current timeline,
  or it's over for all of us.

605
00:57:00,825 --> 00:57:02,258
How do we find Merrik now?

606
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:06,014
He's got client's RTT. He doesn't know
that it gives us the track of him.

607
00:57:06,225 --> 00:57:11,743
- I transmit his coordinates.Standby.
- Standby for downstream...download?

608
00:57:11,945 --> 00:57:13,537
- We have them.
- Good.

609
00:57:13,745 --> 00:57:18,535
Now... whether you get Merrick or not
we need to get some insurance.

610
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:20,064
Insurancce?

611
00:57:20,265 --> 00:57:24,861
The last of the big three disasters...
The fire at Copps Coliseum....

612
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:29,024
No matter what Merrick does...
make sure it comes down....

613
00:57:29,225 --> 00:57:32,137
- You gotta be kidding?
- Fire or no fire...

614
00:57:32,345 --> 00:57:38,215
- 11,369 people need to die!
  It's our only chance.

615
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:41,861
Sir, with all due respect, I am a
temporal security agent, not a murderer.

616
00:57:42,065 --> 00:57:43,896
Consider it done!

617
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:45,097
Hey! Wait a minute.

618
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:47,678
Lets pull this up,
Sabbar or I'll kill you.

619
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:52,454
- I'm the least of your worries, Cortez.
- What the hell are you talking about?

620
00:57:52,665 --> 00:57:55,941
You saw Grifasi.
We got a temporal containment leak.

621
00:57:56,145 --> 00:58:00,184
Few more deviations,
Grifasi and the whole organisation...

622
00:58:00,385 --> 00:58:02,660
... will not know even we exist.

623
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:23,701
Merrick, if this is all true...

624
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:27,022
... may be we shouldn't interfere.

625
00:58:27,225 --> 00:58:30,900
- Then 11,000 people will die.
- I know, I know!

626
00:58:31,105 --> 00:58:34,336
But it's just that, the guy from the
photos, warned us about interfering.

627
00:58:34,545 --> 00:58:39,744
The two who are after are gonna kill
or risk being killed to stop us.

628
00:58:39,945 --> 00:58:43,335
What if somebody we save
goes on to cause something so terrible-

629
00:58:43,545 --> 00:58:47,060
- to happen which is much worse than
 Copps Coliseum coming down.

630
00:58:47,265 --> 00:58:50,575
I don't see it that way.
If those three people are from the future -

631
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:54,573
- Then yes! Their past is set.
that's gone down on one way.

632
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,458
But our future
can go on infinite number of ways.

633
00:58:57,705 --> 00:59:02,017
Any one of which may be a whole lot better
than the world they are from.

634
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:03,943
Or a whole lot worse.

635
00:59:04,145 --> 00:59:07,455
You're right. But all what we can
do is act on what we do know.

636
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:12,614
And knowing that 11,000 people
are going to die, including my son, -

637
00:59:12,825 --> 00:59:16,101
- I'm ready to do whatever
I can do to save them.

638
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:40,261
With this speed we should be able
intercept Merrick in about five minutes.

639
00:59:46,025 --> 00:59:48,181
Round up this area for
any neighbors who may

640
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:50,361
have seen traffic coming
in and out of here.

641
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,264
Look for some security cameras, whatever.

642
00:59:55,465 --> 01:00:00,016
Sir, I found this and an e-mail.
She had attempted to trash the mail.

643
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:02,898
- I just ran a digital decompiler...
- Just get to the point.

644
01:00:03,105 --> 01:00:06,398
She borrowed her mother's car.
They're heading to the Copps Coliseum.

645
01:00:06,423 --> 01:00:07,520
Damn!

646
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:11,742
This is Baker.
We're doubly heading for Copps.

647
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:15,500
That's right! Cancel the local search.
Put everything there. Let's go!

648
01:00:32,145 --> 01:00:34,454
Merrick, can I ask you a question now?

649
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:36,860
Only if you keep calling me Tom.

650
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:43,664
Ah! I got this feeling earlier as if you
and your son aren't that close.

651
01:00:44,865 --> 01:00:47,140
I was just wondering what reall happened?

652
01:00:47,345 --> 01:00:53,181
After the plant fire, I.... shut down...
from work, the world, everyone...

653
01:00:54,465 --> 01:00:59,493
You can't just drop out of a kid's life,
and expect walk back when you're ready.

654
01:01:02,945 --> 01:01:05,220
You must really miss him.

655
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:10,382
Do you miss his mom, too?

656
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:13,321
From day one I married
I lost out to my job,

657
01:01:13,346 --> 01:01:16,081
till the jolt I got from
covering disasters.

658
01:01:16,265 --> 01:01:18,540
Were you that turned on?

659
01:01:18,745 --> 01:01:21,623
Until I got those men killed.

660
01:01:21,825 --> 01:01:25,454
That was when I crawled into my cave
and disappeared.

661
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:30,455
Now that you're out of hybernation,
what do you think?

662
01:01:31,745 --> 01:01:34,464
I like some parts of it.

663
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:40,659
Maybe we should stop for gas.

664
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:57,376
He stopped. Just ahead.

665
01:01:57,585 --> 01:01:59,860
Time to put him out of our misery.

666
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:06,819
- Fill her up. - Check the oil and tires?
- That would be great.

667
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:14,337
I'll handle this.

668
01:03:07,665 --> 01:03:10,463
- Son of a bi....
- Why are you trying to kill me?

669
01:03:10,665 --> 01:03:13,338
Did you ever stop to think about the
consequences of what you're doing?

670
01:03:13,545 --> 01:03:17,982
May be my son is dead, because you
decided to stop the plane from crashing.

671
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:13,977
Oh my god!

672
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,176
Come and help me!

673
01:04:51,865 --> 01:04:55,016
- How long till we're there?
- I don't know.

674
01:04:55,225 --> 01:04:57,295
I said how long?

675
01:04:58,625 --> 01:05:00,138
May be 50 minutes.

676
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:18,576
It's okay, it's okay. Stay there.
Just stay there.

677
01:05:22,465 --> 01:05:25,821
It's alright. The ambulance is here.
It's alright.

678
01:05:28,145 --> 01:05:30,454
No! Elizabeth!

679
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:32,815
There's nothing you can do for her.

680
01:05:40,905 --> 01:05:43,783
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

681
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:45,782
That's my truck!

682
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:28,336
Officer! Park it for me. Will you?

683
01:06:29,425 --> 01:06:33,418
Looks like local boys took our warning
hard. What are you doing now?

684
01:06:33,625 --> 01:06:38,983
Setting for local time. Working on creating
one with few more changes, resets...

685
01:06:39,185 --> 01:06:44,418
- Resets to whatever time zone you're in.
- I eagerly await. I eagerly await.

686
01:06:47,745 --> 01:06:50,418
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a full house!

687
01:06:50,625 --> 01:06:55,574
16347 spectators to watch the game.

688
01:06:55,785 --> 01:06:58,060
Good day, I'm Baker.

689
01:06:58,225 --> 01:07:03,174
I don't know if it really going to happen,
but for safety's sake...

690
01:07:10,425 --> 01:07:12,734
- Ladies and gentlemen!
- Awsome!

691
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:18,065
Welcome to Copps Coliseum!
Here is tonight's schedule.

692
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:53,102
We got fire! Fire!

693
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:14,464
Cortez, Merrick's dead.

694
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:17,164
The fire which is supposed
to bring this place down

695
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:19,638
will still work, so we don't
need to kill anybody.

696
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:26,260
Listen to me! It is one thing is to defend
an existing timeline.

697
01:08:26,465 --> 01:08:31,300
An other thing entirely,
to purposedly invoke a disaster.

698
01:08:31,505 --> 01:08:33,445
Have you listened to a word I've said?
Do you feel

699
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:35,408
any responsibility? What
kind of a person are you?

700
01:08:35,585 --> 01:08:40,340
Kind that'll do anything, anything,
to stabilize this timeline, -

701
01:08:40,545 --> 01:08:44,982
- long enough to get a reset
and save my son. You understand?

702
01:08:45,185 --> 01:08:48,054
You don't give a damn
about any of them. Do you?

703
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:51,239
To the extent that they
don't screw our timeline.

704
01:08:51,465 --> 01:08:54,377
- Yeah! They're people.
- They are dust!

705
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:59,382
If you're so worried about them,
why the hell are you here?

706
01:08:59,585 --> 01:09:03,180
Do you think I wanna be doing this? Working
for some two big underground firms...

707
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:07,264
- that uses the greatest technology
ever invented for amusement rights?

708
01:09:07,465 --> 01:09:11,583
- I was a genesist oncee.
- You are right.

709
01:09:11,785 --> 01:09:15,175
I was with the government
temporal development programme, Cortez.

710
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:19,139
Oh! Lemme guess! When they shut it down
and illegalised time treavelling...

711
01:09:19,345 --> 01:09:21,063
- You were already hooked.

712
01:09:21,265 --> 01:09:24,302
I'm trying to figure.
Who is low on your moral scale..

713
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:30,614
Me, who does it for money,
or you, who does it for twist?

714
01:11:03,065 --> 01:11:07,138
The tragedy struck when a series of
explosions devastated the arena -

715
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:12,339
- killing nearly two thirds
  of the 16,000 spectators.

716
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,220
Lord, have mercy on this soul.

717
01:12:41,345 --> 01:12:44,417
This is Tom Merrick!
Leave a message at the tone!

718
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:49,614
Merrik, it is Eleanor! You're not handling
hijacking charges for the public defender.

719
01:12:49,825 --> 01:12:53,340
There's an old buddy of mine, Irwin
Thompson who is now a Defense attorney , -

720
01:12:53,545 --> 01:12:57,538
- he's agreed to represent you during
Tuesday calling. You'll get the details.

721
01:13:22,785 --> 01:13:27,176
Good job with the Copps Coliseum!
The stable temporal zone you created works!

722
01:13:27,385 --> 01:13:29,979
We'll be ready in a few
minutes to reset you.

723
01:13:30,185 --> 01:13:33,894
Permanent insertion point 24 hours prior to
Merrick getting on that flight.

724
01:13:34,105 --> 01:13:36,221
That'll give us plenty of time to stop him.

725
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:38,774
Just name any of these
disasters, and you'll

726
01:13:38,799 --> 01:13:40,886
instantly be transported
back in time -

727
01:13:41,065 --> 01:13:45,695
- exactly three hours prior
  to the disaster you select.

728
01:13:45,945 --> 01:13:49,779
One more thing!
Stanza-displacer is still unstable.

729
01:13:49,985 --> 01:13:53,182
And each test run is causing
more for burn out. Bottom line....

730
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:56,183
You only have one round trip ticket.

731
01:13:56,385 --> 01:14:00,617
Back to stop Merrick from getting on
that plane and redirect our timeline -

732
01:14:00,825 --> 01:14:03,578
- and then back here, to home.

733
01:14:04,705 --> 01:14:07,936
We are online now! Good luck!

734
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,661
Copps Coliseum fire.

735
01:14:13,345 --> 01:14:16,417
Now that you have come out of hibernation,
what do you think?

736
01:14:26,025 --> 01:14:29,415
- What the hell?
- This is all wrong.

737
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:31,138
You're alive!

738
01:14:31,345 --> 01:14:34,701
Yes! Last time I checked.
What is wrong with you?

739
01:14:35,705 --> 01:14:37,138
Nothing.

740
01:14:37,345 --> 01:14:39,947
We are back at Copps Coliseum
three hours earlier.

741
01:14:39,972 --> 01:14:42,318
Somebody must have entered
an alternate date.

742
01:14:42,465 --> 01:14:45,218
- What the hell are you doing ?!
- Connecting with Grifasi.

743
01:14:45,425 --> 01:14:49,054
He already said
he has no more resets on this timeline!

744
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:50,937
We have no choice.

745
01:14:51,145 --> 01:14:55,536
We have to take Merrick
and Copps Coliseum down again.

746
01:14:55,745 --> 01:14:59,738
And then wait a week
for Grifasi can create a new reset.

747
01:15:03,425 --> 01:15:09,102
- Maybe we should stop for gas.
- No! We definitely don't wanna do that.

748
01:15:09,305 --> 01:15:11,410
You're not one of those
guys who refuse to

749
01:15:11,435 --> 01:15:13,686
pull over till the car
tries to run on steam?

750
01:15:13,865 --> 01:15:17,983
In this case, yeah.
We get some near the Coliseum.

751
01:15:20,185 --> 01:15:20,964
What are you doing?

752
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:23,326
Those guys who were after
us from the train station..

753
01:15:23,505 --> 01:15:26,258
Let's just say I have a
very important hunch -

754
01:15:26,465 --> 01:15:29,184
- That this leads them straight to us.

755
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:45,097
This time we'll get of him
out of our misery for good.

756
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:54,536
Where the hell is Merrick?

757
01:16:06,025 --> 01:16:08,823
Hey! Did you have a 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass
here filling up in last few minutes ?

758
01:16:09,025 --> 01:16:12,813
An Oldsmobile Cutlass? No.
You want me to check the oil and tires?

759
01:16:13,025 --> 01:16:14,822
Over here.

760
01:16:18,105 --> 01:16:19,424
Damn it!

761
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:38,343
Hey! It's fine. We can save your son.

762
01:16:59,905 --> 01:17:03,375
Officer! Park it for me. Will you?

763
01:17:04,345 --> 01:17:08,861
Looks like local boys took our warning
hard. What are you doing now?

764
01:17:09,065 --> 01:17:11,778
Setting for local time.
Working on creating one

765
01:17:11,803 --> 01:17:14,402
with few more changes,
which automatically...

766
01:17:14,585 --> 01:17:17,777
Automatically resets to
whatever time zone you're in.

767
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:20,047
I eagerly await.
I eagerly await.

768
01:17:21,865 --> 01:17:23,537
I'm Baker. This is Stans.

769
01:17:23,745 --> 01:17:26,554
I can't guarantee that
anything's gonna happen,

770
01:17:26,579 --> 01:17:29,446
but thank you for taking
my warning seriously...

771
01:17:40,145 --> 01:17:41,783
You can not come in.

772
01:17:41,985 --> 01:17:44,204
- I have to get my family.
The grandmother is seriously

773
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:46,605
ill. It's an emergency.
- What's her name? - Ah! Lindquist!

774
01:17:58,865 --> 01:18:00,503
A couple more...

775
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:03,183
... We'll be ready to go.

776
01:18:03,385 --> 01:18:10,416
Lindquist party! Please report the
first-aid station on the main con-course.

777
01:18:12,945 --> 01:18:14,298
Thank you.

778
01:18:14,465 --> 01:18:16,748
If you could just point me
to the first-aid station?

779
01:18:16,773 --> 01:18:17,720
Sure! Absolutely.

780
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,644
Alright! Go out through
the door here, straight

781
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:21,444
down the hallway, and when
you get to the end...

782
01:18:24,865 --> 01:18:26,014
Open this up! Open this up!

783
01:18:30,745 --> 01:18:32,873
Steve! Could you go and
get something to eat?

784
01:18:32,898 --> 01:18:34,887
They just paged us.
It's an emergency.

785
01:18:35,065 --> 01:18:37,374
No. There is no emergency.

786
01:18:43,465 --> 01:18:45,695
- I'm testing.
- Hurry!

787
01:18:45,905 --> 01:18:48,055
Hello? Is this thing working?

788
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:50,062
Attention! Attention!...

789
01:18:50,265 --> 01:18:51,453
What are you doing here Tom?

790
01:18:51,478 --> 01:18:53,725
There's gonna be an explosion.
We must get out.

791
01:18:53,905 --> 01:18:56,499
Fine! Last time you said that there
gonna be a fire. And this....?

792
01:18:56,705 --> 01:19:02,063
Attention! There's a bomb in the arena!
I repeat! There's a bomb in the arena!

793
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:05,337
- Please! Evacuate immediately!
- We must take Kevin.

794
01:19:08,345 --> 01:19:11,701
Please try to be calm!
Head to the emergency exits!

795
01:19:12,785 --> 01:19:16,175
Please stay calm! I repeat!
There's a bomb in the arena!

796
01:19:16,385 --> 01:19:18,341
Hey! I'm out of here.

797
01:19:22,145 --> 01:19:25,774
We gotta do this now,
before any more of these people get out.

798
01:19:41,305 --> 01:19:43,102
Where's Kevin?

799
01:19:50,265 --> 01:19:51,903
Dad!

800
01:19:53,065 --> 01:19:55,943
I'm not gonna let you do it this time.

801
01:19:58,425 --> 01:20:00,256
You idiot.

802
01:20:01,665 --> 01:20:03,542
Put the detonator down, Cortez!

803
01:20:05,465 --> 01:20:08,935
- You have any idea what you're doing?
- Now!

804
01:20:45,505 --> 01:20:47,223
Merrick! This way.

805
01:20:59,945 --> 01:21:02,505
Jen! We must try to get out of here!

806
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:19,982
No moves!
Drop your weapon!

807
01:21:25,265 --> 01:21:26,744
Get away!

808
01:21:49,465 --> 01:21:52,457
- We're trapped!
- How do we get out?

809
01:21:54,825 --> 01:21:56,463
Stanton! You are Stanton!

810
01:21:56,665 --> 01:22:00,658
You shouldn't have invented
Stanza-displacer.

811
01:22:00,865 --> 01:22:03,299
You shouldn't have invented...

812
01:22:18,865 --> 01:22:20,617
Stay down on the floor.

813
01:22:25,185 --> 01:22:30,213
Merrick! Put it down!
Damn you! Put it down!

814
01:22:30,425 --> 01:22:32,655
Put it down!

815
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:36,221
- If I do that, we all are dead.
- I don't negotiate.

816
01:22:36,425 --> 01:22:38,461
Drop it! Now!

817
01:22:38,665 --> 01:22:42,453
We are trapped.
You've seen what weapon could do.

818
01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:46,294
- It's our only way out of here.
- He may be right.

819
01:22:46,505 --> 01:22:50,293
Shut up Stanton.
Put it down! now!

820
01:23:09,425 --> 01:23:11,097
My leg!

821
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:15,860
Everybody out. Now! Now!

822
01:23:34,625 --> 01:23:36,297
My leg...

823
01:23:40,185 --> 01:23:41,743
Easy.

824
01:23:44,105 --> 01:23:46,096
Thank you!

825
01:24:07,745 --> 01:24:10,278
Stanton! What I said
earlier, that you're not

826
01:24:10,303 --> 01:24:12,559
having what it takes
for the field work?

827
01:24:12,745 --> 01:24:14,258
Ignore it.

828
01:24:14,465 --> 01:24:16,352
But Sir! I think I'm
gonna take your

829
01:24:16,377 --> 01:24:18,721
suggestion and switch
to the technical field.

830
01:24:18,905 --> 01:24:23,342
...killing 200 of the
16,000 in attendance...

831
01:24:30,025 --> 01:24:31,856
Kevin!

832
01:24:35,105 --> 01:24:36,823
Mom!

833
01:24:40,905 --> 01:24:42,861
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

834
01:24:45,825 --> 01:24:47,975
How did you know about all this?

835
01:24:48,185 --> 01:24:51,655
It's a long story.
I'll tell you some day.

836
01:24:54,225 --> 01:24:56,136
Thank you.

837
01:24:59,865 --> 01:25:02,618
Am I gonna see you soon, Kevin?

838
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:06,534
- Yeah!
- Sure. Anytime.

839
01:25:15,105 --> 01:25:17,380
Look! I've got to take care of something.

840
01:25:20,025 --> 01:25:22,459
- See you real soon.
- Okay!

841
01:25:25,505 --> 01:25:28,178
- Bye.
- You can't stand here, folks.

842
01:25:37,545 --> 01:25:39,342
Where are you going?

843
01:25:39,545 --> 01:25:43,857
- Look, Tom...
- Tom. You called me Tom.

844
01:25:44,065 --> 01:25:46,135
That's, that's good. Tom.

845
01:25:48,505 --> 01:25:52,817
It looked like you were staying,
and I didn't wanna interfere.

846
01:25:54,825 --> 01:25:56,622
Anyway, I thought...

847
01:26:34,825 --> 01:26:39,376
