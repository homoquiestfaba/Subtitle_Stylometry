1
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:12,646
Look at the current temperature.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,315
Would you look at it?

3
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:18,319
At this hour, after 11:00,
tt is 52 mild degrees.

4
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,288
But when we take a look
at future cast here,

5
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:22,690
Here's part of the changes
that we're watching here,

6
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:25,393
and that is, as we head toward
early tomorrow morning,

7
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,828
we will see clouds,
and even fog, settle in.

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,263
The good news, though,

9
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:31,099
is that they will quickly
burn off

10
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:32,433
as we go through the rest of
the day,

11
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,268
and we are looking at a day

12
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,105
that will be pretty much what
We saw.. like what we saw today:

13
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,772
Partly cloudy and very mild.

14
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:40,841
So get ready for another
good day.

15
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,410
As far as lows go tonight, again,

16
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,378
it is not going to be like
the lows

17
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:46,247
that we've seen over the past
few weeks.

18
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,083
It's going to be very mild
tonight for everybody,

19
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:51,519
from top to bottom,
no matter where you are.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,123
Ellijay, 43.
Griffin, 44.

21
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:58,326
43, that's the low for the folks
in Rome and Atlanta.

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,760
You're looking at lows..

23
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,163
Lows for tonight that'll be
around 46 degrees.

24
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,198
Tomorrow's highs:
Here we go again.

25
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:05,533
More warmth on the way.

26
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,800
Can you stand it?

27
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:08,136
65 degrees.
I'm sure you can.

28
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,603
I can.

29
00:01:09,637 --> 00:01:11,539
Atlanta, 67 will be the high
for you tomorrow.

30
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,108
As we take a look at Athens, 66.

31
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:18,479
Eatonton, up and over 71
degrees tomorrow.

32
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,414
So here's a look at your
forecast by the numbers.

33
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,217
On a scale from one to ten..
Oh, yes, we did.

34
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,518
We're doing it.
We're going there.

35
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:26,854
We are giving tomorrow a ten.
Why?

36
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,857
It is going to be so much
warmer than the average.

37
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,426
Average high, by the way,
in the upper 50s,

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,727
and we're looking at temperatures

39
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,163
that will be in the upper 60s,

40
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,697
and we are not stopping there,

41
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,201
because we do have some 70s
in the forecast for you.

42
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,669
Yes, we do.

43
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:43,371
Here's a look at the
seven-day forecast.

44
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,872
67 degrees, mainly sunny tomorrow

45
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,275
after the clouds and fog
burn off in the morning,

46
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,444
then as we head toward Friday,
calling it partly cloudy and 72.

47
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:52,246
Saturday and Sunday, partly cloudy.

48
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,547
Look at those numbers, though.

49
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,816
Still holding on to the low
70s there.

50
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,687
Monday and Tuesday, possibly a
weak disturbance coming our way.

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,255
There may be a slight chance
for rain,

52
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,923
but temperatures still will be
above average.

53
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,626
So Saturday and Sunday.. even
when you step outside tonight..

54
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,428
You feel it; it's mild.

55
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,930
It doesn't feel like
February at all, does it?

56
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,466
But as we head toward
the next couple of days,

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,168
will that change?

58
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,636
We'll find out coming up,

59
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:18,239
but let's talk about
this outside right now.

60
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,873
Our exclusive Weatherbug Network

61
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,376
for Fernbank Science Center
in Atlanta,

62
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,378
current temperature at this hour,

63
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,813
just under 60 degrees.

64
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:28,449
The high today, 72.

65
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,817
It feels great, y'all.

66
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,685
Here's a look at their
surface map,

67
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,288
showing us what's gonna come our
way as we head toward tomorrow,

68
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,857
and really, it's more warm air
from the southeast,

69
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,526
and that'll be the story for us.

70
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,395
We will not only stay dry
with the warm wind.

71
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,897
We will keep it party cloudy
and beautiful as well.

72
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,800
So look for your Friday to be
another gorgeous day.

73
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,736
What a better way to get into
the weekend?

74
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,805
As far as highs are concerned,
look at these numbers.

75
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,973
73 in Gainesville.

76
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,842
75 for the folks in Athens.

77
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,710
In Atlanta, 75.

78
00:02:56,744 --> 00:03:00,648
75 is what we're forecasting
For the ATL as well.

79
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,916
Up in Rome, we're looking at 71,

80
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,453
And 75 for the folks in Carlton.

81
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,557
So if we make that forecasted
high of 75 degrees tomorrow,

82
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,992
We will at least..
At the very least..

83
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,963
Tie the record high that has
already been set for 75 degrees.

84
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:19,233
So we'll keep you posted
and let you know if we do that.

85
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,668
Forecast by the numbers,
on a scale from one to ten...

86
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,236
Nah, quit playing.
I'm trying to smash.

87
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,604
Hey, Bro, hey.
Hey, got off of my car, Man.

88
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:25,239
What's wrong with you?
Sitting there.

89
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,674
Get off my car, Man.

90
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,975
Man, it's a piece of trash anyway.

91
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,304
Baby...

92
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,271
All right.

93
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,047
Damn, Zay, maybe if you
returned a nigga's phone call,

94
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,616
may be riding in a better car.

95
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,351
Been at the shop Wednesday.
No prob, Bro.

96
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,352
Juiceman.

97
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,353
Hey, Man.

98
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,388
What up, Bro?

99
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:15,723
How you doing, Bro?

100
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,358
How you doing, Bro?
Doing all right.

101
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,659
Prat, what up?
Dang, my bad, Cuz.

102
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,494
I had this late rehearsal
last night.

103
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,396
Man, I've been meaning to get
back with you, Man.

104
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,764
Yeah, well,
I see you've been having

105
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,299
A little car trouble, Man.

106
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,667
What's up with the beats,
Zay, Man?

107
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,369
You know I got a few hundred
for you, damn.

108
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,837
Man, Prat, what up, Man?

109
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,505
You know I got you, Man.

110
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,040
Tied up like crazy, Man, working.

111
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,676
Hey, Zay, Man, you might as
well sign with me, Cuz.

112
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,778
Take it to the auction or
something, Bro.

113
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,680
You know I'll help you out, Bro.

114
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,714
You know what?

115
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:41,782
Tell you what.

116
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,050
You give me a ride to the shop,

117
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,585
that's something we can talk about.

118
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,819
Let it go, Bro.
I got you.

119
00:04:45,853 --> 00:04:47,020
All right.

120
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,456
What about the CD, though, Man?

121
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,490
What about my CD, man?

122
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,658
Hey, Boy, that boy Zay, Boy.

123
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,092
Be dancing like a fool, Man.

124
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,494
You got to get what you can, Boy.

125
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:54,795
I don't need that cut, Boy.

126
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,464
Boy, he be tripping by them tracks.

127
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:57,765
Oh, I got you, Bro.

128
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,567
I got my CD player right

129
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,935
I can burn you a disc while
we in here.

130
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,042
Hey, you.

131
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,412
Brought you some chips.

132
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,913
Appreciate it.

133
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,948
I mean, I got some soda too,
but I backwashed it.

134
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,717
What?

135
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,885
Girl, you know I do what I
want to do.

136
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,520
Okay?

137
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,088
No, I'm straight, though.
Appreciate it.

138
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,656
All right, then,
I'll see you later.

139
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,358
Okay, bye.

140
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:25,893
Damn, Zay.

141
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,995
She come in here every day.

142
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,363
Hey, baby, where mine at?

143
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,731
Where you going?

144
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:34,134
Hey, Bro,
leave my woman alone, please.

145
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,669
Thank you.

146
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,670
Dang.

147
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,705
"Leave your women alone"?

148
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,106
I heard you, Man.

149
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,774
You're three weeks behind in
your rent.

150
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,009
Three weeks behind.

151
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,612
One more week,
and you out of here.

152
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,879
I'm not putting up with it
no more.

153
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:47,981
Man.
Calls or no calls. I mean it.

154
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,050
Let me breathe, Man.
It's my birthday month.

155
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,118
I'ma get it to you.

156
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,119
Don't I always?

157
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,987
Oh, Zaytoven.

158
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,391
Never let 'em see you sweat,
Hey, Cuz-o?

159
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,893
Ah, what's up, Boy?
What up, Cuz?

160
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,895
What are you doing down here,
Man?

161
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,567
Where she at?
I'm hungry, Man.

162
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,901
I know.
Where is she?

163
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,169
I ain't waiting around..

164
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,404
Here you are.

165
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:11,672
French fries for you.

166
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,006
Thank you.

167
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,174
And a grilled chicken salad.

168
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,676
Oh, yeah.

169
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,177
Will that be all for you gentlemen?

170
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,179
Ah, no.
You know, I need a fork.

171
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,748
A fork.
And would you like anything?

172
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,684
Salt and pepper.
Salt and pepper.

173
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,152
So what's up, Bro?

174
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,688
What are you doing down here
in Atlanta, Man?

175
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,657
What kind of tricks you got
up your sleeve, Bro?

176
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,024
I know it's something.

177
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,760
Why do I always got to have
a scam?

178
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,663
I came to Atlanta to see
the sun,

179
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:36,664

180
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:38,532
Yeah.

181
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,734
And if I make some money,
hey, that's something different.

182
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,169
Yeah, gonna make some money, yeah?

183
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,137
Well, you know,

184
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,839

00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:48,108
Yeah, so how long you staying

00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,844
And really, when you leaving?

187

Oh, for real, Cuz,

188
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:53,814
When are you leaving?

189
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,617
Cuz, ain't not telling when
I'm leaving.

190
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,153
All I need is just a little spot
to chill at just for a minute.

191
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:02,089
You know what I'm saying?

192
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,824
Whose spot, mine?

193
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,092
Yours, yeah.

194
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,894
What, you on the run or something?

00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,597
Man, no,

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,665
Listen, now, what you doing

197
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,567
Have you got us an industry
check yet, Cuz?

198
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,603
Or are you still playing with

Now, you talking about the industry?

00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,251
Man, there ain't no industry.

00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,586
What you talking about?

209
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,888
You know what I was thinking?

210
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:38,225
You should let me manage you.

211
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:39,593

00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:40,894

You got to think about it, Cuz.

00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,630
Well, you sure know how to talk, though.

Oh, you working with him?

I'll tell you what I did come

253
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,308
Some paper.

254
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,343
Mm.
Mm.

255
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,812
Let me see.

256
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:09,983
Feel like this might cover

257
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,352
a few months of rent or something
like that.

258
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,255
Listen, Cuz, we're about the get.

259
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,791
We're birds of a feather, Cuz.

00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:18,992
I got us.

261
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,994
Trust me, Cuz.

262
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,231
Nephew.

263
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,701
We ain't paying for no early
rehearsal, are we?

264
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,373
Yo, hey, Xavier,

265
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,843
Man, where you learn how to
play the keyboard, Man?

266
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,146
Such anointing.

267
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,082
I don't know.

268
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:18,085
But all I'm saying, like,
Man, when I play these keys,

269
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,987
I feel like I'm free from everything.

270
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,822
So when I talked to your daddy,

271
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,824
I know he told me you was
coming down to the church..

272
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,158
I didn't even know

273
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,860
If I was gonna let you play
in this church.

274
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,929
Why you say that?

275
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,933
Well, you know, you got such
very little musical experience.

276
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,203
You was in the Bay Area,
but since you been here,

277
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:38,105
You worked so hard.

278
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,808
and, Man, listen, Man,
from you to me,

279
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:44,244
You've outplayed everybody,
every musician,

280
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,079
I brought to this church.

281
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,015
Man, I just want to tell you,
Xavier, Man,

282
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,984
I love you, and I'm proud of you.

283
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,723
Well, I am the minister of music.

284
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,290
Minister of music, huh?

285
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,126
Yeah.

286
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,895
Let me tell.. let me tell you
a little something about music.

287
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:04,698
You know, there was a character
in the bible.

288
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:07,067
And his name was Lucifer,

289
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,403
and he was over God's heavenly choir,

290
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:14,474
and God had blessed Lucifer
with many gifts, Man.

291
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:19,312
But, you know,
Lucifer got beside himself.

292
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,848
And, Zay, just like you,

293
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,284
God has blessed you with many gifts.

294
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,353
Man, I love to hear you play.

295
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,388
But whatever you do,

296
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:34,294
Don't let your gift get in the
way of god's progress for you.

297
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,796
Can you do that for me?

298
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,765
Can you make Unc happy by
doing that?

299
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,799
I can do that.

300
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,000
All right.

301
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,168
Hey, what's going on, y'all?

302
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,402
Oh, what up?

Hey, how we doing, everybody?

How we doing?
Hey, Pastor.

305
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,940
Hey, how we doing, everybody?

306
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,876
Yeah, I was just sitting here
talking to Xavier.

307
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,878
But, listen,
let me get ready to get out of here.

308
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,113
I know y'all fittin' to get on

00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,950
Let's turn this thing up.

312
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,485

Man, y'all heard the Pastor.

315
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,391
Man, he said, "Turn it up."

316
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:06,259
Come on, y'all, let's turn it up.

317

All right, go ahead, Baby.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah, work it out.

Zoe.

334
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,804
Zoe.

335
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:51,872
Ah, no, no...

336
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,140
Zoe.

337
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,441
Hey, Bro.

338

Man, what did you tell him?

341
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,052
Man, for real, though,

342
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:06,419
Come on, Man.
Come on, Zoe.

343
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,121
Zay deserves way more than
the mixtape place..

344
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,356
You got some loose change?

345
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,158

00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,426
Man, he deserve way more than

00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,196
But listen to what I'm telling you:

349
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,865
Records aren't selling right
now, Man.

350
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,366
For me, it's about a
motherfucking single,

351
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,901
In the streets,
you're talking about

352
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:22,102
a motherfucking single, not me.

353
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,336
You feel me?

354
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,338
Ain't no bds-ing that, My Nigga.

355
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,606
For Zaytoven, the mixtape cool.

356
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,608
Man, gonna buzz tonight.

357
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,278
So just send me the beats, and
let me smash on 'em, My Nigga.

358
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,182
I'm just saying, we giving you
top-quality production for free.

359
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,950
At least let the nigga get
his first single.

360
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:39,486
God damn, Man.
What up, Man?

361
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,154
You got cash that you're
slinging, Man.

362
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,355
Now, you gave your money up, Bro.

363
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,423
You gonna get another, Man.

364
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,092
Don't worry about that, Bro.

365
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,960
Worry about me being in no
gas station, nigga.

366
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,261
Just try to worry about Gorilla Zoe

367
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,963
needing another single, nigga.

368
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,564
And Zaytoven is the nigga
that's gonna do it.

369
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,000
Trust me, Bro.

370
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,467
I need another Motherfucking record?

371
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,403
Nah, Nigga.
Zay need a record, Nigga.

372
00:13:56,436 --> 00:13:58,271
Give a nigga a good chance,
Man, shit.

373
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,041
You should've stayed your ass
in Detroit, Boy.

374
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,943
Listen, Man, I ain't got time
for this shit, Man.

375
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,444
You ain't got no finesse on you,
My Nigga.

376
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,113
I'm shooting a video.

377
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,647
I'm wasting money talking to
you right now.

378
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,482
What you mean?

379
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,952
You know what? Matter of fact,
I'll holler at you later.

380
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,320
Uh, Zoe..

381
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,554
Zoe.

382
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,989
Fuck, Man.

383
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,059
Don't be shorting me, Stank.

384
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,994
Have I ever shorted you, Man?
Yes.

385
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,529
Hey, Man, you be tripping, Man.

386
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,898
That rap shit making you crazy, Man.

387
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,133
You need some Prozac?

388
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,400
Need some balls or something?

389
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,436
Man, you too excited, Man.

390
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:31,438
Stank, get the fuck out of my
car, please.

00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,506
Man, fuck you too, Man.

392
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,913
Hey, Stank,

393
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,248
You know it.

394
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,087
Man, I'm gonna get you your
punk-ass money, Man.

395
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,421
You crying about that little bullshit.

396
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:49,422
Yo, for real...

397
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,996
What the fuck, Man?

398
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,484

Oh, Man.

405
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,331
What's up, Bro?

406
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,733
Bro, I know.

407
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,703
Come on, Man,
I'm getting sick of seeing these.

408
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:39,206
You out there getting that money
for the team, or what?

409
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,208
Nigga, I'm trying to.
We got to pay the rent first.

410
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,509
T.G.E. and them come through?

411
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,643
Yeah, they came through.

412
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,178
The money in the cabinet.

413
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,547
But you know we still, like,
$200 short, Man.

414
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,983
Yo, don't even worry about it.
Listen, I got a plan.

415
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,718
Remember Doc?
I was telling you about Doc?

416
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,221
Doc gonna be ready tonight,
Cuz, 8:00.

417
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,423
All I need you to do is be ready,
My Nigga.

418
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,091
Listen, you know good and well,

419
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,060
8:00 tonight, I got rehearsal.

420
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,661
I'm not fittin' to..
You should've called me, Bro.

421
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,063
Come on, Man,
This church shit again.

422
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:04,464
Come on, Zay.
What you mean?

423
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,166
This is a blessing from God
right here.

424
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,767
God wants you to make it to
this meeting, Bro.

425
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,369
This nigga know Guch.

426
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,637
I ain't tryin' to be..

427
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,738
You know, being a nigga like this,

428
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,273
But I really feel like he right.

429
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,341
You should go, Man.

430
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,542
I mean, it might be a good..

431
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,244
That's all I'm saying, Man.

432
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:20,013
Zaytoven, we cannot keep making
a million fucking records

433
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,115
and not doing nothing with
them, Bro.

434
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,483
What.. what are we in it for?

435
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,218
Bro, I'm a producer, Bro.

436
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:26,786
I'm making records 'cause
that's what I do.

437
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,321
That's what I'm supposed to do.

438
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,589
I'm doing what I'm supposed
to do.

439
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,723
What you doing?

440
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,225
What you mean, what I'm doing?

441
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,660
What you doing?
Guess what, Nigga.

442
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,462
I just got your first single
with Gorilla Zoe.

443
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,663
How about that?

444
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,098
Ah, whoo, whoo.
Single, huh?

445
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:39,566
Now, it's a mixtape, but still.

446
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,234
I mean, it's a placement.
It's a start.

447
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,103
A mixtape.. a mixtape no bad
luck, though, Zay.

448
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,472
You know, that how a lot of 'em
got started, though.

449
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,641
That what got me poppin'.
That what I'm saying, Man.

450
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,243
Nah, Man, look, we rockin', Bro.

451
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,245
No, but this nigga for real,
though, Man.

452
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,047
This nigga..
He be on something else.

453
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,682
I don't..
I mean, I don't know about him.

454
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,617
I think you should go, though,
real talk, though.

455
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,286
They might be the nigga with
the check.

456
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,321
Put this..

457
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,226
I'm about to shoot some pool
right now,

458
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,095
Get the rest of this damn
rent money, Man.

459
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,197
And why don't you be ready

460
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,832
Yeah, well, you go get my

461
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,767

And what's up?

481
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,408
Why you late, anyway?

482
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,709
For real?

483
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,279
Man, I'm late for the same reason

484
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,515
Why you can't hit the high
notes on sunday.

485
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,617
Hey, Andy come on upstairs yet?

486
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,252
Yeah, and he brought 'em,

487
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:40,887
but Fredrick said they short
again this week.

488
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,489
Short?

489
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,391
Yeah, so you know what that
mean, right?

490
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:48,761
That hour-long rehearsal..
30 minutes.

491
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,299
Matter of fact, my 30's up.

492
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:54,401
Man, I could've used that
little money, Man.

493
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:56,336
Me too.

494
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,771
I could've went to my meeting.

495
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,273
Let me guess.

496
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,642
The meeting with your cousin?

497
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:04,711
I wonder how that's working
out for you.

498
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,348
Well, you ain't seen me on
B.E.T. Yet, have you?

499
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:10,517
Something gonna give, though.

500
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,618
For real,

501
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,386
If y'all was smart,

502
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,655
y'all would be looking for
other places to play.

503
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:19,559
'Cause word on the street,
this church in foreclosure.

504
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,828
Nah, uh-uh.
Don't believe that.

505
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,663
What?
Don't believe that?

506
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,598
Man, you better ask your uncle.

507
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,899
Shoot, whatever.

508
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,568
You ain't got to believe me, though.

509
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,504
Man, I ain't worried what my
uncle do, Dion.

510
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,241
And you shouldn't be worried
about him, either.

511
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:38,445
Listen, Man, I got thoughts bigger,
past this church,

512
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,713
Past you, past my unc.

513
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,782
Man, I might come back and
buy this church.

514
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,252
Ha. You sound crazy, Zay.

515
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,387
Yo, you know what? Matter of
fact, y'all go ahead, Man.

516
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,222
Y'all go on and leave.

517
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,990
I got to work on what I'm
doing for Sunday, anyway.

518
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,927
I mean, I could stay.

519
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,463
Whatever, Man.

520
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,897
Y'all have a good rehearsal.
I'm out.

521
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,998
All right.

522
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,500
Yeah, whatever.

523
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,669
All right, well,
since you gonna stay,

524
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,005
let's go over that song you were
just singing when I walked in.

525
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,442
All right.

526
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,615
It's only business.

527
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,384
You received the fucking cases;

528
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:20,353
I expect to receive my money
on time.

529
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:24,291
This is VIP premium,
not VI3 premium, Man.

530
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,625
Y'all get that money over
here, Man,

531
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,294
Before I go back to my
rattlesnake days.

532
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,529
Huh?

533
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,431
Get him to call me himself.

534
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,802
Here we go, Man.
You're not hungry.

535
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:37,337
Hey, this better not be

536
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,938
Another one of your dope
fiend sales.

537
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,573
For real, Man.

538
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,610
And if it is,
It better be for the rent money.

539
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,744
You know what I mean?

540
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,616
What is that, Bro?

541
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:50,983
You owe him some money or something?

542
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:52,852
No.. yeah.
No, Man, shut up, Man.

543
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:53,986
It's your fault anyway, Cuz.

544
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,755
You always standing niggas up.

545
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,724
I knew you weren't gonna be
ready yesterday, Man.

546
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,826
You standing niggas up, Zay.
That shit ain't cool, Bro.

547
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,694
For real, Man?
This shit business, Man.

548
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,796
I've been playing in church
as long as I can remember.

549
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,898
What do you want me to do,
stop that for this right here?

550
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,334
Hey, what's up?
What's up, Bro?

551
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,735
What's going on, Man?

552
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,470
I'm trying to sell my CD
right now. $5, Bro.

553
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:11,738
Ain't nobody spin like me.

554
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,640
I'm going down, Boy.
I promise, Bro.

555
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,742
I ain't ask for no more money
Than that. $5. $5. $5, Bro.

556
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,477
One second.
We'll be right out.

557
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,579
You ain't gonna shit on a
nigga like that, Bro.

558
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,755
Yeah, I'm here to see Doc.

559
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,023
Doc? Um, Doc...

560
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,325
Sign right here, please.

561
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:34,594
Uh...

562
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,895
Um, got anybody following you?

563
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,430
No, Bro.

564
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:40,032
Uh...

565
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,535
Shit, I'm getting Doc right now.

566
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,070
All right, Man.

567
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,610
What's up?

568
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,548
You see what happened to the
boy in there?

569
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,384
The eye.

570
00:21:57,417 --> 00:21:58,918
I don't know.

571
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,087
Those fucking foreigners, Man.

572
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,623
No, you think this is a game.

573
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,957
Stay clear of my paper.

574
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,025
Doc.

575
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,760
First thing, Man.

576
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,562
Friday morning I want y'all
to get down there

577
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:10,763
and check this shit out, Man.

578
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,668
I'll be down on Friday,
motherfucking 6:00 A.M., Man.

579
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,505
What?

580
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,640
(Mumbling)

581
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,742
I'll do it myself.
Yo, Doc, what up, Bro?

582
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,378
Zaytoven, Mr. Funky Fingers.

583
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,480
What it do?
Heard a lot about you.

584
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:30,417
Shit, I ain't tell what you
heard about me.

585
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,552
Either way, I don't give a fuck.

586
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:33,820
Got that paper, Nuke?

587
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,722
Yeah.
What up, Doc?

588
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:37,123
Hey, hey.

589
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,928
Hey, Doc, I know you busy as hell,
but check it.

590
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:43,563
This my cousin, Zaytoven, Man,

591
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:45,565
The nigga threw the beats
I was telling you about.

592
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,666
Stupid with 'em too, Man.

593
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,800
15 minutes, Cuz.

594
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,135
That's all we need.

595
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,637
Or.. or we can come back, you know,

596
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,171
If you got something going on.

597
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,441
You know, we understand.
We see you got a lot going on.

598
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,609
We can come back if we need to.

599
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,711
Shit, you doing all the talkin'.

600
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,079
Got your CD with you?

601
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,681
Yeah.

602
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,783
Get that motherfucker in
there, Man.

603
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,117
Appreciate it.

604
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,786
Hold on.
Give me five minutes too, Man.

605
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,989
Okay.

606
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:13,826
Watch for me.

607
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,663
(Mumbling)

608
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:18,465
You thirsty.
You just thirsty, Man.

609
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:20,199
I mean,
I'm thirsty because I am, Nnigga.

610
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,068
We need to get some money.

611
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,102
What's wrong with you, Bro?

612
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,506
Clown, Man.

613
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,840
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:39,819
Shit, that was banging, though.

615
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,187
Appreciate it, Bro.
Appreciate it.

616
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,722
Appreciate that, Man.

617
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,457
I ain't know if it would, you know,

618
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,125
Bother your conversation a
little too loud or whatever,

619
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,560
Man, but appreciate that.

620
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:48,861
Nah, nah, nah, it's good, Homey.

621
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,497
Don't fuck with that.

622
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,998
Ain't no rap thing in the
music industry,

623
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,566
Nothing like that, like.

624
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,702
See, what y'all come to my
house for?

625
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,604
I'm thinking..
Like, check it.

626
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,872
I know you know Gucci Mane,
you know what I'm saying?

627
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,809
Maybe you could plug Zay in with
Gucci, let him hear some tracks.

628
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,711
Maybe they can do some shit,
make it big.

629
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:06,479
Man, see, the thing is,

630
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:07,947
I fuck with Gucci on some
street shit.

631
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,981
You know what I mean?

632
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,550
It ain't no music shit,

633
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,685
But I know I could put the
play together.

634
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,220
But, shit, I don't do no
communal service.

635
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,055
What's in it for me?

636
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,491
Well, I was thinking, Man,
if he cops a lead or something,

637
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,561
I give you something off of that.

638
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,095
That sound like a promise.

639
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,031
I don't work off promises,
Homey.

640
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:27,734
What's in it for me?
What's really in it for me?

641
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,802
I'm thinking publishing,
you know what I'm saying?

642
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,938
Publishing, you got residual
income coming in,

643
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,039
You know what I'm saying?

644
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,106
That's a good thing, Man.

645
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,942
Publishing?
Mm-hmm.

646
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,610
It's residual income,

647
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,579
Meaning that you will make
money.. good money..

648
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,613
For a long time.

649
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,614
It's bigger than records.

650
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:43,182
Publishing?
Yeah.

651
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,817
Man, I don't know nothing
about no publishing.

652
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,285
Talk english, Homey.

653
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,021
If the radio play the record,
the radio got to pay us.

654
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,658
In return, we gonna pay you,
you know what I'm saying?

655
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,159
It's big, trust me.

656
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,961
I can make sure that your kids..
Everybody..

657
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,295
Gonna be eating for good.

658
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,030
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
Excuse me, Bro.

659
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,567
Hey, Man, let me holler at you
for a minute, Bro.

660
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,537
Give me one minute.

661
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:05,972
Why are you even talking
about publishing?

662
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,774
You know what I mean?
You really...

663
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:09,676
Cuz, what the fuck is wrong
with you?

664
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,978
Let this man make the call.
Nigga, what's wrong with you?

665
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,547
I'm not fittin' to give this
Nigga none of my publishing.

666
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,883
You don't even know what the
fuck publishing is.

667
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,619
Man, let this nigga make this
phone call, Cuz.

668
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:21,153
He gonna forget about this
shit tomorrow.

669
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,855
Let the plan go through.

670
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:26,559
I'm not gonna sell my soul
for no phone call!

671
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,695
This nigga right here ain't
getting a piece of nothin',

672
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:29,729
Not from me.

673
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:30,963
Man, what you want?

674
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,331
All of nothing or a piece of something?

675
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,966
This is our chance.

676
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,702
You know what I don't like, Bro?

677
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,671
How everybody talking about
my music, my money,

678
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,072
that I don't even got yet.

679
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,742
Come on, Man.

680
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:46,979
Hey, Doc, Bro,
it was good to meet you.

681
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,281
You know what I mean?
You got a nice place here.

682
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,618
I know we gonna do business
one day, you know what I mean?

683
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:52,919
I appreciate your time.

684
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,621
Hey, Man,
I'll be out in the car.

685
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:57,223
You can stay here and do your thing.

686
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,025
What's up with your man?

687
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,761
Yo, I don't know, Doc.

688
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:03,062
But check it, Man.

689
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,163
That publisher shit is big.

690
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,264
Trust me, Man.

691
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,033
And I'ma make sure

692
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,235
That you get a piece of this
nigga's publishing forever.

693
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:10,870
All you got to do is make the
call, Man.

694
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,705
Just make the call and get us
some money, Doc.

695
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:13,840
Please, Man.

696
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,708
I'll tell you what, Nuke.

697
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:18,845
I'ma put that shit together.

00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,213
That's what I'm gonna do.

715
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,214

What's up?

720
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:03,856
What's going on with that weed?

721
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,957
I'm rolling the weed.

722
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,092

00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,727
You're a fiend.
Relax.

00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:09,696
Damn.

725
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,834

Foul, Man.
It ain't no fucking foul.

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,772
You got to man up or something,
Little Man.

729
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:21,007
You ain't big enough.

730
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,308
You ain't big enough.

731
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:23,710
You ain't big enough, Man.

732
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,779
For real, Ma.
This is gold right here.

733
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,915
You dealing with good niggas,

734
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,050
Once in a while.. like,
when you gonna get on the court?

735
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:33,019
Get on the court?
Baby, I don't play basketball.

736
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:34,453
I let Zaytoven play basketball.

737
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,022
Let's go.
Gentlemen, let's go, Man.

738
00:27:36,055 --> 00:27:37,223

00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,363
It's my $500. Exactly.

00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,832
Hey, yo.

What you gonna do?
I want you to come down here.

00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:52,271
You can come down here, Bro.

748
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:55,274
You can come down here.

749
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,308
Kill him, Son!

750

755
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,453
Call me when you wake up.

756
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,221
You dreaming.
Call me when you wake up.

757
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,157
I don't give a fuck.
This is street ball, Man.

758
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,258
This is street ball.

759
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,392
This ain't the NBA.

760
00:28:13,425 --> 00:28:14,761
Fuck you trying to be?

761
00:28:14,794 --> 00:28:16,428

763
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,267
Hey, Zay, don't let him
Break your finger, Boy.

764
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,035
Hold on.

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,138
I want to rock with you, though,
For real.

789
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,514

Jeezy in the city.

Shout-out to the fans.

00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,512
Yeah, probably..

00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,917
So however many you get today,

Let me call you right back.

00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,392
Dude, I'm your guy.

831
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,593
I mean, take it from me.

832
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,263
Matter of fact, here's your key.

833
00:31:04,296 --> 00:31:05,364
Appreciate it, Man.

834
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,033
All right.
Is it a deal?

835
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,034
It's a deal.

836
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,101
Abso-toot-a-lutely.

837
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,202
Double-check with him.

838
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:13,039
Going back in, Gucci, Rocko.

839
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,540
I got to slick ponder, Man.

840
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,275
You know, he working the
camera right now,

841
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,077
Man, but you know..
You know what I'm saying?

842
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,311
You know..

843
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,579
Did I get lost yesterday, though?

844
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,613
No, he kind of, you know..

845
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:22,648
I got lost coming out here.

846
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,216
You know what I mean?

847
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,684
We're gonna try to wrap it up
today, Man.

848
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,219
Day two.

849
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:28,520
We're gonna try to do it in
two days.

850
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,989
For real, Man.
Birds Of A Feather.

851
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:32,558
I apologize, Man.

852
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:34,326
I don't need a gift.

853
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,694
Number one, Man.

854
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,964
Platinum producer, Man.
A little sneak peek.

855
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:39,131
Don't show all of it, Man.

856
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:40,366
Yeah, come on, Artie.

857
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,568
Number one, Man.

858
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,303

00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,708
You know what I'm saying?

862
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,078
I just feel like everything we do,
every time we make a song,

863
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,612
It's a work of art.

864
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,614
Yeah, I just bought it, Man,
straight off the lot.

865
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:57,449
We gonna pull off and use it
for the video..

866
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,018
Guch's gonna pull off in it,

867
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,352
But I just spent that on it.

868
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:03,022
Gucci and Zay Classic coming

869
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,290

Yes, Sir.

872
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:25,677
I'm smiling.

873
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,413
Detroit, Detroit.

874
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,462
Get in line, Homey.

875
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,164
This is my first CD, Boss.

876
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,598

What's up?
What's up, Boy?

884
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:10,022
Everything 100?

885
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:12,791
Man, hey, I'm happy for y'all, Man.

886
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,260
You know me.
Everything 100, Man.

887
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,727
Is that Zay?

888
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,596
No, it ain't Zay.
No, this is his manager.

889
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:19,365
Tell him to give me those beats.

890
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,300
I've been sent over that email.

891
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,635
Listen, Man, Tiffany's on my ass.

892
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,337
This is my new artist,
Tiffany Foxx, Man.

893
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:26,372
She on my ass, Man.

894
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,739
I need that new hit.

895
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:29,775
Huh?
You know how we do it, Man.

896
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:33,145
Well, I heard y'all got that
B.E.T. Award, Man.

897
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:35,147
Congrats on that, Bro.

898
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,415
Yeah, Man.

899
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,050
Man, send that shit over ASAP, Nigga.

900
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,651
You know what it is.

901
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,620
All right, Boy, look,
we'll get at your ass later.

902
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:43,789
Hit the strip clubs.
Gonna fuck around.

903
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:44,790
Know what I mean?

904
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,258
All right, Boy.

905
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,559
Again, though.
Know what I mean?

906
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:49,061
I'm telling you, Man,
we got to, Man.

907
00:33:49,095 --> 00:33:50,462
That gang's for real.

908
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:52,198
You're in the stupid industry
right now,

909
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,200
And that's all the man Gucci is,
street nigga shit.

910
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,767
Mm-hmm.
Got him going crazy.

911
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:58,370
Got me booked all over with
them right now.

912
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,605
Sounds about right.

913
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:00,639
You know how I do.

914
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:03,342
Yeah.

915
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,545
Zay, who the hell the white
boy in here, Man?

916
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:07,613
Ah, Man, I don't know.

917
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:08,747
They like the police.

918
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,416
I know who they here for.

919
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,418
Excuse me, Zaytoven, I presume?

920
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:13,852
That's me.
Can I help you?

921
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,654
Look at this.

922
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:18,590
Four number one billboard
records, Grammy nominated,

923
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,726
and you can catch him out here
in Conyers, cutting hair.

924
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,428
How humbling.

925
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:25,497
This is the type of talent
we need to represent.

926
00:34:25,531 --> 00:34:27,166
Oh, is that right?

927
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,400
We're covert and covert,

928
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,835
The largest firm based out of
New York.

929
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,337
We represent the best of the best,

930
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,239
and you are the best of the best.

931
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:36,342
I appreciate y'all coming out
here, but I'm cool.

932
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,177
I got management already.

933
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,613
I had been reaching out to
Nuke for the past month.

934
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,550
No return phone calls, no emails.

935
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,786
Oh, Nuke, he's a three-time peddling,

936
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,756
two-bit hustling cousin from Detroit.

937
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,724
He might be good to give you
some street cred

938
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:53,892
or doing security for you,

939
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,461
but when it comes to our business,

940
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,663
Nobody can handle this business
the way we do.

941
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,165
Now, don't get us wrong.

942
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:00,799
Family's good and all to have around,

943
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,401
but we like to make money.

944
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,669
And lots of it.

945
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,304
You done, D.

946
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,905
Check it out, Man.

947
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,441
Hey.

948
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:10,776
All right, you're pimpin'.

949
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,478
I already know how that go.

950
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,446
But we might hit that magic
or something later on.

951
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,747
Okay.

952
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,749
Call me, Man.

953
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,451
Appreciate it, Bro.

954
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,719
All right.

955
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,388
I go by the name of K Digga, Man.

956
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:23,822
They got niggas, Boys.

957
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,292
Zay don't want to take that shit.
Truth.

958
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:27,326
All right, Zay.

959
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:28,794
All right, later.

960
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:32,164
Look, Guys, I do this right
here just to keep my sanity.

961
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,799
I ain't stuck up for no money,

962
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:36,835
and I most definitely ain't
looking for no big whigs

963
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,370
from New York

964
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,239
to come down here and take
over my career.

965
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,274
You know what I mean?
I'm straight.

966
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:44,443
I'm straight where I'm at.
I ain't got to be the biggest.

967
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:45,677
I'm cool.
All right?

968
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,279
We understand that, Zay,

969
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:49,248
and I understand you're a
very conservative man,

970
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,482
as well as myself.

971
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,251
You don't drink.
You don't smoke.

972
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:54,620
You play at your uncle's church
every Sunday.

973
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,822
You make $10,000 a track.

974
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,524
You making $100 for a haircut.

975
00:35:58,557 --> 00:35:59,658
You can tend with that.

976
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,261
You're worth $100,000 a track.

977
00:36:02,294 --> 00:36:06,965
BMI bonuses are great,
but Grammys is greatness.

978
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,401
We did a test run on you last week.

979
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,870
Lady Gaga is interested.

980
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:14,906
Sean Garrett is penning
Usher's next single,

981
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,575
wants you to produce it.

982
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:18,577
and Puffy wants to meet next week.

983
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,578
Come on, Man.

984
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,347
I ain't hard to find:

985
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,949
Email, Twitter, Facebook.

986
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,518
Come on, the radio station..
they got my numbers.

987
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:27,819
That's where we come into play.

988
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,888
Big whigs want to deal with
big whigs.

989
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,790
I'm ready to walk into
Warner Brothers right now

990
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:35,561
and demand a $1.5 million
distribution deal.

991
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:38,597
And a $1.2 pub deal from Ultra.

992
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:41,600
This is the type of money you
need to break these new artists.

993
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:44,636
Look, Man, that sounds good,
but me and Nuke,

994
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,472
we got something going right now.

995
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,841
Look, we're staying at the
Georgian Terrace Downtown.

996
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,610
If you want to do some business,
just call.

997
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:53,812
Thank you for your time.

998
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,321
Doc, all I'm saying is,
if you can get Louie

999
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:04,290
to stop tearing through my
club every week,

1000
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:07,459
I can build up a profit and
cut you in.

1001
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,328
Cut me in?

1002
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:13,365
How you gonna cut me in with
shit that's already mine?

1003
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,633
21!

1004
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,634
Ah, God.

1005
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,903
Whoo! Bam!

1006
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,571
Ah-ha!

1007
00:37:19,605 --> 00:37:21,573
Man, how about your baby mama?

1008
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:24,343
She good for dropping out so
I can see them fog light at night.

1009
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,514
Yeah, I'ma buy you a haircut

1010
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,048
when I win the rest of y'all money.

1011
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,919
Tell you straight, you look like
Baby Jesus right now.

1012
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,588
Had all that with that
college jewelry on.

1013
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:37,623
I got you too.

1014
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,525
Yeah, I got you.

1015
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,792
Taking all y'all money.

1016
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:43,862
Taking all y'all total money.

1017
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,965
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1018
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,401
Please, Doc, just give me the
time to rebuild my profits,

1019
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,570
maybe rebuild my club.

1020
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,539
Give me the time.

1021
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,674
5 point, that's my shit, Homey.

1022
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,075
I'm right now.

1023
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,744
Just me some time to build up
a profit.

1024
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,446
16! Ooh!

1025
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,780
Ooh!

1026
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:04,383
Ha-ha, fuckers!

1027
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:09,455
Put down, Man.

1028
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,056
Put my card on.

1029
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,792
No, look, look, look, look,
look, Doc.

1030
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:14,793
Count the cards, Man.

1031
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:16,395
Man, my child support due.

1032
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:18,063
Man, didn't he say we were dropping?

1033
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,531
I ain't got time for this.

1034
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,899
Please, Doc,
I just need the time.

1035
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,401
Can't you see I'm down to nothing?

1036
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,035
All right, kids can wait.

1037
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:28,407
Hey, Man, what's up with that
pay, though, Man?

1038
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,075
Fuck this, Man.
Good luck.

1039
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,444
You be in a week, now.

1040
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,112
Hey, My Man..
I'm busy, Man.

1041
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,447
Goddamn, Man.

1042
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:36,948
Ya'll need a better ticket, Man.

1043
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,650
Ticket to wherever.

1044
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:40,752
Man, my daddy told me, Man,

1045
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,754
you should always feed the wolves.

1046
00:38:42,788 --> 00:38:45,357
Hey, Man, it is what it is.

1047
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:48,059
The wolves got to eat what
they kill around here.

1048
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:49,695
Nothing to 'em, though.

1049
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,830
Hey, Man, that ticket it is
what it is, Man.

1050
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,131
Hold on.

1051
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,500
I just dropped 16.

1052
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:55,801
You gonna drop on me?

1053
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,369
I thought we were talking that.

1054
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:58,870

1055
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,739
About in the town with that
boy Zaytoven.

1056
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,709
You ain't gonna do shit?

1057
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,612
I got something for Nuke..
Him and Zaytoven.

1058
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,480
I told you not to trust that
little nigga

1059
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:11,149
the first time he came in the office.

1060
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,685
Got something for Zay.

1061
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,395
No, I'm still rocking with you.

1062
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,764
Listen, we gonna be here any minute.

1063
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,098
All I got to do..

1064
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,868
Hey, Bro,

1065
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,670
What's up?

1066
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,841

00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,409

1071
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,894
Listen..

1072
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,063
Man, take them motherfucking
shades off in here, Man.

1073
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:59,731
My bad, Doc.

1074
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:02,501
Man, I know it's been a
minute, Bro.

1075
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:03,935
I apologize.

1076
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:05,671
Well, aren't you the typical
nigga, Man?

1077
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,206
You come to my office with
all that,

1078
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,675

1079
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,643

1080
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:13,979

motherfucking years.

1081
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,581
No, Doc.
No, listen, Man.

1082
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,483
Every.. Dude,
let me just be real with you.

1083
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,084
Ever since you plugged that
Gucci shit, Bro,

1084
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,519
the shit went haywire.

1085
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,020
When them niggas did that
record, Bro,

1086
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,755
I didn't expect for it to
blow up like that.

1087
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,557
Zay didn't expect for it to
blow up like that.

1088
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:28,760
Shut the fuck up!
Yeah, Bitch.

1089
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,462
Hmm.

1090
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:32,564
Hey, Man, let's get this
business secure, Man.

1091
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,766
You remember this shit here?

1092
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,034
Came off with all that.

1093
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,903
Your word is shit.

1094
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,805
You got 48 hours to get that
shit signed,

1095
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,673

little nigger.

1096
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,041
Doc, listen, I ain't got..

1097
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,010
Man, get the fuck out of my
car, Man.

00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:46,044
Doc, it ain't got to..

1099
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,546
Fuck all that.

1100
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:55,554

00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:58,590
Wait, done sound good.

00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,625
That's the one.

1103
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,828
Ooh, uh.

1104
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:04,095
♪ White girl, white girl ♪

1105
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,831
Shit, what you talking about?

1106
00:41:05,864 --> 00:41:07,999
Shit, I get out.. I get out
of work in about an hour.

1107
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,668
Try to see you.

1108
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,603
Matter of fact, what's up
with your girl, Man?

1109
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:12,971
She look nice.

1110
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,239
That's what I'm trying to get at.

1111
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,707
Patchwerk Studios.

1112
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:17,609
Zaytoven.
Is Zaytoven in there?

1113
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:24,249
Is Zaytoven here?

1114
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:25,651
Yeah, Man.
Who are you?

1115
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,652
Nuke.
Nuke?

1116
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:27,819
Yeah.

1117
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,054
Calm down, Nuke.
I got you, Man.

1118
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,622
Just go through the door right there.

1119
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,291
Appreciate it, Bro.

1120
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:38,864
Motherfucker.
He about to blow up and shit.

1121
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,313

And who is all these people, Bro?

1125
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,852
Bro, chill out.
Relax, Man.

1126
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:02,821
I've been here for five days, Man.

1127
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:03,955
Golly.

1128
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,323
Had to fly to New York.

1129
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,726
For what, Dude?
What's going on?

1130
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,294
I got some good news, Boy.

1131
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:11,162
Well, good,
'cause I got some fucked-up news.

1132
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,031
Let me holler at you for a

1133
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,966

1134
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,835
Man, this gonna be hell, Cuz.

1135
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,236
God damn.

1136
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,805
What up?

1137
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:21,707
Nigga don't know when we winnin'.

1138
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,341
Look, Man, check it out, Bro.

1139
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:27,145
I just did a deal, Nigga,
with covert and covert.

1140
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:28,947
How you love that?

1141
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,616
No, you didn't.
Think about that.

1142
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:31,983
What you mean?
You ain't really listening.

1143
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:37,589
These fools,
they gave me $1.5 million.

1144
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:38,724
Come on, now.

1145
00:42:38,757 --> 00:42:39,725
Talk to me.

1146
00:42:39,758 --> 00:42:42,060
God. What?

1147
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,629
That ain't even it.

1148
00:42:43,662 --> 00:42:44,963
You know Ultra, right?

1149
00:42:44,996 --> 00:42:48,099
These fools, they gave me
another $700,000

1150
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,168
for just 20% of my publishing.

1151
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,203
Boy, we about to eat so good.

1152
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,204
Come on, now.

1153
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:54,773
Hold on, Zay.

1154
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,775
You doing all these deals
without me, Cuz?

1155
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,109
What you mean, Bro?

1156
00:42:58,143 --> 00:42:59,845
This what you should've been doing.

1157
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:02,047
You know, you out here looking
for new talent, Man.

1158
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,082
Your focus should've been on
me, Bro.

1159
00:43:04,115 --> 00:43:05,350
This is it right here.

1160
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,085
You know what?

1161
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,954
I knew when you got a taste
of some money, Nigga,

1162
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:09,955
you was gonna change.

1163
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,189
You ain't the same, Zay.

1164
00:43:11,222 --> 00:43:12,190
You ain't Dude.

1165
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,992
Man, what you mean, Bro?

1166
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:15,661
Nigga, we finally on.

1167
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,162
What's wrong with you?

1168
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,797
Zy, no, I'm not.

1169
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,998
Listen, Man.

1170
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,266
I signed a contract, Man.

1171
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,934
I forged your name with the
Doc, Dude.

1172
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,370
You owe 50% publishing to Doc, Dude.

1173
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:26,872
You think he told him yet?

1174
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:29,340
I doubt it.

1175
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,909
Nigger, you did what?

1176
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,243
Come on, Bro.

1177
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,145
Nigga, you signed my
publishing over?

1178
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,213
What's wrong with you?

1179
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:36,882
Zay, everything okay?

1180
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,416
Hey, Nuke, I'm Ted Poker.
Nice to meet you.

1181
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,185
Listen, Bro,

1182
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:43,288
I ain't sign no 50% of
publishing to nobody, Bro.

1183
00:43:43,321 --> 00:43:44,923
I told that nigga, but I'm straight.

1184
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,792
I don't need it.

1185
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49,661
Dude, remember you told me,
"Send them beats to Buddy," Man?

1186
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,029
Well, I did.

1187
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,363
But I sent 'em to Gucci too, Man,

1188
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,099
and that was through Doc.

1189
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:55,934
Doc got you the so icy
situation, Dude.

1190
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,169
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that, Bro.

1191
00:43:58,203 --> 00:44:00,305
You said that you sent that
nigga the beat, Bro.

1192
00:44:00,338 --> 00:44:02,307
It was you the one did that, Man.

1193
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,943
I don't care nothing 'bout none
of no street promises you made

1194
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,311
to this other nigga, Bro.

1195
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:08,847
It's Zaytoven.
This beat is my music.

1196
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,316
It's not that easy, Cuz.
This is Street Nigga, Man.

1197
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,418
Look, yeah,
it ain't that easy for you

1198
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:15,687
'cause you done got tied in
with this clown.

1199
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,689
I don't care nothing about
none of that, Bro.

1200
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:20,091
This is my music I'm rocking.
I don't need that. For real.

1201
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,359
So wait a minute, Cuz.

1202
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,194
You gonna say "Fuck Me" like that?

1203
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,396
You gonna leave me out?
He's talkin' of killing me, Cuz.

1204
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,033
Check this. Joe.
Joe, meet Nuke.

1205
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,367
Nuke, meet Joe.

1206
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,069
This is my new management.

1207
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:33,004
How do you feel to that?

1208
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,105
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1209
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,340
Man, let me go.

1210
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:38,309
Fuck you!
Fuck you, Zaytoven!

1211
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,845
Go get your mind right.

1212
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,047
You can't be acting that over here.

1213
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,751
Mr. Willy Pastor Brookes,

1214
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:49,120
That service today was incredible.

1215
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,388
Well, listen, Joey, you know,

1216
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,857
It was always good to see you, Man.

1217
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,124
When I looked out in the audience,

1218
00:44:53,158 --> 00:44:54,960
I seen you sitting out there, Man,

1219
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,863
I was blessed, Man, to see you
In the church today, Man.

1220
00:44:57,896 --> 00:44:59,430
Appreciate you stopping by.

1221
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:01,800
Also, Man, appreciate you
finding that your blessing.

1222
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:04,269
I mean, I really felt uplifted today,

1223
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:08,740
And I just want to say..
Just amazing with time.

1224
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:10,508
Well, Man, you know,
we trying to help the church

1225
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,878
and make sure everybody's filled
with the spirit of god.

1226
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:15,046
Trying to make a way for
these children, Man,

1227
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,315
to help the young folk, Man,
with God's spirit.

1228
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,384
And that's what I was feeling
up there.

1229
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:22,453
The great thing about it was,
when I saw you up there talking,

1230
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:27,225
it just really took me back to
the time when we was coming up,

1231
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:29,327
and I didn't know then,
but I see it now,

1232
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,497
what you did for me and the
kids in the area,

1233
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,065
and that's what's really important.

1234
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,333
Yeah.

1235
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:36,534
Hey, Zay.
What's going on, Man?

1236
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,836
Yeah, that's my nephew, Man.

1237
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,237
Come and meet my nephew, Man.

1238
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,972
Hey, what's going on, Man?
Good to see you.

1239
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,473
Haven't seen you in a couple
months, Man.

1240
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:44,042
Good to see you, Man.
Good to see you.

1241
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,310
Come on. Give him a seat.

1242
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,945
You know, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1243
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,546
I got to go anyway.
You take care of yourself.

1244
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,115
Enjoy your nephew.

1245
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:51,783
You know, Joey, I'll tell you, Man,

1246
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,318
Sit down for a minute, Man?

1247
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:55,053
Yeah, Man.

1248
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,055
This is my nephew I've been
telling you about, Man.

1249
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,256
Yeah.

1250
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,258
Yeah, come on have a seat, Man.

1251
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,292
We're all family here, Man.

1252
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:02,828
Okay, cool, cool.

1253
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:05,330
Service was good.
We all right.

1254
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:08,533
Yeah, but listen, Xavier.

1255
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:10,368
This is Joey, Man.. Joey Davis.

1256
00:46:10,401 --> 00:46:13,571
Been going to church here
since he was a kid, Man.

1257
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,274
Listen, he's a good friend
of mine, you know?

1258
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,376
How is the music business?

1259
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,345
I mean, like, really, how is it?

1260
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:23,481
The music business..
Uh, it's ugly,

1261
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,216
But, you know, it's fair, I guess.

1262
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,885
Mm-hmm.

1263
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:29,354
Well, the reason why I'm
bringing this up..

1264
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:32,991
And no disrespect to you,
Mr. Willy Pastor..

1265
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:37,829
Is, I have an artist that I've
been working with for a while,

1266
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:39,865
and maybe the next time you're
in town,

1267
00:46:39,898 --> 00:46:41,299
maybe we can get together and
we can..

1268
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,968
You know, you can work with her.

1269
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:45,136
Okay, I didn't know you was
into music.

1270
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,572
Probably one of his mistress, Man.

1271
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:49,507
Yeah, you know,
I don't care about all that.

1272
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,910
You know, I'm not really into music.

1273
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:56,181
You can really say I'm into..
I'm into many things.

1274
00:46:56,214 --> 00:47:02,087
But I'm really here to help
the world, if you need me.

1275
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,088
Oh, okay.

1276
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:04,956
Well, you know,

1277
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,958
they say he's one of the most
feared man in Atlanta,

1278
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,259
so you can look at how he's dressed,

1279
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,260
and I don't believe it.

1280
00:47:09,294 --> 00:47:10,295
Oh, come on, Willy.

1281
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,163
This is how he dresses, Man.

1282
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:14,332
Well, you know, the streets
is just smoke and mirrors,

1283
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:16,034
know what I'm saying?

1284
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,136
But what I would like, Zay,
is that you take my card

1285
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,504
and stay in touch with me,

1286
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:22,040
and the next time you're in
town, Zay,

1287
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,977
and if there's anything that
you need.. Anything..

1288
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:28,279
You make sure to look me up
and call me on that number,

1289
00:47:28,313 --> 00:47:29,414
all right?

1290
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:31,016
'Cause I make magic happen.

1291
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,150
That's what I do.

1292
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,151
Okay.
Okay?

1293
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:34,452
And may God bless you guys.

1294
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,087
All right, Man.
Take care of yourself.

1295
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:37,555
Hey, Joey, any time, Man.

1296
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,891
Take care of yourself.
Hey, tell the wife I said hello.

1297
00:47:39,925 --> 00:47:41,226
I sure will, Man.
okay, cool.

1298
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:42,660
Take care, Young Man.
All right, Man.

1299
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,163
All right.

1300
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:47,232
So what's going on, huh?
Hey, what's going on, Zay?

1301
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:49,000
What's you up to, Man?
What's you up to, Man?

1302
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,201
Oh, ain't nothing to it, Man.

1303
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,436
How you doing?
You looking good.

1304
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:53,038
I ain't seen you in a while.

1305
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,605
Been a minute since I've seen
you, Man.

1306
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,607
You doing all right?
Yeah, I'm doing pretty good.

1307
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,276
How's life treating you, Man?

1308
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,478
You know, it's got its ups
and downs.

1309
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,679
Can't complain.
I'm here.

1310
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,081
Okay, well, listen, Man.

1311
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,349
Just to let you know, Man,

1312
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,017
that young man right there,
Man, Joey,

1313
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:08,486
just donated about 50 grand
to the church, Man.

1314
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,587
$50,000?
Yeah, $50,000.

1315
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,389
What'd he do?

1316
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,358
That's gonna help me pay off
this building, Man.

1317
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,193
$50,000.
What he do?

1318
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,262
Oh, you know, Man, don't worry
about what he do, Man.

1319
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:19,597
Just, you know, thank God
for him

1320
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,132
and you keep him in prayer, Man,

1321
00:48:21,166 --> 00:48:22,500
'Cause, you know, I ain't no..

1322
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,102
I'm not gonna judge him, Man.

1323
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:25,336
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

1324
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:26,504
But he's a good person, Man.

1325
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:27,939
Okay.

1326
00:48:27,973 --> 00:48:29,407
But let me ask you a question, Man.

1327
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,142
I haven't seen you in a while
in the church.

1328
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:32,410
How you been doing, Man?

1329
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:33,411
How's everything going?

1330
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:35,146
Are you happy?

1331
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,648
No, not really, you know.

1332
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:41,486
Man, this music business ain't
what I thought it was gonna be.

1333
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,689
Man, me and my cousin just
fell out.

1334
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:47,625
Who, you and Nuke?

1335
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:50,195
Man, that Batman and Robin
there, Bro.

1336
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:51,596
All right, listen.

1337
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:54,532
Nuke got me in a bind with
some guy,

1338
00:48:54,565 --> 00:49:00,438
and I just found out that he's
the reason for my success,

1339
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,641
and I didn't even want the
guy's help.

1340
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:05,410
Well, let me give you some
advice, Xavier.

1341
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,012
You know, one thing about it, Man,

1342
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:10,348
God send people in your life
for a reason,

1343
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:13,084
and a lot of times, we don't understand,

1344
00:49:13,118 --> 00:49:16,121
but just know that God's
working on your behalf,

1345
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:18,256
to help you with your success.

1346
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:19,690
So let it soak in.

1347
00:49:19,724 --> 00:49:21,526
Don't get too emotional.

1348
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,129
Just ride that wave, Man.

1349
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,630
Ride that wave, Man.

1350
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:29,400
Yeah, Man, but it just seem
like everybody around,

1351
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:31,569
they want something from you.

1352
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:37,208
It's like, the bigger you get,
the more alone you feel.

1353
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:38,409
You know what?

1354
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,278
And that's true,

1355
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:44,115
Because most black successful people

1356
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:45,683
have to isolate themself.

1357
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,418
You know why?

1358
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:51,522
Because the people that they
around are always in need,

1359
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:53,391
always in need.

1360
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:58,263
But you got to remember that
we can't save the world.

1361
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:00,198
You and I can't save the world.

1362
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:03,168
We can only change the outlook
on the world.

1363
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:06,171
You know, so how we do that?

1364
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:08,673
Well, Zay, it's just like, in time,

1365
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,608
you're gonna figure that out.

1366
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:12,277
But just know this:

1367
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:17,048
That money and success,
with no love,

1368
00:50:17,082 --> 00:50:19,450
has no real value.

1369
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:21,819
I want you to understand that.

1370
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,421
And to let you know too, Man,

1371
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,156
that I really, really love you.

1372
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,557
I love you too.

1373
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,393
All right, thanks.
Thanks for your help, Man.

1374
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:29,560
No problem, Man.

1375
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:30,561
All right.
All right.

1376
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:34,432
I'll see you.

1377
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,567
Goddamn mother fucker.
I didn't take a fucking thing!

1378
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,203
Goddamn it.

1379
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,238
I didn't take a fucking thing
from you!

1380
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,140
I helped you with fucking billions.

1381
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:44,142
I didn't take a fucking thing,
not a fucking dime,

1382
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:45,276
You fucking asshole!

1383
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,511
No!

1384
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:56,254
Oh!

1385
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,855
I didn't do a fucking thing wrong!

1386
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,290

Man, I don't need this shit, Man.

1730
01:04:27,932 --> 01:04:29,199
What's up?
What's going on, Man?

1731
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,901
So what happened with that deal, Man?

1732
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:33,203
Look, Man, I don't know what
you and Nuke..

1733
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:34,504
You know what I mean..
Got going on.

1734
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:36,073
Nuke made a deal.

1735
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:37,942
I don't know what y'all had
going on.

1736
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:40,177
But you were there when the
contract was signed, My Nigga.

1737
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,678
When I made the call, you were there.

1738
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,914
So you knew what was going on.
What the fuck you mean?

1739
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:45,415
Man, I finally found out what happened.

1740
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:47,484
He came and told me that he
signed my publishing over.

1741
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:48,685
You know, I wouldn't do that.

1742
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,254
That ain't what I wanted to do.

1743
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:52,189
I'll tell you what.

1744
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:53,590
I got something in the car
for you

1745
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,925
I want to show you.

1746
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,961
Show you how I rock.

1747
01:04:56,994 --> 01:05:01,198
Ha, oh, you on the Ridge.
You being a man now, huh?

1748
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:03,033
Hey, Man,
where you got me going, Bro?

1749
01:05:03,067 --> 01:05:06,370
I ain't got time to be doing
this all day.

1750
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,438
That bitch move. You got
business to take care of.

1751
01:05:08,472 --> 01:05:10,107
Man, you need to call Nuke,
whatever..

1752
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,608
You got business to take care
of, Bro.

1753
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:13,443
I'm talking about this
business right here.

1754
01:05:13,477 --> 01:05:16,613
You got business to take care
of, Homey.

1755
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:17,714
And what's this?

1756
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,949
This don't mean nothing.

1757
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:20,350
I didn't sign this.

1758
01:05:20,384 --> 01:05:21,718
Nuke signed this, Bro.

1759
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:23,353
I ain't never put my name
on none of this.

1760
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:25,222
Your signature on this shit.

1761
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,357
Nah, I ain't never even signed
no paperwork with Nuke.

1762
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:28,692
So this don't mean nothing.

1763
01:05:28,725 --> 01:05:30,394
Now, look, this what I can do.

1764
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,496
I can give you $15,000.

1765
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,498
And I'll give you that for
just making a phone call.

1766
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,400
That's more money you ever
made for a phone call.

1767
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,202
$15,000.
This is $15,000.

1768
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:40,737
Well, I'll tell you what I'ma
do for you.

1769
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,272
Got love for your boy Nuke?

1770
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:44,008
What that mean?

1771
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:54,318
150 to get that bitch up out
of the trunk.

1772
01:05:57,687 --> 01:06:00,057
Man, I'm so motherfucking fly,
I got the movies,

1773
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,725
and I got the motherfuckers
to count on.

1774
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:04,294
I'm just too cold at this shit.

1775
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:05,729
I'm the fliest Tiger Woods.

1776
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:09,333
Fuck Tiger Woods.

1777
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:10,467
Talk this shit.

1778
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,535
Yes, Sir.

1779
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:16,573
What the fuck was that?

1780
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:18,175
I don't know.
You tell me.

1781
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,010
That was a losing shot.
Ugly as hell.

1782
01:06:20,044 --> 01:06:22,079
That's what that was.
That's exactly what that was.

1783
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:23,313
Let's see what you got, George.

1784
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:25,415
Come on, George.
$1,000 a ball.

1785
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,084
Let's get ready to ball.

1786
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,054
Let me show you what $1,000
looks like.

1787
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:31,221
Okay, show me, George.

1788
01:06:31,255 --> 01:06:32,222
Here we go.

1789
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:34,024
Show me.

1790
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,763
Cha-ching, Dog.

1791
01:06:39,796 --> 01:06:42,266
Okay. All right, all right.
That was like money.

1792
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,168
Okay. All right. I hear you.
You got my respect.

1793
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:45,635
You needed that, Man.
Need that.

1794
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,504
Zay, what's going on?
What's going on, Joe?

1795
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:50,274
My award-winning producer.

1796
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:52,276
Zay, this is George Jr.

1797
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,410
Hey, George.
How you doing?

1798
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:54,711
George is a real estate tycoon.

1799
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,513
Pop's running for senator.

1800
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:58,548
Hopefully he'll get elected
in about three weeks.

1801
01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:00,350
And this is my man honest.

1802
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,252
Honest, how you.. How you..

1803
01:07:02,286 --> 01:07:03,720
Hey, hold on, Man.
I know you.

1804
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:05,255
You sold me a house.

1805
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:07,257
You do look a little familiar.

1806
01:07:07,291 --> 01:07:09,093
However, I only sell houses

1807
01:07:09,126 --> 01:07:12,796
On tuesdays between the hours
9:00 and 11:00,

1808
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,631
And this ain't no time
like that, though, Dog.

1809
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:15,832
He's funny always.

1810
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,267
George, can you take that for me?

1811
01:07:17,301 --> 01:07:18,735
Yes.

1812
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:20,570
Let me talk to you in my
office over here, Zay.

1813
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:22,439
So how is golfing going for
you, Man?

1814
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,441
How's this game.. I ain't never
tried to play this.

1815
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,410
Hey, you know, I just do this
just to stay in shape

1816
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:28,678
and stay in touch with the
locals, you know?

1817
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,447
But let me explain something
to you.

1818
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:37,787
How you gonna handle the
situation with Doc?

1819
01:07:39,123 --> 01:07:40,457
Doc?

1820
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,126
Man, who told you about that situation?

1821
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,160
Listen to me, Zay.

1822
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:45,495
I'm a street nigger, Zay.

1823
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:47,231
A street nigger.

1824
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:50,767
I hear everything that's
going on in the streets.

1825
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,738
So how you gonna handle this
with Doc?

1826
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:56,840
Man, I don't even know.

1827
01:07:56,873 --> 01:07:58,508
Feel me, Bro.

1828
01:07:58,542 --> 01:08:00,777
Dude done snatch my cousin up.

1829
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,714
I'm tell you what you're
gonna do, Zay.

1830
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:06,483
You gonna pay the man.

1831
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:07,651
Huh?

1832
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,586
It's all about who you paying.

1833
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:13,290
Doc's banker, Carl Weather,
is a personal friend of mine.

1834
01:08:13,323 --> 01:08:14,658
What you gonna do is

1835
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:20,764
that you gonna take to Carl
Weather $25,000.

1836
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:22,466
Well, that's Doc's banker.

1837
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:26,770
Why would I take him $25,000
and he works for him?

1838
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:29,306
Sponge up, Young Nigga.

1839
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:32,176
Life's about respecting the check,

1840
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:33,910
and this situation is about respect.

1841
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:36,480
Nobody gives a fuck about Doc.

1842
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:38,815
Our job is, we gonna kill the head,

1843
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,417
and the body shall die.

1844
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:44,554
You gonna take Carl $25,000,

1845
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:46,356
and we'll deal with you tomorrow.

1846
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,357
All right?

1847
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:48,425
I'll take it from here.

1848
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,593
All right.
All right?

1849
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:50,827
All right, thanks, Man.
Okay.

1850
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,296
All right, tee up, George.

1851
01:08:52,329 --> 01:08:53,597
$1,000 in the hole, Motherfucker.

1852
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:55,165
I'm back in the game.

1853
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:56,866
Joey-Zizzle's in the building, Baby.

1854
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:02,406
Yes, this is Carl.

1855
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:04,774
Ah, Zaytoven.

1856
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:07,177
I've been expecting you.

1857
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:08,412
Yes.

1858
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,484
Hold on.

1859
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:15,485
Hey, good seeing you, Zay.

1860
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:16,820
Good seeing you.

1861
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,455
Got something?
Excellent. Thank you.

1862
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:19,956
You're a good man, Good Man.

1863
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,891
Thank you, Sir.
Yeah, I'm back. Yeah.

1864
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:32,302
Hey, yo, Doc.

1865
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:33,703
Zaytoven.

1866
01:09:33,737 --> 01:09:36,340
I got your money.

1867
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:39,909
Warehouse, 9:00.

1868
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:41,245
Yeah.

1869
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,491
Doc, hold on, Man.
What's up, Bro?

1870
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:55,925
What's up with all these guns, Man?

1871
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:57,761
Fuck you mean, Nigga?

1872
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:00,630
What's on your mind?
Not gonna let you sneak me.

1873
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:02,866
Man, where my cousin at?

1874
01:10:02,899 --> 01:10:04,534
That's what I'm up here for.

1875
01:10:04,568 --> 01:10:06,470
You want to be strapped to
something, Nigga?

1876
01:10:06,503 --> 01:10:07,837
I ain't got no gun.

1877
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,973
Watch out, Bro.
I got your little money, though.

1878
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,775
Yeah, let me get that.
Man, hold on.

1879
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:15,479
Where my cousin at, though?
Where's Nuke at, Bro?

1880
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,713
Doc, stop playing, Man.

1881
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:19,015
Where's Nuke at?

1882
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,485
That bitch a'ight.

1883
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:24,388
Dropped him off in greater earlier.

1884
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:25,922
Nigga good.

1885
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,392
Doc, let me ask you something, Man.

1886
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,994
Was this really all worth it?

1887
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:32,662
Fuck yeah, it's worth it, Nigga.

1888
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:33,897
Don't play with my money.

1889
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,966
Nigga, I want money.

1890
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,338
None of this was yours in the
first place.

1891
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:43,006
You know what?

1892
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:45,409
Nuke said you wasn't no street nigga.

1893
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:48,378
I ain't never said I was no
street nigga.

1894
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:50,280
But I ain't no sucker, either.

1895
01:10:50,314 --> 01:10:53,750
You don't understand street
codes or ethics, My Nigga.

1896
01:10:53,783 --> 01:10:55,552
Real niggas make sure they
people eat,

1897
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:59,022
not run to Hollywood on their
sucker shit, Homey.

1898
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,658
I ain't never agreed to do no
deal with you,

1899
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:03,793
but you found a way to get in
my pockets anyway.

1900
01:11:03,827 --> 01:11:06,463
Y'all niggas came to my
motherfucking office,

1901
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:07,897
Dead-ass broke,

1902
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,766
looking for a motherfucking
handout or favor.

1903
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:11,401
I did the phone call.

1904
01:11:11,435 --> 01:11:13,403
Now you bitching about paying me
my money, Nigger?

1905
01:11:13,437 --> 01:11:14,538
What's happening?

1906
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:16,473
But you ain't god.

1907
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,842
You don't control my career.

1908
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,745
You never have, and you never will.

1909
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,547
I'm your God, Nigger.

1910
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,415
I made you.

1911
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,651
Look, Doc,
It's people like you, Bro,

1912
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:31,855
That get in the industry
and contaminate it,

1913
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,359
bring your street codes
and street ties in,

1914
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:36,893
and mess it up for a nigga
like me

1915
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:38,895
that really got a heart for
this music,

1916
01:11:38,928 --> 01:11:40,964
that want to make a living
doing this.

1917
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,099
Hey, Man, I ain't invent this
game, My Nigga.

1918
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,402
I just play the shit the "G" way.

1919
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:47,737
Something you need to learn,
Little Nigga.

1920
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,440
Fuck out of my office, Nigga.

1921
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,075
Fuck, Boy.

1922
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,045
Hmm.

1923
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:57,947
Bro, you ain't tough.

1924
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:00,750
Matter of fact, you a joke.

1925
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:05,355
And the next time you put your
hands on my family...

1926
01:12:05,389 --> 01:12:07,524
Go find your piano or something, Boy.

1927
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:09,593
Go make a beat.
Yo.

1928
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:12,829
Go find a keyboard or some
fuck, Boy.

1929
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:14,030
You too goon for your own good.

1930
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,732
What?

1931
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:18,968
You gonna get what you're
asking for, Boy.

1932
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:21,471
Time to take your bitch-ass
home, Nigga.

1933
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:24,408
This nigga asking for it, Man.

1934
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:25,875
You're begging for it, Bro.

1935
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:28,512
This check better be right too.
Fuck, Nigga.

1936
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:31,748
Yeah, it's all there,
with an extra 50.

1937
01:12:31,781 --> 01:12:33,082
Extra 50?

1938
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,951
What, you tipping now, Nigga?

1939
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:37,554
Little motherfucker's tripping, Nigga.

1940
01:12:37,587 --> 01:12:39,122
What the 200 for, Zay?

1941
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,625
Man, shoot this nigga, Man.

1942
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:43,927
What the 200 for, Zay?

1943
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,962
Man, shoot this motherfucker, Man.

1944
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,764
What the 200 for, Zay?

1945
01:12:47,797 --> 01:12:48,898
100 apiece.

1946
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:02,078
Let's go.

1947
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:16,993
Gentlemen, Gentlemen,
How we doing?

1948
01:13:17,026 --> 01:13:18,528
What's up, Zay?

1949
01:13:18,562 --> 01:13:19,896
Gentlemen, what's up?
How are you?

1950
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:20,964
I'm doing good.

1951
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:23,667
Today's a great day.

1952
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:26,002
George, who I introduced you to..

1953
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:27,604
Pop's won the senate,

1954
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,105
so now we gonna get our permits

1955
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:31,074
and get a lot of things going
around in the city.

1956
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:32,576
It's just a great day.

1957
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,711
That's great.

1958
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,613
That's great.

1959
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:38,515
Yeah, so listen...

1960
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:45,054
I don't want you to worry
about that thing.

1961
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:46,656
Look at me.

1962
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48,592
I don't want you to worry
about the thing.

1963
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:51,461
Carl, tell him.

1964
01:13:51,495 --> 01:13:53,162
You did the streets a great favor.

1965
01:13:53,196 --> 01:13:55,599
With that fucking animal gone,

1966
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:57,801
everybody eats, so they say,

1967
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:02,138
which means more clients for me.

1968
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,140
Tell him about the police too.

1969
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,942
It's all taken care of.

1970
01:14:05,975 --> 01:14:07,511
Don't worry.

1971
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,946
Spoke with the D.E.A. Today.

1972
01:14:09,979 --> 01:14:12,982
Demarco Pierre, A.K.A. Doc.

1973
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:15,018
Case closed.

1974
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:17,654
Drug deal gone bad.

1975
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:18,922
That's good news.

1976
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:22,125
So listen to me.

1977
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:24,561
You in a different league now.

1978
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:26,663
Put your life back on track.

1979
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:27,864
I don't want you to fuck this up.

1980
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:29,232
You hear me?

1981
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:31,034
So you just go ahead and do
great music,

1982
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:33,570
and you let us handle the rest,
all right?

1983
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:34,638
Yeah, you know what, Joey?

1984
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:36,239
I want to appreciate you, Man.

1985
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:38,508
I want to thank you for
everything you've done for me,

1986
01:14:38,542 --> 01:14:39,543
from the bottom of my heart.

1987
01:14:39,576 --> 01:14:42,045
It means a lot to me.

1988
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:45,882
So if there's anything that
I can do for you,

1989
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:47,250
Let me know.

1990
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:49,986
And I appreciate that, but money-wise,

1991
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:52,656
you can do nothing for me.

1992
01:14:52,689 --> 01:14:54,524
He speaks the truth.

1993
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:58,027
Doc had over $5 million
stashed away in a bank account

1994
01:14:58,061 --> 01:14:59,729
in the Cayman Islands.

1995
01:14:59,763 --> 01:15:04,534
Managed exclusively by his banker,

1996
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:06,570
Me.

1997
01:15:06,603 --> 01:15:09,739
And what's so great about it..
This is how the street works..

1998
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:11,708
1/3 of that is going back to me.

1999
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:15,278
You know that I'm a hustler, okay?

2000
01:15:15,311 --> 01:15:16,646
Well...

2001
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:17,747
It's the way of the world.

2002
01:15:17,781 --> 01:15:19,148
Trust us.

2003
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,117
Well, what about the other 25?

2004
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:22,919
The other 25..
I'm gonna handle that.

2005
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,654
That's the money I'm going to use

2006
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,823
to really trick off in Vegas.

2007
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:30,694
Zay, why don't you join us there?

2008
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:32,328
Ah, no, Man.
I can't.

2009
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,830
Nah, I can't do it, Man.

2010
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:36,332
I got some other stuff I got
to handle.

2011
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,067
Well, we would love to have you.

2012
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:41,070
So other than that,
go get your life together, Man,

2013
01:15:41,104 --> 01:15:42,338
and when you see me around,

2014
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,040
let's just have..

2015
01:15:44,073 --> 01:15:46,042
You know, get together and
have a drink, all right?

2016
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:47,577
All right, Man.
Wish you the best.

2017
01:15:47,611 --> 01:15:51,981
Thank you.
Thank you.

2018
01:15:52,015 --> 01:15:54,283
You know, he's coming through.
Let's make sure of that.

2019
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:58,187
Good day, Sir.

2020
01:15:58,221 --> 01:15:59,589
Thank you.

2021
01:16:02,692 --> 01:16:06,362
Cuz, who you going up there
to meet, Man?

2022
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,198
Man, look, don't worry about that.

2023
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:10,266
Here.

2024
01:16:10,299 --> 01:16:12,268
What's this?

2025
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,370
That's your split

2026
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,073
For the covert and covert
management deal

2027
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:22,646
and the Ultra money.

2028
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:24,881
That mean I'm still your
manager, right?

2029
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,683
No.

2030
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:28,818
But you could be my road
manager, Man,

2031
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:31,020
if you slowed down.

2032
01:16:31,054 --> 01:16:32,889
You know something, Zay?

2033
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,759
You never told me how Doc got
killed, Man.

2034
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:39,796
You have something to do with
this nigger getting killed, Zay?

2035
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,064
It's understood.

2036
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,834
Don't got to be explained.

2037
01:16:44,868 --> 01:16:46,836
You a cold motherfucker, Zay.

2038
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:50,106
Hey, we Birds Of A Feather, right?

2039
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:53,242
1,000.
