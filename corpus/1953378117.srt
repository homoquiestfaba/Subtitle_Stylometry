1
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,178
I wish you back into the lamp!

2
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,480
I wish you into the lamp!

3
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,724
I think this is it.

4
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,292
Are you sure?

5
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,995
Well, you can
never be sure.

6
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,564
Great. It's intact.

7
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,400
Aladdin.

8
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,668
It's sealed.

9
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,271
That means there's something
valuable inside.

10
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,472
Ready?

11
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,751
There's nothing--
Move. Move.

12
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,061
I found something.

13
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,996
What is it?

14
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:52,297
Let's see.

15
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,803
Who tied this?

16
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,410
What, all this work
for a book?

17
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:08,547
Must be worth something
if he was buried with it.

18
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,050
"Rage hums its deadly song."

19
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,952
Ahh! There's nothing!

20
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,121
I'll take this to Shahira.

21
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:17,589
He sometimes buys old books.

22
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,024
He's a thief.

23
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:22,494
Maybe so.
But his money spends the same.

24
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,797
I get half.

25
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,433
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

26
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,903
All right, fine.

27
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,879
Move.

28
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,738
What was that?

29
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,073
The guardian of the tomb.

30
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,809
Guarding what?

31
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,411
Let's go.

32
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,521
Finally.

33
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,827
You're late.
I'm not very happy about that.

34
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,963
It'll cost you more.

35
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,403
Go bargain with Shahira
without me. You'll do better.

36
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,771
Bad blood.

37
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,540
It's Shahira. Blood
has nothing to do with money.

38
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,010
- Except when it's his money.
- All right, wait here.

39
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,847
Shahira.

40
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,250
Aladdin. You have something
for me?

41
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,685
If there were any other buyer
in Vardana, I wouldn't be here.

42
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,454
But there isn't,
so we're here.

43
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,289
So your expedition
must have been profitable.

44
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,991
Show me.

45
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:09,528
Well, no jewels or gold
this time.

46
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,731
Only this.

47
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,517
Tsk. A stained,
moldy old book?

48
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,386
How am I gonna sell this?

49
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,854
Still,

50
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,622
I'm sure some poor scholar

51
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,724
would shell out
a few drachmas for this.

52
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,093
For curiosity's sake, of course.

53
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,830
Twenty.

54
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,532
Done.

55
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:52,370
Twenty gold coins
for a moldy, old book?

56
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,840
That must be some book.

57
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,575
It's a worthless antique.

58
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:59,044
But still, there are buyers.

59
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,179
I think I'll keep it.

60
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,949
- Aladdin, we had a deal.
- You had a deal.

61
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,750
I'll bring it back
when I finish with it.

62
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,085
I could do with a good read.

63
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:09,087
My offer might not be open then.

64
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:10,755
I'll take that chance.

65
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,826
Visma.

66
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,763
Find me Luca.

67
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,233
Don't bring him here to the
market. Bring him to my tent.

68
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,410
- Where's my cut?
- I didn't sell it.

69
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,645
What?

70
00:08:33,647 --> 00:08:35,647
Shahira agreed
to 20 gold pieces.

71
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,848
No bargaining. No haggling.

72
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,850
Twenty gold pieces?
Why didn't you take it?

73
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,852
Think about it. If he's willing
to pay what we wanted,

74
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,254
no questions asked,

75
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,422
this book must be the key
to something valuable.

76
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,825
All right,
then let me see the book.

77
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,293
Not here. Come on.

78
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,638
It seems to be the description
of a journey of sorts.

79
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,107
There's even a map
drawn inside the back cover.

80
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:04,476
You think it'll lead us
to treasure?

81
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,144
"Seekers seek.

82
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,813
"Granters grant.

83
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,882
"May the desires of your heart
be yours.

84
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,685
"The stones do keep,

85
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,687
the greatest treasure
lies in deep."

86
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,822
The stones.

87
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,691
The stones of Mustafa?

88
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,192
Mustafa?

89
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,796
Somebody went to a great deal
of trouble to hide this book

90
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,299
inside an obscure
sarcophagus hidden up a mountain

91
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,234
and guard it
with a two-headed serpent.

92
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,905
Wait, look, our markings.

93
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,847
"A lock for which four keys
are made.

94
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,050
Each one opens the door."

95
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,819
Khalil and Shifa
also bear these signs.

96
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,255
Why are our markings
in an ancient book?

97
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,290
I don't know.

98
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,460
I'm gonna
ask somebody who does.

99
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,463
If you think Khalil is going to
tell you, you're mistaken.

100
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:00,732
He won't talk
about his past or ours.

101
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,168
If that book has anything to do
with either, he won't tell you.

102
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,669
It's worth a try.

103
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,304
I'll meet up with you later.

104
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:08,640
Gather the men,
we're going treasure-hunting.

105
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,219
You're getting good, Shifa.

106
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:24,022
If I were that good,
you'd be the one pinned.

107
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:26,891
Well, I'm stronger than you
and I've been training longer.

108
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,330
- Where's Luca?
- Gathering men for an expedition.

109
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,765
- I'm going with you.
- No.

110
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:36,134
I fight better than Luca.
He drinks and gambles,

111
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,036
a woman just has to smile
for him to lose his head.

112
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:40,138
- He's reliable.
- I'm unreliable?

113
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,940
- You judge too harshly.
- You'll be sorry.

114
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,141
I'll be careful.

115
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,477
Aladdin. Welcome home.

116
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,945
Thank you, Khalil.

117
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,213
Was your search successful?

118
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,648
I'm not sure.

119
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,716
I had hoped to bring
you money for the orphans.

120
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,352
But I may have the chance
at something much bigger.

121
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,187
Something that could
actually put you and them

122
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,390
in a building that keeps the
warmth in and the rain out.

123
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,392
Well, come. Let's go inside.

124
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,037
You're coming with us.

125
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,198
Luca. Why didn't you
come with Aladdin earlier?

126
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,902
I wanted to see you alone

127
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,537
- To tell you the good news.
- Good.

128
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,238
I won a few coins,

129
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,374
I want to apply it
against the debt that I owe you.

130
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:52,410
Nice. Where is it?

131
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,212
- It's right there.
- Give it to me.

132
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,426
This doesn't even put a dent
in what you owe me!

133
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:10,261
I need a little more time.

134
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,896
I gave you more time,
Luca.

135
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,131
Your time is up.

136
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,532
I'm going to take your head

137
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,368
and put it on a pike
outside my tent as a warning.

138
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,170
Shahira, I will pay you.

139
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,606
- Take his head off.
- What--? No, wait.

140
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:23,208
No. Please.

141
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,743
No. Please don't kill me!

142
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,724
Burn this book.

143
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,427
Wipe it from your memory.

144
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,595
What?

145
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,263
Or throw it down the well.

146
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,232
Or bury it in the deepest part
of the forest

147
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,934
where no one
will ever find it again.

148
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,370
Why?

149
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,605
What is this?

150
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,807
Just this once, Aladdin.

151
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:57,342
Don't ask why.

152
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,543
Trust me.

153
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,812
Forget you ever saw this book
and this map.

154
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,046
Don't kill me. No!

155
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,249
Wait, wait, wait.

156
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:07,051
What could you possibly do
for me?

157
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,820
I'll do anything.

158
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,656
Anything?

159
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:12,857
I will do it.

160
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,661
There is something.

161
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:20,698
I can do it.
Please, just spare me.

162
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,868
You and Aladdin are close, yes?

163
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,338
Yes, we both grew up
in Khalil's orphanage.

164
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,673
He's like a brother
to me.

165
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,076
Would you betray
your own brother?

166
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,681
Would you?

167
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,087
No.

168
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,923
Aladdin,

169
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:47,859
I have never discouraged you
from seeking your fortune.

170
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:52,030
But this time I'm telling you,
don't go.

171
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,766
We're tied to this book,

172
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,835
you know what it is
and you're not saying.

173
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,471
Our marks.

174
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:05,844
Shifa, fire. Luca, earth.
You, water. Me, air.

175
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,379
If you wanna stop me
walking out of here right now,

176
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,281
then tell me what this means.

177
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,953
It's the dark arts, isn't it?

178
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,089
I know you still know them.

179
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:20,892
And I know you know
what this book is.

180
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,328
I don't practice them anymore.

181
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,631
The dark arts are history
and so is that book.

182
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,066
Leave it alone, Aladdin.

183
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:31,469
It may be history,
but it's my history.

184
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,671
Your history is here.

185
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,206
I have loved you as a son,

186
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,508
ever since they left you
on my doorstep.

187
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,677
And when Shifa and Luca
were abandoned,

188
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,413
I raised them
as my children too.

189
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:45,416
Which is why I am begging you,

190
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,118
forget about this book.

191
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,786
There are other treasures
to hunt.

192
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:52,624
A man with no treasure is poor
but he's still a man.

193
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,060
A man without a past is no man.

194
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,763
Aladdin,

195
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,200
some treasures are found
at too great a cost.

196
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,069
But at least they're found.

197
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:11,876
I'll do anything.

198
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,924
Take these talisman,

199
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,759
they have a special property.

200
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,529
This is what
you're going to do.

201
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:47,378
Aladdin, I'm going with you.

202
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,716
Stay with Khalil.

203
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,217
He needs you here.

204
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,363
Aah!

205
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,650
Hey, it's good. It's for me?

206
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,885
- No.
- Hey.

207
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,554
Start packing.

208
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:33,424
But it's my turn
and I'm down 40 coins.

209
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,093
Unless you'd like to play.

210
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,761
No, thanks.

211
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,196
Luca doesn't want to play?

212
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,199
- Why not?
- We'll play with anyone.

213
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,001
Even the grandson of a Roman.

214
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,640
My grandfather
is twice the man you are.

215
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,676
Then why did he allow himself
to be captured?

216
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,244
And made a slave?

217
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,881
I thought Roman soldiers
were bred to be brave.

218
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,120
That's enough.

219
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,755
Put your knives down,
both of you.

220
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,990
There's no time. We must leave
before the sun sets.

221
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,492
Save your fighting for later.

222
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,494
A great treasure awaits.

223
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,529
- Gold coins?
- Bigger.

224
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,298
- Silver chalice?
- The stones of Mustafa.

225
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,933
The fabled jewels
King Mustafa used

226
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,702
to purchase
the kingdom from the gods.

227
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,871
But I thought
this was just a myth.

228
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,806
If you're not interested...

229
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:25,309
No, no, no, we're interested.
We are interested. Come on.

230
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,447
Luca, whatever the trouble
with Hassan,

231
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,850
- don't bring it on the trip.
- He thinks he's better than me.

232
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:36,754
That will never change.

233
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,625
- Where are we going?
- Mount Dinai.

234
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,960
Dinai?

235
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:45,296
Take days, in the worst country
in the world.

236
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,497
Afraid?

237
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,367
I'm not afraid of anything.

238
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,803
Then let's get started.

239
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,671
Keep your eyes open
for anything suspicious.

240
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,373
I don't wanna have come this far
to get our throats slit.

241
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,277
Abdel.

242
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,351
All there is here
is rocks.

243
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:42,353
We haven't seen
what's at the top yet.

244
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:45,022
According to the map,
the only way is up.

245
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:47,792
I hope they find those stones
before dark.

246
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,961
I don't relish having
to spend the night here.

247
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,195
Stop complaining.

248
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:54,632
Almost there.

249
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,152
What are we looking for?

250
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,586
I can't tell.

251
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,556
The map shows a river.

252
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:20,958
There must have been
one here long ago.

253
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,396
Ready?

254
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,899
What's taking them so long?

255
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,600
If it was anybody
but Aladdin,

256
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,904
I'd be afraid they took off
with the jewels and left us.

257
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:34,705
He's too honest.

258
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,341
Every cent he makes,
he squanders on that orphanage.

259
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,144
You were raised
in that orphanage too, Luca.

260
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,345
Meaning what?

261
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,447
Maybe you owe Khalil
something too?

262
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:45,316
Keep talking, Abdullah.

263
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,318
I'll cut that tongue
out of your throat.

264
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,753
Oh, really?

265
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:51,389
Not now, enough.
Enough.

266
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,392
We're going to find those jewels
and go our separate ways.

267
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,093
I'm tired of listening
to us fight.

268
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,395
All we ever do is fight.

269
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,332
When I get home,

270
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:03,534
I wish to find
a woman who never speaks

271
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,902
and makes love like an animal.

272
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,038
Spend the rest of my days
in her bed.

273
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,586
"The rage was buried

274
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,621
"in a watery grave.

275
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,659
No glint to be seen again."

276
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,068
What does that mean?

277
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,803
Well, the river is long gone.

278
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,137
Whatever treasure
existed here

279
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,006
must have been buried
in the water.

280
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,141
What kind of treasure is rage?

281
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,577
We won't know
if we don't find it.

282
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,146
- You sure we want it?
- You sure you don't?

283
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:51,649
Where do we start digging?

284
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:09,500
A glint buried in the water.

285
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,432
Look out!

286
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,170
Get down.

287
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,748
Is that it?

288
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,517
Well, it belongs to us now.

289
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,892
Stay back.

290
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,266
What on earth--?

291
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,868
Come on. Aah!

292
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,044
What do you want?

293
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,199
Abdel.

294
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,998
- Aladdin came to see me today.
- I cannot control who he sees.

295
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,734
- Trying to sell me a book.
- He sells lots of things.

296
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,935
A very old book.

297
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,537
What is your business, Shahira?

298
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,507
You know what my business is.

299
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,542
And soon Aladdin
will know as well.

300
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:34,078
And your secret
is about to be revealed.

301
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,379
You know he won't give up

302
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,715
now that he knows
he's on to something. Ha, ha.

303
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:40,551
Like a dog to a bone, that one.

304
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,019
Let it lie, Shahira.

305
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,522
No good can come out
of the truth now.

306
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:51,695
I want that book, Khalil,
and no man or no magic

307
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:54,231
will stop me
from getting that book.

308
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,411
Help, Luca!

309
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:15,352
- Aladdin.
- Abdel is dead.

310
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:18,189
I unleashed some sort of demon
and it killed him.

311
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:21,192
I couldn't stop it
and I don't know where it is.

312
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,860
Demon? What do you mean?

313
00:24:22,862 --> 00:24:25,329
- Where is Hassan?
- He went into the woods.

314
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,616
We have to find him.

315
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,917
No one should be alone
out there.

316
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,711
Whoa.

317
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,889
We go that way.

318
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,506
- Hassan?
- Hassan!

319
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:45,109
Where are you?

320
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,478
Hassan, stop fooling around.

321
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,381
Hassan!

322
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,983
Hassan!

323
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,165
- Hassan!
- Hassan!

324
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:09,366
Hassan!

325
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,503
Hassan!

326
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,508
What do you want from us?

327
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,881
No.

328
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,560
Let's go.

329
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,162
We gotta grab our stuff
and get out of here

330
00:26:38,164 --> 00:26:39,897
before it kills anybody else.

331
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,638
Hurry.

332
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,111
Let's get going.

333
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,180
I wanna be far away from this
place before the sun sets.

334
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,448
Not so fast.

335
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,422
Packing so soon?
You must have--

336
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,025
You found it.

337
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:11,295
I've been searching for it
for so long.

338
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:14,698
And you come in
with this book,

339
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,100
leading me straight to it.

340
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,568
All I had to do was follow you.

341
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,304
Let you do all the work.
Ha-ha-ha.

342
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,710
Did you rub the lamp?

343
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,315
Have you? You fool!

344
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:35,052
You have, haven't you?
You've released the Jinn.

345
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:38,756
Still, not all is lost.
Give me the lamp.

346
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:45,729
Luca, bring me the lamp
and your debt is paid.

347
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,798
Have you changed your mind?

348
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,299
"I'll do what you want.

349
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,201
I'll do anything."
Isn't that what you said?

350
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:54,571
You betrayed me.

351
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:58,308
He was going to kill me.
There was a knife at my throat.

352
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,643
I didn't have a choice.

353
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,713
You always have a choice.

354
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,381
Bring me the lamp.

355
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:39,510
Oh, Khalil.
Was this your doing?

356
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,944
It looked like you needed it.

357
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,613
I knew Shahira would follow you.

358
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,814
They robbed us.

359
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,783
- Of what?
- An old lamp I found.

360
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:48,418
Oh, by the gods.

361
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,487
I was looking
for the stones of Mustafa.

362
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,923
I should've told you
what the book was pointing to.

363
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:55,259
It didn't point to stones,
only a traitor.

364
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,095
- I didn't have a choice.
- He's right.

365
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,898
He didn't.
And neither did you.

366
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,800
I can see that now.

367
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,701
We're all fulfilling
our destinies.

368
00:30:04,703 --> 00:30:06,303
What are you talking about?

369
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,672
What Luca did
was wrong,

370
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,607
but the trail
he left for Shahira

371
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,876
was how I was
able to find you.

372
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:15,846
So some good came out
of his treachery.

373
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:18,448
But I too am to blame.

374
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,784
I tried to protect you
from your past,

375
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:23,487
to shield you from the dangers
of your destiny.

376
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,189
What destiny?

377
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:27,558
I realize now it's impossible.

378
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,528
We must move
before Shahira's men return.

379
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,699
A little magic
won't keep them away for long.

380
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:40,070
Khalil will be protecting them.
He once practiced the dark arts.

381
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,839
We need to keep them close.

382
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,983
But for now, I have the lamp.

383
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:54,785
I want to see what it can do.

384
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,793
Jinn.

385
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,398
Jinn.

386
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,009
Wait.

387
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,516
I wish for my tent.

388
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,627
I wish for my pipe.

389
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,703
I wish for the finest wines.

390
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,550
Back off, it's mine.

391
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:02,986
Get me some wood for the fire.

392
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:06,256
And you, go get me Luca.

393
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:17,234
We're not safe whilst that thing
is still on the loose.

394
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:19,102
It's a Jinn.

395
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,938
They're sun demons.

396
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,473
When the sun fades from the sky,

397
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:27,010
their energies fade as well
and they vanish.

398
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:29,279
I thought Jinns were
supposed to grant wishes.

399
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,682
Bring their masters
wealth and power.

400
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,984
Years ago, sorcerers
used to summon Jinns

401
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,152
to be their servants.

402
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,486
But soon they learned

403
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,522
how dangerous that could be.

404
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,859
Surely, if they grant wishes,

405
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,662
then owning one
would be worth any difficulty.

406
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,798
They're powerful,

407
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,667
and it's too easy
to lose control over them.

408
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:53,737
If that happens, they can kill.

409
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,272
But even worse,

410
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:58,442
Jinns learned
they had free will,

411
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,678
so they began granting wishes
only to those whose greed

412
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,914
would cause their own demise.

413
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,750
So they could feed
on their souls.

414
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:09,086
In other words,
be careful what you wish for.

415
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,454
Very careful.

416
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:13,657
I've unleashed a great evil
into this world.

417
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,460
The book says something
about a ring of souls.

418
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:19,496
The only way to regain
control of the Jinns

419
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,831
is to have the lamp

420
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,532
and the ring of souls.

421
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,235
The lamp releases the Jinn

422
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,571
and the ring enslaves it.

423
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:30,007
A ring? Where is it?

424
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,945
You're still holding back
what you know, old man.

425
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,580
It's time for you to tell us.

426
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:37,848
Out with it.

427
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:42,452
I was apprentice
to the sorcerers

428
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:45,288
who banished the Jinn.

429
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,890
One was your father, Aladdin.

430
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:52,896
Another was Luca's father.

431
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,470
And the third, Shifa's father.

432
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,943
All who belonged to the sect

433
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,479
were given the mark
of the elements.

434
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,648
That's how
I was able to recognize you

435
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,850
when they left you
on the doorstep.

436
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,786
We are the only four left

437
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:18,221
of those that banished the Jinn.

438
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:21,792
The descendants of those
who were able to open the gates

439
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,760
and send them all to hell.

440
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,599
<i>Your fathers worked
to banish the Jinn.</i>

441
00:34:35,873 --> 00:34:38,475
I wish you back into the lamp.

442
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,125
I was left in Vardana,

443
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:56,893
as I was only an apprentice,

444
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:00,163
not yet accomplished enough
to join in the fight.

445
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,631
They never returned
from the battle,

446
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:03,767
but neither did the Jinns.

447
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,202
I thought
they had been successful

448
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:07,204
until you showed me this book.

449
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,906
And if one of them is free,

450
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,708
you can be sure

451
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,544
it will try
to free its brothers.

452
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:16,580
This is all my fault.

453
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,950
If it weren't for me,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

454
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:22,352
- Luca.
- No.

455
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,956
If I hadn't owed Shahira,
he wouldn't have the lamp.

456
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,891
Luca.

457
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,226
Let him go.

458
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,817
Good to see you again, Luca.

459
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,586
You don't know what you have.

460
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,522
I have everything.
Everything I want.

461
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,096
Where are your friends going?

462
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,766
Shahira, listen to me.

463
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,301
What are they up to?

464
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,702
You think you can control it,

465
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:15,272
but you can't.
You can't control it.

466
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,207
Watch me.

467
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,142
Jinn, I wish you to kill him.

468
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,880
No, no.

469
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,916
- Kill him now!
- No!

470
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,855
Kill him now!

471
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:34,858
Why is he leaving?

472
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,095
It's a sun creature, Shahira,
it lives by the sun.

473
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:41,998
Well, I don't. Mark my word.

474
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,935
I'll slit you head to toe

475
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:47,771
if you don't tell me
where your friends are going.

476
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:49,940
And then
I'll kill your friends, Luca.

477
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:54,945
Shifa. Aladdin. Khalil.
I'll slaughter them like pigs.

478
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:58,181
The ring.
They're after the ring.

479
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,382
What ring?

480
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,451
If you have the lamp
and the ring,

481
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,119
you can control the Jinn.

482
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:06,022
You can get it back
into the lamp.

483
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,758
Without it, you have nothing.

484
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,494
The Jinn is granting wishes
because it wants the ring,

485
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:15,465
or it wants to suck on a soul.
It feeds on souls, Shahira.

486
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,567
It won't have
any trouble eating yours.

487
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,937
If that's true,
why didn't it suck your soul?

488
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,706
Because I had the mark.

489
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,343
- It is in my blood.
- You're lying.

490
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,212
It is in my blood.
You know as well as I

491
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:31,147
that our fathers
banished the Jinns,

492
00:37:31,149 --> 00:37:32,649
they closed the portal.

493
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,385
And we are the only ones
who can open it.

494
00:37:35,387 --> 00:37:36,653
The Jinn knows this.

495
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:37,988
You're lying.

496
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,490
You wished it to kill me,
didn't you?

497
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,825
Well, here I am.

498
00:37:41,827 --> 00:37:43,059
If your friends get the ring,

499
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:44,728
it will banish
the Jinns forever.

500
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,396
But if I have the ring,

501
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:50,734
I can open the portal
and control a thousand Jinns.

502
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:54,838
Shahira,
the Jinn is using you.

503
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,409
Get me the ring, Luca,
or I will kill you all.

504
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:01,478
I will filet you like fish.

505
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,613
And you know I will. Now, go.

506
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,918
Luca.

507
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,554
Remember, I'm watching you.

508
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,666
Then we must find it

509
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,968
and banish the Jinn
back into the lamp.

510
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,837
That is not as easy
as it sounds.

511
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,407
The ring vanished
with your parents.

512
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,442
Well, what does the book say?

513
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,845
According to the book,

514
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,348
Varvak is the resting place
of the ring.

515
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,616
Varvak?

516
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,785
The island?
That place is cursed.

517
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,420
And now you know why.

518
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,955
Shahira must know
the legend of the Jinn.

519
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:49,125
Or he'd never have followed you.
He can't be far behind.

520
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,261
We must find this ring
before he does

521
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:53,763
and banish this creature
back into hell

522
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,932
before it frees the others.

523
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,335
Come on, the night is young.

524
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,070
Let's move while we still can.

525
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,132
This island is no different
than any other island.

526
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,104
I am sure the creature
will follow us here,

527
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:35,805
if it hasn't already.

528
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,308
If a Jinn can be injured,
can it be killed?

529
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,143
It's not really alive,

530
00:39:40,145 --> 00:39:41,611
not in the sense
you and I know.

531
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,979
So it can't be killed.

532
00:39:42,981 --> 00:39:46,249
Any injury you inflict
will be healed by the sun.

533
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:49,352
Harm it
and you may buy some time,

534
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:50,920
but nothing more.

535
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,827
My arms are killing me
from the rope.

536
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,997
Stop your complaining.

537
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,700
They feel
like they're going to fall off.

538
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:05,101
Well, maybe
I should cut them off

539
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,370
and put you out of your misery.

540
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,407
I'm too old for this.

541
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,641
You hear me?

542
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:14,677
I'm getting older
with each passing step.

543
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,785
They can't be far.

544
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:23,086
Come, let's go.

545
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,994
There is the boat. There.

546
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,967
Oh! They've landed
on the other side of the island.

547
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,569
Let's go.

548
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,012
A warning.

549
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,980
The Jinn can see
into your hearts.

550
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,684
It will lull you and tempt you
into wishing for something.

551
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,487
Do not give in to this demon.

552
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,290
It will
have terrible consequences.

553
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,792
Khalil, look.

554
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,295
"The last bed of man
holds the key.

555
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:08,665
It is seen through the proof
of the bravery of the bravest."

556
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,533
What does that mean?

557
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:13,770
The last bed of man.
Is there a cemetery on Varvak?

558
00:41:13,772 --> 00:41:16,239
If you're looking for proof
of bravery of the bravest,

559
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,474
it's a good place to start.

560
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,876
You're one to speak
of bravery, huh, Luca?

561
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,878
Shahira can vouch
for yours.

562
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,981
Let's not argue.
Let's look for the cemetery.

563
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,275
We've lost them.
Go scout around.

564
00:41:52,277 --> 00:41:55,512
Don't come back
until you pick up their trail.

565
00:41:55,514 --> 00:41:58,248
What are you waiting for?
Get moving.

566
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,783
You stay with me,
in case I need protection.

567
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:09,025
He stuffs his fat face
while we do the work.

568
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,293
He's the master.

569
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:11,728
Just because he has more money,

570
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,030
he's no smarter
or stronger than we.

571
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,333
- That's the way of the world.
- Way of the world.

572
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:21,037
Oh, my God. I am exhausted.

573
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,007
- Sit, sit. Just for a moment.
- No.

574
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,142
I go this way, you go that way.

575
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,083
This way, that way.
Everybody gives me orders.

576
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,101
Just a few moments.

577
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,046
I wish I could
lie here forever.

578
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,928
No. No.

579
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,697
- Heavy?
- Very.

580
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,165
Perhaps I can help.

581
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,602
I'm just too old to be running
around the countryside.

582
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,737
Unless, Khalil,

583
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,673
you have a fountain of youth
on you?

584
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,175
I'm afraid
that's a little beyond my magic.

585
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:42,145
- Give me one of these.
- Ah, many thanks.

586
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:44,347
But I wish
I were as light and strong

587
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,784
as when I was a boy. Ah. Ah.

588
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:50,353
Don't rest too long
or you'll never catch up.

589
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,889
Don't worry, I don't want
to be stuck out here all alone.

590
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,131
Babak!

591
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,937
No! No!

592
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,755
Get away.

593
00:46:32,757 --> 00:46:34,857
I know about you,
and that trick.

594
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,260
Khalil warned us.
You want to trick me?

595
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,751
I wish I were young
and strong.

596
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:44,427
Babak!

597
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,463
Hadar!

598
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:51,734
What's taking them so long?
They're not worth waiting for.

599
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,880
Wait.

600
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,049
Abdullah!

601
00:48:07,051 --> 00:48:09,518
He's probably sleeping.
You should never have left him.

602
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,554
Ugh. I'll go get him.

603
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,160
Here I am.

604
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,539
Here, let me take those for you,
old man.

605
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:34,076
Well, what are we waiting for?
Haven't you rested long enough?

606
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,046
Abdullah,
what happened to you?

607
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:41,717
I'm afraid Khalil gave us
some very bad advice.

608
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,552
Your hair is black as coal.

609
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:47,290
It's all a question
of phrasing your wish correctly.

610
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:49,692
Your wish.
You met a Jinn.

611
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:52,194
- Yes.
- No.

612
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:54,997
And he gave me my wish.

613
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:58,534
So there have been wishes
in the past that didn't work.

614
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:01,003
Blame the stupid masters,
not the Jinn.

615
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:02,905
They were brought here
to serve.

616
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:04,573
What did you wish for?

617
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,808
Look at me.

618
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,511
Idiot.
What exactly did you wish for?

619
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:11,747
I wished to be young.
And strong.

620
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,582
It seems to have come true.

621
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:16,252
And to be 30 pounds lighter.

622
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:19,023
What is it?

623
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:47,883
Damn you!

624
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,686
I'll imprison you once again.
I swear it!

625
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,879
Time to go.

626
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,300
The cemetery.

627
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,237
Now what?

628
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,005
Looks can be deceiving.

629
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,107
Khalil, what do we do now?

630
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:47,676
"The seeker
shall be guided by fire."

631
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,147
There's no fire here.

632
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:53,182
The proof
of the bravery of the bravest

633
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,818
is supposed to guide us
by fire.

634
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,620
What does that mean?

635
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:00,289
We're looking
for proof of bravery?

636
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,791
One thing leads to another.

637
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,459
Yeah,
maybe it doesn't.

638
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:04,693
Why all these puzzles?

639
00:51:04,695 --> 00:51:07,029
I would think the harder it is
to find the ring,

640
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:09,765
the harder it is
to gain control of the Jinn.

641
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,237
The final resting place
of Prince Jareb.

642
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:17,807
- Who is that?
- A prince of the realm.

643
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:20,009
Whatever it is
we're looking for,

644
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:22,845
we'll find it inside.

645
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,350
There's nothing written on it.

646
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:35,885
Well, what do we do now?

647
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,855
It bears Shifa's fire sign.

648
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:00,376
Khalil, can you read it?

649
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:06,415
"The temple of Maghreb
bears the wrath of damnation."

650
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:08,083
What does that mean?

651
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:12,021
It's showing us the way
from this world into hell.

652
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,389
And back again.

653
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,792
That bears the mark.

654
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:19,361
I see it now.

655
00:53:19,363 --> 00:53:22,431
The Jinn allowed us
to follow these clues.

656
00:53:22,433 --> 00:53:24,767
So that we would find
the door to hell.

657
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:28,437
So that will release the Jinns
that were banished there.

658
00:53:28,439 --> 00:53:30,506
Then why did he kill
Hassan and Abdullah?

659
00:53:30,508 --> 00:53:33,309
Because they didn't wear
the mark.

660
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:36,178
One of our sect
must undo the spell.

661
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,950
It needs one of us
to wish the portal open.

662
00:53:40,952 --> 00:53:44,587
But we're gonna do
just the opposite.

663
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:47,223
We must hurry to Maghreb.

664
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,210
Come on.

665
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:10,446
Ha! They found something.
They must be getting close.

666
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:17,987
They may have the ring,

667
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:20,356
but without the lamp,
it's useless.

668
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:53,422
If this is our destiny,
let's go and meet it.

669
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,347
When was the temple abandoned?

670
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:20,883
From the time before
my great-great-grandfather.

671
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,659
The doorway to hell.

672
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,132
It's just a frame.

673
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,504
The portal is shut.

674
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,874
But under the proper conditions,
it becomes very real indeed.

675
00:55:45,876 --> 00:55:49,845
"The circle will be broken
when the four elements meet."

676
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,522
Well, it must be hidden.

677
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,691
This is the only circle
in here.

678
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,901
It's a warning to leave
before there's no chance left.

679
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,837
A warning means there's
something to be found.

680
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:18,273
The circle will be broken
when the four elements meet.

681
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:20,175
- The four elements, our markings.
- Right.

682
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:21,910
We're here,
nothing's happening.

683
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:23,545
I'm afraid a spell this strong

684
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,814
takes more than
just our presence.

685
00:56:25,816 --> 00:56:27,483
It calls for blood.

686
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:34,957
Come.

687
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:28,010
Luca. Luca.

688
00:57:28,012 --> 00:57:30,078
- We have a deal.
- Shahira.

689
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:32,381
For the sake of the world,
give us the lamp.

690
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:33,682
No!

691
00:57:33,684 --> 00:57:36,785
Do you think I'd come this far
to give everything up?

692
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:38,120
Luca, if we join forces,

693
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,155
there's more than enough
power for both of us.

694
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,024
More than you've ever dreamed.

695
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:44,726
If we'll open the portal,
we can have a Jinn each.

696
00:57:44,728 --> 00:57:47,463
One hundred Jinns.
Think of it.

697
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:51,333
A life of unlimited luxury.

698
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,003
- Stop.
- Luca.

699
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,840
This is not a earthly treasure.

700
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:03,479
With a Jinn, there's no limit
to what we can do and own.

701
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:04,746
Join me.

702
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:20,028
Jinn, if you give me the ring,
I will open the portal for you.

703
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,530
It won't work, Shahira.

704
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,466
The portal can only be opened
by one who bears the mark.

705
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,936
That's why the Jinn
won't harm us.

706
00:58:27,938 --> 00:58:30,138
Then I wish for the mark.

707
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:44,720
Didn't quite think it would work
like this, did you, old man?

708
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:47,856
Luca, we have bargained before.

709
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,691
We have a piece
of the prize.

710
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:53,562
We can bargain again.
It's not too late.

711
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:54,796
Shahira, give me the lamp

712
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:56,765
so the creature can be wished
back into hell.

713
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,767
Why would I do that?

714
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:00,369
Because it will kill you
as well.

715
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,737
You cannot win this!

716
00:59:01,739 --> 00:59:04,273
Liar!
You want it to serve you!

717
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:06,775
To make you all powerful!

718
00:59:13,616 --> 00:59:14,850
Kill it!

719
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:23,759
Kill it. Kill it.
Please!

720
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,734
Let's get out of here.

721
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:02,998
It's growing powerful,

722
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,766
thanks to the souls
it's consuming.

723
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,868
Luca, wish it back
in the lamp.

724
01:00:09,006 --> 01:00:11,673
- What are you doing?
- I was gonna wish it back.

725
01:00:11,675 --> 01:00:16,345
- Then do it.
- I said, I was going to.

726
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:17,846
Shahira said something smart.

727
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:20,482
Shahira is dead.
It shows you how smart he is.

728
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:22,150
But he was right
about one thing.

729
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:24,086
There's more than enough power
here for all of us.

730
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:27,222
Luca, no. Just wish the Jinn
imprisoned once more.

731
01:00:27,224 --> 01:00:29,925
If you don't wanna make
the wish, I'll do it.

732
01:00:29,927 --> 01:00:31,393
If the temptation
is so great,

733
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:33,395
how do we know we can trust
any of us?

734
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,901
I think I found my own destiny.

735
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:42,771
I'm smart enough
to make my own future.

736
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:44,172
Stop! No.

737
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:45,440
Aladdin, don't.

738
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:54,850
I command you now.

739
01:00:57,187 --> 01:01:01,523
See?
It's my servant.

740
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,592
Just waiting to do
whatever I ask.

741
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:09,297
Luca, I raised you as my son.
I beg of you.

742
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:10,899
Don't.

743
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:16,405
Take me away from here.

744
01:01:16,407 --> 01:01:19,541
And I wish for you never
to tell me what to do again.

745
01:01:23,044 --> 01:01:23,545
Khalil.

746
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,718
Khalil, my father.

747
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:31,653
- Khalil.
- My father!

748
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:34,289
- Khalil, my father.
- No!

749
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,557
Where is it?

750
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:45,233
Luca! I'll kill you!

751
01:01:57,246 --> 01:01:59,381
I can wish for anything,
can't I?

752
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,686
You can't play any tricks
with me.

753
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:07,456
I've got the ring and the lamp.

754
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,491
You have got to give me
everything I want

755
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,193
and how I want it.

756
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,796
All right.

757
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:17,599
I wish... I wish...

758
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,236
I wish for some food.

759
01:02:24,107 --> 01:02:25,340
Hey.

760
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:29,211
Hey!

761
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:33,315
What good is a servant
if he disappears with the sun?

762
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,518
Right.

763
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:39,721
Right.

764
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,289
Tonight, we say goodbye

765
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,658
to the only father
that we have ever known.

766
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,263
Khalil dedicated his life
to us.

767
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,899
He taught me
everything I know.

768
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:25,734
Me too.

769
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:28,870
There seemed to be no end
to his wisdom--

770
01:03:28,872 --> 01:03:30,305
His kindness.

771
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,310
What will we tell them
back at the orphanage?

772
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,013
We tell them he died
a brave and honorable death.

773
01:03:38,015 --> 01:03:40,649
No man can wish for more.

774
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:43,518
But we're not gonna dishonor him
by giving in to grief.

775
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:54,529
We're gonna find that demon
and send it back to hell.

776
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,865
The Jinn believes
it has what he was after.

777
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,634
It doesn't need us,
it won't hesitate to kill us.

778
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:01,803
Damn Luca
and his treachery.

779
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:04,172
He hasn't wished
the portal open yet.

780
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,974
He can't, until morning.

781
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:07,876
Maybe we can find him,
reason with him,

782
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:10,278
appeal to his good side.

783
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,414
What makes you think
he has one?

784
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,620
Aladdin.

785
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,923
It's my fault.

786
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:56,791
Luca didn't kill Khalil,
I did.

787
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,927
What are you saying?

788
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:04,266
Some treasures are found
at too great a cost.

789
01:05:04,268 --> 01:05:06,368
But we can't just give up.

790
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,270
We can't just walk away.

791
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:10,105
We have to go and find Luca
before it's too late.

792
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,706
- It already is.
- No.

793
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:13,608
You saw that thing.
You know what it's capable of.

794
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,944
- We're finished!
- No.

795
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:19,247
You said to Khalil that a man
is not a man without a past.

796
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:21,983
Well, I say nor is he one
without a future.

797
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,787
Luca will not give up
without a fight.

798
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,889
But I won't stop
until it's done.

799
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:32,260
Go ahead, great Aladdin, run.

800
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,296
I'll finish this without you.

801
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:38,066
Shifa.

802
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,241
If it's a fight he wants...

803
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,412
then fight him we will.

804
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,628
Damn you.

805
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,496
You must never leave me!

806
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,832
I'm starving.

807
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,469
I wish for food.

808
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:22,711
It's amazing. Amazing.

809
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,599
I smell food.

810
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,370
He's close.

811
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:09,090
Mm. I'm stuffed.

812
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,561
I've never eaten so much
in my life.

813
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,212
That fat pig.

814
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,616
Where's the Jinn?

815
01:07:34,618 --> 01:07:37,352
I don't know.
But now's our chance.

816
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:46,327
Damn you, Shahira.

817
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:50,465
Please don't kill me.

818
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,235
If you won't kill me,
grant me a wish.

819
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:57,205
I want money. A lot of it.

820
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,077
I wish I was showered in gold.

821
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,051
I'm rich! I'm rich!

822
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,988
I'm rich! I'm rich!

823
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,098
<i>Salaam,</i> brother Luca.

824
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,001
<i>Salaam,</i> Aladdin.

825
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:01,603
We need to speak.

826
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,141
I'm always willing
to speak to you.

827
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:08,376
But I warn you.
I'm not going to change my mind.

828
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:11,279
Luca, I fear you don't realize
what you're doing.

829
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:13,681
You're about to unleash
a horrible force.

830
01:09:13,683 --> 01:09:17,418
No, it's only horrible
if you can't control it.

831
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:20,421
I intend to control it.

832
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:22,557
Your control
already killed Khalil.

833
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:29,297
Khalil's dead?

834
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:33,401
That's not what I wished for.

835
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:36,171
You wished he would never
tell you what to do again.

836
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,643
No. No,
that's not what I meant.

837
01:09:41,645 --> 01:09:43,945
No, no, no!

838
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:46,514
That's not what I meant!

839
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,716
The creature stopped
his breathing.

840
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,085
Don't you see?
With every wish you make,

841
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:53,421
you run the risk
of destroying everything.

842
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:56,457
Well, I made a mistake.

843
01:09:56,459 --> 01:09:58,693
I'll be more careful
in the future.

844
01:09:58,695 --> 01:09:59,928
Please.

845
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,199
For all the years
we've spent together,

846
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:06,601
give me the ring and the lamp.

847
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:18,213
No.

848
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,394
Luca.

849
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,243
Stop!

850
01:10:48,245 --> 01:10:51,212
Shifa...

851
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:52,513
bring me the lamp.

852
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:57,018
Bring me the lamp, Shifa.

853
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:01,022
Or...

854
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:03,124
I'll wish that Aladdin
never existed.

855
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:13,801
Now.

856
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,754
Don't hurt him.

857
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,793
Don't hurt either of them.

858
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,767
So this was all a trick, huh?

859
01:11:45,769 --> 01:11:49,437
You were gonna pull the wool
over stupid Luca's eyes?

860
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,674
You think I don't know
what they say about me?

861
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,676
You think I don't know they say,
"Poor Luca."

862
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,711
"He's nothing like Aladdin."

863
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:58,746
"He's just the grandson
of a poor Roman slave.

864
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:02,850
He will never be as smart
or as brave as one of you!"

865
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,287
Well, those days are over.

866
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,826
Jinn.

867
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,094
I wish--

868
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,362
Luca.

869
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:16,831
I wish--
No.

870
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:23,371
Jinn, I wish for more power
than any man has had before.

871
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,974
I wish...

872
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,144
I wish...

873
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:36,150
for the power of one Jinn
times a thousand!

874
01:12:40,422 --> 01:12:42,490
What have you done?

875
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,703
You've opened the portal.
You wished for a thousand Jinns.

876
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,439
That's the only way
for that wish to come true.

877
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:04,445
You saw me command one Jinn.

878
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:08,349
Now, see when I command
a thousand.

879
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,261
You win, Luca.

880
01:13:20,263 --> 01:13:21,462
Shifa.

881
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:25,700
Face it, Aladdin.
Luca is our new master.

882
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:31,139
I'll give you anything you want.

883
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:32,907
Everything you wish for.

884
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,977
How can you say that
when a wish killed Khalil?

885
01:13:38,781 --> 01:13:40,548
I wish he wasn't dead.

886
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,653
Let me try to make it up to you.

887
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:48,156
Nothing will replace him.

888
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,897
I would never harm either you
or Aladdin.

889
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,903
You two are the people
that I'm closest to.

890
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:04,071
I want to believe you.

891
01:14:04,073 --> 01:14:06,340
Shifa, don't listen to him.

892
01:14:06,342 --> 01:14:08,543
Let her make up her own mind!

893
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:11,179
Aladdin, there's no point
in fighting anymore.

894
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:13,781
Just accept it.

895
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,086
Smart girl.

896
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:23,858
Let me give you a taste
of what life is gonna be like.

897
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:30,498
Jinn, I wish for Shifa
to be dressed

898
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,467
in the finest silks.

899
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:51,118
We were wrong about you.

900
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,790
So now there are two traitors
to Khalil's memory.

901
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:58,626
If you can't join us, leave us.

902
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:17,745
Aladdin is too obstinate
for his own good.

903
01:15:17,747 --> 01:15:21,516
He's probably at the temple now
trying to close the portal.

904
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:24,151
He doesn't have the ring.
He doesn't have the lamp.

905
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:25,853
He's powerless.

906
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:28,890
No. Never underestimate Aladdin.

907
01:15:28,892 --> 01:15:31,626
We don't need him, Luca.

908
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:36,697
We can go anywhere we want.
We can do anything we want.

909
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:41,335
Just...

910
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,870
think of it.

911
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,509
No more robbing graves to eat.

912
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:50,945
Anything you ever imagined
could be yours.

913
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:53,014
You have all the power.

914
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:57,151
Aladdin is nothing, forget him.

915
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,489
For years,
I lived in his shadow.

916
01:16:01,491 --> 01:16:05,393
Robbing a few graves is nothing
compared to what you've done.

917
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:07,995
You really think so?

918
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:09,664
I know so, Luca.

919
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:13,301
People will not speak
of the great Aladdin again.

920
01:16:13,303 --> 01:16:16,704
Parents will tell their children
of the great Luca.

921
01:16:16,706 --> 01:16:19,907
They will speak of instinct.
They will speak of cunning.

922
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,410
They will speak of power.

923
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,347
My instinct tells me
I must stop him, Shifa.

924
01:16:27,783 --> 01:16:31,719
I've come too far to have him
take that power away from me.

925
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:33,854
If he closes the portal,

926
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:35,856
it's over, I have nothing.

927
01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,295
You know, with one Jinn,
you can conjure up a meal.

928
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:44,231
But with a thousand,
you can have the world.

929
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:45,733
He's like a brother, Luca.

930
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,903
Don't hurt him.

931
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,708
I have little choice, Shifa.

932
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,611
Jinn.

933
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,714
Take us to Maghreb.

934
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,861
There must be some way
to stop this!

935
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:35,249
Aladdin!

936
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,859
No. Don't hurt him.

937
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,429
You've opened the portal.

938
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:51,298
You're about to bring
a thousand of these monsters.

939
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,900
Is that how
you wanna be known?

940
01:17:52,902 --> 01:17:55,936
King of the demons?
Doesn't that make you one?

941
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,405
Silence!

942
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:01,409
Do you really believe this beast
will remain your humble servant?

943
01:18:01,411 --> 01:18:03,944
It has no choice.
It must obey me.

944
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:06,013
Obey? Obey you?

945
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:09,450
Like it obeyed Shahira?
Hassan? Abdullah?

946
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:13,054
They didn't know
how to wish the right way.

947
01:18:13,056 --> 01:18:15,022
There is no right way.

948
01:18:17,125 --> 01:18:18,325
Khalil!

949
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:23,464
- You're alive.
- I woke up.

950
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:27,201
I found myself wandering
in the forest.

951
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:30,171
I remember,
he wished you weren't dead.

952
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:34,575
So your two accidental wishes
canceled each other out.

953
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,212
Give me the lamp and the ring.

954
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,748
Let me end this
once and for all.

955
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,255
Traitor.

956
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:52,827
- No.
- Stop.

957
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,129
- Shifa!
- No.

958
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:56,931
Don't kill her.

959
01:18:56,933 --> 01:18:59,734
I command you to stop.
It is my wish.

960
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:01,435
Take me instead!

961
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,613
Luca, throw me the ring
and I'll wish it to stop.

962
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:17,918
You no longer have the lamp.
You have no control over it.

963
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:45,112
Stand back, my son.

964
01:19:46,348 --> 01:19:49,216
Waters from heaven, come down!

965
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,734
I wish you to release her.

966
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:13,607
And I wish that you
do not harm any of us.

967
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:21,081
We must hurry.
Come. Come. Come.

968
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:36,831
I wish the portal to hell
to close now.

969
01:20:43,537 --> 01:20:44,004
Luca!

970
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,208
Luca!

971
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:51,745
No!

972
01:20:57,452 --> 01:20:59,653
Earthly steel has no effect
on them.

973
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,557
I'm trying!

974
01:21:08,164 --> 01:21:10,364
Luca. Luca!

975
01:21:13,735 --> 01:21:16,804
- I'm sorry, Aladdin.
- Don't give up!

976
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:22,042
Luca. Luca!

977
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,744
No!

978
01:21:23,746 --> 01:21:26,146
- I deserve this!
- No!

979
01:21:26,148 --> 01:21:27,448
Let me go!

980
01:21:30,652 --> 01:21:32,221
Luca!

981
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,744
I'll send you to that infernal
place where you belong.

982
01:21:58,113 --> 01:21:59,413
I wish you back in the lamp.

983
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,236
Shifa. Shifa.

984
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:37,618
- Aladdin, let me go.
- Never.

985
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:43,023
You'll be dragged in too!
Let go.

986
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:45,559
No!

987
01:23:06,515 --> 01:23:08,282
Ah!

988
01:23:08,284 --> 01:23:11,352
Here. Strike as hard as you can.

989
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,123
Die! Die!

990
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:23,097
Die!

991
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,758
It's useless on its own.

992
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,096
Keep it as a witness
of this day.

993
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,396
Aladdin, did you really think
I'd gone over to Luca's side?

994
01:25:02,398 --> 01:25:06,233
No, I recognized it as a trick
to get to the lamp.

995
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:08,469
You've proven yourself
to be a great fighter.

996
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:10,904
I want you to come with me
on my next expedition.

997
01:25:10,906 --> 01:25:12,940
You're starting
a new expedition already?

998
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:14,875
Well, I've had enough
adventure for a while.

999
01:25:14,877 --> 01:25:16,376
Perhaps I'll just
take a job in town.

1000
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:19,179
Oh, you'll be back
treasure-hunting in a month.

1001
01:25:19,181 --> 01:25:20,714
Heh. You're right.

1002
01:25:20,716 --> 01:25:23,083
I nearly gave in there.
I could feel the temptation.

1003
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:24,518
I saw.

1004
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:28,422
But I realized the one thing
worse than a wish unfulfilled.

1005
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:30,090
A wish granted.

1006
01:25:30,092 --> 01:25:32,359
Ah.
