"Swing around to Hollywood."

26
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,437

27
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,280

Or are you just gonna keep on moving on?

39
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,316
You know from town-to-town,

40
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:32,543

41
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,483

42

43
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,663

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,530
I'm not running away.

Why are asking me these things?

47
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:58,816
What do you got against me?

48
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:02,316
- To me, it seems like a real lonely life.

49
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,510
- What are you running away from then?

50
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:11,840

00:07:25,073 --> 00:07:26,240
Christ, Jesus.

Well, are new in town, huh?

63
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:32,295
- How'd you guess?

64
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,447
- Let's see, you're not an actor,

65
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,343
you're not a director, lie to me.

66
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:48,663
No, okay, a musician?

67
00:08:55,037 --> 00:08:55,870
Han-Solo?

68
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,810
- I'm a fryer, fish and
chips and french fries.

69
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,163
You know?

70
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:11,746
- That's good stuff,
I like fish and chips.

71
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:14,982
- I don't do it anymore.

72
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:20,230
- Well, what are you gonna do now?

73
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,325
- I'm gonna try and split

74
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:24,888
'cause I'll walk out of this place.

75
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:28,388
(engaging dramatic music)

76
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:48,192
- Oh my God, how can you
drink like this, man?

77
00:09:51,492 --> 00:09:55,909
You're gonna fuck yourself
up at this rate, you know?

78
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,641
- I'm feeling really sick now.

79
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,232
Well, the restroom's back there.

80
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,291
(vomiting)

81
00:10:19,874 --> 00:10:21,083
- Fuck.

82
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,143
Shit.

83
00:10:32,657 --> 00:10:35,273
- [Anna] You could come
on over to my place.

84
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:42,168
- I don't want to make a fool of myself.

85
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,085
- Let's go.

86
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:48,324

Hmm.

151
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,513

152
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,603
Fucking hell, why am I here anyway?

153
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,407
Come on, why, tell me why.

154
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,304

156
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,096
And what am I accused of?

157
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,760
- Think Joshua, think.

158
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,290
I'm sure there's something
you can come up with.

159
00:18:49,311 --> 00:18:53,728
- Somebody is very funny
around here and it's not me.

(glass clatters)

161

Whatever you're talking about,
you've got the wrong guy.

162
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,440
- Look, I can't let you go
Joshua unless you tell me

163
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,520
what you've done, 'cause
unless you tell me

164
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,470
what you've done, I can't let you go.

165
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,920
- Hey, hold on, what the
fucking hell is this?

166
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,380
I've never heard such crap.

167
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,230
- Now, Joshua, I don't like
it when people yell and swear.

168
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,780
- All right, what have you got?

169
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,133
You've got a resentment to men's lives?

170
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,170
- I hope you can do better than that.

171
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:36,141
(engaging dramatic music)

172
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,520
- So that's what's going on,

173
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:54,642
it's not me, it's that
instrument you're using.

174
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,405
- Not that simple.

175
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:02,488
- What a waste, this is, St. Matthew.

176
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,483
- What do you know?

177
00:20:14,483 --> 00:20:16,498
- [Joshua] What do you
mean, what do I know?

178
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:17,331
- You don't know shit.

179
00:20:17,331 --> 00:20:19,253
- Everybody knows.

180
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,923
You can see what it does to people.

181
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:26,672
- Oh yeah, what?

182
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,022
- It simply destroys them.

183
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:50,041
If you wait for me then
why have you hated me?

184
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:54,423
(engaging dramatic music)

185
00:21:13,962 --> 00:21:16,629
Are you trying to kill yourself?

186
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:26,805
♪ Feel like a big boulder ♪

187
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:30,808
♪ In and out ♪

188
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:34,788
♪ Give your life ♪

189
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:38,506
♪ And every time they come ♪

190
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:43,506
♪ They take a little
piece of you with them ♪

191
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:59,533
I feel like I don't exist anymore.

192
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,810
Suddenly all my feelings disappear

193
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,593
and all the pain vanishes.

194
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:22,238
- You should trim your hair, you know?

195
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,988
Your ends are to starting to split.

196
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:33,908
You know, you're a very delicate flower.

197
00:22:43,951 --> 00:22:45,868
- I'm a wilting flower.

198
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,109
- No, you're not.

199
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:55,934
- They're not in there, you know.

200
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,370
- Well, where are they then?

201
00:23:00,956 --> 00:23:03,027
- You still don't get it, do you?

202
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:05,025
I'm not going to tell you.

203
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:05,858
- I don't know what to tell you.

204
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:07,123
Give me a clue.

205
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,900
- Stop pretending you're stupid.

206
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,713
You're starting to bug me.

207
00:23:20,511 --> 00:23:21,511
Hey, Joshua.

208
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,080
Save me.

209
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,813
Save me, Joshua, I'm falling!

210
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,993
Hurry up!

211
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:36,059
- [Joshua] I can't reach.

212
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,632
- Well try, try harder.

213
00:23:38,632 --> 00:23:40,221
- [Joshua] Come here.

214
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,509
- No, you have to do it.

215
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,176
Charlie, I'm caught.

216
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,449
- [Joshua] Come on, come on.

217
00:23:47,449 --> 00:23:48,532
- Charlie, I-

218
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:50,786
- I got ya.

219
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,230
- Steven, is Steven here?

220
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,230
Yes, it's Steven, you're such a cheater.

221
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:03,752
(panting)

222
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:27,908
No, no.

223
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:34,686
Get off me.

224
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,153
Get away from me.

225
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:40,320
(engaging jazz music)

226
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:33,035
(dark unsettling music)

227
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:50,524
Do it yourself.

228
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:59,980
(romantic music and panting)

229
00:26:51,641 --> 00:26:52,474
Joshua.

230
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,453
Now, who do you love more?

231
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:07,223
Your mother or your father?

232
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,813
- Not my mother or father.

233
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,113
- Your friends?

234
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:26,320
- I don't really got any friends, as such.

235
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,263
- Country?

236
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:42,813
- Country where I can live like this.

237
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,483
- Beauty?

238
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:04,378
Beauty, only if she were
a goddess and immortal.

239
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,203
- Money?

240
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,853
- No, I hate money as
much as you hate God.

241
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,770
- Well what do you love then?

242
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:42,181
- I love the clouds.

243
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:45,551
- Clouds?

244
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,903
- Yeah, over there.

245
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:49,659
- Where?

246
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:50,907
- Over there.

247
00:28:50,907 --> 00:28:51,843
- Where?

248
00:28:51,843 --> 00:28:55,843
- Up there, those beautiful,
magnificent clouds.

249
00:29:04,086 --> 00:29:06,586
(birds chirp)

250
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,036
- Oh, you look beautiful

251
00:29:39,036 --> 00:29:40,786
- What are you doing?

252
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,483
- I bet you would drive
everybody crazy like this.

253
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,350
- Hang on.

254
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,183
- No, no.

255
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,653
Look, see first, ta-da!

256
00:29:57,457 --> 00:29:58,290
- Oh cute.

257
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,420
- Like it?

258
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,030
- No, when did you do that?

259
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,680
- Your told me to.

260
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,026
I think it's pretty neat.

261
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:07,497
- Not sure I do.

262
00:30:07,497 --> 00:30:08,663
- It looks sexy on ya.

263
00:30:14,037 --> 00:30:17,223
- You know, you're
gonna have to let me go.

264
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:35,087
Anna, just explain to
me, what do you want, eh?

265
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:43,320
- Just promise you're not gonna leave me.

266
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,403
- How can I do that?

267
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,823
- Just promise.

268
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,460
Just promise!

269
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,520
- Look, I've gotta decide for me self.

270
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,537
- Can't you promise?

271
00:30:56,537 --> 00:31:00,020
- Look, you know that.

272
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,307
Listen, when I was 16, I sent a letter

273
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,313
to me mum, saying that my father was dead.

274
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,683
I even made it look as
if it came from America.

275
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,313
I was just trying to get
her to stop waiting for him.

276
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:32,607
But she, she wouldn't believe it.

277
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:38,473
She thought it was all a conspiracy,

278
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,423
that he was like being
held prisoner somewhere.

279
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:46,690
Her mind was going though.

280
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,793
She was really sick.

281
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,840
Anyway, about six months later, I actually

282
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,893
got a letter saying that he was dead,

283
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,053
and you know, I couldn't tell her.

284
00:32:11,449 --> 00:32:12,933
- You're gonna leave, ain't you?

285
00:32:14,528 --> 00:32:15,361
- I don't know.

286
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,037
- See those, take 'em.

287
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:04,949
- Anna.

288
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,383
- Go.

289
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,213
- Anna, look.

290
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,033
- Just go, see ya, bye.

291
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,223
- Look, I didn't mean to
give you the wrong idea.

292
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,503
- Don't say anything, just go.

293
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:52,743
(door opens and closes)

294
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:03,573
(traffic and commotion buzzes)

295
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,667
(engaging jazz music)

296
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,138
I've been out and around
town to sell a few things.

297
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:22,721
I sold a few today.

298
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:26,330
- Wow, those are real nice.

299
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,263
These are real nice.

300
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,717
How much can you sell these for?

301
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,273
- Well, about 10 bucks.

302
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,370
- That one's a bit special.

303
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,210
- This is really pretty.

304
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,720
How much did you say?

305
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,970
- 10 dollars.

306
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,803
- 10 bucks?

307
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,270
- Wow, it's cool.

308
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,290
- You can have it.

309
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,687
- Really?

310
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:54,813
- Yeah.

311
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:55,819
- Thanks.

312
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:57,599
- You know that girl?

313
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,730
The girt that sitting
next to me at the bar?

314
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,090
The girl, Anna?

315
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,923
- Yeah.

316
00:36:04,217 --> 00:36:06,049
- I mean what about her?

317
00:36:06,049 --> 00:36:08,299
I mean, I'm really worried?

318
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:13,304
I think she's addicted to heroin.

319
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:14,137
- Really?

320
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,127
What makes you think that, man?

321
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,903
- These couple of guys, they were cool,

322
00:36:25,903 --> 00:36:29,844
at least the time when I worked.

323
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:33,383
Do you know of 'em sort of
like personally, intimately?

324
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:36,510
- What are you getting at, man?

325
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,910
- Well, can they ever get off I mean?

326
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,910
- I got other things on my fucking mind.

327
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,683
- Yeah, well, I'll work it out, Charlie.

328
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,923
- Yeah, we'll see, Joshua.

329
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:09,953
(door knocks)

330
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:12,620
(bottle clanks)

331
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:41,738
- You hungry?

332
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,180
- No, just fucking frustrated.

333
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:01,545
- All right, let's see what I got.

334
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:04,128
(plates clank)

335
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:15,608
Californian wine, bananas,
some crystals, bread.

336
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:34,423
You know, you look a little pale.

337
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:45,213
- I'm always pale, Joshua.

338
00:38:48,297 --> 00:38:52,380
(plates clatter and bags rustle)

339
00:39:47,998 --> 00:39:50,203
- You're missing out on
your feast, you know?

340
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,273
I went to that bar.

341
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,953
I saw our friend, Charlie.

342
00:40:08,287 --> 00:40:10,987
- What do you mean you saw
him, what did you tell him?

343
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,830
- I didn't tell him
anything, we just talked.

344
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:25,314
- You think you're just
walking out of here?

345
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:27,247
- Not while I'm eating.

346
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:29,497
- I'm not on drugs, Joshua.

347
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:31,975
- What are you on about?

348
00:40:31,975 --> 00:40:33,954
- You're all the same, fucking studs,

349
00:40:33,954 --> 00:40:35,728
pigs, you're all the same.

350
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,169
- Why are you being a bitch?

351
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:38,002
- Because.

352
00:40:39,862 --> 00:40:41,603
- Hey, put that down okay?

353
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,960
Put that down it might be loaded.

354
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,541
Come on, come on.

355
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:48,894
(banging)

356
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:50,390
Jesus Christ.

357
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,423
Anna, put it down.

358
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,977
Jesus, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

359
00:41:08,403 --> 00:41:10,326
- What time is it?

360
00:41:10,326 --> 00:41:13,133
- I don't know, around seven o'clock.

361
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,083
- Seven, seven o'clock.

362
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,713
Dinner's ready.

363
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,083
Come on Anna, everybody's waiting for you.

364
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,050
I remember when mother used to call me

365
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:34,040
and I'd come on down, and
she'd bring in the food

366
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,770
while my Father and
Johnny, my brother didn't

367
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,281
sit at the table, and I'd sit

368
00:41:38,281 --> 00:41:42,663
in front of 'em, and talk to my mother.

369
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,170
Well, my dad and my brother,
they'd just be sitting,

370
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,170
waiting, waiting, doing
nothing but watch TV.

371
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,393
My mother used to complain
about them all the time.

372
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,833
She'd cook the nicest meals too.

373
00:42:08,635 --> 00:42:10,085
But, I think she's upset now.

374
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,203
She won't even talk to me anymore.

375
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,093
Joshua?

376
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:25,483
- [Joshua] Yeah.

377
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,793
- Why did you come back?

378
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,770
- [Joshua] Needed somewhere to stay.

379
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,843
- Oh you liar.

380
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,943
Do you think he could
ever love someone like me?

381
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,533
- Someone as crazy as you?

382
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,393
- What did you say?

383
00:42:58,374 --> 00:42:59,207
- A Bernadette.

384
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:00,503
- You better watch your mouth.

385
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:36,886
(light banging)

386
00:44:04,015 --> 00:44:07,765
(voices murmur from outside)

387
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,100
- Oh, great.

388
00:44:30,473 --> 00:44:31,306
Joshua.

389
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,455
Joshua!

390
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:58,288
Joshua!

391
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,793
Joshua!

392
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:04,670
Damn him.

393
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:08,946
(engaging jazz music)

394
00:45:53,226 --> 00:45:56,559
(bar commotion murmurs)

395
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,040
- So I kinda like made up a story

396
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,643
to tell the guy she was with.

397
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,777
What's happened to you?

398
00:46:14,777 --> 00:46:16,713
You look like a total wreck.

399
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,011
- What's happening to you.

400
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:21,844
Are you sick or something?

401
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:23,450
- Charlie, I need to talk to you.

402
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,737
- [Charlie] About what?

403
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:27,637
- Can you get somebody off this stuff?

404
00:46:29,574 --> 00:46:31,300
- Get somebody off of what?

405
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,500
- Bloody fucking heroin.

406
00:46:33,668 --> 00:46:34,968
I wanna get her off of it.

407
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,377
- Good luck, Superman.

408
00:46:39,294 --> 00:46:41,577
That's gonna be a tough one.

409
00:46:41,577 --> 00:46:44,378
- Yeah, I know.

410
00:46:44,378 --> 00:46:48,628
- Who the fuck are you man,
have you ever tried it?

411
00:46:50,753 --> 00:46:53,440
You don't know nothing about it, man.

412
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,310
- [Joshua] If somebody
would explain it to me

413
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,270
I think I might understand it.

414
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,773
- Look, take it this way, man.

415
00:47:03,094 --> 00:47:08,094
You can't get somebody to
leave the ways they wanna be.

416
00:47:08,465 --> 00:47:10,270
That's the way it is.

417
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,770
(engaging dramatic music)

418
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:30,901
- Ow, ow, stop it.

419
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:35,032
What's the matter with you, are you crazy?

420
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:37,410
- Who the fuck do you think you are?

421
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:39,193
Jesus Christ, the fucking Savior?

422
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,280
Joshua, what did you with my stash?

423
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:46,863
- I threw it away.

424
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:48,658
- Oh you did, huh?

425
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:52,380
Well guess I want it and it was mine.

426
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,870
You can't do this, Joshua.

427
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,778
You can't stop a junkie from doing

428
00:48:56,778 --> 00:48:59,650
from doing what he does
because it's not a joke.

429
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:00,823
- I do it for myself.

430
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,843
- Joshua, you can't help me.

431
00:49:05,996 --> 00:49:07,240
Don't you get it?

432
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,520
You can't help me.

433
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,893
I wanna do what I'm doing, it's my life.

434
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,660
- [Joshua] I'm going to be
right here with you, Anna.

435
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,490
- I'm sick Joshua, I feel like shit,

436
00:49:19,898 --> 00:49:23,109
like shit, like shit, like shit.

437
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:26,192
(vomits and retches)

438
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:01,881
(water rinses)

439
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,913
- Tell me a story, Joshua.

440
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,793
- A story?

441
00:50:21,793 --> 00:50:23,040
- Yeah.

442
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:23,890
- And what about?

443
00:50:26,346 --> 00:50:28,680
- I don't know, anything, just a story.

444
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:30,763
Talk to me.

445
00:50:33,384 --> 00:50:35,384
- All right, yeah, okay.

446
00:50:38,561 --> 00:50:40,144
There was this guy.

447
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:46,660
He lived in this little old
town, just outside Liverpool.

448
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,913
It was full of closed-down factories,

449
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,050
and every morning he'd
get up and go to work

450
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,063
in this fish and chip joint.

451
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,883
He'd start at seven o'clock,

452
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:06,603
maybe cleaning all the
grease from the ovens.

453
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:13,650
And then at 12 o'clock
when the shop would open,

454
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:18,073
he'd start frying the fish
and watching the bubbles,

455
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,350
and he'd see the grease build up,

456
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,083
and build up, all over again.

457
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:33,173
He never had time to smoke a
cigarette or talk to anyone,

458
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,103
and at night, when the shop would close,

459
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,133
he'd go home to this
tiny little Council flat,

460
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,880
and he was so greasy and so
smelly, that he could never find

461
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,773
a girl that could stand him
for more than five minutes.

462
00:52:01,128 --> 00:52:05,211
And he'd dream, oh he
dreamed, that he could just

463
00:52:08,439 --> 00:52:13,022
walk out, and start all over
again, living for himself.

464
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,203
But every morning it
was the same old thing.

465
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,102
He'd just get up, and go to work,

466
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:32,363
and wipe and the blade of all the grease.

467
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:39,010
Until one day, while he was staring

468
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,070
at the oil bubbling in the pans,

469
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,713
he had this fucking explosion,

470
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:51,610
and for the first time in this

471
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,903
old chip shop's history,
the ovens blew up.

472
00:52:59,016 --> 00:53:01,833
Well, that sound would
never leave his memory.

473
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:05,723
And then guess what?

474
00:53:06,595 --> 00:53:08,481
- [Anna] What?

475
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:11,780
- That was the first time
he realized it was time

476
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,713
to get the fuck out and start living.

477
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,807
(chains clank)

478
00:53:28,807 --> 00:53:29,823
Settle down.

479
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:31,729
- I don't care and what are you

480
00:53:31,729 --> 00:53:34,146
going to do about it anyways?

481
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:38,804
I'm sick of this chain!

482
00:53:38,804 --> 00:53:42,658
- Bitch, listen to me, I
don't mean it all like that.

483
00:53:42,658 --> 00:53:43,991
- Let me go, go.

484
00:53:45,795 --> 00:53:48,712
- Get down, get down, love, for me?

485
00:53:53,872 --> 00:53:57,372
(intense pulsating music)

486
00:54:05,188 --> 00:54:06,855
- Jesus, get off me.

487
00:54:10,978 --> 00:54:12,645
- Can't you feel me?

488
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:15,628
- Fuck me, then fuck me.

489
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,220
(tense dramatic music)

490
00:54:47,925 --> 00:54:50,342
(Anna moans)

491
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,747
(engaging jazz music)

492
00:56:15,734 --> 00:56:18,151
(Anna pants)

493
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:37,558
Don't stop, don't stop.

494
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:51,489
(playful jazz music)

495
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:59,471
I'm so cold, I'm so cold.

496
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:12,234
I'm too warm, I'm too hot.

497
00:57:16,051 --> 00:57:18,568
I'm too hot, too hot.

498
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,485
No, no, no.

499
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:23,442
No, no!

500
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:26,012
No.

501
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:28,429
(Anna pants)

502
00:58:03,988 --> 00:58:07,155
(engaging jazz music)

503
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:46,649
- I'm getting rid of pain, yeah.

504
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:53,910
It's getting better.

505
00:58:59,682 --> 00:59:03,434
♪ Getting better ♪

506
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:06,485
♪ All the time ♪

507
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:08,185
- Keep away from me, motherfucker.

508
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:10,490
Just stay away.

509
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,143
Who the fuck are you anyways?

510
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:16,258
You tell me you are just a little shit

511
00:59:16,258 --> 00:59:21,258
from Liverpool, England
with fucking screwball ideas

512
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,650
and narrow, so narrow visions,

513
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:27,420
oh, if you only had an idea of how narrow

514
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,920
your little teeny, tiny fucking mind is

515
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:34,083
and you're trying to tell me what to do?

516
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:37,440
You can't even take care of your own self.

517
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,480
You wanna take care of me?

518
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,403
You haven't even got a place?

519
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:44,400
I mean, I don't get it.

520
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,210
Can't you see that all this is bullshit,

521
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,240
all of this, whatever you've been doing

522
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:53,937
It's a bunch of crap and how can anybody

523
00:59:53,937 --> 00:59:57,663
know what anybody else feels anyways?

524
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,373
Can you?

525
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,323
No, you're just an
arrogant son of a bitch.

526
01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:24,770
You're a pig.

527
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,890
I mean, Joshua

528
01:00:32,742 --> 01:00:33,575
- Mm-mm.

529
01:00:38,498 --> 01:00:40,165
- Can I have a puff?

530
01:00:42,691 --> 01:00:45,170
You're smoking that whole
cigarette aren't you.

531
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:49,330
Such a cheat, you know, you always cheat,

532
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:53,430
you cheated the other
time, that other time too,

533
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:56,455
the first time, do you remember?

534
01:00:56,455 --> 01:00:57,617
- I'm cheating.

535
01:00:57,617 --> 01:01:00,924
- Oh bananas, aha, I
don't feel like bananas.

536
01:01:00,924 --> 01:01:04,674
I don't wanna eat bananas
right now, go away.

537
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:08,541
Go away, leave it alone.

538
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,000
I'm still hurting, you know?

539
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:13,517
- No, no, oh, no, no.

540
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,490
- Back is, yes my back is.

541
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:31,932
(coughs)

542
01:01:31,932 --> 01:01:33,643
Drink some.

543
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:35,561
Now, I gotta pee.

544
01:01:35,561 --> 01:01:36,394
No.

545
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:41,333
- You gotta keep yourself hydrated.

546
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,023
It's really gross though.

547
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,567
It tastes like cranberry juice.

548
01:01:47,567 --> 01:01:48,567
- I love it.

549
01:01:50,357 --> 01:01:51,863
- That's not funny.

550
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:55,960
I mean I have to drink all this shit.

551
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:58,477
I don't even like alcohol.

552
01:01:58,477 --> 01:01:59,627
- Feel better, bird?

553
01:01:59,627 --> 01:02:00,460
- No.

554
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:06,813
- Okay, ow.

555
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:10,186
The ash just burned me.

556
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:13,861
Kiss it, you have to kiss it.

557
01:02:13,861 --> 01:02:14,772
- Why?

558
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,750
- You have to kiss it.

559
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,163
Yeah, that's right.

560
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,660
I'm gonna go, Joshua, let me,
I have to lie down somewhere.

561
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:28,592
I don't feel all that good.

562
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:33,410
Watch, you're gonna smoosh the banana.

563
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:35,388
Did we put the ashes in here?

564
01:02:35,388 --> 01:02:39,223
Oh that's great, that's just wonderful.

565
01:02:40,128 --> 01:02:41,080
- Both of us knew.

566
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,580
- You wanna natural and that's real good.

567
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,093
Delicatessen, you should try
this, natural and banana.

568
01:02:50,677 --> 01:02:52,453
It's my recipe.

569
01:02:55,236 --> 01:02:57,319
(laughs)

570
01:02:59,715 --> 01:03:01,585
Is it good or what?

571
01:03:01,585 --> 01:03:03,290
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

572
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,530
I'm serious I wanna go back to bed.

573
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:06,363
Let me go.

574
01:03:07,462 --> 01:03:09,462
What did you do with this chain anyways?

575
01:03:10,538 --> 01:03:11,990
- I'm not gonna let you go.

576
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,530
- My hand cramps.

577
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,950
Can't you take them off me?

578
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:16,454
- No.

579
01:03:16,454 --> 01:03:18,570
- Can't you take 'em off me now.

580
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,763
Please?

581
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:20,596
- No.

582
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:23,577
- Can't you open them
up and let me go there.

583
01:03:23,577 --> 01:03:26,600
Look, I'm all bruised and so sore.

584
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,903
Now, it's really hurting.

585
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,340
I hate you, I hate you.

586
01:03:32,627 --> 01:03:33,460
- I like it.

587
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:37,273
- You're doing this to me and
I didn't even ask you for it.

588
01:03:37,273 --> 01:03:38,106
Witch.

589
01:03:39,856 --> 01:03:42,023
(kicking)

590
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:49,102
Anna lay down, Anna.

591
01:03:51,823 --> 01:03:52,656
Ah yes.

618
01:07:05,285 --> 01:07:06,480
- Hey, this place is still

619
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,960
looking as funky as it always did, man.

620
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,793
- Yeah, I know

621
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:13,860
- So, where have you been for
the last couple of days, man?

622
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,720
I haven't seen you around like.

623
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,720
Like somebody, something,
knight in shining armor?

624
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:25,330
Ah, can I have a seat?

625
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:26,870
- Sure, you can go ahead.

626
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:28,603
- Oh wow.

627
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,320
- I was just here.

628
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,886
- You know that girl, Monica, your friend?

629
01:07:34,886 --> 01:07:36,229
- [Anna] Right.

630
01:07:36,229 --> 01:07:40,539
- Right, well she owes me
200 bucks from last month.

631
01:07:40,539 --> 01:07:42,074
- [Anna] Does she?

632
01:07:42,074 --> 01:07:43,630
- And she's telling me now
that she doesn't have it

633
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,610
and she doesn't have to pay me.

634
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:48,320
I mean, what am I gonna do, you know?

635
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,205
I gotta pay my suppliers, man,

636
01:07:50,205 --> 01:07:52,990
And this girl's not going to pay me

637
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:54,983
and I'm in a lot of trouble, you know?

638
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:58,440
So, essentially what happens

639
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,993
is she's putting me in a bad spot,

640
01:08:01,846 --> 01:08:04,270
and this is the last time I'm gonna

641
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:06,593
be letting people me
fuck around like this.

642
01:08:07,714 --> 01:08:08,940
You know what I mean?

643
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:09,773
This is the last time I'm letting

644
01:08:09,773 --> 01:08:11,773
anybody fuck me around like this,

645
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,325
but you know, I'm not talking about you.

646
01:08:16,325 --> 01:08:17,158
You're too sweet.

647
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:20,613
- Yeah, sure, Charlie.

648
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:28,820
- So come over here, man, have a seat.

649
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:29,653
I got something.

650
01:08:31,230 --> 01:08:32,980
I've been hanging on to this stuff.

651
01:08:34,769 --> 01:08:35,950
I just got it in, great stuff, man.

652
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:40,747
I got the best in town,
air tight, China White.

653
01:08:42,608 --> 01:08:45,858
(tense dramatic music)

654
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:50,800
- [Waitress] Hey.

655
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,496
- Hi, I'm waiting for Charlie is he here?

656
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:56,935
- He's not here yet but
he should be here soon.

657
01:08:56,935 --> 01:08:58,519
Would you like some more coffee?

658
01:08:58,519 --> 01:09:00,269
- Oh, please, thanks.

659
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:12,203
- [Charlie] Here, come on.

660
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:16,503
- Charlie, I've gone cold turkey.

661
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:19,203
- What?

662
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,010
What are you talking about?

663
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:22,950
- I'm serious.

664
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:25,650
- Don't you know a good
gesture when you see one?

665
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:26,988
- Yeah, I do.

666
01:09:26,988 --> 01:09:31,400
- Look it, this stuff isn't
going to be around all the time.

667
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,161
You're gonna want it, man

668
01:09:33,161 --> 01:09:34,350
and you're gonna come looking for me.

669
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,863
So you might as well.

670
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:39,000
- No, I'm not Charlie, I want

671
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,783
to stay without it for a while.

672
01:09:40,783 --> 01:09:41,704
- [Charlie] What are
you talking about, man?

673
01:09:41,704 --> 01:09:42,730
- I want to stay without it for a while.

674
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:45,750
- Wait a second, whoa, hey.

675
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,153
Is anybody home?

676
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:52,530
I mean is anybody around
here, anybody anywhere?

677
01:09:52,530 --> 01:09:54,813
Hello, hello?

678
01:09:57,362 --> 01:09:58,195
Come on.

679
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:04,030
- No, Charlie, no, man,
what are you doing?

680
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,340
What the ruck are you doing?

681
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,850
I mean you've never shot up.

682
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:08,434
You don't know what it's like.

683
01:10:08,434 --> 01:10:10,293
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,

684
01:10:10,293 --> 01:10:12,481
wait a minute, wait a minute.

685
01:10:12,481 --> 01:10:13,731
Hello, anybody?

686
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,180
Oh, really?

687
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,013
Come on, man.

688
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:20,353
I mean, what's going on here?

689
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,083
Hey-

690
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:23,349
- Charlie.

691
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:24,182
- [Charlie] There's
somebody else isn't there.

692
01:10:24,182 --> 01:10:25,821
- Wait.

693
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:26,742
- [Charlie] What, wait a minute.

694
01:10:26,742 --> 01:10:27,575
Hang on.

695
01:10:27,575 --> 01:10:29,012
- [Charlie] Look it,
look it, don't care, man.

696
01:10:29,012 --> 01:10:29,845
Here, you know.

697
01:10:29,845 --> 01:10:30,678
- Charlie, go to hell.

698
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:34,680
- Go to hell?

699
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,290
- Yes, fuck off.

700
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,400
- Is that what's really going on here?

701
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,230
You know what, man?

702
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,750
I know what's going on here, man.

703
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,652
It's this fucking, you know what,

704
01:10:44,652 --> 01:10:45,980
you can have his fucking
necklace too, man,

705
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,260
because the mother fucker's gonna

706
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:49,830
be around here in a
couple of minutes anyways.

707
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:51,880
You know, that's what's really happening.

708
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,673
Hey?

709
01:10:57,724 --> 01:10:59,077
- [Anna] I don't mean to shut you out.

710
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,603
- Hey, come back over here.

711
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,680
Anna, come on, come
over here and sit down.

712
01:11:12,342 --> 01:11:15,031
Come over here and sit down.

713
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:16,448
- I'm sorry, man.

714
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:21,242
- Look, you know, you're
still a wildcat, man.

715
01:11:30,172 --> 01:11:33,672
(engaging dramatic music)

716
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:14,868
- Anna?

717
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:20,944
Anna, what's a matter?

718
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,093
Anna, baby doll.

719
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:30,136
Oh, baby.

720
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:37,347
What the fuck has he done to you?

721
01:12:44,837 --> 01:12:47,420
Anna come on, come on, wake up.

722
01:12:49,801 --> 01:12:50,973
