1
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,333
He was just the most fascinating
person I've ever met in my life.

2
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,366
He was Malachi Martin.
There is one Malahi Martin.

3
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:13,799
He drew you in.

4
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,100
Very, very charming.

5
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:24,800
He was a warrior for God
and he still is a warior for God.

6
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:31,800
He was a great mythomaniac.
He was a liar and a scoundrel.

7
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
And a cheat.

8
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:36,733
Good evening.
Tonight we have a vey special geust

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,000
and it's my true honour and pleasure
to have made his acquaintance.

10
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,699
He is considered one of
the most knowledgeable experts

11
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,033
on the Vatican in the world.

12
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,400
He is, first of all,
a very eminent theologian.

13
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:50,000
Expert on the Catholic Church,
former Jesuit,

14
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:53,199
and proffessor at the the Vatican's
Pontifical Biblical Institute.

15
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:57,333
He is author of national bestsellers
<i>Vatican: The Final</i> Conclave,

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
<i>Hostage To The Devil</i> and <i>The Jesuits.</i>

17
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:01,499
He is also an exorcist.

18
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:06,099
Exorcism, that is a healing.

19
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:10,200
And it's a very horrid healing.
But it does heal.

20
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,066
Inside, it is a living hell.

21
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,466
It's a living hell.

22
00:02:20,633 --> 00:02:23,266
The truth is,
whether we like it or not,

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,400
the Devil does exist.

24
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:28,341
He is out there, he is our enemy,

25
00:02:28,866 --> 00:02:30,133
and he hates us.

26
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,700
His aim is th destroy our souls.

27
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,700
This is a reality that does exist.

28
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:39,600
It's not everybody
but there are real cases.

29
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,266
That's why the rite of exorcism exists.

30
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,033
If the Church didn't believe it,
it wouldn't do it.

31
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,733
It wouldn't even worry about it.

32
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,166
I don't belieive that words teach.

33
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,633
Words don't teach.

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,333
Experience teaches.

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,000
I think people have to have
their own experiences.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I also know that once someone
encounters that evil presence,

37
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:05,333
They know

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,266
They know what exists and what doesn't.

39
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:14,266
There is a lot of scurrilous
information out there on the Internet

40
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,433
about Malachi that basically
maligns him,

41
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,000
his character as well as
himself, his person.

42
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,400
And this is part of
setting the record straight.

43
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:26,366
In addition to being my friend,
he was a good and holy man.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,066
I just want to set the record
straight on that.

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
We did not talk
an awful lot about his exorcism

46
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,800
except the last one.

47
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:39,266
I kept asking him not to do it.

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,133
And he kept saying,

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,666
"I am only going to be an assistant."

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,766
Not much chance of that.

51
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,666
An exorcist has to be
a very holy priest.

52
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,000
Protected by graces of the Church.

53
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,500
And I think, again,
in that last exorcism

54
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:02,133
that he was involved with,

55
00:04:03,066 --> 00:04:05,533
I still believe that Malachi
was the target.

56
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,300
Not that little girl.
She was the bait.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,533
Is it the way we saw it in <i>The Exorcist</i>?

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,466
That's a purely fictional account
based on no fact.

59
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,233
I've never seen the head
turning back 180 degrees.

60
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,600
Perhaps we could begin

61
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,633
by you telling us a bit about yourself,

62
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,033
your background,

63
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,400
 and some of the activities
that you are currently engagedin.

64
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,100
I think Iam going to bore you
but sombody listening to this tape

65
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,400
doesn't know about me so I suppose
we should cover the essentials.

66
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,300
I was born in Ireland, in Kerry,
70 years ago.

67
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,633
70 years ago. Don't forget
the 70, seven-zero.

68
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,266
I was educated in Ireland
and I joined the Jesuits in Ireland,

69
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,300
just before the war began,
and then after the war,

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,700
having done my philosophy,
they sent me to Belgium

71
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,566
for my studies, and then,
when I was finished,

72
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,633
they posted me to Rome
to the Pontifical Biblical Institute.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,133
That's an institute in the Vatican
which trains professors of scripture.

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
It's fallen on evil days
asregards doctrine.

75
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:35,000
If you were an American Catholic in 1955,

76
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:37,200
the world would have looked
extraordinary to you.

77
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,666
Huge nembers of converts
were flowing into the Chuch.

78
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,700
Church were being built
at a huge rate.

79
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:43,500
Then the Vatican Council took place,

80
00:05:43,566 --> 00:05:46,033
which was to renew
and reinvigorate the Church,

81
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,166
which was already growing hugely.

82
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:51,133
And BANG, within couple of years,
it all goes terribly wrong.

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Churches are being closed.

84
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:55,133
Nuns and Priests
flocking out of the church.

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,566
The religious orders are winding down.

86
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:01,500
Every social problem which the Catholic
Church felt it had already solved

87
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:03,233
came back to bite it.

88
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:07,000
The Council was not
a boy-scout jamboree.

89
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:12,066
It was a collection of very human beings

90
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:15,400
who were involved in a battle
for the future of the Church.

91
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:18,533
They were talking about making
the Church more human.

92
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:24,733
more up-to-date. More modern.
More with it.

93
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:28,633
More of sevices to the world
instead of to dominate.

94
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,566
That was a vey exciting time
in the history of the Church.

95
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,200
Malachi Martin
was of immense in helping me

96
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,633
discover some of those people
who were out there making it happen.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,233
Making the revolution happen.

98
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,533
-This was Vatican II?
-Vatican II.

99
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,033
1962 to 1965, formented
by the popes in question.

100
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:54,166
And by the cardinals.

101
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:57,666
The spirit amongst them was,
at all cost,

102
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:01,200
bt all means,
let's get with the world.

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,800
We've been isolated.
Let's modernise everything

104
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:08,266
And in order to do that,
in the Vatican Council,

105
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:15,333
they jettissoned sacred traditions
that had always been traditions

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,766
in the Catholic Church
back to the time of the first popes.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,166
In the first century.

108
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,133
He was from Ireland.

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,233
He was um...

110
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,433
came from quite a large
brood of childen

111
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:32,400
As far as I know, he had only
one sister. I may be wrong.

112
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:34,200
But he had a number of brothers,

113
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:37,166
all of whom became rather
well-read and religious,

114
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:40,333
Catholic-religious in their own right.

115
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,700
The Martine brothers.
And Malachi was no slouch either.

116
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:46,400
He was following, pretty much
in his brothers' tradition.

117
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:50,633
He was like a young,
clerical Indiana Jones,

118
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,766
crawling around caves in the Middle East.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,666
He was one of the original people

120
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,366
who helped decipher
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

121
00:07:56,566 --> 00:07:58,433
He spoke multiple languages.

122
00:07:59,434 --> 00:08:03,075
He was always
an unswervingly loyal Cathilic.

123
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,000
Loyal to the Papacy.
Loyal to our Lady in Christ.

124
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:09,566
That formed fis belief system
down to his core.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,266
He definitely cut a very sexy figure.

126
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:19,666
At parties,
he would be the life of the party.

127
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,666
Telling his dirty jokes.

128
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,200
I became a good detective,

129
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,066
as I was, in fact,
a good correspondent for <i>Time</i> magazine.

130
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:34,066
I got to the bottom of everything.

131
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,299
He had all stories,

132
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,566
some of which
even turned out to be true!

133
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:47,166
Kaiser was a stringer for <i>Time</i> magazine

134
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:49,766
during Vatican Council II.

135
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:54,266
Kaiser was very deeply involved
with the Jesuits.

136
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,666
The Jesuits had always been afraid

137
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,233
that when Malachi left,

138
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,566
he would just spill the beans
about everybody.

139
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,533
Because he knew about everybody
in Rome.

140
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,500
So, I think that they decided

141
00:09:08,566 --> 00:09:10,066
that they would get him
befoe he could get them.

142
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:15,100
And all of that came together
to fuel Kaiser's means

143
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,133
by which he was able
to express the hatred

144
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,633
and do as much damage
as he felt he could do to Malachi.

145
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:27,466
I just got deeper into the character
of Malachi Martin.

146
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,700
And so I wrote this book.

147
00:09:30,033 --> 00:09:31,500
It's called <i>Clerical Error</i>.

148
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:36,066
And the error was not only his error,

149
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:40,000
but mine in not being alive enough
to the reality.

150
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:44,200
I decided that this was
too good a story to pass up

151
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:46,033
and that only I
could tell it,

152
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,266
because only I had the whole story
in hand

153
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:53,733
Only I had the willingness

154
00:09:54,766 --> 00:09:58,000
to dig to the bottom of the story

155
00:09:58,066 --> 00:09:59,433
and get it out there.

156
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,633
And so

157
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,733
I thought it might even
make a good movie.

158
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:07,466
I would probably make
a good documentary.

159
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,466
Because it is a fascinating tale.

160
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,033
True or not.

161
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,200
He made it clear that reason
why he left the Jesuit order,

162
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:23,766
in particular was because
in the 1930s,

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,633
the Jesuits, as with a lot
of other organisations back then,

164
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,300
took a vey hard0eft turn,

165
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,666
and I asked, I said,
"So, you could say
that after Vatican II, Mal,

166
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,166
the Jesuits were in left field?"

167
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,766
And he kind of smiled and said,
"No, they weren't in left field.

168
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,875
They were outside the baseball stadiem."

169
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,633
Pope John said he thought
that Malachi sould leave Rome.

170
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,766
Not the priesthood but leave Rome.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,300
Because he said,

172
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,433
"If you stay..."

173
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,633
Iam saying this on camera, but anyway...
"If you stay,

174
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:59,666
you will become another fat cardinal
with another mistress
living outside of Rome."

175
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:04,733
He thought the best way for him
to remedy this

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,366
from his own perspective

177
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,700
was to get a document
 from Pope Paul VI

178
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:12,300
that he called a rescript in Latin.

179
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,600
What that did was release him
from two of his three vows as a priest.

180
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,600
It release him
from the vow of obedience.

181
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,466
So he could leave the Jesuit order.

182
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:25,033
And It release him
from the vow of poverty,

183
00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,633
because he would then
be able to make his way

184
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,033
pursuing a secular lifestyle
as an author in the West.

185
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,000
The only one of his vows that he kept to
and maintained until he died

186
00:11:35,066 --> 00:11:37,566
was his vow of chasity.

187
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,733
He maintained that until his death.

188
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,700
Priests ae human beings,
first of all.

189
00:11:47,766 --> 00:11:51,366
Human beings go through
all sorts of changes of mood

190
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:52,600
throughout their lives.

191
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,700
Privacy and the respecting of someone's
privacy is absoultely paramount.

192
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:02,200
Because I know that the relationship
between a priest

193
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:04,700
and his superior includes
all sorts of private information.

194
00:12:05,466 --> 00:12:09,266
And I know that priest are
frequently given dispensations.

195
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,166
I personally would like
to see more evidence

196
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,033
that he was released
from two but not from three vows.

197
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,233
i simply would find it unsual

198
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,066
that ha had been realeased
from two and not from the third.

199
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:42,533
In 1964, I came over to America
and became an American citizen,

200
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,733
and I settle down in New York
and I write books here.

201
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,166
I do TV and radio.

202
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,366
You have written
a lot of books,

203
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:53,333
and particularly the books concerning
Roman Catholicism

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,000
and the Vaticans.

205
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:56,766
That's right.

206
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:02,000
When he first came, he had
no money, he had nothing.

207
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,733
He earned money the way he could.

208
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,266
He washed dishes and drove a cab.

209
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,166
He did what he could to make a living.

210
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:14,000
He worked at the Encyclopedia Britannica

211
00:13:14,066 --> 00:13:15,300
but he did not ike that.

212
00:13:15,366 --> 00:13:19,700
He said it was justing taking
somebody else's knowledge
and stuffing it in a book.

213
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,100
He didn't want to do that.
He wanted to his own work.

214
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,166
So, that didn't work out for him.

215
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,066
When I met him,

216
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:32,566
it wasn't his plan to
be a writer.

217
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:37,033
And I began to talk to him
about a writing career.

218
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,000
I said that if he would give me

219
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:42,666
a certain amount of time,
I would make him a successful writer.

220
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,233
But it takes time to do that.

221
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,733
He and I worked together then
for  years.

222
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,500
As friends, and first I was
his editor and publisher,

223
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:59,533
and when I left
the publishing ide of publishing,

224
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,233
to become an agent,
he became my client.

225
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,800
I say mass every morning.

226
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,533
I'm a priest. I say my breviary.

227
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,541
The usual things.

228
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,333
That's about the sun total of it all.

229
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,633
I've published 15 books.

230
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
I am preparing a 16th.

231
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:17,266
That's my life story.
It's very uneventful.
But it's my life.

232
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,166
This is a man with a very clear anlysis
of what is happening.

233
00:14:23,233 --> 00:14:26,466
He is putting words
to people's sense of unease

234
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,700
at the apparent implosion
of this perfect, huge church,

235
00:14:29,766 --> 00:14:32,633
which, let's remember,
until a few years previously,

236
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,533
Catholicism was claiming it would be
the official religion of America.

237
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,766
Here comes Malachi Martin,
with all his skills,

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
analysis, intelligence and eloquence,

239
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:43,300
giving answers,

240
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,800
and that is why
he made suh a huge impact

241
00:14:46,033 --> 00:14:49,266
and that's why many people
found he was a natural leader for them.

242
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:55,766
There is a new generation of people
who don't know what they should believe.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
The Catholic Church's only strength
was unity.

244
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,200
Unity.

245
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:01,133
It's gone.

246
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:13,000
First off, people would
kill to be with Malachi Martin.

247
00:15:13,066 --> 00:15:16,433
He meant a lot of people.
He brought the faith to them.

248
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,700
My first encounter with Father Martin
was a result of a priest

249
00:15:19,766 --> 00:15:22,533
We both knew
at St.Agnes Church in New York.

250
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,200
We were chatting one evening and he said,
"Would you like to meet Malachi?

251
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:28,333
I know him.
You can share a meal with him."

252
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
We just got fairly well acquainted
over the course of that dinner.

253
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:36,933
In fact, it went so late that they
politely asked us around 23:30

254
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,633
would we mind leaving the restaurant
because the staff wanted to go home?

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,633
He was that kind of storyteller.

256
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,800
He was a very gentle, soft person.

257
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,866
He had a charming Irish accent

258
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,366
which absolutely fascinated me.

259
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I never knew him like an equal.

260
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:57,300
To me, he was a mentor,
he was an advisor,

261
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,700
he was a spiritual director,

262
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:00,233
somebody I looked up to.

263
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,400
But he wasn't a friend, like
a colleague on the same level.

264
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,166
He was a friend,
and a very dear friend.

265
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:15,000
The fact that he was there
when my daughter died.

266
00:16:15,466 --> 00:16:17,733
She was a newborn.
She only lived two weeks.

267
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:22,200
I wouldn't have been able
to hold it together,
I think, if Father Martin
hadn't been there.

268
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:25,100
And again, he didn't have to do that.
It was the middle of the night.

269
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,533
He jumped in a cab
and came all the way downtown

270
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,933
to be with us,
and to accompany us,

271
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,066
as we spent my daughter's
final moments here,

272
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,733
and as she... went on.

273
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,100
Tonight, I want to get off on a little bit
different tangent

274
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:46,033
and talk about your past experiences
as an exorcist.

275
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,566
Yes, that is a fascinating thing.

276
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,200
It's always fascinating
for a lot of people.

277
00:16:50,266 --> 00:16:52,066
We must tell them beforehand

278
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:57,066
that exorcism and possession
is not a joy,

279
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,333
is not a happy thing.

280
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:01,900
Possession is a dirty, insalubrious,

281
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:06,133
unhealthy, mucky
and unpleasant situation

282
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,400
where you come across it.

283
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:09,733
But it is a necessary evil
in the sense that

284
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,800
we have to deal with it
once we meet people with it.

285
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,466
I met him one afternoon

286
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,099
and he had a  fresh cuton his forehead
and I asked him what had hapened.

287
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:23,099
He said  he was at an exorcism

288
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,866
and a foot stool came flying
through the air and hithim in the head

289
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,033
It's cost me a lot.

290
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,966
it's cost me two broken legs.

291
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,800
...Almost broken kneecaps.

292
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:35,433
And...a...

293
00:17:36,266 --> 00:17:38,266
It endangered my life several times.

294
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,433
But I wasn't supposed to die.

295
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,166
Not yet.

296
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,366
And um...

297
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:46,766
It cost me a lot of hate.

298
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:51,200
A lot of my friends turned away.

299
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:55,133
They wouldn't walk with me
mo more, as the saying goes.

300
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,466
You'll give but you'll never
get back again.

301
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:01,266
Some bit of you dies
with every exorcism.

302
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:04,533
With everything she does,
some bit of her is consumed

303
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,200
and goes away,
I don't know where it goes.

304
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:10,133
God stores it up for you
and you are finally reunited

305
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,600
but you lose that value
that you use up.

306
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,800
You're use up.

307
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,633
It's all over.

308
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,200
You pay a price for anything decent
you do in this life.

309
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,466
And you don't get it back.

310
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,166
You're ennobled by it.
Strengthened by it.

311
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,700
Made more human by it.
More noble.

312
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:28,100
But you don't get it back.

313
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,400
After the Second Vatican Council,

314
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:36,200
a lot of people believed that

315
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:38,300
the baby was thrown out
with the bathwater.

316
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:42,633
From...the integral centre of
 the faith was concerned.

317
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,300
Malachi was one of them.

318
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:47,466
He saw a lot of what he called
"the nonsense" going on.

319
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:51,300
And it also led to a general decline,

320
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:53,633
basically, in people's beliefs
in central things.

321
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,233
Including the existence of evil
and existence of the Devil.

322
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,766
Because in the wake
of all the changes in the 1960s,

323
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,566
people wanted to focus
on flowery love, forgiveness,

324
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,633
puppies in the sunshine,
and all that stuff.

325
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:13,866
We find out the majority of bishops in
this country didn't believe in the Devil,

326
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:14,500
didn't believe in exorcism.

327
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,066
Had dropped that idea.

328
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,700
So we said we'd have an underground.
We set up anunderground of exorcists

329
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,566
throughout the country.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,866
And...

331
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,833
we...

332
00:19:25,366 --> 00:19:27,200
That's how I got into it.

333
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,466
I've stopped sending them
to certain bishops now.

334
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,366
They send them off  to see a shrink,
go to a home, rest up, get drugs.

335
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,400
And it only makes them worse.

336
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:43,633
Make it worse.
it's a terrible plight.

337
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,700
God and Satan cannot coexist.

338
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:52,133
I mean you cannot

339
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:55,266
you cannot worship
both of them.

340
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,633
You have to choose,

341
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,800
Malachi often said
that Satan and Christ
divide the world between them.

342
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:05,200
And the Church needs to make it very clear

343
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,566
who she is and what  she stands for.

344
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,766
"When the Church asks publicly

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,133
and authoritatively
in the name of Jesus Christ

346
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,300
that a person or an object be protected
against the power of the evil one,

347
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:26,066
and withdrawn from his dominion,
it is called exorcism.

348
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,300
Exorcism is directed
at the expulsion of demons

349
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,666
or to the liberation
from demonic possession

350
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,033
through the spiritual authority

351
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,633
with which Jesus en trusted his church."

352
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,800
In the Catholic ceremony of exorcism,

353
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,200
we perform an exorcism,

354
00:20:43,266 --> 00:20:45,433
not a type of exorcism or a blessing.

355
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,533
It is an exorcism.

356
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,500
There are two types of exorcism
in the Catholic Church.

357
00:20:49,566 --> 00:20:51,500
The type that we perform
at every baptism

358
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:53,766
and then the type
we don't talk about very often.

359
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,800
We were taught as children that God
 existed

360
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,666
and that the Devil existed,

361
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:02,000
and that God was more powerful
than the Devil.

362
00:21:03,033 --> 00:21:04,433
I know that...

363
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:10,066
he can't be quite as candid
as he was with us

364
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:13,066
cos there's tapes and there's video.

365
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,766
But he is going to be very open.

366
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,566
I was going to classes

367
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:21,333
with Ed and Lorraine Warren.
Lorraine siad,

368
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,366
"Next week, Malachi Martin
is coming to speak with us."

369
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,066
I had no idea who he was.

370
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,866
She said he was an exorcist.

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,500
I thought, that's the coolest thing ever.
i can't wait.

372
00:21:29,566 --> 00:21:32,766
I specifically chose to sit
in the back of the room

373
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,600
because I didn't want to hog
the spotlight in the front.

374
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:38,766
He spoke for an hour and a half or so.

375
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:43,333
At the end, a few of us got in line
to get our books autographed or say hi.

376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,266
He immediately kept staring at me
down the line.

377
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,666
and...

378
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I thought, oh, boy.

379
00:21:50,766 --> 00:21:54,600
When he finally got to me,
he pointed to me

380
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:57,166
"Were you sitting in that back corner there?"

381
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,333
I said "yes",

382
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,633
He said, " You were
distracting me the whole time."

383
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:02,266
I said "what?"

384
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
He says, "You have a glow about you.

385
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,300
You are throwing off lights
like I have never seen before."

386
00:22:08,033 --> 00:22:10,633
He said, "You are my favorite
person in this room right now."

387
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,300
He goes, "It's an honour to meet you."

388
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:13,400
An honour to meet me?

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,100
He made me feel so special that day

390
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,800
that I still remember whathe said.
I think about all the time.

391
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:25,200
They...lionized him.

392
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:29,533
They brought him to the various
churches around the USA

393
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,333
and paid him nice lecture fees.

394
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:38,500
They got him book contracts
to write these funny books.

395
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,733
They weren't funny.
They were just weird.

396
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,166
Books that told these people
what they wanted to hear.

397
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,033
He parlayed this into profit.

398
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,033
My name is Ralph Sarchie.

399
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,166
Iam a retired New York City
police sergeant.

400
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:56,733
also a demonologist.

401
00:22:57,366 --> 00:22:59,666
Father Malachi Martin was my mentor

402
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:02,566
When I first started out
in what I call "work."

403
00:23:04,033 --> 00:23:05,333
Iam a religious demonologist,

404
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,133
meaning that I approach this field
from a religious point of view.

405
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,200
I've assisted at exorcism.

406
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,766
And I investigates of demonic activity

407
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,433
and demonic possession.

408
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,400
Usually, Iam the first guy to go
in there to see if it's a genuine case.

409
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,266
If it is, then we set up an exorcism.

410
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,033
All through my career,
I saw a lot of crazy things,

411
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,133
But it wasn't what I experiences as a cop
 that led me into the field of demonology.

412
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:40,566
It was more of an interest that went

413
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,733
a lot further than just reading books.

414
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
I actually got involved in it

415
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:48,466
and I was involved
with all the right people

416
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:52,266
in order to get to the point
when I am at in the field.

417
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,533
I try not to get emotionally involved
with my cases.

418
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,366
I can make mistakes when that happens.

419
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:06,033
I get emotionally involved
with people to a certain degree.

420
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Because you know,

421
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:11,100
As Father Martin says,

422
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,200
in the studies that he did,
there is no common denominator

423
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:17,133
between all of these people who have had
genuine cases of possession

424
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
or genuine cases of infestation
in their homes.

425
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:23,500
There is no common denominator
between these peolple

426
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:25,666
except for one thing : they all suffer.

427
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:29,300
It's the suffering that's difficult,
 because...

428
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,366
sometimes I get a case
and it takes me a few months to get there.

429
00:24:37,233 --> 00:24:39,466
So...this is um...

430
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,666
one of the cops at work
arrested this guy.

431
00:24:43,366 --> 00:24:45,800
I think, the guy was theatening him

432
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:48,533
-Is there more coffee there?

433
00:24:49,366 --> 00:24:51,800
Well, I look at this way :

434
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:55,233
God puts people in your path
to teach you

435
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,766
and to direct you in what he needs.

436
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:02,133
And to serve his will properly.

437
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:05,233
And Father Martin had that place.

438
00:25:10,266 --> 00:25:12,300
Basically, it was selfishness on my part,

439
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:14,433
the way I bacame his de facto driver

440
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,533
because he knew I had
a perfectly good working Jeep

441
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:21,600
and that we had a great time
whenever we were together,

442
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:23,366
talking, chatting, sharing

443
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:25,800
either a burger or a pizza. Whatever.

444
00:25:27,366 --> 00:25:30,600
And I just made it known to him, I said :
"Mal, if you ever need to go anywhere,

445
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,733
I'd like mine to be
the first number you dial.

446
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,400
Because I am going to pick up
and it's always going to be a yes."

447
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:44,133
I had spoken with
Father Martin years prior

448
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:46,500
about children.

449
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:49,000
And the things that he had

450
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,433
told me is that...

451
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,766
God is going to allow  more children
to become possessed genuinely

452
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
because of a chastisement
towards the parents.

453
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:03,500
And he said : "when you start
to see that happening,

454
00:26:03,566 --> 00:26:05,333
that's when there is a turning point."

455
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,700
So I have been watching

456
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,100
and I have seen a rise in child possession.

457
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:13,466
Basically, within the last few years.

458
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,733
We also have this new phenomenon

459
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,633
called the demonic possession of children.

460
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,800
-Demonic possession of children?

461
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:25,133
-Three, four, five, six.

462
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,200
-Good heavens.
-Very frightening. Very fightening.

463
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:31,733
That morning,

464
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
when I got a phone call
from Father Malachi,

465
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,500
I actually thought that he was
calling to confirm our birthday lunch

466
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,766
that was going to happen
in a couple of weeks.

467
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,700
Instead, he asked me would I be willing

468
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,066
to drive him up Dr.Coomaraswamy's
to Connecticut.

469
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,233
I already knew the way,
having been up there several times.

470
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,700
So I said : "sure, I'd be happy to."

471
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,566
while we were on the way up there,
I said :

472
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,466
"What's the main reason
for us coming up here today?"

473
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,700
He said : "You are going
to drop me off,

474
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:02,066
because...two hours after you drop me off,

475
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:03,766
there will be a family arriving

476
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,066
and they have with them
their small daughter,

477
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:08,600
and she is apparently
very severely afflicted

478
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:11,000
with something, they believe,
to be demonic."

479
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,666
I said : "Well, it's good thing

480
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,800
Iam dropping you off
two hours ahead of time.

481
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:17,100
Because I don't want to be
anywhere near it."

482
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:40,566
For me to go back up there

483
00:27:41,233 --> 00:27:45,000
is basically to bring
a degree of calm to my soul.

484
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:47,733
If anything else.
Because...

485
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,533
I didn't know what the subsequent
 events were going to be
after we went up to Connecticut.

486
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,000
He probably had a good idea

487
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:56,000
but he didn't tell me the whole
length and breadth of it.

488
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,133
 There's very little truth
known about the Devil.

489
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
We do know from the Church
and from scripture

490
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:10,466
that Satan was one of the brightest
and most intelligent of the archangels.

491
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:12,266
Now, he did, though, rebel.

492
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:16,300
And apparently, there was a battle
between the good angels,

493
00:28:16,366 --> 00:28:19,533
led by Michael the archangel,
against Lucifer,

494
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,133
the light-bearer, the son of the dawn.

495
00:28:22,766 --> 00:28:26,666
So, he was defeated and condemned
to what we call "hell".

496
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:28,700
As far as we know,

497
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:31,433
God does love purity.

498
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,666
He does love compassion.
He loves beauty.

499
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:37,200
Look at the beautiful things,
he has created in nature.

500
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:40,766
But, God, in all those  things,
he has one great preference.

501
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,600
Repentance.

502
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:45,133
He loves to exercise mercy.

503
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:49,666
How could he do that unless people who are tempted

504
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:52,500
and he had forgive them?
He didn't want a perfect world.

505
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,566
He wanted to have a world
in which he could exercise mercy.

506
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:59,000
So he gave Satan the power of tempting man.

507
00:29:01,666 --> 00:29:03,500
I'm told that there's a Devil.

508
00:29:03,566 --> 00:29:06,300
The Bible said so.
Jesus even said so.

509
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:10,300
The Pope often refers to the Devil
as a real person.

510
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,700
For all my love of Pope Francis,

511
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:14,733
I do not.

512
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,533
But Iam not prepared to say

513
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,766
that he's wrong and I'm right.

514
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,200
I will find out. I look forward
to my days

515
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:28,233
very soon...when I will embarked
on a new adventure,

516
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,133
finding out the answers

517
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:33,666
to all these questions that I've had
all my life

518
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:35,300
and didn't know the answers to.

519
00:29:36,766 --> 00:29:38,333
If you deny the Devil,

520
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,266
if you deny the existence of Lucifer,

521
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:45,133
if you deny the existence of sin, of hell, eternal punishment,

522
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:49,166
you automatically deny Christ's salvation.

523
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:50,100
In fact,

524
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,766
you can't deny the existence of Lucifer
without being led inevitably

525
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,533
to deny the divinity and
function of Christ, our saviour.

526
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,333
What's the purpose in Christ coming?

527
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,466
To make a nice land,
to give us happy lives?

528
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:03,533
No, no! He came to save us from sin.

529
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,633
S-I-N.

530
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:12,633
The Church exists to answer real needs.
If those needs are not answered,

531
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,500
people simply walk away
and find the answers

532
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,500
they are looking for.
I can imagine a situation,

533
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,333
in the atmosphere of
the 1970s in New York,

534
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,266
where those needs were being expressed,

535
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:26,533
people were being turned away by priests,

536
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,433
being told that we'd moved on
from those old superstitions.

537
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,233
And yet people hadn't moved on
from that sense of affliction.

538
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:36,666
If those people, or even one of them
presented themselves

539
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,008
to Malachi Martin, I have no doubt

540
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:40,233
that he would respond,
pastorally, as a priest.

541
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,766
When a human being is possessed,

542
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:49,466
what is the purpose
of the possession of an indivisual?

543
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:54,200
The destruction of that indivisual's soul

544
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:58,766
to such a point that it must end up in hell.

545
00:31:00,366 --> 00:31:03,266
I think everyone has
their own personal beliefs

546
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,132
about God and the Devil and spirituality.

547
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:08,966
But in terms of trying
to convince anyone,

548
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:12,100
I don't think we'd ever be
successful in convincing anyone.

549
00:31:12,166 --> 00:31:15,066
Because there is still
no real hardcore evidence.

550
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:18,133
We can't point to,
"There's the Devil right there".

551
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,000
We have no picture of him.

552
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:22,433
I think people are going
to be sceptical,

553
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,300
until they see that picture.

554
00:31:24,366 --> 00:31:26,800
And that's OK.
Scepticism is a healthy thing.

555
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:30,166
I would encourage that.
Don't accept anything at face value.

556
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:32,200
Question, question, question.

557
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,000
By turns he woould be talkative,

558
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:56,666
and by other turns he wouldn't be
 introspective
and get kind of quiet.

559
00:31:59,233 --> 00:32:01,033
And as we got closer,

560
00:32:01,633 --> 00:32:04,300
between him and I,
there was an unspoken tension.

561
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:07,500
We could feel that we were
approaching something.

562
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,666
And...

563
00:32:09,433 --> 00:32:13,466
You know, he had heard
my confession, my full confession,

564
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,000
about half an hour before,

565
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,233
So there was nothing weighing
on my conscience.

566
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:19,400
But still...

567
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,100
between the both of us,
there was really a sense of foreboding.

568
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:25,633
And I couldn't explain why.

569
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,700
My name is Matt Baglio.

570
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm the author of <i>The Rite:
The Making Of A Modern Exorcist.</i>

571
00:32:52,133 --> 00:32:56,333
Rom is really the capital
of exorcism in many ways.

572
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,233
I heard about this exorcism course,

573
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,633
which is really what brought me

574
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,466
into this topic of exorcism.

575
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:05,700
Before beginning the book,
I didn't know anything about exorcism.

576
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,666
I was very surprised

577
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:11,266
by a lot of  the things I learned.
Here, in Italy,

578
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,133
there is probably 20 people
undergoing an exorcism

579
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,533
in Rome right now.

580
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,700
Thisexorcism course that we have

581
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,633
here in Rome,  in our university,

582
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,800
was invented by a layman.

583
00:33:25,733 --> 00:33:28,100
This gave me also the opportunity to work

584
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:32,066
to work with a famous,
at least in Italy,

585
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,000
very famous exorcist

586
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:35,600
called Father Gabriele Amorth.

587
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,733
We try to give a general outlook
of exorcism.

588
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,600
So we speakon the rite...

589
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,533
and it's a liturgic part.

590
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,233
But we also speak on the medical aspects

591
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,733
to try to help the priest to understand

592
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,000
the difference between schizophrenia
and the possession.

593
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:59,633
Between a person that is
on the drugs or on depression

594
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,433
and true possession.

595
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,133
Today, the hierarchy of the Church -

596
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,366
who some support this course
and some don't -

597
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:12,033
I think, want a more
cautious approach.

598
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,400
They want to embrace modern medicine
and modern science

599
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:20,500
but at the same time,
not discount their own past

600
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:23,600
and their own belief
that exorcism

601
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:26,433
is necessary

602
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,500
in certain rare instances.

603
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,400
One of the topics of this course was to try
and reintroduce priests

604
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,066
to the traditional teachings

605
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:37,633
of the Catholic Church
on a topic like the Devil.

606
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,266
There's many Catholic priests
who don't believe in exorcism.

607
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,666
I found that surprising.

608
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:45,766
They don't believe in the Devil
as a personified entity.

609
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,166
Because the were thinking of things
like Hollywood films and such.

610
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:52,133
It's very easy to laughat that

611
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,566
and say, well, I don't
believe in that either.

612
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,700
They were trying to remind priests that...

613
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:01,200
this is something the Church believes in
and goes back to the Bible.

614
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,200
We see that Christ,
he was the first exorcist.

615
00:35:06,266 --> 00:35:11,266
He had many encounters with
persons possessed by the Devil.

616
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,333
We can read this scripture.

617
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,200
And he was able to cast out demons.

618
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,033
Then he gave this power to hus disciples.

619
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,333
The disciples were also able
to cast out demons.

620
00:35:29,466 --> 00:35:32,133
"No one my lawfully exorcise the possessesd

621
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,000
without the special and express
permission of the local ordinary.

622
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,733
Jesus performed exorcisms,
and from him,

623
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,700
the Church has received the power
and office of exorcising.

624
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,266
The solemn exorcism,
called a major exorcism,

625
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,533
can be performed only by a priest
and with the permission of the bishop.

626
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,566
The priest must proceed with prudence,

627
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:59,766
strictly observing the rules
established bu the Church.

628
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,766
Illness, especially psychological illness,

629
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
is a very different matter.

630
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,400
Treating this is the concern
of medical science.

631
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:16,600
Therefore, before an excorcism is performed
it's important to ascertain that one is dealing with

632
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
the presence of the Evil One
and not with an illness.

633
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,500
Anneliese Michel died of starvation at 23.

634
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:28,433
A religious student
who spoke in stange voices,

635
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,400
doctors said she had epilepsy.

636
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:32,100
But she thought it was the Devil.

637
00:36:33,008 --> 00:36:36,508
[woman mutters demonically]

638
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,500
And so did a panel of priests
who recorded the voices.

639
00:36:46,233 --> 00:36:49,066
The priests who followed
this 17th century ritual believed

640
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,466
that it worked,

641
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:53,400
that Annelieses was
spiritually healed
when she died.

642
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:56,100
But a Bavarian prosecutor
says this bishop,

643
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:57,533
who authorised the exorcism,

644
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,433
the priests who performed it,
and the parents who allowed it,

645
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,466
could face criminal-neglect charges

646
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:05,400
for failing to get medical help
for the starving woman.

647
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,066
With science,

648
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:16,233
you start with an open tablet.
And open slate.

649
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,300
And everything is included,
and you just go along,

650
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:21,766
and exclude different variables
as you can.

651
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,466
Each one was very different.

652
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:26,033
Each one was very specific
and individualised.

653
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:29,133
So, I would try to rule out
mental illness.

654
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,366
Just rule out different factors.

655
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,266
Cognitive functioning.

656
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:36,466
Any psychotropic medications.

657
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:39,533
Ill side effects they may be experiencing,
if at all.

658
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,566
I am not afraid on the sceptics

659
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:44,766
because Iam also a sceptic on myself.

660
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,533
I don't believe that just any person
that arrives,

661
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,200
"I'm possessed." I am very sceptical.

662
00:37:51,266 --> 00:37:56,133
And normal priest should be,
in a true sense, very sceptical.

663
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,133
To really grasp what it is.

664
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,166
And I can tell you that in my experiences,

665
00:38:01,233 --> 00:38:03,233
as an exorcist,

666
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:09,066
more than 90% of the persons
that arive to me as an exorcist

667
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:12,300
telling me that they have problems
with the Devil,

668
00:38:12,366 --> 00:38:14,366
they have no problems with the Devil
at all.

669
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,300
People say they are possessed all the time.
It doesn't make it true.

670
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,200
You have to rule it out.

671
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:21,566
Or rule it in.

672
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:27,600
[child] Then was brought unto him one
possessed with a devil,

673
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,366
 blind, and dumb.

674
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:31,133
And he healed him,

675
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,166
insomuch that the blind and dumb
both spoke and saw

676
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:36,766
And all the people were amazed and said :

677
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,700
"Is this not the son of David?"

678
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:41,766
But when the Pharisees heard, they said:

679
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,066
"This fellow doth not cast out devils,

680
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:46,600
but by Beelzebub the prince of devils."

681
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,533
And Jesus knew their thoughts
and said unto them:

682
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,533
"Every kingdom divided against itself
is brought to dissolution.

683
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,700
Every city or house divided against itself
shall not stand.

684
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,533
And if Satan casts out Satan,

685
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,533
he is divided against himself.

686
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,500
How shall then his kingdom stand?

687
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,000
And if I, by Beelzebub, cast out devils,

688
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:12,333
by whom do your children cast them?

689
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,600
Therefore, they shall be your judges."

690
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,533
We now know
that there are people who programmed

691
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,733
children at the age of two,

692
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,766
reinforced it at seven,
confirmed it at 14 and 21.

693
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,666
Programmed to...

694
00:39:30,233 --> 00:39:32,033
to worship Lucifer.

695
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:34,033
They become Luciferians.

696
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,600
They're turned out
by the thousands every years.

697
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,066
we know who does it, who'll do it,
we know when they do it,

698
00:39:40,133 --> 00:39:43,266
but we can't do anything about it.
It's a free country.

699
00:39:45,733 --> 00:39:48,666
It comes in various way.

700
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,466
The television has a lot to do with it.

701
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,366
Music has a lot to do it.

702
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,300
We have made a statistical survey
of the possessed people we've known

703
00:39:58,366 --> 00:39:59,766
and there are a lot of them.

704
00:40:00,366 --> 00:40:01,466
There's no ...

705
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,300
ethnic,

706
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:05,433
there's no religious,

707
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,366
there's no gender,

708
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,400
there's no intellectual,
there's no economic,

709
00:40:13,066 --> 00:40:14,266
there's no rule.

710
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:17,200
It's of some peculiar alchemy inside.

711
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,700
Because it creeps up to you slowly.

712
00:40:19,766 --> 00:40:21,733
Satan doesn't appear with a scroll
and says:

713
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,433
"You can have all these things
if you sell your soul to me."

714
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,233
Faustian, Mephistopheles.

715
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,333
It's not like that.

716
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,300
It's the simply things slowly but surely.

717
00:40:30,766 --> 00:40:32,133
And the possession then

718
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,366
becomes so that at a certain moment...

719
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,366
...you are under the command of something

720
00:40:38,433 --> 00:40:41,533
that takes possession of your will
bit by bit.

721
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,466
It's a slow process.
Until one day,

722
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:47,233
you can't say no
and you are possessed.

723
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,300
You are no longer free to choose.

724
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,466
How do you know
a perfectly possessed person?

725
00:40:57,766 --> 00:40:59,033
It's a leading question.

726
00:41:00,133 --> 00:41:02,766
Its a very easy question to answer
in one sense.

727
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:04,733
That...

728
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,666
is the test. By tests.

729
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,600
You know some, OK?

730
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,333
You might get involved with them.

731
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,066
You might even go to bed with her.

732
00:41:15,133 --> 00:41:17,566
You work in the office with him,
you know him socially,

733
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:19,566
and you know him, you think,

734
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,100
until one day,

735
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,766
something happens and...

736
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:23,808
[whistles]

737
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:27,300
...you suddenly see a person
you never knew.

738
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,233
It's momentary.

739
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:34,500
The window on the camera opens
into reality.

740
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:36,400
You'll see it and then it's closed again.

741
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:38,633
That's the way you know it. Otherwise,

742
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:41,600
they can be good fathers,
they can be good statesmen.

743
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,500
They can be good bankers.
They can have sexual probity.

744
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:46,633
Everything. But they're possessed.

745
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,233
Completely given over to Satan.

746
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:55,033
Malachi told me many times.

747
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,466
He said that he thought, as a society,

748
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,200
the West and the world were heading
towards some kind of tipping point.

749
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:04,666
He fully expected that possibly
during his lifetime, or after,

750
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:08,466
what he used to refer to as,
"after I'm playing the harp,"

751
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:11,266
that there was going to come
some kind of event

752
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:15,366
that would define the end of
what he called the Catholic era

753
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,800
as we know it.

754
00:42:18,233 --> 00:42:21,266
And because of that, he said
various events would be happening.

755
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:25,600
And possession, things like possessions,
would naturally increase as well.

756
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,433
I am sure you've all read that passage
in the Book of Deuteronomy where God says:

757
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,600
"This day, there are
two courses open to you.

758
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:35,200
And I'm telling you which one to follow."

759
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,733
On the one hand,
you can choose life and goodness.

760
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:43,233
One the other hand,
you can choose death and evil.

761
00:42:45,766 --> 00:42:48,500
I truely believe that what I'm seeing now

762
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:53,166
with all the things that I've heard,
all the things that I've read about,

763
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:56,466
this is the lull before the storm.

764
00:42:56,533 --> 00:43:00,433
Because I see us being taken in a direction

765
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,066
that father Martin basically described.

766
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:08,166
I don't like it one bit what's going on.

767
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,400
Over all and eveywhere,

768
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:14,800
throughout our community of nations today,
numbering roughly about five billion,

769
00:43:16,066 --> 00:43:20,166
and chiefly by legalised abortion
but also by contraception,

770
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:23,133
by euthanasia,
by condoned infanticide,

771
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,366
by deliberately formenting civil wars,

772
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,500
by endemic hunger,

773
00:43:27,566 --> 00:43:29,200
by the floods of refugees,

774
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,166
never before in the history of man

775
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:35,266
has the lifeblood of so many
been shed so violently,

776
00:43:35,333 --> 00:43:38,566
so mercilessly wasted as in our day.

777
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:42,400
We specialise in the death of masses
as a community of nations today,

778
00:43:42,466 --> 00:43:46,000
and we belong to that community
whether we like it or not.

779
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,733
So, anti-life, surely, that's us

780
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,233
We are anti-life.

781
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,666
Bloodstained guilt, surely.

782
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:58,000
Every 24 hours, we widen
that dark red pool of human blood.

783
00:43:58,066 --> 00:43:59,400
We do. We do.

784
00:44:02,233 --> 00:44:04,266
There's nothing underground with this.

785
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:05,800
You gotta see it.

786
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:09,000
If you don't have faith
and you don't have spirituality,

787
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,166
you're not gonna see it.

788
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:12,733
Your gonna miss
all the miracles of the supernatural.

789
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,233
And you're going to miss all the reverse
miracles of the preternatural.

790
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,400
And...

791
00:44:18,033 --> 00:44:19,566
Open your eyes.

792
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:22,066
Find God and you'll see.

793
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,600
Lucifer has the most amazing PR.
He doesn't exist.

794
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:38,133
...World War Two,

795
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,233
which we were fighting,
was never to be known.

796
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,600
He has madeit so he doesn't exist.

797
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:57,133
The film business heading could read
"The Devil knocks out the mafia."

798
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,066
For in  US and Canada cities,
the old box-office champ

799
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,033
The Godfather is being flattened

800
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,400
by that movie about diabolical possession,
The exorcist.

801
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:12,166
There was a very funny picture
called <i>The Exorcist</i>,

802
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:14,100
based on a book by William Blatty,

803
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:17,466
which was totally erroneous
as regards exorcism.

804
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:18,733
It's a phony, phony exorcism.

805
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,266
 It makes out
exorcism to be a combination

806
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,233
of Frankenstein and Dracula
with a lot of green goo,

807
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,200
and windows breaking
and bodies flying.

808
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:30,033
It's much more terrible
and lethal than that.

809
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:35,066
Everything you see in <i>The Exorcist</i>
can happen.

810
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,100
But it could happen in an exorcist
over a lifetime...

811
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:44,333
It would be almost unheard-of
that it would appear

812
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,333
in a single indivisual
in one single case.

813
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:53,400
So, the movie tend to condense
 a lot of phenomena.

814
00:45:53,466 --> 00:45:58,066
I know one exorcist who told me
he has once only seen levitation

815
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,566
in 20 years as an exorcist.

816
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,733
Right? But he has seen it.

817
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,800
He saw a child floating around the floor.

818
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,533
When we were publishing
<i>"Hostage To The Devil",</i>

819
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,400
because Tony was such a good friend
of Peter Blatty,

820
00:46:16,466 --> 00:46:18,800
we had some difficulty there.

821
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:23,200
They required Malachi
to get a letter from the Pope

822
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:25,100
saying that what he was,

823
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:28,266
what he said he was,
and exorcism was what it said it was.

824
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:31,600
And Malachi got a letter from Paul VI.

825
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:35,133
And Peter Blatty,
when he heard about this,

826
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
just hit the ceiling.

827
00:46:37,666 --> 00:46:39,033
He just...

828
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,666
Exorcism was his.

829
00:46:41,733 --> 00:46:45,033
And not only did he not write
a blurb for the book,

830
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,700
he wrote a review of the book
in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>,

831
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:50,333
the opening line of which was,

832
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,566
"I hate this book."

833
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,466
When I wrote that book in 1975,

834
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,733
I wrote it for one reason only.

835
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,166
I wrote it because I found
my contemporaries

836
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:02,766
in America and Canada and
Australia and Ireland

837
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,533
had forgotten what it was all about.

838
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,066
They didn't know it existed any more.
So I decided,

839
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:10,300
as I was in that field,
doing a lot of work,

840
00:47:10,366 --> 00:47:15,066
that I would get and publish
the transcripts of five to ten exorcisms

841
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,300
and publish them as such with a preface.

842
00:47:20,133 --> 00:47:22,700
So I read Malachi Martin's book
early on.

843
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,066
It definitely made an impression on me.

844
00:47:26,133 --> 00:47:29,433
It's a very dramatic portrayal of exorcism.

845
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,433
There's no doubt about it.
Here he was, a Catholic priest,

846
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,766
writing about a topic that many people
didn't know anything about,

847
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,466
and whatever want to say about
<i>"Hostage To The Devil",</i>

848
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:43,366
it's definitely a gripping read.
Even today.

849
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,266
My name is John Zaffis.

850
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:50,800
I'm a paranormal investigator
and demonologist.

851
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:53,700
I've been involved with the field
for 42years,

852
00:47:53,766 --> 00:47:57,633
investigating a lot of different claims
of hauntings,

853
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,666
and the possibility of possession.

854
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:06,266
You know, years ago,
people used to look forward to sitting down, reading a book

855
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,300
and <i>"Hostage To The Devil"</i>
is probably one of the very first books I was reading

856
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:12,200
in regards to some of this work.

857
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,500
And I finally had
the opportunity to meet him

858
00:48:15,566 --> 00:48:18,100
when he was speaking at a small event.

859
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:23,000
He would have this look,
you notice with a lot of spiritual people.

860
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:25,033
They're trying to get
a good sense of you.

861
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,200
You have to remember,
when you get involved with this field,

862
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:30,633
it's so important to be able to be guarded

863
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,366
and carefully with
the people you associated yourself with.

864
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,566
Because people will go after you
in a heartbeat

865
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:38,733
you know, be able to tear you down.

866
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,233
He was on a downward spiral
of more and more myths.

867
00:48:45,466 --> 00:48:48,666
<i>"Hostage To The Devil"</i>
was an account of his...

868
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:54,200
...efforts to cast the Devil out

869
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,200
of various people who had been...

870
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:01,300
...possessed by the Devil.

871
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:04,200
And by all critical accounts,

872
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:08,466
his account didn't really stand up.

873
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,466
It did exremely well.

874
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:25,066
As time went on, it outsold <i>"The Exorcist".</i>

875
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:27,200
and is still in print
and still on sale.

876
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:29,333
It has sold well over a million copies.

877
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:36,300
It appealed to his romantic nature

878
00:49:36,366 --> 00:49:39,400
to have a romantic tale to tell.

879
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,400
He did very well.

880
00:49:42,466 --> 00:49:45,033
He sold a few books. More than a few.

881
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:50,300
On one hand, you could say
he was always interested

882
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:54,366
in the most sensational story
that he could make up.

883
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,333
On the other hand,
there are those who think

884
00:49:58,433 --> 00:50:00,366
he, Malachi Martin himself,

885
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:02,333
somewhat possessed by the Devil.

886
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:06,600
And... for him to cast himself in the role

887
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:09,300
of someone who could cast devils out

888
00:50:09,366 --> 00:50:10,666
was a really neat trick.

889
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,700
-Have you ever been possessed?
-No, thank God.

890
00:50:13,766 --> 00:50:16,800
Some of the critics think maybe
you were when you wrote this book.

891
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,333
Well, may the Lord cure me
if I have been possessed.

892
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,333
I doubt that you have been.

893
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:28,366
There is one thing that people
have to understand.

894
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:29,566
He broke ground.

895
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:30,800
He went public.

896
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,766
He started doing appearances
and radio shows,

897
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,333
talking about this topic.

898
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,000
Demonology.

899
00:50:38,066 --> 00:50:39,133
Possession.

900
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,433
These things exist.
These things do happen.

901
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,766
He was crucified, basically,
behind the scenes,

902
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,766
with the Church,
with people ridiculing him.

903
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,033
"Misrepresentation, falsehood,
and imagination

904
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,000
gone berserk all in the elaboration
and defence of a particular thesis."

905
00:50:54,066 --> 00:50:55,733
Well, do you know what  Ben Jonson said,

906
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,300
when somebody said similar words
about a work of his?

907
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:01,666
He said: "When a gentleman
throws mud at me,

908
00:51:01,733 --> 00:51:04,200
I know he has only got mud to throw."

909
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:07,600
You know, I don't respond to critics.

910
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:09,733
I don't really care
 what critics have to say.

911
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,266
I believe that Father Martin
felt the same way.

912
00:51:12,333 --> 00:51:15,233
We more interested in pleasing God

913
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,033
than pleasing our fellow man.

914
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,600
If you mention God,
they want to boo you.

915
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,341
If you mention Jesus,
they want to boo you.

916
00:51:21,366 --> 00:51:24,566
They want to take it out
of the Pledge of Allegiance.

917
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:26,766
And... the Ten commandments, and all this.

918
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,633
But you know what,
oddly enough,

919
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,600
"In God we trust" is on our money.

920
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:33,200
I don't see anybody throwing that away.

921
00:51:33,266 --> 00:51:36,233
So, you know what,
if you don't believe in God,

922
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,033
and you want to remove all of...

923
00:51:38,466 --> 00:51:41,000
then take every penny you have

924
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:42,800
and give it away!

925
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,566
Right now!
Don't wait.

926
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,100
Give it away.
Because God's name is on the money.

927
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,633
You're a hypocrite at that time.

928
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,566
Walk the walk.

929
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,633
I never met the man in person
that I interviewed him

930
00:51:58,566 --> 00:52:00,033
for countless hours on the radio.

931
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,600
I was very fortunate.

932
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:04,133
We became close friends.

933
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,800
I don't think you could listen to Malachi

934
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:10,500
and not have a strong opinion,
one way or the other.

935
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:16,533
I've received a lot... not a lot,
a few angry, very angry, faxes.

936
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,366
I'm sure you have. I'm sure you have.

937
00:52:18,433 --> 00:52:23,400
"How dare you, Art, expose the audience
to this...

938
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:27,466
old-fashioned, put-the-fear-
of-God-in-them hellfire-and brimstone--

939
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:28,766
people are vey angry.

940
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,233
They are.
I know they are very angry.

941
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:36,700
But as I say, my reading of the really,
really, really angry ones...

942
00:52:36,766 --> 00:52:40,200
is that this disturbs their way of life.

943
00:52:41,233 --> 00:52:43,666
This manifests "a weakness".

944
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,366
This tells the truth
about the way that they live

945
00:52:47,433 --> 00:52:50,100
and they don't like to be
reminded of it.

946
00:52:54,433 --> 00:52:56,500
He certainly brought it off very well.

947
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:59,700
He made lots of money,
writing these books,

948
00:52:59,766 --> 00:53:04,066
and making many appearances
on radio  and television.

949
00:53:05,533 --> 00:53:06,600
However,

950
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,633
what did it all add up to?

951
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,633
Huge disappointment on the part of those
who finally saw through him.

952
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,166
Father Martin, where can I write to you?

953
00:53:18,466 --> 00:53:19,766
Following address. Take it.

954
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,200
217 East 66th Street, New York, New York.

955
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,100
He gave out his personal information

956
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,366
because he wanted to help people.

957
00:53:32,433 --> 00:53:34,666
Do I think it was a good idea?
No.

958
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:38,500
I warned him very carefully

959
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,733
that this might not be such a good idea.

960
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,500
I did that because of the thousands
of emails that I receive daily.

961
00:53:45,566 --> 00:53:48,166
 I knew what it was in for.

962
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:57,133
The phone was ringing off the hook.
I looked at the answering machine,

963
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,800
wondering why it wasn't answering.

964
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:00,600
And it said, 99.

965
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:04,600
I began to listen to the messages.
Of course, it was everybody...

966
00:54:05,433 --> 00:54:08,200
thought that they were possessed
and wanted to talk to him.

967
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:12,500
And I called Malachi and asked
what had gone on

968
00:54:13,766 --> 00:54:15,466
 He apologised and he said:

969
00:54:16,466 --> 00:54:18,766
"I didn't want to give my number
so I gave yours.

970
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,500
I promise I'll never do it again."

971
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,666
I don't think I've ever met
 a person with such strong charisma.

972
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,166
He drew you in.

973
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:30,400
Very, very charming.

974
00:54:30,466 --> 00:54:32,100
Highly intelligent.

975
00:54:32,166 --> 00:54:34,400
Well-versed on so many topics,

976
00:54:34,466 --> 00:54:38,133
in the worldly sphere
as well as the spiritual sphere.

977
00:54:38,633 --> 00:54:42,600
I did hear it from the other side,
because I heard from a couple of people

978
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,633
who were absolutely devastated

979
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,233
because he sort of pelled the plug
on the relationship.

980
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:54,600
So, I know how much it hurt the people
when that happend.

981
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:57,766
Then, of course, I dreaded that
that might happen to me.

982
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,166
I don't know what else I can say,
but,

983
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:04,400
it's true, yes, people obviously
must have gotten to be too possessive.

984
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:09,300
And I can see why.
He was absolutely tantalising.

985
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,500
He was a charming guy
who told very witty stories.

986
00:55:16,366 --> 00:55:19,133
Some of them even fairly obscene.

987
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,466
Because he was so unusual,

988
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,733
most of us around our dinner tables

989
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:26,533
would give him a pass.

990
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,533
We would say: "That's Malachi.
He's just being Malachi."

991
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:35,733
Unfortunately,

992
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,433
men being men,

993
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,200
Malachi Martin being a man,

994
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:40,366
Malachi Martin...

995
00:55:41,466 --> 00:55:43,400
"fell in love",

996
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,666
at least he said he did, with my wife.

997
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:48,366
So, they began an affair.

998
00:55:54,366 --> 00:55:56,000
I didn't want to think

999
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:58,300
that he was having an affair with my wife.

1000
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:01,233
Therefore for a good long time,
I was in denial.

1001
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,766
So...

1002
00:56:03,433 --> 00:56:06,333
he was just a liar
and a scoudrel and a cheat.

1003
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:10,066
I'm glad that I will be judged
by our Lord Jesus

1004
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,200
because I don't want to be judged by anyone

1005
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:14,633
I'd be condemned to hell by them.

1006
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,233
Because I'm a filthy pig.

1007
00:56:16,766 --> 00:56:18,300
[nervous laughter]

1008
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:20,766
I know me x2
better than anybody.

1009
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,200
I know I don't deserve a darn thing.

1010
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,733
I never saw an ego
and I was driving with him

1011
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,233
I said to him: "Father,
I want to attain your holiness."

1012
00:56:37,233 --> 00:56:39,133
and he said, "to me?"

1013
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:41,800
"I'm a wretched pig in the eyes of God."

1014
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,000
I almost crashed the car.

1015
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:46,500
"If you're a wetched pig,
then I'm finished."

1016
00:56:46,566 --> 00:56:50,733
There's no way
that I'm attaining heaven.

1017
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:52,466
I know this for a fact.

1018
00:56:52,467 --> 00:56:53,775
But he's a warrior.

1019
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,800
He was a warrior for God
and he still is a warrior for God.

1020
00:57:09,466 --> 00:57:13,400
Started out back in 1984.
Graduated from Catholic univercity

1021
00:57:13,466 --> 00:57:17,066
with a degree in Soviet studies,
interestingly enough.

1022
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:20,033
From there, I went to work

1023
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,633
for the US Goverment

1024
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,566
into the Center Intelligence Agency.

1025
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,733
I stayed there till '97.

1026
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:30,366
A lot of the work was
highly classified,

1027
00:57:30,433 --> 00:57:33,200
so I'm not really at liberty
to talk a whole lot about it.

1028
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:41,166
It's very strange
but I haven't been up here in years.

1029
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:44,000
And I'm feeling some of those feelings right now.

1030
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,433
So... its very, very mixed feelings.

1031
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,400
Feelings of fear.

1032
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:58,333
I always felt there was a limited
amount to what could do to protect him.

1033
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,066
Because after a while,
I just came to realise

1034
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:05,600
what he was up against was not
something a goverment badge

1035
00:58:05,666 --> 00:58:09,100
or a weapons going to do anything against.

1036
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,200
You know, the goverment can
train you do all kinds of things.

1037
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:18,133
But for things that are in the world
we can't see,

1038
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,633
they don't train you for that.

1039
00:58:25,366 --> 00:58:28,333
He always reffered to NYPD
involvement in exorcism

1040
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,733
as being a very oblique thing.

1041
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,600
Only because he couldn't take the chance

1042
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:35,100
that someone with loose lips
was going to run

1043
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:37,400
to the New York Daily News
or the New York Post

1044
00:58:37,466 --> 00:58:40,433
and make the claim that
the New York Police Dept

1045
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,200
was helping to cast demons out of people.

1046
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:47,066
So, his involvement
with the New York City Police Dept

1047
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:49,733
would have been
probably more along the lines of

1048
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,733
his interaction with people
like Ralph Sarchie.

1049
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,666
But it was never an official policy

1050
00:58:54,733 --> 00:58:57,200
that the NPYD would ever call in
an exorcist.

1051
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,366
All of these are my notes.

1052
00:59:02,433 --> 00:59:03,700
What this is all about.

1053
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,166
Sometimes it's difficult
but most of the times you know

1054
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:10,233
because of the way the person behaves,

1055
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,433
you know they are not mentally ill.
There's something else.

1056
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,266
And a good exorcist
and a good investigator

1057
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,433
will get to the bottom of that.

1058
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,500
It might take time
but it can be done.

1059
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:26,541
[moaning]

1060
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,100
So it must be a priest and he must
have authority from the bishop.

1061
00:59:32,166 --> 00:59:34,333
I know bishops.
We've gone to them and said:

1062
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,033
"Look, John so-and-so
or Mary so-and-so
they needs exorcism,

1063
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,300
your Honor, your Excellency,"

1064
00:59:39,366 --> 00:59:41,433
but a lot of it
is left up to the exorcist.

1065
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,966
At a certain moment, I must
turned around and say to you,

1066
00:59:44,033 --> 00:59:46,766
to the possessed person. "Who are you?"

1067
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,300
An exorcist never answers
the question of a possessed person.

1068
00:59:52,366 --> 00:59:55,266
You keep at it and find their names.
All of the names.

1069
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:56,566
Ugly names.

1070
00:59:57,066 --> 00:59:58,633
Sinister names.
Sardonic names.

1071
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:02,366
Once you do that,
 you have them nailed.

1072
01:00:02,766 --> 01:00:06,266
Because then they obey that name.
They act on counsel of that name.

1073
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:09,033
Then you proceed to find out
who sent them,

1074
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,666
how did they cime here, when,
what's your speciality, what do you do?

1075
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:15,533
It's like a dog
trying to get away from you.

1076
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,733
It'll bite your hand. It'll bite you
mortally if you're not careful.

1077
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:25,533
It's amazing how weak people are

1078
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,766
when facing the supernatural.

1079
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,233
Because once the supernatural
manifests itself,

1080
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,100
I've seen strong men
collapse in tears.

1081
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,066
It's just too much. Too much.

1082
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:40,800
It's very frightening.

1083
01:00:41,433 --> 01:00:44,333
If they measure thier intelligence
with his intelligence,

1084
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,000
they're going to be taken captive.

1085
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,433
Malachi Martin had
a very deep relationship with

1086
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:59,433
Dr.Coomaraswamy on a personal
asa well as a spiritual level.

1087
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,600
He knew that Dr.Coomarasawamy

1088
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:06,000
would never deceive him
about anything so...

1089
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:09,300
when Rama Coomaraswamy
called him up

1090
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,466
and asked Malachi to caome up
and meet this young girl...

1091
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,100
Malachi didn't hesitate.

1092
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,133
Especially since there was a child
at stake here.

1093
01:01:23,033 --> 01:01:24,633
Because a child that young

1094
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:28,100
cannot make a choice for evil
with full consent of the will.

1095
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,400
can't do it.

1096
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:32,500
Picture a little kid like that.
She can't make a choice like that.

1097
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,233
That, by the way,
that's the other reason why

1098
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:40,000
a child like that could never
become perfectly possessed.

1099
01:01:40,666 --> 01:01:43,633
In order to perfectly possessed,
as Malachi would've put it,

1100
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,466
you have to give
your full consent of the will.

1101
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:53,800
He was not adventure-seeking.
He knew the dangers.

1102
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:58,300
He knew the perils but he was not
in any shape to do that exorcism.

1103
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:00,833
Physically and spiritually,
perhaps he did not have

1104
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:02,775
adequate protection, either.

1105
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,600
But he put himself on the line

1106
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,533
and in the line of danger

1107
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,200
because there was a little girl

1108
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:12,733
and the family didn't have or
didn't feel they had other recourse.

1109
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,333
The first feeling I had was dread.

1110
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,166
And it was building dread.

1111
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:24,500
And I can't explain why.

1112
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:26,600
It was like I mentioned.

1113
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:29,033
I knew that
at the Catholic Church would put it,

1114
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,633
I was in a state of grace.

1115
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,066
I had nothing to really worry about.

1116
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,533
But still...

1117
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,066
I think we have all been
in those situations where...

1118
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:43,500
you feel a gnawing sense of unease.

1119
01:02:44,066 --> 01:02:45,500
And it just kept building.

1120
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:49,100
It just kept building and building.

1121
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,566
It's power over the will.
You don't wake up in the morning

1122
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:54,566
and say: "gee whiz, I've been possessed."

1123
01:02:54,633 --> 01:02:57,200
It's always a slow process
to which you consent.

1124
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:03,166
If you open your heart to Satan,
he'll accept the invitation.

1125
01:03:04,333 --> 01:03:05,633
It's not...

1126
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,466
He won't refuse.

1127
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:12,233
If someone is going to allow him in,
he'll take it.

1128
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:14,166
he'll take the opportunity.

1129
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,800
I asked your disciples to cast him out,
and they were not able.

1130
01:03:22,433 --> 01:03:23,700
and he asked them:

1131
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:27,566
"O, faithless generation,
how long am I to be with you?

1132
01:03:28,333 --> 01:03:30,000
How long am I to bear with you?

1133
01:03:30,533 --> 01:03:31,600
Bring to me."

1134
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:35,700
They brought the boy to him,
and when the spirit saw him,

1135
01:03:35,766 --> 01:03:38,333
immediately, he convulsed the boy.

1136
01:03:38,733 --> 01:03:42,433
He fel on the ground
and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.

1137
01:03:43,433 --> 01:03:46,766
Jesus asked his father:
"How long has he had this?"

1138
01:03:47,433 --> 01:03:49,566
He said: "From childhood."

1139
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,166
[sighs] 17 years.

1140
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,466
17 years and at this moment,

1141
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:08,533
 it feels like it
fucking happened yesterday

1142
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:15,200
Here we are.

1143
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:32,333
Oddly enough, I got a tightness
in the chest as we approach the house.

1144
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,733
I also know that it's mixed
with a lot of sadness.

1145
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:40,000
I mean, on a very real human level,

1146
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:43,033
we're talking about a man
 who, you know...

1147
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,200
for the many years I knew him,

1148
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,133
11, 12...

1149
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,300
he was family to me.

1150
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,133
He was family.

1151
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,000
And now I'm approaching the point
at which he came face to face

1152
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:59,033
with something that none of us
have ever encountered,

1153
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,433
that was ultimately responsible
for taking his life.

1154
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:07,600
So I feel a mixture of sadness,

1155
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,166
a mixture of apprehension,

1156
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:13,533
fear

1157
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:17,400
and anger at what happened to him.

1158
01:05:17,466 --> 01:05:20,333
It took my friend,
it took my goddamn best friend away.

1159
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,733
He was my best friend.

1160
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:54,866
Jesus.

1161
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:10,700
Funny thing is, I just thought
I'd be a whole lot calmer.

1162
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:14,133
My heart is racing
like a goddamn drum.

1163
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:19,000
We pulled in.

1164
01:06:20,133 --> 01:06:21,433
Their van was right there.

1165
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,666
Actually, it was a Ford Explorer.

1166
01:06:25,133 --> 01:06:27,700
We drove up
and I just said to Malachi:

1167
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:31,833
"Is that them?"
Because they were milling about.

1168
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:33,741
I said: "They are not
  supposed to be here."

1169
01:06:34,666 --> 01:06:37,500
He didn't say anything
and I, at that point,

1170
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:39,366
I just knew by the look on his face

1171
01:06:41,366 --> 01:06:42,366
that was them.

1172
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:51,600


1173
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:54,000
Can you sit in that chair for a second?

1174
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:56,466
-Why?
-Because,

1175
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:58,200
Focus.

1176
01:06:58,733 --> 01:07:01,366
I was with a group
that investgated haunted houses.

1177
01:07:02,166 --> 01:07:07,266
We almost all had specialities,
we had a doctor, a nurse, a psychologist.

1178
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:10,400
I was more of a videographer.

1179
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:13,500
I would take pictures, take video.

1180
01:07:13,566 --> 01:07:14,600
help restrain.

1181
01:07:15,766 --> 01:07:18,666
A producer from ABC
came across our website.

1182
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:20,700
We had a featured article about

1183
01:07:20,766 --> 01:07:23,000
a possible possession case
we were working on.

1184
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,100
They asked if we were interested
in doing a primetime special

1185
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:29,133
on that, we said,
of couse we're interested.

1186
01:07:30,466 --> 01:07:35,200
This is about 20-25 years ago.
There were no shows on TV.

1187
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:38,333
This was all before
the paranormal investigators.

1188
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,366
I think we were trailblazers
but even in doing the invetigations,

1189
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,100
examinations and assessments of the people,

1190
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:47,666
I didn't have a role model for that.

1191
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:52,700
There was no textbook
that you can just open up and study.

1192
01:07:52,766 --> 01:07:57,200
I just kind of learned
at I went along through experience

1193
01:07:57,266 --> 01:07:59,666
with the different cases,
with the different families,

1194
01:07:59,733 --> 01:08:01,566
and with the different people involved.

1195
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:04,233
There were certain people in the group
 that felt

1196
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,466
all the cases that came to us
were possessed.

1197
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:09,633
I personally did not feel that way.

1198
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:14,200
My personal opinion
 and my professional opinion at that point,

1199
01:08:14,266 --> 01:08:17,666
I ruled out
a significant number of those cases.

1200
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:22,033
If you're asking for a ratio,
I would say probably

1201
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:24,766
close to two-thirds I would rule out.

1202
01:08:25,766 --> 01:08:28,166
This is outr first exorcism
we ever were in volved with.

1203
01:08:28,233 --> 01:08:30,533
We actually went to the house.
It wasn't in the church.

1204
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,433
We didn't know what was going to happen

1205
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,566
because the girl didn't believe
she was possessed.

1206
01:08:35,633 --> 01:08:38,400
We weren't sure either, she said
"I probably won't have any reaction."

1207
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:45,300
But that morning, I was just
a very angry feeling in that room,

1208
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:50,666
very cold, the temperature in the room
dropped many, many times.

1209
01:08:50,766 --> 01:08:53,300
It would vary up and down, up and down.

1210
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:58,566
As soon as the priest started doing
his litany of the saints,

1211
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:01,533
she started moving around in her chair
and screaming,

1212
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,166
breaking out of her restraints
and she just stoop up like this,

1213
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:08,399
broke out of every restraint we had
and went towards the priest.

1214
01:09:08,466 --> 01:09:10,533
She was trying to gouge
her own eyes out.

1215
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:14,633
During that point, I tried restrain
her own hands from doing that.

1216
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:15,766
She bit me.

1217
01:09:43,033 --> 01:09:44,866
We both got out of the car
at the same time.

1218
01:09:44,867 --> 01:09:46,508
I went around to him
and he said:

1219
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:51,633
"Let's do some introdutions
and then you can leave."

1220
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,700
We got out and walked over
towards where they were.

1221
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:04,000
The introductions were made.

1222
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,666
And then...

1223
01:10:06,733 --> 01:10:09,166
 this little child, she just walks
up to Malachi over here.

1224
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,066
She just looks up at him
and she says:

1225
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:14,800
"You're Father Malachi
and you think you're going to help her."

1226
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:20,733
At that point, I just knew that I was up against something that nothing had ever trained me for.

1227
01:10:21,166 --> 01:10:22,466
And Malachi just

1228
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,266
kept on acting like
she was a perfectly normal little girl.

1229
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,466
I knew something was off.

1230
01:10:32,366 --> 01:10:35,266
Did I know she was possessed? No.
But I knew something was off.

1231
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,433
We are talking about a four-year-old child.
She was innocence personified.

1232
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,500
There was no reason why this kid
should've been afflicted in this way.

1233
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,666
Malachi just kind of gave me "the look",

1234
01:10:48,766 --> 01:10:51,766
as in, "This is my turf now, Bob,

1235
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:54,466
You don't need to be here.
You shouldn't be here."

1236
01:10:55,266 --> 01:10:57,233
It was not my place to be in there at all.

1237
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,400
One of the realities
or the characteristics

1238
01:11:15,466 --> 01:11:18,733
that you need to see
if a person is possessed

1239
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,200
is one of the signs.
You need four signs.

1240
01:11:22,633 --> 01:11:24,166
An extraordinary strength.

1241
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:29,000
The knowledge of ancient languages.

1242
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,133
Fear of sacred things.

1243
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:37,166
And the knowledge of hidden
or very far-away things.

1244
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:44,000
I think that the three first
can be invented.

1245
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,000
I can fake an extraordinary force.

1246
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:49,700
I can talk to you in Latin or Greek.

1247
01:11:49,766 --> 01:11:51,700
Because I remember it from school.

1248
01:11:52,466 --> 01:11:57,166
I can fake that I'm afraid
of the crucifix.

1249
01:11:57,233 --> 01:11:58,300
I can fake it.

1250
01:11:59,033 --> 01:12:02,633
But what I  cannot invent
or cannot fake

1251
01:12:03,633 --> 01:12:08,166
is to know things
that really happened in your life

1252
01:12:09,066 --> 01:12:11,666
that's just absolutely impossible
fir me to know.

1253
01:12:13,233 --> 01:12:15,200
Well, you always go to the commonsense.

1254
01:12:15,266 --> 01:12:17,400
Maybe she heard us talking.

1255
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,433
Or she heard a conversation that we had.

1256
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,700
Or maybe her mother knew something about us

1257
01:12:23,766 --> 01:12:28,133
that she just inadvertenly
blurted out to her.

1258
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:32,666
Maybe she read something about us
on the internet, on the website.

1259
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:36,400
You try to have those commonsense
approach things.

1260
01:12:36,466 --> 01:12:40,133
But sometimes you just know
there's no way they could've known that.

1261
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,033
There are very personal things
about our families,

1262
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,000
personal events that have happened
that morning.

1263
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:48,333
There's no possible way.

1264
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:52,466
Something I didn't even talk about
with my colleagues.

1265
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:53,766
How would they know that?

1266
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,266
I can't explain it.

1267
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:01,400
One of the things that convinced me
that there's something to this,

1268
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:03,700
in very rare cases,
there is something  to this,

1269
01:13:03,766 --> 01:13:09,133
beyond simple superstition
or active imagination,

1270
01:13:09,733 --> 01:13:12,066
was the fact that I was able
to interview people

1271
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,133
who were not Catholic priests,
who were sceptics,

1272
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,233
who were scientists,

1273
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:20,166
who themselves had these experiences.

1274
01:13:20,233 --> 01:13:22,566
And they couldn't explain them.
And there were matching up with what,

1275
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:25,433
the exorcists were saying,
they were seeing themselves.

1276
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:31,500
The real horror, the real pain,

1277
01:13:31,666 --> 01:13:34,433
what hurts in possession

1278
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,333
in the presence of the Evil One.

1279
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:39,433
And when we start an exorcism,

1280
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,133
within the first 20 minutes, we know

1281
01:13:43,233 --> 01:13:44,666
whether it's genuine or not.

1282
01:13:44,733 --> 01:13:47,033
Seddenly, it becomes evident.

1283
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,066
How evident

1284
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:53,766
Like an indivisual animal clawing at you
with claws you can't escape.

1285
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:59,500
There are physical manifestations
like change in temperature,

1286
01:13:59,566 --> 01:14:01,133
smells, odours,

1287
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:03,333
objects flying around,

1288
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:07,200
and then there's violence on the part
of the possessed person at times.

1289
01:14:07,733 --> 01:14:09,066
They have to be held down.

1290
01:14:09,133 --> 01:14:11,433
Thats's why you have assistants
who are not afraid.

1291
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,300
Because a lot of people the moment

1292
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:17,166
they enter their first exorcism,

1293
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,233
it scares them,

1294
01:14:19,733 --> 01:14:23,066
it's the most unhealthy, insalubrious

1295
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:27,500
mucky, dirty, inhuman activity
you could participate in,

1296
01:14:27,566 --> 01:14:29,733
but we must
in order to save these people.

1297
01:14:30,366 --> 01:14:33,400
The exorcist and his assistants
and the possessed person

1298
01:14:33,466 --> 01:14:37,266
are in the presence
of something that hates us

1299
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:40,633
in a way that you've never
felt hated before.

1300
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,166
When you get beyond the sensational,

1301
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:55,033
like I did,
when I was watching these exorcisms,

1302
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,100
it's one of the things
that really stand out in your mind,

1303
01:14:57,133 --> 01:14:58,300
These people are suffering.

1304
01:14:59,566 --> 01:15:03,000
And you, from a human level,

1305
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:05,233
you want to help them get better.

1306
01:15:10,166 --> 01:15:12,700
We are tested oftentimes.

1307
01:15:12,766 --> 01:15:14,433
And that morning was no different.

1308
01:15:15,066 --> 01:15:18,266
That exorcism went on
for a number of hours, I believe.

1309
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:22,233
But afterwards, there was
such a change in the room.

1310
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,233
It was absolutely beautiful.

1311
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,600
I can't,
words cannot even describe the change.

1312
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,000
When they first approached us,
I think we were more excited to be on TV.

1313
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:39,300


1314
01:15:39,366 --> 01:15:41,533
And after it came out,
we saw the impact that it had

1315
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,366
and how many people were in need
around the country.

1316
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:46,633
They said,
they can't find help in their area.

1317
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,466
We are talking about real people
who are suffering.

1318
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:54,633
Real people who want healing.

1319
01:15:55,266 --> 01:15:56,766
Those people deserve peace.

1320
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,566
Those people implore for peace

1321
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:01,800
that only the Church can give

1322
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:05,266
when they are in these grave situations.

1323
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:17,800
I came back for him two hours later.

1324
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,266
At the time, it was a beautiful summer day.

1325
01:16:21,333 --> 01:16:23,533
I came down the driveway in my Jeep.

1326
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:26,266
I just remember there was a Ford Explorer.

1327
01:16:26,333 --> 01:16:29,100
It was a tan vehicle.
It was parked right about here,

1328
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,666
caddy-corner almost facing
that house in the background.

1329
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:33,433
And everyone was out,

1330
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,166
starting to say their goodbyes.

1331
01:16:36,233 --> 01:16:39,000
I saw them proceeding out
from the house in the back there.

1332
01:16:39,066 --> 01:16:41,066
I pulled up right over here.

1333
01:16:42,133 --> 01:16:45,400
And I got and I saw Malachi
talking to the parents first.

1334
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,333
And then the parents were getting
in the vehicle

1335
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,033
and they were helping  the little child
into the vehicle into the back seat,

1336
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,633
and the mother had rolled the window down,

1337
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:57,433
and Malachi, after he had
said goodbye to the parents,

1338
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,633
he had walked over
to say goodbye to the child,

1339
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,100
and I remember when the window
went down,

1340
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:05,666
just as he got there to the window,
as the glass came down,

1341
01:17:05,733 --> 01:17:08,600
I remember her face
kind of framed in the window.

1342
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:11,366
And she just blew him a kiss,

1343
01:17:11,433 --> 01:17:14,000
it was disgusting, lascivious,

1344
01:17:14,066 --> 01:17:17,700
it was like something
was defiling innocence at that moment.

1345
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:21,000
The kind of way you imagine a whore
blowing a kiss to a John

1346
01:17:21,066 --> 01:17:22,466
who had just paid her hundred bucks.

1347
01:17:22,733 --> 01:17:24,066
That's what it was.

1348
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:26,766
Malachi was completely nonplussed.

1349
01:17:30,033 --> 01:17:31,533
It is exremely rare

1350
01:17:31,766 --> 01:17:34,566
for a four-year-old
to have a mental illness at that age.

1351
01:17:35,433 --> 01:17:37,400
I don't know the particulars of this case

1352
01:17:37,466 --> 01:17:40,133
but if she was sexually provocative
at the age four.

1353
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,233
That could be a learned behaviour
through sexual abuse.

1354
01:17:45,066 --> 01:17:47,233
But again, at the age of four,

1355
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:51,233
it's very rare for a child of that age

1356
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,466
for it to be explained by mental illness.

1357
01:17:53,533 --> 01:17:56,333
Or again, substance abuse.

1358
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,366
Substance-induced psychosis.

1359
01:17:59,433 --> 01:18:01,533
Schizophenia.
Things of that nature.

1360
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,166
To the sceptics, I would say
that the people that I met that day,

1361
01:18:05,233 --> 01:18:08,700
they seemed like in every way,
the all-American family.

1362
01:18:09,266 --> 01:18:11,666
There was nothing
 to indicate anything like that

1363
01:18:12,533 --> 01:18:15,500
Something went on
in the conversations inside the house

1364
01:18:15,766 --> 01:18:19,600
that convinced a senior exorcist
of the Roman Catholic Church

1365
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,000
and Dr.Rama Coomaraswamy,

1366
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:25,233
an actual medical psychiatrist,

1367
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,566
that something was afflicting this girl

1368
01:18:28,066 --> 01:18:29,466
that was not of this world

1369
01:18:29,533 --> 01:18:32,200
and could not be explained
by modern medical science.

1370
01:18:38,666 --> 01:18:40,766
We went up the driveway and I said:

1371
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,066
"So, do you think it's an authentic case
of possession, Mal?"

1372
01:18:44,633 --> 01:18:48,700
And he said: "I've got no doubt.
But this one is going to be difficult."

1373
01:18:49,366 --> 01:18:53,533
I remember my phrase for that was,
hammer and tongs.

1374
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,366
I said: "You're talking hammer and tongs?"
He said: "Yeah."

1375
01:18:56,633 --> 01:18:59,700
Then he just kind of nodded
and he was quiet for a while,

1376
01:18:59,766 --> 01:19:00,833
as we drove off.

1377
01:19:15,133 --> 01:19:19,500
People would be inclined to think
that the hostage is the person possessed.

1378
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,066
But actually, no, it's the priest
who goes the exorcism.

1379
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:30,333
Malachi had been the subject
of several heart operations.

1380
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,733
He always tried to come across
as very robust.

1381
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:37,300
But you know these things, exorcisms,

1382
01:19:37,366 --> 01:19:39,100
they have to take a toll on you.

1383
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:44,066
Once you realise
you are dealing with a reallity here

1384
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:46,533
then you realise there is a price
to be paid

1385
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,500
and every exorcism
took a little chunk out of his life.

1386
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:52,433
For Malachi,
his own personal health

1387
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,533
was never a concern to him.

1388
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,733
It was of paramount concern
 to the people around him.

1389
01:20:01,033 --> 01:20:04,466
He was told by the doctor
to take it easier

1390
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,000
and to cut out a lot of what he was doing.

1391
01:20:07,066 --> 01:20:10,533
But it's an element of the true priest

1392
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:14,633
needs to be another Christ,
that is what he is called to be.

1393
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,800
To lay your life on the line.

1394
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:26,166
The more he would help people,
the more he would become a target.

1395
01:20:26,233 --> 01:20:28,066
It affects their personal lives,

1396
01:20:28,133 --> 01:20:30,466
it affects everything about them.

1397
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:32,766
And it's a very isolating world.

1398
01:20:50,666 --> 01:20:52,366
The phone rang that morning

1399
01:20:52,433 --> 01:20:54,533
and it was Malachi's voice
on the other end,

1400
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,800
speaking in a very strained, weak voice.

1401
01:20:58,300 --> 01:21:01,466
His exact words were,
"Bob, I've taken a bit of a tumble."

1402
01:21:02,366 --> 01:21:03,600
I said: "What do you mean?"

1403
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:06,841
He said: "I've hit my head.
I was reaching for a book,

1404
01:21:07,066 --> 01:21:09,466
standing on a stool in my study,

1405
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:12,600
and I had the stool
 knocked out from under me."

1406
01:21:12,666 --> 01:21:14,700
"What do you mean,
it was pushed out from under you?"

1407
01:21:15,466 --> 01:21:19,033
He said:"Old Scratch wasn't terribly happy
with what we just did up in Connecticut."

1408
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:24,333
I know that person said
that he claimed that someone pushed him.

1409
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,300
What is unclear about that, of course,
is whether it was an evil spirit

1410
01:21:29,366 --> 01:21:30,633
or a human.

1411
01:21:32,766 --> 01:21:36,133
Some said that he was
pushed off the ladder.

1412
01:21:37,266 --> 01:21:44,266
Done in because he had
this terrible history behind him.

1413
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,033
They wanted to shut him up.

1414
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,666
I know it was horrific.

1415
01:21:49,633 --> 01:21:51,800
He said he wanted me to know that

1416
01:21:52,633 --> 01:21:55,466
he hadn't fallen, it wasn't a fall.

1417
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:00,566
This creature had grabbed him

1418
01:22:03,633 --> 01:22:06,433
just above his ankle
and caused him to fall.

1419
01:22:08,266 --> 01:22:11,500
When he went to the hospital,
he lapsed into a coma.

1420
01:22:12,466 --> 01:22:17,433
They were restrcting the access of people

1421
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,300
into his room, a semi-private room
in Lennox Hill Hospital.

1422
01:22:20,366 --> 01:22:24,666
I'm not ashamed to say
I was bawling like a little child.

1423
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:27,600
Here was my best friend in a coma.

1424
01:22:28,466 --> 01:22:32,533
I knew he wasn't hearing me
with his ears.

1425
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,566
Hopefully, he was hearing me
with his soul.

1426
01:22:35,766 --> 01:22:38,400
I had a tremendous sense in that room

1427
01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:42,333
that a struggle was continuing.
Even though he was comatose.

1428
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,533
That's why the prayers that we made

1429
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,600
and we sent to protect him
were so important.

1430
01:22:54,133 --> 01:22:56,533
About a day and a half later,

1431
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,800
I just got a call, I believe,
from his agent, Lila,

1432
01:23:00,033 --> 01:23:02,333
that Malachi had passed away.

1433
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,133
I remember just hanging up the phone

1434
01:23:07,133 --> 01:23:09,233
and going into my office at home

1435
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:12,366
and just praying the rosary
immediately for his soul.

1436
01:23:15,533 --> 01:23:19,066
"We have the intent
to want to receive God.

1437
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,600
Doesn't hold any weight with Jesus?"

1438
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,333


1439
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:27,800
When I heard that he had passed on
to his final reward,

1440
01:23:28,033 --> 01:23:29,500
because that's he got,

1441
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,366
I was sad to see him go

1442
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:36,466
and it scared me a little bit
because I lost my mentors now.

1443
01:23:36,533 --> 01:23:38,466
It's like, uh oh, you know?

1444
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:42,133
What do I do now
if I come upon something that I don't know?

1445
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,800
But I miss him
and I would like to talk to him

1446
01:23:46,033 --> 01:23:48,166
and I still do talk to him.

1447
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,000
[laughter  ]

1448
01:23:59,266 --> 01:24:00,966
I think he knew what he was doing

1449
01:24:01,133 --> 01:24:03,766
he knew the risks
and yet he went for it.

1450
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:08,733
Personally, I feel it was a great victory
for the Adversary.

1451
01:24:09,366 --> 01:24:13,033
I think that he was taken too soon
and ...

1452
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,233
prematurely.

1453
01:24:16,533 --> 01:24:19,000
The Adversary hit its mark in that.

1454
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,300
So, it was a great tragedy.

1455
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,666
Father Martin had told me
about this particular case.

1456
01:24:35,733 --> 01:24:38,000
The girl was four-years-old at the time.

1457
01:24:38,066 --> 01:24:42,433
When she was eight, four years later,
I assisted at her exorcism.

1458
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:48,400
This girl needed
years and years of exorcism.

1459
01:24:48,466 --> 01:24:51,433
There was no doubt about that.
We weren't dealing with a demon.

1460
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:54,666
We were dealing with the Devil here
and he was very, very powerful.

1461
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,366
She spoke fluent Latin
during that exorcism.

1462
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,533
I can produce eight-year-old children
that can speak fluent Latin

1463
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,166
but they're traditional,

1464
01:25:17,233 --> 01:25:21,133
they're been trained since first grade
on how to speak Latin.

1465
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:24,033
I know this particular girl
didn't have that background.

1466
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,766
She was actually.

1467
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:29,433
-Who taught you that?
-No one.

1468
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:32,133
-No one?
-No one.

1469
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,566
-Not your fatheror anybody?
-No.

1470
01:25:34,633 --> 01:25:36,133
How do you know it, then?

1471
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,300
Mmm...I just know it.

1472
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,233
Speaking in a language that is not
known previously to that person

1473
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:49,700
is a surefire sign of demonic possession.

1474
01:25:49,766 --> 01:25:52,266
From what I seen during the exorcism,

1475
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:56,566
We did get that proof right out
of the playbook of the Roman ritual.

1476
01:25:59,533 --> 01:26:03,466
This particular case was definitely
on a different level.

1477
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:07,333
I do hope that she did find
the relief that she sought.

1478
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:11,733
Most of all, I hope her soul belongs
to God at this moment,

1479
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,400
no matter what her physical condition is.

1480
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:17,233
I hope that her soul belongs to God.

1481
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:21,800
I adjure you, Devil.

1482
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,233
-You want me to say it?
-Yeah.

1483
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,333
I adjure you, Devil.

1484
01:26:27,366 --> 01:26:29,366
-To be gone.
-To be gone.

1485
01:26:29,433 --> 01:26:32,066
-And leave me alone.
-And leave me alone.

1486
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:34,533
-Now and for ever.
-Now and for ever.

1487
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:37,766
-I hate you.
-I hate you.

1488
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,633
-And you are a Devil.
-And you are a Devil.

1489
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,300
Amen.

1490
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,200
If you contact the HQ of the Jesuits
in Rome, the Jesuit curia.

1491
01:26:58,266 --> 01:27:01,000
which is a large building
in the shadow of the Vatican,

1492
01:27:01,066 --> 01:27:02,700
they will give you a number of facts,

1493
01:27:02,766 --> 01:27:05,300
if they choose to give you
any information at all.

1494
01:27:05,366 --> 01:27:08,133
They'll tell you that Malachi Martin
was a Jesuit priest.

1495
01:27:08,733 --> 01:27:11,666
They'll tell you that he was in Rome
between certain dates

1496
01:27:11,733 --> 01:27:14,800
but there are not certain of the role
or the authority which he had.

1497
01:27:15,333 --> 01:27:19,166
They will tell you that he did, at a stage,
work on the Dead Sea Scrolls.

1498
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:24,100
According to the Jesuits,
when Malachi Martin left Rome in 1965,

1499
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,766
he was no longer a priest.

1500
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,733
Malachi Martin had no right

1501
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,700
legitimately to perform exorcisms

1502
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,433
unless by express permission
from the local bishop.

1503
01:27:46,266 --> 01:27:49,466
It's hard for some characters
to get off the stage.

1504
01:27:49,533 --> 01:27:53,033
If you know when to get off the stage,
still leaving some questions

1505
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,600
in mind of the audience,
you've done pretty well.

1506
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:02,033


1507
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:05,700
According to the Jesuits,
Father Martin no longer a priest

1508
01:28:05,766 --> 01:28:08,266
when he left them in '65.

1509
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,333
basically, once you're a priest,
you're always a priest.

1510
01:28:12,166 --> 01:28:15,400
Father Martin never renounced his vows.

1511
01:28:15,466 --> 01:28:17,766
As a matter of fact, he probably
strengthened them

1512
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,600
from the outside of the Church.

1513
01:28:19,666 --> 01:28:21,333
Which is where God wanted him.

1514
01:28:21,633 --> 01:28:23,700
They don't like it.
That's the truth.

1515
01:28:31,766 --> 01:28:36,600
You know, I think we're all blessed
with intuition and instinct.

1516
01:28:37,766 --> 01:28:39,566
So, when we walk into a room
and there

1517
01:28:39,633 --> 01:28:42,066
is someone afflicted in that room,

1518
01:28:42,566 --> 01:28:45,633
you know it, you feel it, you see it.

1519
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:49,166
Sometimes you know it
because you even see the person,
before you even go into the room.

1520
01:28:49,233 --> 01:28:51,800
Sometimes you know it
when you are driving up to the house.

1521
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,400
It's just a gut feeling.

1522
01:28:54,466 --> 01:28:57,466
I believe that to be
all the source within us

1523
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:01,700
responding to
 what source is not.

1524
01:29:04,066 --> 01:29:09,566
I've noticed in all the evidence
I have tried to present to the public

1525
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:11,700
they are either gonna believe
or not gonna believe.

1526
01:29:11,766 --> 01:29:13,800
It's very hard to change
somebody's beliefs.

1527
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:17,200
But just getting the word out
is all you can do.

1528
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:20,466
And you can help somebody along the way,
that's great.

1529
01:29:21,233 --> 01:29:22,933
I've been doing this for 20 years.

1530
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,333
If I helped one person who was
genuinely possessed, it's all worth it.

1531
01:29:30,433 --> 01:29:33,133
These are very, very
sophisticated spirits

1532
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:35,733
who are there to harm us.

1533
01:29:36,566 --> 01:29:37,566
And they are real.

1534
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:46,766
One thing that I've noticed
is that since his death,

1535
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,066
interest in his work and in him

1536
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:51,566
has not really diminished.

1537
01:29:51,733 --> 01:29:56,066
He was absolutely confident
in everything he said.

1538
01:29:56,566 --> 01:29:59,733
And he used the means at his disposal,
which were the media,

1539
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,300
to get the message across.

1540
01:30:01,766 --> 01:30:04,500
So it was his confidence
in what he was saying

1541
01:30:04,566 --> 01:30:06,033
that really struck me.

1542
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,300
And there is a certain element of mystery.

1543
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,433
He was a fascinating man.

1544
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,766
He also said a lot of things
to me in private.

1545
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,200
We did talk a great deal.

1546
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:26,266
And he shared some of those which
 I cannot share with you or anybody

1547
01:30:27,066 --> 01:30:28,733
because I promised.

1548
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:31,800
What he did say:

1549
01:30:32,533 --> 01:30:34,400
"If you want something chilling,

1550
01:30:35,233 --> 01:30:38,000
imagine the very worst you can imagine

1551
01:30:38,066 --> 01:30:43,233
and then I will tell you that it's going
to be much worse than that."

1552
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,500
I think that if one looks
at these tapes,

1553
01:30:48,566 --> 01:30:51,433
we may touch on
the evidence that we now have

1554
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,300
that Satan is having his last stand.

1555
01:30:54,366 --> 01:30:56,700
This is his Waterloo
and he is going to kill a lot,

1556
01:30:56,766 --> 01:30:59,266
destroy much, scorched-earth policy.

1557
01:30:59,333 --> 01:31:02,066
Destroy as much as he can
before he shoved into the abyss again,

1558
01:31:02,133 --> 01:31:04,266
chained by Michael

1559
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:12,366
I do believe that Malachi Martin
started to believe his own lies.

1560
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:14,333
He was so convincing.

1561
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,366
Some people didn't exactly hate him.

1562
01:31:16,433 --> 01:31:18,433
They felt sorry for him.

1563
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,800
Because he had gone off the rail.

1564
01:31:21,733 --> 01:31:23,633
I geuss the charisma was truth.

1565
01:31:25,233 --> 01:31:29,466
Because that's really... what he

1566
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,633
That was his message.
His message was the truth.

1567
01:31:34,266 --> 01:31:35,266
And...

1568
01:31:36,366 --> 01:31:38,633
Everyone had to make that decision.

1569
01:31:39,066 --> 01:31:40,200
Whom do you believe?

1570
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,200
This man tells the truth.
Whom do you believe?

1571
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,800
In many ways, his life was a war.

1572
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,366
It's a war story. But it's a war
against what Christ said

1573
01:31:53,766 --> 01:31:57,333
is against the powers
and the principalities not of this world.

1574
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,100
And he dedicated himself 150% to that.

1575
01:32:02,366 --> 01:32:05,366
He was just the most fascinating
person I've ever met in my life.

1576
01:32:05,666 --> 01:32:06,733
Hands down.

1577
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:08,766
That's it.

1578
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:13,000
There is hope, more than hope.

1579
01:32:13,066 --> 01:32:14,666
We have surety.

1580
01:32:15,633 --> 01:32:18,400
We are assured that everything is going
to be

1581
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,400
optimum and better than it was before.

1582
01:32:22,466 --> 01:32:25,700
But we also have the assurance
that Christ had

1583
01:32:25,766 --> 01:32:28,500
when he knew that he would
rise again on the third day

1584
01:32:28,566 --> 01:32:31,066
and ascend gloriously into heaven.
and reign for ever

1585
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,766
He knew and we know
that in between us,

1586
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,200
and that successful
outcome of our present quandary

1587
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:40,800
and misery
is going to be extremely painful.

1588
01:32:41,033 --> 01:32:43,466
We know that from history.
We know that from scripture.

1589
01:32:43,533 --> 01:32:47,433
We know that the worst is yet
to become before it turns around.

1590
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:52,233
So we are commenting on a dire situation
into which we have been plunged.

1591
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:55,066
Not by God,
but by the mistakes of men,

1592
01:32:55,133 --> 01:32:57,500
the mistakes of popes,
the mistakes of bishops,

1593
01:32:57,566 --> 01:33:00,100
the mistakes of priests,
the mistakes of nuns

1594
01:33:00,166 --> 01:33:03,633
and the mistakes of lay people.
Everybody has their share in it.

1595
01:33:05,366 --> 01:33:08,466
But God's law is
that he purnishes the whole race

1596
01:33:08,533 --> 01:33:09,766
for the sins of few.

1597
01:33:29,733 --> 01:33:32,066
There is one more thing about Lucifer

1598
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:34,566
which we should remember,
and it's this,

1599
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:38,100
We have no protection against him.

1600
01:33:38,733 --> 01:33:40,000
Of ourselves.

1601
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:41,800
No one can match him.

1602
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:43,366
On this earth.

1603
01:33:44,566 --> 01:33:45,433
No one.

1604
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,500
-I am sorry
-I am sorry

1605
01:33:54,566 --> 01:33:57,500
-for having offended thee.
-for having offended thee.

1606
01:33:57,566 --> 01:34:01,133
-And I detest my sins
-And I detest my sins

1607
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,233
-above every other evil
-above every other evil

1608
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:08,400
-because they displease thee, my God
-because they displease thee, my God

1609
01:34:08,466 --> 01:34:11,533
-And I firmly resolve,
-And I firmly resolve,

1610
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:14,133
-by thy holy grace,
-by thy holy grace,

1611
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:17,466
-never more to offend thee,
-never more to offend thee,

1612
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:21,066
-but to amend my life. Amen.
-but to amend my life. Amen.

1613
01:34:39,533 --> 01:34:43,433
My friends, this is the blessed sacrament.

1614
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:46,133
I always carry it with me.

1615
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,800
He has been with us
 all this time.

1616
01:34:50,566 --> 01:34:52,500
-Amen.
-Amen.

1617
01:34:53,233 --> 01:34:55,066
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1618
01:34:55,133 --> 01:34:58,733
I didn't know that.
I didn't know he'd been with us.

1619
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,566
Father Martin carries
the big guns, Lorraine.
