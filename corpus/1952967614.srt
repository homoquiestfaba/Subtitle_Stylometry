1
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,167
Joy?

2
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:23,797
Yeah?

3
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:26,840
You okay?

4
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:28,671
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,644
You sure?

6
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:39,017
Ever since we got here,
you seem a little... upset.

7
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:40,983
Oh, no, no.

8
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:45,524
Just a little... déjà vu.

9
00:01:48,494 --> 00:01:51,258
They have a lot of vegetarian options here,
you know.

10
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,829
Oh, I know.

11
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:55,229
And, uh, I'm happy.

12
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,825
Really. Promise.

13
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,304
Okay.

14
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,464
Well, I, um -

15
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:08,043
I bought you a little present.

16
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,876
Joy? Joy, what's wrong?

17
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:17,179
I -

18
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:20,380
- What? Is - Is it your period?
- No.

19
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:23,423
I'm so sorry, Allen.

20
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:26,256
It's okay.

21
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:29,762
I'm okay.

22
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:32,856
Here, let me open it now.

23
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,038
It's an original Gainsford reproduction.

24
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,266
Late 1880s.

25
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:44,037
Oh. Where -Where did you find this?

26
00:02:44,143 --> 00:02:45,804
eBay.

27
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,972
- Oh, Allen. You did this?
- Look at the side.

28
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:54,078
Isn't that amazing?
I found it just like that.

29
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:56,916
Antique.

30
00:02:57,022 --> 00:02:58,649
What, you don't like it?

31
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:04,284
I'm sorry, Allen.
I didn't mean to.

32
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:08,423
It's nothing.

33
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:09,965
You sure?

34
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,694
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

35
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,833
You're welcome.

36
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,931
Happy-

37
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:22,740
Happy-

38
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,579
Happy anniversary.

39
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:29,208
Allen. Allen, I really do like it.

40
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:32,445
I'm sorry. It's just -

41
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:36,012
You know how you always said
a person should forgive?

42
00:03:36,124 --> 00:03:37,853
Forgive and forget. Yes.

43
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,793
Well, so I thought that
I should try to be more open.

44
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:43,089
Uh-huh.

45
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:45,630
- 'Cause I've been really trying,Joy.
- Mm-hmm.

46
00:03:45,732 --> 00:03:47,825
- No more cocaine.
- Uh-uh.

47
00:03:47,934 --> 00:03:49,367
- No more crack.
- Uh-uh.

48
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:52,029
- No more crack cocaine.
- Uh-uh.

49
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,698
No more hanging around
doing nothing without a job.

50
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:55,933
Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:59,478
No more sarcastic remarks
or physical attacks aimed at my boss.

52
00:03:59,578 --> 00:04:00,875
Uh-huh.

53
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,746
No more helping old gang members
with burglaries and armed robberies.

54
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:05,474
Uh-huh.

55
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:09,610
No more getting into fights with strangers,
waking up in the gutter.

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,277
Uh-huh.

57
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:14,346
Oh,Joy. It's been
like a never-ending struggle.

58
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:20,062
And I keep fighting it,
but it's just this one thing I can't stop.

59
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:22,563
- I'm trying awful hard -
- Hello.

60
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,565
Are you ready to ord -

61
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,498
Oh, sorry. Do you need some more time?

62
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:29,264
No, no. We're ready.

63
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:31,340
- Yeah.
- Um...

64
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,002
I was wondering if you could
please tell us if you have any specials.

65
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:40,681
Miss?

66
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,217
Say again?

67
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:52,318
I - I was wondering if you could please
tell us if there's any specials, I mean.

68
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,057
What did you say?

69
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,221
I - I, uh -

70
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,134
I was wondering if-

71
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,963
I know who you are.

72
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,229
I'm-I'm sorry. Do I know -

73
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,702
- Fuckin' pervert!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

74
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,572
What are you wearin' underneath,
motherfuckin' scum?

75
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,112
Miss, he's changed.
He doesn't do that anymore.

76
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:18,079
We even threw out the phone book.

77
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,808
Really. He's a different person.

78
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:22,009
His voice is the same. Motherfucker.

79
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:34,826
Allen?

80
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,426
You don't still -

81
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:41,265
Just -Just a little.

82
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,497
On Sundays.

83
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:07,955
"What the heck are you doing?"

84
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:13,130
Oh!

85
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,138
You know -
You know what I like about you?

86
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,299
What? What?

87
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:29,106
You're so... normal.

88
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:31,010
Me?

89
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:35,347
It feels so good to be with someone
who isn't... weird.

90
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:37,146
Or screwed up.

91
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:40,245
Or sicko-pervy.

92
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,921
Oh. So, uh -

93
00:06:45,861 --> 00:06:48,853
- Are your kids off at college?
- I wish.

94
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:52,490
Mine are all out of the house.
Hell, I'm out of the house.

95
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Kicked out, that is.

96
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:57,296
Oh. Feeling lonely?

97
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:58,872
Well -

98
00:07:00,107 --> 00:07:03,133
Divorce isn't easy after 35 years together.

99
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,241
Hell.

100
00:07:06,912 --> 00:07:09,710
I haven't even been with a woman
outside of Marj.

101
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:14,348
I'm not sure I would, uh -
would know what to do.

102
00:07:14,453 --> 00:07:16,648
Harvey. It's okay.

103
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:17,881
It's okay.

104
00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,219
What you're feeling is normal.

105
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:23,761
I can't - I can't talk about my sex life.

106
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,795
- I can't talk about mine either.
- There's so much I don't understand.

107
00:07:26,898 --> 00:07:29,662
Sometimes it's better not to understand.

108
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:37,498
My son, Mark- he's a great kid.

109
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:41,043
You know, he's a little troubled -
just feels a little paranoid.

110
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:44,510
But he's - he's really a very sweet kid.

111
00:07:44,614 --> 00:07:46,309
I know. Good heart.

112
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:49,315
Anyway, so he moved down here.

113
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:52,746
I wanted to be near him, you know...

114
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:55,550
help him adjust,
make sure that he doesn't get...

115
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:59,392
misinterpreted.

116
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:03,189
So I moved here also.

117
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:04,764
Oh.

118
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,436
That is so... beautiful.

119
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,060
Ah, he's a beautiful son.

120
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,105
You're a beautiful father.

121
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,038
- And you're -
- Don't say it.

122
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,406
Say it.

123
00:08:24,616 --> 00:08:26,083
Say what?

124
00:08:26,184 --> 00:08:27,651
Nothing.

125
00:08:37,094 --> 00:08:39,221
You look like a tulip.

126
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:42,461
Trish.

127
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,699
I can't afford to fail, not again.

128
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,796
I hate failure.

129
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:55,477
More water?

130
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:59,371
And for you?

131
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:05,808
You know, I first met Marj
on a blind date.

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,252
Bill and I met on a blind date too.

133
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:15,159
- Harvey.
- Yes?

134
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:17,730
Have you ever been to Israel?

135
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:20,665
No. No.

136
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:25,063
But it's where I want to be buried.

137
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,465
Oh, my God.

138
00:09:28,874 --> 00:09:32,810
Me too. Me too.

139
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,379
Well -

140
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,288
- Um -
- Hey.

141
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:55,820
Oh, my God.

142
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:57,626
You're so not my type...

143
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:00,396
but I - I don't know
what's coming over me.

144
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,061
Love, Trish.

145
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,638
Love.

Hi, Mom.

Hi, hon.

161
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:10,228
- Chloe in bed?
- Yeah.

162
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:13,596
But how come you're back so late?
It's after midnight.

163
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,168
Oh, Timmy. Timmy.

164
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:18,938
What?

165
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,203
I'm in love.

166
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,137
Really? But you just met him.

167
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:29,942
I know, but -

168
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:32,574
What's he like?
Is he like Dad was?

169
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:35,414
Oh, no. He's totally different.

170
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,421
Harvey's, um -

171
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,188
Harvey's a real man.

172
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,557
But Dad was a real man also.

173
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,128
Yes, but -

174
00:11:46,096 --> 00:11:49,395
I don't know how to put this,
but it's like -

175
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,293
He has this power.

176
00:11:56,072 --> 00:11:57,300
What do you mean?

177
00:11:57,407 --> 00:12:00,501
I mean like -

178
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:05,547
He just touched me...

179
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:09,583
touched my elbow right here
just like this, and -

180
00:12:10,718 --> 00:12:13,710
- And -
- And what?

181
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:20,688
I got... wet all over.

182
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:23,957
Just by touching your elbow?

183
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:27,500
I know. It sounds so strange,
and it's so hard to explain.

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,363
But it's like...

185
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,899
I felt things I never knew
I could feel.

186
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:34,997
Like what?

187
00:12:35,107 --> 00:12:36,836
Like -

188
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:41,806
Like a tulip just opening her petals.

189
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:44,314
You felt like a tulip?

190
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,715
Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?

191
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:50,344
How can I be
talking about this with you?

192
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,752
What? Hello!

193
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:55,621
But, Mom, why?

194
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:58,696
- Why can't you explain?
- Because.

195
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:01,297
You're still a child.

196
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:03,491
But I'm almost -

197
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:06,534
I'm almost a man.

198
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,695
A man.

199
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,773
Are you still wet?

200
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,172
Oh, no. I...

201
00:13:16,745 --> 00:13:19,305
dried myself with a paper towel.

202
00:13:19,413 --> 00:13:21,108
Now come. Let's go to bed.

203
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:55,076
Hello. Who is this, please?

204
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:58,882
Hello?

205
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,187
<i>Hello?</i>

206
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:18,501
Oh,Joy!

207
00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:32,043
The schmuck! All men are schmucks.

208
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:33,172
Really, he's not.

209
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:37,309
We just need a little time apart
to, um, reevaluate.

210
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,251
Wake up and smell the coffee.

211
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:41,619
He's a perv through and through.

212
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:44,693
Born a perv. He'll die a perv.

213
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:05,310
Mom, are you okay?

214
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,879
I'm sorry.

215
00:20:08,047 --> 00:20:12,040
It's just that I know
it's sadness that's brought you here.

216
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:15,018
And I probably shouldn't say this, but...

217
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,883
I'm so happy you're here.

218
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,350
I've missed you so much.

219
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:23,592
And you never visit.

220
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:26,926
And I know -who am I?

221
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,397
But I've been so lonely...

222
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,094
since that prick, your father, left me.

223
00:20:32,202 --> 00:20:33,601
Oh, Mom.

224
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:35,763
But what about Trish? Doesn't she -

225
00:20:35,872 --> 00:20:37,635
Trish has a life.

226
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,231
She has three kids, a real job.

227
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,207
And your other sister, Helen - I'm sorry.

228
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:52,781
Now, come, you're gonna have
a whole new outlook on things.

229
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:57,551
And you're never gonna want
to go back to New Jersey... ever again.

230
00:21:36,727 --> 00:21:39,457
<i># I heard somebody say #</i>

231
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:42,895
<i># That the war ended today #</i>

232
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:48,166
<i># But everybody knows
it's goin'still #</i>

233
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:56,434
<i># Our mother lands and mother seas
Here's what we believe #</i>

234
00:21:56,544 --> 00:22:00,344
<i># It's simple
We don't wanna kill #</i>

235
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:33,006
Good evening. Can I help you?

236
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,936
Yes. I'd like to sit down.

237
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:39,414
And how many are you?

238
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,012
One.

239
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:43,847
Do you have a reservation?

240
00:22:43,953 --> 00:22:46,183
No.

241
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,189
Let me see what's available then.

242
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:53,329
Great. Come right this way.

243
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:05,233
Here now.

244
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:07,534
A waiter will take care of you
in just a moment.

245
00:23:07,642 --> 00:23:09,837
Would you like
something to drink in the meantime?

246
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:14,506
No, thank you.

247
00:23:14,614 --> 00:23:16,081
Great.

248
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:44,601
Um, hi.

249
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,978
Andy.

250
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,445
Can I join you?

251
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:54,516
Oh, please.

252
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:56,016
Please sit down.

253
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:02,290
I've missed you.

254
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,153
Oh, God. Andy.

255
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,726
I've missed you too.

256
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:07,795
I felt so bad for what I did.

257
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:11,260
It was my fault.

258
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,662
No.

259
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:15,635
No, it wasn't. It was mine.

260
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:17,431
I shouldn't have -

261
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:24,001
It must have taken... a lot of courage.

262
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,105
I don't know.

263
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,476
I was just so sad.

264
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,414
I don't remember much.

265
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,750
It was so long ago, but I think
I must have done it the right way...

266
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:41,188
because I wasn't really conscious
of anything happening.

267
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:43,523
That's good.

268
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:48,790
The plastic bag was probably key.

269
00:24:48,899 --> 00:24:49,558
Without it -

270
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,896
Oh. That would have been horrible.

271
00:24:52,002 --> 00:24:53,196
Too horrible.

272
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:57,172
- You could've ended up -
- A vegetable. I know.

273
00:25:00,276 --> 00:25:03,245
I always felt so guilty.

274
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:06,644
No. No, you shouldn't have.

275
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,014
I -

276
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:12,587
I guess I just overreacted.

277
00:25:15,156 --> 00:25:17,090
I should have married you.

278
00:25:17,191 --> 00:25:19,159
Really?

279
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,352
You think you would have been
happy with me?

280
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:24,260
It was a beautiful ashtray
that you gave me.

281
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,355
My name engraved.

282
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,026
Oh, I should have -

283
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:30,864
I shouldn't have spoken
the way I did.

284
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,268
I should've let you
just keep the ashtray.

285
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:35,067
That's okay.

286
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:38,268
Things worked out all right in the end.

287
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,504
I - I mean -

288
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:47,609
Do you miss life?

289
00:25:50,488 --> 00:25:53,082
I don't know.

290
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,657
I miss -

291
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:59,126
I miss my room...

292
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:02,563
my laser disc collection.

293
00:26:02,665 --> 00:26:05,190
I spent so many years -

294
00:26:08,037 --> 00:26:11,370
I'm sorry I said you were shit
and I was champagne.

295
00:26:11,473 --> 00:26:14,533
That's okay. That's okay.

296
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:17,244
Sometimes the truth -

297
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:21,949
I think it's made me a better person.

298
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:27,050
Do you think we could have
another go at it?

299
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,484
Like on a trial basis.

300
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,853
But, Andy, I'm married.

301
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,653
That's okay.

302
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,625
No one has to know.
It would be our secret.

303
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,663
Just you and me, together.

304
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,993
I have so many problems, Andy.

305
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,028
My husband and I -

306
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,330
I don't know what to do. He's -

307
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,964
Oh, and I feel so betrayed.

308
00:26:50,074 --> 00:26:52,008
Sometimes, cheating can help a marriage.

309
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,840
No. No, don't say that.
Cheating is wrong.

310
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:57,675
Unfair. It's hurtful.

311
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,114
One man for the rest of your life?
It's unnatural.

312
00:27:00,217 --> 00:27:02,583
Oh, but I'm trying to improve things.

313
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:07,546
Tell me,Joy, please...

314
00:27:07,657 --> 00:27:11,093
after all that's passed,
knowing all you know now...

315
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:15,693
do you wish you could've
been with me before?

316
00:27:19,634 --> 00:27:21,101
No.

317
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:28,607
Eat shit, you fucking cunt.

318
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:31,837
You think you're improving
other people's lives...

319
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:34,379
saving them or freeing them -
from what?

320
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,607
The fuck do you know
about other people?

321
00:27:36,716 --> 00:27:39,276
What? Idiot!

322
00:27:39,386 --> 00:27:41,377
Why did I kill myself?

323
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,182
I should've killed you!

324
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,048
- Mom!
- Yes, Timmy?

325
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,616
Is Dad really dead?

326
00:28:14,717 --> 00:28:16,844
Why are you asking me this now?

327
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:19,420
Avi Fleischer told me
he found him on the Internet...

328
00:28:19,521 --> 00:28:22,149
and that he was sent to jail
for raping young boys.

329
00:28:22,257 --> 00:28:25,226
And now everyone at school
is saying that my dad's alive...

330
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:27,022
and that he's a pedophile.

331
00:28:27,128 --> 00:28:30,495
- Oh, Timmy. Shh, shh. It's okay.
- Then he said he was a faggot.

332
00:28:30,598 --> 00:28:33,863
- Oh, Timmy.
- And then he said that I was a faggot.

333
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,596
- So I -
- Timmy, what did you do?

334
00:28:36,704 --> 00:28:40,401
I didn't do anything.
I just ran away-

335
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:42,372
like a faggot.

336
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:43,500
Oh, Timmy, listen to me.

337
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,908
You are not a faggot, and your father-

338
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:49,207
He's alive?

339
00:28:49,315 --> 00:28:51,180
And he's a -

340
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,547
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

341
00:28:53,652 --> 00:28:57,019
I thought it would be better
for you to think that -

342
00:28:57,122 --> 00:28:59,352
to think that maybe he was in heaven.

343
00:28:59,457 --> 00:29:01,220
- But I could've helped him.
- No, honey.

344
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:04,419
No one could help him.
He-He was beyond help.

345
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:07,293
- Where is he now?
- Locked up, up north.

346
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:09,093
It doesn't matter.

347
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,565
- Does Billy know?
- Billy's older.

348
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:14,535
Billy's in college.

349
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,628
- I hate you.
- Timmy, please.

350
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,968
Please forgive me.

351
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:23,011
You-You have to understand
that I just wanted to protect you.

352
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:27,742
I just - I wanted you to grow up
free and happy, as if he were dead.

353
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,515
Fuck you, bitch.

354
00:29:44,331 --> 00:29:47,596
Mommy.

355
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:51,802
Yes, honey. Are you ready for me
to take you to karaoke class?

356
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:55,932
I ran out of my Klonopin.
Do you have any I can have first?

357
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,202
Of course, honey.
Just go into my medicine cabinet.

358
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,607
Okay.

359
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,909
Okay.

360
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,617
- Oh, God.
- I can't find it!

361
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:13,281
Just take half a Wellbutrin.

362
00:30:13,391 --> 00:30:17,020
They're on the bottom right,
next to the Percocet.

363
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:18,594
Okay!

364
00:30:20,664 --> 00:30:23,098
You know what?
Just bring over the whole bottle.

365
00:30:40,982 --> 00:30:42,449
Sweetheart.

366
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:51,489
Timmy.

367
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,793
I know how you must feel -

368
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:58,557
like I felt when I found out -

369
00:30:58,664 --> 00:31:01,224
like you were lied to.

370
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,893
And, yes, I did lie.

371
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:09,066
But I lied to you because I love you...

372
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:11,802
because I didn't want any harm
to come to you.

373
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:14,970
But what if I become one though?

374
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,047
I don't wanna be a faggot.

375
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:24,246
There's this kid in my language arts class,
and he's so gay.

376
00:31:24,354 --> 00:31:26,549
You won't. You won't.

377
00:31:27,657 --> 00:31:29,352
I promise.

378
00:31:30,392 --> 00:31:32,758
I'm sorry I called you "bitch. "

379
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:35,352
Oh.

380
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:37,160
It's okay, honey.

381
00:31:40,435 --> 00:31:43,165
Sweet dreams.

382
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:08,252
Mom.

383
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,523
- Are you okay, honey?
- Yes.

384
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,029
But I need to talk to you.

385
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,764
Uh-huh? Go on.

386
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:22,131
Well...

387
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,235
what exactly does a man do to a boy
when he's... raping him?

388
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,645
I mean, I know of course exactly
what you would do with a girl and all...

389
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:40,085
but with a boy, where do things go?

390
00:32:40,188 --> 00:32:43,055
Oh, Timmy. Oh, Timmy, Timmy.

391
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:44,888
Please tell me.

392
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:47,894
Really. I need to know.

393
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:51,261
- I'm almost a man.
- All right.

394
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:58,330
Well, you know how things
are different between boys and girls?

395
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,134
Yeah.

396
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,869
Well, uh...

397
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:07,913
they're the same between boys and boys.

398
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:09,878
Uh-huh.

399
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:13,043
So, well, it's like -

400
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:20,053
When Harvey touched me
for the first time on the elbow -

401
00:33:20,157 --> 00:33:22,523
That's all it takes is a touch.

402
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,322
Just a touch can be enough.

403
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,024
You mean, if a man just touches me -

404
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:31,795
No man should ever touch you.

405
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:35,837
But what if he does? Or by accident.

406
00:33:35,939 --> 00:33:38,100
You scream.

407
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:50,176
Avi Fleischer said
that pedophiles are terrorists...

408
00:33:50,284 --> 00:33:54,015
and that they stick their penises
into your... tushy.

409
00:33:54,122 --> 00:33:57,216
Avi Fleischer doesn't know
what he's talking about.

410
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:59,020
There are other things.

411
00:33:59,126 --> 00:34:04,530
Your father may have been a pedophile,
but he was also a man and a father...

412
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:06,963
- and some things -
- Oh, Mom.

413
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:10,969
I don't want anything ever
to go inside of me, not ever.

414
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,868
Oh, Timmy. Timmy, don't worry.

415
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:17,431
Don't worry. Nothing -
Nothing will ever get inside you!

416
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:19,703
Not so long as I'm around.

417
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:03,212
Mind if I join you?

418
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,355
Please.

419
00:40:10,626 --> 00:40:12,617
Forgive me. Please tell me you're straight.

420
00:40:14,129 --> 00:40:16,996
- I am.
- Oh, thank God.

421
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:23,062
So what are you doing here all alone?

422
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,638
Work.

423
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:28,837
- You like your work?
- It pays.

424
00:40:28,943 --> 00:40:30,968
Good. Then we don't have
to talk about it.

425
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:36,475
- Are you alone?
- Married.

426
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,441
Alone. The same thing.

427
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:42,385
No. Alone is alone.

428
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,485
I'm good at reading people, you know.

429
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:50,286
What do you read now?

430
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:52,296
Well, I see a man...

431
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:57,531
and he's alone, and he's straight.

432
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,102
That's good enough for me.

433
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:03,430
<i>You are good.</i>

434
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:06,236
My husband was a fag.

435
00:41:09,146 --> 00:41:11,376
Must have been hard.

436
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,846
Only man I ever loved.

437
00:41:15,218 --> 00:41:17,482
What happened to him?

438
00:41:17,586 --> 00:41:19,247
Stuff.

439
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:24,291
- Any kids?
- Not anymore.

440
00:41:24,392 --> 00:41:27,020
Just a pack of wolves,
and they're out for blood.

441
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:28,254
How so?

442
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:30,263
They've decided I'm the villain.

443
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:34,926
- I'm a monster.
- Why do they think that?

444
00:41:37,438 --> 00:41:39,406
'Cause I am a monster.

445
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:47,871
People can't help it...
if they're monsters.

446
00:41:50,248 --> 00:41:52,944
They can't be forgiven either.

447
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:54,541
Have you asked for forgiveness?

448
00:41:54,654 --> 00:41:56,451
I'm not a fool.

449
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,285
If I were them,
I wouldn't forgive me either.

450
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:03,122
In my family,
there are only winners and losers.

451
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:06,560
And only losers ask for forgiveness.

452
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:10,499
Only losers expect to get it.

453
00:42:15,371 --> 00:42:18,067
The world out there...

454
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:22,070
it can be harsh.

455
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:24,203
What the hell do you know
about the world out there...

456
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:27,942
that I don't already know... twice over?

457
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:33,082
The enemy's within.

458
00:42:41,461 --> 00:42:43,429
Your room have a view?

459
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,627
No.

460
00:42:50,837 --> 00:42:52,304
Same here.

461
00:42:53,606 --> 00:42:55,699
Who the fuck needs one anyway?

462
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:58,971
Why do you feel that way?

463
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,874
What are you, a shrink?

464
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:29,604
I need more than a caress.

465
00:44:24,054 --> 00:44:25,749
How much do you need?

466
00:44:25,854 --> 00:44:29,517
- What?
- It's okay.

467
00:44:29,626 --> 00:44:31,116
I understand.

468
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:34,128
It was hard work.

469
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:36,855
I'm old.

470
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:43,528
There's a stash in the Chanel -
the zippered pocket. Take it all.

471
00:45:01,087 --> 00:45:02,782
What are you looking at?

472
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:07,254
Don't start pretending like you care...

473
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,554
like I'm not a monster...

474
00:45:09,662 --> 00:45:12,927
like I still have a heart that -

475
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,430
Forgive me.

476
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:22,232
Fuck off, prick.

477
00:45:32,181 --> 00:45:34,706
What do you want, honey?
Let me just make it simple for her.

478
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,283
She's got some food issues.

479
00:45:36,386 --> 00:45:40,015
Let's just get a mesclun salad, no pepper.
Just very simple.

480
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:42,750
And I'll have the Salade Nioise
with the dressing on the side.

481
00:45:42,858 --> 00:45:44,689
- Perfect. It'll be right out.
- Thank you.

482
00:45:44,793 --> 00:45:48,593
Joy, I am so happy to see you.

483
00:45:48,696 --> 00:45:51,426
- I'm so happy to see you too.
- And you know something?

484
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:53,193
- What?
- You look good.

485
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:54,996
- Really?
- I mean it.

486
00:45:55,102 --> 00:45:57,400
You put some meat on your bones.

487
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,870
You used to look so peaked all the time.

488
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:03,909
I thought, "Maybe she's got
some rare blood disease.

489
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,444
But, Trish," I said, "Leave her alone.
She's old enough.

490
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:11,040
If she wants to be vegetarian
to prove some point, then, you know" -

491
00:46:12,284 --> 00:46:15,481
But, golly. So you're back
to eating red meat?

492
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:17,213
No.

493
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:21,487
Wow, even so. God knows how,
but that tofu is workin', girl.

494
00:46:21,592 --> 00:46:22,786
Thanks.

495
00:46:22,894 --> 00:46:24,828
You look good too.

496
00:46:24,929 --> 00:46:27,727
- You know what my secret is?
- What?

497
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:29,560
I met someone.

498
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:31,691
Really? Oh, that's great.

499
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:33,827
- And...
- And?

500
00:46:33,937 --> 00:46:35,495
we're getting married.

501
00:46:35,605 --> 00:46:37,197
- No!
- Yes!

502
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:38,967
Oh!

503
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:42,511
The kids haven't met him yet,
so provided they like him -

504
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:43,702
Oh, Trish.

505
00:46:43,812 --> 00:46:46,144
Billy I'm not worried about,
but Timmy and Chloe...

506
00:46:46,248 --> 00:46:48,182
they're - they're still children.

507
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:49,807
Oh, I know.

508
00:46:49,918 --> 00:46:52,682
It's a secret. No one knows -
not Helen, not even Mom.

509
00:46:52,787 --> 00:46:55,620
I promise. I won't tell a soul.

510
00:46:58,793 --> 00:47:03,127
But don't you think you're maybe...
rushing things a bit?

511
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:06,859
I mean, men are -

512
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,694
I don't know. And after Bill.

513
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:15,205
- Bill was totally different.
- Still.

514
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:18,300
No. No. The past is the past.

515
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,708
Dead. Gone. Wipe my hands.
Forgotten.

516
00:47:20,812 --> 00:47:22,609
It's got nothing to do
with me and the kids.

517
00:47:22,713 --> 00:47:26,945
- We live in Florida now.
- I'm sorry. Just -Just -

518
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:32,880
Now, Harvey, on the other hand,
well, he's not very attractive.

519
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,050
He's older.
He's not even that well off.

520
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,683
He's divorced.

521
00:47:37,794 --> 00:47:40,228
Poor thing had a horrible, horrible wife.

522
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,890
But he's Jewish. He's pro-Israel.

523
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:47,060
He did work for Bush and McCain,
but only because of Israel.

524
00:47:47,169 --> 00:47:50,730
He knows these people are complete idiots
otherwise, so don't worry.

525
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,866
Basically, he's just a plain,
totally family-oriented kind of guy.

526
00:47:54,977 --> 00:47:57,741
- He's a real mensch.
- Oh.

527
00:47:57,845 --> 00:48:01,281
Joy, I need this to work.

528
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,974
Have-Have you -

529
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:07,712
And was it -

530
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:10,052
So normal!

531
00:48:10,157 --> 00:48:14,491
- Oh, Trish, I'm so happy for you.
- Me too. Me too.

532
00:48:14,593 --> 00:48:18,120
But you -What about you?
You haven't told me a thing.

533
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:20,755
Oh. I'm fine. I'm -

534
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:25,866
- How's Allen?
- Oh, fine. Fine.

535
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,269
Just don't listen to Mom. Really.

536
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:32,434
Everything's the same - fine.

537
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:36,274
I just needed to get away for a bit.
A little me time.

538
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,046
What about your work with the ex-cons?
How's that going?

539
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,847
Oh, fine, fine. I miss them already.

540
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:45,580
But, my God.

541
00:48:45,688 --> 00:48:50,284
Working with those criminals
and-and... rapists. I -

542
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,525
I don't know,Joy. Don't you ever
think about working with -

543
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:57,894
with the victims - good people?

544
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:00,797
Not all criminals and rapists
are bad, Trish.

545
00:49:00,901 --> 00:49:04,393
I don't know what your dictionary says,
but it's pretty clear in mine.

546
00:49:04,506 --> 00:49:06,269
But I'm sorry. I don't mean to criticize.

547
00:49:06,373 --> 00:49:08,432
It's your profession,
and I totally respect that.

548
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:11,534
It's just - I could never do it.

549
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:14,372
You're a saint. Really.

550
00:49:14,481 --> 00:49:16,472
Really, it's just a job.

551
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:17,881
All right now. Salade Nioise.

552
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:20,817
Oh, I'm sorry. I asked
for the dressing on the side.

553
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,581
Oh, I'm sorry.
We'll take care of that right away.

554
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:24,156
I'm sorry.

555
00:49:28,827 --> 00:49:33,491
You know,Joy,
there's something I never told you.

556
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:38,135
I guess being the older sister,
sibling rivalry and all -

557
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:39,999
But now that we're
so much more bonded -

558
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:45,532
I always believed deep down -

559
00:49:45,643 --> 00:49:47,508
and so did Mom and Dad and Helen...

560
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:50,739
'cause we discussed it all
so many times, but -

561
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:54,781
When you married Allen...

562
00:49:54,884 --> 00:49:57,375
w- we thought you were so...

563
00:49:58,854 --> 00:49:59,843
brave.

564
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,515
But... why?

565
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:06,857
I may as well confess.
I know everything. We all have.

566
00:50:07,929 --> 00:50:11,660
Allen's... problem, his -

567
00:50:13,935 --> 00:50:16,096
And how you tried so hard
to cure him...

568
00:50:16,203 --> 00:50:17,830
so he could be normal.

569
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:21,430
And how you eventually thought
he was cured - as if.

570
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,839
Joy, there are no secrets in the family.

571
00:50:23,943 --> 00:50:27,276
You of all people, you must know that by now.
You've always been an open book.

572
00:50:29,048 --> 00:50:30,948
But you seemed so desperately happy...

573
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:34,508
and we all so desperately
wanted you to be happy.

574
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:37,247
And it seemed like if it wasn't Allen, then -

575
00:50:39,724 --> 00:50:40,850
I'm sorry.

576
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:46,327
I'm so sorry, but it's important
that we be open with each other.

577
00:50:47,197 --> 00:50:51,395
Joy, you're a beautiful woman,
even if you're past your-

578
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:56,203
And I really think,
from the bottom of my heart...

579
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:58,206
that you should just drop him.

580
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:01,641
Drop your job, drop everything
and move to Florida.

581
00:51:01,743 --> 00:51:04,177
Down here, it's easy to forget everything...

582
00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:07,976
start over, fresh - like me -
as if you were still young.

583
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,644
I mean, what are you really gonna miss?
What matters more than family?

584
00:51:11,753 --> 00:51:14,221
Friends come and go.
Ajob is just a job.

585
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:18,224
Shopping, food, HBO -
everything here, same as anywhere else.

586
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,987
Joy, don't take this the wrong way.
I just -

587
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:25,959
I love you so much.

588
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:28,233
I love you.

589
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:41,309
Joy!

590
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:52,853
God.

591
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:57,984
I can't tell you how happy I am to see you,
how happy I am you found me.

592
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:01,121
- Oh, me too.
- I've been feeling so guilty.

593
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,256
Oh, but really, Helen,
you didn't do anything wrong.

594
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:06,767
I know, but still.

595
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:08,359
- Everyone understands.
- I know.

596
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:11,432
And I forgive them...

597
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:13,700
but even so -

598
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,811
Cutting ties with Mom, Dad,
Trish especially-

599
00:52:19,914 --> 00:52:21,541
it must have been hard.

600
00:52:21,649 --> 00:52:23,116
It was.

601
00:52:23,217 --> 00:52:25,845
Really, I can't tell you.

602
00:52:26,553 --> 00:52:28,453
I missed you, but -

603
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:31,648
It's all right. I understand.

604
00:52:32,892 --> 00:52:34,621
And I forgive you.

605
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:39,627
I just felt bad -
I mean, when I couldn't reach you...

606
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:42,063
'cause you were unlisted.

607
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:44,135
I had no choice.

608
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:50,570
I can't tell you,Joy, how many times
I thought about calling you.

609
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:51,733
Really?

610
00:52:52,743 --> 00:52:54,802
I was too guilt-ridden.

611
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:59,315
Oh, Helen. All this time, we all thought
you were just ashamed of us -

612
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:03,478
of being related to us, like it would
ruin your career or something.

613
00:53:03,586 --> 00:53:05,315
Ashamed?

614
00:53:05,422 --> 00:53:06,719
How could you -

615
00:53:06,823 --> 00:53:10,190
I'm sorry. I should have had more faith.
We all should have been more understanding.

616
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:12,692
I was going through a very intense time.

617
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:15,663
I'd given up on poetry.

618
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:18,164
It had become too -

619
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:20,326
too easy.

620
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:25,338
And I was feeling crushed
by the enormity of my success.

621
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,738
And I was afraid.

622
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,737
But you know something?

623
00:53:31,945 --> 00:53:37,076
It turns out writing a good screenplay
is a much harder...

624
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:43,117
and purer process.

625
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:46,385
Still, it must at least be neat
going out with Keanu.

626
00:53:46,492 --> 00:53:49,086
There's nothing neat about it.

627
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,794
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid thing to say.

628
00:53:51,897 --> 00:53:54,695
- It's fucking idiotic.
- You're right.

629
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:58,758
I mean, like, we're still a country at war!

630
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,305
<i>Oh, God.</i>

631
00:54:11,714 --> 00:54:13,682
Salman again.

632
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:17,678
He wants to know
what he should wear to the Emmys.

633
00:54:17,786 --> 00:54:19,219
Kwaku?

634
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:26,692
So, how long do you plan
on staying out here?

635
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,262
Oh, I don't know.

636
00:54:28,362 --> 00:54:32,059
I thought maybe if I could stay with you
just till I got my life together.

637
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,059
- How much time are we talking?
- I don't know.

638
00:54:35,169 --> 00:54:38,730
I'm sure I could find a job within
a couple of months - or weeks.

639
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:41,307
Days if I really set my mind to it.

640
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,897
And what are you gonna do out here?

641
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:44,567
Try working with ex-cons again.

642
00:54:44,677 --> 00:54:47,510
I've had a lot of success
with penitentiaries back east.

643
00:54:47,614 --> 00:54:50,082
And California, well -

644
00:54:50,183 --> 00:54:53,380
There are so many prisons here,
so I thought that I could maybe -

645
00:54:53,485 --> 00:54:58,081
- And if that doesn't work out?
- Oh, anything. Really, anything's fine.

646
00:54:58,189 --> 00:54:59,156
Anything?

647
00:54:59,257 --> 00:55:00,815
Yeah, anything.

648
00:55:02,426 --> 00:55:04,291
Say, do you know Joni Mitchell?

649
00:55:04,395 --> 00:55:05,862
I heard she lives out here...

650
00:55:05,963 --> 00:55:07,931
and she's someone I've always thought
I'd really connect with...

651
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,726
like she'd really get me, you know?

652
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:11,994
Maybe she could give me some advice.

653
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:13,569
Can I give you some advice?

654
00:55:13,669 --> 00:55:14,761
Oh, please.

655
00:55:16,673 --> 00:55:19,141
No. Actually, I have no advice for you.

656
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,253
Did I say something wrong?

657
00:55:36,357 --> 00:55:38,291
No. Why?

658
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:41,790
Then why do you still
have to make fun of me?

659
00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:44,797
Make fun?

660
00:55:44,898 --> 00:55:46,126
Yes.

661
00:55:46,233 --> 00:55:48,133
I'm not -

662
00:55:48,868 --> 00:55:52,065
Oh, God. Please,Joy.

663
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:54,662
I try. I really do.

664
00:55:54,773 --> 00:55:59,005
But you and Keanu and everyone...

665
00:55:59,111 --> 00:56:01,102
thinks I mock them...

666
00:56:01,213 --> 00:56:04,808
that I'm cruel and condescending,
that I have no heart.

667
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:08,079
And it's really hard.

668
00:56:08,185 --> 00:56:12,485
It's hard on me,
because I really do love you.

669
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:13,989
I do.

670
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:17,925
And I know how you didn't come
all this way and hunt me down for nothing.

671
00:56:18,027 --> 00:56:23,260
You really just want my advice
on men and marriage and Allen...

672
00:56:23,365 --> 00:56:24,832
and why nothing works out...

673
00:56:24,934 --> 00:56:26,697
and you feel like a total loser-

674
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,998
the self-disgust, self-loathing.

675
00:56:29,104 --> 00:56:33,165
Life has no point, it's over,
you're basically dead...

676
00:56:33,275 --> 00:56:37,041
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and you think maybe I have the answer.

677
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:40,910
But,Joy, I'm only human.

678
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:44,017
I'm sorry.

679
00:56:44,118 --> 00:56:46,746
It's my fault. I shouldn't have.

680
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:48,684
No. It's okay.

681
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,685
I'm used to that. I can take it.

682
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:55,288
But thanks.

683

I'm sorry about before.

698
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,461
It's just I'm off my medication and -

699
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:49,440
Really, I didn't mean what I said.

700
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:53,070
What are you doing here?

701
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,738
I don't know.

702
00:57:55,848 --> 00:58:01,252
I saw you all alone, and I thought -

703
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,281
What?

704
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,493
Was your song about me?

705
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,988
No.

706
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:19,436
You know...

707
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:23,440
just listening to Helen and Keanu, I -

708
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,007
I can't help but thinking -

709
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:27,802
What?

710
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:32,313
What about you and I spend the night
together,just like old times?

711
00:58:33,216 --> 00:58:35,946
But we never spent the night
together before.

712
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:39,446
Old times?

713
00:58:39,555 --> 00:58:41,955
We never did anything.

714
00:58:42,057 --> 00:58:44,116
I wouldn't let anything happen.

715
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:48,286
Wouldn't you like to change things?

716
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:50,057
Change the past?

717
00:58:51,232 --> 00:58:53,166
Fix everything like it could have been?

718
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:55,866
Done the right thing?

719
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:58,200
Oh, Andy.

720
00:58:58,305 --> 00:59:00,603
Sometimes -

721
00:59:00,707 --> 00:59:03,801
Sometimes it's better to just...

722
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:06,503
let go.

723
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:17,111
Do you think Helen's happy?

724
00:59:17,756 --> 00:59:19,246
Yes.

725
00:59:20,091 --> 00:59:21,888
I think she's faking it.

726
00:59:23,495 --> 00:59:26,396
Sometimes just pretending
can be better than the real thing.

727
00:59:26,964 --> 00:59:29,558
Oh, but I hate pretending.

728
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,632
Everyone pretending.

729
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,007
I'm not pretending.

730
00:59:45,614 --> 00:59:50,642
Imagine a world where no one pretended.

731
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:20,809
Please forgive me.

732
01:00:20,913 --> 01:00:24,371
I tried, but I just can't fake it.

733
01:00:32,023 --> 01:00:33,490
Come on,Joy.

734
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:35,218
- Come on. Joy!
- No. No.

735
01:00:35,325 --> 01:00:39,125
- Come on,Joy. Joy. Joy.
- No. No.

736
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:45,330
Back off, motherfucker!

737
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:11,251
<i>- Hi. this is Joy.
- And this is Allen.</i>

738
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:14,758
<i>Please leave a message
at the sound of the-</i>

739
01:01:16,696 --> 01:01:18,163
<i>Allen?</i>

740
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:22,926
<i>I just wanted to tell you
that I'm coming home.</i>

741
01:01:23,668 --> 01:01:26,762
<i>I- I miss you.</i>

742
01:01:26,871 --> 01:01:31,308
<i>I'm sorry.
but relationships are so complicated.</i>

743
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:35,637
<i>Sometimes I ask myself.
what am I doing?</i>

744
01:01:35,746 --> 01:01:37,543
<i>Why are we fighting?</i>

745
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:39,445
<i>Why does anyone fight?</i>

746
01:01:39,549 --> 01:01:41,312
<i>What good does it do?</i>

747
01:01:41,986 --> 01:01:46,150
<i>Your problem - well. it just seems
so unimportant now.</i>

748
01:01:46,256 --> 01:01:49,953
<i>It's probably psychological or genetic.
I really don't care.</i>

749
01:01:50,492 --> 01:01:53,120
<i>I forgive you.
if forgiveness even mattered.</i>

750
01:01:53,228 --> 01:01:59,167
<i>Really. all I want is just to be with you
and my ex-cons and security guard friends...</i>

751
01:01:59,268 --> 01:02:02,294
<i>maybe have a heart-to-heart
with that poor waitress.</i>

752
01:02:03,671 --> 01:02:07,129
<i>Oh. Allen. I just hope you haven't been
too depressed or anything.</i>

753
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,902
<i>But don't worry. I'm on my way.</i>

754
01:02:10,011 --> 01:02:11,774
<i>And I love you.</i>

755
01:02:33,431 --> 01:02:35,922
Oh! Yeah!

756
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:40,766
Fuck family.

757
01:02:41,939 --> 01:02:43,736
Fuck motherhood.

758
01:02:44,875 --> 01:02:46,433
Fuck the kids.

759
01:02:48,077 --> 01:02:50,102
I just don't care anymore.

760
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:02,181
What I said before -
about the kids and family-

761
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:03,917
I didn't really mean it.

762
01:03:06,795 --> 01:03:08,262
I know.

763
01:03:13,968 --> 01:03:16,163
Love really can change a person.

764
01:03:38,423 --> 01:03:40,186
Don't ever leave me.

765
01:03:41,659 --> 01:03:43,388
I won't survive it.

766
01:03:43,494 --> 01:03:45,121
Promise me.

767
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:54,398
<i>- Mommy?
- Yes, Honey?</i>

768
01:03:54,504 --> 01:03:57,439
Do you think baby carrots feel pain?

769
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:01,610
Timmy, could you get the door?

770
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,007
Sure, Mom.

771
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:06,807
Hi. Hi. Harvey Wiener.

772
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:08,906
Nice to meet you.
You must be Timmy.

773
01:04:09,017 --> 01:04:11,144
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. That's my son, Mark.

774
01:04:11,252 --> 01:04:15,586
Hi! Oh! Look at those tulips.
Those are beautiful.

775
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,248
Red for love.

776
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:19,121
What about the white?

777
01:04:19,226 --> 01:04:21,091
Uh -

778
01:04:21,194 --> 01:04:22,923
- Timmy!
- Uh, for forgiveness.

779
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,157
- I'm sorry if we're a little early.
- Oh, please. Come on in.

780
01:04:25,264 --> 01:04:27,926
- Mark, hi. I'm Trish. It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, my God, who's that?

781
01:04:28,035 --> 01:04:30,435
Timmy, get the door, sweetheart.
This is Chloe. Say hi.

782
01:04:30,536 --> 01:04:32,936
- Oh, hi, Chloe.
- Come on, sweetheart. Say hi.

783
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,199
Hi. How are you?

784
01:04:34,307 --> 01:04:35,934
Mmm!

785
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:40,102
Mmm! This chicken - out of this world.

786
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:41,974
Really? It's not too dry?

787
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,071
Oh, like butter. Mmm!

788
01:04:44,182 --> 01:04:45,672
Oh, and the sauce.

789
01:04:45,784 --> 01:04:48,275
- It's Israeli style.
- Ah.

790
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:52,822
Mommy, the baby carrots -
they're looking so sad.

791
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:55,517
Aw. Shoot 'em on over.
I'll cheer 'em up.

792
01:04:56,794 --> 01:04:59,456
- Thank you.
- Chloe is studying karaoke after school.

793
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,328
- Her teacher thinks she has a lot of potential.
- Oh, I'll bet.

794
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05,628
Would you like to sing
for Harvey after dinner, Chloe?

795
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:19,002
Sorry. It's the Klonopin.
She's on a new dosage.

796
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:22,310
Mm-hmm. I see. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

797
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:26,780
So, Mark, what do you do?

798
01:05:26,887 --> 01:05:28,184
Systems analysis.

799
01:05:28,288 --> 01:05:30,051
That sounds interesting.

800
01:05:30,156 --> 01:05:33,387
It is to me - moderately.
Like intermediate-level Sudoku.

801
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:37,651
But I have no illusions that what I do
is of any interest to anyone else...

802
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:39,891
even amongst specialists.

803
01:05:39,998 --> 01:05:43,195
I'm something of a functionary,
but without ambition...

804
01:05:43,302 --> 01:05:45,327
or even hope of ambition.

805
01:05:45,436 --> 01:05:47,666
I plateaued in grad school,
then lost interest...

806
01:05:47,772 --> 01:05:52,072
except in maintaining a base salary adequate
to financing a low-overhead subsistence.

807
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:56,242
Are you seeing anyone?

808
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,440
No, I'm more focused on China.

809
01:05:58,548 --> 01:06:00,038
Everything else is history.

810
01:06:00,817 --> 01:06:02,478
It's just a question of time.

811
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:29,876
Talk to him.

812
01:06:36,417 --> 01:06:38,442
So, Timmy...

813
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:40,849
your mom tells me you're gonna
be bar mitzvahed soon.

814
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:42,887
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

815
01:06:42,988 --> 01:06:45,388
I remember my bar mitzvah.

816
01:06:45,491 --> 01:06:47,356
You remember yours, Mark?

817
01:06:51,163 --> 01:06:54,155
Timmy's preparing a special speech -
a D'var Torah. Isn't that right?

818
01:06:54,265 --> 01:06:55,994
- Oh.
- Yeah.

819
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,567
Mmm. What's the topic?

820
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:59,329
It's on becoming a man.

821
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:00,928
Oh. Interesting.

822
01:07:01,038 --> 01:07:05,065
Actually, it's mainly about the story
ofJoseph and forgiveness.

823
01:07:05,176 --> 01:07:09,078
Like when you're supposed to forgive
someone, even if you don't want to...

824
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:12,342
and how that makes you a man -
things like that.

825
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:14,144
Like "forgive and forget"?

826
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,650
Well, like for example...

827
01:07:16,752 --> 01:07:19,243
say I...

828
01:07:19,354 --> 01:07:21,083
punched you in the face.

829
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:24,057
If I said I was sorry,
would you forgive me?

830
01:07:24,158 --> 01:07:26,854
Well, of course he would,
but why would you do such a thing?

831
01:07:26,962 --> 01:07:29,863
- That's not the point, Mom.
- No. I understand.

832
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:32,990
Yes, I would forgive you.

833
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,831
I think, uh, I would ask for an explanation.

834
01:07:36,937 --> 01:07:39,132
So that you believe I'm really sorry?

835
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:40,934
Well -

836
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:46,138
Look, um, like I told you,
I'm sure I would forgive you, but...

837
01:07:46,245 --> 01:07:49,442
well, I'm not sure that I would forget.

838
01:07:51,216 --> 01:07:56,051
But let's say, for example, a terrorist
blows up your office building.

839
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,851
- Do you still forgive?
- God forbid.

840
01:07:58,957 --> 01:08:01,050
But what if that terrorist
had a good reason?

841
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:03,821
Terrorists, by definition,
do not have good reasons.

842
01:08:03,927 --> 01:08:06,521
But what if your family
were killed and tortured?

843
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:10,259
Wouldn't you want to do something
about it, to protect others?

844
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,564
Timmy, these terrorists are evil.

845
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:15,137
And cowards.

846
01:08:15,238 --> 01:08:16,762
They're not like you and me.

847
01:08:16,873 --> 01:08:19,706
They don't believe
in freedom and democracy.

848
01:08:19,809 --> 01:08:21,299
Your mother's right.

849
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:26,347
Timmy, are you saying
you would forgive the 9/11 terrorists?

850
01:08:26,448 --> 01:08:29,474
<i>Well, of course you can't
forgive those terrorists.</i>

851
01:08:29,584 --> 01:08:31,051
They're dead.

852
01:08:34,088 --> 01:08:37,580
If it's possible to forgive and forget...

853
01:08:37,691 --> 01:08:39,659
or to forgive and not forget...

854
01:08:41,128 --> 01:08:43,995
when would you forget
but not forgive?

855
01:08:49,602 --> 01:08:53,197
I think it's possible
someone does something...

856
01:08:53,306 --> 01:08:55,103
really terrible to you -

857
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,533
like, really horrible -

858
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:04,648
something that hurts you so bad,
and it's so painful.

859
01:09:07,618 --> 01:09:11,179
Maybe then it's better to forget...

860
01:09:11,289 --> 01:09:13,553
and live without all that pain...

861
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:16,091
instead of forgiving and remembering.

862
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:02,133
Gumdrops?

863
01:10:12,844 --> 01:10:15,404
See, like, my dad
had this drinking problem...

864
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:16,979
which is, like, totally genetic.

865
01:10:17,081 --> 01:10:20,573
His father died at, like, 43 or something
from alcohol poisoning.

866
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,311
So, anyway, anytime something
would go wrong at work...

867
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:27,150
he'd go out, get plastered,
come home, punch out my mom...

868
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,917
like it was all her fault.

869
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:30,822
- Are they still married?
- Mmm.

870
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:32,394
Yeah. Still in love.

871
01:10:32,494 --> 01:10:33,927
- Oh, my God.
- Even though he -

872
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:34,996
Yes.

873
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,827
Whoa. That's, like, totally fucked.

874
01:10:37,932 --> 01:10:39,160
- Yeah.
- I know.

875
01:10:39,267 --> 01:10:40,234
Man.

876
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:42,098
Okay, Billy. It's your turn.

877
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,536
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on.

878
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:46,106
Yeah, everyone else has.

879
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:49,438
Who comes from the most fucked-up family?

880
01:10:49,542 --> 01:10:51,271
Whose parents are the most fucked up?

881
01:10:51,378 --> 01:10:52,845
Really, I can't compete.

882
01:10:52,947 --> 01:10:56,781
Billy, you're so weird. Don't tell me
you don't come from a fucked-up family.

883
01:10:57,550 --> 01:10:58,847
Really.

884
01:11:00,153 --> 01:11:02,883
My father died. That's about it.

885
01:11:02,988 --> 01:11:05,013
Was it suicide?

886
01:11:05,124 --> 01:11:06,113
No.

887
01:11:06,225 --> 01:11:07,852
Then how did he die?

888
01:11:09,862 --> 01:11:10,829
I forget.

889
01:11:10,929 --> 01:11:12,396
- Right.
- So lame.

890
01:11:12,497 --> 01:11:14,897
All right then. Looks like I win.

891
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:16,626
Yeah. Best vaginalogue.

892
01:11:16,734 --> 01:11:18,725
No, but really, her family
is the most fucked up.

893
01:11:18,835 --> 01:11:21,360
Yeah, but it's only because
she was a foster child.

894
01:11:21,472 --> 01:11:23,633
- Otherwise, I'd so win.
- Uh, I don't think so.

895
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:26,140
Uh, you weren't molested by your step-dad.

896
01:11:26,243 --> 01:11:31,146
Oh, boo-hoo. Sorry, Sarah,
but child molestation has been, like, so done.

897
01:11:31,247 --> 01:11:33,772
And he only used his fingers anyway.
Get over it.

898
01:11:38,154 --> 01:11:40,486
- Billy, where you going?
- Yeah, don't leave.

899
01:11:40,589 --> 01:11:42,318
- Hey, come on, Billy.
- Please stay.

900
01:11:42,424 --> 01:11:45,860
- Come on, we're just kidding around. Billy!
- Come on!

901
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:09,693
Billy.

902
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:16,407
Co - Come inside.

903
01:13:43,633 --> 01:13:45,897
I needed to see you.

904
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:50,065
How'd you find me?

905
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:51,571
Stopped by your mom's.

906
01:13:52,974 --> 01:13:54,908
She was out.
The house was empty.

907
01:14:00,214 --> 01:14:01,772
Do you want some water?

908
01:14:03,184 --> 01:14:04,378
Thanks.

909
01:14:42,219 --> 01:14:43,413
One more?

910
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,046
Yeah.

911
01:15:11,778 --> 01:15:14,008
Thanks. I needed that.

912
01:15:23,623 --> 01:15:25,591
So how's school?

913
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,482
Okay.

914
01:15:28,928 --> 01:15:30,395
What's your major?

915
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:33,529
Anthropology.

916
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,900
You planning on grad school?

917
01:15:37,835 --> 01:15:38,859
Probably.

918
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:41,062
- Get into research?
- Yeah.

919
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:43,531
Maybe.

920
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:48,672
I'm doing a paper on homosexuality
in the animal kingdom.

921
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:52,738
I've done a lot of reading
on the bonobo monkey.

922
01:15:52,849 --> 01:15:56,148
They share, like, 98%?
of the human genetic profile.

923
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:59,584
But they substitute sex for aggression...

924
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,054
and regularly engage in incest -

925
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,856
father/daughter, father/son...

926
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,157
mother/son.

927
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,262
It's a very peaceable lifestyle.

928
01:16:14,468 --> 01:16:15,765
Are you gay?

929
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:17,536
No.

930
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:20,169
Sure?

931
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:22,401
Yeah.

932
01:16:24,144 --> 01:16:25,611
So you like women?

933
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,877
Yeah.

934
01:16:31,016 --> 01:16:34,008
I mean, really like women?

935
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:36,086
Yes.

936
01:16:37,355 --> 01:16:41,416
Do you fantasize stripping them,
fucking them...

937
01:16:41,526 --> 01:16:42,993
raping them?

938
01:16:43,094 --> 01:16:44,925
Well, not -

939
01:16:45,028 --> 01:16:47,895
Not rape. Not really.

940
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:51,463
No rape fantasies?

941
01:16:53,337 --> 01:16:54,304
No.

942
01:16:56,039 --> 01:16:58,974
No, I - I don't think so.

943
01:17:08,183 --> 01:17:10,208
Got any more gumdrops?

944
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:14,988
Uh -

945
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:37,402
Why didn't you ever write?

946
01:17:39,578 --> 01:17:41,773
We didn't think it would be a good idea.

947
01:17:42,546 --> 01:17:44,980
- Your mother and I -
- She told everybody you were dead.

948
01:17:45,082 --> 01:17:46,982
Well, she was right.

949
01:17:49,086 --> 01:17:50,644
I went along.

950
01:17:51,922 --> 01:17:53,116
Good.

951
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,487
That's good.

952
01:17:59,661 --> 01:18:01,424
It's good you didn't write.

953
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:04,991
It's good you were dead.

954
01:18:09,204 --> 01:18:11,195
I tried to forget.

955
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:16,569
And then I tried to remember.

956
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:19,803
And I couldn't.

957
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:28,686
Me too.

958
01:18:32,192 --> 01:18:33,489
Forgive me.

959
01:18:33,593 --> 01:18:35,788
There's nothing to forgive.

960
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:40,293
I mean, it -

961
01:18:40,398 --> 01:18:42,958
It's all unforgivable.

962
01:18:43,836 --> 01:18:45,770
I have no sympathy for you.

963
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:54,036
They did a lot of work on me.

964
01:18:54,144 --> 01:18:55,577
"Work"?

965
01:18:56,614 --> 01:18:58,343
Rehabilitation.

966
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,717
And?

967
01:19:02,486 --> 01:19:04,283
I take medication.

968
01:19:07,723 --> 01:19:09,418
And-And that works?

969
01:19:09,524 --> 01:19:11,185
Nothing works.

970
01:19:11,861 --> 01:19:14,921
It just goes on... forever.

971
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:21,299
I just had to come and see
that you wouldn't...

972
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,870
become me.

973
01:19:27,775 --> 01:19:29,675
Cases - people like me.

974
01:19:31,845 --> 01:19:35,212
Genetically speaking, I'm lucky.

975
01:19:35,315 --> 01:19:36,612
I mean, we're lucky.

976
01:19:37,684 --> 01:19:39,879
It's a recessive thing.

977
01:19:44,022 --> 01:19:46,149
I tried to stay the course.

978
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:49,020
Three kids.

979
01:19:49,127 --> 01:19:50,560
You should have cut and run.

980
01:19:52,598 --> 01:19:54,828
But, you know, when you were born...

981
01:19:56,367 --> 01:19:58,267
and I held you -

982
01:20:00,071 --> 01:20:01,698
So tiny.

983
01:20:05,877 --> 01:20:09,540
The future seemed so... possible.

984
01:20:14,016 --> 01:20:15,483
No, please don't go.

985
01:20:17,019 --> 01:20:18,987
Just keep pretending...

986
01:20:19,088 --> 01:20:21,056
like before.

987
01:20:21,157 --> 01:20:24,217
If you pretend enough -

988
01:20:26,995 --> 01:20:28,895
Thanks for the gumdrops.

989
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:56,215
<i># He shall feed his flock #</i>

990
01:20:56,321 --> 01:21:01,486
<i># Like a shepherd #</i>

991
01:21:02,194 --> 01:21:07,632
<i># And he shall gather #</i>

992
01:21:07,731 --> 01:21:12,862
<i># The lambs with his arm #</i>

993
01:21:13,403 --> 01:21:18,238
<i># With his arm #</i>

994
01:21:23,512 --> 01:21:29,178
<i># And carry them #</i>

995
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:34,153
<i># In his bosom #</i>

996
01:21:34,255 --> 01:21:39,488
<i># And gently lead those #</i>

997
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:43,893
<i># That are with young #</i>

998
01:21:47,567 --> 01:21:50,468
- The computer died.
- Tech support.

999
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:53,060
Oh, and that was so beautiful.

1000
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,500
Although next time maybe you could learn
something a little more -

1001
01:21:57,610 --> 01:21:58,577
Jewish?

1002
01:21:58,677 --> 01:22:01,145
Don't you listen to him.
Mr. Sarcastic.

1003
01:22:01,246 --> 01:22:03,714
Mom, could I please have
a moment alone with Harvey...

1004
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:05,806
while Mark is fixing the computer?

1005
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:09,778
Well, yeah, sure.

1006
01:22:09,887 --> 01:22:11,354
Please follow me.

1007
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,361
Please sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

1008
01:22:25,468 --> 01:22:26,935
Thank you, Timmy.

1009
01:22:28,671 --> 01:22:30,935
Hmm. Nice place.

1010
01:22:36,076 --> 01:22:38,510
My mom says
you're planning to marry her.

1011
01:22:40,181 --> 01:22:42,081
Well, one step at a time.

1012
01:22:42,182 --> 01:22:44,047
We'll see how things go.

1013
01:22:45,152 --> 01:22:47,746
You mean my mom is wrong?

1014
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:49,845
You're not planning to marry her?

1015
01:22:51,425 --> 01:22:52,790
Timmy...

1016
01:22:54,694 --> 01:22:58,221
I love your mother very much.

1017
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,525
- So are you getting married?
- I hope so.

1018
01:23:00,632 --> 01:23:03,226
We both hope so.
A lot of that depends on you.

1019
01:23:04,569 --> 01:23:08,733
You know, while my brother is away at college,
I've been the man of the house.

1020
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,638
Oh, I know that. Your mother's told me.

1021
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:14,108
She's very proud of you.

1022
01:23:14,211 --> 01:23:18,545
If something doesn't meet my approval,
it's up to me to decide what to do.

1023
01:23:18,649 --> 01:23:20,412
Ooh.

1024
01:23:20,518 --> 01:23:22,611
That's a lot of responsibility.

1025
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,846
You know, I'm almost 13.

1026
01:23:24,954 --> 01:23:27,616
You don't have to talk to me
like I'm still a child.

1027
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:32,156
I'm sorry.

1028
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:40,001
I have some questions for you.

1029
01:23:40,902 --> 01:23:43,871
If you lie, I'll find out...

1030
01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:46,763
and I won't let you
go through with the marriage.

1031
01:23:47,675 --> 01:23:49,643
I won't lie to you, Timmy.

1032
01:23:49,744 --> 01:23:51,268
I'm an open and honest person.

1033
01:23:52,179 --> 01:23:54,579
Have you ever had sex with a man or boy?

1034
01:23:55,915 --> 01:23:56,882
No.

1035
01:23:56,982 --> 01:23:58,745
- Not a single time?
- No.

1036
01:23:58,851 --> 01:24:00,614
Not even in your dreams?

1037
01:24:00,721 --> 01:24:01,881
No.

1038
01:24:03,155 --> 01:24:04,179
Okay.

1039
01:24:05,057 --> 01:24:07,082
Do you think a pedophile
is a terrorist?

1040
01:24:07,192 --> 01:24:08,716
What -What?

1041
01:24:08,827 --> 01:24:10,294
Um, well, I mean -

1042
01:24:10,395 --> 01:24:12,659
If you ever met a pedophile,
what would you do?

1043
01:24:14,599 --> 01:24:16,658
Timmy, I would never-

1044
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,861
Y- You're touching me.

1045
01:24:18,969 --> 01:24:20,561
Timmy...

1046
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:22,332
I know where you're coming from.

1047
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:24,168
And I want you to know -

1048
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:26,468
Oh, my God.

1049
01:24:26,576 --> 01:24:29,101
Oh, you poor kid. Come here.

1050
01:25:17,722 --> 01:25:19,349
Joy.

1051
01:25:19,457 --> 01:25:21,220
Joy, it's been so long.

1052
01:25:21,325 --> 01:25:23,384
- Andy, no. No.
- Please don't forget me again,Joy.

1053
01:25:23,494 --> 01:25:25,655
- I have no one else.
- No!

1054
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:50,382
You're the only one
who hasn't forgotten me.

1055
01:25:57,291 --> 01:25:58,918
Allen.

1056
01:25:59,026 --> 01:26:00,584
Oh.

1057
01:26:00,694 --> 01:26:02,321
But you cut and ran.

1058
01:26:02,428 --> 01:26:07,195
Oh, I know I should never have left you.
Never.

1059
01:26:07,301 --> 01:26:09,667
- Please forgive me.
- Too late.

1060
01:26:09,769 --> 01:26:13,933
Oh, but, sweetheart,
isn't there anything that I can do?

1061
01:26:14,039 --> 01:26:15,267
Anything.

1062
01:26:15,373 --> 01:26:18,001
Anything to - to -

1063
01:26:22,514 --> 01:26:24,414
Two things.

1064
01:26:24,516 --> 01:26:25,949
What?

1065
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:27,984
What? Tell me.

1066
01:26:28,085 --> 01:26:30,918
Delete everything off my computer.

1067
01:26:31,889 --> 01:26:34,881
All the Web sites and subscriptions.

1068
01:26:34,992 --> 01:26:36,960
Oh. Okay.

1069
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:39,392
What else?

1070
01:26:43,232 --> 01:26:46,565
Do what I did -
put a bullet through your temple.

1071
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,664
Gun in mouth is also okay.

1072
01:26:52,274 --> 01:26:55,266
And then write a note saying...

1073
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,241
"I am a terrible person.

1074
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:00,912
I tried to improve the world, but failed.

1075
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:05,252
War is evil, but what I did was worse. "

1076
01:27:06,019 --> 01:27:11,150
I will never rest until I see that you know
what it is to suffer like I did.

1077
01:27:12,591 --> 01:27:14,058
Oh, Allen, I -

1078
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:16,754
I don't know, Allen.

1079
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:21,595
I really think I'd prefer taking pills.

1080
01:27:24,269 --> 01:27:26,760
Then remember to mix them
with alcohol.

1081
01:27:28,006 --> 01:27:31,134
And to tie a plastic bag
around your head afterwards.

1082
01:27:31,242 --> 01:27:34,109
What -What if I end up a vegetable?

1083
01:27:34,211 --> 01:27:37,078
- You won't.
- But I don't want to die.

1084
01:27:38,715 --> 01:27:40,842
You die for me...

1085
01:27:41,952 --> 01:27:44,580
and I will know you loved me.

1086
01:27:54,463 --> 01:27:56,556
Shh.

1087
01:27:58,967 --> 01:28:00,434
Allen...

1088
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:04,638
did you meet any angels?

1089
01:28:08,275 --> 01:28:09,435
Yeah.

1090
01:28:11,312 --> 01:28:12,779
I mean, sure.

1091
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,608
Lots of really nice, friendly people.

1092
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:21,552
Do they think this is
the right thing to do?

1093
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,454
An eye for an eye?

1094
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:30,794
Then comes forgiveness.

1095
01:29:04,693 --> 01:29:06,593
Where is Timmy?

1096
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:34,109
I'll be back in five.

1097
01:29:44,395 --> 01:29:45,384
Hi.

1098
01:29:46,530 --> 01:29:47,497
Hey.

1099
01:29:47,598 --> 01:29:50,032
Congratulations on becoming a man.

1100
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:53,526
Thanks.

1101
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:55,867
I heard your dad was leaving.

1102
01:29:55,972 --> 01:29:56,961
Yep.

1103
01:29:57,073 --> 01:29:58,836
Your mom tell you?

1104
01:29:59,976 --> 01:30:01,273
Yeah.

1105
01:30:01,944 --> 01:30:03,411
Where is he moving to?

1106
01:30:03,512 --> 01:30:04,479
Israel.

1107
01:30:04,579 --> 01:30:06,479
But why?

1108
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:08,913
Isn't it dangerous there?

1109
01:30:09,016 --> 01:30:11,678
What makes you think there won't be
a terrorist attack here?

1110
01:30:12,888 --> 01:30:15,686
I mean, if I were Al-Qaeda,
this part of Florida is a gold mine.

1111
01:30:18,092 --> 01:30:21,493
Anyway, I don't think he's too focused
on survival these days.

1112
01:30:23,997 --> 01:30:26,158
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

1113
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,993
I mean,
even if your dad is a pedophile...

1114
01:30:31,104 --> 01:30:32,594
he should be allowed to get married.

1115
01:30:32,705 --> 01:30:34,195
He's not a pedophile.

1116
01:30:34,306 --> 01:30:36,604
- Yeah, but even if he is.
- He's not.

1117
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,677
I know.

1118
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:43,910
I'm sorry.

1119
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:48,180
Forget about it. It's over.

1120
01:30:50,587 --> 01:30:52,111
What if I -

1121
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,426
My father visited my brother
up at college a few weeks ago.

1122
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:07,227
They hung out for a little while,
and then... he left.

1123
01:31:09,371 --> 01:31:11,066
Disappeared.

1124
01:31:11,873 --> 01:31:13,636
Nobody knows where.

1125
01:31:16,478 --> 01:31:20,209
My mom thinks he's probably
lying somewhere dead in a gutter.

1126
01:31:21,316 --> 01:31:23,546
And for real this time.

1127
01:31:23,650 --> 01:31:25,550
But...

1128
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:27,552
he wasn't a pedophile either.

1129
01:31:27,654 --> 01:31:30,714
<i>He wasn't.</i>

1130
01:31:31,657 --> 01:31:33,147
He wasn't.

1131
01:31:35,795 --> 01:31:38,525
I'm sorry I freaked out before.

1132
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:43,799
It was before my bar mitzvah.

1133
01:31:44,669 --> 01:31:46,500
I was still just -

1134
01:31:49,007 --> 01:31:50,634
I was -

1135
01:31:55,045 --> 01:31:56,569
Please.

1136
01:32:00,116 --> 01:32:01,583
Sure.

1137
01:32:02,352 --> 01:32:04,047
Forgive and forget.

1138
01:32:05,021 --> 01:32:07,421
But it's like freedom and democracy.

1139
01:32:08,124 --> 01:32:12,254
In the end, China will take over,
and none of this will matter.

1140
01:32:14,029 --> 01:32:16,896
I don't care
about freedom and democracy.

1141
01:32:21,302 --> 01:32:23,429
I just want my father.

1142
