00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:28,257
What am I supposed to do? Kill him?

542
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:31,989
People die for less.

543
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:36,260
At weddings, sometimes.
Things get out of hand.

544
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:39,099
You don't know what will happen.

545
00:39:40,395 --> 00:39:42,500
I would've killed him.

546
00:39:42,831 --> 00:39:45,607
I was so mad.

547
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:48,337
I was outraged.

548
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:56,753
Tore up the rosebush.

549
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:03,522
We could plant it.

550
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,462
It will grow.

551
00:40:11,493 --> 00:40:13,530
We took care of your car.

552
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:15,705
Thanks.

553
00:40:15,864 --> 00:40:18,242
Ned said to come tell you.

554
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,843
Noted.

555
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:22,039
And see if you want anything else.

556
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,046
I'm all set.

557
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,875
Any old thing.

558
00:40:33,148 --> 00:40:34,252
Oh.

559
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:36,389
Oh.

560
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:39,657
What kind of place is this?

561
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:42,666
It's Nedland.

562
00:40:43,892 --> 00:40:45,394
You wanna get laid?

563
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:47,904
I'm all hyper.

564
00:40:49,564 --> 00:40:52,204
You don't have to. Ned isn't anything.

565
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,408
- He's my boss.
- Where?

566
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,750
The Rent-A-Car. Mind if I smoke?

567
00:40:57,906 --> 00:40:59,783
No, go ahead.

568
00:41:14,856 --> 00:41:17,803
What would you do
if you had to find someone?

569
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:25,435
Hm. First, analyze the information.

570
00:41:26,001 --> 00:41:28,072
Name is Pierre.

571
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:31,447
He's deceptively simple-looking.

572
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:34,743
Lives up north.

573
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,256
Has a girlfriend who likes roses.

574
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,928
Not much to analyze.

575
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:46,263
However, there ain't
a ton of Pierres around here.

576
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,132
I'm finding him.

577
00:41:50,125 --> 00:41:52,127
That will happen.

578
00:41:52,594 --> 00:41:56,064
- Well, I'll sleep on it.
- Stay a minute.

579
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,436
Yeah, why?

580
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,648
I want you to sit on my back.

581
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:07,348
Is that a sexual thing for you?

582
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:09,355
No.

583
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:13,253
I think I hurt it when I ran
my truck off the road.

584
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,391
Okay.

585
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:41,085
(SIGHS)

586
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:44,286
(♪♪♪)

587
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:50,323
- This is a very good seat.
- Much better.

588
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,328
(♪♪♪)

589
00:42:58,259 --> 00:43:01,001
PIERRE: Can you hear the lake from here?

590
00:43:02,097 --> 00:43:04,099
STELLA: Sometimes.

591
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,501
Do you hear it?

592
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:11,915
PIERRE: I don't know.

593
00:43:17,212 --> 00:43:19,954
STELLA: Can you hear what I'm thinking?

594
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:24,560
You don't want the night to end.

595
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,302
STELLA: What else?

596
00:43:40,969 --> 00:43:43,313
Too many things.

597
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,711
What do you do for Ned?

598
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:53,052
SHANE: Various things.

599
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,586
Last job, I burned a house down.

600
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,489
Insurance bid?

601
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:02,100
No, it was some couple who got divorced.

602
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:05,397
She got the vacation house. He was bitter.

603
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,007
Mm-hm. Tale often told.

604
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:12,342
It was supposed to be empty...

605
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,278
but...

606
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,111
it turns out...

607
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:21,511
there was somebody there.

608
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:24,614
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

609
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,392
And what do you do for Ned?

610
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:31,190
Nothing.

611
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,965
I just bump people up.

612
00:44:34,122 --> 00:44:35,863
What's that?

613
00:44:38,393 --> 00:44:40,964
They come in, they want the economy car...

614
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:43,905
and I...

615
00:44:46,568 --> 00:44:48,275
And so, what happened?

616
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,143
To the person in the house.

617
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:52,148
She died.

618
00:44:52,307 --> 00:44:54,150
Jesus.

619
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:57,887
Haunts me to this day.

620
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:03,527
It was not supposed to be that way.

621
00:45:09,157 --> 00:45:10,830
What were you saying?

622
00:45:11,025 --> 00:45:12,095
"They come in..."

623
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,534
I just...

624
00:45:14,662 --> 00:45:18,439
bump them up to something
more expensive than they want.

625
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,977
Different car.

626
00:45:23,037 --> 00:45:25,039
How do you do that?

627
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,747
It's easy.

628
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:30,981
I just talk low and slow...

629
00:45:31,146 --> 00:45:35,822
and wear a gold necklace
with my shirt open a button too many.

630
00:45:37,786 --> 00:45:39,288
And then what?

631
00:45:39,454 --> 00:45:41,127
That's it.

632
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:45,064
Just in the appearance?

633
00:45:45,827 --> 00:45:47,306
Yeah.

634
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,976
Most people in the industry know that.

635
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:55,205
I think most people kind of
wanna be bumped up anyway.

636
00:46:03,378 --> 00:46:05,221
STELLA: Do you know when it will be?

637
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,883
Depends on how smart he is.

638
00:46:10,718 --> 00:46:11,890
What do you know?

639
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:15,659
Everything that needs
to happen is gonna happen.

640
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,031
I wanna do it.

641
00:46:18,493 --> 00:46:19,904
Well, you can't.

642
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:23,739
I'm strong now. I'm feeling great.

643
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:25,707
I don't mean you're not strong.

644
00:46:30,905 --> 00:46:33,579
- I mean, why shouldn't the kid do it?
- He doesn't know.

645
00:46:33,741 --> 00:46:35,345
It isn't fair.

646
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:37,547
Fair to who?

647
00:46:38,413 --> 00:46:40,017
He could get hurt.

648
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,154
Well, I suppose you could tell him.

649
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,330
I want to tell him.

650
00:46:45,854 --> 00:46:47,026
He won't believe you.

651
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:49,396
He would.

652
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,730
I feel he would, from me.

653
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,096
It would still happen.

654
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:55,366
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

655
00:46:58,633 --> 00:47:00,909
Hi, is this bad timing?

656
00:47:01,536 --> 00:47:02,776
What can I do for you?

657
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:06,185
Well, it's a little awkward. Heh, heh.

658
00:47:06,341 --> 00:47:09,788
Maybe I shouldn't have come,
but, um, I'm Carrie Sloan.

659
00:47:09,944 --> 00:47:12,584
- I'm a friend of Pierre's.
- Oh.

660
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:14,757
You're Carrie.

661
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:16,789
He speaks highly of you.

662
00:47:17,452 --> 00:47:21,457
Oh, wow, that's nice. Well, you
don't have anything to worry about.

663
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:24,193
You know, him and I
are like brother and sister.

664
00:47:24,359 --> 00:47:27,431
When his parents died,
he didn't really have anyone...

665
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:31,099
so I kind of took him under my wing.

666
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,543
Or he took me under his wing, you know?

667
00:47:34,736 --> 00:47:36,477
There was... There was wings involved.

668
00:47:37,472 --> 00:47:38,746
That was kind of you.

669
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:46,183
I know that, you know,
you're very special to him.

670
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,686
You are. Did you know that?

671
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:54,495
And I just wanted to say because,
you know, I've been hurt before...

672
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:57,795
but I'm not gonna bore you with that.
I just...

673
00:47:58,326 --> 00:48:01,796
I really don't want that for Pierre.

674
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,574
No.

675
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,607
I understand.

676
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:09,108
Okay.

677
00:48:12,941 --> 00:48:15,581
(♪♪♪)

678
00:48:20,248 --> 00:48:22,091
TIM: Are you all right?

679
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,262
STELLA: What are we doing to Pierre?

680
00:48:31,592 --> 00:48:34,095
You saved his life, Stella. You know that.

681
00:48:34,262 --> 00:48:37,607
All this has been extra time for him.

682
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:40,871
Christ, there'd be grass growing
on his grave right now...

683
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,878
if it wasn't for you.

684
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,315
- Don't say that.
- I'm sorry. It's true.

685
00:48:46,474 --> 00:48:48,283
I thought this was what you wanted.

686
00:48:48,443 --> 00:48:50,013
I did too...

687
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:52,021
but I don't know.

688
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:56,194
Well, if you talk to him,
and I see that you will...

689
00:48:56,351 --> 00:48:58,388
there's a place for it.

690
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:00,794
Where?

691
00:49:00,955 --> 00:49:02,798
It's an orchard.

692
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:09,400
PIERRE: Hey, uh, reverend.

693
00:49:09,831 --> 00:49:11,071
You need anything else?

694
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:16,575
You know that little green convertible
your dad used to drive?

695
00:49:18,973 --> 00:49:20,816
The MG.

696
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:23,182
Sure.

697
00:49:24,512 --> 00:49:27,083
It went in the house auction.

698
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,487
Dad wasn't very good with money.

699
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:34,292
I think I saw it the other day. It was
up for sale where they work on my car.

700
00:49:34,655 --> 00:49:36,362
Yeah.

701
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:42,837
You know, he rebuilt it himself.

702
00:49:44,098 --> 00:49:46,874
The man knew stuff about cars.

703
00:49:49,437 --> 00:49:50,814
Come outside.

704
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:56,120
Are you serious, John?

705
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,017
What did you give for it?

706
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:01,285
Not much. I baptized the guy's kids...

707
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:04,123
so he cut me a deal.

708
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,864
What are we, uh, looking at?

709
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:12,565
This is my dad's car.

710
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:15,637
Well, it was.

711
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:18,700
It's yours.

712
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:22,143
Oh, man. You can't do that.

713
00:50:22,336 --> 00:50:24,441
JOHN: It should stay in the family.

714
00:50:34,715 --> 00:50:38,458
(♪♪♪)

715
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,807
PIERRE: Hey, Keith.

716
00:50:55,603 --> 00:50:58,743
You ever have anyone after you?

717
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:02,743
After me?

718
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:07,189
That wanted to hurt you.

719
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,433
One time. Yeah.

720
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,697
There was this friend of mine...

721
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:20,031
we were in a bar in La Crosse.

722
00:51:20,695 --> 00:51:24,700
Somebody was giving him
a hard time about something and...

1251
01:29:39,825 --> 01:29:43,204
The only things that might last
are the things that make no difference.

1252
01:29:45,497 --> 01:29:46,942
But I'm not sure I agree.

1253
01:29:47,499 --> 01:29:52,448
If the stars go out and the universe
collapses in on itself...

1254
01:29:52,604 --> 01:29:55,448
won't it all begin again?

1255
01:30:00,212 --> 01:30:01,782
STELLA: I didn't mean to wake you.

1256
01:30:10,289 --> 01:30:11,495
What time is it?

1257
01:30:12,524 --> 01:30:15,027
Mm. Not late.

1258
01:30:16,862 --> 01:30:19,741
I'm walking into town
if you're going that way.

1259
01:30:22,634 --> 01:30:25,046
I laid down in the grass.

1260
01:30:25,237 --> 01:30:27,547
That's the last thing I remember.

1261
01:30:28,307 --> 01:30:30,378
Well, it's a beautiful day.

1262
01:30:30,542 --> 01:30:32,954
It's supposed to stay that way
for a while.

1263
01:30:33,545 --> 01:30:35,252
Yeah.

1264
01:30:37,449 --> 01:30:39,156
PIERRE: What brings you here?

1265
01:30:39,318 --> 01:30:41,457
STELLA: That's a good question.

1266
01:30:42,654 --> 01:30:44,497
But we have time.
