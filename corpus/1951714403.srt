00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:29,755
DUG UP

3
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:25,655
Then

4
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,090
...te interesas por tus perros.

5
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,866
They are of my neighbours.

6
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,433
Which good neighbour you are

7
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,672
Take care the two
Dogs per three weeks.

8
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,241
Yes, join stop more in
Arizona and they come back later.

9
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:47,244
Thanks.

10
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:51,090
You do not have which to worry, of
I did not charge you the coffee.

11
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,552
Thanks.

12
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,390
- ¿Te veré al regreso?
- Sí.

13
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,811
That did not want to imagine why
Of what you are awake at these hours.

14
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,608
By himself I was doing something, he is everything.

15
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,016
You should already rest.

16
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,918
I thought that the relation was
Come to take care you.

17
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,423
Something I seized, but you should
Take care of yourself.

18
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,332
Much as you take care of me.

19
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,568
You know that I have two generators.

20
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,469
I did not want to make a lot of noise

21
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,136
I did not want to wake up you.

22
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,467
What do you have there?

23
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,669
Ho, this

24
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,810
...es una carta de la reserva.

25
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,639
I establish it.

26
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,219
There is not anything.

27
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,211
The

28
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,259
...el abastecedor no pasó anoche.

29
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,217
I am not sure about why not wine.

30
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,425
Gentleman, my name is hank.

31
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,325
By myself I am of passing.

32
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,061
The tranquero about which they talk probably
One am that I saw to 25 miles of here

33
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,998
It seems that he exploded.

34
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,764
It seems that they have a problem.

35
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,073
I will call the Sheriff.

36
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,270
Yes, the tranquero is
Blocking all the road.

37
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,376
Is there some other exit?

38
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,377
The only exit is the 15.

39
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,120
The 15 is to 150 miles
Of the next village.

40
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,987
I do not know other in fact.

41
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,919
This is a classic who I have here
There is not way of which I make 150 miles

42
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,187
...y no me queda gasolina.

43
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:25,486
Look

44
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,887
...soy de la ciudad, ¿no es así?

45
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,400
This is not the city, I need help.

46
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,332
I smell to horse shit and
That seems to be a lot of ago time

47
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,233
...que no ves todo este dinero junto.

48
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,903
Sell me a horse or any
Thing with which can go out of here.

49
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,321
Annie?

50
00:09:58,965 --> 00:09:59,522
Him.

51
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:02,424
I am here.

52
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,763
I have just received one
The police's call

53
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,537
It seems that they found a truck
Smashed in the road.

54
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,437
But how?

55
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,679
What time is it?

56
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,277
They are the 6:48 to. m.

57
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,253
Do not scare me.

58
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,759
They are sure ¿ hey?

59
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,101
- Sí.
- De acuerdo.

60
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,871
I will dress and I am ready immediately.

61
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:41,896
Is it every well one?

62
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,170
I am well.

63
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,669
Himself that 6:48 is very early.

64
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,772
If you want, myself check.

65
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,414
Graces, but

66
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,178
...sigo siendo el Sheriff, ¿recuerdas?

67
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,082
I finish this week anyway.

68
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:00,720
Okay.

69
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,854
I see you over there.

70
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:04,056
I see you then.

71
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,037
Ho, peaceful.

72
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,841
Are not frightened, I am I, I will not do you damage.

73
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,775
A second more and you shot.

74
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,448
I suppose that handling one sets up
It is not an easy thing to do.

75
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,389
I did not want to shoot you.

76
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,154
I will shoot you if you follow me
Calling so early.

77
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,413
Which devils is that?

78
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,050
I am not sure.

79
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,861
Me I ask he does round here.

80
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,940
I do not have the smallest idea.

81
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,294
That was fast.

82
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:00,295
Yes, it is important

83
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,305
...no le has contado a nadie...

84
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,342
...para que vayan a echar un vistazo.

85
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,301
Of course that not.

86
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:10,939
What do you have?

87
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,937
Do you say that I was in the truck?

88
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,431
I believe that I grew in the tranquero.

89
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:38,933
I believe that what I had been already went out.

90
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,546
Him, what I had been.

91
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,539
I never saw anything alike.

92
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,843
I hoped you to say to me
Slightly more specific.

93
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,847
By myself I can say you that

94
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,689
...le haré algunas
You try to see what happens.

95
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,352
Thanks.

96
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,995
A lot of hopes are not made.

97
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,094
By myself I will be able to accumulate
Basic information about her

98
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,791
...especie que has traído.

99
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,735
That is a beginning.

100
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,897
He hears

101
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:11,639
What him did it happen to the driver?

102
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,710
We do not meet any.

103
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:45,667
Hello, Annie.

104
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,540
Is it every well one?

105
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,542
Why?

106
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,244
I can give bill to me of when
He happens to my granddaughter slightly.

107
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,749
Ho, yes, I am

108
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,792
...pensando, nada en realidad.

109
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,593
¿ You have some idea of when
The electricity will recover?

110
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,794
I am remaining without
Diesel in my generators.

111
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:12,599
Him I am not going to do.

112
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,209
Why me do not you hate?

113
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,442
You seem never annoyed.

114
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,712
Do what I do.

115
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:28,847
I want to say

116
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,818
...lo entendería si lo hicieras.

117
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:35,925
You have been round here long time

118
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,327
Almost all your life you have been brave.

119
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,230
So I believe that someone has
That endure the things.

120
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,531
Until where I know we have not become us anything.

121
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:52,369
Manager, is he there?

122
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,140
Him.

123
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,482
That seems horn to Rob him
They did something the other night

124
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,183
He wants to talk with you.

125
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,087
Perfecto.

126
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,925
Thanks.

127
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:16,985
There.

128
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:17,986
There he is.

129
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,991
He must have been a wolf or something.

130
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,122
If.

131
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,689
I have used here, Annie.

132
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,801
I want 2 thousand, including
To this cow from here.

133
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,105
That is not going to pass Rob, you know it.

134
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:34,409
They will not give you thousand by this
Head, you have already lost this cow.

135
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,802
That is a shit, Annie.

136
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,310
I understand you, Rob, but you are
Annoyed with the wrong person.

137
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,915
That one is law.

138
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,119
He hears, Kevin, sees to see the tanks
Make sure you of which they are full.

139
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,322
Yes, gentleman horn.

00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,020
The electricity company
He is going to arrange my backside.

141
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,928
We have been very good with you, Annie.

142
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,527
Move away from law that you represent

143
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,900
For last year.

144
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,101
I think that best me seen
Like you and him myself do.

145
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,177
This work is tremendous
Opportunity for someone of your rank.

146
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,215
It is better than you understand
That you work for us.

147
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,278
You must take care by all them
Of here, that one it is your work.

148
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,012
Please

149

That remembers the meeting of that
Village is the next week.

151
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,192
But I know that you are as drunk
That you do not know what I say.

152
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,393
Thanks for giving me a lot of credit

153
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,600
He means a lot, coming of you.

154
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,640
I am going to kill you.

155
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,614

Bring closer you

166

Park there.

167
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,652
It seems that it is an engine problem.

168
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:36,457

You will not be mechanic.

171
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,320
Do not worry not me
I can go to no place.

172
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,414

00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,556
Do you take some place where let this?

174
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,492
Put it on the corner.

00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,165
What must the gas? Does he come quick?

176
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,063

00:22:59,111 --> 00:22:59,668
Grandfather.

178

I need to deliver that suitcase in
Albuquerque yesterday ¿, of agreement?

179
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:16,525
You are comfortable over there behind.

180
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:17,758
I have been worse.

181
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,866
Hello friend.

182
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,263
I hope them not to need gas.

183
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,367
What does he want to say?

184
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,341
He means that they are caught.

185
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,838
They are going to have to pass the night here.

186
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,084
Welcome to the party.

187
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,356
Are not why all this has happened today.

188
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,757
Him.

189
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,559
Hello, Sheriff.

190
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:00,638
Hello Carla.

191
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:05,335
Our livestock can not be that
Them eat those doomed wolves.

192
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,344
Someone must begin to do something.

193
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:08,835
How does that go?

194
00:24:09,414 --> 00:24:10,005
He goes.

195
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:14,943
A good beginning would be that who us
I represented not a drunkard out

196
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,521
Do not pay attention to those silly ones.

197
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,348
You know that you are good for this.

198
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,058
That cow is the comment
Of all the village.

199
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,529
Yes, that seems.

200
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:32,335
¿ Why are going out to
Shine Indian children today?

201
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,339
Flour, you do not do me
Ask to go.

202
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,834
Horn Rob looking for the Sheriff, I change.

203
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:41,839
Someone is here, do not worry.

204
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:43,542
You are going to answer?

205
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:45,345
I do not have option.

206
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:46,774
The I have Bob.

207
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,896
Hear, Sheriff.

208
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:06,392
Yes, Curtis.

209
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,394
Do you come to the village meeting?

210
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:11,104
Him.

211
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,338
I will be there

212
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,216
Carla hears.

213
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,256
That tells her
Next week ¿, truth?

214
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:30,752
Him.

215
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:34,330
I seized that, I go on being the Sheriff ¿, not?

216
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:36,927
Him.

217
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,730
Tell him that I can still arrest
People ¿, of agreement?

218
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:42,933
One him can say.

219
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,940
I do not know why you are confident of her.

220
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,650
Because she is a decent person.

221
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:56,945
Do you know what, Carla?

222
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,886
I doubt that that girl is of
Agreement between you in what you say.

223
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,806
Hello ¿, I can help her?

224
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:23,204
Him.

225
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:24,941
Nodin is somewhere.

226
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:25,741
Who is there?

227
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,550
Finally a police.

228
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,544
Then ¿, when they will open
Again the road?

229
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,351
I wanted them to do it
But it will be a time so.

230
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:39,219
Ho; him; Nodin; it is neatening.

231
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,525
Pass.

232
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:42,228
Thanks.

233
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,309
Annie ¿, you believe that me
You can add a hand?

234
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:02,682
Yes, insurance.

235
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:03,983
What do you need?

236
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,791
I will put my hands here and you do it
Same and we move it to that table of over there.

237
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:09,819
Okay.

238
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,095
Thanks.

239
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,499
Not he is why.

240
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,196
I did not know

241
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:22,903
...que sabías hacer vasijas.

242
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,338
I wait that not for them
You see alone as vessels.

243
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:34,713
Creating recipients is one
Connection with his sounds

244
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,849
All what surrounds us.

245
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:38,811
It is a people present

246
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,627
Look at him as velar by her
Fellow safety.

247
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,320
Which kind of films do you like any them more?

248
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,321
That of Russell Crowe.

249
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,657
Rusell, hard kind.

250
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,427
- ¿Eres como Rusell?
- Soy rudo.

251
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:54,733
Are it?

252
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:59,999
RiPPED BY
~Fl3mA~
SEPTiCEMiA TEAM

253
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:01,374
You take the clay

254
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:03,473
You work it

255
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,375
You develop it

256
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,685
Her clean, you remove him
Any impurity

257
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,889
...y obtienes lo que necesitas...

258
00:28:14,592 --> 00:28:15,786
...apretarla en la mano...

259
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,231
...te llevará a pensar
In slightly cute and useful.

260
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,539
Somewhere there is an ugly one
Disorder that brings closer one.

261
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,808
I can not make you think in
Nothing that reminds you something beautiful one.

262
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,147
It happens.

263
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,010
There is something that I want you to see.

264
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,422
- ¿Qué crees del abuelo?
- Que el tiempo pasa.

265
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,495
It seems that there are samples of the 5 kingdoms.

266
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,103
Fungi, protests

267
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,207
Bacteria, plants

268
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,078
...y por supuesto, animal.

269
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:18,817
This substance is to know that
ADN and be able to delimit the kingdom.

270
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,707
He adds a look.

271
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,614
There is a coloration
Different for each kingdom.

272
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,814
As you can see he changes color.

273
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,720
So they are animal, and what?

274
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,118
Then

275
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,760
I have done him tests
Three times to this thing.

276
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,121
And nothing there is not opening.

277
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:03,823
Nothing.

278
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:08,033
It is what he has me thought that he is

279
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,729
...una forma anormal de vida.

280
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,340
Which devils do you say?

281
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,045
I say that it is thing he is

282
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:18,749
...un organismo no
Indentified or artificial.

283
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:30,957
Flour?

284
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,463
Curtis?

285
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,068
If they need one he winnowed, I can

286
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,269
This is not good, Kale.

287
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,640
I was right, we were right.

288
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,050
They did not make it by that.

289
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:43,846
Are you well?

290
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,352
Yes, we should go us.

291
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,083
Go?

292
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,557
Or she must face his future.

293
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:52,494
If you do not do it

294
00:33:58,269 --> 00:33:59,167
...yo lo haré.

295
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,120
What is this?

296
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:21,515
I am not sure

297
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,353
But he looks at what happens
When I throw him this.

298
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:36,463
This sample indicates that there is ADN of each
One of the five kingdoms, in those cameras.

299
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,840
ADN, how an animal can

300
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:40,536
But as I say to you

301
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:44,646
I can be wrong, really you must
Take this thing to an appropriate laboratory.

302
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:46,543
I am of my countryside long away.

303
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,646
I study the plant ADN.

304
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,351
That is alone

305
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:53,387
...no tiene sentido.

306
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,156
The examination is very reliable.

307
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:00,195
It is strange.

308
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,426
Really I believe that
I will handle by a lot of time.

309
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:45,837
What happens?

310
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,543
I thought that you were a coyote.

311
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,372
Which bundles sniffing in the garbage?

312
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,251
I suppose that you must be inside.

313
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,817
I believe that by myself I will be going to go to bed.

314
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:04,819
Good night.

315
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,897
Good night.

316
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:41,621
Ho, you go in serious

317
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,240
- ¿Quién te crees que eres?
- No lo sé, quien tengo que ser.

318
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:09,117
Take cared there.

319
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:10,584
Sight behind you.

320
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:11,720
In the other side.

321
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,121
Kill him, in that side.

322
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,504
What happens?

323
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,137
He lights the lights.

324
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,039
Behind.

325
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:05,914
Shoot.

326
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,522
To where was he?

327
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,510
Curse.

328
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:50,523
The weapon does not serve.

329
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:53,657
Grandfather.

330
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,729
Go of here.

331
00:38:59,136 --> 00:38:59,761
Go.

332
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:09,968
Go, we go, we go.

333
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,282
Take his auto.

334
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,797
Behind.

335
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,234
Behind!

336
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,916
We go.

337
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,049
Involve you there.

338
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,244
I have it.

339
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,263
We go, we go, we go.

340
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:47,509
He takes the road, we go.

341
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:23,337
Shit.

342
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:42,395
Is that everything?

343
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:43,692
Will we follow or what?

344
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,064
Jódete, man.

345
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,068
Not do not, do it.

346
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:49,897
We will be well.

347
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,304
We are him enough
He encloses to walk.

348
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:55,801
Where will we go to?

349
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,706
Which devils was that thing?

350
00:41:59,083 --> 00:41:59,879
What happens?

351
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,211
I do not know that he happens, okay?
I do not know that I was that thing.

352
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,218
I do not know where we will go.

353
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,014
The best would be that you kept quiet.

354
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,827
We are going to move us now.

355
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:36,481
Where will we go to?

356
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,347
There is a kind here up the street
My group who will help us.

357
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,959
Gentleman horn also are annoyed.

358
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,765
I give him my word of which
We will arrive at the bottom of this.

359
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,270
I wait that your word not
Are like your manager, son.

360
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:04,305
I hope you to be considering converting you
In Sheriff now who Annie will stop it being.

361
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:07,047
I appreciate his support, but

362
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,352
...a esta altura, pienso que soy
Luky of having to Annie I eat Sheriff.

363
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,549
I feel listen to that that one is your opinion.

364
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,924
Remain here.

365
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,138
Ho, my God.

366
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,076
I thought that the boys would help us.

367
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,583
That is not as easy.

368
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:16,205
Where are we?

369
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,639
We arrive far.

370
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,409
The grandfather?

371
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,715
Yet not this.

372
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,330
Kale this here?

373
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,635
Unless east there inside.

374
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,280
It is necessary to have careful, a lot of care.

375
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,957
- ¿Ves eso?
- ¿Qué?

376
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,132
One old burial camera.

377
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:04,109
Nodin they see with me
The other ones remain one there.

378
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,535
We already know that towards Kale here down.

379
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,942
That was what I kill my grandfather.

380
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,321
Which devils did here down?

381
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,820
Who knows.

382
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,301
Taenia reason, was here.

383
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:11,377
Here he went where they buried it
He does as 900 years behind.

384
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,081
They said that they had vanished.

385
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,386
Toned down?

386
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:22,283
If, some believed
That was by the drought.

387
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:40,203
This, sample that there was life.

388
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:43,743
And here we have

389
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,613
...lo que parece ser esto.

390
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,344
What is that?

391
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:54,888
Kale?

392
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,324
Care.

393
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,425
If your friends cooperate I will let live them.

394
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,924
Taenia reason, these crazy.

395
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,763
- Mi abuelo murió...
- El quería saber la verdad.

396
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:06,834
Which truth?

397
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,870
Who comes by hiding all a race
Of people who lived in the earth base.

398
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,373
That is difficult he stops
You but everything is like that.

399
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,944
Stop you, we go now.

400
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:28,146
Read it.

401
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,254
That says key about the sky.

402
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:35,691
Ho God they venerated him until they died.

403
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:41,468
Thereby that believed myself
Also I was crazy.

404
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:44,765
They removed me the money
When taenia reason.

405
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,609
- Te diré algo.
- ¿Qué?

406
00:50:50,514 --> 00:50:52,880
Annie felt one similar one
In the impact place.

407
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:57,280
When I opened it I was
A lot of small cameras

408
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,715
...que contenían todo tipo de
ADN of that area that surrounded it.

409
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:03,415
Extinct plants that you were per centuries.

410
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:06,721
This is not a God, he is
An advanced civilization.

411
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:09,625
That sent it here
To harvest the ADN.

412
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:16,029
The foreigner is that I let a chunk

413
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:21,036
...por un tiempo y
I change moment then.

414
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,977
I eat if I were a safety mechanism.

415
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:27,673
He ends with the truck almost.

416
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:33,851
Who want him to do, him
I wanted us to stop it.

417
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,652
- Y ahora esta de vuelta.
- Nunca murió,

418
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:43,062
...el veneno lo pone en
A hung animation.

419
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:47,565
The creature's skin
He develops a kind of protein.

420
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,901
I could protect your sister.

421
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,973
Per 900 years.

422
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,109
What do they talk about?

423
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:01,510
Your grandfather in his translations
I said that there was a chunk

424
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:06,412
...de eso y como hacer el veneno.

425
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,761
I am still deciphering the process.

426
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,454
I need the work for that you finish.

427
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,825
I understand that in your mind

428
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:23,935
...matar esto es algo como tu destino.

429
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:27,643
But I have a responsibility
And they are this people.

430
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:31,347
Give me the your van keys

431
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,940
...para poder sacarlos de aquí.

432
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,048
Not.

433
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,415
Raise you.

434
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,329
Give me the cart keys.

435
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:35,766
- ¿Ah si?
- Ahora.

436
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:45,344
I have all under

437
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,544
hey, the keys are
Behind the rock.

438
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:53,648
Satisfied, fondness?

439
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,156
I think I see something.

440
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,494
What is that?

441
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:21,712
Shit.

442
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:44,339
- No, no, no.
- Quítate del medio.

443
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:46,033
Let me kill the whore son.

444
00:55:46,242 --> 00:55:49,643
- Por el arma en el piso.
- Vamos es lo que necesitamos.

445
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,847
What does that to say want?

446
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:54,975
Same that.

447
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,684
Put her on the apartment.

448
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,002
Ok, let me put her on the apartment.

449
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,355
Move away you.

450
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,327
Remove it to me of my.

451
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,430
Calm her, calm her.

452
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,661
This well one.

453
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,538
Her beak joins sleigh bell he drinks
This needs each 2 hours.

454
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,611
What happens?

455
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,687
That you will have to finish seems
Your grandfather's work.

456
00:57:17,801 --> 00:57:21,237
¿ Why you do not move it to see if
We get the damn blood out hence.

457
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:23,094
Those fluids?

458
00:57:23,306 --> 00:57:25,797
That I found is the only
Putting off this give birth of here.

459
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:32,647
That? These worried do I imagine me?

460
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:38,218
It is like a poison than he kills to the aliens.

461
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,358
Ok Kale, you already got what you wanted.

462
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:57,163
¿ Why you do not help me
To get them out from here?

463
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,575
I did not, tell you that I would not get out us of here.

464
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,483
But he needs to see to one I medicate.

465
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,184
To the devil with this.

466
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:21,320
Her will take the van and me myself
I will take as far as I can.

467
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:23,190
Shit.

468
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,698
Do not approach to my van.

469
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,907
Complained obsessive.

470
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,543
We go, we go, we go.

471
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,812
To the cave.

472
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:10,871
Where Nodin?

473
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,014
After my, not one.

474
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,777
We go.

475
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,788
We go now.

476
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,015
Go to the van.

477
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:57,954
Get her out of here.

478
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,024
I will be after you.

479
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,060
After you.

480
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,654
Get them out of here.

481
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,587
We go move.

482
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,874
That is too much give birth
That, give me the keys.

483
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,171
Give them to me.

484
01:02:58,307 --> 01:02:59,569
We go.

485
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:30,421
Down there, the cattle ranch of
Rob horn, there will be gas.

486
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,236
We go.

487
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,521
Ho, my God.

488
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,385
More good than they have not brought
That thing with you.

489
01:07:11,994 --> 01:07:13,689
Where this Louis?

490
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:20,936
He must have entered
After that I catch him.

491
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,034
The dress here stops
That I was with me.

492
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:34,242
Taenia some strange things in his body.

493
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,544
Cut one, this died.

494
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,821
He has not moved one since I put it here.

495
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:54,228
Enjoy it, fondness, is
To 300 dollars the bottle.

496
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,558
An organism is parasite
He takes a kind of poison.

497
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:29,794
It is as if I was one
Predigestión system.

498
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,033
It is as if they turned that
I eliminate the internal organs.

499
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:39,310
Your you taste all.

500
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,580
I saw it before in the truck.

501
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,212
We were fence of

502
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,823
To steps from my and I go one.

503
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,827
Why do not I kill me like the others?

504
01:08:59,235 --> 01:09:01,396
By the poison.

505
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,101
Why do not the darts work?

506
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,975
We go to by the others.

507
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,597
Follow me.

508
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,875
This round here.

509
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,249
The uranium, is what he does
That the poison works.

510
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:04,824
When they began to investigate this.

511
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,958
They were combining the three guidelines.

512
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:12,223
I was in the drawings because
They knew that it was part of the process.

513
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:18,636
Ok, is a uranium mine.

514
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,275
I have tools to extract
Uranium in my laboratory.

515
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,109
I wait that this intact one.

516
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:34,184
If that thing do not turn round one

517
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:40,050
Maybe because always
He found food here.

518
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,656
Won, the men later first.

519
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:47,695
Nobody do I escape?

520
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:52,131
Everyone of the house went out
In a big truck.

521
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:55,777
When I start he went.

522
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:59,071
And we remain here.

523
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,647
Fighting for our lives.

524
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,616
Not is he how go out of here?

525
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:11,220
Only him that there is is that one
Thing at the end of the path.

526
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:14,061
I have not used it in mas as a year.

527
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,921
The batteries are died like that that

528
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:22,769
We have a battery.

529
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:45,860
To my me I prick one, once.

530
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,757
Does he hurt a lot, not?

531
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,159
If.

532
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:30,237
Do you believe that we will go out?

533
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:37,074
If, there will always be alcohol
For her, he worried.

534
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,647
What does that to say want?

535
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:43,677
That has to use the light
Of the moon as cache.

536
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,442
I seized same.

537
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,452
We go, you want a handshake.

538
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:51,655
Your you know that he is.

539
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:55,893
They are some idiots.

540
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,994
Her them I save life
During this over there outside alone one.

541
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,826
Trying to save them.

542
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,232
I have it.

543
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,927
There is a generator behind that door.

544
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,225
