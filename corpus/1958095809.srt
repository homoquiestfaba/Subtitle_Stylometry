1
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:07,869
What the fuck, Caleb?

2
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,704
Oh, wait till you see
the shot I got.

3
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,139
You looked like you were gonna
shit a brick out sideways.

4
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,808
You could have taken
my head off.

5
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,409
It wouldn't have been a clean
decapitation

6
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,844
with these blades.

7
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,880
You'd just scramble
your face up real good.

8
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,190
Shouldn't you go see if
Jessica is feeling any better?

9
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:32,125
She'll be fine.
I gave her Klonopin

10
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,228
so she can sleep off whatever
the fuck is wrong with her.

11
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,230
Girl is such a pain
in the ass.

12
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,224
Jessica?

13
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,477
Hey.

14
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,779
How you feeling, cuz?

15
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,552
Since none of these other
friends of yours

16
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,588
bothered to show up,

17
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,791
can I take your car and escape
the hell of being stuck here

18
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,860
with your latest boyfriend?

19
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,732
Great chat.

20
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:55,610
You better wake up
in the next half hour

21
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,345
or I'm gonna be forced
to go drown

22
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,748
that brainless meat puppet's
sorry ass.

23
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,246
"The intense horror
of my nightmare came over me."

24
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,983
"I tried to draw back my arm

25
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:38,351
but the hand clung on

26
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,556
and a most melancholy
voice sobbed,

27
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,857
'Let me in.'"

28
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,257
"'Let me in!'"

29
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:47,494
"As it spoke,

30
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,630
I discerned, obscurely

31
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,966
a child's face
looking through the window."

32
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,737
"Finding it useless to attempt

33
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,605
shaking the creature off,

34
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,307
I pulled its wrist on to
the broken pane..."

35
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,876
Jess?

36
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,277
-"...and rubbed it
to and fro..."
-Please shut up.

37
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,646
"...till the blood ran down

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,682
and soaked the bedclothes."

39
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:10,852
"Yet still it wailed,
'Let me in!'"

40
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,352
Jessica!

41
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,812
Shit, shit, shit!

42
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,379
Shit, shit, shit!

43
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,586
No, Jess. Jess? Jess?

44
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:06,841
Who's the brainless
meat puppet now?

45
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,453
Caleb.

46
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,756
What the fuck?

47
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:24,892
Oh, my God.

48
00:05:24,926 --> 00:05:26,093
What the hell happened?

49
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:30,798
Jess?

50
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:35,435
Jessica?

51
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,116
What the fuck? What?

52
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,952
No, no, no...

53
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:53,120
Caleb!

54
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,423
No...

55
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:01,095
No, Caleb!

56
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,165
Caleb!

57
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,096
Beth!

58
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,533
Beth, you in there?

59
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,771
Just give me five, all right?

60
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,506
Brandon is losing his shit.

61
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,907
He can't find the Strat he won

62
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,610
in that arm wrestling contest
last night.

63
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,578
It's already tuned and racked
stage left

64
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,981
like I told you it was
half an hour ago.

65
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:30,084
You feeling all right
in there?

66
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,887
I'm fine.

67
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,122
Just go man your station.

68
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:37,558
I'll be back before
curtains up.

69
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,826
You got it, boss.

70
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,596
Have you seen my favorite
black t-shirt?

71
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,564
I need it for the Labor Day
protest tomorrow.

72
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:55,302
Mom?

73
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:58,039
You're not going to any
protest on your own.

74
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,774
Sophie's dad's taking us.

75
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,042
I've told you, like,
ten times already.

76
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:02,810
Remember?

77
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,078
Well, did you remember
to check the bathroom hamper?

78
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,984
Tell Danny
to turn the music down.

79
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,852
Mom says,
"Turn the music down!"

80
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,621
I could've done that myself!

81
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,242
Kassie, you better not have
my scissors.

82
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:38,879
Don't got 'em, Mom!

83
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,385
It's dirty.

84
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,920
Well, stick it in the laundry,
and I'll do it later.

85
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,888
You'll forget.
You always forget.

86
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:50,324
You know where
the washing machine is.

87
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,100
Hey, Bridget.
Mom's on nights

88
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:01,102
and we're watching
all the Freddy movies in a row.

89
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:04,004
-Even the shitty ones.
-There aren't any shitty ones.

90
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,675
So, you, um,
wanna come over and...

91
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,043
In your dreams.

92
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,291
Your boyfriends are weirdos.

93
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:25,759
You're the weirdo.

94
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,297
Kassie!

95
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:47,781
Big crowd in tonight, Dan?

96
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,886
-Get out, Bridge!
-I would, but--

97
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,420
Let me in!

98
00:11:05,232 --> 00:11:06,967
Somebody get that, please!

99
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,372
All right, all right!

100
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:29,023
Boo!

101
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,027
Beth.

102
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,129
You bitch.

103
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,397
Surprise, sis.

104
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,234
When did you get into town?

105
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,304
I Uber'd straight here
from LAX.

106
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,108
Hmm.

107
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:51,111
You been sleeping?
You look like Mom.

108
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,247
Beats looking like a tampon.

109
00:11:54,882 --> 00:11:57,084
You know, the downstairs
buzzer is totally busted.

110
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,086
I was able to walk in
right off the street.

111
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,421
Whole building's busted.

112
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,389
It's getting knocked
in a month.

113
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:03,958
You're kidding me.

114
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,459
Nope. We're out.

115
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,461
Have you guys found
a new place?

116
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,431
Not yet.

117
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:13,501
Shit, El. You and Jay
have been here forever.

118
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,437
Was Bangkok awesome?

119
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,473
Insane. Crazy, obsessive fans
over there.

120
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:20,941
Did you drink snake blood?

121
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,977
Hey,
that's culturally insensitive.

122
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,512
What about
monkey brain barbecue?

123
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:26,548
Oh, yeah.
That's so much better, Dan.

124
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:27,948
Who's your friend, Kass?

125
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:29,416
She's called Staffanie.

126
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,319
Oh. Hey, Staffanie.

127
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:34,388
What's her, uh, situation?

128
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:38,225
Danny told me that when this
building used to be a bank,

129
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,562
a teller got caught stealing
and hunged himself

130
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,429
and if you walk around
with coins in your pockets,

131
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:44,865
his ghost hears the jingle.

132
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,368
And he scares you to death
so he can take all your money.

133
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,304
It's true.

134
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,072
If he comes after me,

135
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:54,375
Staffanie will scare him
to death first.

136
00:12:55,476 --> 00:12:57,144
Ghosts aren't real.

137
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,046
-Have you ever seen one?
-Mmm-mmm.

138
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,115
Then how do you know
they don't exist?

139
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,050
Because...

140
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,253
I only believe what I can see.

141
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,955
For me?

142
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:12,092
- It's for badass
rock chicks only.

143
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:15,896
Look, Mom. I'm a badass.

144
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,566
Please don't indoctrinate her
into your groupie world.

145
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
What's a groupie?

146
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,536
Your mom's favorite
nickname for me,

147
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,238
even though she knows
I'm a guitar technician.

148
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,540
If you say so.

149
00:13:25,573 --> 00:13:28,208
Hey, be nice
or you don't get a gift.

150
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:30,311
Speaking of which,

151
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,446
check out what I got your dad.

152
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:43,558
What's going on, El?

153
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:48,262
Danny, go take my car and get
pizza with your sisters.

154
00:13:49,296 --> 00:13:50,464
Sure thing, Mom.

155
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,403
I just can't wrap my head
around all this.

156
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:58,372
What, did he meet
someone else?

157
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:00,908
No. He believes paying
child support

158
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,610
equals co-parenting from afar.

159
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,583
Why didn't you tell me, El?

160
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:10,518
I would've jumped
right on a plane

161
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:12,286
to help you work through this.

162
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,190
I called you.

163
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,226
Twice.

164
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,095
First time, when he told me
he was leaving.

165
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,530
Second,
the night he moved out.

166
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:26,867
That was two and half
months ago, Beth.

167
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,077
I'm sorry, okay?

168
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:39,179
You know when I'm on the road,
I get sucked in deep

169
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:40,648
and I'm trying to make
chief tech right now.

170
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:42,216
And if I do,
I'll be the first woman

171
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,618
in my crew to do it, so...

172
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,456
Please, Ellie, we need
to talk this through properly.

173
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,660
El...

174
00:14:52,694 --> 00:14:55,062
Look, you can sleep
on the sofa tonight

175
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:57,699
but I gotta pack and move.

176
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,430
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo.</i>

177
00:15:29,463 --> 00:15:31,131
<i>It's Ellie. Just...</i>

178
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:34,536
<i>calling to say hi. And, um...</i>

179
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,371
<i>me and Jay, we, uh...</i>

180
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,609
<i>You know what--</i>

181
00:15:41,643 --> 00:15:43,645
I don't blame you.

182
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:45,479
I hate the sound
of my voice too.

183
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,293
What's going on with you,
Beth?

184
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,700
I screwed up again,
like I always do.

185
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:10,304
And I need you to help me
figure it out.

186
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,139
Again.

187
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,107
What happened?

188
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:17,077
Mmm.

189
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,488
Hurry up, Bridge.

190
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:29,122
You wanna carry them?

191
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,090
You wanna get your license?

192
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,695
Come on, Kass.

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,609
Earthquake!

194
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:57,150
Come on.

195
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,188
Go!

196
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,294
Stay down!

197
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,377
Shit.

198
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,279
That was intense.

199
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,080
I think I peed my pants.

200
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,584
Is it warm?

201
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,687
Mmm-mmm.

202
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,121
It's probably just soda.

203
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,423
All right. Come on.

204
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:55,309
Holy shit.
Bridget, check this out.

205
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,277
What is it?

206
00:17:58,478 --> 00:17:59,446
There's a hole.

207
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,526
Careful, Dan.
There could be aftershocks.

208
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,304
It's an old bank vault!

209
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,643
Danny, don't!

210
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,207
Dan?

211
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:09,817
Come on, Danny. Let's go!

212
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,251
Just hang on!

213
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:50,390
Danny!

214
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:51,759
Relax a minute, Bridge!

215
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:13,447
Danny, are you okay?

216
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,615
I'm fine.

217
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:24,886
Anything?

218
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,453
The network
is totally screwed.

219
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,956
I'm sure they're fine, El.

220
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:35,362
Hey.

221
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,732
Is everyone okay?
Anybody hurt?

222
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:40,101
Hey, Gabe.
The kids went to go get pizza

223
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,569
and I can't get through
on their cells.

224
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:42,770
Can I borrow your car
to go find them?

225
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,505
-How about I drive you?
-Thanks.

226
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,773
Let me get the keys.

227
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,416
-Who are you?
-Beth.

228
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,786
Ellie's sister.

229
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,856
Ah, yeah, yeah.
The groupie.

230
00:22:03,724 --> 00:22:04,659
Let me ask you somethin'.

231
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,728
Can you hear her up there?

232
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:10,463
-What?
-Quake.

233
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:11,866
Sent her hiding in the ducts.

234
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:16,571
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

235
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,941
Let's roll.

236
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,645
Is that them?

237
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,747
Good to meet you.

238
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:32,954
You never take the elevator
after a quake.

239
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:36,057
Bridget dropped the pizza.

240
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,660
Oh, honey. I love you guys
so much more than pizza.

241
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:50,771
<i>The magnitude 5.5 earthquake</i>

242
00:22:50,805 --> 00:22:52,740
<i>hit just north</i>
<i>of the Puente Hills fault</i>

243
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:53,975
<i>less than an hour ago.</i>

244
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:55,676
<i>Jolting downtown Los Angeles</i>

245
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,511
<i>and everywhere from</i>
<i>La Habra to...</i>

246
00:23:20,902 --> 00:23:23,738
You think it might
be worth something?

247
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:25,640
Mom could do with some extra
money right now,

248
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:27,174
don't you think?

249
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:29,143
I don't think Mom wants cash
from something you stole.

250
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,045
It's not stolen.

251
00:23:31,078 --> 00:23:33,047
It's probably been
locked in that vault forever.

252
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,883
Yeah, and weird shit like this
gets locked away for a reason.

253
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,189
Just leave it, Dan.

254
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,860
Argh! Fuck!

255
00:23:46,661 --> 00:23:48,195
Let me see it.

256
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:49,163
It's just a nick.

257
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,173
Dan...

258
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,634
Danny, please close it.

259
00:24:43,951 --> 00:24:45,252
I don't like this, Dan.

260
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:47,955
You need to put it back
right now.

261
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:50,858
Mom's not letting any of us
out the front door
again tonight.

262
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:51,892
First thing in the morning
then.

263
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,161
Promise me?

264
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,711
You going deep sea diving?

265
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:13,247
I gotta see under
before I get in.

266
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,150
I got stung by a jellyfish
at the beach before.

267
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,953
I don't like going underwater.

268
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:20,955
I don't think
there's any weird

269
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:22,656
sea creatures in the tub.

270
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:35,269
Oh, my God!

271
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:36,937
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

272
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,640
It's a... It's a...

273
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:55,056
You okay?

274
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,291
I'm good, sweetie.

275
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:03,564
I hate when
my tummy hurts too.

276
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,123
<i>Good afternoon,</i>
<i>my fellow clergymen.</i>

277
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:04,158
<i>I am Father Marcus Littleton,</i>

278
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:07,328
<i>the library keeper here</i>
<i>at Saint Patrick's Cathedral</i>

279
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:10,397
<i>and I welcome you all today</i>
<i>to the City of Angels.</i>

280
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,968
<i>You've been invited here</i>

281
00:27:14,001 --> 00:27:17,104
<i>to witness the unveiling</i>
<i>of a unique artifact</i>

282
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:20,174
<i>that was discovered</i>
<i>by our overseas missionaries.</i>

283
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:22,076
<i>I would like to present</i>

284
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:25,913
<i>what I believe to be one of</i>
<i>the three fabled volumes</i>

285
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:27,848
<i>of</i> Naturum Demento,

286
00:27:27,882 --> 00:27:30,084
The Book of the Dead.

287
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:34,822
<i>My tests to date have revealed</i>

288
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:38,292
<i>that its bindings</i>
<i>are made of cured human flesh,</i>

289
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,162
<i>its passages and etchings</i>
<i>inked in blood.</i>

290
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,796
<i>This is heresy!</i>

291
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,732
<i>Today,</i>
<i>I seek church approval</i>

292
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:46,934
<i>to translate</i>
<i>the spiritual mysteries</i>

293
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,802
<i>its pages undoubtedly hold.</i>

294
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,404
<i>Destroy it!</i>

295
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,306
<i>It's called</i> The Book of
the Dead <i>for a reason!</i>

296
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,276
<i>I seek to look at</i>
<i>this book for the good of man!</i>

297
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:17,164
<i>Rejected by</i>
<i>the elders of our church,</i>

298
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:20,201
<i>myself, Canon Damien Shanahan,</i>

299
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,504
<i>and Father Hugo Cortez</i>

300
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,471
<i>have been working in secret</i>
<i>to translate</i>

301
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:28,842
The Book of the Dead's
<i>myriad writings and glyphs.</i>

302
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:32,780
<i>Its pages contain ancient</i>
<i>rituals and incantations,</i>

303
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:34,448
<i>the recitation of which</i>

304
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,218
<i>proclaim to allow contact</i>
<i>with supernatural forces</i>

305
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:40,754
<i>that exist beyond the thin</i>
<i>veneer of our known world.</i>

306
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:58,472
<i>It is January 24th</i>
<i>in the year of our Lord, 1923.</i>

307
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:03,277
<i>And I,</i>
<i>Father Marcus Littleton,</i>

308
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,813
<i>shall now commence</i>
<i>reading aloud</i>

309
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,349
<i>the first of the spiritual</i>
<i>resurrection passages.</i>

310
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,441
Hey!

311
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,910
Help!

312
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,244
Help!

313
00:31:32,594 --> 00:31:34,696
Shut the fuck up!

314
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,341
It's okay. It's okay.

315
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:55,409
It's just a blackout.

316
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:22,135
Bridget?

317
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:24,137
You all right?

318
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,508
Yeah.

319
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:28,342
Looks like it's just us
that's out.

320
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:31,679
Really?

321
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:40,755
Mom?

322
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:44,124
El, are you sleeping?

323
00:33:47,729 --> 00:33:49,162
Where is she?

324
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,304
Mom?

325
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,116
El?

326
00:35:07,474 --> 00:35:09,242
What's up, sis?

327
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:17,184
I had the most
beautiful dream.

328
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:22,255
We were together,
sitting in a tall forest.

329
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,660
The wind was clean

330
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:27,595
and the birds were singing
the sweetest...

331
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,971
Melodies.

332
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,409
It was a perfect day
and all I could think about

333
00:35:42,442 --> 00:35:44,812
was how much I wanted
to cut you all open

334
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:46,547
and climb inside your bodies

335
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,850
so that we could stay
one happy family.

336
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,775
It's in me.

337
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,809
Don't let it take my babies.

338
00:36:57,051 --> 00:36:58,786
Mom!

339
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,253
Bridget, take her back inside.

340
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:03,490
Now!

341
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,563
What's wrong with her, Bridge?

342
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:20,708
Stairs. Go!
Go, go, go.

343
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:25,813
Come on.

344
00:37:25,847 --> 00:37:27,682
Wake up, Ellie.
Come on, wake up.

345
00:37:27,715 --> 00:37:29,016
Danny!

346
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,518
They're gone.

347
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:50,905
One minute she was fine

348
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:53,306
and the next
she was talking crazy and...

349
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,476
And now she's gone.

350
00:38:19,801 --> 00:38:21,002
Network's still fucked.

351
00:38:26,073 --> 00:38:27,407
May I pray?

352
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:30,778
She's not religious.

353
00:38:33,748 --> 00:38:34,682
Wasn't.

354
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:37,350
It's just a few words.

355
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:39,821
Join me.

356
00:38:51,866 --> 00:38:55,102
Eternal rest grant unto her,
O Lord

357
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,638
and let perpetual light
shine upon her.

358
00:38:59,574 --> 00:39:00,975
May her soul

359
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:03,578
and the souls
of all the faithful departed

360
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,846
through the mercy of God--

361
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:06,413
What the hell happened
to her face?

362
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:09,617
Rest in peace.

363
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:13,054
Looks like someone
beat her up.

364
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:18,159
There's an old fire-escape
ladder

365
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,493
on the north side
of the building.

366
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:22,763
I could try to get down that,

367
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:24,832
raise the alarm,
get some help in here.

368
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,167
You have to go through 82.

369
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,434
Ah, shit.

370
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:29,871
That's unoccupied, right?

371
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:31,873
Yeah. Like most of this
condemned dump.

372
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,409
You got the tools?

373
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:38,179
We could just cut right
through the door.

374
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,147
In my truck.

375
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:41,649
You ain't gettin' through
those old doors

376
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:43,050
without something heavy-duty.

377
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:50,992
I want Dad to come home.

378
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,162
He will.

379
00:39:57,198 --> 00:39:59,466
When we get the phones working
again, he'll come right back.

380
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:00,801
How do you know he will?

381
00:40:02,737 --> 00:40:04,805
You said Mom
was gonna be okay.

382
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,841
I thought she would be.

383
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,876
I'm so sorry, Kass.

384
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,982
I'm gonna get my shotgun,
and we're gonna blast it open.

385
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:16,651
Just give me a minute, okay?

386
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:19,020
I don't like being trapped.

387
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:20,487
Everyone is on edge enough

388
00:40:20,521 --> 00:40:22,089
without guns getting fired
in here.

389
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:04,198
I don't know what to do, El.

390
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:07,501
You're the one
who always has the answers.

391
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:14,809
I'm too scared to even face
your kids right now.

392
00:41:26,087 --> 00:41:28,122
No matter how busy
you ever got,

393
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,191
you always found time for me.

394
00:41:31,726 --> 00:41:32,960
For everyone.

395
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:40,001
I can't believe I'm never
gonna speak to you again.

396
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:45,539
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo. It's Ellie.</i>

397
00:41:45,573 --> 00:41:49,677
<i>Just... calling to say hi.</i>
<i>And, uh...</i>

398
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,778
<i>Beth.</i>

399
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:52,246
<i>Beth!</i>

400
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,715
<i>You have to help me, Beth.</i>
<i>You have to.</i>

401
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:57,251
<i>- I'm burning.</i>
<i>I'm burning alive!</i>

402
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,811
El?

403
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,589
-Mom?
-She's alive?

404
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:37,958
She's burning up.

405
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:49,970
I'll get ice.

406
00:44:02,376 --> 00:44:03,310
Mom?

407
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:07,047
Mommy's with the maggots now.

408
00:45:07,041 --> 00:45:08,809
Mom, stop it!

409
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:16,350
Stop it!

410
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:22,923
It's not my fault, Bridget.

411
00:45:25,326 --> 00:45:27,795
Get away from her, Bridge!

412
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:30,331
What's happening to me,
sweetheart?

413
00:45:30,364 --> 00:45:31,432
I don't know, Mom.

414
00:45:34,235 --> 00:45:35,336
I do.

415
00:45:42,009 --> 00:45:43,143
I'm free now.

416
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:47,982
Free from all you
titty-sucking parasites.

417
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:17,579
Let me kiss it better.

418
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:45,806
Who wants to rot next?

419
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,143
Eeny...

420
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:53,414
meeny...

421
00:46:53,447 --> 00:46:54,815
miny...

422
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,219
You.

423
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:02,456
Ellie?

424
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:21,208
Fuck!

425
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,358
Grab the cabinet.

426
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:19,634
Get away from the door.

427
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,278
Please, we need help!

428
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,146
Let me in!

429
00:49:57,197 --> 00:49:58,398
Hello!

430
00:50:00,802 --> 00:50:03,070
Can you hear me?

431
00:50:13,848 --> 00:50:16,416
Don't you think Mom looks
just like one of those pictures
from that book?

432
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:21,789
Answer me, Danny.

433
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:30,130
You never should've stolen it.

434
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,431
This isn't my fault.

435
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:33,267
This is your fault!

436
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,670
- Get off me! Get off!
- Stop it!

437
00:50:35,703 --> 00:50:37,705
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-This is all your fault!

438
00:50:38,438 --> 00:50:39,507
Hey. Hey.

439
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:44,211
You don't turn on each other.

440
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:47,715
Ever.

441
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,385
I need to show you something.

442
00:51:09,837 --> 00:51:11,371
What is this, Danny?

443
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:22,115
Does it hurt bad?

444
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:26,386
Bridget?

445
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:31,158
I'm okay.

Beth?

456
00:52:53,808 --> 00:52:55,943
I took these too.

457
00:52:55,977 --> 00:52:57,645
There's this creepy priest
on them,

458
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,946
reading passages
from the book.

459
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,782
It's like a weird dark prayer.

460
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,518
And when he spoke the words...

461
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:11,826

Hey there, cutie-pie.

470
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:20,027
What's wrong with you, Mom?

471
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:26,768
I was just feeling sad about
me and your dad.

472
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:28,069
But he's here now.

473
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:30,337
He came home to see us.

474
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,939
We're getting back together.

475
00:54:33,641 --> 00:54:34,976
We love each other.

476
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,813
Isn't that right, my darling?

477
00:54:46,754 --> 00:54:48,956
And we love you too.

478
00:55:17,952 --> 00:55:20,387
Open up and let us in, Kassie.

479
00:55:22,523 --> 00:55:24,992
We can be a big,
happy family again.

480
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:29,063
You don't look so good, Mom.

481
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,600
Oh.

482
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:36,671
Nothing a big old hug and kiss
from you won't fix.

483
00:55:38,139 --> 00:55:39,574
Open up now,

484
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,876
like a good girl.

485
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,885
That's it.

486
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,420
Come on, now.

487
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:58,425
Do it for Mom and Dad.

488
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:13,608
Mom!

489
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:30,725
-You okay?
-I'm sorry.

490
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:34,427
I thought Mom was better.

491
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:37,965
Open the door
like you open your legs,

492
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:39,533
you stinking groupie slut!

493
00:56:42,937 --> 00:56:47,474
I'm not a groupie,
you psycho bitch!

494
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:53,781
Beth.

495
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:57,919
Beth.

496
00:57:00,922 --> 00:57:02,455
Go to your room.

497
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:21,809
It'll be okay, Danny.

498
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:28,582
Staffanie will protect us.
Right?

499
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:36,624
Yeah.

500
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:21,068
What are you looking at, hon?

501
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:43,791
I gotta
kill the creepy-crawlies

502
00:58:43,824 --> 00:58:45,826
that I got inside my tummy.

503
00:58:57,705 --> 00:59:00,541
I don't like having things
inside my tummy.

504
00:59:07,081 --> 00:59:08,983
Do you, Auntie Beth?

505
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:18,913
Hey.

506
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:22,416
Is this a nightmare?

507
01:01:25,252 --> 01:01:27,121
It's just like a nightmare,
Kass.

508
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:32,793
Is what happened to Bridget
and Mom gonna happen to us?

509
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:34,261
I'm not gonna let that happen.

510
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,697
I promise.

511
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:42,436
You'd be a good mom someday,
Auntie Beth.

512
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:46,840
Oh, yeah?

513
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:47,875
Yeah.

514
01:01:49,476 --> 01:01:51,478
You know how to lie to kids.

515
01:02:19,907 --> 01:02:21,408
I thought I should tie her up.

516
01:02:23,444 --> 01:02:24,812
Just in case.

517
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:30,818
I wanna listen to that vinyl.

518
01:02:32,219 --> 01:02:34,922
It's too dangerous.
Those words...

519
01:02:34,955 --> 01:02:37,559
Yeah, well, maybe
there's words on there

520
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:40,461
that can help stop
all of this.

521
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:45,232
We've got no power
to run a turntable.

522
01:02:47,535 --> 01:02:49,003
I can fix that.

523
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:12,560
I listened to the first
and then he spoke the words
on the second.

524
01:03:16,497 --> 01:03:19,433
I guess I'll start
at the other end, then.

525
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:26,373
Just in case.

526
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:58,606
<i>It is now two nights</i>

527
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,475

528
01:04:01,509 --> 01:04:04,445

529
01:04:04,478 --> 01:04:07,481

530
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:09,551

537
01:04:32,005 --> 01:04:34,441
Is Bridget gonna
come back like Mom?

538
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,279
I don't know, Kass.

539
01:04:42,216 --> 01:04:45,052
<i>The demon possessed</i>

540

01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:00,234

<i>under its control.</i>

545
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:07,975
<i>Fellow priests</i>
<i>came to our aid</i>

546
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,611
<i>but the possession quickly</i>
<i>spread amongst them</i>

547
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:11,579
<i>without rhyme nor reason.</i>

548
01:05:25,693 --> 01:05:29,664
<i>This evil is not governed</i>
<i>by the rules of man.</i>

549
01:05:29,697 --> 01:05:32,366
<i>No, it takes its pleasure</i>

550
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:35,603
<i>in creating terror</i>
<i>through total chaos.</i>

551
01:05:41,308 --> 01:05:43,711
<i>Desperate to end this curse,</i>

552
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:47,515
<i>I tried to kill what were once</i>
<i>my brothers.</i>

553
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:50,384
<i>I led them to the woodshed</i>
<i>and set it ablaze.</i>

554
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:53,487
<i>But they danced in its flame</i>

555
01:05:53,521 --> 01:05:55,723
<i>and reveled in its burn.</i>

556
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:24,017
Mr. Fonda's kitty hides up
there sometimes.

557
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,790
I don't think it's a cat.

558
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:31,458
<i>I buried their</i>
<i>squirming, spitting corpses</i>

559
01:06:31,492 --> 01:06:32,727
<i>in consecrated earth.</i>

560
01:06:34,729 --> 01:06:36,731
<i>But they arose again,</i>

561
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:38,566
<i>rotting and rage-filled.</i>

562
01:06:46,406 --> 01:06:48,543
Careful, Danny.

563
01:07:33,755 --> 01:07:36,490
<i>After hiding</i>
<i>in the cellar for a night,</i>

564
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:38,593
<i>I knew only</i>
<i>one choice remained.</i>

565
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,063
<i>Complete bodily dismemberment.</i>

566
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:05,820
Told you, you should've
put the book back, Danny.

567
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:26,206
<i>I chopped, and I hacked,</i>
<i>and I...</i>

568
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,577
<i>I failed.</i>

569
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:37,184
<i>I can hear them</i>
<i>outside the doors now,</i>
<i>begging for me.</i>

570
01:08:37,217 --> 01:08:41,388
<i>It is only a matter of time</i>
<i>before I am taken too.</i>

571
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:45,325
<i>Nothing can stop</i>
<i>this demonic force.</i>

572
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,161
<i>Even its final remnants</i>
<i>will come after you.</i>

573
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:50,732
<i>You must run.</i>

574
01:08:50,765 --> 01:08:53,166
<i>All you can do is run!</i>

575
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:05,513
<i>This horror will not stop</i>

576
01:09:05,546 --> 01:09:07,582
<i>until innocence is destroyed.</i>

577
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:10,652
<i>Until evil...</i>

578
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:12,754
<i>...be thy name.</i>

579
01:09:33,941 --> 01:09:34,809
Danny.

580
01:09:39,312 --> 01:09:41,516
I'm sorry, Kass.

581
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:52,225
I will swallow your soul.

582
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:13,748
Two souls?

583
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:20,888
Please. El...

584
01:10:20,922 --> 01:10:24,826
Ellie waits in hell for you
and your unborn bastard baby.

585
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:25,860
No.

586
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:33,768
Auntie Beth!

587
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:57,324
Are you hurt?

588
01:11:01,796 --> 01:11:03,531
Are you gonna be a mom?

589
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:13,273
Yes.

590
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,613
And I'm getting us
out of here.

591
01:11:19,847 --> 01:11:20,915
How?

592
01:11:54,414 --> 01:11:55,750
Fire escape. Let's go.

593
01:12:04,525 --> 01:12:06,894
Don't look back there.

594
01:13:13,561 --> 01:13:15,428
Get back. Cover your ears.

595
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,434
Bethy-boo!

596
01:13:38,085 --> 01:13:39,486
She's trying to take

597
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,122
your mommy away
from you, Kassie.

598
01:13:43,157 --> 01:13:45,192
I know you're not my mom
anymore.

599
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:52,967
Don't take me from them.

600
01:13:54,835 --> 01:13:56,537
You have no idea
what it's like

601
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,873
to bring a child into
this world, Beth.

602
01:14:04,278 --> 01:14:07,748
That's my gun,
you thieving cunt.

603
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:15,122
Auntie Beth!

604
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:17,158
Auntie Beth!

605
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,550
Everybody here
dies by dawn, Beth.

606
01:14:43,217 --> 01:14:45,252
Run!

607
01:14:45,286 --> 01:14:46,787
Dead by dawn!

608
01:14:47,888 --> 01:14:49,857
Dead by dawn!

609
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:52,626
-Dead by dawn!
-By dawn!

610
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:55,763
Dead by dawn!

611
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,733
Dead by dawn!

612
01:14:58,766 --> 01:15:01,035
Dead by dawn!

613
01:15:01,068 --> 01:15:02,203
Dead by dawn!

614
01:15:03,971 --> 01:15:05,906
Dead by dawn!

615
01:15:06,907 --> 01:15:08,042
Dead by dawn!

616
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:11,512
Dead by dawn!

617
01:15:15,983 --> 01:15:17,118
Here.

618
01:16:26,053 --> 01:16:28,756
No way out!

619
01:16:28,789 --> 01:16:31,358
No way out!

620
01:16:31,392 --> 01:16:33,661
No way out!

621
01:16:44,038 --> 01:16:45,606
-Auntie Beth!
-Come here!

622
01:16:58,953 --> 01:17:00,654
No!

623
01:17:59,213 --> 01:18:01,182
Kassie. Kassie.

624
01:18:03,284 --> 01:18:06,987
Kassie. Kassie. Kassie.

625
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,360
Am I dead?

626
01:18:34,014 --> 01:18:35,249
Come on. Get in.

627
01:18:58,573 --> 01:19:00,007
Kass, where's the beeper?

628
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:10,451
Come on. Come on.

629
01:19:31,372 --> 01:19:32,339
It's coming.

630
01:21:27,254 --> 01:21:28,122
Get under!

631
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,234
Kassie!

632
01:22:16,203 --> 01:22:19,239
All I want
is your little head, baby girl.

633
01:22:40,394 --> 01:22:41,995
Come get some.

634
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:08,816
Turn it on, Kass!

635
01:25:02,469 --> 01:25:03,638
Please.

636
01:25:04,806 --> 01:25:06,473
Help me, Bethy-boo.

637
01:25:08,576 --> 01:25:12,580
Only my sister
gets to call me that.

638
01:25:46,648 --> 01:25:48,816
You know, you really do
look like Mom.

639
01:25:51,485 --> 01:25:55,288
And you're gonna fail
miserably just like her.

640
01:25:55,322 --> 01:25:56,724
You stinking, horrible...

641
01:25:56,758 --> 01:25:59,192
...groupie cunt!

642
01:28:30,845 --> 01:28:32,079
There's been no cell signal

643
01:28:32,113 --> 01:28:33,480
until, like, five minutes ago

644
01:28:33,514 --> 01:28:34,882
and the thunder kept me awake,

645
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:37,518
so I got basically
less than zero sleep.

646
01:28:37,552 --> 01:28:40,087
Anyway, all my early morning
moans aside,

647
01:28:40,121 --> 01:28:43,724
we are still gonna have such
a fab weekend at the lake.

648
01:28:43,758 --> 01:28:45,660
Caleb's dad's cabin
is so awesome,

649
01:28:45,693 --> 01:28:47,929
and you're gonna absolutely
love his friends.

650
01:28:49,997 --> 01:28:52,365
I'm sure one of them
will be perfect for you.

651
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:54,434
<i>I don't mean to be</i>
<i>a downer or anything</i>

652
01:28:54,467 --> 01:28:56,671
<i>but I was actually thinking</i>
<i>of taking a rain check</i>

653
01:28:56,704 --> 01:28:58,940
<i>on this whole trip thing.</i>

654
01:28:58,973 --> 01:28:59,941
Not a chance.

655
01:28:59,974 --> 01:29:01,609
I'm picking you up in 15.

656
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,643
Bye!
