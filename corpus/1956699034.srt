1
00:00:07,137 --> 00:00:08,660
So, you want me
to sit here?

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,010
Yes.
Make yourself comfortable.

3
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:11,489
Okay.

4
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,017
Right.

5
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,020
So, do I look okay?
My hair, and--

6
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,717
You look fine.
Don't be nervous.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,327
I'm not nervous.

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,807
All right. Ready?

9
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,069
Yeah.

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,030
Tell me about Kathleen,
your relationship with her.

11
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,032
Well...

12
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:33,903
she was, um...

13
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,297
We were...

14
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,129
- Can I start again?
- Sure.

15
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,049
Kathleen was
the love of my life.

16
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,356
We were together
for 13 years and...

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,055
we got married five years ago.

18
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,144
And, uh...

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,233
We were soulmates,

20
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:01,800
best friends.

21
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:05,108
And there's just no way
in the world that I would...

22
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,464
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:17,294
I can't do this right now.
I thought I could.

24
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,382
I'm so-- I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:20,384
Would you turn that off, please?

26
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,170
I'm just...

27
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:25,389
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,523
All right. Cut.

29
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,308
Oh, God.

30
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:32,875
Oh, my God!

31
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:33,919
Oh, my God!

32
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,922
Oh. Oh, my God.

33
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:38,750
Oh, God.

34
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,579
Kathleen? Oh, God.

35
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:44,147
Oh, God. Oh, oh, God.

36
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,410
Oh, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:47,498
Kathleen, baby.

38
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:51,154
Oh, God.
Oh, my God!

39
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:55,202
Oh, honey. Oh, God!

40
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:56,986
Oh, my God.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,901
Oh.

42
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,514
Durham 911, 
where's your emergency?

43
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:05,995
- 1810 Cedar Street, please!
- What's wrong, sir?

44
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,823
My-- My wife's had an accident!

45
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,825
- She's-- She's still breathing!
- What kind--

46
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,132
-What kind of accident?
-Uh, she fell down the stairs!

47
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,872
She's still breathing! Please!

48
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:16,353
- Is she conscious?
- No, no! She's not conscious!

49
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,398
- Please!
- How many stairs

50
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:18,964
-did she fall down?
-What?

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,009
How many stairs 
did she fall down?

52
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,837
Oh! Uh, I don't know!
Uh-- Uh--

53
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,405
Uh, fifteen, twenty?
Oh, please. Just hurry.

54
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,058
- Please.
- Calm down, sir.

55
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:28,148
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

56
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,203
Oh, God. Oh, God.

57
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:52,084
Honey?
Are you still with me, honey?

58
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:55,175
Kathleen? Honey?
Oh, my God.

59
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,615
Durham 911. 
Where's your emergency?

60
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,573
She's not breathing!
She stopped breathing!

61
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:03,922
- Calm down, sir.
- Where are you?

62
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,576
What's taking you people
so long?

63
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,838
- Sir, calm down.
- Oh, God.

64
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:07,970
They're on the way.

65
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,668
Hello? Hello?

66
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,367
That night, I was out 
at a party with this girl.

67
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,020
And my parents 
were at home celebrating.

68
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,023
My father's 
a best-selling author,

69
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,200
and he just sold the film rights to his latest book.

70
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,071
It was a big Hollywood deal.

71
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,247
Anyhow, when...

72
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:29,905
When I got home, the ambulance
and cop cars were there.

73
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:32,255
I thought Dad had a heart attack or something.

74
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,430
I-- I didn't know.

75
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:36,216
It's crazy how fast your life
can change.

76
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:38,261
Just like that.

77
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,307
And you believed
your father's story?

78
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:42,265
That Kathleen fell down
the stairs?

79
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,266
It's not a story.

80
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,225
It's the truth.

81
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:52,536
-Honey? Honey--
-Sir. Sir.

82
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,408
-Stay away from the body.
-That's my wife.

83
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,279
-Dad. Dad, come on.
-That's my wife.

84
00:03:56,323 --> 00:03:57,889
- That's my wife.
- Dad, come on.

85
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:03,417
They haven't even
secured the property.

86
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,157
Geez, what's wrong
with these guys?

87
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,074
Nice house.
Whose place is this?

88
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,424
Michael Peterson.

89
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,340
What, you know him?

90
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,907
-Who is he?
-Oh, some writer.

91
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,083
Is he the guy that ran for mayor
two years ago?

92
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,911
Uh-huh.
I sure didn't vote for him.

93
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,130
I didn't vote for him, either.

94
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,088
He seems to be doing okay
as a writer.

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,308
Officer, this is
our ballgame now.

96
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,571
-Where's the body?
-Right over there.

97
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,443
-All right. Secure the property.
-Yes, sir.

98
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,761
Well, the head and neck
still seem to be in alignment.

99
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,329
Shouldn't they be out
of alignment?

100
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:47,330
Mm-hm.

101
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,550
And how'd that get there?

102
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,989
-Kathleen.
-Hey, uh, get him out of here.

103
00:04:54,032 --> 00:04:56,948
-Sir, I'm sorry. We can't--
-Come on, take him out of here.

104
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,994
-All right. There you go.
-Honey?

105
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,300
Dad.
Come on. Come on.

106
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:01,823
Come on, Dad.
Let's go sit down.

107
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,176
O'Neil, you know what to do.

108
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
Excuse me, who's in charge here?

109
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,488
Who wants to know?

110
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,620
Dr. Adams,
State Medical Examiner.

111
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,970
State Medical Examiner?

112
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,450
Yes, sir.

113
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,974
Son, have you even hit
puberty yet?

114
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,024
Let's get some pictures.

115
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,645
You're the Peterson that wrote
the column

116
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:42,646
for the Sun Herald,right?

117
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,996
Uh-huh. It's good stuff.

118
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,042
Let's see, you said, uh...

119
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,220
"Durham cops were so incompetent
that the chance of them

120
00:05:51,263 --> 00:05:53,396
catching a criminal was only
slightly better

121
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,963
than getting struck
by lightning," right?

122
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:57,008
That's nice.

123
00:05:58,706 --> 00:06:01,796
I'm, uh, Detective Joe Castell.

124
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,538
Can you tell me
what happened here?

125
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,978
Well, 
we had a bit to drink.

126
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,153
We were celebrating.

127
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:13,938
Afterwards, I assumed 
she'd gone to bed.

128
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:15,549
She had her flip-flops on.

129
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,681
-So, I posit that she was--
-"Posit?"

130
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:19,291
I'm sorry, I...

131
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,686
I assumed that she was
walking up the stairs.

132
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,828
How did the blood
get onto the wall?

133
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,612
Up so high up there?

134
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,833
I don't know. Maybe she...

135
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,402
tried to get up,
and she fell again.

136
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,709
And all that blood splatter,
how do you figure that happened?

137
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:47,407
I don't know.
I don't know.

138
00:06:48,843 --> 00:06:50,410
From the impact, I guess.

139
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:51,323
Hm.

140
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,108
And, sir, how long

141
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:55,415
between her fall
and your first 911 call?

142
00:06:56,198 --> 00:06:57,721
I was outside 
for a while,

143
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,854
so I-- I-- I don't know 
when she fell.

144
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,422
So, you-- 
you found her, just like that,

145
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,293
when you came running in?

146
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:06,861
I didn't run.

147
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,298
Why would I run?

148
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,909
You see, sir,
what I don't understand is, um,

149
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:15,173
the blood on the steps
over there is already dry.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,438
-It's been dry for a while.
-Look, my dad's already said

151
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,917
he doesn't know
when she fell, okay?

152
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:21,919
Don't make me have
to separate the two of you.

153
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,139
No, you're not gonna
separate the two of us!

154
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,750
And my dad's obviously in shock.
I'm not gonna leave him alone.

155
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,536
Yes, you are, son.

156
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,454
Who's the girl?

157
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:36,978
She's my date.

158
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:41,069
Maybe you ought
to take your date home.

159
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,642
We got the search warrant.

160
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,252
Search warrant?

161
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:52,689
For what?

162
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,740
So, what can you give us?

163
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,133
She fell.

164
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,657
It was an accident.

165
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,528
I'm sorry, Junior.

166
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:06,877
This here is a crime scene.

167
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:12,753
What if it was just an accident?

168
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,496
Have you ever seen
this much blood at an accident?

169
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,499
Uh, yeah.

170
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,413
I have.

171
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:23,503
Drive back over there.

172
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,766
- Oh, excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

173
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,289
- Hold on, ladies.
- It's our dad!

174
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,814
Dad, Dad, it's Martha.

175
00:08:30,858 --> 00:08:32,381
-And Margaret.
-Dad!

176
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,253
Dad, look at me, please, Dad.

177
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,428
Dad, it's gonna be okay.

178
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:38,256
We're gonna get through this,
okay?

179
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,956
We will, together, as a family.

180
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,174
Dad?

181
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:46,177
I love you, Daddy.
It's gonna be okay.

182
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,570
Were you not 
with your sisters that night?

183
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:52,357
I was at school, at Cornell.

184
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:55,578
I had been out all night.

185
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,842
And when I got back
to the sorority house,

186
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:02,716
mm, there were all
these messages on my...

187
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,631
answering machine.

188
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,417
My mom and I were really close.

189
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,986
And, um, Michael was--

190
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:16,033
is a great dad, step dad.

191
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,992
Well, I taught Caitlin to drive,

192
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,951
helped her with schoolwork,
history.

193
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:25,608
I taught her about
the politics of war.

194
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,871
- The politics of war?
- Mm-hm.

195
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:30,395
He was a Marine,
a war hero,

196
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,268
and he has medals and whatnot.

197
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,052
And, uh, he's really smart.

198
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,446
Well, war isn't just
what happens on the battlefield.

199
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,014
There's a--
There's a whole other level.

200
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:43,844
Unseen, the subtext.

201
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:46,020
He always encouraged me

202
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,630
to look at both sides
of the situation,

203
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,806
and that's what I'm trying
to do.

204
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,983
- Is that okay?
- That's great.

205
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,071
You're doing just fine.

206
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,030
I've never done this before.

207
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:04,908
What do you think happened?

208
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:06,780
Sorry?

209
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,782
That night.

210
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,046
What do you think happened?

211
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:21,142
Towards the sidewalk.

212
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:45,122
My poor baby.

213
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,128
Hey.

214
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,826
It's okay.

215
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,262
It's okay.

216
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:57,700
What are they doing?

217
00:10:57,744 --> 00:10:59,180
It's a crime scene.

218
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:00,834
It's a vendetta.

219
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,532
Payback for Dad's
newspaper columns.

220
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,708
It's gonna be okay, honey.

221
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:08,668
They'll let us back in

222
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:09,843
as soon as they finish
with their...

223
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,106
investigation.

224
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,456
Let's go inside.

225
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:15,849
Clayton and your sisters
are waiting.

226
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:34,998
Hi.

227
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,566
Oh, thank you.

228
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:40,917
-Hi, Michael.
-Hey, Candace,

229
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:43,485
thanks for coming.
I am so, so sorry.

230
00:11:43,528 --> 00:11:45,356
Thank you.

231
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,968
Candace, you remember
my brother, Bill, from Reno?

232
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,100
- Kathleen's sister.
- Hello, Candace.

233
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:52,842
-I'm so very sorry.
-Thank you.

234
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,715
- Hi, Aunt Candace.
- Hi, girls.

235
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:56,803
Caitlin.

236
00:11:58,021 --> 00:12:00,023
- Accident?
- Absolutely.

237
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:03,200
Why don't we listen
to her side of the story?

238
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:04,767
The dead never lie.

239
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,642
So, Michael, what happened?

240
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,951
She fell.

241
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:17,954
Thanks, Clayton,
but, I'm...

242
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:19,956
I'm talking to your father.

243
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,179
She fell. She just...

244
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,442
fell.

245
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:30,837
Seven distinct
skull lacerations,

246
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:32,752
not in your preliminary report.

247
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:37,278
Hm, no skull fracture.

248
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,193
Which suggests a fall.

249
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,936
Possibly, but in her throat,
we have a fractured thyroid,

250
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:45,547
suggesting attempted
strangulation.

251
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,157
It could also be caused
by a fall,

252
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:47,984
depending on point of impact.

253
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,771
Possible. Not likely.
Look at her arms.

254
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:55,383
Defensive wounds.

255
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,518
Are you saying
that she was drunk,

256
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:01,824
and that's why
she fell down the stairs?

257
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,174
Well, she...

258
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,177
had a little too much wine, yes.

259
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,789
Aunt Candace,

260
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,443
we all know she drank too much.

261
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,056
Let's stop pretending.

262
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:19,929
Was it murder?

263
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:23,411
Well, it wasn't a fall.
Blunt-force trauma,

264
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,979
a metal object hard enough
to lacerate,

265
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:28,851
but not so hard
as to fracture the skull.

266
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,985
The pattern, it's...
it's like a pitchfork.

267
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,074
No, it wasn't a pitchfork.
And I can tell you,

268
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,815
it was a slow death,

269
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:38,121
-at least two hours.
-Wait a minute.

270
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,775
You're telling me
she was laying on the floor

271
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,690
for two hours,
bleeding to death?

272
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:42,909
And in horrible pain.

273
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:59,142
Can you dust for prints
on these?

274
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:00,361
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

275
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,715
No, it's too heavy.

276
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:08,586
You get hit
with one of these things,

277
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,761
it's a definite skull fracture.

278
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:12,939
Take a look at this,

279
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:15,811
two crystal wine glasses.

280
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,900
Neither has Mrs. Peterson's
fingerprints.

281
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,684
Really?

282
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,383
The husband says she was
drinking from one of them.

283
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,299
No, both have only
his fingerprints.

284
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,831
We have this bottle 
of wine.

285
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,877
The drain reeks of alcohol.

286
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:41,968
We sprayed this floor 
with Luminol.

287
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,059
Somebody tried to clean up 
the bloody footprints.

288
00:14:47,016 --> 00:14:48,452
You sure that's what went down?

289
00:14:48,757 --> 00:14:50,193
That's what the evidence
suggests.

290
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:56,591
Huh.

291
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:58,941
Books on the O.J. Simpson case.

292
00:14:58,985 --> 00:14:59,986
Interesting reading.

293
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,726
Research?

294
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,511
Well, the man is a writer.

295
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,123
Box of condoms.

296
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:10,170
No, two.
No, make that three.

297
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,215
Maybe he was having an affair.

298
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,218
I use condoms.
Am I having an affair?

299
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,134
Maybe they were on sale.
Check this out.

300
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,920
-Huh?
-Someone's been deleting emails.

301
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,357
-Can you retrieve them?
-I'm already on it.

302
00:15:24,836 --> 00:15:26,926
Someone sure likes porn.

303
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:28,623
Porn?

304
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,455
Oh, hey!
How are you?

305
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
Hmm.

306
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:49,122
What happened 
when the detectives returned?

307
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,341
They removed 
Dad's computer,

308
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,953
his books, his files, 
everything.

309
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:56,781
He's a writer. 
How is he supposed to work?

310
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:01,177
They searched every inch 
of the house and grounds.

311
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:02,135
They found nothing.

312
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,224
What a nightmare.

313
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:08,184
You know, my mom
was the first woman to graduate

314
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:10,752
from Duke University's
School of Engineering.

315
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,146
She was a top executive 
at Nortel Networks.

316
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,843
She was a patron of the arts.

317
00:16:14,886 --> 00:16:16,279
Everyone in town loved her.

318
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:19,021
If she didn't die by accident,
then...

319
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,156
how did she die? Why?

320
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,288
Did your mother
and Michael fight?

321
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,073
No...

322
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:30,163
Not really.

323
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,426
So, what did you do

324
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:33,905
when they finally let you
back in the house?

325
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,083
Caitlin?

326
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,999
What did you do
when the police

327
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,174
finally let you back
in the house?

328
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,568
Okay, I think
this one will look great here.

329
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,135
-It's perfect.
-Ah.

330
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,832
-You got it on the first try.
-Almost.

331
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:33,965
-It's just a little bit crooked.
-Is it?

332
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,490
-Uh-huh.
-Isn't it wonderful?

333
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,882
-I think it looks great.
-I love it.

334
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:39,014
Good job.

335
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,745
It is interesting to note

336
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,834
that over one million people
in the US

337
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,402
have been treated in hospitals
this year alone

338
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:21,100
due to slips on staircases.

339
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,363
Okay, you ready?

340
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,278
And three, two, one.

341
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,160
Hey.

342
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,424
-Hey.
-Brought you some cocoa.

343
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,647
Are you gonna stay in bed
all day?

344
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:49,171
'Til we go to the funeral home.

345
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,218
Honey, uh...

346
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:57,179
those viewings are more
for strangers, not family.

347
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,791
I'd prefer it
if you would stay here with us,

348
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:02,793
so we could have
our own memorial.

349
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,231
You're not going?

350
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,323
Well, I am.

351
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,169
You're coming to the funeral
home with me, right?

352
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:32,388
Dad asked us
to stay home tonight.

353
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,565
You should, too.
He needs us right now.

354
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,094
We know something 
about losing a mother.

355
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,533
Our birth mother died
before I was three.

356
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:50,580
I was barely one,
and our birth father died

357
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,060
just after I was born.

358
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:54,845
So our mother
named Michael guardian.

359
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,370
He's the only...

360
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,903
He's the only father
we've known, really.

361
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,386
His first wife, Patty...

362
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:16,432
she was like a mom to us.

363
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,304
And after the divorce,

364
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:21,394
Kathleen was like another mom.

365
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:24,832
It just didn't feel like 
we could handle

366
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,269
seeing her in a coffin, 
you know?

367
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,966
I don't think 
Caitlin understood that,

368
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,533
or even tried to.

369
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,520
Someone tried
to clean this, but, uh...

370
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:01,782
No one else
should touch this.

371
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,479
I'd like it boarded up
as evidence.

372
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,089
Are you sure about this guy?

373
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,091
He defended
the NFL player, Rae Carruth,

374
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:09,006
-charged with murder.
-Yeah, Carruth's in prison

375
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,356
doing ten years right now.

376
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,227
Not for first-degree
murder, he isn't.

377
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,837
He's serving for other charges.

378
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:16,057
I successfully defended him
on murder and the death penalty

379
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,493
using reasonable doubt.

380
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,757
That's my saving grace,
reasonable doubt?

381
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,370
I will represent you.

382
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,675
You'll need
a vigorous defense at trial.

383
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,590
Trial?

384
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,724
There haven't even been
any charges or indictments.

385
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:32,334
Oh, those will come.

386
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:34,815
You haven't even asked me
if I did it.

387
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,296
I never ask.

388
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:40,211
Well, if you were to ask me,
I'd tell you I was innocent.

389
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:45,086
The Durham police hate you
for what you wrote about them.

390
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:46,696
And you certainly wrote
some very nasty things

391
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,176
about the DA,
Jim Hardin, as well.

392
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,612
That is the good news.

393
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:50,831
And the bad?

394
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:53,399
This.

395
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,060
We believe 
we have a lead

396
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,410
on a possible murder weapon.

397
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,330
It's a blow poke.

398
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:13,984
-A what?
-For the fireplace.

399
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,204
You blow in it,
get air into the fire.

400
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:18,859
It's kind of flimsy,
but it packs a punch.

401
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,775
It's just like the one
Mrs. Peterson's sister gave her.

402
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,343
It was kept by the fireplace,
but it's gone missing.

403
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,519
So, you're saying this is
what killed her

404
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,303
-and that he did it?
-Oh, he's the one.

405
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,044
But can we prove it?

406
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,828
Jim, this is
the same Peterson

407
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,613
who wrote that you only went
after underage voters

408
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:35,223
and bingo players
because you couldn't get

409
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,573
-any real bad guys.
-I know.

410
00:22:37,617 --> 00:22:39,358
Good lord,
imagine if he had become mayor.

411
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,362
Find the blow poke.

412
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,674
Good evening, Mr. Peterson.
We have a warrant.

413
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,373
My family and I are grieving.

414
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,113
Our apologies.

415
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,028
We thought you'd be
at the funeral home right now.

416
00:22:58,072 --> 00:22:59,595
So, you'd just break in?

417
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,815
Well, Mr. Peterson, we've come
to some conclusions--

418
00:23:01,858 --> 00:23:03,512
A conclusion is the place
you get to

419
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:04,644
when you've stopped thinking.

420
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,136
She was a good woman.

421
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,181
Thanks.

422
00:23:21,051 --> 00:23:22,226
I'm so sorry.

423
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:23,619
Thanks.

424
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,579
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

425
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,088
She doesn't seem real.

426
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,657
None of this seems real.

427
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,228
I really don't know
how to feel.

428
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,925
I honestly don't.

429
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:12,102
Come on.

430
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,064
You're gonna have
to pull yourself together.

431
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:18,979
- Mm-hm.
- Okay? You have to.

432
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,547
You're the administrator
of her estate.

433
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,072
Isn't my dad?

434
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,336
No, he's not.

435
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,687
And I've been speaking
with the Durham police.

436
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,517
-I think you should, too.
-Why?

437
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,476
Which way is it?
This room?

438
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,216
Thank you very much.

439
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:10,813
Dad.

440
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:19,909
Mr. Peterson!
Mr. Peterson!

441
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,737
In Durham, 
North Carolina today,

442
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,218
a grand jury has handed down 
a murder indictment

443
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:25,915
against novelist, 
Michael Peterson.

444
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,917
Peterson has been charged

445
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,702
with the death of his wife, 
Kathleen.

446
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,399
...will receive
a fair trial

447
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:32,574
with his negative relationship

448
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:33,967
with the Durham
Police Department?

449
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,143
The DA's case is based

450
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:38,798
on the flimsiest
of circumstantial evidence.

451
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,061
There's no motive.
There's no murder weapon.

452
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,150
There are no witnesses.
And why is that?

453
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,718
Because there was no murder.

454
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,637
I did not kill my wife.

455
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:53,900
I'm innocent.

456
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:57,251
I would never hurt Kathleen.

457
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,776
I whisper her name in my heart
a thousand times.

458
00:26:02,256 --> 00:26:03,649
She's there forever.

459
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,347
And I can't stop crying.

460
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:09,306
Mr. Peterson!
Please, please,

461
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,743
one quick question.

462
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,225
With the best-selling 
author's bail hearing pending,

463
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,836
maybe it's time to take 
a closer look

464
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:18,011
at Michael Peterson.

465
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:21,623
In 1993,
he was charged with a DWI,

466
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,407
Driving While Intoxicated.

467
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,541
Then, there's the mystery of his two Purple Hearts,

468
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,022
something many say 
cost him the mayor's election.

469
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:32,808
Now, he claims to have been 
awarded two Purple Hearts,

470
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,810
but the military 
has no record of them.

471
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,263
I've known Michael 
for 13 years,

472
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:55,091
almost my entire life.

473
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,398
I love him. 
He's my dad.

474
00:26:58,486 --> 00:26:59,792
Why are you going after him?

475
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:03,056
Were you aware
that Michael and your mom

476
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,494
have 142,000
in credit card debt?

477
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,496
-What?
-And that they're spending

478
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,629
$100,000 a year
more than they take in?

479
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,806
There must be some mistake.
My dad's a best-selling author.

480
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:15,546
He bought the house.

481
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,853
He made $600,000--

482
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,855
And he hasn't made a dime since.

483
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,640
What about the Hollywood deal?

484
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,772
They're making a movie
out of his latest book.

485
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:26,035
There is no such deal.
We checked.

486
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:34,304
Look, your mother was stressed
out over money, over her job.

487
00:27:34,348 --> 00:27:35,741
She had to lay off
a lot of people,

488
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:37,090
and she thought
that she was gonna be next.

489
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,658
I had to think of something
to calm her down.

490
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,877
And you figured lying to her
about a Hollywood movie deal

491
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:43,226
would make her feel better?

492
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,967
Have you been talking
to those detectives?

493
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:47,709
They're trying to drive a wedge
between us.

494
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:48,928
You know that, don't you?

495
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,756
When did you stop making money?

496
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,409
What has that
got to do with anything?

497
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:53,846
Just answer the question.

498
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,283
Do you know why
we had money problems?

499
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,373
We send you kids
to the best colleges,

500
00:27:59,416 --> 00:28:00,853
buy you the best cars.

501
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:03,203
Life is very hard, Caitlin.

502
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:05,205
You have no idea
what we've gone through.

503
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,511
Your mother and I
were just trying

504
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,687
to be good parents,

505
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:10,514
trying to make you happy.

506
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:12,734
Is that such a terrible thing?

507
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:15,215
Time's up, Peterson.

508
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:15,998
Let's go.

509
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:28,445
Kathleen Peterson
had both alcohol and Valium

510
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,752
in her system that night,

511
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:33,450
which any reasonable person
might conclude

512
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:34,974
contributed to her fall.

513
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:37,890
But even if it were possible

514
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,327
that her injuries
were not accidental,

515
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,895
the DA and the police
have rushed to judgment,

516
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,897
not even bothering to consider

517
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,377
that an intruder
may have been responsible.

518
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:52,556
Your Honor, the Petersons
had the ideal marriage.

519
00:28:53,514 --> 00:28:55,037
To believe he killed his wife

520
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,910
is to believe
that he went from loving spouse

521
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:00,913
to premeditated murderer
overnight,

522
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:04,960
and that just strains credulity
to the breaking point.

523
00:29:07,397 --> 00:29:09,443
Michael Peterson 
was released today

524
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,924
on an $850,000 bail.

525
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:14,230
After surrendering his passport,

526
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:16,145
Peterson left 
the Durham courthouse,

527
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,931
accompanied by his family, 
and returned to his home

528
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,803
in the exclusive community 
of Forest Hills.

529
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,457
His trial date is set for May.

530
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,026
We love you, Dad.

531
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,286
Kathleen Atwater?

532
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:13,333
Kathleen Atwater.
I'm looking for my mother,

533
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:14,638
Kathleen Atwater.

534
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:21,123
Oh, my God, Mom.
What happened to you?

535
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:23,212
Oh,
I just miscalculated

536
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,823
when I dove into
the swimming pool.

537
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:26,085
You dove in?
You never dive in.

538
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,434
You always wade in.

539
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:30,480
This time I dove.
Never again.

540
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,873
Were you drunk?

541
00:30:33,353 --> 00:30:34,833
Of course not.

542
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,923
Thank you for believing in me.

543
00:31:32,412 --> 00:31:34,283
- Ah, Michael.
- David.

544
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,111
Evening.
This is my investigator,

545
00:31:36,155 --> 00:31:38,157
- Alan Crane.
- Marines, right?

546
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,942
-Semper Fi, do or die.
-I can always tell.

547
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,204
And this is
Erica Azaria.

548
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,945
She's the filmmaker
I told you about.

549
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,816
-Mr. Peterson, a pleasure.
-How do you do?

550
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,080
- Very well, thank you.
- Actually won an award

551
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,516
last year at a festival.
Which one was it?

552
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,822
-It was Divia, actually.
-Oh, well, congratulations.

553
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:53,259
-Thank you.
-So, she'd like to do a film

554
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:56,305
about this case as a study
of the US justice system.

555
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,787
Well, that's going to be
a problem.

556
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,920
-Why?
-Because this case

557
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:04,400
has absolutely
nothing to do with justice.

558
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:08,143
My last film
was on the US penal system.

559
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:09,536
When I read about your case,

560
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:11,190
I thought it would be
a natural companion piece.

561
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,453
Well, now, that depends
on your point of view.

562
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:15,194
Do you think
I'm innocent or guilty?

563
00:32:15,716 --> 00:32:17,544
Innocent, aren't you?

564
00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:20,895
Well, I think a documentary
might be a good idea.

565
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,463
I mean,
camera doesn't lie, right?

566
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:37,346
Hey, would you mind
spotting me?

567
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,739
- Hey, no problem.
- Thanks.

568
00:32:50,707 --> 00:32:52,231
You got it.

569
00:32:52,753 --> 00:32:54,668
So, who is this guy again?

570
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,452
Says he knows a lot
about Peterson.

571
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,279
Uh-huh.

572
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:14,514
Morning.

573
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,431
I'm David Rudolf.

574
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:34,882
This whole case,
it's a diversion.

575
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,363
It's a show.
I'm being victimized here.

576
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,321
Why doesn't the media
focus on--

577
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:42,020
I'll get it.

578
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,503
Could--
could I just start again?

579
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:49,114
-If you please.
-Thank you.

580
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,203
This whole case is a diversion.

581
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,031
It's a show.

582
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:55,033
I'm being victimized here.

583
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:58,079
Why doesn't the media focus
on the city's real problems?

584
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,516
I mean, the DA came
into office

585
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,302
making all sorts of promises,
none of them fulfilled.

586
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:07,045
Corruption, theft, lies.

587
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,569
That is the story of Durham.

588
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:14,139
David!
Hey, listen, we have some...

589
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,097
- Hi, David.
- ...wonderful al dente pasta

590
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,925
and a great pinot noir.
Would you, uh--

591
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,709
Uh, actually, if I could, uh,
just get a--

592
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:22,277
a word with you alone
would probably be best.

593
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:24,366
- Uh--
- Truly alone.

594
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,067
But David, we--
we did promise total access.

595
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,894
-I-- I--
-Of course we did.

596
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:33,288
Then, could we step
in the other room?

597
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:34,115
-Sorry to interrupt, really.
-Oh, sure.

598
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:39,599
Thanks.

599
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,304
So, what's up?

600
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:53,178
Well, you failed to mention
to me that you're gay.

601
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:56,616
I'm not.

602
00:34:57,834 --> 00:34:59,009
Had a meeting with a man
who said last year

603
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,054
the two of you were lovers.

604
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,318
Lovers?
Come on, who is this man?

605
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,192
Can you give us a minute?
Seriously.

606
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:09,281
No, no, that's all right.

607
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,239
Stay. I--
I've got nothing to hide.

608
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:14,808
Okay. Aside from that man,

609
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:18,159
the DA was kind enough
to give me these photos

610
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:21,380
that were found
on your computer.

611
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,773
Uh, how could you not be gay,

612
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,341
uh, and have relationships
with men?

613
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:28,082
I don't have relationships
with men.

614
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:30,389
I have sex with them.
There's a difference.

615
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,348
Besides semantics,
there's a difference?

616
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:35,655
I'm bisexual, David.

617
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,613
It has nothing to do
with the case.

618
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:41,139
-No, no, you are the case.
-But my sexuality isn't.

619
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,142
I stood in front of a judge

620
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,621
and talked about
this great marriage you had.

621
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:46,405
It was.

622
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,364
Kathleen knew about me.
She did.

623
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,192
She understood me.

624
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,847
It wasn't about
my not loving her, or--

625
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,154
or loving her any less;
I loved her more because of it.

626
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,243
We had a passionate life
together.

627
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,160
Okay. Well, that's helpful.

628
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,686
I'm just afraid
that this being the South,

629
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,254
your being bisexual
is going to damage the case.

630
00:36:12,953 --> 00:36:14,084
So, what do we do?

631
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:17,653
Well, the DA is gonna have
a field day with this,

632
00:36:17,697 --> 00:36:20,265
so we're gonna have to do
exactly what you're doing now,

633
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:22,354
which is to be upfront about it,
shrug it off,

634
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,356
treat it as inconsequential.

635
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:28,447
But I need to know that
you're telling me everything.

636
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,449
David,
I'm telling you everything.

637
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,973
As I said, I have nothing
to hide.

638
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,193
Okay.

639
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,721
Have you told your family?

640
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,291
I think that's enough
for tonight. Thank you, Erica.

641
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:47,683
Okay.

642
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,213
So, it's--
it's really not that unusual.

643
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:57,519
In ancient Rome,

644
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,347
sex between soldiers
was encouraged

645
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,219
to ensure battlefield loyalty.

646
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,091
And the Greeks
had a belief that--

647
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:07,225
Stop it!
You're embarrassing yourself.

648
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:12,534
Were you having an affair?

649
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:17,409
No, Caitlin,
I was not having an affair.

650
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,026
No, no, it's okay.

651
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,289
She just needs some time.

652
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:38,256
Let's talk about your 
brother's sexuality, shall we?

653
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:40,301
And why is that such a big deal?

654
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:43,913
I knew about it.
So did our parents.

655
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:47,482
Uh, when Michael was a teenager
he told us.

656
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:51,269
This case isn't about that,
okay?

657
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,675
Honey, goodness.

658
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,591
He's a liar.

659
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:14,335
He's manipulative,
and he's promiscuous.

660
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,599
The police showed me
those emails.

661
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:19,166
What emails?

662
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,603
The ones that he tried to get
rid of the night she died.

663
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:26,826
Emails to and from all the boys
that he meets at the gym.

664
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:29,307
That's why he spends
so much time there.

665
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,963
I know what happened that night.

666
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,719
I know my sister would 
never have tolerated

667
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:52,721
such a thing in her marriage. 
Never.

668
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,769
She confronted him. 
They argued.

669
00:38:58,684 --> 00:38:59,598
And he killed her.

670
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,384
Uh, I'm not sure. I just--

671
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:08,737
I don't see him as a murderer.
I'm sorry, I don't.

672
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:15,744
Are you sure?

673
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,139
Yes, she needs to see it.

674
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,232
Autopsy report
and photos.

675
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:47,080
God.

676
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,648
Oh, my God.

677
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,302
How can that be from a fall?

678
00:39:52,607 --> 00:39:53,565
It could--

679
00:39:55,044 --> 00:39:56,263
It can't.

680
00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:00,180
It can't. Oh, God.

681
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,415
There's someone here to see you.

682
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:27,729
Don't you think you need to be
with your family right now?

683
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,036
Aunt Candace is family.

684
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:32,038
You know what I mean.

685
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:35,911
Can you leave us alone
for a second?

686
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,226
Caitlin, Dad needs us with him
right now.

687
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,620
He really needs our support.

688
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:50,622
I need some time on my own.

689
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:53,538
Fine. Whatever you need.

690
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:55,931
Just make sure and be

691
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,150
at the house tomorrow
for a TV interview.

692
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,109
A TV interview?

693
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,721
I don't think so.

694
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,505
Caitlin, what--
what's gotten into you?

695
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:05,550
Nothing.

696
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,465
He's making a movie
about all this.

697
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:08,770
Isn't that kind of weird?

698
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:11,381
He's telling his secrets
to the whole world.

699
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,992
Don't tell me
you're homophobic, Caitlin.

700
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,908
No! But don't tell me
that you haven't wondered

701
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:18,171
for just one second if,
you know, he actually did it.

702
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,738
Caitlin, don't do this.

703
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,566
We're a family.

704
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:23,916
We need a common front here.

705
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:27,354
There can be no desertions,
Caitlin. This is war.

706
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:31,489
Do you ever actually listen
to yourself?

707
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,811
So, all five of
you kids stand by your father?

708
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,510
Absolutely, we're a family.

709
00:41:52,727 --> 00:41:55,034
And we're gonna get through this
as a family.

710
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,166
And how's your dad holding up
through all of this?

711
00:41:57,689 --> 00:41:59,168
He's good.

712
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:00,779
He's obviously having a tough 
time with this,

713
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:03,085
as are all of us, but he's doing the best he can.

714
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:05,523
Clayton has his girlfriend
with him to make it seem

715
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:06,959
like we're all there
supporting Dad.

716
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:10,179
- God.
- This is so Michael.

717
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:11,354
...without a doubt...

718
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:12,747
And then there's this.

719
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,099
Todd's the family
spokesperson now.

720
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:18,710
He said that you were
too distraught

721
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:20,581
to participate in the interview.

722
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,803
...all very, very tight 
and supportive of one another.

723
00:42:29,764 --> 00:42:31,636
What do you want
to know about Michael Peterson?

724
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:43,561
Hi.

725
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:45,563
Is your aunt here?

726
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,000
No, but she'll be back
any minute.

727
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:50,655
May I come in?

728
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,050
Wow...

729
00:42:57,226 --> 00:42:59,054
the police have destroyed
my family.

730
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,447
It's always about you, isn't it?

731
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,404
No, it isn't, Caitlin.

732
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,060
I've always loved you
as if you were my own child.

733
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,497
And after the hell
you went through

734
00:43:07,541 --> 00:43:08,803
with your parents' divorce,
I was the--

735
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:11,197
There's no cameras around.
You can stop acting.

736
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,241
What do you want?

737
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,118
The estate attorney
sent me these.

738
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:23,035
And it's a bill
for funeral expenses, and....

739
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,907
I can't afford it, Caitlin.

740
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:28,997
And I never wanted a burial.
I always wanted cremation.

741
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:30,912
So did your mom.

742
00:43:30,956 --> 00:43:32,435
And we didn't pick
that cemetery.

743
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,045
You and your aunt did.

744
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:35,613
And this is a bill
from a florist.

745
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:38,093
It's-- It's $800 charged
to my credit card,

746
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,095
without my approval.

747
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,880
Are you aware
she never signed

748
00:43:41,923 --> 00:43:43,490
the beneficiary designation?

749
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:47,537
Her life insurance,
the 1.4 million.

750
00:43:48,147 --> 00:43:50,845
The papers designating you
as sole beneficiary?

751
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,281
They were filled out,

752
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:53,979
but she never
actually signed them.

753
00:43:54,327 --> 00:43:56,155
That means no matter
what happens in court,

754
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:57,156
you get nothing.

755
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,899
Why are you doing this to me?

756
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,199
I'd hate to be
running right now.

757
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:44,682
- Hey.
- I'll see you guys later, okay?

758
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,294
Hey,
how are you doing?

759
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,730
-Doing okay?
-What do you want?

760
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,298
I wanted to talk to you.
Look, I don't know

761
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,169
if anyone showed you
the autopsy reports

762
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,867
-or Mom's photos--
-Dad told us not to bother.

763
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,695
He says what's in the report
isn't true.

764
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:00,567
Look, she has over 38 injuries.

765
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,960
Thirty eight, Margaret.

766
00:45:02,003 --> 00:45:04,353
To her head, face, hands,
back, and wrists.

767
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:05,398
How do you get all that

768
00:45:07,052 --> 00:45:08,183
-from falling down the stairs?
-Will you put that away please?

769
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:09,097
We all knew
that Michael had a temper.

770
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:10,403
Dad says he'll be exonerated.

771
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,100
You're on the wrong side,
Caitlin.

772
00:45:12,144 --> 00:45:14,189
-I didn't know there were sides.
-There are.

773
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,018
We were a family,
but you walked out on us.

774
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:19,586
-Margaret, can't you see?
-Yeah, I can see.

775
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:22,328
And what I see
is you being brainwashed

776
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:23,721
by a bunch of corrupt cops.

777
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:25,897
You know what Dad calls
those cops in Durham?

778
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:27,115
Idiots.

779
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,161
And you know what he calls you?

780
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,729
A traitor, a hypocrite.

781
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:33,948
And we all feel same the way.

782
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:35,907
Shame on you, Caitlin.

783
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:37,735
Shame on you.

784
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:44,567
- Morning.
- Morning.

785
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:48,615
Hi, I'm Laura Baxter,
and I'm a jury consultant.

786
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:50,182
And you're my mock jury.

787
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:53,576
Now today,
I'm going to be presenting you

788
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:57,189
various facts and perspectives
on the Michael Peterson case.

789
00:45:57,493 --> 00:46:01,106
And all I ask is that
you respond as frankly

790
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,151
and as honestly as possible.

791
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,632
Well, I don't think that, uh...

792
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,765
One guy hates
that Peterson's a vet

793
00:46:07,808 --> 00:46:09,288
who lied about receiving
a Purple Heart.

794
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,944
Another says that being a liar
doesn't make you a murderer.

795
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:14,815
-Uh-huh.
-And half the women believe

796
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:16,774
that just because
you get caught cheating

797
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:17,644
doesn't mean you're a killer.

798
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:19,167
What about cheating
with another man?

799
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,651
That guy there said he'd kill
to cover a secret like that.

800
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,784
So what does all this
add up to?

801
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,308
Lack of consensus.

802
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:31,484
-It's a gift.
-Hmm.

803
00:46:33,225 --> 00:46:35,270
So, Michael's lying.
When did that start?

804
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,665
Look,

805
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,667
I'm just trying to paint
a complete portrait

806
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:41,929
of your brother,
and that is part of it.

807
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:43,365
Well, try painting this.

808
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:46,847
Eighteen years ago,
he took on the responsibility

809
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,067
of raising the two girls
of a friend who passed away.

810
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:50,503
Who was their mother?

811
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,026
Elizabeth Ratliff,

812
00:46:53,375 --> 00:46:55,160
a friend when Mike and Patty
lived in Germany.

813
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,205
She died of
a cerebral hemorrhage

814
00:46:57,249 --> 00:46:58,859
and entrusted her kids
to my brother.

815
00:47:00,034 --> 00:47:01,819
How many men that would do
such a thing?

816
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,692
No witness,
no murder weapon,

817
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:06,998
maybe not even a motive.

818
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:08,608
What we do have

819
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,262
- is reasonable doubt.
- Mm-hm.

820
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,264
And I'm sure David Rudolf
must love that.

821
00:47:12,917 --> 00:47:14,179
Excuse me.

822
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,050
I-- I think your receptionist
went to lunch.

823
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:19,749
May I talk to you?
You're Mr. Hardin, right?

824
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:21,316
-Yes, ma'am.
-Miss Black?

825
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,448
That's right. And you are?

826
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:25,103
Margaret Blair
from Rhode Island.

827
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:27,366
Elizabeth Ratliff's sister.

828
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:28,933
Margaret and Martha's aunt.

829
00:47:28,976 --> 00:47:31,718
Yes, of course.
Please, have a seat.

830
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:34,677
Excuse the mess, Ma'am.

831
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:36,375
What-- What can I do for you,
Mrs. Blair?

832
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:38,725
Well, whenever Michael
or the girls

833
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,118
mentions my sister's death,

834
00:47:40,553 --> 00:47:42,381
they say she died
of cerebral hemorrhage.

835
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:44,383
Well, didn't she?

836
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:47,952
Maybe, but they never say
where her body was found.

837
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,388
And where was that?

838
00:47:50,824 --> 00:47:53,087
My sister was found dead
at the bottom of a staircase.

839
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:57,526
And the last person
to see her alive was Michael.

840
00:47:59,615 --> 00:48:01,704
Oh, he called and said
all the right things.

841
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:03,445
He was sorry for my loss.

842
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:06,884
He said she fell and that
there was very little blood,

843
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:08,450
just a little behind the ear.

844
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:11,671
-That wasn't true.
-How do you know that?

845
00:48:12,019 --> 00:48:14,413
I got a photo
from the German police.

846
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,727
And you didn't ask why?

847
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:25,946
Of course I did.

848
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:28,644
They said
it was an accidental death,

849
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:30,124
that the case was closed.

850
00:48:30,385 --> 00:48:31,909
An accident.

851
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:36,304
Hmm.

852
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:38,828
Good Lord almighty.

853
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,935
"Invitation to the Dance."

854
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:02,330
Kathleen loved this piece.

855
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:11,861
David!

856
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:14,168
You know the doorbell
does work.

857
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:16,388
Forgive me
for allowing myself in.

858
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,303
Erica, can you guys
take a dinner break, please?

859
00:49:18,607 --> 00:49:20,827
There something about the case
you don't want us to hear?

860
00:49:21,088 --> 00:49:23,134
I need to speak with Michael
privately,

861
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,092
and I would greatly appreciate
if, for once,

862
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:27,486
you would respect that.
Thank you.

863
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:29,227
All right, let's cut.

864
00:49:32,056 --> 00:49:33,361
Anything else
you haven't told me?

865
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:34,362
I beg your pardon?

866
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,150
Your wife is found dead
at the bottom of this staircase.

867
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:40,890
Your friend, Elizabeth Ratliff,
is found dead

868
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:42,109
at the bottom of that one.

869
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:44,590
You think the DA might find that
just a tad peculiar?

870
00:49:51,162 --> 00:49:53,294
I did not kill Elizabeth.

871
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:55,166
Convince me.

872
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,910
In the early 1980s

873
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:03,826
my first wife, Patty, and I 
were living near Frankfurt.

874
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,003
She was teaching 
at the US base there,

875
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:07,743
and I was writing 
my first novel.

876
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:10,268
George and Elizabeth Ratliff 
were neighbors.

877
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,226
He was in the Air Force.

878
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,402
They had two baby girls, 
Margaret and Martha.

879
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:17,231
George was being shipped out 
to Grenada

880
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,494
for the US invasion, 
and we were worried.

881
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:22,193
I was trying to get him 
to request a leave,

882
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,455
you know, 
having just had a baby,

883
00:50:23,498 --> 00:50:25,022
but that wasn't George.

884
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:27,285
He said if anything 
happened to him,

885
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:29,678
Liz and the girls would be well taken care of.

886
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:31,289
That was George.

887
00:50:31,332 --> 00:50:33,378
He always said that God 
is in the details.

888
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:35,510
George died in Grenada.

889
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:37,425
He died 
of a heart attack,

890
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:39,514
and there were traces
of cyanide found in his blood.

891
00:50:39,558 --> 00:50:40,994
I know.

892
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,344
He had a heart condition
for which he took medication,

893
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:45,477
-and there was speculation--
-That someone tampered

894
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,609
with his medicine
before he left for his mission.

895
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:49,742
The operative word
being speculation.

896
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,136
Were you and George having sex?

897
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:53,789
No.

898
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,443
What about you
and Elizabeth?

899
00:50:55,835 --> 00:50:56,705
No.

900
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,056
So, the night she died...

901
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,710
That was two years later.

902
00:51:01,754 --> 00:51:04,496
It was in November. There'd been an early snowfall,

903
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,541
and Elizabeth had dinner 
with Patty and me.

904
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,847
And then I walked her home.

905
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:09,979
- Did you go inside?
- No.

906
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:12,895
- You're sure?
- I walked her home,

907
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:13,940
and then I went back 
to my house.

908
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:16,856
The next morning, Patty was
making breakfast for the boys.

909
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:19,511
I'd been up late writing,

910
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:23,036
and that's when Elizabeth's 
nanny rushed in, hysterical.

911
00:51:23,689 --> 00:51:25,604
She was crying so much 
that it was hard to understand

912
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:26,866
a word she was saying.

913
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:29,521
She'd found Elizabeth 
on the staircase.

914
00:51:31,827 --> 00:51:33,612
- Did you love her?
- Yes,

915
00:51:34,308 --> 00:51:36,005
but not in the way
that you think.

916
00:51:38,356 --> 00:51:40,009
We were soul mates.

917
00:51:40,053 --> 00:51:41,359
How'd your wife
feel about that?

918
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:42,838
-Patty?
-Yes.

919
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:47,278
Patty was a sensible woman.
And Elizabeth was not sensible.

920
00:51:47,321 --> 00:51:49,106
That's what I liked about her.
She was just, uh...

921
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:51,717
a great person.

922
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:55,024
But she was having these
terrible headaches.

923
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:57,114
And I tried to get her
to go see a doctor.

924
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:01,335
But she just dismissed it
as stress-related.

925
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,121
I wish that I'd insisted.

926
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:06,558
She had a cerebral hemorrhage.

927
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:09,952
But all that blood
on the staircase.

928
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:11,606
Yes, she had a condition

929
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,608
that was called
Willebrand's disease.

930
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,610
It's not unlike hemophilia.

931
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:18,744
Okay.

932
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,355
Thank you.

933
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,750
I guess I'll be going
to Germany.

934
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,232
Well, there's a vote
of confidence.

935
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:31,583
Both the German and the US
military autopsy reports

936
00:52:31,626 --> 00:52:33,367
back up everything
I just told you.

937
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:36,414
I did not kill
Elizabeth Ratliff.

938
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:39,373
And if I'm going
to convince a jury of that,

939
00:52:39,417 --> 00:52:42,550
-I'll need to go to Germany.
-Well, then I'm going with you.

940
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:44,422
They took away your passport.
No. You're not.

941
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:46,554
Well, then, I'll send Clayton.

942
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,382
I'm not gonna have Patty
dealing with this on her own.

943
00:53:04,006 --> 00:53:05,269
Let's jump over here.

944
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,841
David Rudolf,
Alan Crane,

945
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:15,409
-this is my mother, Patricia.
-Nice to meet you.

946
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:17,542
Hi, it's Patty.
Welcome to Germany.

947
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,500
Hello. I'm Erica Azaria.

948
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:20,936
Just pretend we're not here
and try not to look

949
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,199
-at the camera.
-Oh, okay.

950
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:25,419
Um, I just baked some cookies.
Want some?

951
00:53:25,463 --> 00:53:26,377
-Uh...
-Mrs. Peterson,

952
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:27,943
-we can't hear you.
-Patty.

953
00:53:27,987 --> 00:53:29,206
Mm, let me just...

954
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:31,599
There, and remember,
please don't look at the camera.

955
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:34,646
Oh, okay.
Um, I'll start again.

956
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:37,126
Um, I just baked cookies.
Want some?

957
00:53:37,344 --> 00:53:38,824
Actually, if we could just see
the home Elizabeth

958
00:53:38,867 --> 00:53:40,913
-was living in.
-Oh, of course.

959
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:42,436
Uh, the woman who lived there
gave me the keys

960
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,437
so we can take as much time
as we like.

961
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:44,656
Okay, thank you.

962
00:53:52,054 --> 00:53:53,012
So...

963
00:53:53,882 --> 00:53:55,014
this...

964
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:57,234
is how we found her.

965
00:53:58,583 --> 00:53:59,627
Like this.

966
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:01,890
And most of the blood was...

967
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:04,241
Oh, there wasn't any blood.

968
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:10,290
You still love Michael?

969
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:13,902
He's the father of my sons.

970
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:17,123
You don't just
stop loving someone.

971
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:19,647
Did you know he was bisexual?

972
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:25,827
Are you sure you wouldn't like
another cookie?

973
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:26,741
I'm sure.

974
00:54:27,612 --> 00:54:29,091
Was he involved with Elizabeth?

975
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:30,745
No.

976
00:54:31,616 --> 00:54:34,488
He was like a brother to her.

977
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,534
Was he having sex with George?

978
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,491
No.

979
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:42,888
Do you think he had anything
to do with George's death?

980
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,194
Aren't you supposed to be
defending my father?

981
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,983
Why did you and Michael leave
Germany and return to the US?

982
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,550
It was his idea.

983
00:54:53,202 --> 00:54:56,031
We had Elizabeth's girls
and our sons,

984
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:58,817
and he felt it would be easier
to raise them in Durham.

985
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:03,517
'Course that's where Michael
met Kathleen.

986
00:55:03,561 --> 00:55:05,040
Yet you still love him?

987
00:55:05,432 --> 00:55:06,912
Would you lie for him
to get him back?

988
00:55:07,173 --> 00:55:08,174
No.

989
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,177
How much did Michael get
from Elizabeth's estate?

990
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:12,613
It wasn't much.

991
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:15,312
That money was for the girls.

992
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:19,490
Maybe 30, 40 grand.

993
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:21,796
That's all?

994
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,233
Mm-hm. Yeah.

995
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,370
...and 
48 degrees here in Durham.

996
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:33,330
It's eight o'clock, 
and here's our top story.

997
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,071
Citibank 
has filed a claim against

998
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:38,770
Kathleen Peterson's estate 
for credit card debt.

999
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:42,295
The amount is reported to be 
over $100,000.

1000
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,732
Husband, Michael Peterson, 
is awaiting trial

1001
00:55:44,776 --> 00:55:45,820
on the alleged murder.

1002
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,030
Since I'm paying for this,

1003
00:56:22,074 --> 00:56:23,684
I didn't think you'd mind
my waiting here.

1004
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,034
You didn't pay for this.
Never did.

1005
00:56:28,036 --> 00:56:29,298
My mother paid for this.

1006
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,083
Honey, this...

1007
00:56:32,563 --> 00:56:34,608
airing of your mother's
financial dirty laundry is...

1008
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:36,393
It's inappropriate.

1009
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:38,830
Actually,
it's your dirty laundry.

1010
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,399
I'll tell you what.

1011
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:45,706
You settle this thing
with Citibank,

1012
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,406
and I won't go to the police
to report $100,000

1013
00:56:49,449 --> 00:56:51,233
worth of jewelry
and clothing missing

1014
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:52,931
from Kathleen's closet, okay?

1015
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:55,847
I've already filed the papers
with the estate.

1016
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:58,893
There's nothing missing
except for my mother.

1017
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,417
And I don't really think
that you're

1018
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,374
gonna go to the Durham cops

1019
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,289
that you have been calling
a bunch of idiots.

1020
00:57:04,116 --> 00:57:05,247
Caitlin, I'm your father.

1021
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,119
No, Michael, you are not.

1022
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:17,434
Aunt Candace?

1023
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,699
Can you give me the number
to that lawyer?

1024
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:26,530
When I learned about Caitlin's

1025
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:29,358
wrongful death lawsuit
against me, my reaction...

1026
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:32,144
was a broken heart.

1027
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:34,668
The police have chosen...

1028
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:38,498
to provide Caitlin
with only part of the evidence,

1029
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,110
which has resulted
in this precipitous action.

1030
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:45,070
I feel sorry for Caitlin's pain,

1031
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:47,768
for the loss of her mother.

1032
00:57:50,118 --> 00:57:53,078
But I also feel sorry
for my other children, who--

1033
00:57:54,514 --> 00:57:56,124
having lost their mother...

1034
00:57:58,213 --> 00:57:59,693
have now lost a sister as well.

1035
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:05,177
"See what the scourge 
is laid upon your hate,

1036
00:58:06,004 --> 00:58:09,094
that Heaven finds means
to kill your joys with love.

1037
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,401
And I, for winking
at your discords, too,

1038
00:58:12,445 --> 00:58:14,534
have lost a brace of kinsman.

1039
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,319
All are punish'd.

1040
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,760
All are punish'd."

1041
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:33,553
I am sorry that you've 
come all this way,

1042
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:36,904
but as I tell Mr. Rudolf,
we stand by our report.

1043
00:58:36,948 --> 00:58:39,777
Mrs. Ratliff died
of accidental death.

1044
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,562
Well, we feel that we can prove
that her death was a homicide,

1045
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:43,694
and a judge will allow it
at trial.

1046
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:45,783
Under 404B, which covers
providing proof

1047
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:48,133
-of a similar crime.
-Or revealing a pattern

1048
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:50,048
of criminal behavior,
uh, of murder.

1049
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:53,704
Yeah, I understand,
but this was not a homicide.

1050
00:58:53,747 --> 00:58:57,446
Perhaps, if her remains
indicate otherwise,

1051
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:01,146
-we could reopen this file.
-Her remains?

1052
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:04,192
Her body's been buried
in the ground for 18 years.

1053
00:59:04,236 --> 00:59:05,324
Precisely.

1054
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:07,892
-Good night.
-Good night.

1055
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:12,026
Another dead body
has surfaced in Peterson's life.

1056
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:15,160
Another woman lied dead
at the foot of the stairs,

1057
00:59:15,203 --> 00:59:17,641
that being Elizabeth Ratliff
over one decade ago.

1058
00:59:20,818 --> 00:59:22,297
I just couldn't believe it

1059
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:23,951
when Dad sat us down 
and told us.

1060
00:59:24,996 --> 00:59:26,780
It just seemed so wrong,
you know,

1061
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:28,913
exhuming our mother's remains.

1062
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:33,482
Dad's lawyer said
that if a new autopsy proves

1063
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:36,181
she died of natural causes, 
it'll help exonerate him.

1064
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,488
They had to get our permission.

1065
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:43,449
I just didn't think it'd have
such an impact on us, you know?

1066
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,766
What if the DA offered you
a plea?

1067
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:57,855
Would you take it?

1068
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:00,988
Put an end to this
for the family, for yourself.

1069
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:04,601
Michael, I'm scared for you.

1070
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,605
I don't wanna end up in prison.

1071
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:14,045
What happened with Elizabeth?

1072
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,917
You told her sister, me,
all of us,

1073
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:18,745
there was just a bit
of blood behind her ear.

1074
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:20,094
Why'd you lie?

1075
01:00:20,138 --> 01:00:21,356
What would you've
preferred I said?

1076
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,532
That she was found dead
in a pool of blood,

1077
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:25,926
twisted around like a--
like a damned pretzel?

1078
01:00:26,187 --> 01:00:28,102
Well, what are they gonna find
when they open that coffin?

1079
01:00:28,146 --> 01:00:29,713
What do you think?

1080
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:31,323
She's been in the ground
for 18 years.

1081
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:32,890
All they'll find
is a bunch of bones.

1082
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,496
How were we to know a body

1083
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,542
could be that well preserved 
after that much time?

1084
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:18,762
It scared the hell out of me.

1085
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:21,547
Aren't you concerned
about what they might find

1086
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,679
in the autopsy?

1087
01:01:23,331 --> 01:01:25,551
No. Not at all.

1088
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:27,988
Do you play poker,
Mr. Rudolf?

1089
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,340
Because I do believe some people
would call that a poker face.

1090
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:41,741
Contusions to the left hand,
left forearm.

1091
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,091
Defensive wounds?

1092
01:01:44,135 --> 01:01:46,311
Huh, yeah.

1093
01:01:46,354 --> 01:01:47,181
Maybe.

1094
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:57,757
Linear fracture
at the base of the skull,

1095
01:01:57,801 --> 01:01:59,324
lacerations.

1096
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:01,805
Let's look at the brain.

1097
01:02:16,602 --> 01:02:18,604
- Hi, Patty.
- Hey.

1098
01:02:18,647 --> 01:02:20,171
Oh, thank you so much.

1099
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,131
You didn't have to send
a limo to the airport.

1100
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:26,394
-I could've taken a bus.
-Don't be silly.

1101
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:28,396
You're the mother of my boys.

1102
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,138
It just means so much for me
to have you here.

1103
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:32,749
Mm, I'm just glad I could help.

1104
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,754
Please, don't look
at the camera, Mrs. Peterson.

1105
01:02:55,423 --> 01:02:58,209
Do you really expect a jury
to be swayed by this...

1106
01:02:59,036 --> 01:03:02,474
cartoon of Kathleen
falling down the stairs?

1107
01:03:02,517 --> 01:03:03,997
-Judas Priest!
-Calm down, Michael.

1108
01:03:04,041 --> 01:03:05,477
No, I won't calm down.

1109
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,566
I mean, how much is this thing
going to cost me?

1110
01:03:08,045 --> 01:03:09,873
As much as that--
that mock trial?

1111
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,613
Really?

1112
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:13,572
I mean,
what am I spending on this?

1113
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,445
To go to trial, conservatively,
it will cost you about $800,000.

1114
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,535
Well,
you wanted to know

1115
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:22,711
what the United States system
of justice is about.

1116
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:25,236
Well, this is what it's about.
It's about money.

1117
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:27,194
I mean, we wouldn't even be
going to trial

1118
01:03:27,238 --> 01:03:29,196
if it weren't
for Caitlin and Candace.

1119
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,416
-Michael!
-I don't care. Let 'em hear it.

1120
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,026
I don't care!

1121
01:03:34,506 --> 01:03:36,856
Michael, this animation
was created

1122
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,250
by a biomechanics specialist.

1123
01:03:39,293 --> 01:03:43,297
It accurately reflects what
we say happened on the stairway.

1124
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:46,474
Well, that may all be
very well and good, David,

1125
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:49,434
but it-- it has no emotion.

1126
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:50,348
None!

1127
01:03:51,305 --> 01:03:52,002
He's right, David.

1128
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,744
Okay, fine.

1129
01:03:58,617 --> 01:03:59,966
You want me to put
you on the stand?

1130
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:00,924
Is that what this is about?

1131
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,144
It's your call, your right.

1132
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:09,019
But what if the DA
somehow gets you

1133
01:04:09,062 --> 01:04:12,370
to lose your temper,
or goes off on some tangent

1134
01:04:12,413 --> 01:04:14,154
about your bisexuality,

1135
01:04:14,198 --> 01:04:18,071
or asks you under oath
to outline your distinctions

1136
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:20,682
between sex and love?
What happens then?

1137
01:04:20,726 --> 01:04:21,858
Does that help our case?

1138
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:27,385
Please understand,
your life is not in my hands.

1139
01:04:27,428 --> 01:04:29,082
It's in the hands
of the 12 good citizens

1140
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:31,563
of Durham, North Carolina.
They decide.

1141
01:04:32,042 --> 01:04:35,045
So, you need to decide
one of two things.

1142
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:38,918
Either trust me to do my job,
or hire someone else.

1143
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,354
And please, if you do,

1144
01:04:41,181 --> 01:04:43,357
trust them to do their job.

1145
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,064
I am ruling the death
of Elizabeth Ratliff

1146
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:55,543
a homicidal assault.

1147
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,808
As you can see, the scalp shows
lacerations similar

1148
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:02,246
to the ones suffered
by Kathleen Peterson.

1149
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:04,204
Clearly, ladies and gentlemen,

1150
01:05:04,248 --> 01:05:06,119
there were 
two murders committed.

1151
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:08,208
- Any questions?
- Would you issue

1152
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:09,601
a coroner's report?

1153
01:05:09,644 --> 01:05:11,385
What tipped you off 
about...

1154
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:14,736
And now the specter 
has risen that a Germany case

1155
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,782
will be reopened as to the death

1156
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:18,827
of Michael Peterson's 
family friend,

1157
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:20,917
Elizabeth Ratliff, 
over one decade ago.

1158
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:33,364
Mr. Peterson!
Mr. Peterson!

1159
01:05:36,715 --> 01:05:38,456
Mr. Peterson!
Mr. Peterson!

1160
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:45,419
Hey, Caitlin! Caitlin!

1161
01:05:48,074 --> 01:05:49,249
Do you have a statement for us,
Caitlin?

1162
01:05:50,511 --> 01:05:51,948
I can respect that people have

1163
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:53,732
their own belief
as to what happened.

1164
01:05:54,254 --> 01:05:56,039
But I have faith in the evidence

1165
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:57,562
that will convict Michael
Peterson.

1166
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:30,421
Good morning to each of you.

1167
01:06:30,464 --> 01:06:31,248
Good morning.

1168
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:34,686
This was Kathleen Peterson,

1169
01:06:35,426 --> 01:06:37,906
full of life, beautiful.

1170
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:41,301
We're told she and her husband
had an ideal marriage.

1171
01:06:41,954 --> 01:06:44,000
But, ladies and gentlemen,

1172
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:48,656
this case is all about pretense
and appearances.

1173
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:51,050
Now, the defense says
what happened to her

1174
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:52,095
was an accident.

1175
01:06:52,747 --> 01:06:54,184
We say its murder,

1176
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,710
at the hands of Michael Peterson
with this.

1177
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:02,018
It's called a blow poke.

1178
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,022
And this is an exact replica
of the murder weapon.

1179
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:09,025
Kathleen kept it next
to the fireplace.

1180
01:07:09,721 --> 01:07:11,331
But it mysteriously disappeared.

1181
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:14,856
Now, this...

1182
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:20,688
This is the Kathleen Peterson
the EMT unit found

1183
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:24,910
when they arrived at her home
on December 9th, 2001.

1184
01:07:26,607 --> 01:07:28,261
Accident or murder?

1185
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:31,090
You decide.

1186
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:36,313
And when you arrived
at the Peterson home that night,

1187
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:38,576
what was one of the first things
you noticed?

1188
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:40,752
Apart from the fact that the
body was in perfect alignment?

1189
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,623
Yes, apart from that.

1190
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:44,103
Well, I noticed that some

1191
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:45,496
of the blood on the stairs

1192
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,672
- had already dried.
- Already dried?

1193
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,543
How peculiar.

1194
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:52,633
And, uh, what did that
suggest to you, Detective?

1195
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,332
It suggested that the victim
had died much earlier

1196
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,029
and that the scene
had been staged.

1197
01:07:57,334 --> 01:07:58,596
Please explain
what you mean by staged.

1198
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:30,149
Durham 911, 
where's your emergency?

1199
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,108
1810 Cedar, please.

1200
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:33,500
What's wrong, sir?

1201
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,154
My wife's had an accident.
She's still breathing!

1202
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,590
What kind of accident?

1203
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:38,810
She fell down the stairs.
She's still breathing!

1204
01:08:43,597 --> 01:08:45,208
On the night
you arrived at his home,

1205
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,253
were you aware that this was
the same Michael Peterson

1206
01:08:47,297 --> 01:08:49,342
that had written
newspaper columns

1207
01:08:49,386 --> 01:08:51,562
-critical of the police force?
-Yes.

1208
01:08:51,866 --> 01:08:54,347
Well, they were more
than critical, weren't they?

1209
01:08:55,566 --> 01:08:57,437
Let me see if I can-- Ah!

1210
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:01,833
"It would not be an exaggeration
to call our police force

1211
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:04,531
a laughing stock for they solve

1212
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:07,969
a mere five percent
of reported crimes."

1213
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:09,667
-Do you remember that one?
-Yes.

1214
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:13,540
So, is it fair that there may
have been some police bias

1215
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:14,802
towards Mr. Peterson?

1216
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:16,674
You could put it that way.

1217
01:09:16,717 --> 01:09:19,155
Could you also put it
that you and other officers

1218
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:21,592
conspired to exact revenge
on Mr. Peterson

1219
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:23,507
-the night his wife died?
-Objection.

1220
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,551
Sustained.

1221
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:26,336
Moving on.

1222
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:29,600
You and the DA contend that

1223
01:09:29,904 --> 01:09:32,298
the defendant murdered
his wife using, uh,

1224
01:09:32,342 --> 01:09:34,213
what did you call it,
a blow poke?

1225
01:09:34,257 --> 01:09:35,388
Yes.

1226
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:39,479
And after exhaustive
searching of his home

1227
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:41,220
and the entire property,

1228
01:09:41,264 --> 01:09:44,049
were you ever able to find
this alleged murder weapon?

1229
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:46,791
- No.
- No?

1230
01:09:48,749 --> 01:09:52,013
No murder weapon?
Not anywhere?

1231
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:55,669
Could it be
that there was no murder?

1232
01:09:55,713 --> 01:09:57,105
Objection.

1233
01:09:57,584 --> 01:09:58,629
Withdrawn.

1234
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:04,025
I have a letter
you wrote a while back

1235
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:07,246
in which you referred
to your sister's relationship

1236
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:09,248
with her husband,
Michael Peterson,

1237
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:11,381
as perfect.

1238
01:10:14,732 --> 01:10:16,647
Right there. "Perfect."

1239
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:21,391
You also went on to say
that their marriage

1240
01:10:21,434 --> 01:10:25,221
was loving and healthy
and respectful.

1241
01:10:27,048 --> 01:10:28,311
Next photo, please.

1242
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,574
You recognize this photo?

1243
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:35,753
Yes, it's the fireplace
in my sister's living room.

1244
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:38,016
It was taken in 1999. Do you see
a blow poke by the fireplace?

1245
01:10:38,843 --> 01:10:40,714
- No.
- No?

1246
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:43,151
And yet you said under oath
that you remember seeing

1247
01:10:43,195 --> 01:10:45,284
the blow poke by the fireplace

1248
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:47,765
as recent as last year.
Isn't that what you told the DA?

1249
01:10:48,026 --> 01:10:50,463
Yes. And there was.

1250
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:53,031
Really? Next photo.

1251
01:10:53,814 --> 01:10:54,772
Recognize this one?

1252
01:10:55,425 --> 01:10:57,514
That photo was taken in 2000.

1253
01:10:57,557 --> 01:10:59,211
Do you see a blow poke
by the fireplace?

1254
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:00,256
No.

1255
01:11:01,474 --> 01:11:02,780
No, because the truth is,
the blow poke

1256
01:11:02,823 --> 01:11:05,304
hasn't been anywhere near
the fireplace in years.

1257
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:07,828
-Isn't that right?
-No, it was there last year.

1258
01:11:08,307 --> 01:11:11,267
Right. So then, where is it?

1259
01:11:13,443 --> 01:11:14,444
Where?

1260
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,274
Where?

1261
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:25,019
Agent Deaver, you told the court
that five blood drops

1262
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:28,196
found near the stairwell
were caused by

1263
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:31,765
someone swinging
an object back in an arc.

1264
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:34,290
-Uh, did I get that right?
-Yes.

1265
01:11:34,725 --> 01:11:37,293
Uh, look at the defendant
if you would, please, Agent.

1266
01:11:38,642 --> 01:11:40,165
He's five-foot-eleven.

1267
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:44,169
Now, if he were to swing
a fireplace poker,

1268
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:45,823
or some such instrument,

1269
01:11:45,866 --> 01:11:48,739
where you say he did,
right here,

1270
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:52,046
wouldn't it hit the molding
of the door frame

1271
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,178
leading to the stairwell?

1272
01:11:53,221 --> 01:11:54,788
It is possible.

1273
01:11:54,832 --> 01:11:57,051
And yet, the police
reported no such markings.

1274
01:11:57,095 --> 01:11:58,836
- That is correct.
- Now, are you aware

1275
01:11:58,879 --> 01:12:02,970
that the world-famous
forensics expert, Dr. Henry Lee,

1276
01:12:03,014 --> 01:12:06,365
reviewed your work
and determined that the scene

1277
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,715
is not consistent
with a beating?

1278
01:12:09,586 --> 01:12:12,589
Um, no. I was not aware of that.

1279
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:16,854
No. Were you aware that, uh,
he felt the--

1280
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:19,378
the state's handling
of the forensics in this case

1281
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,859
-are utterly incompetent?
-Objection.

1282
01:12:22,512 --> 01:12:23,513
Withdrawn.

1283
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:33,436
Happy Birthday!

1284
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:36,569
♪ And many more♪

1285
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:39,398
Happy Birthday.

1286
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:40,834
Happy Birthday,
Uncle Bill.

1287
01:12:40,878 --> 01:12:42,923
- Happy Birthday.
- Come on, make a wish.

1288
01:12:42,967 --> 01:12:45,099
Hello. Yeah. Yeah.

1289
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:58,417
The DA's calling
Brent Wolgamott

1290
01:12:58,461 --> 01:13:00,593
as a witness
giving him immunity.

1291
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,553
Hardin can't get a conviction
with the evidence,

1292
01:13:03,596 --> 01:13:06,164
so he's gonna create some drama
with this Brent.

1293
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:09,559
-Well, who is Brent?
-You know him as Brad,

1294
01:13:09,602 --> 01:13:11,082
the male prostitute.

1295
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:13,171
Why didn't you tell me
about this guy?

1296
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:17,871
The state calls
as its next witness,

1297
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:19,264
Brent Wolgamott.

1298
01:13:29,274 --> 01:13:30,667
At the time,
I was on active duty

1299
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:34,148
at Fort Bragg, and charging
150 an hour as an escort,

1300
01:13:34,192 --> 01:13:35,454
using the name Brad.

1301
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:40,894
Uh, my clients
were mostly doctors, lawyers,

1302
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:43,723
and a few judges.

1303
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:45,464
Not this judge.

1304
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:53,167
What types of services
did you offer as a prostitute?

1305
01:13:53,516 --> 01:13:56,083
I prefer the term
"male escort."

1306
01:13:56,127 --> 01:13:57,389
Okay.

1307
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,914
What types of services
did you offer as a male escort?

1308
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:05,136
Ooh, just about anything
under the sun, safely,

1309
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:07,355
-I might add.
-Good to know.

1310
01:14:07,747 --> 01:14:10,881
And how did you connect
with Michael Peterson?

1311
01:14:10,924 --> 01:14:12,099
Over the Internet.
It's...

1312
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:14,624
how I met all my clients,
from my website.

1313
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:17,496
So, you and he exchanged emails.

1314
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,759
-Yes.
-Discussing what, precisely?

1315
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:23,894
Well, basically
what kind of sex

1316
01:14:23,937 --> 01:14:25,983
-we were going to have.
-And what kind of sex

1317
01:14:26,026 --> 01:14:28,159
were you and Mr. Peterson
going to have?

1318
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:31,336
Can I say it?

1319
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,121
Anal sex.

1320
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,517
Thank you.

1321
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,695
Just so everyone
is clear,

1322
01:14:42,739 --> 01:14:45,568
you and Michael Peterson
never actually met.

1323
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:47,700
-Is that right?
-That is correct.

1324
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:49,310
So, you never had sex?

1325
01:14:49,789 --> 01:14:51,312
That's right. We never did.

1326
01:14:51,574 --> 01:14:54,359
And in these email exchanges,

1327
01:14:54,402 --> 01:14:56,143
did he ever talk
about his marriage?

1328
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:59,103
Yes, he said that he had
a great marriage.

1329
01:14:59,146 --> 01:15:02,367
And that he had a lot of warmth
and affection for his wife.

1330
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:05,501
And when did these emails end?

1331
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:08,155
September 5th, 2001.

1332
01:15:09,069 --> 01:15:11,071
So, the two of you never met.

1333
01:15:11,594 --> 01:15:15,511
And all communication stopped
in September of 2001.

1334
01:15:15,554 --> 01:15:18,557
And what do you know about
the death of Kathleen Peterson

1335
01:15:18,601 --> 01:15:20,603
in December of 2001?

1336
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,562
I know diddley.

1337
01:15:24,432 --> 01:15:25,912
I take it that means "nothing?"

1338
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:28,524
I know nothing. Zip.

1339
01:15:29,612 --> 01:15:31,744
So, then,
why are you here?

1340
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:33,398
I don't know.

1341
01:15:36,053 --> 01:15:37,315
I trust that you do.

1342
01:15:44,104 --> 01:15:45,366
Are we dead?

1343
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:47,194
No, we're not dead,
just wounded.

1344
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:51,459
The prosecution has rested.
Tomorrow, is our turn.

1345
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,027
Get some rest. We'll get 'em.

1346
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,378
So, what do you think?
How's it going?

1347
01:15:58,031 --> 01:16:00,381
Great. Tomorrow's the big day.

1348
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:08,085
Well, I guess that was it.

1349
01:16:19,139 --> 01:16:23,100
He's bisexual!
He watches hardcore porn.

1350
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:25,798
I saw the emails,
the photos on the computer.

1351
01:16:25,842 --> 01:16:27,757
My God, how long has this
been going on?

1352
01:16:28,279 --> 01:16:29,802
I don't hate you, Michael.

1353
01:16:30,803 --> 01:16:33,023
But I want a divorce.
I want a divorce.

1354
01:16:37,157 --> 01:16:38,768
Do you swear 
to tell the truth...

1355
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,989
the whole truth, 
and nothing but?

1356
01:16:43,033 --> 01:16:44,077
I do.

1357
01:16:58,178 --> 01:17:00,006
Dr. Henry Lee has been flown in

1358
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:01,791
to testify
for the defense in this case,

1359
01:17:01,834 --> 01:17:03,444
the defense
for Michael Peterson.

1360
01:17:03,488 --> 01:17:05,272
As you all know, he is on trial

1361
01:17:05,316 --> 01:17:06,665
for the murder of his wife,
Kathleen.

1362
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:11,278
Remember the infamous 
O.J. Simpson case?

1363
01:17:11,322 --> 01:17:13,063
Where do you go? 
Where do you run?

1364
01:17:13,454 --> 01:17:14,717
To Dr. Henry Lee.

1365
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:19,112
Ten thousand pieces of
blood splatter can't be wrong.

1366
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:21,941
You must look at the totality.

1367
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,075
You can't look at just one
isolated pattern.

1368
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:26,903
So, Dr. Lee,
in your expert opinion,

1369
01:17:26,946 --> 01:17:28,469
what caused this blood splatter?

1370
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:33,431
In my opinion, Mrs. Peterson
coughing up blood.

1371
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:35,694
Would you like me
to demonstrate?

1372
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:36,695
Yes, I would.

1373
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:40,090
Your Honor, this is ketchup.

1374
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:42,179
Here we are.

1375
01:17:50,796 --> 01:17:55,192
See? Oh, I think I got a bit
of ketchup on your suit.

1376
01:17:55,235 --> 01:17:56,672
Oops, sorry.

1377
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:03,548
If you believed
that Mrs. Peterson

1378
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:05,724
coughed up blood and that's
what caused the spatter

1379
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,987
then why didn't you test
the supposed

1380
01:18:08,031 --> 01:18:10,773
blood aspiration spatter
for saliva, sir?

1381
01:18:11,295 --> 01:18:12,688
It's not my job.

1382
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:15,995
If your local officials
did their job properly,

1383
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:18,302
then I don't have to be here.

1384
01:18:29,269 --> 01:18:32,142
As Peterson's defense team 
winds down its case,

1385
01:18:32,185 --> 01:18:34,884
pundits are predicting 
a hung jury,

1386
01:18:34,927 --> 01:18:37,582
saying things would be different if the police had only produced

1387
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:38,888
the murder weapon.

1388
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:42,239
A trial is a lot like sex,

1389
01:18:45,024 --> 01:18:47,026
all this buildup, friction,

1390
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,814
back and forth, aggression,
submission,

1391
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:54,077
control.

1392
01:18:54,642 --> 01:18:56,427
I'm on top. You're on top.

1393
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:58,951
Well,
that's a unique perspective.

1394
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:00,126
Mm-hm. It is.

1395
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,173
I've been giving it
a lot of thought.

1396
01:19:03,216 --> 01:19:05,392
In fact, I'm thinking about
writing a book on all this.

1397
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:07,133
- Are you really?
- Mm-hm.

1398
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:10,267
You know, it's gonna be
a fascinating film,

1399
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,747
this documentary of yours.

1400
01:19:16,012 --> 01:19:17,404
Just...

1401
01:19:18,928 --> 01:19:20,930
...don't make me look
too awful, okay?

1402
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:23,976
Just try to be fair.

1403
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:26,631
I'm always fair.

1404
01:19:29,547 --> 01:19:31,767
I know. I trust you, Erica.

1405
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:35,205
And this film, your film,

1406
01:19:36,597 --> 01:19:38,817
it's gonna be my only legacy,

1407
01:19:41,254 --> 01:19:42,560
my only truth.

1408
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:56,356
Sorry, just want
to let you know we're leaving

1409
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,618
for the night.

1410
01:19:58,837 --> 01:20:00,883
Thank you. Have a good night.

1411
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:08,107
The blow poke,

1412
01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:10,806
what you and the DA have
described as the murder weapon.

1413
01:20:11,589 --> 01:20:12,808
Did you ever think to ask us

1414
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:14,984
-if we had located it?
-No.

1415
01:20:15,593 --> 01:20:17,073
You just figured it was gone?

1416
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:20,293
-Gone... or put up somewhere.
-Really?

1417
01:20:28,867 --> 01:20:30,303
Please tell the court what it is

1418
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:31,827
you're now holding
in your hands.

1419
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:35,221
- A blow poke.
- Not just a blow poke,

1420
01:20:35,265 --> 01:20:38,050
the blow poke found 
by his two sons

1421
01:20:38,094 --> 01:20:40,444
in the Peterson's garage 
last night,

1422
01:20:40,487 --> 01:20:44,535
where it has been all along.

1423
01:20:48,191 --> 01:20:51,281
Detective, have you ever given
any thought to what might happen

1424
01:20:51,324 --> 01:20:53,718
to an item like this
if it were actually used

1425
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:55,676
to beat someone to death?

1426
01:20:56,547 --> 01:20:59,332
- Probably be marked up.
- Precisely.

1427
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:00,943
See any dents on this one?

1428
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:05,295
A little, tiny indentation
of any kind?

1429
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:07,514
- No.
- No.

1430
01:21:08,733 --> 01:21:10,866
Blood? Hair?

1431
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:13,694
Anything other than cobwebs,

1432
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:16,045
-dead insects and dirt?
-No.

1433
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:18,177
Thank you.

1434
01:21:23,356 --> 01:21:25,881
And suddenly, 
all this time later,

1435
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:29,710
lo and behold, 
just the eve before

1436
01:21:29,754 --> 01:21:31,887
the defense wraps its case,

1437
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:35,281
voila, they produce
another poker.

1438
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:38,154
-What do you make of it?
-Uh, maybe it's like,

1439
01:21:38,197 --> 01:21:41,766
uh, Mr. Peterson said all along
that the police in Durham

1440
01:21:41,809 --> 01:21:43,550
just can't investigate a crime.

1441
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:45,161
-Do you have more of this?
-Lots.

1442
01:21:45,204 --> 01:21:47,163
Erica, why don't you come on

1443
01:21:47,206 --> 01:21:48,816
over here and have a glass
of wine with us?

1444
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,601
Why don't you guys quit
for the day, relax?

1445
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:53,299
Mm-hm.
You don't wanna miss this.

1446
01:21:54,692 --> 01:21:56,085
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

1447
01:21:58,087 --> 01:22:00,219
- So, David.
- Yes?

1448
01:22:00,263 --> 01:22:01,960
This blow poke business.

1449
01:22:02,004 --> 01:22:03,962
A rather convenient
11th-hour discovery.

1450
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:06,399
Oh, the truth is the truth.

1451
01:22:06,443 --> 01:22:09,185
I mean, Clayton and Todd
found it, called me right away.

1452
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:10,751
You were there in the garage

1453
01:22:10,795 --> 01:22:12,014
when we saw it
for the first time.

1454
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:14,146
-It's all on tape.
-Still, some people think

1455
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:16,975
-it was planted.
-Yes, of course, they would.

1456
01:22:17,454 --> 01:22:19,760
Kathleen Peterson
had no concussion

1457
01:22:19,804 --> 01:22:22,372
or swelling of the brain.
What does that tell you?

1458
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,678
And this year, uh, in the city,

1459
01:22:24,722 --> 01:22:27,203
there were 162 cases
of blunt-force trauma,

1460
01:22:27,246 --> 01:22:29,683
all of which had concussions
and swelling.

1461
01:22:29,727 --> 01:22:30,946
What does that tell you?

1462
01:22:32,556 --> 01:22:33,296
That their whole case is based
on circumstantial evidence.

1463
01:22:34,645 --> 01:22:36,386
And now, the murder weapon
has been thrown out,

1464
01:22:36,734 --> 01:22:38,431
and I think that's what
the jury's going to do

1465
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:41,130
with this entire case.
Throw it out.

1466
01:22:42,174 --> 01:22:43,219
Mark my words.

1467
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,570
You want to gloat, don't you?

1468
01:22:47,049 --> 01:22:49,138
Me? No, of course, not.

1469
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,140
Go on. They've put you
and your family

1470
01:22:51,183 --> 01:22:52,054
through bloody hell.

1471
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,838
Gloat.

1472
01:22:55,057 --> 01:22:56,841
Her camera's down,
give it a shot.

1473
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:59,235
All right. I'll gloat a little.

1474
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:05,197
Has the jury reached 
a verdict?

1475
01:23:06,068 --> 01:23:07,895
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1476
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:13,292
We, the 12 members of the jury
unanimously find the defendant,

1477
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:15,642
Michael Iver Peterson,

1478
01:23:16,252 --> 01:23:18,515
guilty of first-degree murder.

1479
01:23:30,918 --> 01:23:31,876
Mr. Peterson,

1480
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:34,531
do you have a statement
you'd like to make?

1481
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:37,012
Anything you wish to say?

1482
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:40,667
It's okay.

1483
01:23:42,365 --> 01:23:43,105
It's okay.

1484
01:23:45,455 --> 01:23:46,456
It's okay.

1485
01:23:48,588 --> 01:23:49,981
Michael Peterson,

1486
01:23:51,591 --> 01:23:55,204
this court hereby sentences you
to mandatory life in prison

1487
01:23:55,247 --> 01:23:57,510
without parole.

1488
01:24:13,483 --> 01:24:15,224
This court
stands adjourned.

1489
01:24:58,354 --> 01:24:59,833
You knew, didn't you?

1490
01:24:59,877 --> 01:25:01,618
That he used to beat
your mom, right?

1491
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:04,273
Yet you never told anyone.
Do you think justice was served?

1492
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:11,236
True justice would be
having my mother

1493
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,368
back here with me.

1494
01:25:13,804 --> 01:25:15,197
Failing that, yes.

1495
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,112
Don't you?

1496
01:25:19,288 --> 01:25:20,289
What?

1497
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:23,988
You still believe he's innocent?

1498
01:25:24,771 --> 01:25:26,121
I don't know what to believe.

1499
01:25:31,909 --> 01:25:33,128
Cut. We're done here.

1500
01:25:57,152 --> 01:25:58,327
It's pretty bad in here.

1501
01:26:00,111 --> 01:26:02,461
I filed the papers
for the appeal.

1502
01:26:02,505 --> 01:26:05,551
And as I mentioned,
these things take time. Years.

1503
01:26:05,595 --> 01:26:08,946
-What do you suggest I do?
-Request protective custody.

1504
01:26:10,426 --> 01:26:11,557
What about the film?

1505
01:26:11,601 --> 01:26:13,429
Erica sold it to some network.

1506
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:17,302
-Which one?
-Does it matter?

1507
01:26:17,346 --> 01:26:18,651
Yes, absolutely.

1508
01:26:20,262 --> 01:26:21,698
That's all I've got left.

1509
01:26:27,094 --> 01:26:28,095
We did it!

1510
01:26:29,532 --> 01:26:30,794
Hurry up, Caitlin!

1511
01:26:31,447 --> 01:26:34,058
Just give me a second.
I'm just gonna change.

1512
01:27:33,726 --> 01:27:36,251
"See, what a scourge 
is laid upon your hate,

1513
01:27:37,034 --> 01:27:40,167
that Heaven finds means 
to kill your joys with love.

1514
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:43,301
And I, for winking 
at your discords, too,

1515
01:27:43,345 --> 01:27:45,434
have lost a brace of kinsmen.

1516
01:27:46,348 --> 01:27:48,045
All are punish'd.

1517
01:27:49,612 --> 01:27:52,484
A glooming peace this morning 
with it brings.

1518
01:27:52,963 --> 01:27:55,313
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.

1519
01:27:55,966 --> 01:27:58,795
Go, hence, to have more talk 
of these sad things.

1520
01:27:59,535 --> 01:28:02,277
Some shall be pardon'd, 
and some punish'd.

1521
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:05,715
For never was a story 
of more woe

1522
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:10,372
than this of Juliet 
and her Romeo."
