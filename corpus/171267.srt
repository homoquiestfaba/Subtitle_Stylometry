You're asking me my opinion?

What exactly have you been
telling people about me?

00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:02,684
Only the truth, mademoiselle.

and trusted by his customers.

620
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:39,459

He feIt there
should be more to life...

622
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,765

the Societe Pharmeceutique...

625
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,240

to Central America...

George was the expedition's
most eager volunteer.

But his adventure
took a turn he did not expect.

630
00:38:13,266 --> 00:38:17,293
One night, he was invited
to drink unrefined cacao...

ceremonies.

634
00:38:27,814 --> 00:38:30,647
The Maya believed
cacao held the power...

635
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,208
to unlock hidden yearnings...

Now, George had been raised
a good Catholic...

639
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,035
but in his romance
with Chitza...

640
00:38:57,076 --> 00:38:59,306
he was willing
to slightly bend the rules...

642
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:06,573

tried to warn George about her.

heed their warning...

and fora while,
it seemed that he and Chitza...

Well, but if Charly
has no soul...
