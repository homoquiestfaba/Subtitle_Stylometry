if he wanted to
check the donor box.

she was talking about,

it to him,

he didn't hesitate.

00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,761
He said, "Yeah,
I wanna do that."

317
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,307

00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,893

teased me every day.

never get mad.

you knew you were his friend.

It was your first minute
on the field in months.

524
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,540
Yeah, I know.

525
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,333
I just don't feel like
I'm gonna want to
play again.

526
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,418
You can't mean that.

527
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,128
(SCOFFS)
The heck I don't.

528
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,754
You're gonna play, man.

529
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,423
This could be our year.

530
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,425
The sixth season
under Coach's program.

531
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,010
We're ready to win.
You know that.

532
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,469
Yeah, right.

533
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:25,765
Like people don't already
think we're not the worst
team in the conference.

534
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,685
Read a paper.
Okay, Justice?

535
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,937
They're saying
we'll be lucky to win
a game this year.

536
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,439
We know better
than that, don't we?

537
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,482
(SCOFFS) Whatever.

538
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,109
You better take it easy.

539
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,944
Honey, please.
No more tonight.

540
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,613
No, all right?
You don't understand.

541
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,324
You don't know
what it's like.
All right? How could you?

542
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,535
How could you?
How could anybody
understand it?

543
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,079
I don't understand
any of this!

544
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,998
I mean,
if God is so good...

545
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,293
If he's so good, then how
can he let such bad things
happen to good people?

546
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,424
He was just a little kid.
You know what I mean?

547
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,553
How could he be dead
at 15, baby?

548
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,722
Baby, don't cry, okay?
It's okay.

549
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,474
(CRYING)

550
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,226
Please, baby, don't cry.

551
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,771
You have to promise me
something, all right?
You can't let me forget.

552
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,105
Promise me you won't
let me forget.
All right?

553
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,398
What, Jon?

554
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,609
The dates! The dates!
All right?

555
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,487
The date of the crash.
The date of the funeral.

556
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,572
The date that he died.
You can't let me forget.

557
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,325
'Cause I don't want
to forget him, you know?

558
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,827
You have to promise me
you won't let me forget.

559
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,539
I'm right here.
Promise.

560
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,085
I think we need
to go home, Body.

561
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,920
Take a little break.

562
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,630
Be back with
Moms and Pops.

563
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,840
I'll go with you.

564
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,176
We'll get back
on track together.

565
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,512
Okay?

566
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,514
Yeah, okay.

567
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,351
Thanks.

568
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,982
(CAR HONKING)

569
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,294
Here we are.
Are you ready for this?

570
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,754
I don't know.

571
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,381
I don't know?

572
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,300
What the heck are you
talking about, Body?

573
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,843
Come on, man,
we got work to do.

574
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,888
URIA: Look, Jon.

575
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,807
Don't come here
if you want
to be coddled,

576
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,976
cause I'll give you
no quarter.

577
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,311
I'm sorry
about your brother.

578
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,731
But the way I see it,
you got a choice to make,

579
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,983
right here
and right now.

580
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,068
You can keep drinking
every night

581
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,779
and feel worse
about yourself
in the morning,

582
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,866
and do what your brother
would want you to do.

583
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,910
In fact, everything
you do should be
for you and for Luke.

584
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,705
You've gotta start
living for two, man.

585
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,623
That's gotta be
your motivation.

586
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,417
That's gotta be
your fire.

587
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,920
You've got to do
what would make
your brother proud.

588
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,589
So, you tell me,

589
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,383
in front of your mother
and your friend.

590
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:10,138
Are you willing to do
whatever it takes to be
the best that you can be?

591
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,602
Yeah.

592
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,729
Well then you've come
to the right place,

593
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,356
because I will
take you there.

594
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,234
Thank you.

595
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,198
Come on, Jon, knees up.
Drive! Drive! Drive!

596
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,657
Abs tight!
Pull those arms!

597
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,368
Come on. Drive.
Pull, pull, pull.

598
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,496
On the ball of
your foot, come on.
Abs tight. Bounce!

599
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,083
Get light on those feet.
Come on. Move, move!

600
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,709
Get down.
Right here, right here.

601
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,211
(JON GRUNTING)

602
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,629
Yeah. Abs tight,
chest up.

603
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,631
Up and down!
Come on, Jack.

604
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,760
You know who this is for!
Hold. Out to the side.

605
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:51,054
Who's giving up first?
Who's giving up first?

606
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,306
Come on, come on, come on!

607
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,559
Turn your foot. Pivot, pivot.
Right arm across the body.

608
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,229
You guys are pitiful.
Hit the ground,
give me pushups.

609
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,814
Seven, six...

610
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,899
Your grandmother does it
better than that, man!

611
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,692
(INDISTINCT)

612
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,820
Kick! Back! Kick! Back!

613
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,490
Kick that bag.
What's wrong,
are you tired already?

614
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:13,034
Four, three, two...

615
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,494
Blow that air out
and squeeze.

616
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,995
Come on girls, get tough.

617
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,414
Come on, man. Hit!

618
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,707
Yeah, that's real hitting.
Good.

619
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,168
Come on, hit the pads
like you mean it.

620
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,753
How bad do you want this?

621
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,797
Right. Lie back.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

622
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,968
MARYANNE: Green tea.

623
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,138
Uria says you're
supposed to drink some
after every meal.

624
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,849
That's one crazy
South African.

625
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,684
I honestly believe
he'll kill us.

626
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,687
It was the toughest workout
I ever had, man.

627
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,898
I heard he used
to be some kind of
Delta Force trainer

628
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,567
or commando or something.

629
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,318
Probably kill us
with his pinkie.

630
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,530
ADAM: Remember we used
to fight over who Luke
would sleep with?

631
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:55,201
Yeah. He used to hide
under my bed when I was
taking a shower.

632
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,830
He'd stay there for hours,
waiting for me to fall asleep.

633
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,914
Then, all of a sudden,

634
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,709
he'd start rattling the bed,
making these crazy
animal noises.

635
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,629
He'd send me running
to you guys screaming
like a little girl.

636
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:07,755
Which you are.

637
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,299
And always will be.

638
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,550
(ALL LAUGH)

639
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:15,972
I know it doesn't compare
to losing Luke or anything,

640
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,392
but I lost an older brother
when he was just
a few weeks old.

641
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,060
You did?

642
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,395
BRADLEY: He was born
with a bad heart.

643
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,648
I know it sounds
kind of crazy,

644
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,067
but I think about him
all the time.

645
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,070
Not necessarily the fact
that I miss him or anything,

646
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:36,951
just wondering what
it might've been like
to have an older brother.

647
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,206
Well, to Luke.

648
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,876
May he rest in peace
forever in heaven.

649
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,587
To Luke.
To Luke.

650
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,511
You know in the mornings,
when you're somewhere

651
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,305
between your dreams
and being awake?

652
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,058
Hmm. Yeah.

653
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:05,146
I used to have these
reoccurring dreams

654
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,399
that something awful was
about to happen to them.

655
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,945
Especially Luke,

656
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,573
being the youngest.

657
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,617
What kind of dreams?

658
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,077
Oh, different things.

659
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,914
Falling off
a hotel balcony.

660
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,334
Someone trying
to kill them.

661
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,839
But the worst
was Luke drowning,

662
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,050
being pulled
toward this black hole.

663
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,762
And I'd dive in
and I'd be trying
to save him.

664
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,599
And when I realized
I'm not going to be
able to save him,

665
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,061
I'd just wake myself up.

666
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:49,566
So that it didn't
actually happen.

667
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,734
I didn't know.
You never said.

668
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,655
I didn't want to
even say the words.

669
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,242
I just wanted
those thoughts
out of my mind.

670
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:05,290
And I remember
I would be so relieved.
It was just a dream.

671
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,586
It's because
you love your
kids so much.

672
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,341
And now,
it's all turned around.

673
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,845
I dream of Luke.

674
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:19,929
And Maryanne...

675
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,849
He's here.

676
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,518
I can feel him.

677
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,061
I smell him.

678
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,271
No.

679
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,277
And now
I don't wanna wake up.

680
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,043
All the way. All the way.
You wanna be number one?

681
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,086
Come on.
Come on, Jon, for two.

682
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,714
Come on, Jon, all the way.
Keep it tight. Pull, pull!

683
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,215
Jon, you've got this
all day long.

684
00:43:56,425 --> 00:44:00,011
Down. Up. Hold it down.
Arms back. Circles.

685
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,221
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's push.

686
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,724
Uppercuts! Up! Up! Up!

687
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,101
Five, four, three...

688
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,686
Come on! Come on!

689
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:11,147
Come on, for two, baby!
All the way! All the way!

690
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,524
We never give up, man.
We never give up.

691
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,152
Two more, Jon.
You're doing it for two.
You're doing it for two.

692

01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,736
he came home,
he would be

1030
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,532
so upset.

1031
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,951
It's okay.
It's okay.

1032
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,245
He always worried

1033
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,790
that I'd be safe.

1034
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,962

1036
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,632
Why didn't he...

1037
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,515
I lost Luke.

1038
01:04:59,353 --> 01:05:01,771
I don't wanna
lose my mom, too.

LAMBERT:
Now, as it's always
my pleasure to do,

1058
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,368
let me bring up
the guy we all come here
to see each week.

1059
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,246
Head Coach of
the Demon Deacons,
Jim Grobe!

1060
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,831
(CROWD WHOOPING)

1061
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,342
Afternoon, folks.

1062
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,677
ALL: Afternoon, Coach.

1063
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,930
Well, it's no secret that
this is a particularly
important week for us,

1064
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,640
after the loss to Clemson.

1065
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:03,768
It's the first time
the kids have faced
this type of adversity.

1066
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,688
And I've told them
this is a genuine
opportunity

1067
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:09,274
to test their
strength of character.

1068
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,818
(CHUCKLES) Last week
was a real shock
to many of them.

1069
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:16,114
I mean, here we are
about to go up 20 to 3
in the fourth quarter,

1070
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:19,617
and then, boom,
on one play, we're reeling
and we're on our heels.

1071
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:23,538
And then we let
Clemson beat us up
by scoring 24 points.

1072
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,832
Now before that,
we did some good things.

1073
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:27,917
Riley Skinner
played a good game.

1074
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,003
Jon Abbate was
very dominant
in the middle.

1075
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:32,338
What did he have, Bret?
Twelve? Thirteen tackles?

1076
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:36,509
But, we did not
protect the football
on the field goal attempt,

1077
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:40,638
and we did not
respond as a team
once the momentum shifted.

1078
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:42,265
So you can bet this week,

1079
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,976
I'm gonna expect
some better play
from our kicking game

1080
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,144
and our special teams.

1081
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:48,229
Any questions?

1082
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:50,315
Mit?

1083
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,567
Coach, Riley's such
a young quarterback.

1084
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,819
Are you worried that
he's got last week
out of his head?

1085
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:55,904
How's he looking?

1086
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,655
Well, he looks good.

1087
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,158
He's got nice hair
and a good tan.

1088
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,576
(ALL LAUGH)

1089
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:04,496
No, he's fine.
One thing Riley doesn't
lack is confidence.

1090
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,916
He stepped
into that starting job
and never missed a beat.

1091
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
He's a leader.

1092
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,836
I'm expecting him
to play well this week,
not throw me under the bus.

1093
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,088
Anybody else
got a question?

1094
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:14,672
WOMAN: Coach...
GROBE: Bob?

1095
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,759
Yeah, Coach. I know
we've been playing
a lot of running backs

1096
01:08:17,843 --> 01:08:19,052
since Micah went down.

1097
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:22,222
And no one has really
emerged as the key back.

1098
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:23,765
Who do you expect
to do that?

1099
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,183
I'd keep an eye on Harris.

1100
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:27,352
I'm expecting him to have
a big game this week.

1101
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:30,563
All right, folks,
I'll see you on Saturday.

1102
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,565

ALL: Go Deacs!

1104
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,865
Nobody out there
expects us
to bounce back

1105
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,910
after the type of loss
we suffered last week.

1106
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:46,913
Make no mistake, gentlemen.

1107
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,874
It will require
a tremendous effort

1108
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:51,835
from each and every man
in this room

1109
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,586
to give us a chance
to win this game.

1110
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:57,298
They don't think
you're gonna come back.

1111
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,217
They think
you're gonna fold.

1112
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:01,719
They think
you're gonna crumble.

1113
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,055
They think
you're gonna quit.

1114
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,559
We need to raise
our level of intensity.

1115
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,854
And do the things
we know how to do.

1116
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,481
Stay focused!

1117
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,401
Whether it's
going our way or not.

1118
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,654
Don't get too high,
and don't ever get too low.

1119
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,031
That's the lesson
that we learned
from last week.

1120
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:24,450
Now let's pick
each other up
and play together.

1121

Third and goal
for North Carolina.

1138
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:13,309
This will be really
demoralizing for the Deacs
if the Tar Heels score.

but it's picked off
by Jon Abbate,

out of the end zone
and wisely stays in bounds.

01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,787
But the Eskimos
would last forever.

1193
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:24,083
The company
couldn't figure it out.

1194
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:27,420
So they started
doing all these
physiological tests.

1195
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:30,214
They checked their diets,
physical attributes,

1196
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:33,342
the density of their blood,
all sorts of things.

1197
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:38,389
In the end, the Eskimos
just said that they knew
it would be cold,

1198
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:41,767
but were focusing
on the task at hand.

1199
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,730
The Texans
were just focused
on the weather.

1200
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:49,942
The Eskimos were
mentally tougher.

1201
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,487
By a long shot.

1202
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:58,493
So when you take
the field this week,
don't be a Texan.

1203
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,828
Be an Eskimo.

1204
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:05,249
STEVEN:
I used to love taking
these morning walks.

1205
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:07,376
I'd think the world
was so beautiful.

1206
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,088
How you doing?

1207
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,424
Feeling good
about this game?
Oh, yeah.

1208
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:14,926
Yeah?
Yeah.

1209
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:21,724
You know, I don't
think I've really told you
how proud I am of you, Jon.

1210
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:26,812
You've been in
the eye of the storm
ever since Luke.

1211
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,066
Now you've got
the media attention,
the pressure,

1212
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:33,277
and to perform
the way you have.

1213
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,947
And do your school work.

1214
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:40,117
Every time I think about
how you've handled it all.

1215
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,162
Honest to God,
I'm in awe.

1216
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,457
Thanks, Dad.
I appreciate that.

1217
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,293
You went from
not being able
to get out of bed

1218
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,128
or ever wanting
to play again,

1219
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:54,590
to being the inspirational
leader of the team.

1220
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:57,593
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah.

1221
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:01,347
Listen, that time
you came home
with your mother,

1222
01:16:02,641 --> 01:16:04,350
I'm so sorry
I wasn't there.

1223
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,143
Dad, forget it.

1224
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:09,272
All right?
I know you gotta work
and support this house,

1225
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:11,023
take care of the family.

1226
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,651
You're doing
a great job, too, Dad.

1227
01:16:17,614 --> 01:16:18,614
You're doing a great job.

1228
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,452
Thanks, Jon.

1229
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,747
(EXHALING) What a year!

1230
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:29,584
What a mess.

1231
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,295
Yeah. What a mess.

1232
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:37,341
Listen, I know you've been
playing for Luke all year.

1233
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:41,012
But for this game,
I want you to play for you.

1234
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:44,307
You've earned it.

1235
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:49,353
I want you to take
the burden of this family
off of your shoulders.

1236
01:16:49,396 --> 01:16:53,524
And I want you to go out there
and I want you to have a ball.

1237
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,819
I want you to
hit someone hard.

1238

I want you to play
for the joy of
playing the game,

1239

for the love of
(SHOUTING) playing

1240

Okay.
All right?

1241
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,873
I want you to enjoy
every moment of it.
Can you do that?

1242
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:11,250
Yeah. I'll try, Pops.
I'll try.

Today in Alltel Stadium,

1244
01:17:14,212 --> 01:17:16,881
you'll be treated
to what might arguably
be considered

1245
01:17:16,923 --> 01:17:19,800
the most unexpected
conference championship game

1246
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:22,595
in the entire history
of college football.

1247
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:26,390
It was just a few months ago
that Wake Forest was picked
to finish last

1248
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,476
in the Atlantic Division
of the ACC.

1249
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,810
They surprised everyone...

1250
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:33,773
GROBE: Gentlemen,
we have faced a great deal
of adversity this season.

1251
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,984
Both on the field and off.

1252
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:42,573
The difference
between winning and losing,

1253
01:17:43,158 --> 01:17:46,744
in football and in life,
is how you respond.

1254
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:51,749
And I am so proud
of how each and
every one of you

1255
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:54,960
has handled some
pretty tough situations.

1256

(CROWD CHEERING)

1257
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:00,007
See, I've never enjoyed
coaching as much as I have
this season.

1258
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,425
Thank you.

1259
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,344
Very much.

1260
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,263
You have cared
for one another.

1261
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:08,974
You have been unselfish.

1262
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:11,936
And make no mistake,
gentlemen.

1263
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,980
You have made
all this happen.

1264
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,067
You know,
before the season,

1265
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,986
the press picked us
to finish last
in our division.

(CHUCKLES)

1267
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,784
I had to wonder
whether I was
losing my mind

1268
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,079
because I thought we had
a chance to be pretty good.

1269
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:31,789
Now, here we are.

1270
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:37,795
So today, I want you to
go out there and I want you
to do what we do.

1271
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,923
We block and we tackle.

1272
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:45,469
We protect
the football on offense,
and we fly around on defense.

1273
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:49,306
Now some things
will go our way today,
and some things won't.

1274
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,518
Don't get too high
and never get too low.

1275
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:55,855
Now let's pick each other up,
and good things will happen.

1276
01:18:56,314 --> 01:18:58,649
Now get out there
and play like
your hair's on fire!

01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:55,876
They don't tell you a thing
to help you understand

1363
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:00,422
So give me a moment
I want to remember

1364
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,676
Each line in your face
Every crease in your hand

1365
01:27:04,761 --> 01:27:09,306
'Cause I... I don't have

1366
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:13,227
The words to say goodbye

1367
01:27:13,978 --> 01:27:20,734
But I... I will try
I will try

1368
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:26,823
As I live and breathe

1369
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:31,328
Feel you beside of me

1370
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:38,252
I will remember you
my whole life through

1371
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:44,258
As I live and breathe

1372
01:27:57,563 --> 01:28:02,859
Counting the walls
just to make sure
they still fall

1373
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:10,367
Crossing the room
with my feet off the floor

1374
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:14,288
Did I imagine
that knock on my door?

1375
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:20,210
Your photograph
just spoke my name
I could swear

1376
01:28:20,253 --> 01:28:25,132
These empty echoes linger
like you're still there

1377
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:29,553
Just like you used to say
Hang on for one more day

1378
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:34,224
Tomorrow things
will look better

1379
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:38,937
But not this time
It's not going to work

1380
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:44,693
Can't get over this
There's no way, but through

1381
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:47,279
You got me
through the good and bad

1382
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:49,489
You gave me
everything you had

1383
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:56,413
But you forgot
to tell me what to do
When it came to losing you

1384
01:28:59,208 --> 01:29:03,879
But not this time
It's not going to work

1385
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:09,176
Can't get over this
There's no way, but through

1386
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,304
You got me
through the good and bad

1387
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:14,556
You gave me
everything you had

1388
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:21,438
But you forgot
to tell me what to do
When it came to losing you

1389
01:29:23,274 --> 01:29:35,452
When it came to losing you
