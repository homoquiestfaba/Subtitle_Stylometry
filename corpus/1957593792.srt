00:00:01,457 --> 00:00:04,290
(Multicom jingle)

2
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:15,772
(placid music)

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,410
- There's a local Ojibwe saying,

4
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,990
If a young woman makes her way
to the church of our elders,

5
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:56,410
she will return one day with her husband.

6
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,980
- Don't put any money on me.

7
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,500
- But it's true.
- Tease, I know I said

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,250
I wouldn't leave Alaska until
I visited some sacred grounds,

9
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,020
but I just can't.
(tribal chanting)

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,990
Are those ceremonial drums?

11
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,040
- Yes, but the sounds are deceiving here.

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,533
It's two more miles upriver.
- Two miles?

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,210
Oh, I mean, we got this far.
(tribal chanting)

14
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,623
What's two little miles?

15
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:23,623
(tribal chanting)
(water splashing)

16
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:28,864

00:01:32,512 --> 00:01:37,512

00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:15,920
(tribal chanting)
(drums thumping)

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,630
- I told him tat you
wanted to take pictures,

22
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,108
and that you've come to
give him a gift of thanks.

23
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:24,380
(tribal chanting)
(drums thumping)

24
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,213
(speaking in foreign language)

25
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:27,050
(tribal chanting)
(drums thumping)

26
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:32,050
He thanks you.
(speaking in foreign language)

27
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,030
He gives you this
necklace to remember them,

28
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,397
and it will protect you.

29
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,109
- Thank you.

30
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:46,109
(tribal chanting)
(drums thumping)

31
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,628

33
00:03:02,052 --> 00:03:02,885

00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:07,314
(tribal chanting)
(drums thumping)

35
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:08,147

36
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:12,163
(tribal chanting)

37
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:12,996

(beeper beeping)
(birds chirping)

40
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:27,948
Oh, damn.

41
00:03:27,948 --> 00:03:28,781
(beeper beeping)
(birds chirping)

42
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,070
- There's a telephone about
three miles down the river,

43
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,180
near where we put the canoe in the water.

44
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,400
- Tomorrow, I'll be back in Denver,

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,470
slugging at a light beer campaign,

46
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,940
fighting for my place in the
corporate ladder, you'd think.

47
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,170
- Wait, you dislike your work?

48
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,543
- Oh, I love advertising.

49
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,057
Sometimes, I wonder why.

50
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,150
(water rushing)

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,400
Do you have a Sherry Winslow there?

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,550
I was notified she was
in an auto accident.

53
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,720
Oh, well, what's her condition?

54
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,423
Yes, yes, I'm her sister.

55
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,453
Well, could you please
connect me to her room?

56
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,590
Well, why, what's wrong with her?

57
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,803
Well, well, who can answer my questions?

58
00:04:09,213 --> 00:04:10,980
Oh.
(phone slamming)

59
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,530
- [Pilot] Attention passengers,

60
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,554
we'll be landing in Denver in 10 minutes.

61
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:19,554
(placid music)
(motor droning)

62
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,204

64
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:27,959

65
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,002
(siren ringing)
(placid music)

66
00:04:32,002 --> 00:04:32,947
- [Doctor] Clear the way, clear the way.

67
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:37,947
(chattering)
(placid music)

68
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,473
- What happened?

69
00:04:47,473 --> 00:04:48,321
(placid music)
(phone ringing)

70
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,904
- Oh, honey, she...

71
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:54,580
She's gone.
- What?

72
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,758
- She's gone, she's gone (cries).

73
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,341
(placid music)

74
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:07,768
- Oh, she can't be dead.

75
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:09,488
(placid music)

76
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:10,321
No.

77
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,496
(placid music)

78
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:13,329
She can't be.

79
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,912
(placid music)

80
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:18,147
Where is she?

81
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:20,489
Where is she?

82
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:21,322
I wanna see her.

83
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,905
(placid music)

84
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,318
(placid music)
(chattering)

85
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:35,901
(placid music)

86
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:54,511
(chattering)

87
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,711
Couldn't you wait, Sher?

88
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,413
God, this can't be true.

89
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,210
What happened?

90
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,110
- She had severe internal injuries.

91
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,800
They wanted to operate
to stop the bleeding,

92
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,880
but when she saw the concent form

93
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,480
and realized there was a
substantial risk to the baby,

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,350
she refused.
- I beg your pardon?

95
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,970
- The procedure could
have been a long one,

96
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,390
there was a chance...

97
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:30,543
- What baby?

98
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,653
- She was just beginning
her seventh month pregnancy.

99
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,270
They were able to deliver her
child by caesarian section,

100
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,220
but I'm afraid they don't
hold much hope for him.

101
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,112
(placid music)

102
00:06:45,112 --> 00:06:46,195
- Him, a boy.

103
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,164
(placid music)

104
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,545
Excuse me.

105
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,571
(placid music)

106
00:06:57,571 --> 00:07:02,571
(door rattling)
(placid music)

107
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:05,587
(door slamming)
(placid music)

108
00:07:05,587 --> 00:07:10,587
(placid music)
(Christine crying)

109
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,023
(placid music)

110
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,117
I'll take you home.

111
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,173
- No, not yet, you go ahead.

112
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,360
(phone ringing)

113
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
- [Nurse] Jennifer.

114
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,977
(chattering)

115
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,100
- I don't wanna leave you here.

116
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,757
- She asked to be cremated.

117
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,217
(chattering)

118
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,270
- I'll take care of it.

119
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,637
- She wants the ashes in
California near the cottage.

120
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,054
(chattering)

121
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,418
- Why didn't you tell me she was pregnant?

122
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,109
(chattering)

123
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:00,710
- Because I didn't know,

124
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,037
not until I'd picked
her up at the airport.

125
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,140
(phone ringing)

126
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,323
- Who's the father?

127
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,883
- She wouldn't say.

128
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,439
And now, I don't want to know.

129
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,439
(phone ringing)
(chattering)

130
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,390
- You remember last Christmas,
she was madly in love?

131
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:25,330
- She was always madly in love.

132
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,580
- No, this was different.

133
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,108
She made him sound like
some sort of Howard Hughes.

134
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,553
(placid music)

135
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,283
I sorta I wrote it off.

136
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,560
(placid music)

137
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,123
- She was determined to have that baby.

138
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:46,493
And it was all for nothing
(sobs) and she's gone.

139
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:54,146
(placid music)
(mother crying)

140
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:14,826
(baby crying)
(placid music)

141
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:24,965
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

142
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,680
- May I help you?

143
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,250
- I'd like to see Sherry
Winslow's baby, I'm his aunt.

144
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,639
- I'm sorry, no visitors.

145
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,083
- Oh, my sister died about an hour ago.

146
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:50,083
And I know that she would have
wanted someone to touch him.

147
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,937
Please, would you let me do that for her?

148
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:57,437
(baby crying)

149
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:03,693
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

150
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,719
Your mother paid a gigantic
price for your life.

151
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:18,560
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

152
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,301
Don't be too quick to let it go.

153
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:25,301
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

154
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,094
Give him a name, at least.

155
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,940
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

156
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,117
Kevin, our uncle.

157
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:36,117
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

158
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:45,648
(rain splashing)
(placid music)

159
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:48,231
(placid music)

160
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:16,182
- Hey, kiddo.

161
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:17,330
(placid music)
(phone ringing)

162
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,717
Kathy told me you came in, what
the hell are you doing here?

163
00:11:19,717 --> 00:11:21,670
(placid music)

164
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,020
- I'm not staying, I'm
on my way to Sacramento.

165
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,069
- Well, take all the time you need.

166
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:27,927
(phone ringing)

167
00:11:27,927 --> 00:11:30,393
- A couple of days.
- Are you sure?

168
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,767
I know it doesn't always seem like it,

169
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,193
but we can waddle through.

170
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,053
The Alaska material was incredible.

171
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:46,207
(bag rustling)

172
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:50,535
(leaves rustling)
(dog barking)

173
00:11:50,535 --> 00:11:53,035
(car droning)

174
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,945
(spray can hissing)

175
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,527
- [Mother] Chris?
- Out here.

176
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,527
(spray can hissing)

177
00:12:23,483 --> 00:12:27,390
(birds chirping)
(chattering)

178
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,223
Oh, they didn't.

179
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,040
Not Sherry, not in that.

180
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:37,142
(lid and bottle thumping)

181
00:12:37,142 --> 00:12:39,492
(cupboard squeaking)

182
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,492
- Christine?

183
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,990
What are you looking for?

184
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,037
- The big funnel.

185
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:57,532
- Ah (laughs).
(Christine laughing)

186
00:13:03,862 --> 00:13:06,445
(placid music)

187
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:14,465
(placid music)
(car droning)

188
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:36,733
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

189
00:13:44,852 --> 00:13:46,050
(door squeaking)

190
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,050
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

191
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:22,106
(placid music)
(water lapping)

192
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:22,435
(machine beeping)
(placid music)

193
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,155
- [Nurse] Dr. Parker to OR two, please.

194
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:25,505
Dr. Parker to OR two.

195
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:28,300
(machine beeping)

196
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,770
- I swear, he smiled at me.

197
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,820
- Obviously, he thinks you're hysterical.

198
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,710
The doctor said he'll be
here for at least a month.

199
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,380
You'll have plenty of time to get ready.

200
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,640
- Oh, I'm not taking him.
- [Molly] No?

201
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,140
- But trust me, I'll examine whoever does

202
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,500
under a microscope.

203
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,740
- Oh, I guess I just assumed.

204
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,980
- Well, listen, I neglect my
cat, I work 12 hours a day.

205
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,180
I'd make a lousy mother.

206
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,843
- That's kinda sad.

207
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,650
You seem to have such
a connection with him.

208
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,370
(machine beeping)
(baby crying)

209
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,979
- [Nurse] Molly, could you
come here for a second?

210
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:04,979
(machine beeping)
(babies crying)

211
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,310
- And the other children are?

212
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:15,880
- Sandy is three and Tommy's nine.

213
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,450
Both were adopted as infants.

214
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,033
- We always wanted three.

215
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,020
- How do you think they'd
respond to a new baby?

216
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,040
- Like any natural family,

217
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,600
it'll take some time, but
the kids'll figure out

218
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,510
that it isn't gonna change much.

219
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,343
- Other than that their mother and I

220
00:16:30,343 --> 00:16:32,240
won't be getting any sleep
for a couple of months,

221
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,040
and they won't be going anywhere,

222
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,530
and Sandy will be giving up her bed,

223
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,870
not to mention her spot in Ellen's lap.

224
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,250
And Tommy will have to share his spot.

225
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,893
- It'll be an adjustment,
they'll handle it.

226
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,605
(phone ringing)

227
00:16:47,605 --> 00:16:51,200
- What would you ask if you were me?

228
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,300
- I guess I'd ask if it would be all right

229
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,763
to come and see him, and I'd say yes.

230
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:05,615
(phone ringing)
(clock ticking)

231
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,263
- Hello?

232
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,403
When?

233
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
I'll be right there.

234
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:16,994
(phone slamming)

235
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,060
(baby crying)
(machine beeping)

236
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,420
Where's Kevin?

237
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,543
- In micro surgery, in room three.

238
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:28,543
(babies crying)
(machine beeping)

239
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,370
- [Nurse] Dr. Philips, pick up line two.

240
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,500
There's a phone call for
Dr. Philips on line two.

241
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,963
- [Attorney] Chris, how's he doing?

242
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,363
- He's still in surgery.

243
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:43,220
The Harrises where here, they
went ran for some coffee.

244
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,313
- They called me, Chris,
they're backing out.

245
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:49,643
- Well, no, they can't be,
they were right here, they--

246
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,430
- They were heartbroken,
but under the circumstances,

247
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,790
they decided, well...

248
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,117
They wanted a healthy child.

249
00:17:59,117 --> 00:18:00,900
(chattering)

250
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,900
- Oh, well, we'll have
to start all over again.

251
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,328
- Chris.

252
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:09,161
- Ms. Winslow?

253
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,850
That kid's hell bent to hang around.

254
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,700
He's got a long, slow recovery.

255
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,560
He's lungs are about two
thirds of what they should be,

256
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,470
and I'm not saying

257
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,150
that he's not gonna be
having digestive problems,

258
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,723
but he's one tough customer.

259
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,133
- Can I see him?

260
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,383
- Very briefly.
- [Nurse] Dr. Johnson,

261
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:30,567
call radiology, Dr.
Johnson, call radiology.

262
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:36,921
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

263
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:38,280
- I know he looks frail,

264
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,512
but his vital signs are better than ever.

265
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:44,070
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

266
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,835
- I admit right now, I'm all he's got.

267
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:48,630
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

268
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,384
The new parents decided to pass.

269
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:53,230
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

270
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,214
- Why do you wanna put
him up for adoption?

271
00:18:55,214 --> 00:18:57,480
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

272
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,405
- I'm an executive, I don't
know how to be a mother.

273
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,400
- The minute you walked in here

274
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,520
and leaned over this incubator,

275
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,253
you became Kevin's mother.

276
00:19:06,253 --> 00:19:09,270
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

277
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,483
I saw it, Chris.

278
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:15,483
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

279
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,720
- Molly thinks I'm your mom, Kev.

280
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,990
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

281
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,064
You're giving me another
chance, aren't you, kiddo?

282
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:29,301
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

283
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,683
You think you're pretty clever, don't you?

284
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:34,701
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

285
00:19:34,701 --> 00:19:36,072
He's looking right at me, Molly.

286
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,801
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

287
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,917
He's looking right at me.
- Yes, he really is.

288
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:46,917
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

289
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,918
- I wanted to breath for him.

290
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:56,147
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

291
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:59,008
I wanted to keep his heart beating.

292
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:04,008
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

293
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:07,427
I've never been so terrified in my life.

294
00:20:07,427 --> 00:20:12,427
(placid music)
(machine beeping)

295
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:17,539
(flamingos quaking)
(chattering)

296
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,210
- Hey mom, Grandma's got lunch.

297
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,380
- Where'd you leave Grandma?

298
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,080
- [Kevin] She's at a table, come on!

299
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,170
- Kevin.

300
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,100
(birds chirping)
(chattering)

301
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,377
Grandma's got lunch.

302
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:31,230
(birds chirping)
(chattering)

303
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,230
- Once a year, she lets me eat a hotdog.

304
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,713
- Oh, who is she?
- Mom.

305
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,013
- [Kevin] That's it, it's Mom.

306
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,410
- Kevin says he's gonna marry Lisa.

307
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,810
- I thought it was Danielle.

308
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,130
- I changed my mind.

309
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,850
- That boy's gonna pay some heavy alimony

310
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,740
if he's not careful.

311
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,120
- What's alimony?

312
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,770
- It's what a rich person pays
you when you get divorced.

313
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,410
- Never mind.

314
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,610
- Except my mom won't even get married.

315
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,230
- Oh, don't start, Kevin.

316
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,410
Well, what do you say, if
after we finish eating,

317
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,260
we all go home and have
some cake and ice cream?

318
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,330
- And open my presents?

319
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,785
- What presents?
(women laughing)

320
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:11,420
- And tell my story?
- What story?

321
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,910
- How she...

322
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,460
How my mom got me.

323
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,473
- Again?
- Haha, tell the story, Mom.

324
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,220
Tell the story.

325
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,320
- Well, I was in Alaska,
working on a project,

326
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,830
and I was going down the river.

327
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,970
- She was the president of a big company.

328
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,806
- [Christine] I wasn't
the president, Kevin.

329
00:21:27,806 --> 00:21:28,670
- But you were very important.

330
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,650
- Oh, yes, very.

331
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,240
Well, anyway, my beeper went off,

332
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,610
and I came straight back here.

333
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,560
- And you were so surprised,

334
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,040
because you didn't even know
my first mom had a baby.

335
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,360
- That's right, and there you were,

336
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,180
lying wide awake in the nursery.

337
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,130
- And when you saw me,
I was crying so hard,

338
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,700
the windows rattled.

339
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,881
- Oh, who's telling this story?

340
00:21:44,881 --> 00:21:46,185
(women laughing)

341
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:48,640
- And you had to cover
your ears, right Molly?

342
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,560
- Right, right.

343
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,350
- Wanna get a balloon?
- Sure.

344
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,068
- So, this tycoon from
Topeka we're meeting.

345
00:21:57,068 --> 00:21:58,768
- Odnot.
- Right, Odnot (laughs).

346
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:02,508
What does he want from you?

347
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:04,570
- A city.

348
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,559
- A city, in Kansas?

349
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,873
- No, no, in the Saudi Arabian desert.

350
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,340
- A little warm, isn't it?

351
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,970
- Well, we're gonna put a bubble over it

352
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,390
with air conditioning for him.

353
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,303
- You are not.

354
00:22:17,168 --> 00:22:18,289
- (laughs) Yeah.

355
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:21,547
(placid music)
(traffic droning)

356
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:26,547
(placid music)
(chattering)

357
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,608
- [Woman] Yeah, it's great, yeah.

358
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,760
- Where did you get that painting?

359
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,760
- Which painting?

360
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,490
- The one in the window,
the man on the horse,

361
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,040
where did you get it?
- Mason.

362
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,841
- On consignment from Colorado.

363
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,190
- Yeah, but where can I find the artist?

364
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,613
- I believe she's deceased.

365
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:10,901
(placid music)

366
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:11,734
- What?

367
00:23:11,734 --> 00:23:15,379
- Well the work was consigned
by a family member, hold on.

368
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,520
(placid music)

369
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,458
- Who is it, who painted it?

370
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,940
(placid music)

371
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,029
- Sherry.

372
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:26,130
(placid music)

373
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,703
- Yes, Sherry Winslow,
born 1962, died 1991.

374
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,200
We have another of her paintings.

375
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,510
Would you care to see it?

376
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,100
- 1991.
- That's what it says here.

377
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:38,510
- Let's get outta here.

378
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,093
(placid music)

379
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,170
(placid music)
(phone ringing)

380
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,260
- Kevin, have you put your bike away?

381
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,233
- [Kevin] I'm going to.
- Right now.

382
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,073
Hello?

383
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
- Hello, my name is Mason Whitney.

384
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,750
I'm looking for Sherry Winslow.

385
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,150
- I'm sorry, Mr. Whitney,

386
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,103
but Sherry passed away several years ago.

387
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,970
- Yeah, I just recently heard that.

388
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,770
I guess I was hoping it wasn't true.

389
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:11,843
- Well, it's true.

390
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,480
- Is this Mrs. Winslow?

391
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,980
- No, this is Sherry's sister.

392
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,480
How did you know Sherry?

393
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,603
- I, well, we were very close.

394
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:28,839
It was some time ago.

395
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:31,100
- I'm sorry.

396
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,683
- So am I.

397
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,870
More than you can imagine.

398
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,009
(placid music)

399
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:41,833
- When exactly did you know my sister?

400
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:43,600
(placid music)

401
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,670
- About seven years ago,

402
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:46,593
probably not too long before she died.

403
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,863
- And how long were you?

404
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:51,696
- More than enough time

405
00:24:51,696 --> 00:24:54,250
for me to have fallen in love with her.

406
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,213
We were together about six months.

407
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,350
(placid music)

408
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,312
I only wish I knew what happened.

409
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:00,420
(placid music)

410
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,667
All those years I thought, well...

411
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,443
Hey, thanks again for your time.

412
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,340
- You're welcome, goodbye, Mr. Whitney.

413
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,494
- Goodbye.

414
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:16,077
(placid music)

415
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:22,753
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

416
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,900
- This is terrific.

417
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,202
- I just spoke to Kevin's father.

418
00:25:32,202 --> 00:25:33,200
- What?

419
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,033
- You heard me.

420
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,200
- How do you know it was him?

421
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,580
- I know, he said enough, Mason Whitney.

422
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,993
- Oh, after all this time, that bastard.

423
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:47,570
- You know his name?

424
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,390
- He doesn't know about Kevin.

425
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,213
What did he want?

426
00:25:55,927 --> 00:25:57,250
- Well, he was asking about Sherry.

427
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,850
Mother, how could you be so sure

428
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,250
he doesn't know about Kevin?

429
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,593
- Trust me on this one, Christine.

430
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,803
- No, no, you answer me.

431
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,080
- Open the top drawer over there.

432
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,523
Take out the satin bag.

433
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,700
- What's this?

434
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,530
I thought everything was in storage.

435
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:29,680
- Well, not everything.

436
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:45,370
She must have written
it just before she...

437
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,923
- Mason Whitney.

438
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,220
You didn't mail it.

439
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,103
- No.

440
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,023
It was with the things
the hospital gave me.

441
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:02,013
And it was too painful.

442
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,920
I didn't even go through the bag

443
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,460
until after you brought Kevin home.

444
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,683
And then, I couldn't mail it.

445
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,560
Read it, you'll understand.

446
00:27:15,807 --> 00:27:18,640
(letter rustling)

447
00:27:21,487 --> 00:27:25,683
- "Mason, it's very hard for me to write.

448
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,377
"I've really missed you.

449
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,987
"I kept hoping you'd stop
being afraid of your feelings,

450
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:34,617
"change your mind and come find me,

451
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:35,450
"but you didn't.

452
00:27:37,597 --> 00:27:39,093
"Brace yourself for a shock.

453
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:44,257
"When I asked you to marry me,
I didn't tell you everything.

454
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:45,397
"I knew I was pregnant,

455
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,203
"but I also knew about your
medieval sense of honor.

456
00:27:49,831 --> 00:27:50,664
"You would have said yes

457
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:52,547
"and it would have been
for the wrong reason."

458
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:56,090
How could you not mail, Mother?

459
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:56,923
- Keep reading.

460
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,303
- "Dumb me, I never planned on dying.

461
00:28:02,957 --> 00:28:04,293
"It's going to be a boy.

462
00:28:05,437 --> 00:28:08,507
"My family will see to it
that he gets a good home,

463
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:09,387
"but I've always believed

464
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,067
"if you had given marriage a chance,

465
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,467
"we could have made an
incredible life together.

466
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,347
"And you'd have been a wonderful father.

467
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:18,827
"Now I'm leaving you the option.

468
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,963
"You can let my family know your decision.

469
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,973
"You made me perfectly
happy for a long time.

470
00:28:26,607 --> 00:28:28,743
"Loving you still gives me profound joy.

471
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:31,130
"Peace."

472
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:37,820
What in God's name where you thinking?

473
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,330
- I know who Mason Whitney is.

474
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,130
He's a corporate shark.

475
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,960
He's a rich opportunist.
- Oh, please.

476
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,653
- He hurt Sherry.

477
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,730
He never tried to find her.

478
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,563
And she died.

479
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,050
She died trying to bring
that baby into the world.

480
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,897
He did not deserve to know (sobs).

481
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,193
And what about you?

482
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,763
You belonged with Kevin.

483
00:29:16,177 --> 00:29:17,450
By the time I read that letter,

484
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:18,900
you were already his mother

485
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,723
and you loved him so much, Chris.

486
00:29:24,236 --> 00:29:26,190
(placid music)

487
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,190
It was the right thing for
that little boy and for you.

488
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:32,280
(placid music)

489
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,015
I believed it then and I believe it now.

490
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,156
(placid music)

491
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,783
- What if you hadn't survived your stroke?

492
00:29:40,783 --> 00:29:43,366
(placid music)

493
00:29:46,316 --> 00:29:47,737
No one would have ever known the truth.

494
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:52,737
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

495

(chattering)

501
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,610
- Sorry, I'm late, Will.

502
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,740
Oh, thanks, I'll see you when I get back.

503
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,460
I hate to make you speed to the airport.

504
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,850
- No problem, picked up your
mail and I packed your bags.

505
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,683
- Thanks a lot.

506
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,613
- Surprise.

507
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,373
- Oh, make me a happy guy,
tell me you're coming with me.

508
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,350
- I know I'd come if I could.

509
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,290
Problem is, I'm indispensable,

510
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,203
just not to you.

511
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,910
- You don't know how lucky you are.

512
00:31:10,793 --> 00:31:12,850
I'll probably take
terrible advantage of you.

513
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,777
- Say the word, I'll take my chances.

514
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:16,849
Mason and Elizabeth laughing)

515
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,320
- So, how'd you find Will?

516
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,877
- You forget, I'm very resourceful.

517
00:31:20,877 --> 00:31:22,463
- No, no, I don't forget.

518
00:31:24,094 --> 00:31:27,144
(letter rustling)
(traffic droning)

519
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:29,727
(placid music)

520
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,262
- What is it?

521
00:31:34,262 --> 00:31:39,262
(placid music)
(letter rustling)

522
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:43,270
(placid music)
(traffic droning)

523
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,355
Mason?

527
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,290
- Kevin?

528
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,400
- [Kevin] I'll get it.

529
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,730
- See who it is first.

530
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,563
- Okay.

531
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,450
Who is it?

532
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,523
- Mason Whitney.

533
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:21,700
(door rattling)
(car droning)

534
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,773
Hi, I bet you're Kevin.

535
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,313
- Yeah.

536
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,427
- Nice to meet you.

537
00:32:29,626 --> 00:32:31,100
- I better go get my mom.

538
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,723
- Could you wait a minute, buddy?

539
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,320
- [Kevin] Yeah, but I
can't open to the strain.

540
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,163
- That's okay.

541
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,860
You're a pretty big guy for
seven years old, aren't ya?

542
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,811
- More medium, I think.

543
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:44,933
- Mm, medium.

544
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,643
- Chris,

545
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,217
Mason Whitney is downstairs.

546
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:53,050
- What?

547
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,370
Are you sure?

548
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,203
- Yes.

549
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,972
- [Kevin] You look like
you're having a sad feeling.

550
00:32:58,972 --> 00:33:01,240
(placid music)

551
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,073
- Nah.

552
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,350
- Yeah, you are.

553
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,273
(placid music)

554
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:09,540
- I was just thinking about somebody.

555
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,370
You remind me of her.

556
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,493
She had hair and eyes just like yours.

557
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:17,713
- I'm supposed to look like
my first mom, she's dead.

558
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,593
- Yeah, I know.

559
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,383
I knew her.

560
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,845
So, where is your dad?

561
00:33:24,845 --> 00:33:26,420
- I don't get one.

562
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,340
- Why not?

563
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,548
- Sometimes you don't.

564
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,332
(placid music)

565
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,727
- [Mason] Would you like a dad?

566
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:32,560
- [Kevin] Of course.

567
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,716
- [Christine] Can I help you?

568
00:33:33,716 --> 00:33:35,970
(placid music)

569
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:36,803
- He's her.

570
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,463
His face, it's Sherry's.

571
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,560
- He's Mason.

572
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,143
(placid music)

573
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,520
- Kevin, go upstairs.
- But Mom...

574
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,597
- Right now, please.

575
00:33:51,597 --> 00:33:52,901
- Can I come in?

576
00:33:52,901 --> 00:33:55,484
(placid music)

577
00:33:56,781 --> 00:34:00,330
(door squeaking)

578
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:05,140
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

579
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,550
I got the letter yesterday,

580
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,654
post marked, Denver, three days ago.

581
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:09,924
(crickets chirping)

582
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:12,580
- Yes, I'm sorry, it
was a miscommunication.

583
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,413
- Well, why now?

584
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:16,320
Because I called, because you
thought I'd figure it out.

585
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,510
- No, because I only found
the letter three days ago.

586
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,742
Let's leave it at that.

587
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:23,320
(crickets chirping)

588
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,423
Why did you come here?

589
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,992
- What did you expect me to do?

590
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:28,630
(crickets chirping)

591
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,960
- Well, not this.

592
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,010
- Well, then why send the letter?

593
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:32,843
- Because once I found the letter,

594
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:34,763
I thought it was the
honorable thing to do.

595
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,503
- Look, you adopted
Kevin, you're his mother.

596
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,060
I'm not here to mess with that.

597
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,700
(crickets chirping)

598
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,860
- Thank you.

599
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,070
- But I do wanna provide for him.

600
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,850
- Well, I've been taking
care of him, and we're fine.

601
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,572
- What, by selling Sherry's paintings?

602
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:52,878
(crickets chirping)

603
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:53,711
- How do you know about that?

604
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:55,220
- Well, I saw one in a gallery.

605
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,375
That's how I found you
here in the first place.

606
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:58,840
(crickets chirping)

607
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,253
I know a lot, Ms. Winslow.

608
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,400
I know you quit a promising
career when Kevin was born.

609
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,380
You freelance at home,

610
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,090
your mother had a stoke 18 months ago.

611
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,350
That's put quite a financial
burden on the family.

612
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,300
You make about--
- I know what I make.

613
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,640
Listen, I'm on a deadline right now.

614
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,660
If I need anything, Mr. Whitney,

615
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,520
I have your address in
Sacramento, I'll drop you a note.

616
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,814
- [Mason] Wait a minute.

617
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:28,814
(crickets chirping)
(door rattling)

618
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,840
(chattering)
(traffic droning)

619
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,863
Miss Winslow.

620
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,840
- [Christine] I thought
you'd be back in Sacramento.

621
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,988
- This isn't a whim.

622
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:46,670
(traffic droning)

623
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,920
Kevin's trust account, you
can draw whatever you need

624
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,710
to cover his expenses.

625
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,743
Our local attorney's name and address.

626
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,210
Draw up an itemized list
of any previous expenses.

627
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,760
Some you'll have to estimate.

628
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,890
- No, slow down.

629
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,320
You can't make up for seven
years in five minutes.

630
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,590
- He'll see to it that you're
reimbursed with interest.

631
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,150
- I told you, I don't want your money.

632
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,500
- And I'd like to set up
some regular schedules

633
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,493
to see Kevin.

634
00:36:10,138 --> 00:36:10,971
- What, wait a minute?

635
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:13,658
- Don't you want your
son to have a father?

636
00:36:13,658 --> 00:36:15,320
- Well, that's a very dramatic word.

637
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,610
I love the way it catches in your throat.

638
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,550
And biology aside, you're
not Kevin's father.

639
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,434
He can't imagine you, he doesn't
even know that you exist.

640
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:23,960
(traffic droning)

641
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,554
- Sherry loved me, you read the letter.

642
00:36:26,554 --> 00:36:27,730
(traffic droning)

643
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,439
- She wasn't the greatest judge of men.

644
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,420
From what I can gather,

645
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,170
you didn't exactly move
heaven and earth to find her,

646
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,003
did you?

647
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,940
- I didn't know there was a baby.

648
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,280
She knew I didn't want children.

649
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,390
- Then I don't get it,
what are you doing here?

650
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,594
- I don't see why you're so threatened.

651
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:43,580
- You don't?

652
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,010
- No, and after this week,

653
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,725
I'm gonna stay here in Denver, and--

654
00:36:46,725 --> 00:36:47,900
- I don't think that
Kevin would like that.

655
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,050
In fact, I know that
I definitely wouldn't.

656
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,280
- I'm growing less concerned

657
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,530
with what you thing, Ms. Winslow.

658
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,720
- Well, I might be a tad more open to this

659
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,860
if I thought that you at least
cared about how Kevin feels.

660
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,160
- Sherry loved you,

661
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,415
and I'm trying very hard to respect that.

662
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:04,280
(traffic droning)

663
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,540
Now, I'm not suggesting
that Kevin's not yours,

664
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,060
but the fact remains, he's also mine.

665
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,900
- Well, I don't happen to see it that way.

666
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,751
- I'd like to see him
this Saturday morning.

667
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:14,920
(traffic droning)

668
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,140
I'll limit my preliminary
visits to two hours once a week.

669
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,780
- I guess I'm supposed to
be shaking in my boots.

670
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,380
- No, you're supposed to be fair.

671
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,217
- Well, you are you to
dictate to me what's fair?

672
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:25,760
- You have my number.

673
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,499
- Oh, boy, do I ever.

674
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:30,428
(traffic droning)
(siren ringing)

675
00:37:30,428 --> 00:37:33,261
(traffic droning)

676
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,070
So, he shows up barking orders

677
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,600
and you're telling me to cooperate?

678
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,980
- I'm telling you, if you don't,

679
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,350
my experience has taught me
that he'll take you to court.

680
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,520
He's a powerful man.

681
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,370
Is there any doubt in your
mind that he's Kevin's father?

682
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,513
- No.

683
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,780
- Well, they can demand a lot
more than two hours a week,

684
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,180
and he may very well get it.

685
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,760
Your mother deliberately withheld a letter

686
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,950
that not only established his paternity,

687
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,510
but clearly states that
Sherry wanted Mason Whitney

688
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,023
to raise Kevin.
- No, she gave him an option,

689
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:03,940
that's all.

690
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,060
- Suppose his lawyers convince the court

691
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,523
that you purposely did
not send that letter?

692
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,730
Your adoption is permanent,

693
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,060
but that doesn't mean Mason
can't make a hell of a case

694
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,163
for joint custody.

695
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,870
- Joint custody, can he get that?

696
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,363
- Look, just don't let it get that far.

697
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,093
- All right, he wants his
visit, he gets his visit.

698
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:29,383
But I'm going with him.

699
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,186
- I'll see what I can do.

700
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:36,384
(crickets chirping)

701
00:38:36,384 --> 00:38:37,631
(milk sloshing)

702
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,040
- We're going to the part tomorrow.

703
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,353
- With Molly and Zoe?

704
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,823
- Not this time.

705
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,914
Mason's coming with us.

706
00:38:45,914 --> 00:38:47,365
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

707
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:48,198
You remember him?

708
00:38:48,198 --> 00:38:49,031
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

709
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:52,405
- Yeah, that's kinda weird, though.

710
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:54,223
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

711
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:55,510
- Why's that?

712
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,001
- You hated him.

713
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,990
- Well, no, I didn't.

714
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,119
- He just surprised your mother, Kevin.

715
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:02,188
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

716
00:39:02,188 --> 00:39:03,021
- Then how come we're going?

717
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,959
Is this a date or something?

718
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:05,792
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

719
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:06,673
- Oh, no, no.

720
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:09,932
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

721
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:10,765
- Then how come?

722
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:14,050
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

723
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,040
- He wants to spend some time with you,

724
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,047
get to know you better.

725
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:23,033
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

726
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:24,422
Mason Whitney's your father, Kevin.

727
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,890
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

728
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,967
- Really?

729
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:29,320
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

730
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,153
- Really.

731
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,410
- Now I know why he was almost crying.

732
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,099
He was so glad to see me.

733
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:37,590
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

734
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,225
- That's right.

735
00:39:39,225 --> 00:39:41,555
- I never even knew I had a dad.

736
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,500
- Oh, he was in Sacramento.

737
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,874
- You still coulda told me.

738
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:47,535
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

739
00:39:47,535 --> 00:39:49,496
- I didn't know where he was.

740
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:53,407
- [Kevin] Oh, and he's
taking me to the park?

741
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:54,240
- That's right.

742
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,283
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

743
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,866
- Does he know I'm not a baby

744
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,447
and I don't go on swings and stuff?

745
00:39:58,447 --> 00:40:00,390
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

746
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,060
- You can tell him that yourself.

747
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,149
- Cool.

748
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:04,440
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

749
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,363
He was nice.

750
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:08,000
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

751
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,964
Wow, a dad.

752
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:14,964
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

753
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,490
So, it was a mistake?

754
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,700
- Yup, you see,

755
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,261
Sherry didn't tell me she
was gonna have a baby.

756
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:25,094
- Why not?

757
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:27,862
- Well, I don't know, maybe
she thought I'd be mad?

758
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,030
- Are you?

759
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,460
- No, when I heard about it,

760
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,740
I went straight to the airport,

761
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,500
and they said, "We don't have
a plane to Denver tonight."

762
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,792
And I said, "Well, you
better find me one."

763
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:38,670
- And what they find?

764
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,480
- They found a 400 seater.

765
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,330
I was the only one on
it, except for the pilot.

766
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,883
He called it the Kevin Special.

767
00:40:45,914 --> 00:40:48,011
- No way.
- Honest.

768
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:48,844
This okay?

769
00:40:48,844 --> 00:40:49,760
(chattering)

770
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,832
- Fine.

771
00:40:50,832 --> 00:40:53,249
(chattering)

772
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,970
- This is a Stegosaurus.

773
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:01,970
- Yeah, what's this?

774
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,725
- Brachiosaurus.

775
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:05,558
- Right.

776
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:07,890
(chattering)

777
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,723
- Mom, look!

778
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:09,556
(chattering)

779
00:41:09,556 --> 00:41:11,440
- [Christine] Watch
out, Kevin, be careful.

780
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,562
- They're plastic.

781
00:41:12,562 --> 00:41:14,040
(chattering)

782
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,670
- Kevin doesn't play with war toys.

783
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,150
- Oh, give me a break.

784
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,901
- You think that's funny?

785
00:41:18,901 --> 00:41:20,979
- No, I think it's very
politically correct.

786
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,390
(birds chirping)

787
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,223
- Why don't you and I have

788
00:41:24,223 --> 00:41:25,246
this conversations a little later?

789
00:41:25,246 --> 00:41:26,630
(birds chirping)

790
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,088
Kevin, let's go.

791
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:33,088
(birds chirping)
(chattering)

792
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:37,345
(car droning)

793
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:52,383
(car door rattling)

794
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:56,923
- [Mason] Kevin.

795
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,423
Here, these are for you.

796
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,306
- Sorry, Kevin, he can't accept them.

797
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:09,840
(birds chirping)

798
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,986
- Why don't you let
Kevin speak for himself?

799
00:42:11,986 --> 00:42:13,530
(birds chirping)

800
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,895
- Kevin, go inside.

801
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,610
(birds chirping)
(placid music)

802
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,543
- I'm sorry, son.

803
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,504
I wanted you to have a nice day.

804
00:42:21,504 --> 00:42:22,773
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

805
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:23,753
- I had a nice day.

806
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,440
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

807
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,577
- Kevin.

808
00:42:27,577 --> 00:42:31,725
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

809
00:42:31,725 --> 00:42:32,664
It's all right to say thank you.

810
00:42:32,664 --> 00:42:35,310
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

811
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,440
- Thanks, thanks a lot.

812
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,820
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

813
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,263
- A little irrational, don't you think?

814
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:43,580
They're just toys.

815
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,330
- No, there's no such thing as just.

816
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,163
Everything you do,

817
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:49,240
everything you say has
an impact on a child.

818
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,343
- Well, so I've heard.

819
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:55,721
- Well, don't you patronize
me, you were way out of line.

820
00:42:55,721 --> 00:42:56,640
I can't just allow some stranger

821
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,250
to show up and screw up his values.

822
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,570
- If I'm a stranger to that boy,

823
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,320
it's because you and your family conspired

824
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,660
to make it that way.

825
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,060
You deliberately hid him from me.

826
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,690
Then, when I tried to reach out,

827
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,510
you made it your personal
mission to interfere.

828
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,470
- No wonder Sherry never told
you that she was pregnant.

829
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:12,380
- You know what?

830
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,955
I'm gonna let the legal system
decide how to deal with this.

831
00:43:15,955 --> 00:43:16,800
- Are you threatening me?

832
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,360
- I don't threaten, lady.

833
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,440
I'm gonna drag you through
every court in this country.

834
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,990
I'll prove you denied my
right to be his father,

835
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,054
and I'll get custody,
believe me, I'll get custody.

836
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:30,500
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

837
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,915
- Come on, let's play.

838
00:43:31,915 --> 00:43:35,850
(feet stomping)
(children laughing)

839
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,912
- So, what are you gonna do?

840
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:39,380
- [Zoe] Kick here, kick it to me.

841
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,213
- Nothing.

842
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,610
I called his room and he checked out.

843
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,023
He'd gone back to Sacramento.

844
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,770
This is Mason's fad of the month.

845
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,100
He'll get tired of wanting to play daddy

846
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,210
and move on to something else.

847
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,040
- You don't think he's serious.

848
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,930
- No, I think he just
wants to brag about his son

849
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,830
with his friends at the racket club.

850
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,120
- How do you know that?

851
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,610
- Well, according to "Fortune Magazine",

852
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,533
Mason Whitney is worth millions.

853
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,700
Everything is about power
and ego with those guys.

854
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:06,143
- Excuse me.

855
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,560
(chattering)

856
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,420
Christine Winslow?

857
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,140
- [Christine] That's right.

858
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,052
- I need you to sign this, please?

859
00:44:21,052 --> 00:44:21,893
- [Christine] Oh, what is it?

860
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:23,293
- It's a court order, Ma'am.

861
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:28,293
(birds chirping)
(placid music)

862
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:44,117
- "Walter Mason Whitney
shall be entitled to no less

863
00:44:44,117 --> 00:44:48,203
"than two unsupervised visits
with Kevin William Winslow,

864
00:44:49,077 --> 00:44:51,147
"pending full hearing

865
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,700
"of above mentioned child

866
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,820
- Custody?

867
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,107
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

868
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:56,940
- Oh, what did I do?

869
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,083
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

870
00:45:00,083 --> 00:45:02,710
- I don't see why I have to go.

871
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:05,115
- So you can give Mason a chance.

872
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:06,370
- I already did.

873
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,197
- And you had a good time.

874
00:45:08,197 --> 00:45:09,347
- But you were with me.

875
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,530
- Do you think I'd let him take you

876
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,156
if I didn't think he could
take good care of you?

877
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:15,197
- No.

878
00:45:15,197 --> 00:45:16,280
- Okay, then.

879
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,633
(doorbell ringing)

880
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,990
Comb your hair.

881
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,323
- I already did.

882
00:45:22,172 --> 00:45:27,172
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

883
00:45:31,959 --> 00:45:33,203
- Did you have to get a court order?

884
00:45:33,203 --> 00:45:34,490
(birds chirping)

885
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,080
- Apparently so.

886
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,225
- Well, he doesn't wanna go.

887
00:45:37,225 --> 00:45:39,080
(birds chirping)

888
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,239
- He'll be fine.

889
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,786
(birds chirping)

890
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:43,970
- You can't force him to love you.

891
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,840
He doesn't want this.

892
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,423
- He's never had it, how would he know?

893
00:45:46,423 --> 00:45:49,173
(birds chirping)

894
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,980
Hiya, pal.

895
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,096
- Hi.

896
00:45:53,096 --> 00:45:54,220
(birds chirping)

897
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,270
- Well, give me five.

898
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:58,556
Go and have a good time, go on.

899
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:02,380
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

900
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,030
- Do you like the Rockies, Kevin?

901
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,670
- No kidding.

902
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:09,270
- Walkers on a street.
- I know.

903
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,083
- He'll be back before bedtime.

904
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,822
- I don't have to be, do I, Mom?

905
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,060
(birds chirping)

906
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,266
- Just let me know.

907
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:17,580
(birds chirping)

908
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,773
- Here.

909
00:46:18,773 --> 00:46:20,650
(birds chirping)

910
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,830
- You know, you don't have to
give me presents every time.

911
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,156
I mean, it can get expensive.

912
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:26,989
- Oh.

913
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:29,739
(birds chirping)

914
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:37,919
(door slamming)

915
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:42,919
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

916
00:46:44,522 --> 00:46:47,840
(crickets chirping)
(placid music)

917
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,413
- [Kevin] Zoe's lucky, you know?

918
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,490
- Why is that?

919
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:52,323
(crickets chirping)
(placid music)

920
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:54,810
- She has her mom and her dad right there.

921
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,560
- Well, there are all
kinds of families, Kevin.

922
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,343
- I know, but isn't there
anyone you wanna marry?

923
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,706
- Nobody that I love enough.

924
00:47:02,706 --> 00:47:03,910
(crickets chirping)
(placid music)

925
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,324
- Maybe you're too picky.

926
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:06,930
(crickets chirping)
(placid music)

927
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,106
- Maybe.

928
00:47:08,106 --> 00:47:08,939
(crickets chirping)
(placid music)

929
00:47:08,939 --> 00:47:11,200
We're pretty terrific, aren't we?

930
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,033
- Yeah.

931
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:14,432
Night.

932
00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:15,515
- Good night.

933
00:47:17,143 --> 00:47:18,463
Love you.
- Love you too.

934
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:22,183
(crickets chirping)
(placid music)

935
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:24,683
(car droning)

936
00:47:25,672 --> 00:47:30,672
(feet stomping)
(chattering)

937
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:35,046
(door squeaking)

938
00:47:35,046 --> 00:47:36,270
- This is a travesty!

939
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,580
- Well, if you could
have a sane conversation.

940
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,490
- [Man] Damn it, can you
just wait until we get home.

941
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,636
- I haven't had them for
Christmas in three years.

942
00:47:41,636 --> 00:47:42,469
- And the one time you did have them,

943
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:44,060
Robby came home with a 103 degrees fever.

944
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,320
- [Judge] Can you please
instruct your client?

945
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,590
- I am not his client, not
anymore, not after this.

946
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:48,894
How much are you paying him?

947
00:47:48,894 --> 00:47:50,970
- I could get a restraining
order, would you like that?

948
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,850
- They're my children!

949
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:53,994
Damn you.

950
00:47:53,994 --> 00:47:56,661
(feet stomping)

951
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:01,338
- (sighs) I am sorry.

952
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:04,480
(feet clattering)

953
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,713
You must be Kevin.

954
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:09,280
My, don't you look dapper?

955
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,740
- It was Teddy's, he's bigger
than me, so I get to keep it.

956
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,693
- Lucky you.

957
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,850
I've asked you all to come here
today without your lawyers.

958
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:24,763
I'm hoping we can resolve
this quickly without acrimony.

959
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,587
Why don't you come in?

960
00:48:31,587 --> 00:48:32,910
(phone ringing)

961
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,050
- By myself?

962
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,100
- Yeah, your mom and
dad can wait right here.

963
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,883
You and I have a lot to talk about.

964
00:48:40,128 --> 00:48:40,961
(phone ringing)

965
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:45,961
(chattering)
(feet clattering)

966
00:48:55,411 --> 00:48:56,710
(doors slamming)

967
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,127
(chattering)

968
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,360
- Kevin means everything
in the world to me.

969
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,570
- I understand that.

970
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:12,701
- You know he was premature?

971
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,970
Did you know he wasn't expected to live?

972
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:18,803
- Yes.

973
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,750
- Six surgeries in the first year.

974
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:24,600
You didn't even want a healthy child.

975
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,723
I can't imagine you'd
have wanted a sick one.

976
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,680
- Well, I can see I've
failed your character test

977
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,580
even before I had a chance to take it.

978
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,793
I loved Sherry, but I
was pushing my business.

979
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,550
I didn't think I could give a family

980
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:45,800
the time or attention that they deserved.

981
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,430
But I want Kevin to
understand that I'm here,

982
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:50,650
whether he likes me or not.

983
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:53,840
And if it takes him 20 years to adjust,

984
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,390
he's gonna know he's got
a father who gives a damn.

985
00:49:57,727 --> 00:50:00,394
(phone ringing)

986
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,133
Hold on a sec.

987
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,690
You know, from what I understand,

988
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,373
before Kevin landed in your lap,

989
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,473
you were no stranger to
cellphones and beepers.

990
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,673
And you never made a
commitment to anybody.

991
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:25,283
Yeah?

992
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,720
- They'll be out in a minute, Kevin.

993
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,620
So, you're each seeking custody.

994
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,920
- [Christine] Yes.
- Yes.

995
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,690
- Well, there's usually two
options in a case like this.

996
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:48,130
I could give one of you the school year,

997
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,720
the other vacations.

998
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,160
Or I could rule in favor

999
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,030
of six months here with you, Ms. Winslow,

1000
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,393
and six months in
California with you, Sir.

1001
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,550
- That isn't acceptable at all.

1002
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,950
Well, Kevin shouldn't be uprooted

1003
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:01,160
and dragged back and forth.

1004
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,200
- No one's asked for Kevin
to be dragged anywhere.

1005
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,150
I'm his father,

1006
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,210
his mother wanted him to
be with me all the time.

1007
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:08,980
You can see for yourself in her letter.

1008
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,440
- I've read the letter, Mr. Whitney.

1009
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,460
You have a very strong case.

1010
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,500
Frankly, so does Ms. Winslow.

1011
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,233
I'm trying to play Solomon here.

1012
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,240
Kevin isn't at all
interested in split custody,

1013
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,190
and I'm inclined to agree with him.

1014
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:24,860
He knows exactly how
he'd like to settle this.

1015
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,693
- He does?

1016
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:31,203
- He wants you to get married.

1017
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:34,203
- Married?

1018
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,710
- He even went so far as to ask

1019
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:39,610
if I could throw you in jail,
Mr. Whitney, if you refused.

1020
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:45,247
- You mean he actually thinks
that we should live together?

1021
00:51:45,247 --> 00:51:46,980
- No, he was quite clear.

1022
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,752
He said married.

1023
00:51:48,752 --> 00:51:50,980
- Well, I hope you told
him how ludicrous that was.

1024
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,683
- Trust me, your Honor, Ma'am,

1025
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,010
we're not really romantically involved.

1026
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,803
- I am aware of that, Mr. Whitney,

1027
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,320
but it wasn't so long
ago that men and women

1028
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,310
took a common sense approach to marriage.

1029
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,200
It was a legal and spiritual friendship.

1030
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,480
Couples didn't feel they had
to be Romeo and Juliette,

1031
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,930
just two people committed
to making a secure life

1032
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:16,870
for each other and their children.

1033
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:18,370
- Well, we've come a long way since then.

1034
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,693
- Oh, we certainly have.

1035
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,340
Nowadays, you people
are running to the altar

1036
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,870
with stars in your eyes,

1037
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,370
expecting violins for
the rest of your lives.

1038
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,470
And when the music stops,
you turn on each other,

1039
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:30,723
my God, do you turn on each other.

1040
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,453
I cannot order you to do such a thing.

1041
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:43,310
But at least you'd have
realistic expectations.

1042
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,733
You could give a nice
little boy a happy home.

1043
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,800
Marriages have been based
on a lot less than that.

1044
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,050
- We don't even live in the same city.

1045
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,600
- I mentioned that.

1046
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,660
He seems to think

1047
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,550
his mother's freelance
advertising business

1048
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,600
wouldn't suffer from being in Sacramento.

1049
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,753
He mentioned the internet,
email, fax machine.

1050
00:53:01,753 --> 00:53:04,836
(Christine laughing)

1051
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,370
- I guess I just don't
this is funny (laughs).

1052
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,857
- Your Honor, I would
give up my life for Kevin,

1053
00:53:16,857 --> 00:53:19,890
but this is completely ridiculous.

1054
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:24,370
- And I would give up every
cent I've ever made for him.

1055
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:25,203
But she's right.

1056
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,130
- Well, if you'd give up your life

1057
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,980
and you'd give up your fortune,

1058
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,830
what's so hard about getting married?

1059
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:39,030
Look, folks, I am due in
court in about two minutes.

1060
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,450
I think you should give Kevin's notion

1061
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,890
some serious consideration.

1062
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,053
He sees this as the best
of all possible worlds.

1063
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:48,930
And I am going to be making my decision

1064
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,501
before we leave this room today.

1065
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:53,300
(placid music)

1066
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,013
One of you could end up a very big loser.

1067
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:58,596
(placid music)

1068
00:54:12,864 --> 00:54:15,364
(car droning)

1069
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:17,720
- [Christine] Well, she's not
gonna go for joint custody.

1070
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,553
- I know.

1071
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,264
- I mean, even living together, even then.

1072
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:22,494
- I wouldn't do that.

1073
00:54:22,494 --> 00:54:23,690
You know, that would be like lying,

1074
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:25,770
send him all the wrong messages.

1075
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,410
- Oh, please, spare me the family values.

1076
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:30,630
- Well, this whole thing's absurd.

1077
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,653
- Thanks a lot.

1078
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:36,910
- You're not so sure you're
gonna win this, are ya?

1079
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,110
- I'll appeal 'til I do.

1080
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:42,430
You're not so sure you're
gonna win either, are you?

1081
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,290
- Well, I'll match ya,

1082
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,190
appeal for appeal.
- Good,

1083
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,030
then I'll meet you in court.

1084
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,143
- Fine.
- Fine.

1085
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,327
- I don't know (clears throat).

1086
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,310
Do you think we could live under one roof

1087
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,170
if we had separate
quarters, I mean, you know,

1088
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:03,023
maybe we could make some
kind of an arrangement?

1089
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:05,880
- We couldn't even make
it through one afternoon

1090
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,713
in the park.

1091
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:10,350
- Yeah, you're right, yeah.

1092
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,373
Forget that.

1093
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:20,880
I mean, the trick is is to come
up with something very clear

1094
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,880
in the beginning so we know
what to expect from each other.

1095
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
Like the Judge said.

1096
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,507
- You're not seriously considering--

1097
00:55:29,507 --> 00:55:31,060
- Well, no, no, no, of course not,

1098
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,913
but you gotta admit, it is logical.

1099
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,090
I mean, my house is big.

1100
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,730
You can have complete
privacy, a suite, really.

1101
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:45,073
There's a sitting room,
a bedroom, an office.

1102
00:55:45,073 --> 00:55:47,550
We'd never have to see each other.

1103
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,880
And there's a great room for Kevin,

1104
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,513
and the yard is wonderful.

1105
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,863
This way, nobody loses.

1106
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,440
- I'd never take your money.

1107
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,080
- No, I'd only help with Kevin.

1108
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,200
- Help, that's the operative word.

1109
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,203
- Absolutely, I'll help.

1110
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,713
- And I'd want a prenuptial agreement.

1111
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:12,018
- Why?

1112
00:56:12,018 --> 00:56:12,940
You don't have anything (laughs).

1113
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,400
- Well, I'd wanna be sure
that you didn't think

1114
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,900
that I wanted anything, either.

1115
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,733
- Oh.

1116
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,310
- I suppose it would be best for him,

1117
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:24,822
and that's the bottom line, isn't it?

1118
00:56:24,822 --> 00:56:25,963
- Mm-hm, yup.

1119
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:28,202
- I mean, if we could make this work,

1120
00:56:28,202 --> 00:56:31,267
he'd have a real family.

1121
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:34,010
- And if we couldn't
make it work, who could?

1122
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:37,170
We're both professionals,
we're highly motivated,

1123
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:40,170
we're successful negotiators,
and like the Judge said,

1124
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,293
for Kevin, hey, it's
the best of all worlds.

1125
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:47,771
(placid music)

1126
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:52,156
- I just...

1127
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,936
I just don't know if I could do this.

1128
00:56:55,936 --> 00:56:58,519
(placid music)

1129
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,000
- Are you out of your mind?
- I hope not.

1130
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,830
- You can't make a decision
like this in five minutes.

1131
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,947
- It wasn't five minutes,
it was more like 20.

1132
00:57:11,947 --> 00:57:15,160
(birds chirping)

1133
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,360
What if he won't go through with it?

1134
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,370
- Then that would mean he
has a little more sense

1135
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,710
than you do.

1136
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,060
- Mother, you're just making things worse.

1137
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,480
You think I know if I'm
doing the right thing?

1138
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,580
Well, I don't, so why can't
you be more supportive?

1139
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,770
- [Mother] Oh my god.

1140
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:29,670
- What's going on?

1141
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,740
- I'm getting married.

1142
00:57:33,718 --> 00:57:34,630
- What?

1143
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:36,790
- You heard me, and don't
try to change my mind.

1144
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:39,110
- [Molly] To him?
- Yes.

1145
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:42,030
- My God.
- That's what I said.

1146
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,730
- But you're not in love with him.

1147
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,463
- Well, that has nothing to do with it.

1148
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:52,773
How do I look?

1149
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,010
- You look like you could be making

1150
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,683
the biggest mistake of your life.

1151
00:57:58,920 --> 00:57:59,753
- Thanks a lot.

1152
00:58:03,794 --> 00:58:04,627
Well, are you coming?

1153
00:58:04,627 --> 00:58:07,294
(clock ticking)

1154
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:16,740
(placid music)

1155
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:18,162
- May I have the ring, please?

1156
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:23,162
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1157
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,960
With the power vested in me
by the state of Colorado,

1158
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,005
I now pronounce you husband,
and wife, and child.

1159
00:58:52,005 --> 00:58:53,560
(placid music)

1160
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,513
Believe me when I say, I think
you're doing the right thing.

1161
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:58,400
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1162
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,527
- Thank you.

1163
00:58:59,527 --> 00:59:04,527
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1164
00:59:05,955 --> 00:59:07,715
- Good idea, Kevin.

1165
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,384
- Yeah, it is.

1166
00:59:09,384 --> 00:59:12,533
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1167
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:14,715
Now, you may kiss the bride.

1168
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:19,715
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1169
00:59:30,064 --> 00:59:30,897
- Well.

1170
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:35,705
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1171
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:39,024
(traffic droning)
(thunder droning)

1172
00:59:39,024 --> 00:59:40,963
- A marriage of convenience?

1173
00:59:42,024 --> 00:59:46,130
(laughs) Who are you, the czar of Russia?

1174
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,063
- I know it sounds weird.
- Weird?

1175
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,240
No, weird is not the
word that comes to mind.

1176
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,880
I mean, one minute,
you're gonna steamroll her

1177
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,350
with the legal system, and the
next you're married to her.

1178
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,710
- Well, it's not gonna change anything.

1179
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:01,213
I mean, you and I have
an adult relationship.

1180
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,780
And Chris and I have agreed we can date

1181
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:06,646
as long as we don't bring anybody home.

1182
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:07,720
(rain splattering)

1183
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,628
- Mason, do you have any
idea how outlandish this is?

1184
01:00:12,628 --> 01:00:14,599
(rain splattering)

1185
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:15,650
- You know, I guess it does, but...

1186
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,587
- I mean, could you not
have just moved in together?

1187
01:00:18,587 --> 01:00:20,559
(rain splattering)

1188
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,130
- Well, that wasn't
the honest thing to do.

1189
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:24,445
I think being married matters to kids.

1190
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:25,720
(rain splattering)

1191
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,917
- Right.

1192
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:27,953
(rain splattering)

1193
01:00:27,953 --> 01:00:29,350
Then let me get this straight.

1194
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,090
You and I are supposed to continue to date

1195
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,570
while everyone knows that you
have a wife and child at home.

1196
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,050
- You never talked about being married.

1197
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:39,670
You like your independence.

1198
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,770
I'm not sure I understand
why you're so upset.

1199
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:47,253
I travel, you travel, we--
- We play by your rules.

1200
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,383
We always have.

1201
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,918
- Well, I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

1202
01:00:51,918 --> 01:00:56,918
(rain splattering)
(traffic droning)

1203
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,913
- We have the Ascot Ball coming up.

1204
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,090
- Yeah.

1205
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:05,550
- We're still on the
invitations as co-chairs,

1206
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,800
and everyone expects us
to be there together.

1207
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:13,670
After that, I don't wanna see you again,

1208
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,300
unless it's in a big
crowd in broad daylight.

1209
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,630
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1210
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:23,630
(rain splattering)
(thunder droning)

1211
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:29,049
(door slamming)
(thunder droning)

1212
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:33,870
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1213
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:38,870
(placid music)
(car droning)

1214
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,358
- Do they let you ride your bike here?

1215
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:52,550
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1216
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:53,383
- Sure.

1217
01:01:53,383 --> 01:01:58,383
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1218
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,110
- Hey, Mom, there's the moving truck.

1219
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:08,377
They're here before us.

1220
01:02:08,377 --> 01:02:13,377
(placid music)
(car droning)

1221
01:02:20,897 --> 01:02:23,480
(placid music)

1222
01:02:25,953 --> 01:02:26,786
(placid music)
(car door slamming)

1223
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:31,498
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1224
01:02:31,498 --> 01:02:32,581
It's a castle.

1225
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:34,511
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1226
01:02:34,511 --> 01:02:36,460
I didn't know my dad was so rich.

1227
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,230
I mean, it's too big.

1228
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:40,750
- Hey, you have all your own things.

1229
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,620
I'll make your room just
the way you want it.

1230
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:43,801
Exactly like at home.

1231
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:48,801
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1232
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:51,234
(door squeaking)

1233
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:54,283
- Hello, you made good
time, hey Kevin, I'm Will.

1234
01:02:54,283 --> 01:02:55,116
- Hi.

1235
01:02:55,116 --> 01:02:58,201
- Come on in, like they
say, home sweet home.

1236
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:00,850
(birds chirping)

1237
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:02,540
Please take the bags to the rooms, please.

1238
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,290
(birds chirping)

1239
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:10,500
- So, I lied, it's not exactly like home.

1240
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,456
- You made it.

1241
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:17,206
(birds chirping)

1242
01:03:25,383 --> 01:03:27,070
- [Kevin] Hey, Dad.
- How was the trip?

1243
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,463
- It was fine.

1244
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:32,713
- Will, why don't you take
Kevin outside to meet Twister?

1245
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,830
- Who's Twister?

1246
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,332
- You'll see.
- Come on.

1247
01:03:36,332 --> 01:03:39,082
(birds chirping)

1248
01:03:47,193 --> 01:03:48,970
(pony snorting)

1249
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:50,454
- [Kevin] Oh, wow, a pony.

1250
01:03:50,454 --> 01:03:53,204
(birds chirping)

1251
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,530
- I brought you something, too.

1252
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,014
- What for?

1253
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:01,395
- Well, just to say welcome, I guess.

1254
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:04,312
(package rustling)

1255
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:08,103
It's Ojibwe.

1256
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:11,854
- I know.

1257
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:14,540
- The store said it was
an authentic reproduction.

1258
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:15,701
Isn't that an oxymoron?

1259
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:17,620
(birds chirping)

1260
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,029
- Still, it's very thoughtful of you.

1261
01:04:19,029 --> 01:04:20,110
(birds chirping)

1262
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,310
- Yeah, well, that's me.

1263
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:24,040
- Listen, about the pony--
- Yeah, yeah,

1264
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,240
he loves it, doesn't he?

1265
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:28,990
I filled out an
application at Silver Oaks.

1266
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,598
I don't think there'd be a
problem for him to get in.

1267
01:04:31,598 --> 01:04:33,200
(birds chirping)

1268
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,690
- Kevin doesn't go to a private school.

1269
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,820
- Well, I know, but not in Denver.

1270
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:39,611
It's different here, it's
overcrowded, understaffed.

1271
01:04:39,611 --> 01:04:40,980
- No.

1272
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,890
- We don't have a choice in this city.

1273
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:45,900
- I have a choice, he
stays in public school.

1274
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,350
I volunteer, you volunteer.

1275
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:50,023
That why his class won't
be so understaffed.

1276
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,650
The reason the schools
are in such bad shape

1277
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:56,030
is because parents like us take
our kids out, I won't do it.

1278
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,090
- That's charming.

1279
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,740
This is about Kevin's education

1280
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:01,297
and you're busy saving
the damned school system.

1281
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:02,130
(birds chirping)

1282
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,520
We'll discuss this later.

1283
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,060
- Oh, we will?

1284
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,690
I don't think so.

1285
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,320
- I'm going to Taiwan on the 20th.

1286
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,513
Maybe we can have a rational
conversation when I get back.

1287
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,640
- I presume you'll stay in
touch while you're in Taiwan.

1288
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,440
I mean, if you're to be
a real part of his life,

1289
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,200
he'll need more than a
few hours with you a week.

1290
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,633
- Give me a little credit.

1291
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:25,170
- I did, but I didn't
think I'd need to tell you

1292
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,523
not to buy him a pony.

1293
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,760
Kevin is not spoiled, he does choirs,

1294
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,170
he saves up for special things,

1295
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,410
and I want it to stay that way.

1296
01:05:33,410 --> 01:05:36,750
- Maybe I ought to go upstairs
and come back down again.

1297
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,600
- Not a bad idea.

1298
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:43,603
(placid music)
(dog barking)

1299
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:52,233
(birds chirping)

1300
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,840
- Hey, good morning, you find everything?

1301
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,360
- We did, thank you.

1302
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,710
- Yeah, one thing, though.

1303
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:04,236
- Your mom doesn't let
you have sugar cereal.

1304
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:05,340
- [Kevin] How'd you know that?

1305
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,590
- Ah, just a lucky guess.

1306
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,770
Hey, what would you like to do today?

1307
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,970
I'm not going into the
office 'til after lunch.

1308
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,430
We can do anything you
wanna do in Sacramento.

1309
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:16,240
Anything you want, what do you say?

1310
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,260
- I say roller blading.
- What?

1311
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,820
- Kevin, your father doesn't
know how to roller blade.

1312
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:23,670
- No, I can do it, I'm a quick study.

1313
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,383
- Can mom come too?

1314
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:27,280
She's a great roller blader.

1315
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,820
- Yeah, sure.

1316
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,593
- I think he'd prefer to have a guys' day.

1317
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:33,933
- No, he wouldn't.
- No, it's cool.

1318
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,692
- Oh, just for an hour.

1319
01:06:38,692 --> 01:06:40,452
(cereal crunching)

1320
01:06:40,452 --> 01:06:45,452
(placid music)
(chattering)

1321
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,450
- Is he having fun yet?

1322
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:53,135
- Oh, you're not buckled up right.

1323
01:06:53,135 --> 01:06:58,135
(placid music)
(chattering)

1324
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,640
Have you ever skated?

1325
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,432
- Skated, yeah, back in '68.

1326
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:05,204
(placid music)
(chattering)

1327
01:07:05,204 --> 01:07:07,440
- You have your wrist guards
on the wrong way around.

1328
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,456
- Mm?

1329
01:07:08,456 --> 01:07:09,289
Oh.

1330
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:14,289
(placid music)
(Velcro ripping)

1331
01:07:18,054 --> 01:07:23,054
(placid music)
(chattering)

1332
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:32,224
Thanks.

1333
01:07:32,224 --> 01:07:35,123
(placid music)
(chattering)

1334
01:07:35,123 --> 01:07:37,259
- You're a good sport,
Mason, I'll give you that.

1335
01:07:37,259 --> 01:07:38,230
(Mason chuckling)

1336
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,893
But I'll deny it if you ever
tell anyone I complimented you.

1337
01:07:40,893 --> 01:07:41,989
- I wouldn't dare.

1338
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:44,567
(placid music)
(chattering)

1339
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:47,441
- Well, let's get you up, nice and easy.

1340
01:07:47,441 --> 01:07:48,850
(placid music)
(chattering)

1341
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:50,012
Easy.

1342
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:51,667
(placid music)
(chattering)

1343
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,010
Now, get your balance, push
off with your back foot,

1344
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,050
lean forward.

1345
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,550
That's it, keep going.

1346
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:59,019
- [Kevin] Hey, Dad!

1347
01:07:59,019 --> 01:07:59,852
- Hey.

1348
01:07:59,852 --> 01:08:01,301
(placid music)

1349
01:08:01,301 --> 01:08:02,134
- Like this.

1350
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:07,030
(placid music)
(roller blades grinding)

1351
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:08,413
- Oh, I get it.

1352
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:09,812
- Kevin, stay where I can see you!

1353
01:08:09,812 --> 01:08:12,040
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1354
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,260
- You go ahead, I'll catch up.

1355
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,032
(placid music)
(chattering)

1356
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:16,221
- You sure?

1357
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,054
- Yeah.

1358
01:08:17,054 --> 01:08:19,990
(placid music)
(chattering)

1359
01:08:19,990 --> 01:08:21,084
Enjoy yourself.

1360
01:08:21,084 --> 01:08:22,830
(placid music)
(chattering)

1361
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,663
I am.

1362
01:08:23,663 --> 01:08:25,544
(placid music)
(chattering)

1363
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:28,333
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1364
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,680
You know what?

1365
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,513
- What?

1366
01:08:30,513 --> 01:08:31,346
(placid music)

1367
01:08:31,346 --> 01:08:33,510
- I'm really glad you're here.

1368
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,167
- Me too.

1369
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:37,090
Aren't you, Mom?

1370
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:37,923
- Aren't I what?

1371
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,913
- Glad we're here.

1372
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:42,424
- I am if you are.

1373
01:08:42,424 --> 01:08:46,083
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1374
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:46,916
- Night, buddy.

1375
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,680
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1376
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:51,973
- Yeah, I like it when
you call me that, too.

1377
01:08:51,973 --> 01:08:52,806
Buddy.

1378
01:08:52,806 --> 01:08:57,806
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1379
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,099
He made me floss.

1380
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,501
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1381
01:09:05,501 --> 01:09:07,421
I didn't tell him I hate to.

1382
01:09:07,421 --> 01:09:08,254
- Good for you.

1383
01:09:08,254 --> 01:09:10,264
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1384
01:09:10,264 --> 01:09:12,847
(placid music)

1385
01:09:15,437 --> 01:09:16,965
- He's a great kid.

1386
01:09:16,965 --> 01:09:18,320
(placid music)

1387
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,445
- I think so.

1388
01:09:19,445 --> 01:09:20,970
(placid music)

1389
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,533
- You've done a terrific job.

1390
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,697
- [Christine] Thank you.

1391
01:09:25,697 --> 01:09:27,630
- I only hope I don't screw it up.

1392
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:28,700
- Hey, you got him to floss,

1393
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,347
it's more than I could do (laughs).

1394
01:09:32,184 --> 01:09:33,017
(placid music)

1395
01:09:33,017 --> 01:09:34,690
- You wanna watch a movie sometime?

1396
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:36,380
(placid music)

1397
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,601
I mean, after he's in bed.

1398
01:09:37,601 --> 01:09:38,600
(placid music)

1399
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,941
I got a lotta tapes.

1400
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:41,950
(placid music)

1401
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:42,908
- I don't know.

1402
01:09:42,908 --> 01:09:46,302
(placid music)

1403
01:09:46,302 --> 01:09:48,270
- Yeah, probably a bad idea.

1404
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:49,730
- Well, I didn't say that.

1405
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,770
- Yeah, but you're probably thinking it.

1406
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,662
(placid music)

1407
01:09:53,662 --> 01:09:54,692
And you're probably right.

1408
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:59,692
(placid music)
(feet thumping)

1409
01:10:01,241 --> 01:10:03,090
(placid music)

1410
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:06,060
- Tell Laurie I expect to
have to copy to him by Friday.

1411
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,860
I'll load in the specs and
overnight the elements.

1412
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,260
There won't be any lag time.

1413
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,270
Well, tell him not to
have such long lunches.

1414
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,403
I'll speak to you later.
(phone slamming)

1415
01:10:16,403 --> 01:10:21,403
(dog barking)
(car droning)

1416
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:24,008
(placid music)

1417
01:10:27,072 --> 01:10:30,001
- Oh my God.

1418
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:30,834
(placid music)

1419
01:10:30,834 --> 01:10:33,410
- Hi, Grandma.
- Oh, hi sweetheart.

1420
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:36,214
Here, give me a hug, how are you?

1421
01:10:36,214 --> 01:10:37,464
- [Kevin] Good.

1422
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,235
- Well, this is amazing.

1423
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,747
(placid music)

1424
01:10:41,747 --> 01:10:43,686
Are you having fun?
- Yeah.

1425
01:10:43,686 --> 01:10:46,269
(placid music)

1426
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:54,611
(car droning)
(placid music)

1427
01:10:56,803 --> 01:10:57,636
(car door slamming)
(placid music)

1428
01:10:57,636 --> 01:10:59,053
Robbie.

1429
01:10:59,053 --> 01:10:59,886
- Hey, Kev.

1430
01:10:59,886 --> 01:11:01,540
- [Kevin] I wanna show
my dad your gerbils.

1431
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,722
- [Robbie] Yeah, sure.

1432
01:11:02,722 --> 01:11:05,139
(chattering)

1433
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:07,390
- That one's Oscar.

1434
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:08,730
(chattering)

1435
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:10,323
Guess what the other one's name is.

1436
01:11:10,323 --> 01:11:13,420
(chattering)

1437
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:14,604
- Couldn't be Felix?

1438
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:15,790
(chattering)

1439
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:16,986
- No, it's Mayer.

1440
01:11:16,986 --> 01:11:19,174
(children laughing)
Get it?

1441
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:20,583
- I get it.
- Oscar Mayer.

1442
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:21,416
- Uh-huh.

1443
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:23,200
(school bell ringing)

1444
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,273
- [Robby] We've gotta go.
- See you inside.

1445
01:11:24,273 --> 01:11:26,960
(chattering)

1446
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,050
- Well, you've gotta go, buddy.

1447
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:30,570
- Don't kiss me, okay?

1448
01:11:31,548 --> 01:11:32,767
(chattering)

1449
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:34,060
- I wouldn't do that.

1450
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,229
So, five me.

1451
01:11:35,229 --> 01:11:37,965
(chattering)

1452
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:39,230
All right, you have a good day, huh?

1453
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:40,063
- [Kevin] See ya.
- See ya.

1454
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:42,362
(chattering)

1455
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:50,680
- So far 200 have sent
checks and reservations,

1456
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:53,780
and another 40 have just sent checks.

1457
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:56,210
- All I know is the hotel
needs a final figure

1458
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,200
a couple of days before.

1459
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,210
- So, maybe we ought to start

1460
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,220
doing phone follow ups
tomorrow instead of Thursday.

1461
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,150
- Mm-hm.
- Oh,

1462
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:04,780
I almost forget.

1463
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,680
Jerry Erwin from Silver Oaks called

1464
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,630
and they were trying to feel out

1465
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,650
how much they could rely
on from you this year.

1466
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:12,483
- Maybe nothing.

1467
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,890
- Why not?

1468
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:16,940
- Well, Kevin's not going to Silver Oaks.

1469
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,500
- But it's the best school in the city.

1470
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,480
- Yeah, well, Kevin's a
different kind of kid.

1471
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,500
Chris thinks that he'll
never be into cotillion

1472
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,020
and field hockey, or whatever
the hell they do there.

1473
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:29,853
- She doesn't?

1474
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,193
So, what's the alternative?

1475
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:36,623
- Public school.

1476
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:42,727
- You're really getting
off on this, aren't you?

1477
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:44,903
- Maybe.

1478
01:12:48,950 --> 01:12:49,837
- I miss you.

1479
01:12:53,835 --> 01:12:55,830
You know, I've thought a
lot about what you said,

1480
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,380
and I think I would like to try

1481
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:02,063
this dating thing for a while.

1482
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:06,670
No reason you can't stay
over every so often.

1483
01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:08,960
- I wouldn't do that, Elizabeth.

1484
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,283
Listen, it's one thing when I
have to go away on business.

1485
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,270
It's another for Kevin
to ask me where I've been

1486
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:17,950
when I can't tell him the truth.

1487
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:20,367
(chattering)

1488
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:30,763
- You know,

1489
01:13:31,947 --> 01:13:35,091
I plan to dazzle you with
fancy footwork at the ball.

1490
01:13:35,091 --> 01:13:37,350
(chattering)

1491
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:38,513
And more.

1492
01:13:38,513 --> 01:13:40,930
(chattering)

1493
01:13:43,529 --> 01:13:48,529
(placid music)
(papers rustling)

1494
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:51,055
- Hi, it's Chris.

1495
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:52,120
(placid music)

1496
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,751
- Hi, come on in.

1497
01:13:53,751 --> 01:13:56,334
(placid music)

1498
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:00,644
- Mozart?
- Yeah,

1499
01:14:01,962 --> 01:14:03,962
it keeps me centered.

1500
01:14:03,962 --> 01:14:06,760
(placid music)

1501
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,230
- You have to eat.

1502
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:11,263
It wasn't so bad, sometimes
I even amaze myself.

1503
01:14:11,263 --> 01:14:12,096
(placid music)

1504
01:14:12,096 --> 01:14:13,434
- Oh, and modest too, huh?

1505
01:14:13,434 --> 01:14:14,922
(placid music)

1506
01:14:14,922 --> 01:14:15,755
Thanks.

1507
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:17,263
(placid music)

1508
01:14:17,263 --> 01:14:19,690
- It is a little strange
eating dinner downstairs,

1509
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,858
knowing that you're up
here all by yourself.

1510
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:23,130
(placid music)

1511
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,430
Is that a problem for you?

1512
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,290
- Well, I wasn't gonna say anything,

1513
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,420
but it does feel a little awkward.

1514
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,700
(placid music)

1515
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,533
I was wondering if you'd mind

1516
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:33,232
if Kevin came up here and
eat with me once in a while.

1517
01:14:33,232 --> 01:14:34,740
(placid music)

1518
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:35,573
- Well, I'd bet he'd prefer it

1519
01:14:35,573 --> 01:14:37,073
if you came downstairs with us.

1520
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:38,852
(placid music)

1521
01:14:38,852 --> 01:14:41,480
- I think that feels just
a little too hubby wifey,

1522
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:42,580
don't you?

1523
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,172
Kinda like watching a movie together.

1524
01:14:45,172 --> 01:14:47,891
(placid music)

1525
01:14:47,891 --> 01:14:48,724
- Touché,

1526
01:14:48,724 --> 01:14:51,121
(placid music)

1527
01:14:51,121 --> 01:14:54,222
Well, have a nice trip.
- Thanks, oh, Chris.

1528
01:14:54,222 --> 01:14:56,750
(placid music)

1529
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:00,613
I'm gonna call him from Taiwan every day.

1530
01:15:00,613 --> 01:15:03,196
(placid music)

1531
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,797
Thanks.

1532
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:08,380
(placid music)

1533
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:21,216
- Mm.

1534
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:23,343
(placid music)

1535
01:15:23,343 --> 01:15:26,620
- Ugh, so when are you coming back?

1536
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,763
- Oh, next Saturday.

1537
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:30,653
But you save Sunday for me, will ya?

1538
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:32,723
- Okay.

1539
01:15:33,749 --> 01:15:36,260
Maybe you and me and mom can
go to the movies or something.

1540
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:37,093
- The movies?

1541
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,370
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

1542
01:15:39,370 --> 01:15:42,120
(zipper hissing)

1543
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:51,973
- What's an Ascot Ball?

1544
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:58,050
- Ascot Ball, well, it's a
very big party with dancing.

1545
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:03,240
(bag thumping)

1546
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,580
- Like in Cinderella?

1547
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:07,180
- Yeah, but there's not a
lotta princes hanging out.

1548
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,263
I gotta run, pal.

1549
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:11,740
I'll call ya tomorrow, okay?

1550
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:18,741
(placid music)

1551
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,897
- Almost bed time.

1552
01:16:30,897 --> 01:16:32,300
(placid music)

1553
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,088
- Wanna read Jumanji again?
- That sounds good.

1554
01:16:35,088 --> 01:16:37,671
(placid music)

1555
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,270
What's this?

1556
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,457
- Your invitation to
the Ball Saturday night.

1557
01:16:43,457 --> 01:16:44,310
(placid music)

1558
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:45,620
- Well, where did you get this?

1559
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,839
- From Dad, it's for you.

1560
01:16:47,839 --> 01:16:50,422
(placid music)

1561
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,637
I'll go get Jumanji.

1562
01:16:54,637 --> 01:16:57,220
(placid music)

1563
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:13,798
- Oh, Mason would be mortified

1564
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,510
if he knew you were gonna
show up in a used gown.

1565
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:21,140
- [Christine] They're not used,
they're previously driven.

1566
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,940
- Christine, this is not a joke.

1567
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,580
- Look, I haven't bought an evening gown

1568
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,110
since Regan was in the White House.

1569
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:28,763
This is what I can afford.

1570
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:32,933
- Well, passable.

1571
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:35,983
But just barely.

1572
01:17:35,983 --> 01:17:38,530
(crickets chirping)

1573
01:17:38,530 --> 01:17:39,670
- I know.

1574
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:41,323
- Something with a little more.

1575
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,023
- Panache, you're right.

1576
01:17:45,222 --> 01:17:46,055
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1577
01:17:46,055 --> 01:17:47,213
- Chris?

1578
01:17:47,213 --> 01:17:48,890
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1579
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:52,449
You do want to do, don't you?

1580
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:54,610
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1581
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:56,030
- Yes, very much.

1582
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:01,030
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1583
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,333
- Wow, you look beautiful.

1584
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,295
- Thanks.

1585
01:18:10,295 --> 01:18:11,390
(placid music)

1586
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,730
- Well, if your dad
doesn't come pretty soon,

1587
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,328
I may have to go to the party with you.

1588
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:16,161
- Nah.

1589
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:19,352
(placid music)

1590
01:18:19,352 --> 01:18:24,352
(phone ringing)
(placid music)

1591
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:27,737
- Hello?

1592
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:28,700
(crickets chirping)

1593
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,260
Oh, yes, Mason, of course she's here.

1594
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,950
She's dressing.

1595
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:36,720
- [Mason] Well, don't bother
her, my plane was late.

1596
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,800
I'm going straight to the hotel.

1597
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,303
- All right, I'll tell her.
- [Mason] Thanks.

1598
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,200
- Mason, have a lovely evening.

1599
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,077
- [Mason] I will, good night.
- Good night.

1600
01:18:49,077 --> 01:18:51,820
(crickets chirping)

1601
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:52,653
Chris?

1602
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:57,350
Mason called, his plane just got in.

1603
01:18:57,350 --> 01:18:58,440
He's going right to the ball.

1604
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,710
You'll have to meet him there.

1605
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:02,130
- Oh, finally, I was beginning to wonder.

1606
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:06,446
- Oh, you look so beautiful.

1607
01:19:06,446 --> 01:19:08,190
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1608
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:09,410
- Really?

1609
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,370
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1610
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:12,849
- I already told her, she
doesn't believe me either.

1611
01:19:12,849 --> 01:19:15,441
(placid music)
(women laughing)

1612
01:19:15,441 --> 01:19:17,741
(placid music)

1613
01:19:17,741 --> 01:19:22,741
(car droning)
(placid music)

1614
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:33,583
- Good evening.

1615
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:37,750
- Can you direct me to the ballroom?

1616
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,100
- Second level, but the Ascot
Ball is there this evening.

1617
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,243
- I know.

1618
01:19:42,243 --> 01:19:47,243
(heels clicking)
(chattering)

1619
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:52,799
(door slamming)
(car droning)

1620
01:19:55,167 --> 01:19:59,647
(placid music)
(chattering)

1621
01:19:59,647 --> 01:20:00,887
- May I help you?

1622
01:20:00,887 --> 01:20:02,375
- I'm meeting my husband.

1623
01:20:02,375 --> 01:20:03,930
- May I see your invitation?

1624
01:20:03,930 --> 01:20:05,312
- Oh, I didn't bring it.

1625
01:20:05,312 --> 01:20:06,960
(placid music)

1626
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,940
- Perhaps you have the wrong
hotel or the wrong room.

1627
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:13,527
May I have your name?
- Whitney, Mason Whitney.

1628
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:18,527
(placid music)
(chattering)

1629
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,340
- Are you Ms. Fennaway?

1630
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,346
- No, I'm Mrs. Whitney.

1631
01:20:38,346 --> 01:20:40,040
(placid music)
(chattering)

1632
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,735
Excuse me, I'll find him myself.

1633
01:20:41,735 --> 01:20:46,735
(placid music)
(chattering)

1634
01:20:56,632 --> 01:20:58,140
- My, I don't know who that is,

1635
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,470
but I've been dying to
turn up at this wake

1636
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:02,120
dressed like that for years.

1637
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,645
- A woman with a death wish.

1638
01:21:03,645 --> 01:21:06,300
(placid music)

1639
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,507
Chris?

1640
01:21:07,507 --> 01:21:08,421
(placid music)
- [Elizabeth] What?

1641
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:11,242
(placid music)
- It's Chris.

1642
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:13,181
(placid music)
(chattering)

1643
01:21:13,181 --> 01:21:14,014
- It can't be.

1644
01:21:14,014 --> 01:21:15,163
- It is.

1645
01:21:15,163 --> 01:21:19,150
(placid music)
(chattering)

1646
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:20,403
Excuse me.

1647
01:21:20,403 --> 01:21:25,403
(placid music)
(chattering)

1648
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,349
- [Woman] She's in red.

1649
01:21:29,349 --> 01:21:32,050
(placid music)
(chattering)

1650
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,800
- Some dress code you forgot to mention?

1651
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,870
Ascot, "My Fair Lady".

1652
01:21:35,870 --> 01:21:37,660
Oh, I get it now, but it's a little late.

1653
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,960
- What are you doing here?

1654
01:21:40,076 --> 01:21:40,909
- What do you mean?

1655
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:43,053
- Well, it's not a complex question.

1656
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,893
- Kevin gave me the invitation,
he said it was from you.

1657
01:21:47,844 --> 01:21:48,677
- He what?

1658
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:51,293
- Well, after you left for Taiwan...

1659
01:21:51,293 --> 01:21:52,840
(placid music)
(chattering)

1660
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,747
- Oh, oh, well, hi.
- Hi.

1661
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,313
- Christine, I'm Elizabeth.

1662
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:00,979
I've been hoping to meet you.

1663
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:03,848
(placid music)
(chattering)

1664
01:22:03,848 --> 01:22:05,633
- Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1665
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,223
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1666
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:13,223
(placid music)
(chattering)

1667
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:19,070
- Kevin, you know, he must have...

1668
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,460
- Hurry up, you might catch her

1669
01:22:22,460 --> 01:22:24,396
before she loses her glass slipper.

1670
01:22:24,396 --> 01:22:29,396
(placid music)
(chattering)

1671
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:35,612
(heels clicking)
(placid music)

1672
01:22:39,601 --> 01:22:40,610
- [Christine] Would
you get my car, please?

1673
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:41,868
- Right away.

1674
01:22:41,868 --> 01:22:44,451
(placid music)

1675
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,553
- [Mason] Chris?

1676
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:56,533
I'm sorry,

1677
01:22:57,977 --> 01:22:59,862
that's was unconscionably rude of me.

1678
01:22:59,862 --> 01:23:02,520
(placid music)

1679
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,011
- No, it's not your fault.

1680
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,600
(placid music)

1681
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,524
- I think Kevin is determined
to get us together.

1682
01:23:08,524 --> 01:23:09,858
(placid music)

1683
01:23:09,858 --> 01:23:11,060
- Well he wouldn't do it on purpose.

1684
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,741
- Oh, yes, he would.

1685
01:23:12,741 --> 01:23:15,324
(placid music)

1686
01:23:16,632 --> 01:23:17,465
- You think he...

1687
01:23:17,465 --> 01:23:20,048
(placid music)

1688
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,669
I wondered why you never
asked me before you left.

1689
01:23:24,669 --> 01:23:26,100
(placid music)

1690
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:28,149
- Our son has very good instincts.

1691
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:30,021
(placid music)

1692
01:23:30,021 --> 01:23:33,189
Chris, I'd like it very
much if you'd stay.

1693
01:23:33,189 --> 01:23:35,820
(placid music)

1694
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:37,550
- Please don't be gallant.
- I'm not,

1695
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:38,861
I'm being honest.

1696
01:23:38,861 --> 01:23:40,682
(placid music)

1697
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:41,874
- A little lady in red.

1698
01:23:41,874 --> 01:23:44,060
(placid music)

1699
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,014
- The lady in red is very beautiful.

1700
01:23:46,014 --> 01:23:48,597
(placid music)

1701
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:54,249
She is also my wife.

1702
01:23:54,249 --> 01:23:56,832
(placid music)

1703
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:07,681
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1704
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,573
- Does this mean you'll
teach me how to roller blade?

1705
01:24:29,573 --> 01:24:30,991
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1706
01:24:30,991 --> 01:24:32,150
Mm?
(Christine giggling)

1707
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:32,990
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1708
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:35,562
- Let's get outta here.
- Oh, yeah.

1709
01:24:35,562 --> 01:24:37,162
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1710
01:24:37,162 --> 01:24:38,662
- But I've gotta go, you know.

1711
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,990
- Go ahead.

1712
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:43,232
- Meet me at the door,
don't get lost, now.

1713
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:48,232
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1714
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:02,490
Hi.
- Hi.

1715
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:04,773
- I um...
- Don't say anything.

1716
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:07,690
I saw you dancing, it's okay.

1717
01:25:07,690 --> 01:25:08,570
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1718
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,793
- It's not okay.
- (chuckles) Mason,

1719
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,810
we've tried this for a long time.

1720
01:25:15,950 --> 01:25:17,299
It's never been right for you.

1721
01:25:17,299 --> 01:25:18,580
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1722
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:22,224
- You're being very noble.
- (chuckles) Well...

1723
01:25:22,224 --> 01:25:25,860
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1724
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,403
It's always been a long shot.

1725
01:25:27,403 --> 01:25:32,403
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1726
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,693
Go take your wife home.

1727
01:25:35,645 --> 01:25:36,478
She's a knockout.

1728
01:25:36,478 --> 01:25:41,478
(placid jazz music)
(chattering)

1729
01:25:48,696 --> 01:25:53,696
(placid music)
(crickets chirping)

1730
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:00,525
(door slamming)
(placid music)

1731
01:26:00,525 --> 01:26:01,358
- You want a drink?

1732
01:26:01,358 --> 01:26:02,447
(placid music)

1733
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:03,280
- No.

1734
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:05,863
(placid music)

1735
01:26:56,454 --> 01:27:01,454
(birds chirping)
(placid music)

1736
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,973
Mason.
- My shirt?

1737
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,002
It fits.

1738
01:27:42,002 --> 01:27:43,603
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1739
01:27:43,603 --> 01:27:44,436
- It does.

1740
01:27:44,436 --> 01:27:46,960
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1741
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,145
It all does.

1742
01:27:48,145 --> 01:27:53,145
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1743
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:55,880
I'm not a substitute for Sherry, am I?

1744
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:58,867
- I loved her.

1745
01:27:58,867 --> 01:28:00,660
(birds chirping)

1746
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:03,322
But I shied away from
commitment all my life.

1747
01:28:03,322 --> 01:28:05,640
(birds chirping)

1748
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:06,893
- Me too, until Kevin.

1749
01:28:06,893 --> 01:28:08,320
(birds chirping)

1750
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,601
- No way this is a romantic interlude.

1751
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:11,550
(birds chirping)

1752
01:28:11,550 --> 01:28:12,793
It's way past that.

1753
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:15,860
(birds chirping)
(placid music)

1754
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:18,582
- I'm willing.
- To love me?

1755
01:28:18,582 --> 01:28:20,617
(birds chirping)
(placid music)

1756
01:28:20,617 --> 01:28:21,513
- I already do.

1757
01:28:21,513 --> 01:28:23,087
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1758
01:28:23,087 --> 01:28:27,173
But my life isn't charity balls
and chauffeured limousines.

1759
01:28:28,030 --> 01:28:29,297
- Well, you've gotta
give the Porsche a try.

1760
01:28:29,297 --> 01:28:30,130
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1761
01:28:30,130 --> 01:28:34,422
- (laughs) And you?

1762
01:28:34,422 --> 01:28:37,020
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1763
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,370
- I think I fell for you way back

1764
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:41,310
when you vetoed the plastic sword.

1765
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:43,371
You were so serious.

1766
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:46,660
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1767
01:28:46,660 --> 01:28:48,217
I'm willing, too, Chris.

1768
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:52,460
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1769
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:54,150
I want you to be my wife.

1770
01:28:54,150 --> 01:28:56,380
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1771
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:57,213
- Because?

1772
01:28:57,213 --> 01:28:59,000
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1773
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,993
- Because I love you very much.

1774
01:29:01,993 --> 01:29:06,993
(placid music)
(birds chirping)

1775
01:29:35,481 --> 01:29:40,481
(water rushing)
(placid music)

1776
01:29:44,436 --> 01:29:47,893
- How much further?
- [Christine] Two miles.

1777
01:29:47,893 --> 01:29:48,726
- Two miles.

1778
01:29:48,726 --> 01:29:49,820
(water rushing)
(placid music)

1779
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:51,645
- There's a local saying

1780
01:29:51,645 --> 01:29:54,140
that if a young boy makes it
to the church of the elders,

1781
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,306
he'll return some day
with the one he loves.

1782
01:29:56,306 --> 01:30:01,306
(water rushing)
(placid music)

1783
01:30:21,738 --> 01:30:24,321
(placid music)

1784
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:15,912
(Multicom jingle)
