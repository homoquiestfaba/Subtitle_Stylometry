00:00:02,369 --> 00:00:05,404
We all have stories to tell,
       our own paths

2
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:07,339
      to faith in Christ.

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,340
Some are kookier than others

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,244
like finding Jesus in a piece
       of drift wood,

5
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,279
yeah more on that in a second,

6
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,149
   but for me I didn't see it
             coming.

7
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:18,617
I thought I was looking for a
             guy

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,552
to stick a ring on my finger,

9
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:21,653
         my Mr. Right.

10
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,290
   And along the way something
       wonderful happened.

11
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,392
          I found Him.

12
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,228
That's Him with a capital H.

13
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,475
<i> street light got that perfect</i>
         <i> glistening,</i>

14
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,311
touchdown I fall into your arms

15
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:51,417
   <i> right where I belong your</i>
       <i> everlasting arms.</i>

16
00:00:51,419 --> 00:00:57,189
And where would I be
without yo u

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,759
     I'd be packing my bags

18
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,161
      when I need to stay.

19
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,629
  I'd be chasing every breeze

20
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,830
       that blows my way.

21
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,498
   I'd be building my kingdom

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,669
  just to watch it fade away.

23
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,370
           It's true.

24
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:17,242
That's me without you, that's me
          <i> without you</i>

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,448
     that's me without you.

26
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,820
Don't know where I'd be without
             <i> you,</i>

27
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:32,825
that's me without you, that's me
         <i> without you,</i>

28
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:36,862
<i> that's me without you, without</i>
             <i> you.</i>

29
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:41,433
Don't know where I'd be without
             <i> you.</i>

30
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:47,406
that's me without you, that's me
         <i> without you,</i>

31
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:51,376
<i> that's me without you, without</i>
             <i> you.</i>

32
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,617
     Yeah? It's real good.

33
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,852
I actually took a
trip to Franc e

34
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,553
   a couple years ago. Oh, the
              wine!

35
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:06,158
Have you ever been to France?

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,826
             Ryan?

37
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:08,827
           Oh sorry.

38
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:13,132
Yeah France. No I haven't been.

39
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,666
     But I hear it's great.

40
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,667
       Love the accents.

41
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,636
It is better than great, I
      don't know how

42
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,872
  but you can eat anything you
         want there and

43
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,808
  not gain a pound, that is my
             kind of

44
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,609
            country.

45
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,644
And the wine is just to die for
           even the

46
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,247
cheap stuff oh and the Fermat
         of course.

47
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,748
       That cheese right?

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,152
I love stinky cheese, it clogs
        the pipes but

49
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:37,756
             still.

50
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,897
   You know they say the best
        cheese comes from

51
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:49,168
between French framers toes.

52
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,638
Yup that's probably why it's so
            stinky.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,373
          Incroyable.

54
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,841
       That sounds great.

55
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,910
Listen Gwinny, a friend of mine

56
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,011
        just walked in.

57
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,546
I'm just going to go say hi
        real quick.

58
00:03:00,548 --> 00:03:03,615
OK? This is great. I'll be
       right back.

59
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,617
      -Sure. -OK hold on.

60
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,719
         -Sounds good.

61
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:13,325
And it's Gwyneth not Gwinny.

62
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,438
It's so rude, the guy couldn't
           keep eye

63
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,574
contact with me for 10 seconds.

64
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,374
           Is it me?

65
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,843
   No sweetie, it's just dumb
          stupid guys.

66
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,278
Ryan is definitely not stupid

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,380
         he's a leading
       gastroenterologist.

68
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,349
Which is why he is so full of...

69
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,984
   Gwyneth he just texted me.

70
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:39,985
      He said he's sorry.

71
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,720
     It was his high school
           sweetheart.

72
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,821
He hasn't seen her in years.

73
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,089
High school sweetheart. Is that
            the one

74
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,591
that's half his age and
   half his weight?

75
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,492
We're running out of guys, our
         husbands are

76
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,428
      running out of guys.

77
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,363
Babe, if you're not careful
     your going to be

78
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,264
     the last one standing.

79
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,499
No, Ann Marie will be the last
         one standing

80
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,269
          guaranteed.

81
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,972
  I am losing here you guys, I
         feel like it's

82
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,975
one of those movies where the
           guy in

83
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,410
a little boat just drifts off
          into the

84
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,481
    horizon and then he just
           disappears.

85
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,382
             Poof!

86
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,251
I don't want to spend another
          Christmas

87
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,785
   under the mistletoe alone.

88
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,622
I just want to meet a guy that
         will look at

89
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:22,561
me for 10 seconds and smile.

90
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,532
             Sold.

91
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,539
Let's go.

92
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,607
              Dad.

93
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:13,712
      I'll be in the car.

94
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,617
          Hey Speedy.

95
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,819
What are you going to eat all
         this in one

96
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,021
              day?

97
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:25,557
   Now you can get it in one.

98
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,725
            Stop it!

99
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:27,659
        Stop being poor!

100
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:32,798
Now buy my book and join
    the one percent.

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,700
            Cheesy.

102
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:38,904

       Minute a day a new

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,875
       One minute a day.

106
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,377
It's not even the same girl.

107
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,112
  One minute a day a new you.

108
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:50,349
This is our first Christmas as
         husband and

109
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,083
             wife.

110
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,884
We met on ChristianMingle.com.

111
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,820
  From our family at Christian
          Mingle, we'd

   Joining Christian Mingle.

117
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:04,963
          No, no, no.

118
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,932
Ann Marie will be the last one
           standing

119
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,000
          guaranteed.

120
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:15,674
You've got to be kidding me.

121
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,580
30 years old and only a couple
         lousy short

122
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,950
   term relationships under my
         belt, pathetic.

123
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:28,153
  But, it wasn't for a lack of
         trying I dated.

124
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:28,987
        Boy did I date.

125
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,989
   But most of the time I was
        thinking, get me

126
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,458
     out of here before the
       appetizers arrive.

127
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,727
And I don't know maybe it was
             me.

128
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,729
Either way I was convinced that
            it was

129
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,998
         now or never.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,970
Seriously. And you know what I
            lied.

131
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:47,472
I didn't just want guy to look
          at me and

132
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,540
             smile.

133
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,875
    I wanted more than that.

134
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,611
I, I wanted a genuinely decent
             guy.

135
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:54,045
And I knew he was out there.

136
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,947
But, if I was going to find
     him , I'd had to

137
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:02,921
do something different, totally
          different.

138
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:19,938
   Happy New Year Ms. Hayden.

139
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,685
           Hey Gwen.

140
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,810
       You look terrible.

141
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,011
           I'm done.

142
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:00,879
       New year, new me.

143
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,181
I'm buying a dog or joining a
        monastery, or

144
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,985
both if they'll let me bring a
            puppy.

145
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,988
Ladies, everyone on the bridge
        in 5 minutes.

146
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,225
Got big news big, big,
big news .

147
00:08:13,227 --> 00:08:16,094
Pamela, the coffee has
   that foul taste

148
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,696
       again, dish water.

149
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,064
  Not the day for stinky Joe.

150
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:22,100
   I want you to fix it ASAP.

151
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:26,137
     Please, pretty please.

152
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:30,242
      Rodger that admiral.

153
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:34,246
     Oh, and Happy New Year
           everybody.

154
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,249
    Not today, I cannot play
       battleship with him

155
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:37,916
             today.

156
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,951
You ever think if it's the guy
         your picking

157
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:40,852
        to go out with?

158
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,721
Maybe your knocking on one door
            hoping

159
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,989
       another will open.

160
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,290
      Oh, thank you Oprah.

161
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,691
      Don't call me Oprah.

162
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,226
  Have either of you heard of

163
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:49,661
         Donny De Bona?

164
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,629
     Is that really a name?

165
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:54,566
He is the biggest name in
     direct response

166
00:08:54,568 --> 00:08:55,934
        for male beauty.

167
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,836
  Oh, you're talking about the
         infomerical guy

168
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:00,539
with, with the weird goatee.

169
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,173
              Oh.

170
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:04,075
     I am talking about the
     infomercial king, and

171
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:09,681
he is coming here today on his
         private jet.

172
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,283
He is coming in at O-1100 hours

173
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:12,817
        to meet with us.

174
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:16,121
  To discuss if he wants us to
         single-handedly

175
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:20,559
   market his newest product.

176
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,160
             Hair.

177
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,695
          As in wigs?

178
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,096
          Transplant?

179
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,598
             Hair.

180
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,799
             Hair!

181
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,733
        The real thing.

182
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,201
     He has found a cure for
            baldness.

183
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:33,204
He found a secret solution and
        he puts it in

184
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,673
       a little capsule.

185
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,874
      This is ridiculous.

186
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,309
  There's no secret solution.

187
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:39,010
      You take that back.

188
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:39,945
           I mean it.

189
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:41,279
Okay fine, I take it back but...

190
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,716
No buts. This is the
real thing .

191
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:49,754
I've done my research, I'm not
          an idiot.

192
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,722
       We are done here.

193
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,691
   I want you to assemble the
             troops.

194
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,358
        Clear the decks.

195
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,729
  I want a reception fit for a
           president.

196
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,097
         Now hurry up!

197
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:04,903
           Dismissed.

198
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,073
I can take almost anything,
       spin it into

199
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,709
gold and fool some of the
   people some of the

200
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,142
             time.

201
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,211
But, I don't care how you brand
          it, package

202
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,145
         it or sell it.

203
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,814
If God didn't give you hair,
          you aint

204
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,785
  getting hair. End of story.

205
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,088
     Ladies and gentlemen.

206
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,160
       Mr. Donny De Bona.

207
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,700
   I'm sure you don't need any
         introduction to

208
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:36,735
          Mr. De Bona.

209
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:37,802
You know him as the man who has

210
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,739
revolutionized the way modern
       men live their

211
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,740
          daily lives.

212
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,942
Now Mr. De Bona is at it again,

213
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,111
bigger and better than ever.

214
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:50,982
And from what I understand he's
          here for a

215
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,953
few days to kick our tires and
          if we pass

216
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,223
the test we will be the lucky
        firm to brand

217
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,126
and market Mr. De Bona's newest
            product

218
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,828
and if that day comes,
  then you , me, we,

219
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:08,199
   all of us will be a part of
            history.

220
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:09,768
           The story.

221
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,170
             A man.

222

276
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:24,062
        -This is wrong.
        -What's wrong?

         -Hi, I'm sorry.
       -No, no I'm sorry.

      Gwyneth Hayden. Hi.

281
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,044
I wish that I had an excuse for
            you but

282
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,180
honestly I'm just terribly with
             time

283
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:42,914
          management.

284
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,616
I mean Papa warned me it would
            be my

285
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,984
            undoing.

286
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:49,554
             -Papa?
          -Oh, My dad.

287
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,556
              Oh.

288
00:14:51,558 --> 00:15:00,198
          -Should we?
          -Yeah sure.

289
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,904
             What?

290
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:06,671
            Nothing.

291
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:07,705
    It's the photo isn't it?

292
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,041
Yeah I don't really look
    like my picture.

293
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,043
I kind of cheated on that part.

294
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:12,443
          Who doesn't?

295
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,646
Mine was from like 10 years ago
          back when I

296
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:18,549
was on my way to rock stardom.

297
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,519
             Yeah!

298
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:24,956
   You were going to be a rock
              star?

299
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,460
Well, you know, an entertainer.

300
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,429
      Oh, an entertainer.

301
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,566
      That's interesting.

302
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,502
    This is weird isn't it?

303
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,238
    It's a weird way to meet
            somebody.

304
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,407
   What a strange new world.

305
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,141
             It is.

306
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,576
It's like click, meet, marry,
         die, done.

307
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:46,945
It's a very strange new world.

308
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,380
   But the stuff between never
         really changes.

309
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:56,220
   Family, joy, a love for the
              Lord.

310
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,656
      Yeah gotta love Him.

311
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,124
           The Lord.

312
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,027
Well hey do you want something
          to drink?

313
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,229
    Hey, how about a cookie?

314
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,364
   Oh no I don't do cookies.

315
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,499
    It's a double chin coming
         quicker than a

316
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,734
         freight train.

317
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:14,505
      How about a cookie?

318
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,407
             Sold.

319
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,709
             What?

320
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,110
            Nothing.

321
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,244
         You're great.

322
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,479
   Yeah well you're awesome.

323
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,984
I would've been okay with okay.

324
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,719
Coffee would be great though.

325
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,987
        Black, no sugar.

326
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,756
Uncomplicated and a believer.

327
00:16:31,758 --> 00:16:33,324
           That's me.

328
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,593
          I like that.

329
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:42,066
        Believer or not.

330
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:53,211
           Thank you.

331
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:01,686
Dear Lord, yes, we just want to
           thank you

332
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:07,291
for the coffee and the cookie,
          and really

333
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,261
most of all the coffee and the
        talent of the

334
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,730
   baristas that prepared it.

335
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,799
   Although I am just drinking
        black so I guess

336
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,701
that really doesn't take a lot
              of

337
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,302
          barista-ing.

338
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:18,803
            But um.

339
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,472
We also just want to say a
    huge , super huge

340
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,674
thanks for bringing Paul and I
           together

341
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:27,678
because he is just, he's very
       cool and - you

342
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,050
really did good thank you - and
          I just want

343
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,552
   to thanks for old photos.

344
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,720
              Yes.

345
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,590
         -Amen. -Amen.

346
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:42,093
I have never prayed over coffee
            before.

347
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,162
I mean you can't pray enough in
          this click,

348
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,364
       meet, marry world.

349
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:47,432
           That's it?

350
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,800
   You're stopping there now?

351
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:50,201
     No more die and done?

352
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,370
No I might wanna, I don't know
         wanna have a

353
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,472
few laughs or something before
            that.

354
00:17:54,474 --> 00:18:00,812
       Sounds good to me.

355
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,582
So, what do people call you?

356
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,817
            Gwinny?

357
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:08,119
Not if you want to
see tomorrow .

358
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:11,823
Sixth grade summer camp didn't
          end well.

359
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,258
You can just call me Gwyneth.

360
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,096
         Gwyneth it is.

361
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,730
          I like you.

362
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,133
         You got spunk.

363
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,367
             Spunk?

364
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:28,106
It's a little 'Brady Bunch'
       but , I don't

365
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,609
   know; it might grow on me.

366
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,111
This is a guy you met online!

367
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,278
I know, but it's not like that.

368
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,214
It's a very popular and legit
           dating

369
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:38,549
  website, not to mention it's
           Christian.

370
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,818
   Which brings us to problem
           number two:

371
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,887
     You're not Christian.

372
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,122
           Says who?

373
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:45,256
  I believe in God and stuff.

374
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:46,824
I mean I was baptized, I
     went to Sunday

375
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,827
School, I read the Bible when I
         was a kid...

376
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,762
you know, the one with all the
            pretty

377
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,797
          pictures...

378
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,500
and I go to church sometimes.

379
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,200
             When?

380
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:58,336
    When is the last time you
         stepped into a

381
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,371
            church?

382
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,439
          Last month.

383
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,674
You went to church last month?

384
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,243
             I did.

385
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,311
              And?

386
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,813
   Okay, so it was a wedding.

387
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:09,647
         Whose wedding?

388
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,449
   I don't know, but it was so
           beautiful.

389
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,317
   Oh, you crashed a wedding.

390
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,352
              No!

391
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:15,386
     I just peaked inside.

392
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,621
  It's not like I
followed them to the

393
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,189
  reception and chowed down on
          free shrimp.

394
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,526
And that was the last time you
          were in a

395
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:22,627
           church...

396
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,428
     peaking in a wedding?

397
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,530
             Yeah.

398
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,931
      It was so beautiful.

399
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,266
        This is so sad.

400
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,267
   Okay, that doesn't count.

401
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,302
You're not Christian or
   whatever this guy

402
00:19:31,304 --> 00:19:31,936
        thinks you are.

403
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:34,705
    That website is for real
       Christians looking

404
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,441
   for other real Christians.

405
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,377
Do you see the problem here?

406
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:40,711
Okay, you are making this
     a much heavier

407
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,480
religious issue than it
   needs to be, and

408
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:46,684
besides, I think I'm at
   least 50 percent

409
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,252
that kind of Christian anyway.

410
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,855
I'm pretty sure it's either/or,
          not just a

411
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,790
       slice of the pie.

412
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:56,761
            Ladies.

413
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,462
      Gwyneth, you are up.

414
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:02,200
Well she's all yours, God help
             her.

415
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,901
Actually I'd like a few minutes
          alone with

416
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,703
     Ms. Hayden if I might.

417
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:12,643
Well then I'll just leave you
         two to it.

418
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,346
    You don't bite, do you?

419
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,380
              Nah.

420
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,415
     What do we have here?

421
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,752
    Gwyneth Hayden, BP, Brand
           Management.

422
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,453
           That's me.

423
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:26,424
What's brand management, in
      your own words?

424
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30,294
Well I think I take the story...

425
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,897
the good, the bad and the ugly
          of it all.

426
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:37,301
I mix it in a bowl, I add some
         sugar and I

427
00:20:37,303 --> 00:20:38,936
      make it taste good.

428
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,805
    And you're good at that?

429
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:42,573
         I think I am.

430
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,743
You're not a believer, are you?

431
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,911
             uh....

432
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,246
        I'm sorry, what?

433
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:51,849
  You don't believe that I can
           grow hair.

434
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,417
              Oh.

435
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,019
           Oh, that.

436
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,454
             um...

437
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,422
           I just...

438
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,792
      You mean with these?

439
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,728
          Well I can.

440
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:10,534
  I can, and I can prove it to
              you.

441
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:16,941
       Before and after.

442
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,813
         Before, after.

443
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,982
      Pictures don't lie.

444
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,717
         Scout's honor.

445
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:32,023
Scout's honor then, I'm good.

446
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:37,828
   And it's all right there.

447
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:43,834
       Before and after.

448
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,971
  Yes, we're going on a second
              date.

449
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,606
I mean he's a little like
    out of 'Leave it

450
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,509
to Beaver' but you guys, he was
         so charming.

451
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,377
Oh honey, switch the channel.

452
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:54,979
    This can only end badly.

453
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,047
              End?

454
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,515
       What do you mean?

455
00:21:57,517 --> 00:21:58,549
      It's just beginning.

456
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,384
Sweetie, you're desperate and
           you're

457
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,686
      grasping at straws.

458
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:03,321
      You guys, no, stop.

459
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:03,888
        He is fantastic.

460
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,090
  I mean isn't this what we've
         been trying to

461
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:06,957
             do...

462
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,327
    get me a fella and get me
            hitched?

463
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,062
    My family has been in the
          construction

464
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:12,496
   business for generations.

465
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,598
    Papa's papa, he was a big
       development guy so

466
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,801
   he sort of turned it into a
          bigger deal.

467
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,470
Now papa has taken it to
    a whole 'nother

468
00:22:19,472 --> 00:22:20,538
             level.

469
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,774
So do you work a lot with your
            hands?

470
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,975
      Oh no, gosh, I wish.

471
00:22:24,977 --> 00:22:27,745
  No, I'm kind of stuck in the
             office.

472
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,046
          Oh, really?

473
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,481
          Doing what?

474
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,182
       Analysis, mostly.

475
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,683
Feasibility reports on
 potential projects.

476
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:39,323
Oh, so you basically sniff out
        the stinkers.

477
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,061
Yeah, I guess that's one way to
            put it.

478
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,596
           Sushi up.

479
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,898
         Oh, thank you.

480
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,667
        Looks delicious.

481
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,502
             Okay.

482
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:56,507
            Dig in.

483
00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,478
   You're not really a fan of
         sushi, are you?

484
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,947
      Is it that obvious?

485
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:03,647
             Yeah.

486
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,116
You know that funny thing
    you're doing with

487
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,751
     your nose, your stinker
            detector?

488
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:07,885
It's kind of a dead giveaway.

489
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,054
I mean you look like you just
         smelled dog

490
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,155
             poop.

491
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,958
Not really helping the
   situation here.

492
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,526
Well why didn't you just
     tell me that?

493
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,827
Because I kind of wanted to try
              it.

494
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,796
  You know, it's the in thing,
             right?

495
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,801
This red one here,
        this is tuna,

496
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,537
and this here, the yellow one,
              is

497
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,572
 yellowtail, which is
technically a different

498
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,407
         kind of tuna.

499
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,808
The brown one is eel, and then
        this orangey,

500
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,177
mushy-looking one is uni, which
            is sea

501
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,578
            urchin.

502
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,813
        It is delicious.

503
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:36,981
       It's my favorite.

504
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,649
Well maybe I'll try that one.

505
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,152
       Looks interesting.

506
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:42,553
         You know what?

507
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,888
     On second thought, no.

508
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,989
      Let's pass on that.

509
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,157
Sea urchin is not
gateway sushi .

510
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,527
   Just take your chopsticks,
        right, and let's

511
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:55,900
     just start right here.

512
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:05,142
      Okay, that'll work.

513
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,211
Here, you can dip it in the soy
            and...

514
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:10,915
            uh huh.

515
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:17,188
         Here it goes.

516
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:28,833
              Mmm.

517
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:40,544
You are gonna actually have to
          swallow at

518
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:42,179
          some point.

519
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:48,619
          It's coming.

520
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:54,525
         Here it goes.

521
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,761
              Oh!

522
00:24:57,763 --> 00:25:00,664
   Not exactly sure what just
            happened.

523
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,933
You just chewed that poor tuna
         to death is

524
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,702
         what happened.

525
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:08,606
I guess I'm just more of a
     chili cheese dog

526
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,775
          kind of guy.

527
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,811
   Someone's gonna get hurt.

528
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:15,846
    Do you have any idea what
          happened at a

529
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,281
          Bible study?

530
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:23,254
             What?

531
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:26,824
            to gas.

532
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:27,958
Got to get away from here fast.

533
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,995
Enemies breathing down my neck
        and trying to

534
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:33,097
grad a hold and make me wreck.

535
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,533
Hot on my tail trying to
    make me fail and

536
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,569
trying to take the wind up out
         of my sail.

537
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:45,142
Trying to roll me
off this road .

538
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:52,216
Don't look at what's behind.

539
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,618
         There you are.

540
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,120
     Thought you got lost.

541
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,688
          No, no, no.

542
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,923
           Here I am.

543
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,190
        You look great.

544
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,759
       Come in, come in.

545
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,593
        Meet everybody.

546
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,228
Everyone, this is Gwyneth, and
         whatever you

547
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,963
   do, don't call her Gwinny.

548
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,231
          Ah ha ha ha.

549
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,065
        Okay, let's see.

550
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,934
First that's Jimmy and Jessie
          McKenzie.

551
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,602
    They're happy newlyweds.

552
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:12,336
         Met on Mingle.

553
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,238
Turned me onto it, praise the
            Lord.

554
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,139
        Praise the Lord.

555
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,574
   And this is their beautiful
              home.

556
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,609
   And that's Tommy and Gabby
        Huntley, who are

557
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:19,977
         having a baby.

558
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,245
           My belly!

559
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,880
        Praise the Lord.

560
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:23,981
            Indeed.

561
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,749
      And that's Kel-Kel.

562
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,051
            Hi, hi.

563
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:27,751
             Kelly.

564
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,186
  Heck, you want to talk about
           summer camp

565
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:31,121
  stories, we got a few of our
              own.

566
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,222
          Bible camp.

567
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,691
   Believe me, it's nothing.

568
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,725
Okay, let me see if I have it.

569
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,794
    We have Jimmy and Jessie
       McKenzie, Tommy and

570
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:39,029
Gabby Huntley, who are having a
         baby in your

571
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,231
belly, and summer camp Kelly.

572
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,801
   So you should just call me
             Gwinny.

573
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:46,670
            Really?

574
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:47,871
             Sure.

575
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:53,043
   This, This place is great.

576
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:57,114
It's all so inspirational and
          marriage,

577
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:01,118
marriage that's just, I mean,
         it actually

578
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,153
     reminds me of one of my
           favorites.

579
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:08,192
Yeah I think the passage is
      from Galatians.

580
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:09,393
  Because of the temptation to
             sexual

581
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:10,961
immorality each man should have
         his own wife

582
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:17,935
and each woman should have her
         own husband.

583
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,974
You know what, my bad, I think
           that was

584
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,042
          Corinthians.

585
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,844
   Yep that was Corinthians.

586
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,379
           So sorry.

587
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:30,748
     Do you have any water?

588
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,883
             Sure.

589
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,251
           Thank you.

590
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,120
             C'mon.

591
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:39,323
     Hi how ya doing buddy.

592
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,792
I'm sorry, I'm not really good
           with you

593
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:42,393
            people.

594
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:44,161
Well you seem pretty good with
            Pauly.

595
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,797
    He's just so different.

596
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,966
He's the last of the good ones,
          that's for

597
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:51,135
             sure.

598
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:53,270
    I hope things work out.

599
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,040
I haven't seen him this
   happy in a while.

600
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,675
            Really?

601
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:02,212
Well I must be doing something
         right then.

602
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,782
So great to have
everybody back .

603
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,116
Jessie, Jimmy, thank you
    guys so much for

604
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:10,087
  your hospitality again, once
             again.

605
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,091
And Gwinny it's just awesome to
           have you

606
00:28:14,093 --> 00:28:15,693
            with us.

607
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,227
So, uh let's pick up where we
        left off last

608
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:24,134
week, Romans 7 we were uh,
        Verse 14.

609
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,438
Now everybody's familiar with
        the story of

610
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
    Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

611
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:31,008
     You know what I think?

612
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,043
     No, what do you think?

613
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,480
You should stick to Gwyneth.

614
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,382
          Just be you.

615
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,919
        Whoever that is.

616
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:46,790
The trouble is with me for I am
            all too

617
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:49,860
     human, a slave to sin.

618
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,766
Well the pressure's
bleeding in .

619
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:58,235
Giving me some blurry vision.

620
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,304
    Fogging up my intellect.

621
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:03,006
    Where love and hate they
           intersect.

622
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,342
Keep the path of the mission.

623
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:08,011
Never going to lose
my ambition .

624
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:13,383
Got my eyes up on the prize.

625
00:29:13,385 --> 00:29:18,288
         Eyes forward.

626
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:23,293
Don't look at what's behind.

627
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:28,265
         Eyes forward.

628
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:35,139
  Don't take your eyes off the
             prize.

629
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,943
I told Mom about that raw fish.

630
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:40,878
          Oh you did?

631
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,351
Boy did she get a kick out of
            that.

632
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,954
So what's the deal
with Kel-Kel ?

633
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:51,989
              Who?

634
00:29:51,991 --> 00:29:55,292
    Kelly from Bible Study.

635
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:56,493
            Oh that?

636
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,062
         Oh no nothing.

637
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,031
           Honestly.

638
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,933
  We, she's practically like a
             sister.

639
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,235
    We grew up together, our
            families.

640
00:30:05,237 --> 00:30:07,137
Although if mama had her way?

641
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,940
You and Kelly would be about 3
          kids and 2

642
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,275
      dogs deep right now?

643
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:13,110
       The barking kind.

644
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:19,583
oh, the next stop, the
  deliciou s train.

645
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,088
     I like it around here.

646
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,356
          It's funky.

647
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,224
         Funky spunky.

648
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:29,326
Okay so I told you I wanted to
          be a rock

649
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,460
             star.

650
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,862
       So what about you?

651
00:30:31,864 --> 00:30:33,897
Did you have any other dreams?

652
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:34,464
             Um...

653
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,533
yeah, I always actually wanted
           to be a

654
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,868
            teacher.

655
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,269
       Wow that's noble.

656
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,103
         What happened?

657
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,906
    Well I went to school and
          graduated and

658
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:46,109
needed a job and looked for a
       meaningful job

659
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:48,111
and there just wasn't one so I
        kind of faked

660
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,647
   my way to a living until I,
          funny enough,

661
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,351
ended up in a line of work
     where faking it

662
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:59,556
   is actually part of the job
          description.

663
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:03,193
  So, how long have you been a
            believer?

664
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:09,399
    You know, it's, it's just
        such a long and,

665
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:11,034
   you know, personal story.

666
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,937
Maybe it's for another time if
         that's okay.

667
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:15,639
      Oh yeah absolutely.

668
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,307
    Though you have peaked my
           curiosity.

669
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,143
  You know what they say about
          curiosity and

670
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:22,012
            the cat.

671
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,181
What about you though, if you
        don't mind me

672
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,315
            asking?

673
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,550
       No, no not at all.

674
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,452
I was kind of born into it, I
           guess.

675
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:32,222
All the men on mama- my
  mother's side were

676
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,024
  pastors going back forever.

677
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:38,962
  So, my papa's- my dad's side
            different

678
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,063
             story.

679
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,065
    He was a crazy kid my dad
        growing up in the

680
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,300
         60's and all.

681
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,135
     Drifting through life.

682
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,237
Then as the story goes he was
        walking on a

683
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,172
   beach one day, and he came
        across this piece

684
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,009
     of driftwood and he saw
        something in it.

685
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,912
    So he took it home and he
        studied it and he

686
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,681
   studied it, and he ended up
        carving a statue

687
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:59,616
      of Jesus out of it.

688
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,085
   Next thing you know, spirit
           fills him,

689
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,354
   changes his life forever.

690
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,555
        Just like that.

691
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,090
     Lights off, lights on.

692
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,325
      Flick of the switch.

693
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,393
   Let me get this straight.

694
00:32:09,395 --> 00:32:10,694
You're telling me your dad, who
             was a

695
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,163
drifter as you say, and whose
          last name

696
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,732
happens to be Wood
 finds a piece of

697
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:20,070
driftwood on the beach and
    finds Jesus in it

698
00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:24,174
   and bam, he's born again?

699
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:28,312
Wow, I've never seen that angle
            before.

700
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,513
      Are you kidding me?

701
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,248
   It was laying right there.

702
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,716
         No seriously!

703
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,984
             Snap!

704
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:34,718
      That is so creative.

705
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,121
  How do you just come up with
           that all so

706
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,156
            quickly?

707
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:42,459
    It's kind of what I do.

708
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:46,496
Well anyway, my driftwood
     moment actually

709
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,231
    happened when I was 13.

710
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,434
I entered the science fair at
        school and I

711
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:53,570
built this maze for mice to run
           through.

712
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,705
I had them in 2 cages,
the mice .

713
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:58,442
In one cage I had flashing red
          lights and

714
00:32:58,444 --> 00:33:01,011
head banging music going 24/7
         and in the

715
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:04,014
other one I had soft blue light
              and

716
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,615
        classical music.

717
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:08,352
My hypothesis was that,
    the mice in the

718
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:10,187
tripped out cage would run the
         maze faster

719
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,022
because they're all hyped
    up and the mellow

720
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:15,359
mice would just wander through
           without

721
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,194
         really caring.

722
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,029
And then right before every run
         I would give

723
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,398
each mouse a sniff of this big
           chunk of

724
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,368
Swiss cheese that I had at the
          end of the

725
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,704
       maze, their prize.

726
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:31,241
   This is actually me but I'm
          fascinated, I

727
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,776
       want to hear more.

728
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:33,610
            Oh, Ok.

729
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:37,180
It was somewhere in the middle
          of it all,

730
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:39,649
none of that mattered anymore
        because I got

731
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:43,620
so fixated on the notion of the
            cheese.

732
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:48,025
  That prize that both sets of
           mice had a

733
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:51,161
  scent of and ultimately were
            drawn to.

734
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:54,464
Each had their own path,
    but the goal was

735
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,732
           the same.

736
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:59,536
Don't tell me you saw Jesus in
         the cheese.

737
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,438
          No, no um..

738
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,641
But, it reminded me like so
      much of what I

739
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,243
    had been doing as a kid.

740
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,578
Searching for something that I
         had a sense

741
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,649
  of but couldn't quite put my
           finger on.

742
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:17,220
    suddenly it all clicked.

743
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:18,255
          The cheese.

744
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:22,559
Jesus' love was waiting for me.

745
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:28,231
    So that weekend I won the
        science fair, and

746
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,700
        found my prize.

747
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,537
       A love in Christ.

748
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,539
      Well sweet Cheesus.

749
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,774
         Sweet Cheese!

750
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:40,844
         Sweet Cheesus.

751
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,680
     You find the funny in
     everything, don't you?

752
00:34:43,682 --> 00:34:45,148
           I'm sorry.

753
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,450
        No I like funny.

754
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,452
         The world could
     definitely use a little

755
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:52,589
        funny right now.

756
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,559
         Are you happy?

757
00:34:55,561 --> 00:35:00,430
   You know, are you content?

758
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:04,234
        Yeah I think so.

759
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,368
              Wow.

760
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,572
         Big question.

761
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,674
I'm happier now that I've met
         you, that's

762
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,477
           for sure.

763
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:15,112
            Flatter.

764
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,614
You working overtime for that
          goodnight

765
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,182
             kiss?

766
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,250
              No.

767
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:23,487
       Well then no kiss.

768
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,322
             Okay.

769
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:26,690
        Are you serious?

770
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:32,696
          Absolutely.

771
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:53,517
<i> Worn out with blisters on your</i>
            <i> feet.</i>

772
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,353
  To anyone with a heart that

773
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,855
<i> shattered, doing your best to</i>
           <i> hold it</i>

774
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,157
           together.

775
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,424
    with no prayer to pray.

776
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,695
You're not going back to 1950s
           sweetie

777
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,464
    you're going to church.

778
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,533
  You know I want to scare his
          parents right

779
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,834
        out of the gate.

780
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,904
         Keep shopping.

781
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:14,971
I think I can make this work.

782
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:17,207
Yeah, if you're playing
  Margaret Thatcher.

783
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,309
   Aren't you a little worried
         about all this

784
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:19,910
          pretending.

785
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:22,512
I'm not pretending I genuinely
          like him.

786
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,948
    I do, and you know what?

787
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,850
That is so cute I just want to
              be

788
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:27,751
          respectful.

789
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,686
And dressing like Julia
    Child is being

790
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,453
          respectful.

791
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,322
     Or apparently any other
       character recently

792
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,557
    played by Meryl Streep.

793
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:38,628
  Thank You that is so sweet.

794
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,202
       Nice to meet you.

795
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,403
        What am I doing.

796
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:57,480
    standing at an open door

797
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,849
       this is your life

798
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:00,917
        never live twice

799
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,687
step through to the other side

800
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,293
            Gwyneth.

801
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:11,494
         Oh, I'm sorry.

802
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,830
  How do you feel about that?

803
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:14,764
       It's just so big.

804
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:16,600
   Hundred and twenty seven by
         forty five and

805
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:20,237
sixty three feet closer to the
         other shore.

806
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,972
        Steak and cake.

807
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:22,872
        I'm sorry what?

808
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,674
How do you feel about steak and
             cake?

809
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:25,675
     We're all going there.

810
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:27,811
Don't tell me you've never had
          steak and

811
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:28,778
             cake.

812
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,647
   Oh are you in for a treat.

813
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:31,681
             Amen.

814
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:32,816
    Have you met our Kelly.

815
00:37:32,818 --> 00:37:34,884
I have hi nice to
see you again .

816
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:36,386
      Well alrighty then.

817
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:39,022
    Let's steak and cake it.

818
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,790
Your mother doesn't like me.

819
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,892
What are you talking about of
         course she

820
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:43,593
             does.

821
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,995
She doesn't even know you, and
         speaking of

822
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:47,430
which is it just me or have you
            always

823
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,798
    dressed like my grandma.

824
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,834
I just didn't want to stick out
             cause

825
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,302
           sometimes.

826
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:52,902
         She likes you.

827
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,272
I promise you are reading way
        too much into

828
00:37:55,274 --> 00:37:56,539
              it.

829
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:57,874
             Paul.

830
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:58,975
            Coming.

831
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:01,778
   Gwyneth we would all be so
         honored if you

832
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,047
        would say Grace.

833
00:38:04,049 --> 00:38:07,550
           Of course.

834
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:11,288
Dear Lord, thanks a bunch for
        new friends.

835
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,556
It's really not often in life
         that we get

836
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,357
          such a gift.

837
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,296
People that are just kind and
        generous, and

838
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:24,768
          so thank you

839
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:27,304
and, and for this food golly

840
00:38:27,306 --> 00:38:29,806
I mean steak and cake it's kind
          of hard to

841
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,341
    know which to eat first.

842
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,310
But, I guess it's all going to
           the same

843
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:40,317
    place so we are just very
       thankful for that.

844
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:47,424
    And, we thank you for the
        abundance of all

845
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:49,059
             of it.

846
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:51,428
There is just so much, and we
        thank you for

847
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,963
 the cows who are
willing to give up

848
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:54,764
          themselves.

849
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,599
And that this food is going to
         nourish our

850
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:01,104
bodies, and we really just sit
              in

851
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:07,444
     awesomeness, and really
         I have a great

852
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,012
      amount of gratitude.

853
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,680
         So, yes Amen.

854
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,782
      In Jesus' name Amen.

855
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,485
Oh yes in Jesus' name I
  mean all of that of

856
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,121
course was in Jesus' name Amen.

857
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:22,492
Alrighty to the almighty lets
           dig in.

858
00:39:22,494 --> 00:39:25,428
   Paul, have you told Gwyneth
            about our

859
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,997
         mission trip?

860
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:31,868
Yeah, we're just all so blessed
          and excited

861
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,940
     last year when we were
       vacationing on the

862
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:37,774
         Mayan Riviera.

863
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:40,043
    The Yucatan Peninsula the
         Caribbean side.

864
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:40,777
             Right.

865
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:43,079
Well, we took this fantastic
      day trip to see

866
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,916
some of the ancient sites the
       Mayan pyramids

867
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:47,617
            and all.

868
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,419
We came across this beautiful
         little town

869
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,887
  called San Luis De Piscopo.

870
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,022
Oh, just a stone's throw from
        where we were

871
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:54,424
            staying.

872
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:55,091
        A stone's throw.

873
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,926
Yeah, well the town is
   almost in ruins.

874
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,528
Evidently they haven't really
          recovered

875
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,696
  since hurricane Wilma struck
             there.

876
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:02,966
Three years ago, category 5
      just blew this

877
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,501
     little place to bits.

878
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:08,405
   Grace, let the boy finish.

879
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:09,639
             Sorry.

880
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,040
          Well really.

881
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:11,741
             go on.

882
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,109
Really that's it I mean most of
          the people

883
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,677
just, left you know, abandoned
          the place,

884
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,613
  sort of just lost their way,
            gave up.

885
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:17,914
         Faith an all.

886
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,015
         That's right.

887
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:24,020
Door to door we shall restore.

888
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:28,525
  Bill, who needs to hush now?

889
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,660
Door to door was real good,
      take a note of

890
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,194
             that.

891
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,762
Anyway, right there smack
    in the middle of

892
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,566
it their church crumbling, it's
           symbolic

893
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,034
they haven't opened their door
            since.

894
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,603
The bell literally fell to the
          ground and

895
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:42,105
     that's where it sits.

896
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:42,806
           So tragic.

897
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:44,908
  But, with the help of Papa's
         company and the

898
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,576
       good Lord's grace.

899
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,945
    We are going to fix it.

900
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:53,450
Door to door, we shall restore.

901
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:53,983
            Oh yeah.

902
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:56,152
    So, I'm, I'm just curious
        exactly how long

903
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,555
does it take to re-hang a bell?

904
00:40:58,557 --> 00:40:59,789
       Long as it takes.

905
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,459
We will be there
till she rings .

906
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,927
Not a ding or a dong sooner.

907
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,795
Papas got it all pretty
 keyed in down there.

908
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:11,701
So, we're thinking maybe a
      month at most.

909
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,003
   Or, until the bell rings.

910
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,104
        It's cake time.

911
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:18,508
  I want Chaco Latto, please.

912
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,144
Wait, I'm sorry you're going to
         Mexico for a

913
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:24,614
             month?

914
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:31,087
   It's going to be awesome.

915
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:36,192
  So wait, when do you leave?

916
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,863
     Like tomorrow, night.

917
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:43,967
        Praise the Lord.

918
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:46,669
I'm sorry but I, I thought you
          would have

919
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,504
           told her.

920
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,838
  I was going to, and I should
            have but,

921
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,139
you know we just met and to say
             that

922
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:55,678
I was leaving for so long I, I
           just...

923
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,847
   I understand, I understand
           really and

924
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,149
honestly I'm sorry that I made
            things

925
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:01,684
       difficult for you.

926
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,919
     But, I did think that

927
00:42:02,921 --> 00:42:07,624
  you wouldn't have told her.

928
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:12,061
   Paul, you know I only want
         what's best for

929
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,897
              you.

930
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:14,998
           Of course.

931
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,935
Well, don't you think there is
          something

932
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:22,238
just a little off about her.

933
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,239
              Off?

934
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:27,710
    Out of place, peculiar.

935
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:28,745
   I mean don't get me wrong.

936
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,980
I'm sure she's a sweet
  girl and , and I'm

937
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,016
    sure she means well but.

938
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:35,585
           But what?

939
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:40,823
    Forgive me, but there is
          something not

940
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,592
    genuine going on there.

941
00:42:42,594 --> 00:42:45,094
Alright now there I said it.

942
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,963
            How so?

943
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,831
    You really don't see it.

944
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,133
           See what?

945
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,769
Oh sweetie you are just being
         blinded by

946
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:54,737
             love.

947
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,006
I'm really not following here.

948
00:42:57,008 --> 00:43:03,746
Paul, she is hiding something.

949
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:05,949
         No she isn't.

950
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:06,983
     You know what I think?

951
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,818
I think this is you with
    all due respect,

952
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,719
    Mom stepping in the way.

953
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,855
You like to trying to control
       the situation.

954
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,958
Please don't do that, not here
           not this

955
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
             time.

956
00:43:16,962 --> 00:43:19,629
I like Gwyneth I really, really
         like her and

957
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:23,066
     I think she's awesome.

958
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:26,202
    Admit it she is a little
         different, but

959
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:27,837
that's what I like about her.

960
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,205
I think she does mean well and
            she is

961
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,741
genuine, and I'm going to prove
          it to you.

962
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:35,878
          How is that?

963
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,883
    I don't know but I will.

964
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:43,653
       I'm buying a dog.

965
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,888
Oh well, I mean he was a really
           nice guy.

966
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,124
   He was but, he was kind of
             goofy.

967
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,026
  And between his mama and his
             papa it

968
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:51,894
probably wouldn't work anyway.

969
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:53,296
     What about a Bulldog?

970
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,965
       Onward and upward.

971
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,835
         Onward anyway.

972
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,270
You know I just he would have
         given me a

973
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:02,705
           heads up.

974
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:03,906
        It's so unfair.

975
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:04,907
     Has he tried calling?

976
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:06,142
      Yeah about a hundred
       times but I am not

977
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,811
   answering I'm gonna let him
          sweat it out.

978
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:12,949
And they say romance is dead.

979
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:15,418
There was something about
    it al l though I

980
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,687
           gotta say.

981
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:23,860
Everyone just seemed so happy.

982
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,896
      Surprise inspection.

983
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:27,997
        De Bona is here.

984
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:30,033
He wants to see some ideas now.

985
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,435
I guess he's keeping us on our
            toes.

986
00:44:32,437 --> 00:44:33,736
           But, I...

987
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:35,304
     No buts! Just genius.

988
00:44:35,306 --> 00:44:37,707
      Pamela, cup of Joe.

989
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:43,846
             Quick.

990
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,018
           Thank you.

991
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:49,819
         I don't know.

992
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:52,355
Maybe I should start with them,
           or oh no.

993
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,222
           This one.

994
00:44:53,224 --> 00:44:54,390
Yeah, this one right here for
            sure.

995
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,827
Ok, so this is gonna be a
    little out there.

996
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:01,397
So if you kinda just
go with me .

997
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:03,066
            Hang on.

998
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:10,006
Alright, so we are going
    to kill baldness

999
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,008
     with the blue bullet.

1000
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,376
   Most men I know view their
            follicly

1001
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:16,913
challenged head as a life-long
           nemesis.

1002
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:20,750
And men being men, they want to
          destroy the

1003
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:21,884
         enemy, right?

1004
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,352
So how are we gonna do that?

1005
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:26,489
    We are going to kill it.

1006
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,924
         That's right.

1007
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:29,459
      With a blue bullet.

1008
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:30,226
             Right?

1009
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,494
Do you see where I'm going with
             this?

1010
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:32,962
You know we can even have,
     like , a little

1011
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,164
   dispenser, that's actually
          shaped like a

1012
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:36,365
              gun.

1013
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:37,166
           You know?

1014
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:38,735
Shoots out the blue bullets, or
           we could

1015
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,470
call it the Bald Bullet, even
           better.

1016
00:45:40,472 --> 00:45:41,270
        Or just Bullet.

1017
00:45:41,272 --> 00:45:42,905
You know, we could get a really
         good looking

1018
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,774
  bald Steve McQueen-type male
             model.

1019
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:46,375
       You know, Bullet?

1020
00:45:46,377 --> 00:45:48,010
           The movie?

1021
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:54,050
              No?

1022
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:55,885
    I'm gonna pass on that.

1023
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,422
  That's mixed messages and in
          this current

1024
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,256
          environment.

1025
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,158
   And with all the gun issues
           right now.

1026
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,893
       It's, It's toxic.

1027
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,094
             Toxic.

1028
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:06,863
          Yeah, toxic.

1029
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,998
           Too toxic.

1030
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,199
             Okay.

1031
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:11,534
         You know what?

1032
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:12,335
          Absolutely.

1033
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:13,870
  We are just gonna - shifting
           gears here.

1034
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,838
Going in a whole new different
          direction.

1035
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,472
         Ah, literally.

1036
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:18,241
Everyone wants someone to blame
           for their

1037
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:20,176
deficiencies, especially men.

1038
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:21,544
        All due respect.

1039
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:22,378
           So sorry.

1040
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,380
But when men look in the
    mirror , and you

1041
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:25,882
           know what?

1042
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:26,482
          Also women.

1043
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,351
We cannot forget that there are
           plenty of

1044
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,786
     bald women out there.

1045
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:31,220
  Boy you can say that again.

1046
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,455
      My mother was bald.

1047
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:35,224
   Mamma Debona had alopecia.

1048
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:38,461
     Bald as a baby's butt.

1049
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:45,168
   Very tragic, very tragic.

1050
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:47,436
             What?

1051
00:46:47,438 --> 00:46:49,172
       Sorry about that.

1052
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:50,206
             Okay.

1053
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,209
  Yeah so, when we look in the
             mirror.

1054
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:55,444
I mean when we really
   see who we are.

1055
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,380
       Who we really are.

1056
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:01,317
  Sometimes we just don't take
         responsibility

1057
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,084
            for it.

1058
00:47:02,086 --> 00:47:03,386
So, we want someone to blame,
           right?

1059
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,388
And who are we going to blame
           for our

1060
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,223
           baldness?

1061
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:10,193
I think naturally we blame the
          thing that

1062
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,495
          created us.

1063
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:13,596
         That's right.

1064
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,331
   We're going to blame God.

1065
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,033
        Right up there.

1066
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,201
              God.

1067
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:19,068
          Blaming God.

1068
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,137
Looking at God, going 'you know
             what?

1069
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,371
            Why me?

1070
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,006
          Why me, God?

1071
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:24,907
            Why me?

1072
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:28,244
Why can't you just help me God?

1073
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:33,249
         You know what?

1074
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,418
     God hears your cries.

1075
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,421
     He hears your cries of
          desperation.

1076
00:47:38,423 --> 00:47:43,960
   And he has mercy because he
        is a loving God,

1077
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:49,432
  and he has given us Heaven's
              Rain.

1078
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:52,201
         Heaven's Rain?

1079
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,004
        Yes, he made it.

1080
00:47:55,006 --> 00:48:00,109
   And with a little faith and
         Heaven's Rain,

1081
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:06,482
       he can re-make it.

1082
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:16,425
             Water.

1083
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:23,399
              Wow.

1084
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,367
         You know what?

1085
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:05,007
     Can't you take a hint?

1086
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:16,085
       Alright, alright.

1087
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:17,987
              Hey.

1088
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,322
You know, I'm trying to be mad
           at you.

1089
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,590
I think, I think I owe you an
          apology.

1090
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:22,391
         No, you don't.

1091
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:24,226
No, that wasn't the coolest way
          to tell you

1092
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:26,062
   I was leaving for a while.

1093
00:49:26,064 --> 00:49:27,296
         Paul, listen.

1094
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,498
This is hard to say, but I just
          don't know

1095
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,069
if we're really, I mean you are
         such a sweet

1096
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,437
  guy, you really are, but...

1097
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:37,573
   You should come down here.

1098
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,075
             What?

1099
00:49:39,077 --> 00:49:40,276
            Mexico!

1100
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:45,281
         Come on down.

1101
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,616
            Gwyneth?

1102
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:49,352
        Yeah, I'm here.

1103
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:51,120
          I just, wow.

1104
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:54,256
That's - I mean, I mean, when?

1105
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,158
              Now.

1106
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,226
            I can't.

1107
00:49:57,228 --> 00:49:58,194
     I mean I really can't.

1108
00:49:58,196 --> 00:49:59,996
I mean we're in the middle of
          something

1109
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,397
   really huge here at work.

1110
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:07,103
     Oh, one second please?

1111
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,438
         Heaven's Rain!

1112
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,140
         Heaven's Rain!

1113
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:12,008
              God!

1114
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,376
Little blue bullets from a gun?

1115
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:15,177
What planet are you living on!

1116
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:15,778
          Voodoo guru?

1117
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,114
Listen, you'd better shape
      up or ship out

1118
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,081
             missy.

1119
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:23,486
I told you not to blow this!

1120
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:30,059
       I'll pay for that.

1121
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:36,032
      Are you still there?

1122
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:42,238
           You're on.

1123
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,668
   Wait please, where are you
             taking

1124
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,136
           my stuff?

1125
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:15,438
         It's all good.

1126
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,772
        That's my stuff.

1127
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:18,240
        Hey, it's okay.

1128
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,608
       Welcome to Mexico.

1129
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:24,046
         It's all good.

1130
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,809
     Buenos Dias, stranger!

1131
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:56,245
              Hey!

1132
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:59,248
      Ha ha, there she is!

1133
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,183
Listen, you want something for
          the trots,

1134
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:02,418
       just let me know.

1135
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,453
    I got something for ya.

1136
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,755
             Great.

1137
00:52:06,757 --> 00:52:10,659
     So what do you think?

1138
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:11,760
            It's...

1139
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:14,563
              Well

1140
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:16,332
     Buenos Dias senorita!

1141
00:52:16,334 --> 00:52:20,136
            It's...

1142
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:26,275
            awesome.

1143
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:41,357
I kinda packed more beach, sand
              and

1144
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,292
          surf-ish...

1145
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:44,627
          You're fine.

1146
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:46,495
          That works!

1147
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:47,863
          Don't worry.

1148
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:54,336
        You look pretty.

1149
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,913
    Well, I'll just take some
         vacation time.

1150
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:05,514
   I mean I have three years'
             worth.

1151
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,816
   I have worked through every
        holiday known to

1152
00:53:07,818 --> 00:53:09,585
man to make these deadlines.

1153
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:10,819
          He owes me.

1154
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,288
       You're in Mexico?

1155
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:12,955
       On a mission trip?

1156
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:15,257
   It's not like I'm not doing
         something good

1157
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:15,791
           down here.

1158
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,760
  I mean we're all wearing the
         same shirt and

1159
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:18,661
      making a difference.

1160
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,196
I'm going to knock these sticks
           together,

1161
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:21,463
  bang bang bang, slap on some
          paint, brush

1162
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:23,465
   brush brush, and then Paul
        and I can head to

1163
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:24,366
       the Mayan Riviera.

1164
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:26,268
   Where we can have
margaritas and gulp and

1165
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:29,371
   gulp and gulp and watch the
        sunset, into the

1166
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,439
           Caribbean.

1167
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:31,440
It's a win win for everyone.

1168
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:32,841
Except for the poor suckers who
          paid a ton

1169
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:34,543
to watch the sun sink into the
           Pacific,

1170
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,479
which is what it normally does.

1171
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,847
Oh, okay so sue me Pam I'm bad
        at geography.

1172
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,650
I don't care, listen, I am so
           sick of

1173
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:42,718
            normal.

1174
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,220
     I just want paradise.

1175
00:53:44,222 --> 00:53:45,487
    His version of paradise.

1176
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:47,656
   And if the sweet Lord is my
         ticket to that,

1177
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:48,991
         then so be it.

1178
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:49,825
        All the better.

1179
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:52,228
I mean I'm here two weeks, life
           goes on.

1180
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,562
         There you are.

1181
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,863
          uh, uh, uh.

1182
00:53:54,865 --> 00:53:56,498
        I'm losing you!

1183
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,466
            No, no.

1184
00:53:57,468 --> 00:53:58,601
It's a really bad connection.

1185
00:53:58,603 --> 00:54:00,402
  I know that's you you... no,
            come on.

1186
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,870
     I'm sorry, thank you.

1187
00:54:01,872 --> 00:54:03,239
        Everything okay?

1188
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,440
    Yeah, just checking in.

1189
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,342
She did not just hang up on me.

1190
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:11,547
             Oh my.

1191
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:38,941
           yon city.

1192
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:31,026
      Holding up the wall?

1193
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:33,028
Your dad has a beautiful voice.

1194
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,098
         Yeah he does.

1195
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,367
I see where you got your dreams
          of being a

1196
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:43,339
           rock star.

1197
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,674
         It's amazing.

1198
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:46,842
          What's that?

1199
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,778
  Just given everything that's
            happened.

1200
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,513
        The devastation.

1201
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:57,986
Everyone just seems, so okay,
       so just happy.

1202
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,357
When your peace comes from God
         no storm can

1203
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:02,358
            take it.

1204
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,059
Yeah, I spill a drop of wine on
           my carpet

1205
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,794
   and I have a heart attack.

1206
00:56:05,796 --> 00:56:07,429
          Go bonkers.

1207
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:13,402
             Okay.

1208
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,938
  The temperature really drops
          here at night

1209
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,439
              huh?

1210
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,375
             Yeah.

1211
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:26,415
            Savior.

1212
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:38,026
             down.

1213
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,935
Let us love one another for
      love comes from

1214
00:57:52,937 --> 00:57:54,136
              God.

1215
00:57:56,106 --> 00:58:00,008
Everyone who loves has been
      born of God and

1216
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,543
           knows God.

1217
00:58:03,814 --> 00:58:07,649
Whoever does not love does not
          know God,

1218
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:12,554
      because God is love.

1219
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:15,557
Anyone who does not love does
        not know God

1220
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:17,125
      because God is love.

1221
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:21,930
        1st John 4:7-8.

1222
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:24,066
    Would anybody like to say
         anything about

1223
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:26,702
             that?

1224
00:58:26,704 --> 00:58:27,970
             Maria.

1225
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:39,548
   That's a very good question
             Maria.

1226
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,517
            Gwyneth.

1227
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,020
Would you like to take a crack
            at it?

1228
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,156
   I'm, I'm sorry, I just, my
            Spanish.

1229
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:51,293
    I don't - I don't think I
         understood the

1230
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:51,994
           question.

1231
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,029
Maria wanted to know why, if
      God loves us so

1232
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,032
much, he let happened to their
         village what

1233
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:57,799
           happened.

1234
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:02,037
If God is love, why did he let
         this happen?

1235
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:05,774
    Well, that is a very good
         question Maria.

1236
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:08,977
And not an easy one to answer.

1237
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:12,214
    But I know there are many
        wonderful answers

1238
00:59:12,216 --> 00:59:15,717
            in here.

1239
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,221
          Let me see.

1240
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:23,292
     How about James 1:7-8?

1241
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:26,261
    I think that addresses it
       beautifully, don't

1242
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,763
              you?

1243
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:28,330
              Yes.

1244
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:30,098
   That is exactly what I was
            thinking.

1245
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,067
     You are exactly right.

1246
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:34,102
           Let's see.

1247
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,360
   And that was the end of the
              road.

1248
00:59:58,362 --> 00:59:59,761
           They knew.

1249
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,896
       I knew they knew.

1250
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,798
And they knew I knew they knew.

1251
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,832
            Perfect.

1252
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:06,168
Now the only question was how I
           was gonna

1253
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:13,175
get out of there with any trace
          of dignity.

1254
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:25,754
              Hey.

1255
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:26,221
              Hey.

1256
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,256
I was just hunkering down with
         the men folk

1257
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:29,691
        about tomorrow.

1258
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:31,226
       Lots to get done?

1259
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:32,194
             Yeah.

1260
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:33,862
   But we will get 'er done.

1261
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,030
       I'm sure you will.

1262
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:37,866
I mean God willing of course.

1263
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,268
      God willing, right?

1264
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,137
          You hungry?

1265
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:47,376
        Not really, no.

1266
01:00:47,378 --> 01:00:54,116
  Can I talk to you a minute?

1267
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,023
  You're not enjoying this are
              you?

1268
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:02,824
             What?

1269
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:05,394
         you seem lost.

1270
01:01:05,396 --> 01:01:11,900
         Are you lost?

1271
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,336
       I don't - kind of.

1272
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:16,004
     You know what I think?

1273
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,106
          Straight up.

1274
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:19,941
       You're pretending.

1275
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:22,144
   Pretending to be something
           you're not.

1276
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:25,147
    Why would you say that?

1277
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:28,216
         Just a hunch.

1278
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:29,685
          Am I right?

1279
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:33,121
     Not, completely but...

1280
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,457
      You're not really a

1281
01:01:35,459 --> 01:01:36,925
        believe are you?

1282
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:41,797
    There's that word again.

1283
01:01:41,799 --> 01:01:46,034
              Wow.

1284
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,203
     I guess I'm confused.

1285
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:50,205
       I like you a lot.

1286
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,008
There's nothing confusing about
             that.

1287
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,343
        And I like you.

1288
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:59,414
             A lot.

1289
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,850
              So?

1290
01:02:01,852 --> 01:02:05,454
Being a believer what does that
          even mean?

1291
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:07,422
I'm Christian, I believe
     in God , I was

1292
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:10,092
baptized, all of that stuff.

1293
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:12,794
Are we really that different?

1294
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:15,497
You gonna figure all that out
         with this?

1295
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:17,999
    Where did you find that?

1296
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,501
Did someone go
through my stuff ?

1297
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:21,036
     Because that so not...

1298
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:21,937
    One of the kids found it

1299
01:02:21,939 --> 01:02:23,872
when they were cleaning out the
          bunk house.

1300
01:02:23,874 --> 01:02:24,806
     It was under your cot.

1301
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:27,008
They gave it to my mom, and she
          gave it to

1302
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:31,213
              me.

1303
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:33,782
  Tell me if this sounds about
             right.

1304
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:36,384
All your life you've done some
        searching for

1305
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:37,853
           something.

1306
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:40,188
       Something bigger.

1307
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,023
Every now and again maybe you
          can call

1308
01:02:42,025 --> 01:02:44,126
     yourself a Christian.

1309
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:45,093
            Why not?

1310
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:48,096
  It's easy, gives it a name.

1311
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:52,367
So you say, "I believe in God".

1312
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:54,002
And for the most part it works.

1313
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,838
Covers the bases, satisfies
      that underlying

1314
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,275
need to understand it deeper.

1315
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:03,278
  You kinda go with the common
              flow.

1316
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,447
And then something bad happens
         and you look

1317
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,250
   around see all the terrible
          things in the

1318
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:09,851
             world.

1319
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,953
Compound that with the general
        negative spin

1320
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:16,491
  on religion and you just get
          turned off to

1321
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:17,492
              it.

1322
01:03:17,494 --> 01:03:21,229
     God, faith, all of it.

1323
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:23,832
    So you, toss it all out.

1324
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:28,837
   Back and forth, accept it,
           reject it.

1325
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:32,007
      How's that sounding?

1326
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:33,909
          About right.

1327
01:03:33,911 --> 01:03:36,878
Honestly, some of the stuff out
          there, you

1328
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,081
would not be human if you
     didn't question

1329
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,819
              it.

1330
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,487
      So help me out here.

1331
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:49,324
When you went online, Christian
            Mingle.

1332
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:54,229
What exactly were
you expecting ?

1333
01:03:54,231 --> 01:04:00,836
    Honestly, I don't know.

1334
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,339
I just saw the website and, all
           of these

1335
01:04:04,341 --> 01:04:06,441
         happy people.

1336
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:10,212
   And the guys just seemed, I
           don't know.

1337
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,047
All of the guys that I have, I
          have been

1338
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:17,118
   dating were just so full of
           themselves.

1339
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:20,455
    And I saw your pictures.

1340
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:23,124
   And your smile and you just
          seemed like a

1341
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:24,259
          genuine guy.

1342
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:28,430
    But, then you lied about
            yourself.

1343
01:04:28,432 --> 01:04:29,464
              Why?

1344
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,166
     Well isn't it obvious?

1345
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:35,003
Because if I hadn't, then, then
             you.

1346
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:38,039
What does it matter because in
         the end, we

1347
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:38,607
           did meet.

1348
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:42,143
And, Paul I really like you,
       and according

1349
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:45,013
  to you, you really like me a
              lot.

1350
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:46,181
              So.

1351
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:47,015
         I do like you.

1352
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:48,316
But whoever I am with I gotta
        feel totally

1353
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:50,886
   comfortable sharing what's
        important to me.

1354
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,554
And having a relationship with
            Christ

1355
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:54,489
through the good and the bad,
        that is, that

1356
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:57,192
  is more important to me than
            anything.

1357
01:04:57,194 --> 01:04:59,661
And I, I can't, I can't share
       that with you.

1358
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:02,230
Not if it's not true for you.

1359
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,666
That's who I was looking for.

1360
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:06,568
    So, what are you saying?

1361
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,138
I'm not sure, I'm, I mean I'm
          confused

1362
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,306
            myself.

1363
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:14,509
     Because I do like you.

1364
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,411
       I really like you.

1365
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,946
           Well okay.

1366
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:19,514
Then, unless you are under some
          contractual

1367
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:21,416
obligation please your
 mother by being with

1368
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:25,320
   a gal, that she thinks you
         should be with,

1369
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:30,358
i.e., Kel-Kel which is not me.

1370
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:34,129
Then maybe you could slowly
     help me get to a

1371
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:36,364
   place that works for you.

1372
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:39,234
   That works for both of us.

1373
01:05:39,236 --> 01:05:40,101
       I would like that!

1374
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:46,341
Maybe, you could help show
     me my driftwood.

1375
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,177
   I don't think it works like
              that.

1376
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:54,149
       Not for me anyway.

1377
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:58,019
I just wished that you hadn't
            lied.

1378
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:03,291
    Maybe if you didn't-mm.

1379
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:09,564
         I don't know.

1380
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:12,434
         I don't know.

1381
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:13,702
           So, should

1382
01:06:13,704 --> 01:06:19,341
         I just leave?

1383
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:30,051
      I like you so much.

1384
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,088
       I'm really sorry.

1385
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:39,394
         Yeah, Me too.

1386
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:49,270
            Me too.

1387
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,752
That was just about one of the
        worst moments

1388
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:04,819
          of my life.

1389
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:07,389
But, things were exactly as
      they were meant

1390
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,623
             to be.

1391
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:12,427
  I think it is called Grace.

1392
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,262
Don't say I didn't tell you.

1393
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:15,730
             Yeah.

1394
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:19,034
  Christians looking for other
           Christians.

1395
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:23,405
      I really liked him.

1396
01:07:23,407 --> 01:07:25,073
            I know.

1397
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:29,511
         Yes, come in.

1398
01:07:29,513 --> 01:07:31,046
         Hey, Hey um..

1399
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,213
         How you doing?

1400
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,548
     I'm glad you are back.

1401
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,050
     That was pretty fast.

1402
01:07:35,052 --> 01:07:36,785
    You, are, are you feeling
             better?

1403
01:07:36,787 --> 01:07:37,585
           Ah, what?

1404
01:07:37,587 --> 01:07:39,454
   I know you want to keep it
           between us.

1405
01:07:39,456 --> 01:07:43,558
     But, the strep throat.

1406
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,360
Oh, oh yeah the strep throat,

1407
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:48,563
             yeah,

1408
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,132
it's a little scratchy but you
         know what I

1409
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:52,634
    am doing so much better.

1410
01:07:52,636 --> 01:07:54,135
           Thank you!

1411
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:54,736
          That's good.

1412
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:57,605
That's good and, and so you're
         back at it?

1413
01:07:57,607 --> 01:08:00,241
With, with the De bona thing?

1414
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:01,776
           Yes, yes.

1415
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:04,179
   That's splendid, splendid.

1416
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:08,149
    Well, then as you were.

1417
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:09,851
           Thank you.

1418
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:14,489
   Thank you, but strep throat
             really?

1419
01:08:14,491 --> 01:08:16,691
  You could of just said the a
           cold or the

1420
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,392
              flu.

1421
01:08:17,394 --> 01:08:19,494
You had to go all dramatic with
             strep

1422
01:08:19,496 --> 01:08:20,161
            throat?

1423
01:08:20,163 --> 01:08:22,130
Hey, you said a couple of weeks
           so that's

1424
01:08:22,132 --> 01:08:27,335
       what I bought ya.

1425
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,134
      news lie admit-ion .

1426
01:08:59,136 --> 01:09:01,769
   I got my eyes on the path.

1427
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:08,376
      My eyes on the path.

1428
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,319
        We are in here!

1429
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,387
        We are in here!

1430
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,556
Oh I used to love this program.

1431
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,291
    Never miss a day of it.

1432
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:26,394
     I keep it on for her.

1433
01:09:26,396 --> 01:09:29,931
   OK, it's a little catchy.

1434
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:31,599
You know these people never to

1435
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:32,867
      seem to leave town.

1436
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:34,302
    Or get older, evidently.

1437
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:35,803
Alright Gwen, What's going on?

1438
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,372
       Is it chain again?

1439
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:38,840
        Yeah, it clinks.

1440
01:09:38,842 --> 01:09:39,774
            Clinks?

1441
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:41,409
Or maybe it's more of a clunk.

1442
01:09:41,411 --> 01:09:42,877
     Sure it's not a clank?

1443
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:44,179
        Like last time?

1444
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:45,346
No, it's definitely a clink.

1445
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,215
It's like clink, clink, clink,
            clink.

1446
01:09:47,217 --> 01:09:48,616
        I got, I got it.

1447
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:49,918
           I got it.

1448
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,386
          Thanks dad.

1449
01:09:51,388 --> 01:09:51,953
         You're single.

Oh, it's a different day, huh?

1455
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:00,762
             Yeah.

1456
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:01,829
I meet my wife in high school.

1457
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,464
I married her right afterward
        and loved her

1458
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,300
till the day she passed and oh,
              no.

1459
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:05,934
       Eleven years ago.

1460
01:10:05,936 --> 01:10:08,903
  You ever think about getting
         back out there?

1461
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:10,505
       You know, dating?

1462
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,207
         Da-da-dating?

1463
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:13,208
              Me?

1464
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,542
    No, no, no, no, no, no.

1465
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,610
    She was my one and only.

            ideal...

     figured out here, just

           today.

1475
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,564
  Sometimes we wait for God to
          make the next

1476
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,800
move when God is saying, "It's
         your time to

1477
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:43,771
act", "your time to act", "your
            time to

1478
01:10:43,773 --> 01:10:44,539
             act".

1479
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,407
We have had a lot of
  opportunity walk

1480
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,275
       through our door.

1481
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,377
   Some better, some worse and
           ninety-nine

1482
01:10:49,379 --> 01:10:52,547
percent of the time I have been
         able to doll

1483
01:10:52,549 --> 01:10:52,981
             it up.

1484
01:10:52,983 --> 01:10:55,950
Give it a makeover, and make it
         the queen of

1485
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:57,285
           the ball.

1486
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:58,920
     Correct or incorrect?

1487
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:02,624
    I would say that's a fair
           evaluation.

1488
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:06,961
  But, that's not 100% is it?

1489
01:11:06,963 --> 01:11:12,834
Douglas, I have to have an
     ounce of belief

1490
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:14,369
         in something.

1491
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:15,403
        A half an ounce.

1492
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:16,971
Just a drop of it to do what I
             do.

1493
01:11:16,973 --> 01:11:21,943
To find the angle, the magic.

1494
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,912
This De Bona stuff, all of it,
             it's

1495
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:26,914
            just...

1496
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:27,982
             Stop!

1497
01:11:27,984 --> 01:11:28,983
      Don't say that word.

1498
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:30,852
If you say it, it becomes truth
            and you

1499
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:31,853
      can't go back on it.

1500
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:34,289
  You're the one who made that
              rule!

1501
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,623
         I can't do it.

1502
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,025
          It's false.

1503
01:11:37,027 --> 01:11:42,930
Look, Gwyneth, this isn't the
         first time

1504
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,699
you've had to make the leap.

1505
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,034
But I can't do it this time.

1506
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:47,068
   That's what this is about.

1507
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:50,438
  On the record, I want to say
          that I think

1508
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,940
this hair thing is the real
     deal and I think

1509
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:57,578
it is going to grow hair, not
       just because I

1510
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,648
          want it to.

1511
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:05,520
  I'm sorry Douglas but I just
          can't do it.

1512
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:07,689
         Not this time.

1513
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:09,991
         Not with this.

1514
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,928
Not, with any of it anymore.

1515
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:15,797
  I think I've just pushed the
           boundary so

1516
01:12:15,799 --> 01:12:22,737
far, and bought into the dung
        for so long.

1517
01:12:23,038 --> 01:12:27,375
And suspended a sense of
  belief , and what we

1518
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:28,509
            do here.

1519
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:31,746
  And in, my life that I don't
            even know

1520
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:35,983
what's true or real anymore.

1521
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:42,557
      I've gotta believe.

1522
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:06,547
I just needed to start at the
         beginning.

1523
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:23,631
       Everyone welcome?

1524
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:25,566
         Pam was right.

1525
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:27,168
I had been knocking on one door
            hoping

1526
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:33,441
      another would open.

1527
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:38,446
    Give it all back to me.

1528
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:40,047
    What I've done for you.

1529
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,783
     What I do through you.

1530
01:13:41,785 --> 01:13:42,683
    Give it all back to me.

1531
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:44,886
<i> Give it all back to me (That's</i>
        <i> what the Lord</i>

1532
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:45,486
             said).

1533
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:47,755
  <i> Give it all back to me (What</i>
         <i> I've done for</i>

1534
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:48,790
             you).

1535
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:50,124
    What I've done for you.

1536
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:51,626
     What I do through you.

1537
01:13:51,628 --> 01:13:52,860
    Give it all back to me.

1538
01:13:52,862 --> 01:13:54,195
Give it all back.

1539
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:55,797
Give it all back.

1540
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:57,131
    What I've done for you.

1541
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:58,633
     What I do through you.

1542
01:13:58,635 --> 01:13:59,534
    Give it all back to me.

1543
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,202
<i> Give it all back.</i>

1544
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:02,770
Give it all back.

1545
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,105
    What I've done for you.

1546
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:05,606
     What I do through you.

1547
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:06,941
    Give it all back to me.

1548
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:11,012
    I won't share my glory.

1549
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:17,518
With no one else (I won't share
         <i> with no one</i>

1550
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,753
    else so don't you try).

1551
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,589
   Don't you try to keep it.

1552
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:22,757
         For yourself.

1553
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:25,026
Don't you ever take the credit.

1554
01:14:25,028 --> 01:14:27,829
    <i> You didn't earn it, you</i>
       <i> shouldn't get it.</i>

1555
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:30,765
Don't you know that pride comes
         <i> before every</i>

<i> Give it back, back, back, all</i>
            <i> back.</i>

1558
01:14:33,169 --> 01:14:35,503
      Give the glory back.

1559
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:37,238
    Give it all back to me.

1560
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:41,209
    Give it all back to me.

1561
01:14:41,211 --> 01:14:43,077
    What I've done for you.

1562
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:44,912
     What I do through you.

1563
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,581
    Give it all back to me.

1564
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:47,882
    Give it all back to me.

1565
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,217
    Give it all back to me.

1566
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:50,751
    What I've done for you.

1567
01:14:50,753 --> 01:14:52,053
     What I do through you.

1568
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:52,954
    Give it all back to me.

1569
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,056
<i> Give it all back.</i>

1570
01:14:55,058 --> 01:14:56,224
       Give it all back.

1571
01:14:58,194 --> 01:14:59,694
    What I've done for you.

1572
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,028
     What I do through you.

1573
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:01,896
    Give it all back to me.

1574
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:03,931
<i> Give it all back.</i>

1575
01:15:03,933 --> 01:15:07,034
       Give it all back.

1576
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,569
    What I've done for you.

1577
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:09,770
     What I do through you.

1578
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:18,846
        It is so clear.

1579
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:22,750
  I am so clear and there's no
           going back.

1580
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:24,685
            No more.

1581
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,520
         I need truth.

1582
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:29,123
Okay, and how exactly did you
        come to this

1583
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:30,057
        sudden epiphany?

1584
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:32,527
   I think it was my driftwood
             Jesus.

1585
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:33,027
           Say what?

1586
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:37,965
It's a long story but for the
       first time, in

1587
01:15:37,967 --> 01:15:41,035
a long time in my life it just
          felt true.

1588
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,170
        True feels good.

1589
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:44,739
     It feels really good.

1590
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,274
And I don't know where this is
          gonna go.

1591
01:15:46,276 --> 01:15:47,808
  But I know I just have to go
            with it,

1592
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,043
  whether it takes me there or
              not.

1593
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,945
But it's not about the cheese,
          it's about

1594
01:15:50,947 --> 01:15:56,918
       the journey to it.

1595
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:58,753
For everyone who asks receives
         and the one

1596
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:02,189
who seeks finds, and to the one
         who knocks--

1597
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:03,791
       it will be opened.

1598
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:06,160
          Matthew-7-8.

1599
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:07,595
           Wait, you?

1600
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,664
   Right under your nose huh?

1601
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:10,765
             What?

1602
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:13,734
Pam I've known you for
 years and how did I

1603
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:14,235
           miss that?

1604
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:16,637
And why didn't you say anything
          through all

1605
01:16:16,639 --> 01:16:17,705
            of this?

1606
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:18,773
    Oh no it's not my style.

1607
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,575
    You don't wear a cross or
            anything?

1608
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,143
      Really not my style.

1609
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:22,777
              Huh.

1610
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,745
But you seemed like you were so
          against the

1611
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:25,947
      whole Mingle thing.

1612
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:26,981
   I wasn't against anything.

1613
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:28,916
I told you it was for
Christians looking for

1614
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:29,784
       other Christians.

1615
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:31,953
Who wanted to share a true love
          for Christ.

1616
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:34,822
   And no matter what you may
        think, you're not

1617
01:16:34,824 --> 01:16:41,095
        quite there yet.

1618
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,231
             Yeah.

1619
01:16:44,233 --> 01:16:46,334
  I've got a lot of work to do
              but,

1620
01:16:46,336 --> 01:16:49,704
        I want to do it.

1621
01:16:49,706 --> 01:16:54,141
       And not for Paul.

1622
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,944
I mean, if he were a part
    of the deal that

1623
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,713
         would be fine.

1624
01:16:58,715 --> 01:17:00,948
But, I want to do this for me.

1625
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:04,619
I want a relationship with him.

1626
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,954
   I, I want him in my life.

1627
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,289
              Who?

1628
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,157
              Him.

1629
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:13,260
              Who?

1630
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:14,328
              Him.

1631
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,063
       I didn't hear you.

1632
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:16,864
             Jesus.

1633
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:18,332
I couldn't hear you, what'd you
             say?

1634
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:20,001
  Ok I want Jesus in my life.

1635
01:17:20,003 --> 01:17:21,268
      There we go, I said.

1636
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:22,803
     Can you say it louder?

1637
01:17:22,805 --> 01:17:24,271
    I want Jesus in my life!

1638
01:17:24,273 --> 01:17:28,042
         There you go.

1639
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,099
      Hey it's Paul here.

1640
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,300
   I'm back from old Mexico.

1641
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:55,870
Leave me a message and I will
         get back to

1642
01:17:55,872 --> 01:18:01,642
              you.

1643
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:24,298
          Knock knock.

1644
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:26,467
            Oh wow!

1645
01:18:26,469 --> 01:18:33,040
      This is a surprise.

1646
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:39,780
Let me catch up with you guys.

1647
01:18:39,782 --> 01:18:42,717
Do you want to come in here?

1648
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,354
        That'd be great.

1649
01:18:47,356 --> 01:18:50,458
Knock knock you never said
       who's there.

1650
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,893
       Okay, who's there?

1651
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,495
            Heaven.

1652
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:55,863
          Heaven who?

1653
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:58,265
     Heaven you missed me?

1654
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00,401
             Cute.

1655
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:04,905
    It's really dumb I know.

1656
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,508
I really wanted to tell you I'm
            sorry.

1657
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:10,277
I'm so sorry, for everything I
             did.

1658
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:13,748
Lying to you and deceiving you
           which by

1659
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,184
definition is the same thing.

1660
01:19:17,186 --> 01:19:19,120
           I'm sorry.

1661
01:19:19,122 --> 01:19:21,088
And I hope with all of my heart
         that you can

1662
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:26,160
forgive me someday, no strings
          attached.

1663
01:19:26,162 --> 01:19:28,796
   I just wanted to say that.

1664
01:19:28,798 --> 01:19:31,899
        Gosh of course.

1665
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:34,869
           Forgiven.

1666
01:19:34,871 --> 01:19:39,039
That is really thoughtful and,
           and very

1667
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,241
             sweet.

1668
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,075
        I appreciate it.

1669
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,077
And I, also wanted to say thank
           you, for

1670
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:44,345
        opening my eyes.

1671
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:48,315
And my heart to all of this.

1672
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:50,017
You woke something up in
    me that had just

1673
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:54,455
been, I guess it had been there
          all along.

1674
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:57,291
But I don't know, maybe
  that was his plan.

1675
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:01,462
Maybe that's the reason we met.

1676
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:03,430
         Nothing more.

1677
01:20:03,432 --> 01:20:04,165
             Right.

1678
01:20:04,167 --> 01:20:05,533
I don't know where it's going
        but, for the

1679
01:20:05,535 --> 01:20:07,535
first time I just, I have this
           sense of

1680
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:10,104
      purpose in my life.

1681
01:20:10,106 --> 01:20:11,105
        That's awesome.

1682
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,174
The heart of a man plans
    his way but the

1683
01:20:13,176 --> 01:20:15,142
  Lord establishes his steps.

1684
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:19,346
Wow, you have been doing your
          homework.

1685
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:22,950
          Yes I have.

1686
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:24,185
   Do you mind us coming in?

1687
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:28,589
    Oh Gwyneth, what a lovely
            surprise.

1688
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:32,993
           Hi Gwinny.

1689
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,261
              Hi.

1690
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:39,466
   Gwyneth was just telling me
           about this

1691
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:41,368
   amazing journey she's on.

1692
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,436
              Oh?

1693
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:43,404
       That's wonderful.

1694
01:20:43,406 --> 01:20:46,240
  Yeah, you know, it's kind of
            more of a

1695
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:47,041
        weekend getaway.

1696
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,243
Really I wouldn't actually call
         it a journey

1697
01:20:49,245 --> 01:20:49,944
              yet.

1698
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:51,312
I'm just kind of cutting that
          baby path

1699
01:20:51,314 --> 01:20:52,580
through the jungle to Jesus,
         you know?

1700
01:20:52,582 --> 01:20:56,851
But just my, my sights are on
        the Lord, and

1701
01:20:56,853 --> 01:21:02,623
just yep that good ol' pathway
          to heaven.

1702
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,991
          Right there.

1703
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:05,593
    That's where I'm going.

1704
01:21:05,595 --> 01:21:07,127
             Okay.

1705
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:12,099
              Bye.

1706
01:21:53,508 --> 01:21:55,409
      Gabby had her baby.

1707
01:21:55,411 --> 01:21:56,610
            Did she?

1708
01:21:56,612 --> 01:21:57,912
        Down in Mexico?

1709
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,079
   Right there in the square.

1710
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:00,547
Just like she wanted without a
            hitch.

1711
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:02,683
That's awesome, and so public.

1712
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:08,222
Yeah it's a beautiful, healthy
          baby boy.

1713
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:12,226
          Praise God.

1714
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:14,628
  Alright you look like you're
         chomping at the

1715
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:19,667
bit to say something, so go on
         just say it.

1716
01:22:19,669 --> 01:22:21,702
You think you can handle it?

1717
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:26,440
           We'll see.

1718
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,274
             Okay.

1719
01:22:27,276 --> 01:22:29,543
On one hand I'm really
    happy for you.

1720
01:22:29,545 --> 01:22:31,512
    I am, just like I said.

1721
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:34,148
But, on the other hand I'm kind
              of

1722
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:37,084
    disappointed in you too.

1723
01:22:37,086 --> 01:22:38,719
      You're disappointed?

1724
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:39,954
Okay look I know I messed up.

1725
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:41,956
I wasn't truthful with you, and
          I am paying

1726
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,257
      the price for that.

1727
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,626
But, I'm kind of wondering what
             your

1728
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:49,029
   deception is costing you.

1729
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:49,496
             Kelly?

1730
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:53,434
   If you're really happy, I'm
        happy, but isn't

1731
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:54,435
   it just a little obvious?

1732
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:56,971
  Actually I think it's pretty
         amazing that we

1733
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:59,106
practically grew up together,
        and then one

1734
01:22:59,108 --> 01:23:03,243
day I turn around and there she
              is.

1735
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:06,113
      It's like driftwood.

1736
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:09,016
You're not your dad, you
   are not your mom.

1737
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:12,286
You're you, and Kelly's a great
           girl and,

1738
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:13,520
you know what, God is probably
          gonna like

1739
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:15,689
   unload about 40 days and 40
         nights of rain

1740
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:17,524
on me for saying all of this.

1741
01:23:17,526 --> 01:23:21,762
But, I just feel like you are,
         you play it

1742
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:22,696
            so safe.

1743
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:29,536
When does Paul get to just be
            Paul?

1744
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:32,706
Like this church I've
   been going to.

1745
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:33,774
Totally chill and laid back.

1746
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:36,010
   Does that make it any less
         Christian than

1747
01:23:36,012 --> 01:23:37,411
       the one you go to?

1748
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:38,245
         No, it can't.

1749
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:40,080
But it does make it more me,
       and it doesn't

1750
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:43,717
make it right or wrong but it's
           the way I

1751
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,020
       can relate to God.

1752
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:47,588
      Chill and laid back.

1753
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,724
Not exactly how I would
 describe you, but go

1754
01:23:50,726 --> 01:23:55,829
             ahead.

1755
01:23:55,831 --> 01:24:00,334
I don't know if Kelly is
     on your path.

1756
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:05,472
She may be, but it's like your
        life has been

1757
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:10,377
planned and laid out for you,
         by everyone

1758
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,546
            but you.

1759
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:16,350
Just locked, stock and Jesus.

1760
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:18,685
      It's your turn Paul.

1761
01:24:18,687 --> 01:24:21,188
       Take some chances.

1762
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:28,095
Give safe a break, and be your
           own man.

1763
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:31,598
          Just be you.

1764
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,234
         You finished?

1765
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,203
             Yeah.

1766
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:41,508
  Yeah I guess, I guess I am.

1767
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:42,176
             Good.

1768
01:24:42,178 --> 01:24:44,111
I don't think it's a good idea
         that we see

1769
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:45,312
      each other anymore.

1770
01:24:45,314 --> 01:24:48,115
   I'll pray for you, I will.

1771
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:50,150
But you are so off base here.

1772
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:51,085
      Starting with Kelly.

1773
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,786
No, I wasn't trying to be rude
         about Kelly.

1774
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:54,755
You spend 5 minutes carving
     your way through

1775
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,723
your jungle to Jesus, and you
       think that you

1776
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:59,293
    have it all figured out.

1777
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:01,261
I like you Gwyneth and I'm not
          gonna lie

1778
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:05,833
     about that, and you are
       definitely one of a

1779
01:25:05,835 --> 01:25:11,605
kind, and I have no doubt
    of the incredible

1780
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,440
    journey that you're on.

1781
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:16,276
Or that Jesus is waiting
   for you with open

1782
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:18,212
             arms.

1783
01:25:18,214 --> 01:25:20,180
             But I.

1784
01:25:20,182 --> 01:25:25,686
like I said, I'll pray for you
          but beyond

1785
01:25:25,688 --> 01:25:31,859
             that.

1786
01:25:53,214 --> 01:25:58,685
I was kidding about
the 40 days .

1787
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:04,658
You don't even have a sense of
            humor.

1788
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,628
   Okay that was wrong of me.

1789
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:13,834
           I'm sorry.

1790
01:27:00,982 --> 01:27:01,882
        Please hear me.

1791
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:04,451
I realized it wasn't enough to
          talk about

1792
01:27:04,453 --> 01:27:05,285
              God.

1793
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:11,825
I needed to know God
personally .

1794
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:18,332
So we started a conversation.

1795
01:27:18,334 --> 01:27:22,903
        Leave me alone!

1796
01:27:22,905 --> 01:27:24,705
            Really?

1797
01:27:24,707 --> 01:27:31,245
       You're so obvious.

1798
01:27:32,413 --> 01:27:37,985
            Really?

1799
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,622
I remembered at my church the
          preacher

1800
01:27:41,624 --> 01:27:43,624
saying that Jesus died for my
         sin on the

1801
01:27:43,626 --> 01:27:44,992
  cross, and he told me if I'd
          turn from my

1802
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:48,595
sin and ask Jesus into my life,
           he would

1803
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:49,596
            come in.

1804
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,798
   I know, a little heavy, but
         through all my

1805
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,769
   tears that night I finally
         understood what

1806
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:57,971
          that meant.

1807
01:27:57,973 --> 01:27:59,906
  Maybe you're knocking on one
           door hoping

1808
01:27:59,908 --> 01:28:00,907
       another will open.

1809
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:04,978
I knocked on one more door, his
           door, and

1810
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:06,613
        boy did it open.

1811
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,382
    You're 3E right Hayden?

1812
01:28:08,384 --> 01:28:14,855
I've got your mail right here.

1813
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:52,859
Dear Senorita, me sorry for my
         English not

1814
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:53,760
            so good.

1815
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:58,765
I want to say 'Hi and thank you
           very much

1816
01:28:58,767 --> 01:28:59,700
    for coming to San Luis'.

1817
01:28:59,702 --> 01:29:02,402
My village, it looks so pretty
        again, almost

1818
01:29:02,404 --> 01:29:03,837
      like it was before.

1819
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,606
It is like what you
taught us in school.

1820
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,342
   When bad things happened.

1821
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:09,743
     God made us stronger.

1822
01:29:09,745 --> 01:29:12,946
   Just like you made our new
        church stronger.

1823
01:29:12,948 --> 01:29:16,116
I made a photograph of it for
            you.

1824
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:18,118
       It look beautiful.

1825
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,986
        It is beautiful.

1826
01:29:19,988 --> 01:29:22,522
  Sorry again for my English.

1827
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:25,058
I hope you like the photograph.

1828
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:31,665
     God bless you, Maria.

1829
01:30:21,649 --> 01:30:24,584
  I want to visit many places.

1830
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:28,655
  I would like to see snow and
           make a snow

1831
01:30:28,657 --> 01:30:31,992
       angel from heaven.

1832
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:38,899
I think the world is a
   beautiful place.

1833
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:44,471
But the most beautiful is here
          because I

1834
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:50,043
live here and it is my home.

1835
01:30:50,045 --> 01:30:55,482
And my family is here with me.

1836
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:57,717
            The end.

1837
01:30:57,719 --> 01:30:59,719
   That was excellent, Maria.

1838
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:02,689
And there is so much for
   you all to see and

1839
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:05,992
do, and I'm sure you'll all get
         a chance to.

1840
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:06,960
      Senorita, senorita!

1841
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:11,565
    Es necesario que vay a la
        iglesia ahorita.

1842
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:13,967
   English, please, Eduardo.

1843
01:31:13,969 --> 01:31:15,469
    And slow down por favor.

1844
01:31:15,471 --> 01:31:17,704
You need to go to the church.

1845
01:31:17,706 --> 01:31:19,139
      It's very important.

1846
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,074
        You must go now.

1847
01:31:21,076 --> 01:31:27,514
         Hurry, hurry!

1848
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:56,710
      Jose, llama para me.

1849
01:31:56,712 --> 01:31:58,144
      Did someone call me?

1850
01:31:58,146 --> 01:32:04,150
         No se, no se.

1851
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,721
             I did.

1852
01:32:07,723 --> 01:32:09,155
             Paul?

1853
01:32:09,157 --> 01:32:12,092
   Wow, look at you, you look
             great!

1854
01:32:12,094 --> 01:32:14,060
    What are you doing here?

1855
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:15,662
             Truth?

1856
01:32:15,664 --> 01:32:20,133
      I'm not really sure.

1857
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:22,936
   If you're looking for Kelly
         she's not here

1858
01:32:22,938 --> 01:32:24,070
            with me.

1859
01:32:24,072 --> 01:32:28,275
       Not here or here.

1860
01:32:28,277 --> 01:32:32,979
    There only one thing more
         difficult than,

1861
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,180
        playing it safe.

1862
01:32:34,182 --> 01:32:36,316
     You know what that is?

1863
01:32:36,318 --> 01:32:39,286
    Admitting you're wrong.

1864
01:32:39,288 --> 01:32:43,290
And I was so wrong to let you
        go, Gwyneth.

1865
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:47,627
I came here to tell you that.

1866
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,729
We get good cell service here.

1867
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,765
I mean, a text message would've
             been

1868
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:53,967
            cheaper.

1869
01:32:53,969 --> 01:33:00,540
  But you can't do this with a
              text.

1870
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:05,145
So you maybe still
like me then ?

1871
01:33:05,147 --> 01:33:08,715
   Truth is I never stopped.

1872
01:33:08,717 --> 01:33:14,921
          Me neither.

1873
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:24,631
I think we're being watched.

1874
01:33:26,033 --> 01:33:28,301
       Do you want to meet
            my kids?

1875
01:33:28,303 --> 01:33:31,171
   I like the sound of that.

1876
01:33:31,173 --> 01:33:33,239
            Come on.

1877
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:35,642
  So your papa, I've gotten to
          know him on a

1878
01:33:35,644 --> 01:33:37,644
little on his visits down here.

1879
01:33:37,646 --> 01:33:39,479
And he is just an awesome guy.

1880
01:33:39,481 --> 01:33:42,849
And your momma, well,we're
     going to have to

1881
01:33:42,851 --> 01:33:44,184
     work on her a little.

1882
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:47,220
  She's definitely an acquired
             taste.

1883
01:33:47,222 --> 01:33:49,255
   Speaking of which, I don't
         suppose we can

1884
01:33:49,257 --> 01:33:51,825
score some sushi around here?

1885
01:33:51,827 --> 01:33:54,194
       Don't even try it.

1886
01:33:54,196 --> 01:33:57,897
          You got me.

1887
01:33:57,899 --> 01:33:58,665
              Hi!

1888
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:00,734
   You guys, wanna say 'hi' to
              Paul?

1889
01:34:00,736 --> 01:34:02,068
              Hey!

1890
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,103
              Hey!

1891
01:34:03,105 --> 01:34:05,639
     Hey you wanna show him

1892
01:34:05,641 --> 01:34:06,740
            around?

1893
01:34:06,742 --> 01:34:08,274
      Show me the hamster!

1894
01:34:08,276 --> 01:34:09,809
             Yeah!

1895
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:10,377
             Hello!

1896
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:20,353
        The love of God

1897
01:34:20,355 --> 01:34:26,993
    and love is never blind.

1898
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:34,768
  <i> You see all the wrongs I've</i>
         <i> tried to hide.</i>

1899
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:42,275
<i> But you stay right by my side</i>
        <i> when all the</i>

1900
01:34:42,277 --> 01:34:45,912
        world does not.

1901
01:34:45,914 --> 01:34:52,786
<i> You're the one safe soul I've</i>
            <i> got.</i>

1902
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:59,759
  <i> Man's greatest fear is being</i>
         <i> alone and his</i>

1903
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:04,297
   You'll still love me when I
          start getting

1904
01:35:04,299 --> 01:35:05,165
    old and wrinkly, right?

1905
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:07,367
   As long as you love me if I
           start going

1906
01:35:07,369 --> 01:35:09,936
          bald, right?

1907
01:35:09,938 --> 01:35:12,305
             Start?

1908
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:18,411
            Really?

1909
01:35:18,413 --> 01:35:20,313
I used to think I knew it all.

1910
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:23,149
   I had all the answers and I
        could spin a lie

1911
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:24,417
     with the best of 'em.

1912
01:35:24,419 --> 01:35:29,089
Now I'm pretty sure I
 don't know anything

1913
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:31,357
except Jesus is there for us.

1914
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:34,160
All we have to do is call his
            name.

1915
01:35:34,162 --> 01:35:35,829
         And Mr. Right?

1916
01:35:35,831 --> 01:35:36,396
        He's there too.

1917
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:38,998
You just have to reach into
      your heart and,

1918
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,435
     discover what's true.

1919
01:35:59,154 --> 01:35:59,819
          done wrong.

1920
01:35:59,821 --> 01:36:04,324
<i> We already know, I think it's</i>
       <i> time for us to</i>

1921
01:36:04,326 --> 01:36:09,028
<i> find the freedom and the trust</i>
          <i> of letting</i>

1922
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,896
              go.

1923
01:36:09,898 --> 01:36:13,933
<i> Let's take some time to thank</i>
         <i> Him for the</i>

Wave our hands high in the air.

          <i> is enough.</i>

      sadness into dance.

1936
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:03,550
     We have been changed.

1937
01:37:03,552 --> 01:37:08,521
<i> Let's take this time to thank</i>
         <i> Him for the</i>

Let's get on our feet movin' to

      Grace that is enough

01:37:53,068 --> 01:37:54,100
Can't imagine what's in store

1950
01:37:54,102 --> 01:37:58,304
<i> We were meant to soar like an</i>
