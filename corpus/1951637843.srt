- The problem I've been having...

28
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,997
is that some of my friends,
even my family–

29
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:12,002
If I say anything remotely spiritual,
they get this glazed look on their face.

- [Man] Ah.
- And I know that look...

31

is conspiring in our favor-

better than I treated them.

64

without invading their privacy...

00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,997
and that I am not gonna do.

68
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,005
What I can do is love
as much as I can from where I am.

69
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,009
To make every gesture and action
sponsored by love.

If what you're asking me is, did I make
all of this stuff up, the answer is no.

72
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:19,982
I've wondered what you're wondering.

73
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,985
??will anyone believe me,
believe what I'm saying...

74
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,987
believe where this came from?"

75
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,990
And I guess that
that's up to you–

76
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,993
to each of you.

77
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,996
I only hope that you don't
disqualify or marginalize the message...

78
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:38,000
because it's coming through
such a fallible messenger.

My name is Kay,
and I just wanted to thank you...

80
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,014
for admitting your mistakes.

[Man] Well, thank you, Kay-
um, and all of you.

82

But the truth of it is, I'm still making
those mistakes to this day.

83
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,988
That's why these conversations with God
are such a miracle for me.

84
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,990
They-They came out of a need–

85
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,993
a desperate personal need–
for me to change my life.

86
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,997
And, um, you know, uh...

00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:21,001

at it in the way I'd like–

88
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,003
I don't know,
but-but it's the way it happened...

89
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:27,007
and it's the way it's–
it's still happening.

90
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,009
[Kay]
My question is...

91
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,012
if God has one message–

92
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,015
his most important
message to all of us–

93
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:40,020
and you could put it in one paragraph,
what would it be?

94
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,986

into five words.

Let me show you how to do it.

171
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,994
Tie the line to the tree.
Make it high enough...

172
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,996
so you don't kill yourself
in the middle of the night.

173
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:01,999
I kind of wish I had
one of those old canvas jobs...

174
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,004
that you pitch from the inside!

175
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:10,007
I take it this isn't
your first time pitching a...

00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,010

[Audience Applauding]

184
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,012
[Neale] To God,
there is no separation...

185
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,015
between financial abundance
and spirituality.

186
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,018
In fact, they go hand in hand.

187
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,981
Don't you find it odd
that we live...

188
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:52,985
in a society that devalues
our most important jobs?

189
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,988
- What do you mean by that?
- [Neale] I mean, we have no problem...

190
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,991
giving a football coach
five million a season...

191
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,993
or-or an actor
10 million per movie...

192
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:03,996
but somehow we've got it wired...

193
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:05,998
where people involved
with spirituality...

194
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,000
should be penniless,
celibate and-and abstinent.

195

00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:13,005

- [Audience Laughing]

voting for any of that.

199

- [Audience] No.
- So imagine a world...

200
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:27,019
where money was given
to people who give us the biggest gifts.

201
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:29,021
- Teachers.
- [Woman] Oh, yes.

212

And we can have it,
because, people...

we're the ones.

Just a minute.
[Groans]

223
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:14,001
- Morning.
- Uh, good morning.

224
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:18,005
Name is Oscar. How about you
step out of that tent for a minute?

225
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,007
Uh, what for?

226
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,013
I know you got in late,
but I run things around here...

227
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:29,016
- and you should be aware of the rules.
- Uh, rules?

228
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,018
Yeah.
I'll walk you through them.

229
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:34,980
How about you come a little bit
closer so I don't have to yell?

230
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,983
- Okay.
- Okay.

231
00:22:37,983 --> 00:22:40,986
Rent is $25 per week.

232
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:43,989
Over there
you've got your bathrooms.

233
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:46,992
Now, our maid quit
about a month ago...

234
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:49,995
so we'd appreciate it
if you would clean up after yourself.

235
00:22:49,995 --> 00:22:51,997
- Okay.
- Those cabins back there–

236
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:56,001
- freight on them: 75 per week.
- Right.

237
00:22:56,001 --> 00:23:00,005
Now, down by the water
you've got another picnic area.

238
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,007
Those are reserved for real campers
and real campers only.

239
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,009
Uh, real campers?

240
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,012
They usually arrive by automobile.

a couple of days, then move on. - [Groans]

comes up in the rain...

with a tent and a bedroll–

244
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,981
we call them professional campers
around here.

245
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,984
- Yeah?
- You professionals have a way of lingering on–

246
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,987
kind of like those guys over there.

247
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:26,990
[Chuckles] I should be back
on my feet in a few days...

248
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,992
as soon as I, uh, find a job.

249
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,995
Because you got in late,
last night's on the house.

250
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:37,000
But collection for the week
starts on Friday at 3:00 p.m.

If you're here, I eXpect payment on time.
There's no eXceptions.

If not, you're out.
We understand each other?

Uh, yes. Yes, we do.

255
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,018
Well, good morning to you then.
And by the way?

256
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:57,980
- Yeah?
- If I were you, I would put that cover...

257
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,983
- on top of your tent.
- What's it for?

258

263
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:27,009
Doesn't matter.
How about you tell me...

264
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,012
why Osborne and Associates
should hire someone like you?

265
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,015
We have over 20 applicants.
Why you?

266
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,017
Well, uh, despite
outward appearances...

267
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:38,020
I've held supervising positions
for three companies.

268
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,981
Which makes me wonder
about your work ethic.

269
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:43,984
Or maybe you're on some type
of desultory path.

270
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,987
- It means ??lack of purpose."
- Uh-huh.

271
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,991
Yeah, well, the truth of it
is I was laid off...

272
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:52,993
when the stations were
bought out and consolidated.

273
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,995
I mean,
everything's corporate now...

274
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,999
and I'm nearing 50
and so overqualified...

275
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,001
that you're probably
not going to hire me, are you?

276
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:05,005
Well, the thing of it is, most applicants
carry a master's degree. You don't.

277
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:09,009
No, I don't, but I still think I can do
a good job for Osborne and Associates.

Well, around here, we demand excellence,
Mr. Walsch, not good.

just told me.

504
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:19,006
- It's– It's sort of important.
- What the hell now?

505
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,008
- [Ringing]
- I don't know. It just died.

506
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:24,011
Figure it out. We got two more stops
before quitting time. You, come here.

507
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:26,013
- [Neale] Hello?
- Neale?

508
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:29,016
- [Man] Scrap that there.
- Uh, h-hello.

509
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,017
Hi. It's Leora.

510
00:47:30,017 --> 00:47:32,019
- Hi, Leora.
- Did I catch you at a bad time?

511
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,980
- [Shouting]
- No, no, no, no. It's perfect. Perfect. I'm good.

512
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,982
- How are you?
- Good. Listen.

513
00:47:36,982 --> 00:47:39,985
I told Roy about you.
He'd like to have you come in...

514
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,987
- tomorrow, say around 9:00?
- [Man] What's happening there, Dennis?

515
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,989
Uh, tomorrow would be great.
Yeah, sure.

516
00:47:43,989 --> 00:47:45,991
- Just bleed the line!
- That would be good.

517
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:48,994
- [Shouting Continues]
- Okay. Uh, you know where we are?

518
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:52,998
- K.Y.O.L.
- I'm sure I can find you, Leora.

519
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:56,001
- Okay. Then we'll see you tomorrow.
- Right. Okay.

520
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,003
- Bye-bye.
- [Hammering Resumes]

521
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:05,010
Thank you!

522
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:10,015
So let me get this straight.
What you're saying...

523
00:48:10,015 --> 00:48:13,018
is that we're all having
a conversation with God all of the time.

524
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:16,980
- Of course.
- Can you give me an eXample of what you mean by that?

525
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:22,986
Sure. Um, do you ever pick up the phone
to call someone, and they're already on the line?

526
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,988
Or, uh, do you ever drive down
the road feeling as though...

527
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:26,990
nothing makes sense of your life...

528
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:29,993
and the next song on the radio
speaks directly to you?

529
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:32,996
It's as if the lyrics
were written specifically for you...

530
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,998
and suddenly everything
falls into perspective.

531
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:39,002
Or, um– Or what about
when someone enters your life...

532
00:48:39,002 --> 00:48:42,005
seemingly from nowhere,
and you wonder why they are there...

533
00:48:42,005 --> 00:48:44,007
and then one day
it all makes sense...

534
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:47,010
and you wonder how you ever
got along without them?

535
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:50,013
Of course.
We've all had those moments.

536
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:52,015
[Neale]
That is God.

537
00:48:52,015 --> 00:48:54,017
[Woman]
Well, it happened to him. It can happen to you.

538
00:48:54,017 --> 00:48:57,980
- Is happening to you– and you.
- I stand corrected.

539
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,982
We'll be right back
with Neale Donald walsch...

540
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,984
and his book Conversations With God.

541
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:11,994
[Birds Calling]

542
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:31,013
[Rooster Crows]

543
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,981
I knew I had something
back there that would work.

544
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,984
Great.

545
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:50,991
And, uh, thanks for– thanks for
cleaning up– the shirt as well.

546
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:52,993
I'm gonna look employable.

547
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,995
It's only fear.

548
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:58,999
That's easy for you to say.
You're not the one going back out there.

549
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:02,002
What if it doesn't work?

550
00:50:02,002 --> 00:50:05,005
What if it does?
Neale, you're afraid...

551
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:09,009
to give up the very thing in yourself
that brought you here in the first place.

552
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:12,012
Give up?
I'm running on empty.

553
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,015
And that's why you're here.

554
00:50:15,015 --> 00:50:18,018
Uh, well, no. I'm here because–
because I lost my job.

555
00:50:18,018 --> 00:50:20,020
You're here
because you lost yourself.

556
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,983
Well, right now I just want
to get this job.

557
00:50:24,983 --> 00:50:26,985
You will.

558
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,988
You're ready for that now.

559
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:33,992
This is your opportunity
to eXperience real love.

560
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:36,995
What did you have in mind?

561
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:40,999
For you to be a man.

562
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,004
A real man, Neale.
Not a predator.

563
00:50:48,006 --> 00:50:51,009
How many women is it going to take?

564
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:56,014
How far do you need to fall
before you realize that your behavior...

565
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:59,017
is an attempt to destroy yourself?

566
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:02,980
Heal that...

567
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,984
and you'll be free.

568
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:21,999
[Sighs]

569
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:27,004
[Chef] Come here, Neale.
Let's have a look at you.

570
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:30,007
[Fitch]
Come here.

571
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:32,009
Didn't I tell you
she was some miracle worker?

572
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:35,012
- [Rooster Crows]
- [Fitch] So how'd it go?

573
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:37,014
I don't know.

574
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:41,018
Son, we've been trying to get a look
inside her trailer for years.

575
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:44,021
How is it?

576
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,982
- It's good.
- She make your head spin?

577
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:48,984
She made his head spin.

578
00:51:50,986 --> 00:51:54,990
- How we doing on time? Fitch, you with us?
- Yeah. Yeah.

579
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:57,993
Neale.

580
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,996
We know, uh,
what a big deal this is for you.

581
00:52:02,998 --> 00:52:06,001
Help you with the bus fare.

582
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:09,004
And you got enough time
to get a hot breakfast too.

583
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,006
Maybe some bacon, eggs,
pancakes with syrup.

584
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:14,009
And toast. Don't forget the toast.
And some jelly.

585
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:17,012
Grape if they have it. And some biscuits.
Maybe some biscuits with–

586
00:52:18,013 --> 00:52:20,015
- You eating this breakfast, or is he?
- [Laughs]

587
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:23,018
- Guys? Thanks.
- [Fitch] Go on now.

588
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,020
Yeah, go on, Neale.

589
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:30,984
- My man is stepping up.
- Yeah.

590
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:54,007
Funny, huh?

591
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:57,010
What's the big deal if someone wants
to look at your watch, right?

592
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:01,014
Hey, have we met before?

593
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:04,017
Uh, uh– No, I don't think so.

594
00:53:04,017 --> 00:53:06,019
- I'm Carly.
- Hi.

595
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,981
Uh, ??You come here often?"

596
00:53:08,981 --> 00:53:10,983
- [Clears Throat] Name's Neale.
- Neale.

597
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:14,987
I'm kidding, of course, because if you had,
I would have seen you, right?

598
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:17,990
I'm like a fiXture on this bus.
Whew. That's me.

599
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,992
You'd think one of these days
I would buy a car.

600
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,994
Nope.
I love people too much.

601
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:25,998
I'm a receptionist. I work for
a construction company up in Medford.

602
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:29,001
We are getting
crazy busy lately. Yeah.

603
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:33,005
No. 'Cause the thought of sitting in a car
by myself all day long? Not for me.

604
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:35,007
I love people.

605
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:38,010
- Wait. I said that already, didn't I?
- Yeah.

606
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,012
[Laughs] Yeah, well, it's true.
Call me crazy.

607
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:43,015
- [Laughs]
- It's nice meeting you.

608
00:53:43,015 --> 00:53:46,018
- Oh, are you getting off?
- Uh, you know, l-I think so.

609
00:53:46,018 --> 00:53:49,980
- [Bell Dings]
- Shoot. God, isn't that just how life is?

610
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,983
I mean, people just moving in
and moving out, and you never know why...

611
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:55,986
or if you're ever even
gonna see them again.

612
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:58,989
- I never thought about it that way.
- Makes you think, doesn't it?

613
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:00,991
- Well, good-bye.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

614
00:54:01,992 --> 00:54:02,993
You don't get to say ??good-bye."

615
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:05,996
??See you later."??Till we meet again."
Anything but ??good-bye."

616
00:54:05,996 --> 00:54:07,998
I mean, ??good-bye"
is something that you say...

617
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:11,001
when you walk out on a bad job
or you leave a bad lover.

618
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:14,004
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

619
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:17,007
Well, um, see you later.

620
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:20,010
[Chuckles]

621
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,013
- Later.
- [Carly Laughs]

622
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:29,019
Hey. Now that's
what I'm talking about.

623
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:35,984
[Man] We're talking to
dead people, folks. Spooky stuff.

624
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:39,988
You've been listening to
Fat Friday Morning Freak-out Show.

625
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:43,992
Bob and Jane will be here
with me on Monday.

626
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:45,994
They got a new book called
Breaking Up with Mommy–

627
00:54:45,994 --> 00:54:49,998
or Daddy or Your Cousin
or whatever the damn name is.

628
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:52,000
And they're gonna be
doing a book signing...

629
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,004
at Medford Regasus Bookstore
starting at 7... 00 p.m.

630
00:54:56,004 --> 00:55:00,008
On Monday, I will be talking
to an angry deli worker.

631
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:03,011
He's mad at you idiots who go
and order sliced turkey breast...

632
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:07,015
and then at the last minute
change it over to sliced ham.

633
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:10,018
And then for coming in
at 8... 00 at night-

634
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:12,020
- [Neale] Good morning.
- You must be Neale.

635
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,982
- Yes.
- Leora.

636
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:16,984
- We spoke on the phone.
- I'm Rockin' Roy, the Morning Boy–

637
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,987
- Of course. Thanks for getting me in.
- You're not in yet.

638
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:21,989
- [Roy] Stay young. Stay cool.
- You still have to meet Roy.

639
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,991
- dd [Rock]
- He's a handful.

640
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:25,993
You tellJainey I wanna talk to her.

641
00:55:25,993 --> 00:55:28,996
I don't remember approving this, uh,
drunk Russian guy for tomorrow's show.

642
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:31,498
Nobody cares about this. I mean,
so what if he drank too much vodka...
