1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,003
(silence)

2
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:19,652
[Bus Driver] Last stop, Cawdor.

3
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:23,756
(bus engine running)

4
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:34,057
Subrip by DanDee

5
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,560
(train horn blowing)

6
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,438
(wind howling)

7
00:01:20,578 --> 00:01:23,615
[First Witch] Beware the man
that swings from the rafters!

8
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:25,956
[Second Witch] Beware
the man that swings.

9
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:29,756
[Third Witch] Beware!

10
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:36,128
[First Witch] Who never
lets go, can't let go, beware!

11
00:01:45,203 --> 00:01:50,209
(eerie music)

12
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:41,860
[Vivian] Have
you been here long?

13
00:02:41,894 --> 00:02:43,229
Not really.

14
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:46,265
Maybe awhile, I'm not sure.

15
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,300
Feels like I've
been here forever,

16
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,637
my ride will be
here soon though.

17
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,305
Where are you going?

18
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:54,806
Not far, the
Cawdor Barn Theater.

19
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:58,711
I love the theater.

20
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,413
Something really special
about it, don't you think?

21
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,548
I've never been to the theater,

22
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,584
it's just something
that I have to do.

23
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,286
You'll like it.

24
00:03:08,287 --> 00:03:09,789
Oh, my ride really
needs to hurry up,

25
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:11,356
I'm tired of waiting.

26
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:15,395
I'm tired of waiting.

27
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,631
(sobbing)
Hey, are you okay?

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,868
(cans clanging)

29
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,828
[Roddy] Morning, Miss!

30
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,798
Good day for
collecting cans, huh?

31
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:54,967
You just get off the bus?

32
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:57,270
Uh yeah, yeah.

33
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:58,623
All right, well
welcome to Cawdor.

34
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:00,872
Nice having you in town,
you visiting friends?

35
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,974
No, working, at
The Barn Theater?

36
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:05,645
Oh, The Barn Theater,
that's such a great place.

37
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,314
It's been here as long
as I can remember.

38
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:09,649
But, you know, I
always stop in there

39
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,350
and say hi, they really like me.

40
00:04:11,616 --> 00:04:13,652
You know what, I'll
come by and visit you.

41
00:04:14,052 --> 00:04:15,288
Who are you?

42
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,422
I'm Roddy.

43
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:17,589
Vivian.

44
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:18,757
You going home after?

45
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:20,759
Home?

46
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,029
Nope, no, there is no home.

47
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:26,798
(car honking)

48
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,701
Oh, that's my ride.

49
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,009
See ya later, Vivian.

50
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,721
Wait, Roddy, did you
see where that girl...

51
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,978
Went?

52
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,956
Vivian, I am so
sorry, I am so behind.

53
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,308
(wind howling)

54
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,892
(soft piano music)

55
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:32,932
¶ When the night speaks
far in the corridor

56
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,106
¶ Asleep, the wind,
lullaby baby dear

57
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:49,014
¶ Here in the dark, this lullaby

58
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:57,357
¶ La la la, la la la ¶

59
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:01,394
(song distorts and fades)

60
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:14,107
(blows whistle)
Everybody, tighten it up!

61
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,742
Eyes front, roll call!

62
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:19,112
You hear your name, I
wanna hear a yes sir!

63
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:20,612
Lance Cole.

64
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,747
Yes, sir.

65
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,982
[Charles] Brian Daly.

66
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:23,949
Yup!

67
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,718
I said I wanna hear a yes sir,

68
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,052
you get it right!

69
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:29,088
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,189
Gary Baines.

71
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:32,091
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:32,992
Michael Cross.

73
00:06:33,024 --> 00:06:33,925
Yes, sir!

74
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,894
Neil Stams.

75
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,995
Yezzir.

76
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:37,730
Tina Bailey.

77
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:38,663
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:39,697
Mackenzie Cane.

79
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,899
Yes, sir!

80
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,067
Teri Welles.

81
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,935
Yes, sir.

82
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,170
Lisa LaFontaine.

83
00:06:44,202 --> 00:06:45,537
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,005
Vivian Miller.

85
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,140
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:50,075
Okay, I wanna introduce you to

87
00:06:50,108 --> 00:06:51,644
the Camp Coordinator and

88
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:54,146
Theater Owner, Mr.
Lawrence O'Neil.

89
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,781
Thank you, Chuck.

90
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,484
Welcome to The Barn Theater.

91
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:00,786
Because you've
earned enough points

92
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,121
for good behavior from the camps

93
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:03,588
you were are, we
were able to strike

94
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:04,924
a deal with your
Probation Officers

95
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:06,625
for you to complete
your phase three

96
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:08,561
work release program here.

97
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,763
Now as you've probably surmised,

98
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:12,464
this place is not
like any other camp.

99
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:14,733
In fact, we don't even
like to call it a camp.

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,736
The State does mandate
that we run it like one.

101
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:20,004
I won't lie to you,
there's tough chores ahead,

102
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,206
and you will need
to continue your

103
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,843
GED studies while
under our supervision.

104
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,012
In between, we will put on
a stage play for the locals

105
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:31,516
which falls under the category
of behavioral therapy.

106
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:33,618
Now it's a special
year, an anniversary.

107
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:35,086
After 20 long years,
we're gonna do

108
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,855
a play that's close to my heart.

109
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:39,692
Superstition says
that we never say

110
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,160
its name in the
theater, instead,

111
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:44,463
we refer to it as
The Scottish Play.

112
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:46,966
Participation is mandatory,
and you will get to

113
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,203
perform dual roles as well
as rotate backstage duties.

114
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,004
A word about security.

115
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:55,842
I want you to look around you.

116
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,510
Go ahead, look.

117
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,012
As you can see, there
are no fences here.

118
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,748
No barbed wire, no watchtower.

119
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,617
That's because
they're not necessary.

120
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,620
We're over 20 miles
from the nearest town,

121
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,522
you will be caught,
so put the idea

122
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:11,557
of escape out of your minds.

123
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:14,058
Our staff, Mr. Kosack will be in

124
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,760
charge of your work duties,

125
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,596
Mr. Seals, head of
our studies, and

126
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:21,166
I of course run the
theater program.

127
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,769
Make the most of your time here

128
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:25,504
and it will pass quickly.

129
00:08:26,637 --> 00:08:29,541
Mr. Kosack will now give
you your orientation.

130
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,142
Thank you, Chuck.

131
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:35,213
[Charles] What, Brian?

132
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,782
I've never really acted before.

133
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,951
I'll chip in here,
fundraise or something,

134
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,553
I could maybe sell some weed.

135
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,122
It's kinda how I
came to be here.

136
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,926
I'll bet you're a fine actor.

137
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,661
Shit, you've been acting like a

138
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:51,930
fucking asshole for
a long time, right?

139
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:54,866
Unlike the courts, we don't do a

140
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:56,935
three strikes and
you're out around here.

141
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:00,772
One rule violation
and you're gone.

142
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,075
The judge will double your time.

143
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:04,876
You will be behind
bars until the

144
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:07,646
snow flies next
Christmas, any questions?

145
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,148
Yup.

146
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,018
Seriously, I'm no actress,
so what am I supposed to do?

147
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,821
Well, you can address
me as Sir, little girl,

148
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,123
and when it comes
time for the play

149
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:20,959
you can stand in the back
and be a fucking tree.

150
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,663
I don't really care.

151
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:25,898
Meantime, you can
clean the shitters.

152
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,568
Now let me be perfectly clear.

153
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,370
I can't make you do anything
you don't want to do,

154
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:34,573
but I can make you wish you had.

155
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,975
Trust me.

156
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,812
Let's go!

157
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:45,650
(dramatic music)

158
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:12,912
Welcome to your new home
for the next three months.

159
00:10:13,077 --> 00:10:15,313
By day, it's a working
scene shop for set building,

160
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:18,250
we got your paint
room, my tools which

161
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:21,052
will be locked up,
and by night you

162
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,089
got your sleeping quarters.

163
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,357
Big curtain on the
ceiling comes down

164
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,060
every night for
a little privacy.

165
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,862
Men over there,
women on this side.

166
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:32,030
Yeah.

167
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,732
It's gonna get
cold pretty soon,

168
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:35,299
you got any heaters
to keep it warm?

169
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:37,903
We got some space heaters
if it gets too cold.

170
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:40,072
Some barn fans
for some air flow.

171
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,776
Up at 6 AM for roll
call, calisthenics,

172
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:47,413
breakfast, and then
the fun begins.

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,249
Paintings, grounds striders,
(creaking)

174
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,418
set building, and
rehearsals for Macbeth.

175
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,387
[Tina] Thought
that was bad luck.

176
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,788
Ah, that's just theater folk.

177
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:59,792
I apprenticed at
Chino State Prison.

178
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,995
We didn't worry about no
Shakespeare curse up in there.

179
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:05,798
Moving on!

180
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:11,971
(dramatic music)

181
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:23,948
All right, everybody
grab a seat.

182
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:36,961
All right.

183
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,197
Back there, dressing
room for the guys,

184
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,966
women's on the
opposite side, got

185
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,868
lockers and showers inside.

186
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:46,972
TV room for a couple hours
after dinner for fun.

187
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:52,244
No cable, but all the plays
we've ever done on DVD.

188
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,445
(groaning)

189
00:11:53,477 --> 00:11:56,214
With cable down here, you
little shits would never leave.

190
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:59,085
It's a couple hours after
dinner and then lights out.

191
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:00,985
Ladies, stay put.

192
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:02,988
Men, follow me.

193
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,769
Come on, all right, let's go.

194
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:18,336
Let's go, let's go!

195
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:21,506
All right.

196
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:23,941
Your name, padlock, and key are

197
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,377
on your locker, lose your key,

198
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,746
you run a couple extra
miles in the morning.

199
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,115
If I catch you
stealing, I call your

200
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,153
probation officer after
I kick your sorry ass.

201
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,989
Hey!

202
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,759
You feel me?

203
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:46,031
Work clothes are in your locker.

204
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:48,100
Dress and be out front in 15.

205
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,538
Man, love that guy!

206
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,542
Dude, he'd just as soon
shiv ya as look at ya.

207
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:59,545
Chino State Prison,
man, he'll mess you up.

208
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:02,947
Go get him, man, we'll
all be right behind you.

209
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,549
How?

210
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:07,285
Big slow bastard, wouldn't
know what hit him.

211
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,828
Cool down, sweetheart, or it's

212
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,929
gonna be a long three months.

213
00:13:18,562 --> 00:13:20,064
(chuckling)

214
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,508
All right, dress and
be out front in 10.

215
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,315
Well, we're not waking up from

216
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,185
this nightmare anytime soon.

217
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,820
Let's go.

218
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,254
Hey.

219
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,157
I think I need to get in there.

220
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,358
Oh, sorry.

221
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:47,592
No problem.

222
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,562
I don't think we've met yet.

223
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,297
I'm Tina.

224
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,867
Possession of a controlled
substance and a DUI.

225
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,368
Hell of a night.

226
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:58,037
I'm Vivian.

227
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,438
What, no sharing
your rap sheet?

228
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:06,144
Oh, shoplifting, I got
caught one too many time.

229
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,279
Life in the big city.

230
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:35,173
(eerie music)

231
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:08,307
(loud bang)

232
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:25,222
(loud bang)

233
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,458
(ghostly whispers)

234
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,641
Number 10, late!

235
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,143
Sorry, sir.

236
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:46,211
Okay, work details.

237
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:47,712
On this board each
morning, start

238
00:15:47,745 --> 00:15:49,114
your day looking at it.

239
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:52,083
It's already past noon,
be a short one today.

240
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,251
All right, dinner
bell rings at 6 PM,

241
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,987
after that Mr. O'Neil
will talk to you

242
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,024
about the show and
tomorrow's auditions.

243
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:02,628
Okay, find your
job, get to work!

244
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,697
Let's go!

245
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:10,568
Brush clearing?

246
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:12,437
Bunch of shit.

247
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,504
What the hell are
you bitching about,

248
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,374
me and Vivian gotta
clean toilets.

249
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:18,209
Well ladies, you get bored in

250
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,612
there, I could entertain you.

251
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:22,514
Oh dream on!

252
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,350
Let's go.

253
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,355
(wood chipper running)

254
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:48,439
Don't stand there,
dummy, it's dangerous!

255
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,676
Pay attention, huh?

256
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,180
All right, there's
the wood pile.

257
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,149
I want you to finish
that before dinner.

258
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,417
You're kidding, anything else?

259
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,220
Yeah, watch out for snakes.

260
00:17:01,485 --> 00:17:03,389
(wood chipper revs)

261
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:04,722
Snakes?

262
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:30,815
Supplies are here.

263
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,688
Mmmm, I'm gonna go check
out the girl's bathroom.

264
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,826
I'll be right back.

265
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:20,465
(door opening)

266
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,804
(stall doors
opening and closing)

267
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:43,622
[Roddy] Hey!

268
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:48,559
(laughing)
What are you doing here?

269
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:49,928
I told you, I come
by here sometimes,

270
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:51,462
I saw your name
on the board and,

271
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,499
you know, saw
where they put you.

272
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,665
I'm sorry, are you okay?

273
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:55,734
Yes.

274
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,202
Anyway, hi.

275
00:18:58,836 --> 00:18:59,837
Hi.

276
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,442
Kind of stinks in here.

277
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:04,810
It wasn't me.

278
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,845
Yeah, well I've cleaned worse.

279
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,247
Roddy, maybe you
shouldn't hang around,

280
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,648
Charles might not like visitors.

281
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,384
They like me
here, it's all good.

282
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,785
When did you work here?

283
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,586
(wood chipper running)

284
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,657
You know what, I don't
wanna get you in trouble.

285
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,624
Oh.

286
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,259
Charles might be off his meds.

287
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,493
(laughs)

288
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,163
I'll be around this Fall.

289
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,800
Now I got a reason to visit.

290
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,569
Bye.

291
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:07,271
Help!

292
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,840
Help me please, help me!

293
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,211
Somebody!

294
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:16,215
Hurry, it's Brian!

295
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,226
[Charles] What
the hell happened?!

296
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,228
Goddamn chipper!

297
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:31,696
Almost chewed me up
is what happened!

298
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:35,533
I told you, you
gotta pay attention.

299
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,702
You're lucky I saw you
and hit that kill switch.

300
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,770
Could have had Brian
chips all over.

301
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:41,473
(laughing)

302
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,608
It's not funny!

303
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,242
I nearly died!

304
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,381
Goddamn chipper
tried to kill me.

305
00:21:03,627 --> 00:21:05,797
Okay guys, hang back.

306
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,598
Ladies first.

307
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:10,434
Our meals are a
little different here

308
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,769
than what you get in Juvie.

309
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,605
This is food you
can actually eat.

310
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,041
Go ahead.

311
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,909
Tonight, we got beef stroganoff,

312
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:19,778
fresh lake trout, some kind of

313
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,446
vegetable, strawberry shortcake.

314
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,817
I got my eye on you.

315
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:31,423
(classical music)

316
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:35,026
Well what kind of
group we got this year?

317
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:37,663
Eh, nothing I can't handle.

318
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,866
Eyes front!

319
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,053
[Lawrence] Let's see what
these kids are made of.

320
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:49,473
All right, who here...

321
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:52,009
Has heard of
William Shakespeare?

322
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,048
Anyone?

323
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:57,883
No?

324
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,819
Well William Shakespeare
is considered

325
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,589
to be the greatest
playwright known to mankind.

326
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:10,561
In fact, every 12
minutes one of his

327
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,664
plays is being performed
somewhere in the world.

328
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,101
Now why is that, hmm?

329
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:17,903
Why?

330
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:23,375
400 years ago, he
was writing about

331
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:27,511
things that still matter,
that still resonate today.

332
00:22:29,012 --> 00:22:34,019
War, sex, violence, betrayal,
ambition, lust, murder.

333
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:41,026
Things that I'm sure some
of you can relate to.

334
00:22:42,492 --> 00:22:43,427
Frank.

335
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:46,464
Now this play...

336
00:22:47,597 --> 00:22:49,401
This play is about a man's...

337
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,738
Ultimate quest for power.

338
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,773
And his wife's driving
ambition to achieve

339
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,843
their dreams at any cost.

340
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,613
It's perhaps the most
violent of his plays

341
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,681
and includes all
the things I just

342
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,649
mentioned including witchcraft.

343
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,651
OooOooOoo.

344
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:10,155
Which accounts for
the superstition

345
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,957
associated with the play.

346
00:23:12,656 --> 00:23:14,656
Now I don't want you to be
intimidated by the text.

347
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,829
Don't overanalyze it, okay?

348
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:21,700
All the answers you need
are right there on the page.

349
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:25,936
Now of course if you
have any questions,

350
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,872
you can always come
to me or to Frank.

351
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:29,807
We'll be happy to help you.

352
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,079
I will bend and twist
you band of misfits

353
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:38,516
and delinquents into
the most marvelous

354
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:40,519
characters ever
written for the stage.

355
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:43,153
We start tomorrow,
so hit the script,

356
00:23:43,186 --> 00:23:45,689
and I'll see you all
in the morning, okay?

357
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:47,893
Chuck.

358
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,429
[Charles] Okay, wrap it up!

359
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:52,564
Lights out at nine.

360
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:55,133
Hey, we're all gonna go watch

361
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,867
old plays in the TV
room, wanna come?

362
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,769
Sure.

363
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:10,214
So on a scale of
one to 10, how bad

364
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,083
do you think this run's
gonna be in the morning?

365
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:13,884
(laughing)

366
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:16,888
[Brian} Uhh, Man of La Mancha?

367
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:17,822
[Lance] No!

368
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:18,890
Booo!

369
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:20,491
[Brian] A Flea in Her Ear!

370
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,160
[Lance] Oh sweet Jesus, no!

371
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:23,595
[Brian] Richard the Third.

372
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:25,663
[Tina] Oh come on, blech!

373
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:27,798
Yeah, here we go, crazy kids,

374
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,901
stabbing horses, nudity!

375
00:24:29,933 --> 00:24:31,470
Equus it is!

376
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:33,770
[Voiceover] Have you never
seen a DVD player before?

377
00:24:33,804 --> 00:24:35,040
You know (mumble).

378
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:39,478
[Tina] Okay, all right.

379
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:42,246
(neighs)

380
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,989
This one particular horse
called Nugget, he embraces.

381
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,857
The animal digs his snout into
his cheek, and in the dark.

382
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,259
[Melissa] (on TV screen)
Take your sweater off.

383
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,694
[Kevin] (on TV screen) What?

384
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,096
I will if you will.

385
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:11,109
(eerie music)

386
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,918
(door lock clicks)

387
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:24,522
(ghostly whispers)

388
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:29,995
I put it in her.

389
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:32,096
(mumble).

390
00:25:32,128 --> 00:25:34,098
(door creaks open)

391
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,736
(whispers intensify)

392
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:49,346
[Voiceover] (on TV
screen) He was in the way.

393
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,749
[Kevin] (on TV screen) No!

394
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:52,182
No more!

395
00:25:52,682 --> 00:25:53,652
No more!

396
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:59,057
Equus, thou God seeth nothing!

397
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,228
(groaning)

398
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:09,334
Kill me, kill me, kill me!

399
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:19,009
[Tina] Well that was
some fucked up shit.

400
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:19,977
(laughing)
Yeah.

401
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,646
So 'cause the guy
couldn't get it on with

402
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,083
the girl, he just stabbed
the horse's eyes out?

403
00:26:25,115 --> 00:26:26,951
It's not that simple.

404
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:29,186
Religion and God and sex are all

405
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,154
mixed up for the
kid, plus he saw

406
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,890
his old man coming
out of a porno show,

407
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,392
that'd give anybody limp dick.

408
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,293
(laughing)

409
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:38,963
You're smarter than you look.

410
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:40,298
Sexy.

411
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,766
Hey big boy, that
was a compliment.

412
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:47,305
Hey Mackenzie,
walk with me and

413
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,840
I'll show you exactly
how smart I am.

414
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,108
Let's go!

415
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,079
Charles'll be busting
our chops soon anyway.

416
00:26:55,913 --> 00:26:59,851
(laughs) All right,
well I'm hitting the hay.

417
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:01,385
Ha, no pun intended.

418
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,989
Me and the comedian are
gonna get out of here.

419
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:05,690
Goodnight, Vivian.

420
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,269
Yeah, I get it.

421
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,840
You don't like me.

422
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,910
But maybe you're frigid?

423
00:27:27,711 --> 00:27:28,913
You don't know me.

424
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:30,314
I know your type.

425
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,652
The hot girl, thinks she's
better than everybody else.

426
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:35,153
Thinks that perfect
guy is going to

427
00:27:35,185 --> 00:27:37,388
come along and take her
away from her shitty life.

428
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:40,325
Well that guy don't want
you, you're damaged goods.

429
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:43,860
You say you're in
here for shoplifting?

430
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,663
I say bullshit!

431
00:27:46,196 --> 00:27:47,931
Whatever you really
did, you better

432
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:50,167
get used to guys like me 'cause

433
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,903
I'm all you're gonna get.

434
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:58,143
(dramatic music)

435
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,252
Macbeth, 1994.

436
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:42,113
(thunder booming)
Help me!

437
00:29:43,213 --> 00:29:45,783
Help me, Vivian!

438
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,120
(gate slams shut)

439
00:29:55,558 --> 00:29:57,327
Jesus, Roddy, what the hell?

440
00:29:57,894 --> 00:29:59,530
That's how my mother
used to greet me.

441
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,365
Sorry, I just,
you surprised me,

442
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:02,866
but what are you doing here?

443
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,001
I was looking for
some part time work,

444
00:30:04,034 --> 00:30:04,969
but I think Lawrence
is already in bed,

445
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,871
so I'm just gonna have
to keep coming back.

446
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,006
[Charles] (blows whistle) Hey!

447
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,174
You two in the bushes!

448
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,944
Knock it off, lights out!

449
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,479
I think that's my "cue".

450
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:17,348
(laughs) You get
it, 'cause we're,

451
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:19,117
'cause it's a theater, right?

452
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:20,317
Because in the th.

453
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,120
(footsteps approaching)

454
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,589
Come on, Vivian.

455
00:30:25,955 --> 00:30:28,225
You follow the rules
like everybody else.

456
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,460
Didn't you hear my whistle?

457
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:31,061
Yes, sorry, I just,
I lost track of time.

458
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,831
(gate closes)
What was that?

459
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,203
Okay, Vivian.

460
00:30:41,204 --> 00:30:44,241
Hey, just do what you're told,

461
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,011
these next three months
will fly right by, okay?

462
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:48,012
Okay.

463
00:30:48,045 --> 00:30:49,980
Okay, now get.

464
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:57,120
(static sounds)

465
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:38,296
[Mackenzie] (sharp
inhale) Oh, you are bad.

466
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,331
Real bad.

467
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:42,000
[Lance] Shhh.

468
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,376
(door lock clicks)

469
00:31:57,213 --> 00:32:00,217
(eerie noises)
(ghostly whispers)

470
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,395
[Vivian] No, stop please!

471
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:19,704
[Charles] (blows
whistle) Okay smokeys!

472
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:21,973
Rise and shine!

473
00:32:22,306 --> 00:32:25,476
Time for the morning run,
get that blood flowing, huh?!

474
00:32:26,143 --> 00:32:28,346
(blows whistle multiple times)

475
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,450
[Tina] We're up!

476
00:32:32,482 --> 00:32:33,750
Come on, I want to see
those feet on the ground,

477
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:36,153
that's it, ladies, now
you see how it works!

478
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:39,990
(blows whistle) Come
on, wakie wakie!

479
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,560
I stop blowing when I see

480
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,730
all your pretty
feet on the ground!

481
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:47,597
You'll always blow!

482
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,301
(blows whistle loudly)

483
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:52,269
Shit!

484
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:54,705
Did you just shit me?

485
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,508
You don't give me shit!

486
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,277
I give you shit!

487
00:33:00,076 --> 00:33:01,578
Now drop and give me 10!

488
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:10,086
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

489
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:15,125
seven, eight, nine,
nine, nine, nine, 10!

490
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,696
Suit up for roll call!

491
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,068
(blows whistle)
Come on, assholes,

492
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:27,105
try and keep up, let's go!

493
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:33,577
(dramatic music)

494
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,240
Can I help you?

495
00:34:04,307 --> 00:34:05,375
Mr. O'Neil.

496
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:06,477
Yes?

497
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:07,411
Good morning,
I'm Doctor Lazarus.

498
00:34:07,443 --> 00:34:08,344
Oh, hi.

499
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:09,447
I wanted to talk to you about

500
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,414
a woman in your
care, Vivian Miller?

501
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:11,515
Sure.

502
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:12,448
This'll only
take a few minutes.

503
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,151
- Yeah, come on in my office.
- Thanks.

504
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:15,419
Where did you drive in from?

505
00:34:15,452 --> 00:34:16,420
Oh, Ann Arbor.

506
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:17,288
Oh, nice.

507
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,521
Beautiful place here.

508
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:20,057
Thank you.

509
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:30,534
Excuse the mess, I wasn't
expecting visitors.

510
00:34:35,672 --> 00:34:37,275
Where would you like me?

511
00:34:37,507 --> 00:34:38,742
Sofa is fine.

512
00:34:40,744 --> 00:34:41,846
Want some coffee?

513
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:43,514
Yeah, that'll be great, thanks.

514
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:44,714
Milk, sugar?

515
00:34:44,748 --> 00:34:46,217
Black please.

516
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:57,829
A Tony Award.

517
00:34:58,362 --> 00:34:59,564
Oh, heh.

518
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,164
Pretty heady
stuffy, you must have

519
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:02,333
been the toast of Broadway.

520
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:03,733
Well for a moment.

521
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,603
You know what they say.

522
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,838
You're only as good
as your last hit.

523
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:10,240
Three straight bombs and your

524
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:12,275
table at Sardi's is gone.

525
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,577
In fact, you're
lucky to get a table

526
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,880
at the Carnegie Deli with
three bombs in a row.

527
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:21,618
Yup, Broadway loves
a winner, but it

528
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,521
crosses on the other side
of the street for a loser.

529
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:26,856
You know what most people don't

530
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,359
understand is that
art can be like,

531
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,896
like a popularity
contest, you know?

532
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,498
You do what you feel
is your best work,

533
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,467
love what you do,
but if the audience

534
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,336
doesn't show up then
you're out of a job.

535
00:35:40,871 --> 00:35:43,541
Most people don't work
under those conditions.

536
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:47,144
But enough about me,
you're here about Vivian.

537
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:49,212
I've been her
Psychiatrist for six years

538
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,315
the entire time
she's been locked up.

539
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:55,153
I thought it'd be best if I
gathered some info for you.

540
00:36:00,556 --> 00:36:02,893
What is it exactly
that you do here?

541
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,432
Oh, we focus mainly
on behavioral therapy,

542
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,534
psychodrama, we get the kids to

543
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:13,971
act out their issues on stage
and break their bad habits,

544
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:15,739
form better relationships,
and hopefully in the

545
00:36:15,771 --> 00:36:18,275
process broaden their
horizons a little.

546
00:36:18,307 --> 00:36:20,677
We feel if we've gotten
through to at least one

547
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,846
of them that we've
accomplished something.

548
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:26,851
Do you know what
Vivian was in for?

549
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,719
No, I haven't gotten
to her file yet.

550
00:36:29,753 --> 00:36:30,688
Murder.

551
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,523
She was 15, abuse was going on.

552
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,893
Got a plea deal down
to Manslaughter,

553
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:38,596
but she's been in and out
of psych wards ever since.

554
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,299
The court request that
I meet with Vivian on a

555
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:46,302
regular basis to review how
she's doing before the release.

556
00:36:46,335 --> 00:36:48,905
I'd like to see Vivian
right now if it's okay.

557
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:52,909
Yeah, sure, should just
be finishing up her run.

558
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,418
(vomiting)

559
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:03,653
Oh come on!

560
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:10,393
Vivian, someone here
wants to speak with you.

561
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,362
Hi, Doctor Lazarus.

562
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:14,331
Can we talk once
you've cleaned up?

563
00:37:14,831 --> 00:37:15,899
[Charles] You filthy pig!

564
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:18,368
Sure, yeah, after
breakfast in the Dining Hall?

565
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:23,540
Dining Hall is right through
those double doors, Doc.

566
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,974
Thank you.

567
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:26,309
You're welcome.

568
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:27,344
[Charles] Breakfast
in half an hour!

569
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:28,656
Ladies, your
auditions are today!

570
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:31,548
Men, your duties
are on the board!

571
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:34,385
How you holding up?

572
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,655
I'm getting too
old for this shit.

573
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:40,523
You and me both.

574
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,327
So there any lady
queens in this group?

575
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:46,329
We've got a few queens in this

576
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:47,964
group, if you know what I mean.

577
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,733
(laughing)

578
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,302
Why don't you go shower up and

579
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:53,536
I'll see you after breakfast.

580
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,739
Yeah.

581
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,382
Kind of noisy last
night, weren't you?

582
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,417
What are you talking about?

583
00:38:06,949 --> 00:38:09,286
Like shooting fish in
a barrel around here.

584
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:11,054
So guess your aim is off then.

585
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:13,023
You didn't shoot nothing, right?

586
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:14,657
[Gary] Or he's shooting blanks.

587
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,426
(laughing)

588
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,696
Kiss my ass, bee-yatch!

589
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:34,478
So did you hear
about the first screw?

590
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:37,980
Yeah, we know it was
Lance, we're just

591
00:38:38,014 --> 00:38:40,451
trying to narrow down the ho.

592
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:51,862
Yeah, my money's on Mackenzie.

593
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,101
Oh well, we'll figure it out.

594
00:38:57,567 --> 00:39:00,938
It's gonna be a
long 90 days, hmm?

595
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:38,708
[Jeanette] (ghostly
wail) Help me!

596
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:49,786
(classical music)

597
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,788
Hi.

598
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,923
It's good to see you, Vivian.

599
00:39:54,657 --> 00:39:56,159
How's this place treating you?

600
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:59,530
It's better than a
normal camp, I guess.

601
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:02,700
You look tired, are
you getting enough sleep?

602
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:04,134
A little.

603
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,637
I...

604
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:09,539
I think I need to be
back on my meds though.

605
00:40:10,106 --> 00:40:12,076
Okay, I left some
with Mr. O'Neil.

606
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,677
A small dose, I want to
start weening you off of it.

607
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,746
No no, I need to be
on my regular dose.

608
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,081
Is the OCD getting worse?

609
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:19,916
No, it's not, it's not,
it's not getting worse,

610
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,985
it's just, it's there, you know?

611
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:23,820
What else?

612
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:29,960
I've been hearing things.

613
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:33,664
What kind of things?

614
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:37,534
Things that may not be real?

615
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,872
Okay, like what?

616
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:43,940
Well earlier by
my locker there

617
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:45,910
was this tapping sound.

618
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,145
Are you sure there's
no construction

619
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:50,079
going on upstairs,
maybe sets being built?

620
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:51,581
Yeah, maybe
there was, but then

621
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:54,017
I swear I heard a voice.

622
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:58,489
What'd the voice say?

623
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,925
It asked for help.

624
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:03,594
Okay.

625
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,597
Anything else?

626
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:10,900
Yeah, just yesterday
at the bus depot,

627
00:41:10,934 --> 00:41:13,070
I saw this girl and she was just

628
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,606
so different, it was
like I knew her somehow?

629
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:18,775
Where from?

630
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:21,679
I don't know, I'm
probably wrong, never mind.

631
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:25,516
You know Vivian,
you had a real

632
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:27,583
tough time not too long ago.

633
00:41:27,617 --> 00:41:28,752
I really feel that
our time together

634
00:41:28,784 --> 00:41:30,253
has improved your situation, I'm

635
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:32,589
not saying that
there's not work left.

636
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,992
But I agree with the
court, in less than

637
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:39,096
90 days you can re-enter
society, live a normal life.

638
00:41:40,195 --> 00:41:41,831
I'll never be normal.

639
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:43,500
You will.

640
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,135
I feel that the
anxiety or stress

641
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:48,004
of your transitioning
from the juvenile

642
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:51,509
then prison system are
causing these problems.

643
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:55,813
You'll be okay, I promise.

644
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:02,519
You'll be okay, Vivian.

645
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,664
Hey, who's the stiff?

646
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:16,666
Proby Officer?

647
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:18,201
Yeah, kind of.

648
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:20,115
So do you wanna look over this

649
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,304
Lady Macbeth chick, 'cause

650
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,740
she was kinda bat-shit crazy.

651
00:42:24,807 --> 00:42:25,909
Sure.

652
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:32,181
Morning everyone,
sorry I'm late.

653
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,784
Ladies, front and center.

654
00:42:37,186 --> 00:42:39,056
Okay, I take it
all of you have read

655
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:42,226
the play and none of you
understood a word, right?

656
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:44,327
I remember the first
time I read Shakespeare,

657
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,862
I felt the same way.

658
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:49,065
I promise you, it'll get
easier with time, all right?

659
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:50,333
You guys ready to do this?

660
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,669
Yeah?

661
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:54,103
All right, let's have some fun.

662
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:56,874
Ladies.

663
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:05,983
All right Chuck, who's first?

664
00:43:06,416 --> 00:43:08,586
[Charles] Mackenzie,
front and center.

665
00:43:13,856 --> 00:43:16,759
Okay, Mackenzie, let
me give you the setting.

666
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:18,628
We are in the Scottish moors

667
00:43:18,661 --> 00:43:20,964
sometime in the 11th century.

668
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:22,700
Do you know what period that is?

669
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,202
It was a long
time ago, I get it.

670
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:26,202
This Macbeth dude was all.

671
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:29,105
Stop stop stop stop
stop, outside, let's go.

672
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,907
[Charles] Everyone
out, let's get, let's go!

673
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,708
Come on, let's go, let's go!

674
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:34,111
Come on, come on,
ladies, outside!

675
00:43:34,143 --> 00:43:37,880
(suspenseful music)

676
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:40,651
[Lawrence] Come on,
outside, outside, come on.

677
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:45,155
All right, once, twice, thrice.

678
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,389
Now spit.

679
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:47,723
What?!

680
00:43:47,757 --> 00:43:48,726
Just do it, spit
on the ground.

681
00:43:49,025 --> 00:43:50,027
Just do it.

682
00:43:50,326 --> 00:43:51,360
All right, now curse.

683
00:43:51,393 --> 00:43:52,728
Why?

684
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:53,864
Because it's the
only known remedy

685
00:43:53,896 --> 00:43:54,730
for saying the
play's name in the

686
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:55,832
theater, curse, go on.

687
00:43:55,864 --> 00:43:57,266
This is fucking bullshit!

688
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,904
Good enough, okay,
inside, inside.

689
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,842
Thank you, Chuck.

690
00:44:09,045 --> 00:44:10,247
And don't do it again!

691
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:11,815
The curse can only be kept back

692
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:15,085
so long if you keep
summoning it, okay?

693
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:23,260
Okay, Mackenzie.

694
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:27,864
The lady queen is the
devilish wife of our hero

695
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:30,833
and her deadly
ambition drives him to

696
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:33,937
murder so that he can be
king and she can be queen.

697
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,940
Subsequently, their murders
drive her to madness.

698
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:38,808
Now let me ask you
something, Mackenzie.

699
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,376
Have you ever wanted
anything in life so badly

700
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:43,346
that you would go to
any extreme to get it?

701
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,282
Yeah.

702
00:44:45,815 --> 00:44:46,916
This one time.

703
00:44:46,949 --> 00:44:48,429
No no, don't tell
us, don't tell us.

704
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:50,320
Use the secret inside of you.

705
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:51,922
If you share too
much, you lose all

706
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:53,956
that magic and power,
you understand?

707
00:44:54,257 --> 00:44:55,992
Just use the words, okay?

708
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:57,360
Whenever you're ready.

709
00:45:01,197 --> 00:45:05,869
I have given suck
and know how tender

710
00:45:05,902 --> 00:45:09,239
'tis to love the
babe that milks me.

711
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:11,340
I would, while it
was smiling in my

712
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:14,043
face, have plucked my nipple.

713
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:16,947
Um, okay, okay,
hold it right there.

714
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,349
Chuck, if I could have all
the ladies on stage please.

715
00:45:32,427 --> 00:45:36,833
Life happens from the inside and

716
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:38,969
leaves you from your pores.

717
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:41,070
It's the same with acting.

718
00:45:41,103 --> 00:45:44,774
You absorb it
inside and only then

719
00:45:44,807 --> 00:45:47,911
can we see the affect outside.

720
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:50,880
Understand?

721
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,750
Never say result.

722
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:54,150
I'm sorry, what's
your name again?

723
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,352
Tina.

724
00:45:55,385 --> 00:45:56,486
Thank you, Tina,
how did you feel

725
00:45:56,518 --> 00:45:58,988
about Mackenzie's reading?

726
00:45:59,021 --> 00:45:59,989
It sucked.

727
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:00,990
Fuck you.

728
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:03,326
Okay, Mackenzie, how did that

729
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:05,295
make you feel when
she said that?

730
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:07,396
You feel what, regret?

731
00:46:07,996 --> 00:46:09,132
Humiliation?

732
00:46:09,164 --> 00:46:11,067
Embarrassment, anger?

733
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:12,268
Right?

734
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:14,104
Same things I feel
every time I look

735
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:15,773
in the mirror in the morning.

736
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:19,242
That's oozing out of
your pores right now.

737
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:22,945
That's what we
want, don't act, be.

738
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,880
Okay?

739
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:27,284
You all have the potential
to do something great,

740
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,320
you just feel it inside, use it.

741
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,190
Don't fight it, just let it be.

742
00:46:34,123 --> 00:46:36,793
You have a very expressive
face, you're very free.

743
00:46:37,927 --> 00:46:39,195
Give it another shot?

744
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:42,266
Okay, all right,
Chuck, who's next?

745
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:46,170
[Charles] Teri.

746
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,579
[Lawrence] Okay, Teri,
let's give it a go.

747
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:04,053
I have given suck,
and know how tender

748
00:47:04,086 --> 00:47:06,456
'tis to love the
babe that milks me.

749
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,159
I would, while it was
smiling in my face,

750
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,594
have plucked my nipple from his

751
00:47:10,626 --> 00:47:12,528
boneless gums and
dashed the brains

752
00:47:12,561 --> 00:47:16,900
out had I so sworn as
you have done to this.

753
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:20,403
Okay, Teri, you
have just told your

754
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:22,939
husband you would
pull your newborn baby

755
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,575
off your nipple, while
it was still feeding,

756
00:47:25,608 --> 00:47:27,577
and kill it by
smashing its skull.

757
00:47:28,077 --> 00:47:29,179
I want you to go
back and look at

758
00:47:29,211 --> 00:47:30,914
that sense with
that in mind, okay?

759
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:31,648
Thank you.

760
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:33,383
All right Chuck, next please.

761
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:35,251
Vivian, front and center.

762
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,360
Okay Vivian,
whenever you're ready.

763
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,239
Come, you spirits that
tend on mortal thoughts.

764
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,610
Unsex me here, and
fill me from the

765
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:05,648
crown to the toe, top-full
of direst cruelty;

766
00:48:06,014 --> 00:48:09,152
make thick my blood,
stop up the access,

767
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:11,654
and passage to remorse
that no compunctious

768
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,356
visitings of nature
shake my fell purpose,

769
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:16,893
nor keep peace between
the effect and it.

770
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:21,231
Come to my woman's breasts
and take my milk for gall,

771
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:23,466
you murdering ministers,
wherever in your

772
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:28,004
sightless substances you
wait on nature's mischief.

773
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:49,927
That was...

774
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:51,428
That was very good, Jeannette.

775
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,428
Vivian, sir.

776
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:54,463
Oh, Vivian, I meant Vivian.

777
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:57,200
Yeah.

778
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:05,442
Chuck, give me a
moment here please.

779
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,055
What's going on?

780
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:20,222
Why?

781
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:24,627
Not here, Tess, let's
talk outside, okay?

782
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,996
Come on, let's talk outside.

783
00:49:39,074 --> 00:49:41,010
You're really gonna
do this play again?

784
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,280
Are you sick?

785
00:49:44,213 --> 00:49:45,682
Have you finally snapped?

786
00:49:45,715 --> 00:49:47,184
No I haven't.

787
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:51,320
I need to open this up,
we need to open this up.

788
00:49:51,653 --> 00:49:53,990
Nothing needs to be opened up.

789
00:49:54,322 --> 00:49:55,257
Nothing!

790
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:58,394
I forbid you to do it.

791
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,795
What are you
talking about forbid,

792
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,631
you're not in any position
to forbid anything.

793
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,333
You know the agreement, I
keep creative control here.

794
00:50:09,304 --> 00:50:10,472
You're gonna cast
that young girl

795
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:12,241
as the queen, aren't you?

796
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,411
Yeah, I think so.

797
00:50:14,443 --> 00:50:15,545
Because you're fucking her?

798
00:50:15,577 --> 00:50:17,079
Hey, that is way out of line!

799
00:50:18,114 --> 00:50:19,382
I maintain a
professional relationship

800
00:50:19,414 --> 00:50:20,784
with these kids
and you know that!

801
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,251
Like the kind you
had with Jeannette?

802
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:24,153
Are you gonna
drag that up again?!

803
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,056
Nothing happened, all right?!

804
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:29,525
She just had an infatuation
with me, that's all!

805
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,194
This play is cursed, Larry!

806
00:50:31,226 --> 00:50:33,262
Oh come on, that's
just superstition.

807
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,031
It cursed us!

808
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,250
We can't keep living
in the past, Tess.

809
00:50:56,452 --> 00:50:58,121
We need new memories.

810
00:51:00,188 --> 00:51:01,524
I need to do this.

811
00:51:10,465 --> 00:51:11,668
Okay, Larry.

812
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:19,175
But what's done
cannot be undone.

813
00:51:26,782 --> 00:51:28,785
We're all going to regret this.

814
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:34,356
(dramatic music)

815
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:47,104
(car revs)

816
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,582
[Vivian] Jeanette.

817
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:34,416
(eerie music)

818
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:02,679
(thunder booming)
- Please, Vivian!

819
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:03,545
Find me!

820
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:04,847
Help me!

821
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,187
(thunder booming)

822
00:53:14,289 --> 00:53:15,525
(dramatic sting)

823
00:53:30,306 --> 00:53:31,875
Help me, Vivian.

824
00:53:42,784 --> 00:53:45,254
I want you to know I'm
not a big fan of medication.

825
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:46,722
Why?

826
00:53:46,755 --> 00:53:49,625
Well they tend to
dull your senses.

827
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:55,731
You read very well
the other day.

828
00:53:57,465 --> 00:53:59,501
This is an important
role for you.

829
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:01,503
Why do you say that?

830
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:04,240
Because of all the things
you're holding onto inside.

831
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,811
What do you mean?

832
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,014
Doctor Lazarus
told me everything.

833
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:24,693
Everything?

834
00:54:24,726 --> 00:54:25,894
Mmmhm.

835
00:54:28,963 --> 00:54:29,931
Wanna talk about it?

836
00:54:29,965 --> 00:54:31,367
No.

837
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,838
How am I supposed
to get through to you,

838
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,775
Vivian, if you
don't let me inside?

839
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:42,378
The whole point of
this process is to

840
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:45,048
get you guys to
lower your defenses.

841
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:48,418
It's all about honesty, sharing.

842
00:54:50,552 --> 00:54:52,721
I can't help you if
you don't help me.

843
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:58,795
You know, the theater
is a lot like therapy.

844
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:02,465
You can express
yourself and say things

845
00:55:02,498 --> 00:55:05,934
on stage that you don't
get to do in real life.

846
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:07,901
You can show a side
to yourself that

847
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,039
even your best friends
have never seen.

848
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:12,808
I don't have any best friends.

849
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:16,045
I know.

850
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:19,415
I think this part
can give you a chance

851
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:22,751
to communicate your feelings.

852
00:55:23,818 --> 00:55:26,956
Let those demons go
that torment you.

853
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:31,560
And they do torment
you, don't they, Vivian?

854
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,065
I want you to know...

855
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:41,003
We can get through
this together.

856
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,572
It's what I'm here for.

857
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:45,841
Thank you.

858
00:55:46,374 --> 00:55:47,143
Can I go now?

859
00:55:47,175 --> 00:55:48,944
Mmhm, sure.

860
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:05,428
[Charles] Hey
George, you wanna take

861
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,781
the ladies out for
some yard work?

862
00:56:06,795 --> 00:56:08,364
Men, go wait in the wings.

863
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:10,032
[George] Come on,
girls, let's go.

864
00:56:10,432 --> 00:56:11,733
Come on, move it!

865
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:14,103
Chuck, can you send Vivian
Miller down here please?

866
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:17,373
As the queen, she needs
to watch the auditions.

867
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:18,708
Let's go!

868
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:34,624
All right Chuck, who's first?

869
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:35,658
[Charles] Brian.

870
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:39,528
Just read any part.

871
00:56:40,929 --> 00:56:42,865
Okay Brian, which part
will you be reading?

872
00:56:43,565 --> 00:56:44,533
Malcolm.

873
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:46,936
Whenever you're ready.

874
00:56:49,137 --> 00:56:52,007
What I believe
I'll wail, what know

875
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,844
believe and what I can redress,

876
00:56:54,876 --> 00:56:57,980
as I shall find the
time to friend, I will.

877
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:01,650
What you have spoke,
it may be so perchance.

878
00:57:02,016 --> 00:57:04,019
This tyrant, whose
sole name blisters

879
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:06,822
our tongues, was
once thought honest.

880
00:57:07,188 --> 00:57:10,659
You have loved him well; he
hath not touched you yet.

881
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,662
I am young, but
something you may deserve

882
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:15,664
of him through me and
wisdom to offer up a

883
00:57:15,697 --> 00:57:19,768
weak, poor, innocent lamb,
I appease an angry god.

884
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:23,773
Okay, thank you, Brian,
that was very nice, thank you.

885
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:24,840
Was that it?

886
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:25,808
Yeah.

887
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:27,844
Did I get the part?

888
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,177
Well all the
roles will be posted

889
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,146
on the work board outside.

890
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:33,782
Shakespeare's shit.

891
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:35,784
I'm sorry, what did you say?

892
00:57:36,184 --> 00:57:37,887
I said Shakespeare's shit!

893
00:57:38,152 --> 00:57:39,254
Oh really?

894
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:40,568
Let me tell you
something, Brian.

895
00:57:40,588 --> 00:57:42,023
Shakespeare died
over 300 years ago,

896
00:57:42,056 --> 00:57:44,760
but he's still being
talked about today.

897
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:46,262
Who will remember
you three minutes

898
00:57:46,295 --> 00:57:47,963
after you're dead, huh?

899
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,632
Will you have
accomplished anything

900
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:52,601
of any value or
worth in your life?

901
00:57:53,835 --> 00:57:55,070
The system and
everybody else has

902
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:57,940
given up on you, but
I haven't, not yet.

903
00:58:06,215 --> 00:58:07,750
All right Chuck, who's next?

904
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:13,655
(dramatic music)

905
00:58:29,605 --> 00:58:31,507
(no audio)

906
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:24,960
(heavy breathing)

907
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:04,800
(knocking)

908
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:08,637
Password?

909
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,038
Open the damn door!

910
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,240
(laughs) About damn time.

911
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:27,922
Hey, take it easy!

912
01:00:27,956 --> 01:00:29,759
Jesus, rough day at the castle?

913
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:31,628
You don't know the half of it.

914
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:33,262
What's up?

915
01:00:34,128 --> 01:00:39,134
(new wave music)

916
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:03,425
[Charles] (PA system) Everybody

917
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,794
to sleeping quarters,
lights out in 10 minutes!

918
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:21,844
[Tina] You sure you're okay?

919
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:23,145
Yeah, I think I am.

920
01:01:26,981 --> 01:01:27,949
[Tina] Wait up!

921
01:01:33,088 --> 01:01:34,756
Gary, Teri...

922
01:01:38,827 --> 01:01:40,930
Boy, you guys look guilty.

923
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,365
I know nothing.

924
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:44,233
Uh huh.

925
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:52,407
Goodnight, chuckle heads!

926
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:04,386
(dramatic music)

927
01:02:12,293 --> 01:02:15,498
[First witch] Is this
a dagger I see before me?

928
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:19,268
A dagger, a dagger.

929
01:02:20,268 --> 01:02:23,238
The handle toward my hand?

930
01:02:23,938 --> 01:02:26,241
Come, let me clutch thee.

931
01:02:29,277 --> 01:02:30,812
(dramatic sting)

932
01:02:58,206 --> 01:03:00,409
(toilet flushing)

933
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,490
(screaming)

934
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,494
(dramatic music)

935
01:03:19,527 --> 01:03:20,596
Okay, okay.

936
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:22,898
(Vivian hyperventilating)

937
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,268
Okay okay okay.

938
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,905
What the hell happened, Vivian?

939
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:34,076
He was in my
bed, he was wear...

940
01:03:34,909 --> 01:03:37,813
He was wearing a cloak
and he was choking me.

941
01:03:39,213 --> 01:03:40,048
Who was it?

942
01:03:40,081 --> 01:03:41,016
I don't know.

943
01:03:41,048 --> 01:03:42,384
How did anyone get in here?

944
01:03:43,284 --> 01:03:44,185
Couldn't have.

945
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:45,822
No goddamn way.

946
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:47,956
Who did this?!

947
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,925
All right, everybody
back in bed!

948
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,027
Now!

949
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,033
Put her to bed.

950
01:04:24,525 --> 01:04:25,661
[Lance] How now, what news?

951
01:04:25,693 --> 01:04:28,496
He has almost sucked, why
have you left the chamber?

952
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:29,632
Hath he asked for me?

953
01:04:29,664 --> 01:04:31,266
Know you not he has?

954
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,970
We will proceed no
further in this business.

955
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,338
He hath honored me of late.

956
01:04:36,371 --> 01:04:38,139
Whoa, wait, wait,
hold on guys, hold on.

957
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:39,608
Chuck?!

958
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,476
Chuck?!

959
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:43,179
Yeah?

960
01:04:43,478 --> 01:04:44,880
Where's our sound cue?

961
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:46,315
[Charles] Gary called it.

962
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:47,548
Come on, guys!

963
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,184
Pay attention!

964
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:55,491
[Lawrence] What's going on?

965
01:04:55,523 --> 01:04:56,659
There's something
wrong with the deck.

966
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,159
There's no power.

967
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:00,474
How long will it
take you to fix it?

968
01:05:01,429 --> 01:05:03,665
It's gonna be a
few minutes for sure.

969
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,637
All right Chuck,
let's take five.

970
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:12,942
May I get some water, sir?

971
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:15,076
[Charles] Yeah, two minutes.

972
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,239
Shit!

973
01:05:43,405 --> 01:05:45,045
Roddy, you can't sneak
up on me like that!

974
01:05:45,072 --> 01:05:46,307
Well I can't stay long.

975
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:48,978
I just, you know,
wanted to say hi.

976
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,646
It's been a little while.

977
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:52,014
Yeah, I thought you
were gonna get some

978
01:05:52,047 --> 01:05:53,983
part time work here
and hang out some more.

979
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:55,952
Why, you miss me?

980
01:05:56,385 --> 01:05:58,587
Well I, no, it's just that I.

981
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:00,088
Relax, I'm kidding.

982
01:06:00,454 --> 01:06:01,590
Nah, they don't need me.

983
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:02,724
It kind of pisses me off, I mean

984
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:04,492
I wanted to hang out here more.

985
01:06:05,059 --> 01:06:07,228
Looks like you're
playing the lead.

986
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,030
Yeah.

987
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:12,567
Lawrence is the greatest,
he's the best teacher.

988
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,202
[Lawrence] Places everyone!

989
01:06:14,235 --> 01:06:15,403
So.

990
01:06:15,436 --> 01:06:16,471
Listen, I actually,
I need to get back,

991
01:06:16,505 --> 01:06:18,039
I don't want
Lawrence to get mad.

992
01:06:18,072 --> 01:06:20,675
This play is so much
fun, but I'll see you.

993
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:24,313
We have got to
call the electrician.

994
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:25,713
We need this fixed by tomorrow.

995
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:27,282
Okay, I'm on it.

996
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:29,150
Let's get everybody up front.

997
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,987
Everybody, front and center!

998
01:06:33,387 --> 01:06:35,523
Okay everyone,
unfortunately the

999
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:38,092
sound deck problem is actually a

1000
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:40,663
booth electrical problem.

1001
01:06:41,262 --> 01:06:44,065
It can't be fixed right
away, so you're all excused.

1002
01:06:45,099 --> 01:06:46,501
I'm sure Mr. Kosack
has some things to

1003
01:06:46,534 --> 01:06:48,369
keep your minds
occupied, thank you

1004
01:06:48,402 --> 01:06:51,773
for a great day's work and
we'll see you all tomorrow.

1005
01:06:51,806 --> 01:06:52,875
Okay, thank you.

1006
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:54,242
[Charles] Okay everybody,
in your work clothes,

1007
01:06:54,275 --> 01:06:55,443
let's get some yard work in!

1008
01:06:55,476 --> 01:06:56,577
(group groaning)

1009
01:06:56,610 --> 01:06:58,480
Shut it, come on,
let's go, let's go.

1010
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:16,699
(eerie music)

1011
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:44,193
(door creaking)
(ghostly whispers)

1012
01:08:10,217 --> 01:08:15,223
(dramatic music)

1013
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,732
[Lawrence] All
the world's a stage.

1014
01:08:59,466 --> 01:09:02,270
And all the men and
women are merely players.

1015
01:09:05,806 --> 01:09:08,443
There's magic in
an empty theater.

1016
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:11,613
All the possibilities.

1017
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:13,748
Wouldn't you agree?

1018
01:09:15,216 --> 01:09:17,318
I know so little
about the theater.

1019
01:09:17,484 --> 01:09:18,853
Only what you've taught me.

1020
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:20,755
Well you know about
life, don't you?

1021
01:09:21,422 --> 01:09:22,524
Yeah.

1022
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:26,561
Isn't the unknown
more exciting...

1023
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:29,898
More intriguing than the known?

1024
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:33,836
Sometimes, I guess.

1025
01:09:35,403 --> 01:09:37,271
It's why people think
they can get up on the

1026
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:40,709
stage and entertain a
thousand people at a time.

1027
01:09:42,277 --> 01:09:44,712
Make them laugh, make them cry.

1028
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,715
Without ever knowing their name.

1029
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:50,418
But you have to be
willing to fail,

1030
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,521
take chances, be bold.

1031
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:55,657
And bury your past
in the theater.

1032
01:09:57,692 --> 01:10:00,596
Recreate yourself, start anew.

1033
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:02,498
That's what I did.

1034
01:10:03,731 --> 01:10:04,867
I...

1035
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:07,802
I never really thought
of it like that,

1036
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,873
I've always been afraid
of what I didn't know.

1037
01:10:11,972 --> 01:10:13,609
I was the same way.

1038
01:10:17,945 --> 01:10:19,914
So how did you get out
of your morning run?

1039
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,420
I started in the back
and just dropped off.

1040
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:26,622
(chuckles) Well you
must not be too afraid

1041
01:10:26,654 --> 01:10:29,023
of life 'cause Chuck
is gonna be on you

1042
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:31,359
like thunder when he finds out.

1043
01:10:33,627 --> 01:10:34,595
You know, actually
I've been feeling

1044
01:10:34,628 --> 01:10:35,898
kind of lightheaded.

1045
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:38,267
Maybe I should go lay down.

1046
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,836
I'll square it away with him.

1047
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:42,738
Thank you.

1048
01:11:05,793 --> 01:11:07,762
(ghostly whispers)

1049
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:14,369
(eerie music)

1050
01:11:46,434 --> 01:11:48,604
(music intensifies)

1051
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:26,942
Hey!

1052
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:29,610
What the fuck are you doing?!

1053
01:12:30,043 --> 01:12:31,479
I...

1054
01:12:31,512 --> 01:12:32,948
You are in deep
trouble, young lady!

1055
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:36,652
Skipping out on the run is
a serious rule violation!

1056
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:38,019
I did, I wasn't, I didn't feel.

1057
01:12:38,051 --> 01:12:39,454
[Lawrence] It's okay, Chuck.

1058
01:12:40,121 --> 01:12:41,757
I told her she
could miss the run.

1059
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:43,658
She wasn't feeling well.

1060
01:12:53,768 --> 01:12:55,537
Can we talk in my office?

1061
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,606
Sure.

1062
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:12,121
So what's on your mind?

1063
01:13:14,855 --> 01:13:15,791
Look.

1064
01:13:17,792 --> 01:13:19,094
I've been here 20 years.

1065
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,797
I owe you everything,
we both know that.

1066
01:13:22,162 --> 01:13:24,065
And I've always backed you up.

1067
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:28,804
It's just, I gotta tell
you, I'm a little worried.

1068
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:30,838
About what?

1069
01:13:30,872 --> 01:13:33,607
That kid has got
some serious problems.

1070
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,710
Come on, Chuck,
they've all got serious

1071
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,746
problems, that's
why they're here.

1072
01:13:38,078 --> 01:13:39,613
You really think
it's a good idea to

1073
01:13:39,646 --> 01:13:42,184
cast her in the role of
a psychotic murderer?

1074
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,752
Yeah, she gave
the best reading.

1075
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:46,954
You read her file, Larry.

1076
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:48,616
You don't think
that's kinda risky,

1077
01:13:48,622 --> 01:13:50,057
putting her in
that state of mind?

1078
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,659
I mean look at her.

1079
01:13:52,092 --> 01:13:53,828
She looks like she's
ready to crack.

1080
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,199
That's the whole
point, Chuck, is to get

1081
01:13:58,233 --> 01:13:59,534
these kids to work through their

1082
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:01,436
trauma on the stage, remember?

1083
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,106
I don't know, man.

1084
01:14:05,806 --> 01:14:08,010
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1085
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,012
Okay.

1086
01:14:11,512 --> 01:14:13,448
I mean, you're the boss.

1087
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:15,884
Is there anything else?

1088
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:16,985
Nope.

1089
01:14:18,118 --> 01:14:19,054
Okay.

1090
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:20,721
See you at rehearsal.

1091
01:14:20,755 --> 01:14:21,890
Yeah.

1092
01:14:25,859 --> 01:14:27,027
[Lawrence] So we
have the lady queen

1093
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:29,163
going slowly insane
from the murders,

1094
01:14:29,197 --> 01:14:30,699
she imagines that
she cannot get rid

1095
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:33,068
of the blood stains
on her hands which

1096
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:35,703
leads to her death
by suicide, okay?

1097
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,840
All right, you guys are ready?

1098
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:39,307
Let's do this.

1099
01:14:39,339 --> 01:14:40,509
Places everyone!

1100
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:41,977
Chuck, ready?

1101
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:52,019
And lights up!

1102
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,761
[Mike] Look how
she rubs her hands.

1103
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:07,068
And here is a spot.

1104
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:08,603
Hark, she speaks!

1105
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:11,773
I will write down
what comes from her

1106
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:14,842
to satisfy my remembrance
the more the better.

1107
01:15:15,643 --> 01:15:16,578
Out.

1108
01:15:17,345 --> 01:15:19,515
Damn spot, out I say!

1109
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:24,119
One, two, why...

1110
01:15:25,353 --> 01:15:26,922
'Tis time to do it.

1111
01:15:29,189 --> 01:15:30,759
Hell is murky.

1112
01:15:32,594 --> 01:15:34,930
Fie, my lord, fie!

1113
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,666
A solider and afeard?

1114
01:15:38,198 --> 01:15:39,099
What need we fear who knows it

1115
01:15:39,134 --> 01:15:41,636
when none can call
our power to account?

1116
01:15:43,904 --> 01:15:47,942
Yet, who would have thought the

1117
01:15:47,975 --> 01:15:50,679
old man to have so
much blood in him?

1118
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,618
(wire snaps)
Move!

1119
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,618
Holy shit!

1120
01:15:57,652 --> 01:15:58,353
Are you okay?

1121
01:15:58,386 --> 01:15:59,688
What was that?!

1122
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:00,921
[Voiceover] Mike,
are you all right?

1123
01:16:00,954 --> 01:16:02,755
[Lawrence] Stand back,
stand back, stand back!

1124
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:04,659
Are you all right?

1125
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:05,427
Yeah.

1126
01:16:05,459 --> 01:16:06,193
You sure?

1127
01:16:06,226 --> 01:16:07,328
Yeah, I think so.

1128
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,882
All right, let's
get her to her feet.

1129
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:11,732
Clear the stage
please, everyone.

1130
01:16:12,033 --> 01:16:13,201
Chuck, deal with this.

1131
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:14,836
[Charles] Where's
the damn safety cable?

1132
01:16:16,304 --> 01:16:18,105
There's a first aid
kit in the dressing room,

1133
01:16:18,139 --> 01:16:19,975
you might wanna
take a look at that.

1134
01:16:22,275 --> 01:16:27,282
(dramatic music)

1135
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,025
Ow.

1136
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:48,663
(dramatic sting)

1137
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:55,203
(dramatic music)

1138
01:18:13,488 --> 01:18:15,957
[Witches] Enter
his world, Vivian.

1139
01:18:16,524 --> 01:18:18,293
You must enter his world.

1140
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,029
You must enter his world.

1141
01:18:45,953 --> 01:18:47,856
[Group] Hey!
(cheering)

1142
01:18:49,256 --> 01:18:50,491
Get your ass over
here and have a drink.

1143
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:51,492
All right.

1144
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:52,393
[Mike] How you doing?

1145
01:18:52,426 --> 01:18:53,294
Better, thank you.

1146
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:54,429
Glad I saw her coming!

1147
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:57,398
Ha ha, ha ha ha,
that's so funny.

1148
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:59,400
(cheering)

1149
01:19:00,868 --> 01:19:02,170
So how do you do
this, what do I do?

1150
01:19:02,203 --> 01:19:03,772
I just have it like this?

1151
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:04,840
Okay.

1152
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,275
I can't...

1153
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:10,177
[Tina] Aw, you're so close.

1154
01:19:10,211 --> 01:19:11,813
[Vivian] Oh, I did it!

1155
01:19:12,246 --> 01:19:13,448
[Mike] First try.

1156
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:17,853
[Vivian] Oh my God, I
bet I can't do it again.

1157
01:19:18,519 --> 01:19:20,021
I should not...

1158
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:23,425
That's awesome.

1159
01:19:25,091 --> 01:19:26,193
Oh my God.

1160
01:19:26,226 --> 01:19:28,296
What the fuck, don't
fucking touch me!

1161
01:19:29,396 --> 01:19:31,298
What, you've never
been touched before?

1162
01:19:31,532 --> 01:19:32,768
Fuck you!

1163
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:33,935
Fuck you!

1164
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:36,136
Fuck you!

1165
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,505
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck is wrong?!

1166
01:19:37,537 --> 01:19:38,839
Get the fuck off me, Lance!

1167
01:19:38,872 --> 01:19:40,007
[Tina] Get out, asshole!

1168
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,109
[Vivian] Get out of here!

1169
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,011
Get the fuck out!

1170
01:19:43,043 --> 01:19:44,511
Fuck this place and fuck you!

1171
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,014
[Vivian] Fuck you!

1172
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:49,217
[Tina] You okay?

1173
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,210
[Vivian] Yeah, I'm fine.

1174
01:19:50,217 --> 01:19:55,222
(eerie music)

1175
01:20:02,195 --> 01:20:03,931
[Charles] (PA system)
Everybody to sleeping quarters,

1176
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,266
lights out in 10 minutes.

1177
01:20:05,298 --> 01:20:06,467
All right, come on.

1178
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:08,970
Right here, right
here right here.

1179
01:20:25,019 --> 01:20:26,922
(urinating)

1180
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:33,260
(dramatic sting)

1181
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:53,381
Where's Brian?

1182
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:54,850
Brian!

1183
01:20:57,451 --> 01:20:58,552
Brian!

1184
01:21:02,689 --> 01:21:04,158
Anybody seen Brian?

1185
01:21:04,358 --> 01:21:05,326
[Group] No.

1186
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:06,628
Not since dinner.

1187
01:21:07,595 --> 01:21:08,563
Damn it.

1188
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,399
Okay, we gotta find him.

1189
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:13,134
Let's go, let's go!

1190
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,268
Two teams.

1191
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:17,462
You guys go around the front,
we'll go around the back.

1192
01:21:25,479 --> 01:21:26,548
Brian!

1193
01:21:28,181 --> 01:21:32,487
(dramatic music)

1194
01:21:35,021 --> 01:21:36,090
Anything?

1195
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:37,602
- Have you seen anything?
- No, nothing.

1196
01:21:42,363 --> 01:21:44,032
Get everybody inside right now.

1197
01:21:44,998 --> 01:21:46,568
(music intensifies)

1198
01:21:47,501 --> 01:21:48,403
Oh my God!

1199
01:21:48,435 --> 01:21:49,603
[Teri] He's not moving!

1200
01:21:50,037 --> 01:21:51,306
(screaming)

1201
01:21:52,305 --> 01:21:53,240
Oh my God.

1202
01:21:53,274 --> 01:21:54,375
What's going on?

1203
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:56,044
Get inside right
now, ladies, go go!

1204
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:57,444
Oh my God!

1205
01:21:59,113 --> 01:22:01,649
Everybody get the
fuck inside right now!

1206
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:03,451
I'm not fucking around!

1207
01:22:03,484 --> 01:22:05,287
Guys, it's Brian.

1208
01:22:06,252 --> 01:22:07,487
What's going on?
[Lance] Come on, come on!

1209
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,157
What the fuck do
you mean it's Brian?

1210
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:10,190
[Neil] Lance!

1211
01:22:14,194 --> 01:22:15,095
Hey!

1212
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:16,698
I'll just be a minute.

1213
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:30,444
[Witches] What's
done cannot be undone.

1214
01:22:42,622 --> 01:22:44,224
What the fuck?

1215
01:22:47,728 --> 01:22:49,596
Jesus Christ.

1216
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:52,199
(thunder booming)

1217
01:22:57,637 --> 01:23:02,644
(dramatic music)

1218
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:21,261
Vivian, please help
me, I'm so scared!

1219
01:23:42,382 --> 01:23:44,085
What's done cannot be undone.

1220
01:24:16,617 --> 01:24:18,520
What's done cannot be undone.

1221
01:24:20,854 --> 01:24:23,157
(music intensifies)

1222
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:26,827
(thunder booming)

1223
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,288
Vivian, you have to
leave, he'll kill us both,

1224
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,224
you have to leave, Vivian!

1225
01:24:57,257 --> 01:24:59,760
(mumble) come on, we
need to leave right now.

1226
01:25:00,293 --> 01:25:04,364
(mumble) Vivian,
(mumble), oh my God!

1227
01:25:05,231 --> 01:25:06,501
(screaming)

1228
01:25:07,902 --> 01:25:12,372
Please, please just
let me go, (mumble).

1229
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:19,247
(gagging noises)

1230
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:39,501
(thunder booming)

1231
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,341
Hey!

1232
01:26:21,307 --> 01:26:22,443
Let me in!

1233
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:24,846
Open the door!

1234
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,183
Let me in!

1235
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:37,225
The hell do you want?

1236
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,596
The police want to question you.

1237
01:26:41,628 --> 01:26:42,529
Why?

1238
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:49,203
Brian's dead.

1239
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,505
Oh my God.

1240
01:26:55,275 --> 01:26:56,577
I'm gonna lose everything.

1241
01:26:56,609 --> 01:26:57,711
What?

1242
01:26:58,612 --> 01:27:00,748
They're gonna shut
this place down.

1243
01:27:04,318 --> 01:27:05,485
I can't believe it.

1244
01:27:07,387 --> 01:27:09,256
After all that hard work...

1245
01:27:10,823 --> 01:27:11,960
For nothing.

1246
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,896
This play is cursed.

1247
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:19,267
Who killed Jeannette?

1248
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,503
Jeannette.

1249
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:27,507
That poor, sweet girl.

1250
01:27:28,908 --> 01:27:31,845
You did it, didn't you?

1251
01:27:33,314 --> 01:27:35,349
You made me trust
you and I haven't

1252
01:27:35,381 --> 01:27:38,685
trusted a man in a
really long time.

1253
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:43,358
You killed her,
you sick bastard!

1254
01:27:45,658 --> 01:27:47,996
You have an
overactive imagination.

1255
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:51,799
No, you called me
Jeannette at my audition.

1256
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:53,567
What, were you fucking her?!

1257
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,403
You're not well, Vivian.

1258
01:27:56,670 --> 01:27:58,338
I'm gonna call
Doctor Lazarus and

1259
01:27:58,372 --> 01:28:00,275
have him come over right now.

1260
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:02,676
Jeannette was murdered!

1261
01:28:03,377 --> 01:28:06,414
No she wasn't, she ran away.

1262
01:28:06,713 --> 01:28:08,682
You said no one
could escape from here!

1263
01:28:09,382 --> 01:28:10,617
Well she did.

1264
01:28:11,417 --> 01:28:12,519
Liar!

1265
01:28:12,685 --> 01:28:14,621
You are not telling
me everything!

1266
01:28:34,807 --> 01:28:36,844
My whole world ended that day.

1267
01:28:42,649 --> 01:28:43,818
No!

1268
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,452
No, that is not
possible, that is not

1269
01:28:45,485 --> 01:28:47,587
possible, that is not possible!

1270
01:28:48,588 --> 01:28:52,493
For a long time I just
went through the motions.

1271
01:28:53,993 --> 01:28:57,731
This year felt
different, I felt alive.

1272
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:01,602
I thought I could
finally exorcise

1273
01:29:01,635 --> 01:29:04,838
my demons and maybe help
your exorcise yours.

1274
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,742
No, no, Roddy is not dead!

1275
01:29:08,007 --> 01:29:10,443
He is not, I saw him
and I talked to him

1276
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:12,046
and he was there, he was
there at the bus stop,

1277
01:29:12,078 --> 01:29:13,913
and he was there at the theater,

1278
01:29:13,947 --> 01:29:16,818
you are lying, you are lying!

1279
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,085
What are you talking about?!

1280
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:19,053
You are lying!

1281
01:29:19,086 --> 01:29:20,121
My boy is dead!

1282
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:22,357
He's dead!
- No he's not, no!

1283
01:29:24,957 --> 01:29:25,992
He killed himself.

1284
01:29:26,025 --> 01:29:28,028
No, no, no, no, no.

1285
01:29:30,596 --> 01:29:32,733
I cut him from
the rafters myself.

1286
01:29:35,769 --> 01:29:36,904
He's dead.

1287
01:29:37,503 --> 01:29:38,905
No, no he's not!

1288
01:29:38,939 --> 01:29:40,108
He's...

1289
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:43,811
He's right there,
he's right there!

1290
01:29:46,779 --> 01:29:48,081
He killed Jeannette.

1291
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,530
I loved Jeannette.

1292
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:05,666
She loved him.

1293
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:08,568
You all fall in love with him.

1294
01:30:08,868 --> 01:30:09,804
No.

1295
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,909
(sobs) I tried to breathe life

1296
01:30:14,942 --> 01:30:18,912
into him, but I
couldn't save him.

1297
01:30:20,546 --> 01:30:21,782
(sobs) No, I...

1298
01:30:25,786 --> 01:30:28,055
(sobbing)

1299
01:30:32,759 --> 01:30:35,630
I couldn't save him.

1300
01:30:38,832 --> 01:30:40,435
[Roddy] Goodbye, father.

1301
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:53,114
(suspenseful music)

1302
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:09,697
[Witches] Is this a
dagger I see before me?

1303
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,865
A dagger, a dagger.

1304
01:31:12,599 --> 01:31:14,769
Come, let me clutch thee.

1305
01:31:16,136 --> 01:31:18,639
(music intensifies)

1306
01:31:42,662 --> 01:31:44,764
Okay, no no no, why
won't you fucking work?

1307
01:31:45,765 --> 01:31:47,067
What's wrong with me, Vivian?

1308
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:50,271
I just want to
love a pretty girl.

1309
01:31:51,238 --> 01:31:53,740
But you all fall
for him, my dad.

1310
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:55,843
Oh my God, I don't
love your fucking dad!

1311
01:31:55,876 --> 01:31:56,978
You shut up!

1312
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:00,614
Don't you lie to me.

1313
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:02,149
It's too late for that.

1314
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,086
You're just like
Jeannette, aren't you?

1315
01:32:06,587 --> 01:32:07,822
I have a lot to offer.

1316
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:10,123
I mean I'm just as
good as Lawrence,

1317
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,260
all I ever needed was a chance.

1318
01:32:13,993 --> 01:32:15,862
Then let Jeannette go.

1319
01:32:16,095 --> 01:32:18,798
Roddy, just stop,
just stop killing her.

1320
01:32:19,065 --> 01:32:20,800
You keep playing the tape!

1321
01:32:21,033 --> 01:32:22,670
You're making me kill her!

1322
01:32:24,203 --> 01:32:25,805
Now it's your turn.

1323
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:37,318
Vivian, I can kill you here
or in my world with Jeannette.

1324
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:38,985
The choice is yours.

1325
01:32:40,787 --> 01:32:42,557
What's done cannot be undone.

1326
01:32:43,657 --> 01:32:44,625
No!

1327
01:32:44,658 --> 01:32:45,793
Damn you!

1328
01:32:52,032 --> 01:32:53,967
(thunder booming)

1329
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:55,869
Jeannette?

1330
01:32:56,168 --> 01:32:58,072
Vivian, he's coming!

1331
01:32:58,104 --> 01:32:59,573
(shrieking)

1332
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:02,076
(coughing)

1333
01:33:03,143 --> 01:33:04,912
Why won't you love me?!

1334
01:33:05,912 --> 01:33:07,248
You're just like her!

1335
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:09,048
Why won't you love me?!

1336
01:33:09,082 --> 01:33:10,084
Why?!

1337
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:11,351
Why?!

1338
01:33:11,851 --> 01:33:13,720
(clenched screaming)

1339
01:33:18,425 --> 01:33:19,860
Ahhh!

1340
01:33:20,993 --> 01:33:22,862
(gagging)

1341
01:33:50,323 --> 01:33:55,396
(angelic choir music)

1342
01:34:24,858 --> 01:34:26,827
Charles, I found her,
she's on the stage!

1343
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:29,095
Vivian!

1344
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:33,300
George, call 911!

1345
01:34:34,935 --> 01:34:36,003
Vivian?

1346
01:34:39,072 --> 01:34:41,676
(police radio feed)

1347
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:49,716
Twice in one day?

1348
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:51,886
What the hell is
going on around here?

1349
01:34:52,485 --> 01:34:53,988
I don't know, I...

1350
01:34:54,386 --> 01:34:55,956
Is she taking any medication?

1351
01:34:56,288 --> 01:35:00,060
Yes, but under supervision.

1352
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:02,163
Have you been drinking, sir?

1353
01:35:03,395 --> 01:35:05,198
A little, yeah, why?

1354
01:35:05,532 --> 01:35:06,934
Okay, we're gonna
have to forget

1355
01:35:06,966 --> 01:35:08,735
about tomorrow's sit
down, Mr. O'Neil.

1356
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,704
You need to come to
the station right now.

1357
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:12,071
Nobody leaves!

1358
01:35:12,104 --> 01:35:13,425
I want a statement
from everybody,

1359
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:15,241
lock this place down now!

1360
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:18,412
Detective, we
have a video camera.

1361
01:35:19,378 --> 01:35:20,814
[Jones] I don't know, tag it.

1362
01:35:24,984 --> 01:35:26,052
Whoa whoa whoa,
who are you?

1363
01:35:26,086 --> 01:35:27,087
I'm Vivian's doctor.

1364
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,188
What are you treating her for?

1365
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,389
PTSD.

1366
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:32,393
She's been severely
abused for years.

1367
01:35:35,095 --> 01:35:38,798
My God, was she attacked?

1368
01:35:39,032 --> 01:35:39,967
[EMT] I've done
a rapid trauma exam

1369
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,202
and found no severe
lacerations on her body.

1370
01:35:42,234 --> 01:35:44,505
She's unconscious, but
her vitals are stable.

1371
01:35:44,537 --> 01:35:47,307
[Jones] Doctor, please, I
need to ask you a few questions.

1372
01:35:52,145 --> 01:35:53,280
I'm so sorry.

1373
01:35:54,413 --> 01:35:56,015
It's all my fault.

1374
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:00,755
I gotta go.

1375
01:36:01,421 --> 01:36:06,427
(dramatic music)

1376
01:36:47,333 --> 01:36:49,336
(heart monitor beeping)

1377
01:36:49,368 --> 01:36:50,436
[Charles] Candace Malone.

1378
01:36:50,470 --> 01:36:51,472
[Candace] Here, sir.

1379
01:36:52,037 --> 01:36:53,039
[Charles] Natasha Gloden.

1380
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:54,175
[Natasha] Here, sir.

1381
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:55,408
Franklin Lee?

1382
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:56,342
[Franklin] Here, sir.

1383
01:36:56,376 --> 01:36:57,344
[Charles] Theater Owner and

1384
01:36:57,377 --> 01:36:58,879
Camp Coordinator
Lawrence O'Neil.

1385
01:36:59,311 --> 01:37:00,413
Good morning.

1386
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:03,184
Welcome to The Barn Theater.

1387
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:06,152
My name is Lawrence O'Neil.

1388
01:37:07,487 --> 01:37:10,858
Because you've earned enough
points for good behavior

1389
01:37:10,890 --> 01:37:12,925
from the camps you were
at, we were able to

1390
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:15,328
strike a deal with the
courts and your probation...

1391
01:37:16,061 --> 01:37:18,532
We're just going through
the tape again one more time.

1392
01:37:19,265 --> 01:37:22,536
I don't know, I just don't
think there's anything on it.

1393
01:37:23,936 --> 01:37:25,038
Okay, bye.

1394
01:37:25,438 --> 01:37:26,306
Anything?

1395
01:37:26,338 --> 01:37:27,373
[Taylor] Just static.

1396
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:36,350
[Jones] It's a cold case then.

1397
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:39,220
[Taylor] Yes, sir.

1398
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,606
(dramatic sting)
(thunder booming)

1399
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:04,510
Subrip by DanDee

1400
01:38:05,511 --> 01:38:09,081
(soft piano music)

1401
01:38:09,114 --> 01:38:14,121
¶ When the night speaks
far in the corridor

1402
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:23,297
¶ Sleep, the wind,
lullaby baby dear

1403
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:32,039
¶ Here in the dark, this lullaby

1404
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:40,681
¶ La la la, la la la

1405
01:38:44,384 --> 01:38:49,390
¶ La la la, la la la

1406
01:38:53,193 --> 01:38:58,198
¶ La la la, la la la

1407
01:39:02,735 --> 01:39:06,372
¶ La la ¶

01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:15,215
(electronic synthesizer music)

1409
01:39:17,617 --> 01:39:22,623
¶ Memories burn, bruises fade

1410
01:40:29,655 --> 01:40:34,661
¶ I want to purge
all possessions

1411
01:40:35,728 --> 01:40:40,634
¶ It's hard to clean up messes

1412
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:47,775
¶ And if we lose all connections

1413
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:55,783
¶ Will you hold on to me sweetly

1414
01:40:57,617 --> 01:41:02,355
¶ On to me sweetly

1415
01:41:04,356 --> 01:41:09,363
¶ I can make room
for this moment ¶
