00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,600
-- Hey, what have you under the helmet?
-- Should we run ræs?

4
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:20,525
Come on.

5
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,419
Come on.

6
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:33,766
Come on.

7
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:54,969
Run faster.

NEVADA, 1957

8
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,394
Sorry, gentlemen.
The whole area is closed --

9
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,030
-- Because of weapons-test
the next 24 hours.

10
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,499
It includes all personnel.

11
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:52,648
Good afternoon, sir.

12
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:02,086
It is also, unfortunately, you, Colonel.
The Pentagon has ordered ...

13
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:19,498
PROHIBITED AREA
DØDBRINGENDE POWER USED

14
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:22,579
Russians.

15
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:28,220
-- This will not be easy.
-- Not as easy as it used to.

17
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,877
We have seen worse things.

18
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:33,520
-- Well ... when?
-- Flensburg, twice as many.

20
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:36,125
-- We were younger.
-- I am still young.

22
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:36,988
We had weapons.

23
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,718
Take your hands down,
you make us a laughing stock.

24
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,993
I put $ 400 on that we
come out of this predicament.

25
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:53,140
Let's just say $ 100.

26
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,817
Genkender you the building?

27
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,996
Drop dead.

28
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,443
Excuse me ... I thought
drop dead, pal.

30
00:05:34,093 --> 00:05:37,152
-- How was he taken?
-- In Mexico.

32
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,327
They dug in the dark,
and were looking for it here.

33
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,929
You are not from here, are you?

34
00:05:47,602 --> 00:05:49,527
How would you think I come from?

35
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:51,451
Dr. Jones ...

36
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:57,674
How you express your Rs
I will shoot in the eastern Ukraine.

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,582
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

38
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,751
Three times I have
been tapperhedsmedaljen.

39
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:10,407
And a medal as champion
for better working conditions.

40
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:11,947
And why?

41
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:15,892
Because I know things.

42
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:17,624
I know them before any other.

43
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,511
And I do not know
to find out.

44
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:27,982
And that I need
to know now ... is here inside.

46
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:44,759
You are hard to read, Dr. Jones.

47
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:50,147
We do it here
on the old-fashioned way.

48
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:54,381
You must tell us. You must
help us to find what we seek.

49
00:07:15,243 --> 00:07:19,303
At this store, you and your government
Saved all your secrets, yes?

50
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:23,825
It is a military warehouse.
I have never been here before in my life.

51
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,049
A rectangular box,
with dimensions of 200 x 50 x 66 cm.

52
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:34,134
Contents of the box,
mummified remains.

53
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,482
Does it not you know?

54
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:39,873
What have you to believe that I have
no idea what you talking about?

55
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:45,199
For 10 years since you were a part
of the team that examined it.

56
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:48,856
Listen ...

57
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:52,238
If I knew,
what you talked about ...

58
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:56,555
You must help us to find it.

59
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:09,557
Kompas.
I must use a compass.

60
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:10,760
I know ... North, South, East.

61
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,273
West.

62
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:15,418
Do you have no compass?

63
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,020
I need your bullets!

63
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,346
He will have my rounds.

64
00:08:25,936 --> 00:08:28,977
The contents of the box,
is incredibly magnetic.

66
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,741
I will use gunpowder.
Do you want my help or not?

67
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:47,849
Do not playing with me,
Dr. Jones.

68
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:49,679
What is the point of this?

69
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,809
If it is still magnetic,
will the metal in this gunpowder --

70
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:54,468
-- Show the way.

71
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:24,310
Cartridges.

72
00:09:24,638 --> 00:09:26,579
Give me haglgeværs cartridges.

73
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:30,120
A seaweed.

74
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,864
Drop the weapons,
or Col Dr. Spalko door.

75
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:03,456
Why, Mac?

76
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,157
What can I say, Jonesy?

77
00:13:06,822 --> 00:13:08,200
I am a capitalist.

78
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,237
And they pay.

79
00:13:11,828 --> 00:13:14,779
After all the years we spent on the
to spy the red ...

80
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,080
I thought we were friends, Mac.

81
00:13:19,224 --> 00:13:21,591
There is no will
have gems like me.

82
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,959
All four.
I want all four.

83
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,791
I can not take
home empty-handed again.

84
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:32,832
Do you have any last words,
Dr. Jones?

85
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:36,683
I love fire.

86
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:38,243
Put the weapon.

87
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,496
Okay, buddy.

88
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,036
Shit,
I thought it was closer.

89
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:13,772
Come on ... came so.

90
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,279
Do not play smart, Boris.
You know him not.

91
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,870
You know him not!

92
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:23,810
You made yourself.

93
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:00,019
Hello?

94
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:01,986
Hello?

95
00:18:06,981 --> 00:18:08,097
Hello?

96
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,829
Hey, I have a telefo ...

97
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,946
Just a minute.

98
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:35,936
It can not be good.

99
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,636
"To all staff:
There is now one minute to the explosion "!

100
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:44,208
"Take the glasses on, or look away."

101
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,376
"Do not remove the glasses,
and do not looking "--

102
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,376
-- "Until 10 seconds after the first glimpse."

103
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:51,270
It can not be good.

104
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,728
Hey, wait.

105
00:18:59,936 --> 00:19:01,245
Wait, wait.

106
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:06,568
Yes, fine.
Just do not wait on me.

107
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:08,757
"15 seconds left."

108
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,543
"10 seconds left."

108
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,543
BLYINDFATTET

109
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:01,526
I had no reason to believe
the Mac was a spy.

110
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,876
He was in MI6, when I was in the OSS.

111
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:06,776
We made 20-30 missions together
by the Pacific in Europe.

112
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:10,016
Leave it to your range krigsjournal
ad us. We have all served.

113
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,270
Really?
Which side served you?

114
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:16,073
I think you know
how serious your situation is.

115
00:21:16,073 --> 00:21:21,621
You helped KBG agents who broke into
a tophemmeligt military installations --

116
00:21:21,621 --> 00:21:23,244
-- In the middle of the United States.

117
00:21:23,244 --> 00:21:24,132
My country.

118
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:26,555
What was there in the stålkasse the train?

119
00:21:27,384 --> 00:21:29,651
You must tell us.
You've seen it before.

120
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,370
No, you think of the failure in `47.

121
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,969
I was thrown on a bus
with tinted windows --

122
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,169
-- And 20 people, I do not
had to talk to.

123
00:21:43,626 --> 00:21:45,782
Slæbt out the middle of the night,
in the middle of nothing --

124
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,555
-- The middle of one kind or another
important collection project.

125
00:21:47,555 --> 00:21:49,390
And were shown what? Vragrester --

126
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,825
-- And a magnetic veil,
covering the mutilated remains.

127
00:21:54,034 --> 00:21:56,255
None of us had ever
to know what was going on.

128
00:21:56,854 --> 00:21:59,509
And we were threatened with forædderi,
if we ever talked about it.

129
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,330
So tell me,
what was in the box?

130
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:02,650
Indy ... Thank God.

131
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:04,565
Do not know that it is dangerous
to be in a refrigerator?

132
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:08,936
-- The tingester can be dødsfælder.
-- I am also happy to see you.

134
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,404
Relax, boys.
I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

136
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:13,089
What the hell is going on?

137
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:14,743
KGB on U.S. soil.

138
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:15,694
Who is the woman?

139
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:16,991
Describe her.

140
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:20,832
High, thin, middle of the 30s.
Goes with a sword of a kind.

141
00:22:20,832 --> 00:22:21,789
A rapier, known enough.

142
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:26,531
Yes, it is her.

143
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:27,986
Are you sure she is here?

144
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,571
Yes, and away again.

145
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:30,762
Who is she?

146
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,011
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin lyshårede girl.

147
00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:35,687
His favorite scientist ...

148
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,422
If you can call surveys
of psyken, science.

149
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:38,975
General Ross.

150
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:42,618
She runs teams from the Kremlin, the whole
the world and looking for artifacts, --

151
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:45,443
-- Which she believes may have
Paranormal military properties.

152
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:46,377
General Ross.

153
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,569
Relax, Paul.

154
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:50,839
Not everyone in the army are communists
and especially not Indy.

155
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:55,965
What will I be accused of,
in addition to survive a nuclear bomb?

156
00:22:56,147 --> 00:22:57,066
Not any more.

157
00:22:57,098 --> 00:23:00,334
But your friendship with George McHale
do all your activities --

158
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,767
-- Suspicious.
Including them during the war.

159
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:04,085
Are you nuts?

160
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,047
Do you have any idea of how many
medals, the pigs here have won?

161
00:23:08,372 --> 00:23:09,811
Wild many, certainly.

162
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:12,626
But he deserves them?

163
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,755
Let's just say that you are in
bureau's interest, Dr. Jones.

164
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:19,963
Significant interest.

165
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:37,333
Scalbrade is from 3100 BC --

166
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:40,222
-- And was inhabited for 600 years,
until the --

167
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:42,354
-- Apparently was left
in 2500 BC

168
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:45,726
There is no
clear evidence of why --

169
00:23:45,754 --> 00:23:48,724
-- The residents chose to
leave a perfect environment.

170
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:49,150
Yes?

171
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:50,979
May I borrow you for a moment,
Professor?

172
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:52,887
Yes.

173
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:55,426
Open Michaelson
and read Chapter four through.

174
00:23:55,426 --> 00:23:59,187
When I come back, we are discussing
the difference between migration and refugees.

175
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,326
What?

176
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,810
I had no idea that the pressure
come from the ruling commission.

177
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,479
FBI turned up in the morning
and ransagede your office.

178
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,771
And looking at all your files.

179
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:15,030
You are rector at the school,
why you stopped them?

180
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,894
It was not allowed to.

181
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,478
They had every right.

182
00:24:17,478 --> 00:24:18,617
They were not troublemakers.

183
00:24:18,617 --> 00:24:21,039
They were agents with
search warrants.

184
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,290
The university should not be messy
into the kind of controversy.

185
00:24:24,391 --> 00:24:25,770
Not so højspændt a time.

186
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,634
So, you fired me?

187
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:32,114
Dismissal due
of absence, is all.

188
00:24:32,434 --> 00:24:33,854
Instant dismissal.

189
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,263
You fired me after all?

190
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,247
They have agreed to pay
your full salary, until ...

191
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:39,262
I do not want their money.

192
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,547
Do not be stupid.

193
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:44,055
You have no idea what I had to be through,
just to get it in place.

194
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:44,970
What you had to be through?

195
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:47,313
What might you,
exactly through?

196
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:52,239
I came from.

197
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:01,037
How will you go?

198
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:03,834
With a train to New York.

199
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:06,934
Overnatter in London,
to start with.

200
00:25:07,295 --> 00:25:09,138
Why not teach in Leipzig?

201
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:10,985
Heinrich owe me a favor.

202
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:13,227
I send you money,
when I get in place.

203
00:25:13,227 --> 00:25:14,618
You can send me
the rest of my things.

204
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:16,411
There is hardly anything here,
holding you back?

205
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,667
I can hardly recognize the country more.

206
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:21,171
The government helps us to see
Communists everywhere.

207
00:25:22,016 --> 00:25:25,502
When there is hysteria in the research,
it is probably time to switch careers.

208
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:28,022
How did Deirdre news?

209
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,115
How taking any wife
such news ...

210
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:33,148
Judging by their expressions,
a combination of pride and panic.

211
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:35,618
I should never have doubted
to you, my friend.

212
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,883
No, but you have reason to
doubt your friends these days.

213
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:46,268
Some brutal years, Charlie?

214
00:25:48,696 --> 00:25:51,826
First father, Marcus.

215
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:54,450
You seems to be
reached the age where their lives --

216
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,967
-- Start to take things
instead of giving.

217
00:25:59,887 --> 00:26:01,820
Do not even half a glass.

218
00:27:02,391 --> 00:27:03,588
Professor ... hello.

219
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,612
Are you Dr. Jones?

220
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:08,130
You run out of platform, kid?

221
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,689
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley?

222
00:27:10,576 --> 00:27:12,093
Oxley, arkæologen?

223
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:13,586
What about him?

224
00:27:15,276 --> 00:27:16,137
The beats him to death.

225
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:21,377
I have not talked with
Harold Oxley in 20 years.

226
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,545
He is a brilliant man.

227
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:27,849
He can get you to sleep;
just by talking to you.

228
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,564
That is how I fell
asleep when I was a child.

229
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,621
His voice was better
than a glass of warm milk.

230
00:27:34,814 --> 00:27:37,011
My name is Mutt ... Mutt Williams.

231
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:37,959
-- Mutt?
-- Yes.

232
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,441
What is it for a name?

233
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:41,990
This is what I have chosen,
Is there something wrong with it?

234
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:43,177
Quiet now.

235
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:46,003
What was your relationship with Oxley?

236
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,468
My father died in the war.

237
00:27:47,852 --> 00:27:49,744
He helped my mother,
to nurture me.

238
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,904
And you think that any
will kill him?

239
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:58,908
Six months ago,
my mother received a letter from the Ox.

240
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,444
He is in Peru.

241
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,239
He had found a kind of skull.

242
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:03,175
A crystal skull.

243
00:28:03,502 --> 00:28:07,936
It, like him
Mitchell Hetckiss found.

244
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,841
Ox and I was occupied by
the skull in college.

245
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:15,661
How do you know of it?

246
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:16,680
Are you piss on me?

247
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,764
It was the only thing he talked about.

248
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:20,157
Is it a kind of statue?

249
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:22,967
A meso-American carved figure.

250
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:27,415
There are few krystalkranier in the world.
I saw one on "The British Museum".

251
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,961
Interestingly hand,
but more is not it?

252
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:33,682
Grin only.

253
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,040
Ox said that he had
found it, this time.

254
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,695
He said it was authentic and had to
to a place called Akator with it.

255
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:39,708
Akator?

256
00:28:40,035 --> 00:28:41,008
-- Did he?
-- Yes.

257
00:28:41,008 --> 00:28:41,519
Are you sure?

258
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:42,128
That was what he said.

259
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:42,852
He said Akator.

260
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:43,585
What is it?

261
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:47,304
It is a mythical,
disappeared town in the Amazon.

262
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:50,551
The Spanish erobrere
called the Eldorado.

263
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,074
It is assumed Buga tribe were selected
by their god to 7000 years ago --

264
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:58,282
-- To build a
giant city of solid gold.

265
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:05,637
With architecture and technology, which at first
would be seen again, 5000 years after.

266
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,167
Francisco de Arellano disappeared in
the jungle when he was looking for it in 1546.

267
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:14,468
I was about to die of blood poisoning,
when I was looking for it.

268
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,611
I do not believe it exists.

269
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,439
Why would Ox take the skull
to go?

270
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:26,216
According to legend, was a krystalkranie
stolen from Akator the 1500 figure.

271
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:31,924
And it delivered the skull back,
could use its forces.

272
00:29:31,924 --> 00:29:33,568
Forces?
So it has a sort of forces?

273
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,264
What forces?

274
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:37,855
I do not know, kid.
It is just a vandrehistorie.

275
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:43,980
No, the letter she had received the Ox,
proved to be a card --

276
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,145
-- As she takes down
the office to find him --

277
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:46,930
-- But he has already been kidnapped.

278
00:29:46,944 --> 00:29:48,448
Now they also have her.

279
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:50,263
Ox said,
he had the skull a place --

280
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:53,372
-- And if not my mother finds it,
beats the both of them to death.

281
00:29:53,486 --> 00:29:54,996
She said that you would help me.

282
00:29:56,116 --> 00:29:58,384
Me?
What's your mother?

283
00:29:58,384 --> 00:29:58,964
Mary.

284
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,436
Mary Williams.
Can you remember her?

285
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,676
I have met many Mary'er, kid.

286
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:03,168
Keep your foot!

287
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,288
It is my mother, you're talking about!

288
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:04,951
Okay?

289
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:05,757
It is my mother.

290
00:30:06,148 --> 00:30:09,119
You do not infuriate you up
all the time, to show that you're tough.

291
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,632
Sit down now.

292
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:14,952
It's fun, that it is you,
to find the skull.

293
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,802
As if you are gravrøver or such.

294
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:21,864
I am a professor of archaeology,
over 10 years.

295
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:23,719
So you are a teacher?

296
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:26,205
It will be a great help.

297
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:28,582
She called me two weeks
since, from South America --

298
00:30:28,582 --> 00:30:30,079
-- And said that she had fled,
but they were after her.

299
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:32,584
She said she just had
a letter from the Ox.

300
00:30:32,584 --> 00:30:34,128
She sent it to me,
so I could show it to you.

301
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:35,467
So dead link.

302
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,431
I opened it, but there
is no meaning in it.

303
00:30:37,431 --> 00:30:39,744
It is nonsense. It is not
even the English letters.

304
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:41,350
Can you see?

305
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:45,144
Can you see the two tough guys over there?

306
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:46,151
When the disc.

307
00:30:46,868 --> 00:30:48,847
I do not think they have come
to get off thirst.

308
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,148
Who are they?

309
00:30:51,527 --> 00:30:52,400
I do not know.

310
00:30:54,077 --> 00:30:56,022
Get involved
quietly, Dr. Jones.

311
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:57,587
It is the KGB.

312
00:30:57,587 --> 00:30:58,543
And the roof of the letter.

313
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,012
The letter?
What letter?

314
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,017
The letter,
Mr Williams has just given you.

315
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:02,524
Me?

316
00:31:02,923 --> 00:31:04,035
Ligner I am a postman?

317
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,488
I say this not again!
Get involved now ...

318
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,554
Or what?

319
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:07,740
Good attempt, kid.

320
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,741
But I think
you have taken a knife with that --

321
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:12,667
-- To a mid-air gun.

322
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:14,786
Outside, now.

323
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:20,537
-- Turn him there.
-- Who?

325
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:21,612
To my right, to create turmoil.

326
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:23,029
Can you just keep it here?

327
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,252
It is my girlfriend!

328
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,191
Go outside and fight.

329
00:31:31,344 --> 00:31:32,632
Nak the slikhår.

330
00:31:40,656 --> 00:31:42,825
Your mother fled not.
They let her go.

331
00:31:43,245 --> 00:31:44,842
So she could send a letter.

332
00:31:45,147 --> 00:31:46,028
You could give it to me.

333
00:31:46,028 --> 00:31:47,220
And I could translate it.

334
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,004
Come on.

335
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:50,563
Go on, grandfather.

336
00:32:15,889 --> 00:32:16,795
Skip.

337
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,359
Further, forward.

338
00:33:40,256 --> 00:33:41,007
Move!

339
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,081
This is crazy!

340
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:43,656
Some people are injured.

341
00:33:52,152 --> 00:33:54,096
Take care!

342
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,044
Run to the left!

343
00:34:19,742 --> 00:34:21,084
Come on, the place!

344
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,953
Spread you!

345
00:34:30,953 --> 00:34:31,665
We are running too strong.

346
00:34:31,665 --> 00:34:32,684
It is what it is.

347
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,373
Excuse me, Dr. Jones?

348
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:47,328
Yes?

349
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,957
I had just one question
to Hargroves cultural model.

350
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:55,471
Read "Vergordon Child",
the section on fusionisme.

351
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:56,472
He spent most
of his life in the open.

352
00:34:59,168 --> 00:35:00,976
If you want to be
a good archaeologist, --

353
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,832
-- You have to out from the library.

354
00:35:09,551 --> 00:35:10,097
Who is it?

355
00:35:10,098 --> 00:35:11,978
Francisco de Orellana.

356
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:13,413
A Spanish capture.

357
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:15,574
Can you remember him who disappeared,
when he was looking for the skull?

358
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:18,350
And just as I thought.

359
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:20,287
Koioma.

360
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,068
What is it?

361
00:35:22,975 --> 00:35:24,958
A uddødt Latin American languages.

362
00:35:25,368 --> 00:35:27,466
The early comlumbianere
spent is still the basic.

363
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,698
See, there is no sign,
Certainly, recalls Kioma.

364
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,526
Can you speak it?

365
00:35:33,835 --> 00:35:36,822
No one speaks it.
It has not been heard in 3000 years.

366
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,611
But perhaps I can read it if
I will review it at mayan first.

367
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:45,200
For an old man to be,
are you good in a fight.

368
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:46,056
Thank you.

369
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:48,674
How old are you?
80?

370
00:35:51,892 --> 00:35:52,989
It is a mystery.

371
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:57,627
Typically Ox, to write a mystery
on a uddødt language.

372
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:02,110
Follow in the ground the lines,
as only gods can read --

373
00:36:02,888 --> 00:36:05,676
-- As the leader of Orellanas cradle, --

374
00:36:05,717 --> 00:36:07,728
-- Vogtet of the living dead.

375
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:09,934
He talks about Nazcalinierne.

376
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:10,723
What is it?

377
00:36:13,035 --> 00:36:14,070
Hieroglyffer.

378
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,583
Huge, ancient drawings.

379
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:19,150
The sign in the desert in Peru.

380
00:36:19,326 --> 00:36:21,715
From the ground like that for nothing --

381
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:23,328
-- But from the sky ...

382
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:25,559
Only the gods can read them --

383
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:28,067
-- For it is only gods,
who live there.

384
00:36:29,627 --> 00:36:31,388
Oxley tells us --

385
00:36:32,075 --> 00:36:35,471
-- That the skull is in Nazca in Peru.

386
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:34,643
Finally.

387
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,554
They have seen him.

388
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:37,827
Ox went to town for a
few months ago.

389
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:40,328
He cried and screamed as a gal,
Police inserting him in an institution.

390
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:43,664
I have not read Spanish,
what they said?

391
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,734
Ketuwa, a local inkadialekt.

392
00:37:45,962 --> 00:37:46,799
How did you learn it?

393
00:37:47,296 --> 00:37:48,177
It is a long history.

394
00:37:48,426 --> 00:37:49,210
I have plenty of time.

395
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:52,218
I read with Pancho Villa, and a
few of his friends spoke.

396
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,538
It is a lie!

397
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:54,823
You asked himself.

398
00:37:54,943 --> 00:37:55,572
Pancho Villa?

399
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,487
Technically speaking, I was kidnapped.

400
00:37:57,711 --> 00:37:58,531
For Pancho Villa?

401
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,682
It was a fight against Victoriano Huerta.

402
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,832
-- How old were you?
-- About your age.

403
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:06,510
Parents were safe
crazy, right?

404
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:09,273
It went straight.
There was high on at home.

405
00:38:09,385 --> 00:38:11,597
My mother and I, have also
not too well with each other.

406
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:13,075
Treat her well, boy.
You have only one.

407
00:38:13,075 --> 00:38:14,738
Sometimes, not very long.

408
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:16,765
Not my fault,
I think she is an idiot, --

409
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,965
-- Just because I
dissed out of school.

410
00:38:19,202 --> 00:38:20,061
Are you drop out of school?

411
00:38:20,062 --> 00:38:21,315
Yes, then. Several of them.

412
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:25,246
Fine private schools,
debatklubber, skakklubber ...

413
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:27,388
I am skilled with a knife, and then
I think it is a waste of time.

414
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:31,455
-- Passede you never entered?
-- No, it was the wrong books.

416
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,820
Because I love to read.
I used to read all the time.

417
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:37,582
-- But now I can choose.
-- How are you money?

418
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,719
Reparerer motorcycles.

419
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:40,158
Can you do the rest of their lives?

420
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:43,331
Yes, perhaps.
Is there a problem with it?

421
00:38:44,048 --> 00:38:46,383
No.
Not if that is what you love.

422
00:38:46,384 --> 00:38:48,584
Do not leave anyone tell you otherwise.

423
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,037
It is here.

424
00:38:50,092 --> 00:38:51,245
Sister.

425
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:11,128
She says that Ox is here.

426
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,081
But she do not know where he is.

427
00:39:14,366 --> 00:39:16,565
Some men came and took him.

428
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:17,551
Men with pistols.

429
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:25,082
They thought he was upset.

430
00:39:25,082 --> 00:39:27,232
He subscribed to all
walls of his cell.

431
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:34,176
The mystery here in the Ox's letter,
it makes no sense.

432
00:39:34,898 --> 00:39:37,304
Follow the lines
as only gods can read --

433
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:39,644
-- As the leader of Orellanas cradle.

434
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,032
Vugge?
Birth?

435
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:45,541
Orellana was not born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

436
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,676
He was a Spanish capture,
who came here for gold.

437
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:48,350
What happened to him?

438
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:50,494
He disappeared
along with six others --

439
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,051
-- And the bodies were never found.

440
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:22,140
He must have lost the mind.

441
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:32,199
Ox, what happened?

442
00:40:39,196 --> 00:40:41,942
It is not a
Mitchell-Hedges skull.

443
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,251
Try to see it extended the skull.

444
00:40:45,522 --> 00:40:46,607
And the same word.

445
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,719
At different languages.
Again and again.

446
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,187
Returred, eltarred.

447
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,608
Returno?
Return!

448
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,541
Return where?

449
00:40:57,411 --> 00:40:58,667
Or return what?

450
00:40:59,295 --> 00:41:00,888
You think the skull?

451
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,689
It seems to have been
in the minds of him.

452
00:41:04,347 --> 00:41:05,995
How should he return it to?

453
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,903
Sweep here.

454
00:41:29,131 --> 00:41:31,355
Ox was not talking about Orellanas
place of birth.

455
00:41:31,831 --> 00:41:34,121
It also has a second
impact on the mayan.

456
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:36,516
Bogstavelig spoken,
it means "resting place".

457
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,524
As in the "final resting place."

458
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:41,370
Ox felt Orellanas grave.

459
00:41:41,598 --> 00:41:43,198
The drawing is scratched into the floor.

460
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:46,491
It is gravpladsen, where he is.

461
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,146
So it is clear that Orellana
disappeared and no one found his grave.

462
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,182
It seems that Oxley made.

463
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,264
Gravrøvere will be shot.

464
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:25,265
So it is good,
that we are not gravrøvere.

465
00:42:33,688 --> 00:42:34,720
What we look for?

466
00:42:34,982 --> 00:42:36,112
I do not know yet.

467
00:42:37,046 --> 00:42:39,465
Perhaps a gravkammer
by one of the graves.

468
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,962
I think just, I saw something.

469
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,012
You are nervous over nothing.

470
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:04,895
This way down.

471
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,187
This way up.

472
00:43:40,066 --> 00:43:41,058
It is giftpile!

473
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:43,902
Be there.

474
00:44:07,986 --> 00:44:10,626
Are you ... teacher?

475
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,674
Deltids.

476
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:23,238
Dead End.

477
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,358
Maybe.

478
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:35,430
What are you doing?
Put it away, and give me some light.

479
00:44:42,335 --> 00:44:43,379
Come with the above.

480
00:44:50,869 --> 00:44:51,959
It is just a gimmick.

481
00:45:49,315 --> 00:45:51,154
Dance in your spare time.

482
00:45:51,154 --> 00:45:52,918
One of skorpionerne stuck me!
Door I do?

483
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:53,844
How much?

484
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:54,986
Kæmpestor.

485
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:55,670
Well.

486
00:45:55,764 --> 00:45:56,436
Good?

487
00:45:57,899 --> 00:46:00,510
When it comes to skorpioner,
the bigger the better.

488
00:46:00,614 --> 00:46:03,999
If a small one bites you,
you should not keep it to yourself.

489
00:46:24,066 --> 00:46:24,822
Their kranier.

490
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:26,880
Try to see their kranier.

491
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,795
It's like cartoons
in Oxleys cell.

492
00:46:30,185 --> 00:46:31,306
This means that we are approaching.

493
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:32,534
It is good.

494
00:46:32,534 --> 00:46:33,403
Why, it appears as?

495
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:36,807
Nazca Indians tied their
children's heads with rope --

496
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:38,566
-- To extend
skull on the way.

497
00:46:38,614 --> 00:46:39,421
Why?

498
00:46:39,991 --> 00:46:40,947
To honor the gods.

499
00:46:41,278 --> 00:46:43,394
No.
God's head does not look like this.

500
00:46:44,265 --> 00:46:46,064
It depends on who your God is.

501
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:57,560
You hasten you good enough, what?

502
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:05,207
Professor, it is a
impasse. Try to see.

503
00:47:29,274 --> 00:47:30,775
Come on, klogesen.

504
00:47:31,025 --> 00:47:31,981
Take the backpack.

505
00:47:49,175 --> 00:47:50,575
This is unbelievable.

506
00:47:50,964 --> 00:47:51,938
Uvirkeligt.

507
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:55,638
Do not to touch anything.

508
00:47:59,515 --> 00:48:01,067
Footsteps ... Some have been here.

509
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:04,245
In recent ...

510
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:08,762
Two sets of tracks.

511
00:48:10,374 --> 00:48:12,258
The same size. Could it
have been the same person?

512
00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:15,326
Not bad, kid.

513
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:23,747
A.

514
00:48:24,967 --> 00:48:25,899
Two.

515
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:27,502
Three.

516
00:48:28,015 --> 00:48:28,634
Four.

517
00:48:28,658 --> 00:48:29,324
Five.

518
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:29,952
Six.

519
00:48:31,802 --> 00:48:32,713
Seven.

520
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:36,374
Orellana and his men, is perhaps
nevertheless reached out of the jungle.

521
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:40,777
Give me some light.

522
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:48,142
Do you have a knife?

523
00:49:11,483 --> 00:49:12,814
It appears he died yesterday.

524
00:49:13,191 --> 00:49:15,829
It is bandagerne.
They have retained him.

525
00:49:23,778 --> 00:49:24,982
What happened right?

526
00:49:24,982 --> 00:49:26,558
He has been wrapped in 500 years.

527
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:28,118
Air is not his best friend.

528
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:36,903
Thank you.

529
00:49:41,548 --> 00:49:43,743
I will of course not borrow yours all the time.

530
00:49:43,744 --> 00:49:44,531
Clear enough.

531
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:45,720
We had better put it back.

532
00:49:51,968 --> 00:49:53,159
Is it here already open?

533
00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:13,118
It is him.

534
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:16,159
It is Orellana.

535
00:50:21,402 --> 00:50:23,262
They called him "The Golden Man".

536
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:25,698
His hungren after gold,
was legendary.

537
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,747
It is strange ... --

538
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:33,042
-- ... Some have been here
and moved again.

539
00:50:33,594 --> 00:50:37,251
But they left all this ...
Gold.

540
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:39,466
And all artefakterne.

541
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:42,787
What they were looking for?

542
00:50:55,315 --> 00:50:56,545
Keep it here.

543
00:51:16,253 --> 00:51:18,890
Incredible.

544
00:51:26,975 --> 00:51:28,154
No marks tool.

545
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,359
A whole piece of quartz.

546
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:34,537
Skåret against the layers.

547
00:51:45,683 --> 00:51:47,346
Crystal is not magnetic.

548
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:48,840
It is gold does not.

549
00:51:53,044 --> 00:51:54,697
What's this?

550
00:51:55,885 --> 00:51:58,704
Perhaps you thought Nazca Indians,
that this was their god?

551
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,949
-- Do you think it is from ...
-- ... Akator.

552
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:10,644
Perhaps the Spaniards took the skull
together with all other prey, --

553
00:52:11,293 --> 00:52:13,967
-- As they were on the way to their
Ships on the banks.

554
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,108
Perhaps sought Indians
them, or ... --

555
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:23,788
-- ... They came in-war over
booty, and slaughtered each other.

556
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:27,204
Indians bundled them into,
and buried them.

557
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,206
A few hundred years later,
dolls Oxley up here --

558
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:32,555
-- And find it here skull.

559
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:33,556
Removing it.

560
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:36,450
Perhaps the Akator.

561
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:42,871
Return?

562
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:44,867
Return, as he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

563
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:49,275
He put it back,
where he had found it.

564
00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:50,937
Why?

565
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,365
Hey, Mac.

566
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,627
You are lucky,
that you are sitting here, Jonesy.

567
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:51,971
They will blow knoppen of you.

568
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:54,721
It is ... the third time today.

569
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:57,681
Release me free
and I give you a hug.

570
00:53:57,682 --> 00:53:58,700
You had a Luger.

571
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:01,720
Pegede on your head with it,
the first time we met.

572
00:54:02,337 --> 00:54:04,189
The situation was under control.

573
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,009
You are in debt to me.

574
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:06,336
What you owe them?

575
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:10,019
After that you betrayed
your country during the war --

576
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:11,920
-- How many names
gave you as the Red?

577
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:14,574
How many good men died,
because of you?

578
00:54:14,698 --> 00:54:17,049
At a time release the me
out of this chair, pal.

579
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:17,953
And when they do ... --

580
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:19,709
-- ... So I break his nose at you.

581
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:21,026
Pal?

582
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:22,987
Do you think
that this is about Flakes?

583
00:54:23,397 --> 00:54:26,185
About you? Do you think it here
acting on the lines on a map?

584
00:54:26,186 --> 00:54:27,327
It is about money, is it not?

585
00:54:27,603 --> 00:54:29,117
No, not money.

586
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,675
But a huge pile of money.

587
00:54:35,442 --> 00:54:37,567
Do not wonder,
what the Russians want to pay.

588
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:40,058
It is nothing compared to,
what is in Akator.

589
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:43,593
A whole city of gold.

590
00:54:44,018 --> 00:54:46,029
This is what erobrerne was after.

591
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:49,648
For heaven's sake, Jonesy.
We are rich.

592
00:54:49,649 --> 00:54:50,649
Rigere than Howard Joeth.

593
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:52,849
The whole shebang is blood money.

594
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:59,549
Imagine now on, buddy!
Do it right!

595
00:54:59,974 --> 00:55:05,049
As in Berlin, you know ...

596
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,944
I just go smutter
after a bottle of whisky.

597
00:55:09,857 --> 00:55:12,505
Where was it fortunate that we do not
had beaten you to death, Dr. Jones.

598
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,072
You survived, so you could
make us even a service.

599
00:55:16,096 --> 00:55:18,896
You know me.
I like to help where I can.

600
00:55:18,892 --> 00:55:20,596
"I have been messenger of death."

601
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:23,869
"He who destroys worlds"

602
00:55:24,356 --> 00:55:26,013
Genkender you the words?

603
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:28,876
It was your famous
Dr. Oppenheimers words.

604
00:55:28,886 --> 00:55:31,244
After he created the atomic bomb.

605
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:32,458
He quoted from the
Hinduistiske Bible.

606
00:55:32,468 --> 00:55:34,340
It was the beginning of the Cold War.

607
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,194
But now is the next
våbenfremskridt, our first.

608
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:40,459
And it is your turn
to fear us.

609
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:42,768
What do you mean by a new weapon?

610
00:55:42,818 --> 00:55:44,520
A telepathic weapons.

611
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,036
A new step in the psychological
warfare. It was Stalin's dream.

612
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:54,526
Now, I understand why Oxley
put the skull back in the grave.

613
00:55:54,973 --> 00:55:56,178
He found out,
that I was looking for it.

614
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:58,574
The skull is not
a standard icon.

615
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,274
You must also have discovered.

616
00:56:00,309 --> 00:56:03,204
It was not created
of the human.

617
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:04,264
Who has made it?

618
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:08,856
Quite frankly ...

619
00:56:10,793 --> 00:56:13,584
Kadaveret from New Mexico
was not the first we found.

620
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,060
We had already dissekeret Thursday
from similar facilities in the Soviet Union.

621
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,915
Small green men from Mars?

622
00:56:19,027 --> 00:56:21,092
Legenderne on Akator
is all true.

623
00:56:21,413 --> 00:56:23,521
Nation from the time could be impossible
had planned, let alone built it.

624
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,699
It was a city,
created by superior beings.

625
00:56:25,906 --> 00:56:28,921
With superior technology
and Paranormal abilities.

626
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,474
You take the gas on me!

627
00:56:31,417 --> 00:56:34,192
Perhaps you will think
on what you can see?

628
00:56:38,064 --> 00:56:39,498
The copy from New Mexico
gave us renewed hope.

629
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:45,123
Unlike the others,
had it here, a skeleton of crystal.

630
00:56:45,776 --> 00:56:47,656
Perhaps it was a distant relative --

631
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:49,496
-- Which was also sent to it
to find Akator.

632
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:53,406
Perhaps the leader we all
after the same.

633
00:56:54,868 --> 00:56:56,988
It is the only
possible explanation.

634
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,324
There is always another option.

635
00:56:59,756 --> 00:57:02,809
Kraniet were stolen
Akator from the 1500 figure.

636
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,446
-- Which brings it back ...
-- Will get control of its force.

637
00:57:07,456 --> 00:57:09,200
I have heard the bedtime story before.

638
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:11,453
It is a legend.

639
00:57:11,563 --> 00:57:13,014
What have you to believe that Akator
have existed?

640
00:57:13,297 --> 00:57:14,669
The question
you should ask your friend.

641
00:57:14,724 --> 00:57:15,509
Come with the professor!

642
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:17,605
We are convinced
that he has been there.

643
00:57:18,497 --> 00:57:19,548
Oxley.

644
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:36,264
Ox.
It is me, Indy.

645
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:37,824
Ox!

646
00:57:42,102 --> 00:57:44,458
"Through the eyes of the end
I saw in tears "

647
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,765
Ox. Now here.

648
00:57:47,195 --> 00:57:50,335
Your name is Harold Oxley.
You were born in Leeds, England.

649
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,967
You and I read together,
at the University of Chicago.

650
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:55,154
And you have never been
so interesting here.

651
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:56,736
My name is Indi ...

652
00:57:57,393 --> 00:57:59,713
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

653
00:58:01,749 --> 00:58:02,362
What have I done by him?

654
00:58:03,517 --> 00:58:04,772
We have not made him something.
It is the skull.

655
00:58:04,886 --> 00:58:07,689
He is ønskekvisten,
which will lead us to Akator.

656
00:58:07,910 --> 00:58:10,348
But we need a
to decipher him to us.

657
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:12,840
His mind is dramatically weakened --

658
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,089
-- Let us hope that your are stronger.

659
00:58:17,851 --> 00:58:21,803
Krystallet in the skull stimulates the
unused areas of the brain --

660
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,715
-- To open for a
telepathic contact.

661
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:27,292
Oxley lost minds, because he
gazed for a long time in kraniets eyes.

662
00:58:28,148 --> 00:58:30,051
We have a theory,
that you can get through to him --

663
00:58:30,152 --> 00:58:32,190
-- When you have done
the same as him.

664
00:58:32,284 --> 00:58:34,145
Why do you not just themselves?

665
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,168
Kraniet talk apparently not to all.

666
00:58:39,152 --> 00:58:41,559
You are probably not afraid, Dr. Jones?

667
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,461
You have spent your entire life
to look for answers.

668
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:46,985
Think of the truth,
can be found behind these eyes.

669
00:58:47,409 --> 00:58:49,789
Perhaps there are hundreds
of kranier in Akator.

670
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:50,528
Those who find them, --

671
00:58:50,548 --> 00:58:54,787
-- Will have control over the world
largest of nature ever.

672
00:58:56,751 --> 00:58:59,490
Control over the human mind.

673
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:02,470
Take care,
maybe you get what you want you.

674
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:04,302
That I usually make.

675
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:37,280
Imagine --

676
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:41,706
-- You could look over to the other
page and see the enemy's secrets.

677
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:44,610
We could place our thoughts
in your leaders' minds.

678
00:59:45,176 --> 00:59:47,513
Get your school teachers to teach
in the true version of the history of the world.

679
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:49,672
And your soldiers to attack,
In our orders.

680
00:59:50,294 --> 00:59:52,627
We would be everywhere.
Stronger than whisper.

681
00:59:52,898 --> 00:59:56,434
We would invade your dreams,
managing your thoughts, while I sleep.

682
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:01,311
We want to change you, Dr. Jones.

683
01:00:02,110 --> 01:00:04,143
You all together.
The inside.

684
01:00:04,964 --> 01:00:07,028
We will turn you to us.

685
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:08,754
And the best part is --

686
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:12,343
-- I will not even detect,
that we do it.

687
01:00:14,232 --> 01:00:15,426
Return.

688
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,770
Return.

689
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:25,031
It is enough.

690
01:00:27,174 --> 01:00:29,280
It is enough. If he dies,
we have no joy of him.

691
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:32,357
Cover it.

692
01:00:36,646 --> 01:00:38,282
Henry.

693
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,326
Are you okay, Jonesy?

694
01:00:46,703 --> 01:00:47,701
You have broken my nose!

695
01:00:47,703 --> 01:00:48,059
I had said.

696
01:00:48,059 --> 01:00:48,896
So it is enough!

697
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:52,098
You will speak with Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

698
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,997
<i> Njet </ i>

699
01:00:54,322 --> 01:00:56,056
Before him outside!

700
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:01,970
Is everything OK, kid?

701
01:01:02,323 --> 01:01:03,670
My motorcycle is
still at the cemetery.

702
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,589
-- Yes, but are you okay?
-- They left my motorcycle!

703
01:01:06,339 --> 01:01:07,977
Hold on!
Stop!

704
01:01:16,943 --> 01:01:17,608
So, I am ready.

705
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:20,012
You must not give the pigs!

706
01:01:20,578 --> 01:01:21,457
You heard what he said.

707
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,848
I have clearly chosen
the wrong lever.

708
01:01:25,688 --> 01:01:28,057
Maybe I can find
a more active one.

709
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,551
Come with gidslet!

710
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,954
Remove the hands from me,
your forbandede russersvin!

711
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:38,689
Indiana Jones.

712
01:01:42,526 --> 01:01:44,620
-- It was you long for.
-- Mom!

713
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:45,304
Taxes.

714
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:46,170
Mom!?

715
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:48,532
What are you doing here?

716
01:01:48,775 --> 01:01:49,971
Do not worry me.
Are you all right?

717
01:01:50,115 --> 01:01:51,928
Mom?

718
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:53,428
I said explicitly,
that you should not come!

719
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:56,332
What you never said.
Even in the phone.

720
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,264
Is Marion Ravenwood your mother?

721
01:01:58,294 --> 01:02:01,154
For heaven's sake, Indy.
So difficult it is not.

722
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:03,618
No, no ... I think
I thought not ...

723
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:05,607
The fact that I would have a normal life,
after you left me?

724
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:06,127
It was not what I meant.

725
01:02:06,304 --> 01:02:07,370
I had a really good life.

726
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:08,497
Well, it is good ...

727
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,178
A very good, very good life!

728
01:02:11,552 --> 01:02:12,533
I have also!

729
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:14,714
Leaves you still traces of crushed
menneskeskæbner in your wake, --

730
01:02:14,727 --> 01:02:15,854
-- Or are you retired now?

731
01:02:16,203 --> 01:02:17,394
Why?
Are you looking for a date?

732
01:02:17,802 --> 01:02:19,287
With whom-as-preferably, but not you!

733
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:22,369
Will you help us now, Dr. Jones?

734
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:24,522
You just have to say yes.

735
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,239
Typically you, to be kidnapped,
Marion.

736
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,053
And what about you?

737
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:32,333
Everything is by the old.

738
01:02:34,089 --> 01:02:36,014
Henry Jones, Jr.

739
01:02:37,842 --> 01:02:39,478
Henry Jones, Jr.

740
01:02:40,526 --> 01:02:42,002
It is right, Ox.
Listen here ...

741
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:44,021
"To pay their fair
hands on "--

742
01:02:44,023 --> 01:02:46,112
-- "Golden key
which opens evighedens palace "

743
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:47,272
Palace?

744
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,196
It is of Milton.
He has said before.

745
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:52,045
Ox, you will have to tell us,
how to get to Akator.

746
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:53,588
Otherwise, turn the Marion to death.

747
01:02:53,588 --> 01:02:55,547
"Through the eyes are crying
Finally I saw them "

748
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:58,214
"Here in the death drømmerige ..."

749
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:00,498
Harold, they will turn Abners
little girl to death.

750
01:03:00,647 --> 01:03:02,292
You will have to tell us,
how we arrive there.

751
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:03,387
We must use fully specified ...

752
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,799
Get a paper to me
and something to write with.

753
01:03:23,322 --> 01:03:27,122
Autoskrift.
I should have guessed it.

754
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:31,618
Henry Jones, Jr.

755
01:03:31,743 --> 01:03:33,778
Yes, Ox.
It is me.

756
01:03:34,546 --> 01:03:36,578
"Three times is the"

757
01:03:37,112 --> 01:03:38,657
"Way Down"

758
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:39,820
Three times.

759
01:03:40,419 --> 01:03:41,200
Piktogrammer?

760
01:03:43,256 --> 01:03:44,377
Ideogrammer.

761
01:03:53,065 --> 01:03:54,638
Well done, Ox.

762
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:09,575
Ox.
It is me, Ox.

763
01:04:10,306 --> 01:04:11,706
It is Mutt, Ox.

764
01:04:12,237 --> 01:04:13,170
Look at me.

765
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:14,134
Look at me.

766
01:04:14,161 --> 01:04:16,182
It's me!

767
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:17,914
It is me.

768
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,542
The wavy lines mean water.

769
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:25,072
The closed eyes means sleep.

770
01:04:25,586 --> 01:04:29,133
The sun in the lane over the sky is
time. Or duration.

771
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:30,956
The word "now" means up.

772
01:04:31,905 --> 01:04:36,155
Horizon and the snake
means together "an idea".

773
01:04:36,294 --> 01:04:39,546
Horizon has also meant "the world".
But not in the importance of the globe.

774
01:04:39,556 --> 01:04:40,884
This meant large or powerful.

775
01:04:43,832 --> 01:04:46,866
The water sleeps
until the big snake.

776
01:04:47,439 --> 01:04:49,532
It is not just cartoons.
The instructions.

777
01:04:49,542 --> 01:04:51,246
Provide me a map.

778
01:04:54,602 --> 01:04:57,092
The big snake applies
of course the Amazon River.

779
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:59,281
But sleep ...
What water is asleep?

780
01:05:03,526 --> 01:05:04,155
There, there.

781
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:06,494
"Sono." It is
the Portuguese word for sleep.

782
01:05:06,655 --> 01:05:08,438
Yes, well.

783
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:14,072
He would have us
to follow Sonofloden here --

784
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:17,599
-- Down to the point where the
meetings Amazon River in the southeast.

785
01:05:17,694 --> 01:05:19,221
I am not sure,
what we should then.

786
01:05:19,337 --> 01:05:21,649
A kingdom of tears,
dreams and eyes.

787
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,649
I simply do not
what he thinks.

788
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:27,969
Perhaps this is the way, but it is
a completely unexplored area.

789
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:33,641
Running!

790
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:41,160
What pokker do we, kid?

791
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,065
They would beat us to death.

792
01:05:42,094 --> 01:05:42,663
Maybe.

793
01:05:42,903 --> 01:05:44,230
Someone was forced to do something.

794
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,062
Anything other than this,
would have been preferable.

795
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,619
I have at least one level.

796
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:49,255
You are insufferable.
Harold, Hurry up!

797
01:05:57,425 --> 01:05:58,186
Mother!

798
01:05:58,186 --> 01:05:59,323
Be there!

799
01:05:59,942 --> 01:06:01,080
Stop.
Move you do not!

800
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:02,675
Movement will have you
to sink deeper.

801
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:04,029
I think I can ...
If I just ...

802
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,202
Stop it.
You withdraw against a vacuum.

803
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,700
As to try to lift a car.
Relationships you in peace.

804
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,593
Okay.
I am calm.

805
01:06:08,955 --> 01:06:09,334
What is it?
Kviksand?

806
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,251
No, it's a dry sandgrav.

807
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:16,115
Kviksand is a mixture of sand,
mud and water, depending on ...

808
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:18,423
For heaven's sake, Jones.
We are not in school now.

809
01:06:18,894 --> 01:06:21,614
Relax now. There is nothing to
worry about, unless there is ...

810
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:24,812
Luftlommer to collapse.

811
01:06:26,266 --> 01:06:27,868
I find something to
to pull you up with.

812
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:31,426
Ox, do something.
For heaven's sake.

813
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:32,979
Go out and find someone to help.

814
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:34,189
Help?

815
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:35,199
Yes, help!

816
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:36,170
Help!

817
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:38,955
Help.
Download now some help!

818
01:06:41,015 --> 01:06:43,358
I know that Mutt
can be a bit impetuous.

819
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:45,106
It is not
the worst he can be.

820
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:49,473
Keep your arms in the air. When the kid
come back interfere you get.

821
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:50,830
Indy, he ...

822
01:06:50,898 --> 01:06:54,391
He is a good boy, Marion.
You should not be so hard at him.

823
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:56,277
Not all are suitable for it.

824
01:06:56,282 --> 01:06:57,584
He says Henry.

825
01:06:57,618 --> 01:06:59,197
Henry.
Good name.

826
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,223
He is your son.

827
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:04,395
My son?

828
01:07:04,465 --> 01:07:06,231
Henry Jones, the third.

829
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:11,190
Why you let him skip school?

830
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:14,576
Dam, vulture!

831
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:17,364
-- Stick.
-- I have it.

832
01:07:18,226 --> 01:07:19,051
Come on, Mom.

833
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:21,963
Drag.

834
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:26,926
Take hold of it.

835
01:07:28,126 --> 01:07:28,967
Take the deal.

836
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:30,707
Take just hold of it, Indy.

837
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:32,282
It is a rottesnog.

838
01:07:32,475 --> 01:07:33,476
Rottesnoge is not so great.

839
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:35,634
Well, it is here. It is
not even toxic. Take fat!

840
01:07:35,714 --> 01:07:36,994
Find something else.

841
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:37,890
What, for example?

842
01:07:38,866 --> 01:07:40,027
A rope or similar.

843
01:07:40,027 --> 01:07:42,497
I can not just slip in Silvan
out here. Take the hold of the snake.

844
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:46,572
Maybe I can reach the bottom.

845
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,567
There is no bottom.
Take fat!

846
01:07:48,824 --> 01:07:50,287
Well, I think I can feel it.

847
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,849
Seize now get on the tube.

848
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:52,870
Team looked up to call it that!

849
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:54,450
It is a snake.
What should I call it?

850
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:56,629
-- A rope.
-- What?

851
01:07:56,863 --> 01:07:57,868
Say "grab the rope"!

852
01:07:58,537 --> 01:08:00,623
Take hold of the rope!

853
01:08:00,996 --> 01:08:03,559
Hold fast.
It is slimy.

854
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:13,796
Get the thing away from me.

855
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,219
Sønnike.

856
01:08:15,463 --> 01:08:17,030
He is afraid of snakes.

857
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:21,339
You are a brittle old man.

858
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:27,188
Why do you always
be so cumbersome, Jonesy?

859
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:32,692
Thanks, Ox. It was beautifully done.

860
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,491
Help.

861
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:08,955
No, he was British.

862
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:12,652
My father was jagerpilot. Krigshelt.
Not one or another school teacher.

863
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:13,956
No, taxes.

864
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,002
Colin was your surrogate father.

865
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,902
I met him,
when you were three months old.

866
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,531
He was a good man.

867
01:09:19,944 --> 01:09:22,712
Who, Colin?
Colin Williams?

868
01:09:23,623 --> 01:09:25,436
Giftede you with him?

869
01:09:25,757 --> 01:09:27,010
I introduced you to each other!

870
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:29,850
Since you left me a week --

871
01:09:29,852 --> 01:09:32,850
-- Before our wedding, you
hardly right to judge me!

872
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:35,223
We was both aware of
that it could not function.

873
01:09:35,583 --> 01:09:37,834
It could you not know. Why
you do not talked with me about it?

874
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:39,575
Because it was impossible
To win a discussion with you

875
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,465
It is not my fault,
that you can not keep up.

876
01:09:41,596 --> 01:09:42,683
I did not want to hurt you!

877
01:09:42,871 --> 01:09:44,971
Hold now, for heaven's sake, shut up!

878
01:09:45,293 --> 01:09:49,180
Undrede you never over at the time,
why Ox stopped to talk to you?

879
01:09:49,381 --> 01:09:50,926
He hated you because you're stuck with.

880
01:09:50,936 --> 01:09:52,060
Stop now, in two!

881
01:09:52,475 --> 01:09:55,623
Yes, Marion. We must not allow
the child see that the mother and father quarrel.

882
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:56,869
You are not my father.

883
01:09:57,065 --> 01:09:59,313
You can just swear, I am.
And you know what?

884
01:09:59,591 --> 01:10:01,159
To make the school finished!

885
01:10:01,303 --> 01:10:04,196
What became of "there is no
something wrong with you, kid "--

886
01:10:04,196 --> 01:10:06,538
-- "And do not say anything else?"!
Can not remember what you said?

887
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,049
That was before I was your father!

888
01:10:08,388 --> 01:10:09,309
You are not my father!

889
01:10:09,536 --> 01:10:11,303
-- Yes, he is!
-- You should have told me that!

890
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:12,374
I was right to know.

891
01:10:12,651 --> 01:10:14,150
You disappeared!

892
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:15,087
I wrote.

893
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:16,839
Yes, a year later.

894
01:10:17,086 --> 01:10:18,856
At the time
Mutt was already born --

895
01:10:19,117 --> 01:10:20,526
-- And I was married!

896
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,198
So why tell it now?

897
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:24,321
Because I thought we were going to die!

898
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:25,673
Not yet!

899
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:40,726
Got it?

900
01:10:45,332 --> 01:10:46,591
Shit!

901
01:10:57,804 --> 01:11:00,719
I was certainly not the only,
who lived on.

902
01:11:01,046 --> 01:11:03,651
You must have had plenty
of women, through the years.

903
01:11:04,155 --> 01:11:05,461
It has been a few.

904
01:11:05,781 --> 01:11:07,820
But they had all
the same problem ...

905
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:09,179
And what was it?

906
01:11:11,407 --> 01:11:13,168
They were not you, sweetheart.

907
01:11:33,945 --> 01:11:36,419
We must have Oxley
and the skull back --

908
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:39,546
-- And reach Akator before the Russians.
Take the wheel.

909
01:11:50,623 --> 01:11:52,195
What he has now
going to do?

910
01:11:52,666 --> 01:11:54,827
I do not think
he is thinking that far!

911
01:11:56,407 --> 01:11:59,235
-- Nudge you right, sønnike.
-- Stop calling me sønnike!

912
01:11:59,517 --> 01:12:01,483
I would keep me in the ears,
if I were you.

913
01:12:11,366 --> 01:12:12,591
Duk you!

914
01:12:16,853 --> 01:12:18,084
Move!

915
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:22,351
Run up on the page
of the amfibievogn.

916
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:34,300
Henry Jones, Jr.

917
01:12:46,379 --> 01:12:48,307
Jones!

918
01:13:02,406 --> 01:13:04,195
Bound!

919
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:20,087
Duk you!

920
01:13:31,339 --> 01:13:32,650
Ox has the skull.

921
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:34,225
Marion, take the wheel.

922
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:35,371
It is cheating, she also got
allowed to run the truck.

923
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:37,990
Take a tudekiks and
find something to fight with.

924
01:13:47,947 --> 01:13:49,326
Jonesy!

925
01:14:02,372 --> 01:14:04,936
-- Jonesy.
-- Hey, Mac.

926
01:14:37,665 --> 01:14:39,703
-- Indy!
-- Keep now shut up!

927
01:14:43,768 --> 01:14:45,638
I am the CIA.

928
01:14:46,059 --> 01:14:48,014
I cried the closest
to you in the tent.

929
01:14:48,077 --> 01:14:49,865
I said "as well as in Berlin."

930
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:51,990
And what we were Thursday in Berlin,
my friend?

931
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,651
Dobbeltagenter.

932
01:14:54,218 --> 01:14:55,499
Throw the skull over to me!

933
01:14:57,504 --> 01:14:58,854
Throw the skull above!

934
01:15:26,486 --> 01:15:27,803
The weight on the front foot!

935
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:28,858
Riposte!

936
01:15:29,169 --> 01:15:30,311
It is not a skolekamp, mother!

937
01:15:55,306 --> 01:15:57,016
You are fighting,
as a young man loves ... --

938
01:15:57,018 --> 01:15:58,826
-- Eager to get started
and quickly finished!

939
01:16:00,059 --> 01:16:01,716
Mutt, drag you back.

940
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,082
Hey ... I have the skull!

941
01:16:44,463 --> 01:16:46,260
Handgun!

942
01:17:31,875 --> 01:17:33,320
What glor you, dad?

943
01:17:34,014 --> 01:17:36,064
She slip away!

944
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:40,753
Hey, passport p. ..

945
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:18,059
Allow me to!

946
01:18:30,884 --> 01:18:32,635
It is rather dangerous here.

947
01:19:00,211 --> 01:19:02,246
In return, Dr. Jones.

948
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:30,570
Jones!

949
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:46,101
Stop!

950
01:20:15,866 --> 01:20:17,530
-- Siafu!
-- What?

951
01:20:17,767 --> 01:20:19,300
Kæmpestore dræbermyrer.
For the place!

952
01:20:26,242 --> 01:20:27,849
Kill them!

953
01:20:30,374 --> 01:20:31,966
-- Siafu!
-- What?

954
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:33,785
Kæmpestore dræbermyrer.
For the place!

955
01:20:40,809 --> 01:20:41,970
Kill them!

956
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:54,493
Running down to the river!

957
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:05,998
Go up in the car!
Hurry!

958
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:15,376
Dam, beware the abyss!

959
01:23:31,218 --> 01:23:32,810
Skip down on the car.

960
01:23:51,877 --> 01:23:54,904
-- Come on, Jonesy!
-- Spring!

961
01:24:10,568 --> 01:24:12,874
-- Mom!
-- Set slow down!

962
01:24:16,566 --> 01:24:18,332
Put down the road, tax.
You run out over the edge.

963
01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:19,467
It is also intended.

964
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:20,657
It is a really bad idea.
Allow me to.

965
01:24:20,763 --> 01:24:22,729
Trust me!

966
01:24:49,389 --> 01:24:51,797
It is, you should never do again!

967
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:53,167
Okay, sweetheart.

968
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,861
"Three times the fall."

969
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:12,469
Bak!
Put it in reverse!

970
01:25:34,485 --> 01:25:36,173
Way down.

971
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:41,482
He believes the country.
It was the path he took last.

972
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:44,461
Three times the fall?

973
01:25:44,834 --> 01:25:45,717
Three times the fall!

974
01:25:45,727 --> 01:25:47,603
-- What does he mean?
-- He believes ...

975
01:25:47,603 --> 01:25:48,360
A!

976
01:25:51,137 --> 01:25:52,020
Two!

977
01:26:10,575 --> 01:26:13,179
Three ...

978
01:26:44,026 --> 01:26:46,885
Are you all right?
Release, sweet!

979
01:26:47,538 --> 01:26:50,366
"Through the eyes are crying
Finally I saw them "

980
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,428
"Without taking the golden revelation."

981
01:26:59,565 --> 01:27:01,698
-- Gold.
-- Through the eyes and tears!

982
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:03,777
We have to go through the waterfall!

983
01:27:06,169 --> 01:27:09,904
I will return the skull.
In other need not take.

984
01:27:10,175 --> 01:27:11,832
Is it not the same thing?

985
01:27:11,924 --> 01:27:14,626
The skull has not given us
other than problems!

986
01:27:15,105 --> 01:27:16,586
See what it has done by him!

987
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:20,608
-- I have to return it.
-- Why you?

988
01:27:20,673 --> 01:27:23,290
Because, it said,
that I should.

989
01:27:35,045 --> 01:27:39,331
Okker, iron, turkiser.

990
01:27:39,762 --> 01:27:40,843
How old is this?

991
01:27:41,094 --> 01:27:44,042
4-5000 years old.
Like the pyramids.

992
01:27:45,126 --> 01:27:48,117
The tilbad sun.
Like the Egyptians.

993
01:27:50,527 --> 01:27:53,913
It is wet. It has
been used recently.

994
01:28:07,178 --> 01:28:08,912
Several worshippers.

995
01:28:09,057 --> 01:28:11,925
Yes, but it is not the sun,
they worship.

996
01:28:18,032 --> 01:28:20,393
Someone came --

997
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:24,530
-- And learned Yucaerne on agriculture --

998
01:28:28,829 --> 01:28:31,651
-- And irrigation.

999
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:43,420
Ox, what is there?

1000
01:28:59,449 --> 01:29:01,353
I think I understand it now, Ox.

1001
01:29:03,544 --> 01:29:06,079
There was no?

1002
01:29:27,897 --> 01:29:28,954
Are they the same?

1003
01:29:28,991 --> 01:29:32,202
There was more.
Look!

1004
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,725
A circle of 13.

1005
01:29:44,501 --> 01:29:46,101
Show us the way, Ox.

1006
01:30:32,313 --> 01:30:34,606
Come on!
Running!

1007
01:30:34,754 --> 01:30:36,180
Running!

1008
01:31:05,465 --> 01:31:06,636
Indy!

1009
01:31:07,137 --> 01:31:09,106
Jonesy!

1010
01:31:09,649 --> 01:31:11,607
Oxley!

1011
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:16,301
How did you pass them,
the last time you were here?

1012
01:31:26,953 --> 01:31:29,394
Come on, Mac!

1013
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:34,536
Come, Ox.

1014
01:31:34,774 --> 01:31:36,593
"The golden key
which opens evighedens palace "

1015
01:31:36,785 --> 01:31:38,240
Well done, Ox.

1016
01:32:00,628 --> 01:32:03,925
The city of gold.
Where are all the gold so?

1017
01:32:05,243 --> 01:32:06,713
See where this is past due.

1018
01:32:07,042 --> 01:32:09,468
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of time.

1019
01:32:09,819 --> 01:32:11,362
Ox has been here before.

1020
01:32:12,244 --> 01:32:14,203
But he could not
enter the temple.

1021
01:32:14,442 --> 01:32:16,005
So he brought the skull back --

1022
01:32:16,007 --> 01:32:18,705
-- To the cemetery,
where he had found it.

1023
01:32:18,948 --> 01:32:21,722
"To pay their fair
hands on the golden key "--

1024
01:32:22,035 --> 01:32:24,291
-- "Which opens evighedens palace"

1025
01:32:24,498 --> 01:32:27,998
He who opens the Palace ...

1026
01:32:28,033 --> 01:32:31,641
Obelisken.
Is Obelisk key?

1027
01:32:37,757 --> 01:32:39,372
Ox, looking for you?

1028
01:32:41,871 --> 01:32:43,494
What are you doing?

1029
01:32:48,183 --> 01:32:51,720
You figured it out while you were sitting
in the cell. Not true, Professor?

1030
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,694
Let me get to, Professor.

1031
01:33:09,723 --> 01:33:10,505
Well done.

1032
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,146
Get one for yourself!

1033
01:34:10,223 --> 01:34:12,597
Listen!

1034
01:34:13,218 --> 01:34:14,306
Can you hear it?

1035
01:34:17,781 --> 01:34:18,441
Up to you!

1036
01:34:18,568 --> 01:34:20,033
Running.
Ox, run!

1037
01:34:23,934 --> 01:34:26,230
Faster!

1038
01:34:26,263 --> 01:34:29,273
-- Faster!
-- Faster!

1039
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:30,713
It does not look good.

1040
01:34:30,808 --> 01:34:32,497
Running, Ox. Running!

1041
01:34:32,872 --> 01:34:35,375
Fast!

1042
01:34:37,106 --> 01:34:37,779
I do not like it here.

1043
01:34:38,453 --> 01:34:39,846
I do not like it!

1044
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:41,243
Jonesy!

1045
01:34:57,823 --> 01:35:00,307
He has lost it.
He has lost the skull!

1046
01:35:00,777 --> 01:35:01,354
Marion.

1047
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:13,290
Keep it here!

1048
01:35:15,518 --> 01:35:17,051
Is everything in order, Ox?

1049
01:35:20,887 --> 01:35:22,625
Beautiful.

1050
01:35:23,293 --> 01:35:25,766
Okay, let's get going.

1051
01:35:31,907 --> 01:35:33,281
This road?

1052
01:36:37,673 --> 01:36:39,683
See now,
begins to resemble something.

1053
01:36:45,631 --> 01:36:48,450
There are treasures here, of all
ancient eras here.

1054
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,072
Macedonian.

1055
01:36:51,337 --> 01:36:52,103
Sumerian.

1056
01:36:52,299 --> 01:36:53,577
This place
is the ultimate collection.

1057
01:36:53,935 --> 01:36:55,135
Etruskisk.

1058
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,101
Babylonisk.

1059
01:36:56,152 --> 01:36:59,812
There is not a museum, which is not
would sell their soul, for it here.

1060
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:00,959
The early Egypt.

1061
01:37:01,248 --> 01:37:02,210
Many museums!

1062
01:37:02,499 --> 01:37:04,125
Hundreds, Jonesy!

1063
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:05,861
Collectors.

1064
01:37:08,413 --> 01:37:10,282
They were archaeologists.

1065
01:37:46,858 --> 01:37:48,165
How open Monday it?

1066
01:37:53,882 --> 01:37:55,696
I come back with the Ox.

1067
01:37:55,999 --> 01:37:57,399
I promise you that.

1068
01:39:12,881 --> 01:39:15,303
"No more waiting in eternity."

1069
01:39:16,922 --> 01:39:18,368
Now is the time.

1070
01:39:27,699 --> 01:39:29,090
I regret Jonesy.

1071
01:39:29,239 --> 01:39:29,720
What are you then?

1072
01:39:30,394 --> 01:39:31,605
A trippel-agent?

1073
01:39:31,837 --> 01:39:35,947
No, I lied just to
I was a double.

1074
01:39:40,304 --> 01:39:41,363
See them.

1075
01:39:43,961 --> 01:39:48,002
They are still waiting
in the which disappeared.

1076
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:55,487
They have a cube-awareness.

1077
01:39:56,278 --> 01:40:01,025
They are physically separated,
but have a common awareness.

1078
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:06,338
They are much stronger together,
than if they were separate.

1079
01:40:14,656 --> 01:40:16,965
Imagine,
what they can tell us.

1080
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:18,216
I can not
imagine it.

1081
01:40:18,794 --> 01:40:20,336
It could based
Temple does not.

1082
01:40:20,346 --> 01:40:21,241
And you can not!

1083
01:40:21,392 --> 01:40:25,209
Faith is something you do
have not learned to have.

1084
01:40:26,299 --> 01:40:27,449
I pity you.

1085
01:40:27,742 --> 01:40:29,085
I feel pity sister.

1086
01:40:29,956 --> 01:40:30,918
That is why I stand here.

1087
01:41:04,596 --> 01:41:06,135
He talks mayan.

1088
01:41:06,328 --> 01:41:07,098
What does he say?

1089
01:41:08,060 --> 01:41:10,425
He says he is grateful
and that he will ...

1090
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,703
"The" want to give us a gift.

1091
01:41:23,456 --> 01:41:24,803
A great gift.

1092
01:41:26,342 --> 01:41:28,477
Tell me everything you know.

1093
01:41:32,308 --> 01:41:33,655
I want to know everything!

1094
01:41:43,277 --> 01:41:45,012
I have a feeling,
that we're all wrong.

1095
01:41:49,821 --> 01:41:50,879
Indy.

1096
01:41:51,841 --> 01:41:52,707
The eyes.

1097
01:42:55,349 --> 01:42:56,599
Is the rumvæsener?

1098
01:42:57,369 --> 01:43:00,169
Interdimensionelle creatures, in fact.

1099
01:43:00,833 --> 01:43:02,128
Welcome back, Ox.

1100
01:43:13,535 --> 01:43:14,497
What the hell is this?

1101
01:43:15,267 --> 01:43:15,940
A portal.

1102
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:17,865
An access to another dimension.

1103
01:43:19,308 --> 01:43:20,973
I do not think
we must take to the road.

1104
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:37,687
I want to know everything.

1105
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,092
I should know.

1106
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,524
Tell me everything.

1107
01:43:43,524 --> 01:43:45,189
I'm ready. Tell me.

1108
01:43:51,543 --> 01:43:51,928
Mac.

1109
01:43:52,890 --> 01:43:53,275
Mac.

1110
01:43:53,756 --> 01:43:54,429
Come on.

1111
01:43:56,546 --> 01:43:56,835
Mac!

1112
01:43:59,818 --> 01:44:01,920
Come on, for pokker!

1113
01:44:14,059 --> 01:44:15,117
Now, I understand.

1114
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:18,622
I understand.

1115
01:44:21,125 --> 01:44:22,992
Seize address.

1116
01:44:27,049 --> 01:44:28,781
Use the legs, Mac.
I can not pull you up.

1117
01:44:31,956 --> 01:44:32,916
Jonesy.

1118
01:44:34,170 --> 01:44:35,995
I will clear me.

1119
01:44:44,658 --> 01:44:45,795
No more.

1120
01:44:48,988 --> 01:44:51,269
Cover it.

1121
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:04,672
Running!

1122
01:45:05,538 --> 01:45:06,551
It is enough.

1123
01:45:07,270 --> 01:45:09,344
No more.

1124
01:45:21,126 --> 01:45:21,704
Jump!

1125
01:47:37,763 --> 01:47:40,557
As the viskede their
footsteps away with a broom.

1126
01:47:42,382 --> 01:47:44,310
Where did they go?

1127
01:47:44,595 --> 01:47:46,061
Based in space?

1128
01:47:46,423 --> 01:47:51,797
Not into space.
In addition to the space between the rooms.

1129
01:47:59,894 --> 01:48:01,574
There is something I do not understand.

1130
01:48:03,166 --> 01:48:05,466
Why traded
the legend of a city of gold?

1131
01:48:06,053 --> 01:48:08,999
Gold meant tax
on Yucaernes language.

1132
01:48:09,709 --> 01:48:12,558
But the tax was not gold.
It was knowledge.

1133
01:48:13,654 --> 01:48:15,730
Their tax was knowledge.

1134
01:48:30,878 --> 01:48:32,497
Did I just thought you,
to be seated here?

1135
01:48:33,187 --> 01:48:35,497
Night falls early on
in the jungle, kid.

1136
01:48:36,074 --> 01:48:37,816
Believe me, you can not
climb down in the dark.

1137
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,639
Well, I can.
Who would?

1138
01:48:42,617 --> 01:48:44,900
Why are you
not hanging, Junior?

1139
01:48:47,428 --> 01:48:48,295
I do not know.

1140
01:48:49,161 --> 01:48:50,904
Why did you
it is not, dad?

1141
01:48:52,528 --> 01:48:53,786
Farmand ...

1142
01:48:57,243 --> 01:48:58,605
Dad?

1143
01:49:03,113 --> 01:49:06,214
Your grandfather is sitting up there
and laughs a place.

1144
01:49:21,876 --> 01:49:23,127
Vidunderligt. Perfect.

1145
01:49:23,705 --> 01:49:24,667
Make the letters larger.

1146
01:49:24,955 --> 01:49:25,533
Much more.

1147
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:40,159
Henry Jones, Jr,
and Marion Ravenwood.

1148
01:49:41,313 --> 01:49:45,736
We are gathered here today because
The two want to live as husband and wife.

1149
01:49:46,221 --> 01:49:48,400
I have demonstrated your love
by your promises --

1150
01:49:48,402 --> 01:49:50,400
-- The combination of your hands --

1151
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:52,137
-- And by giving
each other these rings.

1152
01:49:52,668 --> 01:49:55,629
I declare I am now
for the right husband and wife to be.

1153
01:49:56,420 --> 01:50:00,881
Let no man destroy,
what God has brought together.

1154
01:50:00,943 --> 01:50:04,108
So much of a life,
wasted in waiting.

1155
01:50:04,888 --> 01:50:05,980
Congratulations.

1156
01:50:06,812 --> 01:50:07,871
You may kiss your bride.

1157
01:50:28,655 --> 01:50:29,714
Good done, Henry.

1158
01:50:30,772 --> 01:50:31,349
Thanks, Ox.
