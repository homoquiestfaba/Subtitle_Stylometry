1
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,510
Hey.

2
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,910
Hey, Jose.

3
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,877
The way you drive around
this taco wagon,

4
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,633
you'd think you'd want to be deported.

5
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,189
Okay, cułero.

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,395
Yeanh.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,119
Oh, here he comes now.

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,678
Fashionably late, Earl.

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,831
Helen, Helen, Helen.

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,149
You look sensational.

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,038
- Sensational.
- Aw. You look pretty good yourself.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,190
<i>Ws been a long time.</i>

13
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,556
I brought you a little something
from my latest cultivar.

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,150
Oh! You charming old devil.
This is lovely.

15
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,389
<i>Yes, II sign in right here.</i>

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,550
Hi.

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,310
- Okay.
- So talented.

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,754
Tim Kennedy.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,477
- My God.
- As I live and breathe.

20
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,949
I thought you were dead.

21
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,918
No such luck, I guess.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,232
Let me tell you something.

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,636
Did anyone ever tell you
you're a bit of an asshole, Earl?

24
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,559
- All the time. Even in Spanish.
- All the time. Yeah, okay.

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,717
Oh, ladies. You're on the wrong floor.

26
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,473
Third floor is the beauty pageant.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,637
Oh, Earl.

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,874
It's literally so easy.
My niece set this up for me.

29
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,237
You just click one button
and you can buy whatever you want.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,430
With one click from home,

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,193
you get a choice of everything
on our line.

32
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,390
All the information is sent

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,471
and the flowers arrive to you
just two days later.

34
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,997
The first person to sign up gets
a 20% discount off their first order.

35
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,151
Internet. Who needs it?

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,791
There you go.

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,590
- Hi, Earl. They're beautiful.
- All right.

38
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,479
Here, you get some.
And here, you take these.

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,675
Thanks, Earl.

40
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,558
Oh, you're most welcome.

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,229
Yes, ma'am.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,151
Here's some. And for you.
Yeah, you're most welcome.

43
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,392
- Earl!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,792
You'd think I'm giving away
free Viagra or something in here.

45
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,234
I don't know what's going on here?

46
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,993
- Thanks, Earl.
- I'll take one, Earl!

47
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,115
I'll take one, too.

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,158
I just... A wonderful thing
you're doing here today.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,437
Earl, is that Jimmy Stewart?

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,035
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,478
The NDL 2005 Gold Medal winner is...

52
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,192
Earl Stone, with his Sunnyside Meadows'
Illinois Majestic daylily.

53
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,270
Earl!

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,719
- Congratulations again, Earl.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,636
No booing, no booing.
Thank you very much.

56
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,599
And rather than give
a long, boring speech,

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,274
I just wanted to tell you a little joke.
And that's...

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,836
Why did the horticulturist
walk across the hotel lobby?

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,755
Why?

60
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,037
'Cause he wanted to get to the bar,
and that's exactly where I'm headed.

61
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,389
Thank you!

62
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,720
Where is he?
He'll be here, right?

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,279
Don't hold your breath, honey.

64
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,716
Grandpa Earl will be here. He promised.

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,518
Oh, my poor girls.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,229
There's no sign of him.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,910
Well, he'll be here.
It's my wedding day.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,111
I love you, Iris, I do.

69
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,318
But you have to face facts.

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,680
Your father has always
chose work over family.

71
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,353
He missed your baptism,

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,954
your confirmation, your graduation.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,594
Countless birthdays.

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,149
Not to mention
most of our anniversaries.

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,074
I think I'm gonna be sick.

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,719
Who's gonna give Mommy away?

77
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,155
Oh, well...

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,558
- Oh, honey, my sweet Ginny.
- Iris.

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,473
Hon. Can we have
another little reload here?

80
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,912
- Another Crown Royal, Earl?
- Yeah. In fact, get the whole bar one.

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,756
Them, too? The wedding party?

82
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,029
Them, too.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,839
All right.
A round for everybody on Earl!

84
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,399
I'll drink to that.

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,440
Okay.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,159
Here you go, amigos.

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,438
Sorry it couldn't be more.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,477
Damn Internet, it ruins everything.

89
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,114
So what are you gonna do?

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,193
I don't know. I've never been
a plan-B type of guy.

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,918
- Gracias, amigo.
- My pleasure.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,790
Thank you.

93
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,074
I'll find something.

94
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,150
Gracias.

95
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,031
Grandpa Earl! You're here!

96
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,191
Yeah. Hey, Ginny.

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,990
You look wonderful.

98
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,479
I knew you'd make it
to the pre-wedding brunch.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,954
Oh, I'm so excited.

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,995
Is everything okay?

101
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,752
Oh, yeah, don't worry about that.
That's just a minor setback.

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,077
- It'll be just fine.
- Okay. Well, come on in.

103
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,231
I don't care what they say.
You're always welcome. Come on.

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,714
All right, you first.

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,154
I just gotta grab
something inside,

106
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,714
then I'll introduce you to everybody.

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,910
Ooh.

108
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,995
Oh, my God.

109
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,072
You saved all my cards.

110
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,675
Ever since
the first one you sent me,

111
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,909
when I was nine.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,434
It was the Corn Palace?

113
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,272
Um... Okay. I want you to meet Mike.

114
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,550
Okay? He's my fiancé. Don't forget.

115
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,554
Fiancé. All right.
Okay, fiancé.

116
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,436
- You need help with that?
- It's fine. Thank you.

117
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,914
- Mom.
- Jesus.

118
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,470
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I can't stay if he's here.

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,597
- I'll wait in the car, Mom.
- No. Honey.

120
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,475
Honey.

121
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,077
Oh, well, of course.

122
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,159
You're not here because of the wedding.
No, no.

123
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,880
You're here because
you had nowhere else to go.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,070
Again!

125
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,790
And you promised Ginny
you'd help pay for the wedding.

126
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,116
It's fine, Grandma.
We can just make it BYOB.

127
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,953
No, it's not fine. It's never been fine.

128
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,191
- Why don't you knock it off?
- Oh, man, he's in deep shit.

129
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,829
Just stop it.

130
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,709
Come back doing the same old shit
all the time.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,870
How dare you come in here

132
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,633
and make all this fuss right here
in front of her.

133
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,393
Because you weren't there
for your own daughter

134
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,750
and now you're letting down
your granddaughter?

135
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,195
- But it's no big surprise, you know why?
- Yeah, why?

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,556
You were never a real father
or a husband.

137
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,991
I was on the road 60 hours a week
to provide for this family.

138
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,998
What the hell are you talking about?

139
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,635
On the road providing? Ha!

140
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,955
You know what you do?

141
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,798
You play with your friends.

142
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,554
You sit around
and hand each other trophies

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,070
- for watching seeds sprout.
- Trophies?

144
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,913
- Mr. Daylily.
- You fucking...

145
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,433
Ginny, come here, please.

146
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,356
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

147
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,559
- That's okay, Grandma. Thank you.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

148
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,035
They did the alterations.
I'll see you next week, sweet girl.

149
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,519
Thank you, Grandma.

150
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,996
I'm sorry, darling. I'm sorry.

151
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,119
I'll be going.

152
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,517
Be right back.

153
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,679
Bitch. Bitch.

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,269
Hey, man.

155
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,437
Weddings make everyone crazy.

156
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,878
Always some kind of drama.

157
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,997
Yeah. You got that right.

158
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,432
Looks like you covered
some ground in your day.

159
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,755
Yeah.

160
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,036
Forty-one states out of 50.

161
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,957
Never had a ticket, nothing. Just drive.

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
I never had a problem.

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,314
This old truck is great.
Got a good record.

164
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,273
- No tickets, huh?
- Nah-uh.

165
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,395
Never had one.

166
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,278
Ever in my life, I've never had one.

167
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,196
My grandpa was a real road warrior, too.
He loved to drive.

168
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,516
Yeah. Well, let's hear it for gramps.

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,993
I'm Richard. Rico.

170
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,231
I'm a friend
of one of Ginny's bridesmaids.

171
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,197
Yeah, okay, Rico. My name's Earl.

172
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,399
Hey, Earl, you know,
if you're really stuck,

173
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,436
I know some people
who would pay you to just drive,

174
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,355
one city to another.

175
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,714
Pay me to just drive?

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,190
What do you get out of it, slick?

177
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,635
All I'm saying is, I have friends
looking for cautious drivers like you.

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,635
Yeah.

179
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,359
You could help your granddaughter.

180
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,595
All righty.

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,430
Huh.

182
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,109
Just drive.

183
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,110
Okay.

184
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,155
All right.

185
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,035
It says "tire shop," but which one?

186
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,718
Hola. I'm Earl.

187
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,473
Hola, hola, Earl.

188
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,151
Where do you want us
to cut the compartment, huh?

189
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,350
Under the seat?

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,510
The wheel well?

191
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,238
Do what to the compartment?

192
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,113
Cut up your truck.

193
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,794
What are you talking about?
Cutting up the...

194
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,237
Look, nobody's gonna
cut up this truck, understand?

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,598
Put whatever you want right back there,
next to the golf clubs. It'll be safe.

196
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,754
No problem.

197
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,834
You're fucking crazy, huh?

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,832
Yeah.

199
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,637
- Take it.
- What's this?

200
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,438
You answer this, day or night,

201
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,554
but you don't call anyone.

202
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,474
When you get to the drop,
someone will text you.

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,350
Text?

204
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,754
You know how to text?

205
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,670
Well...

206
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,194
Hold on to the phone.

207
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,430
If it rings, you answer.

208
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,230
Here.

209
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,992
When you get to the hotel,
park your truck.

210
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,312
Put the keys in the glove compartment.

211
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,079
Then come back in an hour.

212
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,309
Your money will be
in the glove compartment with the keys.

213
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,949
Do you understand?

214
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,595
Si si.

215
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,395
I understand.

216
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,518
But what would happen if somebody
steals the money or my truck?

217
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,918
No one will fuck with it.

218
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,958
We got eyes everywhere, viejito.

219
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,474
Oye, viejito.

220
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,554
Do yourself a favor.

221
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,479
Don't look in that bag.

222
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,157
You might think you can identify us,

223
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,278
or know about this tire shop,

224
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,120
but don't forget,

225
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,639
we know who you are.

226
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,995
I'm not gonna look in anybody's bag.

227
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,919
Okay, papa.

228
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,789
Thank you.

229
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,994
Come on.

230
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,630
Welcome to the team, Agent Bates.

231
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,109
Thank you, sir.

232
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,954
Go ahead and have a seat.

233
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,034
So, how's your family adjusting
to the move? Do they like the city?

234
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,633
I'm assuming you don't want the truth.

235
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,638
No.

236
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,234
Listen, you made some big cases
in New York and D.C.

237
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,118
and I'm expecting you
to do the same thing here.

238
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,599
- Yes, Sir.
- Good.

239
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,274
No one wants to sit through
these long Chicago winters,

240
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,311
but we got crime coming out of our ass.

241
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,993
That's how you get out of here.

242
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,231
Work hard, make cases,

243
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,357
make busts, make your name.

244
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,438
Then maybe you can move on.

245
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,797
Well, that's the best news
I've heard all week.

246
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,509
Good.

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,513
Now get out there
and make a splash, Special Agent.

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,795
Yes, sir.

249
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,230
Agent Bates?

250
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,435
- Agent Trevino?
- Yes, Sir.

251
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,716
- Pleasure.
- So, I'll be your number one.

252
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,638
- Yeah, I heard. It's an honor.
- Yeah.

253
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,719
- How you feeling?
- 1 feel good.

254
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,996
Ready to make a big splash?

255
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,037
- He says that to everybody.
- Yeah, he does.

256
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,310
That's all right.

257
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,114
So your office is out here,
to the right.

258
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,517
Well, I'm not gonna spend
too much time there.

259
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,635
Hopefully not.

260
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,790
Jesus says that he came to seek

261
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,792
and save that which is lost.

262
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,431
♪ Spending time with you ♪

263
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,600
♪ I love you more today than yesterday ♪

264
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,155
♪ But not as much as tomorrow ♪

265
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,720
Jesus, it's like
the Star Wars cantina in there.

266
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,631
Yeah, it's where
all the homies hang out.

267
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,513
It doesn't look like a TED Talks.

268
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,110
It's my kid's. He helps me pack.

269
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,237
- You got kids?
- Yeah, five of 'em.

270
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,515
Five. How do you make
that work in a job like this?

271
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,233
We just make it work.

272
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,993
Ah, the plot thins.

273
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,113
- Why's that?
- This is our guy.

274
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,835
Yeah.

275
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,400
Right there.

276
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,675
Shit.

277
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,279
Oh, shit.

278
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,633
- Yeah?
- You did good.

279
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,749
Supposed to tell you to call this number
any time you need work, all right?

280
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,910
Here you go.

281
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,793
No, no, no, no.
This is just a one-time deal for me.

282
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,950
Pass.

283
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,316
Well, I tell you what, man, why don't
you call us if you change your mind?

284
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,595
You know what I'm saying?

285
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,159
Here you go. Take the number.

286
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,349
Here.

287
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,638
Why don't you save that for a rainy day?

288
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,109
Yeah. Yeah, a rainy day. Okay.

289
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,751
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's move it up out of here.

290
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,195
All right.

291
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,029
All right.

292
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,072
It's the starter,
the starter's pretty ratty.

293
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,314
- Let's go. Come on. Back it up.
- All right. I got it.

294
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,311
Everybody's on their cell phone.
It's becoming an epidemic.

295
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,596
What do you think you're doing?
Who the hell are you guys?

296
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,911
My name is Special Agent Colin Bates,
this is Agent Trevino.

297
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,150
We're with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

298
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,639
And you're Luis Rocha.

299
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,112
And we're here to save your life.

300
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,670
I beg your pardon?

301
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,796
We're gonna make sure your cartel
doesn't know you're working for the DEA.

302
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,192
I'm not working for the DEA.

303
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,476
No, but that's what they'll think
if you don't,

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,434
so welcome aboard.

305
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,632
Wait, I don't know
what you're talking about.

306
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,358
- 1 like the Tahitian Pearl.
- Mmm.

307
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,919
- It's got, like, a nice sheen.
- Mmm.

308
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,400
Think about it, Luis.

309
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,272
We got a warrant to search your house.

310
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,670
What?

311
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,194
Yeah, we'll see you there.

312
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,192
Hi. I'm gonna interrupt for a second.

313
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,714
- I'm sorry.
- He's yours.

314
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,150
Hi, everyone.

315
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,157
Before I get over-served...

316
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,033
...we'd just like to take a moment
to say thank you.

317
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,190
Um...

318
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,315
Mom,

319
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,590
I love you.

320
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,434
- Aw.
- 1 love you so much.

321
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,431
Grandma Mary, thank you so, so much
for everything that you've done.

322
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,319
Um... Oh.

323
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,077
And to my Grandpa Earl,

324
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,556
who brought the flowers, of course.

325
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,115
And covered the open bar.

326
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,429
So, thank you.

327
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,190
Hi.

328
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,110
Hey.

329
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,829
You look lovely tonight.

330
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,512
It's kinda funny,
our granddaughter getting married.

331
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,591
And we worried all those years
about her finding Mr. Right.

332
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,279
Earl, why do you think
you could just sit down

333
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,193
and expect me to forget about the past

334
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,479
and reminisce about old times?

335
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,634
Well, we had ten good years.

336
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,279
We can still be civil.

337
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,789
Care to dance?

338
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,918
You always liked this tune.

339
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,470
I do.

340
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,033
No, I can't. I just can't.

341
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,195
I can't.

342
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,750
I see you're still into your flowers.

343
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,435
Yeah.

344
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,313
I never understood how you could spend

345
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,478
so much time and money on them.

346
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,114
I love 'em.

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,434
I mean, they're unique.

348
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,596
They just bloom one day
and that's the end of it.

349
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,791
They deserve all the time and effort.

350
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,118
So did your family.

351
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,592
Not bad, viejito, not bad.

352
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,279
Damn!

353
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,393
Badass, right there.

354
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,433
New ride. Nice.

355
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,158
Yeah. Badass is right.

356
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,559
- Yeah.
- This is beautiful.

357
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah, the old one finally quit on me.

358
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,795
Hey, Earl.

359
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,072
- Got a little present for you.
- Oh.

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,434
Oh, what's in that?

361
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,796
Your jale, old man. Your cargo.

362
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,471
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

363
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,270
All right.

364
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,790
Hey, what's going on, big poppa?

365
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,713
Yeah, good. Just everything good.
I'm just on the road again.

366
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,677
- You're king pimping, huh?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

367
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,070
Kind of like that.

368
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,238
- Yeah?
- Same as before.

369
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,076
It rings, you answer. Day or night.

370
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,319
Yeah, well, you know, I've got
this other one from before, too.

371
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,999
- Oh, yeah. Let me see.
- Yeah.

372
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,917
- Yep.
- Ah, I see.

373
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,190
Hey, that was a perfectly good phone.

374
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,600
What's going on?

375
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,193
Earl, you throw your phone away
when your run is done.

376
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,710
I don't suppose you learned
how to text yet either, huh?

377
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,231
Uh, I can text. I'll be able to.

378
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,995
Next time you see me, I'll be texting.
Texting my brains out.

379
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,909
- Okay.
- Looking good, abuelito.

380
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,754
Okay.

381
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,599
- Hey, Earl.
- Yeah?

382
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,469
Same hotel as before.

383
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,836
Yeah, same hotel. I'll be there.

384
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,990
Okay.

385
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,314
Vamos.

386
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,120
1980 Shovelhead.

387
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,513
I ran one of those things
into the ground.

388
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,837
It'll probably be the relay, son.

389
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,434
Who you calling "son"?

390
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,430
Oh, you're gals, huh?

391
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,309
Gals? Come on, old-timer,
we're Dykes on Bikes.

392
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,630
No shit.

393
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,510
Okay, well.

394
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,870
So, you think that's the issue?
The relay?

395
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,430
It's a good early check.

396
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,394
It'll be the relay.

397
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,869
Thanks, Pops.

398
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,194
You're welcome, dykes.

399
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,269
- You crazy motherfucker.
- Crazy old man.

400
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,072
Think about our offer, amigo?

401
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,559
Uh, no. And I'm Filipino, not Mexican.

402
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,153
Oh. Well, that's a good thing.

403
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,311
It'll be harder for the cartel
to get to your family.

404
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,240
Why do you think
I'd work for you guys?

405
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,595
I mean, we found drugs,
$425,000 in cash

406
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,830
and three unlicensed firearms
in your house,

407
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,354
so I mean, that's a start.

408
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,000
Not to mention fraud,
tax evasion, money laundering,

409
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,639
state and federal drug laws
you've broken.

410
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,599
I mean, conservatively, I'd say you're
looking at back-to-back life sentences.

411
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,589
And I'm no psychic,

412
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,394
but looking at your manicured nails
and your exfoliated skin

413
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,470
and your scented candles,

414
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,039
I don't think
you're gonna fare too well in prison.

415
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,519
Oh, it's definitely bitch material.

416
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,989
You'd be somebody's girlfriend in a day.

417
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,673
You wouldn't like that,
would you?

418
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,197
And that's before
the cartel gets to you.

419
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,193
So, what do you think, Luis?
Are we gonna be friends?

420
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,229
What do I do?

421
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,678
Just do your job, go back to work,

422
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,115
be a good cartel employee
and answer my calls day and night.

423
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,553
- Okay.
- Good.

424
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,198
The foreclosure will be canceled with
your reinstatement payment.

425
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,078
Plus late fees and incidentals.

426
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,994
You said you had cash?

427
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,755
Yeah.

428
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,359
Right here.

429
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,630
Okay.

430
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,916
Piece of shit. Motherfucker.

431
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,878
The hell happened here? Fire?

432
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,233
Yeah, in the kitchen. Nobody got hurt.

433
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,594
Oh, good.

434
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,277
I'll have pancakes, then.

435
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,351
Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,512
Unfortunately, the insurance company's
jerking us around.

437
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,432
We might not see any money for years.

438
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,510
Yeah.

439
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,950
Well, I've been coming here since '568.
This place is like an institution.

440
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,350
I don't know what the hell
the vets are gonna do.

441
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,919
I don't know.

442
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,152
No Sunday night polka parties.

443
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,473
No more meat raffles.

444
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,520
What the hell, pretty soon
it'll be no more VFW.

445
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,760
Yeah, I guess so.
Well, that is unless, uh...

446
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,475
Not unless somebody's got
an extra 25K laying around.

447
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,750
Hmm.

448
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,436
- How do, how do, how do.
- Bienvenidos, senor Earl. Welcome back.

449
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,669
Oh, thank you, thank you.

450
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,795
What's up, big poppa?

451
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,075
Oh, not too much, not too much.

452
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,434
- Same old, same old.
- Mmm-hmm.

453
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,794
Just on the highway.

454
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,229
What's going on?

455
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,715
Look at this. Wow.

456
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,951
- What's in that? That's big.
- Don't worry about it.

457
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,833
- Hey, Earl?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

458
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,116
- It rings, you do what?
- I answer.

459
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,793
- That's my man. Big poppa.
- Okay.

460
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,029
I got you.

461
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,272
Remember, con cuidado
when you drive. Just drive safely.

462
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,555
- Okay.
- Si.

463
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,758
Drive safely. All right. Okay.

464
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,233
Hey, Earl. Keep your eyes open.

465
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,632
- All right. 1 will.
- All right,

466
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,716
- Okay. All right.
- Vamonos.

467
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,396
Holy shit. Holy shit.

468
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,080
Need help, sir?

469
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,596
Oh, uh... Officer, hi.

470
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,000
Need any help?

471
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,639
Uh, no, no. I'm fine, thank you.

472
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,915
What do you got there?

473
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,273
Pecans.
I'm delivering pecans to my niece.

474
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,038
- Pecans?
- Yeah, pecans.

475
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,396
She makes the worst pecan pie
you've ever tasted.

476
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,950
I feel sorry for her husband, but...
And I feel sorry for the pecans, too.

477
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,836
I don't know
what's wrong with him now,

478
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,275
but this dog has to pee
every 15 minutes.

479
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,589
Dogs.

480
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,757
Oh, shit.

481
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,276
It's all right. All right, calm down.
Come on.

482
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,830
Hi!

483
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,799
Hi. Hi, doggy! How you doing?

484
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,989
Take a sniff of that.

485
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,356
I'm sorry, sir, I'm gonna have to
ask you not to touch the animal.

486
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,475
Oh.

487
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,392
- I'm sorry, Officer.
- It's okay. It's okay, sir.

488
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,153
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

489
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,231
- My Dukie, I miss him so much.
- It's okay, sir.

490
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,393
Dukie, you know, Dukie's just
one of those dogs that everybody loves.

491
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,879
- Drive safely, sir.
- Okay.

492
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,234
- You can go now.
- Yeah, thank you.

493
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,517
You do a great Jimmy Stewart,
by the way.

494
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,799
Yeah. Fuck.

495
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,920
Let me explain something, Luis.

496
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,753
For you to get into witness protection,
you're gonna have to prove your value.

497
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,672
We win, you win.

498
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,433
So, we're gonna go on
a little sightseeing tour.

499
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,318
See what kind of value you can offer.

500
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,471
- You understand?
- Yeah.

501
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,717
Good. Got you a latte.

502
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,835
This is where it starts,

503
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,515
not just here,
but dozens of hotels across the city.

504
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,110
Mules come in
from various locations, loaded,

505
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,840
leave their vehicles,
someone takes the vehicles,

506
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,470
removes the load, and returns it
with the mule's payment.

507
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,673
At 121, there's a guy outside.
What's going on here?

508
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,994
121 is ours.

509
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,636
He's just there to make sure that

510
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,836
they keep an eye on the vans
that come in and out.

511
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,754
What else?

512
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,874
Fuck me.

513
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,519
Oh, shit.

514
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,470
Okay. All right, just settle down, boy.

515
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,834
Settle down.

529

How about putting your hands together,
make a little bit of noise

530
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,910
for Mollie-B and her polka band.

531
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,440
And a nice thank you for Earl Stone.

532
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,195
VFW Post 6330 owes this man
a debt of gratitude.

533
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,873
So, put your hands together
again for Earl.

534
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,155
What do you say?

535
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,158
Earl! Earl!

536
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,234
Now how about shelling out
another bundle

537
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,960
to fix the ice-skating rink
up at the old rec center?

538
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,995

Pull!

547
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,759
That old man's, uh,
gonna make a full run for us.

548
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,913
Hundred and ten kilos.

549
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,553
It's 2.7 million dollars.

550
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,956
He has no record.
He has no traffic tickets.

551
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,870
I need you to travel with him,
to monitor him,

552
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,598
because he can become our top mule.

553
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,353
Monitor him, you mean babysit, no?

554
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,709
Are you tired of being the top guy?

555
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,990
Because I can ask Gustavo here.
He's always eager to step up.

556
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,718
No, no, no. No. I got it.

557
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,280
Have fun with Tata, Julio.

558
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,996
It won't be too bad.
You can always take Sal. Pull!

559
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,595
Who are you?

560
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,637
The boss sent me. I'm your handler.

561
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,231
We're gonna be with you the whole trip.

562
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,231
Where are the boys?
Where are the fellas here...

563
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,312
Hey, hey, hey. Never mind the fellas.
Listen to me.

564
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,914
You've been entrusted
with a very valuable cargo

565
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,513
and I don't trust you.

566
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,069
You do as you're told.
Take the routes I say.

567
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,118
No unauthorized roads,
no unexpected stops.

568
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,874
My schedule, my timetable.
Is that clear?

569
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,558
You sure you're Mexican?

570
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,877
You're playing like you're the Fuhrer

571
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,871
- or something like that.
- Uh-huh.

572
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,678
Yes.
Show me your papers

573
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,194
- at the border.
- Yeah.

574
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,953
- Yes. You fucker.
- I'll show you my papers.

575
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,155
Here are my papers.

576
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,838
Don't underestimate how seriously
I take my work, Mr. Stone.

577
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:29,436
I've been in combat before.
I'm not intimidated by you, mocoso.

578
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,669
Sonny.

579
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,789
Hey, Tata, how's it going?

580
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,473
It's going good.

581
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,189
A little bit too long on the road
and everything.

582
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,839
But it's okay.

583
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,550
How's your nephew?

584
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,040
- He's doing a lot better.
- Oh, good.

585
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,349
Thanks for asking. Gracias.

586
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,353
- Yeah. All right.
- Hey, what's up, big poppa?

587
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,831
Okay. All right. Okay.

588
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,151
I was okay with the little letters
and stuff,

589
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,197
but you see,
when I come around to numbers...

590
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,953
Yeah, I can help you with that. Easy.

591
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,390
You press on this icon here.

592
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,629
- You see that?
- Yeah.

593
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,631
And it takes you back.
Pay attention now.

594
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,989
- Emillio.
- Julio...

595
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,398
- Is his package ready?
- Si.

596
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,790
- Then why are you standing around?
- He just pulled in.

597
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,871
I don't care. Load the truck now.

598
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,798
Hey, what's up, papito?
How's your old lady?

599
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,553
- 1 got your papito right here.
- Now! Let's go! Move!

600
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,156
<i>- Great, mein Kommandant. Very good.
- Shut up. Shut up!</i>

601
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,999
Mules don't talk.

602
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,556
Somebody ought to cool his ass down.

603
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,717
Okay, mira, papi. Pay attention.

604
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,199
- You click on the icon here, all right.
- Yeah.

605
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,191
- Numbers pop up. You see that?
- Yeah.

606
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,914
Then you just type "7-7-1.

607
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,151
"Joy Drive." Easy.

608
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,435
- Yeah.
- That's the drop site.

609
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,075
I think I got it.

610
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,554
- Icon pops up, numbers pop up.
- He says he's got it.

611
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,711
Let's go. We're running late.

612
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,871
Let's go. Let's go! Move.
Vamos.

613
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,639
Okay.

614
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,313
Come on. We don't have all day.

615
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,198
All right.

616
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,430

How you folks doing?

634
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,712
Not so good. We got a flat.

635
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,359
- A flat tire?
- Yeah.

636
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,151
And my husband isn't too handy,
so...

637
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,153
Didn't your daddy teach you
how to change a tire?

638
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,279
No. That's why I'm googling it.
I don't have any reception.

639
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,113
Yeah, well, that's the trouble
with this generation.

I'll give you a hand.

Oh, okay.

643
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,116
- You get the tire out, we'll fix it up.
- Yeah, come on.

644
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,550
Yeah.

645
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,430
- All right.
- Tire's in there. Great.

646
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,359
- Uh...
- Okay. Keep going.

647
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,351
- Okay.
- Okay.

648
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,313
- Ah, here we go.
- Okay.

649
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,392
- There it is. Yeah.
- Ah.

650
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,672
Well, this is good.
Helping you Negro folks out.

651
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,910
"Negro"? Sir, we don't say that anymore.

652
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,150
Yeah, we prefer "black."

653
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,953
- "Black" or "people."
- Or just "people."

654
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,190
- Yeah. I'm black, you're white.
- No shit.

655
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,829
Yeah, no shit.

656
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,833
Okay.
Let me give you a hand here.

657
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,319
- I'll take the jack.
- Okay.

658
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,232
- You get the tire.
- All right.

659
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,113
You are so sweet.

660
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,709
Hey.

661
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,995
My turn.

662
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,999
Oh, my God, look at this.

663
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,400
My God.

664
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,759
- Would you like...
- Oh, yes.

665
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,239
This is so nice.

666
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,632
Tata, where are you going?
The hotel is right up here!

667
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,120
Move!

668
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,873
Hey, move! Hey!

669
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,313
Move! Okay.

670
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,960
Where the hell is he?

671
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,719
- Where's he going?
- Over here.

672
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,433
Who the fuck are you, ruco? Eh?

673
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,990
I'm Earl.

674
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,839
- Earl?
- Yeah. Earl.

675
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,911
Earl who? I don't know any fucking Earl.

676
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,233
Earl, the driver.

677
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,429
Get your fucking ass inside, man.

678
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,597
What the fuck are you
doing here, old man?

679
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,951
I'm just bringing in
my load, that's all.

680
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,232
But you're not supposed to be here.

681
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,910
Look, the address says right here. Look.

682
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,749
It's 771 Joy Drive.

683
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,710
Okay. Just don't do it again.

684
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,951
Who the fuck are you, pendejo?

685
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,034
I'm his handler.

686
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,598
Then handle him.
He ain't supposed to be here.

687
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,193
I'll take care of it.

688
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,030
Eh?

689
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,719
Who sent you here?

690
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,154
Who gave you this address?

691
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,872
I don't know. He was a big guy.

692
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,554
Mexican-looking guy.
He had tattoos all over.

693
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,916
Very scary, at least to this gringo.

694
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,959
Okay, that could be anyone I know.
What's his name?

695
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,119
I don't know his name. What do I
look like, Alexander Graham Bell?

696
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,237
I don't even know anything about texting
and all this shit.

697
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,879
- I don't know whose name is who.
- Okay. Okay.

698
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,354
They all look the fucking same.

699
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,597
You're a real pain
in my ass, you know that?

700
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,438
Then go see a proctologist.
Don't bother me.

701
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:44,153
Stop. Where are you going?

702
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,592
My pecans are in there.

703
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,031
Fuck your pecans.
Let them do their job.

704
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,594
What's up?

705
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,351
Okay, slow down.
What did he do?

706
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,999
What did he do?

707
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,469
He stops wherever he wants. Eh?

708
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,953
He doesn't follow my instructions.
He doesn't do what I tell him to do.

709
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,792
Yesterday he stopped
to see an old friend.

710
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,234
I'm just gonna kill him.

711
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,277
- I won't tolerate...
- Slow down, slow down.

712
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,714
Listen to me. Listen to me.

713
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,838
He moves his own way.
He's been successful.

714
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,634
If he changes his route,
it's probably better for us

715
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,314
'cause then he's less predictable.
You understand me?

716
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,910
Yeah, but we don't oblige
the other drivers like this.

717
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,077
You need to oblige me.

718
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,589
Understood?

719
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,715
Yeah, understood.

720
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,593
Stay with him.,

721
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,591
Make him feel at home.

722
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,193
Other than that...

723
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,278
How you doing?

724
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,879
I'm fine.

725
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,033
Okay. Do your job.

726
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,599
Si. Si.

727
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,554
What do you got?

728
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,960
I'm taking all the risk here.

729
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,429
If they found out that I'm talking
to you guys, I'm dead.

730
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,158
Maybe don't work with drug dealers.

731
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,556
Got you a latte. Feel better?

732
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,679
So what do you got for us?

733
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,549
I don't know
if I should be doing this.

734
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,153
Oh, what do you got?

735
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,115
What's this?

736
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,797
It's a freight manifest.

737
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,358
What is this? Code?

738
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,033
Symbols for each of the mules,

739
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:42,397
along with symbols for their routes,
dates, and cargo loads.

740
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,951
There's this new drug mule, Tata.

741
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,112
New guy. He's delivered
121 kilos in April,

742
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,113
172 kilos in May,

743
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,077
and then 232 kilos.

744
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,639
Jesus Christ. Could that be right?

745
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,912
This guy's nickname's, uh, Tata?

746
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,832
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's Tata.

747
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,316
That's good. Good work.

748
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,357
I'm just gonna need to document this.

749
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,637
I gotta get that back
before they know it's gone, though.

750
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:06,950
So if I can just take it now.

751
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,917
It's just gonna take a second,
so just relax.

752
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,389
You play hard to get for a snitch.

753
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,551
And you end up snitching anyway.

754
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,670
I just need...

755
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,675
Just think about who else you
can snitch on while you're waiting.

756
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,598
- No. Come on. I'm just...
- Reflect on that.

757
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,150
I'm showing
my worth, though, right?

758
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,230
I mean, this is...

759
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,993
- You did great.
- 1 know enough for me to get in.

760
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,390
- Here we go. Good job, thank you.
- Get the fuck out of here.

761
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,914
Jesus Christ.

762
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,589

763
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,876

00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,434
He couldn't wait.

768
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,193
Doesn't know how to fucking drive.
Look at him.

769
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,038
Relax, okay?

770
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:23,915
We need to trust him.

771
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,070
What else are we gonna do?

772
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,355
We have no other choice.

773
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,038
Okay. Thank you.

774
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,834
There you go.

775
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,993
Everyone keeps looking at us.

776
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,236
Yeah, that's 'cause they see two beaners
in a bowl full of crackers.

777
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,989
Why are we here?

778
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,913
The best pulled pork sandwich
in the whole Midwest, that's why.

779
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,193
Not bad, huh?

780
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,000
See, what you gotta do
is take more time out, like this.

781
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,754
Enjoy life. Like I do.

782
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,433
Maybe.

783
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,560
Or maybe you enjoyed the moment
a little too much.

784
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,718
Had too much fun.

785
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,551
That's why you're working for us now.

786
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,678
Best pulled pork sandwich
in the whole wide world.

787
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,674
No more stopping, Tata.

788
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,440
You stay on route.

789
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,873
Losing my patience.

790
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,039
What's your business here?

791
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,750
Hmm?

792
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,556
I ain't gonna ask you again.

793
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,836
What's your business in my town?

794
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,231
Officer. Officer.

795
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,914
I can vouch for these fellas.
They're actually working for me.

796
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,474
You know this guy?

797
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,234
Oh, yeah.
I got 'em down at Home Depot.

798
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,152
They came out here,
and they've been helping me move.

799
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,390
Great job.

800
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,471
A lot cheaper than the moving company,
I'll tell you that.

801
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,994
Terrific job.

802
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,077
Yeah, could you come
over here for a second?

803
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,153
There's something very important
I want to show you in this truck.

804
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,469
Right here.

805
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,035
Really important. Really important.

806
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,794
You'll love this.

807
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,793
I went to a charity
and I got this caramelized corn.

808
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,439
And it is really terrific stuff.

809
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,954
We can't accept this kind of stuff.

810
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,599
Oh, you'll be doing me a great favor,
if you would.

811
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,876
I've got diabetes. I can't have it.

812
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,193
They'd love it down at the station.

813
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,272
And the gals upstairs,
they'll love it, too.

814
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,913
Thank you for helping me, sir.

815
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,718
All right, sir?

816
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,472
I'm very big on law enforcement.

817
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,517
Very supportive.

818
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,796
We appreciate what you do.

819
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,550
Yes. Yes.

820
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,630
Our numbers are down, Special Agent.

821
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,950
I realize we're down.
The numbers don't reflect the actuals

822
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,480
and will be adjusted by
the end of the day.

823
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,598
- Fix 'em and send 'em over...
- Yes, sir. Yes, Sir.

824
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,114
Today.

825
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,599
Yes, sir.

826
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,040
What?

827
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,430
Cartel's top mule's
on his way to a drop.

828
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,273
So we know the route.
We know it's a black pickup.

829
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,630
It's a needle in a haystack,
but at least it's a start.

830
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,149
How do we know this?

831
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,679
Phone tap.

832
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,229
They thought their mule was
in an accident.

833
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,630
Turns out it was a pickup
on Interstate 55.

834
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,510
When's he due to arrive?

835
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,830
9:00 p.m. That puts us five hours out.

836
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:30,234
So if we have local law enforcement
stop vehicles of that description,

837
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,954
do a random road check, we can catch
this guy without tipping off the cartel.

838
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,758
This is the guy you think is moving

839
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,798
- over 100 kilos into Chicago a month?
- Mmm-hmm.

840
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,553
One hundred kilos is overzealous,

841
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,313
considering we're only confiscating

842
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,834
five kilos a month.

843
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,116
Is that a yes or a no?

844
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,590
Yes.

845
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,118
But I want busts, Agent Bates.

846
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,635
♪ Oh, my name is Pancho Villa ♪

847
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,516

852
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,870
Congratulations, my friend.

853
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,280
About what?

854
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,112
You just broke the record.

855
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,395
- Really?
- Yeah.

856
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,676
Two hundred and 82 keys in one load.

857
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,478
Oh, my God.

858
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,551
Okay.

859
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,711
The main boss is
really happy about this.

860
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,393
- Yeah. Good.
- He wants to meet you.

861
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,353
- Does he? Does he? Okay.
- Yeah.

862
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,189
Beautiful.

863
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,270
Hola, papi.

864
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,271
Hi, gals. Wow.

865
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,794
- Laton.
- Oh.

866
01:00:58,880 --> 01:00:59,950
Ah.

867
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,593
Welcome to Mexico, Mr. Stone.

868
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,757
Hi, Mr. Laton. Yes, how are you?

869
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,752
Who do you have to Kill
to get a place like this?

870
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,830
Oh, many, many people.

871
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,319
I mean, it's really beautiful.

872
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,993
- Thank you.
- My, my.

873
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,471
What's your pleasure?
What would you like?

874
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,755
I'll have a double.

875
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,154
How was the flight? Good?

876
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,829
Uh, you know, it was really good.
Really good. A little bumpy.

877
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,399
Thank you. But not too bad.

878
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,756
<i>- Let me show you around.
- t was good.</i>

879
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,037
Don't hurt yourself.

880
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:34,070
Earl, I want to introduce
you to somebody.

881
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,629
Okay.

882
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,154
- Hi.
- Hello.

883
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,194
Thank you. Thank you, too.

884
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,591
I want you to take good care
of Earl tonight, okay?

885
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,479
Tuck him in and stay with him.
Make him feel good.

886
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,199
Of course.

887
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,718
Don't hurt yourself, Tata.

888
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,594
I won't.

889
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:18,230
Ah...

890
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,551
- Ah, this is...
- Lay down.

891
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,279
- Beautiful.
- Oh, yeah.

892
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,630
- Yeah.
- Do you like it?

893
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,552
Uh-huh.

894
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,197
I love it. Oh, God.

895
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:37,795
Sweetheart.

896
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,109
Wow, what do we have here?

897
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,992
Oh! You guys having some fun?

898
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,596
Well, we were just relaxing
a little bit. It was nothing.

899
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,913
I think we'd rather have fun.

900
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,038
I think that a little heart medicine
wouldn't hurt.

901
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,794
You're fine.

902
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,678
Here, let me grab these lights for you.

903
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,593
- One light will do.
- Yeah, get comfy.

904
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,239
I need to call a cardiologist.

905
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,794
Doctor Clark.

906
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,879
Hey! Mr. Life Of The Party.

907
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,320
- Yeah.
- You having fun?

908
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,152
- Yeah, I am.
- Yeah, you are.

909
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,231
- 1 saw you.
- 1 was having fun, all right.

910
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,640
I've been looking for you.

911
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,040
- For me?
- 1 was looking for you.

912
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,235
Oh, yeah?

913
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,231
Yeah, I thought I'd
give you a little advice.

914
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,913
You're... You're giving me advice?

915
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,399
Yeah. Yeah. I...

916
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:36,675
I pass.

917
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,034
I think you ought to quit.

918
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,000
Quit? Quit what?

919
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,275
Quit this.

920
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,475
Quit here.

921
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,597
These people don't
give a crap about you.

922
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,833
You know, you could quit,
find something you really love to do.

923
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,354
And then go after it.

924
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,716
Wait, what are you talking about?

925
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,830
Let me tell you something, okay?
This is my family. This is my home.

926
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,031
- Yeah.
- Okay? Laton...

927
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,112
He pulled me from the streets.
I was nobody. I was nothing.

928
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,513
Okay? He gave me everything.
And here, I'm somebody.

929
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,075
Yeah.

930
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,674
Yeah. So what are you talking about?

931
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,990
Well...

932
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,360
Hell, just an idea, you know?

933
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,238
Earl, Earl. Wait. No, no.
Where are you going?

934
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,880
Hey, I'm gonna go up to my room.

935
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,872
There I'm somebody.

936
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:25,993
No one wants to tip off the cartel,

937
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,071
but we have to show some kind
of progress with this case.

938
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:30,197
But you're talking about a PR stunt.

939
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,316
In Arlington, there's
a table of administrators

940
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,959
sitting around just like us,

941
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,269
only they're wondering
what the hell we're doing,

942
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,030
and if maybe someone else
wouldn't be more productive.

943
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,714
Hmm.

944
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,791
We need busts, Agent Bates.

945
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,231
Well, there's an alleged stash house

946
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,152
that might be getting a shipment
in the next couple of days.

947
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,435
That's more like it.

948
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,033
- Possible busts.
- Good.

949
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,077
Have to look like local PD, though.

950
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,593
To the cartel.

951
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,990
Our report will reflect
it's from our operation.

952
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,195
Do it. But I want busts.

953
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:14,950
You heard the man.

954
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,189
It's tricky.

955
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,434
Splish-splash.

956
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,520
Any last-minute orders?

957
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,150
Yeah. Nobody shoot me,
unless absolutely necessary.

958
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:28,279
Nah, it's your show, Captain.
We're just tourists here.

959
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:32,429
All right, gentlemen, you heard the man.
Business as usual. Weapons hot.

960
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,634
Police!

961
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,190
Get down!

962
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,599
- Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
- Get down!

963
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,197
Move! Stay down!

964
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,910
Get down! Get down!
Get on the ground!

965
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,149
Don't even think about it.

966
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,310
Don't move!

967
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,152
Five of these.

968
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,118
We got what they wanted, I suppose.

969
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,998
Yeah. Two nobody illegals and

970
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,514
a few bags of coke
to lay out for the press.

971
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,238
Guess now I can retire.

972
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,751
Glam Cosmetology welcomes
the friends and family of our graduates.

973
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,639
Thank you so much
for being here today

974
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,917
to honor these lovely young
men and women

975
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,037
who are following their dreams.

976
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,355
We are so proud of our graduates.

977
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,350
You're a glutton for punishment.

978
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,950
No.

979
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,995
I'll have you know I was invited.

980
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,839
To the next chapter of their lives.

981
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:49,434
Tonight, you are barbers,
hair designers...

982
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,512
What are you wearing?

983
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,631
It's just a gold bracelet.

984
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,150
You like it?

985
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,834
We all need to take a pause
and savor this day.

986
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,431
Reflect on the journey, the challenges,

987
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:04,272
and the obstacles...

988
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,271
What are you doing here?

989
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,920
Oh, I'm just trying to
make up for lost time.

990
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,916
And, uh, I do feel that
education is important.

991
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,794
Well, thank God she finally scrounged up
enough money to finish school.

992
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,839
Yeah. Thank God.

993
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,629
You? Impossible.

994
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,193
What's the matter? You okay?

995
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,669
It's nothing, it's nothing.
It comes and goes.

996
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,154
- It's nothing.
- All right.

997
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,516
No worries, no worries. I'm fine.

998
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,233
I'm fine.

999
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,515
- All right.
- I'm fine.

1000
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,674
Pull!

1001
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,355
Pull!

1002
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,749
Gustavo.

1003
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,234
Laton is gone.

1004
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,193
He was getting too lenient.

1005
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,439
The DEA is cracking down,

1006
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,315
and I'm not gonna rot in prison
because of his deficiencies.

1007
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,713
So, I got rid of him.

1008
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,473
It's my show now.

1009
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,310
Hmm.

1010
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,994
No more tardiness.

1011
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,509
No more going off radar.

1012
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,112
Everything goes according to plan.

1013
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,669
No deviations, no excuses.

1014
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,993
Everybody gets with the program,
or they go away.

1015
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,953
I don't care who it is.

1016
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,517
And yes, this goes for your gringo, too.

1017
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:48,839
You have a problem with that?

1018
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,630
No.

1019
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,594
Here's your burger.

1020
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1021
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,552
Change of plans, viejo.

1022
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,599
You follow us.

1023
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:12,279
Where are we going?

1024
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,593
Get out.

1025
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,791
It's so quiet out here.

1026
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,799
No one for miles.

1027
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,638
I want you to listen carefully, viejo.

1028
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,158
There's new rules.

1029
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,359
You show up on time. You leave on time.

1030
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,952
No unscheduled stops.
No fucking bullshit, man.

1031
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,519
All orders are to be followed
to the letter.

1032
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,153
We have a gift for you.

1033
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:50,475
Sal.

1034
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,190
Go. Open, viejo.

1035
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,679
It's a phone for you. This one you keep.

1036
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:03,399
You keep it on you at all times.

1037
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,556
That's someone who didn't follow orders.

1038
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,431
So you know the routes.

1039
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,717
We're not gonna babysit you,

1040
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,751
but we have eyes everywhere.

1041
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,877
We're only warning you once.

1042
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,951
No more late shit, Earl.

1043
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,989
New boss says you show up
late again and you're done.

1044
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,991
We own your ass, cabron,

1045
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,398
so don't be stupid

1046
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,993
or you disappear.

1047
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,750
Si.

1048
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,239
Answer that phone.

1049
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,038
You do as you're told.

1050
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,594
Don't be a problem. That's what happens
when you're a problem.

1051
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,512
You end up in the goddamn trunk.

1052
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,479
- Julio, mijo...
- No, no, don't "Julio" me.

1053
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,229
We're not friends.

1054
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,679
I'm not your mijo.

1055
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,237
- Orale, Earl. You're back.
- Yeah.

1056
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:56,430
What's up, big poppa?

1057
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,318
Yeah, it's me.

1058
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:01,429
And I gather you guys own my ass.

1059
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,551
Oh, come on, man. It's not that bad.

1060
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,518
Ready for another trip, una mas?

1061
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,350
Okay. All right.

1062
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,352
Come on, viejito. Let's make some money.

1063
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,555
All right.

1064
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,549
That's the spirit.

1065
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,994
Yeah, that's the Earl I know.

1066
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,798
Yeah!

1067
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,914
- What did he give us?
- Nothing.

1068
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,957
But from the wiretap,
we know where the mule's going.

1069
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,269
We know his exact route.

1070
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,795
So this time, we don't use
local PD or state troopers.

1071
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:26,871
It's Agent Trevino and myself
IN an undercover vehicle,

1072
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,111
Agent Brown in an unmarked making stops.

1073
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,833
- An aircraft.
- And?

1074
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,198
And that's it. We pull the plug
on the whole thing.

1075
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,073
All the surveillance,
all the wiretapping,

1076
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:38,873
man-hours, everything,
it all comes to a head.

1077
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,030
It's a lot of busts.

1078
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,192
- Go get her done.
- Okay.

1079
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,833
All right,
let's see what we got.

1080
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,794
They look funny.

1081
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,589
Nah, between the two of them,

1082
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,399
they got no more than
three grams of coke, guaranteed.

1083
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,239
Brown, you see this?

1084
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,836
Yeah, let's pull him over.

1085
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,317
I'm slowly exiting my vehicle.

1086
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:55,919
- How you doing?
- I'm not a threat, sir.

1087
01:17:57,720 --> 01:17:58,949
- Please don't shoot me.
- All right.

1088
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,155
Please don't shoot me.

1089
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,514
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm complying.

1090
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,750
Relax. Relax.
Put your hands on the hood.

1091
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,274
- My hands are on the vehicle.
- Great.

1092
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,669
You don't have any weapons on you,
do you, man?

1093
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,274
- No, sir, no weapons.
- All right.

1094
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,874
I'm very tense right now.

1095
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,798
Do you have any drugs in the car?

1096
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:13,199
No drugs. Not high,

1097
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,953
don't have any drugs,
never had any drugs.

1098
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,793
Okay. All right.

1099
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,673
You know, statistically speaking,

1100
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,910
this is the most dangerous
five minutes of my life.

1101
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:23,230
Being pulled over by law enforcement.

1102
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,111
It's okay.
Take it easy. Just breathe.

1103
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,670
You want me to breathe?
You want me to relax?

1104
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,389
The chances of me dying
during a routine traffic stop

1105
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,035
are greater than... I don't even know.

1106
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:38,556
It's the most dangerous
five minutes of my life, man,

1107
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,154
being pulled over by law enforcement.

1108
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,513
I don't speak Spanish.

1109
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,709
[... I'm no threat.

1110
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,200
That's you?

1111
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:49,992
- Car is clean.
- Okay.

1112
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,871
Sorry to inconvenience you.
Have a good day, sir.

1113
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,717
Thank you for your service, Officer.

1114
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,674
Thank you, gentlemen.

1115
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,879
Have a good day.

1116
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,276
♪ And on that road again ♪

1117
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,271
♪ On the road again ♪

1118
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,795
♪ That's me, I'm on that road again ♪

1119
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,317
How we looking up there, anything?

1120
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,154
No. I got no more, man.

1121
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,074
Yeah, he's not here.

1122
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,593
Hey, Luis.

1123
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,792
You don't have him, do you?

1124
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,155
No. Why?

1125
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:08,273
He'll be at the Honest Abe Motel
off Interstate 55.

1126
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,669
Well, that's rather specific.

1127
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,558
Tata had to get permission

1128
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,757
from his handler to stop for the night.

1129
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:15,953
Does that prove my worth?

1130
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,309
We'll see.

1131
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,920
Says he's got a location on him,
Honest Abe Motel.

1132
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,554
Let's check it out.

1133
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,880
It would work a lot better if you get
that damn phone out of your hand.

1134
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:43,271
Did I ask for your
fucking advice, grandpa?

1135
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,631
Past your fucking bedtime anyway.

1136
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,836
All right, scratch 109.
That's just a young couple

1137
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,513
- with kids and a toddler.
- All right.

1138
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,670
No.

1139
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,557
We got a possible in 203.
Solo male, mid-30s.

1140
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,193
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
What's that, right there?

1141
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,270
What's that, right there?

1142
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,993
You think that's our guy?

1143
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,319
Could be.

1144
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,634
How do you wanna play it?

1145
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,834
You wanna get local police here
on a noise call? Disorderly conduct?

1146
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,958
No, let's just have homeboy
run into the wrong guy.

1147
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:42,071
- Everything all right?
- Yeah,

1148
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:45,517
except I'm trying to avoid some
big asshole who's going around here

1149
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,071
banging his cell phone
on the ice machine down there.

1150
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,755
I don't know what it is
with you guys and your generation.

1151
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:52,910
"You guys"?

1152
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:57,154
Jesus. Don't you guys live life
for something outside the goddamn phone?

1153
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,349
The fuck are you doing?

1154
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,834
Fuck, I thought this was my room.

1155
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:24,518
Yeah? Well, it's not.
Wake the fuck up, asshole.

1156
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,159
Oh, fuck you, bro.

1157
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,475
What did you say to me?

1158
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:30,709
I said, "Fuck you."

1159
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:41,910
I don't know
if you've heard the news,

1160
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,593
but it's a felony to assault
a DEA Agent.

1161
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,592
- A what?
- DEA Agent.

1162
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,194
Fuck.

1163
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,834
Yeah, it's less than an ounce.

1164
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,233
Maybe 15 grams.

1165
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:55,634
See what's in his pickup.

1166
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,958
Ah, fuck. It's not him.

1167
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:08,156
Maybe there's another Honest Abe Motel
or maybe it's code?

1168
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,754
What do you wanna do with this guy?

1169
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:10,950
Uh, call local PD,

1170
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,678
give them the half-ounce of meth
and we keep going.

1171
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,556
Start back up at 6:00 a.m.
Get some rest.

1172
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,710
Come on.

1173
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,314
- Miss?
- Hi.

1174
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,919
Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee

1175
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,638
and maybe you'd fill
that thermos for me?

1176
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:32,949
- Sure thing.
- Thank you.

1177
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,599
Can I get the, uh, check,
when you get the chance?

1178
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:35,875
Absolutely.

1179
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,510
Morning.

1180
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,110
Morning.

1181
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,150
Oh, shit. It's the fifth.

1182
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,310
Hmm.

1183
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,269
Oh, shit.

1184
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:09,870
I know a lot about "oh, shits."

1185
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:14,958
Is that a missed birthday or what?

1186
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,189
Anniversary.

1187
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,756
Jesus, I'm an idiot.

1188
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,030
Yeah.

1189
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,198
Yeah, I am.

1190
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:25,875
Sure.

1191
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,720
Yeah, she doesn't say,
"Happy anniversary."

1192
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:33,477
Just let it sit out there,
waiting for me to remember.

1193
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,437
That was really something yesterday

1194
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,314
down at the motel.

1195
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,838
The way you took that guy down.

1196
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,759
That was something else, I tell you.

1197
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,309
Sorry if we caused you any disturbance.

1198
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,154
- No, no. It didn't disturb me. It was...
- That was unfortunate.

1199
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:53,550
Well...

1200
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,230
- You gotta think about the family.
- Ah, yeah.

1201
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,999
Each anniversary's important.

1202
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:01,791
But you've got to think
about it because

1203
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,712
women love that shit, you know?

1204
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,509
But you know, I'm the king of
missing anniversaries.

1205
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:11,954
- Oh, yeah?
- That's the problem. Yes.

1206
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,591
It's the first one I've missed, so...

1207
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,309
Good luck.

1208
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,994
Don't follow my footsteps
and do what I did.

1209
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,158
I put work in front of family.

1210
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,436
Family's the most important thing.

1211
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,314
Work's fine, if it's in second position.

1212
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,596
But first position should be family.

1213
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,273
I've learned that the hard way.

1214
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,551
My daughter won't even speak to me.

1215
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,836
Haven't talked to her
in 12 and a half years.

1216
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,675
Jesus.

1217
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,999
Twelve and a half years.

1218
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,319
It's like I never...

1219
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,630
Like they were never there,
or something.

1220
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:52,551
But, uh, anyway...

1221
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,393
- I'd better pay you.
- Oh, thank you.

1222
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,119
Here, you keep that.

1223
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,838
- Thank you.
- That's fine.

1224
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,112
Just what you needed,

1225
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,315
some asshole sitting here,

1226
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,437
telling you about what you should do
in your personal life.

1227
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,999
No, not at all.

1228
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,233
Anyway, I want to wish you good luck.

1229
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:09,989
You'll need it.

1230
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:12,239
And, uh, thank you for the advice.

1231
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,471
It's good to talk to one of you guys,
once in a while.

1232
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,631
- "You guys"?
- You know.

1233
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,518
- What kind of guys?
- You're just willing to...

1234
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:20,079
You know, you've lived so long,

1235
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,833
I think you've probably
lost your filter.

1236
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,798
Really. I never realized I ever had one.

1237
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,839
- All right. Take it easy.
- You, too.

1238
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,318
Excuse me, sir.

1239
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,315
Forgot this.

1240
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,790
Oh.

1241
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,029
Thank you very much.

1242
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,153
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

1243
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:26,514
Hello, Ginny.

1244
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,830
Grandpa Earl,

1245
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,879
it's Grandma Mary.

1246
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,393
She's sick. Like, sick sick.
We're at the hospital,

1247
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,273
but they're sending her home.

1248
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,313
Oh, well, that's good. That's good
that they're sending her home.

1249
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,837
No, it's bad.

1250
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,073
They did all these tests and scan shit,
but it doesn't matter.

1251
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,596
They said she should've...
She should've come in, like, a year ago.

1252
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,393
Grandpa Earl, are you there?

1253
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,880
Yeah.

1254
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,789
- You have to come, like, right now.
- Ginny, I can't.

1255
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:02,193
What? Why?

1256
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,715
They said it could be any day now.

1257
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:07,036
I've got this schedule.
It's really tight.

1258
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,874
I've just got so many things.
I can't do it.

1259
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,553
Yeah, right.

1260
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,309
I took shit for years

1261
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,835
sticking up for you. What an idiot!

1262
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,514
It turns out,
I was wrong the whole time.

1263
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,035
Ginny,

1264
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,793
I'm sorry. If I could drop everything

1265
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,839
and go do it, I would. But I'm sorry...

1266
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,669
- You came?
- Yeah.

1267
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,998
Where's your mom?

1268
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:08,714
She's in her bedroom.

1269
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,437
Okay. I'm gonna go in.

1270
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,640
Hello, Mary.

1271
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:29,840
Earl,

1272
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,353
what do you want?

1273
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,875
You're not in the will or anything.

1274
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,350
Oh.

1275
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,556
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1276
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,316
I didn't mean to say that.

1277
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,310
I'm just scared, is all.

1278
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,280
Yeah.

1279
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,916
Well, the only person
who wants to live to 100

1280
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,674
is a 99-year-old, anyway.

1281
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,512
I'm sorry, Mary.

1282
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,033
I'm... I'm sorry for everything.

1283
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,109
You lived to get back out there.

1284
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,915
All the conventions

1285
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:18,318
and the socializing
and being the center of attention.

1286
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,071
They got the fun,
wonderful man that you are.

1287
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:29,598
And we got the Earl who just couldn't
wait to get back out there.

1288
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:32,595
Yeah.

1289
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:34,875
Well, you're right.

1290
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:39,477
I thought it was more important
to be somebody out there

1291
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,472
than the damn failure I was here
at my own home.

1292
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,917
Anyway, for what it's worth,

1293
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,594
I'm here now.

1294
01:30:57,560 --> 01:30:59,312
I don't know why,

1295
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:02,638
but for some reason

1296
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,630
I'm so glad you're here.

1297
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,675
Yeah.

1298
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,034
Thank you.

1299
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,076
No answer, again.

1300
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:40,549
No good, Earl. No good.

1301
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,913
We're going to end that fucking Tata.

1302
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,430
Was supposed to be here a day ago.

1303
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,677
Maybe the kid lied.

1304
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,314
Maybe.

1305
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,230
Hang on,
there's a call coming from inside.

1306
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,277
They don't know where he is either.

1307
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,519
They sound pissed.

1308
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:15,952
Say when they find him,

1309
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,399
they're gonna Kill him.

1310
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,275
Mmm.

1311
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,792
- You all right?
- Mmm-hmm.

1312
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,916
Mmm. Good.

1313
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:47,356
Earl.

1314
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,512
Tell me something?

1315
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,199
Yeah, anything.

1316
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:56,839
How did you come into all that money?

1317
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,074
Well, I just...

1318
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,313
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

1319
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,437
I'm a high-end gigolo.

1320
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,990
- Bounty hunter?
- Come on.

1321
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,759
Seriously, come on.

1322
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,752
- All right, seriously.
- Mmm-hmm.

1323
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,958
I've become a drug mule for the cartel.

1324
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:26,353
I've got 305 kilos of cocaine sitting
right in the back of my truck out there.

1325
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,829
You're never gonna tell me.

1326
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,956
Well, whatever you did,

1327
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:45,474
you didn't have to get rich
for us to want you around.

1328
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,275
Yeah.

1329
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,630
I see you finally came out here.

1330
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,354
See, she didn't completely
throw you away.

1331
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,115
No.

1332
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,118
I failed you, Iris.

1333
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:29,433
I was a terrible father,
terrible husband.

1334
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,034
I just blew it, that's all.

1335
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:33,995
Blew my chance.

1336
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,873
I don't think so.

1337
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,717
I think you're just a late bloomer.

1338
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:46,678
Yeah.

1339
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:52,949
They're shitting bricks.

1340
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,117
They haven't heard
from him in over a week.

1341
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,430
And it's like 12 mil worth of coke,

1342
01:34:57,960 --> 01:35:00,600
so, I mean, they got people
swarming the highways.

1343
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,074
Good.

1344
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:08,998
We have new information on Tata.

1345
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,515
I have new information, from my boss.

1346
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,836
- It's time to wrap this up.
- Come on, we can get this guy.

1347
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,753
- Oh, it's been months, Colin.
- So what's a couple more days?

1348
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,479
Look, we don't even know
if the guy is still out there.

1349
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:22,110
You've been allotted as much time
and resources as we can give to anyone.

1350
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,478
You did good work.

1351
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,117
If you had a few more days,

1352
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,191
while we finalize the warrants,
what's your plan?

1353
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,039
Follow his followers.

1354
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,032
We tapped the phones
of a couple cartel guys

1355
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,155
that are also looking for him.

1356
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,753
Okay, do it.

1357
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,235
Thank you.

1358
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,077
What? You okay?

1359
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,513
It's all right.

1360
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,437
You were the love of my life

1361
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,758
and the pain of my life.

1362
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:48,556
I need you to know

1363
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:53,789
it's all the world to me

1364
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,398
that you're here.

1365
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,759
I love you, Mary.

1366
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,079
More today than yesterday?

1367
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:19,512
But not as much as tomorrow.

1368
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:23,750
Oh.

1369
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:25,590
Oh.

1370
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:45,118
I knew Mary well enough to know

1371
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:49,433
that there was no better friend,
no better mother, no better mentor.

1372
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,036
No better listener to those in need.

1373
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,910
The light that she carried through
in her soul and her spirit

1374
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:00,836
IS something that we should carry on
IN our own daily lives.

1375
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,231
The optimism, the hopefulness,

1376
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,073
even at the end of her days.

1377
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,555
"Everything works out better
than expected," she always used to say.

1378
01:38:10,640 --> 01:38:12,039
We will miss her,

1379
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,953
but she would not want us
to mourn today.

1380
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,199
- Thank you, sir.
- Very sorry.

1381
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,270
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, Sir.

1382
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,114
- Thank you.
- Very, very sorry.

1383
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,190
Yeah.

1384
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,594
Hey, Dad.

1385
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,397
The flowers were really lovely.

1386
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:39,071
Oh, well, thank you, dear.
Glad you liked them.

1387
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:40,434
We'd, uh...

1388
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,915
We'd like to invite you to Thanksgiving.

1389
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:45,633
- Really?
- Yeah.

1390
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:49,918
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

1391
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:50,990
Good.

1392
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,751
That's him right there.
That's him right there.

1393
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,149
Where you been, Earl?

1394
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,159
I've been unavailable.

1395
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,515
Why you making us
have to do this, huh?

1396
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:28,920
You were warned, viejo.

1397
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,876
"Celebrating the life
of Mary Stone."

1398
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:36,637
Who the fuck is Mary Stone, huh?

1399
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,518
That's my wife. She passed.

1400
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,356
Yeah. I know I was warned.

1401
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,677
I went AWOL anyway, so

1402
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,117
I won't feel no ill will if you...

1403
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,079
Whatever goes on here.

1404
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:53,955
Just go ahead.

1405
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,033
Do the fucking...
Do what you have to do.

1406
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,833
Gustavo, we found him.

1407
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:05,910
Wait.
They're talking about Tata.

1408
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,993
He was at a funeral.
His wife was dying of cancer.

1409
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,275
Pero now he's finishing the run.

1410
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,390
Sounds like they're with him.

1411
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,314
He was warned.

1412
01:40:17,680 --> 01:40:19,000
/ don't care.

1413
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:23,274
Si Si Si.

1414
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:24,790
They're gonna Kill him.

1415
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,632
Gustavo,
he's the best mule we have.

1416
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,155
I need a lock on a GPS now.
And get the chopper in the air.

1417
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:33,393
Okay. Let him finish his drop.
If he fails, it's your head.

1418
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:36,910
Get it done.

1419
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,549
Okay.

1420
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,991
We have a location
on that GPS track.

1421
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:48,074
Illinois, a quarter mile east
off Interstate 55, exit 224.

1422
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:50,235
All right, here we go.

1423
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,510
Suspect is moving northbound.

1424
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,796
Unit one, go ahead and block
all northbound traffic.

1425
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,837
Units two and three, box him in
once we're in position.

1426
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:38,399
- Roger that.
- All right, here we go.

1427
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,198
It all comes down right here.

1428
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,394
All right, here we go.

1429
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:22,790
Charlie 223, helo 17 on top.

1430
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,029
Air team, we have a visual.

1431
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:32,593
Be smart. Slow down.

1432
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,715
All right.

1433
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,595
Let's go.

1434
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,911
Step out of the vehicle
with your hands up!

1435
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,195
Get out of the car!

1436
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,269
Driver, step out of the vehicle.
Put your hands in the air!

1437
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,033
Get out of the fucking vehicle now!

1438
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,235
Get out of the car!

1439
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:53,152
Get out of the car!

1440
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:02,674
Step out of the vehicle!
Put your hands above your head!

1441
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:06,195
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the vehicle!

1442
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,078
Let me see your hands!

1443
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,599
Put your hands in the air!

1444
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,954
- Your hands!
- Step away from the vehicle!

1445
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,593
Turn around, face the other way!

1446
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:13,829
Turn around!
Turn around!

1447
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,274
Turn around
and face the other way!

1448
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:19,798
Put your hands behind your head
and interlace your fingers.

1449
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,355
Now I want you to take steps back
towards me to the sound of my voice.

1450
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,880
There you go.

1451
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:29,998
That's it, keep coming.

1452
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:33,070
Here we go.

1453
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,435
That's it.

1454
01:43:52,720 --> 01:43:54,552
You.

1455
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:57,314
Yeah.

1456
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,310
Do you need
more staties here?

1457
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:02,390
No, no, no.

1458
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,198
- We're just gonna talk.
- Okay. All right.

1459
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,479
What happened to your face?

1460
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:27,070
Nothing.

1461
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,115
I just got what I damn well deserved,
is all.

1462
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:31,514
And the suit?

1463
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:34,519
Went to a funeral.

1464
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,634
My ex-wife's funeral.

1465
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:37,710
I'm sorry.

1466
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:44,110
Lucky, actually.
I got to spend some time with her.

1467
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:47,758
She let me in
and my whole family let me in.

1468
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:49,114
My daughter, everybody.

1469
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:52,350
Is this the daughter
that wouldn't talk to you?

1470
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:53,669
Yeah.

1471
01:44:54,240 --> 01:44:55,958
That's right. You remember that, huh?

1472
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,678
- I do.
- Huh.

1473
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,470
Well...

1474
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,999
Am I the guy who's responsible
for you missing your anniversary?

1475
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:09,474
You know, it's funny.

1476
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,918
After all this work and the time away,
you, of all people, were right.

1477
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:19,278
I ain't been right about much in life.

1478
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,990
Well, you made things straight
with your family.

1479
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,070
Yeah.

1480
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:28,870
I'm glad for you.

1481
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:31,918
That's the thing.
You just remember that.

1482
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,517
You remember that with your family.

1483
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:38,316
You don't need all that other shit.

1484
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,319
I'll try to.

1485
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:46,711
You take care of yourself, okay?

1486
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,110
You, too.

1487
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,190
Yeah.

1488
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,754
Hang in there.

1489
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:21,671
Earl Stone is a man
who served his country,

1490
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:23,273
fought for our freedom

1491
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,318
and now faces the loss of his own.

1492
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:31,791
Murdering cartel thugs,

1493
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,555
who not only took advantage
of his good nature

1494
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,312
but also his advanced age,
his vulnerability. Your Honor...

1495
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:39,470
Guilty.

1496
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,070
Earl.

1497
01:46:44,640 --> 01:46:45,630
Earl.

1498
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:48,280
Mr. Stone,
you should talk to your attorney.

1499
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,913
Earl, don't do this.

1500
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,157
- Earl...
- Guilty, Your Honor.

1501
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:54,915
I did it.

1502
01:46:55,560 --> 01:46:59,190
Mr. Stone, are you pleading guilty
on all charges?

1503
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,710
Yes.

1504
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,434
Bailiff. Take him into custody.

1505
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:10,231
Mr. Stone, you are remanded
into federal prison.

1506
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,639
You did a good job.

1507
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:21,396
We'll come visit you
every chance we can.

1508
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:22,875
Thanks.

1509
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,154
Mike and I will look after the farm.
Don't you worry, Grandpa.

1510
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,759
I know you will.

1511
01:47:35,560 --> 01:47:37,836
It's just time, is all.

1512
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:43,157
I could buy anything,
but I couldn't buy time.

1513
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:46,629
It's okay. We love you.

1514
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:53,839
All right. Thank you.

1515
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,829
At least we'll always know
where you are.

1516
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,877
Court is adjourned.

1517
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:14,153
- Good work, Special Agent.
- Thank you, sir.
