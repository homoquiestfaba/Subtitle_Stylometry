1
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,160
Dearest:

2
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,640
I feel certain that
I'm going mad again.

3
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,800
I feel we cannot go through another
of these terrible times

4
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,560
and I can't recover this time

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,680
I begin to hear voices...

6
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,480
and cannot concentrate.

7
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,080
So I am doing
what seems to be the best thing to do.

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,440
You have given me the
greatest possible happiness.

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,440
You have been in every way all
that anyone would be.

10
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,520
I know that I am
spoiling your life...

11
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,800
and without me
you could work...

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,960
and you will.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,640
I know.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,400
You see I cannot even
write this properly.

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,120
What I want to say is that
I owe all the happiness of my life to you.

16
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,480
You have been entirely patient with me...

17
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,320
and incredibly good.

18
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,320
Everything is gone for me...

19
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,680
but this certainity of your goodness.

20
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,040
I cannot go on spoiling your life any longer.

21
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,560
I don't think two people could have been
happier than we have been.

22
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
Virginia.

23
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,480
"THE HOURS"

24
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,000
-good days, doctor.
-Mr. Woolf.

25
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,920
I don't see him very lively.
I already see.

26
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,960
That it is in the place
to the one that belongs.

27
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,960
City of New York.

28
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Good morning, Leonard.

29
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,360
Good morning, Virginia.

30
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,720
How was your sleep?

31
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,480
Uneventful.

32
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,440
-headaches?
-no, no headaches.

33
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
Scanty in words.

34
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,400
-that's whole from this morning?
-yes.

35
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,960
This infant submitted his manuscript.

36
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,720
I found 3 errors of fact...

37
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,840
and 2 spelling mistakes...

38
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
and I am not yet on page 4.

39
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,080
You had breakfast?

40
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,920
yes.

41
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,680
Liar.

42
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
Victoria your existence in this
life...

43
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,240
you owe it to the doctors.

44
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,440
Nurse Nelly has left fruit
in the pantry.

45
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,720
Right, then in
the lunch...

46
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,720
a proper lunch, husband
and wife sitting together...

47
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,640
soup...putting it all.

48
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200
By force
if it is necessary.

49
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,000
Leonard, I believe
I may have a first sentence.

50
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,000
work then.

51
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,280
Then you must eat.

52
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,200
Mrs. Dalloway said...

53
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,080
she would buy the flowers...herself

54
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,960
Mrs. Dalloway said
she would buy the flowers herself.

55
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,000
Sally, I think that I will buy
the flowers myself.

56
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,240
What?

57
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,320
What flowers?

58
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,880
Shit.

59
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,080
You are never gonna be a big boy
if you don't eat your breakfast.

60
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,600
You are gonna be the big brother,
that it is an important job.

61
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,160
Happy Birthday.

62
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,000
Good morning, honey.

63
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,600
Oh, Gives.

64
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,080
Roses on your own birthday.

65
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,520
You are too much, really.

66
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
The gentleman chose for you.

67
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,440
It is your birthday, It should
have been I buying the flowers.

68
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
-oh, you were still sleeping.
-so?

69
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,560
Well, we decided it would be better
to let you sleep in a little, didn't we?.

70
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
Good morning, bug.

71
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,640
And you need to rest, Laura.
They are only four months away.

72
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,720
Don't. I am fine.
I'm just tired.

73
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,360
I have been telling him
if he's gonna eat his breakfast.

74
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,000
That's true.

75
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,160
So, It is a beautiful day.

76
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,160
What are two of you be doing?

77
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
We have got our plans. Don't we?

78
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,240
What plans?

79
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,240
Well, you wouldn't be much for party

80
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,560
if I ever told you every detail in advance.

81
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,480
Well I'd better stop asking questions, huh?

82
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,280
Look at the time, I better get going.

83
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
Have a good day.

84
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,600
You too.

85
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,520
Dan, Happy Birthday.

86
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,240
Oh, thank you.

87
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,360
You have not finished
your breakfast.

88
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,840
I am gonna make a cake.

89
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
That's what I'm gonna do.

90
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,120
I am gonna make a cake for dady's birthday.

91
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
Mommy, can I help?

92
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,400
Can I help make the cake?

93
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,600
Of course you can, sweet pea.

94
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,080
I am not gonna do anything without you.

95
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,600
No, of course,
you have to come.

96
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,520
Of course.

97
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,200
I have always wanted you Ann. Everybody involved in the actual ceremony.

98
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,880
I don't know. Around sixty?

99
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,640
Well it will... it would mean so much.

100
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
The whole occasion.

101
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,480
it's the least I can do to have
a nice dinner to say thank you everybody.

102
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,240
You have done so much for him.

103
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,640
Oh, I think that was a yes.

104
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,400
He'll be thrilled.
-Oh, my god.

105
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
-Oh that's great.I'm thrilled.Oh good
-what if nobody comes?

106
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,160
This is Clarissa Vaughan.

107
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,520
Yes I'm just confirming that you're sending
a car to pick me up first.

108
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,920
-hi Clarissa.
-hi Brenda.

109
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,920
And then going over 679 Hudson
which is 9 40.

110
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,480
Then you will take me uptown
and you will wait for us...

111
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,840
it will be over 7 00.

112
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,680
Flowers.

113
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,240
what a beautiful morning.

114
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,160
Hi, Clarissa.

115
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,760
How are you?

116
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,960
I am having a party.

117
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,040
My friend Richard's
won the Carrouthers.

118
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,960
Well, that is terrific...

119
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,080
if I knew what it was.

120
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,360
It is a poetry prize...

121
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,000
for a life's work.

122
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,200
It is the most prestigious.

123
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,360
For a poet, it is the best
you can do.

124
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,040
Oh, very good. So what would you like
the lillies are perfect.

125
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,480
No, too morbid.

126
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,960
Hydrangeas, I think.

127
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,640
And...

128
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,720
oh, let's just have buckets of roses.

129
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
And...

130
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
I think I'm gonna take these with me.

131
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,960
Rodney.

132
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,280
Thank you.

133
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,760
I actually tried to read
Richard's novel.

134
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,800
You did?

135
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,720
Oh, I know.

136
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,360
It is not easy.

137
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,720
I know. It did take him 10 years to write.

138
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,400
Maybe just takes another 10 to read.

139
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,480
-it's you, isn't it?
-what is?

140
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,400
In the novel. She meant to be you.

141
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,200
Oh, I see.

142
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,280
Yes, sort of.

143
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
I mean, in a way.

144
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
Richard is the writer. That's what he is.

145
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,760
It -uses things which actually happened.
-Yes.

146
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,280
Ten years ago he and I were
students, that is true.

147
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,600
-but you know then he changes things.
-Oh, sure.

148
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't mean in a bad way.

149
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,480
It is more like

150
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,080
he makes it his own...

151
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,240
A woman's whole life...

152
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,080
in a single day.

153
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,160
Just one day.

154
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,520
And in that day...

155
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,000
her whole life.

156
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,360
This is what we need,
short nail.

157
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
Mrs. Dalloway.

158
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
-it's you?
-yes.

159
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,120
It is me.It's me.

160
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,680
Come in.

161
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,160
Oh, Richard, it is a beautiful morning.

162
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,200
How about, we let in a little more light.

163
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,280
Is it still morning?

164
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
Yes, it is.

165
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,640
Have I died?

166
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Good morning, my dear.

167
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,000
Any visitors?

168
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes.

169
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,880
Are they still here?

170
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,040
No, they have gone.

171
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,600
-How they looked?
-today?

172
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,360
Sort of like black fire.

173
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,920
I mean sort of light and dark
at the same time.

174
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,120
There was one that looked
like an electrified jellyfish.

175
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,360
He was singing.

176
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,480
May have been Greek.

177
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,840
So, the ceremoníal is at 5.

178
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
Do you remember?

179
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,760
And then...

180
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,320
the party is right after.

181
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,960
They didn't bring you the
breakfast, didn't they?

182
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,080
What a question. Of course.

183
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,920
Richard, you did eat it?

184
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,000
can you see it?

185
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,160
Is it here?

186
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,280
Do you see a breakfast lying around?

187
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,520
No, I don't see it.

188
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,880
Oh then I must have
eaten it. Wasn't I?

189
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,840
I suppose.

190
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,480
Does it matter?

191
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
Of course it matters.

192
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,120
You know what the doctors say.

193
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,400
Have been skipping pills?

194
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,800
Of course, I cannot take this.

195
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,880
To take what?

196
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,840
To try to be proud and brave...

197
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,320
in front of everybody.

198
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,680
Honey, it is not a performance.

199
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Of course it is. I have gotten the
prize for my performance.

200
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,600
That is nonsense.

201
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,480
I have gotten the prize for having AIDS,
going nuts...

202
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,640
and being brave about it.

203
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,000
-actualy got that prize for having come through.
-no it is true.

204
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,600
To survive then...
-no it is true.

205
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,960
...that's what I got the prize for.

206
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,120
you think that they would have given it to me
if I were healthy?

207
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,920
yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

208
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Is it here somewhere?

209
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,960
What?

210
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The prize?

211
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'd like to look at it.

212
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,840
No, you know, you have not gotten it yet.

213
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,520
It is tonight.

214
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,720
Are you sure?

215
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,200
I remember the ceremony
perfectly.

216
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,720
It seemed to have fallen out of time.

217
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,840
Richard.

218
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,520
Richard.

219
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
It is a party.

220
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,600
It is only a party.

221
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,320
Populated entirely by people who respect and admire you.

222
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,960
A small party, is it?

223
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,440
Select party, is it?

224
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,320
Your friends.

225
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,080
I thought I lost
all my friends.

226
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,480
I thought I drew my friends crazy.

227
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,120
-Jesus.
-Oh, Mrs. Dalloway...

228
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,760
... always giving parties...

229
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,080
to cover the silence.

230
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,400
Richard...

231
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,720
you won't need to do anything,
all you have to do is appear...

232
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,920
sat on the sofa.

233
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,160
And I will be there.

234
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,480
This is a group of people...

235
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,560
who want to tell you your work is going to live.

236
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,520
Is it?

237
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,160
Is my work going to live?

238
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,920
I cannot go through with the Carrouthers.

239
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,600
Why do you say that?

240
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,480
I can't.

241
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,200
Why?

242
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
Because I wanted to be a writer, that is all.

243
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,080
So?

244
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,880
I wanted to write about it all.

245
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,200
everything that happens in a moment.

246
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,080
The way the flowers look, when you care them
in your arms.

247
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,040
it's towl, how it smells...

248
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,480
how it feels... it's thread.

249
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,160
All our feelings
yours and mine.

250
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,920
The history of it.

251
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,920
Who we once were.

252
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,840
Everything in the world.

253
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,040
Everything all mixed up.

254
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Like it is all mixed up now.

255
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,440
And I failed.

256
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
I failed.

257
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,120
No matter what you start being
and end up with being so much less.

258
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,680
share fucking pride.

259
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,440
A stupidity.

260
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,520
Do we want everything, don't we?

261
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,160
I suppose we do.

262
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,000
You kissed me on a beach.

263
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
yes.

264
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,680
Do you remember?

265
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,280
How many years ago.

266
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,800
Of course.

267
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Why did you want it..

268
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,240
that?

269
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,920
Come closer.

270
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,240
I am right here.

271
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,960
Come closer. Would you please?

272
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,160
take my hand.

273
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,160
Would you be angry...?

274
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,200
would I be angry if you
didn't show up in the party?

275
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,000
Would you be angry if I died?

276
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
If you died?

277
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,200
Who is this party for?

278
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,960
What do you mean who is it for?"

279
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,880
Why are you asking?
What are you trying to say?

280
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,960
I am not trying to say anything.

281
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm saying, I think I'm only staying alive
to satisfy you.

282
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,240
well, so that is what we do.

283
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,040
That is what people do. They stay
alive for each other.

284
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,920
The doctors told you.
You don't need to die.

285
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,800
They have told you that.
You can live like this way per years.

286
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Well, exactly.

287
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,000
I don't accept this.

288
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,760
I don't accept what you say.

289
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,200
and it's for you to decide?

290
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,240
How long have you been doing that?

291
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,640
How many years...

292
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,480
cleaning the apartment?

293
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,880
What about your own life?

294
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,680
What about Sally?

295
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,680
Just wait till I die.

296
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,480
And then you will have
to think of yourself.

297
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,000
And you're going to like that.

298
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,800
Richard...

299
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
it would be great if
you did come to the party.

300
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,160
If you feelt well enough to come.

301
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,800
Just let you know I'm making the crab thing.

302
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,840
not that I mention it makes any difference to you.

303
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,040
Of course it makes the difference.
I love the crab thing.

304
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,680
Clarissa.

305
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,040
yes?

306
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,960
I will be back at 3.30.

307
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,600
So you will hardly get dressed.

308
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,200
Wonderful.

309
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,280
At three thirty.

310
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,440
Wonderful.

311
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,600
It is on this day...puts

312
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,400
this day of all days.

313
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,880
Her fate becomes clear to her.

314
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
Excuse me, Mrs. Woolf.

315
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,320
Mr. Woolf said
I was to come and speak with you.

316
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,920
Nearly finished, Nelly.
Wait to me in the kitchen.I'll be done very soon.

317
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
What happens if she says she does something?

318
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,920
and turns out she doesn't?

319
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,360
Oh, and she never does it,
does she?

320
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
she never wants anything.

321
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,960
But what she wants
is particularly out reach...

322
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
it was a showside.

323
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,560
I wish I had been there.

324
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,680
I wish she had told.

325
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,600
but you gave her that look.I saw him look you doing.

326
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
I said, imagine...

327
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes, Nelly, tell me. How can I help?

328
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,560
It is about lunch.

329
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,800
I just have to go ahead on my own.

330
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,160
I understand.

331
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,240
you chose a pie?

332
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,000
I chose a lamb pie.

333
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,320
It seems suitable.

334
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,880
you've been so busy with your writing...

335
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I had no instructions.

336
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,360
You do remember that my sister is coming...

337
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,400
at four with the children?

338
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,400
Yes, Mrs..
I have not forgotten.

339
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,560
China tea, I think.

340
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,040
And ginger.

341
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,000
ginger, Madam?

342
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,840
I like to give the
children a treat.

343
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,080
We have to go to London
for ginger Madam...

344
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,480
I have not finished this,
there is the rest of the lunch to get ready.

345
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,160
12:30 train will get you
in London just after 1...

346
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,520
if you return on the 2:30
you will be back in Richmond soon after 3.

347
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,800
Do I miscalculate?

348
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
No.

349
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,160
Then is it something entertaining you Nelly?

350
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,480
I cannot see anything else easier
than a trip to London.

351
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,800
Good morning, Mrs. Woolf.

352
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,480
Good morning.

353
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,800
We should publish no more
new authors.

354
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,840
I have to tell I have discovered
ten errors in the first proof.

355
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,880
Lucky that you've found them then.

356
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,280
"Pasandel, was, a channel house..."

357
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,600
"from which no men returned."

358
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,800
Do you think it's possible bad writing
actually attract the higher incidents of era?

359
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,560
If it is all right I thought I might take a short walk.

360
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,000
Will you take a lot?

361
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,040
No, it will be short.

362
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,480
Go then.

363
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,200
If I could walk every morning
I would be a happy man.

364
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,760
She will die.

365
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,840
She is going to die.

366
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,040
That is what's going to happen.

367
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,360
she will kill herself.

368
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,120
she will kill herself over something which doesn't seem to matter.

369
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
Let's think.

370
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,760
You have to grease
the pan mommy.

371
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,360
I know it is good to grease the pans sweet pea
even the mommy knows that.

372
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,840
This is what we gonna do.

373
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,640
Flour.

374
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,160
bowl.

375
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,960
sifter.

376
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,200
Can I do it mommy?

377
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,520
Can you sift the flour?

378
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,560
yes...

379
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,160
you can sift the flour baby,
if that's what makes you happy.

380
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,200
isn't it beautiful?

381
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,400
Don't you think it looks like snow?

382
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,440
okay. Now...

383
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,360
the next thing,
next thing I'm gonna show you...

384
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,680
...is to measure of the cups.

385
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,600
Mommy, it isn't that difficult.

386
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,640
No, I know that it isn't difficult.
It is just that I...

387
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,640
just wanna do this for daddy.

388
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,520
Because it is birthday?

389
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,920
that's right.

390
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,920
We are baking the cake
to show him that we love him.

391
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,200
otherwise he won't know we love him?

392
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,080
that's right.

393
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,400
I have got all the stuff.

394
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm going right out again.

395
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,040
My God, what a zoo.

396
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,040
Why do people have to
talk about dry cleaning?

397
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,840
what is it to tal about?

398
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,560
I bought you some flowers.

399
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,800
Where are you?

400
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
in here.

401
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,240
I found somebody in the work to cover me.
I will be with you all night.

402
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,440
Are you all right?

403
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,640
Sure.

404
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,280
I guess you saw Richard.

405
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,640
that's right.

406
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,240
well, of course.

407
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,120
I bet he said: Oh, by the way honey,
do you mind, can I skip the party?

408
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,400
Don't worry, he always shows up...

409
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,640
oh sure.

410
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,680
in the end.

411
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,480
What?

412
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,880
Richard miss
the chance to talk about his work?

413
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,040
I don't think so.
He will show up.

414
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,720
You did the seating?

415
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,840
I did.

416
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,720
I don't believe it. Louis Walters.
Is Louis coming?

417
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,480
Richard's Louis?

418
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,720
he is.

419
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,400
You put him next to me.

420
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,960
Why do I always have
to sit next to the ex's...

421
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,320
is that some kind of a hand sweetheart?

422
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,880
anyway, there should be a ex's table of their own

423
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,840
where they can all...

424
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,640
ex together...

425
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,040
with exquisite agony...?

426
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,280
I'm off.

427
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,440
try to pass out from excitement.

428
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:53,640
Clarissa, it is going to be beautiful.

429
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,400
Thank you.

430
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,880
you're welcome.

431
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,800
Why is everything wrong?

432
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,800
It didn't work.

433
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,600
Damn it.

434
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,880
It didn't work

435
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,640
Hey, Scott.

436
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,040
Hi, Mrs. Barlow.

437
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,400
Mommy, mommy, there is someone at the door.

438
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,560
Hello?

439
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,560
Laura?
-Hi Kitty,

440
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,320
-Hi Am I attracting?
-oh of course not, come in.

441
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,880
Are you all right?

442
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,680
why, sure.

443
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,680
Hi, Richie.

444
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
Sit down, I have got coffee off.

445
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,920
would you like some?

446
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,840
Please.

447
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,520
oh look, you made a cake.

448
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,160
I know.

449
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,320
It didn't work.

450
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
I thought that it was gonna work.

451
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
I thought that it would work better than that.

452
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,080
Laura, I don't understand why you
find it so difficult.

453
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
I don't know.

454
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,440
-anyone can make a cake. It's ridiculously easy.

455
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,760
like, I bet you didn't grease
the pan.

456
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
I greased the pan.

457
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,080
All right.

458
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,960
Do you know? You have other
aptitudes...

459
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,360
And Dan..
he won't even notice.

460
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,960
whatever you do
he is gonna say it is wonderful.

461
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,560
well, it is true.

462
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,560
Does Ray have a birthday?

463
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,000
sure he does.

464
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,120
When is it?

465
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,120
September.

466
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
We'll go to the country club.

467
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,400
We always go to the country club.

468
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,720
We drink martinis, and spend
the day with fifty people.

469
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,320
Ray has got
a lot of friends.

470
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,200
yes he does.

471
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,040
you both have a lot of friends.

472
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,200
You are good at it.

473
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,080
How is Ray?
I have not seen him in a while.

474
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,720
Ray is fine.

475
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,720
These guys are something,
aren't they?

476
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
Yes. You can say that again.

477
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,960
He came home from the war.
They deserved it, didn't they..

478
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,320
-after what they have been through.
-what, did they deserve?

479
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,360
i don't know.Us I guess.
All this.

480
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,240
You are reading a book.

481
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,360
What is this one about?

482
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,040
It is about... This woman is incredibly.
well, she is a hostess, and she is incredibly confident.

483
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,640
She is going to give a party. And may be because
she's confident everyone thinks she is fine.

484
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,520
But she isn't.

485
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,440
So?

486
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,120
Kitty, what is it? Is something wrong?

487
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,840
I have to go to the hospital
for a couple of days.

488
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,880
Kitty...

489
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:30,040
I have some kind of a quills
in my uterus and...

490
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,760
they are gonna go in and take a look.

491
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,120
When?

492
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,560
This afternoon.

493
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
I need you to feed the dog.

494
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,120
Of course.

495
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,760
Is that what you came here to ask?

496
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,400
What did the doctors say
exactly?

497
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,360
It is probably trouble with the spine

498
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,920
About getting pregnant.

499
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
The thing is that...

500
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,280
I mean, you know...

501
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:22,240
I have been really happy with Ray.

502
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,160
And now it is that there is a reason,
there is a reason I couldn't conceive.

503
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,000
You are lucky Laura.

504
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,320
I don't think you can call yourself a woman
until you are a mother

505
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,480
Where the joke is...

506
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,440
all my life I could do everything.

507
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:58,040
I mean, I could do anything,
really.

508
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,200
Except the one thing I wanted.

509
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,800
-yes.
-that's all.

510
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,200
At least now they will be able to deal with it.

511
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,000
That's right.That's what they'll be doing.

512
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,640
I am not worried.
what would be the point of worrying?

513
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,600
No, it is not in your hands.

514
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,760
That's it.

515
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,440
It is in the hands of some
physician I have never even met.

516
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,720
Some surgeon who probably
drinks more martinis than Ray.

517
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,800
Oh, Kitty.

518
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,280
I mean, I am so
worried by Ray.

519
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,720
Come here.
I am doing fine, really.

520
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,120
I know. I know that you are.

521
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,480
I am more worried about Ray.
if anything is not good with this stuff.

522
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,560
Forget about Ray. Just forget about Ray.

523
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,440
You are sweet.

524
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,000
You know the routine, right?

525
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,960
Half a can in the evening
and to check the water now and then and...

526
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,200
Ray will feed him
in the morning.

527
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,080
Kitty, you didn't mind?

528
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,360
What?

529
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
I didn't mind what?

530
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,760
Do you want me to drive you?

531
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,840
I think I'll feel better
if I drive myself.

532
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,200
Kitty, it's gonna be all right.

533
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,520
Of course it is.

534
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,560
Bye.

535
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,000
What? What do you want?

536
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,200
Mr. Woolf, Mrs. Bell
has arrived.

537
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,920
Not due till 4.

538
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,960
I cannot help that...

539
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,400
She is here.

540
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,840
You look a perfect angel
...

541
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,440
don't let the boys
make fun of you.

542
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,440
Fly away.

543
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,040
Virginia.

544
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,880
Leonard thinks he sees end of civilization

545
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,720
people are invited to 4...

546
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,160
and arrived at 2.30.

547
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,560
Oh God.

548
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,880
Barbarians.

549
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,760
We have finished lunch sooner
than we imagined.

550
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,800
I'd have to send Nelly of
to London for sugar ginger.

551
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,080
No Virginia.

552
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,200
You have lots of frightened of servants,
are you?

553
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,280
Come on.

554
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,600
And how are you sister?

555
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,040
Frantic, it has been ridiculous
in London.

556
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,760
Ridiculous? How?

557
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,160
Busy.

558
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,200
Why is busy ridiculous?

559
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,800
I would have invited you to our
party but...

560
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,880
I knew you would not come.

561
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,560
Did you? How did you know that?

562
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,880
I thought you
will never come to town.

563
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,560
must because you no
longer ask me.

564
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,880
only if you are not forbidden to come.

565
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,120
do the doctors not forbit it?

566
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,720
The doctors...

567
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,560
You are not paying to heal
to doctors?

568
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,480
Not when they are a bunch of
contemporary Victorians.

569
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,560
What are you saying?
Are you feeling better?

570
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,080
has this fastness made you
stronger?

571
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,360
I'm saying Vanessa, that even
crazy people has right to be asked.

572
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,880
Nessa, Nessa, Nessa...

573
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,680
Hello changelings.

574
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:48,840
What have you got?

575
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,440
-what have you found?
We found a bird.

576
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,280
Did you? Where did you find that?

577
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,720
I think he must have been fallen
from a tree.

578
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,200
Oh my Goodness.Just look at him.

579
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,480
You konw you have to save him.

580
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,760
To save him?

581
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,240
I think you have to be
careful Quentin.

582
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,480
There is a time to die and
it's maybe the bird's time.

583
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,240
Come on, Let's pick grass
to make him a grave.

584
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:13,760
Oh Julián.

585
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,800
Just saying. At least he'll have a bed to lie on.

586
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,720
come on Nessa, let us make
a grave.

587
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,680
Nessa, come on.

588
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,760
God, very well, I'm heading.
Wait for me than.

589
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,160
Angelic, he'll be all right?

590
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,520
You go very quickly.

591
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,080
Do you think she liked roses?

592
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,800
Is this a she?

593
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,080
yes, the female is larger...

594
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,040
and less colorful.

595
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,760
What happens when we die?

596
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,520
What happens?

597
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,080
We return to the place that
we came from.

598
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,800
I don't remember where
I came from.

599
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,040
Nor do I.

600
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,120
She gets very small.

601
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,960
Yes, that's one of the thinks that happens.

602
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,240
We look small.

603
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,840
and very peaceful.

604
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,320
has it done?
have you finished?

605
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,560
Is the bird funeral complete?

606
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,480
Yes.

607
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,640
Very well then, I not wait for
you angered for coming so early.

608
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,680
Not of course not.

609
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,080
come on boys
We will have tea.

610
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,880
Oh, stop it Julián.

611
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,080
Julián go inside.

612
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,200
Hey Bug. I've got this idea.

613
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
We're gonna make another cake.

614
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,040
We're gonna make a better one.

615
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,160
What happened to the first one?

616
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,240
And after that I think
we should go out.

617
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,640
yes?

618
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,880
Clarissa? It's Louis.

619
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,360
-Louis Waters.
-Louis?

620
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,600
Oh my God,
you're early.

621
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,600
Do you mind?
Is it all right?

622
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,560
Why should I mind?

623
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,680
I am delighted.
-well, hello.

624
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,520
I feel like I interrupted.

625
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,280
-why, no?
I know...

626
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,480
that the ceremony is
up to 5...

627
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,280
but I flew this morning.

628
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,600
Well, Richard's going to be thrilled.

629
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,080
He will be thrilled to see you.

630
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,600
You think so?
-of course.

631
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,360
What are we doing?
We should go in.

632
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,480
Are you all right?

633
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,760
Yes. It is nothing.

634
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,840
It's just the party.
-Oh, right.

635
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,120
-Oh, wow.it is looking beautiful.
-thanks.

636
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Are you still with...?
-Yes, I am.

637
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm still with her.
Ten years.

638
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,360
It is crazy.
-why is it crazy?

639
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,160
No reason. Would you like
something to drink?

640
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,960
-some water.
-okay.

641
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,280
Are you still an editor?

642
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,640
-Oh, sure.
-with the same publisher?

643
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,960
Hhm hhm. How is San Francisco?

644
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,800
It is one of those cities people tell you to like.

645
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,040
Richard said he thought you were
happy out there.

646
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,720
Great. It's another illness makes him psychic.

647
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,560
You have to prepare yourself Louis. He is very changed...

648
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,560
I've read the book.
-Oh God.

649
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,880
Exactly. I thought he meant to do more than just change
people's names.

650
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,000
-well...
-isn't it meant to be fiction.

651
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,200
He even had your living
on 10th street.

652
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,440
-Is it me.
-isn't it?

653
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,720
You know how Richard is.
It is a fantasy.

654
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,320
A whole chapter on should she buy some nail polish...

655
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,520
and than guess what, after 50 pages
she doesn't.

656
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,040
the whole thing seems to go on for eternity,

657
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,560
and nothing happens and then wow.

658
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,160
for no reason she kills herself.

659
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,960
His mother kills herself
yes sure, his mother but still for no reason.

660
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,760
-well I think...
-out of the blue.

661
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,880
I know the book is tough.
but I like it. I know.

662
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,120
Only one thing upset me.

663
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,400
What's that? What upset you?

664
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,280
Well that there was not more about you.

665
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,520
That's kind.

666
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,480
I went back to Welfleed.

667
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,840
-you did?
One day. I didn't tell you?

668
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,560
No, but then I'd never seen you.

669
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,200
You remember the house?
it still there.

670
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,880
I think you're courageous.

671
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,200
courageous? Why?

672
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,800
To there,go visit. What I mean is
to face the fact...

673
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:33,800
that we have lost those
feelings forever.

674
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,720
-Mierda.
-Clarissa?

675
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,840
I don't know what's happening?.
I'm sorry.

676
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,760
I am in a strange sort of mood.

677
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,440
It is very rude of me.

678
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,960
I seem to be unraveling.

679
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,120
-I shouldn't have coma.
-no, it's not you, it's not you.

680
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:04,920
It is having a premonition,
do you know what i mean?

681
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,080
oh god, probably just being nervous
about the party.

682
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,280
I know I'm a bad bad hostess.

683
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,840
Clarissa what's happening?

684
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,600
-Jesus.
-what is it?

685
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,000
Do you want me to go?
-no, don't go.

686
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,680
don't go, explain to me
why this is happening.

687
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,600
don't, don't touch me.

688
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,280
Jesus, it's better if you don't.

689
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,960
It's just too much. You're flying
from San Francisco...

690
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,760
and I have been nursing Richard
for years.

691
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,360
And all the time
I held myself together...

692
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,120
-no problem.
I know.

693
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:06,240
One morning in Welfleed,
you were there...

694
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,160
we were all there...

695
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,680
I'd been sleeping with him
and I was out of the back porch...

696
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:20,120
he came right behind me, and he put his hand
on my shoulder.

697
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,320
Good morning Mrs. Dalloway.

698
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,120
I had been all night being stucked.

699
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,320
Stucked?

700
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,840
With the name I mean.

701
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,960
And now you, walking...

702
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,040
just see you walking because I never see you...
look at you...

703
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:09,280
anyway, it doesn't matter. It was you he stayed with
It was you he lived with.

704
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,880
I had one summer.

705
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,400
The day I left him...

706
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,760
I got on a train and made my way across Europe.

707
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,800
I felt free for the first time in years.

708
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,480
So, tell me about San Francisco.

709
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:56,880
What's to tell?

710
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,240
stone teach traumatic idiots
mostly.

711
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,280
They cannot all be idiots.

712
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,800
No, no...In fact I should not tell you this.

713
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,840
I have fallen in love.

714
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,920
-Really?
-Yes.

715
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,760
-with a student.
-with a student.

716
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,360
Exactly. I know, you think...

717
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,160
Am I still up for this, all this intensity
all this arguments...

718
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,600
doors being slapped...

719
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,640
but you know what it is like.

720
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,320
Are you feeling better?

721
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,720
A little.

722
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:37,520
Thank you.

723
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,600
You think I am ridiculous?

724
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,320
Ridiculous?

725
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,400
Fortunate, too.

726
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,920
I'm gonna leave you to
Mrs. Latchs.

727
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:21,960
I have to do something.

728
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,320
Mommy I don't wanna go.

729
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,280
You have to. I'm sorry.
I have something to do before dady's home

730
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,120
Hello.

731
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,680
Hello Mrs. Latch.
My boy is not very happy.

732
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,360
Mommy I don't wanna do this.

733
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,080
I have to go honey.

734
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,800
Your mother has things she
has to do.

735
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,920
Come on.
I've got cookies.

736
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,120
Okay baby.

737
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:46,360
You have to be brave now.

738
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,120
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine.

739
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,800
Honey.

740
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,080
Come on, come on darling.

741
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,760
-mommy.
-stop it.

742
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,920
-mommy.
You -have to stop.

743
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:50,640
Mommy, mommy, mommy...

744
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:58,200
Mommy, mommy, no.

745
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:31,600
The breakfast is served between 7 and 11
in the regency room...

746
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,280
and the room service
is available 24 hours.

747
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,480
Thank you, Ma'am..

748
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,040
Is there anything else you need?

749
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,600
Yes,...

750
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,560
No. Not to be disturbed.

751
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,440
"Did it matter then?, she asked herself
walking toward Bond street."

752
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:10,120
"Did it matter" that she asked inevitably,
sees completely,"

753
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,560
"... all this must go on without her?"

754
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,760
"did she resent it..."

755
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,680
"... or did it not become consoling..."

756
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,880
"... to believe that death ended
absolutely?"

757
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,600
"It is possible to die."

758
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,200
"It is possible to die."

759
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,440
There was a lovely coat for
Angelic in Harrods...

760
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,920
but nothing for the boys. It seems so unfair.
Only Angelic be favored.

761
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,960
Virginia?

762
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,040
Virginia.

763
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,720
Virginia.

764
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,920
what are you thinking about?

765
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,400
Are you still with us?

766
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,040
Your arts are very lucky,
Angelic.

767
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,840
She has two lives...

768
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:31,040
she has the life that she is eating...

769
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:33,480
and also that of the books
that she is writing.

770
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,280
This makes her very fortunate indeed.

771
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,160
what were you thinking about?

772
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,960
I was going to kill my heroine.

773
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,880
But I've changed my mind.

774
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,760
Again.

775
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,040
And I'm afraid I have to kill someone else
instead.

776
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,440
I am clever.

777
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,920
A fascinating visit.

778
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,880
I enjoyed it completely.

779
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,400
Do you have to go really?

780
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,960
I wish you wouldn't go.

781
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,480
Oh,Virginia the last thing you want is our noiseness.

782
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,600
My hopeless, clumsy boys.

783
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,640
-Say good bye boys.
-good-bye.

784
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:14,240
When will you return to Walt?
-tonight.

785
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,480
He suffers so much the whole day...

786
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,600
you could not even live,
Virginia.

787
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,800
But I do.

788
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:03,440
Say something Nessa,didn't you think I seem better.

789
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,760
Yes, Virginia, you seem better.

790
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,680
You think...?

791
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
You think I may one day escape?

792
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,120
One day.

793
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:36,520
-Nessa.
come on Nessa.

794
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:39,440
come Angelic, we should leave.

795
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,680
We -go.
-good-bye.

796
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,280
good-bye little girl.

797
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:48,160
Angelic, the train.

798
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,080
We're gonna miss the train.

799
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,040
Hurry, a big step.

800
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,480
Come on, Come on, Come on.
I wanna go home.

801
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,440
We stayed too long,
we will miss the train.

802
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,440
Stay close.

803
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,760
I'm sorry, I know.

804
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,080
I tried to get here earlier.
I tried, okay? Don't start.

805
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,960
I know, it is just incredibly wrong
because...

806
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,520
it is your party.

807
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,280
Julia...

808
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:44,160
how have you been doing?

809
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,280
I am fine.

810
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,440
come here.

811
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:49,000
What have you been doing?

812
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,560
Well, studying, mom.

813
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:57,160
So...

814
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,240
what should I do, cherries?

815
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:02,440
No, let's clear of the desk first.
We will take it into the bedroom.

816
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,240
I bumped into Louis Waters.

817
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,280
-Oh, you did? Where?
-in the street.

818
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,880
They are all here, aren't they?
All the ghosts.

819
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,880
All the ghosts are celebrating
the party.

820
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,120
He is... so weird.

821
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,680
Oh, what?
you cannot see that?

822
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,480
You cannot see that Louis Waters
is weird?

823
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,800
I can see that he's sad.

824
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,440
All your friends are sad.

825
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,920
You have been crying.
What's happening?

826
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,400
all the day as I looked around
this room and I thought:

827
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,400
I'm giving a party...

828
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,520
all I want to do is give a party.

829
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:54,160
And?

830
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,920
I know why he does it,
he does it deliberately.

831
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,960
-Oh, is this Richard.
-of course.

832
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,840
He did it this morning...

833
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,520
He gives me that look.

834
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,240
What look?

835
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,600
To say...

836
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,440
your life is frivolous.

837
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,760
You... you are so... frivolous.

838
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,240
Just...daily stuff you know schedules and parties...
and details

839
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,440
That is what he means.

840
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,920
That is what he's saying.

841
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,240
Mom, that only matters if
you think that's true.

842
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,200
well?
Do you? Tell me.

843
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,720
Well I'm living my field.

844
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,200
Yes, I am living...

845
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,680
and when I am not with him,

846
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,000
yes, everything does seem sort of

847
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,560
silly.

848
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,840
I don't mean with you
God.Jesus.

849
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,040
Never with you.

850
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,040
Just all the rest of it.

851
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,200
Sally?

852
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,520
The rest of it.

853
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,480
False comfort.

854
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,520
Because...

855
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,360
-if you say to me when were you happiest.
-mom...

856
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,920
tell me the moment you were
happiest.

857
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,320
I know. I know, it was years ago.

858
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,920
Yes.

859
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,080
All you are saying is...

860
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,880
you were once young.

861
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:52,920
I remember one morning...

862
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,800
getting up at the dawn...

863
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,880
there was such a sense of possibility.

864
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,440
Do you know? The feeling?

865
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,800
And.. and I remember thinking
myself:

866
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,480
"So this is the beginning of
the happiness..."

867
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,160
"this is where it starts."

868
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,280
"And of course there always
be more."

869
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:19,200
never occurred to me...

870
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,880
it was not the beginning.

871
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,160
It was happiness.

872
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,440
It was the moment...

873
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,320
right then.

874
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,560
Mary, good morning. I was wondering if you've seen Mrs. Woolf?

875
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,640
I thought you knew, Sir.
Mrs. Woolf has gone out.

876
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:39,240
Permission, permission.

877
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,160
I am astonished for
this unexpected pleasure.

878
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,560
Perhaps you can tell me exactly
what you think you are doing?

879
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,960
-what I was doing?
I went to look for you and you were not there.

880
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,360
You were working in the garden,
I didn't wish to disturb you.

881
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,680
You disturb me when you disappear.

882
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,120
I didn't disappear.

883
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:22,600
I went for a walk.
-a walk?

884
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,080
Is that all?
Just a walk?

885
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,640
Virginia? We must go home now,
Nelly is cooking the dinner...

886
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,600
she has already had a vey difficult day. It is just our
obligation to eat Nelly's  dinner.

887
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,280
There is no such obligation.

888
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:37,240
no such obligation exists.

889
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,440
-Virginia, you have an obligation to your insanity.
you always have this custody.

890
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,000
you have this imprisonment.
-Oh, Virginia.

891
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,120
I am attended by doctors.

892
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,120
every where I'm attended by doctors
who inform me of my own interest.

893
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,320
-they know your interests.
-they do not.

894
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,880
-they don't speak for my interests.
-Virginia, I can...

895
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,720
I can see that it must be hard for
a woman of your...

896
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,440
of what?
-of my what exactly?

897
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,560
talents to see that she may not be the best judge
of her own condition.

898
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,240
Who hell is a better judge?

899
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,440
You have a history.

900
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:15,280
You have a history of confinement. We brought you
to Richmond because you have a history of fits...

901
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,240
moods,blackouts
hearing voices.

902
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:25,600
We brought you here to save you from the irrevocable damage
you intended to put on yourself.

903
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,120
You've tried to kill yourself twice.

904
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,160
I live daily with that threat.

905
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:37,000
I set up the press... we set up the printing press
not just for itself...

906
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,320
not just for itself but.

907
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:44,440
But you might have a ready source of
absorption and remedy.

908
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,760
I need a work.

909
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,160
It was done for you.

910
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,200
It was done for your betterment.

911
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,560
It was done out of love.

912
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,600
If I didn't know you better, I'd call
this ingratitude.

913
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,200
I am ungrateful?

914
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,240
You call me ungrateful.

915
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,760
My life has been stolen from me.

916
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:15,360
I am living in a town
I have no wish to live in. I am living...

917
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:19,200
a life I have no wish to live.

918
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,280
How did this happen?

919
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,560
It is time for us to move back to London.

920
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,880
I missed London.

921
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,880
I missed London life.

922
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:55,800
This is not you speaking, Virginia.

923
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,720
This is an aspect of your illness...
It is my voice.

924
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:01,880
it is not your voice.
It is mine, only mine.

925
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:05,160
it is not, could you listen?
-no it is it... it is mine.

926
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:08,160
I am dying in this town.

927
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:16,520
If you were thinking clearly, Virginia.
You will recall that London broke your love.

928
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,080
If I were thinking clearly...

929
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,680
-if I were thinking clearly...
We brought -you to Richmond to give you peace.

930
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:29,400
If I were thinking clearly,
Leonard, I would tell you:

931
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:31,640
that I restle, alone...

932
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,200
in the dark, in the deep dark
. And that only I can know...

933
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,160
Only I can understand my
own condition.

934
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:43,960
You live with the threat, you tell me.
You live with the threat of my extinction.

935
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,720
Leonard, I live with it too.

936
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:53,960
This is my right.

937
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,880
It is the right of every human being.

938
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,280
I choose not to suffocating anesthetic
of these suburbs...

939
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:03,920
but the violent jolt of the capital,
that is my choice.

940
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,760
The meanist patient, even the very lowest is allowed

941
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:12,400
some say in the matter of their prescription.

942
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,120
the matter she defines humanity.

943
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,520
I wish for your sake, Leonard,
I could be happy in this quiteness.

944
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:36,000
But if it is a choice between
Richmond and death...

945
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,880
I choose death.

946
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,800
Very well, London then.

947
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:54,360
We will go back to London.

948
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,800
Are you hungry?

949
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,960
I feel hungry myself.

950
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Come on.

951
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,840
You cannot find peace avoiding
life, Leonard.

952
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,240
Train to London in platform 1.

953
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,400
Mommy. Mommy.

954
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,240
Hey, there Bug, hey what's wrong?

955
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,960
-Hi Mrs. Latch, sorry I'm late.
He is fine. He's a bit of fine.

956
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:09,480
-he is just happy to see you.
-Oh, could have been that bad, could it?

957
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:12,000
-Oh, so you got a cut that?
-Yes, yes, probably.

958
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,480
That's good.
-they didn't have to do very much.

959
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,960
Well, we had a fine time together.

960
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,200
Thank you very much.

961
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,480
So, that wasn't too bad, was it?

962
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,960
I wasn't gone too long.

963
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,200
-no, you weren't out long.
-that is right.

964
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,560
One point...

965
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,120
I don't know.

966
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:47,760
There was a moment I thought
it might be longer.

967
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,680
But I changed my mind.

968
01:23:58,400 --> 01:23:59,760
What is it, honey?

969
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,040
Mommy, I love you.

970
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,320
I love you, too baby.

971
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,400
What's wrong?

972
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,720
What?

973
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,000
Don't worry honey
everything is fine.

974
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,800
We're gonna have a wonderful party.

975
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,240
We will make daddy such a nice cake.

976
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,920
I love you sweetheart.

977
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,440
You are my guy.

978
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:28,160
Mommy. Mommy.

979
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,440
Richard it's me.

980
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,720
I'm early.

981
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,040
What the hell is going on?

982
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,560
Richard.

983
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,400
What are you doing here?

984
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,320
You are early.

985
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,880
What is going on here?

986
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:43,400
-what are you doing?
I had this wonderful idea...

987
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,480
I needed some light.

988
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,120
I needed to let in
some light.

989
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,240
Richard, What are you doing?

990
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,000
I had this fantastic notion.

991
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,840
I took this insanity and riddled it together...

992
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,080
and it'd never occurred to me.

993
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,600
Richard...

994
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:57,880
Don't come near me.

995
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,880
I seemed to me
I needed to let in some light.

996
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,120
What do you think?

997
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,680
I cleared away all the windows.

998
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,600
All right Richard,
do me one simple favor...

999
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:17,120
come, come sit.

1000
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,600
I don't think I can make it to the party.

1001
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,800
you don't have to go to the party.

1002
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:22,160
you don't have to go to the ceremony...

1003
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:23,080
you don't have to do anything
you don't wanna do.

1004
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,840
You can do as you like.

1005
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,560
But I still have to face the hours
don't I...

1006
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,280
I mean the hours after the party

1007
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,480
and the hours after that.

1008
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,160
You do have good days still

1009
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:37,440
you know you do.

1010
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:38,960
Not really.

1011
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,200
Just kind of you to say so but...

1012
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,960
it is not really true.

1013
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,760
Are they here?

1014
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:54,720
Who?

1015
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,400
The voices.

1016
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,880
Oh, if, the voices are always here.

1017
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,160
And it's the voices you're hearing now,
'sn't it?

1018
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:04,120
No, no, no, no...

1019
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,520
Mrs. Dalloway, it is you.

1020
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,120
I'm still alive for you...

1021
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,320
but now you have to let me go.

1022
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:19,640
Richard ...I...

1023
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:20,960
No, wait, wait.

1024
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,880
Tell me the story.

1025
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,320
What about?

1026
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,960
Tell me story from your day

1027
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,520
I... I got up...

1028
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,320
Yes?

1029
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,240
And...I went out and...

1030
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,840
I went to buy flowers...

1031
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,800
like Mrs. Dalloway,
in the book,you know?

1032
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,880
Yes.

1033
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,440
And it was a beautiful morning...

1034
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,520
Was it?

1035
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,440
Yes, it was so beautiful...

1036
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,240
it was so fresh.

1037
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,000
Oh, fresh, was it??

1038
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:56,080
If.

1039
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:02,720
As... how that
tomorrow in the beach?

1040
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:04,440
Oh, if.

1041
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:05,720
How this?

1042
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,080
Yes.

1043
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:08,320
Like the morning on the beach...

1044
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,600
like that morning when you walked out of that house and...
you were eighteen...

1045
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,160
may be I was nineteen.

1046
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,040
Yes.

1047
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,480
I was nineteen years old...

1048
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:24,600
and I had never seen anything so beautiful.

1049
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,240
You, coming out of the glass door early in the morning,
still sleepy.

1050
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,080
Isn't it strange?

1051
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:38,840
Most of an ordinary morning
in anybody's life.

1052
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,440
I'm afraid I cannot make it
to the party Clarissa.

1053
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:45,880
The party...

1054
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,640
doesn't matter.

1055
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:51,760
You have been so good to me,
Mrs. Dalloway.

1056
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,320
I love you.

1057
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:05,160
I don't think that 2 people could have been
happier than we have been.

1058
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:22,640
Happy Birthday.

1059
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,000
Happy Birthday honey.

1060
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,400
This is perfect, this is just perfect.

1061
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:30,480
Do you really think so?

1062
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,560
Sure.

1063
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,840
You must have been working all day.

1064
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:37,880
That's what I've been doing.
working all day.

1065
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,080
This is just fantastic.

1066
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,640
It is what I always wanted.

1067
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:47,040
Oneday Richie, I will tell you...

1068
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,960
I will tell you how it all that happened.

1069
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,960
Don't.

1070
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,280
I want to.

1071
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:52,880
I want to tell him the story.

1072
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,240
What happened?
When I was in the war...

1073
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,240
a war I found myself.

1074
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,680
thinking about this girl
that I had seen.I never met her

1075
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,280
at high school.

1076
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,640
strange, fragile looking girl...

1077
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:12,920
named Laura MacGraw.

1078
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:15,160
And She was shy...

1079
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,640
and she was interesting.

1080
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:21,320
Now, your mother won't mind
if I tell you this, Richie...

1081
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,480
she was the sort of the girl that you see...

1082
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,480
sitting mostly on her own.
And I tell you...

1083
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:26,280
sometimes...

1084
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,080
when I was in the
south pacific...

1085
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,720
the fact is that I used to think about this girl.

1086
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,000
Dan.

1087
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:38,240
I used to think about bringing her to a house...

1088
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,720
to a life...

1089
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,560
pretty much like this.

1090
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:47,720
And what's the thought of the happiness...

1091
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,280
the thought of this woman...

1092
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,800
the thought of this life...

1093
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,200
that's what kept me going.

1094
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,920
I had an idea
of our happiness.

1095
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:27,400
Why does someone have to die?

1096
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,400
Leonard?

1097
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:34,960
In your book, is that someone have to die?

1098
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:36,200
Why?

1099
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,280
Is this a stupid question?

1100
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:42,560
No.

1101
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,640
Let me know if my question is stupid.

1102
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:50,840
Not at all.
-well?

1103
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,960
Someone has to die in order to the rest
should have a life more.

1104
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:01,680
It is a contrast.

1105
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,360
And who will die?

1106
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:06,760
Tell me.

1107
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,160
The poet will die.

1108
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:17,280
The visionary.

1109
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:30,280
What are you doing?

1110
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,400
I am brushing my teeth.

1111
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,280
Are you coming to bed?

1112
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:40,720
Yes, in a minute.

1113
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,720
Coem to bed Laura Brown.

1114
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,800
I remembered Ray, he said...

1115
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,200
Kitty will go to the hospital.

1116
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,280
I know.

1117
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,920
Nothing serious, he said just a check-up...

1118
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:02,400
I am terrified.

1119
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,320
Why?

1120
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:10,320
over the end
she could disappear.

1121
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:14,160
Maybe you can go and see her
in the morning honey.

1122
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,240
I was going to.

1123
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:24,960
I was going to stop-by.

1124
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:27,720
I had a wonderful day...

1125
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:30,960
and I have you to thank.

1126
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,040
come to bed honey.

1127
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:42,320
I'm coming.

1128
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:52,840
Are you coming?

1129
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,400
yes.

1130
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,640
What?

1131
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,800
I thought you were going to bed.

1132
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:21,880
I am...

1133
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:24,960
I am going to bed.

1134
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:32,360
what then?

1135
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,360
My mind isn't clear.

1136
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:39,240
The story has returned to not
to have direction...

1137
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,000
Mrs. Dalloway's destiny
must be resolved.

1138
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:22,880
You are Laura Brown.

1139
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,440
If, I am Richard's mother.

1140
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,560
Of course.

1141
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,400
I am Clarissa Vaughan.

1142
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:37,400
Please come in.

1143
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,840
My friend Sally is in the kitchen...

1144
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:49,960
with my daughter.

1145
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,080
you were having a party.

1146
01:36:56,840 --> 01:36:58,440
We were going to have a party.

1147
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,440
I was lucky I got the last plane
from Toronto.

1148
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,400
so...

1149
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:05,800
that's the monster.

1150
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,840
I wanted to do
the right thing...

1151
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,320
found your number
in his phone book.

1152
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,280
yes, he had it.

1153
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,840
We didn't speak often.

1154
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,800
It is a terrible thing Ms Vaughan...

1155
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,520
to outlive your own family.

1156
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,960
Richard's father died.

1157
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,640
He died of cancer.going young

1158
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,360
Richard's sister is dead.

1159
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:53,400
Obviously he feel
I'm worthy...

1160
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:55,560
cause your feelings of unworthiness.

1161
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,760
you survive and
I don't.

1162
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,680
have you read the poems?

1163
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:14,120
Oh yes... I also read the novel.

1164
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:22,280
You see...

1165
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:26,400
people say that the novel
is difficult.

1166
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,720
I know.

1167
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:31,720
They say that.

1168
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:37,280
I know.

1169
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,120
He had me died in the novel.

1170
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,840
I know why he did that.

1171
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,000
It hurt of course...

1172
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I cannot pretend it didn't hurt..

1173
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,960
but I know why he did it.

1174
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,640
You left Richard...

1175
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,640
when he was a child.

1176
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,960
I left both my children.

1177
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:12,880
I abandoned them.

1178
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,000
They say it is the worst thing a
mother can do.

1179
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:36,080
You have a daughter.

1180
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:39,880
Yes.

1181
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,440
But I never met Julia's father.

1182
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:47,080
You so wanted a child.

1183
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,640
That's right.

1184
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:53,840
You are a lucky woman.

1185
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,600
There are times when you don't belong

1186
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:07,960
and you think you gonna kill yourself.

1187
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,360
Once I went to a hotel...

1188
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,280
later that night I made a plan.

1189
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,960
The plan was
I would leave my family...

1190
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,200
when my second child was born.

1191
01:40:30,520 --> 01:40:31,920
And that's what I did.

1192
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,640
I got up one morning,
made breakfast...

1193
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,640
went to the bus stop
got on the bus.

1194
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,800
I left a note...

1195
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,920
I got a job on library

1196
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:56,080
in Canada.

1197
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:07,760
It would wonderful to say that...

1198
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,520
"I regretted it."

1199
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,880
It would be easy

1200
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:18,960
what would it mean...

1201
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,360
what is it mean to regret...

1202
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,440
when you have no choice

1203
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:38,680
it is what you can bear.

1204
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:48,240
there it is. Noone's going to forgive me.

1205
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,600
It was death...

1206
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:04,240
and I chose life.

1207
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,160
Take your coat off.

1208
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:48,960
I thought you would like
a cup of tea.

1209
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:50,600
Oh my Goodness,
thank you dear.

1210
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:51,560
I feel like I'm stealing your room.

1211
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:54,680
We put the food away...

1212
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:56,200
so if you are hungry at the night.

1213
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:57,200
you can serve yourself what you want.

1214
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,160
Oh, thank you.

1215
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,960
Where will you sleep?

1216
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,080
In the sofa.

1217
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,440
I'm sorry.

1218
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,800
Good night sweetheart.

1219
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Good night.

1220
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:40,880
Dear Leonard...

1221
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,120
to look life in the face...

1222
01:44:44,120 --> 01:44:47,920
always...
to look life in the face...

1223
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:54,040
and to know it...
for what it is...

1224
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:59,240
and at last to know it...

1225
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,640
to love it...
for what it is...

1226
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:08,080
and then...

1227
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:12,160
to put it away.

1228
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:17,880
Leonard...

1229
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:21,280
always the years between us...

1230
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:25,800
always the years...

1231
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:29,440
always...
the love...

1232
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,840
always...

1233
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:35,320
The Hours.
