00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,953

183
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,080
Dog, you ain't never answer

00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,797
So what brings you out here?

188
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,201
Man, shit's all fucked up
in the FP.

189
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,034
We need you, nig!

190
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,371
The FP doesn't need me.

191
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,810
Shit's fucked up
everywhere, man.

192
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,646
The shit you sayir, man?
We need you.

193
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,049
We bros!

194
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,054
FP needs you, TRO.

195
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,819
Yo, we roll together.
We die together!

196
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,361
Damn it, JTRO.

197
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,481
Dayum, you still out here
in the mo suckir 242?

198
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,321
I heard you out here just
sleepir in the dirt, dog.

199
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,793
Just get the fuck out of here
and leave me alone, man.

200
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,488
Man, who the fuck is you?

201
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,293
BTRO would've stood strong.

202
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,301
BTRO wouldn't have let
his FP sink to the dogs.

203
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,496
You don't know shit about BTRO.

204
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,106
What you sayir?

205
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,512
BTRO told me that if anything
ever happened to him

206
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,914
I was supposed to take care
of yo ass.

207
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:56,819
What happened to we roll
together, we die together?! Huh?

208
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:01,484
I know shit got tough, right?
And you just booked.

209
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,993
You know what, man?

210
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,259
Shit did get tough.

211
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,666
BTRO died
in my fucking arms, DC.

212
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,170
I'm not goir back to that shit.
Get the fuck out of my way.

213
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:19,472
Yo, you know what BTRO told me
that night, huh?

214
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,445
Before he rolled up
into that match?

215
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:25,813
He told me he had never been
more proud of anyone

216
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,444
than he was of his lil' bro.

217
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,545
Ever since you was kids,

218
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,989
you ain't never given up
on nothir.

219
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,517
Look at you, man.
You just giving up on him.

220
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:40,359
You giving up on all of us.

221
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,402
Man, you're the only one
who can finish what BTRO started

222
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,404
and save the FP.

223
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,168
Come on, man. We roll together.

224
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,214
We die together.

225
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,086
Yeah, motherfucker!
Get your shit in that car!

226
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,891
Time to get ill, motherfucker!
Yeah!

227
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,891
Jesus.

228
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:43,928
Paragraph.

229
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,462
All right, so check it.

230
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,294
My boy BLT owns this joint.

231
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,632
Him and BTRO used to roll
together back in the old days.

232
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,538
Yo, BLT! Where you at?

233
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,747
Yo, BLT. I finally reeled
JTRO's ass up in this piece.

234
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:14,892
Yo, he's the real deal.
For reals.

235
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,588
Set him up
in the tent out front.

236
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,563
A tent?

237
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:23,123
Yo, yo, yo. You're lucky you
even get a tent, nig.

238
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:26,500
I don't even get a room.
I gots to sleep on the couch.

239
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,095
Why?

240
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,403
'Cause you gotta earn
street cred and shit.

241
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:35,743
Don't you know?
Shit's tough in the FP, bitch.

242
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:40,251
Yeah.
Besides shit's better than dirt.

243
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,253
Fuck this, man!

244
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,620
No, no, no.
Yo, yo. Check it. Yo.

245
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,591
BLT's cool, man.

246
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,752
He's just been going through
a lot of tough shit lately.

247
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,023
We all have.

248
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,031
We need you, dog.

249
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,931
Why? What the fuck
is going on here, man?

250
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,993
Who the fuck is this dude?

251
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,937
Come on, JTRO.

252
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,874
I think there's some shit
you should check a look at.

253
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,622
What is all this?

254
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,648
It's just a basement, nig.
What's the BFD?

255
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,561
Yo, check it.

256
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:31,734
Shit's all fucked up
in the FP, JTRO.

257
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,203
After BTRO got 187'd,

258
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,866
the 248 lost its shit.

259
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,842
The 245 has taken over.

260
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,177
L Dubba E's got even more
street cred now

261
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,216
'cause his pops took a dirt nap,

262
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,411
left him
Dawrs Liquor Mart, son.

263
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,048
So now, no one drinks
unless L Dubba E says so.

264
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:57,390
It's the end of days
out there, JTRO.

265
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,932
The darkness has come.

266
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,163
God damn drunks goir straight
edge right on the street.

267
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,900
Resortir to meth and shit!

268
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:14,104
And now with no drunks
there ain't no bums.

269
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,444
And with no bums
there ain't no motherfuckers

270
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,779
to feed the ducks at the park.

271
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,786
What's a fuckir town
with no ducks, JTRO?

272
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,051
It's nothir! It ain't nothir!

273
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,560
How's a nigga supposed to sort
his shit out without no ducks?

274
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:33,120
We the last of the 248.

275
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,429
We bringir booze back to the
people from the underground.

276
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,765
And we need your help.

277
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:43,739
We can't take out L Dubba E and
his bullshit ass shit alone.

278
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,437
We gots to "Beat-Beat"
this shit right again.

279
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:53,582
BTRO was
on the front lines, JTRO.

280
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,987
Why didn't he ever tell me
about any of this shit?

281
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,589
'Cause he wanted to keep
yo ass safe,

282
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,565
tell you when the time
was right.

283
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,961
BTRO was my best nig, yo.

284
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,770
We had each other's backs,
back to back.

285
00:21:18,844 --> 00:21:22,075
You ain't the
only one who lost BTRO.

286
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,479
We all did.

287
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,910
We all gotta deal with it.

288
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,853
We all is dealir with it.

289
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,069
Man: Get out of here,
you waste of skin!

290
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,445
Stacy: Shut up, Dad!
You're ruining my life!

291
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,177
Stacy's Dad: If that
motherfucker can keep his dick

292
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:08,947
out your box for a few minutes,

293
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,386
get some beer on your way home!

294
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,084
I ain't never coming home!

295
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:23,234
Fuck, fuck.

296
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,101
JTRO?

297
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:32,108
Yo.

298
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,939
Yo.

299
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,280
Stacy, I...

300
00:23:37,382 --> 00:23:39,748
Hole up. I'm not talking to you.

301
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:43,618
I'm mad at you.
You just fuckir disappeared.

302
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,781
You didn't tell no one
where you went.

303
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,587
I thought we were bros?

304
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,719
I'm here now.

305
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:55,165
Fuck.

306
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,996
Yeah you is.

307
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:00,230
I ain't mad at that.
What you been up to?

308
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:03,330
Cutting logs and stuff.

309
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,768
Logs is chill.

310
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:10,782
Yeah. Fuckir awesome.

311
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,954
So how come you never
asked me out?

312
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,423
What?

313
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:24,656
You know, back then.

314
00:24:30,168 --> 00:24:35,299
Well, I...

315
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,672
I guess I thought that

316
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:41,541
you know, since you just sped
through guys so fast back then

317
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,637
I just...

318
00:24:43,715 --> 00:24:46,275
I thought I'd just be another
slash on the list

319
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,818
or something, you know?

320
00:24:49,454 --> 00:24:51,854
You were more than that.

321
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:01,628
Yo, Stacy!
Get in the fuckir truck, bitch!

322
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,691
I gotta bounce.

323
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,971
Move it!

324
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,031
Listen, there's gonna
be an off-the-frizz party

325
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,404
at the foundation tonight.

326
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,206
It's gonna be Cone Zone
as all hell.

327
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:19,409
Maybe, uh, maybe I'll check
a look at you there?

328
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:23,045
You know, just because
you forgot about the FP

329
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,987
don't mean it forgot about you.

330
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,223
Yo, bitch, who the fuck
is that double dragon?

331
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,228
Nobody.

332
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,821
Shit. Looks like a nobody.

333
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,834
You look snap, L Dub.

334
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,199
I know.

335
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,238
And if you play
your cards right,

336
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,034
I'll let you give me a blow job
when we get to the party!

337
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,669
Eat shit, Romeo! Ha ha ha!

338
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,347
Yo, DC. It's JTRO.

339
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,892
Yo, JTRO. It's DC.

340
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,427
You get your shit
straight or what, dog?

341
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:05,758
Yeah. I'm in.

342
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,546
BLT!

343
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,313
Yo.

344
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,122
That's how he rolls, yo.

345
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,392
All mysterious and shit.

346
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,969
Make it!

347
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,259
Stacy, what's going on?

348
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,092
JTRO.

349
00:27:13,164 --> 00:27:15,860
Keepir it O.G.
I aint mad at that.

350
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:21,303
Man, maybe I should call you
SexTRO and shit?

351
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:22,965
I don't know what that means.

352
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,499
- Right?
- Are you drunk?

353
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,704

Oh, my God. Who's shithole

369
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,350

Shit! That's what pussies do.

JTRO... I'm sorry.

375
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,440
Aw. We live together, man,
we die together.

376
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,011
I don't want any trouble.

377
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,445
Yeah? Well now you gots

Where the fuck is he?

390
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,619
Yo, don't do it, man.

391
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,560
He's cruisir all kinds
of heat out in the parking lot.

392
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,496
Come on, nig.

393
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:34,399
Fuck it. Lets see

394
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,465
# Yo, if you could flow as well
as I play "Tick Tack Toe," #

395
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,136
# You'd be my ho, you know? #

396
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,806
Yo, Dubba E!

397
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,780
# Your mom's gotta sack #

398
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,010
# I'm gonna punch that bitch
right in the fuckir back #

399
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,483
Un!

400
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:49,814
Hey, L Dubba E!
I challenge you to a Beat-Off!

401
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,946
Nigga what?

402
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,848
Yo, nigga, I'm ghost riding.

403
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,756
What the fuck just hip hopped

404
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,524
Didrt you get enough of my ass
back in that foundation?

405
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,156
Don't worry about this
motherfuckir conehead.

406
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:05,202
Yeah, shit. Catapult dis bitch
up out my sight.

407
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:06,497
Tell you something, boy.
Maybe you should get your

408
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,629
fuckir ass up out of here.

409
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:11,800
Before you get hurt.

410
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,811
No, no. Time. Time.
I got dirt in my eyes.

411
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,773
I said, I challenge you!

412
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,680
Problem is
I don't "Beat-Beat" bitches.

413
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,548
How'd a pussy bitch like you
ever beat BTRO?

414
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,656
Good God! Dayum!

415
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,520
Say what?

416
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,492
Am I 'bout to bust a fuckir
nut up in this bitch?

417
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,363
A'ight, JTRO and bitch.

418
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,058
If you want to do this legit,

419
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,660
you need street cred before
you deserve to face my ass.

420
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,638
Check yourselves out at the 138.

421
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,902
There's a street match comir up
against The Triple Decka 1 K.

422
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,139
Beat that chump then maybe
we'll talk about a match.

423
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,476
Why won't you just
face me right now?

424
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,015
Politics, bitch!

425
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,813
Yo, let's roll.
Shit just got damp.

426
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,852
I fuckir hate that guy

427
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,655
What you thinkir, dog?

428
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,992
You ain't ready
to drop that fool yet.

429
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,588
I know.

430
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,860
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing, man.

431
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,368
I'm just been making
this shit up as I go.

432
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,702
It can be done.

433
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,606
But I gotta know you're

434
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,276
as serious as a deep throatir
dyke about this shit.

435
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,252
Can yo' ass keep a secret?

436
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,028
You sure you're ready
for this shit?

437
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,970
Yeah.

438
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,967
What it is.

439
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,650
What is this place?

440
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,089
What is it now?
Or what did it used to be?

441
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,956
I don't know.

442
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,552
Well, during the Civil War

443
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,098
it used to be
an underground railroad.

444
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:17,225
Then during prohibition,

445
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,327
motherfuckers used
to run their moonshine

446
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,904
all through this bitch.

447
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:24,669
And now it's 248 HQ,
straight the fuck up!

448
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,108
Hold up.

449
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,591
BTRO... he wasrt the first
one that we lost.

450
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:55,036
But he will be the last.

451
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,936
Come on.

452
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,171
Booze should be a choice,
not a privilege.

453
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:03,111
For the ducks, B.

454
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,954
BTRO's death wasrt
your fault, nig.

455
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:12,319
It was his.

456
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,688
He wasrt expectir
the unexpected.

457
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,022
But it sure as fuck
expected him.

458
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,789
Ya heard?

459
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,058
And now your ass is here

460
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:24,032
so you won't make the same
mistakes as him.

461
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,693
In order to master "Beat-Beat"

462
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,637
you gots to master
the four rules of the B.E.A.T.

463
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:35,710
B... balance.
Not floppy twat legs.

464
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,247
You got to make two legs
count as one.

465
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,851
Balance, bitch. Balance!

466
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:47,721
- E... expeditiousness.
- What?

467
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,885
Speed, bitch!

468
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,002
My legs aren't fast enough.

469
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:07,567
Yeah, they are, bitch!

470
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:09,669
It's your mind that
ain't fast enough.

471
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:12,580
You got to dance with your mind,
not your legs.

472
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:15,413
I need speed, 'TRO.
I need speed, 'TRO.

473
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,511
Where that nigga at?
Move your shit!

474
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:18,782
What you got?
A roll of quarters up your ass?

475
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,016
Motherfucker,
move this motherfucker!

476
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,389
A... Aggression.

477
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,690
If a nig don't got
the fire inside,

478
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,424
he needs to keep pushir.
Once his body's all 187'd,

479
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,295
he's kerplunked.

480
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,706
Suck my corndog, chump!

481
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,142
T... tempo.

482
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,410
Gots to keep your shit straight,

483
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:50,215
all evened out
and dialed in to the end.

484
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:53,382
No matter what slaps
you upside the cocksucka.

485
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:08,830
All right. Let's do it again.

486
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,140
Stacy's Dad: Fuck you, you
little fuckir piece of shit!

487
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,911
Shut up, Dad! God!

488
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,146
I can't fuckir take it anymore.

489
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,915
I'm out!

490
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,617
Go fucking hang out with your
little shit kicking friends.

491
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,286
Baby dumpster! Fuckir whore!

492
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,988
Fuck you!

493
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,503
Sorry you had to hear all that.

494
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,370
Don't worry.

495
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,841
DC and BLT go at it pretty
hardcore sometimes, too.

496
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,434
It's fine.

497
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,004
Yeah. I guess.

498
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,448
I need to get up out of here.

499
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,611
I feel like I'm going insane.

500
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:01,055
Need to get out of
this fucking town. God!

501
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,660
You want to go shopping?

502
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,292
I wanna be up on the stage,
you know? Make some dill.

503
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,892
So what? You wanna be
like a dancer?

504
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,631
Yeah. More or less.

505
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:20,166
Strip. Be all exotic r shit.

506
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,644
You know.

507
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,408
Make a lot of money.

508
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,743
Yeah.

509
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,819
Or maybe become
an astronaut or something.

510
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,820
- Why not?
- What about you?

511
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,981
What are you gonna do
when you bust up outta here?

512
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,217
I'm not really planning
on busting up out of here

513
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,555
- or anything.
- Then what you gonna do?

514
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:40,153
You know, what I should've done
a long time ago.

515
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:43,029
What's that?

516
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,933
- So, I was thinkir.
- Yeah?

517
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,231
Remember the other night...

518
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,273
Oh my God.
I was plastered as all tits.

519
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,604
L... I don't remember nothir
about the other night.

520
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,405
I didn't do anything
off the frill did I?

521
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,845
No. No, you didn't do anything.

522
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,631
It's fuckir game day, dog!

523
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,064
Come on! BLT's at HQ!

524
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:18,795
Yeah, I'll be up there in a sec

525
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,430
Lates, yo.

526
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,565

00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,603
is because shit
became double serious.

706
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,774
We almost lost you, JTRO.

707
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,684
'Cause of that,
we're all going to need gats.

708
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,652
Are we really gonna need gats?

709
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,816
Those 245 bitches is illir.

710
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,620
It's Beat War out there.

711
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,024
Beliee' dat!

712
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:00,824
Shit goes south,
drops like it's hot...

713
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:05,834
This way we can back
the 248 the fuck up. All right?

714
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,695
It's like toothpaste, B.

715
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,330
Just in case.

716
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:16,311
A'ight, lets go back to the
clubhouse, talk some dills.

717
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:21,215
JTRO?

718
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,429
I know how it is, bro.

719
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,874
That bitch can never keep
those titties legit.

720
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:49,878
What a fucking joke!

721
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,346
So where are your friends
anyway?

722
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,385
Down by the riverbed,
chuggir mouthwash

723
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,443
with some of the older boys.

724
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,718
So you building a sand castle
or what you got going on there?

725
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,953
No, I'm looking for a rag.

726
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:07,588
My dad spent all of our money
on booze.

727
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,723
Sometimes you get lucky in here.

728
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,235
Um...

729
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,295
I have one.

730
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:21,376
Oh, my God! Thank you.

731
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:22,912
You need somebody
to walk you home?

732
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,708
No!

733
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:28,473
I'm kidding. Come on.

734
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,254
After he fuckir slipped
turpentine in my drink

735
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:44,732
I woke up the next morning
next to his ass,

736
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:49,670
just figured, what the fuck?

737
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,638
You just figured,
"What the fuck?"

738
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:54,733
That's going to be a rad story
to tell the grandkids.

739
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,176
It's the best I got, JTRO.

740
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,839
You deserve
better than that, Stacy.

741
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,417
I deserve to be a grandma?

742
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,783
No.

743
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,253
Then what?

744
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:09,918
Without L Dubba E
my dad can't get booze.

745
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:13,690
And when he don't gots booze,
he turns to drugs.

746
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,697
I can't see him
like that no more.

747
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,791
I already got enough scars,
OK, JTRO?

748
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:23,829
Stacy, you don't need
L Dubba E to get booze.

749
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,532
I can help you.

750
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:27,041
Stacy's Dad: Stacy,
where the fuck's the beer,

751
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,805
you little whore?
What are you, pregnant again?

752
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,608
No!

753
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,841
I'm fuckir thirsty!
Where the fuck's the beer?

754
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,884
- I gots to go help my dad.
- Yeah.

755
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,217
Fat fucking balls bitch!

756
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,814
And besides, how the fuck am I
supposed to stand up for myself

757
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:46,226
when I ain't got no one
to stand up for me?

758
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,127
Get the fuck in here
and calm your kid down!

759
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,564
I'm coming!

760
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:31,598
You're gettir it now, JTRO

761
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,073
Yeah.

762
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,364
Fuck!

763
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,384
Fuck you! Aah!

764
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,817
- Here you go!
- Whoo!

765
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:46,137
Nobody's ever fuckir beaten
my ass up this mountain.

766
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:48,683
Not even BTRO.

767
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,913
All right. Let's do it again.

768
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,521
Hey, nig.

769
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,930
We doir Spaghetti O waffle
sandwiches in about an hour.

770
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:06,525
You got a big day tomorrow.

771
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,762
Yeah. I'll be in a little bit.

772
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:10,101

773
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,107
Stacy's Dad: You just fuckir
everyone in town, aren't you?

774
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,110
This house is fuckir dry!
You sneakir around my back?

775
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:18,773
Stop it, Dad!
He's been holdir out, I swear!

776
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,218
Stacy's Dad:
... until you fucked it all up!

777
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,845
It's all your fault!

778
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:29,521
- God damn it!
- I hate you!

779
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:30,854
Stacy!

780
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,019
Oh, my God.

781
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,359
Come on. Let's go.

782
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,837
Who the fuck

783
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,634
Dad, stop it.

784
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,370
This is your new Mr. Bitchir?

785
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,739
Hell no! Hell no!

786
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,076
Get this A.D.D. Motherfucker

787
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,979
- Stop it, Dad.
- Listen, dude.

788
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,575
What are you lookir at? Huh?

789
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,176

Guess what? It's go time!

793
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,024
Thats what time it is!

794
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,361
You're an embarrasment

795
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,161
Dad, stop it!

796
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,360
You dumb motherfucker!

797
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:15,165
Ah! Un!

798
00:56:15,238 --> 00:56:17,206
Come on, we're out of here.

799
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:19,002
But my dad...

800
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:23,011
Your dad? Whoever the fuck that is,
you don't deserve this, OK?

801
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,912
Come on, Stacy! Let's go.
Come on.

802
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:29,246
A'ight. Fuck this shithole.

803
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:30,717
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

804
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,186
Should've done that
a long time ago.

805
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,347
- Why didn't you?
- 'Cause he's a bitch!

806
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:34,947
Yeah. What's up, Ma?

807
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,583
Yo, Macy, I came here

808
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,184
Her name's Stacy,

809
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,025

00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:42,291

00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,696

00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,472
He ain't won'th it.
He ain't won'th it, baby.

816
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:56,272
Fuck it! A'ight.
Let's roll, Stacy.

817
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,472
You can come back
and kick it at my crib

818
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,208
if you like sucking dick
this much.

819
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,251
Stacy, what the fuck?

820
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:04,582
JTRO...

821
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,214
Screw this pussy ass fag, man!

822
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:10,748
I'm a hero. I'm a mo suckir
stallion, right?

823
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,796
Yo. What's Lacy doir up

824
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,455
Agreeing with me.

825
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,295
A gentlemen never fucks a bitch
in the ass and tells, woman!

826
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:19,561
It was only for a second.

827
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,002
Shut the fuck up!

828
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,265
Why don't you get in the car

829
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:25,068
and let me talk to JTRO
for a minute.

830
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:26,768
A'ight. Fuck this guy.

831
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,243
Get this fuckir clown
out of my sight.

832
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:31,075
Yo, make it snappy.
I ain't waitir all day, bitch.

833
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:33,741
Gonna have to walk
your dumb ass to my house.

834
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,284
- I want to drive.
- Get the fuck over there.

835
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,252
My daddy paid
for this truck anyway.

836
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,180
Look, JTRO,

837
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,623
I know that you're pissed.

838
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,526
But it's just that...

839
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,597
I can't.

840
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:52,101
I can't leave him.

841
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,430
You don't understand.

842
00:57:53,503 --> 00:57:55,596
It's fine. I get it.

843
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,936
You just figured
"What the fuck?" right?

844
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,305
No.

845
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,868
It's complicated.

846
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,504
I get it.

847
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:09,278
Tomorrow, I'm going to beat
your fuckir boyfriend.

848
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,149
And you two can just go live
happily ever after.

849
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,483
JTRO...

850
00:58:12,555 --> 00:58:14,989
Just leave me
the fuck alone, Stacy.

851
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,396
Come on, bitch!
Get in the fuckir truck!

852
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:29,431
Yo.

853
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,863
Let me guess. You fell, right?

854
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,904
DC told me you was here.

855
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:36,438
So, what?

856
00:59:36,539 --> 00:59:39,804
So homeboy and me are done.

857
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,308
D- u-n.

858
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,606
Yeah. Sure.

859
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,806
It's over, JTRO.

860
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,315
Why you smokir and shit?

861
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,083
You don't do that, JTRO.

862
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:01,654
Well, I just wanted you
to know that...

863
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:04,232
you were right.

864
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,327
L Dub was dip stickir
half the whole town.

865
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,999
Plus, he got me all preg
and shit. But don't worry.

866
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,576
The coat hanger thing fixed
that right the fuck up.

867
01:00:14,644 --> 01:00:15,906
What?

868
01:00:15,979 --> 01:00:19,107
I'm kiddir.

869
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:20,843
Kinda.

870
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,980
I didn't roll out here to...

871
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:28,580
Fuck.

872
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,421
I, uh...

873
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:33,018
I wanted to tell you

874
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:39,796
that you've always been more than
just a slash on my list, yo.

875
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,463
For reals.

876
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,440
I mean, you have always
been there for me, JTRO.

877
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:48,477
And I know I ain't
never been there for you.

878
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:53,277
But... and I know this don't make
up for none of my bullshit.

01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:28,041
Then leave the FP

1063
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,763

I'm Never Ignorant and Getting
Goals Accomplished.

01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,161
Hey, you OK?

1071
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:36,317
You did it, JTRO. You did it.

1072
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:39,286
BLT should be here any second.

1073
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:48,490
Where the fuck is L Dubba E?

1074
01:17:48,563 --> 01:17:50,224
It's over. L Dubba E's gone.

1075
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:52,027
This shit is serious, BLT.

1076
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:54,830
JTRO was all like bop, bop, bop.
Just makir connections.

1077
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,871
Bitch fired off
a few lucky shots.

1078
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,873
But JTRO jumped his ass.
It was like bow to the bridge!

1079
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:02,739
Yo, kick it! Believe that!

1080
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,643
It's over.

1081
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:10,408

1082
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,920
What happens now?
Who gets the liquor mine?

1083
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:18,823
The FP does. The FP gets it.

1084
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:21,920
I've waited so long
for this moment.

1085
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:26,227
I can't believe the war's over.

1086
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,928
What about Sugga Nigga...

1087
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:31,562
And that wiffle bat suckir
bitch Beat Box?

1088
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,540
Bitches in the trunk.

1089
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,837
Serious?

1090
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,176
Shit. Let's go fuck 'em up.

1091
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:41,681
Let's do it.

1092
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,352
JTRO...

1093
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,944
Hey.

1094
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:48,682
We roll together.

1095
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:50,349
We die together.

1096
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:54,862
Yo, check you guys later.

1097
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,228
We got some trash to take out!
Yeah.

1098
01:18:57,299 --> 01:18:59,631
See you around, nig.

1099
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:14,073
Yo.

1100
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:17,277
It's good to check
a look at you again.

1101
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:19,979
For true life.

1102
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:21,385
Yeah. You, too.

1103
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,455
Come on.

1104
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,051
Where we going?

1105
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,564
Come here. Come here.
Put your arm around me.

1106
01:19:30,632 --> 01:19:32,793
I live in a tent and so do you.

1107
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:42,970
Yo, JTRO.

1108
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:44,568
Yo.

1109
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:48,605
Your bro would be proud of you.

1110
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,779
Shit's tough in the FP.
