01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,878
There is the fire.

363
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,632
I first saw it when they drained
your father's neck...

364
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:03,636
in front of you and I saw it
every day with every king...

365
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:08,099
you dragged along the land
to meet his fate.

366
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:11,978
And how does a boy get close
enough to the Emperor...

367
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,980
to avenge his father?

368

A princess sacrifice.

369
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:20,486
Do you really think I would let
you get close to the Emperor?

370
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:26,534
She said you would come for her,
but what I don't understand...

371
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,162
why wasn't it you who brought her here.

372
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:33,124
She showed me something greater.

373
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,834
Well, I'm sorry, my friend...

375

Go in peace.

377
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:56,189
Running won't give me peace.

378

Then what will?

379
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,535

You will suffer a public execution...

a fight to the death and
the fear in your eyes...

when you breathe your last breath...

392
