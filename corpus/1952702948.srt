00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,374
<i>[Woman] More than
three thousand years ago,</i>

2
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,420
<i>a man named Job complained to God
about all his troubles.</i>

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,340
<i>And the Bible tells us
that God answered.</i>

4
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,969
<i>"Do you give the horse his strength?</i>

5
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,597
<i>Or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?</i>

6
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,184
<i>Do you make him leap like a locust,</i>

7
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,145
<i>striking terror with his proud snorting?</i>

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,193
<i>He paws fiercely,
rejoicing in his strength</i>

9
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,445
<i>and charges into the fray.</i>

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,031
<i>He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing.</i>

11
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,284
<i>He does not shy away from the sword.</i>

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,370
<i>The quiver rattles against his side,</i>

13
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,915
<i>along with the flashing spear and lance.</i>

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,668
<i>In frenzied excitement
he eats up the ground.</i>

15
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,839
<i>He cannot stand still
when the trumpet sounds."</i>

16
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,943
[Birds chirping]

17
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,862
[Woman] Kate, Sarah,
you have to leave in ten minutes.

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,699
[Man] Penny, I have three shirts
to pick up at the cleaners,

19
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,202
and two more to go in the hamper,
if you wouldn't mind.

20
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,621
- I'll pick those up.
- Also go by the wine shop,

21
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,833
pick up some Riesling? I have a client
coming in. That's all he drinks.

22
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,459
[Penny] Sarah, orange juice, please.

23
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,754
- No nuclear devices on the table.
- [Boy] Come on, Dad.

24
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,256
[Girl] Daddy, I need
to pick up a gown.

25
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,799
Another gown?

26
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,593
When you earn your own money,
you can buy gowns for every party.

27
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,347
[Penny] I'm sure we can find something
reasonable. We can go look this weekend.

28
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,308
- Not Gewurztraminer, only Riesling.
- Mom, can we have pancakes?

29
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,853
- Working on it.
- [Girl] Che Guevara or Ho Chi Minh?

30
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,398
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for a Christmas pageant.

31
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,025
- A Christmas pageant? When?
- Spring.

32
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,821
It's experimental. Has to do
with Christmas and lots of things.

33
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,574
Really? That's great! What's the role?

34
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,952
- The War Protester.
- I was thinking that we could...

35
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,954
- The what?
- The War Protester.

36
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,330
[Telephone ringing]

37
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,417
It's a really good role, Mom.
You'll love it. You, too, Dad.

38
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:53,505
- Tweedy residence. This is she.
- War protester in a Christmas pageant?

39
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,889
We'll leave this afternoon. Thank you.

40
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,328
[Man] What are you doing? I don't pay
you to dream, I pay you to work.

41
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,873
Now, let's get to it. Come on!
You do that on your own time.

42
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,170
- [Indistinct chatter]
- Thank you.

43
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,504
Oh, Hollis.

44
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,387
Mama's gone.

45
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,808
She's gone. Hi, Jack.

46
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:51,521
Hollis, I'm so sorry for your loss.
Your mother was always so kind to me.

47
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,445
- Miss Chenery, we're sorry.
- Thank you.

48
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,410
- Penny...
- [Penny sighs]

49
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,955
Penny, darling. Darling.

50
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,253
Girls, you remember Miss Ham?
Granddaddy's secretary?

51
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,589
- Hi, Miss Ham.
- Oh, my, you two have grown.

52
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,757
[Laughter]

53
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,593
Thank you so much, Miss Ham.
For everything.

54
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,764
Hollis said you found her.

55
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,726
She had just fallen.
The doctor said she didn't suffer.

56
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:33,855
- She looked... peaceful.
- Hm.

57
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,359
How is Daddy?

58
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,322
He keeps asking, "Where is she?"

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,451
But I'm not sure if he's asking
for your mother or you.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,703
Hmm.

61
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,708
Girls, I'm going to go in
and see your granddaddy now.

62
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,627
I'll bring you in later.

63
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,630
Come on, girls.
Let's get you something to eat.

64
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,135
[Man] Don't let them fool you, darling.

65
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,224
<i>It's not whether they think we won.</i>

66
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,852
It's whether we think we won.

67
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,566
You run your race, Penny.

68
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,110
[Chuckles]

69
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,494
We'll take 'em.

70
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,999
<i>We just got ourselves
a couple new horses.</i>

71
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,043
<i>[Young Penny]
Are we going to race them?</i>

72
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,586
<i>[Man laughs] No.</i>

73
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,839
They're going to be mommies
and daddies for new horses.

74
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,554
Helen?

75
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,892
Daddy, it's Penny.

76
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,103
Penny.

77
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,357
You got married.

78
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,859
Yes.

79
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,739
But I'm here now.

80
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,079
Because Mama's gone.

81
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,135
Mama's pin?

82
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,681
Yours now.

83
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,896
Daddy.

84
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,942
<i>[Man] The Lord shall preserve
thy going out, and thy coming in.</i>

85
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,735
<i>From this time forth...</i>

86
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,571
...and even forever more.

87
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,076
And so we return to You
your faithful servant, Helen Chenery.

88
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,537
Loving mother, devoted wife...

89
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,998
...who lived each moment
to the fullest,

90
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,127
cherishing the life she had
with her beloved husband, Christopher.

91
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,255
And may the peace
that passeth all understanding

92
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,716
be in your hearts now and forever more.

93
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,927
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.

94
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,347
[Thunder rumbles]

95
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:18,270
Eddie? Eddie, I just wanted
to thank you so much for coming.

96
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,859
Miss Penny, your mama was a fine woman.
I just feel real bad for Mr. Chenery.

97
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,069
[Penny] He always thought
the world of you.

98
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,572
He said you could hear the horses'
thoughts through your hands.

99
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,076
Yeah, well, your father's a good man,
Miss Penny.

100
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,202
Thank you.

101
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,623
Mrs. Tweedy?

102
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,293
I'm Arthur Hancock.

103
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,086
- Your daddy called me...
- Bull!

104
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,422
Oh, yes, and everyone else did,
too, as I recall.

105
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,299
This is my son, Seth.

106
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,718
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Thank you for coming.

107
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,388
Your mother was a fine woman.
It was a privilege just knowing her.

108
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,556
Thank you.

109
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,142
I know you're going
to be making some changes,

110
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,271
and if you or your family have any
questions, Miss Ham's got my number.

111
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,564
Thank you, Bull.

112
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,902
Ma'am...

113
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,948
Your daddy's eyes would always light up
when he talked about you.

114
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,578
How smart you are.
How much you loved the horses.

115
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,544
[Thunder rumbles]

116
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,798
<i>[Hollis] Doctor says there
may be some brief moments</i>

117
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,843
<i>when he is aware ofthings,
but we shouldn't expect much.</i>

118
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:35,847
Practical thing would be
to put him in a nursing home.

119
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:41,019
This is home to him.
And he knows he's here.

120
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:45,482
I think as long as he does, we should
hire nurses and let him stay at home.

121
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,861
[Laughs] The farm has to go.
And it won't bring much.

122
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:54,241
It's been losing money
hand over fist for years now.

123
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:58,662
We have to face facts.
To run a horse breeding operation,

124
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,539
you need a certain touch.

125
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,208
I'm a professor, and you're a housewife.

126
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,629
I moved up our flight to first thing
tomorrow. I've got to get back.

127
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,674
Jack, I need a few more days here.

128
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:16,137
I have to make sure Daddy's all right,
sort through Mother's things.

129
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,682
The kids could all do
with a little responsibility.

130
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,225
It will just be a few days.

131
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,521
We need to file right away
for his power of attorney?

132
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,941
Miss Ham says he tried to sell
four of his best horses last month

133
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:33,613
for half ofwhat they're worth. Mom had
to step in and stop him, and now...

134
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,324
I suppose someone will have to
clean up for the liquidation.

135
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,830
Hollis, if you need any help
on the tax issues you call me, anytime.

136
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,375
Thanks, Jack.
It will just be for a few days.

137
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,713
- [Horse whinnies]
- [Children laughing]

138
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,923
Sarah makes great pancakes.

139
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,217
- Oh, no!
- They're toxic. We won't survive.

140
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,927
That's right, you won't.

141
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,555
Make sure Hollis has
that power of attorney order.

142
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,891
- The estate's vulnerable.
- I will. I'll stay on him.

143
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,103
Mom, give Granddaddy a hug for us
when he wakes up.

144
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,023
- I will. I love you!
- [Children] Love you!

145
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,733
- [Children] Bye, Mom!
- Be good!

146
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,859
[Kate] We will!

147
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:31,630
- [Horse neighing]
- Miss Ham. Thank you.

148
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,673
Two sugars and cream?

149
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,883
How did you know?

150
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,136
- It's how your daddy likes it.
- Oh.

151
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,097
You doing all right, honey?

152
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,058
Yes.

153
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,313
No. But I'll be all right.

154
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,944
These two are both pregnant
by Bold Ruler.

155
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,201
And great colts come from great sires.

156
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,288
Miss Ham?

157
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,917
My mother thought the world of you.

158
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:14,047
And my father's trust in you was...
is absolute.

159
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,965
I hope you'll stay.

160
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,678
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing.

161
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,180
[Man] Al! Who the hell told you
to bring this one out?

162
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,683
The sable, put it back.
Bring out the yearling in 18.

163
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,477
- [Al] Yes, sir, Mister Jansen.
- Who are you?

164
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,855
Penny Tweedy.

165
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,067
- Penny Chenery.
- Oh, you're the daughter.

166
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,781
- Better get back to work.
- Excuse me, Mr. Jansen?

167
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,284
Could I talk with you a moment?
In private?

168
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,286
Oh.

169
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,041
- About what?
- I wanted to ask you about that sale

170
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,460
of those broodmares that
my mother stopped a few weeks ago.

171
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,755
I know you and your brother aren't
horse people and you suffered a loss,

172
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,217
but you don't need
to worry about this right now.

173
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,385
Apparently, I do

174
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,555
since they're my father's horses,
and the sale would've been bad business.

175
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,057
It's bad business to come to a barn,
interrupt a trainer's work.

176
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,269
- Not if you want to keep him.
- I understand.

177
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,897
- But about that sale?
- What about it?

178
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,900
They were worth twice
what we were going to sell them for.

179
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,194
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I checked the books

180
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,280
and I made some calls this morning
to be sure.

181
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,367
Like you say, I don't own the horses.
Your father has to sell them.

182
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,745
But as trainer,
you would know their worth

183
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,289
and that they were about to be sold.

184
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:33,126
I'm wondering why it had to be my mother
who stopped the sale and not you.

185
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,962
The old man, your father? Ask him.

186
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,966
I'm asking you! My father's been sick
for quite a long time now.

187
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,885
You've been paid
to look out for his interests.

188
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,180
And I do! Just because this place
is going downhill it ain't my fault.

189
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,267
The sale was going to be
to Oakworth Farms?

190
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:53,021
I learned this morning that the owners
of Oakworth were already talking

191
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,857
about selling our horses for twice
the price they were going to pay us.

192
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,527
- You train for them, too, don't you?
- I don't have an exclusive deal here.

193
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,321
I work for them sometimes. So what?

194
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,072
So if you arranged a deal

195
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,034
that gave them four horses
at half their market value

196
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,579
and they paid you back, plus an extra
share on everything they made,

197
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,665
that wouldn'tjust be disloyal.
That would be committing fraud.

198
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,835
Who the hell do you think you are?
Coming here, accusing me?

199
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,047
Someone who knows enough law
to know she's right.

200
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,760
And I'm not "missy" anything.
Get your things and get off my farm!

201
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,096
I have a contract, and I'll sue you.

202
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,142
If I ever even hear your name again,
I will see that you go to prison!

203
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,147
- [Car engine starts]
- [Tires squealing on gravel]

204
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,859
Where does Bull Hancock eat lunch?

205
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,363
At his club, every day.

206
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,158
But it's gentlemen only.

207
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,292
[Indistinct chatter]

208
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,925
[Woman] Uh, miss?
Uh... Miss, you can't...

209
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,386
I'm sorry, Mr. Hancock.

210
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,430
I told her this was a gentleman's club,
and she just...

211
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,516
It's all right, Brenda. It's all right.

212
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,436
Thank you, Seth.
I apologize for interrupting.

213
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,522
It's fine. I have friends here,
Miss Chenery.

214
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,606
Thank you.

215
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,610
Well, how's it going?

216
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,947
I fired Earl Jansen.

217
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,157
Do tell.

218
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,911
Does that mean you're selling the horses
or keeping them?

219
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,456
The farm's in bad shape, as is Daddy.

220
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,543
But I'm not willing to sell it
unless I get what it's worth.

221
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,882
Well, horse farm needs
a strong hand on the reins,

222
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,511
but the hand that threw Earl Jansen out
the door looks pretty strong to me.

223
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,098
Well, I've got a family back in Denver.

224
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,185
I need a good trainer
just to get things stabilized.

225
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:05,820
You need to talk to Lucien Laurin.
He's a French Canadian.

226
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,489
Dresses like SuperFly.

227
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,909
He's trying to retire.

228
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,995
What do you mean, "trying"?

229
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,624
[Faint indistinct chatter]

230
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,170
[Grunts]

231
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,685
Mr. Laurin?

232
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,732
Excuse me. I'm Penny Chenery,
Chris Chenery's daughter.

233
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,861
And, um, I need a trainer. Bull Hancock
suggested that I find you...

234
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,780
Yeah, Bull called me, but I tell you,

235
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,241
I'm tired of babysitting half-ton
animals who are nearly as stubborn

236
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,535
and stupid as their owners are.

237
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,040
I've lost interest in racing.
Don't even follow it anymore.

238
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,211
Well, I'm in a bit of a tight spot.

239
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,298
I wonder if you mightjust try it

240
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,468
- for a few months and see how...
- I don't need to try anything,

241
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,554
and trainers don't go anywhere
to work for a few months.

242
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,725
- They go where there is a good horse.
- We have plenty of good horses.

243
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,563
No, you don't. You have one or two
that might be worth the time,

244
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,402
but you're a little short on people over
there who know what they're doing.

245
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,780
Well, that's why I've
come to see you, Mr. Laurin.

246
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:34,575
Miss, you're not hearing me. A trainer
makes his living off commissions.

247
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,371
Ten percent off sales,
ten percent offwinners.

248
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,082
To get a top trainer,
you need a top horse.

249
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,627
You're going to have to go back to Bull
and see if he has any other ideas.

250
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,589
Mr. Laurin, two of our mares
are pregnant by Bold Ruler

251
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,842
who is the finest stallion
of his generation.

252
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,427
- Fore!
- [Man] Hey!

253
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,388
- Fore!
- [Man] Watch where you're hitting!

254
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,684
Well, I yelled "fore," you idiot.
That's what "fore" means.

255
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,482
You see how I am, Miss Chenery,
when I put myself

256
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,776
in a position to do something poorly?

257
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:14,282
And I'm afraid at your stable,
I'd be yelling "fore" all day long.

258
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,626
Give my regards to your father.

259
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,356
Fore!

260
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,052
[Whinnies]

261
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,408
<i>- [Jack] When are you coming back?
- [Penny] Soon.</i>

262
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,619
<i>I need to talk to you
about this coin toss thing.</i>

263
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,122
<i>- [Jack] Coin toss?
- [Penny] Jack, listen.</i>

264
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,376
<i>Stallions cost more than mares.
No, they're more glamorous.</i>

265
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,336
<i>But Daddy knew that a great horse</i>

266
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,839
<i>comes just as much
from the mare as the stallion.</i>

267
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,008
<i>He invested in mares,
which is the first smart thing he did.</i>

268
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,138
<i>Second smart thing he did
was he made a deal with Ogden Phipps.</i>

269
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,723
<i>[Jack] Phipps? Richest man in America?</i>

270
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,685
<i>[Penny] Yes.
Instead of paying a stud fee,</i>

271
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,939
<i>Daddy made a deal to breed Phipps'
best stallion with our two best mares.</i>

272
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:14,735
<i>When the mares are close to term, they
toss a coin to see who gets which foal.</i>

273
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,240
That coin toss is in two weeks!

274
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,702
What's the difference? I don't have
any idea which horse to choose.

275
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:27,623
I've been through the stud books, Jack.
Bold Ruler, that's the sire.

276
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,085
He was fast,
but he couldn't last over distances.

277
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,255
Now the two dams are
Hasty Matilda and Somethingroyal.

278
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,633
Hasty Matilda is eight years old.
She's still young.

279
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,179
<i>Since broodmares tend to produce their
best offspring while they're young,</i>

280
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,765
<i>that makes herfoal the obvious choice,
since Somethingroyal's 17.</i>

281
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,602
But her grandsire was Princequillo.

282
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,188
He had great stamina, Jack.

283
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,190
- Penny? Penny!
- Do you know what that means?

284
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,443
<i>- What?
- [Jack] Sire and dam and Sam-l-Am?</i>

285
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,488
What is this?
Come on. We need you here, Penny.

286
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,823
<i>Come home.</i>

287
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,619
Right after the coin toss.

288
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,292
[Line goes dead]

289
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,549
- You about ready?
- We're ready.

290
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,384
- Excuse me just a minute.
- Mmm-hmm

291
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,852
I'll be making the toss.
Are you waiting on anybody else?

292
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,981
- No, I came alone.
- We toss right on the hour.

293
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,317
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

294
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,113
Hi. Good to see you, Mr. Hancock.
How are you?

295
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,740
Hollis. What are you doing here?

296
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,994
I called Jack about our tax issues,
and he told me you fired our trainer.

297
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,455
How do you expect we can
fetch a good price on the farm

298
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,999
ifwe don't have
a training operation in place.

299
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:57,129
He was dishonest. He had to go.
You came down here because of a trainer?

300
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,883
This coin toss is big.
The foal could be worth a great deal.

301
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,551
I checked with some of Phipps' people.

302
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,429
They think he wants
Hasty Matilda's foal.

303
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,973
So that's who we'll choose.

304
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,891
No, Hollis, I think that's wrong.

305
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,603
Somethingroyal's colt could have an
unusual mix of speed and stamina.

306
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,399
Phipps has the best horse people in
the world. You know more than they do?

307
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,193
Come on.

308
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,534
Please don't take offense, Miss Chenery,

309
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,705
but your father almost never
won our coin tosses.

310
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,124
And I do hope you've inherited his luck.

311
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,210
All right. We're all here now.

312
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,755
Mr. Phipps has the call
as the owner of Bold Ruler.

313
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,010
The winner has the choice of the
offspring of Mr. Chenery's mares.

314
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,971
Hasty Matilda or Somethingroyal.

315
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,058
Are we all in agreement here?
All right. Here we go.

316
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,476
- Call.
- [Ogden] Heads.

317
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,364
Heads it is. I'll go with Hasty Matilda.

318
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,369
Miss Chenery.
Please give my best to your father.

319
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,665
Well, that's that.

320
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,167
But I got what I wanted.

321
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:24,467
You got what nobody else wanted.
Time to go home.

322
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,889
Can I give you a lift home?

323
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,807
No, thank you,
I have Daddy's truck here.

324
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,851
- All right.
- Bye, Bull.

325
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,110
So, who won the coin toss?

326
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:47,448
Phipps. He went with Hasty Matilda.

327
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,283
Of course he did.

328
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,871
Call me when
she's ready to drop her foal.

329
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,843

Now the teacher says it's too political
and we can't put it on.

332
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,725
What do you mean you can't?

333
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,144
They have a rule that theater projects
can't be political.

334
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,564
When the teacher saw what we were
doing... Dad, can we, like, sue them?

335
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:25,069
If you didn't disclose until today, they
couldn't be held liable for a breach.

Come on. Good job!

346

Hey, John. How would you like to come
with me and see a horse being born?

347
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,545

- Yeah!

348

She did it 13 times.

352
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,187
You've done it four.

353
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,190
Yes.

This is the Bold Ruler colt, Daddy.

363

We call him Big Red.

364

- [Jack] I know this is hard for you.

367
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,803
How long do you think you can
keep living two lives at once?

368
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,933
The yearlings are looking good,
especially the red one.

369
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,061
We've cut expenses.

370
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,563
We're breaking even.

371
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,778
I thought the point was to sell
the farm, not to break even.

372
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:42,493
[Penny] When I went off to college,
I felt like that colt.

373
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,411
Full of promise.

374
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,207
Full of adventure, like I could...

375
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,127
...make something work.

376
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,797
I gave up a career
to have our family, and...

377
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,218
...this colt is part of our family now.

378
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,887
I just want to see him run.

379
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,265
So after two years

380
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:11,230
...it isn't ending,
it's just... beginning?

381
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:35,921
- [Lucien] How's he feel, Jimmy?
- Just a big kid having fun out there.

382
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,133
He'll figure it out. Huh, Red?

383
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,219
[Lucien] That's good. That's good.

384
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:47,725
Now, listen, don't try
to change his natural gait, OK?

385
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,435
Don't force him.

386
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,319
[Penny] Well, Mr. Laurin,
what do you think?

387
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,448
[Laurin] I think he's 1100 pounds
of baby fat.

388
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,158
He eats too much and too often.

389
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,703
The only reason he doesn't eat more
is because he's too busy sleeping.

390
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:12,708
He only does what he wants to do
exactly when he wants to do it.

391
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:16,837
He lays against the back
of that starting gate

392
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,840
like he's in a hammock in the Caribbean.

393
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,635
And when he finally does
get out of the gate,

394
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,472
it takes him forever to find his stride.

395
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,808
Any other questions?

396
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:33,103
I have one. How much
did you spend on that hat?

397
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,939
Right now this horse
is all sleep and eat.

398
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,109
But he's got fire inside him.
Ain't that right, Red?

399
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,113
That horse couldn't beat a fat man
encased in cement

400
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,824
being drugged backwards
by a freight train.

401
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,410
Well, you should know, Mr. Laurin.

402
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,953
- Mm-hmm.
- [Big Red snorts]

403
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,830
You thought that was funny. I did, too.

404
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,666
I wish we could just race him
under his name. Red.

405
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,461
The Jockey Club insists on unique names.

406
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,797
I keep sending them,
they keep rejecting them.

407

Royal Line, Deo Volente...

Deo Volente. "God willing."

409
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,095
God may have been willing,
but The Jockey Club wasn't.

410
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,434
Well, there is a race up in Aqueduct
in a couple weeks.

411
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,563
I think we should send him out.
It's time. Not that I'm expecting much.

412
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,649
Let's enter him, then.

413
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,318
Deo Volente.

414
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,029
- [Jack] Well, that was really good!
- [Boys] Can we be excused?

415
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,239
Sure.

- Please bring in the dessert.
- OK, Mom.

they want to talk to you about.

to Chile. Just for a couple of months.

cool, you mean? Chile is socialist now.

protest the war did present itself...

No, more like hippies. Free spirits.

431
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,992
Hippies are running
from paying the price of freedom.

432

If there's a price,
how is it freedom, Dad?

433
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,246
I'll answer that question
when you become an adult.

you're finally going to do it.

that you can be over-aggressive.

00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,274
And every owner, every trainer,
every jockey out there

661
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,568
is going to be trying to bring us down.

662
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,697
<i>- I'll be ready.
- Salut.</i>

663
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,871
[Penny] Horse of the Year!
We have to celebrate.

664
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:35,500
Is this the article that's going to be
running across the country?

665
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,502
Did you hear?

666
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,378
It's your daddy, honey.

667
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,798
He's had a stroke.

668
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,428
Let's just go.

669
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:56,354
I don't think there's much left unsaid
between us, Daddy.

670
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,359
I always knew where you stood.

671
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,743
And I'm grateful... so grateful,

672
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,371
for the way you showed me

673
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,832
what it was to stand up
in the world and...

674
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,418
...live the way you believe.

675
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:33,307
The big red colt
won Horse of the Year, Daddy.

676
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,603
I think he can go all the way.

677
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,274
And if he does...

678
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,821
I hope...

679
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,580
I hope you could see it.

680
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,930
[Sobs]

681
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,645
[Door opening]

682
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,822
Jack, what are you doing here?
How did you get here so fast?

683
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,324
I'm so sorry about your father.

684
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,993
I was already on my way.

685
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,830
Already? Are the children all right?

686
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,334
They're fine. I left Denver
before I heard the news.

687
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,712
Hollis had asked me
to study the tax issues

688
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,048
that would arise
upon your father's death.

689
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:51,344
Issues that now
find us totally unprepared.

690
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:54,639
So you've asked my husband
to become your ally in this?

691
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,515
It's family business.

692
00:48:56,683 --> 00:49:01,979
And, last time I checked, Jack and your
children were still part of this family.

693
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,650
Hollis, you're my brother
and I love you,

694
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,486
but if you presume to judge
my fitness as a wife or mother

695
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,613
I will count you a stranger
for the rest of my life.

696
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,698
Penny, Hollis is only
trying to talk sense.

697
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,326
We need to regain some perspective.

698
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,329
- Regain?
- Penny, it's just...

699
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:20,790
Let's not talk about this right now.

700
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,837
No. No, no, no.
She needs to hear this.

701
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,422
She needs to hear what?

702
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,967
At the current value of his estate,

703
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:34,595
the inheritance tax will be
at least six million dollars.

704
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,932
And neither of us
has a fraction of that money.

705
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,978
So we sell the mares and the yearlings.

706
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:46,941
I had an appraisal done, and that won't
get us half ofwhat we need.

707
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,069
But there is another option.

708
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,238
I'm not selling him.

709
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,782
Due to his outstanding
two-year-old season,

710
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:59,787
if he were sold today, Secretariat would
bring a price of seven million dollars.

711
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,248
But if he were to lose
just one of the Triple Crown races

712
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,418
that value would drop to three million
with no way to recover it.

713
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,294
So we sell Secretariat.

714
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,547
- You try and sell him and...
- [Hollis] We're out of time.

715
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,842
Lfwe don't play this right,
it could amount to nothing.

716
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,344
Our father came from nothing.

717
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,055
And his legacy to me isn't money.

718
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,309
It's the will to win! If you can.
And live with it if you can't.

719
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:27,189
If I have to challenge you
in court on this, I will.

720
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:34,530
Miss Ham? Would you come in here
a moment, please?

721
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,328
[Penny] Thank you, Miss Ham.

722
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:45,624
Would you tell Jack and Hollis about
the document that Daddy left for you.

723
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:54,800
Five years ago Mr. Chenery had me
witness him signing a provision that,

724
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,095
while both of you are beneficiaries,

725
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,515
dispersal of the farm
would be left to Hollis.

726
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,143
Decisions regarding the horses
would be left to Penny.

727
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,525
We could argue he already had dementia.

728
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,945
He was of sound mind when he signed it.

729
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,991
I'd swear to it... in court.

730
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,620
Thank you, Miss Ham.

731
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,959
[Hollis] Great.
I teach economics at Harvard,

732
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,171
and I don't know a way
to conjure up six million dollars

733
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,508
before you race him again.
What makes you think you can?

734
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:40,930
I'll find a way.
And if I can't, I'll live with it.

735
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:45,101
Why? Why do you need to live with it?

736
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:50,606
Make me, the whole family,
live with it for a past that is gone!

737
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:55,444
Our father was a great man,
but we can't bring him back.

738
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,363
This isn't about going back.

739
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:01,450
This is about life being ahead of you
and you run at it.

740
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,995
Because you never know how far
you can go unless you run.

741
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,873
That's great.

742
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,587
But if you stumble and fall,

743
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:17,675
you don'tjust make us fools,
you make us beggars.

744
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,553
[Door opens]

745
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,390
When your horse people call the house,
they don't ask for Mrs. Tweedy,

746
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,475
they ask for Miss Chenery.

747
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,146
- Is that who you've become?
- Jack...

748
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:35,985
...Miss Chenery and Mrs. Tweedy
have always been the same person.

749
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,698
I'm wondering how it is that Mr. Tweedy
could take sides against me.

750
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,583
[Door closes]

751
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,049
Trying to muscle me into something.
Can't do that.

752
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,802
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Hi, ma'am.

753
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,850
How are you, Big Red?

754
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,520
- How's it going?
- [Eddie] Ma'am...

755
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,857
I reckon you heard about
Bull Hancock, ma'am?

756
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,484
No.

757
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,530
Well...

758
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:29,205
After your daddy's funeral, they say
he went home and just fell dead.

759
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,793
[Sighs] Oh.

760
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,051
I don't know
about the ways of God, ma'am,

761
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:46,889
but... I know your daddy
and Mr. Bull lifted each other up.

762
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,893
The way you lift me up
and the way you lift up Red.

763
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,895
Everything living lives from its heart,

764
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,898
and I wish I can give you something
to lift yours up.

765
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,695
Well, thank you, Eddie. You just did.

766
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,332
What does he see?

767
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:19,004
When he looks at me,
I feel like he looks right into me.

768
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,301
He sees what matters to him, ma'am.
What's immediate.

769
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:28,597
The clouds and stuff,
they don't mean nothing to a horse.

770
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:32,601
Lights, sounds, flashes... Intentions!

771
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,271
That's what a horse notices.

772
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,690
Especially one as smart as Big Red here.

773
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:41,402
And they can tell when the horse
next to them or behind them

774
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:45,114
wants to be first to the food.
Or the mare.

775
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,283
Or the finish line.

776
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,911
That's what matters to them.

777
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,205
Ain't that right?

778
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,883
It's never been done.
But that doesn't mean it won't work.

779
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:09,763
We offer 32 shareholders
exclusive breeding rights.

780
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,766
We call it "a select opportunity."

781
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,312
Father would've loved that phrase.
How much per?

782
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,897
190,000.

783
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,735
A hundred and ninety?

784
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,321
Mm-hmm.

785
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:28,991
That's more than anybody's ever paid
for a breeding share. Lot more.

786
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:34,163
That's what makes it exciting, Seth.
Horseracing's all about excitement.

787
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:42,421
He's been a great colt, but he's
completely untried as a three-year-old.

788
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,925
And the sons of Bold Ruler, they're long
on speed, but short on stamina.

789
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:50,179
Yeah, and his mother was old when she
had him and Ogden Phipps knew all that

790
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,222
when he could have chosen my colt.

791
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:55,726
But he didn't.
And now I've got Secretariat.

792
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,645
And he's got a horse
named Missed Opportunity.

793
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,023
Daddy used to always say
that rich people are rich

794
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,983
because they're smart with their money.

795
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,444
And they're going to insist
on a performance clause.

796
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:10,199
No son of Bold Ruler has ever won
a single Triple Crown race.

797
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,576
That's a mile-and-a-half distance

798
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,495
that Secretariat's never
come close to running.

799
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,040
You're going to lose the farm
and the horse, everything.

800
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,250
[Horse whinnies]

801
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,129
[Seth] This is a big deal. I have
never done anything like this before.

802
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,881
Nobody has.

803
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,470
- You mind if I ask why you called me?
- Well...

804
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,933
Your father, he really helped me and...

805
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,894
...and work is good for grief.

806
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,066
I'm in.

807
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,071
Howard Keck on line one,
Bunker Hunt on line two.

808
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,824
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines!

809
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,117
[Clears throat]

810
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,495
- Mr. Hunt? Penny Chenery.
- Mr. Keck, Seth Hancock.

811
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,956
I was calling about
a select opportunity on Secretariat.

812
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,834
<i>[Laughs] No, sir, he's not for sale.</i>

813
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:06,046
<i>No, we are moving
to syndicate his breeding rights.</i>

814
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,340
It's a select opportunity.
We have 32 shares...

815
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:11,135
<i>Yes, sir. It's a great opportunity.</i>

816
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,263
I will head that way. I'll see you
in a bit. All right, bye-bye.

817
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,640
[Mr. Keck] Look, Seth, I've been
a part of lots of these deals,

818
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:20,227
but I've never been asked to pay
190 grand for a breeding share.

819
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,728
Nobody has.

820
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,441
Tell Mr. Chenery's little girl
that she's priced this colt

821
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,484
like he's already won the Triple Crown.

822
00:57:27,569 --> 00:57:32,698
I'm calling on behalf of Penny Chenery.
We will call him back later. Thank you.

823
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,785
[Growls] Dr. Todd, please.
It's Elizabeth Ham.

824
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,455
<i>[Penny] No disrespect, sir,

[Seth] Yes, Mr. Cleaver, it's lots of
money. But my father used to tell me

829

you got to spend money to make it.

830
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,634
[Mr. Cleaver] I'll put some thought
into it, all righty.

Of course, I understand, Mr. Mellon.

Yes, ma'am. Just getting a bite to eat

Hello, Mr. Phipps,

849
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,664
- Thank you for coming.
- Miss Tweedy. My pleasure.

850
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,333
- You know Ronnie Turcotte, my rider?
- Ronnie.

851
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,168
So, they call you "Tiny"?

852
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,422
- What?
- [Laughs] Mr. Phipps...

853
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,887
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

854
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:09,558
Are we ready yet?

855
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,476
We're still thinking about it.

856
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,480
If I smell the air correctly,
Mrs. Tweedy,

857
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:18,150
you're about to ask me
to spend a small fortune

858
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,778
to buy a share in a horse
I could've owned for nothing.

859
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,740
That's true, I am.

860
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,159
Nobody's buying yet, are they?

861
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,746
That's right. They need
someone to lead them.

862
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,792
You know that horse I chose
the day we flipped the coin?

863
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,712
She's the prettiest,
best-tempered horse in my whole stable.

864
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,882
And she couldn't outrun my accountants.

865
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:45,510
So now you've got the Horse of the Year,
and I look foolish.

866
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:49,181
It's not foolish
to be unlucky, Mr. Phipps.

867
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,726
Most men, if they had chosen wrong
and lost this horse

868
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,645
wouldn't think of investing in him
again, but you're bigger than that.

869
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,773
And if you do invest in him

870
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,776
instead of being the man who lost
Secretariat in the past,

871
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,488
you'll be the one who had the vision
to lead investors in his future.

872
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:10,118
His future is uncertain. And I don't buy
shares in untested three-year-olds.

873
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,038
But my accountants,

874
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:16,166
they may be slow afoot,
but they are quick to calculate

875
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,752
and they tell me
that you're in a rough spot.

876
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:21,546
So I'll buy
that horse of yours right now.

877
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:24,216
Seven million dollars. All cash.

878
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:30,514
I can't do that.

879
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:35,602
If he does what I think he'll do,
his value will double, if not triple.

880
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,691
You do know what you're saying.

881
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,736
You're guaranteeing that this horse
is going to win the Triple Crown.

882
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:47,948
The Derby, the Preakness
and the Belmont.

883
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:51,660
Three races, three states
in just five weeks.

884
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,746
Hasn't been done in 25 years.

885
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,958
There are a lot of good horsemen
think it can't be done anymore.

886
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,211
Just understand,
this is what you're saying.

887
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,338
That is exactly what I'm saying.

888
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,096
Eight million.

889
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,350
No.

890
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,729
You're that stubborn?

891
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,940
I'm that right.

892
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,902
Have we made up our mind yet?

893
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,281
Yes, I think we have.

OK, so he's saying that I'm incompetent.
He never shuts up.

to pick at his own butt.

- Step out here with me.
- He could not train...

Is it really true Ogden Phipps
offered you eight million dollars?

919
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:19,975
It's true. He wouldn't
have made that offer

920
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,686
unless he thought Secretariat
would be worth twice that.

921

01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,656
- God.
- What's he doing?

988
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,075
<i>Angle Light in front.
Sham on the outside.</i>

989
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:50,536
<i>Sham and Angle Light driving
to the wire! Secretariat fading!</i>

990
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:53,373
- No!
- Go! Go!

991
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:57,126
<i>It's Angle Light and Sham!
Angle Light and Sham at the wire!</i>

992
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:00,421
<i>Secretariat a stunning
and distant third!</i>

993
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:04,342
[Shouts] All right, Sham! Way to go!

994
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,511
[Exhales heavily]

995
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:15,103
You know I speak for everyone. One loss
can happen. Two is non-performance.

996
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:18,815
- I understand.
- I'm sure you do.

997
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:22,360
Another son of Bold Ruler,
all speed and no distance.

998
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:27,073
- [All clamoring]
- Magnificent! Magnificent!

999
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,534
Next time we'll bury him even worse!

1000
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:34,372
You cost me ten grand, Turcotte!
Hey, loser!

1001
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:38,584
Who are you calling a loser?
Think you can do any better?

1002
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,295
- Eddie!
- [Lucien] Ronnie. Ronnie!

1003
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:43,089
- What was that?
- He didn't fire. He didn't sound right.

1004
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:44,924
- What do you mean?
- In his other races

1005
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,803
- he sounded like a freight train.
- Come with me. Just go inside.

1006
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,388
Sit!

1007
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,143
We just lost a race
that we could not afford to lose!

1008
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,521
We finished third. Third!
In front of Ogden Phipps!

1009
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:01,691
I've got a slew of other investors here.
What am I supposed to tell them?

1010
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:06,487
Just tell them the truth.
The horse had a bad day.

1011
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,241
The horse? We're blaming the horse now?

1012
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:15,038
And you? How could you hold him back
that long? What were you thinking?

1013
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:17,915
I didn't hold him back.
I rode him the same way I always do.

1014
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,585
The only reason Sham didn't
beat us worse is because

1015
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:24,130
his jockey couldn't believe what
was happening! He was waiting for you.

1016
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:29,552
The only reason I don't fire you both
is we're leaving for Kentucky tomorrow.

1017
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,304
Do what you think is right, ma'am.

1018
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:35,099
It's not Ronnie's fault.
He had him where he should be.

1019
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:37,935
Well, if it's not the horse
and it's not Ronnie

1020
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,021
then you had better figure out
what happened today

1021
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:42,023
and you had better fix it!

1022
01:12:42,107 --> 01:12:46,569
Because if that is the best he can do
at this distance, we are finished!

1023
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:55,995
[Exhales]

1024
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,964
[Speaks French]

1025

[Thunder rumbles]

1026
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,121
- Has he eaten anything?
- Nothing.

1027
01:13:38,205 --> 01:13:41,457
And this a horse that's
never missed a meal in his life.

1028
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,253
- How much oats you usually give him?
- Sixteen quarts.

1029
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:48,089
- Twenty-five pounds of hay.
- A day?

1030
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:52,760
That's more than a couple
of pregnant mares would put away.

1031
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,303
Yeah, well...

1032
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:58,558
OK, now. Easy.
I'm not going to hurt you.

1033
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:01,185
I don't think he the one
going to get hurt, Doc.

1034
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,771
- [Snorts]
- Settle down.

1035
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,731
Lucien, you want to give me a hand here?

1036
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,443
- No, thanks.
- You scared of him?

1037
01:14:08,527 --> 01:14:13,406
This horse has been waiting two years
for me to put a hand next to his mouth.

1038
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:14,782
I'm not going to do that.

1039
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:17,577
- [Snorts]
- Ooh.

1040
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,163
I think I got your problem here, Lucien.

1041
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:24,125
He's got an abscess.

1042
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:41,058
- [Rock music playing]
- [Telephone rings]

1043
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:49,442
Hello?

1044
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:51,986
I'm calling for Kate Tweedy, please?
It's her mother.

1045
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,405
<i>[Man] Kate! Your mother's on the phone.</i>

1046
01:14:57,075 --> 01:14:58,075
Mom!

1047
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:03,748
Oh, I... I just wanted
to see how you're doing.

1048
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:08,503
Uh... Hey, I'm kind of busy right now.
We're getting ready for a march.

1049
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:13,674
<i>Mom? Are you OK with that?</i>

1050
01:15:14,134 --> 01:15:15,426
Oh...

1051
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:18,012
Kate...

1052
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:20,765
...our political beliefs can change,

1053
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,810
but our need to do
what we believe is right...

1054
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:27,396
<i>... that doesn't.</i>

1055
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:31,400
I'm proud of you.

1056
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,570
Thanks, Mom.
Hey, I got to go. Can we talk later?

1057
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,155
Sure.

1058
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,536
<i>- Are you all right?
- Sure. Yeah, we'll talk later.</i>

1059
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,788
OK. Bye.

1060
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:56,676
[Sobs]

1061
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:03,349
Doc found a big abscess in Red's lip.

1062
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:05,393
It probably hurt him
all the way around the track.

1063
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:08,854
Ain't nobody seen it because Red won't
soften up his mouth for nobody but you.

1064
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:12,108
- Oh... Lucien...
- Forget it.

1065
01:16:12,192 --> 01:16:14,235
Let's get him ready for the Derby.

1066
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,508
[Penny] Ronnie!

1067
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:43,347
I am so sorry.

1068
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:47,685
I didn't know what happened before.
Apparently...

1069
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,771
[indistinct chattering]

1070
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:00,072
<i>[Male announcer] In preparation for

<i>please welcome Secretariat!</i>

1072
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,077
- [Crowd cheering]
- [Woman] We love you, Big Red!

1073
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:08,247
- Story's over here.
- Do you think Secretariat is ready?

1074
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:09,290
We're very excited.

1075
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:11,751
- Is Secretariat ready for this race?
- Yes, indeed.

1076
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:17,882
Listen, we'll take care of the horse,
you take care of the reporters.

1077
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,759
I don't know what to say.

1078
01:17:19,843 --> 01:17:22,720
You're as big a story as the horse, OK.

1079
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,805
If you want him fit,
you take care of them.

1080
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:28,601
- Welcome to the Derby.
- Thank you.

1081
01:17:29,269 --> 01:17:32,104
So that's Pancho
over there with Sham, right?

1082
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,439
Sure is.

1083
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:36,942
Can't wait till you win this Derby,
so we can go home.

1084

[Whistles]

1085
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,175
I keep hearing rumors.

1086
01:18:01,259 --> 01:18:05,096
Secretariat's got bone chips,
bad ankles, bad knees.

1087
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:08,599
Sham's burning up the track
and Secretariat has gone missing.

1088
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,560
- So is his owner.
- She'll be at the press conference.

1089
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,230
The only thing she hates worse than
talking about herself is backing down.

1090
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,525
[Indistinct chatter]

1091
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,694
[Man] I can't wait much longer.

1092
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:26,617
All right, gentlemen,
I guess we're going to get started.

1093
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,828
Let's open it up for questions.

1094
01:18:29,037 --> 01:18:30,746
[All clamoring]

1095
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:33,249
Pancho, is it true you're predicting
Sham's victory?

1096
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:35,835
Lucien, there are rumors
your horse is hurt. Any comment?

1097
01:18:35,919 --> 01:18:38,045
Pancho, how are you feeling
about Sham's readiness?

1098
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,799
Fantastic! You've all seen his workouts.
He's never looked better.

1099
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:44,969
[All murmuring]

1100
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,974
Penny, Sham's turning in
awesome workouts.

1101
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,893
- When will you work Secretariat?
- Soon.

1102
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:56,313
Any concern Secretariat will run
the same way he did his last race?

1103
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,899
- Yes.
- [Laughter]

1104
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,736
Pancho, some people think Secretariat
didn't appear to be himself

1105
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:04,196
- in Wood Memorial.
- "Didn't appear to be himself?"

1106
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,075
Is thatjournalism-ese
for getting your butt whipped?

[Crowd laughs]

1108
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:15,958
[Pancho] Horseracing is unforgiving
for trainers, horses and housewives.

1109
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:18,461
- [Crowd groans]
- [Pancho] Let me tell you

1110

what you're going to hear
from the Secretariat people.

1111
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:23,424
Excuses, excuses, excuses!

1112
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:26,010
[Pancho] Let me tell you what
you're going to hear from me.

1113
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:30,014
We beat Big Red at the Wood, and
we're going to beat him here again.

1114
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:31,849
Any comment, Miss Tweedy?

1115
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:37,313
How much pressure are you feeling
from your investors right now?

1116
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:40,024
Well, it's like every other
all-or-nothing,

1117
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:43,360
multimillion-dollar gamble
we housewives make every day.

[Crowd laughs]

1119
01:19:45,697 --> 01:19:49,200
Miss Tweedy didn't hear me,
so I'm going to make it very clear.

1120
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,077
Secretariat is going down.

1121
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:56,624
- I guarantee it!
- [Crowd murmuring]

1122
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:58,542
Pancho's starting to brag like a boxer.

1123
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:01,837
Maybe he plans on
taking up prizefighting

1124
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:03,255
after he finishes horseracing.

1125
01:20:05,842 --> 01:20:08,761
Sham has about as much chance
of beating Secretariat

1126
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:11,388
as Pancho has of beating Muhammad Ali.

1127
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,224
[Crowd laughs]

1128
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:17,895
[Eddie] I know it hurt,
but I got to do it, Red.

01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,605
How's it look?

1130
01:20:19,689 --> 01:20:22,733
Same. Still ain't ate.

1131
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:28,280
I'm going to have Ronnie
take him out in the morning.

1132
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:32,034
See how it goes.

1133
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,054
It's nothing like Sham's been running.

1134
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:56,016
Nothing like Secretariat's been running.
Penny's not talking.

1135
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:03,148
- Eddie?
- No, ma'am. He's still off his feed.

1136
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:10,865
Miss Tweedy? Miss Tweedy?
How's your horse doing?

1137
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,284
He'll answer that question for himself
on race day.

1138
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,829
- You're Bill... Nack, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

1139
01:21:16,913 --> 01:21:19,665
I've read you. You write like a poet.
Why do you do this?

1140
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:21,834
For years they had me
covering politicians.

1141
01:21:21,918 --> 01:21:23,836
I wanted to write about
the other end of the horse.

1142
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:25,838
Why do you do this, Miss Penny?

1143
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,340
I'm his voice.

[Stopwatch ticking]

1145
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:58,913
Penny, we think the abscess is gone,
but he still hasn't eaten

1146
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:01,707
and Ronnie says
his breathing is still a little shallow.

1147
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:05,127
I don't know.
I don't know ifwe should run him.

1148
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,298

My instinct is to train him.
Hard. To stoke that fire.

1311
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:45,280
But if I'm wrong, then they will say

1312
01:35:45,364 --> 01:35:49,576

horse's chances at the Triple Crown...

1313

...they may say we ruined the horse.

1314

ifwe push him instead of rest him...

1316

1321

[Man] Mr. Martin! Secretariat has beaten
your horse twice.

1322
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,276
What makes this race different?

1323
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:28,782
Any good horseman will tell you
that Secretariat is built for speed

1324
01:36:28,866 --> 01:36:31,117
and Sham is built for distance.

1325
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,870
But, of course, uh,
Miss Tweedy believes that her horse

1326
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:36,790
has somehow magically inherited both.

1327
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:39,292
I believe that this race
is going to prove

1328
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:42,837
that her woman's intuition
will only take her so far.

1329

Secretariat's getting?

- Well...

1331
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:53,306
Let me tell you something about
all this talk about "super-horse."

1332
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:55,850
Sham broke the Derby record, too.

1333
01:36:55,935 --> 01:37:00,897
He ran the second-fastest Derby. He ran
the second-fastest Preakness... ever.

1334
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:04,651
We were right there with the red horse
every step of the way.

1335
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:08,863
And now we're getting ready to run
the longest of the Triple Crown races.

1336
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:11,866
When we're done,
you'll be calling Sham the super-horse!

1337

Any comment, Penny?

1338
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,371
Well, I'd have to say
I agree completely with Mr. Martin.

1339
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:19,290
His horse did run
the second-fastest ever.

Lucien will do anything to prove he's
not a loser. That's where they're weak.

1345
01:37:39,895 --> 01:37:42,272
We rest our horse, they push theirs.

1346
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,983
On race day, we push him even harder.
We push him until he comes apart!

1:12 and a fifth.

a mile next time out?

I brought you a little something
from a mutual friend of ours.

I offered to give it back to Seth,
but he too thought you should have it.

You're the best owner I ever saw.

1371

Turcotte and Edward say he's
the smartest horse they've ever seen.

1372
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:49,065
Maybe. I've trained horses
my whole life.

1373
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:53,236
I still don't have the slightest idea
what they know and what they don't know.

1374
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:58,658
Three years ago I would've said that a
racehorse didn't care who his owner was.

1375
01:39:58,742 --> 01:40:00,576
But then he's not a racehorse.

1376

He's Secretariat.

1377

he'll be wearing wings.
