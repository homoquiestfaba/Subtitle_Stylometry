1
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:44,746
Chris.

2
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,459
Chris!

3
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,029
I know.

4
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,362
Move it!

5
00:01:20,648 --> 00:01:22,951
-You're going to be late.
-I'm never late.

6
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:26,020
-I hope you get a time out.
-I hope you get cooties.

7
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:27,789
Mom!

8
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:30,525
Be careful on that bike.
You don't need another ticket.

9
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,927
Slow down.
Chris, don't speed.

10
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,697
Don't worry.
There's no need.

11
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:44,498
Mr. Torres.

12
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,370
Mr. Torres?

13
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:51,673
Chris!

14
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,610
Sorry.

15
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:58,278
You said if we finished
early, we could take a rest.

16
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,214
Yeah, you were about to snore
the ceiling tiles out.

17
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,316
Sorry, Miss Santoro,

18
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,888
but the differential equations
really took it out of me.

19
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:11,592
Look, the math may come
easy to you, Mr. Torres,

20
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,928
but respect for the class
is still part of your grade.

21
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:22,637
Sorry, gotta get to practice.

22
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:49,463
-Think you'll make captain?
-I hope not.

23
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:51,532
I just wanna wrestle.
That's where I do my best work.

24
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,134
I'd have to agree with that.

25
00:03:53,167 --> 00:03:55,503
Smooth move, Romeo.

26
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:09,217
I'd be jealous,
but I've gotten used to being
the second love of your life.

27
00:04:11,686 --> 00:04:13,121
What do you think?

28
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,189
You're the best
and everyone knows it.

29
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,924
Just as long as you know it.

30
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,194
Practice in five
if you can make it.

31
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,532
You heard him, Romeo.
Better get a move on

32
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,366
if you wanna stay
in Kelvin's good graces.

33
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,204
-Hey, he needs me.
-Lucky him.

34
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:32,874
-See you after practice?
-Nah, I gotta fly.

35
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,243
Okay, well then I'll see you
tomorrow, Romeo.

36
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,741
Hey, that's what
I'm talking about.

37
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:10,044
Well, well. Torres!

38
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:12,747
Gracing us
with your presence this year?

39
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,683
What? Coach, you know
my moves are the only thing

40
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,484
keeping the fans awake
out there, right?

41
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,521
Only because they want to be
watching when you eat mat.

42
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:25,059
We've got a small team
this year, some newbies.

43
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:28,229
I need you to step up,
set an example.

44
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,897
Think you're up to that?

45
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:31,566
Easy to do when all eyes
are on me, Coach.

46
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:32,834
Is that a yes?

47
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,169
-Sure.
-Good.

48
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,305
Circle up.

49
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:41,676
Take a knee.

50
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,614
Listen up.

51
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,716
Welcome
to First Flight Wrestling.

52
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:54,487
Here's the thing,
we're a really small team
this year,

53
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:59,126
so everybody is going to be
a starter, even the new guys.

54
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,897
But if you're serious
and you practice hard,

55
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,066
we can form up
and have a great year.

56
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,969
-That's right, Coach.
-Yes, sir.

57
00:06:08,002 --> 00:06:09,837
We're counting on each other.

58
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:13,007
So focus,
learn from each other,

59
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,208
work together.

60
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:18,779
From what I've seen so far,
the Nighthawks
have a good chance

61
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,148
to make a run for the Team
State Championship,

62
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,650
so let's get it done.

63
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,852
- Yes, Coach.
- All right.

64
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:28,756
Now, captains this year
are going to be our
returning seniors,

65
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,591
Zelinski and Torres.

66
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:34,128
Torres just got out
of cross country,
so he's gonna lead running.

67
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,297
Zelinski, I want you
to lead warmups on the mat.

68
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,032
Got it.

69
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:42,303
Good news is we've got
a heavyweight this year.

70
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,506
Zachary, you're a rare breed
out here, kid.

71
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:51,545
We're also honored to have
our first female wrestler
on the team, Carla.

72
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,548
Not only is she good,

73
00:06:54,582 --> 00:06:58,286
but she is just like
every other wrestler
on this team.

74
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,454
You will treat her
with respect.

75
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,225
If you can't handle that,
get your jumped-up macho crap

76
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,627
outta my gym,
and off of my team,
you understand?

77
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:08,629
- Yes, Coach.
- No problem, Coach.

78
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:14,302
Good. Let's get warmed up.
Run first, then practice.

79
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,671
Chris, I want you to take them
to the monument and back.

80
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,639
Okay? Keep it brisk,
stay together.

81
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,911
This is day one
of our championship season.

82
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:25,913
- Let's go!
- Yes, Coach.

83
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:31,719
Coach, can I talk
to you for a second?

84
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,855
What is it, Torres?
You're supposed to be
leading the run.

85
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,390
I didn't want to be
team Captain.

86
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:40,661
I didn't wanna be
so dang handsome,
but here we are.

87
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,264
-Yeah, but--
-Look,

88
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,232
I asked you if you wanted
to step up and set an example.

89
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,734
You said yes.

90
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,202
Yeah, I wanna do more
with wrestling.

91
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,871
-I didn't want to babysit.
-Babysit?

92
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:53,674
You think what I'm doing
up here is babysitting?

93
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:57,578
You think I'm up here,
what, wiping backsides,
kissing boo-boos?

94
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,716
I coach a team.
A team needs captains.

95
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,885
You've been talking Navy
since you wandered
through my door.

96
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,287
You think
you're gonna make it

97
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,488
with fancy moves
and a pretty boy smile?

98
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,893
Hell no.
You gotta work for it.

99
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,096
You gotta show for it.

100
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,765
Most important,
you gotta prove it.

101
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,267
Do you think
you can prove it, Torres?

102
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:23,437
Do you actually think
I have a pretty smile?

103
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:27,074
Son, you better
start jogging.

104
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,918
Kid, you ain't paying me
to listen to you whine.

105
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,154
-I'm your flight instructor,
not your therapist.
-Sorry, Paul.

106
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,289
I don't want to hear you
apologizing either.

107
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:45,393
Sitting over here
sounding like a living,
breathing country song.

108
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,463
-Which one's Marcus?
-What?

109
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:51,966
Your problem of the week,
Marcus. Which one is he?

110
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:56,270
We've been rivals
since freshman year.

111
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,973
He's bigger than I am,
meaner.

112
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:01,008
He calls himself
The Red Menace.

113
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:03,577
That's stupid.

114
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,846
You can't give yourself
a nickname.

115
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,682
Has to be given to you.
You think if I had
any choice about it,

116
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:11,318
-I'd be call sign Digger?
-Why were you called Digger?

117
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:16,957
Eh, I was constantly
on report during training.

118
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,160
Had me digging
ditches all the time.

119
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:22,096
Had my head in the ground
so often they started
calling me Digger.

120
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,765
-Sounds awful.
-Better than Blockhead.

121
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,169
There's a Blockhead?
How'd he get that name?

122
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:31,205
'Cause he asked a lot
of stupid questions.

123
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,373
Get it, kid?

124
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,011
You don't get
that kind of name by being
the smartest kid on the block.

125
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:39,713
Looks like your hour's up.

126
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:42,349
What say we shoot
the canals on the way
back to the airport, huh?

127
00:09:42,383 --> 00:09:45,386
-I'm game if you are.
-Yippee ki-yay, my friend.

128
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:58,966
So what is
a team captain anyway?

129
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,401
It's a babysitting position.

130
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,204
Why do they need
a babysitter at school?

131
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,073
Not at school,
at practice and matches.

132
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:08,209
Someone has to show them
how to do it right.

133
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,411
-And they picked you?
-And you pick your nose.

134
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,912
I'm telling Mom.

135
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,781
You're telling Mom
that you pick your nose?

136
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,884
Mom, Chris just said
that I was going to tell you

137
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,319
that I pick my nose.

138
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,388
-And you just did.
-That's not funny.

139
00:10:21,422 --> 00:10:23,324
Oh, man.

140
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:27,828
So congratulations
on making team captain.

141
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,897
Everyone keeps saying that.

142
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,567
I learned
this cool new Russian move.
I just wanna wrestle.

143
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:34,603
You'll have plenty
of time to do that.

144
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,071
A little responsibility
never hurt anybody.

145
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:40,241
And I'm sure it had
something to do with this.

146
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:56,924
"Dear Chris Torres,

147
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,960
We have received
your application
to the US Naval Academy.

148
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:01,596
The following items
are complete:

149
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,430
transcript to include
the chemistry, physics,

150
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:05,799
and calculus,
standardized test scores..."

151
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,469
Those are easier to get
when you're not sleeping
through class.

152
00:11:08,503 --> 00:11:11,205
"...Two letters
of recommendation,"
blah, blah, blah.

153
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,574
"The following items
need to be complete:

154
00:11:12,607 --> 00:11:14,208
Congressional Nomination."

155
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,143
Have you sent your request
to Senator Williams?

156
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,579
- Mailed it.
- Good.

157
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,380
Now come inside
and get a shower.

158
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:21,550
-It's almost time for dinner.
-Already ate.

159
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,297
Torres, come here a second.

160
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,802
Got a call today
from Coach Givens
up in Annapolis.

161
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,171
Looks like they got
your application.

162
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,641
He wanted to know what kind
of wrestler you are.

163
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,577
You tell him I was
the best you ever trained?

164
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,211
Told him the truth, Torres.

165
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:53,615
You're state championship
material.

166
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:55,249
He liked that.

167
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,952
Said almost all
of his kids are state champs.

168
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:00,421
-Admissions likes it.
-Then they're gonna love me.

169
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,924
Man, there you go again.

170
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,661
Standing here just kissing
your own backside.

171
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,030
Why aren't you working
with the rest of the team?

172
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,799
You're a captain.

173
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,935
'Cause I handle the runs
and Marcus has them in here.

174
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,837
I would hate to have
to show him up.

175
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:21,108
Believing in yourself is fine,

176
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,310
but you've got to start
being a team player.

177
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:25,346
No one is the full package.

178
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,949
Coach Givens
gave me the news.

179
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:30,451
He did a pre-read
with admissions.

180
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,687
-You didn't get in.
-What?

181
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:34,388
He didn't give me
any specifics,

182
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,457
but they kicked it back
to him for final say so.

183
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,826
According to him,
there's only one way in.

184
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,729
You've got to win
that state championship.

185
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,363
That's not fair.

186
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:44,965
Well, their game,
their rules on what is fair.

187
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,401
You win or you don't.

188
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,804
You step up
or you sit down.

189
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,141
Now what the hell
are you gonna do about it?

190
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:57,679
I'm gonna win
the state championship.

191
00:12:57,712 --> 00:12:59,480
That's what I like to hear.

192
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:01,415
And a good team
will get you there.

193
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:07,589
So, why don't you take them
out for a run, captain?

194
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,429
All right, Nighthawks,

195
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,666
let's take a trip to Wilbur
and Orville, let's go.

196
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:19,066
Whoo!

197
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,060
You know, when I signed up
for this,

198
00:13:46,093 --> 00:13:48,429
I didn't think there'd be
this much running.

199
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:51,065
It's good for you, Jolly G.
Helps to build up your stamina.

200
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,867
Yeah, but we don't run
around on the mat.

201
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,270
You need a good stamina
to hold your own on the mat.

202
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:59,273
What do you intend
to do to your opponent,
fall on him until he gives up?

203
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:02,610
Something like that.
When I was in football,

204
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,478
Coach told me to do
the same thing.

205
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:06,447
All he wanted me to do
is fall on people.

206
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,216
-You're on the football team?
-No, I quit.

207
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,652
Too much running.

208
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,823
What did you think we were
gonna do, Tons-of-Fun?

209
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:17,891
Run around in glitter capes
and throw chairs at people?

210
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,060
This is real wrestling.
Let's go!

211
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,995
I don't think
he likes me that much.

212
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,398
He's a senior.
They don't like anybody.

213
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,993
Let's go.
Pick it up, let's go.

214
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,094
Come on.

215
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,398
Pick it up, nature boy.
Let's go!

216
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,835
-Is that necessary?
-It's motivation.

217
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,538
If he doesn't like it,
he'll work harder
to not hear it.

218
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,840
-Or he'll quit.
-Win-win.

219
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:08,643
All right, you loads,
take five to catch
your breath.

220
00:15:08,676 --> 00:15:11,011
Last one down gets
to carry Slackary.

221
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:15,717
That is if it's all right
with you, El Capitan.

222
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:17,886
What do you want, Marcus?

223
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:20,053
You really didn't hear
any of that?

224
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,857
How do you run so fast
with your head crammed
between your legs?

225
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:26,393
-What's your problem?
-My problem?

226
00:15:26,427 --> 00:15:28,362
We're supposed
to be team captains.

227
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,899
You think this is
some type of solo act.

228
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,067
You think you're
too good to even run up
the monument with your team.

229
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:37,171
Yeah, you gonna
call me a stupid name
to motivate me, too?

230
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,874
They're not stupid names
if they're true, Showboat.

231
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:45,212
Break's over.
We're going back down.
Let's go.

232
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,714
Don't worry,
I'll keep them in line

233
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:48,716
while you go cry
up front by yourself.

234
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,589
-Knock it off, you two.
-Give me a break.

235
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,056
Let's go, Nighthawks.

236
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,333
-Oh, man.
-Come on, you got it.

237
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,603
Good hard run,
gotta make sure we cool down.

238
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:12,105
You two can't even
go on a run together
without giving me grief?

239
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,776
Hey, what are y'all doing?
Focus, finish your workout.

240
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:18,378
You guys are supposed to be
my captains, my leaders.

241
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,582
-Not the main event.
-He started it.

242
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,416
Oh, spare me, Marcus.

243
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,586
You two have been butting
heads ever since year one.

244
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,921
I know the story.
I don't care.

245
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,123
Here's my problem.

246
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,793
How are we supposed
to get to states

247
00:16:31,826 --> 00:16:33,928
with you two
clipping each other's knees

248
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,964
before we even have
a chance to stand?

249
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:38,867
Problem is
you're too stubborn.

250
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,703
Too full of yourselves to even
think about anyone else.

251
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:46,608
I believe I just formed
a plan to get you off
each other's backsides.

252
00:16:47,575 --> 00:16:49,443
It's quite simple.

253
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:52,312
You guys have extra energy
to put on each other.

254
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,015
We'll just put it
on somebody else.

255
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,252
Welcome to the First Flight
Nighthawks

256
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,120
mentorship program.

257
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,488
What?

258
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,625
In addition to being
team captains,

259
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:07,194
you're going
to personally mentor
some of our newest members.

260
00:17:08,262 --> 00:17:10,464
Marcus, you got Zachary.

261
00:17:10,497 --> 00:17:12,332
There's a lot
of potential there.

262
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,738
Chris, you'd be
a good match for Carla.

263
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:19,172
-What?
-You've got to be joking.

264
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,010
Zelinski, the only joke
out here is you two.

265
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,511
So full of yourselves,

266
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:26,179
you don't have time
for anything else.

267
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,850
I just gave you
a way out of that.

268
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,518
-You're welcome.
-Come on.

269
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,787
Stow it, Torres.

270
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,189
Or does the state championship
mean that little to you?

271
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:42,195
That's what I thought.

272
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,999
Congratulations, gentlemen,

273
00:17:46,034 --> 00:17:49,369
you're gonna be shaping
the next generation
of Nighthawks.

274
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:52,072
Let's go give them
the good news.

275
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,611
-You, a mentor?
-I know, right?

276
00:17:56,644 --> 00:18:01,181
-What is Coach thinking?
-Right? I mean-- hey.

277
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:03,450
It's bad enough
he made you team captain.

278
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,152
Wow, you really know
how to build up a guy.

279
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,988
I'm not trying
to build you up, Romeo.

280
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:09,023
Coach knows what he's doing.

281
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:11,325
The Navy wants
leadership and that's
what he is giving you.

282
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,728
So put on your big-boy pants
and get in the game.

283
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,898
-Yes, ma'am.
-That's what I like to hear.

284
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,467
So, what's
the Navy telling you anyways?

285
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,972
I'm in a holding pattern
until the state championship
thing works itself out.

286
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:26,007
Seriously,
you should consider Army

287
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,474
if this whole Navy thing
doesn't work out.

288
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,376
Not an option.

289
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:31,512
You don't know that.
Navy's not doing you
any favors.

290
00:18:31,546 --> 00:18:33,047
I'm not talking
about this with you.

291
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:35,449
Well, maybe I wanna talk
about it with you.

292
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,318
Maybe we should talk
about your swimming instead.

293
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:41,723
Crafty diversion, but I accept.

294
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,058
You're not
the only team captain
inspiring the troops.

295
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:47,427
Coach Bradshaw
is over the moon
with my backstroke.

296
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,196
Next meet is Tuesday.

297
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,032
Think you can come by
and see it?

298
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:53,601
-I can't, I got to practice.
-Imagine that.

299
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,571
-You always have practice.
-Practice makes perfect.

300
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,240
You're right,
practice does make perfect.

301
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:06,914
Check please.

302
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,022
We're heading out.

303
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:16,156
Chris and Marcus,
let's go, lead the way.

304
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:22,396
Clear the mat.

305
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,565
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

306
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,670
<i>and here are</i>
<i>your First Flight Nighthawks.</i>

307
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:36,511
Hey.

308
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:42,950
-Hi, Mrs. Torres.
What's up, Mike?
-Hi, Lisa.

309
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,422
First match of the season.
Think they're ready?

310
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,224
To hear Chris tell it,
he could take on
the whole team himself.

311
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,328
-I see Jack is back again.
-Of course.

312
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,798
It's what he was born to do.

313
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:58,900
The Creefs only make
wrestling champs.

314
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,473
Who's that young lady
out there?

315
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:08,543
That's Carla.
Chris is mentoring her.

316
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,113
Chris didn't tell you?

317
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:15,983
Oh, yeah.
To keep him and Marcus busy,
Coach is making them mentor.

318
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:18,086
Carla's stuck with Chris.

319
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,454
-Poor girl.
-Poor Coach.

320
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,123
I hope he knows
what he's doing.

321
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:24,525
One Chris
is more than enough.

322
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,293
Michael,
put that thing away.

323
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,995
We're here to watch
your brother wrestle.

324
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,731
Let me know
when he's losing.

325
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,533
All right guys,
bring it in.

326
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,103
All right,
good energy, I like it.

327
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,504
Ready, Jeff?

328
00:20:39,674 --> 00:20:43,711
Chris, start this off right.
Don't do anything fancy.

329
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:45,780
Get it done quick and easy.

330
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:48,616
Relax, Coach. I'm here
to do some serious work.

331
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:50,885
Good, that's what
I want to hear.

332
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:57,725
Oh, boy, here we go.

333
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,862
Boo!

334
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,665
Unsportsmanlike conduct,
green.

335
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:07,135
One team point deduction,
green.

336
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,670
Come on, ref.
Let the kids wrestle.

337
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,239
He's just excited.

338
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:13,207
Coach, get control
of your wrestler.

339
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,009
Another unsportsmanlike
conduct against him

340
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:16,511
and I'm gonna
disqualify him.

341
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:18,179
That's a fine start
to the season.

342
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:21,916
-You're kidding me.
-Cut the crap, Chris.

343
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:23,751
Get out there
and get to work.

344
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:26,386
I even brought my tools,
sledge and hammer.

345
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,363
You know the Kortezki V2?

346
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:38,666
Gentlemen,
shake hands. Ready?

347
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:45,573
Two green, take down.

348
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,612
Now you do.

349
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:53,346
Gentlemen,
shake hands, please.

350
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,083
Nice match. Winner by fall.

351
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:01,889
Marcus, you're up.

352
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,428
Marcus. Good!

353
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:11,464
Fall!

354
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,774
Jack, TLT, TLT.
Jerk him!

355
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,311
Fall!

356
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:29,984
Come on, Zach.

357
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:33,654
Come on, Zach. You got it.

358
00:22:33,688 --> 00:22:34,889
Two red, takedown.

359
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,075
Must be a nighttime run
to the bombing range.

360
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:56,143
I haven't worked up
to night flying yet.

361
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:58,779
-Paul thinks I'm ready though.
-I'm not surprised.

362
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:01,249
You're a natural,
just like your father.

363
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:03,851
You know, he was so good
that he used to do things

364
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:05,820
just to freak out
his instructors.

365
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,189
-Like what?
-Tell her about
the Coke can, Mom.

366
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,423
Well, once he learned
to land,

367
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:13,194
you know, touch down
and take off again
like on an aircraft carrier,

368
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:17,131
he used to hit the exact
same spot every time.

369
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:21,135
He got so good
that they used to put a Coke
can on the runway.

370
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:24,705
He would hit it on landing,
and then climb
right back up again.

371
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:27,208
It was very impressive.

372
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,476
His instructors weren't
too amused though.

373
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,013
Probably because he got
Coke all over the runway.

374
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,714
Probably so.

375
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:36,284
Well there was this other time
at Uncle Carl's wedding.

376
00:23:36,317 --> 00:23:38,686
Nobody could find
your father anywhere,

377
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:42,023
but the priest insisted that
we go on with the ceremony.

378
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:46,294
As soon as he said,
"Now I pronounce you
husband and wife,"

379
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:50,064
your father did
this low altitude,
low speed flyover.

380
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:53,534
It scared the crap
out of everyone.

381
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,004
The windows shook.
The caterers dropped
trays of food.

382
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,974
Even one of the groomsmen
jumped in the bushes.

383
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:02,475
The priest was
in on it the whole time.

384
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:05,379
Well, oddly enough,

385
00:24:05,413 --> 00:24:07,480
we weren't invited
to too many more weddings.

386
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:10,685
I wish I had
the chance to meet him.

387
00:24:10,718 --> 00:24:13,020
He would've liked you a lot.
Don't worry though.

388
00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:15,323
-I'm gonna be just like him.
-Me, too.

389
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:40,314
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here."

390
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:44,285
Not gonna be a problem.
Undefeated, baby.

391
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:47,221
-Who's gonna stop me?
-This is Kid Hulk's home turf.

392
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:49,690
You didn't wrestle him
last year, I did.

393
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:51,625
He pinned me in the first.

394
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,462
Yeah, well,
you'll get him this time.

395
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:57,198
- I hope you're right.
- Listen up.

396
00:24:58,766 --> 00:25:02,870
Now, we've won some matches.
We've scored some points.

397
00:25:02,903 --> 00:25:06,140
But this
is going to be tough.

398
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,642
You go in there strong,
you go in there smart.

399
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:10,511
-You got me?
-Yes, Coach.

400
00:25:12,913 --> 00:25:14,281
Sweet Sookie.

401
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:16,650
You go in there
with that kind of energy,

402
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:20,855
we might as well just forfeit
and offer to wash their jocks.

403
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:25,059
Did I pick up the First Flight
quilting squad by mistake?

404
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:27,461
I said we wrestle
strong and smart!

405
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:29,897
- You got me?
- Yes, Coach!

406
00:25:31,532 --> 00:25:33,334
Good.

407
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,037
I was starting to think I drove
all this way for nothing.

408
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:39,407
Now let's go get it done,
Nighthawks!

409
00:25:41,675 --> 00:25:42,710
Hustle up.

410
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,352
We gotta talk.

411
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:56,157
You've got
some big competition today.

412
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,126
-Name's Eric Sutter.
-Kid Hulk?

413
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,862
-Yeah, I know him.
-Oh, fitting name.

414
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,798
He went to states
last year and won.

415
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,534
He's top dog in these parts.

416
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,335
Wrestled Jack last year
and pinned him in the first.

417
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:10,671
-Not this year.
-Yeah, that's right.

418
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:13,174
I found out this morning
Sutter upped his weight.

419
00:26:13,207 --> 00:26:14,942
He's in a completely
different division.

420
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:17,812
-Your division.
-Lucky him.

421
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:19,713
You've had it easy
so far, Torres,

422
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:21,816
but this kid
is the real deal.

423
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,784
He's as fast as he is strong.

424
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,053
Do not play around
with this guy.

425
00:26:26,087 --> 00:26:28,689
Relax, Coach.
This is not my first rodeo.

426
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:30,958
I got this.
He's new to my weight class.

427
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,460
I have the advantage.

428
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:36,230
Just trying to help.

429
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:38,833
Mmm.

430
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:41,202
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it.

431
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:45,806
That's Kid Hulk?
I was expecting
something greener.

432
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,475
That's 'cause he's
in a good mood.

433
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:50,811
Okay, Torres, you're up.
Move quick and counter.

434
00:26:50,845 --> 00:26:52,746
Keep it simple.
Don't get flashy.

435
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:55,584
Watch out, Hulk smash.

436
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,485
Well, I'm Kid Kryptonite.

437
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,321
That's not how that works.

438
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,562
All right,
gentlemen, shake hands.

439
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,548
Two, takedown, two!

440
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,140
Just like last year, huh?

441
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:58,212
Shake hands.

442
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,091
What just happened?

443
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,628
Well, I'll tell you
what I saw.

444
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,298
Some cocky little chucklehead
didn't listen to his coach

445
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,966
and got his butt whooped.

446
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:20,768
What did it look like
from where you were?

447
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,436
This guy's a monster.

448
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:25,674
They don't call him Kid Hulk
for his vocabulary.

449
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,274
You want to be
a state champion,

450
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,976
you're gonna have
to go through him.

451
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:31,680
Through him?
How am I gonna do that?

452
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:35,115
Whoa, what's that, Torres?
You're asking someone for help?

453
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,351
I thought you were a solo act.

454
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:39,353
I've gotta mark this one
down on my calendar.

455
00:29:14,522 --> 00:29:16,390
<i>You've had it</i>
<i>easy so far, Torres,</i>

456
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,593
<i>but this kid is the real deal.</i>

457
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:27,434
<i>Whoa, what's that, Torres?</i>
<i>You're asking someone for help?</i>

458
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,582
<i>You want to be</i>
<i>a state champion,</i>

459
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:44,118
<i>you're gonna have</i>
<i>to go through him.</i>

460
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:22,122
Uh, Marcus,
there's a problem.

461
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,525
What do you want, Slack?

462
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,292
-I have a match.
-So?

463
00:30:25,326 --> 00:30:27,796
So, you're my mentor.
What do I do?

464
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,129
Just don't get pinned.

465
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,370
-Yo, what's up?
-What's up?

466
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,038
Yo, you guys got
a girl in my weight?

467
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,941
Sounds like she's making
you nervous, Damian.

468
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:44,311
Nah man, look,
I break the lady's hearts,
not their arms.

469
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,280
I don't want to hurt her.
Tell her to pin herself

470
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:49,016
in the first 20 seconds,
or I'm gonna banana split her.

471
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:51,653
Carla hates
being called a lady.

472
00:30:51,686 --> 00:30:53,987
She's gonna hate
being embarrassed
in front of her team more.

473
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:56,056
I'm just trying to warn her.
It's only fair.

474
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,792
Why don't you go
tell her yourself?

475
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:01,596
Uh-oh, looks like
someone's intimidated.

476
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:04,264
-What you think, Chris?
-I believe so.

477
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:06,500
Hey, Damien,
is this your first time
ever touching a girl?

478
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,404
You tell her to eat mat,
or she's gonna get hurt.

479
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:14,375
So, you gonna tell her?

480
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,082
-What's up?
-What's up?

481
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:24,151
Word is you're going
against Damian.

482
00:31:24,184 --> 00:31:25,419
So?

483
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:28,355
He wants you
to give up the match.

484
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:30,891
Said he only loves ladies
and doesn't hurt them.

485
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:40,602
I know, right?
He's gonna try
to banana split you.

486
00:31:40,635 --> 00:31:44,338
If he takes you down,
he's gonna put a leg in
and attack the other leg.

487
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:45,874
-Thanks.
-No problem.

488
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:51,278
Whatever happens,
you get taken down,

489
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,681
always work
to your base, okay?
All right.

490
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:56,250
You got it, you bet.

491
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:01,321
-Carla Tillett.
-Damian Rodriguez.

492
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,223
-Talk to Chris?
-Yeah, bad news for you.

493
00:32:03,257 --> 00:32:04,626
I ain't no lady.

494
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:07,461
Shake hands, please. Set.

495
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,998
Nice match. Shake hands.
Winner by fall.

496
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:50,905
You did good.

497
00:32:50,939 --> 00:32:52,105
Not good enough.

498
00:32:56,443 --> 00:32:58,378
So then Coach Bradshaw
told Karen

499
00:32:58,412 --> 00:32:59,914
that maybe
if she shaved her legs

500
00:32:59,948 --> 00:33:01,783
she could get
a little bit more speed,

501
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,586
and everybody thought that was
so funny except for Karen,

502
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,754
who's going
through this whole
natural woman thing

503
00:33:06,788 --> 00:33:09,289
and doesn't think she has
to conform in order to compete.

504
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:12,861
And then practice turned
into this whole lesson
about hydrodynamics,

505
00:33:12,894 --> 00:33:15,295
and I've never been
more bored in my life.

506
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:22,035
And you're not even
listening to me.

507
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,105
I was. You're talking
about aerodynamics.

508
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:26,774
I love aerodynamics.

509
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:29,109
And you're thinking
about planes again.

510
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,478
Did you even grasp anything
of what I was saying?

511
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,248
Karen would
make a lousy plane.

512
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,717
Touché.

513
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,451
On to unfinished business.

514
00:33:37,484 --> 00:33:39,453
When can I see you
at one of my meets?

515
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:48,128
Smooth move, Romeo,
but you can't rose
your way out of this one.

516
00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:51,265
Your meets are always
during my personal trainings.

517
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:53,267
And you're always training.

518
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,836
Well, I need
to be a state champ,

519
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,070
and to do that,
I gotta be in top condition.

520
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:59,239
You ever think you got
the wrong focus, Chris?

521
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:02,476
It's like everything
is rigged against you
from the beginning.

522
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,845
They want the best.

523
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:06,614
Maybe you should consider
switching sides.

524
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:08,950
Swimming is a Navy skill,
after all.

525
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:12,352
My dad and my uncles
and my brothers would kill me.

526
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,288
Not with the SEALs
at your back.

527
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:15,924
My uncles are Rangers.

528
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,028
I'm sensing a competition
coming along.

529
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,697
-Push up contest?
-What are the stakes?

530
00:34:23,698 --> 00:34:25,867
Hmm, a kiss.

531
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,536
Ooh, nice one, Romeo.

532
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,839
Okay, and if I win, you have
to come to my next meet.

533
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,809
Hey, wait a minute.
All I'm getting is a kiss?

534
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,644
Too late,
I already accepted.

535
00:34:36,678 --> 00:34:38,613
First one to 20, Romeo.

536
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:40,280
You better wave a flag
when you get there.

537
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:41,716
That's not fair.

538
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,283
That's the rallying
cry of a loser.

539
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:45,385
You're ten behind.

540
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:48,056
Hey, Mikey,
I got a pushup contest
going on with your brother.

541
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:50,290
If you help me win,
I'll give you a dollar.

542
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:55,697
Hey, what the heck?

543
00:35:04,072 --> 00:35:06,306
Good match.
My next meet is Tuesday
at 7:00.

544
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,909
Don't forget
to bring your flag.

545
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:10,310
-You cheated.
-I called for reinforcements.

546
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,747
That's standard procedure
if you wanna secure the win.

547
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,749
But to show you
I'm such a good sport,

548
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,718
I'll give you
your prize for free.

549
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:21,388
-Ahem.
-Wow, some backup.

550
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,727
You get what you pay for.

551
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,562
Jeff, basic arm drag.

552
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:30,031
Okay, wrist and tricep,
shift.

553
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:31,766
Got it?

554
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:32,834
All right.

555
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:41,009
Dang, sack of potatoes.
You got moves like
a brick wall.

556
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:45,580
Maybe you should be
on the other team and put
that losing to good use.

557
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,424
Hey, now, take it easy.

558
00:36:02,262 --> 00:36:05,833
I said take it easy.
Go, take a run.

559
00:36:06,433 --> 00:36:08,136
Why don't you run
this clown?

560
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,437
If he wasn't
the only heavyweight
on the team,

561
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,006
he would've been out
weeks ago.

562
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:26,054
What are you staring at?
This ain't drama club.

563
00:36:26,654 --> 00:36:27,789
Pick it up.

564
00:36:30,024 --> 00:36:31,926
Coach, he's right.
I shouldn't be here.

565
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,326
I lose every match.

566
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:37,765
That's not technically true.

567
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,801
You've had three forfeits
this year already.

568
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:43,071
That's 18 team points
you scored

569
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:44,505
just by trying hard
and showing up.

570
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:46,440
Yeah, the benches show up.

571
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:48,509
Yeah, but they
don't win us points.

572
00:36:50,178 --> 00:36:53,447
Look, kid,
this is a tough sport.

573
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,415
You've got ways to go yet,

574
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:58,186
but as long as you show up,
you've got a chance.

575
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:01,889
Stick with it, train hard,
believe in yourself.

576
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:04,424
-Well, that's the hard part.
-Well, maybe at first,

577
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:08,428
but after the first time
you surprise yourself,

578
00:37:08,462 --> 00:37:11,465
you'll be amazed at what
you can go on to achieve.

579
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:14,367
Now, back to drilling.

580
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:17,105
Come on.

581
00:37:17,138 --> 00:37:19,140
Let's work on stopping
those double legs.

582
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,787
So when are you
taking me up?

583
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:36,323
Paul said I need
a few more lessons

584
00:37:36,356 --> 00:37:38,626
before he's comfortable
letting me risk
anyone else's life.

585
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:40,862
-That's encouraging.
-That's Paul.

586
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,534
What's on your mind, Torres?
You're broodier than normal.

587
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:49,637
Marcus was really giving
Zach a hard time
at practice yesterday.

588
00:37:51,005 --> 00:37:52,472
Basically
called him useless.

589
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,210
I thought he was finally
gonna quit, but Coach talked
him out of it.

590
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,714
Zach's trying
to better himself
against the odds.

591
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,314
That's the kind of guy
you want on your team.

592
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:04,417
-Yeah, you're right.
-Of course I'm right.

593
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,920
I'm always right.

594
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:07,655
You're lucky you get
the wisdom for free.

595
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:10,558
If I start paying,
can I get less of it?

596
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,794
Race you to the pier.

597
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,269
Is that as fast
as they run in the Army?

598
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,750
-Ah.
-Proud of yourself?

599
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,620
You could say that.
Or maybe it was part
of my master plan.

600
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:42,990
Master plan?
More like petty revenge
for losing to me at pushups.

601
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,061
Both.

602
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:49,697
Or maybe it's 'cause
I want to get you alone
for a little bit.

603
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,934
Oh, I see.
And do you always get
what you want?

604
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:54,702
It's worked so far.

605
00:39:07,148 --> 00:39:09,449
Just so you know,
this isn't an official visit

606
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:12,220
until I see you in the stands
at one of my swim meets.

607
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,055
Relax okay. I'll be there.

608
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:15,990
I'll believe it
when I see it.

609
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:17,959
I'll be there.
Wednesday at 8:00?

610
00:39:17,992 --> 00:39:19,627
Tuesday at 7:00.

611
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:25,900
-How's Zach coming along?
-Well, he's still here.

612
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:28,302
Not for long
if Marcus has anything
to do with it.

613
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,738
I've got bad news, Slack.

614
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,573
Looks like
you've got a match.

615
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:33,975
You should go out
and forfeit

616
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:35,576
so I don't have
to hear you hit the mat.

617
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,011
How is this helping him?

618
00:39:37,044 --> 00:39:38,980
You're supposed
to be a team captain.

619
00:39:39,013 --> 00:39:40,815
You've done nothing
but cut him down
the whole season.

620
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,950
Believe me, he should
have been cut weeks ago.

621
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:44,252
He's useless.

622
00:39:45,553 --> 00:39:48,155
He's still here giving
his all despite having
to put up with you.

623
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,857
That has to mean something.

624
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:52,159
Put it in the match,
Zelinski.

625
00:39:52,193 --> 00:39:54,362
Keep that crap
off my sideline.

626
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,097
Tell your Showboat
to mind his own business.

627
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,667
The team
is everyone's business.

628
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,302
Go warm up, Zelinski.

629
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:03,871
You know what?
You're looking for a fight,

630
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:05,773
so you better deliver
on that mat

631
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:08,042
or you're gonna be pulling
double laps tomorrow.

632
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:13,180
Don't listen
to that clown, man.

633
00:40:13,214 --> 00:40:14,949
You only lose
if you stop trying.

634
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:16,751
You haven't stopped yet,
Jolly Green.

635
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:20,588
Carla Tillett.

636
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,432
Trent Campos.

637
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:44,312
Shake hands, please. Set.

638
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:10,771
Change.

639
00:41:34,562 --> 00:41:36,330
Green takes down.
Green, get set.

640
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,810
Two, reversal, green.

641
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:08,863
Set red, green cover.

642
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,802
One escape red neutral,
one red neutral.

643
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:42,563
Shake hands, please.
Nice match.

644
00:42:43,864 --> 00:42:45,266
Winner by decision.

645
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:47,768
Yeah!
Yo, that was awesome!

646
00:42:47,802 --> 00:42:49,003
She got her first...

647
00:43:08,022 --> 00:43:10,057
Coach, bad news.

648
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:12,626
I got sent
to the principal today.

649
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,662
-What happened?
-Somebody reported me.

650
00:43:14,695 --> 00:43:16,730
What about?

651
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:18,899
For bringing
King and Kong to school.

652
00:43:23,904 --> 00:43:25,540
All right, guys, listen up.

653
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:28,809
On the line. Let's go live.

654
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,849
-You ready?
-Always.

655
00:43:34,882 --> 00:43:36,050
Let's go, dog.

656
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:57,606
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Just defending.

657
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,174
Keep it legal.

658
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,422
-Why are you such a jerk?
-You are, too.

659
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:18,292
-Just in a different way.
-I don't get it.

660
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:22,930
What's with you?
We're on the same team.

661
00:44:22,963 --> 00:44:25,432
-We're a lot alike.
-We're nothing alike.

662
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:28,736
Your father was
some hotshot pilot.
My father's in jail.

663
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,104
Your mother has everything.

664
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:31,805
My mother can hardly
speak English.

665
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,609
-You clueless dickhead.
-Try and keep up.

666
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:36,877
All right, you guys,
cut the crap.

667
00:44:38,012 --> 00:44:41,282
That's it for today.
Everybody bring it in.

668
00:44:41,315 --> 00:44:44,118
-Chris, break it down.
-Nighthawks on three.

669
00:44:44,151 --> 00:44:46,320
One, two,
three, Nighthawks!

670
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:51,458
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm gonna get going.

671
00:44:51,492 --> 00:44:52,993
I gotta get to a swim meet.

672
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:57,231
-What did you weigh out?
-I dropped like five pounds.

673
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:59,300
Oh, you know
better than that.

674
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:02,069
Stay hydrated.
Stay focused.

675
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:40,407
I can't believe it.
He actually showed up.

676
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,583
Oh, my God!

677
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,253
Chris, are you okay?

678
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,190
I think
there's something wrong.

679
00:45:56,223 --> 00:45:58,092
Let's get you inside
and call your mom.

680
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:04,566
You don't look so good.
I'm gonna call your mom.

681
00:46:06,568 --> 00:46:08,135
I think I'm gonna be sick.

682
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:17,044
Your mom's on the way.

683
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,812
She says she thinks
you have a concussion.

684
00:46:20,914 --> 00:46:23,551
Looks like you'll do
anything to get out of
one of my swim meets.

685
00:46:23,585 --> 00:46:26,353
Believe me,
this wasn't my choice.

686
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:27,988
I know.

687
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,423
I was just picking on you.

688
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:31,825
Do you wanna hear
some good news?

689
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,929
-What?
-I heard back
from West Point.

690
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,064
I got in.

691
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:49,443
Well, at least
it's winter break.

692
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,446
Everybody could use
some time to relax.

693
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:55,382
-I don't got time to relax.
-I've noticed.

694
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,686
Well, take it easy
with Coach Givens today.

695
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,688
You're still recovering
from that concussion

696
00:46:59,721 --> 00:47:01,790
and the doctor said
you shouldn't wrestle
for two weeks.

697
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,159
What if Coach Givens wants
to see my skills?

698
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,229
You just flash
that winning personality

699
00:47:09,263 --> 00:47:10,864
you've had
since grade school.

700
00:47:12,634 --> 00:47:14,736
Just like that.

701
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:18,305
Oh! Kid, I'm convinced
you're gonna rule
the world one day.

702
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:36,658
Ah, yes.

703
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,360
The rising star
from First Flight.

704
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:42,996
Coach Kelvin and I have
spoken a lot about you.

705
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,998
I really appreciate
you guys driving up.

706
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:46,333
Have a seat, please.

707
00:47:49,269 --> 00:47:52,339
This is a

708
00:47:52,373 --> 00:47:54,908
pretty impressive file,
Torres.

709
00:47:56,377 --> 00:48:00,347
Team Captain, volunteered
for the mentor program.

710
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:02,517
-That's good stuff.
-Thanks, Coach.

711
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,053
Don't thank me.
You did all the work, kid.

712
00:48:06,855 --> 00:48:08,222
I'm just reading the news.

713
00:48:09,824 --> 00:48:13,528
So now you wanna fly jets
and wrestle for Uncle Sam.

714
00:48:13,561 --> 00:48:16,430
Well, yes, Coach.
My father was a pilot.

715
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:19,166
Jet noise is in my blood.
And as for wrestling...

716
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,871
I just love it.

717
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:25,038
Yeah.
That's the confidence

718
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:26,775
Coach Kelvin kept
telling me about.

719
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:28,942
And you are gonna need that.

720
00:48:29,977 --> 00:48:33,447
Well, everybody's
gotta start someplace.

721
00:48:34,883 --> 00:48:37,652
-How about right now?
-What?

722
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:39,788
Just a friendly competition
to see your boy in action.

723
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:43,558
I got a-- I got
a couple guys waiting
in the combatives room.

724
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,794
-Well actually I think that--
-No, no problem.

725
00:48:45,827 --> 00:48:49,229
Just, uh, try not to hurt
them, okay, Torres?

726
00:48:51,165 --> 00:48:53,133
Ma'am, do you have
any concerns with this?

727
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:57,237
-No problem, right, Mom?
-No problem.

728
00:48:58,205 --> 00:48:59,574
I brought my stuff with me.

729
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:01,241
Good man.
Get down there and change.

730
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:02,877
We'll see you
at the end of the hallway.

731
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,484
Come on, guys.
Put your shirts on.

732
00:49:10,518 --> 00:49:12,754
This ain't Waikiki Beach.

733
00:49:12,787 --> 00:49:15,222
Torres,
this is Simmons and Ellis.

734
00:49:15,255 --> 00:49:17,792
They are back
on leave from down range.

735
00:49:18,693 --> 00:49:20,795
I think, I never know.

736
00:49:24,398 --> 00:49:26,668
This will give us some time
to talk, Mrs. Torres.

737
00:49:26,701 --> 00:49:27,802
What did you
want to talk about?

738
00:49:29,637 --> 00:49:30,672
Plan B.

739
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:42,416
-Let's see what you got.
-So, you guys are SEALs?

740
00:49:43,918 --> 00:49:45,954
Nah, we're just
problem solvers.

741
00:49:45,986 --> 00:49:48,188
And today,
you're our problem.

742
00:49:52,627 --> 00:49:54,495
We'll start with takedowns
and go from there.

743
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:59,166
-Go Navy.
-Beat Army.

744
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,235
Wrestle!

745
00:50:07,642 --> 00:50:08,676
Time.

746
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:27,361
Time.

747
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:33,835
No, it's you two.
We switch out.

748
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,837
No, I don't think so.

749
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,305
Yeah, I went twice already.

750
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:39,641
It's you two this time.

751
00:50:41,776 --> 00:50:43,076
That's not how this works.

752
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:45,713
Coach didn't send us
in here to test each other.

753
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:49,182
You guys
get a rest and I don't?
That's not fair.

754
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,485
Fair?
What's this fair?

755
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,622
Ellis, did you order
a warm bottle of fair
for this kid?

756
00:50:54,656 --> 00:50:57,625
-Not me.
-Maybe we should
ask his mommy.

757
00:50:57,659 --> 00:50:59,928
See if she packed him a bottle
of fair in his diaper bag.

758
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,266
He doesn't talk much,
does he?

759
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,002
He just likes
to blow things up.

760
00:51:10,572 --> 00:51:12,740
-All right. I get it.
-Not yet, kid.

761
00:51:13,741 --> 00:51:14,776
But you're about to.

762
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:17,779
Wrestle.

763
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:22,884
Time.

764
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:26,453
Time.

765
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,006
Time.

766
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,342
Hey, high school,
if you need to puke,
the can's over there.

767
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,143
If you puke on the mat,
you're gonna eat it.

768
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:51,679
No problem.

769
00:51:51,713 --> 00:51:53,347
Hey, I learned
this cool move the other day

770
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,849
called the Kortezki V2.

771
00:51:54,882 --> 00:51:56,618
You guys want me
to show it to you?

772
00:51:58,052 --> 00:52:00,688
Not gonna show us
anything new, high school.

773
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:03,925
Freeze, right there.

774
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:06,060
Not used to this view,
are you, high school?

775
00:52:06,094 --> 00:52:07,562
You got ten seconds
to get out.

776
00:52:07,595 --> 00:52:09,396
How bad do you want it?

777
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:13,067
-Oh, yeah, go Navy.
-Beat Army.

778
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:20,340
Say goodnight,
high school.

779
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,845
Looks like you guys
are getting along.

780
00:52:23,878 --> 00:52:27,214
-Just having some fun, sir.
-Yeah, I can see that.

781
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,216
I'm glad you showed up, too.

782
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,886
One minute later,
I would've broken
your hand with my face.

783
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:36,390
That was good work, Torres.
You got these guys pissed,

784
00:52:36,423 --> 00:52:38,526
and that is not
an easy thing to do.

785
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,695
Look, man, why don't you
hit the showers

786
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:43,698
and we'll have a talk
with you and your mom
in my office, okay?

787
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:45,700
Hey, you guys
go back to vacation.

788
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:48,335
Knit a sweater or something.

789
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,149
Looks like Annapolis
went well.

790
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:04,052
Got my butt kicked.
And West Point?

791
00:53:04,085 --> 00:53:06,554
Seen it, loved it,
bought the t-shirt.

792
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:08,321
You know, swimming's
totally a Navy thing.

793
00:53:08,355 --> 00:53:10,290
Only if your boat sinks.

794
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:13,293
-So, you got in?
-I'm not sure yet.

795
00:53:13,326 --> 00:53:14,796
The coach told my mom
it was imperative

796
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:16,731
that I win
a state championship.

797
00:53:16,764 --> 00:53:19,466
It's between that
or wrestling two SEALs.

798
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:20,835
I'm beginning
to have my doubts.

799
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:23,071
Geez, Chris, that's intense.

800
00:53:23,104 --> 00:53:25,338
I thought you weren't supposed
to wrestle over break.

801
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:26,941
Coach Givens wanted
to see what I had.

802
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:28,442
Was I supposed
to tell him no?

803
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:29,977
I guess not.

804
00:53:30,011 --> 00:53:31,679
I've never got
my butt beat so bad.

805
00:53:31,713 --> 00:53:34,582
Those guys were all over me.
It wasn't even fair.

806
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:37,085
It's like everything I tried
to do was just thrown
back in my face.

807
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,387
Careful, Romeo,
you're starting
to sound like me.

808
00:53:40,855 --> 00:53:42,690
I'm starting to think
you have a point.

809
00:53:42,724 --> 00:53:45,593
Wow, listening to me
and agreeing with me?

810
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:48,096
Those guys must have hit you
harder than you thought.

811
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:50,064
So what are you going to do?

812
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:55,036
I don't know. It's obvious
they're not gonna give me
any breaks and I can't quit.

813
00:53:56,204 --> 00:53:58,940
I guess
I just gotta work harder.
It is what it is.

814
00:53:59,974 --> 00:54:02,210
I know, but if you would
only consider West Point--

815
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:04,545
I don't want
to go to West Point, Lisa.

816
00:54:04,579 --> 00:54:06,413
I'm Navy, all the way.

817
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:10,118
I'm gonna be a pilot
just like my dad.

818
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:11,552
It's Navy or nothing.

819
00:54:12,987 --> 00:54:14,756
Well, I got something
to cheer you up.

820
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,862
Lisa, I'm sorry.
It's just all this stress.

821
00:54:20,895 --> 00:54:24,297
Don't sweat it. I'm sure
the Naval Academy thinks
it's all worth it.

822
00:54:36,077 --> 00:54:38,546
-Thanks for the help, Mikey.
-I didn't do anything.

823
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,914
I know.

824
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:45,186
Senator Williams?
All right!

825
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,262
-Mail call.
-Great, Senator Williams?

826
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:10,178
"It gives me great pleasure
to inform you...

827
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,548
...your credentials
are outstanding,

828
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:15,082
and you have
a great potential
for leadership.

829
00:55:15,116 --> 00:55:17,118
I am submitting
your name for nomination

830
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:20,087
for an appointment
to the US Military Academy
at West Point.

831
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:23,624
I am submitting
your name for nomination

832
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:26,527
for an appointment
to the US Military Academy
at West Point."

833
00:55:26,561 --> 00:55:28,129
Is this a joke?

834
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:30,363
No, honey, you read
the letter.

835
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:31,766
It says what it says.

836
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:36,037
Well, at least you'll know
somebody when you get there.

837
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:39,607
We'll figure it out,
all right?

838
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,576
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

839
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:42,643
Bye.

840
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:46,781
So, is it a mistake?

841
00:55:46,814 --> 00:55:48,549
I spoke
with the senator's office.

842
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:50,084
They said it's not
a clerical error

843
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:51,986
and there's nothing
that they can do.

844
00:55:52,753 --> 00:55:54,454
They only have
a number of nominations

845
00:55:54,487 --> 00:55:56,489
and they've all
been given out.

846
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:58,960
She can't switch yours
without taking away
someone else's,

847
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:00,328
which they won't do.

848
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:03,931
-I can't believe this.
-I know.

849
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:08,435
They said receiving
a nomination is a great honor
and we should be happy.

850
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:10,838
Of course,
we're happy, but...

851
00:56:10,872 --> 00:56:13,241
they also said they
understand our situation

852
00:56:13,274 --> 00:56:15,042
and are sorry
about the mix-up.

853
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:18,846
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know, honey.

854
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,480
Learn to fly a tank.

855
00:56:24,986 --> 00:56:26,486
Oh!

856
00:56:32,293 --> 00:56:35,096
For what it's worth,
I think you would look
good in green.

857
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,801
You know,
I was talking to my dad,

858
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:42,837
and you can fly
in the Army, too.

859
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,272
Just stop.

860
00:56:44,305 --> 00:56:45,472
I'm just trying
to help, Chris.

861
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:46,607
Well, it's not working.

862
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:50,845
So we're just gonna sit
out here in the cold
so you can sulk?

863
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:52,146
What happened
to that go-get-em,

864
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:53,881
best-of-the-best
attitude of yours?

865
00:56:53,915 --> 00:56:57,417
-It went to West Point.
-And is that so bad really?

866
00:56:58,386 --> 00:57:00,453
You can still fly
in the Army, Chris.

867
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:02,189
They have
a wrestling program.

868
00:57:02,223 --> 00:57:04,358
You can do everything
you wanted to do in the Navy.

869
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,162
Sure, West Point isn't
where you wanted to be,

870
00:57:08,195 --> 00:57:10,398
but maybe
it's where you belong.

871
00:57:14,035 --> 00:57:16,671
I belong to the Navy.
I wanna fly just like
my dad did.

872
00:57:16,704 --> 00:57:18,039
Why can't I have that?

873
00:57:18,072 --> 00:57:19,907
You can't be
just like him, Chris.

874
00:57:19,941 --> 00:57:21,542
You have to be you.

875
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,844
It's not as bad as you're
making it out to be.

876
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:25,546
Well, of course,
it's not for you.

877
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:28,516
The Navy was my whole
future and it's gone.

878
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:31,018
I get to go to West Point
with you just like you wanted.

879
00:57:31,052 --> 00:57:32,553
So it's my fault now?

880
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:34,355
West Point is fantastic.

881
00:57:34,388 --> 00:57:36,657
It's an honor
just to be nominated.

882
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,894
But here you are,
screaming and crying,
and throwing sand like a baby.

883
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:42,330
I get you're upset.
But what I don't get

884
00:57:42,363 --> 00:57:44,999
is this spoiled, self-centered
attitude of yours.

885
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:47,601
You think the whole world
revolves around you?

886
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:49,904
And mostly, I don't get
why I'm standing out here

887
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:51,572
trying to give a crap
about someone

888
00:57:51,605 --> 00:57:53,874
who obviously doesn't give
one about anyone else.

889
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:55,276
Goodbye, Chris.

890
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,512
Oh, so now you're gonna
break up with me?

891
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:02,950
The way I see it, between you,
your misery and your jets,

892
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:05,252
there's just no room
for me anymore.

893
00:58:05,286 --> 00:58:07,421
It's all or nothing
with me, Romeo.

894
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:08,756
See you in the clouds.

895
00:58:14,228 --> 00:58:15,262
Aaah!

896
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,030
Why don't you save
some weight, for the rest
of us, Showboat?

897
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:51,065
Now's not the time, Marcus.

898
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,502
Oh, yeah? My bad.

899
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,505
I didn't know
it was Torres time.

900
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:59,140
Guess you've had the area
rented out for a week, huh?

901
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:02,343
Is there a problem, boys?

902
00:59:02,376 --> 00:59:03,844
Oh, no problems, Coach.

903
00:59:03,878 --> 00:59:05,679
Just waiting for my turn
on the weights.

904
00:59:06,614 --> 00:59:09,283
Torres, that's enough iron.

905
00:59:09,316 --> 00:59:11,419
Get off and help Creef
with demonstrations.

906
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:18,426
Thanks, man.
I gotta get in shape.

907
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:21,095
Word is captain
of the swim team is single.

908
00:59:21,128 --> 00:59:22,531
I have to make
a good impression.

909
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:27,334
Relax, Showboat.
I'll show her a good time.

910
00:59:27,368 --> 00:59:29,670
Just go do something
besides jogging

911
00:59:29,703 --> 00:59:31,439
and have her cheer
for me in the stands.

912
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:34,275
-You stay away from her.
-Or what?

913
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:36,911
You don't need her anyway.
All you care about is jets.

914
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:39,713
You don't know when
to quit, do you, Marcus?

915
00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:42,716
No one ever won by quitting.

916
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,052
Now why don't you go
walk away like a good boy
so no one gets hurt?

917
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:47,655
You two,
knock it off, right now!

918
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:49,890
-I'm not
walking away this time.
-Good.

919
00:59:49,924 --> 00:59:51,425
Let's see
what you're made of.

920
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:56,831
Hey, hey!

921
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:59,467
- Stay out of this,
Meatloaf!

922
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,936
Knock it off
right now, Marcus.
I've had it with you two!

923
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:16,417
- Come on, Showboat,
final round.

924
01:00:18,018 --> 01:00:21,455
Well, you two finally
went for it, didn't you?

925
01:00:22,857 --> 01:00:24,559
I hope
it was really worth it.

926
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,063
Suspended?
But that's ridiculous.

927
01:00:29,096 --> 01:00:30,464
He was defending himself.

928
01:00:31,232 --> 01:00:33,334
Well, what else
should he have done

929
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:35,736
when a thug starts
a fight with him
in front of the whole team?

930
01:00:37,238 --> 01:00:40,609
No, no, I get it.
Rules are rules.

931
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:44,778
Even if they are set up
to punish those
who defend themselves.

932
01:00:45,246 --> 01:00:48,182
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

933
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:56,690
What makes you think
I want to hear any of this?

934
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,792
One of the best parts about
not being in high school

935
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:00,928
is not having to hear
about high school.

936
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,897
-Sorry, I--
-Kid, if I hear
another "Sorry,"

937
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,232
I'm gonna nose dive us
into the sound.

938
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,235
You pulled a grade A snafu
with your high school career.

939
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:11,640
That sucks.
Spare me the details.

940
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,875
Only reason why I'm up here
is 'cause I told my mom
I already paid for the lesson.

941
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:18,513
You did pay
for the lesson, right?

942
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,282
That better be a yes.

943
01:01:22,917 --> 01:01:25,119
What you got planned
for a follow-up act?

944
01:01:25,152 --> 01:01:27,488
A little anarchy,
some fire bombing?

945
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:29,223
Well, I've never
crashed a plane.

946
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:32,693
I've never kicked
a kid out at 2,000 feet.

947
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:35,396
Could be a year of firsts
for both of us.

948
01:01:37,698 --> 01:01:39,833
I just had to be up here.

949
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:44,004
It's easier up here,
like I'm above it all.

950
01:01:44,038 --> 01:01:47,174
You are, and you're drifting,
so keep it steady.

951
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:49,578
I mean...
you know what I mean.

952
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:51,011
I know what you mean, kid.

953
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,148
Flying is-- it's like
setting your soul free.

954
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:58,285
Pulls you up out
of the muck, and shows you
the whole picture.

955
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,120
All the dreary stuff
gets real small

956
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:02,022
when you leave it
on the ground.

957
01:02:02,056 --> 01:02:03,891
You can even go so far
you can't even see it anymore.

958
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:07,027
You wanna know the real trick
to flying, Chris?

959
01:02:07,061 --> 01:02:09,763
-What's that?
-Gotta come down sometime.

960
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:13,702
When you do,
you gotta be ready for it.

961
01:03:03,851 --> 01:03:06,287
Whoo!

962
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:22,002
-Yes, who are you?
-Hi, I'm Chris Torres.

963
01:03:22,036 --> 01:03:25,406
-I'm here to see Marcus.
-Okay, hold on just a second.

964
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,174
Marcus.

965
01:03:27,207 --> 01:03:29,109
Who is it?

966
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:34,915
Torres?
Where are you from, Torres?

967
01:03:34,948 --> 01:03:36,917
My grandmother
was a Shawnee Indian.

968
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:39,053
That's cool.

969
01:03:39,086 --> 01:03:42,524
Marcus.

970
01:03:46,628 --> 01:03:47,662
Okay.

971
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:54,301
What are you
doing at my house?
You come for a round two?

972
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:56,705
No thanks, man.
I'm still paying
for the last one.

973
01:03:56,738 --> 01:03:58,807
You're lucky Coach got me off
of you when he did,

974
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:01,008
or else you'd be eating soup
for the rest of your life.

975
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:11,385
What's this about?

976
01:04:12,353 --> 01:04:16,156
-Man, we gotta talk.
-Talk? You wanna talk?

977
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:19,927
You got suspended for a week.
I, I got expelled.

978
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,731
I don't have anything
to say to you, man,
except get the hell out.

979
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:27,067
Look, man, I'm sorry.
I was being stupid,

980
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:29,002
but I didn't set out
to ruin our lives.

981
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:31,238
Aw, you're making me
weepy, Showboat.

982
01:04:31,271 --> 01:04:32,707
I sure do feel bad for you.

983
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:36,944
Why don't you go hop
on that little bike of yours
and go ride out your blues?

984
01:04:36,977 --> 01:04:39,647
Me, I've gotta go
get ready for work.

985
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,249
I've got a long life
of washing dishes ahead of me.

986
01:04:43,818 --> 01:04:45,185
You were right.

987
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:49,089
I had my head up my butt
for so long that I lost sight
of everything that mattered,

988
01:04:49,123 --> 01:04:50,991
and lost everything
that mattered.

989
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:54,161
Wah-wah. Go tell someone
who gives a crap.

990
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:57,197
You're just as bad as I am.
We gotta fix this.

991
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:59,933
We've gotta let go
of each other's throats,
and work together.

992
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:03,103
Work together for what?
What do we possibly
need to work on?

993
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:04,873
Getting you back
in the school, for one.

994
01:05:04,905 --> 01:05:07,609
Look man,
I think you're king jerk,

995
01:05:07,642 --> 01:05:10,010
but I don't think
what they did to you was fair.

996
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:12,647
That's what you want, huh?

997
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,315
Showboat rides in
on his bike to save the day.

998
01:05:15,349 --> 01:05:18,318
You want more for your life
than washing dishes.
You know that.

999
01:05:18,352 --> 01:05:21,656
You think I'm playing?
Answer me one question.

1000
01:05:21,689 --> 01:05:23,223
What am I getting out of this?

1001
01:05:27,428 --> 01:05:29,631
So, can we talk?

1002
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:36,838
-I hate cherry.
-See, I didn't know that.

1003
01:05:36,871 --> 01:05:38,606
We're off to a great start.

1004
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:47,649
You have to understand
my hands are tied here.

1005
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,887
The two of you engaged
in a fight, which makes
this a legal matter.

1006
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:56,658
Yeah, it was stupid of us,
but we made a mistake.

1007
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:57,991
But we learned from this.

1008
01:05:59,126 --> 01:06:01,328
Do you know
how many times
I've heard that before?

1009
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:05,098
Look, I'm not here
to judge your sincerity.

1010
01:06:05,132 --> 01:06:09,704
The fact of the matter is,
the two of you engaged
in a fight on school grounds,

1011
01:06:09,737 --> 01:06:11,739
which makes that
against the law.

1012
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:13,608
And you.

1013
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:17,545
You started this fight so you
get the worst punishment.

1014
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:20,380
It's bad enough that I've got
all this paperwork

1015
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:23,350
that I have to deal with
because of this altercation.

1016
01:06:23,383 --> 01:06:27,622
Now, I've got the school board
questioning whether we need
safer weight stations.

1017
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,156
Safe weight stations?

1018
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:31,425
Don't ask.

1019
01:06:33,628 --> 01:06:36,931
Look, guys, I have rules
that I have to follow.

1020
01:06:36,965 --> 01:06:39,433
Those rules are
in place for a reason.

1021
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:43,237
Yeah, but we talked it out
and we're fine now.

1022
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,906
Well, good for you.

1023
01:06:44,939 --> 01:06:46,641
The two of you can go
hang out at the skate park

1024
01:06:46,674 --> 01:06:48,977
or whatever it is
that you do.

1025
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:52,079
Obviously, you two
have worked out your problems

1026
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:54,414
'cause you're sitting here
trying to do the right thing.

1027
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:58,686
I see you,
but I just can't change
policy on your word.

1028
01:06:59,988 --> 01:07:02,122
Coach, what have you got
to say about this?

1029
01:07:05,693 --> 01:07:07,060
I'm gonna be honest here.

1030
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:10,497
These two have butted heads
since I've known them.

1031
01:07:10,532 --> 01:07:13,033
I'm surprised it took them
this long to throw down.

1032
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:17,104
Whatever beef they had,
these two have worked it out

1033
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:19,172
and they're trying
to move forward.

1034
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:20,340
And Ms. Pittman,

1035
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:23,410
if that's not what
we're trying to teach

1036
01:07:23,443 --> 01:07:27,515
and encourage out here,
then what are we doing?

1037
01:07:53,407 --> 01:07:55,442
All right team, listen up.

1038
01:07:59,346 --> 01:08:01,315
I've got some news.

1039
01:08:01,348 --> 01:08:04,217
I want you to hear
it from me before you hear
it in the halls.

1040
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:06,688
Philips...

1041
01:08:09,156 --> 01:08:10,692
Uh...

1042
01:08:12,225 --> 01:08:13,393
Zachary...

1043
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:19,701
tried to commit
suicide last night.

1044
01:08:24,606 --> 01:08:28,076
Is he, uh... is he okay?

1045
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:30,912
He was in the hospital,
Creef.

1046
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:34,849
But I understand
he's home now.

1047
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:36,584
I don't have
a lot of details.

1048
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:40,755
Philips was
a part of our team.

1049
01:08:42,523 --> 01:08:44,559
Though he didn't always
get a fair shake from us.

1050
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:49,864
He might have quit us,
but we are not going
to quit him.

1051
01:08:49,897 --> 01:08:53,233
I fully support and encourage

1052
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:55,103
any member of the team

1053
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,105
who wants to go
and check up on him.

1054
01:08:58,773 --> 01:09:03,176
I think we owe it
to him, don't you?

1055
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:09,117
We're gonna go, Coach.
We'll go right now.

1056
01:09:10,084 --> 01:09:11,119
Let's go.

1057
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,944
Hello? May I help you?

1058
01:09:36,978 --> 01:09:39,113
Hi, we were wondering
if we can visit with Zach?

1059
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,283
Sure, come on in.
He's resting out back.

1060
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:56,631
-Hey, Zach.
-Hey.

1061
01:09:56,664 --> 01:09:58,398
What are you guys doing here?

1062
01:09:58,432 --> 01:10:01,769
-Oh, God, Zach, are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1063
01:10:01,803 --> 01:10:03,638
Been better,
but definitely been worse.

1064
01:10:03,671 --> 01:10:06,440
Good. Now what the heck
is wrong with you?

1065
01:10:06,473 --> 01:10:07,474
Carla.

1066
01:10:07,508 --> 01:10:08,843
Not now.

1067
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:11,145
It's okay.
I'm sorry, Carla. I--

1068
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,581
I kind of got lost
in my own head.

1069
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:17,451
I was scared
and I didn't really
think it through.

1070
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:19,486
I didn't think at all.

1071
01:10:20,988 --> 01:10:22,590
I'm kind of surprised
you guys are here.

1072
01:10:22,623 --> 01:10:24,192
I-- I quit.

1073
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,927
Well, the team didn't quit
on you, man.

1074
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:32,265
I've been through
this a couple times,
so I'll just get right to it.

1075
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:34,035
It was pills.

1076
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:35,870
I had to get my stomach pumped,
which I do not recommend,

1077
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:37,638
but I won't be doing
this again either.

1078
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:40,541
But I'm gonna be seeing
a shrink for a little while,

1079
01:10:40,575 --> 01:10:41,876
but she's cool.

1080
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,378
Um, it was her idea
to actually come out

1081
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:47,481
and relax
and meditate outside more,

1082
01:10:47,515 --> 01:10:49,617
which I think
she's right about.

1083
01:10:51,485 --> 01:10:52,887
Why'd you do it, man?

1084
01:10:53,654 --> 01:10:55,422
Are you asking
if it was 'cause of you?

1085
01:10:58,092 --> 01:11:00,862
I mean, you didn't help.

1086
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:06,801
You were just saying
all those things I was already
telling myself every day.

1087
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:09,203
And believe me,
I'm a lot meaner
than you could ever be.

1088
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:16,309
I-- I joined wrestling
'cause I wanted to prove
those voices wrong.

1089
01:11:17,845 --> 01:11:21,082
I wanted to be
bigger and stronger
than I was on the inside.

1090
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,652
Like Randy Savage
or Andre the Giant.

1091
01:11:24,685 --> 01:11:26,386
You know, those guys
were my heroes.

1092
01:11:26,419 --> 01:11:28,723
They're unstoppable.
They're larger than life.

1093
01:11:28,756 --> 01:11:32,727
But I'm not
those guys, I'm just me.

1094
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,629
Which, that's okay.

1095
01:11:35,763 --> 01:11:37,965
Look, man, I'm sorry.

1096
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:41,501
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

1097
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:45,106
You know,
you reminded me of myself
before I joined the team

1098
01:11:45,139 --> 01:11:48,776
and in order for me
to get into the right mindset,

1099
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,746
I had to Stone Cold myself,

1100
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:54,215
and I thought
that's what you needed,

1101
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:56,784
but I guess I was wrong.

1102
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:00,755
Look man, I know
I was a pain in the ass,

1103
01:12:00,788 --> 01:12:03,323
but I've been figuring out
a lot lately.

1104
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,196
When you want to come back,
we'll set things right.

1105
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:33,321
Eyes right, Nighthawks.

1106
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,056
This is where
we make it or break it.

1107
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,192
All right, listen up.

1108
01:12:39,327 --> 01:12:42,495
We've had a hell
of a road to get here,

1109
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,234
but now we've made it
and we're gonna make
some noise!

1110
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:49,637
You're with me?

1111
01:12:50,638 --> 01:12:52,607
We're not the biggest team,

1112
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:54,942
but nobody
is judging us on that.

1113
01:12:54,976 --> 01:12:57,578
They judge us
by the fight we bring.

1114
01:12:58,646 --> 01:13:00,915
So for us
to come out on top,

1115
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:05,485
all of you are going to have
to win and keep winning.

1116
01:13:06,486 --> 01:13:09,824
Each and every one
of you are champions.

1117
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:12,093
You know it, I know it.

1118
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:13,761
Now let's go
bring them the news!

1119
01:13:15,296 --> 01:13:16,964
Let's get it done!

1120
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:03,811
Denton is no joke.
You've gotta bring it.

1121
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:04,979
How do you feel?

1122
01:14:06,047 --> 01:14:09,984
-Nervous, Coach.
-Chris Torres nervous?

1123
01:14:10,017 --> 01:14:12,320
I never thought
I'd live to see that day.

1124
01:14:12,353 --> 01:14:14,355
I've come so far.
I've gotta win.

1125
01:14:14,388 --> 01:14:16,857
-I can't mess it up.
-Then don't.

1126
01:14:16,891 --> 01:14:18,693
And you're right,
you have come a long way

1127
01:14:18,726 --> 01:14:20,895
because you know
what you're doing.

1128
01:14:20,928 --> 01:14:23,030
You're in control out there.

1129
01:14:23,064 --> 01:14:24,966
So keep it simple.
Nothing flashy.

1130
01:14:26,267 --> 01:14:27,368
Okay.

1131
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,873
Hey, Mrs. Torres.
This is gonna be great.

1132
01:14:32,907 --> 01:14:35,776
I hope so.
I'm so nervous for the kids.

1133
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,578
Don't worry.
We qualified six wrestlers.

1134
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:39,447
We got a shot
at a championship.

1135
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:41,382
They just have to keep winning
and racking up team points.

1136
01:14:41,415 --> 01:14:42,850
Are you going to wrestle?

1137
01:14:42,883 --> 01:14:44,885
Didn't qualify,
but I'm sticking with it.

1138
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:47,355
-Next year's my year.
-Good for you.

1139
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:50,257
Look, here we go.

1140
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:57,164
All right, Chris,
you got this.

1141
01:14:58,799 --> 01:15:00,134
Come on, Chris!

1142
01:15:02,937 --> 01:15:04,372
Whoo, go!

1143
01:15:07,608 --> 01:15:10,011
Down, down.

1144
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,251
Down.

1145
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:19,320
There it is.
Keep your head up.

1146
01:15:22,156 --> 01:15:25,059
We had two,
takedown, red.

1147
01:15:25,092 --> 01:15:27,294
Two, near fall, red.

1148
01:15:28,262 --> 01:15:30,831
Two, reversal, green.

1149
01:15:30,865 --> 01:15:33,901
Three, near fall, green.

1150
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:35,136
End of period.

1151
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:36,670
How's it going?

1152
01:15:36,704 --> 01:15:38,572
-What'd I miss?
-Less than a minute to go.

1153
01:15:38,606 --> 01:15:40,141
Keeps this guy down,
he wins.

1154
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:41,675
He's got this.

1155
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:43,744
Bottom man, set.
- Come on, Chris.

1156
01:15:43,778 --> 01:15:45,012
Top man, on.

1157
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:05,332
Blood time, red.

1158
01:16:12,173 --> 01:16:14,108
You're doing great.

1159
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:17,111
All right, keep it simple.
Keep him down.

1160
01:16:17,144 --> 01:16:19,880
-Nothing fancy.
-Where's the fun in that?

1161
01:16:27,522 --> 01:16:30,357
Bottom man, set.
Top man, on.

1162
01:16:53,013 --> 01:16:54,682
Blood time, red.

1163
01:16:54,715 --> 01:16:55,883
Go see your coach.

1164
01:17:13,868 --> 01:17:16,470
Bottom man, set.
Top man, on.

1165
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:46,967
Way to go, Chris!

1166
01:17:54,108 --> 01:17:56,243
He's not half bad
when he's not trying
to show off.

1167
01:17:56,277 --> 01:17:58,412
Keeps up with this,
you'll have to stop calling
him Showboat.

1168
01:17:58,445 --> 01:18:00,615
No, I have to remind him
where he came from.

1169
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:02,617
Way to go, Chris, solid.

1170
01:18:04,451 --> 01:18:05,486
Good job.

1171
01:18:15,597 --> 01:18:16,997
All right, come on, Marcus.

1172
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,368
Keep your head up.

1173
01:18:24,138 --> 01:18:25,739
Don't lose balance, come on!

1174
01:18:27,942 --> 01:18:29,343
All right, good, Marcus.

1175
01:18:32,046 --> 01:18:34,315
Smarter and faster, Jack.
You got this.

1176
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,888
All right, come on, Jack.

1177
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:48,095
Keep it up,
that's the position.

1178
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:52,433
Yes, go, go!

1179
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,854
All right, Nighthawks,
listen up.

1180
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:18,192
Welcome to day two
of the state championships.

1181
01:19:19,193 --> 01:19:22,196
I have the standings after
the first day of competition.

1182
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:28,570
Adding up the points,
we are in second place
going in to today!

1183
01:19:30,437 --> 01:19:32,574
All right,
we may not be the biggest,

1184
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,309
but we are definitely giving
them a run for the best.

1185
01:19:35,342 --> 01:19:38,747
Now you go out there,
and you show 'em what
the Nighthawks are made of.

1186
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:41,148
All right,
let's go, come on!

1187
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:42,883
Let's win it! We got this!

1188
01:19:48,556 --> 01:19:52,092
That's Carmack. He's a long,
lean, wrestling machine.

1189
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,362
He's precise
and he makes no mistakes.

1190
01:19:55,396 --> 01:19:59,166
So you go in there,
and you go in there
aggressive from the start.

1191
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,334
Keep him guessing.

1192
01:20:06,775 --> 01:20:08,976
-Let's go, Chris.
-Come on, Chris.

1193
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:12,079
Wrestlers ready?
Shake hands.

1194
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:21,690
Two, takedown, red.

1195
01:20:30,064 --> 01:20:31,666
One, escape, green.

1196
01:20:35,836 --> 01:20:37,806
Two, takedown, green.

1197
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:55,623
One, escape, red.

1198
01:21:01,995 --> 01:21:04,766
All right, Torres.
Let's get a takedown.

1199
01:21:18,112 --> 01:21:21,616
Not the Kortezki, Torres!
No, no, no, no, no!

1200
01:21:23,317 --> 01:21:24,351
No!

1201
01:21:31,191 --> 01:21:32,660
Chris can't lose.

1202
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:44,004
Yes!

1203
01:21:58,252 --> 01:22:01,288
I told you not
to do that move. Why...

1204
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:11,165
-What just happened?
-He lost.

1205
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:12,966
That was his last chance
to get into Navy.

1206
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,570
I'm gonna go try
to find him.

1207
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:17,504
Jack, will you keep
an eye on Michael, please?

1208
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:20,542
-Sure thing, Mrs. Torres.
-He lost? He can't lose.

1209
01:22:20,575 --> 01:22:21,942
He's not supposed to lose.

1210
01:22:41,629 --> 01:22:44,732
-I don't wanna talk.
-Neither do I.

1211
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:49,069
How about I just sit here
beside you, if that's okay?

1212
01:22:59,379 --> 01:23:01,583
I know this has been
a hard year on you,

1213
01:23:01,616 --> 01:23:04,652
and this-- this isn't what
you've been working for.

1214
01:23:05,653 --> 01:23:07,522
Yeah, no one sets out
to be a loser.

1215
01:23:08,756 --> 01:23:10,692
You're not a loser, Chris.

1216
01:23:10,725 --> 01:23:13,728
You're here in the arena
making things happen.

1217
01:23:13,761 --> 01:23:17,732
I don't know anyone
who has worked as hard
for something they've wanted.

1218
01:23:17,765 --> 01:23:19,968
Well, my path stops here.
It's over.

1219
01:23:20,935 --> 01:23:23,203
Nothing is over
until you give up.

1220
01:23:24,839 --> 01:23:27,775
You have been so focused
on this state championship

1221
01:23:27,809 --> 01:23:30,979
that you don't even realize
what you've actually achieved.

1222
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:33,180
You may not see it,
but I do.

1223
01:23:34,983 --> 01:23:39,119
At the beginning
of the season, the coach
made you team captain.

1224
01:23:39,152 --> 01:23:42,590
You didn't want it, but now,
at all of the matches,

1225
01:23:42,624 --> 01:23:44,291
who's running
up and down the line

1226
01:23:44,324 --> 01:23:46,493
cheering everyone on
and giving advice?

1227
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:51,766
You used to sit off
to the side until it was
your time to shine,

1228
01:23:51,799 --> 01:23:53,968
and now you're
right in the thick of it.

1229
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:56,503
Yeah, it's a lot more fun
than I thought would be.

1230
01:23:56,538 --> 01:23:58,573
Which makes it
even more impressive.

1231
01:23:59,674 --> 01:24:03,645
You have persisted
despite all the crap
that's been thrown at you.

1232
01:24:03,678 --> 01:24:07,247
West Point,
breaking up with Lisa,

1233
01:24:07,281 --> 01:24:09,349
getting suspended.

1234
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:13,821
And to top it all off,
you and Marcus are
thick as thieves.

1235
01:24:13,855 --> 01:24:17,090
I mean, you've been
at each other's throats
since freshman year.

1236
01:24:17,124 --> 01:24:19,928
-How does that even happen?
-Not with cherry soda.

1237
01:24:20,962 --> 01:24:23,031
I don't know
what that means,

1238
01:24:23,063 --> 01:24:26,466
but what I do know
is that you've got
one more match to win.

1239
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:30,504
Your solo shot
may be done, but your team
needs you, Chris.

1240
01:24:30,538 --> 01:24:31,706
Your team.

1241
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:36,878
They're counting on you,
depending on you.

1242
01:24:36,911 --> 01:24:39,179
With you, they can win.

1243
01:24:39,212 --> 01:24:41,448
State champion
is just a title.

1244
01:24:41,481 --> 01:24:43,651
They give it out every year.

1245
01:24:43,685 --> 01:24:46,554
Real champions,
they earn the rank.

1246
01:24:47,922 --> 01:24:50,558
They set an example,
a standard,

1247
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:54,696
and he beats all the odds
no matter what the cost.

1248
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,400
You ready to go kick
some ass, kid?

1249
01:25:04,038 --> 01:25:07,474
All right, you two,
pity party's over.

1250
01:25:07,508 --> 01:25:10,310
You've still got
a shot at third place

1251
01:25:10,344 --> 01:25:13,915
and it's an old friend
of yours, Eric Sutter.

1252
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:16,551
You've got 45 minutes.
So get ready.

1253
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:19,453
Kid Hulk.

1254
01:25:20,722 --> 01:25:23,591
Kid Hulk?
Is that what he calls himself?

1255
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:26,527
If he wants to be Kid Hulk,

1256
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:30,598
then you go in there bigger,
better, stronger and louder.

1257
01:25:30,632 --> 01:25:34,068
You go in there like a--
like a rock-and-roll Godzilla.

1258
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:38,438
I love rock and roll.

1259
01:26:30,091 --> 01:26:31,458
It's your time, Torres.

1260
01:26:43,004 --> 01:26:46,674
You've wrestled Sutter before,
so you know what to expect.

1261
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:48,241
Learn from it.

1262
01:26:48,275 --> 01:26:50,778
He can be beat
and you're going to do it.

1263
01:26:50,812 --> 01:26:52,747
We're gonna do it, Coach.
He stands in our way.

1264
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:55,482
Hell yeah, this one's
for the team. Now, bring it.

1265
01:26:55,516 --> 01:26:57,317
It's time
to rock and roll, Coach.

1266
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,088
Hell yeah, kid.
That's what I like to hear.

1267
01:27:06,828 --> 01:27:08,129
We're in second place.

1268
01:27:08,162 --> 01:27:10,263
If Chris wins,
we lock up first.

1269
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:12,166
Hey, you got this, dog.

1270
01:27:18,405 --> 01:27:19,707
Shake hands.

1271
01:27:25,646 --> 01:27:27,048
Two, takedown, green.

1272
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:33,688
One, escape, red, neutral.

1273
01:27:33,721 --> 01:27:35,223
Okay, Chris, you got this.

1274
01:27:40,494 --> 01:27:42,096
Let's go, Chris!

1275
01:27:55,076 --> 01:27:56,711
Top man, on.

1276
01:27:57,879 --> 01:27:59,547
You got this. Let's go!

1277
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,249
All right, Chris,
you got this.

1278
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,188
Two, reversal, green.

1279
01:28:16,429 --> 01:28:17,999
One, escape, red.

1280
01:28:31,078 --> 01:28:33,114
Two, takedown, green.

1281
01:28:33,147 --> 01:28:34,314
Keep your head up.

1282
01:28:35,448 --> 01:28:36,684
Fight for position.

1283
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:42,023
End of second period.

1284
01:28:43,224 --> 01:28:45,259
Blood time, red.
Set the clock.

1285
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:51,032
He's too quick.
I can't get wrist control.

1286
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:53,701
All right, I'm not gonna blow
sunshine up your ass.

1287
01:28:53,734 --> 01:28:56,270
All right, you're losing
and it's the final period.

1288
01:28:56,304 --> 01:28:58,539
Strategy is out, right?

1289
01:28:58,573 --> 01:29:00,942
Listen, Torres,
one of you is going to win.

1290
01:29:00,975 --> 01:29:03,443
-How bad do you want it?
-I'm not gonna quit.

1291
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:05,746
I have a plan B.

1292
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,815
If you pull out
the Kortezki V2--

1293
01:29:07,849 --> 01:29:10,084
Signature move
is signature weakness.
He's coming at me hard.

1294
01:29:10,117 --> 01:29:11,919
I'm gonna sucker him in,
when he's charging,

1295
01:29:11,953 --> 01:29:13,721
I'm gonna roll back
and I'll end up a top.

1296
01:29:13,754 --> 01:29:15,455
Lateral drop, I love it.

1297
01:29:17,091 --> 01:29:19,193
- Come on, Chris!
- Let's go, Chris!

1298
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:26,100
Wrestle smart.

1299
01:29:36,143 --> 01:29:37,245
Fight for position.

1300
01:29:43,017 --> 01:29:44,417
Get off your knees, Chris!

1301
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:58,465
One, two three...

1302
01:29:58,498 --> 01:30:00,801
four, five.

1303
01:30:00,835 --> 01:30:02,970
Two takedown, red,
holding three.

1304
01:30:03,004 --> 01:30:04,038
There it is.

1305
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:08,776
Yeah!

1306
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:13,347
Yes, yes, Chris!

1307
01:30:31,198 --> 01:30:33,901
-Now that was a plan B.
-Congratulations, Torres!

1308
01:30:33,935 --> 01:30:35,903
We did it!
We're state champs!

1309
01:30:38,105 --> 01:30:39,140
Here.

1310
01:30:47,048 --> 01:30:48,416
That was amazing.

1311
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,051
Congratulations.

1312
01:31:07,101 --> 01:31:09,603
I know you've been waiting
all season for this.

1313
01:31:10,638 --> 01:31:11,672
Nice, Mom.

1314
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,744
Mm.

1315
01:31:24,452 --> 01:31:25,553
Thanks, Mom.

1316
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:43,104
That was awesome.
The way you flip rolled that
guy and got on top of him.

1317
01:31:43,137 --> 01:31:44,605
Like out
of a fighting game.

1318
01:31:44,638 --> 01:31:46,874
Yeah, it's a lot more fun
than a game.

1319
01:31:47,908 --> 01:31:48,976
It's real life.

1320
01:31:51,145 --> 01:31:54,715
To get into Naval Academy,
I have to be a state champ,
which I'm not.

1321
01:31:54,749 --> 01:31:57,018
I need
a congressional nomination,
which I don't have.

1322
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:00,554
You are captain of
the state championship team.

1323
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:02,890
You're also
third in the state,
which is amazing.

1324
01:32:02,923 --> 01:32:04,658
That should count
for something.

1325
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:06,427
And you're
my favorite brother.

1326
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:08,329
Thanks. You're mine, too.

1327
01:32:08,362 --> 01:32:09,797
You two are so cute.

1328
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,499
So Paul called,

1329
01:32:11,532 --> 01:32:14,235
said that he had a student
back out this Saturday

1330
01:32:14,268 --> 01:32:16,937
and he's free if you
wanna go in for a lesson.

1331
01:32:16,971 --> 01:32:19,073
That's okay.
I'll take the weekend off.

1332
01:32:19,106 --> 01:32:21,008
I think I've earned it.

1333
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:22,743
Yeah, but you're
so close to finishing.
You might as well.

1334
01:32:22,777 --> 01:32:24,678
I am, but you're the one
saying we're on a budget, Mom.

1335
01:32:24,712 --> 01:32:26,647
I can't keep putting
extra lessons
on the credit card.

1336
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:29,950
Well, sometimes we can make
exceptions with the budget.

1337
01:32:29,984 --> 01:32:33,587
And it was Paul who called,
so maybe he's willing
to waive the fee.

1338
01:32:33,621 --> 01:32:35,956
That doesn't sound right.
Are you sure it was Paul?

1339
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:40,161
Yes, I'm sure.
And I already told him
you would go, so go.

1340
01:32:40,194 --> 01:32:42,730
-Mom, what's going on?
-Nothing.

1341
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:45,499
Just do
what she wants, dude.

1342
01:32:45,534 --> 01:32:47,601
It's safer that way.
Trust me.

1343
01:33:00,214 --> 01:33:03,617
-Hey Paul, what's going on?
-You got a meeting.

1344
01:33:03,651 --> 01:33:07,388
Oh, Mom said
you were gonna give me
an extra lesson today.

1345
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:09,890
Give? You should have seen
right through that, kid.

1346
01:33:09,924 --> 01:33:12,426
Nine times outta ten,
I don't give a crap.

1347
01:33:13,727 --> 01:33:14,962
You got a meeting.

1348
01:33:27,775 --> 01:33:31,245
-Um, hello?
-It's all right, Maggie.

1349
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:34,915
This is Mr. Torres.
We have an appointment.

1350
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:37,084
-I'm Senator--
-Senator Kayla Williams.

1351
01:33:37,118 --> 01:33:39,053
-And we do?
-Yes.

1352
01:33:39,086 --> 01:33:42,524
I'm not one for surprises,
but Paul insisted otherwise.

1353
01:33:42,557 --> 01:33:44,725
-And you know Paul?
-Oh, of course.

1354
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:46,427
We went
to high school together.

1355
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:49,196
Paul always flies me
around the Outer Banks

1356
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:51,065
when I make the trip
out here.

1357
01:33:51,098 --> 01:33:53,334
I don't trust anyone else.

1358
01:33:53,367 --> 01:33:56,070
He says you're coming along
as quite the pilot yourself.

1359
01:33:56,103 --> 01:33:58,272
Yes ma'am,
or um, Senator Williams.

1360
01:33:58,305 --> 01:34:00,241
Ma'am is fine.

1361
01:34:00,274 --> 01:34:03,344
I understand you know
your local history as well.

1362
01:34:03,377 --> 01:34:05,412
Care to give me a tour?

1363
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:07,516
-Um, sure.
-Okay.

1364
01:34:09,383 --> 01:34:11,185
This is the VF-17
Jolly Roger.

1365
01:34:11,218 --> 01:34:14,623
One of the greatest Naval
fighter squadrons in history.

1366
01:34:14,655 --> 01:34:15,990
And this guy right here...

1367
01:34:16,891 --> 01:34:18,859
Ray Beacham,
the Kitty Hawk Kid.

1368
01:34:18,893 --> 01:34:21,729
He was raised by his grandma
in Kitty Hawk.

1369
01:34:21,762 --> 01:34:23,764
And after a mission
he would return home

1370
01:34:23,797 --> 01:34:26,635
and buzz by her house
just to let her know
that he was okay.

1371
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:29,770
I'm sure
that about gave her
a heart attack.

1372
01:34:29,803 --> 01:34:32,806
No, she loved it,
and that way she always knew
that he was home safe.

1373
01:34:34,341 --> 01:34:37,612
Ah, affairs of state
wait for no one.

1374
01:34:37,646 --> 01:34:41,982
Um, I'm due down in Hatteras
to address the recent flooding.

1375
01:34:42,016 --> 01:34:45,753
So let's get down
to business, shall we?

1376
01:34:45,786 --> 01:34:48,289
I understand there was
a mix-up in my office

1377
01:34:48,322 --> 01:34:50,991
with a nomination
for West Point.

1378
01:34:51,025 --> 01:34:54,228
-Yes ma'am.
-Well, I am sorry.

1379
01:34:54,261 --> 01:34:59,066
We do our best,
but even we make mistakes
every now and again.

1380
01:34:59,099 --> 01:35:00,768
How is your senior year
going?

1381
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:02,970
My grades are solid,
straight A's,

1382
01:35:03,003 --> 01:35:05,640
and my high school
wrestling team just won
the state championship.

1383
01:35:05,674 --> 01:35:08,610
I recall hearing
something about that.

1384
01:35:08,643 --> 01:35:11,478
You were team captain, yes?

1385
01:35:11,513 --> 01:35:14,081
That seems like
it was quite challenging.

1386
01:35:14,114 --> 01:35:17,418
Yes, ma'am.
It was a bumpy ride,
but I sorted it out.

1387
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:21,922
Mm. Any position of leadership
is a bit of a rollercoaster.

1388
01:35:21,956 --> 01:35:25,159
Any words of wisdom
from your experience?

1389
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:27,995
Once I learned to put
the team before myself,

1390
01:35:28,028 --> 01:35:30,197
captain was just a title.

1391
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:33,133
They're my team.
We're all different,
but we're all in it together.

1392
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:34,935
Yes.

1393
01:35:34,969 --> 01:35:38,439
So why do you want to go
to the Naval Academy, Chris?

1394
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:41,809
I used to think
it was because I wanted
to be like my father,

1395
01:35:41,842 --> 01:35:44,111
but that's something
a kid would say.

1396
01:35:44,144 --> 01:35:47,281
I want to go to
the Naval Academy because that's
something I want to do.

1397
01:35:47,314 --> 01:35:48,949
I believe
I have a lot to offer,

1398
01:35:48,983 --> 01:35:50,884
and the Navy is where
I'm best suited to do it.

1399
01:35:52,152 --> 01:35:53,887
Are you sure?

1400
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:57,157
Sounds like you should
go into politics.

1401
01:35:57,191 --> 01:36:00,027
You'd have my vote.

1402
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:04,465
-Senator Williams.
-Yes, Maggie, I'm on my way.

1403
01:36:04,498 --> 01:36:07,368
I'm sorry about that.
Hatteras is anxious to know

1404
01:36:07,401 --> 01:36:09,571
what we're gonna do
about their roads.

1405
01:36:09,604 --> 01:36:12,806
Um, I have a free day
tomorrow,

1406
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:16,578
so I should be able to look
into this matter for you.

1407
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:19,213
-Would that be all right?
-Yes, ma'am.

1408
01:36:19,246 --> 01:36:21,516
It was a pleasure
to meet you, Chris Torres.

1409
01:36:21,549 --> 01:36:23,150
You as well,
Senator Williams.

1410
01:36:35,597 --> 01:36:37,565
-How'd it go?
-Thanks, Paul.

1411
01:36:38,566 --> 01:36:39,768
Call me, Digger.

1412
01:37:07,094 --> 01:37:09,997
Hello, everyone.
Thanks for coming, everybody.

1413
01:37:11,265 --> 01:37:14,268
I wanna say I'm sorry that
it took nearly three weeks

1414
01:37:14,301 --> 01:37:16,103
to put this dinner
together,

1415
01:37:16,136 --> 01:37:20,140
but championship rings
don't grow on trees.

1416
01:37:27,314 --> 01:37:30,518
We had a dynamic year,

1417
01:37:31,352 --> 01:37:34,221
and I want to thank
all of you for that.

1418
01:37:34,254 --> 01:37:38,626
Each of you brought something
to this team that we needed.

1419
01:37:39,493 --> 01:37:41,495
And we wouldn't have gotten
here without you.

1420
01:37:42,797 --> 01:37:46,801
So I have
some awards to hand out.

1421
01:37:46,835 --> 01:37:48,670
But first,
we'll hand out the rings.

1422
01:37:48,703 --> 01:37:50,337
Now, we're gonna do
this alphabetically,

1423
01:37:50,371 --> 01:37:52,239
so everyone bear with me.

1424
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:56,678
All right, man.

1425
01:37:57,878 --> 01:37:59,346
It's your turn.

1426
01:38:00,815 --> 01:38:02,082
Look at that beauty.

1427
01:38:06,053 --> 01:38:08,489
Congratulations.
Look at that monster.

1428
01:38:10,224 --> 01:38:11,425
Congratulations.

1429
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:24,338
There it is.
Congratulations.

1430
01:38:30,678 --> 01:38:32,913
Congratulations.
Good job, man.

1431
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:40,921
Okay, everybody, and now
for our two graduating seniors.

1432
01:38:42,557 --> 01:38:44,124
Marcus Zelinski.

1433
01:38:46,994 --> 01:38:49,163
I have worked with you

1434
01:38:49,196 --> 01:38:52,232
for four years
of Nighthawks wrestling,

1435
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:55,469
and Marcus, I can honestly
say I've never seen you
achieve more

1436
01:38:55,502 --> 01:38:59,039
on or off the mat
than you have this year.

1437
01:38:59,674 --> 01:39:02,242
So come up here
and accept this certificate

1438
01:39:02,276 --> 01:39:04,646
for four years
of outstanding wrestling

1439
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:06,380
and contribution to a team.

1440
01:39:07,916 --> 01:39:09,149
Good job, buddy.

1441
01:39:18,593 --> 01:39:22,196
And our other graduating
senior,

1442
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:24,732
Chris Torres.

1443
01:39:24,766 --> 01:39:28,603
Chris also gave us
four years of dynamic
Nighthawks wrestling.

1444
01:39:29,904 --> 01:39:33,006
Oh, boy,
there is so much more
I could say about that.

1445
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:38,746
However, it is my honor
to turn over this part
of the ceremony

1446
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:42,382
to retired Marine Corps
Colonel Hank Mills,

1447
01:39:42,416 --> 01:39:45,854
the Navy Blue & Gold Officer
for Eastern North Carolina.

1448
01:39:51,926 --> 01:39:53,928
Thank you, Coach Kelvin.

1449
01:39:53,962 --> 01:39:56,564
Coach here
has been kind enough
to allow me the privilege

1450
01:39:56,598 --> 01:39:58,365
to present this certificate

1451
01:39:58,398 --> 01:40:00,434
for four years
of outstanding wrestling,

1452
01:40:00,467 --> 01:40:01,970
and contribution
to the team.

1453
01:40:03,103 --> 01:40:04,939
It also gives me
great pleasure

1454
01:40:04,973 --> 01:40:08,141
to present this letter
to you.

1455
01:40:10,177 --> 01:40:11,278
"Chris Torres.

1456
01:40:12,246 --> 01:40:15,048
On behalf
of the superintendent,
you are hereby offered

1457
01:40:15,082 --> 01:40:18,118
an appointment
to the United States
Naval Academy."

1458
01:40:19,787 --> 01:40:21,656
"If you accept
this appointment,

1459
01:40:21,689 --> 01:40:24,659
you will be issued a permit
to report in June of this year,

1460
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,597
where you will become part
of the Brigade of Midshipmen."

1461
01:40:35,937 --> 01:40:38,873
What do you think, young man?
Is this an acceptable offer?

1462
01:40:40,008 --> 01:40:44,044
Torres, Torres,
Torres, Torres!

1463
01:40:56,991 --> 01:40:59,827
All right, let's get everyone
up here for a team photo.

1464
01:41:01,963 --> 01:41:03,263
Congrats, dog.

1465
01:41:04,566 --> 01:41:06,166
Couldn't have done it
without me.

1466
01:41:25,820 --> 01:41:29,423
"Arise, fair sun,
kill the envious moon."

1467
01:41:31,358 --> 01:41:35,262
-Nice day for a run.
-It is. Beach is empty.

1468
01:41:36,598 --> 01:41:38,498
Congratulations
on your win this weekend.

1469
01:41:38,533 --> 01:41:40,233
Scored the most points
for the team.

1470
01:41:40,267 --> 01:41:41,435
You heard about that, huh?

1471
01:41:42,704 --> 01:41:46,273
I might have
been in the stands,
paying off an old debt.

1472
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:49,577
Better late than never,
I suppose.

1473
01:41:49,611 --> 01:41:51,111
Something like that.

1474
01:41:52,212 --> 01:41:54,348
Congrats to you as well.

1475
01:41:54,381 --> 01:41:56,483
State champion
and heading to Annapolis?

1476
01:41:56,517 --> 01:41:58,318
I guess
your persistence paid off.

1477
01:41:58,352 --> 01:42:02,557
Eh. Came in third place.
The team came in first.

1478
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:05,225
We're all state champions.

1479
01:42:05,258 --> 01:42:07,394
They couldn't have done it
without you.

1480
01:42:07,427 --> 01:42:09,262
I couldn't have done it
without them.

1481
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:13,835
-When are you
getting shipped out?
-About three months, you?

1482
01:42:13,868 --> 01:42:15,168
Same.

1483
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:19,674
Got enough time for a race?

1484
01:42:21,075 --> 01:42:22,644
I think I could
squeeze one in.

1485
01:42:23,911 --> 01:42:25,647
-Pier?
-Sure.

1486
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:27,314
Okay.
