1
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,600
# Hang up the chick habit,
hang it up, Daddy #

2
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,300
# Or you'll be alone in a quick #

3
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,500
# Hang up the chick habit,
hang it up, Daddy #

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
# Or you'll never get another fix #

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,400
# I'm telling you it's not a trick,
pay attention, don't be thick #

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,100
# Or you're liable to get licked #

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,700
# You're gonna see the reason why #

8
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,100
# When they're spitting in your eye
they'll be spitting in your eye #

9
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,900
# Hang up the chick habit
hang it up, daddy #

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,900
# Your girl's not a tonic or a pill #

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,300
# Hang up your chick habit
hang it up, daddy #

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,100
# You're just jonesin' for a spill #

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,200
# Oh, how your bubble's gonna burst
when you meet another nurse #

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,900
# She'll be drivin' in a hearse #

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,100
# You're gonna need a heap of glue
when they all catch up with you #

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,800
# And they cut you up in two. #

17
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,300
Freemont power, Freemont pride.
Be aggressive, drive, drive, drive.

18
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,600
Freemont power, Freemont pride.

19
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,600
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

20
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,900
Freemont power, Freemont pride.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,300
Be aggressive, drive, drive, drive.

22
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Go Freemont!
(cheering)

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Okay, everybody,
tomorrow after classes

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,800
make sure that you have your uniforms
picked up from the dry cleaners,

25
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,100
because the bus for the playoffs
is gonna leave at 7:30 a.m.,

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,300
The next morning, all right?

27
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,700
- (sighing)
- Oh my God.

28
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,800
But the Doughnut Hole has agreed
to donate four dozen doughnuts.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
All: Yeah!

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,600
Okay, we're gonna kill
the Rangers this year, right?

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,700
All: Yeah!

32
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,900
I can't believe you're leaving.

33
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,600
It's just a couple of hours
before you go.

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,100
Yeah. Right.
Right.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,700
Aren't you excited?
It's playoffs!

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Yeah. Whatever.

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Come on.

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,000
I have to get home for dinner.

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,400
Please.

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Oh, all right.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,000
Father:
That's some beef.

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,300
- Mother: And carrots.
- Yummy.

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,200
Thank you, Mother.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Thanks.

45
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,400
- Thank you, poodle.
- Sure.

46
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,100
Grace.

47
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Father:
Dear Lord,

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,100
please bless this food
that we are about to eat.

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,800
We thank you for the abundance
that You have provided.

50
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,200
Please help us to follow Your path,

51
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,100
the one you intended us all to follow.

52
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,500
And Lord...

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,700
please help us to obey
the roles in life You set for us.

54
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,500
For all that is natural and...

55
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,000
healthy...

56
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,000
and sacred,

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,300
in Your name we pray.

58
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Amen.

59
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,600
- Amen.
- Let's eat.

60
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,400
(car horn honking)
Bye, dear.

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,400
See ya later, swee... I mean tonight.
See you tonight.

62
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Don't forget your
library books by the door.

63
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Got them. Bye.

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,900
So... are we ready?

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,100
They'll all be here at 3:00.

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,500
Jesus, I hope we're
doing the right thing.

67
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,700
(bell rings)

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,700
Shaker Hills, here we come.

69
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,300
Remember, 7:30 doughnuts.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,400
Boy: Did you talk
to both her parents?

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
- Girl: She's coming.
- Kill the Rangers.

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
I'll meet you outside.

73
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,700
Don't you hate it when they do that?

74
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
I think it's fun.

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Maybe he just doesn't do it right.

76
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
- See ya.
- Bye.

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
(horn honks)
Speed up, jerk!

78
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,700
Jared?

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,900
Why are we going so slow?

80
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,300
Sorry.
Zoning, I guess.

81
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,800
Mike, thanks so much for coming
all the way back out here again.

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
- That's what we're here for.
- Thank you, Mike.

83
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,100
- Now you've watched the video?
- Over and over.

84
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,000
Come in.

85
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
(horn honks)

86
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
Mike:
The important thing is to be clear.

87
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
And direct.

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,300
But to do it lovingly.

89
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,100
We're not accusing,

90
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,400
we're supporting.

91
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I think I hear the car.

92
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Uh-oh. Here they come.

93
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,900
Surprise.

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,200
What happened?
Is somebody dead?

95
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,100
They're your favorite.

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,900
Now, why don't you just
come on in and sit down, honey?

97
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,800
What's going on?

98
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
Hi, Megan.

99
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,300
My name is Mike.

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Your parents and your friends
want to have a conversation with you,

101
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,700
and I'm here to help
facilitate that dialogue.

102
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,100
So why don't we start
by sitting down,

103
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,600
and making ourselves
comfortable?

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
How would that be?

105
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,400
Now, Peter,

106
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,800
would you like to start
the conversation?

107
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,700
Megan, we love you.

108
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,200
We all love you.

109
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,900
And lately we've become
concerned about

110
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,200
certain behaviors.

111
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,500
We're afraid you're being
influenced by...

112
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,100
a way of thinking.

113
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Unnatural...

114
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you remember the woman on TV?

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
Honey, we think you're a...

116
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
(whispers)
Lesbian.

117
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,600
Huh?

118
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,700
I myself was once a gay.

119
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,200
Now I'm an ex-gay, Megan.

120
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,700
I work for a place
called True Directions

121
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,700
who help people, like yourself,

122
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,500
to learn to understand
the reasons behind

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,900
homosexual tendencies,

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,100
and how to heal them.

125
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,100
What tendencies?
Why would you think I'm a...

126
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,500
You've been trying
to make us eat this tofu.

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
In diet, watch for a switch to

128
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,300
vegetarianism.

129
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,100
You don't have any pictures
of guys in your locker,

130
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,500
just these.

131
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,300
Mm-hmm.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,600
And these.

133
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,900
Sexual,

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,900
even vaginal motifs
in artwork and decorating.

135
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,900
Gay iconography.

136
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,600
You don't even like to kiss me.

137
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
It's true.

138
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,100
I can't believe this.

139
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,200
Denial is a normal part
of the healing process

140
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,400
that we'll explore

141
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,800
at True Directions.

142
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,800
- Healing?
- Like rehab, honey.

143
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,000
Homosexuals Anonymous.

144
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,700
Poodle, it's only for a few months.

145
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,600
There is no way I'm going.

146
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
Mother: Let's go.

147
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,100
Now.

148
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,300
Welcome, welcome,
welcome.

149
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
I'm Mary,
I'm the founder of True Directions.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
- And you must be Megan?
- Yes.

151
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
- This is my son, Rock.
- Mother: Hi.

152
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Pleasure to meet you, Megan.

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,000
Looks like we got you just in time.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,600
What are you, about 17?

155
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,200
- Yes.
- Almost lost her to college.

156
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
It's so much harder
once they've been through

157
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,600
all that liberal arts brainwashing.

158
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,900
But we've saved a few.

159
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll take her from here.

160
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Well. Come along.

161
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,200
Mother:
They seem like nice people.

162
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
(car starts)

163
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
(honks)

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,500
The others arrived yesterday,
so why don't I catch you up?

165
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
It's a two-month program
based on five simple steps.

166
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,000
Why don't we concentrate
on the first step:

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,800
You admitting your problem.

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
When you see a woman,

169
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,300
in a tight skirt,

170
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,200
and long,

171
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,800
beautiful legs,

172
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,200
or perhaps
she's in the bathroom,

173
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
putting lipstick
over her full lips...

174
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,100
or maybe in the locker room,

175
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,900
soaping her body...

176
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,300
rubbing her breasts...

177
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
you don't have any
unnatural thoughts?

178
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,200
I don't think it's unnatural.

179
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,700
Ah-ha! You see?

180
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,000
You don't even think it's wrong.

181
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,900
Until you admit your sickness,
you will wear these.

182
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
You will earn the right
to wear civvies

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,400
once you have admitted

184
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
the first step.

185
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,900
It's a long path
to righteousness, Megan.

186
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,000
And it's a battlefield
of temptation out there,

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and you're going
to have to fight.

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,300
Until then,

189
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,800
I'd like you to meet
one of our other soldiers.

190
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,200
Hilary.

191
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,600
Megan, this is Hilary.

192
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,500
She will show you around.

193
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,000
And, well, you'll get acquainted.

194
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Okay.
Rise and shine at 7:00.

195
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,100
Breakfast at 8:00,

196
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:19,100
Group therapy until lunch.

197
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,800
Now in the afternoon
we have free time to do,

198
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,300
you know, whatever,
and then we move inside

199
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,300
for reorientating exercises.

200
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,100
Family therapy on the weekends.

201
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,600
You didn't miss much, really.

202
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,100
Oh.

203
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,900
This is where we sleep.

204
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,700
But there's no inappropriate
behavior allowed.

205
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,200
Inappropriate?

206
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
Like swearing?

207
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,700
No. Inappropriate like fucking.

208
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Oh.

209
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,100
You get caught
in the throes of sodomy,

210
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,400
and au revoir.

211
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,300
Never mind Graham,
she's a spoiled brat.

212
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,300
I read her chart.

213
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,600
Step one was easy,

214
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,000
admitting you're a homosexual.

215
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,300
See, we all passed yesterday.

216
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,200
I'm a homosexual.

217
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
See how easy it is?

218
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,300
Megan, meet the rest of our group.

219
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,700
Hi, Megan.

220
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,100
I'm Jan,
and I'm a softball player,

221
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,900
and I'm a homosexual.

222
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,100
I'm Sinead.
I like pain.

223
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm a homosexual.

224
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm Joel.
I'm a Jew.

225
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,700
And a...

226
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,200
ho...

227
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,300
homosexual.

228
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,600
- We met.
- Graham.

229
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm Graham, and I like girls,

230
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
a lot.

231
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,200
I'm a homosexual.

232
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Andre.
Actor. Dancer.

233
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Homosexual.

234
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,900
Dolph. Homosexual.
Varsity wrestler.

235
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,000
How you doin'?

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,700
Hi. I'm Clayton Dunn.
I work in retail,

237
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
and I'm a homosexual.

238
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,500
It's time for your first disclosure.

239
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,800
Now don't be intimidated.

240
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,300
Why don't you start by telling us

241
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,000
about the first time that you realized
that you might be a lesbian?

242
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
I'm not.

243
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,800
Everyone just thinks I am.

244
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,700
I shouldn't even be here.

245
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,400
That's a perfectly
normal place to start.

246
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Why don't we discuss
the issues in your intervention?

247
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,500
I'm a vegetarian.

248
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,900
All: Mm-hmm.

249
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,800
I have pictures of women around.

250
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,700
- You think that's normal?
- Sure.

251
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,400
I never really thought about it.

252
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,100
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

253
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Yes. For two years
we've been going steady.

254
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,300
I really love him.
He's smart and popular.

255
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
He's got the biggest dick
I've never seen.

256
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Well, um...

257
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,400
have you ever had sex with him?

258
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm a Christian.

259
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,200
It's really easy to be a prude
when you're not attracted to him, isn't it?

260
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,000
He's very handsome.

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,700
But does he make you hot?

262
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,500
Do you think of him
at night when you...

263
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm not perverted.

264
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I get good grades.
I go to church.

265
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm a cheerleader.

266
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm not like all of you.

267
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,400
Everyone reads "Cosmo."
Everyone looks at other girls.

268
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
All the time.

269
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,100
You only assume that they're thinking
what you're thinking when they look.

270
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,900
But they're not.

271
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Freemont power. Freemont pride.

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Be aggressive.
Drive, drive, drive.

273
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,400
Go Freemont!

274
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,900
I thought everybody
had those thoughts.

275
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,900
I just want to be normal.

276
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,200
Then you admit
you're not normal.

277
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,100
So why don't you admit

278
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,700
you are a homosexual?

279
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
(voices echoing)

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,500
Both:
You hug us way too much.

281
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,400
Hilary:
Step one was easy.

282
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,300
You don't even like to kiss me.

283
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,300
You put your hand up my skirt.

284
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,000
- Homosexual
- I think it's foul.

285
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

286
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,500
- Homosexual.
- Homosexual.

287
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,900
I'm a homosexual.

288
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm a homosexual.
I'm a homosexual.

289
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,500
Congratulations, Megan.

290
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,800
You have just taken your first step

291
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,100
in your true direction!

292
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,800
(clapping)

293
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
I'm a homosexual.

294
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Okay.

295
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,800
Go on now.

296
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,600
Don't worry, Megan.
It's gonna be okay.

297
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,900
No.

298
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,800
Here. Put these on.

299
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,300
Oh my God.

300
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
They were right.

301
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
I'm a homo.

302
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,800
Oh my God.

303
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,700
Congratulations on
your first step, pom-pom.

304
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,100
Don't listen to her.

305
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,700
She's just upset
'cause the fish on her plate

306
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,900
is the only kind she can eat.

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,600
I can't wait to be straight.
I've always wanted to be.

308
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,300
It's cool to finally talk about it.

309
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,500
I can't tell any of my
friends on the team.

310
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,900
Maybe you have
the wrong friends.

311
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,500
I think we should all be
supporting each other.

312
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,100
Really, princess. Do you
want to start the kumbayas?

313
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,800
Hi Mom.

314
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,100
The flowers are pretty.

315
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I know.

316
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,100
I noticed that we sprung
another leak in the ceiling.

317
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,200
I'd like for you
to get to it tonight.

318
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,900
I'll get to it, Mom.
Jesus.

319
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Ow! I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

320
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,700
Look.
Not in my presence.

321
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,300
I have told you
over and over again.

322
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,100
No more sipping.
Chug it, like a man.

323
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
Go on. Chug.

324
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,200
There.

325
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,900
Try and get to that tonight.

326
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,600
(sighs)

327
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,800
(electronic buzzing,
soft moaning)

328
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Yeah.

329
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,700
Sorry, it's just me.
What are you doing?

330
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,800
AV, what's it to ya?

331
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
AV? What's that?

332
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,300
Aversion therapy, stupid.

333
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,200
So what does that mean?

334
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,700
When you have inappropriate
fantasies about girls,

335
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,600
you shock yourself with this shocker.
(buzzes)

336
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,000
So every time you think of them,
you feel that pain.

337
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,400
That's sick.

338
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,100
No pain, no gain, baby.
You want to like dick?

339
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,300
You better start training yourself.

340
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,500
Hey, isn't that Graham's sock?

341
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,300
None of your damn business.

342
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,000
(buzzing continues)

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,500
Megan.

344
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,500
You have a phone call.

345
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,100
Hello?

346
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Mother:
Megan, it's Mom and Dad.

347
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,200
We know it's after lights out,
but we miss you so much.

348
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,500
Father: We just wanted to know
how our little poodle is doing.

349
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
I'm doing okay.

350
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,800
You were right,

351
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,800
I am a homosexual.

352
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,900
But I'll be regular soon.

353
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,500
Father: Oh, that Mary
is pretty good then, huh?

354
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,100
Mm-hmm, and Mike
and all others.

355
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,800
I'm already starting step two.

356
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,500
Father: We're so glad,
and after all that money.

357
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,800
Mother: We can't wait
to see you up there at graduation,

358
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,600
to have you home,
so we can all be together again.

359
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Father:
Just remember we love you.

360
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,200
We would do anything for our Megan
to have a normal life,

361
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
- and if you need anything...
- Mother: We'd better go.

362
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,400
Now you hang in there.

363
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,400
- Stay strong!
- Sweet dreams.

364
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,900
You too, Daddy.
See you at family therapy.

365
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,400
I love you.

366
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,800
And forward.

367
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Backwards and forwards,

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,700
and backwards.
In a very clean line...

369
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,900
- you go in, and you go out,

370
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,000
And you go up
and you go down.

371
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
Girls, is everybody
paying attention here?

372
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,000
And you go in and out,
and in and out,

373
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,600
and in and out...

374
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,500
Get into every little crevice.

375
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,100
And in and out.

376
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,000
And you slip in...

377
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,100
and out...

378
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,100
add a little more oil,
and shove it in,

379
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,500
and take it out.

380
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,300
Put some muscle into it.

381
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,500
Shove it in and out.

382
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,100
And shove it in,
and take it out.

383
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,800
Okay, who wants
to go down with me?

384
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,200
# Climb before you hide #

385
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,600
# Then fool your pride #

386
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,800
# 'Cause we'll be waiting for ya #

387
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,100
# I go back to zero Henry #

388
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,000
# I see what you think you saw #

389
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
# When you passed me in the hall #

390
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,600
# I was... #

391
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,900
# There you go you're getting over #

392
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,400
# Tap an old friend on the shoulder #

393
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,900
# Penny fines for leaving empties #

394
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,700
# Lose your mind,
you're just like Henry #

395
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,900
# Let's go back to zero... #

396
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You're turning into a pretty young lady.

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Now hold still.

398
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
(whistle blows)
Come on!

399
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,800
All:
Die! Die! Die!

400
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,700
Okay then,

401
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,700
who's left to report out their root?

402
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,300
Andre?

403
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,700
Shit, Miss Mary, I ain't
the only one who don't got no root.

404
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,200
Andre, we don't use profanity,

405
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,700
or double negatives
here at True Directions.

406
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,300
Okay, who's next?

407
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,300
- Megan.
- Well, I've really been thinking,

408
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
but, I just can't think of anything.

409
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,400
I think our little prom queen
is too afraid to disclose.

410
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,100
Oh really?
What's your root, Graham?

411
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,200
We're working on your issue,
not mine.

412
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
You're deflecting.

413
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,700
Actually,

414
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,300
I think it might be
a great idea for Megan

415
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,500
to be reminded
of your root, Graham.

416
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,800
My mother got married in pants.

417
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,200
All right, let's see, Dolph?

418
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,100
Too many locker room showers
with the varsity team.

419
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Hilary?

420
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,500
All girl boarding school.

421
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Sinead?

422
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,500
I was born in France.

423
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,700
Clayton?

424
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,100
My mom let me play
in her pumps.

425
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,100
I like balls.

426
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Why thank you for that, Jan.

427
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,500
Joel?

428
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,600
Traumatic breasts.

429
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,700
So, yeah.

430
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,200
Now, Megan.

431
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,500
Do you see how easy
it could be?

432
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,900
You just have to
dig down into those

433
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
painful memories,
and you'll find it.

434
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Now, Hilary.
Will you please come up here?

435
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Today we are going to learn

436
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,300
one of the most wonderful things
about being a heterosexual...

437
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,500
friendship.

438
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,100
So what I'd like you all to do,

439
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,000
is to start partnering off.

440
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,600
Find yourself a friend for
the remainder of the program.

441
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
All right, everybody settle.

442
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
Now that we have all
found someone,

443
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,500
what I'd like you to do

444
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
is practice sometime tonight

445
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,800
with these.

446
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,600
- It's a woman.
- And what else?

447
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,800
I don't know.

448
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,200
A mother.

449
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,100
Women have roles.
After you learn that,

450
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,100
you'll stop objectifying them.

451
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,800
Haven't you been listening
to anything Mary said?

452
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,600
Well have you?

453
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,300
- Have I what?
- Stopped objectifying them.

454
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,100
I'm still looking for my root.

455
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,200
Must be tough
when you're such a priss.

456
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,900
Your turn.

457
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,400
- (buzzing)
- Ow!

458
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,200
You really have to be more prepared
for temptation, Megan.

459
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,800
(sighs)

460
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
Give it to me.

461
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,200
I'm open.

462
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,400
Mike: Boys!

463
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,300
Don't you see how sad
and pathetic you all are,

464
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,800
always wanting something
you can't have?

465
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,200
If I catch you looking
at another man like that

466
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
ever again,

467
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,900
you'll be watching sports
the whole weekend.

468
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Mary: First thing we do,
is we pull these tabs out.

469
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
Then you fold it over.

470
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Right now I've used
food coloring.

471
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,200
This way you could
see it better.

472
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
And if it's a boy, well it

473
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,100
- tinkles out.
- That's the wrong tab, okay?

474
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Will you please hold it still
while I'm doing this?

475
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,500
You're doing it all wrong.

476
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,700
No, I'm not. If you would just
give it to me to do,

477
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,100
it would be fine.

478
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Mary: Girls...

479
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,900
intervene.

480
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,200
Let's try that one more time.

481
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,800
...and I realized

482
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,100
that when we finished
swimming lessons

483
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:07,000
we would change
in front of each other.

484
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And that's it...

485
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,000
why I'm a homo.

486
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Andre, that's what kids do
after swimming lessons.

487
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Change,
everybody does that.

488
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,700
But I took one look
at those boys,

489
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,200
and I got a...
you know what.

490
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,000
(coughs)

491
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,400
I can relate to that.

492
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,500
When I used to study with Jacob,

493
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,200
we used to touch each others legs,

494
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,800
and rub up against each other.

495
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,200
Blowing each other after
your fuckin' bar mitzvah's

496
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,600
a little bit different
than learning to dog paddle.

497
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,600
That is totally uncalled for.

498
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,400
Well excuse me, but we're paying
a lot of money here

499
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,900
to get these kids fixed,

500
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,000
not sit around,
and listen to stories all day.

501
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,000
Graham, I hope you're getting
a little more out of this program

502
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,400
than that faggot over there.

503
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,100
Mr. Eaton,
I don't find that appropriate.

504
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,500
No, he's right,

505
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,800
it was a stupid ass root.

506
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,100
I'm never gonna know why
I'm a faggot.

507
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,000
I've heard enough
of this crap.

508
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,300
And when you get back
from Switzerland,

509
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,200
you'd better have this gay thing
out of your system. Got it?

510
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,800
I got it.

511
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
You fuck up, no college,

512
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,100
no car, no trust fund.

513
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,500
I'm not sitting
in any room with faggots.

514
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,100
Mary: Megan...

515
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,700
it's your turn to report
out your root.

516
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,700
I think it might be
my parents.

517
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,500
Okay, go with that.

518
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,400
You know we've kinda been
like this greeting card family.

519
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,600
And then there was
that one year where...

520
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,200
well Dad was unemployed
and Mom had to support us.

521
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,800
Wait a minute,
that was only for nine months.

522
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,100
And then I was offered
a much better job at the plant.

523
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,600
Maybe seeing Mom
kind of being the Dad, maybe l...

524
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,800
maybe I got the wrong idea
about the roles of men and women.

525
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,400
Absolutely.

526
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,100
I can't believe that you didn't
mention this earlier.

527
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,700
Your father was emasculated,
your mother was domineering.

528
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,700
Well not exactly.

529
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,800
You wanted to emulate your mother.

530
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,400
You have no respect for men,
because you don't respect your father.

531
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,900
- It's really not like that.
- Megan,

532
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,700
you have found your root.

533
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,600
In order to start healing
this festering wound,

534
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,100
I want you to write a song.

535
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,800
It's very therapeutic,

536
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,000
and it's good to put
your feelings down.

537
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,800
(blows whistle)

538
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,600
Free time is up in 20.

539
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,000
That means inside.

540
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,500
What is it?

541
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,800
Nothing. Trash.

542
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,300
What am I, contagious?

543
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,100
What is that?

544
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,500
I'm stuck on
five, six, seven, eight.

545
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,800
- God is good.
- God is straight.

546
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Hey that's good.

547
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,700
It's not supposed
to be intellectual.

548
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Cheers are supposed to be simple,
make people feel good.

549
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,900
Cheers make girls
do stupid cartwheels,

550
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,400
orgasms make people feel good.

551
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,500
Your parents didn't
stay very long.

552
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,400
I imagine it gets uncomfortable

553
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,600
sitting that long
with a stick up your ass.

554
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,700
I'm sure they're just trying
to do what's best for you.

555
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,600
I thought it was just an act,
but you really are

556
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,900
as sweet as fucking pie,
aren't you?

557
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,500
This is bullshit, Megan.
It doesn't work.

558
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,700
You are who you are.
The only trick is not getting caught.

559
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,900
How'd you end up here?

560
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,000
I got caught.

561
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,100
Doing what?

562
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,100
I had this friend,

563
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,000
and we just spent
a little too much time together.

564
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,500
What were you doing?

565
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,700
What do you think?

566
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,800
My step-mom caught us in my room
one day and sent me here.

567
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Were you in love with her?

568
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,300
Does it matter?

569
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,400
Careful.
I could report you for that.

570
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
# Open the door #

571
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,500
# Walk in behind her #

572
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
# Draw back your bow #

573
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,000
# Let it remind her #

574
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
# No one's around #

575
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,100
# No need to fake it #

576
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,400
# She's not in love #

577
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,600
# How can she take it? #

578
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,000
# Give her the time #

579
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,100
# She'll know you mean it #

580
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,100
# Make up her mind #

581
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,300
# Throw in her feelings #

582
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
# Open the door #

583
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,700
# Have her jump through it #

584
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
# She fell in love #

585
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,200
# How could she do it? #

586
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,000
# Do you know? Do you... #
(buzzing)

587
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
(moaning)

588
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,700
(whispering)
Resist temptations...

589
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,300
(heavy breathing)

590
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
(gasps)

591
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,400
Oh my God.
Please don't tell.

592
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,300
Oh my God, help.

593
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,400
Shut the fuck up!
You stupid little bitch.

594
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,900
- (electric buzz)
- Ahhh!

595
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,300
Hey!

596
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,900
What's going on in here?

597
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,200
- A little premature simulation?
- They were kissing.

598
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,400
- She's full of shit.
- Mike, we were just uh...

599
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,600
- Mike...
- Don't call my mom.

600
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,900
Dolph, I am really
disappointed in you.

601
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,200
I thought you had what it took
to get out of here clean.

602
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,300
It's time to wake Mary.

603
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,700
Come on!
Come on!

604
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,700
Come on!

605
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Mary: Whoever started this
is out of this house,

606
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,200
and the other is really
in the dog house.

607
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,300
- Clayton: Not me.
- Dolph: I can't go home.

608
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,700
Mary: I am not interested
in anybody's sob stories.

609
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,700
I can only help those
who are willing to help themselves.

610
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,500
Now... who started this?

611
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,400
Someone has got to start talking!

612
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,500
All right, Clayton, you little pervert...

613
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,600
- What?
...you've got one week of solitary,

614
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,600
and if I catch you again you're out.

615
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,000
(sighs)

616
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,700
Come on, Mary.

617
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,200
I wish I could've seen
those two boys in action,

618
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,500
before Miss Thing over there,
went Nancy Drew on us.

619
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,400
If that little twink
woulda narked on me,

620
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,700
heads would have rolled.

621
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,600
Would you tie her to your bed
and zap her to death?

622
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Or are you running low
on batteries?

623
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,900
Mary:
And here are our love-birds,

624
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,800
taking a relaxing
evening stroll together.

625
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Notice how affectionate they are.

626
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,400
This could be you.

627
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,900
And here is our
happy couple at home.

628
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,000
Now it's important to make
your man feel at ease

629
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,500
when he comes home
from a long day at work.

630
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,200
Now, when it's time
for lovemaking,

631
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,400
Dan kisses Sue
and touches her breasts.

632
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:54,400
Women often find
this sensation pleasurable.

633
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,400
# There's a dream
in the back of my mind #

634
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,800
# Across the tracks is where
I'll find my dream... #

635
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,400
# Trailer, trailer,
pretty trailer #

636
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,800
# Trailer, trailer,
pretty trailer #

637
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,800
# Talk penny, sing a dime #

638
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,000
# My Coleman stove
is broke down all of the time #

639
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,100
# Neighbor, neighbor,
call the neighbor #

640
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,200
# We'll have dinner
in the trailer... #

641
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,400
So do you miss
your friends from home?

642
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,400
I just can't decide
who I miss more,

643
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,600
the grunting apes in the letterman jackets
or the bulimic cheerl...

644
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,600
Go ahead, say it.

645
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,600
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

646
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,600
I don't have any friends.

647
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
What about you?

648
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Well, I thought I did.

649
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,600
- Do they know you're here?
- Oh yeah.

650
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,600
It's rough.

651
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,500
What's going on?
It's almost lights out.

652
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,400
We're sneaking out.
Get dressed.

653
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,700
But Mary...

654
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,700
Fuck Mary.

655
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,500
No way.
There's only four weeks left.

656
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,900
There's no way
I'm getting thrown out now.

657
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,300
Megan, they're never gonna
find about this.

658
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,000
We haven't had fun in forever.

659
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,300
Come on.
We could use a little fun.

660
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,700
- What if we get caught?
- Were not gonna get caught.

661
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,700
If you're not coming with us,
at least don't rat on us.

662
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,500
Let's go.

663
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,400
Come on. Hurry up.

664
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Go, go, go.

665
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh we have a nice big group tonight.

666
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,200
Get in.

667
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,000
- Okay, fasten your seatbelts.
- Wait.

668
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,300
Oh. We have one more.

669
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,000
- Well it's about fucking time.
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

670
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,700
Hi. I'm Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

671
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,300
This is Larry Morgan-Gordon.
Glad to have you with us.

672
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,800
You'll need one of these.

673
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,000
It may not be an exact match, but...

674
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,500
First time you've all been AWOL?

675
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,900
Larry and Lloyd are ex, ex-gays.

676
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
From True Directions?

677
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,900
We were among Mary's ranks
before we defected.

678
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,600
We're just trying to provide you all
with a balanced perspective,

679
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,200
to see that there are options.

680
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,700
In the end it's up to you
whether choose to live a...

681
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
lie.

682
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,000
Whether you want
to be who you are

683
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,900
or keep it hidden,
is really more what we're about.

684
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,100
So you run like,
the underground homo railroad?

685
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
(dance music playing)

686
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,300
Come on, girls.

687
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,900
You didn't tell me you were
taking me to a gay bar.

688
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Where else would we go?

689
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,700
- I'm gonna get you a drink.
- I don't drink.

690
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
I refuse to accept a false
solution to my problem.

691
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,200
I resist temptation
and seek to solve my problem.

692
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,700
- I refuse to accept a false...
- What are you doing?

693
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,500
- My interventions.
- You know you don't have to do that.

694
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,400
Just be yourself.

695
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,100
# Baby #

696
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,300
# You're making me want you... #

697
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,700
Hi. Would you like to dance?

698
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,100
- Sure she does.
- No, sorry. I can't.

699
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,300
That's okay.
Just thought I'd ask.

700
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,300
No problem.

701
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,600
Too good for one dance?

702
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,800
You can't dance with a girl
for a second? Go ahead.

703
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

704
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,000
Sorry.
I don't dance much.

705
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,100
That's okay.

706
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,600
# Making me care,
do doo doo #

707
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,900
# Do doo, doo, doo... #

708
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,100
# Baby... #

709
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,800
# You're making me want you #

710
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,200
# Want you #

711
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,600
# And baby... #

712
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,100
# You're making me love you #

713
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:26,800
- # Love you #
- # We're in the city, city #

714
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,800
# You're making me love you #

715
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,700
# We're in the city, city #

716
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,700
# Makin' me love you... #

717
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,700
Megan, it's not what you think.

718
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,600
That's why we came here, right?
So you could be yourself.

719
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,200
- I don't like Sinead that way.
- Which way is that, clothed?

720
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,200
We weren't doing anything.

721
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,900
When you were going like this,
you weren't doing anything?

722
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,100
No I wasn't...
I wasn't doing that.

723
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,200
It doesn't matter.

724
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,700
- Why are you freaking out?
- It's none of my business.

725
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,000
Do what you want.

726
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,400
You want me to do what I want?

727
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,600
- I could care less.
- What I really want?

728
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,600
Screw you.

729
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,700
I'm not supposed to like you.

730
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,100
But?

731
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,400
I wanna do that again.

732
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
(cheering, music plays)

733
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,700
What are you looking at?

734
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
Ah! Mary's coming!

735
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,800
- Good night.
- Good night.

736
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,000
# Here I go falling down
down, down #

737
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,800
# My mind is a blank #

738
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,100
# My head is spinning
around and around #

739
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,700
# As I go deep into
the funnel of love #

740
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,000
# It's such a crazy,
crazy feeling #

741
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,900
# I get weak in the knees... #

742
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,800
Come on,

743
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,000
throw out the first thing
that comes to your head.

744
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,900
Okay, just think.

745
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I already did.

746
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Mine is just as good
as anybody else's.

747
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,100
I'm a heterosexual.

748
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Not yet, honey.
You're almost there.

749
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
And don't speak out of turn.

750
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,400
No, I know, I've never been gay.

751
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,700
Jan remember,
you were molested.

752
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,000
Just take a look at yourself.

753
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Everybody thinks I'm this big dyke

754
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,100
because I wear baggy pants,
and play softball,

755
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,400
and I'm not as pretty as other girls,
but that doesn't make me gay.

756
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,100
I like guys.

757
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,700
I can't help it.

758
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,900
I want a big fat wiener up my...

759
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,700
Amen, sister.

760
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,400
(sniffs)

761
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
I quit.

762
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Who in the hell
is she trying to fool?

763
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,100
Hey, Jan.

764
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,800
Jan.

765
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,700
Group.

766
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,400
I have found something
very disturbing this morning.

767
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,800
I would like to know

768
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,300
who has been sneaking out,

769
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,600
with those smut peddling
recruiters?

770
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,700
I want names.

771
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,600
I want to know who is involved.

772
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,400
Fine then. Graham?

773
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,200
What do you have to say
for yourself?

774
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,900
Why are you looking at me?

775
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,400
Because I found these
under your bed.

776
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Do you have anything
you'd like to confess?

777
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,200
I didn't sneak out.

778
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,100
But you know who did.

779
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,400
No, I don't, but um...

780
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,500
I did realize something
about myself last night,

781
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,700
that I was too scared
to admit until now.

782
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,200
Out with it.

783
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,000
Come on, out with it.

784
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,700
I have a crush.

785
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,000
On Joel.

786
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,900
It was the first time I really
felt something for a guy.

787
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,300
And it just... it really proved
to me the treatment's working.

788
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,700
Oh, Graham.

789
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Now, let this show you

790
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,400
what determination has yielded.

791
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
Fruit.

792
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,100
Now I want you all
to look at Graham's strength,

793
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,500
and how she worked her way
through this five-step program.

794
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,600
And by the way, I am very
disappointed in the rest of you.

795
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,300
And I have scheduled a meeting
with each of your parents.

796
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:30,100
If you can't listen to me,
then perhaps you'll listen to them.

797
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,300
Joel: No, I didn't go
to the Cocksucker.

798
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,500
I've never been to the Cocksucker.
I won't.

799
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
My cocksucking days are over.

800
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,100
I am normal.

801
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,600
Mom, Dad, you have to believe me,
I swear I didn't go anywhere.

802
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,200
You're not gonna tell
your parents are you?

803
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,500
(chimes)

804
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:53,000
Now, honey,

805
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,800
your mom and I both know

806
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,000
that you didn't have
anything to do with that...

807
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,200
- that...
- Field trip to the Cocksucker.

808
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,200
- Field trip to the Co...

809
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,900
but... if you had gone...

810
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,100
You have to know
that you would be on your own.

811
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,300
What's that supposed to mean?

812
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,100
Well you can't come home.

813
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:21,600
We can't allow you to live
an unhealthy lifestyle under our roof.

814
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,600
So, Megan, if that
is what you choose,

815
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,700
you're choosing to cut us
out of your life.

816
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,600
Well, great. Great.

817
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:39,100
Now, what did you
want to tell us?

818
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,800
Just that you don't have
anything worry about.

819
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,200
I've been missing Jared a lot,

820
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,700
and can't wait to see him again.

821
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,400
Oh, Megan. That's wonderful.

822
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,600
You just keep up
the good work,

823
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,200
and we'll be back
to see you graduate.

824
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,000
Dad: You'll be home
before you know it.

825
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,600
Bye-bye, sweetie.

826
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,100
- You be a good girl.
- Goodbye, dear.

827
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,500
Hmph!

828
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
(answering machine)
This is Larry and Lloyd Morgan-Gordon.

829
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Leave us a message.
(beep)

830
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:24,800
I know you're there.
Now pick it up.

831
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,200
Listen to me,
you little inverts.

832
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,900
Okay, you want to play
rough with my kids,

833
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,700
then I can play rough with you.

834
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,100
- Time's up.
- Yes, thank you.

835
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,300
We've got a little situation
to deal with.

836
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,400
(Chanting)
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

837
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,300
Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!

838
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
Mary:
You have other options.

839
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,600
Don't you want to be normal?

840
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,100
Hey, I know you.
I saw you last night.

841
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,700
Hey!
Your daddy know you're a faggot?

842
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,000
Good shot, Graham.

843
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,200
What are you doing?

844
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,400
What if he saw us kissing?
What do you want me to do?

845
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,700
We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

846
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,300
We are here! We're not queer!
We're not going anywhere!

847
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,500
That's it. If you don't retreat,
we're coming out.

848
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,600
(screaming)

849
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,200
Is this what you teach now, Mary?
Throw stones from glass houses?

850
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,700
You're gonna have a lot
of broken glass around you.

851
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,500
It's part of the process, Lloyd.

852
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,200
It's not easy for them.

853
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,600
- Excuse me
- Oh, thanks.

854
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,500
You are so good
at being straight.

855
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,300
Wow. You have really
big muscles.

856
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,200
I keep forgetting about
all these little things.

857
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,700
Get her cake.
Get her the cake.

858
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,900
Can I rub them?

859
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,100
Got a little cake right there.

860
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,400
That's good.

861
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,200
Oh. Yeah.

862
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,200
Mm-mm.

863
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,800
You're really manly.

864
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,900
- Thanks.
- I like that.

865
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,200
- Manly is good.
- I feel like the aggressor.

866
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,300
That's nice.

867
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,900
Yeah.

868
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,300
You will all

869
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,900
be graded in each category,

870
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:57,900
and those of you who pass,
will move on to step five,

871
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,100
simulated sexual lifestyle.

872
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,900
And those of you who fail,
will be sent home.

873
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,800
Boys with Mike.
Girls with me.

874
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,200
# Her melody #

875
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,500
# Wants her desperately #

876
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,400
# Cry lonely tears #

877
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,100
# 'Cause she's so far from here #

878
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,400
# She's a ray of sunshine #

879
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,700
# My only ray of sunshine #

880
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,800
# Her yellow hair #

881
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,400
# Her fiery stare #

882
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,500
# But nothing's right #

883
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,100
# 'Cause she's not here tonight #

884
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,700
# She's a ray of sunshine #

885
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,200
# My only ray of sunshine #

886
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,400
# I know that I'm going nowhere #

887
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,500
# I wish that she'd
come back to me #

888
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,800
# She's all I need #

889
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,500
# She's all I need #

890
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,000
# All I need to end my misery... #

891
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,600
Mike:
Essay topic: My root,

892
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,300
and how it prevented me
from heterosexual loving.

893
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:22,200
# She's a ray of sunshine #

894
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:28,100
# My only ray of sunshine. #

895
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,400
Now, in order
to successfully navigate

896
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,800
the treacherous sea
of temptation,

897
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,400
one must first enter a life
out of homosexuality.

898
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,800
I've never seen
such a determined group.

899
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,500
And I am passing all...

900
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,800
but one of you.

901
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,800
- Andre.
- Hmm?

902
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,700
You may pack your bags.

903
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,700
Now there's cake in the kitchen.

904
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
You'll wanna rest up
for the simulation.

905
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,400
Michael, congratulations.

906
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,700
I just wasn't meant
to be butch.

907
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,800
I'm a sissy.

908
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,700
No.

909
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,200
You should be proud
of who you are.

910
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,800
Hello.

911
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,500
I mean you're more
than just a sissy.

912
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,600
You're nice and clean,

913
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,500
and smart and sexy,

914
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,800
and firm and luscious, and...

915
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,500
Excuse me.

916
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
The last thing
I need right now

917
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,600
is some fruit
who just proved he's straight

918
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,700
telling my ass how sexy I am.

919
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,900
Congratulations, liars!

920
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,300
You know who you are,
and you know who you want.

921
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,500
Ain't nobody gonna change that.

922
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,400
Shit!

923
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,600
# Breathe into my hands #

924
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,100
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from #

925
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,400
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

926
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,500
# Are you still breathing? #

927
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,400
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

928
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,400
# Are you still breathing #

929
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,600
# Breathe into my hands #

930
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:04,000
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from... #

931
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:23,500
Graham?

932
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,900
I've never felt that way before.

933
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
Except...

934
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,200
Except for what?

935
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,100
- Don't laugh, okay?
- I won't.

936
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,100
Except for when
I was cheerleading.

937
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,100
- Really?
- I'm serious.

938
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,900
It sounds stupid to you,
but I really love it.

939
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,100
Cheerleading's the one thing
that's kept me happy.

940
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,700
It's exhilarating.

941
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,900
I would love to see you cheer.

942
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,400
- Don't make fun of me.
- No, I'm not.

943
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,400
Did you ever think
maybe I'm just jealous

944
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,800
that you love something?

945
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,200
# Breathe into my hands #

946
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,700
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

947
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,900
Get out of bed!

948
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,400
You hormonal hussy.

949
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,400
I can't believe you did this.

950
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,900
You were suppose to be
the role model.

951
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,300
Now get up right now!

952
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,500
What did I do?

953
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,100
Hilary:
A little sleep-over with Graham.

954
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,600
(scoffs)

955
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,100
Get dressed right now!

956
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,700
Mary:
You of course understand

957
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,400
what your little adventure
has cost you.

958
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,300
You will be removed from the program,
and the premises at once.

959
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,600
I understand.

960
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:14,500
And of course your parents
have made it very clear

961
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,400
that you are just not
welcome home any more.

962
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:19,500
So you will be left
to your own devices.

963
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:24,500
I mean there may be one thing
that you can do,

964
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,800
where we can workout
some kind of a deal.

965
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,700
I'll let you stay,

966
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,700
and graduate with the rest
your class,

967
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,600
but you must do me
one favor in return.

968
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:35,200
Partner in simulation
with Rock.

969
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,200
Rock?

970
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,700
I don't think that'll work.

971
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,700
(dance music playing)

972
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,800
Oh, for Pete's sake!

973
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,100
(singing)
# Wham bam, thank you, ma'am. #

974
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:58,100
Rock, turn it off.

975
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,400
We've lost Megan.

976
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,700
She just wasn't
strong enough.

977
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:09,700
But you still have a chance
to save yourself.

978
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,000
It's your choice.

979
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,500
You can run off with Megan
and turn into a raging bull-dyke

980
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,400
or you can do the simulation
and graduate,

981
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,400
and lead a normal life.

982
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,000
There is no choice.

983
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,900
You came here to graduate,

984
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,500
and that is exactly
what you are going to do.

985
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,100
You understand me,
young lady?

986
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,400
This is exactly
why your mother left.

987
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,700
Are you ready to lose
your father?

988
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,300
Then it's settled.

989
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,200
Graham will partner with Rock
in simulation.

990
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,100
Megan, you're out.

991
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,100
Skedaddle.

992
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,600
(softly)
I'm sorry.

993
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,800
Man:
What do you want?

994
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,700
I need to talk
to Lloyd and Larry.

995
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,600
But you're from True Directions.

996
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,100
- Yeah.
- (window shuts)

997
01:07:58,100 --> 01:07:59,800
Hey, not anymore.

998
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,400
All right, kid,
get in here.

999
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,300
Come on, move your tush.

1000
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:10,900
I can't go back.

1001
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,800
I thought you could teach me
how to be a lesbian,

1002
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,800
what they wear,
where they live.

1003
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,000
You know.

1004
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,400
Megan, we can't
help you with that.

1005
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,700
There's not just one way
to be a lesbian.

1006
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,300
You just have to continue
to be who you are.

1007
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,100
- Dolph?
- Megan.

1008
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:37,100
Thank you so much for saving me
from that place.

1009
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,700
What are you doing here?

1010
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,800
I live here.

1011
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:43,200
Or at least until I find a way
to make it on my own.

1012
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,800
It's way better than TD.

1013
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,300
We all get our own rooms
and curfew is midnight.

1014
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
But we have to share bathrooms.

1015
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,700
Not at the same time,
of course.

1016
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,200
Of course.

1017
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,700
Come on,
it's going to be okay.

1018
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,400
No it won't.

1019
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:05,000
She was supposed to leave with me
and she didn't.

1020
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Whoa, slow down, who?

1021
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,100
Graham.

1022
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,600
I knew it.

1023
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,000
She was into you
from the start.

1024
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,700
Then why didn't she
come with me?

1025
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,400
Maybe she was scared.

1026
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,100
Like I'm not?

1027
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,200
Believe me,
you're better off here.

1028
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,300
Mary:
Graham?

1029
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,300
Pay attention.

1030
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,700
Action, Rock.

1031
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,600
Now lean in and kiss her.

1032
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,500
Nice, Rock.

1033
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,200
Now, feel how soft
and vulnerable she is.

1034
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,900
Isn't it wonderful?

1035
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,300
Now, Graham,

1036
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,700
let him take the lead.

1037
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,200
A little tongue...

1038
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,200
He loves you.
He wants to be with you.

1039
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,600
The way God intended.

1040
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,300
To be inside you.

1041
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,600
His love muscle thrusting.

1042
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,000
(both scoff)

1043
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,200
Cut.

1044
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,000
Megan, we thought that Dolph
should take you out this week,

1045
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,700
to celebrate your
new freedom.

1046
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,000
- How would that be?
- Sure.

1047
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,500
So, Megan...

1048
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,600
what do you want
to do now?

1049
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,300
Larry, Megan just made
a very traumatic decision

1050
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:33,200
- and she's moving through that process.
- I thought that...

1051
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,500
we could check out
some schools in the city,

1052
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,400
- and I could...
- She's not ready...

1053
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,600
Sweetie.

1054
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,300
I'm just asking
a simple question.

1055
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:44,300
- I'm not interrogating her.
- You are moving into that

1056
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,900
- aggressive space again.
- Can't I even ask a question around here?

1057
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,900
Now I feel you moving
into your victim stance.

1058
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:53,500
I was not attacking,
I was verbalizing.

1059
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,800
I just feel like you don't
value my opinion anymore.

1060
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,200
Seems like nothing I do
pleases you.

1061
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,600
I feel inadequate.

1062
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,800
I love my Larry bear.

1063
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:12,000
- Lloyd's sorry.
- Larry bear's sorry, too.

1064
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,800
Okay then.
Dinner's ready.

1065
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,500
Very good.
Okay, who's next?

1066
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,800
Okay, now remember
that sex is fun.

1067
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,600
We're making love.

1068
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,700
There's nothing dirty
about it.

1069
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:45,100
Sex is beautiful when it's
between a man and a woman.

1070
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,400
Mom?

1071
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,700
Okay,
now from this position,

1072
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,400
the woman will
spread her legs,

1073
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,500
opening like a flower.

1074
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,000
That's wonderful Graham.

1075
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,400
Now at this point,
the man will insert himself

1076
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:58,800
into the woman.

1077
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,300
Yes, that's...

1078
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,200
Yes. Rock that's it.

1079
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,300
Mrs. Brown?

1080
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,700
What is it, Joel?

1081
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,000
- What about foreplay?
- Foreplay is for sissies.

1082
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,200
Real men go in,
unload and pull out.

1083
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,500
Mom!

1084
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,800
We could dance
if you want to.

1085
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:37,600
You go ahead.

1086
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,900
I think I need to go get some air.

1087
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,600
I miss her.

1088
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,800
She's scared that maybe
she's making the wrong choice.

1089
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,000
But it's her wrong
choice to make.

1090
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:06,400
You have to be willing
to walk away.

1091
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,000
What about you and Clayton?

1092
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
If he can't make a stand,
he just can't make a stand.

1093
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,800
Well, what about you?

1094
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,100
What are you willing to do?

1095
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:33,600
I'm so proud of you.

1096
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,000
Doesn't it feel great
to be straight?

1097
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,600
To be out of homosexuality?

1098
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,300
It's not always
gonna be easy,

1099
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:44,900
but at least we know
what to do now.

1100
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,800
Okay, girls,
ready to go?

1101
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,300
Give me the keys.

1102
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,700
- I hope she's worth it.
- Is Clayton?

1103
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,600
I'm doing this for you,
not for Clayton.

1104
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,900
Yeah, right.

1105
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,400
There he is.

1106
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,200
Let's go.

1107
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,300
Mary: Welcome to the graduating class
of True Directions.

1108
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:06,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present

1109
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:10,000
our happy heterosexuals.

1110
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,600
(applause)

1111
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,000
- Jesus.
- Miss me?

1112
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,600
Why are you here?

1113
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,100
I came to get you.

1114
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,200
I can't go anywhere, Megan.

1115
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,800
That was fast.

1116
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,000
Where's Graham?

1117
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,200
I've got to try again.

1118
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,800
We have all gathered
on this special day,

1119
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,900
to celebrate the wonderful
true directions.

1120
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:44,800
And praise be
to our Higher Power.

1121
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,100
Will our graduates
please stand again?

1122
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,900
Sinead Lauren.

1123
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,600
Joel Goldberg.

1124
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:12,500
Hilary Vandermueller.

1125
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,200
Graham Eaton.

1126
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,200
And now,
I think that in closing...

1127
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:49,800
we should...

1128
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,100
Graham.

1129
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,800
One, two, three, four,

1130
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,300
I won't take "no" anymore.

1131
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,400
Five, six, seven, eight,

1132
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,700
I want you to be my mate.

1133
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,300
One, two, three, four,

1134
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,600
You're the one that I adore.

1135
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,000
Five, six, seven, eight,

1136
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,100
Don't run from me
'cause this is fate.

1137
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,100
# Breathe into my hands #

1138
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:34,200
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

1139
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:41,800
I love you.

1140
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,100
Megan...

1141
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:47,900
you stop it, this instant.

1142
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:50,900
'Cause you will wallow in the smut

1143
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,700
of your homosexual depravity

1144
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:54,300
for the rest of your life.

1145
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:03,200
Go, come on, let's go.

1146
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:05,800
- (engine starts)
- Megan!

1147
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,400
Wait!

1148
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,300
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1149
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:26,300
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1150
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:30,200
# Are you still,
still breathing? #

1151
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:33,700
# Breathe into my hands #

1152
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:39,100
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from #

1153
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,600
# Breathe into my hands #

1154
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,200
# Or cup them like a glass
to drink from. #

1155
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,600
(applause)

1156
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:53,000
My name is Peter,

1157
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:54,200
and...

1158
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,600
my daughter is a homosexual.

1159
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,900
All:
Hello, Peter.

1160
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,600
# What do they know
when they say I'm too young? #

1161
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:24,400
# As I get older
and until my life is done #

1162
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:29,200
# I'll be the one
who had love that was true #

1163
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:33,400
# They all had nothing
and I had you #

1164
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,400
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1165
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,500
# Together forever in love #

1166
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,500
# Together forever in love #

1167
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,400
# I'll be your reason
for starting your day #

1168
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,200
# You'll be my true love
in every way #

1169
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,300
# I'll always need you
I promise that now #

1170
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:10,100
# Through good and bad
as long as this life will allow #

1171
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,600
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1172
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,800
# Together forever in love #

1173
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,800
# Together forever in love #

1174
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,200
# My life is for living #

1175
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:25,400
# I'll spend mine giving you
all that I can #

1176
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:28,200
# My heart and my hand #

1177
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:42,700
# My life with you will
shine brighter than gold #

1178
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:47,700
# Memories of heaven
for when I get old #

1179
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:52,000
# Never again
will I wanna run away #

1180
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:56,700
# I didn't think that I could
ever feel this way #

1181
01:21:56,700 --> 01:21:59,300
# We'll be together
forever in love #

1182
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:01,600
# Together forever in love #

1183
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:07,000
# Together forever in love #

1184
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,300
# Together forever in love. #

1185
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,800
# Open the door #

1186
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:40,000
# Walk in behind her #

1187
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,400
# Draw back your bow #

1188
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,400
# Let it remind her #

1189
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,500
# No one's around #

1190
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,600
# No need to fake it #

1191
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,600
# She's not in love #

1192
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,500
# How can she take it? #

1193
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,600
# Give her the time #

1194
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,800
# She'll know you mean it #

1195
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,800
# Make up her mind #

1196
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,100
# Throw in her feelings #

1197
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,200
# Open the door #

1198
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,400
# Have her jump through it #

1199
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
# She fell in love #

1200
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:18,600
# How could she do it? #

1201
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:21,700
# Do you know,
do you know #

1202
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:24,200
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1203
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,900
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1204
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,700
# Do you know,
do you know #

1205
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,300
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1206
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:37,100
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1207
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,400
# You should try to kiss her #

1208
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,300
# Crazy galore #

1209
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,700
# You wouldn't do it #

1210
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,700
# Seen it before #

1211
01:23:56,700 --> 01:23:59,200
# Looks like you blew it #

1212
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,200
# Do you know,
do you know #

1213
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,800
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1214
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,200
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1215
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:11,300
# Do you know,
do you know #

1216
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,900
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1217
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:17,700
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1218
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,100
# You should try to kiss her #

1219
01:24:20,100 --> 01:24:23,100
# Do you know,
do you know #

1220
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,700
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1221
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:29,500
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1222
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:32,500
# Do you know,
do you know #

1223
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,100
# What you're missing,
what you're missing #

1224
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,900
# Will show,
if you should try to kiss her? #

1225
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,200
# You should try to kiss her #

1226
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,700
# Just put up your fist #

1227
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:49,700
# You should try
to kiss her goodbye. #

1228
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,500
# Swish with me #

1229
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:03,800
# And I'll swish with you #

1230
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,800
# That's right, get down #

1231
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,400
# Everybody swish to the left #

1232
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,600
# That's right, get down... #
