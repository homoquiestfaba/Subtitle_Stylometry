about the night
the Porters died?

He was home that night.
He was very sick.

He couldn't.

Can't even get out of bed

359
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,963
What was he like
as a child?
MRS. GWYNEK: Mmm...

360
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:30,468
He was a happy boy, a kind boy.

361
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,006
Children made fun of him,
called him names.

362

He didn't ever want
to leave the farm,

school him at home.

Talan English as well?

Yeah, but he speaks
much better than me.

Uh, Romanian.

I was born there,
but we moved to France
when I was young.

371

um, excessive facial

the teeth look longer.
