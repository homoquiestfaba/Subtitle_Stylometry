1
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,518
The cops!

2
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,491
Get them!

3
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,791
Come on!

4
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,292
Come on!

5
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,344
That's Tony V.

6
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,113
The only thing that matters

7
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,750
in this crazy world

8
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,019
is family.

9
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,549
Tu famiglia.

10
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:43,653
Everything else comes in second.

11
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,426
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

12
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,594
And that is why you are all here today.

13
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,934
So I want you to realize

14
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,633
the decision I've come to

15
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,642
I did not come to lightly.

16
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,267
It is time.

17
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,303
I am stepping down as don.

18
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,336
Stepping down?

19
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:03,371
Don Carini, this is--

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,782
State zitti. Respect!

21
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,752
Thank you, Anthony.

22
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:11,848
Don Carini, I think I speak
for everyone present.

23
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,449
You are too young to retire.

24
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,985
No, I am an old man.

25
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,861
I've lived a long life.

26
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,923
But nobody lives forever.

27
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,401
If you think that

28
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,803
this is the time to step down,
Don Carini,

29
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:29,933
then who are any of us
to question your wisdom?

30
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:33,935
Anthony, ever since
I took you in as a small boy,

31
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,608
you have been like a son to me.

32
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,946
I am humbled by your kind words.

33
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,144
I could always count on you

34
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,948
to think of the family first.

35
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,318
Until my dying breath.

36
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:44,118
You are loyal and respectful.

37
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,954
You know I care about the family

38
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,516
more than anything else in this world.

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,050
And that is why I want you

40
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,995
to help train my successor.

41
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:52,522
What?

42
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,429
Anthony, you are like a son to me,

43
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,459
but you are not my son.

44
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,896
All due respect, Don Carini,

45
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,998
but you don't have a son.

46
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,269
I do have a son.

47
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,038
He is the one I want

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,739
to take over the head of this family.

49
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,913
Remember when I had
to take a powder

50
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,616
during the last war
with the Bonfantes?

51
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,784
I jumped on a ship headed for Asia,

52
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:23,262
and there, in all places, Korea,

53
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,026
I met the woman
who captured my heart.

54
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,295
Soo Mi Park.

55
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,165
Skin like butter.

56
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:32,103
Hair as soft as silk.

57
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,272
We had a son together.

58
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,401
She named him...

59
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,109
Younggu.

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,941
The Bonfantes found out
where I was hiding

61
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,881
and they sent one of their zips.

62
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:48,920
And Soo Mi, my soulmate,

63
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,090
took the bullet that was intended for me.

64
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:58,259
I had no choice but to bring my young son,
Younggu, to an orphanage,

65
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,596
and return to America alone
to settle business.

66
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,570
But I never forgot about my boy,
my blood, my son,

67
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,231
Younggu.

68
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,273
Don Carini, I will go to Korea this instant
and bring your son home.

69
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,744
That won't be necessary, Macho.

70
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,578
The nun at the orphanage
is relocating here,

71
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,980
so they're coming together.

72
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,916
If he's anything like you, boss,

73
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,545
I'm sure he's a handsome guy, huh?

74
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,747
You got that right.

75
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,305
Don Carini, they're here.

76
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,733
They're here!

77
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,205
- All right, gotta go.
- Get up.

78
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,205
Step aside.

79
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,082
Younggu Carini,

80
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,358
I am your father, Gino Carini.

81
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,422
And you are my son.

82
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,933
You my father?

83
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,735
I'm your son?

84
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:15,930
I didn't know.

85
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,842
Thank you.

86
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,149
Thank you taking
such good care of my son.

87
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:34,950
How can I ever, ever
repay your kindness?

88
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:42,364
Caring for Younggu
was an absolute...joy.

89
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,197
He's a special boy.

90
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,227
Yeah.

91
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,297
It makes me sad to say goodbye.

92
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,740
Oh, Theresa--

93
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,237
Don Carini...

94
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,770
All due respect,

95
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,807
is this really your son?

96
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,346
He's hungry. It was a long trip.

97
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,215
I'm just saying.

98
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,188
It's a big job, running the family.

99
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,787
Maybe we can set him up in,
you know, Queens,

100
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,897
bookmaking,
or maybe loansharking.

101
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,696
Let me say this once more.

102
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,431
Younggu is my son,
and he's going to head this family.

103
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,005
If you have a problem with that,
then we have a problem.

104
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,637
Forgive me, Don Carini.
I got no problem.

105
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:04,207
Good, 'cause it's up to you, Tony,
to show him the ropes.

106
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,411
To get him up to speed

107
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,215
and to make sure
he's ready for the day

108
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,654
when he becomes
the capo de tutti capo.

109
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,413
Capisce?

110
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,114
O capito.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,758
Spaghetti big problem.

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,762
Glass.

113
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,098
Okay.

114
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,797
Let me get this straight.

115
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:28,129
Don Carini has a son?

116
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,299
It must'a been when he hid out
during the last mob war.

117
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,736
Yeah. Carini just brought him over
from Korea.

118
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,934
And get this.

119
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,738
He just told all his men

120
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,677
his son is gonna be the next don.

121
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,737
A foreigner son?
That don't make sense.

122
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,043
It gets better.

123
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,238
This son,

124
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:48,014
my guy on the inside
said that he's a total moron.

125
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,988
Don Carini may be a rat,

126
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,785
but he's the smartest rat I ever met,

127
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:54,122
and he would not hand
the reins of his family

128
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,752
over to some simpleton.

129
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,129
We gotta test this son.

130
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,297
Give it to Bobby Donuts.

131
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,770
Don, about Bobby Donuts.

132
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,934
Divers found the body this morning.

133
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,037
Bobby Donuts.

134
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,272
He was a soldier for the Bonfantes.

135
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,880
No doubt payback for Harry the Horse.

136
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:18,349
You know, if these gang guys
keep killing themselves,

137
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,681
we're gonna be out of a job.

138
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,113
Good work, Jeff.

139
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,317
Word has it the Carinis
have stolen cargo from the airport.

140
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,485
Oh, yeah? Well, I gotta see that
with my own eyes.

141
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,359
And Don Carini has brought in
some fresh blood.

142
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,023
A new underboss.

143
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,554
- An import.
- From Sicily?

144
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,998
No, Korea.

145
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,059
They brought a guy in from Korea?

146
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:38,832
Oh, this is bad.

147
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,501
No. No, no, hey, no.

148
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,031
Oh, man, come on!

149
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,909
I just had her washed and waxed.

150
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,506
Look at this! Oh, man!

151
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,972
What an idiot.

152
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,242
She's the love of my life.

153
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,878
All right, wrap this thing up.

154
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,116
Get me a dossier on this new guy,

155
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,522
and let's see if we can't keep the city

156
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:01,822
from breaking out into an all-out mob war.

157
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,891
Will you guys find out
what dossier means?

158
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:09,958
Yeah, sure.

159
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,991
How's the body?

160
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,037
Stabbed? Was he shot?

161
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,665
He got on concrete boots?

162
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,811
Come on now, Younggu.
What's taking so long?

163
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,914
Come on, Younggu.
While we're young.

164
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,985
Why you look at me?

165
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,494
You look like a circus clown.

166
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,957
Younggu, you wanna be a made man,

167
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,329
you gotta look like a made man.

168
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,095
Man no maid.

169
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,159
Arturo, come here.

170
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,670
Hook him up with a sharkskin suit,

171
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,801
some silk shirts, ltalian loafers,
the works. Okay?

172
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,810
It's gonna take longer than we thought.

173
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,902
Yeah, let's look around.

174
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,276
Show me something
with a wider lapel.

175
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,905
This guy is driving me nuts.

176
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,253
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

177
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,224
Wait. Stop it!

178
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,233
Not there.
Hey, wait a minute!

179
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,360
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

180
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,428
Get it out!

181
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,497
Gimme that!

182
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,700
What is this?

183
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,142
Don't touch! Don't touch!

184
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,166
Okay.

185
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,736
Or I'll smack you!

186
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,347
Okay. School's in.

187
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,182
The Carini family controls everything

188
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:38,213
from Mott Street
to the Delancey Street park down there.

189
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,383
This is our turf.

190
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,086
Oh, our turf.

191
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,186
Yeah. Everything you see is ours.

192
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,527
- We get our cut...
- Stay right there!

193
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,259
...from every retail shop,

194
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,097
every construction project,
every trash pickup.

195
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,737
It's all ours.

196
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,363
Oh. Our trash.

197
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,607
Yeah. It's all ours.

198
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,376
It must hurt not getting picked by Don Carini.

199
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,070
Shut up.

200
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,580
We can't take this mamaluke
on rounds.

201
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,014
He's gonna make us look bad.

202
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,311
I know. I know.

203
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,720
Oop. Don't move!

204
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,182
- What is wrong with him?
- Look at this cucumber.

205
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,464
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on.

206
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,769
- Come on.
- Sit down right here.

207
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,260
Sit.

208
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,569
Okay. We got some important
business to attend to.

209
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,769
We're gonna take a walk
around the block, okay?

210
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,869
Our block?

211
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,743
That's right, our block.

212
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,180
And I need for you to sit right here
and not move.

213
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,275
Can you do that?
Sit. Stay.

214
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,513
I like stay. I don't move.

215
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,543
Good boy.

216
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,385
- Good boy.
- Don't lose your hat.

217
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,583
Okay.

218
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,019
I don't care what Carini says.

219
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,527
This idiot's gonna wreck everything.

220
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,723
He looks older than my Uncle Eddie.

221
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,096
He looks older than your Uncle Eddie's
Uncle Eddie.

222
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:57,261
Those orphanages ain't exactly
the fountain of youth.

223
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,793
You think they're giving 'em
enough milk?

224
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,234
They should give kids more milk
in the orphanages.

225
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,725
Wow.

226
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,729
Wow.

227
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,526
Whoa!

228
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,400
Wow!

229
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,469
Ooh! Too big, huh?

230
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,993
Okay.

231
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,339
What is this?

232
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,879
Underpants.

233
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,213
Okay.

234
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,416
Help!

235
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,228
Hey, you're coming
with me, all right?

236
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,822
You're coming with me!

237
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,889
Don't fight!

238
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,093
Get out of here, you bum!

239
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,460
Get outta here!

240
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,335
Hey, I save you, don't worry.

241
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,182
You're coming with me
all right? Come on!

242
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,209
Stop!

243
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,715
Good smell!

244
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,021
Good feeling!

245
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,558
Okay. I'm save you. Okay?

246
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,771
Okay, I got you.

247
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,040
- Vinnie?
- You okay?

248
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,140
You know you're not supposed
to be in the park alone.

249
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,416
- Nancy!
- Nancy?

250
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:55,381
Hey! Get out of here!

251
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,492
What are you doing, Younggu?

252
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:03,988
You can't leave him alone
for a second.

253
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,394
I told you to sit on the bench!

254
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:06,720
Hat.

255
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,233
Hat? You forgot your hat
again, didn't you?

256
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,864
You forget that hat again,
I'm gonna staple it to your head!

257
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,207
Come on!

258
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,232
You can't leave this guy alone!

259
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:29,087
Oh, I like Nancy.

260
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,923
Who? Nancy Bonfante?

261
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,117
Yes.

262
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,127
Don Bonfante's daughter?
Get outta here!

263
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,822
Nancy pretty.

264
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,330
Let me tell you something,
Younggu.

265
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,663
Nancy Bonfante is off limits.

266
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,065
She's trouble with a capital T.

267
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,535
She's a Bonfante,

268
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,300
and Carinis do not socialize
with Bonfantes.

269
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,432
Like Romeo and that broad.

270
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,806
It ain't never gonna happen.

271
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,937
She's the daughter of
your father's sworn enemy.

272
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,344
Here, Tony.

273
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,910
Pete pays us. For protection.

274
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,785
It's one of the many services we provide.

275
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,924
Immigrants such as yourself
come to this country with nothing,

276
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,155
and they all wanna grab
a slice of the American dream.

277
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,596
But who's gonna help them?
Huh? Banks? No.

278
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,031
Cops? Forget about it.

279
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,259
We're gonna help them,
but for a small weekly gratuity.

280
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,332
- You get it?
- I know.

281
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,803
That leprechaun, he's missed
two payments already.

282
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:29,438
Three and he's out.

283
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,573
Well, let's finish our pizza

284
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:34,052
and then we'll beat him until he tells us
where his pot of gold is.

285
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:42,983
Want some?

286
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,557
He's an animal.

287
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,758
I good choice.

288
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,231
So, I'm telling you, man,

289
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,466
I was like, bada-bing, bada-bang,
pop, pop, pow.

290
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,700
There was this other guy there.

291
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,706
Yeah, I lumped him up, too.

292
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,869
He was very heroic.

293
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,379
I do what I can.

294
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,108
My hero.

295
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,776
What were you doing in the park
by yourself, anyway?

296
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,184
I was coming back from volunteering
at the orphanage.

297
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,420
All the time at this orphanage.

298
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,755
And what is with
this volunteering, Nancy?

299
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,384
It's a waste of time.

300
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,224
I don't see it as wasting
my time, Daddy.

301
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,354
I like giving back.

302
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,625
Oh, really?

303
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,259
Nancy, you listen to me.

304
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,895
In this world, you don't give.

305
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,871
In this world, you take!

306
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,372
But those kids have nobody.

307
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,375
They're not supposed to have anybody.

308
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,603
They're orphans.

309
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:38,342
Vinnie, I guess I gotta thank you
for what you did for Nancy.

310
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,783
If anything had happened
to her, forget about it.

311
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,253
- Forget about it.
- Forget about it.

312
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,277
Yeah, forget about it.

313
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,450
That's what I said!

314
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,323
Did you get a look at the animal
who attacked her?

315
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,590
Yeah, it was one
of those Carini scums.

316
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,859
No. He didn't act like
he was part of an organization.

317
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,195
He was--

318
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,064
He's lucky I didn't put
an ice pick in his eye

319
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,261
and throw him in the river!

320
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,827
All right?
Those Carinis are animals!

321
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,738
I'd never let anything
happen to you, though.

322
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,374
You know that. Ever.

323
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,905
We can do this all day.

324
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,918
It's like Christmas in spring here.

325
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,180
I love the cold.

326
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,962
What the hell are you guys doin' here?

327
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,331
What's the matter with you?

328
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,598
This isn't what--
I told you to torture him not tickle him!

329
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,104
It wasn't my idea.

330
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,072
Not your idea! What,
you taking orders from him now?

331
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,369
I left you in charge!

332
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:37,534
The Younggu Carini.

333
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,565
Stop!

334
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,378
Oh! God bless you, Tony V!

335
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:43,939
Now flip him over!

336
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,950
All right. Here you go.

337
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,678
He likes Christmas carols.

338
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,584
All right. All right with the ice.
All right.

339
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,720
Okay, Younggu.

340
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,165
Now, the Carinis are all about
maintaining the order of things.

341
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,099
All right? We're like
the neighborhood watch.

342
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,999
One big, happy family.

343
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,698
And like any family,
sometimes you gotta send...

344
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,273
the ultimate message.

345
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,405
Capisce?

346
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,434
Quiche.

347
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,380
Quiche.
Stand him up.

348
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,283
Come on.

349
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,651
- No, no.
- Stay!

350
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,814
Don't move.

351
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,982
Tony, Don Carini's not gonna like this.

352
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,423
We're just supposed to rough this guy up.

353
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,324
Shut up, Macho. Okay.

354
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,056
How we gonna get our money
if the guy is dead?

355
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:32,563
Shut up, Macho. Okay.

356
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:33,963
I'm just saying.

357
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,988
You're just saying?

358
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,193
Now, listen to me,
you big gabone.

359
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,635
Don Carini wants him to take over
the family. Huh?

360
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,570
All right, so we gotta make sure
he's up for the job.

361
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,599
- It's a test.
- Oh, a test?

362
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,610
- Yes.
- I'm bad at tests.

363
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,171
Well, it's not your test.
Now shut your pie hole.

364
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,645
Okay, Younggu.

365
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,809
Now you gotta show me
that you can do it.

366
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,614
- Capisce?
- Quiche.

367
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,211
- Quiche.
- What shall I do?

368
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:59,789
Okay!

369
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,330
I'm getting tired of this.
Gimme this thing!

370
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,702
Tony, please.
This is a test, right?

371
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,604
I want my money!

372
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,515
Tomorrow! Tomorrow!

373
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,365
Don Carini.

374
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,634
I'd like a word with you in private.

375
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,199
Later, Tony.

376
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,609
I wanna talk to Younggu
about the future.

377
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,942
Yeah, well, that's the thing.

378
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,914
I think we should have
a conversation, too.

379
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,142
Not now.

380
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,844
I wanna spend time with my boy.

381
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,213
- Younggu, my son.
- My father.

382
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,459
I thought you always worked
the garden with Don Carini.

383
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,828
Apparently not.

384
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,663
But the tomatoes, that was your thing
with Don Carini, right?

385
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,262
Yeah. Well, now it's Younggu's thing.

386
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:21,196
No!

387
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,230
Cow shi--poo.

388
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:24,674
It don't seem right.

389
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,238
Don Carini has you working the soil,
sowing the seeds, irrigating.

390
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,112
It's like those are your tomatoes.

391
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,310
Yeah. Well, now they're
Younggu's tomatoes.

392
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,419
No! Poo-poo.

393
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,922
Go figure.

394
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:40,481
He eats the tomato you nurtured.

395
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:41,992
Nobody's gonna be eating any tomatoes

396
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,052
if that idiot takes over the family.

397
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,792
Well, that's a shame,
'cause those are beefsteak tomatoes.

398
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,299
Will you forget about the tomatoes?!

399
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,028
It's not about the tomatoes!

400
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,036
If this guy takes over the family,
we're finished!

401
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,697
We gotta save the family!

402
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,631
And the tomatoes.

403
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:59,371
We gotta save Don Carini
from his own good intentions.

404
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:01,538
You ain't saying
what I think you're saying.

405
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,638
I don't know what you're thinking,

406
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,114
but if you say tomatoes
one more time,

407
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,174
I'm gonna put two bullets
in your squash.

408
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,076
That's zucchini.

409
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,912
I'm surrounded by morons.

410
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,152
Squash.

411
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,329
Hi-ho, Silver!.

412
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,393
A fiery horse
with the speed of light.

413
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:28,634
A cloud of dust
and a hearty hi-ho, Silver.

414
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,732
The Lone Ranger.

415
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,539
What, are you watching TV?

416
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,374
Come on, that's the Lone Ranger.

417
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,675
The guy's unbelievable.

418
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,376
Don't forget about his trusted
lndian sidekick, Tonto.

419
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,475
Tonto.

420
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:40,542
That's like us, Vinnie.

421
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,574
We're your Tonto.

422
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,579
That's what worries me
about youse two.

423
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,591
You can't do anything right.

424
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,616
You're supposed to make me
look good in Nancy's eyes,

425
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,594
but instead, you chase her
for three blocks

426
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:53,325
and you get beat up in the park
by some bozo.

427
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,265
That other guy,
I saw him walking away

428
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,995
with Tony V and Macho.

429
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,332
You sure?

430
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,066
Yeah. He was with the Carinis.

431
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,131
That must be Don Carini's son.

432
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,901
That makes perfect sense.

433
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,570
So, like, you ain't mad at me no more--

434
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,101
Shut up!

435
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,784
You left him alone?

436
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,787
We had a little business
to take care of.

437
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:17,254
You left him alone.

438
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,212
Yes, Don, yes.

439
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,384
And for that, I truly apologize.

440
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,360
But there's something
bigger going on here.

441
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:25,124
It's something we can't ignore.

442
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:26,460
And that would be?

443
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,261
These are mean streets.

444
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,564
Not everybody's cut out
for our line of work.

445
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,502
I mean, to survive in this game

446
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:36,371
you gotta have endurance,
discipline, strength.

447
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,239
You gotta know how
to take care of yourself.

448
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,709
And I think it's pretty obvious

449
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:44,443
that Younggu is a little lacking,
you know, in these arenas.

450
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,039
You're right.

451
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,610
He is a little soft.

452
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,086
Grew up without a father.

453
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,986
I can't deny the truth.

454
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,788
I know what we must do.

455
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,349
I'm sure this must be hard.

456
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:57,156
Not really.

457
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,254
You need to teach him
how to fight like a man.

458
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,286
What?

459
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,800
Anthony, if he is going to survive,

460
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:03,960
he needs to learn how to fight.

461
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,629
Who better to teach him than you?

462
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,967
I didn't mean that.

463
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,097
That's not what I meant.
What I meant was--

464
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:09,697
I don't care what you meant.

465
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:11,333
Take him into the gym.

466
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:13,344
Teach him how to defend himself.

467
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,836
- Capisce?
- Capisce.

468
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,246
Listen up.

469
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:30,156
Oops!

470
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,096
You are now part of the Carini family,

471
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,362
and you must protect that family,

472
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:38,664
no matter what you're up against.

473
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,692
You understand me?

474
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:40,727
Okay.

475
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,763
You're here to learn about
street fighting.

476
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,275
There's no Marquess of Queensberry rules
out there.

477
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,039
Out there it's anything goes.

478
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,572
Pick it up.

479
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,514
Anything can happen at any point.

480
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,177
What's the matter with you?
Pick it up.

481
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,947
Pay attention!

482
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:56,916
You--

483
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,984
What are you laughing at?

484
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,731
No, relax, Tony.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

485
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,067
Calm, calm, calm down.

486
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,537
Just take it easy, all right?

487
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,597
What are you laughing at?

488
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,629
Nothing.

489
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,700
Yeah? It's not funny, huh?
It better not be.

490
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,540
This is life or death out there.

491
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,241
Drop your bats.

492
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:25,181
Drop it!

493
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,615
Pay attention!

494
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,783
Very good. Watch.

495
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:34,219
Very good. Your turn.

496
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,653
Very--No, no good.

497
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,327
Younggu!

498
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:42,423
Will you catch it?

499
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,459
Tony, you're gonna fracture his skull!

500
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:46,492
He's gotta catch it!

501
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,835
All right, but take it easy.

502
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,169
All right. He's all right.

503
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,606
Calm down.

504
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,666
Pick these bats up.

505
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,701
- Pick it up.
- Okay.

506
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,713
All right.
I want you two, attack me, okay?

507
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:56,805
Give me everything you've got.

508
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:58,839
Lay me out.
Show him how it's done.

509
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:02,744
All right.

510
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,685
Wow!

511
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,015
Here we go.

512
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:11,985
Wow!

513
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,898
Okay. Now I am going to attack you.

514
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,232
Okay. Okay.

515
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,600
Hold.

516
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,104
Okay.

517
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,238
Why is hitting me?

518
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,977
What? You think your enemy

519
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,451
is going to attack you
the same way every time?

520
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,953
Your enemy is smart.

521
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,421
He's gonna change
his tactics every time.

522
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:39,582
One more time.

523
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,251
I like slowly.

524
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,385
Slowly? Okay.

525
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,730
Very good.

526
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,032
- You--
- No, no, no.

527
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,939
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

528
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,944
Wait. Tony, I don't like this!

529
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,206
You got that look in your eye.

530
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,111
Now, this is our boss' son.

531
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,479
You cannot hurt him bad.

532
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,505
Calm down.

533
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,415
He's a quick learner.

534
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,786
Let's start him in collections. Okay?

535
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,291
- Okay.
- All right.

536
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,826
You're gonna be in collections, okay?

537
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,852
All right.

538
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:22,799
All right. All right.
Good guy.

539
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,032
What, are you out of your mind?

540
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:28,664
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

541
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,675
Gimme the money.

542
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,204
Carini family.

543
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,241
Mom, more, more, more, more.

544
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,847
Don't worry.

545
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,186
Whoa. One...

546
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:11,908
You took what?

547
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,284
Delicious.

548
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,453
Everybody don't want to pay.

549
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,859
Of course they don't want pay--

550
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,265
to pay.

551
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,394
Nobody wants to pay.

552
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,734
You gotta make them pay.

553
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,364
And what is that you're wearing?

554
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:37,033
You look like a bum!

555
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,600
Bum look like me.

556
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,770
What the hell's wrong with you?

557
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,782
Listen to me, Younggu.

558
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,340
This ain't a charity we're running here.

559
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,249
This is a business.

560
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,345
And I expect everyone
in the Carini family

561
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,650
to be an earner.

562
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,448
Sorry, Father.

563
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:56,551
It's okay.
Everybody's got to learn sometime.

564
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:59,495
The Carinis take money
and make money.

565
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,893
Don't worry.

566
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,763
No. Don't touch me.

567
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,496
Okay. I take money.

568
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,665
Inside very hot.

569
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,765
Yeah, well, take that schmatta off.

570
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,712
Oh, money!

571
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:22,447
Hey, what are you doing?

572
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,955
I take money.

573
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,854
You throw money.
I take money.

574
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,654
No, we're pitching pennies.

575
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,355
You know, pitching pennies?
It's a game.

576
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,455
I take your money!

577
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,590
Come on! Give it back!

578
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,564
Give it back. It's ours.

579
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,929
Get back. He's got a gun!

580
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:38,999
Take all the money you want.

581
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:40,664
We don't want to cause any trouble.

582
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:45,709
Okay. I have to make money
because, uh...

583
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:47,366
I'm mafia.

584
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,836
Here. Take it.

585
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,746
Oh, thank you. You, too.

586
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:55,480
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

587
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,680
- Let's go.
- It's you.

588
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:59,019
Oh, it's me.

589
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,525
I never got a chance
to thank you for the other day.

590
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,187
You welcome.

591
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,560
My name is Nancy.

592
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,586
I'm Younggu.

593
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,292
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.

594
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,028
So, you like children.

595
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:13,060
Of course. Childrens is very kind.

596
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:15,334
I'm actually on my way
to visit some kids right now.

597
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,170
Would you like to join me?

598
00:31:20,645 --> 00:31:22,442
You didn't have to bring
everything at once, you know.

599
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:27,375
I'm okay. Don't worry.

600
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:28,510
Hi, Nancy!

601
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,214
Would you look at those angels?

602
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,620
See how bright their smiles are?

603
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,214
They are orphans?

604
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,555
Yes, orphans.

605
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:37,584
I come here once a week
to play with them.

606
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,823
Ooh, ooh, Theresa!

607
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,355
Younggu?

608
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,459
- Glove.
- Thanks.

609
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,696
Doll.

610
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,829
Tan-tan.

611
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,635
Oh. Beautiful, eh?

612
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:50,732
Beautiful!

613
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,373
You got any marbles?

614
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,209
Good price.

615
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,647
How do you know Younggu?

616
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,445
I took care of him in Korea.

617
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,947
He was all alone
just like these children.

618
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,183
All God's children are special.

619
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:14,822
Younggu is just a little...
more special.

620
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,658
Sorry.

621
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,829
Next time.

622
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,566
Don't cry. Don't cry.

623
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,233
Younggu isn't like the other orphans.

624
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,174
In fact, Younggu isn't an orphan at all.

625
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,506
He has a father.

626
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,011
Younggu has a father?

627
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,712
Don Carini.

628
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:38,651
Eew. Yuck.

629
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,604
The children have to leave
the orphanage soon.

630
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,070
Why? Why leaving children?

631
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:03,805
Well, the orphanage is closing.

632
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:04,974
Closing?

633
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,779
There's no money to keep it running.

634
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,144
Nancy, you help children.

635
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,152
Me? What can I do?

636
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:15,182
I try to get my father to help,

637
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,990
but these things don't interest him.

638
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,691
Oh. Okay, don't worry.

639
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,666
I help your children.

640
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,163
- Here.
- Fork give big problem.

641
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:30,765
Let me help you.

642
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:37,345
Oh, boy. Vinnie is really
not gonna like this.

643
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:40,311
Oh, boy, we gotta go.

644
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:46,550
What? You did what?

645
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,456
You were with who?

646
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,222
Unlike some people I know,

647
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,423
Younggu knows how
to treat a woman.

648
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,829
Are you thinking straight?

649
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,163
We are at war with them,

650
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,828
and you're having dinner
with Carini's son?

651
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,201
I hear he's a dim-wit.

652
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:02,206
Papa, he's sweet.

653
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,471
You are not to see him again,
and that is final!

654
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,208
Can you believe this Carini?

655
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,186
He's siccing his sick son on my Nancy!

656
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,879
Don't worry, boss.
I'll make sure it never happens again.

657
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,090
You'll make sure?

658
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,693
What are you thinking, Vinnie?

659
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,167
That's messy.

660
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,666
It'll send a message.

661
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,749
Now what are they up to?

662
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,186
Carini's hijacked another truck
from the airport.

663
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,315
They're unloading
the cargo right now.

664
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,723
Boy, they just don't stop.

665
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,954
What the hell's going on?

666
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,621
How long's it gonna take us
to unload a truck?

667
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,824
I thought you told me there
was only a few on here.

668
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,765
It was only a few. I don't know.

669
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,926
You don't know?
What's the matter?

670
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:06,368
You're supposed
to make the count!

671
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,371
This is ridiculous at this point.

672
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,395
Come on!

673
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,840
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong.

674
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,366
Put 'em on the--

675
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,849
What are you doing, Younggu?

676
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,044
My shoe is under the wheel.

677
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:26,454
Oh, that's it. Youse guys finish.

678
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,981
I'm taking a break!

679
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,789
What? Push the cart!

680
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,756
Okay.

681
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:38,132
Then one-shoe comes along,
and now I'm unloading crates!

682
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,466
We're out here because of you!

683
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,528
I ain't doing it anymore!

684
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,129
- You and that moron over there!
- I'll get coffee.

685
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,271
Now you got me upset!

686
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,075
Let's go.

687
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,648
Look at that!

688
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,516
All right, new game, new game.

689
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,317
Better be a new game.
You're down a C-note.

690
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,823
Yeah, well, I know,
give me another--

691
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,084
Fizzing ball.

692
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:07,359
No, no, no!

693
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,763
Don't do that!

694
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:12,426
What was that?

695
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,960
What?

696
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,613
What's going on?

697
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,644
Younggu saved our lives.

698
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,588
He threw the live bomb away.

699
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:37,522
That's my boy!

700
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:39,223
- You okay?
- Okay.

701
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,226
You see that, Tony?
I know what I'm doing.

702
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,266
I got incredible instincts
when it comes to matters of character.

703
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:49,933
If I didn't pick right,
we'd all be dead now.

704
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,399
Younggu, come here.

705
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,974
My son, I'm so proud of you.

706
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,570
Thank you.

707
00:36:57,181 --> 00:37:00,673
Anybody that questions
Younggu's place in this family

708
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,516
needs to be reminded
of what we all saw today.

709
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,654
Raw heroism.

710
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,318
Valor. Balls.

711
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:13,027
Big, brass Carini balls.

712
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,199
Look what they did to my baby!

713
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,865
I just had it waxed!

714
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:23,996
The Bonfantes just upped the ante.

715
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,235
They wanna play?

716
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,138
We're gonna show 'em how we play.

717
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,729
Bonfante doesn't know it,
but he's eating his last supper.

718
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,602
We're not gonna get within
50 feet of Raffaelo's.

719
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,765
Yes, we are.

720
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,735
Younggu, stay here.

721
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,108
I want you to hit the detonator
when you hear me whistle.

722
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,803
Capisce?

723
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,104
Quiche.

724
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,376
Okay. Whistle.

725
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,106
Careful. Careful.

726
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,210
Okay. Come around here. Come.

727
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,460
- Tony?
- What?

728
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,627
That bakery?

729
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:26,000
We're not gonna blow up
the bakery, are we?

730
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,967
- Tony, it's a very good bakery.
- Just shut up, Macho!

731
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,542
Their cannolis are fabulous.
I just think...

732
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,581
- You know I'm allergic to fish.
- Will you shut up, Macho?

733
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,947
- I have asthma.
- Just get in there!

734
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,281
- I'm allergic to fish!
- Get in here!

735
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,581
I'm allergic to fish.

736
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,335
Let's get out of here!

737
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,462
Things are getting messy,

738
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,303
and I don't like it
when things get messy.

739
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,101
You know what happens
when things get messy?

740
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,617
Take a shower.

741
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,278
Don Carini, all due respect.

742
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,547
If we weren't baby-sitting
Younggu here,

743
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,059
we could get a hell of a lot
more stuff done.

744
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,255
You have a problem
with my flesh and blood?

745
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,388
I'm just saying.

746
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,159
I don't care what you're saying.

747
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,860
There's a war going on here.

748
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,663
I want Bonfante dead,

749
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,329
and I want Younggu to do it.

750
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,306
All due respect,
I think that's a very bad idea.

751
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,205
All due respect, shut your mouth!

752
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,336
Younggu is gonna take
Bonfante out tomorrow

753
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:44,674
when that old guinea
takes his daily walk.

754
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,212
You think you can do that?

755
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:48,983
Okay!

756
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,044
Take him to the zoo, huh?

757
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,618
All right, all right.
Come here. Come here.

758
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,524
All right, now make
your father proud.

759
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,550
Okay.

760
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,723
Get outta here, will ya?
Go, go.

761
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:04,528
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

762
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:06,428
This is never gonna work.

763
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,665
What do you mean?
It's a win-win.

764
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:09,934
What are you talking about?

765
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,169
Look, either one of two things
are gonna happen.

766
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,235
Younggu's gonna whack
Don Bonfante, it's a win, right?

767
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,645
Or, he don't, but he gets pinched
by the cops.

768
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:18,773
That's a win, too.

769
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,784
He goes upstate
for a quick two to five.

770
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,718
Our guys up there look out for him.

771
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,880
In the meantime, Don Carini
comes to his senses

772
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,186
and realizes there's better
qualified candidates

773
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,419
to take over the family.
Win-win.

774
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,587
- You really got this thought out.
- Yeah.

775
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,194
One of us here needs a brain.

776
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,245
Come on. It's 5 till 10:00.

777
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,045
I'll buy you a hotdog.

778
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,516
I'll have a hotdog,

779
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,681
extra onions, extra relish.

780
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,189
Cheese, kraut, catsup.

781
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:04,592
You got anchovies?

782
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,858
Come on,
what's the matter with you?

783
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,523
Right on time.

784
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,401
Thank you, Don Bonfante.

785
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,251
This looks nice today.

786
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,315
You can smell the flowers.

787
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,119
Okay.

788
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,321
Oops.

789
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,356
- Come on.
- I didn't eat my hot dog.

790
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,697
This is not win-win.

791
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,202
Shut up and let's go!

792
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,810
Where is he?

793
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,020
Hey! Hey!

794
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,387
That's Younggu!

795
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,027
That's Younggu?

796
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:17,699
Get him!

797
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,029
Hey, watch it!

798
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:25,837
Get in!

799
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,145
Tony! Tony!

800
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,151
Tony!

801
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,720
Tony!

802
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:41,850
Go! Go! Go!

803
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,362
Tony, you gotta slow down!

804
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,922
Stop the car! Tony!

805
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:53,336
Maybe this was a mistake
bringing you here.

806
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,140
Wishful thinking on my part.

807
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,438
You're not a mobster, Younggu.

808
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,808
You're not from these streets.

809
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:03,073
You're not cut out for the life.

810
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:05,741
Sorry I fail you.

811
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,580
No, Younggu!

812
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,413
I'm the one who has failed you.

813
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,719
I was not there to father you properly

814
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,315
and guide you down our path.

815
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,356
And now it's too late.

816
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,594
I got a lot of thinking to do.

817
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,930
Leave me be.

818
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,397
I want to be alone.

819
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,372
Sorry, Father.

820
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,591
I'm gonna fix this.

821
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,283
Oh, Soo Mi.

822
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,430
You make money?

823
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:03,592
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

824
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,033
- Yes.
- Yeah? When?

825
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,093
Now, now, now, now.

826
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,125
- Yeah.
- Now?

827
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,036
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah?

828
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,405
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

829
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,482
- You make money, okay?
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

830
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,518
I'm mafia, huh?

831
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,686
Understand?

832
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:31,888
Yes.

833
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,568
Oh.

834
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,804
Mr. Carini?

835
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,972
I'm sorry, I didn't...

836
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,878
You make money, huh?

837
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,041
Aah! What are you doing?

838
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,519
Understand? I'm mafia.

839
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,853
Mr. Carini!

840
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,091
You make money, huh?

841
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:04,784
Here.

842
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:18,406
Oh. Hmm.

843
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,057
You have money, huh?

844
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,858
Hey, you, huh?

845
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:46,332
You!

846
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,067
You!

847
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:49,028
You!

848
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:58,614
You!

849
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:08,785
Good. Good!

850
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,993
We've located Younggu, and, um...

851
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:48,887
you're not going to like it.

852
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:50,991
Did the Bonfantes get to him?

853
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,058
No.

854
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:55,063
Younggu's decided
to take over collections

855
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,573
and he's asserting himself
in the neighborhood.

856
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,235
What's so bad about that?

857
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,404
Don Carini, I have been loyal
to you from day one.

858
00:48:02,446 --> 00:48:05,074
I would never, ever
try to betray you

859
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:06,639
or any of your wishes.

860
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,516
All due respect,
I think it would be wise

861
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,851
to send Younggu away for a while.

862
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,722
He's my son.
He's my flesh and blood!

863
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:18,524
I know. But, Don Carini,
you got to admit,

864
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,860
he's just not cut out
for this line of work.

865
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,423
And you and I both know
what happens to people

866
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,095
who are too weak
to survive in our business.

867
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,835
One-two, one-two.
That's it.

868
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:35,401
Hold it up. Slow.

869
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,844
There he is.

870
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,541
Body, head. Go!

871
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,913
Look, he's working out.

872
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,350
Getting stronger.
Trying to make the grade.

873
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,412
Maybe it's not as bad
as you think.

874
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,414
Yeah? We'll see.

875
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,721
Hey, Younggu!

876
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,562
One swing, three knockouts.

877
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,232
Gimme some time alone
with my boy.

878
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:06,805
Younggu, what's all this?

879
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,641
You want tiger,
I become tiger.

880
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:24,553
Younggu, we need to talk.

881
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,295
As a father I wanted
to teach you everything,

882
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,928
give you everything.

883
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,598
Make up for lost time.

884
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:37,930
But you know what?

885
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,406
This business ain't for you.

886
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,943
This life is tough and rough
and dangerous.

887
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,846
Oh, you mistake.

888
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,782
I'm tough and rough.

889
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,787
No. You got your mother's sensitivity,

890
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,982
and that can be put to better use.

891
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,687
It's just that you are not
cut out for the life.

892
00:49:57,728 --> 00:49:59,252
Understand.

893
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,287
No make you proud.

894
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,958
It ain't that.

895
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,867
Look, if anything happened to you,

896
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,733
I couldn't live with myself.

897
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,832
I just think maybe it's better
if we find you another place.

898
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,606
Younggu go?

899
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:16,043
No. I'll set you up in a front.

900
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,274
You can live
the straight and narrow life.

901
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,681
But I don't think there's
any place for you

902
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,651
in the family business.

903
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,517
Understand.

904
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:25,748
Don Carini.

905
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:28,848
Don Carini.

906
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,860
I thought I told you to wait outside.

907
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:33,454
I know, I know, but you're
never gonna believe this.

908
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:37,663
Really?

909
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,001
Really?

910
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,730
My boy.

911
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,401
Mwah!

912
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,077
Come here, come here, you.

913
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,311
My boy.

914
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,215
That's my boy!

915
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,821
Thank you, Don Carini.
Thank you, Younggu.

916
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:04,452
It's the mini-skirt,
the new fashion.

917
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,483
I owe you everything!

918
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:06,655
Thank you.

919
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,720
Father, beautiful.

920
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:17,262
Thank you, Don Carini.
Thank you, Younggu.

921
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,207
Wow.

922
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,019
Younggu, you're a genius!

923
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,543
Look.

924
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,680
Beehive.

925
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,186
It's so good.

926
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:40,955
Hey, what's in this?

927
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,023
Two all beef patties,
special sauce,

928
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:48,060
Iettuce, cheese, pickles, onions
on a sesame seed bun.

929
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:55,238
Hey, Mac, what do you call it?

930
00:51:56,379 --> 00:51:58,244
Big, huh? Too big.

931
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,270
Big Mac, huh?

932
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,546
Big Mac.

933
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:03,018
That's got a nice ring to it.

934
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:04,520
A Big Mac.

935
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,886
Oh, thank you, Younggu.

936
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,619
You saved my diner with the Big Mac.

937
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,627
I got over 500 served!

938
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:14,630
- Congratulation.
- Thank you.

939
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:18,425
Big Mac.

940
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,586
Father, Younggu still go?

941
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:42,887
Forget about it.

942
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:44,894
You ain't going nowhere, sonny boy.

943
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:52,228
The shopkeepers
in the Carini neighborhood,

944
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:54,669
they wanna pay
more protection money

945
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,296
than they are supposed to.

946
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,302
It's all because of Younggu.

947
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:00,332
Nancy, please!

948
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,441
Times are hard,
business is down,

949
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,174
our own shops are dying,

950
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,239
and the Carini shops
want to pay more?

951
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,013
Yeah. Our own people
from our own neighborhood,

952
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,452
they want to go over
to the Carini part of town.

953
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,252
They want to shop and they want
to dine out over there.

954
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,952
He's just got this way about him.

955
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,756
He brings out the kindness
in upstanding people.

956
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:21,355
Nancy, please,
he tried to kill your own father!

957
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,558
- What?
- Vinnie.

958
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,566
That can't be true.

959
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,568
Well, it is true.
I saw it with my own two eyes.

960
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,830
Well, there must be some mistake.

961
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,859
Yeah, there is a mistake

962
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:28,928
and you know what the mistake is?

963
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,567
It's talking business
with you in the room!

964
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,135
You know she's got
the hots for him, right?

965
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:39,114
That's my daughter
you're talking about!

966
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,138
Don, listen, please.

967
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:42,913
All I'm saying is, they've been
spending a lot of time together

968
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:44,614
and it just ain't natural.

969
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:49,023
Vinnie, do you have something
that you want to say to me?

970
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,752
All right, I want everyone to listen up.

971
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:59,794
The stronger the Carinis get,
the weaker the Bonfantes get.

972
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,463
Now, I don't want to hear excuses.

973
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,836
I don't want to hear explanations.

974
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,898
I want results!

975
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:09,503
Now, who is gonna step up
and give me results?

976
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:16,515
When's the old man gonna learn
it's better to listen to me?

977
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,417
Well, you know, you were talking
about his daughter, Vinnie.

978
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,254
What does she see in that guy?
He's a half breed.

979
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,126
Half breed? Like...

980
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,321
Tonto.

981
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:28,861
It's time I make my move.

982
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,195
Back to Jersey.

983
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:31,894
Get outta here!

984
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,267
What? Just trying to cheer you up.

985
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,718
Younggu.

986
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,380
Oh, Nancy.

987
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,116
Mary told me you saved her shop.

988
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:54,453
Oh, of course.

989
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,482
So, how do I look?

990
00:54:56,526 --> 00:54:59,051
Oh, beautiful.

991
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,221
Look, I brought you wine.

992
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,958
No, thank you.

993
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,458
Hey, what are you doing?

994
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,798
Let me take you around town.

995
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,302
Around town?

996
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:08,929
Okay.

997
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:18,704
Okay, let's go.

998
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,306
Where's she going?

999
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,928
Oh, beautiful park.

1000
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,259
And a beautiful day.

1001
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:36,822
Yes, beautiful day.

1002
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:39,926
Oh, I like a treat, hmm?

1003
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,765
Nancy.

1004
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:57,275
Lover.

1005
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,050
- Oh, Flower.
- Pretty.

1006
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:03,582
Oh, beautiful.

1007
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:09,357
- I give to you.
- Oh, so sweet.

1008
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,214
Before we go any farther,
I have to ask you something.

1009
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:28,114
Oh, honey.

1010
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:29,846
This is difficult.

1011
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,480
I mean, Vinnie and my father
are under the crazy impression

1012
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,514
that you tried to, you know...

1013
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,025
Okay. Honey.

1014
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:41,161
Oh, it's hard for me to even fathom.
I mean, you wouldn't hurt a fly.

1015
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,494
Oh, don't move.

1016
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,100
Aah! It went down my sweater!

1017
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,698
Okay, don't worry.

1018
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:56,545
Sweet mother of God!

1019
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,172
That's stamina.

1020
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,206
Shut up.

1021
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:07,684
You know, I bet that guy
uses the dust of rhino horns

1022
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:11,490
as an aphrodisiac,
because he's an animal.

1023
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,257
Bye-bye, honey.

1024
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,339
Wow.

1025
00:57:29,012 --> 00:57:30,274
Thank you.

1026
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,076
You really wouldn't hurt a fly.

1027
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,886
Bye-bye.

1028
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,366
Younggu, my son.

1029
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,068
What was I thinking?

1030
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:01,708
You're a genius.

1031
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,974
Business is better than ever.

1032
00:58:04,013 --> 00:58:06,345
Whatever you want, say the word.

1033
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:08,840
To Younggu!

1034
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,217
Salute!.

1035
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,086
To my father!

1036
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:19,754
Salad!

1037
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,264
Salad! Salad!

1038
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,660
Have fun.

1039
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,170
Hey, Younggu,
you wanna dance?

1040
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,544
Ooh! Scared.

1041
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,355
Would you like to dance with me?

1042
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,796
Oh, Nancy.

1043
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,867
What are you doing?

1044
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,965
Tony! Where is Nancy?

1045
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,475
What?

1046
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,534
Look at this guy. Come on.

1047
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:17,273
Yeah.

1048
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:19,779
Everybody...

1049
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,909
To Nancy! Salad!

1050
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,183
To who?

1051
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:25,585
Nancy.

1052
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,858
To Nancy Bonfante?

1053
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:32,461
Yes, Nancy.

1054
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,861
What are you, a wise guy?

1055
01:00:34,897 --> 01:00:36,387
You don't toast a Bonfante.

1056
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,899
They're our sworn enemy.

1057
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,902
Nancy kind.

1058
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:40,960
Kind?

1059
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:42,733
She's a Bonfante.

1060
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,603
Kind Bonfante.

1061
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,741
Listen to me, Younggu.

1062
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,869
The Bonfantes want our business.

1063
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,776
They want our territory.

1064
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,805
And they would kill any of us
just to get their hands on it.

1065
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:57,946
You don't ever toast a Bonfante,
unless you're burying one.

1066
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,955
But I like Nancy.

1067
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,349
What is wrong with you?

1068
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,589
Stupid boy!

1069
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,827
Macho, put down the bakery.

1070
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:14,166
Make sure he's okay.

1071
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:15,693
Yeah, boss.

1072
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,215
There you are.

1073
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:31,919
Aw, don't let it bother you, Younggu.

1074
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,285
We've all been there.

1075
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:38,082
I remember one time
I forgot to pay off a judge.

1076
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,793
Your father ripped me a new one.

1077
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:45,631
Oh! I was so upset,
I didn't eat for a day.

1078
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,533
What are you doing, Younggu?

1079
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:58,343
Oh, Macho.
Oh, I have shamed my family.

1080
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,709
Forget about it.

1081
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:02,877
Just don't toast the enemy again.

1082
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:03,908
Capisce?

1083
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:05,250
Quiche.

1084
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:08,018
But Nancy not enemy.

1085
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:11,322
Look, Younggu,
women are very complicated.

1086
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,191
It's not their fault.

1087
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,197
They have curves
in all the right places

1088
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,528
and they smell nice.

1089
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:18,261
But so does a calzone.

1090
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,394
But I like Nancy, you understand?

1091
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:21,994
Yes, I understand.

1092
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,734
I also understand
that Vinnie likes Nancy,

1093
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,641
which means now Vinnie
has a problem with you.

1094
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,144
Next thing you know

1095
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:32,147
we got bullets and blood
and bodies in the street,

1096
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:34,240
all because you like Nancy.

1097
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:35,773
Macho, stop, please.

1098
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,683
My head hurt.

1099
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:41,953
I think I got a cure for that.

1100
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:42,980
Forget about it.

1101
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,083
Let's go.

1102
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,629
Wow!

1103
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,948
We as men have appetites.
Appetites that must be filled.

1104
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,713
But there are many choices
on the menu.

1105
01:03:14,757 --> 01:03:17,282
I mean, I love pasta,

1106
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,624
but I couldn't eat it every day.

1107
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:26,560
Sometimes I like rump roast.

1108
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,400
To roast!

1109
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:34,206
Sometimes I like leg of lamb.

1110
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:37,212
To lamb!

1111
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:42,951
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for breast of chicken.

1112
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:45,351
To chicken!

1113
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,151
I like crab!

1114
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,058
Crabs?
Nah, I don't like crabs.

1115
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,287
Hey, what's this?

1116
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,522
You two are best friends now?

1117
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:56,464
Oh, Tony V, you like big sausage?

1118
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,932
You like sausage!

1119
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:01,459
Yeah. So?
What the hell's so funny?

1120
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,665
I've been looking everywhere
for you two gabones,

1121
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:04,934
and this is where I find you?

1122
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:05,963
In this den of inequity

1123
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:06,997
where only the most desperate

1124
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:09,603
and low life characters assemble?

1125
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,772
- Hiya, Tony.
- Not now, sweetheart.

1126
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,846
Don Carini wants
to see you two clowns.

1127
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:16,215
To clowns!

1128
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,015
Okay!

1129
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,646
Hey, you know what?

1130
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,678
The hell with this.

1131
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:21,712
Hey, Tony!

1132
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:22,746
Tony.

1133
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,020
Wait, wait, wait!

1134
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,828
Tony!

1135
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,464
Hey, Tony, wait up!

1136
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:37,563
Tony!

1137
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,299
Don't shoot!

1138
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,038
Tony.

1139
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:50,248
Hey...gun.

1140
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,713
Younggu, can you slow down
a little, please?

1141
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,589
There's no floorboard!

1142
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,094
Slow down!

1143
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,823
I can't keep up!

1144
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,888
Slow down!

1145
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:09,202
Slow down, Younggu.
I'll shoot ya!

1146
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,498
I swear to God I'll shoot ya!

1147
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,776
First I'm gonna kneecap you.

1148
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,303
Then I'm gonna slit your stinkin' throat.

1149
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,182
I'm gonna rip your heart out
and make a nice carbonara sauce.

1150
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,518
Cut to the chase, Vinnie.

1151
01:05:26,555 --> 01:05:27,681
What do you want?

1152
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:29,782
What do I want?
What we both want.

1153
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,759
Power. Control.

1154
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:34,592
Domination. Respect.

1155
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,257
All right, I want Carini's turf.

1156
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:38,961
I want Bonfante's turf.
I want it all!

1157
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,628
Younggu, get on the box.

1158
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,001
Let's see what's going on.

1159
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:45,371
Do I look like a box?
You're crazy.

1160
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:47,569
Have you no loyalty?

1161
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,942
Loyalty? What do
you know about loyalty?

1162
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:51,537
Hey, I'm loyal to Don Carini.

1163
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,070
Like hell you are!

1164
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:54,582
What do you see, Younggu?

1165
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:58,577
Are you listening?
You think I'm deaf?

1166
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,590
Ever since that little idiotic
son of his came around,

1167
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,457
you ain't the top dog
no more, are you?

1168
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:07,394
Look, if you're gonna kill me, kill me.
Otherwise, shut your pie hole.

1169
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,058
I'm getting tired.
Can we trade positions?

1170
01:06:10,099 --> 01:06:11,430
No.

1171
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:17,299
Tony, I'm not here to kill you.
All right? We need each other.

1172
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,832
I figure we hook up, forget about it,
we'll be running this city.

1173
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,002
What, you and me?

1174
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:24,836
That ain't never gonna happen.

1175
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,245
It already has happened.

1176
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,910
Carini and Bonfante,
they were like blood brothers.

1177
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,317
Look at 'em now.
Sworn enemies.

1178
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:32,821
There's your loyalty.

1179
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:34,220
It ain't never gonna happen,

1180
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:35,382
so kill me, Vinnie, all right?

1181
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:36,413
Just kill me.

1182
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,658
I need a break.

1183
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,660
Rocco, check it out.

1184
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,413
I got it. Get the other one!
Get the other one!

1185
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,710
Younggu, look out!

1186
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,645
I'm save you!

1187
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:10,185
Watch out, will you?

1188
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,127
Gimme that!

1189
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,529
Hold him!

1190
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:24,806
Gimme that!

1191
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:32,839
Gimme this!

1192
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,041
Come on. Let's go.

1193
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,075
Macho.

1194
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,817
Macho. Macho. Macho!

1195
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,518
Oh, don't worry.

1196
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:48,662
Let me at him!

1197
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,995
Come on, you. Come on.

1198
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,523
All right, hold on. Hold on.

1199
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:53,694
One, two, three.

1200
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,870
Your shoes stink!

1201
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,968
Macho, you get in.

1202
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,638
I ain't gettin' in that thing.

1203
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,670
I'll get in.

1204
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,680
Why didn't you tell me
the floorboard's missing?

1205
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,077
The floorboard's missing.

1206
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,004
Thanks, Younggu.
You saved my life back there.

1207
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,337
We save each other's life, Tony.

1208
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:34,035
No.

1209
01:08:34,076 --> 01:08:37,512
I'd be sleeping with the fishes
right now if it wasn't for you.

1210
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:41,209
We don't harm each other.
We are family.

1211
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,514
That's right.
I guess we are.

1212
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:47,078
I guess that makes me
the chauffeur.

1213
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,718
Oh, pardon me. I didn't mean
to interrupt your family reunion.

1214
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:53,653
Vinnie!

1215
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,489
I heard you were looking for me.

1216
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:00,095
I heard somebody tried to grab
Tony V last night.

1217
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:01,761
Where'd you hear that?

1218
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,796
I got a lot of ears out there, Vinnie.

1219
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,740
I didn't order that.

1220
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:07,833
I had my reasons.

1221
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,105
I don't want to hear them.

1222
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:12,672
There is a chain of command
that must be respected.

1223
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,012
I give the orders.

1224
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,641
Of course, Don Bonfante--

1225
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,983
You don't push the button
on anyone without my say-so.

1226
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,249
I didn't push the button.

1227
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:21,381
What?

1228
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:22,981
I let him go.

1229
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:25,186
You let him go?

1230
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:28,196
Look, Don, Tony V doesn't matter
no more, right?

1231
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:33,862
I found out Younggu is gonna betray
his own father, Don Carini.

1232
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,770
Okay. Younggu is gonna
betray Don Carini.

1233
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,602
Now, why would he do that?

1234
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:40,131
I don't know.
He's not right upstairs.

1235
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:42,371
It's like a month-old melon up there.

1236
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,345
Vinnie, he's a good soul.

1237
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,847
A little too good, huh?

1238
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:46,973
What's that mean?

1239
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,087
Don, I swear on my mother's grave,

1240
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:55,920
I would never, ever disrespect you,

1241
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,391
but I think you should know

1242
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,792
that your daughter and Younggu,

1243
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,659
they've been, uh...

1244
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:02,959
how do I say this politely?

1245
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,192
They've been double parking.

1246
01:10:04,233 --> 01:10:05,325
Watch it, Vinnie!

1247
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,527
What are you talking about?

1248
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,196
Look, don't lie, all right?

1249
01:10:08,237 --> 01:10:09,864
I saw it with my own two eyes.

1250
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,804
All right. Enough!

1251
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:14,840
Nancy...

1252
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,645
Are you and this Younggu...

1253
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,615
Daddy, Younggu is an innocent.

1254
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:23,880
He isn't even capable of thinking about
what Vinnie is suggesting.

1255
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,251
I'm telling you,
nothing happened between us.

1256
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,756
Good.

1257
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,224
Now, let me talk to this one.

1258
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:33,319
Fine.

1259
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:39,828
Vinnie, if I ever hear you talking that way

1260
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:41,836
about my Nancy again, I swear...

1261
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,395
Don, Younggu's a wild card.

1262
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:47,102
If you ask me, I think we need
to get rid of him forever.

1263
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,575
I didn't ask you.

1264
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:51,273
He's trouble. I think we need
to cut him up in little pieces

1265
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,247
and feed him
to the neighborhood cats.

1266
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:55,375
I do not want you to touch him.

1267
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,977
You harm Don Carini's only son,

1268
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,250
and there's only one place
for him to go for revenge,

1269
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,484
and that's my Nancy.

1270
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,355
Do you understand, Vinnie?

1271
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,523
Understood.

1272
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,687
Now, get.

1273
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,730
Get the door for me.

1274
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,896
You sure Vincent's making a play
against Don Bonfante?

1275
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,304
He tried to get me
to flip over to his side.

1276
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,934
He said the two of us would
take both of you down.

1277
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:22,807
Like I would ever betray you.

1278
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:25,177
And Younggu saved your life
last night?

1279
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,580
He come storming in
like the Flying Tigers,

1280
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,516
frees me, then he knocks out
those two bums

1281
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:32,213
Iike Sugar Ray Robinson.
Am I right?

1282
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,586
My Younggu?

1283
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,918
That Younggu?

1284
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,951
You had to see it to believe it.

1285
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,158
Hello?

1286
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:21,692
Younggu, it's me, Nancy.

1287
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,001
Nancy?

1288
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,028
I'm Younggu.

1289
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,063
I know.

1290
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:27,700
You know? Me, too.

1291
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,802
Younggu, listen,
I need to see you.

1292
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,039
Anytime.

1293
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:32,846
What time?

1294
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,712
Right now.
Meet me at the park, okay?

1295
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,684
Okay. See you park.

1296
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,965
I don't understand women.

1297
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,707
I don't understand woman.

1298
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:02,059
I don't understand woman.

1299
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,198
I don't understand women.

1300
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:15,875
How much? Free? Okay.

1301
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:18,106
One, two, three,

1302
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:23,948
seven, eight, four,

1303
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:26,648
seven, one...

1304
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,240
- There he is.
- Yeah.

1305
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:58,617
Here, use this.

1306
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,518
Whack him with a pen?

1307
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:05,917
This ain't no pen, all right?

1308
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,953
It's like a syringe, all right?
It's full of pure procaine.

1309
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:10,089
Propane?

1310
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,430
No, you moron. Procaine.

1311
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,196
Look, my cousin is a dentist.

1312
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,636
1 00 ccs of this
will make you numb.

1313
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,163
This is about 50 times
that amount.

1314
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,678
Here's the safety,
here's the switch.

1315
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:25,009
Push it against the flesh.

1316
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,105
Yeah, then what?

1317
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,446
Then he dies, you idiot.

1318
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:30,678
And they can't
trace it back to us.

1319
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,346
Make sure you get all of it
in him, all right?

1320
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,548
If not, it's just gonna
make him loopier,

1321
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,921
and that we don't need.

1322
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:39,359
If this don't work,
next time we use propane.

1323
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:56,334
- Hi.
- Hi.

1324
01:16:58,313 --> 01:16:59,803
Nancy.

1325
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,550
Nice night.

1326
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:11,286
- Nice night.
- Yeah.

1327
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,702
Nancy.

1328
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,540
Bye-bye.

1329
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:31,575
I don't understand woman.

1330
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:34,844
Tanto.

1331
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,044
Tan-ton-ton-ton.

1332
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,422
Macaroni.

1333
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,758
What? What? Nancy?

1334
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:46,151
What, boss?

1335
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:49,493
Nancy. She never
made it home last night.

1336
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:53,661
All right. I want all my men
on the street looking for her!

1337
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,331
Wait, wait. That's crazy.

1338
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,496
Family's off limits.

1339
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,371
You really think the Carinis
would cross the line like that?

1340
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,875
I don't know.

1341
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,275
If they even touch one hair on her head,

1342
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,677
it's gonna be the end of the Carinis.

1343
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,911
Look, no, we should all
sit down and discuss this.

1344
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,577
I got a better idea.
Come on.

1345
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:12,519
What? What, Vinnie? What?

1346
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,114
What, are you kidding me?

1347
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,886
You want me to sit around
and do nothing? What?

1348
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:19,450
Just for now, all right?
They want us to retaliate.

1349
01:18:19,494 --> 01:18:21,121
They're waiting for us to retaliate.

1350
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,131
And we are going to retaliate.

1351
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:27,067
We are gonna hit them
with everything we've got.

1352
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:29,161
Look, no disrespect, Don Bonfante,

1353
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,695
but at the right time, right place.

1354
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,332
On our terms, not theirs.

1355
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,869
I shoulda known you'd be
behind this, Vinnie.

1356
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:41,381
Come here. Why don't you give me
a kiss? Come on.

1357
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:45,518
You're a dead man.

1358
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,680
What do you think's gonna happen

1359
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,122
when my father finds out
you kidnapped me?

1360
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,921
Your father's not gonna be able
to help you, okay?

1361
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,792
When this is all over, I'm gonna be
the main man in New York.

1362
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:57,230
In your dreams.

1363
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,096
What do you know about dreams?

1364
01:18:59,134 --> 01:19:01,432
You know what it's like
to be born from nothing?

1365
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:02,937
You're the don's daughter.

1366
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:05,405
You've gotten everything handed to you.

1367
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,341
Me? I had to make
my own dreams come true.

1368
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,674
I had to work my way through
your father's organization.

1369
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:13,908
And I did, the hard way.

1370
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:19,854
But then Younggu Carini showed up
and ruined everything.

1371
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:25,384
So he left me no choice.
I had to kill him.

1372
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:26,758
You what?

1373
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,355
Yeah. I pushed the button on him,

1374
01:19:29,397 --> 01:19:30,887
and he's dead.

1375
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:34,901
You...You're not a person.

1376
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:37,572
You're a monster.

1377
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,073
You'll never get away with it.

1378
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:43,305
That's the thing, Nancy.
I already have.

1379
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,474
All right? And it's really
quite simple from here.

1380
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,241
Younggu's dead
and Carini will think Bonfante ordered it.

1381
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:55,120
And Bonfante will think
it was Carini seeking revenge.

1382
01:19:55,157 --> 01:19:58,490
And I have to just sit here
on the sidelines and watch.

1383
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,586
And when I'm the new boss,

1384
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:03,894
despite your feistiness
and lack of appreciation,

1385
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:05,729
you will be my bride.

1386
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:07,359
I'd rather die.

1387
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:09,336
Aw, you say that now.

1388
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:11,532
But, you know,
when this thing's over,

1389
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,507
we're gonna have
a really good time.

1390
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:14,975
Vinnie.

1391
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:20,141
- Rocco's acting a little strange.
- What?

1392
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:27,551
I am the Lone Ranger!

1393
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:29,849
Whoa, Silver.

1394
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,722
I save the princess
and rescue the town

1395
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,421
from the evils of the world.

1396
01:20:33,461 --> 01:20:34,155
Rocco.

1397
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:36,563
Rocco, snap out of it.

1398
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:38,289
Look, do you know who I am?

1399
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,034
Tonto!

1400
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,537
He's whacked out of his mind.

1401
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,370
There's no way he took care
of that thing last night.

1402
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:47,966
Silver's thirsty.

1403
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:54,308
Ah, drink. Drink, girl. Good horse.

1404
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,977
Of course I took care of that thing.

1405
01:20:57,018 --> 01:20:59,418
I always get my man.

1406
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:00,546
That's good, Rocco.

1407
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:01,920
Where did you put Younggu's body?

1408
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:05,188
Younggu?
Is he the bad man?

1409
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,526
Then I must stop him.

1410
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,291
Hi ho Silver!

1411
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,624
Away!

1412
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:12,826
Take it easy!

1413
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,836
Rocco! Rocco!

1414
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,532
Get him over here.
Snap out of it.

1415
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:21,732
No!

1416
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:25,268
"Be at the market by noon tomorrow

1417
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:28,714
if you wanna see Nancy again"!

1418
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,513
They're using Nancy as bait?

1419
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,917
Those spineless bastards.

1420
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,251
I never thought that Carini
would stoop so low

1421
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:35,881
as to take a child.

1422
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:39,917
Well, we're gonna be at the market,
armed to the teeth!

1423
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:43,988
Get me the crew from Hoboken.
Get me the crew from Hartford.

1424
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,523
This is all-out war!

1425
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:59,012
You tell Don Carini
if he doesn't bring back Nancy,

1426
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,412
there's gonna be hell to pay!

1427
01:22:00,448 --> 01:22:02,575
Nancy? Who's Nancy?

1428
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,784
We don't know this Nancy person.

1429
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:08,049
Please stop!

1430
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:13,392
Listen, we want her back
safely by tomorrow,

1431
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,988
or we're gonna destroy
this whole market!

1432
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,063
I'll be back by noon tomorrow!

1433
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,102
What's going on?

1434
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:33,546
Don Bon-retard somehow
is under the impression

1435
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:36,379
that I have ordered
the kidnapping of his daughter.

1436
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:38,852
If we don't return Nancy to him
by noon tomorrow,

1437
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,878
he's threatening an open attack.

1438
01:22:40,922 --> 01:22:42,549
We didn't kidnap nobody.

1439
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:45,923
Still, we have to protect our turf.

1440
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,019
Get the word out.

1441
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:48,893
Noon tomorrow at the market.

1442
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,764
I want everybody armed
and ready for all-out war.

1443
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:55,766
Don't.

1444
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,271
You don't have to do this.

1445
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,670
Come on, calm down.

1446
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,768
You're a nice girl, Nancy,
but I got orders.

1447
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,279
You follow orders, you get promoted,

1448
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:07,406
you move up the chain of command.

1449
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:09,979
No hard feelings?

1450
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:14,614
Please, just let me leave.
You can come work for my father.

1451
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,988
He'll treat you a whole lot better
than Vinnie ever will.

1452
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:19,755
I don't think you get it.

1453
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,728
Vinnie is my brother.

1454
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,101
Rustling cattle is a hangin' offense.

1455
01:23:37,245 --> 01:23:39,713
Good afternoon, ma'am.

1456
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,182
Great job on the car.
It looks great.

1457
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:43,845
Thank you.

1458
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,819
Why are the streets so quiet?

1459
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,017
Should we go check it out?

1460
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,287
Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that.

1461
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:56,991
I mean, look,
the newsstand is closed.

1462
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:58,797
The restaurant.

1463
01:24:01,803 --> 01:24:04,772
That thing,
that thing's closed down.

1464
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,273
The shoe guy ain't there.

1465
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,738
What the--
Give me that!

1466
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:46,110
Take this!

1467
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:53,149
You look old, Gino.

1468
01:24:55,023 --> 01:24:56,047
You, too.

1469
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:58,585
Where's my daughter?

1470
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:01,094
I didn't kidnap your daughter.

1471
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,122
I would never break the code.

1472
01:25:04,165 --> 01:25:05,393
You're a liar!

1473
01:25:05,433 --> 01:25:07,833
My father no liar.

1474
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,094
You say sorry.

1475
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,436
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

1476
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,010
You're all under arrest!

1477
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,005
Put your guns down
and your hands in the air!

1478
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:25,582
Yikes!
You handle this.

1479
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,281
I'm out of here!

1480
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:31,481
Where were we?

1481
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,824
I didn't order the kidnapping
of your daughter.

1482
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,727
So why am I supposed
to believe that?

1483
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,025
I give you my word.

1484
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:39,727
And I will give you all of my men
to help find her.

1485
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:41,359
Dante, we go back a long way.

1486
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,926
We fought many battles,

1487
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,963
but there is one thing you and I both
have never done,

1488
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,475
and that's break the code.

1489
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:49,943
Family is off limits.

1490
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,309
Think about it.

1491
01:25:51,346 --> 01:25:53,746
Why would I do that
now that I have my son?

1492
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:29,677
Tony, I'm hit!

1493
01:26:30,985 --> 01:26:32,213
Help Macho!

1494
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:33,686
You gotta stop the bleeding!

1495
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:34,983
Tie it around his leg!

1496
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:39,718
No! No!

1497
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:43,258
I'm a dead man!

1498
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:48,961
Tony! Tony! Tony!

1499
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:50,300
What are you doing, Macho?

1500
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,532
I'm a little busy here!

1501
01:26:51,573 --> 01:26:53,803
I'm dying and he's killin' me!

1502
01:26:56,344 --> 01:26:57,936
Younggu, his heart is up here.

1503
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:00,447
You gotta tie that
on the top of his thigh

1504
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:01,607
to stop the bleeding.

1505
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:03,139
Tie it as close
to his chest as possible.

1506
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,208
Okay, okay, okay!

1507
01:27:04,252 --> 01:27:05,276
Soon, soon, soon!

1508
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:11,647
Tony!

1509
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:15,026
- Tony!
- Don't worry.

1510
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:20,832
What are you doing?

1511
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,237
You're choking me!

1512
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,536
Heart here, head here,

1513
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:29,202
tie neck, stop bleeding.

1514
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:30,506
Cut it out!

1515
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,179
Go around that way!

1516
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:38,207
Okay.

1517
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,242
Cover your father!

1518
01:27:39,287 --> 01:27:40,720
Okay.

1519
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,732
Come on.
Let's get him inside!

1520
01:28:14,088 --> 01:28:16,613
Son! Son!

1521
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:19,318
It's all my fault.

1522
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,191
I never should have
brought you here!

1523
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,230
I'm gonna join you soon.

1524
01:28:26,267 --> 01:28:28,201
So go now to your mother,

1525
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:30,602
and get all the love
you missed out on.

1526
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:35,572
I love you, son.

1527
01:28:49,757 --> 01:28:51,782
Amazing.

1528
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:54,819
Your mother.

1529
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,295
She just saved your...

1530
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:59,164
your life.

1531
01:29:26,427 --> 01:29:28,725
I can't let my men
go down this way.

1532
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:30,253
Vinnie. Vinnie.

1533
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:31,595
Enough!

1534
01:29:31,632 --> 01:29:32,792
Stop shooting!

1535
01:29:41,676 --> 01:29:42,938
I got a clean shot.

1536
01:29:42,977 --> 01:29:43,966
No.

1537
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,036
There's got to be another way.

1538
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:54,578
No, wait.
Everybody stop! Daddy, wait!

1539
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:55,611
Nancy!

1540
01:29:55,656 --> 01:29:59,217
Carini didn't kidnap me!
Vinnie did!

1541
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:00,955
Put your guns down or I'll kill her!

1542
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:02,963
Vinnie, it was you did this?

1543
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:04,589
No, you made me do this.

1544
01:30:04,632 --> 01:30:05,758
I should be in charge,

1545
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,859
but instead
you treat me like a dog!

1546
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,200
And you.
I'm not good enough for you, huh?

1547
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:11,466
- Let go of me.
- Shut up!

1548
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:13,440
Vinnie, please, put the gun down.

1549
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:15,339
I will give you whatever you want.

1550
01:30:15,376 --> 01:30:19,107
In this life you don't give.
In this life you take, remember?

1551
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:21,138
Look, if you follow me, I'll kill her!

1552
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:23,616
Let her go!

1553
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,812
Younggu, will you shoot me?
Come on.

1554
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:29,050
Let her go, please.
Vincent, she's all I got.

1555
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,423
All right. On one condition.

1556
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,887
Younggu, you love her, right?
You'll do anything for her?

1557
01:30:37,131 --> 01:30:38,291
Yeah.

1558
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:39,856
Well, why don't we solve this
once and for all?

1559
01:30:39,901 --> 01:30:41,493
Just you and me.

1560
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,367
No! Stop!

1561
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:47,898
If he kill me, let him go.

1562
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,432
Younggu--

1563
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:52,674
Father, I'm saving Nancy, okay?

1564
01:30:56,517 --> 01:30:57,279
Okay.

1565
01:30:57,685 --> 01:30:58,447
Okay?

1566
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:00,110
Okay.

1567
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,453
You want me...

1568
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:06,392
you got me.

1569
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,119
With pleasure.

1570
01:31:09,163 --> 01:31:11,188
Come on.

1571
01:31:23,911 --> 01:31:26,880
All right, now we shoot
on the count of five.

1572
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:30,583
Shoot when he says five.

1573
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:31,915
Okay.

1574
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:34,217
You got that?
So on the count of five,

1575
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:35,244
we shoot.

1576
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,819
What are you doing?

1577
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,225
You say five.

1578
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:42,491
No. I said we count to five--

1579
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,965
You shot me!

1580
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:48,828
You say five!

1581
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:50,838
No, I said count to five--

1582
01:31:56,277 --> 01:31:58,507
You're so stupid.

1583
01:31:59,614 --> 01:32:01,309
You so dead.

1584
01:32:02,149 --> 01:32:03,138
Get him!

1585
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:08,984
So stupid!

1586
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:11,514
The apple does not fall
far from the tree.

1587
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:16,019
Oh, Nancy, I think I lost you.

1588
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:17,325
I was so scared for you, Younggu.

1589
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,162
Me, too. Very scary.

1590
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,361
- Nancy!
- Daddy!

1591
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:23,666
- My son!
- Father.

1592
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:26,867
Vinnie wanted to make it look like
the Carinis were behind this.

1593
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:28,239
He was gonna kill you.

1594
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:31,973
So Vinnie was behind it all along.

1595
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:34,779
Okay, Gino, my apologies.

1596
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:37,009
Accepted.

1597
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,345
Younggu, thank you.

1598
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:41,981
Yeah.
We together working.

1599
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:43,991
Carini shoot.
Bonfante shoot.

1600
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,287
No, no.

1601
01:32:45,326 --> 01:32:48,352
Two string weak.
One rope more strong.

1602
01:32:48,396 --> 01:32:49,863
What did he say?

1603
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:54,095
Younggu's saying if you two would only
put aside your petty differences

1604
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:57,070
and pooled your resources,
stop fighting all the time,

1605
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:58,537
and actually work together,

1606
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,302
you'd be unstoppable.

1607
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,138
He said all that?

1608
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:04,201
Yeah. The one rope strong,

1609
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,713
many make money.

1610
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,875
You know, the kid,
he has a point.

1611
01:33:09,917 --> 01:33:12,579
I mean, if we worked together
like the old days?

1612
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:13,882
Forget about it.

1613
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,252
Forget about it!

1614
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:25,029
Nancy. Nancy, you got away
from Vinnie all by yourself?

1615
01:33:25,066 --> 01:33:26,431
Well, I had a little help.

1616
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:27,900
Hey, it's one of Vinnie's goons!

1617
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,698
No, no. He saved me from Vinnie!

1618
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:32,934
Hi ho, Silver! Away!

1619
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,875
You handle the waterfront.
I'll take bookmaking.

1620
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:48,980
You can handle garbage.
I'll take cement.

1621
01:33:49,023 --> 01:33:50,615
Garment center?

1622
01:33:50,658 --> 01:33:52,455
Be my guest. Judges?

1623
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:54,688
All yours.

1624
01:33:54,729 --> 01:33:57,596
This is just like in the old days.

1625
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,363
And we are gonna be invincible
just like in the old days.

1626
01:34:01,402 --> 01:34:02,596
Yeah.

1627
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:04,537
Think about how big our business
would have been.

1628
01:34:04,572 --> 01:34:05,869
It's not too late.

1629
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:07,669
Now it's up to our kids.

1630
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:10,074
My son and your daughter.

1631
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,239
It makes me happy
just thinking about it.

1632
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:16,909
So you transferred everything
over to Younggu yet?

1633
01:34:16,951 --> 01:34:18,782
It's all taken care of.
How about you?

1634
01:34:18,819 --> 01:34:20,946
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1635
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:25,357
Gino, Younggu has proven
with his courage and his dedication

1636
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:28,419
that he is ready to be
capo de tutti capo.

1637
01:34:28,462 --> 01:34:30,020
The next don.

1638
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:31,190
Yeah.

1639
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,471
Where is Younggu?

1640
01:34:42,376 --> 01:34:44,674
Wow.

1641
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:46,969
For children.

1642
01:34:50,418 --> 01:34:52,682
Bless you, Younggu.

1643
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:54,051
Bless you.

1644
01:34:56,123 --> 01:34:57,385
Don Bonfante.

1645
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:01,756
Sister Theresa from the orphanage
wanted me to give this to you.

1646
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,464
What does it say?

1647
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:14,334
"Dear Father, this is Younggu.

1648
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:17,970
"By the time you read this, I will be...

1649
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:19,206
far away."

1650
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:23,442
"l am not made for mafia."

1651
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:24,883
What?

1652
01:35:24,919 --> 01:35:27,820
I just signed over all my assets to him.

1653
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:28,879
I did, too.

1654
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:31,585
He has got all of our money!

1655
01:35:32,059 --> 01:35:32,923
Where is he?

1656
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,949
I'm gonna kill him!

1657
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:35,518
I'll kill him!

1658
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,190
Get off me! Get off me!

1659
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:38,255
It's okay.

1660
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:39,459
Bye-bye.

1661
01:35:44,638 --> 01:35:46,697
I'm so proud of you, Younggu.

1662
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,971
Nancy, you happy now,

1663
01:35:49,009 --> 01:35:53,241
but when my father finds out,
I'm...
