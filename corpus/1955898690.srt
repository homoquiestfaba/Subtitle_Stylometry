1
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,292
Get down.

2
00:26:21,042 --> 00:26:22,962
Get down!

3
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:45,877
Now...

4
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,578
Take it.

5
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,667
I do not fear death.

6
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:37,918
Don't you take another step!

7
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,747
What do you want?

8
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:49,205
I am Black Hawk.

9
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:54,747
Son of Chief Yellow Hawk.

10
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,420
I know who you are.

11
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,377
What do you want?

12
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:04,212
My wife...

13
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,250
...Elk Woman.

14
00:41:06,958 --> 00:41:09,078
Our son, Little Bear.

15
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:10,625
And my sister, Living Woman.

16
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:17,788
A gift... for the lady.

17
00:41:19,417 --> 00:41:21,917
I would...

18
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:24,208
be honored...

19
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,753
...if she would wear these.

20
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,287
And Captain, I--

21
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:57,955
Enough!

22
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,375
Sit down.

23
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:32,665
Experiencing loss such as she has...

24
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:38,787
...requires great strength.

25
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,670
The Comanche are still near.

26
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:48,918
They are Rattlesnake people. The worst kind.

27
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:53,422
I know who they are.

28
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:56,578
They do not discriminate.

29
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:01,463
They will track and attack your party. Ours, too.

30
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:05,167
We are ready for them.

31
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:07,915
You don't understand
how grave the situation.

32
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,748
They are of unsound mind.

33
00:46:09,792 --> 00:46:12,382
And very dangerous.

34
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:16,328
Remove the binds.

35
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:19,205
We can be of great help.

36
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,750
I'm not removing them.

37
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,583
You are making this
more difficult than necessary.

38
00:51:57,625 --> 00:51:58,705
Captain?

39
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,250
What?

40
00:52:01,167 --> 00:52:04,037
The Chief is still uneasy.

41
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,670
He says Comanche will soon return.

42
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,330
He thinks we should...

43
00:52:13,208 --> 00:52:14,328
talk to them.

44
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:18,422
You and us.

45
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,582
I disagree.

46
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:22,495
But Captain--

47
00:52:22,542 --> 00:52:23,882
Hold your tongue.

48
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,212
I've given you my opinion.

49
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,420
I told you.

50
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,130
We must stand as one or they will kill us.

51
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,415
When one hunts for a rattlesnake...

52
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,328
...one may find it.

53
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,748
But it bites...

54
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:44,042
before one can ever see it.

55
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,040
Thank you.

56
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:47,377
I am Elk Woman.

57
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,125
Father!

58
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,127
Grandfather!

59
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:28,995
Tell me.

60
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:31,962
They've taken Mother!

61
01:20:58,833 --> 01:21:00,543
Horses with iron feet.

62
01:21:23,875 --> 01:21:26,245
Fur hunters. Three of them.

63
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:01,543
When whitemen return to their shelter...

64
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:04,252
we advance.

65
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,745
As one.

66
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,040
You are not well.

67
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:13,328
We will handle them.

68
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,883
My daughter. I lead.

69
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,630
We discuss no further.

70
01:29:19,875 --> 01:29:21,075
Chief...

71
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,880
I'm sorry for what happened to the women.

72
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:38,503
Is there anything I can do to help?

73
01:29:46,250 --> 01:29:50,040
The rains are approaching. We should move.

74
01:33:11,042 --> 01:33:12,542
Chief...

75
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:22,253
Chief...

76
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:33,330
Our treatment of the Natives
cannot be forgiven.

77
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:35,422
Please...

78
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:37,825
accept this tobacco.

79
01:33:46,875 --> 01:33:49,785
Have mercy on us.

80
01:38:05,292 --> 01:38:06,582
For you, Grandpapa.

81
01:38:06,833 --> 01:38:09,133
To make you feel better.

82
01:38:13,042 --> 01:38:15,132
Thank you for this gift.

83
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,130
It will give me life.

84
01:47:56,917 --> 01:47:58,417
Are you well enough to continue?

85
01:47:58,917 --> 01:48:00,167
Very soon.

86
01:48:01,167 --> 01:48:07,827
After my body is nourished by the earth.

87
01:48:10,167 --> 01:48:13,077
We're very close to your home.

88
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:17,128
You speak the truth.

89
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:27,080
Chief...

90
01:48:32,375 --> 01:48:34,955
I had a friend...

91
01:48:42,583 --> 01:48:45,253
I had a friend...

92
01:48:54,458 --> 01:48:56,878
I had a friend...

93
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:10,830
I lost many friends
and you have lost many as well.

94
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:17,627
They are a great loss for us both...

95
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:23,920
but we know death comes to us all.

96
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:50,500
Don't look back, my friend.

97
01:49:51,875 --> 01:49:53,955
Go in a good way.

98
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,250
A part of me dies with you.

99
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Valley of the Bears, Montana

100
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:09,883
We're home.

101
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:16,207
It's never looked more beautiful.

102
02:03:04,292 --> 02:03:06,582
Little Bear, a gift.

103
02:03:07,917 --> 02:03:11,417
It's now your time to put this to use.

104
02:03:13,542 --> 02:03:15,132
Caesar...

105
02:03:16,208 --> 02:03:19,038
one of the bravest men I've ever read.

106
02:03:25,458 --> 02:03:26,708
Thank you.
