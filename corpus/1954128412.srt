00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:26,703

00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:30,664
Besides. who knows?
I might get lucky.

They never do. I doubt if they'll even try.

84
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,049
At least you got your purse back.

85

00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:22,548
Morbid sensation, not unpleasant.
someone there, I call out his name, "Billy!"

115
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:25,283
And who is Billy, Angie?

116
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:31,718
There is no Billy.

00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,557

You'll be fine. you can sit up.
There's nothing we didn't know before.

120
00:13:52,185 --> 00:13:56,436
We're not getting anywhere with this.
I'm leaving.

121
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,964
All right. Let's talk about repression.

122
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,736
Cliche.

123
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:02,491
Purpose of repression is the 
avoidance of pain.

124
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,110
This is accomplished by withdraw 
form objectionable ideas.

125
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:10,498
These ideas aren't dead or nonexistent,
but merely out of sight for the time being.

126
00:14:10,748 --> 00:14:13,185
Why you don't tell me something
that isn't a cliche?

127
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:19,180
Right, right, all cliche. but the fact remains
something happened to you in your childhood

128
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:23,425
That your mind finds intolerable and 
has been denied conscious remembramce.

129
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:29,103
Look, I don't know what this has to do with me now.
I am 36 years old. 

130
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:34,557
All my friends are married and have children.
I've never even been...

131
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:35,227
Laid.

132
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,470
Come on. Say the word. 
You won't be punished.

133
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:42,106
Ah Yeah sure, say the word.
It just opens some magic door to love.

134
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:51,401
My first sexual experience was with some guy
who followed me into an elevator, threw me 
on the ground, and said "spread them."
That what I ....

135
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,737
Is that what sex is going to be for me?

136
00:14:53,988 --> 00:11:55,241
No, of course not, Angie.

137
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:58,409
You know the difference between 
sex and sexual violation.

138
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,871
Let's examine the positive side
of what happened.

139
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:07,874
In the face of real danger, you managed to 
control the situation. Defended yorself. it's
a very important insight.

140
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,835
I want never to see that... bearded man again.

141
00:15:14,002 --> 00:15:17,005
Your fears are perfectly normal, Angie.

142
00:15:19,338 --> 00:15:20,090
That's funny.

143
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,051
What?

144
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,971
I'm perfectly normal.

145
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,864
What's the chance of your getting
an assignment today?

146
00:15:36,915 --> 00:15:38,442
Oh, I don't want to work.

147
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,644
Keeping yourself busy is the best therapy.

148
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:43,689
I really think you should go to the agency.

149
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,941
See you next time.

150
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:55,235
Hi, Sweetheart.

151
00:15:56,612 --> 00:16:01,823
I left my briefcase with my speech in it.
I'w due at the station in 15 minutes.

152
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,006
Hey, listen.
I've got an idea.

153
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:14,331
Why not stay home and play with me instaed?
Forget about politics for a day.

154
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:19,041
Really? Stephan, 
You in the middle of the day?

155

 is a job coming up tomorrow..
If it happens, I'll call you.

164

00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,949

We've run out of ice.

168
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:08,235

Still... shaky, I guess.
Still looking over my shoulder.

Miss Anderson, you're very hot tonight.

188
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,885
Angie Anderson, Nancy Leahy.

189
00:20:44,094 --> 00:20:46,638
I heard about what happened to you.
It must have been awful.

190
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,559
You really can't trust this city or its people.
If it weren't for my business, I'd never come into it.

191
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,937
Nancy's an interior decorator.
A creator.

192
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:59,986
She just bought one of my paintings.
for a penthouse she's working on.

193
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:04,066
Alex, Darling would you make a favor for me?
walk me to the elevator? 

193
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,066
Good-bye, Miss Anderson. 
be sure to take care of yourself.

194
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:20,544
They used to be make quite a pair.

195
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,374
Almost seemed like it might go the distane,
till Alex cooled in her.

196
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:29,835
Left her holding a big tourch.
Poor little nancy.

197
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:31,712
You paint?

198
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:37,173
Yes, I do.
Come on. I'll show you.

199
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,966
Something Wrong?

200
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:14,260
No, They're Beautiful.

201
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,565
The Girls come and pose fore me
several time a week.

202
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:24,871
They're Good.
Is this the one you're working on now?

203
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:28,536
Can I uncover it?

204
00:22:28,586 --> 00:22:30,913
That's the one I want you to see.

205
00:22:40,288 --> 00:22:42,123
How did you do that?

206
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:45,043
Part imagination, part espinage,

207
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:48,572
And the fact that you're very
Careless with your blinds.

208
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:49,800
Why?

209
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,093
Because you fascinate me.

210
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:54,263
I'm going.

211
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:57,890
Don't!  you can't hate the painting.
It's you, isn't it?

212
00:22:58,224 --> 00:23:02,852
Angela, I know more about you than your 
therapist or Alex will never know. Stop!

213
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:06,855
What do you want from me?

214
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,192
You.

215
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,395
You don't even know me.

216
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:17,381
I've known you for months,
I've watched you. I know you intimately.

217
00:23:17,857 --> 00:23:23,867
Don't let this porsche I'm in fool you.
I'm still a man. ask them.

218
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,118
You're a virgin, aren't you?

219
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,913
Angela! Angela, come back! come back.

220
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:05,873
Oh, My God, Alex! It's him! 
Alex! Alex! Alex!

221
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:10,932
It's him. it's the man from the elevator.
That man with the red beard.

222
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:14,929
Take it easy.
Just take it easy. frank, come here.

223
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,594
Angie, this is frank brady.
He's an actor on the soap.

224
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:21,407
Hi, pleased to meet you.

225
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:23,811
Oh, My God!

226
00:24:28,606 --> 00:24:29,109
It's all right.

227
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:39,403
Come in. please.
Please?

228
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:43,571
I'm sorry I embarrassed you.

229
00:24:44,697 --> 00:24:46,740
You didn't.
Don't worry about it.

230
00:24:49,324 --> 00:24:52,568
I want to talk to you about your brother.
He's driving me crazy.

231
00:24:53,518 --> 00:24:56,579
Yeah. He's good at that.

232
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:01,815
How long has he been in the chair?

233
00:25:01,923 --> 00:25:03,168
About a year.

234
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:09,853
We were driving back from the gape.
I was driving. there was an accident. that what I can say.

235
00:25:10,103 --> 00:25:12,340
I've had in all kinds of specialists.
and did the best I can.

236
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:14,675
It's amazing.

237
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:17,969
what?

238
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,014
You're identical, but you're so different.

239
00:25:22,222 --> 00:25:30,682
Yeah. We've always been different.
Cole was always the smart one...the genius with no ambition,

240
00:25:31,057 --> 00:25:35,727
Never wanting to settle down till the accident made him.

241
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:39,895
Don't blame yourself. it's not your fault.

242
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:46,480
Can I ask you a question?

243
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,609
- Would you dinner with me tommorow?
- No

244
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:55,411
- Lunch?
- No

245
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,280
- Breakfast?
- No

246
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:58,741
- A hotdog in a park?
- No

247
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:09,159
- Why do you want to be with me?
- Because I like you. Because I've seen your dolls.

248
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:13,820
And you take broken things, and you make them beautiful.

249
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,207
Please. I can't stand to be touched.
I can't make love with a man.

250
00:26:32,415 --> 00:26:35,876
You are not a lesbian? 
Why you make him think you are a whore?

251
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:39,969
It was an easy out at the moment.
Anyway, It got rid of him.

252
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:42,422
And that's what you really wanted?

253
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:48,691
I don't know. He's really nice, 
He's fun, He's handsome.

253
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:54,091
For some reason, he keeps 
coming on to me. but I stop it.

254
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,220
I want him to touch me, but I stop it.

255
00:27:00,428 --> 00:27:06,389
So you see, Angie, Repressed thought it 
maybe you possess a sexual instict.

256
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:09,642
Do you possess a sexual instict?

257
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,977
Certainly. of course I do. 

258
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,063
How do you know?

259
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:20,106
How can I help knowing it?
If I see a pretty girl, I want to kiss her.

260
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:27,034
I findle her, I desire intercourse. 
If I don't have it at regular intervals, 

261
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,896
I'll find myself thinking sexual thoughts
and craving sexual satisfaction.

262
00:27:32,446 --> 00:27:35,239
And you, Angie, are no different than me.

263
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,242
Save for a few mental barriers, we're the same.

264
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,886
I'd like you to touch me.

265
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,747
That's because you know nothing will happen.
You trust that, therefore you trust me.

266
00:27:46,955 --> 00:27:49,459
I think I'm attracted to you, and that frightens me.

267
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:54,262
- Why?
- Because you're married.

268
00:27:54,312 --> 00:27:59,581
Who frightened you the most, Angie? 
Me or my wife? Or is it Alex Morgan...

269
00:27:59,615 --> 00:28:01,801
- I told you that.
- ...or his crippled brother?

270
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:03,428
He scares the hell out of me.

271
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:06,904
- Or ass-pinching Mr. Kramer? Or is it Billy?
- There is no Billy.

273
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,238
But You told me there was! so I payback the tapes?

274
00:28:10,456 --> 00:28:16,984
Come on Angie! You talk about this billy
but not what or who he is... she is!

275
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,302
- Is Billy a woman, Angie?
- No

276
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,447
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I know.

277
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:27,783
Because Why? Comon on Angie, do the work! 
Why?  Why?

278
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:31,121
Because woman don't have red beards !

279
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:41,208
I thought I told you... all right put her on.

280
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:52,711
Ann, Dear , I'm with a patient.
Three days? of course I'll miss you.

281
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:03,213
That's the price I pay for being marrid to a politician.
Yes. I'll be sure to watch you on television.

282
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,107
I'll tape it, I promise.

283
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,885
Sorry Angie.

284
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:22,345
Do you really are happy, aren't you?

285
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,472
Reasonably.

286
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,475
You don't have any children, do you?

287
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:33,021
You see, it's never perfect, Angie.
Never.

288
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:34,315
How about us doing it here, bitch?
We can do it right here. what you say?

289
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:09,650
- What'll it be, Miss? what  can I get you, lady?
- Water?

290
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:21,028
Anything else? 
Anything else?

291
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:33,041
Was dark in the movie house Angie.
How could you be sure that it was the same man?

292
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:37,126
- Because I felt the scissors at my face.
- Why didn't you call a policeman?

293
00:31:37,293 --> 00:31:43,837
All I could think to do was to run.
I left, I ran out, and I called you.

294
00:31:44,006 --> 00:31:48,091
I wasn't there. If you really certain that the man
return back, you should have called a policeman.

295
00:31:48,258 --> 00:31:50,093
It would have been logical to do.

296
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,141
I thought you don't believe me.

297
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:59,191
I do believe you.
But also believe that are many red-bearded 
men living in the city and.....

298
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,360
Some go to the movies and try 
making out with pretty girls.

299
00:32:19,486 --> 00:32:24,198
Why you've hanging up Angie? 
I'm trying to help you. do you understand me?

300
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:29,076
Your experience in the elevator was traumatic.
I Don't underestimate the shock of that encounter.

301
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:32,912
But it can't become an obsession.

302
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:37,415
I want you think about it is possible 
that your own panic is attracting these encounters.

303
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,211
I don't understand.

304
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,921
We'll talk about it.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

305
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:45,714
Angie, all right?

306
00:32:58,382 --> 00:33:00,592
Hi, Sweetie.

307
00:35:52,801 --> 00:36:02,136
He's kissing her... Long sensuous kisses
while he fondles her tits.

308
00:36:04,513 --> 00:36:09,390
If this develops into something.
You just might end up on the street.

309
00:36:09,522 --> 00:36:12,191
Don't worry. that's not going to happen.

310
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:23,325
What if Alex was to walk in that door
and see you standing?

311
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:32,965
I'd get down on my knees, and I'd cry "It's a miracle!
It's a goddamn miracle !"

312
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,261
What's the matter?

313
00:36:56,935 --> 00:37:01,270
I can't do this. I'm no good at this.

314
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:05,106
It was me. I was just too eager.
I'm sorry.

315
00:37:16,315 --> 00:37:17,358
I'm sorry.

316
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,404
Can we have that dinner tomorrow night?

317
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:57,616
Angela. Angela. I'm coming over.
I'm coming to see you.

318
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:15,201
911 emergency. How can I help you?

319
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,665
Here I come, Angela. We got to talk.

320
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:33,419
Cole, don't. don't be stupid.

321
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:36,463
Leaving the blinds open was stupid.

322
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:38,798
Please Cole. Come down.

323
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:22,468
Angie, this is Bob. You got a job for tomorrow.
Write this down:

324
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:28,640
"Richard Bailey. 434 West 23rd Street."
It's 2:00 O'clock.

325
00:40:28,848 --> 00:40:30,977
2:00 O'clock. 
OK, Thank you.

326
00:40:55,186 --> 00:41:00,105
That was a close call, huh? we got a job!

327
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:43,900
Hello?  Anybody here?

328
00:44:31,068 --> 00:44:34,111
It's a sort of Fun being bigger than the city,
Isn't it?

329
00:44:34,362 --> 00:44:37,864
People say that it's an ugly city,
But it's not.

330
00:44:38,073 --> 00:44:41,659
It's provocative and challenging.

331
00:44:42,285 --> 00:44:45,287
Those flagged buildings scattee thrushcut
the area... 

332
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:49,123
They're my buildings, and hopefully one day,
the whole city will look like that.

333
00:44:50,707 --> 00:44:55,836
By buildings are conceived to filter cut dirt.
and sound from the outside.

334
00:44:56,044 --> 00:45:00,754
You never get fading rays of the sun 
will never ruin your furnature.

335
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:06,422
Our polarized windows that can turn night into day
are designed so that the rooms never heat up.

336
00:45:06,589 --> 00:45:12,384
But maintain a Liveable temperature and protect
you from the eyes of curious neighbors.

337
00:45:13,551 --> 00:45:15,511
And if day is bleak outside, 

338
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:20,596
Your mood is automatically buoyl by
our lighting sensors... Watch.

339
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:28,224
Or if it's a mello, contemplative mood you desire,
Watch again.

340
00:45:31,724 --> 00:45:36,851
And what's even more beautiful...
Just listen a moment. 

341
00:45:37,059 --> 00:45:46,185
Silence. Yes blessed silence, whale outside,
the city surges and pulsates with shattering sound.

342
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:48,688
The Sanity and the health of this city

343
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,648
Depends on the evolition of 
just this kind of building.

344
00:45:53,815 --> 00:46:02,858
Yes, You are now standing in a Richard Baily Apartment,
Designed to save our city and you.

345
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:54,694
- You seen Angie?
- No, why?

346
00:56:55,861 --> 00:57:00,113
After spending half your time playing peeping tom,
I thouth you may could give me a report on her.

347
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,490
You want know about her,
Go knock on her door.

348
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:11,909
I did. All I hear is the cat. Cat's been yelling all day.
Angie doesn't answer.

349
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:41,553
What do you want from me?
maybe she left town.

350
00:57:41,746 --> 00:57:42,959
She would bever left the cat.

351
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,713
How do you know what a psychologically
disturbed person would do?

352
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:51,506
Beside we had a dinner date.

353
00:57:53,673 --> 00:57:56,633
Oh! of course. I'm sorry. who stands up a star?

354
00:59:56,042 --> 01:00:08,051
I'm thirsty. I want bobbie.
I sleepy. I want sleep in bed.

354
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:13,051
- My name is Betty. what's your name?
- Angie.

354
01:00:14,842 --> 01:00:16,051
Angie. that's a pretty name.

354
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:38,051
- Look for the bird.
- What bird?

354
01:01:30,842 --> 01:01:32,051
Where is the bird?

355
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:43,430
Yes, of course it is. of course it's here.
Of course it's in the bedroom.

356
01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:08,849
You killed him!
You killed him!

357
01:04:40,057 --> 01:04:45,019
Voila. The mystery's solved.
She left town for a few days.

358
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:51,231
This doesn't make any sense.
Why would she send me a telegram?

359
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:56,194
Why she didn't pickup the phone and call me?
She doesn't say anything about feed it.

360
01:04:57,444 --> 01:04:59,864
I'm sure she laid out plenty of food.

361
01:05:00,156 --> 01:05:02,034
Then why is it crying?

362
01:05:02,242 --> 01:05:06,785
All things cry and make a fuss
when they're lonely.

363
01:05:06,994 --> 01:05:08,290
Didn't you know that?

364
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,210
Angie, You in there?

365
01:05:58,627 --> 01:06:00,588
Now we'll go home.

366
01:06:08,796 --> 01:06:10,675
Something's going on up there.

367
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:15,304
Mind your own business.
Mind your own business. Come on.

368
01:09:42,554 --> 01:09:45,348
She had the lock changed.
I didn't get a key from her.

369
01:09:45,857 --> 01:09:47,518
Then break the door down.

370
01:09:47,768 --> 01:09:50,269
Your brother said she sent a telegram.

371
01:09:50,548 --> 01:09:52,316
I don't care. She wouldn't leave her cat like that.

372
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:58,362
I can't break the door. it's against the law.
Sorry, I only work here.

373
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:16,266
You're really making a big thing out of this.

374
01:10:18,393 --> 01:10:23,770
The card I left for Angie, it's gone.
It was under her door. someone took it.

375
01:10:23,862 --> 01:10:25,065
Well, maybe the cat took it.

376
01:10:25,274 --> 01:10:27,151
I think you took it.

377
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:31,530
Alex, This is your TV sense of reality talking.

378
01:10:33,364 --> 01:10:41,075
Wait a second, Cole! What happening to us?
Where's all this anger coming from?

379
01:10:41,242 --> 01:10:43,243
Are we enemies? Do you hate me?

380
01:10:44,493 --> 01:10:47,747
I suppose you're going to tell me you love me.

381
01:10:48,998 --> 01:10:50h,458
Your're my brother. and I care for you.

382
01:10:51,709 --> 01:10:55,127
All you care about is your next-door 
neighbor and her Goddamn cat.

383
01:11:01,296 --> 01:11:03,924
I'm worried about her. 

384
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:07,509
I'm not. Her telegram's 
all the explanation I need.

385
01:11:08,759 --> 01:11:10,012
I guess that makes me some kind of nut.

386
01:11:17,387 --> 01:11:19,388
Isn't it going to get crowded in here?

387
01:11:39,638 --> 01:11:44,765
Nancy... Alex just left.
He's gone looking for the girl.

388
01:11:46,016 --> 01:11:51,518
well, I wish him luck.
It's a big bleeding city out there.

389
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:14,654
And there is no problem in this great city
that cannot be solved.

390
01:18:14,821 --> 01:18:19,689
If we just have the patience, willingness, 
and energy to set about doing it.

391
01:18:20,608 --> 01:18:23,693
We are in the center of fashion...

392
01:18:27,943 --> 01:18:29,904
Just a moment, please.

393
01:18:30,112 --> 01:18:35,238
- Dr. Carter, this is Alex Morgan.
- Angie's friend. yes Mr. Morgan?

394
01:18:35,488 --> 01:18:37,533
I'm sorry I called so early.

395
01:18:37,783 --> 01:18:40,453
That's all right. I'm an early riser.
What can do I for You?

396
01:18:40,703 --> 01:18:43,080
Angie left town and I got a telegram from her,

397
01:18:43,331 --> 01:18:46,792
Yes. I received a similar telegram.

398
01:18:46,943 --> 01:18:49,878
She left her cat without food?

399
01:18:50,671 --> 01:18:54,549
- That is unusual.
- She mentioned something about Tulsa.

400
01:18:54,758 --> 01:18:56,510
Do you have her Tulsa address?

401
01:18:57,010 --> 01:18:59,011
- No
- Or number? Does she have a family?

402
01:19:00,261 --> 01:19:05,722
Mr. Morgan, I frankly doubt that Angie
come from Tulsa at all.

403
01:19:06,139 --> 01:19:11,226
Dead mother and father, Rich legacy... I believe
it all to be a contrived fantasy background.

404
01:19:12,392 --> 01:19:14,229
Angie's a very sick girl.

405
01:19:14,395 --> 01:19:18,440
Sick enough to leave the cat she loves 
so much to starve to death?

406
01:19:20,358 --> 01:19:21,110
I don't buy that, Doctor.

407
01:19:22,819 --> 01:19:24,238
Maybe you should call the police.

408
01:19:24,488 --> 01:19:27,989
I'm going to.
Thank you very much.

409
01:19:50,198 --> 01:19:54,508
What are you doing out there?
Eavesdropping?

410
01:19:54,716 --> 01:19:55,535
What are you doing in here?

411
01:20:03,743 --> 01:20:06,329
There's a law against breaking and entering.
Didn't you know?

412
01:20:06,796 --> 01:20:07,739
What you want?

413
01:20:08,206 --> 01:20:15,875
I lived in your shadow long enough.
I want my dignity, Alex.
You took it away a long time ago.

414
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,461
I'm taking it back.

415
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:31,215
You bastard. You sold your 
life for a Goddamn handout.

416
01:20:38,675 --> 01:20:40,676
You son of a bitch!

417
01:20:40,884 --> 01:20:47,678
Right ! The son of the same bitch who bore you,
Greased your way with her slimy love,

418
01:20:48,263 --> 01:20:54,349
Made it all so easy for you... who opened the
doors to all the good things in life

419
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:57,559
And spared you all its sick little whores.

420
01:20:57,767 --> 01:21:03,727
You right brother. We're sons of 
the biggest bitch who ever lived.

421
01:21:08,978 --> 01:21:13,438
Don't worry about me. I don't need you 
anymore. I don't need anybody.

422
01:21:13,647 --> 01:21:18,774
I can make it on my own.
But you, Alex...

423
01:21:19,066 --> 01:21:24,070
You're in terrible trouble.
Your audience left at intermission.

424
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:34,700
Me. Nancy, that little piece that lives here...
We're all out of your life now.

425
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,662
- What's that suppose to mean?
- Just what I'm saying.

426
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:25,455
I feel like taking a whole botlle of sleeping pills.
Jim certainly would be happier, and so would Madge.

427
01:23:25,706 --> 01:23:28,875
[Repeat]

428
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:42,085
After a decent interval of mourning,
they could marry.

429
01:24:04,335 --> 01:24:12,503
- Well, It's the perfect solution, isn't it?
- It's time to go to work.

430
01:24:14,172 --> 01:24:16,216
Dr. Carter.
Dr. Carter, I need to talk to you.

431
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,468
I want to buy a doll.

432
01:24:43,677 --> 01:24:50,514
Angie, no, Put down the scissors.
Don't kill me, Angie!

433
01:24:50,764 --> 01:24:54,558
Don't kill me, Angie Please.

434
01:24:54,725 --> 01:25:03,643
I didn't. I didn't kill you. I didn't.

435
01:25:25,228 --> 01:25:35,273
Where? where? where?
Oh You're gone.

436
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:22,527
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy went home.

437
01:27:22,986 --> 01:27:27,655
This little piggy had rosty beef,
This little piggy had home.

438
01:27:28,939 --> 01:27:33,857
And this little piggy...
All the way home.

439
01:27:33,966 --> 01:27:40,236
Ugly! ugly! ugly!

440
01:30:04,128 --> 01:30:11,339
What are you doing here?
Where's Richard?

441
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:14,507
Where you usually find him. in the bedroom.

442
01:30:36,674 --> 01:30:38,925
You killed him.

443
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:45,512
Yes. Two days ago with a pair of scissors.
I used to watch you come here for months.

444
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:50,640
I had a key made from the 
one I found in your bag.

445
01:30:50,849 --> 01:30:56,810
One night I even dared to come in and listen to
you making love. You sounded fulfilled.

446
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:02,855
- Why?
- Morbid jealousy.

447
01:31:02,105 --> 01:31:07,565
You killed him because...
I was seeing him?

448
01:31:08,773 --> 01:31:11,277
For seeing him? No!
For screwing him, yes.

449
01:31:13,986 --> 01:31:15,238
- You're crazy.
- Absolutely

450
01:31:22,446 --> 01:31:24,617
The phone doesn't work.

451
01:31:28,285 --> 01:31:36,369
You won't get away with this.
I'll going to the police.

452
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:38,915
No, You won't.

453
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:44,293
You're much too ambitious to risk at all that
your political career,

454
01:31:44,543 --> 01:31:48,296
Everything for both of us, Down the drain.

455
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:52,881
You're pretty good at getting 
into people's heads, aren't you?

456
01:31:53,047 --> 01:31:55,674
Top of the class at berkeley.

457
01:31:55,853 --> 01:31:59,147
It's not going to work.
They're gonna to find you.

458
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:04,441
No darling. They'll find her.

459
01:32:17,651 --> 01:32:22,946
I know her, She's one of your patients.

460
01:32:25,155 --> 01:32:29,698
Positive Schizophrenic, Complex Father Fixation,
Repressed sexuality...

461
01:32:29,865 --> 01:32:32,284
All of wich makes her a perdect
foil for this little drama.

462
01:32:33,576 --> 01:32:38,994
But she'll go to the police.
She knows the truth.

463
01:32:39,203 --> 01:32:44,623
Does she? I think she'll be this way for
long long time.

464
01:32:54,336 --> 01:32:56,588
What is she doing?

465
01:32:57,038 --> 01:30:00,299
She's keeping house for her stepfather...
in there. Transference is total.

466
01:33:01,841 --> 01:33:03,593
Angie finally found her ignorant Billy.

467
01:33:03,843 --> 01:33:07,804
I learned through hypnosis that her incestuous
stepfather sprted a red beard

468
01:33:07,865 --> 01:33:10,643
and was murdered by Angie's mother
with the pairs of scissors. 

469
01:33:11,736 --> 01:33:18,037
It's amazing... red beard, a few sound efects, 
some screws and bolts... a little production...

470
01:33:18,404 --> 01:33:22,823
And Angie just slipped through the looking glass.

471
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:27,203
Your boyfriend's genius provided
the perfect theater.

472
01:33:31,411 --> 01:33:34,121
Even the bird cooperated.

473
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:40,501
Memorized his lines like a trouper.

474
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:58,045
I love you, Ann. The past is out the way.
We can go on.

475
01:33:59,295 --> 01:34:05,339
I'm willing to continue our life together.
Are you willing, Ann?

476
01:34:07,066 --> 01:34:08,635
And pretend none of this happened?

477
01:34:08,853 --> 01:34:11,564
No, I want you to remember 
that this did happened,

478
01:34:11,725 --> 01:34:13,687
And I never want you forget it.

479
01:34:14,895 --> 01:34:18,231
Now helping me in, we've got 
loose ends to tie up here.

480
01:34:18,898 --> 01:34:21,358
We've still the scissors to locate.

481
01:34:21,401 --> 01:34:24,361
I didn't think she'd have
the guts to pull them out.

482
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:27,906
and I didn't think she'd stab
me in the elevator eader.

483
01:34:28,866 --> 01:34:32,826
You take the powder room,
and I'll check the bedroom.

484
01:34:43,504 --> 01:34:47,881
Ann, Help me, Find the scissors.

485
01:36:44,968 --> 01:36:48,763
Angie! Angie, Open the door.

486
01:36:52,482 --> 01:36:56,401
Angie, Daddy wants you to open the door.

487
01:37:06,652 --> 01:37:12,904
Angie, Pick up the doorknob
and open the door.

488
01:37:18,154 --> 01:37:28,616
Angie, Daddy's not mad. he's not mad,
but open the door Angie.

489
01:38:49,824 --> 01:37:51,117
Over there. Pull up over there.

490
01:39:00,368 --> 01:39:09,702
You ok? It's Alex, it's Alex.

491
01:39:23,161 --> 01:39:30,163
Everything's going to be all right.
Everything's going to be fine.
