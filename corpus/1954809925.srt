his daughter, Rayna.</font>

person he trusted.</font>

with your pink eye infected fingers.</font>

212

into my mouth while you're at it.</font>

00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,762

I'll do it.</font>

252
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:27,388
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, just blend in.
Let somebody else win.</font>

253
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,078

Everything.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">No, hang on.
No.</font>

261
00:15:44,955 --> 00:15:46,713
<font face="Tahoma">Because you were just as

Perfect face.</font>

267
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,911

<font face="Tahoma">Silent kind of thing.</font>

272
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,649
<font face="Tahoma">I don' think that.</font>

273
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,707
<font face="Tahoma">Like sort of upside
down kidney bean.</font>

274

Anyway, I'm taking some time off.</font>

295
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:03,494
<font face="Tahoma">So I'll see you guys
when I get back.</font>

296
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,043
<font face="Tahoma">- Oh.
- Where're you going?</font>

297
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,676
<font face="Tahoma">- Capri.
- Capri. - Capri.</font>

298
00:17:07,706 --> 00:17:09,810
<font face="Tahoma">I wished I could just
stick around here, you know.</font>

299
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:11,467
<font face="Tahoma">Curl up with a good book.</font>

300
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:14,823
<font face="Tahoma">- But, I have a yacht full of
friends waiting for me. - Wow.</font>

301
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,194
<font face="Tahoma"> Anywho.
I'll see you guys when I get back.</font>

302
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:18,530
<font face="Tahoma">All freckle and tanned</font>

303
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:19,965
<font face="Tahoma">- We're gonna see you.
- Yeah.</font>

304
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,339
<font face="Tahoma">- Bye.
- Bye.</font>

305
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:26,639
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, sorry.
Susan's ill.</font>

306
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:29,106
<font face="Tahoma">It's her stomach</font>

307
00:17:30,322 --> 00:17:32,169
<font face="Tahoma">My god.
Thank you for that.</font>

308
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,828
<font face="Tahoma">- Why would you do that?
- I'm sorry, I panicked.</font>

309
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,965
<font face="Tahoma">What a great moment.</font>

310
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:38,995
<font face="Tahoma">- Just looked a her.
- Oh, I know. That dress.</font>

311
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,551
<font face="Tahoma">Look at her confidence.</font>

312
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:43,662
<font face="Tahoma">They are even allowed
to smoke in here.</font>

313
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:46,033
<font face="Tahoma">I'm gonna go home.</font>

314
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:48,240
<font face="Tahoma">- No, come on.
- Yes.</font>

315
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,662
<font face="Tahoma">Susan.</font>

316
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:51,029
<font face="Tahoma">- Sorry.
- Feel better.</font>

317
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,303
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, thank you.
Yeah.</font>

318
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:56,582
<font face="Tahoma">- Fine. You good?
- Okay, Coop. Just pulling up.</font>

319
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,898
<font face="Tahoma">Susan, you're killing it.</font>

320
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:00,451
<font face="Tahoma">Oh good.
You know what, they are chicory.</font>

321
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:02,484
<font face="Tahoma">- Oh.
- Yeah.</font>

322
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,079
<font face="Tahoma">Any sign of her in the house?</font>

323
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:07,950
<font face="Tahoma">Heat sensors aren't
picking anything up.</font>

324
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:10,986
<font face="Tahoma">There's some kind of interference.
I don't like this, Fine.</font>

325
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:12,722
<font face="Tahoma">I'm up for the challenge.</font>

326
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:14,592
<font face="Tahoma">Let's go in.</font>

327
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,446
<font face="Tahoma">Shoot. There is something
wrong with your camera.</font>

328
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:21,931
<font face="Tahoma">Can you switch out
for a new one.</font>

329
00:18:21,963 --> 00:18:23,432
<font face="Tahoma">Too late.</font>

330
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:24,729
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.</font>

331
00:18:30,866 --> 00:18:33,040
<font face="Tahoma">No security.</font>

332
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,993
<font face="Tahoma">Her father would never have
let himself this exposed.</font>

333
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:39,133
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. Pull back, Fine.
This is too easy.</font>

334
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:41,692
<font face="Tahoma">I like things that are easy</font>

335
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:49,861
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god, Fine.</font>

336
00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,896
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know how you
do things like that.</font>

337
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,428
<font face="Tahoma">Hey.
Who's the finest of them all?</font>

338
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,242
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know.</font>

339
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,900
<font face="Tahoma">I'm guessing,
you?</font>

340
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,634
<font face="Tahoma">Drop your weapon.</font>

341
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,129
<font face="Tahoma">Fine, what's happening?</font>

342
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:05,705
<font face="Tahoma">Let me guess, whoever is in your ear
wants to know what's happening?</font>

343
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:08,221
<font face="Tahoma">He's about to die.</font>

344
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:10,321
<font face="Tahoma">That's what.</font>

345
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:16,186
<font face="Tahoma">Awfully big gun
for such a little girl.</font>

346
00:19:16,211 --> 00:19:18,412
<font face="Tahoma">God.
Don't say stuff like that.</font>

347
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,507
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. There's a knife rack
directly to your right.</font>

348
00:19:20,532 --> 00:19:22,896
<font face="Tahoma">The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.</font>

349
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:25,809
<font face="Tahoma">If you jump and launch.
You get the knife and disarm her.</font>

350
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:29,333
<font face="Tahoma">Did someone just suggested
you grabbed one of those knives.</font>

351
00:19:29,707 --> 00:19:31,389
<font face="Tahoma">No-no-no...!</font>

352
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:33,166
<font face="Tahoma">Damn it!</font>

353
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,042
<font face="Tahoma">Fine?</font>

354
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,676
<font face="Tahoma">Can they see me right now?</font>

355
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,413
<font face="Tahoma">Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.</font>

356
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,583
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.</font>

357
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:50,798
<font face="Tahoma">His name was Bradley Fine.</font>

358
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,531
<font face="Tahoma">He worked for the CIA.</font>

359
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,441
<font face="Tahoma">Other top agents include,</font>

360
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:59,866
<font face="Tahoma">Matthew Wright, Timothy Cress,
Rick Ford and Karen Walker</font>

361
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,197
<font face="Tahoma">Come on, Fine.
Come on.</font>

362
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:05,944
<font face="Tahoma">I know who all
your active agents are.</font>

363
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,676
<font face="Tahoma">So. Unless you like the
body count to grow.</font>

364
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:13,079
<font face="Tahoma">I suggest you stay
far away from me.</font>

365
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:14,774
<font face="Tahoma">Now grab some tissues,</font>

366
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,796
<font face="Tahoma">because it's about
to get real sad.</font>

367
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,309
<font face="Tahoma">No, don't.
No!</font>

368
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,778
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.
Fine.</font>

369
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:27,059
<font face="Tahoma">As Deputy Director.</font>

370
00:20:27,362 --> 00:20:30,646
<font face="Tahoma">I've never had
a more difficulty duty,</font>

371
00:20:30,686 --> 00:20:34,585
<font face="Tahoma">than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.</font>

372
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:36,282
<font face="Tahoma">From Dover,</font>

373
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:38,296
<font face="Tahoma">to the family services.</font>

374
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,343
<font face="Tahoma">To memorials like these.</font>

375
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,733
<font face="Tahoma">It's tough to say goodbye.</font>

376
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,851
<font face="Tahoma">There's nothing you could
have done, Susan.</font>

377
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,821
<font face="Tahoma">Bradley Fine.</font>

378
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:48,405
<font face="Tahoma">Was more than just
a co-worker and a friend.</font>

379
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,106
<font face="Tahoma">He's a part of our family.</font>

380
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:53,177
<font face="Tahoma">As family, even knowing that
the universe has a plan</font>

381
00:20:53,202 --> 00:20:55,416
<font face="Tahoma">for each human life.</font>

382
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,719
<font face="Tahoma">It's hard to accept the
sudden lost of such a</font>

383
00:20:57,744 --> 00:21:01,235
<font face="Tahoma">good and decent person.</font>

384
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:04,902
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. There's a knife rack
directly to your right.</font>

385
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,844
<font face="Tahoma">Susan. I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.</font>

386
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:10,504
<font face="Tahoma">I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now,</font>

387
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:14,677
<font face="Tahoma">but please refrain from
using the term "thundercunt".</font>

388
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,520
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.  I-I didn't realise
I wrote that, I'm sorry.</font>

389
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,927
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy,
I'm sending you a photo.</font>

390
00:21:28,952 --> 00:21:31,695
<font face="Tahoma">It's in pretty bad shape.
Can you enhance it.</font>

391
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,801
<font face="Tahoma">Paris.</font>

392
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,703
<font face="Tahoma">How the fuck did this thwart,
find out our fucking names?</font>

393
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:48,115
<font face="Tahoma">We don’t know.</font>

394
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,246
<font face="Tahoma">And I've looked way back
where the 'T' word for.</font>

395
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:52,027
<font face="Tahoma">You're not immune
from the HR department.</font>

396
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:54,806
<font face="Tahoma">Grow up. The thwart means something
completely different in England.</font>

397
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:56,609
<font face="Tahoma">Well, here it means vagina.</font>

398
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,773
<font face="Tahoma">Anyway.
Obviously we're talking about a mole.</font>

399
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:00,687
<font face="Tahoma">It could be a mole that
could've hacked our system.</font>

400
00:22:00,712 --> 00:22:02,839
<font face="Tahoma">It's anyone's guess.
The bottom line is.</font>

401
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:06,326
<font face="Tahoma">Rayna Boyanov is about to sell
a small scale tactical nuclear weapon</font>

402
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:07,719
<font face="Tahoma">to a terrorist organization.</font>

403
00:22:07,744 --> 00:22:10,295
<font face="Tahoma">And we don't know where
she or the bomb is.</font>

404
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,748
<font face="Tahoma">And fortunately, our analyst,
Susan Cooper found the lead.</font>

405
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:16,528
<font face="Tahoma">Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca.</font>

406
00:22:16,553 --> 00:22:18,443
<font face="Tahoma">We've long suspected
that De Luca of working</font>

407
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:20,917
<font face="Tahoma">as an intermediate
with terrorist groups.</font>

408
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:23,485
<font face="Tahoma">Rayna maybe using him
to find buyers for the nuke.</font>

409
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,932
<font face="Tahoma">The number was to a office
he keeps in Paris.</font>

410
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:28,417
<font face="Tahoma">I told you to send me
in there instead of Fine.</font>

411
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:29,436
<font face="Tahoma">And you didn't.</font>

412
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:31,558
<font face="Tahoma">And now Fine is dead.
I'm kind of fuck in.</font>

413
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,649
<font face="Tahoma">You can't.</font>

414
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,652
<font face="Tahoma">We need someone to follow De Luca
without being detected.</font>

415
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,743
<font face="Tahoma">And I would hopefully
takes us to Rayna.</font>

416
00:22:36,768 --> 00:22:39,021
<font face="Tahoma">But it can't be
any of you.</font>

417
00:22:39,046 --> 00:22:41,025
<font face="Tahoma">Here's what we do.</font>

418
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,891
<font face="Tahoma">I go into the
face-off machine.</font>

419
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,548
<font face="Tahoma">Get a whole new face.</font>

420
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,814
<font face="Tahoma">I turned up.
They'll never know it's me.</font>

421
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,455
<font face="Tahoma">Do you have quarters?
'Cause it cost 50 cents.</font>

422
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,772
<font face="Tahoma">What, I've got to pay?</font>

423
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:52,115
<font face="Tahoma">No, because it doesn't exist.</font>

424
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,208
<font face="Tahoma">Yes, it does!</font>

425
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:56,550
<font face="Tahoma">I heard Chress and Wright
talked about it in the shitter.</font>

426
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:58,910
<font face="Tahoma">I'm pretty sure that
they're pulling your leg.</font>

427
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,165
<font face="Tahoma">You pair of fucking vaginas.</font>

428
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,460
<font face="Tahoma">Seriously.
You got to cut that out.</font>

429
00:23:03,485 --> 00:23:06,172
<font face="Tahoma">Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.</font>

430
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:07,827
<font face="Tahoma">Doesn't matter if
we've been exposed.</font>

431
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:10,965
<font face="Tahoma">We've all gone deep before,
and we always gotten our guy.</font>

432
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,388
<font face="Tahoma">Guys.
This is more than just a kill mission.</font>

433
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:16,294
<font face="Tahoma">Now we get Rayna, De Luca
and some top terrorist leadership</font>

434
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,540
<font face="Tahoma">and get the weapon back,
if we do this right.</font>

435
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:22,673
<font face="Tahoma">We just need someone who could
shadow them without attracting attention.</font>

436
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:24,498
<font face="Tahoma">- We need someone invisible.
- I'll do it.</font>

437
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,442
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, thanks lunch lady.</font>

438
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,165
<font face="Tahoma">I'm serious.
I...</font>

439
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,135
<font face="Tahoma">I've never been
out in the field.</font>

440
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,580
<font face="Tahoma">Exactly.
Stupid fucking idea.</font>

441
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:33,865
<font face="Tahoma">My point is that</font>

442
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,775
<font face="Tahoma"> it's highly doubtful
I've ever been exposed</font>

443
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,707
<font face="Tahoma">But you worked with Fine.</font>

444
00:23:38,732 --> 00:23:40,051
<font face="Tahoma">They may have a
record of you too.</font>

445
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:41,294
<font face="Tahoma">Possibly.
But.</font>

446
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:44,240
<font face="Tahoma">You know. The odds of them
knowing my face are very low.</font>

447
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,757
<font face="Tahoma">Ms. Crocker,
I would really like to do this.</font>

448
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:48,777
<font face="Tahoma">For Fine.</font>

449
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,337
<font face="Tahoma">You're not seriously
considering this, are you?</font>

450
00:23:51,362 --> 00:23:53,180
<font face="Tahoma">If you think,
I'm going to sit by</font>

451
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,833
<font face="Tahoma">and let you send in a fucking
secretary to do my work.</font>

452
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:58,762
<font face="Tahoma">You might as well accept
my resignation now.</font>

453
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:00,146
<font face="Tahoma">If I can jump in.
I'm</font>

454
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,933
<font face="Tahoma">I'm technically,
classified as an agent.</font>

455
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,053
<font face="Tahoma">Look.</font>

456
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:07,372
<font face="Tahoma">Full.
Full agent, so.</font>

457
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:08,943
<font face="Tahoma">Agent, agent, agent.</font>

458
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:10,266
<font face="Tahoma">I'm agent.</font>

459
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:11,948
<font face="Tahoma">Are you considering this?</font>

460
00:24:11,973 --> 00:24:15,107
<font face="Tahoma">For your safety and the safety
of those around this table.</font>

461
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:16,574
<font face="Tahoma">I'm considering it.</font>

462
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:19,848
<font face="Tahoma">Then consider this.
I quit.</font>

463
00:24:21,554 --> 00:24:23,720
<font face="Tahoma">And I know there is a
fucking face-off machine.</font>

464
00:24:23,745 --> 00:24:26,401
<font face="Tahoma">You're just keeping it
a secret from me.</font>

465
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,304
<font face="Tahoma">That hasn't happened before.</font>

466
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:34,190
<font face="Tahoma">It is quite a lovely office.</font>

467
00:24:34,215 --> 00:24:36,056
<font face="Tahoma">What's your deal, Cooper?</font>

468
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,572
<font face="Tahoma">- What do you mean?
- You got a faery side?</font>

469
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:42,018
<font face="Tahoma">I really did in that report
mean to write cunning.</font>

470
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:43,593
<font face="Tahoma">I've been going over your files.</font>

471
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,753
<font face="Tahoma">You're top of the class
at the academy</font>

472
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,441
<font face="Tahoma">in all computer and support skills.
No surprise there.</font>

473
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,088
<font face="Tahoma">But you have a certain tame</font>

474
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:54,128
<font face="Tahoma">demeanor around the office that
says you've never even held a gun.</font>

475
00:24:54,153 --> 00:24:55,485
<font face="Tahoma">So imagine</font>

476
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,094
<font face="Tahoma">my surprise when I saw footage
from this drill back at the farm.</font>

477
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:04,783
<font face="Tahoma">Is that... kidding.</font>

478
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,787
<font face="Tahoma">Is that me?
That can't really...</font>

479
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:09,315
<font face="Tahoma"> Stupid gun.
  Eah!</font>

480
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,777
<font face="Tahoma">- Somebody definitely sped this up.
- Son of a bitch.</font>

481
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,206
<font face="Tahoma">Camera angle,
does not make...</font>

482
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:17,367
<font face="Tahoma">- Cooper. Cooper. Stop it,
- Okay, uh.</font>

483
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:18,607
<font face="Tahoma">Ouch.</font>

484
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:20,733
<font face="Tahoma">Those contacts, that's a,
you know.</font>

485
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,588
<font face="Tahoma">I must have watched
this 15 times now.</font>

486
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:24,497
<font face="Tahoma">Because,
what the fuck.</font>

487
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,280
<font face="Tahoma">- Well, I...
- I almost put it up on YouTube.</font>

488
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:29,246
<font face="Tahoma">Well, I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable.</font>

489
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,462
<font face="Tahoma">with the event.</font>

490
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,673
<font face="Tahoma">But I would also like to say
it was over 10 years ago.</font>

491
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,051
<font face="Tahoma">The instructor was not harmed.</font>

492
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,384
<font face="Tahoma">- Fine, was your mentor. Right?
- Yes.</font>

493
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,867
<font face="Tahoma">Why did you not
become a field agent?</font>

494
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:41,994
<font face="Tahoma">Well, we're such a great fit
and a great team.</font>

495
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,059
<font face="Tahoma">I mean Fine,
made some great points</font>

496
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,865
<font face="Tahoma">You know, maybe I match
better with... just staying.</font>

497
00:25:46,897 --> 00:25:48,553
<font face="Tahoma">- In the Bureau.
- Well.</font>

498
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:49,784
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.
He sniped you.</font>

499
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:52,054
<font face="Tahoma">All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.</font>

500
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:54,909
<font face="Tahoma">I really thought he
made some great points.</font>

501
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,441
<font face="Tahoma">Women.</font>

502
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,183
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, have you any
field training since then.</font>

503
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,592
<font face="Tahoma">- 10 years is a long time.
- No, ma'am.</font>

504
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,316
<font face="Tahoma">Normally I would send
you back to the farm,</font>

505
00:26:02,341 --> 00:26:04,158
<font face="Tahoma">but there's no time and
I can't take a chance</font>

506
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,244
<font face="Tahoma">of anyone leaking your name.</font>

507
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,509
<font face="Tahoma">Am I-Am I going?</font>

508
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,122
<font face="Tahoma">- You're going.
- Okay. (Jes...)</font>

509
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:16,906
<font face="Tahoma">- But it's a track and report mission only.
- Got it.</font>

510
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:20,146
<font face="Tahoma">We'll be giving you a new identity.
You will not longer be Susan Cooper.</font>

511
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,592
<font face="Tahoma">- Oh, I have a few ideas for that.
- Your new name.</font>

512
00:26:22,617 --> 00:26:26,287
<font face="Tahoma">I was just spit-balling and I thought
Serafina, Mannix, Gisele.</font>

513
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:27,886
<font face="Tahoma">Carol Jenkins.</font>

514
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,340
<font face="Tahoma">Carol
Jenkins.</font>

515
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,750
<font face="Tahoma">You know.
If I may, ma'am.</font>

516
00:26:30,775 --> 00:26:33,527
<font face="Tahoma">There was a 13 year old
girl name Carol,</font>

517
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,049
<font face="Tahoma">that used to come take me
around the neighbourhood</font>

518
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:37,892
<font face="Tahoma">and used my braid as a dog leash.</font>

519
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,132
<font face="Tahoma">And made me begged for biscuits.
So.</font>

520
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:43,741
<font face="Tahoma">- Carol Jenkins.
- Yes, Carol Jenkins.</font>

521
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,224
<font face="Tahoma">Carol Jenkins is a
single mother of 4.</font>

522
00:26:46,249 --> 00:26:50,380
<font face="Tahoma">Temporarily relocated from Delaware
to increase sales for a software company.</font>

523
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,453
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.
That is-That is.</font>

524
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,222
<font face="Tahoma">a different occup....
Huh!</font>

525
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,557
<font face="Tahoma">- Is there a problem?
- No!</font>

526
00:26:57,582 --> 00:26:58,888
<font face="Tahoma">Just wondering if</font>

527
00:26:58,913 --> 00:27:01,952
<font face="Tahoma">this is my family of 4,
taken hostages.</font>

528
00:27:01,977 --> 00:27:03,161
<font face="Tahoma">I'm just not sure</font>

529
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,691
<font face="Tahoma">how De Luca is going to take me
seriously if I looked like this.</font>

530
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:07,400
<font face="Tahoma">De Luca is not going
to take you anything.</font>

531
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,697
<font face="Tahoma">In case you did not
hear me.</font>

532
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,884
<font face="Tahoma">You're not to make direct
contact with any of the targets.</font>

533
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:14,015
<font face="Tahoma">Track and report.</font>

534
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,908
<font face="Tahoma">Now we're setting you
up in a surveillance office</font>

535
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,222
<font face="Tahoma">across the street from De Luca's.</font>

536
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,893
<font face="Tahoma">You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk</font>

537
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,500
<font face="Tahoma">and have access to voice and
data coming into his office.</font>

538
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:23,358
<font face="Tahoma">And that's as sexy
as it gets.</font>

539
00:27:23,383 --> 00:27:26,769
<font face="Tahoma">One mistake, and we got a
nuclear bomb in the hands of terrorists.</font>

540
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:28,703
<font face="Tahoma">- Do you understand?
- Yes.</font>

541
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:32,003
<font face="Tahoma">Go see Patrick.
He's got special equipment for you.</font>

542
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:38,009
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.</font>

543
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,163
<font face="Tahoma">What are you doing?</font>

544
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:43,398
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, did you come up
with your spy name yet?</font>

545
00:27:43,423 --> 00:27:45,766
<font face="Tahoma">My would be
Amber Valentine.</font>

546
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,850
<font face="Tahoma">That sounds like you're
an adult film star.</font>

547
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,446
<font face="Tahoma">No,
I did this 'Find name formula'.</font>

548
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:52,271
<font face="Tahoma">Amber was the name of my first pet
and I grew up on Valentine Street.</font>

549
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,049
<font face="Tahoma">Did you come up
with your porn name?</font>

550
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,880
<font face="Tahoma">- Oh, no. Amber is a spy name.
- Yes</font>

551
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,472
<font face="Tahoma">- No.
- What was yours be?</font>

552
00:27:57,497 --> 00:28:00,639
<font face="Tahoma">Meatball Martin Luther King Junior Boulevard.</font>

553
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:03,157
<font face="Tahoma">- Yeah.
- Wow.</font>

554
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:06,549
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.</font>

555
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,866
<font face="Tahoma">I'm so excited.</font>

556
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,149
<font face="Tahoma">- You're a spy.
- I know, I know. I guess you can say...</font>

557
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,324
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, I got to get one of those.
You think you're going to get one of those!</font>

558
00:28:14,349 --> 00:28:16,247
<font face="Tahoma">No, I'm not.
No, I'm not.</font>

559
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,929
<font face="Tahoma">Look at that.</font>

560
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,831
<font face="Tahoma">That looks high tech.</font>

561
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:21,858
<font face="Tahoma">It's like the future.</font>

562
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:23,879
<font face="Tahoma">- Patrick.
- Susan.</font>

563
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,165
<font face="Tahoma">- Hey, Patrick.
- Yes.</font>

564
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,564
<font face="Tahoma">I was given specific
instructions by Elaine</font>

565
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:29,988
<font face="Tahoma">to tailor these
gadgets to you.</font>

566
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:31,431
<font face="Tahoma">Wow.
Look at them.</font>

567
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:34,259
<font face="Tahoma">-These are not yours.
- Oh.</font>

568
00:28:36,872 --> 00:28:38,487
<font face="Tahoma">Is that a whistle</font>

569
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:40,595
<font face="Tahoma">Elaine wanted you to
only be carrying items</font>

570
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,973
<font face="Tahoma">of single woman traveling
through Europe would have.</font>

571
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,766
<font face="Tahoma">But she can get that
from any pharmacy</font>

572
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,369
<font face="Tahoma">Not this whistle.</font>

573
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,618
<font face="Tahoma">When you blow
through this whistle.</font>

574
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,433
<font face="Tahoma">A small poisonous dart flies out,
neutralizing your target.</font>

575
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:55,425
<font face="Tahoma">Also, it needs your
finger prints on it to work.</font>

576
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,263
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, that is-that is really neat.</font>

577
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:59,443
<font face="Tahoma">That is really super cool.</font>

578
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:02,380
<font face="Tahoma">This anti-fungi spray
can freeze and disable</font>

579
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,160
<font face="Tahoma"> any security system.</font>

580
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,674
<font face="Tahoma">Wow.
That is</font>

581
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:08,046
<font face="Tahoma">quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.</font>

582
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:09,647
<font face="Tahoma">It's also a pepper spray.</font>

583
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:11,999
<font face="Tahoma">Why not,  just make it
look like pepper spray.</font>

584
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:13,060
<font face="Tahoma">It's a...</font>

585
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:15,102
<font face="Tahoma">It's a pretty good idea.
Alright. Well, next time.</font>

586
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:16,455
<font face="Tahoma">Well, I can-I can wait</font>

587
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,477
<font face="Tahoma">if you wanna print up
a new label.</font>

588

00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:50,460
<font face="Tahoma">Might just be a looky-loo.</font>

734
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:53,264
<font face="Tahoma">Well. Keep looking.
I've got a feeling about this guy.</font>

735
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:56,682
<font face="Tahoma">Well, I've got a feeling
you're about to fuck things up.</font>

736
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,143
<font face="Tahoma">Oh. Bugger me with a fishfork.
It's Ford.</font>

737
00:37:01,168 --> 00:37:03,439
<font face="Tahoma">Sharon? Ford is in the field.
Did you know this?</font>

738
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:05,623
<font face="Tahoma">Until he checks in,
there's nothing I can do.</font>

739
00:37:05,648 --> 00:37:07,992
<font face="Tahoma">You go make some friends
and stop stalking me.</font>

740
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,208
<font face="Tahoma">Was it your mission
to tip off the target,</font>

741
00:37:10,233 --> 00:37:12,787
<font face="Tahoma">so he burns everything
in their butts?</font>

742
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:14,883
<font face="Tahoma">It's so well done.
Phenomenal.</font>

743
00:37:14,908 --> 00:37:18,082
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sure they got suspicious because
they've been seeing you all over the place.</font>

744
00:37:18,107 --> 00:37:20,332
<font face="Tahoma">- You're going to get yourself killed.
- Nothing kills me.</font>

745
00:37:20,357 --> 00:37:23,500
<font face="Tahoma">I am immune to
179 different kinds of poison.</font>

746
00:37:23,525 --> 00:37:26,247
<font face="Tahoma">I know because I
ingested them all at once.</font>

747
00:37:26,272 --> 00:37:28,891
<font face="Tahoma">When I was deep undercover
in an underground,</font>

748
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,590
<font face="Tahoma">- poison ingesting crime ring.
- Wow.</font>

749
00:37:31,615 --> 00:37:34,189
<font face="Tahoma">It was like dog fighting.
But instead of dogs fighting</font>

750
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:39,936
<font face="Tahoma">It was humans ingesting poison and rich people
will bet whether we would live or die.</font>

751
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:42,255
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah. I'm having a hard time
with this one.</font>

752
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,997
<font face="Tahoma">I died for 5 minutes,
and then I came back to life.</font>

753
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:48,092
<font face="Tahoma">Was it worth... He looks like
he's in the cast of Newsies.</font>

754
00:37:48,117 --> 00:37:49,875
<font face="Tahoma">Does Crocker even
know you're here?</font>

755
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,429
<font face="Tahoma">I don't need anyone's permission
to save the country.</font>

756
00:37:52,454 --> 00:37:54,890
<font face="Tahoma">and avenge my dear friend,
Bradley Fine's death.</font>

757
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:57,638
<font face="Tahoma">You've didn't ever liked him.
You used to call him Beverly Whine.</font>

758
00:37:57,663 --> 00:38:00,162
<font face="Tahoma">You had him as secret Santa
and you gave him tampons.</font>

759
00:38:00,187 --> 00:38:01,840
<font face="Tahoma">It's called the rivalry of men.</font>

760
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,254
<font face="Tahoma">You wouldn't understand it.
Unless you got the dong</font>

761
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:05,700
<font face="Tahoma">up underneath that skirt.</font>

762
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,933
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. That's super rude and
don't say dong. Don't do that.</font>

763
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:12,138
<font face="Tahoma">Nobody sees me when
I don't want them to.</font>

764
00:38:12,163 --> 00:38:15,131
<font face="Tahoma">I move like a fucking shadow.</font>

765
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:17,153
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.
Excuse me, sir.</font>

766
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:18,779
<font face="Tahoma">He's gone all sorts of rogue.</font>

767
00:38:18,804 --> 00:38:20,637
<font face="Tahoma">Sharon says he really did quit.
Elaine couldn’t stop him.</font>

768
00:38:20,662 --> 00:38:21,865
<font face="Tahoma">He's out for blood.</font>

769
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:25,271
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, a real tough guy and
his Louis Vuitton backpack.</font>

770
00:38:27,718 --> 00:38:29,218
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy, do you see that?</font>

771
00:38:29,243 --> 00:38:31,469
<font face="Tahoma">It's the man from the fire.</font>

772
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:34,793
<font face="Tahoma">- I'm follow him.
- Oh, exciting.</font>

773
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:36,335
<font face="Tahoma">And I'm follow you,
follow him.</font>

774
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,851
<font face="Tahoma">So I'm having
quite a day here.</font>

775
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:46,329
<font face="Tahoma">Do you think Ford is
leading him to a trap?</font>

776
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:49,347
<font face="Tahoma">Idiot doesn't even know
he is being followed.</font>

777
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:54,980
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. He is meeting with some woman.
I don't recognize her.</font>

778
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:56,640
<font face="Tahoma">You have any idea who she is?</font>

779
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:59,934
<font face="Tahoma">No, it's hard to make out.
Can you get any closer?</font>

780
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,022
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy, our guys just switched
Rick Ford's backpack.</font>

781
00:39:05,047 --> 00:39:06,795
<font face="Tahoma">It's a setup.</font>

782
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,289
<font face="Tahoma">I got to go warn him.</font>

783
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,751
<font face="Tahoma">Ford! Ford! Look out!
I got to get through!</font>

784
00:39:13,776 --> 00:39:15,254
<font face="Tahoma">I left my baby in the shop.</font>

785
00:39:15,279 --> 00:39:17,694
<font face="Tahoma">Get out of the way!
Let me through, I'm sick!</font>

786
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,842
<font face="Tahoma">Susan, tell them
you shat your pants.</font>

787
00:39:19,867 --> 00:39:21,689
<font face="Tahoma">That would get me
out of your way for sure.</font>

788
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:23,724
<font face="Tahoma">I shat my pants!</font>

789
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:26,403
<font face="Tahoma">Excuse me.
Ford!</font>

790
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:29,957
<font face="Tahoma">He's got a friend.</font>

791
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:35,024
<font face="Tahoma">Hello everyone!
Hands up!</font>

792
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:37,410
<font face="Tahoma">Let's dance!</font>

793
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:47,681
<font face="Tahoma">Ford!</font>

794
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:51,062
<font face="Tahoma">Ford!
Ford!</font>

795
00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:58,108
<font face="Tahoma">I need your mic!</font>

796
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,614
<font face="Tahoma">No... I need.
No!</font>

797
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,293
<font face="Tahoma">I...
No!</font>

798
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:04,734
<font face="Tahoma">No no no.
Don't.</font>

799
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:07,891
<font face="Tahoma">Susan, you're meant to be blending in.
 What are you doing?</font>

800
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,142
<font face="Tahoma">No!
Move!</font>

801
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:13,590
<font face="Tahoma">Rick Ford!</font>

802
00:40:14,527 --> 00:40:16,282
<font face="Tahoma">Give me the mike!</font>

803
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:19,830
<font face="Tahoma">What you're doing doesn't help!</font>

804
00:40:19,855 --> 00:40:21,506
<font face="Tahoma">Oh god.</font>

805
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,129
<font face="Tahoma">Rick Ford!</font>

806
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,602
<font face="Tahoma">They switched the bag!</font>

807
00:40:29,049 --> 00:40:30,448
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, fuck!</font>

808
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:32,963
<font face="Tahoma">Get out of the fucking way!
Move!</font>

809
00:40:32,988 --> 00:40:34,637
<font face="Tahoma">Get out of his way!</font>

810
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,097
<font face="Tahoma">Move!</font>

811
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,610
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, no.</font>

812
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,662
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy, I'm in pursuit on
one of the terrorists.</font>

813
00:40:57,687 --> 00:40:59,432
<font face="Tahoma">He took my picture,
he's going to blow my cover.</font>

814
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,816
<font face="Tahoma">You're in pursuit.
What will you do if you catch him?</font>

815
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:03,192
<font face="Tahoma">What in god's name are you
going to do when you catch him.</font>

816
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:05,348
<font face="Tahoma">Knock him over with a hammer.
I don't know.</font>

817
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:07,542
<font face="Tahoma">I'm still tracking and
reporting his location.</font>

818
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:09,431
<font face="Tahoma">This all seem very
Rick Fordy to me.</font>

819
00:41:09,456 --> 00:41:14,010
<font face="Tahoma">I do not condone this sexy but
reckless action of yours, Susan.</font>

820
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:25,641
<font face="Tahoma">Oh God.
He went into a building.</font>

821
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,851
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, girl.
Well done, that's it.</font>

822
00:41:27,876 --> 00:41:29,521
<font face="Tahoma">Time to call it a day now.</font>

823
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:31,691
<font face="Tahoma">Location is officially noted.</font>

824
00:41:31,716 --> 00:41:33,933
<font face="Tahoma">- I'm following him in.
- What?</font>

825
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,308
<font face="Tahoma">I'm doing this for Fine.</font>

826
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:46,679
<font face="Tahoma">He's at the top of the stairs.</font>

827
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,265
<font face="Tahoma">Oh God.
Please be careful.</font>

828
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,573
<font face="Tahoma">You are incredibly
out of your league.</font>

829
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,788
<font face="Tahoma">Oh. This is just like when I
watched myself in a sex tape.</font>

830
00:41:52,813 --> 00:41:54,685
<font face="Tahoma">There is just a lot of philandering
and laughable moments.</font>

831
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:57,740
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy, I need you to not talk,
until I ask you to.</font>

832
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,157
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry.
It's just that I'm really nervous.</font>

833
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:05,430
<font face="Tahoma">Be careful Susan.</font>

834
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:45,767
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, hey.
Imagine, running into you up here.</font>

835
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,595
<font face="Tahoma">I was just looking for my bird.
I..</font>

836
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:51,020
<font face="Tahoma">just looking...
Hey, Mr. Beanbag!</font>

837
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,938
<font face="Tahoma">You like birds?
Alright. Alright.</font>

838
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,688
<font face="Tahoma">Let me give you a warning.
I don't want to see anymore of that</font>

839
00:42:56,713 --> 00:42:59,073
<font face="Tahoma">funny bomb stuff.
You know?</font>

840
00:42:59,098 --> 00:43:00,764
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, that's enough.</font>

841
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,191
<font face="Tahoma">Drop the knife or I'll shoot.</font>

842
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:04,902
<font face="Tahoma">I don't think you will.</font>

843
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:08,819
<font face="Tahoma">You see. It works better when
you have the bullets inside the gun.</font>

844
00:43:10,445 --> 00:43:11,880
<font face="Tahoma">Oops.</font>

845
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:14,771
<font face="Tahoma">I guess that CIA training
isn't what it used to be.</font>

846
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,955
<font face="Tahoma">Guess you're right, asshole!</font>

847
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:24,254
<font face="Tahoma">No, no, no!</font>

848
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:30,954
<font face="Tahoma">Oh God.</font>

849
00:43:32,278 --> 00:43:35,174
<font face="Tahoma">Oh Susan, what did you do?</font>

850
00:43:39,018 --> 00:43:42,370
<font face="Tahoma">Oh God. Not on him.
Not on him!</font>

851
00:43:50,314 --> 00:43:53,767
<font face="Tahoma">Well. Rayna's people obviously
knew Ford was in Paris.</font>

852
00:43:53,792 --> 00:43:56,806
<font face="Tahoma">And getting footage of a CIA operative
setting off a bomb in a public</font>

853
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:59,324
<font face="Tahoma">could be a PR qoof
for any terrorist group.</font>

854
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:01,327
<font face="Tahoma">Do we have anything
on that woman he met?</font>

855
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,182
<font face="Tahoma">Facial recognition isn't showing anything.</font>

856
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,808
<font face="Tahoma">They were all over Ford.
Are you able to track him?</font>

857
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:08,783
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, God damn Ford is
still off the grid in Paris.</font>

858
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:12,241
<font face="Tahoma">I know, because he keeps trying
to hack into our system for Intel.</font>

859
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,658
<font face="Tahoma">He's like a dog that gets
loose from his yard. And just.</font>

860
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:16,876
<font face="Tahoma">keeps humping and shitting
his way through the neighborhood.</font>

861
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:17,972
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, here's a video.</font>

862
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:19,721
<font face="Tahoma">Make sure you got
everything on camera.</font>

863
00:44:19,746 --> 00:44:22,256
<font face="Tahoma">Phase out of the hotel
and go back after the attack.</font>

864
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:23,860
<font face="Tahoma">I'll take Renaldo to Rome.</font>

865
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:26,367
<font face="Tahoma">Renaldo. We have a record
of anyone with that name?</font>

866
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:27,622
<font face="Tahoma">Not that I'm aware of.</font>

867
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:30,955
<font face="Tahoma">Nicola.
Are you listening to me?</font>

868
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:35,420
<font face="Tahoma">- I was just testing the camera.
- Stop it. Find Ford.</font>

869
00:44:35,445 --> 00:44:39,652
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, Nancy. Can you pull up Fine's
POV cam from Boyanov's office. And.</font>

870
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,277
<font face="Tahoma">Look on the desk
there's some photos there</font>

871
00:44:41,302 --> 00:44:44,487
<font face="Tahoma">and see if you can find one
of him standing next to a car.</font>

872
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:53,503
<font face="Tahoma">Renaldo is a Rolls Royce.</font>

873
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:55,181
<font face="Tahoma">Hack into the Rolls tracking system.</font>

874
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:58,058
<font face="Tahoma">That car's a Wraith so is has a
Satellite Aided Transmission.</font>

875
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,708
<font face="Tahoma">And tap into Boyanov's feed</font>

876
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:03,175
<font face="Tahoma">His GPS should tell you exactly

<font face="Tahoma">I'm from the Midwest.
Where's Blue man group?"</font>

1022
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:22,039
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. I'm not an idiot, Ford!
You're an idiot!</font>

1023
00:52:22,064 --> 00:52:24,085
<font face="Tahoma">You should not be in this casino,
because De Luca here.</font>

1024
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,169
<font face="Tahoma">- And I need to get close to him.
- Yeah. How are you going to do that?</font>

1025
00:52:26,194 --> 00:52:27,523
<font face="Tahoma">How are you going
to do that, Cooper?</font>

1026
00:52:27,548 --> 00:52:30,013
<font face="Tahoma">What. You're going to seduce him?
That your big fucking plan?</font>

1027
00:52:30,038 --> 00:52:32,185
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah. What if it is?
Why is it so hard to believe?</font>

1028
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,421
<font face="Tahoma">Because you look like a flute
player in a wedding band.</font>

1029
00:52:34,446 --> 00:52:37,202
<font face="Tahoma">That's fucking why!
I'm here to take De Luca out.</font>

1030
00:52:37,227 --> 00:52:39,565
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, sounds romantic.
I hope you get lucky.</font>

1031
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,824
<font face="Tahoma">God damn it.
If I was trying to sound romantic,</font>

1032
00:52:41,849 --> 00:52:43,812
<font face="Tahoma">you would be on another floor,
soaking wet and breathless.</font>

1033
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:45,745
<font face="Tahoma">Wondering what came over you.
But I'm not!</font>

1034
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:47,037
<font face="Tahoma">So get the fuck out of my way.</font>

1035
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:49,258
<font face="Tahoma">I need you to rein it in, buddy.
Okay.</font>

1036
00:52:49,283 --> 00:52:51,396
<font face="Tahoma">If you take out De Luca,
we don't have a shot at getting Rayna.</font>

1037
00:52:51,421 --> 00:52:53,538
<font face="Tahoma">So take it down like 5000 notches.</font>

1038
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:56,159
<font face="Tahoma">- Take it down. That's how you get
   polonium 2000. In your drink
-Oh God.</font>

1039
00:52:56,184 --> 00:52:58,857
<font face="Tahoma">I got 18 months in intensive care
for radiation poisoning.</font>

1040
00:52:58,882 --> 00:53:02,636
<font face="Tahoma">I got 6 months without eyes,
While everyone I ever loved is gunned down.</font>

1041
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,278
<font face="Tahoma">Really. Everyone that you loved has been
gunned down, and just you survived.</font>

1042
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:08,671
<font face="Tahoma">Did you ever think that maybe
everybody you loved is not being killed,</font>

1043
00:53:08,696 --> 00:53:12,072
<font face="Tahoma">but they're killing themselves because
they can't stand to be around you.</font>

1044
00:53:12,097 --> 00:53:13,991
<font face="Tahoma">This shit is the real deal.
Life and death.</font>

1045
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:16,175
<font face="Tahoma">This, the field, is hell
a lot different than</font>

1046
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:18,569
<font face="Tahoma">sitting behind your fucking
monitor googling shit.</font>

1047
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:21,389
<font face="Tahoma">Stay away from me, Ford.
And do not let De Luca see you.</font>

1048
00:53:21,414 --> 00:53:24,153
<font face="Tahoma">And by the way, I can see your gun
sticking out of your back pocket.</font>

1049
00:53:24,193 --> 00:53:25,776
<font face="Tahoma">Unless you're so extreme,</font>

1050
00:53:25,801 --> 00:53:28,971
<font face="Tahoma">you got a second dick
coming out of your hip!</font>

1051
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:02,029
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, Konichiwa. (good afternoon)</font>

1052
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:03,819
<font face="Tahoma">- Ma'am,
- Yes yes.</font>

1053
00:54:03,844 --> 00:54:06,328
<font face="Tahoma">- Seats are reserved.
- Of course they are, yes.</font>

1054
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,832
<font face="Tahoma">I'm going to have to
ask you to wait outside.</font>

1055
00:54:08,857 --> 00:54:10,239
<font face="Tahoma">Yes, absolutely.</font>

1056
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:12,480
<font face="Tahoma">No?
Another door?</font>

1057
00:54:12,505 --> 00:54:14,792
<font face="Tahoma">I knew that.
Of course there's another door.</font>

1058
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:16,313
<font face="Tahoma">Probably happens all the time.</font>

1059
00:54:16,338 --> 00:54:18,507
<font face="Tahoma">- It's never happened before.
- Okay.</font>

1060
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,601
<font face="Tahoma">- Ma'am?
-Yes.</font>

1061
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:26,637
<font face="Tahoma">Ma'am, right here is okay.
No more exploring, please.</font>

1062
00:54:26,662 --> 00:54:29,008
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.
Lovely.</font>

1063
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:42,836
<font face="Tahoma">- Nancy?
- Susan?</font>

1064
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:44,541
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.
Hi.</font>

1065
00:54:44,566 --> 00:54:47,246
<font face="Tahoma">I found her. I found Rayna.
She's with De Luca.</font>

1066
00:54:47,271 --> 00:54:51,687
<font face="Tahoma">You did it.
Excellent trucking and reporting, madam.</font>

1067
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:08,985
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god. Somebody just
put something in her drink.</font>

1068
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,564
<font face="Tahoma">- What is it? Is it poison?
- I don't think it's a fiber supplement.</font>

1069
00:55:12,078 --> 00:55:13,944
<font face="Tahoma">She killed Fine, Nancy.</font>

1070
00:55:13,969 --> 00:55:15,649
<font face="Tahoma">I could really enjoyed just</font>

1071
00:55:15,674 --> 00:55:17,586
<font face="Tahoma">watching her die right now.</font>

1072
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,377
<font face="Tahoma">And she's the only one
who knows where the bomb is.</font>

1073
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:21,320
<font face="Tahoma">So Dudaev will never
get his hands on it.</font>

1074
00:55:21,345 --> 00:55:24,089
<font face="Tahoma">Oh god, Susan.
What're you going to do?</font>

1075
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:26,685
<font face="Tahoma">Excuse me, ma'am.</font>

1076
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:28,627
<font face="Tahoma">Ma'am, hi.
Do you speak English?</font>

1077
00:55:28,652 --> 00:55:32,384
<font face="Tahoma">Because I think somebody just
put a roofie in your cocktail.</font>

1078
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:34,888
<font face="Tahoma">- Are you sure it wasn't you?
- What?</font>

1079
00:55:34,913 --> 00:55:36,822
<font face="Tahoma">No.
God, I wouldn't-I wouldn't never.</font>

1080
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:38,527
<font face="Tahoma">Could you point the man out?</font>

1081
00:55:38,552 --> 00:55:41,304
<font face="Tahoma">Well, he just kind of
zipped out that door.</font>

1082
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:44,607
<font face="Tahoma">He's wearing a purple bow tie.</font>

1083
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,348
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you, Miss...?</font>

1084
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:54,044
<font face="Tahoma">Oh. Penny Morgan.</font>

1085
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,957
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, it's no trouble.
Really, I mean.</font>

1086
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:59,051
<font face="Tahoma">I think us ladies,
have to watch out for each other.</font>

1087
00:55:59,076 --> 00:56:01,326
<font face="Tahoma">I mean these kind of thing
happens all the time.</font>

1088
00:56:01,352 --> 00:56:04,245
<font face="Tahoma">And people often try to roofie... you?</font>

1089
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:08,030
<font face="Tahoma">Once, I asked someone for a Tylenol,
and they gave me a Tylenol PM.</font>

1090
00:56:08,055 --> 00:56:11,030
<font face="Tahoma">I'm not sure what
their intentions were. But.</font>

1091
00:56:14,312 --> 00:56:17,551
<font face="Tahoma">It seems they may have found him.
Would you come with me to identify him?</font>

1092
00:56:17,576 --> 00:56:19,887
<font face="Tahoma">Yes, of course.
I'm...</font>

1093
00:56:19,912 --> 00:56:21,858
<font face="Tahoma">happy to help.</font>

1094
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,405
<font face="Tahoma">Holy shit.</font>

1095
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,543
<font face="Tahoma">My friend here says she saw
you put something in my drink.</font>

1096
00:56:36,568 --> 00:56:38,370
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know any of you people.</font>

1097
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,092
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, I'm just in Rome on business.</font>

1098
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:42,403
<font face="Tahoma">I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.</font>

1099
00:56:42,428 --> 00:56:43,931
<font face="Tahoma">Perfect.</font>

1100
00:56:43,956 --> 00:56:45,873
<font face="Tahoma">Just in time for a night cap.</font>

1101
00:56:45,898 --> 00:56:49,690
<font face="Tahoma">- Apparently there's nothing wrong with it.
- I don't want your drink.</font>

1102
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:02,636
<font face="Tahoma">Fuck you, Rayna.</font>

1103
00:57:03,769 --> 00:57:06,560
<font face="Tahoma">Mmm.
Scrumptious.</font>

1104
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:09,532
<font face="Tahoma">So.
Jokes on you.</font>

1105
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:15,719
<font face="Tahoma">Fuck you.</font>

1106
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:19,155
<font face="Tahoma">Fuck you.</font>

1107
00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:43,511
<font face="Tahoma">How long was I out?</font>

1108
00:57:43,536 --> 00:57:45,385
<font face="Tahoma">You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.</font>

1109
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:48,565
<font face="Tahoma">- What happened?
- It was all a dream.</font>

1110
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,833
<font face="Tahoma">I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.</font>

1111
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:53,263
<font face="Tahoma">Sorry, that wasn't my fault.</font>

1112
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:58,051
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, thank you.
That's...</font>

1113
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:00,350
<font face="Tahoma">surprisingly polite.</font>

1114
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:01,832
<font face="Tahoma">Sorry about that.
I just...</font>

1115
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:04,187
<font face="Tahoma">I mean I've seen a lot of things
in my days.  I just never</font>

1116
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:06,786
<font face="Tahoma">I have never
seen that, exactly.</font>

1117
00:58:06,811 --> 00:58:08,071
<font face="Tahoma">Penny.</font>

1118
00:58:08,096 --> 00:58:11,848
<font face="Tahoma">Do you feel the need to tell
anybody about what you just saw?</font>

1119
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:16,320
<font face="Tahoma">Am I going to tell anybody?
You know that</font>

1120
00:58:16,345 --> 00:58:18,200
<font face="Tahoma">asshole got what he deserved.
I mean.</font>

1121
00:58:18,225 --> 00:58:20,732
<font face="Tahoma">I knew the second I saw him,
I thought.</font>

1122
00:58:20,757 --> 00:58:22,583
<font face="Tahoma">That guy doesn't deserve a throat.</font>

1123
00:58:22,608 --> 00:58:25,182
<font face="Tahoma">So.
Good on you.</font>

1124
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:29,108
<font face="Tahoma">I would like to take you to dinner,
to say thank you.</font>

1125
00:58:29,133 --> 00:58:31,145
<font face="Tahoma">And we must discuss
this hideous dress.</font>

1126
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,710
<font face="Tahoma">It's just hysterical.</font>

1127
00:58:32,735 --> 00:58:34,273
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, ha ha.
Good.</font>

1128
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:37,021
<font face="Tahoma">That's-
That's what I was hoping... for.</font>

1129
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,946
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.
And by the way!</font>

1130
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,319
<font face="Tahoma">Christo is suppose to be
looking after me at the bar</font>

1131
00:58:41,344 --> 00:58:44,892
<font face="Tahoma">making sure nobody would
put anything in my drinks.</font>

1132
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:50,802
<font face="Tahoma">Thought I give him a talking to.</font>

1133
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:53,621
<font face="Tahoma">Seems fair maybe
dock him a day's wage.</font>

1134
00:58:53,646 --> 00:58:56,686
<font face="Tahoma">Or shoot him in the head.
That always works.</font>

1135
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:59,553
<font face="Tahoma">- You know, Rome is quite amazing.
- Rome is the worst.</font>

1136
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,464
<font face="Tahoma">- Yes.
- So boring and tacky.</font>

1137
00:59:01,489 --> 00:59:05,132
<font face="Tahoma">I'm so glad one of us finally said it.
Eh-heh-heh</font>

1138
00:59:05,157 --> 00:59:08,197
<font face="Tahoma">- You have lipstick on your teeth.
- Really?</font>

1139
00:59:08,222 --> 00:59:10,023
<font face="Tahoma">Looks like you had
a box of crayons.</font>

1140
00:59:10,048 --> 00:59:11,653
<font face="Tahoma">Damn it.</font>

1141
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:13,852
<font face="Tahoma">Here we are.</font>

1142
00:59:13,877 --> 00:59:15,989
<font face="Tahoma">These should have been brought out
when we first sat down.</font>

1143
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,758
<font face="Tahoma">That's exactly what I was thinking.</font>

1144
00:59:17,783 --> 00:59:20,852
<font face="Tahoma">So far I'm riddled with
disappointed at the service.</font>

1145
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:24,392
<font face="Tahoma">So sorry. You know, ma'am.
I apologize.</font>

1146
00:59:26,995 --> 00:59:30,575
<font face="Tahoma">You know, I once saw someone
eat one of</font>

1147
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,013
<font face="Tahoma">these before</font>

1148
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,800
<font face="Tahoma">This is strange.</font>

1149
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:38,508
<font face="Tahoma">Do you always tear your
food up into little pieces?</font>

1150
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,520
<font face="Tahoma">You look like a squirrel.</font>

1151
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:43,941
<font face="Tahoma">I was just checking
 for the consistency</font>

1152
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,611
<font face="Tahoma">- Mm.
- You eat like a baby.</font>

1153
00:59:47,636 --> 00:59:48,738
<font face="Tahoma">Thank You.</font>

1154
00:59:48,763 --> 00:59:52,333
<font face="Tahoma">So, would you like to have
a look at the wine list?</font>

1155
00:59:52,358 --> 00:59:54,932
<font face="Tahoma">Yes.
Penny, you can order.</font>

1156
00:59:55,138 --> 00:59:59,157
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. Oh.
Passum.</font>

1157
00:59:59,182 --> 01:00:02,041
<font face="Tahoma">OK. I'm feeling-
I'm feeling a red</font>

1158
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:04,497
<font face="Tahoma">Kind of a red.
Like a lot of noise.</font>

1159
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:07,399
<font face="Tahoma">Like a little bit of
a-a barky finish.</font>

1160
01:00:07,424 --> 01:00:11,611
<font face="Tahoma">I tend to like a white, with the grid
of a hamus</font>

1161
01:00:11,636 --> 01:00:13,965
<font face="Tahoma">That’s, of course,
been thinned out.</font>

1162
01:00:13,997 --> 01:00:19,708
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, here. I will have the
 <i>Sapori e Delicia.</i></font>

1163
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:23,302
<font face="Tahoma">Right. That is the
name of this restaurant.</font>

1164
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:25,465
<font face="Tahoma">Yes, I'm aware of that.
So.</font>

1165
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,634
<font face="Tahoma">Why don't you surprise us
with something we don't know?</font>

1166
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,321
<font face="Tahoma">Like a delicious bottle of wine.</font>

1167
01:00:30,346 --> 01:00:33,226
<font face="Tahoma">Right, sorry.
I'll be back in 5 minutes, okay.</font>

1168
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:35,846
<font face="Tahoma">So hard to get good help
these days.</font>

1169
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:37,337
<font face="Tahoma">Don't you find that?</font>

1170
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:39,498
<font face="Tahoma">When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria</font>

1171
01:00:39,523 --> 01:00:41,144
<font face="Tahoma">which is the worse by the way.</font>

1172
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:44,249
<font face="Tahoma">Poor people everywhere and
cabbage is continuously cooking.</font>

1173
01:00:44,274 --> 01:00:47,164
<font face="Tahoma">There was this woman who
was kicked out of her house.</font>

1174
01:00:47,189 --> 01:00:48,775
<font face="Tahoma">And she lost all her money.</font>

1175
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,411
<font face="Tahoma">She couldn't even sell her body.</font>

1176
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:53,213
<font face="Tahoma">So she became a clown
on the streets.</font>

1177
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:55,587
<font face="Tahoma">She would performed all
her tricks standing in mud.</font>

1178
01:00:55,612 --> 01:00:58,515
<font face="Tahoma">And just cry and cry.</font>

1179
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,547
<font face="Tahoma">You remind me of this woman.</font>

1180
01:01:01,572 --> 01:01:02,889
<font face="Tahoma">Yo, thank you.</font>

1181
01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:05,790
<font face="Tahoma">Come on!
We're going to Budapest.</font>

1182
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:08,309
<font face="Tahoma">- Bu-Budapest?
- I have some business to finish there.</font>

1183
01:01:08,334 --> 01:01:10,436
<font face="Tahoma">And you can take my private jet
when we're done.</font>

1184
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:12,175
<font face="Tahoma">Anywhere you want to get home.</font>

1185
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,564
<font face="Tahoma">My way of repaying you
for saving my life.</font>

1186
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,474
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

1187
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:22,137
<font face="Tahoma">Is there a problem?</font>

1188
01:01:26,336 --> 01:01:29,333
<font face="Tahoma">No, not at all.
Let's go.</font>

1189
01:01:30,092 --> 01:01:32,940
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, what? What?
I'm just talking with the girl.</font>

1190
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:34,865
<font face="Tahoma">Okay okay.
Let's not make a scene.</font>

1191
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:38,870
<font face="Tahoma">You know what I need. Just get my room key
out and I'll grab a bag and pack my things.</font>

1192
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:40,959
<font face="Tahoma">It's Susan.
She's sending a code.</font>

1193
01:01:40,984 --> 01:01:43,574
<font face="Tahoma">- No, they can collect you back later.
- Shut</font>

1194
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,532
<font face="Tahoma">And if the rest of your
clothes are like that dress</font>

1195
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:46,176
<font face="Tahoma">down</font>

1196
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:48,537
<font face="Tahoma">I can send someone
to burn them for you.</font>

1197
01:01:48,562 --> 01:01:51,155
<font face="Tahoma">- the power.
- Quit a zinger.</font>

1198
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:55,237
<font face="Tahoma">Shut down the power
to the casino in Rome.</font>

1199
01:01:55,262 --> 01:01:56,767
<font face="Tahoma">What?</font>

1200
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,559
<font face="Tahoma">Well, shut the entire
bloody grid down then. Now!</font>

1201
01:01:59,584 --> 01:02:01,696
<font face="Tahoma">That would be great.</font>

1202
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:08,455
<font face="Tahoma">Everybody please remain calm.
Stay where you are.</font>

1203
01:02:15,327 --> 01:02:17,684
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, no!
What's happening?</font>

1204
01:02:25,932 --> 01:02:27,603
<font face="Tahoma">I have this.</font>

1205
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:30,940
<font face="Tahoma">What the fuck just happened?</font>

1206
01:02:32,362 --> 01:02:34,883
<font face="Tahoma">- God damn it.
- Oh my god. Rayna.</font>

1207
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,564
<font face="Tahoma">Thank god your hair
broke your fall.</font>

1208
01:02:36,603 --> 01:02:38,407
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know what happened.
The lights were going out.</font>

1209
01:02:38,432 --> 01:02:41,890
<font face="Tahoma">And I thought it was a robbery.
Two of your guys slammed into me.</font>

1210
01:02:41,915 --> 01:02:45,103
<font face="Tahoma">And took you down.
I think one of them touched my bottom.</font>

1211
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:46,692
<font face="Tahoma">Are they going to be okay?</font>

1212
01:02:46,717 --> 01:02:50,419
<font face="Tahoma">I wouldn't be worried about them.
Their fate has just been sealed.</font>

1213
01:02:51,958 --> 01:02:55,293
<font face="Tahoma">Sorry, oh.
I'll let you go. Let you go.</font>

1214
01:02:55,318 --> 01:02:57,123
<font face="Tahoma">Shame on you!</font>

1215
01:03:04,536 --> 01:03:05,673
<font face="Tahoma">Wow!</font>

1216
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,827
<font face="Tahoma">This is a really jetsy plane.</font>

1217
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,355
<font face="Tahoma">Is this yours?</font>

1218
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:12,510
<font face="Tahoma">- It is my father's.
- Oh.</font>

1219
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:14,376
<font face="Tahoma">You've never been
on a private jet before?</font>

1220
01:03:14,401 --> 01:03:15,689
<font face="Tahoma">Oh no.</font>

1221
01:03:15,714 --> 01:03:20,953
<font face="Tahoma">I did get upgraded to premium
economy once, which was pretty plush.</font>

1222
01:03:20,978 --> 01:03:23,287
<font face="Tahoma">Premium economy.</font>

1223
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:25,084
<font face="Tahoma">Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.</font>

1224
01:03:25,109 --> 01:03:29,740
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, probably.
But it was not quite like this.</font>

1225
01:03:29,801 --> 01:03:31,772
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

1226
01:03:31,803 --> 01:03:33,996
<font face="Tahoma">Why are you being
so nice to me?</font>

1227
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:37,443
<font face="Tahoma">Can't just be because I remind
you of some sad Bulgarian clown.</font>

1228
01:03:37,468 --> 01:03:39,576
<font face="Tahoma">You remind me of my mother.</font>

1229
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:41,322
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.</font>

1230
01:03:41,362 --> 01:03:43,857
<font face="Tahoma">Really? You know that...
I mean, you and I are.</font>

1231
01:03:43,882 --> 01:03:46,078
<font face="Tahoma">You know, pretty close in age.</font>

1232
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:48,957
<font face="Tahoma">You're funny.
It's the Bulgarian clown in you.</font>

1233
01:03:48,982 --> 01:03:50,696
<font face="Tahoma">- Okay.
- She was marvelous.</font>

1234
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:54,472
<font face="Tahoma">But she was different.
Eccentric, like you are.</font>

1235
01:03:54,978 --> 01:03:57,643
<font face="Tahoma">The moment I saw you standing
there in that abortion of a dress</font>

1236
01:03:57,668 --> 01:04:00,134
<font face="Tahoma">- Oh, come on.
- It's as if to say</font>

1237
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,632
<font face="Tahoma">This is what I got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine.</font>

1238
01:04:04,443 --> 01:04:07,546
<font face="Tahoma">- This was her.
- Oh, wow!</font>

1239
01:04:07,571 --> 01:04:10,398
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, how did you get that picture of me?
I look amazing.</font>

1240
01:04:10,423 --> 01:04:12,585
<font face="Tahoma">Hello doppelganger.</font>

1241
01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:14,735
<font face="Tahoma">She was the only person
I could ever trust.</font>

1242
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,917
<font face="Tahoma">- Well. Here's to your mom.
- To my mother.</font>

1243
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:21,181
<font face="Tahoma">- And to you.
- And here's to you.</font>

1244
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:24,157
<font face="Tahoma">You may never be
as wise as an owl,</font>

1245
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:26,624
<font face="Tahoma">but you'll always be
a hoot to me.</font>

1246
01:04:26,649 --> 01:04:29,333
<font face="Tahoma">What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.</font>

1247
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:32,106
<font face="Tahoma">- You're delightful.
- As are you.</font>

1248
01:04:34,574 --> 01:04:38,328
<font face="Tahoma">Now.
Where did you say we're headed?</font>

1249
01:04:41,751 --> 01:04:43,480
<font face="Tahoma">Headed</font>

1250
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:46,089
<font face="Tahoma">Where did you say we're...</font>

1251
01:04:46,114 --> 01:04:47,517
<font face="Tahoma">Oh God.</font>

1252
01:04:47,542 --> 01:04:49,456
<font face="Tahoma">If you ever feel like
you've been poisoned</font>

1253
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:52,591
<font face="Tahoma">Chew one of these.
Chew one of these.</font>

1254
01:05:07,131 --> 01:05:08,570
<font face="Tahoma">What happened?</font>

1255
01:05:08,595 --> 01:05:11,619
<font face="Tahoma">I've never seen somebody
dive for stool softener before.</font>

1256
01:05:11,644 --> 01:05:13,797
<font face="Tahoma">That's one thing that happened.</font>

1257
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:17,134
<font face="Tahoma">What did you do?
Did you drug me?</font>

1258
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:20,137
<font face="Tahoma">Of course I did.
I told you, I can't trust anybody.</font>

1259
01:05:20,162 --> 01:05:22,346
<font face="Tahoma">I had to look through
your things. Anyway.</font>

1260
01:05:22,371 --> 01:05:25,920
<font face="Tahoma">Tell me. Are you hemorrhoids
particularly large or just tenacious?</font>

1261
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:27,535
<font face="Tahoma">Stop texting!</font>

1262
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,286
<font face="Tahoma">I'm not texting
if you must know.</font>

1263
01:05:29,311 --> 01:05:31,984
<font face="Tahoma">I'm playing Candy Crash.
And I just made level 95.</font>

1264
01:05:32,009 --> 01:05:34,617
<font face="Tahoma">God, that is so rude.</font>

1265
01:05:36,973 --> 01:05:38,769
<font face="Tahoma">Jesus, Colin,
What the fuck are you doing?</font>

1266
01:05:38,794 --> 01:05:41,518
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry, Rayna but there's
been a change of plans.</font>

1267
01:05:41,543 --> 01:05:42,719
<font face="Tahoma">Who paid you off, Colin?</font>

1268
01:05:42,744 --> 01:05:46,301
<font face="Tahoma">Colin hasn't worked here for like 8 months.
I'm Frederick.</font>

1269
01:05:46,326 --> 01:05:48,977
<font face="Tahoma">Is that why you are doing this? Because
I didn't remember your fucking name?</font>

1270
01:05:49,002 --> 01:05:52,029
<font face="Tahoma">Let's just say there are people who
really want what you're selling.</font>

1271
01:05:52,054 --> 01:05:53,592
<font face="Tahoma">You don't have to do this.</font>

1272
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,811
<font face="Tahoma">I can give you a very
comfortable life. Col...</font>

1273
01:05:56,836 --> 01:05:58,774
<font face="Tahoma">- Mmm.
- You forgot my name again, didn't you?</font>

1274
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,149
<font face="Tahoma">- No. No, I didn't.
- Yeah.</font>

1275
01:06:00,174 --> 01:06:01,772
<font face="Tahoma">It's...
Hmm.</font>

1276
01:06:01,797 --> 01:06:03,539
<font face="Tahoma">Don't say fucking Colin.</font>

1277
01:06:03,564 --> 01:06:07,310
<font face="Tahoma">Fuck. I don't give a shit what your
name is. You're the fucking help.</font>

1278
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:08,788
<font face="Tahoma">Nice try, Colin.</font>

1279
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:10,437
<font face="Tahoma">But Stan and I already se...</font>

1280
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:13,284
<font face="Tahoma">It's Frederick!
Frederick!</font>

1281
01:06:15,826 --> 01:06:17,988
<font face="Tahoma">Sorry lady. But they
only paid me for one...</font>

1282
01:06:18,013 --> 01:06:19,318
<font face="Tahoma">Aw!</font>

1283
01:06:25,203 --> 01:06:27,693
<font face="Tahoma">Wha!
Come on!</font>

1284
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,061
<font face="Tahoma">Rayna, go to the cockpit
and level us out!</font>

1285
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:34,212
<font face="Tahoma">Like I know how to fly
a fucking aeroplane!</font>

1286
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:37,610
<font face="Tahoma">This was weird.</font>

1287
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:44,601
<font face="Tahoma">Blow that thing
all you want, lady.</font>

1288
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,234
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.
Why don't you blow me, Colin.</font>

1289
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:50,541
<font face="Tahoma">Aww.
It's Frederick.</font>

1290
01:07:13,709 --> 01:07:15,954
<font face="Tahoma">Ewk.
Eww.</font>

1291
01:07:30,617 --> 01:07:32,859
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.
For fuck sake.</font>

1292
01:07:32,884 --> 01:07:35,918
<font face="Tahoma">I got it.
I know what to do.</font>

1293
01:07:38,242 --> 01:07:40,096
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, are you okay?</font>

1294
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:42,679
<font face="Tahoma">No! I got a dead
man's head up in my ass!</font>

1295
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:45,879
<font face="Tahoma">This one's for Fine.
Down draft!</font>

1296
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:50,765
<font face="Tahoma">Not again! Do you have any idea
what you are fucking doing!</font>

1297
01:07:51,061 --> 01:07:54,292
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.
The controls are so sensitive.</font>

1298
01:07:54,317 --> 01:07:58,321
<font face="Tahoma">God. One of these dead fuckers
just shit his pants.</font>

1299
01:07:58,412 --> 01:08:00,572
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, wait a minute.</font>

1300
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:03,515
<font face="Tahoma">I got it.
I think I got, okay.</font>

1301
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:05,114
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

1302
01:08:07,497 --> 01:08:11,204
<font face="Tahoma">Good thing I learned to use
that Flight Simulator app, huh.</font>

1303
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,790
<font face="Tahoma">Congratulations
Penny Morgan.</font>

1304

1314
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:46,775
<font face="Tahoma">I'm a private bodyguard, and your
father hired me to protect you.</font>

Without me.</font>

1317
01:08:51,742 --> 01:08:54,116

crashed in the Alps right now.</font>

1318
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:56,603
<font face="Tahoma">Or you'll be laying in the morgue
with a hole burned in your throat.</font>

1319
01:08:56,628 --> 01:08:58,957
<font face="Tahoma">You little spoiled piece of shit!</font>

1320
01:08:58,982 --> 01:09:02,865
<font face="Tahoma">Why would my father
hired somebody like you?</font>

1321
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:04,989
<font face="Tahoma">Because he trusted me.</font>

1322
01:09:05,014 --> 01:09:08,089
<font face="Tahoma">And for whatever fucking reason,
he loved you.</font>

1323
01:09:08,114 --> 01:09:10,494

I'm watching you.</font>

anything like that fucking beast!</font>

1327
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:25,479
<font face="Tahoma">No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.</font>

1328
01:09:25,504 --> 01:09:29,672

Everything you said is a lie.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Oh, what happened?</font>

1331
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,484
<font face="Tahoma">Did I hit a little sore spot?</font>

1332
01:09:35,513 --> 01:09:38,768
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah. He always wanted a son,
and you knew it.</font>

1333
01:09:38,873 --> 01:09:40,987
<font face="Tahoma">Look. He wanted you to
take over the business.</font>

1334
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:43,419
<font face="Tahoma">He's just afraid
you'll get yourself killed.</font>

1335
01:09:43,444 --> 01:09:46,079
<font face="Tahoma">So, if you want to live and
you want to load that bomb,</font>

1336

1337
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:49,969

1340
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,749
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, bodyguard.</font>

1341
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:04,768
<font face="Tahoma">But if I find out you're lying
to me about of any of this,</font>

01:10:04,793 --> 01:10:08,277
<font face="Tahoma">I'll show you ways to die
you've never even dreamed of.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Hey I don't know why you
get to pick your identity.</font>

1427
01:14:12,521 --> 01:14:14,034
<font face="Tahoma">I had to go with
the freaking cat lady.</font>

1443
01:14:43,127 --> 01:14:45,386
<font face="Tahoma">- You Swedish bitch!

1444
01:14:45,411 --> 01:14:47,768
<font face="Tahoma">You gonna cry?
You little Swiss fucking pussy.</font>

1445
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:49,537
<font face="Tahoma">- I'm not going to cry.
- You're crying now!</font>

1446
01:14:49,562 --> 01:14:53,072
<font face="Tahoma">I'm not.
It's so fucking hot.</font>

1447
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:57,215
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. You know. Just let's leave
Anton alone for now, please.</font>

1448
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:58,745
<font face="Tahoma">What's your name?</font>

1449
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,556
<font face="Tahoma">- Susan Cooper.
- What?</font>

1450
01:15:00,581 --> 01:15:03,318
<font face="Tahoma">- Oh, sorry. It came out.
- What did I just...</font>

1451
01:15:03,343 --> 01:15:04,994
<font face="Tahoma">Not suppose to fucking
say her real name.</font>

1452
01:15:05,019 --> 01:15:06,954
<font face="Tahoma">She's one of my best.
She's highly fucking skill.</font>

1453
01:15:06,979 --> 01:15:08,459
<font face="Tahoma">- Very skill.
- At what?</font>

1454
01:15:08,484 --> 01:15:10,678
<font face="Tahoma">Getting things out of
a higher cupboard?</font>

1455
01:15:11,457 --> 01:15:14,682
<font face="Tahoma">That's-That's very good.
Because I'm tall?</font>

1456
01:15:14,707 --> 01:15:16,954
<font face="Tahoma">Really, I'm not very good
at reaching high things.</font>

1457
01:15:16,993 --> 01:15:19,674
<font face="Tahoma">A doctor once said to me that
I had the muscles capacity of an infant.</font>

1458
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:22,212
<font face="Tahoma">- My arms are like 2 noodles...
- Get down!</font>

1459
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:33,586
<font face="Tahoma">Susan, get Rayna to safety.
Now!</font>

1460
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:35,684
<font face="Tahoma">- I've got her.
- Go!</font>

1461
01:15:39,711 --> 01:15:41,313
<font face="Tahoma">Go away!</font>

1462
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:51,293
<font face="Tahoma">Who puts a roof on a scooter!
What are you, the pope?</font>

1463
01:16:04,076 --> 01:16:06,277
<font face="Tahoma">Get out of the way!</font>

1464
01:16:12,849 --> 01:16:15,253
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god!</font>

1465
01:16:21,266 --> 01:16:24,428
<font face="Tahoma">They're driving crazy,
I can't keep up with them.</font>

1466
01:16:26,338 --> 01:16:28,101
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, wait a minute.</font>

1467
01:16:29,825 --> 01:16:31,409
<font face="Tahoma">I got it.</font>

1468
01:16:31,811 --> 01:16:34,164
<font face="Tahoma">Alright.
A little detour.</font>

1469
01:16:40,982 --> 01:16:43,951
<font face="Tahoma">Oh god.
Let's do this.</font>

1470
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:53,433
<font face="Tahoma">I am so bad ass!</font>

1471
01:16:56,877 --> 01:16:59,610
<font face="Tahoma">Got it.
I know what you're saying.</font>

1472
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:03,444
<font face="Tahoma">Do your project now!
Just get to work!</font>

1473
01:17:05,618 --> 01:17:09,059
<font face="Tahoma">Where are we going?
Smells like cheese over here!</font>

1474
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:10,887
<font face="Tahoma">Stick with me,
you'll be safe.</font>

1475
01:17:10,912 --> 01:17:14,501
<font face="Tahoma">Crawl with me. I must protect you.
Crawl with me.</font>

1476
01:17:14,531 --> 01:17:16,772
<font face="Tahoma">Fucking ridiculous clown show.</font>

1477
01:17:16,797 --> 01:17:19,300
<font face="Tahoma">This fuckery stops now.</font>

1478
01:17:39,661 --> 01:17:42,671
<font face="Tahoma">- Excuse me. Do you know if there is a
Popeyes Chicken around here?
 - What?</font>

1479
01:17:42,696 --> 01:17:46,471
<font face="Tahoma">I saw a KFC down the way,
but I'm more of a Popeyes guy.</font>

1480
01:17:47,501 --> 01:17:50,808
<font face="Tahoma">The food is really weird I...
Oh my God, I'll ask someone else!</font>

1481
01:18:06,262 --> 01:18:08,492
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, enough!</font>

1482
01:18:19,103 --> 01:18:20,920
<font face="Tahoma">Drop your weapon!</font>

1483
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,877
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god. Karen.
Why aren't you at Capri?</font>

1484
01:18:24,902 --> 01:18:27,308
<font face="Tahoma">I'm so sorry I shot you.</font>

1485
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:30,423
<font face="Tahoma">You must have not known
it was me either.  I changed my hair.</font>

1486
01:18:30,448 --> 01:18:33,964
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, yeah. Looks really good.
Are those extensions?</font>

1487
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:36,611
<font face="Tahoma">No.
It's just-It's just my hair.</font>

1488
01:18:36,636 --> 01:18:39,698
<font face="Tahoma">- You know, a few clips, colored.
- Okay, if you say so.</font>

1489
01:18:39,727 --> 01:18:42,895
<font face="Tahoma">I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry about this too.</font>

1490
01:18:48,581 --> 01:18:50,331
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, my God.</font>

1491
01:18:53,536 --> 01:18:55,659
<font face="Tahoma">No no no...</font>

1492
01:18:55,684 --> 01:18:58,839
<font face="Tahoma">Susan, my thighs are on fire.</font>

1493
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:00,805
<font face="Tahoma">I don't care.
Where is Rayna?</font>

1494
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,239
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know. She slipped off me,
I was very sweaty.</font>

1495
01:19:03,264 --> 01:19:04,730
<font face="Tahoma">- Karen Walker is dead.
- What?</font>

1496
01:19:04,755 --> 01:19:05,886
<font face="Tahoma">She's a double agent.</font>

1497
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:07,867
<font face="Tahoma">Somebody shot her right in front of me.
I don't know who did it.</font>

1498
01:19:07,892 --> 01:19:09,595
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know how deep
this whole thing goes.</font>

1499
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,421
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my God.
Oh!</font>

1500
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:12,833

01:19:16,354 --> 01:19:17,799
<font face="Tahoma">Now!</font>

1503
01:19:17,824 --> 01:19:19,021
<font face="Tahoma">Shit!</font>

1504
01:19:19,064 --> 01:19:21,748
<font face="Tahoma">People are trying to kill me, and all
that's left of my fucking security team</font>

1505
01:19:21,773 --> 01:19:26,517
<font face="Tahoma">is you two defending me! You look like
somebody's demented aunts on vacation!</font>

1506
01:19:28,150 --> 01:19:32,244
<font face="Tahoma">Do you have anyone on your team,
other than this asthmatic Big bird?</font>

1507
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:34,307
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.
We usually just use her for</font>

1508
01:19:34,332 --> 01:19:36,682
<font face="Tahoma">non-physical security resources.</font>

1509
01:19:36,716 --> 01:19:38,768
<font face="Tahoma">I'm very non-physical resourceful.</font>

1510
01:19:38,793 --> 01:19:42,397
<font face="Tahoma">I do a lot of reading.
I read palms and maps.</font>

1511
01:19:42,422 --> 01:19:44,221
<font face="Tahoma">And I read all of
"The Hunger Games".</font>

1512
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:45,903
<font face="Tahoma">How is that helpful!</font>

1513
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,367
<font face="Tahoma">I don't know,
I'm panicking.</font>

1514
01:19:47,392 --> 01:19:51,355
<font face="Tahoma">And you! You have to stop with
this stupid Penny Morgan outfit.</font>

1515
01:19:51,385 --> 01:19:54,279
<font face="Tahoma">You have to dress like
an actual human!</font>

1516
01:19:54,304 --> 01:19:58,202
<font face="Tahoma">Get me more security when I come
back out here, or you're both dead!</font>

1517
01:20:05,081 --> 01:20:06,719
<font face="Tahoma">Suck on this, Rayna.</font>

1518
01:20:06,744 --> 01:20:08,802
<font face="Tahoma">This mission is going to cost you,

1519
01:20:08,827 --> 01:20:11,005
<font face="Tahoma">The clothing allowance cut off
half way through the last...</font>

1521
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:16,737
<font face="Tahoma">- God damn me! Please.
- Alright. Alright.</font>

1522
01:20:16,762 --> 01:20:21,057
<font face="Tahoma">Crappy.
I've already contacted the agency.</font>

1523

<font face="Tahoma">Oh.
Come on!</font>

1524
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:26,745
<font face="Tahoma">You, in this outfit.</font>

01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:29,156
<font face="Tahoma">Magnifico.
(Magnificent)</font>

1526
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:48,198
<font face="Tahoma">- You have anything yet?
- No one so far, Susan.</font>

1527
01:20:48,223 --> 01:20:50,495
<font face="Tahoma">Slight intimidating crowd, however.</font>

1528

You look nice.</font>

Looks fade.</font>

1530
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,914
<font face="Tahoma">Just keep your eyes open.</font>

1531
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:03,525
<font face="Tahoma">God damn it.
I told you to dress up.</font>

1532
01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:06,189
<font face="Tahoma">And take off those gloves.
You look like Darth fucking Vader.</font>

1533
01:21:06,213 --> 01:21:08,394
<font face="Tahoma">You know the reason I'm wearing these
gloves is because I don't know what kind</font>

Keep a eye out for this woman.</font>

1537

I may need your help out there.</font>

1540
01:21:24,136 --> 01:21:28,030
<font face="Tahoma">To close my eyes in the presence of

1542
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:33,653

Yeah.</font>

1547
01:21:50,063 --> 01:21:52,654
<font face="Tahoma">I didn't mean to hit her that hard.
God. You look like a balloon animal.</font>

1552
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:04,830
<font face="Tahoma">It's play time on your face
with your stupid mustache.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, who's dominating now?</font>

1558
01:22:13,683 --> 01:22:16,024
<font face="Tahoma">You're putting this entire
operation in danger.</font>

1559

<font face="Tahoma">Your girlfriend, from the Paris bombing,
is on her way here to meet Rayna.</font>

1560
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:22,083
<font face="Tahoma">If she sees you, only my cover's blown.
And then we're both dead.</font>

1561
01:22:22,108 --> 01:22:23,659
<font face="Tahoma">Just worry about yourself, Cooper.</font>

1562
01:22:23,684 --> 01:22:27,401
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you for the beautiful ladies.
You guys okay?</font>

1563
01:22:27,426 --> 01:22:28,910
<font face="Tahoma">Let's welcome</font>

<font face="Tahoma">What's up Budapest.</font>

1566
01:22:44,144 --> 01:22:47,108
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, shit.
She's here.</font>

1567
01:22:47,421 --> 01:22:49,153
<font face="Tahoma">Okay. We can't let Rayna see her.</font>

1568
01:22:49,178 --> 01:22:51,649
<font face="Tahoma">So, you need to take out her
bodyguards, and I'll deal with her.</font>

1569
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:55,081
<font face="Tahoma">- Hey. Nobody orders me around.
- God. Do you have a better idea?</font>

1570
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:57,162
<font face="Tahoma">We'll release
a gas in the club</font>

1571
01:22:57,187 --> 01:22:59,532
<font face="Tahoma">causing everybody to get
temporary amnesia.</font>

1572
01:22:59,557 --> 01:23:01,041

1573
01:23:01,066 --> 01:23:03,612
<font face="Tahoma">Just go!
Just go!</font>

1574
01:23:04,544 --> 01:23:07,195
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy, I need you
to get in here now!</font>

1575
01:23:07,757 --> 01:23:09,370
<font face="Tahoma">I'm coming, Susan.
I'm here, I'm here.</font>

1576
01:23:09,395 --> 01:23:11,200

Create a diversion, now!</font>

1581
01:23:22,191 --> 01:23:24,960
<font face="Tahoma">- What kind of diversion?
- A big one.</font>

1582
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:32,690
<font face="Tahoma">50, I love you!</font>

1583
01:23:34,729 --> 01:23:37,099
<font face="Tahoma">50, I love you!
Kiss me.</font>

1584
01:23:37,124 --> 01:23:39,260
<font face="Tahoma">- Get her!
- Take me now!</font>

1585
01:23:43,006 --> 01:23:44,606
<font face="Tahoma">Turn around.</font>

1586
01:23:45,105 --> 01:23:47,386
<font face="Tahoma">- Get off!
- I'm coming in.</font>

1587
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:49,306
<font face="Tahoma">Nancy, I got her.
Meet me outside.</font>

1588
01:23:49,347 --> 01:23:52,699
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, great. No, I'm fine now.
Thank you so much. Okay.</font>

1589
01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:54,416
<font face="Tahoma">Now I got my wish.
And that was it.</font>

1590
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:57,986
<font face="Tahoma">For a hob, now I got to drop
Michael Bublé in Croatia. He wants me.</font>

1591
01:23:58,011 --> 01:23:59,924
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, Cooper.
I got this under control.</font>

1592
01:23:59,963 --> 01:24:02,044
<font face="Tahoma">You're coming with me.</font>

1593
01:24:06,428 --> 01:24:07,928
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.
Susan!</font>

1594
01:24:07,953 --> 01:24:11,495
<font face="Tahoma">Okay, bigger diversion!
Huge diversion!</font>

1595
01:24:15,243 --> 01:24:16,843
<font face="Tahoma">Bitch!</font>

1596
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:24,319
<font face="Tahoma">I got to know who she's working for.
Get Rayna out of here.</font>

1597
01:24:32,002 --> 01:24:34,178
<font face="Tahoma">That's not fair!</font>

1598
01:24:34,423 --> 01:24:36,939
<font face="Tahoma">Whoa-whoa-whoa...</font>

1599
01:24:40,078 --> 01:24:42,034
<font face="Tahoma">God damn it!</font>

1600
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:46,052
<font face="Tahoma">- Nancy, where are you?
- A bit indispose.</font>

1601
01:24:46,077 --> 01:24:49,449
<font face="Tahoma">It turns out 50 Cent doesn't have
a great sense of humor or irony.</font>

1602
01:24:49,474 --> 01:24:53,181
<font face="Tahoma">I need backup!
I lost my gun in the club!</font>

1603
01:25:18,094 --> 01:25:19,371
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.</font>

1604
01:25:24,372 --> 01:25:27,228
<font face="Tahoma">Aw! Why did I get
rid of my gloves?</font>

1605
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:37,380
<font face="Tahoma">Ah!</font>

1606
01:25:44,082 --> 01:25:45,331
<font face="Tahoma">AW!</font>

1607
01:25:45,356 --> 01:25:47,086
<font face="Tahoma">Ah-ha-ha...</font>

1608
01:25:50,064 --> 01:25:52,544
<font face="Tahoma">Aw!
Motherbuttler!</font>

1609
01:26:03,204 --> 01:26:05,793
<font face="Tahoma">You got a lot of rage
in that jumpsuit.</font>

1610
01:26:43,835 --> 01:26:45,960
<font face="Tahoma">- Get up!
- Aw.</font>

1611
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:52,492
<font face="Tahoma">You are under arrest by Susan Cooper
and the government of the United States.</font>

1612
01:27:01,829 --> 01:27:03,649
<font face="Tahoma">Rayna, how did you do that?</font>

1613
01:27:03,674 --> 01:27:05,165
<font face="Tahoma">I didn’t.</font>

1614
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:07,037
<font face="Tahoma">He did.</font>

1615
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:15,430
<font face="Tahoma">Hello, Coop.</font>

1616
01:27:18,637 --> 01:27:20,427
<font face="Tahoma">Fine.
Aw.</font>

1617
01:27:20,572 --> 01:27:22,127
<font face="Tahoma">Hey.</font>

1618
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:24,468
<font face="Tahoma">Coop.</font>

1619
01:27:36,777 --> 01:27:38,699
<font face="Tahoma">Wake up!</font>

1620
01:27:38,824 --> 01:27:40,948
<font face="Tahoma">Did you have a nice nap?</font>

1621
01:27:40,973 --> 01:27:42,420
<font face="Tahoma">You were snoring very loudly.</font>

1622
01:27:42,445 --> 01:27:45,752
<font face="Tahoma">Well, this is really not the
most upsetting news right now.</font>

1623
01:27:45,777 --> 01:27:47,652
<font face="Tahoma">My father used to
bring people here.</font>

1624
01:27:47,677 --> 01:27:50,888
<font face="Tahoma">Did he also make you dressed
like a slutty dolphin trainer?</font>

1625
01:27:50,913 --> 01:27:54,012
<font face="Tahoma">He starved them, tortured them.</font>

1626
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:55,484
<font face="Tahoma">You name it.</font>

1627
01:27:55,509 --> 01:27:59,270
<font face="Tahoma">But he especially didn't like it
when people lied to him.</font>

1628
01:27:59,295 --> 01:28:00,978
<font face="Tahoma">Not that I bought it.</font>

1629
01:28:01,003 --> 01:28:02,811
<font face="Tahoma">- You knew?
- Of course I knew.</font>

1630
01:28:02,836 --> 01:28:05,536
<font face="Tahoma">I told you you were better
off in the basement, Coop.</font>

1631
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:08,954
<font face="Tahoma">- You could have avoided all of this.
- And what, Fine?</font>

1632
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:12,129
<font face="Tahoma">Now you're a nuclear black marketer?
A terrorist?</font>

1633
01:28:12,154 --> 01:28:13,759
<font face="Tahoma">No.</font>

1634
01:28:14,457 --> 01:28:16,975
<font face="Tahoma">He's just fucking me.</font>

1635
01:28:24,052 --> 01:28:26,021
<font face="Tahoma">You're a loud kisser.</font>

1636
01:28:26,046 --> 01:28:28,036
<font face="Tahoma">- Excuse me?
- You're a loud kisser.</font>

1637
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:30,299
<font face="Tahoma">And it's gross and unappealing.</font>

1638
01:28:30,324 --> 01:28:32,071
<font face="Tahoma">You look like some
 old toothless woman</font>

1639
01:28:32,096 --> 01:28:34,714
<font face="Tahoma">sucking the jelly out of a donut.</font>

1640
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:37,867
<font face="Tahoma">Hey. How's it like sleeping with
the man who killed your father?</font>

1641
01:28:37,892 --> 01:28:39,979
<font face="Tahoma">Nice try Coop.</font>

1642
01:28:40,299 --> 01:28:44,673
<font face="Tahoma">- She already know it was Cress.
- Ah. Okay.</font>

1643
01:28:44,698 --> 01:28:48,551
<font face="Tahoma">You probably always been in love
with him, haven't you?</font>

1644
01:28:48,576 --> 01:28:50,432
<font face="Tahoma">Talking in his ear,</font>

1645
01:28:50,457 --> 01:28:54,759
<font face="Tahoma">hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.</font>

1646
01:28:55,183 --> 01:28:57,903
<font face="Tahoma">Poor little pathetic Susan Coleman.</font>

1647
01:28:57,936 --> 01:29:01,142
<font face="Tahoma">Reminisce my last name so truly
not much of a burden, is it?</font>

1648
01:29:01,167 --> 01:29:03,326
<font face="Tahoma">- Coppin.
- No.</font>

1649
01:29:03,351 --> 01:29:04,542
<font face="Tahoma">Cropon?</font>

1650
01:29:04,567 --> 01:29:07,949
<font face="Tahoma">Are you-Are you thinking Groupon?
No, my name is not Groupon.</font>

1651
01:29:07,974 --> 01:29:09,872
<font face="Tahoma">Croop?
Keep going.</font>

1652
01:29:09,897 --> 01:29:12,428
<font face="Tahoma">- Kapalski.
- It's getting further from it.</font>

1653
01:29:12,453 --> 01:29:14,584
<font face="Tahoma">Well.
Whatever the fuck it is,</font>

1654
01:29:14,609 --> 01:29:16,314
<font face="Tahoma">Let's just call it Dead!</font>

1655
01:29:16,339 --> 01:29:18,552
<font face="Tahoma">Hey, baby. I thought we were
gonna hang on to her till tonight?</font>

1656
01:29:18,577 --> 01:29:20,782
<font face="Tahoma">I changed my mind!</font>

1657
01:29:23,514 --> 01:29:25,114
<font face="Tahoma">Goodbye.</font>

1658
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:31,972
<font face="Tahoma">Like I waste a bullet on you.</font>

1659
01:29:32,966 --> 01:29:34,971
<font face="Tahoma">Put her in the room.</font>

1660
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:41,064
<font face="Tahoma">Aw.</font>

1661
01:29:43,569 --> 01:29:44,952
<font face="Tahoma">Eah!</font>

1662
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,528
<font face="Tahoma">Hey Aldo.</font>

1663
01:29:54,782 --> 01:29:57,083
<font face="Tahoma">Hello captured lady.</font>

1664
01:29:57,108 --> 01:29:58,979
<font face="Tahoma">I failed.</font>

1665
01:29:59,752 --> 01:30:01,856
<font face="Tahoma">I failed the mission.</font>

1666
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:03,891
<font face="Tahoma">Fine's alive and</font>

1667
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:05,792
<font face="Tahoma">he's a traitor.</font>

1668
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,115
<font face="Tahoma">Don't be downhearted.</font>

1669
01:30:08,824 --> 01:30:11,672
<font face="Tahoma">My mama,
said to me.</font>

1670
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:12,925
<font face="Tahoma">Aldo,</font>

1671
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:14,266
<font face="Tahoma">life is</font>

1672
01:30:14,291 --> 01:30:16,328
<font face="Tahoma">full of sorrow</font>

1673
01:30:16,353 --> 01:30:19,054
<font face="Tahoma">and surprises.</font>

1674
01:30:19,205 --> 01:30:21,087
<font face="Tahoma">But a</font>

1675
01:30:21,112 --> 01:30:23,294
<font face="Tahoma">magnificent</font>

1676
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:25,838
<font face="Tahoma">pair of bosoms</font>

1677
01:30:26,224 --> 01:30:27,829
<font face="Tahoma">will...</font>

1678
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:33,147
<font face="Tahoma">Good story.</font>

1679
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:46,988
<font face="Tahoma">- Susan.
- Get away from me.</font>

1680
01:30:47,013 --> 01:30:49,458
<font face="Tahoma">No, listen.
I haven't got much time.</font>

1681
01:30:49,483 --> 01:30:51,034
<font face="Tahoma">Why did you do it, Fine?</font>

1682
01:30:51,059 --> 01:30:53,366
<font face="Tahoma">This was my only way in.</font>

1683
01:30:53,391 --> 01:30:56,425
<font face="Tahoma">I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.</font>

1684
01:30:56,450 --> 01:31:00,445
<font face="Tahoma">I jammed the signal.
Popped out my lens. It was easy.</font>

1685
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:03,639
<font face="Tahoma">I hated to do it to you, Coop.
But I had to, I had to.</font>

1686
01:31:03,664 --> 01:31:05,195
<font face="Tahoma">Rayna knew all about our agents,</font>

1687
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,753
<font face="Tahoma">'cause Karen Walker
sold her the names.</font>

1688
01:31:07,778 --> 01:31:10,157
<font face="Tahoma">I just couldn't trust anyone at the
agency not to give me away.</font>

1689
01:31:10,182 --> 01:31:11,457
<font face="Tahoma">Not even you.</font>

1690
01:31:11,482 --> 01:31:13,360
<font face="Tahoma">How would I know
you're telling me the true?</font>

1691
01:31:13,385 --> 01:31:15,405
<font face="Tahoma">Did Karen Walker
tried to kill you?</font>

1692
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:18,512
<font face="Tahoma">- You shot her?
- I'm deep undercover.</font>

1693
01:31:18,537 --> 01:31:21,920
<font face="Tahoma">But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.</font>

1694
01:31:21,945 --> 01:31:23,717
<font face="Tahoma">Alright.
Look me in the eye.</font>

1695
01:31:23,742 --> 01:31:26,934
<font face="Tahoma">- Huh?
- Really. Look me in the eye.</font>

1696
01:31:28,660 --> 01:31:31,109
<font face="Tahoma">One of your eyes is
bigger than the other.</font>

1697
01:31:31,134 --> 01:31:34,141
<font face="Tahoma">- Really?
- No.</font>

1698
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:36,485
<font face="Tahoma">You're perfect.
God damn it.</font>

1699
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:38,435
<font face="Tahoma">Asshole.</font>

1700
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:41,611
<font face="Tahoma">- Ou!
- That hurt.</font>

1701
01:31:41,636 --> 01:31:43,767
<font face="Tahoma">Good, it's suppose to.</font>

1702
01:31:43,792 --> 01:31:45,239
<font face="Tahoma">- Bosom.
- Huh?</font>

1703
01:31:45,264 --> 01:31:48,919
<font face="Tahoma">- Is he dangerous?
- Only if you have boobs.</font>

1704
01:31:48,944 --> 01:31:51,320
<font face="Tahoma">So. Does Rayna really
know I was a spy?</font>

1705
01:31:51,345 --> 01:31:52,476
<font face="Tahoma">No.</font>

1706
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:54,770
<font face="Tahoma">Not until you blew your cover
back at that kitchen.</font>

1707
01:31:54,795 --> 01:31:57,258
<font face="Tahoma">I really thought she was
more experienced than that.</font>

1708
01:31:57,283 --> 01:32:00,188
<font face="Tahoma">Thank God she's not.
Because if she was,</font>

1709
01:32:00,213 --> 01:32:01,706
<font face="Tahoma">you would be dead now.</font>

1710
01:32:01,731 --> 01:32:04,589
<font face="Tahoma">- I used your pretty good covers...
- I got to go.</font>

1711
01:32:04,614 --> 01:32:06,881
<font face="Tahoma">We're heading to De Luca De villa
to meet with Dudaev.</font>

1712
01:32:06,906 --> 01:32:09,612
<font face="Tahoma">Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.</font>

1713
01:32:09,637 --> 01:32:12,136
<font face="Tahoma">This thing is almost over.</font>

1714
01:32:12,551 --> 01:32:14,532
<font face="Tahoma">Hang tight.</font>

1715
01:32:18,557 --> 01:32:20,876
<font face="Tahoma">Hello, bound lady.</font>

1716
01:32:20,901 --> 01:32:22,301
<font face="Tahoma">Not now, Aldo.</font>

1717
01:32:22,326 --> 01:32:26,235
<font face="Tahoma">I think Mr. Fine
underestimated you.</font>

1718
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:28,543
<font face="Tahoma">You found your target,
you tracked them down.</font>

1719
01:32:28,568 --> 01:32:30,343
<font face="Tahoma">You fought very hard.</font>

1720
01:32:30,368 --> 01:32:32,212
<font face="Tahoma">Susan.</font>

1721
01:32:33,212 --> 01:32:35,605
<font face="Tahoma">You're a good agent.</font>

1722
01:32:36,985 --> 01:32:39,531
<font face="Tahoma">You'll get them next time, huh?</font>

1723
01:32:40,797 --> 01:32:43,344
<font face="Tahoma">Unless we die here.</font>

1724
01:32:45,438 --> 01:32:47,475
<font face="Tahoma">Maybe we'll not.</font>

1725
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:49,659
<font face="Tahoma">You know what?
I'm not going down like this.</font>

1726
01:32:49,684 --> 01:32:51,189
<font face="Tahoma">I need you to untie me.</font>

1727
01:32:51,214 --> 01:32:53,478
<font face="Tahoma">No. You heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.</font>

1728
01:32:53,503 --> 01:32:57,388
<font face="Tahoma">- We have to stay put.
- Untie me. Now!</font>

1729
01:33:00,035 --> 01:33:01,391
<font face="Tahoma">That's my ass!</font>

careful about the company you keep.</font>

1774
01:37:05,196 --> 01:37:06,905
<font face="Tahoma">So many people have such</font>

1781
01:37:20,808 --> 01:37:22,333
<font face="Tahoma">Mr. De Luca, it's true.</font>

1782
01:37:22,358 --> 01:37:25,284
<font face="Tahoma">I worked for the CIA.
But they think I'm dead.</font>

1787

1793
01:37:51,646 --> 01:37:54,063
<font face="Tahoma">Susan Cooper.
I'm with the CIA.</font>

1794
01:37:54,088 --> 01:37:57,109
<font face="Tahoma">Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
 the entire agency here</font>

1795
01:37:57,134 --> 01:37:58,988

Huh.</font>

1798
01:38:02,817 --> 01:38:04,998
<font face="Tahoma">It's just me.
As could be in your best interest</font>

1799
01:38:05,023 --> 01:38:06,875
<font face="Tahoma">to keep Fine and me alive.</font>

1800
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:10,047
<font face="Tahoma">I'm trying, but I not quite
following your logic.</font>

1801
01:38:10,072 --> 01:38:11,856
<font face="Tahoma">You want me to slow it
down for you. Okay.</font>

1802
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:13,294
<font face="Tahoma">You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev.</font>

1803

01:38:20,005 --> 01:38:21,888
<font face="Tahoma">to tell you how
he does business.</font>

1806
01:38:21,913 --> 01:38:24,165
<font face="Tahoma">It's about half the people
he deals with end up dead.</font>

1807
01:38:24,190 --> 01:38:26,825
<font face="Tahoma">I'll tell you another thing.
Your little girlfriend,</font>

1808
01:38:26,850 --> 01:38:28,582
<font face="Tahoma">one from the Paris bombing.</font>

1809
01:38:28,607 --> 01:38:30,698
<font face="Tahoma">She's just using you
to get to Rayna.</font>

1810
01:38:30,723 --> 01:38:33,946
<font face="Tahoma">If it hadn't for me last night,
she would have kidnapped her at the club.</font>

1811
01:38:33,971 --> 01:38:35,908
<font face="Tahoma">And you would be standing
here with your dick in your hand,</font>

1812
01:38:35,933 --> 01:38:37,424
<font face="Tahoma">because you'd never find that bomb.</font>

1813
01:38:37,463 --> 01:38:39,460
<font face="Tahoma">So.
You need me, De Luca.</font>

1814
01:38:39,485 --> 01:38:42,460
<font face="Tahoma">And I'm not going to help you
unless you keep Fine alive.</font>

1815
01:38:47,992 --> 01:38:49,419
<font face="Tahoma">So.
Let me get this straight.</font>

<font face="Tahoma">You work for the CIA.</font>

1817
01:38:51,045 --> 01:38:53,569
<font face="Tahoma">Yet you're willing to help
me sell a nuclear bomb,</font>

<font face="Tahoma">in order to save this man's life.</font>

1819
01:38:55,414 --> 01:38:59,208
<font face="Tahoma">- Why would I believe that?
- Because she's in love with him.</font>

1820
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:03,261
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, so what?
This idiot doesn't even know it.</font>

1821
01:39:03,286 --> 01:39:06,075
<font face="Tahoma">Too dump to know
I'll do anything for him.</font>

1822
01:39:07,227 --> 01:39:09,210
<font face="Tahoma">Look.
Fuck the CIA, right.</font>

1823
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:10,765
<font face="Tahoma">What did they

1824
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:13,007
<font face="Tahoma">Took 10 years of my life,
give me shitty pay.</font>

1825
01:39:13,032 --> 01:39:15,788
<font face="Tahoma">Put me in the basement
with a ceiling full of bats.</font>

1826
01:39:15,813 --> 01:39:18,204
<font face="Tahoma">Pretty sure give me a pink eye
or at least an allergy.</font>

1827
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:21,056
<font face="Tahoma">Something got fuck up in my eye.</font>

1828
01:39:21,332 --> 01:39:24,699
<font face="Tahoma">I would have mal a long time ago
if it hadn't been for Fine.</font>

1829
01:39:25,886 --> 01:39:27,289
<font face="Tahoma">So, yeah.</font>

1830
01:39:27,314 --> 01:39:30,270
<font face="Tahoma">I'll do anything it takes

1831
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:33,325
<font face="Tahoma">That's pretty pathetic, right?</font>

1832
01:39:33,998 --> 01:39:35,963
<font face="Tahoma">Extremely pathetic.</font>

1833
01:39:35,988 --> 01:39:37,399
<font face="Tahoma">God, you're an asshole.</font>

1834
01:39:37,424 --> 01:39:40,952
<font face="Tahoma">When this is over,
I'm gonna shave that fucking head.</font>

1835
01:39:40,977 --> 01:39:42,996
<font face="Tahoma">Alright, Miss Hair Vision.</font>

1836
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:44,523
<font face="Tahoma">I'll take you up on your offer.</font>

1837
01:39:44,548 --> 01:39:47,708
<font face="Tahoma">But if you try anything,
I mean anything.</font>

1845
01:40:19,452 --> 01:40:22,664

<font face="Tahoma">Huh.
A lead lined compartment.</font>

1860
01:41:41,308 --> 01:41:45,545
<font face="Tahoma">Correct. The lead lining is said
to mask any radiation detection.</font>

1861
01:41:45,570 --> 01:41:47,775
<font face="Tahoma">My father was extremely
good at his job.</font>

1862
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,847
<font face="Tahoma">Unbelievable! You know.
You could have warned me, Rayna.</font>

1863
01:41:50,872 --> 01:41:53,896

She got you.</font>

2023
01:51:13,412 --> 01:51:16,179
<font face="Tahoma">Oh my god.
It was a good one.</font>

2024
01:51:17,444 --> 01:51:19,614
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah, actually I'm not.
I don't have a sense of humor.</font>

2025
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:22,209
<font face="Tahoma">- No, you don't.
- We'll talk soon.</font>

2026
01:51:22,234 --> 01:51:24,204
<font face="Tahoma">Got the pink eyes under control.</font>

2027
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:26,370
<font face="Tahoma">But...
It was actually an allergy, ma'am.</font>

2028
01:51:26,394 --> 01:51:27,916
<font face="Tahoma">Okay.
Got it.</font>

2029
01:51:27,941 --> 01:51:29,633
<font face="Tahoma">So.
You're a spy now, Coop.</font>

2030
01:51:29,658 --> 01:51:30,871
<font face="Tahoma">Yeah.</font>

2031
01:51:30,896 --> 01:51:33,291
<font face="Tahoma">- Congratulations.
- Thanks.</font>

2032
01:51:33,316 --> 01:51:36,692
<font face="Tahoma">I don't think I'll ever find anyone
as good as you in the basement.</font>

2033
01:51:37,057 --> 01:51:38,314
<font face="Tahoma">Well.</font>

2034
01:51:38,339 --> 01:51:41,828
<font face="Tahoma">I think you will. There's a lot
of good people down there.</font>

2035
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:44,775
<font face="Tahoma">So, hey.
The thing is.</font>

2036
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,904
<font face="Tahoma">I know a great little restaurant
right near here.  Maybe</font>

2037
01:51:48,929 --> 01:51:51,425
<font face="Tahoma">you and I
could go for a nice long</font>

2038
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:53,029
<font face="Tahoma">dinner.</font>

2039
01:51:59,174 --> 01:52:00,512
<font face="Tahoma">You know what.
I just</font>

2040
01:52:00,537 --> 01:52:03,786
<font face="Tahoma">got a feeling like a
a girl's night.</font>

2041
01:52:03,811 --> 01:52:07,135
<font face="Tahoma">- You understand, right?
- Yeah, sure.</font>

2042
01:52:07,295 --> 01:52:09,650
<font face="Tahoma">I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.</font>

2043
01:52:09,675 --> 01:52:11,476
<font face="Tahoma">Thank you.</font>

2044
01:52:12,230 --> 01:52:14,300
<font face="Tahoma">Hey.
Coop.</font>

2045
01:52:14,325 --> 01:52:18,209
<font face="Tahoma">All those things you said
about me to De Luca.</font>

2046
01:52:19,356 --> 01:52:21,276
<font face="Tahoma">Did you mean that?</font>

2047
01:52:21,916 --> 01:52:24,668
<font face="Tahoma">You're a lot furrier than
I thought you'd be.</font>

2048
01:52:24,693 --> 01:52:26,018
<font face="Tahoma">- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

2049
01:52:26,043 --> 01:52:28,157
<font face="Tahoma">Smell you later, pal.</font>

2050
01:52:28,795 --> 01:52:30,398
<font face="Tahoma">Glad you're still alive
Beverly.</font>

2051
01:52:30,423 --> 01:52:33,479
<font face="Tahoma">- You silly fucking girly wanker.
- Aw! God!</font>

2052
01:52:33,504 --> 01:52:35,548
<font face="Tahoma">Nice work, Cooper.</font>

2053
01:52:35,573 --> 01:52:37,997
<font face="Tahoma">Wow.
Is that a compliment?</font>

2054
01:52:38,022 --> 01:52:39,500
<font face="Tahoma">That's not easy
for you to do.</font>

2055
01:52:39,525 --> 01:52:41,263
<font face="Tahoma">Ah fuck it.
Look, you did a good job.</font>

2056
01:52:41,288 --> 01:52:42,910
<font face="Tahoma">Probably just beginner's luck though.</font>

2057
01:52:42,935 --> 01:52:44,180
<font face="Tahoma">Ah, there we go.</font>

2058
01:52:44,218 --> 01:52:47,214
<font face="Tahoma">- Where did you get that suit?
- I fucking made it, didn't I.</font>

2059
01:52:47,239 --> 01:52:50,381
<font face="Tahoma">It's nice.
You're still out of the CIA?</font>

2060
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:52,148
<font face="Tahoma">Probably not.
They need me.</font>

2061
01:52:52,173 --> 01:52:54,584
<font face="Tahoma">I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.</font>

2062
01:52:54,609 --> 01:52:56,242
<font face="Tahoma">Clear my head.</font>

2063
01:52:56,682 --> 01:52:58,745
<font face="Tahoma">I'm going to take
this down the coast.</font>

2064
01:52:58,928 --> 01:53:02,844
<font face="Tahoma">Maybe, spend some time in Italy.
Travel to Greece.</font>

2065
01:53:02,869 --> 01:53:05,744
<font face="Tahoma">Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.</font>

2066
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:09,312
<font face="Tahoma">Sounds good, Ford.
Good for you.</font>

2067
01:53:09,337 --> 01:53:10,984
<font face="Tahoma">Take care.</font>

2068
01:53:11,211 --> 01:53:12,779
<font face="Tahoma">Bye.</font>

2069
01:53:14,422 --> 01:53:17,723
<font face="Tahoma">Arrivederci !</font>

01:53:18,549 --> 01:53:22,552
<font face="Tahoma">- Do you think he knows that's a lake?
- No. I don't.</font>

2071
01:53:27,173 --> 01:53:28,950
<font face="Tahoma">- Let's go.
- Okay.</font>

2072
01:53:28,975 --> 01:53:31,160
<font face="Tahoma">I can't let anybody see
how sore I am.</font>

2073
01:53:31,185 --> 01:53:32,569
<font face="Tahoma">- I got you.
- Okay.</font>

2074
01:53:32,594 --> 01:53:35,948
<font face="Tahoma">- Come here.
- Oh, my glutes are really season up</font>

2075
01:53:35,973 --> 01:53:37,502
<font face="Tahoma">If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.</font>

2076
01:53:37,527 --> 01:53:39,491
<font face="Tahoma">Take a hot bath and then
we get to celebrate.</font>

2077
01:53:39,516 --> 01:53:43,094
<font face="Tahoma">- I hope you like champagne and beef jerky.
- Well. Oh, that's a...</font>

2078
01:53:43,119 --> 01:53:45,675
<font face="Tahoma">You have to.
Because I stole a case of it.</font>

2079
01:53:45,700 --> 01:53:49,345
<font face="Tahoma">- I don't know if I like them together.
- Out of 50 Cent's helicopter.</font>

2080
01:53:49,369 --> 01:53:51,431
<font face="Tahoma">Oh.
Slower. Slower.</font>

2081
01:53:51,456 --> 01:53:54,248
<font face="Tahoma">Come on!
Is this a fucking lake?</font>

2082
01:53:55,402 --> 01:53:58,047
<font face="Tahoma">How the fuck do I get to Italy?</font>

2083
01:54:15,839 --> 01:54:18,713
<font face="Tahoma">Oh, stop screaming.
You loved it.</font>

2084
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:22,091
<font face="Tahoma">Oh god.</font>
