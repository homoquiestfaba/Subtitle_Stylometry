Director

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,325
Grenade!

5
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,446
Hurry!

6
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,330
Here.

7
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,950
Speak, sir!

8
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,580
Stand back, please.

9
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
Going for that line.

10
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,200
- Dr Jones.
- Good evening.

11
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:30,411
What do you expect from the Romanian Peace
conference this week?

12
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,117
I think that I can not
At this chvlii say anything definite.

13
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,791
With our allies around the world are looking
new alternatives in Vaic against terror.

14
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,827
We were adamant and says.

15
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,534
Now we'll see
we can do dalšhio.

16
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:46,540
But definitely most importantly,
we were strong.

17
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,082
Yes, it is.

18
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:53,541
But when this effort inspires fear
and disappointment throughout the world,

19
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,493
we achieve?

20
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:59,370
- We think that it is time for another attempt.
- Right. Thank you so much.

21
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:03,864
It was Bezpecnostnhio advisor office,
Jones Robert,

22
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,198
at the annual governor
ball in New York City.

23
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:09,409
Presidential Peace Initiative was
the Congress adopted with a large dose of skepticism.

24
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,743
Groups conservatives assess peace
initiative as irresponsible and un-American.

25
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:17,909
Yesterday's demonstration calling for tougher
action against terrorist organizations.

26
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,531
According to reports, the CIA analysis confirms

27
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,292
Having recently discovered Jamarova
Videotape is definitely authentic.

28
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,330
I consider

29
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:29,833
the president in an attempt
the so-called peace initiative wrong.

30
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,707
... around the world looking for new
alternatives in Vaic terror.

31
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,370
We were adamant and says.

32
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:39,699
Now we'll see
we can do dalšhio.

33
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,281
It was Bezpecnostnhio advisor office,
Jones Robert,

34
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,946
at the annual governor
ball in New York City.

35
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,910
The way Dr Jones was
considered the most important step

36
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,915
to find concrete structures
for this initiative,

37
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,489
establishing contact with other
allies around the world.

38
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:59,662
Presidential Peace Initiative met
in the House of Congress with mixed ...

39
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,499
Imagine if they really
knew what was going on.

40
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,745
- It's clear, Roberto?
- Quite clearly, Mr. Chairman.

41
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,658
I know that everything in this chvlii
I lay on your shoulders

42
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,163
but I believe that you ensure that all
probhialo as we want.

43
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,654
I know, sir.

44
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,990
We can not afford
to something nevyšIo.

45
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,998
- Are you sure that you are going into it?
- Certainly, Archie.

46
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,831
- Newalle, any questions?
- No, we are all ready, sir.

47
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:36,872
- In that case, good luck.
- Dkiy, sir.

48
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:41,660
- Bring a few souvenirs.
- Just do all right mantra.

49
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,748
Sir.

50
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,786
Numerous bombing in London
during the last week is attributed

51
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,161
from the vicinity of a terrorist group
leader Mohammed Jamar.

52
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,869
European leaders have praised
President's peace initiative.

53
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,703
It is the only way forward.
That is the joint communiqué issued by the EU.

54
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,620
Special units searched yesterday
remote mountain hideout in Pakistan.

55
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,824
Continue to look for terrorist leader,
Mohammed Jamar.

56
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:39,081
Bliý house denotes a massive campaign
against presidential peace initiatives

57
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,580
as false, defamatory and
American political scene undignified.

58
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,457
Believe

59
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:48,707
that if the president tries to act
and will not insist,

60
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:55,749
they will consider our friends
and enemies abroad as a sign of weakness.

61
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:59,332
Rockford,
video search program?

62
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:02,619

- You wanted to see me?

Tomorrow I will not go to that conference.

Understand.

82
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,034
It will not be routine, do you?

83
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,326
No.

84
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,077
- Drink?
- Please.

85
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,532
I have an appointment with someone.

86
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,951
With someone outstanding.

87
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:38,534
Will not tell you the reason why.
Neither will say with whom.

88
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,246
I'll tell you only this:

89
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:49,374
Under no circumstances, no one except you,
me, your people and the team that gentleman

that this meeting took place.

I can not express enough
the importance of the meeting.

For the meeting never nedošIo.

93

Sorry, but nelbií like it.

00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,620
I think you have no choice.

95
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,081
Understand.

96
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,077
- Time? - Tomorrow.
- Location?

97
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,616
About 60 km from the city, the hotel is near the lake.

98
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,034
Ancient refuge kráIovské family.

99
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,411
Is still in operation.
Tomorrow belongs to us.

100

- Who's all finished?
- I, oddly enough I can call.

103
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,535
And the local authority?

104
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,907
They know only that there spend
few hours before the conference.

105
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,409
But nobody knows
with whom I meet.

106
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,744
- Nobody?
- President, Foreign Minister ...

107
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:03,664
But I think
that the permit are adequate.

108
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,996
Lance,

Have you more,
than men to experience a cIovek.

112
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,578
And you are still reliable.

113

It will not be easy.

116
00:15:54,042 --> 00:15:57,657
So what? Hottest
directly from the esophagus volcano?

117
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:02,368
It's all fairly
Surprise, huh?

118
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:05,871
We're going to Disneyland.
Somebody needs to rest?

119
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,995
- Something like that.
- Cool.

120
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,783
If you Mickey

Lights out, children. I do not want

I think that "Stevenson.

126
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,032
I thought that the British have manners.
Even in the service of SAS.

127
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,792
I just try a little
to establish international relations.

128
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:50,994

Still believes that doing the right thing.
Best for this country.

If we are careful
everything will be fine.

134
00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:32,409
The next step will be to eliminate a traitor.
Destroys this country.

135
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,664
That is true.
We must destroy the President.

136
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:39,161
- The right time. Give us a message
when you know something. - Yes, sir.

137
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,290
This is bullshit. State, supervising,
have your ass freezing.

138
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,744

Withholding his men outside.

00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,581

148
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:52,573

I am glad that you are on our side.

189
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:39,533
Do you think that works here
room service?

190
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:44,284
Well ...

191
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,032
So far.

192
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,874
See you later.

193
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,904
- How you got there, people?
- Cool.

194
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,742
Only if it were not such a hot.

195
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:13,034
- Stevenson, got a beer?
- No, but Parker ...

196
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,700

Okay, guys.

202
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:27,660
Shit!

203
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,952
Shit!

204
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,536
Damn, boss is away!

205
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,870
Scripts bought it!

206
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:41,453
Stevenson, get down!

207
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,490
Kaye, cover us!

208
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,785
Kaye, the tower is a sniper.
At eleven.

00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,281
- What happened?
- Sniper!

210
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,289
Boss, the guy is dead.

211
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:15,863
Boss, what to do with Silke?

212
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,908
Stay in your seats.

213
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:22,999
Kaye, call for backup.
You watch the door.

214
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,540
Good, Stevenson, come together.

215
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,707
Come!

216
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:57,040
- I thought about that
meeting is one nevedeI. - Me too.

217
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,449
Also I had lost cIoveka.

218
00:33:02,583 --> 00:33:03,247
Without!

219
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,784
Fuck.

220
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,285
Birdcage, here is the delta, over.

221
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:48,451
Birdcage, here is the delta, over.

222
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:52,033
Come on!

223
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,038
Relax, it's me.

224
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:43,287
- Boss, vysliacka is deaf.
- How dumb?

225
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,995
Physically works
but not signáI.

226
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,404
If it were blocked.

227
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:56,786
- Parker, situation?
- West side of clean. There is nothing to see.

228
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,915
- Lee?
- Absolutely nothing.

229
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:03,911
Search the entire hotel.
From the top down.

230
00:35:09,417 --> 00:35:11,075
- Lee?
- Easy!

231
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,788
- Parker?
- Relax.

232
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:19,162
- Kaye?
- Relax.

233
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:21,496
- Stevenson?
- Relax.

234
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:31,117
Then just listen.

235
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,952
This is a kidnapping, not murder.

236
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,248
We employ a sniper
and záškodníci penetrate inside.

237
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:40,991
Boss, you know that there are many
ways to keep them out.

238
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,915
- It's true.
- Who is this mysterious person?

239
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,658
I do not know.

240
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:47,783
All return to places.

241
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:51,122
Define a free field of fire, guard
groups, which could enter the building.

242
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,412
Be alert.

243
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,038
Do you think they would attack?

244
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,742
Who's your boss?

245
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,454
I can not say.

246
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:27,956
Boss, I have company.
A not pleasant.

247
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:30,075
Coming.

248
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,991
- That was close.
- Yeah.

249
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,449
Lie!

250
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,532
Grenade!

251
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,871
- Nice, boss.
- Dki.

252
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,915
Stevenson, are you okay?

253
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:20,744
- I NevedeI that you care.
- I do not care.

254
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,282
Morgan, I'll send one cIoveka.
To assist Stevenson.

255
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,822
Kaye, you have to scheme.

256
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:04,036
Boss, I do not believe Morgan.

257
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:07,410
We can not pick and choose.

258
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:12,823
Silence. What is your plan?

259
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:17,242
I think that again grouped.
About planning a final assault.

260
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:21,786
- Meaning? - This means that fast
find his people, and then get out.

261
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,200
Boss, closing.

262
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:32,411
Reports.

263
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,999
We have three.

264
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:36,701
Now two.

265
00:39:42,542 --> 00:39:44,865
Shit! They have grenade launchers!

266
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:50,036
Lee!

267
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:43,662
Stevenson? Go to thee.

268
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:46,446
Kay Parker, mine!

269
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,662
So ... Nobody knows what?

270
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,869
Shit!

271
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,830
What the hell is that?

272
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:41,621
This is jamming MX 64th
Nothing that does not pass.

273
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,997
- Where did you find?
- In the second floor.

274
00:42:45,042 --> 00:42:47,246
- It's not good.
- What you got?

275
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:50,826
I do not know. Looks
four different nationalities.

276
00:42:50,917 --> 00:42:53,785
Similar uniforms
All American.

277
00:42:54,125 --> 00:42:57,573
- Anything else?
- Yes, we have this.

278
00:42:58,667 --> 00:43:01,867
Tattoo American pilots.
Povedenej gift.

279
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,989
- Stevenson?
- Yeah. - I'll meet you outside.

280
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:08,999
I'll be there.

281
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:13,196
Maybe now we zapojíš. Come.

282
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:26,697
- Are you warm enough?
- Just right.

283
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:39,787
You realize that this is dangerous
action, as we did?

284
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,624
Maybe.

285
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,832
But I think that from this
only get frostbite.

286
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:48,831
When it fails,
finishes your term.

287
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:52,662
Archie, nežertujte, when it fails,
finishes the entire Western alliance.

288
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:55,697
- So what do we do?
- It has to come out.

289
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,495
And how much would go
to ensure that?

290
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:07,457
I lost two, you too.

291
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:10,540
- Six of us left. Including you and me.
- Against who knows how many?

292
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:13,404
We can obšancovat room.
We have to regroup.

293
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,498
Yeah, I'm for. Stupid is
that still do not have my people.

294
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:21,117
Under the new perimeter are still
outside. We have a problem.

295
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:24,656
- Then let us pray that our people
not on the other side. - I think not.

296
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,665
How can you be so sure?

297
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,950
Because if they get them,
sought not to get inside.

298
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,117
Places.

299
00:44:59,708 --> 00:45:02,955
Boss, I'm ready.

300
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:04,624
- It's a good firing position.
- Stevenson? - Come up.

301
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,828
Decides to return our money.
The hotel is below our level.

302
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:11,911
We will carry it with management.

303
00:45:12,958 --> 00:45:15,625
- Something new, Kaye?
- I signáI.

304
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,618
Birdcage, here is the delta, over.

305
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:24,123
Birdcage, here is the delta, over.

306
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:26,655
Birdcage ...

307
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:33,697
Stun grenade ... Lie!

308
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,658

- Back in the conference room.

309
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:59,157
- Stevenson, Parker will bring.
- Sure.

310
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:06,075
Shit,
You too moh few pounds to lose weight?

311
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:26,744
Pull it inside.

312
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:43,328
Boss? Look at the pager.

313
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:49,658
- What is it?
- Satellite locator.

314
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,118
Where is hell?

315
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,038
I do not know, as it should be ...

316
00:46:57,375 --> 00:47:00,741
... right here.

317
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:38,495
Take a flashlight!
Who has the landmines?

318
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:40,082
In backpack.

319
00:47:42,917 --> 00:47:45,287
Help him out.
Morgane ...

320
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,497
Kaye, retreat.

321
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:10,123
Stay here.

322
00:48:13,542 --> 00:48:14,951
Lighten me.

323
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:19,951
To fire off.

324
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,448
This is chvlii employ him, let's go.

325
00:48:53,583 --> 00:48:55,241
Interesting.

326
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:19,866
Hey, boss, are you sure?

327
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,740
Do you have a better idea?

328
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,739
- Parker, how are you?
- I got it.

329
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:30,455
I bet that way are
I kráIové crept in devkama.

330
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:35,448
You know what, Stevenson?

331
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,663
Shut up, please.

332
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:45,374
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

333
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:49,452
We have just seen an emergency
signáI Bezpecnostnhio Office. Code 42 alfa.

334
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:53,496
A location ...

335
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:58,407
60 km east
from Bucharest, Romania.

336
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,864
Relax, Parker.

337
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:19,326
Boss, I need to change the bandage.

338
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:20,953
Okay.

339
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,368
We stay in motion.

340
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,869
Stevenson, with me!

341
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:36,663
Nice to see you.

342
00:51:38,083 --> 00:51:39,540
Hello, Tom. We're back.

343
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,036
Can we look at another part
yesterday the press conference?

344
00:51:42,125 --> 00:51:44,530
I think it was only the fifth time
during his term.

345
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:46,995
Yeah, that's true.
Hear it a second.

346
00:51:47,083 --> 00:51:50,911
Until will not solve this situation,
not feel safe

347
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,743
and can not prosper.

348
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:56,874
Chvliemi debate was full of emotion
and the president justified his actions ...

349
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:02,073
- Mr President, calls generate Cooper,
said it's urgent. - Patch me.

350
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:07,706
General, I can now
do for the Pentagon?

351
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,916
Mr. President, we have noted
Emergency signáI Bezpecnostnhio úradu

352
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,496
60 km to Bucharest in Romania.
- Roger.

353
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:20,033
I also have an interesting satellite photos,
that you see meI. Same area.

354
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:23,864
- It seems that there Dosi serious fighting.
- Send them here. Anything else?

355
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:30,408
Mr. President, you know that the 82nd unit
Airborne Division now operating in Kosovo?

356
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:36,198
- I think so. What is it?
- If you say, we can immediately deploy.

357
00:52:38,792 --> 00:52:41,956
- Send in what you have.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:49,748
Connect me with the CIA.
I want director of Willis.

359
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:54,998
Flew out the window, there were bullets.

360
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:56,909
TotáIní confusion.

361
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,655
Utkiala am one direction,
on the other side.

362
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,452
I raced to the door,
and when I looked back he was gone.

363
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:06,457
But then I deploy it
not get to you.

364
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,154
So I crawled into the tunnel behind him,
I got over it.

365
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,371
It seemed reasonable.

366
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:16,201
- So he definitely all about you?
- Absolutely.

367
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,576
How?

368
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:24,743
- And where is he?
- I have no idea, just disappeared.

369
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:28,325
- When I came down here, was gone.
- There must still be.

370
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:31,664
Remember, those rulers slipped
inside, slipped out.

371
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,910
Madam, we have gone quickly.

372
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:38,450
I appreciate your concern for my safety
and security of us all,

373
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:42,239
But it depends on more than us.
We must find him and get out.

374
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,738
As I said, no
about the meeting may not know.

375
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:48,614
You can be sure
Scripts and that Lee will not disclose it.

376
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,452
I do not leave without him.

377
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:24,620
Okay. If we find him now,
exist.

378
00:54:25,292 --> 00:54:28,989
And we get out.
Agree, madam?

379
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,622
Agree.

380
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,324
Listen, if you find,

381
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,072
you have to forget everything
what do you think you know about the world.

382
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,832
You must not judge.

383
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:48,698
Continue in its task.

384
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,535
Come on.

385
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,081
Sorry, but why such a secret?

386
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:47,907
If we find him, so the same
learn. Why we can not say?

387
00:55:49,583 --> 00:55:52,285
Because no one must know.

388
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:57,072
What happens when you tell it now,
and you are separating, you did eventually captured?

389
00:55:58,167 --> 00:56:01,698
You'll know
so the secret is disclosed.

390
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:06,576
I can not risk
that I will get into such a position.

391
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:09,371
Because you and for myself.

392
00:56:09,958 --> 00:56:12,363
Most likely to know someone.

393
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,742
Can only presume
they do not know everything.

394
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,034
Now they are quiet for some time.

395
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:38,160
Do you think they left?
Maybe that was captured.

396
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:45,116
Got beat advisory.
And they know we're here.

397
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:50,033
Probably want to obstruct the tunnel soon.

398
00:57:07,208 --> 00:57:08,701
It is a blind alley.

399
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:12,914
Certainly left tunnel
leading from the hotel.

400
00:57:14,792 --> 00:57:16,534
I think so.

401
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,536
There.

402
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:37,530
I have an appointment with someone.
With someone outstanding.

403
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,246
What is our mysterious guest?

404
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,655
Someone special.

405
00:58:04,125 --> 00:58:05,666
Right?

406
00:58:08,625 --> 00:58:10,663
Kaye.

407
00:58:12,583 --> 00:58:15,118
We have to get him out.
He lost too much blood.

408
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:17,573
I know, but we can not
make contact with anyone.

409
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:20,285
Vysliacka was
the last explosion destroyed.

410
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,989
Seems
it is our only hope.

411
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,200
Hopefully someone listens.

412
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:29,327
Otherwise it is a kick in the ass out of here
prima vodsad straight to breakfast.

413
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:32,367
Because we always rkiali SAS ...

414
00:58:44,667 --> 00:58:47,156
- Kaye! Situation?
- We're under fire.

415
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,865
- Go away. The East.
Your only chance. - Roger.

416
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,114
Come.

417
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:10,082
Go! Do not stop!

418
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,196
- Go!
- I like!

419
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,616
Come back into the tunnel.

420
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:31,161
Here is cut,
will come to you.

421
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:48,245
- Stevenson, here!
- Move! Move!

422
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:50,740
Throw me the bag!

423
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:54,413
- Did you see him?
- Yeah.

424
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,537
Okay.

425
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:00,365
Boss, I have a problem.

426
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,871
- What?
- Parker vomiting.

427
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,999
- I have to relax the airways.
- Hold it, Kaye.

428
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:09,245
Come on, Parker, breathe.

429
01:00:10,167 --> 01:00:12,205
Madam, come with me.

430
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,822
- Come on!
- Come with me.

431
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,040
Need help?

432
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:35,364
Now to quit.

433
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:40,830
- Kaye! Situation?
- Distance 50 mA fast approaching!

434
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:44,822
Watch it back.
Attention explosion!

435
01:00:46,667 --> 01:00:48,208
Come on.

436
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:51,246
Everybody back!

437
01:00:58,333 --> 01:00:59,363
Lance!

438
01:01:03,125 --> 01:01:06,076
Lance, wait!

439
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,200
Is on our side.

440
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,249
I believed in you at a time
when nobody else believed.

441
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,286
Now it is up to you to believe me.

442
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,910
I trusted you in time,
when you believe no one else.

443
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:25,413
Lance, put the gun down.

444
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:28,455
Put the gun down.

445
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:40,996
- Information. - We get a black eye.
We will try to get out.

446
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:45,576
Take this.

447
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:19,160
He's dead, shot him in the back.

448
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,324
No, wait!

449
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:30,989
Pick him!

450
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:33,832
- Up! Up!
- Come on!

451
01:02:48,375 --> 01:02:50,780
Assaulted them.
They got to her?

452
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:54,371
We noticed signáI Dr
Jones. We are trying to find out what happened.

453
01:02:54,458 --> 01:02:58,073
- Roger, sir. - How well do you know, meetings
with Jamar is a very sensitive issue.

454
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:00,082
- Yes, sir.
- We must proceed with great caution.

455
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:03,864
Immediately, we connect with the Romanian government.
Once the President gives instructions, initiate action.

456
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:09,409
- President and I believe you.
You need to find her. - Yes, sir.

457
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:12,081
Find her.

458
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:22,454
We have to wait.

459
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,125
You have five seconds to
tell me what the hell is.

460
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:34,495
I have the same instructions as you.

461
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:38,288
I am sure that there Mr. Jamar
and Mrs. Jones escaped alive.

462
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,823
Enough.

463
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:44,158
I know who you are.

464
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,906
I know what you did.

465
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:53,455
You admirable man,
Mr. Rockford.

466
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:57,620
Although each of us on the other side,

467
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,327
I and my people

468
01:04:01,042 --> 01:04:04,372
behave to you the highest admiration.

469
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,622
That's very nice,

470
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,990
But I would like to keep who preseknul
the wires and Parker who killed.

471
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:12,488
Lance, listen up!

472
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:18,242
I'm sorry ... Parker
and others. Really.

473
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,163
I be in Bucharest the conference,
Not here.

474
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:27,956
But if on someone
I think anyone becomes aware

475
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:31,409
the whole credibility of the United State
will be shaken.

476
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:34,617
And the stability of the whole world.

477
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:38,952
May sound exaggerated,
but you know it's true.

478
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,332
So what are we doing?

479
01:04:41,667 --> 01:04:47,332
We think that Mr. Jamar ruled
terror, what nevideI world.

480
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:51,871
I do.
Not only that we ceased to fight,

481
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,946
we integrate it
in its policy.

482
01:04:55,042 --> 01:04:59,166
- But we nepremohli him.
- No you can not find, therefore oficiáIne.

483
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:06,907
Because, if we find him,
we would either kill him,

484
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,623
or capture and interrogate him.

485
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:14,078
And do it ... It would be much
more dangerous than when he remains missing.

486
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:16,620
So what the fuck are we doing?

487
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:21,287
Because Lee, Scripts
Parker and I think

488
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,124
we have a right to know
Why are we here?

489
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:27,159
You are here
to buy my invisibility.

490
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:33,118
So for a price
never appear.

491
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:36,790
Never find him.
Always remains a mystery.

492
01:05:48,917 --> 01:05:51,749
Gas! Stay down.

493
01:06:11,125 --> 01:06:14,372
- So how it looks?
- Await the report from Romania, sir.

494
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,954
So do not know if the tasks?

495
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:20,041
No, we do not know if you make contact.
We have her report.

496
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:23,040
- Still waiting for confirmation sir.
- In this we must not disappoint.

497
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:26,250
- Once you find something, let me know.
- Yes, sir.

498
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:27,910
Yes, sir.

499
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:51,034
Here is a draft.
East must be close.

500
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:54,792
Will you be here,
you find the east!

501
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:07,165
Hurry!

502
01:07:12,792 --> 01:07:14,582
Grenade!

503
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,911
Come on, baby. Go!

504
01:08:21,875 --> 01:08:24,364
Rockford!

505
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,322
Grant, wait!

506
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,323
Come on, wake up!

507
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,910
Kaye, stick to me.
We need to get out, come on!

508
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:39,698
We can do it, come on!

509
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:46,582
Lance, I present to you the agent
Grant of ML5 in London.

510
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:50,909
And Taylor is an agent of CIA.

511
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:54,658
I know that it is not perfect,
but you must trust me.

512
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:57,447
This operation is extremely important.

513
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:02,081
Forget Mohammed Jamar,
leadership of our country is in danger.

514
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:07,873
Over a year working with the CIA and ML5,
we are caught in a trap.

515
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,535
Who?

516
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:12,907
In Washington there is a group of people
who want to overthrow the president.

517
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:17,575
They are against the peace initiative.
Want to destroy it, they want peace.

518
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,867
Väike is big business, Lance.
And that means a lot of money.

519
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:27,616
- Who are these people? - Mercenaries, what will
paid for that kill us.

520
01:09:27,792 --> 01:09:30,576
What do to help?
Kill my people.

521
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,703
Threaten you.
You're a Dr. Jones.

522
