1
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,907
Lookie here.

2
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,619
My day is made.

3
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,664
I didn't even finish breakfast
and I get to kill me a stinkin' Injun.

4
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,083
Injun?

5
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,585
Nah.

6
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,297
I just dress like this so's I don't get
scalped out on the prairie.

7
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,425
Oh, well, that's a convincing outfit.

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,888
Yeah, you can't be too safe out there...

9
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:38,515
with all of them savages runnin' around.

10
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,392
So, what can I do you for?

11
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,687
Need some flour.
Five sacks.

12
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:47,024
And a carrot with peanut butter on it.

13
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,609
Now, what's that gonna run me?

14
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,612
Well, sack of flour's 45 cents.

15
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,947
So, five sacks...

16
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,992
is 40...

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,786
Wanna get back to me on that?

18
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,829
Yeah, look...

19
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,539
Now, the flour's in the basement.

20
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,833
You can fetch it yourself.

21
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:05,959
Much obliged.

22
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,939
Well, lookie what we got here.

23
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,276
Sweet piece of red prairie meat
out all by her lonesome.

24
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:35,989
-What do you make of that, Nelly?
-Oh, I think she's waiting on you, Will.

25
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,578
- Go on, get on it.
- It's on now.

26
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,955
- Yeah.
- Go get her, Will.

27
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,039
Oh, oh, oh.

28
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,373
Here we go.

29
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:51,714
Now, you must be wondering why five badass
hombres with perfect jawlines...

30
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,928
all sport the same stylish eye patch.

31
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,972
Not my business.

32
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:04,517
We all carved our eyeballs
out our skull

33
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,063
to show how devoted
we are to this gang.

34
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,397
We the Left-Eye Boys!

35
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,026
- Yeah!

36
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,695
Hey!

37
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:18,573
You got real pretty eyes, miss.

38
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,784
You reckon we can,
I don't know, borrow one?

39
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,870
--Can we borrow one?

40
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,710
Now, is that a proper question
to ask a lady?

41
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,839
Who are you, slick?
The boyfriend?

42
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,134
Soon to be the husband.

43
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,472
Oh, wait a minute!
That's a white boy under that getup.

44
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,350
That's a white boy? Oh, shit.

45
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,645
You partial to pale faces, Poca-hot-tits?

46
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,730
- Huh?

47
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,274
'Cause I can show you
what a real white man's like.

48
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,736
-Yeah, show her, Will. Yeah, go on.
-Yeah, shuffle up, Will.

49
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,237
-Dance now, boy.
-Shuffle on over.

50
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,990
-There you go.
-That's some white boy shit right there.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,825
Now, I do want to carve my eyes out.

52
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,451
-What'd you say?
-Hey, fellers...

53
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,496
I'd hit the trail before you get hurt.

54
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,374
Before we get hurt?

55
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,044
- Before we get hurt.

56
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,089
I think you've been smokin' too much
of that peace pipe, kemo-slobby.

57
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,634
--Now, from what I see, there's one of you,

58
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,054
and there's five of us.

59
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:28,894
Four of you.

60
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,728
What just happened?

61
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,105
You wanna see it again?

62
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,942
Uh... yes.

63
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,330
-I don't like this shit.
-Shut up.

64
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,542
Well, that's some, uh...
real fancy footwork.

65
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,380
But I think this hullabaloo has escalated
to the firearms stage.

66
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,725
Boys, let's ventilate this.

67
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,500
What the shit that just happened?

68
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:45,303
What the hell?
What in the hell?

69
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,894
"Hit the trail."
It was so simple.

70
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:56,439
You must stop doing this, White Knife.
One day, there will be too many.

71
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,650
But not today, Smoking Fox.

72
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,653
Please, my love...
we must go.

73
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,447
What the hell
happened out here?

74
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,741
Injuns.
They went that way.

75
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,451
You ain't no white man.

76
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,746
You're that orphan, White Knife.

77
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,458
Raised like an animal with those Apaches.

78
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,627
You think you can fool ol' Clem?

79
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,836
Sorry, Ringo.

80
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:22,882
Well, now I'm gonna shoot you
and your Injun whore.

81
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,134
Gotta cut breakfast short.

82
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,599
You suck, mister!

83
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,394
You suck!

84
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,274
What are you?

85
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,465
Yes, White Knife.

86
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,799
Go, White Knife.

87
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,223
Yay!

88
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:12,933
You lucky, Smoking Fox.

89
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,103
White Knife all man.
Bravest of all braves.

90
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,522
Not brave. Foolish.

91
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,984
I want to be wife, not widow.

92
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,115
Afternoon, ladies.

93
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,872
This is Apache land.

94
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,666
I'm not here to take your land, Chief.

95
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,669
I'm just looking for a particular boy.

96
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,547
I'm Frank Stockburn.

97
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,342
This boy's mother was my wife.

98
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,303
And the boy, Tommy...

99
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,889
he's my son.

100
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,198
It is wise to be slow to trust,
White Knife.

101
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,618
But every new journey begins
with a single step.

102
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,454
Speak with your father.

103
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,624
But you are my father,
Screaming Eagle.

104
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,002
Ever since my mother...

105
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:26,048
Ever since you found me...

106
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,383
you taught me to hunt,
to fight...

107
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,594
when to speak and when to be silent.

108
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,888
-To be a man.
-A good man.

109
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,598
And this Frank Stockburn,

110
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:39,144
he is filled with lies,
just like every other white man.

111
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,939
Sometimes, the white man speaks the truth.

112
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,733
Like, one in 20, 25 times.

113
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,529
I believe this is one of those times.

114
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,033
He knew your mother, White Knife.

115
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:56,994
Maybe he can give you some peace.
Talk to him.

116
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,664
Maybe after I close my eyes to dream.

117
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,606
Mommy!

118
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,175
Oh, no.

119
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,228
One look at me, and you knew your old man
had done a lot of bad things, didn't ya?

120
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,773
I cheated men, I killed men...

121
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,194
So I deserve whatever's comin' to me.

122
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,866
The only one that ever saw any good in me
was your mother.

123
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,621
Oh!

124
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,206
Why have you come here?

125
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:27,419
Not a man for chitchat, huh?

126
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,588
Well, me neither.

127
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,091
Kid, I'm dying...

128
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,678
of consumption.

129
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,475
Don't worry...

130
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,689
I'm not looking
for no big father-son hoo-ah.

131
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,274
"I love you, son."

132
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,067
"I love you too, Daddy."

133
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,990
No.

134
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,871
I've come for a more tangible reason.

135
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:13,423
Tommy, I've been stealing from folks
since I was nine years old...

136
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:19,637
and that's the way I've amassed
a good little fortune.

137
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,350
I wanna do something
decent with it.

138
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,270
I want to give it to you, son.

139
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,526
I don't want your money.

140
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,196
But maybe you could give...

141
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,659
$50,000 to these nice Injuns
who raised you.

142
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,952
We'll take it.

143
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,204
Go back to bed.

144
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,831
Sorry.

145
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,708
Seriously, though,
we'll take it.

146
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,254
Look, it's buried in the meadow
just up the trail,

147
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,422
next to a big ol' pine tree.

148
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,883
What do you say
we go dig it up in the morning

149
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,969
and start playing Santa Claus?

150
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,723
I don't remember much about my mother...

151
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,269
but I do remember her telling me...

152
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,688
you were dead.

153
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,488
Maybe it was because...

154
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,908
she didn't want
you to come looking for me.

155
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,076
She was a smart lady.

156
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:29,206
Only stupid thing she ever did
was fall for me.

157
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,834
Meeting Betty Dunson...

158
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,713
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

159
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,136
From the first day I laid eyes on her...

160
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,056
she was bawlin' out this...

161
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,061
half-drunk, big ol' burly blacksmith...

162
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,689
down at Silver Canyon.

163
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,858
She's been the only one, Tommy.

164
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,576
Mom had a temper?

165
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:10,623
Temper?
When she got her dander up, look out.

166
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,542
We was in a saloon once.

167
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,794
This fellow sitting next to her

168
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:19,882
starts talking about the perfect way
to make a cherry pie...

169
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:24,762
So your mom says to me,
"Frank, come here a minute.

170
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,600
Tell me again,
just where did you get them flowers?"

171
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:32,729
I said, "I know that you think
I stole them from the graveyard."

172
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,566
Good morning, boys.

173
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,068
Morning, Never Wears Bra.

174
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,988
I had dream about you last night,
White Knife.

175
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,906
Oh, that's nice.

176
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,241
Not nice dream.

177
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,453
In dream, you naughty.

178
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,663
You naughty, White Knife.

179
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,999
Mmm, somebody's got an admirer.

180
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,126
--Yes, yes.

181
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,212
But like you,
there's only one woman for me.

182
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,387
I guess we Stockburns are...

183
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,221
partial to the sweet ones.

184
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,681
Yes, sir.

185
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,558
Like your mother.

186
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,354
How did she die, Tommy?

187
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,732
You tell me?

188
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:24,781
Well, there were these big kids at school
fixin' to beat me up.

189
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:30,828
Instead of facing them myself,
I had her walk me there.

190
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,915
This feller comes out of nowhere...

191
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,627
walks right up to her and shoots her dead.

192
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,674
So that's how she died,
protecting her gutless son

193
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,844
instead of being home,
safe where she belonged.

194
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,144
Who's that?
Is that Bony Express?

195
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,105
Bony Express
don't come around here.

196
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,693
- Giddyap!

197
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,123
He's here somewhere, boys.

198
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,417
Let's burn him out!

199
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,044
Oh...

200
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,046
Next one goes through your forehead.

201
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,883
Hey, hey!
No need to burn nothing, boys!

202
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,969
Howdy, boss.

203
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,178
Cicero...

204
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,183
you're not gonna let a man
enjoy his retirement, are ya?

205
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,813
No, Frank, I salute your decision
to turn from your sinful ways.

206
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,648
But the money...

207
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,442
that belongs to all of us.

208
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,860
Touch that steel, boy,

209
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,113
I got plenty of bullets left over
after I put one in...

210
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,075
your father.

211
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,038
Oh, you finally found your long lost son.

212
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:59,459
Well, I sure hate to break up
this nice family reunion.

213
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,837
So, why don't you give us
the money you stole

214
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,715
before I put lead in your head.

215
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,014
The money's buried.

216
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,307
Way to run your mouth, son.

217
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,809
It's buried?

218
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,645
Yeah, I buried it.

219
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,231
Deep in the ground...
next to a windmill.

220
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,609
A windmill in the West...

221
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,819
doesn't narrow it down much, Frank.

222
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,280
Well, this is a special windmill.

223
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,074
It's a singing windmill.

224
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,452
A singing windmill!

225
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,750
It's about a ten-day ride from here.

226
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,878
I'll lead you to it presently
on one condition.

227
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,297
You don't hurt my boy...

228
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,801
or any of these kindly Injuns here.

229
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,929
Let's ride, Frank.

230
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:08,485
Frank, if that $50,000
isn't under that windmill,

231
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,279
I'm gonna bury you up to your neck

232
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,949
and let the desert critters eat you alive.

233
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,409
It's there, Cicero, it's there.

234
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,205
I'm glad I got to meet Betty Dunson's son.

235
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,374
You just stay here, Tommy.

236
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,794
Enjoy your life
with your beautiful bride...

237
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:29,924
amongst these majestic pine trees.

238
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,260
Let's go!

239
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,659
Well, that was uncool.

240
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,130
White Knife, you must rest.

241
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,673
How can I rest?

242
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:14,426
When they get to the singing windmill
and find no money, they will kill him.

243
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,806
My son, there are too many trees
and too little time.

244
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:23,477
Then I must get this $50,000 another way.

245
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,481
How? By stealing?
There is no honor in that.

246
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,904
Unless I steal from those
who have no honor.

247
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,198
Ooh... I like that.

248
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,200
But it is too dangerous.

249
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,745
I will send ten of our
strongest braves with you.

250
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,163
No.

251
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,291
The braves would be treated too cruelly
in the white man's world.

252
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,584
A lot of them can pass for pale face.

253
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,880
Raging Bear can actually do
a great impression of a white guy.

254
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,926
Hey, guys, let's play with our chest hair
and eat potato chips.

255
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,431
Wasn't that great?
Where does he come up with this stuff?

256
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,268
That's very good, Bear,
but I must walk this path alone.

257
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,190
My love...
I will get this money...

258
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,567
bring it to the singing windmill,

259
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,736
and be back in time for our wedding.

260
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,697
I won't let you go.

261
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,949
Those men are killers.

262
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,328
I was a coward once
and my mother paid the price.

263
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,666
That will not happen to my father.

264
00:19:44,475 --> 00:19:45,476
Whoa!

265
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,729
--Good morning.

266
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,646
Where in the hell did you come from?

267
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,816
I'm in a bit of a bind, boys.

268
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,694
I rode all the way out here
to pan for gold

269
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,821
and my horse up and died on me.

270
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,405
How'd he die?

271
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,116
Suicide.

272
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,993
Drowned himself.

273
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,454
Put his head in the stream
and just kept it there.

274
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,123
Saddest thing you ever seen.

275
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,125
It happens.

276
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,169
Powers that be don't like to admit it,
but it happens.

277
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,421
He looks like an honest white guy.

278
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,257
Hop on.

279
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,175
Much obliged.

280
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,595
Just drop me off
at the nearest town.

281
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,228
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather around.

282
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,398
Hear the wondrous effects
of Dr. Chubb's Vita Oil,

283
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,859
the miracle cure for 1001 ailments.

284
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,778
Put the pep back in your--

285
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,570
Who's this asshole?

286
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,297
Well, now, look at this fella,
drinking from the horse trough.

287
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,381
Excuse me.

288
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,884
You there!

289
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,013
What you're doing is disgusting.

290
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,432
That water is for our filthy horses.

291
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,812
Water flows from the sky spirit
for all its children.

292
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,104
Isn't that right, cousin?

293
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:16,150
We don't cotton to that peyote-smoking
nonsense around these parts.

294
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,194
Do you hear me, "cousin"?

295
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,531
Okay, William, come on back.

296
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,075
Hey, amigo.

297
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,702
You planning on staying in town?

298
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,164
Might need a place
to lay my head for a bit.

299
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,383
Sorry about that ugly man
that insulted you.

300
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,596
He runs the bank, so he thinks
he's entitled to be mean to everyone.

301
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,556
There's a bank in this town?

302
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,350
Why? You wanna rob it?

303
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,644
I look like a bank robber to you, ma'am?

304
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:57,649
Funny, there's something about you that
reminds me of a certain bank robber.

305
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,194
His name was Frank Stockburn.

306
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,655
You know Frank Stockburn?

307
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,825
"Know"? Like, in the biblical sense?

308
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,328
No, ma'am.
You've met him before is what I'm asking.

309
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,788
Yes, I met him.

310
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,332
Then, 20 minutes later,

311
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,878
I knew him in the biblical sense
on that bed, right there.

312
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:17,962
Oh.

313
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:22,925
And, I knew him, in the biblical sense,
twice on this railing.

314
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,010
Uh-huh.

315
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:28,430
And then, while doing a handstand
on that dresser you're leaning against.

316
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,228
Did he happen to mention
a singing windmill?

317
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,148
He did mention a singing windmill.

318
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:40,109
He said it sounded like a choir of angels.

319
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,903
Where'd he say it was?

320
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:46,991
He said that it was in a place
where he made his biggest score.

321
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,118
Whatever that was.

322
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,452
And then he laughed.

323
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,746
He liked to laugh...

324
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,831
and have handstand sex.

325
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,792
Yeah, we gotta get past that.

326
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,127
I miss him.

327
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,171
But he did leave me something
to remember him by.

328
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,630
What's this?

329
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,134
A niño, Ramon.

330
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,345
I have a brother?

331
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:12,391
Oh, Burro, we had many adventures
together, you and me.

332
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,976
We're not getting any younger.

333
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,147
At least we have our memories.

334
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:23,945
Remember the two girls,
the sisters, in Deadwood?

335
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,321
You liked the fat one.

336
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,657
You know it's true.

337
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,242
Ramon Lopez?

338
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:32,578
Sí.

339
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:38,375
I just came from conversating
with your mother, Esmerelda.

340
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,380
We stumbled upon the fact that
your dad and my dad...

341
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,717
are the same fella.

342
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,885
Oh, that's neat.

343
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,637
Yeah.

344
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,931
Same father.

345
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:55,101
Half-brothers.

346
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,144
What do you think about that, Burro?

347
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,856
So, how is Dad?

348
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,026
Well, he went and got himself kidnapped,

349
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,946
and I need to come up with $50,000
to save his life.

350
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,407
That's a lot of pesos.

351
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,617
Sure is.

352
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,912
That's why I'm fixin'
to rob the bank here in town.

353
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,249
Hang on.

354
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,918
My father is in trouble.

355
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,921
My brother, he needs my help.

356
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,634
I'll rob the bank with you.

357
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,636
I must do this alone.

358
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,266
What's happening right now?

359
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,270
Ever since I'm pequeño,

360
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:44,108
I dream about spending
one magical day with mi padre,

361
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:48,070
sharing meals,
introducing him to the burro.

362
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,950
I will not let go of you
until you say I can help you.

363
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,669
Will you stop brushing me
if I say yes?

364
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,836
Yes.

365
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,257
Then you can help.

366
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,814
That means he likes you.

367
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,751
That's a good amount of money
you want us to lend you.

368
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,879
Now, normally, we would require
two forms of identification, madam,

369
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,924
but that won't be necessary in your case.

370
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,927
--I feel kinda guilty about this, Burro,

371
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,846
taking money from nice people.

372
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,265
I mean, it's not like
you're some greasy Mexican.

373
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:01,643
I feel less guilty now.

374
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,439
What are you doing?

375
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,441
This is a bank!

376
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,276
Get that donkey out of here!

377
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,069
It is a burro, señor.

378
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,947
I don't care, "señor."
Get it out!

379
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,782
All right.
Vámonos.

380
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,661
The burro don't want to vámonos.

381
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:23,624
Well, I don't really care
what the burro wants.

382
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,588
Get out of my bank, you beast!

383
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,133
I know what you're thinking,
but not yet.

384
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,509
Hold it.

385
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,511
Move!

386
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,525
How is this jackass stuck?

387
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,403
If it got in here,
it can certainly get out!

388
00:26:52,486 --> 00:26:55,197
It doesn't make sense,
it's not logical.

389
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,200
They got it locked up good,
do they?

390
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,620
Oh! You are leaving!

391
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:08,169
Gall dang,
he felled on his pooper!

392
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,100
- That makes no sense!
- I apologize.

393
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,520
-I don't know how many times I could--
-Hey, friend.

394
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,439
Need any help gettin' her out?

395
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,149
She's not
really stuck, amigo.

396
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:32,818
She's just a diversion.

397
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,028
She's a virgin?

398
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,198
I'm a virgin, too...

399
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,241
unless you count canty-loupes.

400
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,328
I believe that,
but she's a diversion

401
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,995
to keep the banker busy

402
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,748
so that my brother has time
to rob the bank.

403
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,917
You're robbin' the bank?

404
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,711
-Gall dang!
-Shh, shh.

405
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,297
Gall dang.
Gall dang. Gall dang.

406
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:04,099
Oh, no. Oh, no.

407
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,937
No! Virgil! Virgil, the key!

408
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,275
I'm Lil Pete.

409
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,985
So, is your father, like, Big Pete?

410
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,070
I didn't know my pa.

411
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,491
But he was a bank robber like y'all!
His name was Frank.

412
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,410
-Stockburn?
-How'd you know?

413
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,162
Are you a wizard?

414
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,502
Hey, Johnny Law.

415
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:35,339
We'll be waiting for you
up at Jawbone Falls.

416
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,923
Frank Stockburn.

417
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,592
What?

418
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,801
Robbery!

419
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,137
We're being burgled!

420
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,641
You! Horse-water-drinker!

421
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,058
You are caught, sir!

422
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,070
--Oh!

423
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,822
What are you?

424
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,618
Hey, Tommy, guess what?
We got ourselves a little brother.

425
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,829
Yeah! All our moms got porked
by the same outlaw.

426
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,790
-Ain't that a pip?
-Yeah, that's something.

427
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,668
Hey! Those bandidos just robbed the bank!

428
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,964
Taste my bullets,
you dirty foreigners!

429
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,508
Now!

430
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,306
-Nice one, Burro.
-Wow!

431
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:26,682
- There they are!
- We better make tracks.

432
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,267
Can I come with?
I got a wagon.

433
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,226
All right, that ain't a bad idea,
let's go.

434
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,812
Vámonos. Come on!

435
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,565
So, if you guys are
my brothers,

436
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,400
you must got three nipples, too.

437
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,693
I only got two.

438
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,320
Yeah, just got the two.

439
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,613
Oh, must be
from my mama's side.

440
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,574
Forget I tolded you that, okay?

441
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:44,741
Will do.

442
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,036
Are you ready, Clem?

443
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,623
Yep, yep. I'm... I'm ready.

444
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,005
Spoon.

445
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,050
Damn sharp.

446
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:13,144
Look, fellas, I wanna hunt
this white Injun down same as you.

447
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,980
But, uh... I...

448
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,317
I have some problems with my eyes.

449
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,404
You wanna join the Left-Eye Gang,
that right eye has gotta come out.

450
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,490
It'll only hurt for a second.

451
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:27,158
Yeah, like a hundred seconds.

452
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,120
-Then you're one of us.
-For life.

453
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,164
Okay, that makes sense.

454
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,962
Is it okay if I scoop this left eye out?

455
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,797
This is... I'm basically blind here.

456
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,049
This right one sees like an eagle.

457
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:46,052
Yeah, it just seems
like a waste that I'd...

458
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:49,473
I understand your predicament,
but rules is rules.

459
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,058
Yeah, guess it... makes sense.

460
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:58,982
Oh, God!

461
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,443
--Hell, no!

462
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:04,237
That ain't right!

463
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,657
--Damn!

464
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,074
It's half way.

465
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,951
- It's dangling by a vein!
- Whoo! Oh, man!

466
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,328
It's crazy,
I can still see out of it!

467
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:13,830
-Goddamn, it hurts!
-I think I'm gonna puke.

468
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:17,208
It's just going round and round like
a tassel on a stripper's titty!

469
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,877
Okay, gotta get it, gotta get it!

470
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,504
I'm getting dizzy!

471
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,255
Got it, got it, got it!

472
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,339
Yeah!

473
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,133
Ah!

474
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:28,094
Oh, Lord! Holy shit.

475
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,974
You done it, partner.
Welcome to the Left-Eye Gang.

476
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,100
Whoo!

477
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,436
I did it!

478
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,605
I'm glad that's done.

479
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,567
Let's just go get that
Injun-loving son of a bitch, huh?

480
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,693
Yeah.

481
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,861
-Yeah! Let's get him.
-Yeah.

482
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,155
Like, so...

483
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,324
Oh, I touched the hole.
I touched the hole!

484
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,204
Got me a patch!

485
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,085
Dear Mama,
you may be wondering

486
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:04,339
why I have not returned
from my trip to the ice cream store.

487
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:08,802
It's because I met my brothers,
Ramon and Tommy.

488
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,054
And we're trying to steal money.

489
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,683
We need the money
to give to the bad men

490
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:19,605
who took Pa away
to the land of the singing windmill.

491
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:24,568
Tommy says it's not okay
to take money from decent folks.

492
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,652
I got the money!

493
00:32:25,736 --> 00:32:28,489
Luckily, there's a lot of bad people
here in the West.

494
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,156
Yee-haw!

495
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,450
Let's ride!

496
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,955
- Eat it! You know you like it.

497
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,749
You know you like it.

498
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,626
Good God!

499
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,211
Good burro!

500
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,546
That's right.

501
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,631
Enjoy it!

502
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,134
-That's just wrong.
-Yeah, yeah.

503
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,218
Is it?

504
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,403
This is so much better
than the cantaloupe.

505
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,493
Good burro!

506
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:17,328
Slowly, but surely,

507
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:22,167
we're chippin' away
at the $50,000 we need to save Pa.

508
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,670
That's a lot of money,
isn't it, Mama?

509
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,380
Mama?

510
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,512
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm writing you a letter.

511
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:38,850
Anyways, I can't wait
to actually meet my pa.

512
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:41,477
I want him to teach me
how you make babies.

513
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:45,023
And how the lady poops 'em out.

514
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,568
Be home quick as I can.

515
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:50,862
Your loving son, Lil Pete.

516
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,429
Tommy?

517
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,306
Yeah, Lil Pete?

518
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:21,142
Where's the singing windmill?

519
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,770
It's where dad made
his biggest score.

520
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,941
Maybe we'll get another clue
up at Jawbone Falls.

521
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,444
That's where he used to hide out
when he was an outlaw.

522
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,656
Oh, cool beans.

523
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,578
Tommy?

524
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,580
Yeah, Lil Pete?

525
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,540
If we get caught stealing...

526
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,918
would we be in trouble?

527
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,506
I reckon we'll hang.

528
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,428
Well... that's no bother.

529
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,431
I got a real strong neck.

530
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:04,477
Mama makes me pull the plow with my head
if I don't finish my schoolwork.

531
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,230
Which occurs regularilly.

532
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,860
Strong neck might come in handy.

533
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,821
Okay, let's get our rest.

534
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,283
Good night, Tommy.

535
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,036
Good night, Lil Pete.

536
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,538
Good night, Ramon.

537
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,040
Good night, brothers.

538
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,208
Good night, Burro.

539
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:33,173
That's a dry one.

540
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,216
We will have good dry weather tomorrow.

541
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,481
Shoo, fly!

542
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,692
Shoo!

543
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:57,322
Oh, come on, fly, vámonos!
We need our sleep.

544
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,328
Let me take care of this.

545
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,163
How can you see a fly in the dark?

546
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,499
A true hunter sees
with all his senses.

547
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,007
That was some mystical shit, man.

548
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,553
Uh-oh.

549
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,014
I think you just nicked his biscuits off.

550
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,266
That's what I was aiming for.

551
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,019
He didn't deserve to die.

552
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,606
He deserved to know
he was not welcome here.

553
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,567
Raised by Indians, huh?

554
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,737
That had some impact on you.

555
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,783
Well, let me get this one.

556
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,877
Sounded like a horse fly.

557
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,755
That wasn't a horse fly,
that was my horse!

558
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,297
Peanut?

559
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,174
Oh, Peanut!

560
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,470
Oh, the burro's gonna be pissed.

561
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,223
You're doing bueno, Burro!

562
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,184
Don't be intimidated by the horse,
you're just as good as him.

563
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:10,186
I'm so hungry.

564
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,397
There's breakfast all around.

565
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,277
Nuts, berries, bark,
different kinds of mud.

566
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,529
I wish there were taco trees.

567
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,072
What's a taco?

568
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,573
They're the best.

569
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,286
Meat and cheese and tomatoes
in a crispy shell.

570
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,788
You'd love it, man.

571
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,290
Ooh, I want one.
I want 50.

572
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,043
Hate to put an end
to this fascinating conversation,

573
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,127
but we're here.

574
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,797
--Jawbone Falls.

575
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,509
And there's a mansion next to it!

576
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,726
Should we just go in?

577
00:37:51,812 --> 00:37:53,646
I reckon.

578
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,199
Hello?

579
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,702
Hola.

580
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:14,334
Well, this is cozy.

581
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,175
Hello?

582
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,353
Hold on!

583
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,188
Tommy!

584
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,949
Stop! Leave my brother alone!

585
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,118
No, no, no!

586
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,411
Simon says, "Stop!"

587
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,039
Don't hurt my brother!

588
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,250
-Stop!
-Huh?

589
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,673
Good thinking, Tommy.

590
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,758
All right.

591
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,052
Not for me, but good one, Tommy.

592
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,806
Settle, settle, watch it...

593
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,851
It's all right, it's all right...

594
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,979
We don't mean no harm.

595
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,190
- We're just looking for our dad.
- Sí.

596
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,775
Is this your place?

597
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,569
Whose place is it?

598
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,242
Your mother?

599
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,786
--Oh, is she here right now?

600
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,166
Oh, she's dead.

601
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,003
I'm so sorry,
I'm sure she was a good woman.

602
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,713
She died three years ago?

603
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:44,966
Three months ago?

604
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:49,595
Oh, your mama has three nipples?

605
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:50,805
Huh?

606
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,436
- Yeah, there's three of us.

607
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,771
- Three of us, sí.
- Okay. Okay.

608
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,648
Claro, tres. Sí. Sí.

609
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,651
Whoo-hoo!

610
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,404
You and your mom were making
moonshine up here, huh?

611
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,156
Much obliged.

612
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,865
Gracias.

613
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,412
Making moonshine for Frank Stockburn?

614
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,039
You know Frank Stockburn?

615
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,293
He slept here?

616
00:40:21,962 --> 00:40:23,129
With your mama?

617
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,386
Okay.

618
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,770
Your mama was an owl.

619
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,108
No, our dad made his mom
make owl noises.

620
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:44,484
Huh?

621
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,821
Yeah, that's right, friend.
We're your brothers.

622
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,907
Gall dang!

623
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:00,583
Okay.

624
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,961
-Down the hatch, boys!
-Salud. Salud.

625
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,007
What's your name, anyways?

626
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:19,310
H... R... M...

627
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,231
Squiggly line, asterisk.

628
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,235
How 'bout we just call you Herm?

629
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,946
Herm, so you know,

630
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:34,575
our dad was kidnapped
by some bad muchachos.

631
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,077
--Yeah,

632
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,538
- we need money to get him back.

633
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,581
So we're going to steal the money.

634
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:46,171
No, we're only stealing the money
from folks what are bad.

635
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:47,672
Hmm...

636
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:53,803
So do you know of any place where we could
steal a lot of money from some bad folks?

637
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,513
Mmm...

638
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,391
He's got something.

639
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,814
The Gold Nugget Saloon, huh?

640
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,275
I reckon you're coming with us?

641
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,199
Smoking Fox
so worried about White Knife.

642
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,242
We must get her to eat something.

643
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:19,537
Oh, we having a little picnic here, huh?

644
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,664
You have no right to be here!
This Apache land!

645
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,334
And what you gonna do about it,
beaver breath?

646
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,127
How he know my name?

647
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,671
--That's really her name!

648
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,302
Yeah, I think you also could have
gone with "Face Like Witch."

649
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,054
Or "Eats Like Pig."

650
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,847
Or "Hit In Face With Diarrhea Stick."

651
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,685
That's it? Nobody else?
Babyface? Stumbles?

652
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:45,813
Hey, boss! Look what I got here!

653
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,941
He ain't gonna be
happy about this.

654
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:52,195
Well, well, well.

655
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,537
Yep, used to be a prosperous town.

656
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:06,251
Then the gold mine dried up
and the train stopped stopping.

657
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:09,837
The saloon's the only place left that
still does a good business.

658
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,217
Open day and night since they built it.
Ain't even a lock on the front door.

659
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,551
It never closes.

660
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,889
They got a big ol' golden nugget
hanging above the fireplace.

661
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,974
Folks come from all over
just to take a look.

662
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,060
They say it's worth about $20,000, easy.

663
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:27,605
All right.

664
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:35,696
I'm surprised no one's ever tried
to stolen that nugget.

665
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,573
- Oh, folks have tried.

666
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:40,868
If you go in there, you see their thumbs
hanging above the bar.

667
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,037
Smiley Harris, the owner,
bit them clean off.

668
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,872
So nobody messes with Smiley.

669
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,129
That sort of tickled.

670
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,923
What we got going over here, friend?

671
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,259
Just open your robe, please.

672
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,970
Ooh...

673
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,765
I have never seen that big of a rash...

674
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,559
or infection

675
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,853
or whatever this green bubble is.

676
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,439
Hmm.

677
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:10,606
All right.

678
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,152
Yeah.

679
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:21,617
Now, son, I would simply recommend
that you stop doing

680
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,953
whatever it is you've been doing,

681
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,206
with whoever...

682
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:28,791
or whatever you've been doing it with.

683
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,219
Yep, now they call him Smiley,

684
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:43,348
'cause even when committing
the most unspeakable atrocities,

685
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,476
a cheerful grin never leaves his face.

686
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,688
All right, just lift your tail
for me, please.

687
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,359
Now, he's why that nugget
has never been stolen.

688
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,403
And never will be stolen.

689
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,285
This'll prevent infection.

690
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,583
It tastes good, too.

691
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:15,921
This Smiley fella, sounds more like
a hooligan than a barkeep.

692
00:45:16,005 --> 00:45:17,257
You're not far off.

693
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,008
Rumor has it that back in the old days

694
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,135
he used to run
with the Frank Stockburn Gang.

695
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,179
Lip balm?

696
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,391
I reckon I'm good.

That Smiley fellow,
he don't joke around.

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,314
Oh... I joke around...

708
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,732
but never when it comes to my business.

709
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:19,193
Welcome to the Gold Nugget, gentlemen.

710
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,530
Mr. Harris,
it's quite a nice spread you got here.

711
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,574
So what brings you gentlemen to town?

712
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:29,119
Actually, we wanted to ask you
about something, Mr. Harris.

713
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,621
Excuse me.

714
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:35,250
I am conversing with these gentlemen, sir.
I shall be with you in a moment.

715
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:38,338
I need to talk to you about
Frank Stockburn.

716
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,177
I haven't heard that name in many a year.

717
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,346
You know him.

718
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,264
Mr. Stockburn and I
were business partners.

719
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,476
I got a photograph.

720
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:55,771
You see, that there's him...
and that's you.

721
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,565
You rode in his gang.

722
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:01,318
To be precise...
it was our gang.

723
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:04,071
He went on to a criminal career
of some renown,

724
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,575
while I achieved great success
in the legitimate business world.

725
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,034
Please help me.

726
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,078
Sir, you are becoming a nuisance.

727
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,623
I just need to tell him what I've done.

728
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,943
I think he's had enough, boss.

729
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,490
Yes.

730
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,242
My apologies, gentlemen.

731
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,453
Not my favorite subject.

732
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:54,664
A round on the house.

733
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:59,544
And, Chico, if you ever
grab my arm like that again,

734
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,462
I'll put six bullets in your head.

735
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,132
--That's quite a beating.

736
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,760
Hope you and your drink are okay.

737
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,597
Why do you want to meet
this Frank Stockburn so badly, huh?

738
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,766
Frank Stockburn's my father.

739
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,480
If Frank Stockburn is your father,
raise your hand.

740
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,526
Gall dang!

741
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,539
Chico's right.
Getting late, starting to thin out.

742
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,375
Can I tell you guys something?

743
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,837
Because I don't wanna have
no secrets between us.

744
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,046
Of course.

745
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,090
-Yeah, we're brothers.
-Yeah.

746
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:50,470
Now, I know Dad is a white man,
but my mother...

747
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,262
was actually black.

748
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:56,058
So that, technically,
makes me half-black.

749
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,935
Is that right?

750
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,562
Well, I didn't wanna hide that from you

751
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,439
in case you guys slipped up
and made some racial slurs

752
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,818
-not knowing I wasn't 100% white.
-Hmm.

753
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,278
I mean, I knew she must've
been really muscular,

754
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,656
but I had no idea she was black.

755
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:11,782
Yeah, I mean, I guess,

756
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,826
now that you mention it,
I see it a little bit.

757
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,705
My mother's Swedish.

758
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,625
I don't think so.
I reckon she's Mexican.

759
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,086
Lying bitch!

760
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,923
So do you new brothers
have any special skills

761
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,050
that could help us out here tonight?

762
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,135
Like what?

763
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,596
Like, you know,
Tommy's good with knives.

764
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,056
- Lil Pete's got a bonus nipple.

765
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,725
I got a burro.

766
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,646
Herm is good at strangling.

767
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,399
-Huh?
-I can hold my breath for six minutes.

768
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,152
Well, I can play the piano with my dick.

769
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,363
Well, we're unstoppable then.

770
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:55,993
Anyways, any of you handsome brothers
ready to go steal a big hunk of gold?

771
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,037
-I'm ready.
-I'm hungry.

772
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,622
-I'm drunk.
-And I'm Lil Pete.

773
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,042
Let's get that nugget then.

774
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,085
Oh...

775
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,672
You've got some pair of huevos
coming into my place, son.

776
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,549
I sure am sorry
about what happened, Mr. Harris.

777
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,135
In fact, I'd like to buy you a drink...

778
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,888
of the good stuff,
if that's okay?

779
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:02,685
Barkeep, you got any scotch,
real scotch, from scotch-land?

780
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:09,358
We keep the imported stuff in the back.
I'll go and fetch it for you.

781
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,776
That's wonderful.

782
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,836
Now, I didn't hear that,
did you?

783
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,295
I did.

784
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,904
I don't know,
maybe I'm turned round.

785
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,907
I thought that, like,
tonight was gonna be Fajita Friday

786
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,950
or line dancing or something.

787
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,412
It just seems quiet, but y'all be good.
Stay warm.

788
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,040
-Hey, he's got the thumbs!
-They came with the pants!

789
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,713
Right on the rocks,
right on the rocks.

790
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:15,340
Oh, you're gaining on me!
You're gaining on me!

791
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,218
You don't even understand
what we're gonna do to--

792
00:52:22,682 --> 00:52:24,975
Teach them not to mess
with the Stockburn brothers!

793
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,948
Smiley...

794
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,251
I'm watching you!

795
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,837
Who's that?

796
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,883
Ladies.

797
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:05,599
What's behind door number three?

798
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:15,650
Okay, ladies, take your clothes off
and start punching me in the face.

799
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:16,777
--Sorry, carry on.

800
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,738
Hallelujah!

801
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:26,286
Smiley,
why don't you visit your grandma...

802
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,038
In hell!

803
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,102
Smiley.

804
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:54,481
You cannot
escape me, Smiley!

805
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,739
Give me my thumbs back.

806
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,748
It's too big, Lil Pete!

807
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,000
What's too big?

808
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,128
Uh... plan B's too big?

809
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,712
What the hell is plan B?

810
00:54:17,797 --> 00:54:19,423
Let me show you.

811
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:21,258
Plan B!

812
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,574
Yeah, works better if you have knives.

813
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,577
Yeah, that makes sense.

814
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,912
Come on.

815
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,623
You can take 'em!
Come on!

816
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,168
I got the nugget! I got the nugget!
What do we do?

817
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,920
-He's shooting like a madman!
-Come on!

818
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,047
- Big bullets! Big bullets!
- Come on! Come on!

819
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,303
- Next man who moves will die!

820
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,309
Who are you people?

821
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,651
We are the Stockburn brothers.

822
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,612
Frank's kids?

823
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,954
Well... this is interesting.

824
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,457
You know, the last time
I saw your father was in Utah.

825
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,834
Just rang up our biggest score.

826
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,670
But when we was dividing it up,

827
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,673
we started having trouble
with the arithmetic.

828
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,928
And somehow I ended up
abandoned beside a windmill,

829
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:52,641
knife stuck in my guts,
left to die like a dog.

830
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:55,060
Frank had taken it all.

831
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:58,230
But now, I get to take something.

832
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:02,526
The lives of his five ridiculous sons.

833
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:07,739
Don't forget about número seis!

834
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,329
Holy moly!

835
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,956
No! Hell, no!

836
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,850
He's giving himself
six bullets to the head!

837
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:38,103
And he's still smiling!

838
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,366
I was just trying to knock him out.

839
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,037
Well, you succeeded.

840
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,956
I don't think he's waking up
from that one.

841
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,915
You done a number on him, Ramon.

842
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,459
You did!
You did a number there.

843
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,794
-Yeah, you did!
-Hey! Hey!

844
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,853
Plan B was officially insane!

845
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,152
Here you are, Danny.
It's an old Apache remedy.

846
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,241
Clears your head after too much firewater.

847
00:57:32,324 --> 00:57:36,161
You know everything, Tommy.
Where'd you learn all this stuff?

848
00:57:36,245 --> 00:57:38,163
My father taught me.

849
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:41,500
Dad? I thought you just met him last week.

850
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,794
Not our father. Screaming Eagle.

851
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,713
He raised me since I was a kid.

852
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,884
He's the kindest...
wisest man I've ever known.

853
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,052
Wow...

854
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,180
must've been nice to have a dad.

855
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,558
Oh, yeah, someone to wrastle with

856
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,894
and teach you how
to cut up your panny-cakes.

857
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:05,565
Someone to give you advice
when you screwed up real, real bad.

858
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,360
Well, we do got a dad.

859
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,905
And we're gonna see him real soon.

860
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,618
Yeah... I can't wait.

861
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,496

Okay, boys.

900
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,797
I'm gonna check this out.

901
01:01:18,842 --> 01:01:22,136
The ball is in your hand,
twist the leg, then you let it go!

902
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,972
Now, let me see.
Ready, men?

903
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:27,476
No, no, no!

904
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,187
You're not listening to me, Hung Shin!

905
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,022
You have to be very precise.

906
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,567
Precise...

907
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,068
I say!

908
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,320
You there!

909
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,490
I have a proposition.

910
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:44,951
How would you men like to participate

911
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,121
in the birth of something extraordinary?

912
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:52,292
Well, we ain't got time for that,
but you can have your brown thing back.

913
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,754
What's so damnably important

914
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,215
that you need to miss
your rendezvous with history?

915
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:01,175
We gotta save our daddy,
Frank Stockburn.

916
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,719
Frank Stockburn, the outlaw?

917
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:05,138
-You know our dad?
-Without a doubt.

918
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,807
One of the best poker players
I've ever played against.

919
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:12,896
I played him in Ezekiel Grant's
annual Valentine's Day game down in Yuma.

920
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:17,859
Thousands of dollars on the table,
but Stockburn doesn't bat an eyelash.

921
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:21,780
He happen to mention anything
about what his biggest score was?

922
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,199
Over in Utah?
A guy named Smiley Harris?

923
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,702
I'll make you a deal.

924
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:31,790
Help me out a bit
and I'll tell you all I know.

925
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,543
Deal. Tommy Dunson.

926
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:38,255
Abner Doubleday.
Let's play ball.

927
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:49,433
Welcome, my friends, to the first ever
playing of a new sport.

928
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:53,395
A sport of my own devising.

929
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:59,693
On this field, two ten-person teams
will engage in a battle of--

930
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,235
Yes, Qi?

931
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:04,072
Only 18 people here.

932
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:11,580
Two nine-person teams will engage in
a battle of strength, speed, and strategy.

933
01:03:11,663 --> 01:03:16,376
One team will go out onto
the field to play defense

934
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:21,089
while the other team
will take turns hitting this ball...

935
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,008
with a stickie.

936
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:26,177
What are you gonna call this game?

937
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,512
What else?

938
01:03:27,596 --> 01:03:30,264
Stickie McSchnickens.

939
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:37,439
Now your goal, ball thrower,
is to get the ball past me two times

940
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:39,107
without my hitting it.

941
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,276
Fire when ready.

942
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,200
I didn't know you were going
to toss it quite so hard, ball thrower.

943
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:50,284
All right.

944
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,043
Okay, that's two past ya.
So you're done, right?

945
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:01,212
No, no, I said three times.

946
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,047
No, you said two.

947
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:05,925
I said three!
Three strikes and I'm out.

948
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,845
I know what I said, shortstop.

949
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,099
That's your new name.
Short Stop, that's right.

950
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,934
Now and forever.
Forever and ever!

951
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:17,020
Short Stop.
Short Stop, Short Stop.

952
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,146
Short Stop.

953
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:21,608
Yes, all right.

954
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,028
Strike three!
You're out!

955
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:29,240
No, no, the ball was... too low.

956
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:34,371
In order for it to count as a strike,
it has to pass through the...

957
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:35,705
strike zone.

958
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:37,457
-Strike zone?
-That's right.

959
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:41,961
And if you don't get the ball past me,
between my knees and my titties,

960
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:43,212
it's not a strike.

961
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:44,798
It's a non-strike.

962
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,508
And if you throw me four non-strikes,

963
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,636
I get an express ticket to first base
without my even hitting it.

964
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,430
Oh.

965
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:52,931
All right, are we ready?

966
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,689
That also gets me to first base...
as well.

967
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,242
Where you going?
Nobody hit it.

968
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:16,538
I stole the base.
You weren't looking, so I stole it.

969
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,749
You said you could only advance
after you hit the ball!

970
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,043
Not when you're stealing.

971
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,753
That's bullshit.

972
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:25,088
Okay, Short Stop.

973
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,023
He's moving!

974
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,694
Safe!

975
01:05:54,743 --> 01:05:55,744
Gall dang, I don't know.

976
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:58,830
-That was a tie.
-Yes, and tie goes to the runner!

977
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,499
Why's that?

978
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:04,919
Because those are the rules
of Stickie McSchnickens, that's why.

979
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,674
All right, it's all mine,
I've got it!

980
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:12,969
No! No, you can't run.
You cannot run.

981
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:16,973
Infield fly rule... in full effect.

982
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:20,769
You're out.

983
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,230
- Here we go, Herm.
- Okay, Herm!

984
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,356
Yeah.

985
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,655
Oh!

986
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,532
Oh, I'm not getting that.

987
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,741
Yeah, bueno!

988
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:38,828
You can just run all the way home.
A home runner.

989
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,956
I need a cold drink.

990
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,752
Let's take a five-minute stretch
and then start the second half.

991
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,546
Mr. Doubleday, we're done.

992
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:49,673
But we've only played nine innings.

993
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:53,510
Nine innings is enough.
Tell us about Dad's biggest score.

994
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,178
Fine.

995
01:06:55,261 --> 01:07:01,643
Your father and his gang knocked off
an entire cavalry regiment, 120 men,

996
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:04,187
five trunks filled with Yankee money.

997
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:06,648
Where'd that happen?

998
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:09,651
Up at Sweet Hog Rock...

999
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,611
100 miles due north.

1000
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,446
You'll know it when you see it.

1001
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,281
Well, fellas,

1002
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:19,368
looks like we're going to Sweet Hog Rock
to find ourselves a singing windmill.

1003
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,162
But we still need another 10,000 bucks.

1004
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:23,582
I reckon we'll make a quick stop, then.

1005
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:25,416
Before you go...

1006
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:28,461
do you wanna line up and shake hands
and say "good game" to each other?

1007
01:07:29,087 --> 01:07:30,088
No.

1008
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,592
Them boys were nice fellers.

1009
01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,970
Paid in cash.
Kept the profanity to a minimum.

1010
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,974
And the Mexican brother knocked
this hard-ass' head off with a shovel?

1011
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:44,811
Dang thing flew nearly 40 feet!
And still a-smilin'.

1012
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,895
Oh! Man!

1013
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,397
And hasn't stopped yet.

1014
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:57,156
Oh, hell, no!
My man gluing on heads and shit!

1015
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,743
Wish he'd glue the head back on my pecker.

1016
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,285
What happened to your pecker?

1017
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,623
I was part of another gang
before I joined up with y'all.

1018
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:05,790
Texas Stubbies.

1019
01:08:05,874 --> 01:08:09,127
Okay,
never mind all that. Okay?

1020
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:13,840
Now, Doc, you know which way
them there Ridiculous 6 rode off to?

1021
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,509
We're traveling
with a friend of theirs who, uh...

1022
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,678
- will be real excited to see them.

1023
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:21,139
Well, they headed up north
to the Turquoise Trail.

1024
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:23,850
I can show you on the map over here.

1025
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,688
Looking forward to seeing
your man beg for his life?

1026
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,108
'Cause that's what's gonna happen,
Smoking Fox.

1027
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,736
Chicken pox!

1028
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:37,739
We're gaining on his
Injun-loving ass every day.

1029
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,365
He messed with the Left-Eye Gang!

1030
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:40,617
He's gonna be like,

1031
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:47,290
"Wait, how did you find me, and where...
How did you get my girl?"

1032
01:08:47,373 --> 01:08:51,502
And then old Dumb Knife's gonna realize
that he's in way over his head.

1033
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:58,467
See, when George Washington
invented America...

1034
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,821
Excuse me, Sheriff.

1035
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,698
Is there a church in this town?

1036
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:22,951
This is Rattler's Gulch, you halfwit.

1037
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:26,788
The meanest, crookedest,
most hellacious town in the West.

1038
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,458
We don't need no preacher telling us
what we can and cannot do.

1039
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,294
So it's all right
if I do this to your wife?

1040
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:58,111
I can't wait to see all you nice people
when I'm dangling!

1041
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,653
You sick bastard.

1042
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:01,280
Get this over with.

1043
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:05,159
You're in for a real treat today.
This is gonna be so much fun.

1044
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,254
I'm just messing with y'all.
I'm fine!

1045
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,174
I call this one Fish Out of Water.

1046
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:33,687
♪ He flies through the air
with the greatest of ease ♪

1047
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:37,566
♪ That daring young man
on the flying trapeze ♪

1048
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,235
Yeah!

1049
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,201
Yeah!

1050
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,496
Herm, put the hookers back.

1051
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,624
Come on!

1052
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:00,924
Yeah, you can't catch me!

1053
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:06,888
He ain't dying, Billy!
He's making a fool of you!

1054
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,514
Whoo-hoo!

1055
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,598
All right, that's it!

1056
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,475
We'll shoot the son of a bitch!

1057
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:13,186
--On my command!

1058
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,354
- Ready...

1059
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:16,730
Aim...

1060
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,108
Fire!

1061
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:28,827
Wind took him, Tommy.
Came damn close.

1062
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:31,120
I'm okay!

1063
01:11:31,204 --> 01:11:33,414
Come on, Billy!
Get him!

1064
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:35,041
We did it!

1065
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,172
I told ya
I got a strong neck!

1066
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:44,508
♪ Yippie-yo-yo-yea ♪

1067
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,344
♪ Won't be so sad ♪

1068
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:48,262
♪ Yippie-yo-yo-yea ♪

1069
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:50,556
♪ We're gonna save Dad ♪

1070
01:11:54,602 --> 01:11:57,480
We still gotta get to Sweet Hog Rock
before they do.

1071
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:00,066
Gotta find that singing windmill,
so it ain't over yet.

1072
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,359
We got the money!

1073
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,528
- The Ridiculous 6 got all the money!
- Yeah!

1074
01:12:04,612 --> 01:12:05,696
Yeah!

1075
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:11,035
Tommy! Tommy! What's Dad like?
Is he funny?

1076
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:12,703
Yeah, is he a good listener?

1077
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:14,205
Is he strong?

1078
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:22,088
All great questions.
I'll tell you this.

1079
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,090
I think you guys are gonna love him.

1080
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:28,177
But I'm sure he's gonna love you guys.

1081
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:33,224
So sorry to interrupt
such a tender moment.

1082
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,394
Looks like we stumbled
on bath day, boys!

1083
01:12:38,146 --> 01:12:40,773
I heard you picked up some brothers
along the way, tough guy.

1084
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,859
But I don't see no resemblance.

1085
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:46,529
- I do, they all look like my butthole.

1086
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,700
So guess what time it is, boys?

1087
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,077
Payback time!

1088
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:56,539
Any last words,
No Knife?

1089
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:05,006
I told ya I could hold my breath good.

1090
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:06,299
Yeah, Danny boy!

1091
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,093
What are you doing, man?
We gotta go!

1092
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:14,140
-Oh, jackpot, boys!
-No!

1093
01:13:15,349 --> 01:13:17,143
- That's ours!
- Hyah!

1094
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:22,440
Rusty!

1095
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,858
Rusty, no, come back!

1096
01:13:24,943 --> 01:13:25,985
No.

1097
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:41,918
How are we gonna save him?
We're startin' all over.

1098
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:44,337
Is there any more good places
we can rob?

1099
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,132
You know like a burro-grooming place
or a shoe store for burros?

1100
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,552
Half the lawmen in the West
are already looking for us.

1101
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:54,305
So what?
Look, we can't stop.

1102
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,639
They're going to kill him!

1103
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:58,101
Ain't no difference.
He's dying anyways.

1104
01:14:02,146 --> 01:14:03,814
Dad's sick.

1105
01:14:04,983 --> 01:14:06,609
I'm sorry I didn't tell y'all.

1106
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,946
There's a good chance
he's dead already.

1107
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:16,660
But there's a chance he's not.
You got to meet him, Tommy.

1108
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:18,662
The rest of us...

1109
01:14:18,746 --> 01:14:21,249
Even if it was just for five minutes,
it'd be worth it.

1110
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:27,130
If I don't talk to Dad, I'll die with this
dirty secret burnin' a hole in my guts.

1111
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:31,884
Danito, whatever it is you did,
you have to forgive yourself, man.

1112
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,303
You wouldn't say that if you know
what I done.

1113
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,847
- Everybody's got secrets, Danny.
- Yeah.

1114
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,308
You guys are the first people
I told I was black.

1115
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,852
You know how good that made me feel?

1116
01:14:41,935 --> 01:14:44,022
We're your brothers.

1117
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:46,107
You can tell us anything.

1118
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:48,985
I, uh...

1119
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:55,074
I used to work
for the President of the United States.

1120
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,869
I was his personal bodyguard.

1121
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,122
One of the best.

1122
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,916
Till one night...

1123
01:15:08,962 --> 01:15:12,216
Mr. President, say, I'm gonna go
hit the little boys' room.

1124
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:14,552
Are you shitting me?

1125
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,887
Come on!
You'll be fine, superstar.

1126
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:20,224
Can I get ya something on the way back?
Agua? Brewski?

1127
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:21,434
No!

1128
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,728
Mrs. Lincoln, how about one of them
big pretzels or a little pillow?

1129
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:26,730
I hear this play's kind of a long one.

1130
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:30,359
All right, fair enough.
I'll be back in two.

1131
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,327
Where's the president's box?

1132
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:42,038
-John Wilkes Booth, the actor?
-Yeah.

1133
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:44,873
No way, man! Big fan!

1134
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,792
-You wanna say hi to the president?
-Yeah.

1135
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,503
He'd get a real kick out of that.
Last door on the left.

1136
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,589
- Thank you.
- Really cool.

1137
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:54,092
Wow! Love that guy!

1138
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:03,601
Abe!

1139
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,485
How can you go on living your life
knowing you harmed so many people?

1140
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,403
That's what I wanna ask Dad.

1141
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:17,865
Hey, you ain't the one
who pulled that trigger.

1142
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,909
But if Dad's gotta be
the one who tells you that...

1143
01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:24,830
then let's go get that money.

1144
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,416
I just wish I knew how.

1145
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:32,296
Herm's got an idea.

1146
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,091
He just can't express it.

1147
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,802
I just wish somebody here
could speak Herm.

1148
01:16:45,476 --> 01:16:47,770
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

1149
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:52,400
That's when Ezekiel Grant has his annual
high-stakes poker game.

1150
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:56,237
There'll be oodles of money there.
Oodles, I say.

1151
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,780
Ooh.

1152
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,866
-I don't know. That sounds risky.
-What's risky?

1153
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:05,163
He's suggesting we...
knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.

1154
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:06,497
- It's in Yuma tomorrow night.

1155
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,832
Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.

1156
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,670
That poker game, there's practically
gonna be an army protectin' it.

1157
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:16,924
If Tommy says we can beat 'em,
I'll believe him.

1158
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:19,968
- We all will.

1159
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:23,556
We can beat 'em...

1160
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:25,974
for Dad.

1161
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:27,685
For Dad!

1162
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,662
I hope you like the gift I'm giving you
for Valentine's Day, Ezekiel.

1163
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:51,083
I'll give you a hint.
One-hour massage, no charge.

1164
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,461
Oh, Susannah.

1165
01:17:53,544 --> 01:17:55,421
You know what gift I'd really love?

1166
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,174
If you would just shut up!

1167
01:17:58,799 --> 01:18:01,594
Nothing ruins a good poker game more...

1168
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,473
than a lady jabbering on and on...

1169
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,766
- How romantic.

1170
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,687
-Hello!
-Hello!

1171
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,147
Well, General Custer!

1172
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:15,566
Yes, at your service.

1173
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:17,193
Mr. Mark Twain.

1174
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:19,320
-Word up!
-Gentlemen, do come in.

1175
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:23,991
Yo, Zeke, big boy, I was just going off
to the General here about my new book.

1176
01:18:24,074 --> 01:18:26,285
-It's a sequel to Tom Sawyer.
-Ooh.

1177
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:29,247
It's about Sawyer's home slice,
Huckleberry Finn.

1178
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:33,166
White boy goes raftin' with a brother.
People gonna lose their shit!

1179
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:38,589
And, General Custer, I see you've let
your dashing blond hair grow out.

1180
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,842
Well, yes, the barber down at
the regiment is just awful,

1181
01:18:41,925 --> 01:18:45,596
so I had two choices,
either let it grow or get scalped.

1182
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:48,391
- And I ain't gonna let that happen.

1183
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:51,352
Now, will our old friend
from Tombstone be joining us?

1184
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:52,478
Late as usual.

1185
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:57,941
But we have a new player,
a wealthy Mexican coffee bean rancher.

1186
01:18:58,025 --> 01:18:59,109
Am I tardy-o?

1187
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:02,154
Oh.  Sneaky little Mexican.

1188
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:05,616
May I present Don Don Diego.

1189
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:11,204
We run a gentleman's game here, Mr. Diego.

1190
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:14,833
Your, uh, two bodyguards
are completely unnecessary.

1191
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,752
Bodyguards?

1192
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,380
You're mistaken, General.

1193
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,382
This is, um...

1194
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:25,511
Chimichanga... my loyal manservant.

1195
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:28,347
God bless you.

1196
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:29,932
And, um...

1197
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:33,644
Blanco Beardio.

1198
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:37,773
He'll be providing the entertainment
for this afternoon's festivities.

1199
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,358
Well, drop me a beat.

1200
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:46,365
Okay.

1201
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:49,117
All right.

1202
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:52,705
Here we go now.

1203
01:19:59,337 --> 01:20:02,673
Gentlemen, the buy-in is $15,000.

1204
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:04,174
Fifteen large?

1205
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:06,009
Are you sure General Custard
can swing that?

1206
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:10,556
It's Custer, not "Custard."
There is no "D." I'm not a dessert.

1207
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,476
Boom, I just dropped some satire
on your ass, General!

1208
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,144
You got me!

1209
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:20,273
Hey! Now, when Ramon gives
the signal that the time is right,

1210
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:21,775
that's when we move in.

1211
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,319
You remember the signal, right?

1212
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:31,619
- Gentlemen.
- You know where to go, Marshal.

1213
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,662
Oh, hell, no!

1214
01:20:33,746 --> 01:20:35,581
That's Wyatt Earp!

1215
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,000
The fastest gun in the West?

1216
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,004
All right, all right, all right!

1217
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:45,466
- Oh, Wyatt Earp, as I live and breathe!
- Wyatt Earp.

1218
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,259
- You're here!
- Wyatt Earp.

1219
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,761
Sorry I'm late, everybody.

1220
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:53,056
But apparently, there's some new gang
out there robbing everybody blind.

1221
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:54,850
Oh, they call themselves
the Ridiculous 6.

1222
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,479
I swear, a man can't ride
five miles in this territory

1223
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:02,024
without running into outlaws,
rattlesnakes, Injuns and--

1224
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,985
Hey! Why don't you let me
worry about the Injuns?

1225
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,320
--Will do, General.

1226
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,074
What's shakin', Twain?

1227
01:21:11,158 --> 01:21:13,744
Hey, I'm good on anything.
Just like gravy, baby.

1228
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:15,621
-Good to see you, my man.
-You too, man.

1229
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,374
Hey! I finally read Prince and the Pauper.

1230
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,708
Oh, is that right?

1231
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:21,043
Didn't get it.

1232
01:21:22,044 --> 01:21:23,128
For reals?

1233
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,132
- Satire! Boom! I got ya!

1234
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,135
-I'm just pulling your leg.
-Oh, man.

1235
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:31,679
I can't read.

1236
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,892
Good one with the... satire.

1237
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,727
Funny.

1238
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,064
Who's this idiot?

1239
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,610
Um... I am Don...

1240
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:48,320
Don Don Diego.

1241
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,657
Well, Don, I'm Wyatt...

1242
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,950
Wyatt Wyatt Earp.

1243
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,623
Got him.

1244
01:21:59,707 --> 01:22:04,420
Now let's play
some cards!

1245
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,803
♪ Say, say Tom Sawyer ♪

1246
01:22:12,886 --> 01:22:13,929
♪ Tom Sawyer ♪

1247
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,013
♪ Say Tom Sawyer ♪

1248
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:16,557

01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,726

1253
01:22:24,523 --> 01:22:26,442
--Please calm yourself!

1254
01:22:27,568 --> 01:22:30,863
Let's get inside before this Wyatt Earp
ruins our plan.

1255
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:33,365
But there's no way for you to sneak
past them guys, Tommy.

1256
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:36,702
There's no rocks, no trees,
no nothing to hide behind.

1257
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:41,248
No need to hide, brother,
when you are friends with the wind.

1258
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:44,042
I'm telling you, down there,
they don't call it "Mexico."

1259
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:49,256
It's "Mehico." The "X" is an "H."
I'm presuming Texas is "Tehas."

1260
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,135
Now, what's this?

1261
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,763
Just a tumbleweed,
you jumpy bastard.

1262
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,907
That is some mystical shit.

1263
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,748
I wish to move the dresser
in my bedroom closer to the window,

1264
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,084
but I haven't the strength
to do it myself.

1265
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,922
I'd love to help, ma'am, but I really
should keep playing the piano.

1266
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:34,760
--No one will even know you're gone.

1267
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,851
-Gentlemen, cough up your buy-ins.
-All right!

1268
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,227
Make it rain like Twain.

1269
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:46,021
- Take that and that.
- Yeah!

1270
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:49,316
Sure is some good hooch there, Zeke.
Where'd you find that?

1271
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,862
Oh, I got that from a case
about, uh, 20 years ago.

1272
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:57,407
In fact, uh, you know that shack
up by Jawbone Falls?

1273
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:00,035
-Yeah.
-There was a lady living there.

1274
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,705
It was one of Frank Stockburn's
many paramours.

1275
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:07,459
Now this was one of the ugliest ladies
I've ever seen in my life.

1276
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:09,502
Sounds like a real bucket of turds.

1277
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:13,674
But she was a very talented
distiller of alcohol.

1278
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:16,176
So, while she--

1279
01:24:16,259 --> 01:24:19,638
While she's loading up my coach,
her young boy comes out,

1280
01:24:19,722 --> 01:24:25,268
this big shambling oaf,
mute, filthy as a hog,

1281
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:28,772
and he starts doing
this horrible little tap dance

1282
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,817
whilst singing "The Star-Spangled Banner."

1283
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:35,195
Well, not singing it, really,
but grunting it, like a caveman!

1284
01:24:35,278 --> 01:24:38,323
♪ Oh, say can you see ♪

1285
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,869
You know,
he wants me to throw him some pennies,

1286
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:43,912
so I fished a coin out of my pocket

1287
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,998
and I guess I don't know my own strength.

1288
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:49,710
I tossed it, hit him in the mouth,
and knocked his tooth out!

1289
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,463
What an asshole!

1290
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:56,049
Mama.

1291
01:24:56,675 --> 01:25:00,888
In any event, I still have
one bottle left from that case.

1292
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:05,601
I'll go fetch it and we can drink a toast
to that awful woman and her hideous son.

1293
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:10,230
Oh, she was ugly!
You wouldn't even sleep with her.

1294
01:25:14,401 --> 01:25:17,279
Say, Don Don Diego...

1295
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,656
where's your buy-in?

1296
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,532
I thought it was 15 grand a man.

1297
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,784
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1298
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,076
Uh...

1299
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:33,796
Let's see. Ah!

1300
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:48,644
It's you!

1301
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:49,853
Uh-huh.

1302
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:01,031
What?

1303
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,659
What "what"?

1304
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,618
What are you so surprised about?

1305
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:10,457
Just so surprised at all the...
the fun that we're having here,

1306
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:12,835
with the card and the money
and the booze and...

1307
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,090
You know, I make that same face when
I put my cologne on in the morning,

1308
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:20,258
especially when I'm home alone.

1309
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:21,593
You know what I think?

1310
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:25,388
I think Don Don Diego isn't really
a coffee bean rancher at all.

1311
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:29,142
And his true purpose here is to rob us.

1312
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,147
Don't make me kill you, Mr. Earp.

1313
01:26:34,231 --> 01:26:35,899
Hands up high.

1314
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:38,944
Oh, snap!
You got the drop on Wyatt Earp?

1315
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:42,572
It's mi hermano.
He's one bad hombre.

1316
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,244
No disrespect, fellas.

1317
01:26:47,327 --> 01:26:50,706
We're gonna have to tie you up,
and we'll have to borrow your horses.

1318
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:53,541
Ooh, what'd I miss?

1319
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:58,213
Sweet Hog Rock,
here we come!

1320
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,802
Giddy up, Burro.

1321
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,095
Come on, Ramon!

1322
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:20,568
Right behind you, Tommy!

1323
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,072
Hurry up, Burro!
Move your ass!

1324
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,955
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

1325
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,919
Yeah, I think we found it.

1326
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:41,131
That is one sweet hog right there.

1327
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:44,927
That is a sweet, majestic hog.

1328
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:47,345
Yeah, that's a sweet one for sure.

1329
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:49,431
It's all right.

1330
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:55,103
I'm confused.
I don't see a hog or a pig anywhere.

1331
01:27:55,187 --> 01:27:58,774
All I see is the big old rock
that looks like a weenie pee-pee.

1332
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:05,823
-Oh, you guys call a pee-pee a "hog."
-Yeah.

1333
01:28:05,906 --> 01:28:08,700
- That's weird. I like it, though.
- Yeah. Okay.

1334
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:11,494
Problem is, I don't see
no singing windmill anywhere.

1335
01:28:11,578 --> 01:28:13,455
--Wait...

1336
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,622
I hear it.

1337
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,542
Yeah, it's coming from over there.

1338
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,712
Ah! Daddy! Daddy!

1339
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:23,548
Daddy!
Huh?

1340
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:24,716
Whoa...

1341
01:28:25,843 --> 01:28:28,846
We're saved! We're saved!

1342
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:33,976
Oh, it's just these assholes.

1343
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:35,768
What the hell happened to you guys?

1344
01:28:35,853 --> 01:28:42,234
We was headed west to Frisco
after we absconded with your loot.

1345
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,864
But we ran into these real bad characters.

1346
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:50,575
It was Cicero something
and his crazy-ass gang.

1347
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:54,371
Cicero was here?
Then he left?

1348
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:58,125
He left us in the dirt for fun.

1349
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,751
--Ow! Ow, ow!

1350
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:01,503
Who does that?

1351
01:29:01,586 --> 01:29:03,922
Sicko!

1352
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:08,844
If this is where the singing windmill is,
then why would they just up and leave?

1353
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,347
Maybe that Stickie McSchnickens guy
was just pulling our leg.

1354
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:15,642
They went north...
about two hours ago.

1355
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:16,935
Oh, yeah! Tommy can track 'em.

1356
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,937
Let's saddle up.
We're burning daylight.

1357
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,063
Wait!

1358
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:22,607
You can't just leave us here,
you gotta get us out!

1359
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,151
--You don't need to-- Hey, hey, hey!

1360
01:29:24,234 --> 01:29:25,402
We still got the money!

1361
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:28,405
Yeah, I hid it in my pants.
We'll give it back to ya!

1362
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:29,948
We don't need no more.
Let's go!

1363
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:34,577
Hey! Can you at least
help me pick these ants

1364
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:37,289
out of my beard before you head out?

1365
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,623
Please?

1366
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,209
Tell you what,
we'll dig you up on one condition.

1367
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,628
--You say it, we'll do it!

1368
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:46,048
That you give up your lives of crime

1369
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:49,426
and take this second chance to start
doing good by people.

1370
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:51,886
-I'd rather die!
-Hell, no! I ain't doing that!

1371
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:54,347
No way! Dumb Indian half!

1372
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,641
That was a joke!
That was a joke!

1373
01:29:56,724 --> 01:29:59,019
I'll be a good boy!
I'll be a good boy, Daddy!

1374
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:09,446
Now what?
East or west?

1375
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,613
Whoa.

1376
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,128
Late in the day.

1377
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:27,797
Lot of traffic been going through here.

1378
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,466
It's going to take a minute.

1379
01:30:29,549 --> 01:30:32,594
Well, we must be getting mighty close.

1380
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:35,763
They'd better be treating Dad well,
or they're gonna have to answer to us.

1381
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,599
There he is.

1382
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:38,976
- There's the man himself.

1383
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:40,935
- Look at that handsome hombre.
- Yeah.

1384
01:30:41,019 --> 01:30:43,146
- That's where we get our good looks.

1385
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,398
Let me see ol' Pop.

1386
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,038
Does he still
look like that, Tommy?

1387
01:31:01,123 --> 01:31:02,207
Tommy?

1388
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:04,667
Yeah, he does.

1389
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:08,463
Let's set up camp tonight.
Right out there.

1390
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:09,881
But we can't waste any time.

1391
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:13,135
Chico... I can't figure it out right now.

1392
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:14,386
I gotta...

1393
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,471
Just give me till sunrise.
Let me think.

1394
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:47,710
Dear brothers,

1395
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:52,090
by the time you read this,
I will have caught up with Dad.

1396
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:55,968
And I'm sure you're sore at me
for sneaking out on you.

1397
01:31:56,053 --> 01:32:01,808
But this fellow, Cicero, who took Pa,
also took my mother's life,

1398
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,936
and I mean to make him pay for that.

1399
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:06,979
Things might get messy.

1400
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:10,275
I can live
with all the bad stuff we've done,

1401
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:15,822
the hold-ups, the burglaries,
the accidental decapitation,

1402
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:20,285
but I couldn't live with myself
if something happened to one of you.

1403
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:25,540
So stay put and I'll be back with Dad
as soon as I can.

1404
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:27,500
And if I don't come back,

1405
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:31,713
know that I love you boys
with all my heart.

1406
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,299
Your brother, Tommy.

1407
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:50,273
Whoa.

1408
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:01,409
Down at Silver Canyon...

1409
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:03,953
Meeting Betty Dunson...

1410
01:33:04,036 --> 01:33:07,249
was the luckiest thing
that ever happened to me.

1411
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:11,461
Mom was his biggest score.

1412
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,131
Hyah.

1413
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,223
Here we are.

1414
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:25,600
We'd better not have come
all this way for nothing.

1415
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:28,603
-I want the money, Frank.
-I know what you want.

1416
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:31,356
There's your money.

1417
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:32,607
Count it.

1418
01:33:32,690 --> 01:33:34,442
Tommy!

1419
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,818
Oh, look who showed up.

1420
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:39,322
I didn't know if somebody
dug up what you buried, Pa,

1421
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:41,991
so I wanted to make sure
you were covered either way.

1422
01:33:42,074 --> 01:33:43,910
Thank you, son.

1423
01:33:43,993 --> 01:33:45,703
Well, ain't that a good boy.

1424
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,414
That's my boy.

1425
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,916
Well, it's been a pleasure, Frank.

1426
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:51,751
But, uh...

1427
01:33:51,834 --> 01:33:53,085
we'll be on our way.

1428
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:54,921
Not so fast.

1429
01:33:55,004 --> 01:33:58,049
You and me got some unfinished business.

1430
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,343
No, our business is done.

1431
01:34:00,427 --> 01:34:04,181
Pa... you remember how I told you Ma died?

1432
01:34:04,264 --> 01:34:05,265
Yeah.

1433
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:09,101
Well, the son of a bitch who shot her...

1434
01:34:09,186 --> 01:34:11,313
had a tattoo on his hand...

1435
01:34:13,481 --> 01:34:15,525
just like Cicero here.

1436
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:18,695
What, you mean...

1437
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:20,488
my little horseshoe?

1438
01:34:20,572 --> 01:34:22,782
That's always brought me luck.

1439
01:34:23,366 --> 01:34:25,827
Especially when I was shooting somebody.

1440
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:29,121
Well, killer, your luck just ran out.

1441
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:32,834
Your hand touch that knife, boy,

1442
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:35,295
it'll be the last thing you ever touch.

1443
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,714
Oh, I ain't using these knives.

1444
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,467
No.

1445
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,760
Not for my mama.

1446
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:47,014
I saved a special one just for you.

1447
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:03,531
Now you die, Injun-lover.

1448
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:08,620
He dies, you die.

1449
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:15,335
Fourteen of us, six of you.
Doesn't seem quite fair, does it?

1450
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,754
Make that twelve of us.

1451
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:23,426
Twelve of us!

1452
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:30,308
I ain't sign up for this shit.

1453
01:36:02,965 --> 01:36:04,175
You seeing this?

1454
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:05,885
-It's not working.
-What are you doing?

1455
01:36:05,968 --> 01:36:07,845
Don't look like a tumbleweed at all, Herm.

1456
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,263
Herm, come back!
Come back, Herm.

1457
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,518
All right, all right.
Now, everybody just calm down.

1458
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:17,730
A man's entitled...
to kill his mother's killer.

1459
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:23,486
Plus... that's one less guy
you've got to split the money with!

1460
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,323
Good thinking, Frank.
Let's ride!

1461
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:28,658
- Yeah!
- Yeah, get on out of here!

1462
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:35,457
Good job, son.
I'm really proud of you.

1463
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:39,544
And getting your friends to come
all the way out here with you, brilliant.

1464
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:44,591
Well, sir...
they ain't just my friends, they, uh...

1465
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:45,717
They're my brothers.

1466
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,891
Five?

1467
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:56,060
You had fun, didn't you, sir?

1468
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,649
Well, I'm gonna introduce myself.

1469
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:03,901
- I think they'd like that.

1470
01:37:09,031 --> 01:37:12,660
Frank Stockburn, your dad.

1471
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:17,790
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1472
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,667
-Father.
-Son.

1473
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:24,005
This is my burro.

1474
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,090
Proud to know you, Burro.

1475
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:29,301
He's proud.

1476
01:37:29,386 --> 01:37:32,722
You must be, uh,
Saint Louis, right?

1477
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,056
Chico.

1478
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:37,309
Boy, you got your mom's muscles.

1479
01:37:38,561 --> 01:37:39,979
You a prizefighter?

1480
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:44,316
No, actually, I'm a...
piano player.

1481
01:37:44,401 --> 01:37:46,027
Oh, well, I'll be!

1482
01:37:46,110 --> 01:37:49,947
You know, I've been known
to tickle the ivories myself.

1483
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:52,033
Now and then, you know.

1484
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:54,368
We should play together sometime.

1485
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,122
I'd like that, Dad.

1486
01:37:58,205 --> 01:38:00,041
I'd like that a lot.

1487
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:01,709
Yeah, son, we'll do that.

1488
01:38:12,344 --> 01:38:14,764
You must be Delilah's boy.

1489
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:20,394
Boy, she made some fine,
fine whiskey.

1490
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:21,688
Ooh, yeah.

1491
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:27,527
She must've been really hitting it hard
when she was pregnant with you.

1492
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:39,080
Atta boy, atta boy.

1493
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:41,958
Da-da.

1494
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:44,085
And, uh... you are?

1495
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:48,005
I'm Lil Pete. I'm your son!
I love you so much, Dad!

1496
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:49,924
-I have three nipples.
-Yeah, well...

1497
01:38:50,007 --> 01:38:51,926
It's always good to have a spare.

1498
01:38:53,803 --> 01:38:56,222
-Gall dang, you have one, too?
-Yeah.

1499
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:58,057
Do you like to play with the extra one?

1500
01:38:58,140 --> 01:38:59,601
Oh, you betcha.

1501
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:02,269
Oh, Pa, I have a question for you.

1502
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,771
Yeah.

1503
01:39:03,855 --> 01:39:06,774
Where do babies come from?

1504
01:39:06,858 --> 01:39:10,487
Well, son, the mom just poops 'em out.

1505
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:14,031
I knewed it!
I knewed it, Dad!

1506
01:39:15,533 --> 01:39:17,827
Well, look at this handsome devil.

1507
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:20,371
Sir, I'm Danny.

1508
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,499
It's awful nice to finally meet ya.

1509
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:25,126
Could you help me with a problem?

1510
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,169
I did a real stupid thing

1511
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:31,841
that inadvertently led to the death
of a United States President,

1512
01:39:31,924 --> 01:39:35,970
and I'm feeling pretty lousy about it.

1513
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:39,974
Well, son...

1514
01:39:40,057 --> 01:39:41,518
look in my eyes.

1515
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,688
Shit happens.

1516
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:48,733
Yeah.

1517
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:51,068
- Yeah, right.

1518
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:53,445
Thanks. Thank you, sir.

1519
01:39:53,530 --> 01:39:54,906
- You're welcome.

1520
01:39:54,989 --> 01:39:58,117
So, where to now, huh?

1521
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,746
Well, sir, Smoking Fox and me
are getting married in a few days,

1522
01:40:01,829 --> 01:40:05,082
and Screaming Eagle's
walking her down the aisle,

1523
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:08,335
and I was hoping...

1524
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,797
you could be there, next to me.

1525
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,591
Oh, you mean your best man?

1526
01:40:13,675 --> 01:40:15,092
Yes, sir.

1527
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,969
Oh, Tommy...

1528
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:19,681
You know, that's...
that's quite an honor.

1529
01:40:19,764 --> 01:40:22,308
-It would be my honor, sir.
-Yeah. Well, uh...

1530
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:28,480
But unfortunately, I...

1531
01:40:28,565 --> 01:40:31,943
I got some business up north
that I gotta attend to.

1532
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:35,071
I gotta collect some gambling debts and...

1533
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:38,866
You know,
just to pay the doctors and such.

1534
01:40:38,950 --> 01:40:42,411
Say, Dad. You don't ever gotta worry
about money ever again.

1535
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:45,206
We had to conjure up 50 grand twice!

1536
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:47,249
So we ended up with 100!

1537
01:40:48,375 --> 01:40:49,586
- A hundred?
- Yes, sir.

1538
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:51,879
There's another 50 grand?

1539
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:53,715
Yes, sir.

1540
01:40:53,798 --> 01:40:56,634
Right here,
in the burro's saddlebag.

1541
01:40:57,176 --> 01:41:01,848
So that business can wait up north,
can't it... best man?

1542
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:07,729
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I should change my plans.

1543
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,481
- Bueno. Bueno.
- Yeah.

1544
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,155
Hey! What are they doing back?

1545
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,830
What is this?

1546
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:29,500
I guess it's time you kids

1547
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:34,213
learned the truth
about your dear old dad, huh?

1548
01:41:34,296 --> 01:41:37,759
I'm just too famous.

1549
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,970
I can't walk into any town
west of the Rockies

1550
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:43,806
without someone calling the law.

1551
01:41:43,890 --> 01:41:48,269
So, I came up with a way
we could make 50 grand

1552
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:50,437
without lifting a finger.

1553
01:41:50,521 --> 01:41:54,400
And you rascals brought us double!

1554
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,819
Are these my kids or what?

1555
01:41:58,112 --> 01:41:59,363
Son of a bitch!

1556
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:03,325
If our two gangs joined forces,

1557
01:42:03,409 --> 01:42:07,329
there's not a lawman in the West
that would stand up against us.

1558
01:42:07,413 --> 01:42:10,166
What makes you think we'd turn
to a life of crime?

1559
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,168
'Cause it's in your blood.

1560
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,211
Answer me something.

1561
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:19,842
Were you ever great at anything
in your life besides stealing?

1562
01:42:21,678 --> 01:42:23,220
No. No.

1563
01:42:23,304 --> 01:42:27,141
You apples didn't fall far from this tree.

1564
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:29,560
Don't deny who you are.

1565
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:32,313
If you knew who we really were,

1566
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:35,024
you'd be very scared right now.

1567
01:42:37,609 --> 01:42:40,237
Don't overplay your hand, son.

1568
01:42:41,823 --> 01:42:44,075
I'm still holding an ace.

1569
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:55,627
I found her. I--

1570
01:42:55,712 --> 01:42:57,171
I told you I'd find her.

1571
01:43:01,467 --> 01:43:05,972
This little beauty stumbled into our camp
a few days ago.

1572
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,143
She actually tried to rescue me.

1573
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:16,107
I'm guessing this means you don't want
me to be your best man no more, huh?

1574
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:22,071
Well, I'm gonna make this
real simple for you.

1575
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:29,536
Hand over the other 50 grand...
in that stupid ass' saddlebag,

1576
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:34,959
or I put a bullet
in her pretty Apache head.

1577
01:43:37,879 --> 01:43:39,130
That ain't gonna happen.

1578
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:41,173
Oh, it ain't?

1579
01:43:41,257 --> 01:43:42,549
No, sir.

1580
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,761
Why's that?

1581
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,721
Mmm... kind of a secret.

1582
01:43:47,805 --> 01:43:51,893
Well, you can tell your old man,
can't ya?

1583
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:56,814
You know that bag...

1584
01:43:56,898 --> 01:43:59,316
-your boy's holding?
-Uh-huh.

1585
01:43:59,984 --> 01:44:01,778
It was meant for Cicero.

1586
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:04,864
So there's something special in there.

1587
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:07,408
-Plan B.
-Plan B?

1588
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:08,659
Plan B.

1589
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,494
Give me that bag.

1590
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:19,753
Oh, shit!

1591
01:44:34,476 --> 01:44:35,477
Where is she?

1592
01:44:46,405 --> 01:44:48,407
Smoking Fox.

1593
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:01,795
Nighty-night, son.

1594
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,015
- Danny, are you all right?

1595
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:17,728
You done good, Daniel.
You saved me.

1596
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,899
It's my duty, Mr. President.

1597
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:27,029
Mrs. Lincoln.

1598
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:30,657
Come on! Come on!
Come here.

1599
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:36,705
Get in.

1600
01:45:57,851 --> 01:45:58,978
I got one!

1601
01:45:59,061 --> 01:46:00,646
Clem, you almost shot me!

1602
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:02,189
Come on,
get the horses!

1603
01:46:02,273 --> 01:46:05,067
My ass! My ass!

1604
01:46:08,195 --> 01:46:09,696
Hey!

1605
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,242
Is this here still valid,
or is it too burnt up?

1606
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:14,868
Let me take a look here.

1607
01:46:14,952 --> 01:46:17,038
Uh, that looks good to me.
I mean, this looks good.

1608
01:46:17,121 --> 01:46:18,122
What in the hell?

1609
01:46:18,205 --> 01:46:20,666
You didn't scoop yours out,
did you?

1610
01:46:23,877 --> 01:46:25,171
What was the question again?

1611
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:27,256
What?

1612
01:46:27,339 --> 01:46:29,383
Did any of you really do it?

1613
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:36,974
Well, then whose eyes are in that jar?

1614
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:38,267
Uh...

1615
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:41,770
Well, Babyface found some rocks,
and, uh, painted them.

1616
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:43,647
Surprise?

1617
01:46:57,286 --> 01:47:00,581
Hey, Tom,
you wanna play a game

1618
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:05,169
to make up for all the father-son time
we missed?

1619
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:06,837
Peek-a-boo.

1620
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:15,471
Hey, come over here!

1621
01:47:15,554 --> 01:47:17,348
No, come over there!

1622
01:47:23,145 --> 01:47:25,856
You could have had everything, son.

1623
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:28,609
But you had to do the right thing.

1624
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:35,449
Let me leave you
with a bit of fatherly advice.

1625
01:47:36,742 --> 01:47:41,955
- Never bring a knife to a gunfight.

1626
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:45,042
One day,
there will be too many, my love.

1627
01:47:45,126 --> 01:47:46,335
But not today.

1628
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:04,020
That was some mystical shit.

1629
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,901
Tommy.

1630
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:14,363
You knew Cicero killed my mother.

1631
01:48:14,446 --> 01:48:16,282
No!

1632
01:48:16,365 --> 01:48:17,699
No, I didn't know that.

1633
01:48:17,783 --> 01:48:19,410
No more lies!

1634
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:22,621
Yeah, I knew. I knew.

1635
01:48:22,704 --> 01:48:24,623
Your mother insisted on telling.

1636
01:48:24,706 --> 01:48:28,127
She was going to rat the whole gang out,
and I tried to convince her--

1637
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:33,006
Tommy, look, I'm your father,
for God's sake.

1638
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,217
You don't kill your father, Tommy.

1639
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:44,226
His name is White Knife.

1640
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,734
I ain't gonna kill you.

1641
01:48:54,945 --> 01:48:58,699
'Cause my true father taught me otherwise.

1642
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:14,256
You can't leave me like this!

1643
01:49:17,093 --> 01:49:18,219
Tommy!

1644
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,013
You can't leave me here alone!

1645
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:59,426
Dear Mama, so much has changed
since my last letter.

1646
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:01,428
I scarcely know where to begin.

1647
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:06,725
First off, it turns out our daddy
is a bad, bad man,

1648
01:50:06,808 --> 01:50:09,019
and he got thrown in jail.

1649
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:18,445
But it's okay, 'cause Screaming Eagle,
the Indian chief who raised Tommy,

1650
01:50:18,529 --> 01:50:20,864
said he'd be all our dads, too.

1651
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:31,542
I really like it here in this village.

1652
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:35,212
Our new brothers and sisters
love to have fun

1653
01:50:35,296 --> 01:50:38,507
and have been so nice to all of us.

1654
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:41,677
These white guys cannot dance.

1655
01:50:42,844 --> 01:50:44,846
Danny don't drink
whiskey no more.

1656
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,432
- No.
- Yee-haw!

1657
01:50:47,183 --> 01:50:50,811
And Ramon and Herm
are trying to learn Indian ways.

1658
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:07,703
Oh, and big news...

1659
01:51:07,786 --> 01:51:09,955
I finally have a girlfriend,

1660
01:51:10,038 --> 01:51:13,250
and she's much prettier
than a canty-loupe.

1661
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:15,877
Come on, you two!
You're missing all the fun.

1662
01:51:15,961 --> 01:51:20,090
Anyways, Mama, thanks for raising me.

1663
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:23,427
Your loving son, Lil Pete,

1664
01:51:23,510 --> 01:51:27,556
proud member of the Ridiculous 6.

1665
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:53,084
Before you go...

1666
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:56,212
Two, four, six, eight.

1667
01:58:56,296 --> 01:58:58,506
Who do we appreciate?

1668
01:58:58,589 --> 01:59:01,342
The Stockburns! The Stockburns!

1669
01:59:01,426 --> 01:59:04,012
Yeah! The Stockburns!
