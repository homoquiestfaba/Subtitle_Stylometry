early this afternoon,

00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:03,300
we had no idea that the bomb
was, in fact, a skunk.

337
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:06,259
Officers reluctantly placed
the skunk in a squad car...

to await the arrival
of animal control.

Oh. Mick, are you sure
you want to come tonight?

Oh, no worries.
He's, uh, he's just like me, really.

to stop a skunk from spraying him.

around this business.

of the franchise.

Can I take your order?

00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,499
Let me handle this.
Good evening, Wendy.

820
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,779
There will be four of us
dining in the car this evening.

821
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,179
So we're gonna need
four triple burgers with cheese...

822
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:46,739
and four Biggie Fries.

823
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:48,820
So that's four Classic riples...

824
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,820
- Uh, wait a minute.
- and four Biggie Fries?

825
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,539
Uh, here comes Stan and Harry.

826
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,380
Uh, they'll also be
dining with us tonight,

827
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:02,019
so we need...
six triple burgers with cheese...

- You know what I'd really like to do?
- What's that?

831
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,140
Go right up on the roof
on one of those skyscrapers.

832
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:21,739
That's easy.
Just find one that's open.

833
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,660
S'truth. This is
higher than Ayers Rock.

834
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,060
Yeah. Of course, the buildings
in New York are a lot higher.

835

Or as we call it, the "Big Apple. "

Big Apple?
Why do you call it that?

839
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,420
Well, because
it's really big and, uh--

840
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:58,499
Yeah, but none of those buildings
are as dangerous as this.

842
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,179
Well, they don't have
earthquakes in New York.

all the time, right?

Now there's 20 of us, eh?

Yeah, but you can't do that.
It's illegal.

Well, I don't see any cops.

Yeah, but they have cameras
at all these intersections, see?

If you do anything wrong, they take
your picture and send you a fine.

a number plate around my neck,

I wonder
how much they fine you.

870
01:00:01,979 --> 01:00:04,620
It all depends on how many times

- Great. Texas bar. We're in.

Look, I read about this fella,

984
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:07,060
he used to push
a wheelbarrow full of cow dung...

985
01:07:07,179 --> 01:07:09,100
across the border every day.

986
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:11,380
"Manure for the garden, " he'd say.
Went on for months.

987
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,259
And the border guards knew
he was smuggling something,

988
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:16,900
so they'd stop him and rake through
that manure with a fine-tooth comb.

989
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:19,660
Never found a thing.

990
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:23,300

He was smuggling something:

991
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,580
wheelbarrows.

992
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,219
Right under their noses.

993

See, it's there, and I'm just
not seeing it... yet. But I will.

994
01:07:33,979 --> 01:07:38,060
Nah. I reckon he was right
the first time. It's drugs.

995
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:41,140
They wouldn't go to all
that trouble for wheelbarrows.

996
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:54,939
Cut! And print.

997
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:57,739

so that'll work fine.

- Well done, Paul.

[ Man ] And you've actually seen
these paintings quite recently.

1005

Yeah, today.

1006
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:33,779
Well, then that makes it easy.
They're fakes.

1007
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,259
You can tell that
from the photographs?

1008
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,540
Well, normally, no.
But, you see, these Rembrandts...

1009
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:42,179
and this, The Olive Field
by Van Gogh,

1010
01:08:42,259 --> 01:08:44,179
unfortunately no longer exist.

1011
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:47,460
During the bombing
of Belgrade by NATO,

1012
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,300
the National Art Museum of Serbia
took a direct hit,

1013
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:53,579
burned to the ground along with
the originals of these paintings...

1014
01:08:53,659 --> 01:08:58,059
and possibly the finest collection
of old masters in Eastern Europe.

1015
01:08:58,139 --> 01:09:00,619
It was a tragedy
for the art world.

1016
01:09:00,699 --> 01:09:04,659
Ergo, these must be copies, fakes.

1017

That, um, Belgrade,
is that in Yugoslavia?

- Yeah.
- Where these paintings come from.

1019
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:20,659
What if it wasn't
an accidental bombing...

1020
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:23,619
and someone removed
the paintings first?

1021

1022
01:09:27,579 --> 01:09:32,340
Maybe I should take a look at these.
Could you take me to them?

1023
01:09:32,380 --> 01:09:35,460
That's probably impossible.

1024
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:39,900
But if I could get one of them
and bring it to you and it was real,

1025
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:41,940
that means the rest
are probably real, right?

1026

you find one. I have to see them.

- Thank you. Thank you.

1028

- Pablo Picasso.

but I've never been that hammered.

- Uh, Mick?

1032

I was gonna say, "Be careful, "

1033
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:22,619
but I guess that's kind of a dumb thing
to say to someone who hunts crocodiles.

1034

No worries.

1035
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,699
Of course the difference
is obvious here,

1036

but on film,
it's a perfect match.

- All right, we have the paintings.
