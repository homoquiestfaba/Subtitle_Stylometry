1
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,878
So who wants to read?
Come on, it's like the...

2
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:34,078
What is it? The fourth week now?
Let's hear someone else.

3
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:39,288
Do you, um...

4
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,455
Lisa.

5
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:43,171
Lisa, do you mind sharing?

6
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,456
No.

7
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,250
So what did you write this week?

8
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,578
A short one. A haiku.

9
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:12,541
Oh, really?

10
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,326
I didn't see you work on it.

11
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,793
I did it on the ferry.

12
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,038
Read it to me?

13
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,883
A dream garden blooms

14
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,630
Rose, iris, phlox, but here?

15
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:55,326
A white crocus pierces concrete.

16
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:01,668
It's good, Lis.

17
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,173
They didn't like it.

18
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,708
Someone said it was derivative.

19
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,671
But they always say that, right?

20
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,325
They say it if it's good,
they say it if it's bad.

21
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,415
My teacher said I need to put
more of myself in my work.

22
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:39,923
What is it, like,

23
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,710
the flowers out by the pool?

24
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:48,746
Yeah.

25
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,126
More or less.

26
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,328
I'm going to go cut some paper.

27
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,708
Okay, let's move on to "S."

28
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,285
Do you guys see the "S"
at the top of your paper?

29
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,786
And do you see
how there's a piece of an "S"?

30
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,251
Can you see if you can finish that "S"?

31
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,075
That's really good, Derek.

32
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,956
So, when you think of an "S,"
think about...

33
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:05,791
the curve of a slithering
sss...

34
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,131
- What?
- Snake.

35
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,040
Snake. That's right.
Actually, everybody think of a snake.

36
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,785
Think of the way a snake moves

37
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,166
when it sort of slithers on the ground,
right?

38
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,170
Ssss, right?

39
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:20,745
Good job.

40
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,583
Okay. How are you guys doing over here?

41
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,876
- My hand hurts.
- Yeah.

42
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,668
We've been doing this for a long time,
haven't we?

43
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:33,038
Okay. We're going to do song circle
after one more letter.

44
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,745
You guys got one more letter in you?

45
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,290
Yeah. One more letter. Does anybody have
any idea what the next letter is?

46
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,325
"T"!

47
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:43,826
"T" is the letter that comes after "S"
in the alphabet.

48
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:48,666
Very good! "T" is a tall, tough letter,
like a hard tooth!

49
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,043
- Or like a...
- Tusk.

50
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:54,125
Like a tusk. Yes. Very good.

51
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,205
Hey.

52
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,543
Can I see a beautiful "T"?

53
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,830
Thank you.

54
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,580
You know what?

55
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,786
Finish up the letter you're working on
and let's do song circle.

56
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:22,253
Okay, give your papers to Meghan.

57
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,918
- To hell with the core curriculum.
- Thank you.

- I love it!
- A beach on a necklace!

Bye.

00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:58,171
Bye, Caitlin.

73
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,208
You have your collage?

74
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,458
Hey guys, take it easy.

75
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,786
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi, Lauren.

76
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,381
Anna.

77
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,576
Anna.

78
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,786
Anna.

79
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,286
Anna's beautiful.

80
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,960
Beautiful...

81
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,170
enough...

82
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,418
for me.

83
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,326
The sun...

84
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,750
hits...

85
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,750
her...

86
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,540
yellow...

87
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,495
house.

88
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:44,423
It's almost like a sign from God.

89
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,420
What was that?

90
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,210
I don't know.

91
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,166
Was that a poem?

92
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:57,245
That was a poem. It's remarkable.

93
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,173
I think we should write it down. Right?

94
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,875
Okay.

95
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,996
Wow, you remember it.

96
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:26,961
What's your name again?

97
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,291
- I'm Becca.
- Becca. Right. I'm sorry.

98
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,000
I've seen you here before.
So Jackie's gone?

99
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:35,293
- Yeah. She quit.
- That must be why I was confused.

100
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,496
All right. Let's go.

101
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,213
Becca, would you do me a favor?

102
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,833
If he does this again, will you promise
you write it down for me?

103
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,826
Yeah, I can do that for you.

104
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:46,826
Thanks.

105
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,251
Hey, Jimmy...

106
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,670
I really liked your poem.

107
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,128
Okay.

108
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,668
All right. Bye.

109
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:24,923
She uses way to many hashtags.

110
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,666
Oh, my God.

111
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,995
This is clearly edited.

112
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,631
Look at that.

113
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,538
Yep, that's Photoshopped.
That's definitely Photoshopped.

114
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,536
How was your day?

115
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,378
- It was good.
- Dad said you had a test?

116
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,670
Yeah. It was fine.

117
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,328
- So what did he say?
- That he likes me

118
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,580
and he wants to go out, but that
he had to have a talk with Katrina.

119
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,496
But my god, she’s like hanging on
for dear life.

120
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,290
- Who's that?
- You guys going to come eat?

121
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,000
We ordered pizza.

122
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:01,996
Excuse me.

123
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:03,423
- You, too?
- Yeah.

124
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,381
You won't say "hi?"

125
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,671
- Hello.
- Hello.

126
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,286
- Could I have some of those, please?
- Yeah.

127
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,040
- Did you go online and look at the dorms?
- Hey.

128
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,213
- Yes.
- And did you pick your preferences?

129
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,753
Yes, I did.

130
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,998
"Anna is beautiful.

131
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,790
Beautiful enough for me.

132
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:49,126
The sun hits her yellow house.

133
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,790
It's almost like a sign from God."

134
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,081
Wow.

135
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,460
It sounds so advanced.

136
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,328
- How old is he?
- Five and a half.

137
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,750
It's extraordinary.

138
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,455
I think that Lainey and Josh knew
lots of words at that age, but...

139
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,325
...it conjures a feeling.

140
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,168
So specific.

141
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,921
Is he religious?

142
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,921
No, I don't think so.

143
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,293
It's just weird that someone so young
would write about God.

144
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,083
It's... It's disturbing, slightly.

145
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Why do you say that?

146
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,826
Why do you use the word "disturbing?"

147
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,710
I don't know.

148
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,495
It's not disturbing, I suppose.
It's more like...

149
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:02,746
peculiar.

150
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:06,251
The whole God thing. I don't know.

151
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:18,293
"Anna is beautiful.

152
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,538
Beautiful enough for me.

153
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:22,788
The sun...

154
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,165
hits her yellow house.

155
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:30,213
It is almost like a sign from God."

156
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,211
What do you guys think?

157
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,168
I love that line,
"Beautiful enough for me."

158
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,455
It suggests so many things. Like...

159
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,171
you don't deserve much,
or you don't prioritize beauty.

160
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,290
But then the word "beautiful" is repeated,

161
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:56,381
so I feel like you do in fact value it
in some deep way,

162
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,538
and that you really find Anna beautiful.

163
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,750
Yeah! I think it was really good.

164
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,000
Really good, because...

165
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,786
with so few elements
you make something very...

166
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,208
very complex.

167
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,960
It's as if it was said by someone
that has seen a lot of beauty,

168
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,080
but now, you know,
makes do with very little.

169
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:22,246
Okay, so for next week,
I would like you all to focus...

170
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,536
on the boring things.

171
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,713
The banal, the mundane. Just,

172
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,173
you know, try it and see
if the act of writing about something

173
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,080
can transform it into something new.

174
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,080
Let's see.

175
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:46,291
Ho is for whore! Ho is for whore!

176
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,380
No! Jimmy, no!

177
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,380
No. That is an awful word.
All of you guys.

178
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,665
That's a very powerful word
and you guys are just little kids,

179
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,500
and there's no place for that here.

180
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,038
Okay?

181
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,245
I know you guys are better than that.

182
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,883
I'm sorry, Jimmy,
but I have to give you a timeout.

183
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
So, Jimmy,

184
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,083
tell me about your poem.

185
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,376
Who is Anna?

186
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,131
Is she someone you know?

187
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,711
How about your mommy?

188
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,423
Is her name Anna?

189
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,170
My mom is dead.

190
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:59,503
I'm sorry to hear that. I didn't know.

191
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,535
Remember when we planted these?

192
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,751
They were just tiny little seeds.

193
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,916
What does this one smell like?

194
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,213
Smell.

195
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,825
- Tomato.
- Yeah. Tomato.

196
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,330
We have some thyme.

197
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,791
"The rain to the wind said,

198
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:39,998
- you push..."
- "...push,"

199
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,578
- "I'll pelt."
- Remember that one?

200
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,380
"...They so smote the garden bed

201
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,380
That the flowers actually knelt,

202
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,501
And lay lodged,

203
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,165
But not dead.

204
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,081
I know how those flowers felt."

205
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,378
I'm sorry I had to give you a timeout.

206
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,543
I don't like doing that.

207
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,496
I know you can be steady
and use beautiful words.

208
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,165
"Ho" is a boring word.

209
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,035
It's a word boring kids say.

210
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,463
Hey...

211
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:45,995
Let's look at the kindergarten.

212
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,746
These toys, we play with them everyday.

213
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,083
Or the sunflower.

214
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,128
I see the sunflower every single day.

215
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,206
And our butterfly?

216
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,708
Right? They're part of
our everyday routine.

217
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,206
Maybe, if we try...

218
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,745
we can see something new.

219
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,536
Do you feel anything?

220
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:20,673
No.

221
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:39,423
Sorry.

223
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,503
- That's okay.
- Hey.

224
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:46,331
Meghan, can you take Jimmy
to get his clay sculpture?

225
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,536
- I think it's still drying outside.
- Sure, I'll get it.

226
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,285
- Do you mind if we chat for a minute?
- Yeah.

227
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:57,206
Um... I just felt like Jimmy was acting
a little strange today.

228
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,918
He was energetic at recess
and then he was...

229
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,995
very quiet. He hardly said a word
for the rest of the day.

230
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,876
Yeah. He does get quiet like that.

231
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,001
That's true. I mean he's a weirdo.

232
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,581
But how often does he compose poems?

233
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,458
Mmm... I don't know, like once a week.

234
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,581
- Maybe like every few days.
- Really?

235
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,463
Yeah. He'll just, like...

236
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:26,875
pop up. Start walking back and forth
like a zombie, like,

237
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,501
mumbling to himself.

238
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,035
Yeah. I hadn't seen him do it ever
before Monday.

239
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,075
I got to say, they're really cool.

240
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,995
- I like them.
- And what does his family think?

241
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,500
Oh! Nobody knows he does it, but me.

242
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,501
His dad's like a really busy guy.

243
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:45,128
He owns that big night club in Bayonne.
Ultra Lounge?

244
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:49,536
His mom is doing her thing in Miami.
She's not around.

245
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:50,578
Okay.

246
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,166
And Jimmy said she was dead.

247
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,126
- No.
- Yeah.

248
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,628
I didn't think so. Usually,
I'm informed of that kind of thing.

249
00:19:57,958 --> 00:20:00,168
It was a really nasty custody battle.

250
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,830
And are you close with his dad?

251
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,916
Yeah, we work together.

252
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,631
So I know him.

253
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,251
I did coat check at Ultra Lounge
for a year,

254
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,668
and then I quit to pursue acting.

255
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,376
But then he said he needed a nanny.

256
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:19,878
So, I was, like,
this is a perfect part-time.

257
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,536
- Good.
- But you know what?

258
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,038
His uncle, Sanjay, does come by the house,

259
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,040
and Jimmy tells me they read poems,
works on a newspaper.

260
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,626
That's good to know.
I'm glad there's some support...

261
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,670
in the house.

262
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,670
And you like acting?

263
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,538
Yeah.

264
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:39,288
I do.

265
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:43,041
- Well, good luck with that.
- Thank you.

266
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,791
Oh! I almost forgot.

267
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,958
There was one yesterday.

268
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:50,501
You want to see it?
I wrote it down like you said.

269
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,923
Yes, sure. I'd love to take a look at it.

270
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:07,668
"The bull stood alone in the backyard.

271
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,580
So dark.

272
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,625
I opened the door and stepped out.

273
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,423
Wind in the branches.

274
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,421
He watched me,

275
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,291
Blue eyes.

276
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,791
He kept breathing to stay alive.

277
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,205
I didn't want him.

278
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:26,833
I was just a boy.

279
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,173
Say yes,

280
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,076
Say yes, anyway."

281
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:37,923
Wow.

282
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,883
I like the "breathing to stay alive".

283
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,875
What do you guys think?

284
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,001
I was trying to understand the assignment.

285
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,963
I thought everything was supposed
to be observational,

286
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,043
and about things that we see everyday.

287
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:56,208
I mean it is great, but this seems
like an exercise in surrealism.

288
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,921
You don't have to be literal
with my assignments, you know?

289
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,750
These are just exercises
that spark your creativity.

290
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:04,833
You know, it might have been
helpful to know that beforehand.

291
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,380
Okay. Well, I'm sorry. I apologize.

292
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:11,713
But I find it really interesting
that you just went your own way. Really.

293
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,081
You know, sometimes poets, like bulls,
they should be stubborn.

294
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,380
I like the poem a lot.

295
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,880
I'm just wondering why you wrote it
from a boy's point of view.

296
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,205
I don't know.

297
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:30,171
Because she can.
That's what's interesting.

298
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,463
You know, it's interesting to see things
from a new vantage point.

299
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,881
Well, guys, we have to leave, but...

300
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,170
this week,
try using another point of view. Okay?

301
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:45,125
Let's see what happens. All right?
And, please,

302
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:48,378
just really, don't try to please me.
That's not the point.

303
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:52,503
Okay? All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.

304
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,036
Hey. How was class?

305
00:22:57,291 --> 00:22:58,291
It was good.

306
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,125
Yeah, it was better.

307
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:05,705
- Are the kids upstairs?
- I think so.

308
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:08,788
Hey.

309
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,830
Hi.

310
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,666
Did you just get back
from your poetry class?

311
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,580
Yeah.

312
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:18,496
Your hair looks nice like that.

313
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:22,501
Where's Josh?

314
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,173
Tutoring.

315
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,080
Good.

316
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:30,128
Are there any college kids there?

317
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,285
- Where?
- In your class.

318
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:33,631
No.

319
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:36,875
It's all adults.
It's a continuing education class.

320
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,288
Oh.

321
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,381
Hey, don't you have work to do?

322
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,791
Yeah. I finished it in study hall.

323
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,376
I was thinking about...

324
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,288
how great you were
at photography last year.

325
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,876
Why don't you take Dad's old camera,

326
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:58,538
and lenses, and take a walk
around the neighborhood?

327
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,128
I post cool stuff on Instagram
all the time.

328
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah. But developing in a dark room
is totally different

329
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:07,378
It just stinks in there,
with all the chemicals and stuff.

330
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:09,881
Okay.

331
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,918
Just something I noticed
you were good at.

332
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,500
Hi, Mr. Roy.
This is Lisa Spinelli calling.

333
00:24:20,583 --> 00:24:22,383
I'm Jimmy's kindergarten teacher.

334
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,416
And I was just calling

335
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,170
because I would like to talk to you
about your son when you have a moment.

336
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:32,331
I left a message on Tuesday
with all my information,

337
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:35,246
so, please, give me a call
when you get a chance.

338
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:36,535
Thanks a lot. Bye.

339
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,251
I'm really curious
what's gonna happen

340
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:49,883
when you have no white on the paper.

341
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,208
- I don't have any white on my paper.
- Yeah. Let's see, here it is.

342
00:24:53,833 --> 00:24:56,083
Oh, you need a little more room
on the paper.

343
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,536
Here you go.

344
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,921
Do you need something, Abby?

345
00:25:03,416 --> 00:25:04,286
What do you need?

346
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:07,921
Now, do you think you guys can make
a chrome yellow?

347
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,793
Like in Van Gough's "Wheat Fields"?

348
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:13,535
Remember how beautiful that color was?

349
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,080
Is this the volcano here,
and the lava coming out?

350
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:13,535
Hey, Jimmy.

351
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:18,876
Jimmy.

352
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:23,288
Hey, Jimmy.

353
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,246
Will you come with me?

354
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,576
Where are we going?

355
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,043
Come here.

356
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:54,076
Why are we in the bathroom?

357
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,625
Because I want to talk to you
about something. Hey.

358
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:05,418
I want to talk to you about something
that I think is very important for a poet.

359
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,130
It's called your point of view.

360
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,285
So, here we are. We're in a bathroom.

361
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,423
But there's not just one bathroom.

362
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,825
- There's many bathrooms?
- Yes.

363
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,535
There's many bathrooms, because, look,

364
00:27:23,166 --> 00:27:24,246
If you're a grown-up,

365
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,376
the bathroom looks like this.

366
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,075
Yeah, you're a big grown-up Jimmy.

367
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,130
What do you think? Look around.

368
00:27:35,416 --> 00:27:38,456
I bet there's all sorts of things
you didn't notice before.

369
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,170
What else do you want to be?

370
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,253
You want to be a giant?

371
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,211
Okay. Turn around.

372
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,708
What do you see from up there?

373
00:27:53,666 --> 00:27:54,876
What's it like up there?

374
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:59,036
- The bathroom is so tiny.
- Do you like it?

375
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
- Yes.
- What else? A cat!

376
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,791
Let's be a cat down here. Look, down here.

377
00:28:04,875 --> 00:28:05,825
I'm a cat.

378
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,790
So if you stay open,

379
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,541
and if you stay curious,

380
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:19,285
then you can see the world
however you want.

381
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,793
You can see the world
like a little tiny bug.

382
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,460
Or like a bad guy.

383
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:26,958
You know what I mean?

384
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,710
Can I go back to nap time now?

385
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,961
Will you think about what I said?

386
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,460
Will you think about it?

387
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,173
All right.

388
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:53,996
Jimmy.

389
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,125
Jimmy, one more thing.

390
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,286
It gets so dark

391
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,666
It stays dark,

392
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,383
Even when I turn on the light.

393
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,625
It gets so bright,

394
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,575
The flowers bow to the sun.

395
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,541
Do you remember the lion?

396
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,286
So quick and so strong.

397
00:29:56,916 --> 00:29:59,456
He has no master
when his master is sleeping.

398
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,126
And all his master does is sleep.

399
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,420
That was a poem.

400
00:30:17,291 --> 00:30:19,881
Can you say it for me again,
so I can write it down?

401
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,790
Meghan, did you catch what he was saying?
Did you get the beginning?

402
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,165
Sorry. I had the water running.

403
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,630
I think he was singing a song.
He seems to be doing that a lot.

404
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,793
They aren't songs. They're poems.

405
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,753
It was about a dead lion.

406
00:30:42,583 --> 00:30:43,583
You see?

407
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,460
What am I going to do with you?

408
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,080
Hey.

409
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,288
- Becca, we have a little bit of a problem.
- What's wrong?

410
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:05,001
Poems are disappearing.
It happened just now. He was...

411
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:07,958
pacing back and forth.
I rushed to get to him

412
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:11,131
and by the time I got there
he was almost finished. All I got was...

413
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:14,955
"He has no master
When his master is sleeping.

414
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,916
And all his master does is sleep."

415
00:31:23,166 --> 00:31:25,706
It's from the point of view
of a hunted lion.

416
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:29,455
I see.

417
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:32,961
I mean, how often
are we missing these moments?

418
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,245
It's hard to say really, I mean,

419
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,576
I try my best, but...

420
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:41,376
Out of curiosity, who tucks him
into bed at night? Is it you or...

421
00:31:41,458 --> 00:31:42,328
is it somebody else?

422
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:43,666
It's mostly me.

423
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:47,793
I think that's a time to pay attention to.
I mean, imagine how much...

424
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,791
incredible poetry is written in that...

425
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,040
not quite conscious moment
just before the lights go out.

426
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:56,996
Hey.

427
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,080
You're such a good teacher. You know that?
You have a big heart.

428
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,541
Listen, baby doll.

429
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,075
When you come up with your poems, just
let us know, okay? So we can help you.

430
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,626
Yeah, because we don't want
to miss anything, okay?

431
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,830
Do you have kids?

432
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:11,923
I do.

433
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,583
- Big? Small?
- They're big. They're in high school.

434
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,496
Oh, wow.

435
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:18,793
Well, they're really lucky to have you.
You're... very attentive.

436
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,170
Alright, let's go baby.

437
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:26,038
Okay, so let's just work together to make
sure that all of his work gets heard.

438
00:32:26,125 --> 00:32:27,285
I'll do what I can do.

439
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:28,713
Bye.

440
00:32:56,458 --> 00:32:57,288
Hi.

441
00:32:57,416 --> 00:32:58,416
Hi, I am Lisa.

442
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,630
We spoke on the phone.

443
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:00,538
- Yes.
- Hi.

444
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,625
- Hi, Lisa.
- Is now still an okay time?

445
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,788
Yes, of course.

446
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,705
We memorize a few poems, just for fun.

447
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:09,248
Well, he composes, too.

448
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,081
- Really? I didn't realize.
- Yes, and I...

449
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,291
I wanted to speak to you because...

450
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,633
I imagine, maybe,
you can appreciate how rare

451
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,245
that gift is.

452
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:21,998
I mean, I've been...

453
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,671
a kindergarten teacher for almost 20 years
and I've never seen anything like it.

454
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,580
And I just want to support it, and I want
to protect it as much as I possibly can.

455
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:30,496
Absolutely.

456
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,503
Talent is so...

457
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,960
fragile and so rare.

458
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:37,375
And our culture does everything
to crush it.

459
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,748
I mean even at four or five,
they're coming into school

460
00:33:39,833 --> 00:33:43,173
attached to their phones, talking only
about TV shows and video games.

461
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,960
It's a materialistic culture,

462
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:47,501
and it doesn't support art, or language,

463
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,250
or observation.

464
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:54,665
Even my own children, who are great,
they don't read.

465
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,293
You know, you think...

466
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,378
maybe it's just a phase.

467
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,500
But I worry that it's something larger.

468
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:08,826
A lack of curiosity.

469
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,536
A lack of reflection.

470
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,958
No one has space for poetry.

471
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:15,711
Maybe that's true.

472
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,750
Really, what I want is to speak
with his father.

473
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,038
His father?

474
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:25,665
I wonder if he would allow me
to oversee his progress.

475
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,333
Well, he is a busy man and frankly

476
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,576
I don't know
how much you'll get out of him.

477
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:35,785
Have you met him?

478
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:36,705
No.

479
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:39,293
He doesn't actually
even return my phone calls.

480
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,920
Maybe the babysitter can help?

481
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,580
- Becca?
- Yes, Becca.

482
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,166
Well, between you and me,

483
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,830
I think Becca is a problematic element
in this too.

484
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,580
I mean she doesn't understand
the depth of his talent.

485
00:34:56,166 --> 00:35:00,286
Listen, I apologize,
but I should get back to work soon.

486
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,205
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,330
Okay.

488
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:05,036
I'll... speak to my brother soon.

489
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,960
- I'll see if I can catch him this week.
- That would be wonderful.

490
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,878
I should...
I really have a deadline, so...

491
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:18,788
Okay.

492
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,825
- You know your way out.
- I do.

493
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,920
Hey Jimmy. Will you come
with me to the playground?

494
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,211
I want to talk to you about something.

495
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:49,291
Come on. Let's play.

496
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:01,503
They have five more minutes.

497
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,423
- Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,043
Jimmy, I want to talk to you
about something very important.

499
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,000
When you have a poem in your head,

500
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:20,461
and when your poem is ready,

501
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:22,668
...will you come to me?

502
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,496
Even if you see I'm busy
or I'm talking to somebody else,

503
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,170
or if you're mad at me that day,
or if you think I'm mad at you,

504
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,880
will you please come to me?

505
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,883
If it happens when you're not at school,
it's okay.

506
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:42,251
You can call me on the phone.

507
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,503
You don't have to recite your poem
to Becca.

508
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:47,705
It's better if you call me,
you understand?

509
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,171
I'll write it down for you.

510
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,540
And don't let her call you silly names
like puppy dog and...

511
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:57,036
bunny rabbit. It's belittling.
It means she's treating you like a baby.

512
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,460
So, look. I took your cell phone
from your backpack.

513
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:02,381
Hope that's okay.

514
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,963
And I'd like to put my number in it,
so you have it if you need it.

515
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,963
I'm not going to put it in
under Mrs. Spinelli

516
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,001
because that is too long.

517
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,285
I'm going to type in the letter L.

518
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,423
See?

519
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,330
"L..."

520
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:19,496
is...

521
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,205
for Lisa.

522
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:23,673
That's my name.

523
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:29,211
So just find "L" when you want to call me.
Okay?

524
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:30,996
Okay.

525
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,080
Hello?

526
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:38,455
Hi.

527
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:39,881
Hi.

528
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,576
Where are you headed?

529
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,285
I have practice.

530
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:51,131
- No you don't. You had it yesterday.
- We have an extra one this week.

531
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,788
Josh, where are you going?

532
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:55,785
I have a meeting.

533
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,501
Is this Marine stuff?

534
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,878
Josh, come in here.

535
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:10,418
We just don't get it.
You worked so hard to get into that school

536
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,753
and you busted your butt,
and you pulled up your grades,

537
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,793
and we're proud of you.
That's all we're saying.

538
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,285
It's not even a good school.

539
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,830
Josh, it's stupid to put yourself
in harm's way.

540
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,500
People get their fucking limbs blown off.

541
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,133
I'm just sick of school, okay?

542
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,131
Plus, I think service is more important

543
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,538
than whatever notion of achievement
you have in your head.

544
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:34,205
No, if you want to go fight for oil
in the desert, that's fine,

545
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,711
but don't kid yourself.

546
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:01,043
Don't worry. He always lands on his feet.

547
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:01,996
Does he?

548
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:12,003
I don't know.

549
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,633
Are we finally alone?

550
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,040
Can I lock the fucking front door?

551
00:39:24,125 --> 00:39:25,495
- No!
- And make sure...

552
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:26,745
that no one...

553
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:29,171
comes back in this house...

554
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,330
ever again?

555
00:39:47,541 --> 00:39:48,831
Really?

556
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:55,996
Hello?

557
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,375
Mrs. Spinelli?

558
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,498
Hi, Jimmy.

559
00:39:58,791 --> 00:39:59,921
I have a poem.

560
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:10,626
Wait! Okay. I'm ready to write it down.

561
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:12,631
Go ahead.

562
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,668
The gold rusts,

563
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,500
The warmth breaks

564
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:18,575
And the light comes at morning,

565
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,206
The police start their way
to the dining hall,

566
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,171
And the sound of World War Three
is out there.

567
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,501
Dust is out.

568
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,378
And pray God,
The wedding is coming.

569
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:40,376
And the reciting poem is here.

570
00:40:53,208 --> 00:40:54,458
Shh!

571
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,583
I loved your poem last night.

572
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,535
Do you want to hear a poem from me?

573
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,671
Okay.

574
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,708
Mesmerize Me, Butterfly.

575
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,210
Forcing wings open-shut

576
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,171
Thrust with purpose not known to me

577
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,205
Not expert, in your grasses.

578
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:48,751
In poison

579
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:52,883
Mushrooms camouflage deliverance

580
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:58,381
Today the garden teems with wood sprites

581
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,578
Flashing blue

582
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:01,705
Now white

583
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,001
At the edge of seeing.

584
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,710
Is that a poem you wrote?

585
00:42:16,916 --> 00:42:17,746
Yeah.

586
00:42:30,375 --> 00:42:32,165
You can just forget you heard it.

587
00:42:32,833 --> 00:42:34,793
I don't want to spoil your talent.

588
00:43:16,416 --> 00:43:17,956
Amy, what are you doing?

589
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:20,538
What's the big deal?
It's been decriminalized.

590
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,173
Can I have it?

591
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:26,325
You and dad always act like artsy,
progressive hippies!

592
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:27,416
Okay, you know what?

593
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:31,576
Smoke it, if you want to.
Maybe it'll open you up.

594
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,745
- You...
- What's going on?

595
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Could have such an incredible mind.

596
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:38,538
Incredible mind?

597
00:43:38,791 --> 00:43:41,381
What's up with you?
You're acting so weird!

598
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,290
We got all our work done.

599
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:46,285
I wish there was
a little bit more curiosity,

600
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:49,075
vibrancy, intellectualism in this house.

601
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:51,916
Ever since you started taking
those dumb-ass poetry classes

602
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,330
you've been acting like you're...

603
00:43:53,416 --> 00:43:55,956
the cultural ambassador
to the UN or something.

604
00:43:56,041 --> 00:43:59,211
Okay, if you want to go back to college
and get your stupid degree,

605
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,421
then you can go ahead.

606
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:04,210
Okay, I actually get straight A's
without having to work very hard

607
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,173
and you never acknowledge that.

608
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,246
You worked your ass off
and look where you are.

609
00:44:23,666 --> 00:44:24,496
Hey.

610
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,038
What the hell is going on?

611
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,035
It's nothing.

612
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:30,125
She's just being provocative. I'm fine.
I'm going to get some air.

613
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,080
"Cultural ambassador to the UN."

614
00:45:37,416 --> 00:45:38,286
Hello?

615
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,501
Jimmy, hi.

616
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:41,710
It's Mrs. Spinelli.

617
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:43,381
It's Lisa.

618
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:45,166
Why are you calling me?

619
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:49,633
It's okay. Kindergarten teachers
are allowed to call their students.

620
00:45:50,458 --> 00:45:52,458
Becca's going to read me a book.

621
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,791
Okay. I know, it must be getting
close to bedtime.

622
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,245
I just wanted to say hi.

623
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,626
Okay.

624
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,173
A home transformed by the lightning,

625
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:15,878
The balanced alcoves smother
This insatiable earth of a planet,

626
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,168
Earth.

627
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:22,878
They attacked it with their mechanical
horns because they love you.

628
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:24,131
Hello?

629
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,250
Hey Lisa, how's it going?
Come, sit down.

630
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,826
I was reading this poem that...

631
00:46:29,416 --> 00:46:30,666
that a computer wrote.

632
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:32,833
You know, with some algorithm.

633
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,171
It even passed the Turing Test.

634
00:46:35,833 --> 00:46:37,423
In the end, we're all machines.

635
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:40,958
Well, Justin, thank you,
and good luck with the sonnet.

636
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:41,921
Yeah, I'll crack it.

637
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,165
Don't make Watson do it.

638
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:46,875
Cool, man. I'll see you at the reading
on Thursday, then.

639
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:48,328
- Great. Bye.
- Bye.

640
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,711
You know,
it is very funny when you have, like,

641
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:58,043
this amount of books,
and I've only read one-tenth of them.

642
00:46:59,916 --> 00:47:02,826
So, Justin was telling me
that half of the class is going to stay

643
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,916
for the next semester.
Would you like to stay?

644
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:08,171
- Yes, I would.
- That would be great, right?

645
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:09,376
- Yeah.
- Good.

646
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:13,325
So tell me about you. I don't know
anything about you. What do you do?

647
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:14,463
I teach.

648
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:15,788
You teach?

649
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,790
I want to thank you for inviting me.

650
00:47:18,875 --> 00:47:21,625
I can't tell you how flattered I was
when I received your email.

651
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,578
Oh, please. No. I mean...

652
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:25,921
You know your work has been...

653
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,331
progressing a lot,
and it was a no-brainer.

654
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,876
I mean you have to come.

655
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,580
So what do you teach?

656
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,286
I teach kindergarten.

657
00:47:35,416 --> 00:47:37,286
That's such a delicate thing, right?

658
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,830
I mean, you give the kids something
and then they...

659
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,245
they have it forever.

660
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,578
- Yeah.
- It's incredible.

661
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,496
That's true.

662
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,825
So... Um...

663
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,540
on Thursday night...

664
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:54,495
at the Bowery...

665
00:47:55,625 --> 00:47:57,575
we're doing this reading where...

666
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,206
you know, a bunch of poets come in.

667
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:02,788
It's very eclectic. Young and old.

668
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:06,876
And there's reviewers, publishers as well,
there might be.

669
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,581
And everyone that goes on stage
reads two poems.

670
00:48:10,708 --> 00:48:12,918
So you have to prepare two poems
that you like.

671
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,960
- Okay.
- Alright?

672
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,170
I really want to thank you
for this opportunity.

673
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:19,671
Of course.

674
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:22,381
There's dancing afterwards...

675
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,330
with poets.

676
00:48:23,541 --> 00:48:26,671
You know, there's going to be a party
with drinks and stuff, but...

677
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,130
I don't know, maybe you...

678
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:31,376
you will be like a center of attention.

679
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:49,125
I am sorry. I'm sorry.
My God, I'm sorry.

680
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,915
I'm very sorry.

681
00:48:51,708 --> 00:48:52,708
I'm sorry. I just...

682
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:55,081
It's presumptuous of me...

683
00:48:56,541 --> 00:48:57,421
I'm sorry.

684
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:01,578
Forget about it.

685
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,326
Can I read you a poem?

686
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:08,923
Yeah.

687
00:49:12,541 --> 00:49:14,331
I wrote it sort of quickly.

688
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,630
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

689
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:20,673
Okay.

690
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,080
Mesmerize Me, Butterfly.

691
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,080
Forcing wings open-shut

692
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:39,375
Thrust with purpose not known to me

693
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:42,251
Not expert in your grasses

694
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,290
In poison

695
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,080
Mushrooms camouflage deliverance

696
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:52,375
Today the garden teems with wood sprites

697
00:49:52,458 --> 00:49:53,498
Flashing blue

698
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:54,750
Now white

699
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:56,790
At the edge of seeing.

700
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,288
It's good.

701
00:50:03,958 --> 00:50:04,788
Yeah?

702
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:06,166
Yeah, that was very cool.

703
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,580
It's not my favorite, that you've written,
but it's nice.

704
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,673
You know, at the beginning,

705
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:19,628
when you came into the class,
I didn't notice you at first.

706
00:50:20,166 --> 00:50:22,166
There's so many people, you know, and...

707
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,286
Also, you were very quiet for a while.

708
00:50:24,625 --> 00:50:26,625
Then you started to present your work.

709
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,330
But, I mean, I must say,
don't take this wrong,

710
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:32,326
but at the beginning,
your work was very typical, you know?

711
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:33,246
Like, all the...

712
00:50:34,083 --> 00:50:35,633
all the metaphors were very...

713
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,290
kind of commonplace,
which is normal because you're...

714
00:50:38,375 --> 00:50:41,285
just experimenting with the nature
of all of this.

715
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,958
But when you read your poem about Anna.

716
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,633
Then, I thought,
okay, there is a poet here.

717
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,705
And from then on, I was just...

718
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,080
I don't know.

719
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:57,673
I wonder what...

720
00:50:58,333 --> 00:50:59,583
what's going on with you.

721
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:10,081
Are you going out with Anna?

722
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:15,246
No.

723
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:20,293
Do you like women?

724
00:51:22,875 --> 00:51:23,745
Occasionally.

725
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:40,495
Hey.

726
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:41,923
Come with me.

727
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,710
Is he okay?

728
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,165
Yeah. Of course.

729
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:57,128
Yeah, let's go in here.

730
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:11,791
So, on Thursday,

731
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,666
we've been invited to a place

732
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,670
where poets read their poems
on stage, like this,

733
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,293
in front of an audience.

734
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,003
Some of them will probably be
pretty mediocre, but...

735
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,080
I was wondering if you might want to read
a few of yours.

736
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,128
What do you think?

737
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:37,793
Yeah, I'd like to.

738
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:43,125
I think it would be a great opportunity.

739
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:51,170
Actually, why don't you stand up here.

740
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:56,673
Yeah.

741
00:53:57,291 --> 00:53:58,251
Like a stage.

742
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,075
Can you show me how you say
one of your poems?

743
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,325
Maybe "Anna"?

744
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:11,916
Anna's beautiful

745
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:13,881
Beautiful enough for me

746
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,791
You know what's in there?

747
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:24,705
What?

748
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:25,713
Your heart.

749
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:29,035
Can you try saying it more from there?

750
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:30,828
From your heart?

751
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,536
Anna's

752
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:35,746
beautiful

753
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,575
Beautiful enough for me.

754
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:41,293
The sun hits her yellow house.

755
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,955
It's almost like a sign from God.

756
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,455
Okay, good.

757
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,878
So, on Thursday we'll do "Anna" and...

758
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,173
how about "The Bull"?

759
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,173
Yeah.

760
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:00,830
And we'll practice
both of them a little bit every day.

761
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,080
Okay.

762
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,710
Mr. Roy.

763
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,830
Yes.

764
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:43,496
So...

765
00:55:44,958 --> 00:55:46,578
I've got a kid with a good head.

766
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,830
I'm happy.

767
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,291
Well it's more than that.

768
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,290
I think we have a young Mozart.

769
00:55:53,125 --> 00:55:53,995
He's gifted,

770
00:55:54,666 --> 00:55:55,496
Mr. Roy.

771
00:55:56,791 --> 00:55:59,291
He writes poetry on a level that is far...

772
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:01,576
beyond his age.

773
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,213
Have you talked to Sanjay?

774
00:56:06,916 --> 00:56:07,916
Sanjay who?

775
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,670
Your brother, the writer.

776
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:14,325
The writer?
Haven't talked to him in a month.

777
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,878
I see. He was supposed to call you.

778
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,961
What can I do for you, Lisa?

779
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,581
Mozart...

780
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:23,788
was nurtured by Kings and Queens.

781
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:28,576
They massaged his tired hands.
They fed him candy...

782
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:30,630
while he played the piano.

783
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,173
And Jimmy doesn't have that.

784
00:56:33,416 --> 00:56:36,496
I'm not saying he should be spoiled,
but he does need support.

785
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,583
And Becca,

786
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:40,995
she's nice.

787
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:44,541
But she's not a good influence on him.

788
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:46,748
Why?

789
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,460
Well, I think she treats him
like any stupid child.

790
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,833
She talks to him like a puppy dog.

791
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:57,415
And I should tell you she's often late
picking him up and dropping him off.

792
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,631
Is that true?

793
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,035
Yes.

794
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:04,536
Last week, she was an hour late
because she was at an audition.

795
00:57:06,041 --> 00:57:08,501
I know. I see you're very busy and...

796
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,038
that you're a very successful man,
and that you don't have a lot of time.

797
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:14,125
And I know
that Jimmy's mother isn't around.

798
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:17,578
I want to help my son.
Especially if he enjoys doing this.

799
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:19,875
But, I don't want him
to be like my brother.

800
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,383
You met him, right?

801
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:25,625
Forty two years old. Makes 50 grand a year
because he wanted to be an intellectual.

802
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:27,496
Now?

803
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,960
Corrects spelling mistakes
for the newspaper.

804
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:33,583
I want my son to do good in school.
I want him to be smart, but...

805
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:36,035
it's also good to have a normal life.

806
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,250
Make money, be practical.

807
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:42,923
But you know I don't like this Becca
forgetting to pick him up.

808
00:57:43,916 --> 00:57:45,536
I'm going to ask her to leave.

809
00:57:45,916 --> 00:57:47,746
I knew it wasn't going to work,
but, you know,

810
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,383
whenever this happens,
it's a real problem for me because...

811
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:51,288
who watches him?

812
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:52,583
I'm happy to.

813
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,463
It's not hard for me.

814
00:57:54,541 --> 00:57:56,711
Especially if it's a few hours
after school.

815
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,246
Yeah.

816
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,791
- That would help me very much.
- Okay.

817
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:03,535
At least until 5 or 6. Then I could get
a girl to come to the house.

818
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:04,495
Yes, I can do that.

819
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:06,288
And...

820
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:09,463
I don't know if Jimmy mentioned it
to you, but I've asked him to recite

821
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:14,171
a few of his poems in Manhattan
on Thursday night at a poetry reading.

822
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:15,705
See now,

823
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:18,791
on Thursday he has baseball practice
with his friend. They go together.

824
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,628
So, forget it. It's too complicated.

825
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:23,963
I see.

826
00:58:25,916 --> 00:58:27,916
Do you need me to bring him to baseball?

827
00:58:28,708 --> 00:58:32,128
Oh, no. They've got it arranged.
The father of the kid takes him.

828
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,253
It's a shame...

829
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:39,286
that he won't be able to go
to the reading.

830
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,665
Don't overthink it.

831
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,630
They need things simple at this age.

832
00:59:06,875 --> 00:59:08,035
You know what?

833
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:09,535
Let's turn our phones off.

834
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:11,378
And then we can just...

835
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:13,036
look at the art,

836
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,333
not worry about anything else.

837
00:59:48,833 --> 00:59:49,673
Hi.

838
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,171
I tried to call three times.

839
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,080
Come on, honey. Let's go.

840
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,918
Anna is beautiful

841
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,575
Beautiful enough for me.

842
01:00:17,583 --> 01:00:20,043
The sun hits her yellow house

843
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:23,581
It's almost like a sign from God.

844
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,830
That was great, Jimmy.

845
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,745
Do it just like that tonight, okay?

846
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:31,995
Okay. Now...

847
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:34,958
I'm going to be somebody in the audience,

848
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:37,041
and I'm going to pretend
to ask you a question, okay?

849
01:00:37,125 --> 01:00:38,165
I'm going to raise my hand.

850
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:40,831
Mr. Jimmy Roy.

851
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:43,673
Who is Anna?

852
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,751
And then you have to answer.

853
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,035
So, you can say...

854
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:55,918
You can say
Anna is a little tweeting bird.

855
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:58,125
Or you can say

856
01:00:58,208 --> 01:01:00,288
she's one of the little girls
in our kindergarten.

857
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:01,915
Or you can say she's the moon,

858
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,665
or a star or...

859
01:01:05,083 --> 01:01:06,793
you can say whatever you want.

860
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:15,706
Hi, Richard.

861
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:16,631
Hey.

862
01:01:17,041 --> 01:01:18,831
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

863
01:01:18,916 --> 01:01:19,826
Okay, great.

864
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:22,038
So...

865
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,250
Jimmy was really not feeling well today.

866
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:26,833
I think maybe it's best
if he skips baseball.

867
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:28,791
That's fine with me.

868
01:01:28,875 --> 01:01:30,535
Better he's not running around
in the heat.

869
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:33,166
Does Nikhil need me to take him
to the doctor?

870
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:35,633
You know, I just spoke to him.

871
01:01:35,958 --> 01:01:37,708
I'm happy to keep Jimmy tonight.

872
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:41,171
I was just concerned because I know
you've got two other babes in the house.

873
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:43,750
And I wouldn't want him
to get everyone else sick.

874
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,883
Alright. As long as Nikhil's fine with it.

875
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,880
He agreed it would probably be better.

876
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:50,458
- Thanks, Lisa.
- Okay. Alright, see you tomorrow.

877
01:02:13,166 --> 01:02:15,206
Who you think you're talking to?

878
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:18,916
Don't you know I'm the reason why you
can't shut any wet part of your face?

879
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,501
While all the badass hurricanes struck
a woman's fame,

880
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:23,463
I put God in my hands, snapped.

881
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:24,881
Watched it rain.

882
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,380
Skid my teeth across the thin skin
of my full lip

883
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:29,378
Just to usher the sun in, so yeah.

884
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:30,918
I make you dog pant.

885
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:33,921
Make you beg big. But I'm also
the reason you hallelujah.

886
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,165
Just as much life I've given you,
I can take it away.

887
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,250
Calling me bitch?

888
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:42,173
Only sharpens my blade, only makes me want
to watch you gargle your own tongue.

889
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:43,080
I've been a killer.

890
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,286
Baby, I keep caskets warm,

891
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,665
God in business.
I parade into rooms

892
01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,291
And the wallpaper don't even
stand up no more.

893
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:52,625
My pussy be hurricane season
so the next time

894
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,380
You see me walk in a room,

895
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:58,081
Out a room, up the block.
Shit, down the block, just say Amen.

896
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,251
Like I'm the answer to the sky.

897
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,131
Hi, this is Jimmy Roy

898
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:26,668
and he'll be reciting two poems
for you tonight.

899
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,670
Anna is beautiful.

900
01:03:40,791 --> 01:03:42,381
Beautiful enough for me.

901
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,880
The sun hits her yellow house

902
01:03:46,583 --> 01:03:49,793
It's almost like a sign from God.

903
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,251
The Bull.

904
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,331
The bull stood alone in the backyard.

905
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:05,253
So dark.
I opened the door and stepped out.

906
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,713
Wind in the branches.

907
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,043
He watch me.

908
01:04:09,416 --> 01:04:10,576
Blue eyes.

909
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,541
He kept breathing to stay alive.

910
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,580
I didn't want him.
I was just a boy.

911
01:04:17,458 --> 01:04:18,668
Say yes.

912
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:22,036
Say yes, anyway.

913
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:33,753
I'm sorry to ask
such a basic question, but...

914
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:36,381
are these your poems, and if so,

915
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:40,128
are you using him
as a sort of poetic medium?

916
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,923
No, these are his poems.

917
01:04:46,625 --> 01:04:47,455
He wrote them.

918
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:51,538
Bravo!

919
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:57,503
For the... young man.

920
01:04:57,916 --> 01:04:59,876
How long have you been writing poetry?

921
01:05:01,041 --> 01:05:03,291
I started when I was five.

922
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:06,921
Jimmy?

923
01:05:07,208 --> 01:05:10,328
I was wondering who is this Anna
that you write about.

924
01:05:12,166 --> 01:05:14,166
Anna could be...

925
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:15,630
anyone you love.

926
01:05:17,250 --> 01:05:20,710
For me, she's my kindergarten teacher's
helper, Meghan.

927
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,833
Jacket's tight on my arms.

928
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:43,710
I want to take it off.

929
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,205
Why are you upset?

930
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,330
I'm not.

931
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,826
Just emotional because...

932
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,876
I'm so proud of you.
You did such a beautiful job.

933
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:08,038
They clapped for me.

934
01:06:17,708 --> 01:06:20,248
They loved it.

935
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:27,583
Jimmy can you wait outside
for me for a minute?

936
01:06:30,125 --> 01:06:32,625
Just wait right there,
right outside the door.

937
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,130
Jimmy?

938
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:14,536
Hi, Jimmy.

939
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,000
He's incredible, isn't he?

940
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,580
I think you should leave the class, Lisa.

941
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,500
I'm uncomfortable with the fact

942
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:33,673
that you're presenting work
that is not your own.

943
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:36,246
Okay.

944
01:07:38,291 --> 01:07:40,921
All artists take from each other.
But what you're doing,

945
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:42,963
I don't know.

946
01:07:43,208 --> 01:07:44,458
It's something different.

947
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:47,001
You're leeching off a child.

948
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:51,083
I'm so sorry that you see it that way.

949
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:54,538
You break the whole trust
that goes into a classroom.

950
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:55,575
The whole ethic.

951
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:59,793
I don't see what's the point?
I was excited about you, Lisa.

952
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:02,626
Well, this is about him.

953
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:05,125
No, it is very unclear what you're doing.

954
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:09,788
What's clear is that you're not an artist.

955
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:13,786
You're just an art appreciator.

956
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:15,003
A dilettante.

957
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,828
It's very different. Don't you think?

958
01:09:37,583 --> 01:09:39,713
Where have you been?

959
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,790
The reading went late.

960
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:57,541
It went okay?

961
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:58,711
Yeah.

962
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,043
Are you proud of the kids, Lis?

963
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,080
What do you mean? Our kids?

964
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:24,251
Josh said the other day that...

965
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:30,125
he thought
you seemed disappointed in them.

966
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:42,463
No.

967
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:44,631
Of course not.

968
01:10:51,416 --> 01:10:53,416
Okay.

969
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:07,416
X-ing X's.

970
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:10,958
X-ing X.

971
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:15,923
Jimmy,

972
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:17,833
it's Lisa, where are you?

973
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:19,711
Are you sick?

974
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:20,705
I hope not.

975
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:24,705
I don't even know if I need to
take care of you this afternoon.

976
01:11:26,375 --> 01:11:27,745
So can you please call me?

977
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,878
Let me know what's going on?

978
01:11:32,208 --> 01:11:33,038
Okay, bye.

979
01:11:50,916 --> 01:11:51,746
Hi, Jimmy.

980
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:58,253
Mr. Roy. Let me just...

981
01:11:58,375 --> 01:12:00,495
Let me just find a place
where we can talk.

982
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:04,751
Nikhil.

983
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,535
Nikhil, listen to me.

984
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:09,246
Listen for a second.
Nobody's fighting with you.

985
01:12:09,833 --> 01:12:13,043
I did it in the name of his talent.

986
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:18,503
No. It wasn't a bar. It was a poetry club.

987
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:22,955
Okay.

988
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:24,416
Okay. Yes.

989
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:27,375
I do under...

990
01:12:27,458 --> 01:12:30,418
I do. I thought it was very late,

991
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:33,915
and that it made much more sense
for him to spend the night.

992
01:12:37,166 --> 01:12:37,996
Well, I...

993
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:42,458
I think you're reacting very strongly,

994
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,208
but of course you're entitled
to your opinion.

995
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:54,708
Yes, I should have asked
for your permission and I'm sorry.

996
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:04,705
Meghan.

997
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:06,833
Is everything okay?

998
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,290
Yeah, that was Jimmy's dad.

999
01:13:10,916 --> 01:13:13,786
He's leaving us. He's going to go
to another kindergarten.

1000
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,290
That's too bad.

1001
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:20,165
Sorry to hear that.

1002
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:21,995
Okay, everybody,

1003
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,630
let's have some snacks.

1004
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:31,173
Me too.

1005
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,786
Gluten-free.

1006
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,543
I need a big one.

1007
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,330
Hi.

1008
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,330
Hey.

1009
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:52,330
Who's here?

1010
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,418
- We're all here.
- Good.

1011
01:13:56,291 --> 01:13:57,331
I was thinking...

1012
01:13:57,791 --> 01:13:59,881
I would cook a big dinner tonight
for everyone.

1013
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:02,168
I went to the market.
I got some great stuff.

1014
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:04,333
Mwah!

1015
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:05,916
Honey, you're sweaty.

1016
01:14:07,541 --> 01:14:08,711
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1017
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:15,996
Josh?

1018
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:18,213
Okay.

1019
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,038
Lainey?

1020
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:25,538
Hey.

1021
01:14:25,958 --> 01:14:27,248
I got some great food.

1022
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:29,543
I was hoping we could have dinner
together tonight.

1023
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:32,876
I sort of can't. I'm supposed to go
to Kelly's to study for Bio.

1024
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,460
Well, can you go after?

1025
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:41,003
Hey, I would really appreciate it if we
could sit down and have a meal together,

1026
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,753
just once like a normal family.

1027
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:44,955
It's been a long time.

1028
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:47,381
Okay.

1029
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:48,288
I'll tell Josh.

1030
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,830
But can I leave at 7:30?

1031
01:14:52,166 --> 01:14:52,996
Yeah.

1032
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:56,955
Mom?

1033
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:00,918
Sorry I got so upset with you
the other night.

1034
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:04,165
Probably could have worded that
a little bit better.

1035
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:05,668
Came off kind of bitchy.

1036
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,830
It's okay.

1037
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:18,293
How was your meeting?

1038
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:19,916
It was fine.

1039
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:23,293
There are actually
so many benefits to joining up.

1040
01:15:23,375 --> 01:15:25,625
They'll even pay for a year of my college.

1041
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,830
Okay.

1042
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:33,001
You don't mind?

1043
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:41,418
Have a good day.

1044
01:18:27,916 --> 01:18:28,786
Hey, Jimmy.

1045
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:43,038
Hi.

1046
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,330
Hi.

1047
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:48,211
It's so hot today.
I thought maybe we could go swimming.

1048
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,211
You know how to swim?

1049
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:50,455
Yes.

1050
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,880
Turn that.

1051
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,500
Push it to the left.

1052
01:19:05,458 --> 01:19:06,708
I missed you.

1053
01:19:45,416 --> 01:19:48,786
Where we're driving, up North,
is so beautiful.

1054
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,828
Big mountains.

1055
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,580
A lake you can swim in.
Have you ever done that before?

1056
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:58,128
No. I've only been in a pool.

1057
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:02,626
But I like to swim.

1058
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:10,166
How long are we going swimming for?

1059
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:14,173
As long as we want.

1060
01:20:59,708 --> 01:21:01,828
You want to swim like the other kids?

1061
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:04,080
Come on. I'll go with you.

1062
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,003
Alright.

1063
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:01,083
You want to make a wish?

1064
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:11,876
I have a poem.

1065
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:16,460
Okay.

1066
01:22:17,041 --> 01:22:18,751
Come. Let's move in a little.

1067
01:22:24,833 --> 01:22:26,543
Anna, get up.

1068
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:28,328
Remember

1069
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,880
Loneliness is still time spent

1070
01:22:32,041 --> 01:22:33,171
With the world.

1071
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:39,166
Here's the room with everyone in it.

1072
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:42,876
Your dead friends passing through you

1073
01:22:43,666 --> 01:22:45,996
Like wind
Through a wind chime.

1074
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:49,173
Don't be afraid, Anna.

1075
01:22:50,208 --> 01:22:52,628
The end of the road is so far ahead

1076
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:55,000
It is already

1077
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:57,461
Behind us.

1078
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:05,831
Oh, Jimmy.

1079
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:42,461
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1080
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:45,923
So different from home.

1081
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:48,206
It's beautiful...

1082
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,496
and sad-looking too.

1083
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:52,881
Yeah.

1084
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,333
Sadness never ends.

1085
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:59,463
Van Gough said that before he died.

1086
01:24:08,125 --> 01:24:08,955
Okay.

1087
01:24:09,541 --> 01:24:10,921
Go get cleaned up, alright?

1088
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:13,206
You're covered in sand and dirt.

1089
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:20,830
Go ahead.

1090
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:39,463
Hey, Jimmy.

1091
01:24:40,625 --> 01:24:42,245
Are you okay with the hot water?

1092
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:19,876
I'm going to go get washed up too.

1093
01:25:57,708 --> 01:25:58,538
Jimmy?

1094
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:05,288
Jimmy?

1095
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:14,583
Hey, Jimmy, did you lock the door?

1096
01:26:15,166 --> 01:26:15,996
Yes.

1097
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:18,745
On purpose?

1098
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:20,746
Yes.

1099
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:25,785
Hey, Jimmy, sweetie. Open the door.

1100
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:29,753
You know how much I care about you.
I love you so much.

1101
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:31,753
This whole trip was planned for you.

1102
01:26:34,333 --> 01:26:35,423
Open the door, baby.

1103
01:26:39,583 --> 01:26:40,423
Jimmy.

1104
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,960
Listen, tomorrow...

1105
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:47,421
we're going to go back to the lake
and we're going to get ice cream.

1106
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,540
And then,

1107
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:53,496
we're going to drive across the border...

1108
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,455
and you're going to recite your poems...

1109
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,541
and I'm going to write them down.

1110
01:26:58,625 --> 01:27:01,575
And we're going to publish a book
that has your name on it.

1111
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:03,923
Just think about that.

1112
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:12,080
Hello, I've been kidnapped.
Can you help me?

1113
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:21,245
Hey, Jimmy,
if you want to call the police,

1114
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:24,706
you have to dial 9-1-1.

1115
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:33,041
- 9-1-1. What's your emergency?
- You know, Jimmy,

1116
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,500
this world is going to erase you.

1117
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:41,501
There's not a place in this world for you.

1118
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:44,998
For people like you,

1119
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:47,631
...couple of years, you were gonna be...

1120
01:27:48,083 --> 01:27:50,503
just a shadow, just like me.

1121
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,791
Shit.

1122
01:27:59,916 --> 01:28:01,746
No, she's in the shower.

1123
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:04,790
Okay. Where are you?
Have you come here before?

1124
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:07,915
Jimmy?

1125
01:28:08,666 --> 01:28:11,326
I'm in a place with lots of beach trees.

1126
01:28:11,583 --> 01:28:13,383
Okay. Can you...

1127
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yes, I'm near Canada.

1128
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,790
Jimmy, tell them you're
at Placid Oaks Motel, Room 114.

1129
01:28:27,416 --> 01:28:29,626
And tell them I don't have a weapon.

1130
01:28:30,583 --> 01:28:34,963
I'm in Placid Oaks Motel, Room 114...

1131
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:38,131
and she doesn't have a weapon.

1132
01:28:42,416 --> 01:28:43,826
What did they say?

1133
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:48,961
They said to hang tight
and they'll be here soon.

1134
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:00,331
Hey, Jimmy.

1135
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,633
Can you open the door, please?

1136
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:06,331
I'd like to get my clothes on...

1137
01:29:07,083 --> 01:29:09,293
before the policemen come.

1138
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:21,381
We'll get you an ice cream
in just one second.

1139
01:31:35,875 --> 01:31:37,165
I have a poem.

1140
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:44,828
I have a poem.
