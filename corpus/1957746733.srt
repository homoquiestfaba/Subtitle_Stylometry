1
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,055
No...

2
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,282
No. No. Please.

3
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,959
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

4
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,577
Hey, your friend Celine
is the one

5
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,970
that recommended the restaurant.

6
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,406
Yeah, she...

7
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,644
I don't know
what she was thinking about.

8
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,148
I don't know
what she liked about it.

9
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,802
I honestly don't know
what she ordered

10
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,301
that could've been good.
There's nothing...

11
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,197
There's nothing good
on the menu.

12
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,851
You can't hate every restaurant
that doesn't have fries.

13
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,463
It wasn't just the fries.
They didn't even give us bread.

14
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,943
You know how important
bread is to me.

15
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,336
Do you like bread?

16
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,990
I wasn't sure whether
you liked bread

17
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,906
after you talked about bread
the whole way home.

18
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,908
What's with all the rave
about small plates?

19
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:08,476
Why can't I have
just one really big plate?

20
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,870
Well, we tried.
Turning 30's a big deal.

21
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:14,090
I can't just take you
to a buffet.

22
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,048
Unlimited food and no waiting.

23
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:17,920
What a drag.

24
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,271
Next year, I promise.

25
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,210
I've told you how much
I love you, right?

26
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,801
Mm. You might have
mentioned it.

27
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:31,760
But I still like hearing it.

28
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:39,594
I'm still hungry, by the way.

29
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,073
They do not give you
enough food.

30
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,858
One star, and that's generous.

31
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:48,298
I just wanna change into PJs
and make some nachos

32
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,995
and marathon
a bunch of trashy TV

33
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,359
until we fall asleep
on the couch.

34
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,001
Surprise!

35
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,414
Now, what if we did
the exact opposite

36
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,048
of everything you just said?

37
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:01,181
This is so much better!

38
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,053
- How're ya?
- Happy birthday!

39
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,750
I can't believe
you didn't tell me!

40
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:07,099
- Thanks for...
- Oh...

41
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,624
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.
- Hi.

42
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,930
So, 30. You think
Catherine's gonna spring

43
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,584
the baby question
on you tonight?

44
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:16,892
No babies until marriage,
darling, thankfully.

45
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:19,590
I don't know. She might
be getting desperate.

46
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:22,332
You're pretty much dried up now.

47
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:25,379
I can't believe
Mark's dad married her.

48
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:28,033
She really does put
the smother in stepmother.

49
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:29,383
Okay, she's coming.

50
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:32,342
- Hello, darling. Happy birthday.
- Hi.

51
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,952
- Thank you.
- Oh. Oh...

52
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,956
You remember my friend Celine.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,394
How can I forget?

54
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:44,224
So, 30. Quite the milestone.

55
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,229
You know, when I was your age,
I was married with a baby.

56
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:51,622
The '50s were a different time.

57
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,145
It was so nice
of you and Don to come

58
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,017
all this way for my birthday.

59
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:01,110
Well, we actually brought you
a little surprise.

60
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:02,696
Oh, you guys didn't have
to get me anything.

61
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,461
Well, it's actually
for you andMark.

62
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:09,553
Mark? Uh, I'm not sure
where he's gotten to.

63
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:12,991
- Ahh!
- You're here. Oh, my gosh!

64
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,385
Of course.
I would absolutely not miss it.

65
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:19,476
You look amazing.
Nicole! Look who it is.

66
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:25,830
Forgive my idiot brother.
I'm... I'm Audrey.

67
00:04:25,874 --> 00:04:28,050
Audrey! It's so good
to finally meet you.

68
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,660
No, no. No, handshakes.

69
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,638
You're the closest thing
I've ever had to a sister.

70
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,142
Oh, good to meet you.

71
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,796
Okay, still lost over here.

72
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,015
This is Mark's
stepsister, Audrey.

73
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,714
Oh, Catherine's daughter!
Should've guessed.

74
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,413
What's that supposed to mean?

75
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,460
Um...

76
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,505
It doesn't mean anything.

77
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,247
I'm totally kidding.

78
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,686
Oh!

79
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,403
Why are we standing here?
Let's go meet your friends.

80
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,299
- Come.
- After you.

81
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,391
She is adorable.

82
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:13,138
I cannot believe you.
You are still using that line.

83
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,662
It worked, didn't it?

84
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,664
Wait, you use that line
on other girls?

85
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:19,580
Yeah, but you were the only one
who ever fell for it.

86
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:21,277
Oh!

87
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,409
You guys are sweet, I'm...

88
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:23,845
I'm glad you're a normal one

89
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:26,369
because he's burnt
through a lot of, uh

90
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,153
questionable girlfriends.

91
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:29,198
A lot?

92
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,417
There weren't that many.

93
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,117
Well, there was Maggie,
Jamie, Nancy...

94
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,554
- Lisa, Molly...
- Yes. Yeah.

95
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,556
- The girl with the piercings.
- Ah, Kristen.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,210
Piercing? Where?

97
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,344
Okay, let's try not to chase off
the normal one, alright?

98
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:47,172
I don't care who came before

99
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,131
as long as no one comes after.

100
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,133
- No one will.
- Aww.

101
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:53,657
And speaking of which...

102
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,356
Let's see it?

103
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,140
See it?

104
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,185
Uh, the ring?

105
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:05,582
Are you kidding? I...

106
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,497
I'm sorry! I thought
that mom said...

107
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,586
- What are you talking about?
- I'm...

108
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,372
Mark?

109
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,287
I had kind of a surprise

110
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:18,247
that involved Nicole's cake,
but...

111
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:29,476
Nicole...

112
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,261
I love you more than anything
in the world.

113
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,829
And even though we've only
known each other a few years

114
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,093
I feel like I've
known you my whole life

115
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,139
and I want nothing more
than to spend

116
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,185
the rest of my life with you.

117
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,626
Will you marry me?

118
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,500
- Mark...
- Is that a yes?

119
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:55,545
Yes!

120
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,242
Yeah!

121
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,163
Oh, I'm shaking.

122
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,295
Yeah!

123
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,652
Okay, so,
what was meant to happen?

124
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,437
I was gonna light the candles,

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,153
then she would close her eyes
and make a wish,

126
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:21,223
and when she opened them,
the ring would be there.

127
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,635
It's kinda presumptuous
that her, uh,

128
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:24,444
wish was to marry you,
right, just, like,

129
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,142
a little presumptuous? 'Cause,
like, if I was doing that...

130
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,013
- What's all this?
- Oh, hi!

131
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:30,275
Morning, lovely.

132
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,557
I thought I would make breakfast

133
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:34,279
to thank you
for letting me crash.

134
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,281
Wow, I could get used to this.

135
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,955
Do you come as part
of the marriage package?

136
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,763
I don't think Mark would

137
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:41,809
want me as a third wheel.

138
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,725
Thanks.

139
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,727
How'd you get Mark up so early,

140
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,771
and to do the dishes?

141
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:50,252
I have my ways.

142
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:51,732
She's making the Mark special.

143
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,211
"The Mark special."

144
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,692
Ooh, it's bliss in a burrito

145
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:56,998
and a pan of cheese and bacon.

146
00:07:57,041 --> 00:07:58,042
Yeah, it's his favorite.

147
00:07:58,086 --> 00:07:59,217
Um, I used to make it

148
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,392
every Sunday morning

149
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:02,351
while our parents slept in.

150
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,745
Wow. Talk about spoiled.

151
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,704
You know, if you want to take up
that torch once we're married...

152
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,358
I won't object.

153
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:11,142
Maybe you're better off
marrying Audrey.

154
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:19,150
So, I was thinking
we should start planning.

155
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,717
We've been engaged for 12 hours.

156
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,893
I know, and I kind of already
picked the venue.

157
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:24,242
We make a great team.

158
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:26,723
I'm sorry! I promise
you'll like it, though.

159
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,725
Timberwood?

160
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,510
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

161
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:31,554
Let's go check it out.

162
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,992
Audrey, you should come with us.

163
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:37,386
It's beautiful.

164
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,953
I wouldn't want to crash.

165
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,824
No. I would love
a second opinion.

166
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:43,697
- Mark is pretty much a yes man.
- Hey!

167
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,263
Not all the time.

168
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,744
Well, in that case...

169
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,398
I would love to.

170
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,008
Ahh.

171
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,532
There you go.

172
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,664
Thank you.

173
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,670
Mm.

174
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,498
I love you so much.

175
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,545
- I do what I can.
- I wasn't talking to you.

176
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,131
- Okay, then I'm gonna eat it.
- Why? Okay! Okay. Easy.

177
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,611
Why, if you don't care about me,
I'm...

178
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:09,960
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- I'm so close.

179
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,638
You made this for me!

180
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,683
You can make yourself one.
I'm sorry!

181
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:36,053
This place is... Wow.

182
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,667
I know. Perfect.

183
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,148
I can see why you love it
so much here.

184
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,586
It's not just the view.

185
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,284
My dad took me up here
a lot when I was little.

186
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,635
Your mom not into nature?

187
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,856
She... wasn't into being a mom.

188
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,902
She left soon after I was born.

189
00:09:58,946 --> 00:10:00,948
Dad died when I was
still in high school.

190
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,866
So, I don't really
have any family.

191
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,128
Except Mark.

192
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,610
And now you.

193
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,574
So, when are we getting married?

194
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,721
I can't believe they're
closing this place down.

195
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,630
I've dreamed of getting
married here since I was 12.

196
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,851
Isn't there anything we can do?

197
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:36,695
Unless you want to get
married in three weeks.

198
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,267
I knew dad wasn't going to be
able to walk me down the aisle

199
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,686
but... at least here
it's like...

200
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,602
he's still with me.

201
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,691
Like he wouldn't
miss my wedding.

202
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,127
Then do it!

203
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,347
Get married in three weeks.

204
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,828
You're crazy.

205
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,918
Nicole's a teacher. She can
take the summer off, right?

206
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,069
I don't think
you understand everything

207
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,157
that goes
into planning a wedding.

208
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,835
No, Mark.

209
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:03,532
What if we tried?

210
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:06,448
Kept it small,
called in a lot of favors.

211
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,319
But in three weeks?

212
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:09,799
Yeah.

213
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:10,863
What about all the little things

214
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:11,995
we want to kind of plan for?

215
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,586
What about them?
It will be here,

216
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,545
and it will be with you.

217
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,722
- That's all I care about.
- Nicole, I...

218
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:22,029
You know how much
this place means to her?

219
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:26,163
I mean, unless
you're having doubts?

220
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:27,948
No! No.

221
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,866
Then what's the problem?

222
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,567
I guess...

223
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,569
There isn't one.

224
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:43,703
- Really?
- Let's do it.

225
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:56,909
Okay, if we're going to do this

226
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,501
we have to make
some serious cuts.

227
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:01,808
Cap it at 50?

228
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,635
Sounds good.

229
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,917
Audrey, you don't
have to do that.

230
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,814
Oh, nonsense.
I can earn my keep.

231
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,991
I only need
to invite four people.

232
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,689
Mm, that's sweet... and sad.

233
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,431
Okay. Uncle Oliver and his wife.

234
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:20,217
Would you say that you're
wedding invite-close?

235
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,219
I guess.

236
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,699
You guess?

237
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,242
What makes someone
wedding invite-close?

238
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,094
- Babe...
- I don't know.

239
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,791
Whatever you think.

240
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,837
Come on. This is your family.

241
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,535
I need some real feedback here.

242
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,277
Definitely invite them.

243
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,887
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, invite them.

244
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,909
But don't work too hard in
trying to find a seat for them.

245
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,891
They haven't gone
to a wedding in ten years,

246
00:12:41,935 --> 00:12:44,589
but they always send a check.

247
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,243
Done.

248
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:49,203
Thank you. I appreciate that.

249
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,900
May I?

250
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,033
Be my guest.

251
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,648
Um, just had a baby.

252
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,215
Not worth the drama.

253
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,173
Hasn't spoken to Mark
since high school.

254
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:06,046
- Cousin Steve?
- Cousin Steve.

255
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,831
How do you feel
about dogs at your wedding?

256
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,702
I'd say I'm against it.

257
00:13:10,746 --> 00:13:12,748
So, bye-bye, Margaret.

258
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:19,146
Audrey, what are you doing
for the summer?

259
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,930
Ugh, I'm staying
at mom and Don's,

260
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,106
but only until I die of boredom.

261
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:28,720
Uh, how'd you feel
about... staying with us?

262
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,508
- You want me to stay?
- Only if you want to.

263
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,249
It's just I've got
three weeks to plan

264
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:38,034
this whole wedding, and I
could really use your help.

265
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,690
I don't... I don't know.

266
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,649
- Mark?
- Sure.

267
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:46,347
It'll be just like back home,

268
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,044
but this time with satellite TV.

269
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,717
And we could get to know
each other better

270
00:13:49,741 --> 00:13:51,961
before we officially
become sisters.

271
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,618
Okay. I would love to.

272
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,620
Great! You can stay
in the guest bedroom,

273
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,622
and we'll feed you.

274
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,406
Hm!

275
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:04,974
Look at us. Not even married,

276
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:07,498
and we already have
a freeloading daughter.

277
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:10,240
Ignore him. Back to this.

278
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,286
I like how ruthless you are.

279
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,205
I can't believe you kept this
hidden from me this whole time.

280
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:20,598
I wasn't hiding it.
How did you find it anyway?

281
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,967
Oh, please,
you've been hiding things

282
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,167
in your sock drawer
since ninth grade.

283
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:27,214
I found some very interesting
things over the years.

284
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,563
Hmm. Do tell.

285
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,478
Do not!

286
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:34,003
Ah, jackpot.

287
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,179
Okay, this is my favorite thing.

288
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,529
Look at those chubby
chipmunk cheeks.

289
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,923
This is nice. We should
make fun of me more often.

290
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,969
And who is the trollop
that drew the heart?

291
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,319
As your fiancee, I am now
privileged this information.

292
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:48,191
Uh, let's see.
Senior year, that would be...

293
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:52,935
Becca Gould. She was one
of the... questionable ones.

294
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,981
I'm guessing
there was a falling out?

295
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,983
Yeah, things didn't end well.

296
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,636
This was very mature,
by the way.

297
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,508
That was actually my handiwork.

298
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,466
She went to second base
with this guy,

299
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,120
and I confronted her on it,

300
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:07,471
and, uh,
she punched me in the face.

301
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,300
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

302
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:11,364
Audrey came home
with a black eye

303
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,824
and wouldn't tell us why.

304
00:15:12,868 --> 00:15:14,324
I had to wait till our parents
went to bed,

305
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,089
and then I made her tell me.

306
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,656
- Next day...
- Bye-bye, Becca.

307
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,920
Guess I'll be on my best
behavior while you're in town.

308
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,270
You should be.

309
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,228
I'll be watching.

310
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,540
Um, okay, I know we've
been going at it all day,

311
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:36,022
but we should probably
talk some more wedding.

312
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,390
That sounds like a job
for you two.

313
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:38,739
Oh, please,
you have more experience

314
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,244
planning weddings than we do.

315
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:43,159
What?

316
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:45,379
- Audrey...
- Well, Rachel!

317
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:48,469
Uh, Mark's last fiancee.

318
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:52,081
Last fiancee?

319
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,694
I, I thought you would've...

320
00:15:57,913 --> 00:15:59,567
Nicole, I...

321
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,005
I'm so sorry.
I thought you told her.

322
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,274
Oops.

323
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,243
- Baby...
- Rachel?

324
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:26,463
- Your last fiancee?
- I'm sorry.

325
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:28,050
When were you going
to tell me about this?

326
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:30,139
Were you just going to casually
mention it at the altar?

327
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,991
I know I shouldn't have
kept this from you.

328
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,185
I've just been waiting
for the right time

329
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,471
to talk about it.

330
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,038
I feel like such an idiot.

331
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,605
I'm planning our wedding, and I

332
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,448
didn't even know
that you were engaged before?

333
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,831
Okay.

334
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,574
Okay.

335
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,013
Before I met you,

336
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,972
Rachel was the first real
relationship I had.

337
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:00,454
We were happy.

338
00:17:02,934 --> 00:17:04,936
At least, I thought we were.

339
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,551
The day of our wedding...

340
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:16,426
They found her
at the bottom of a bridge.

341
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,125
She jumped.

342
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:20,996
In her dress.

343
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,782
All she left was a note
that said, "I'm sorry."

344
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:29,222
No warning...

345
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,180
no explanation.

346
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,098
And until I met you...

347
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,773
I never thought I'd be able
to care for somebody

348
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:40,842
like that again.

349
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:45,542
It was just...

350
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,893
too painful.

351
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,462
- Mark...
- I know...

352
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,422
I should've told you sooner,
and I promise I was going to.

353
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,468
But part of me just...

354
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:04,039
closed off.

355
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,958
Baby, I'm sorry, I should've...

356
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,917
But...

357
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:15,094
I want you to know
that you can talk to me

358
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:17,835
about anything.

359
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,359
If we're going to do this,

360
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,056
we can't have any secrets.

361
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,755
Is there anything else
that you need to tell me?

362
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:32,850
No.

363
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,809
Are you sure?

364
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,769
Yeah. I'm sure.

365
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,270
Hey.

366
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:03,142
Hey!

367
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:08,190
I am sorry about before.

368
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,584
Wine tends to open me up.

369
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:13,848
No. Actually, I'm glad
I found out about it now.

370
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:18,200
It's just... so sad.

371
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:22,030
It was really hard for us,
but I think it really,

372
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,771
really devastated Mark.

373
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:26,556
I mean, I would practically

374
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,733
have to drag him
out of bed every morning.

375
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,480
I was... the only person
he would talk to.

376
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:40,875
He told me that he wouldn't have
gotten through it without you.

377
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:43,007
That you were there
for the whole thing.

378
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:47,055
We had a long talk.
Actually, it's funny,

379
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,100
I think it brought us
closer together.

380
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,800
Great.

381
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,063
I'd hate to think
that I got in between you two.

382
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,979
No! No, of course not.

383
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,763
So, what's on the agenda?

384
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:01,654
I actually have to get going.
I'm meeting Celine for some

385
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,114
retail therapy, dress shopping.

386
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,725
Great. I will get my purse.

387
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:08,946
Oh, okay.

388
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,607
Hi!

389
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:20,088
Oh!

390
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,785
I can't believe
this is happening!

391
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:23,613
Three weeks?
You're a crazy person.

392
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,919
I know.

393
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,619
I, um, see you brought
another crazy person.

394
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,578
I didn't really have a choice.

395
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,188
She kind of just
invited herself.

396
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,842
Well, sure.
She ruined your engagement.

397
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:36,017
Why not ruin this, too?

398
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,714
Celine.

399
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,257
Future mother-in-law.
I'd better take that.

400
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,737
You didn't tell her
about today, did you?

401
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:43,590
Of course not.
Try to play nice, okay?

402
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,854
Catherine? Hi!

403
00:20:46,897 --> 00:20:48,551
Good to see you!

404
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:51,032
I kinda thought it was going
to be me and Nicole today.

405
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,034
Yeah, I hope you don't
mind me tagging along.

406
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:55,645
I wanted to make sure she chose
something tasteful.

407
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,734
Excuse me?

408
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,103
Look who I found
in the parking lot.

409
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:00,389
Surprise!

410
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:02,696
I didn't want you
to choose a dress

411
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:04,306
without the mother of the bride.

412
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,047
I'm so sorry I'm late.

413
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,050
It would've been great to have
had some advance notice, but...

414
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,487
No, you're, uh,
you're right on time.

415
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,707
Alright.

416
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,448
Shall we?

417
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,805
Now the first few you tried on
were a little more extravagant,

418
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:28,287
but I think you'll find this one
elegant in its simplicity.

419
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:33,901
So? What do you think?

420
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,469
- It's perfect.
- It really is.

421
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,949
It's definitely unique.

422
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,649
You don't usually see
a wedding dress that basic.

423
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:46,870
Personally,
I like the first one.

424
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,916
She looked like a tent
covered in glitter.

425
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,005
Well, I think Mark
would really like it.

426
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:53,312
Mark does love camping.

427
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,968
So?

428
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,144
I think this is it.

429
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:02,233
- I think this is the one.
- Wonderful.

430
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:03,907
Now, we are not
blessed with a lot of time,

431
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:06,237
so I have to get
to the alterations right away.

432
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,553
I am so happy for you two.

433
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:19,773
Now, I just know Mark is going
to fall in love with you

434
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:23,037
all over again when he
sees you in that dress.

435
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,865
Thanks, Catherine.

436
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,434
I'm so glad that you could come.

437
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,697
I left my phone
in the dressing room.

438
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,396
I will... be right back.

439
00:22:58,725 --> 00:23:01,423
- Find what you were looking for?
- Yes, I found my phone.

440
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,382
Great.

441
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:06,036
Okay.

442
00:23:17,744 --> 00:23:20,660
Okay, we'll put
a priority on this,

443
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:23,271
so expect a call in about
a week for the fitting.

444
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:25,926
Thank you so much. You have no
idea how much this means to me.

445
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,450
- Oh, it's our pleasure.
- Ready?

446
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,712
Yeah.

447
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,154
Wait a moment.

448
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:40,244
Your purse.

449
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,508
Oh! Yes. Thank you so much.

450
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,074
- You're welcome.
- Have a good day.

451
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:47,469
You, too.

452
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:54,084
I'm so glad that you came here.

453
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:56,347
Okay, but Don is expecting us.

454
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,740
Would you mind terribly
if I stole

455
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,481
Audrey away for a family lunch?

456
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,701
- No, of course not.
- Yeah, family comes first.

457
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,138
Can we do the lunch some other
time? We have a photo-shoot.

458
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:05,879
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow.

459
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,683
You're not gonna come with us,
we need to figure something out.

460
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:10,100
- Fine.
- I'll save you some cake.

461
00:24:10,144 --> 00:24:12,625
Yeah, I'll see you another time.

462
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:18,631
So, I think I saw
a flower shop over on 2nd.

463
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:19,806
It should be on the way.

464
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:22,852
Are you sure you want flowers?

465
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:25,986
I know how you like
to keep things basic.

466
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,075
Okay, let's retract the claws.

467
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,382
I'm just saying Audrey's
kind of a giant bitch.

468
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,688
What are you talking about?

469
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,057
She's like the nicest
person I know.

470
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,865
I'm not saying
she's the Antichrist,

471
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:38,041
but she's creepy.

472
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,565
No, she's not.

473
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,915
You were fine with her
just inviting Catherine

474
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,091
without asking?

475
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,962
She likes the element
of surprise.

476
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:49,879
Most predators do.

477
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,533

Found a winner for the cake,
we saved you a piece.

512
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,706
Hmm, guess she's not home.

513
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,013
Shame. Well, extra cake for us.

514
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,754
You're cut off.

515
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,886
Pictures. I'm going
to get the laptop.

516
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,848
Audrey's cake
better be untouched!

517
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:58,285
Oh, no! Looks like
the box is empty.

518
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,330
Celine, I'm serious!

519
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:14,910
Oh, hey! You came just
in time to see pictures.

520
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:17,391
Hey, thank you for saving me
a piece. It's so good.

521
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,698
Of course. Nice dress.

522
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,612
Oh, it's yours.
Um, I hope you don't mind.

523
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:23,092
I didn't do the laundry.

524
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,660
No. Um, you're family.

525
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,401
My closet's your closet.

526
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:29,055
Come help me pick
a photo for the invite.

527
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,665
Of course!

528
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:36,410
Celine?

529
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,459
That is so beautiful.

530
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,854
That's it.

531
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:48,030
It's the one.

532
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,728
Oh, I don't know.

533
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,731
Wouldn't you rather...

534
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:54,820
show everybody this?

535
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,169
Celine!

536
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:57,953
Don't even joke!

537
00:28:57,997 --> 00:28:59,912
Oh, come on.
We didn't see anything.

538
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:02,566
Thirty more seconds, and you
would've seen everything.

539
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,264
You made a sex tape?

540
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:06,919
Celine's brilliant idea.

541
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:09,399
Oh, come on. Tell me
that Mark didn't love it.

542
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:10,879
And you will, too,
when you're 80

543
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:12,794
and gross and wrinkled.

544
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:16,189
Anyway, back to this.

545
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,365
What do you think, Audrey?

546
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:24,110
- Exactly what I would want.
- Decision made!

547
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:26,503
This calls for a celebration
drink. Shall we?

548
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:28,679
Not yet. We still have
to address all those envelopes.

549
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,595
Well, actually I did them
when you were

550
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:33,946
at the photo shoot
this afternoon.

551
00:29:37,993 --> 00:29:40,387
Here you go.

552
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,520
Wow, Audrey!

553
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,871
Look. You can't even tell
that I didn't even write these.

554
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:48,221
So I copied your handwriting,
so it looks more authentic.

555
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,354
By the 20th, I couldn't
even tell the difference.

556
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:52,921
Where did you get
her handwriting?

557
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,010
From the invitation list.

558
00:29:55,054 --> 00:29:56,751
Uh, I hope you don't mind.

559
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,057
No!

560
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,015
Nicole and I were
going to do these.

561
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,495
Now you don't have to.

562
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,281
Audrey, I don't know
what to say. Thank you!

563
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,761
Of course!

564
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,678
Now I'm definitely
ready for that drink.

565
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:34,310
So, I know things have
moved kind of quickly

566
00:30:34,354 --> 00:30:36,922
since you got here,
but I just wanted to say

567
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,837
that we're so happy to have you.

568
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,057
I'm happy, too.
I love it here.

569
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:45,365
We wouldn't have been able
to pull this off without you,

570
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:49,630
and Mark and I were talking,
and...

571
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:52,198
We'd be honored
if you would be my bridesmaid.

572
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:54,243
A-are you sure?

573
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,593
Of course, I want you
up on that altar with me

574
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,857
on the happiest day of my life.

575
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,033
I would love to.

576
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,909
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

577
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:10,042
I think the puffball is winning.

578
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,913
But I was about
to turn the tables.

579
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,393
Fluffy here is lucky
you came along.

580
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:17,614
Thanks so much for doing this.

581
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,140
I know bridal showers
aren't really your thing.

582
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:24,795
Well, we can't all be cloned
from Martha Stewart's evil twin.

583
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,408
So, we have something for you.

584
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,498
Um...

585
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:35,023
Here.

586
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,914
We were going to give it to you
at the wedding, but...

587
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:40,028
now just felt right.

588
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:41,856
It's beautiful.

589
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,946
Thank you.

590
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,906
Thank you for being
my maid of honor.

591
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,603
You're an amazing friend,

592
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:52,301
and... an okay decorator.

593
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,608
It looks like Pinterest

594
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:56,479
puked all over your backyard.

595
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:58,022
And don't forget all
the cringe-worthy games

596
00:31:58,046 --> 00:31:59,415
and activities we've
yet to experience.

597
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,745
- There will be cringing.
- So much cringing.

598
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,460
Could I get everyone's
attention, please?

599
00:32:23,376 --> 00:32:25,508
Ladies, please help me welcome

600
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:27,380
a very special guest,

601
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:29,469
as we play the newlywed game!

602
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,644
Alright!

603
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,345
You owe me.

604
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:43,962
Okay, this game
consists of ten questions.

605
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,225
Mark will have to prove
he knows his betrothed's

606
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:48,357
deepest, darkest secrets,

607
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,968
and for every question wrong

608
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:51,491
he will remove
an article of clothing.

609
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:55,669
Yeah. That's not gonna happen.

610
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:57,584
Well, it was worth a shot.

611
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,325
Okay, Mark. Are you ready?

612
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:02,502
- Let's do this!
- Okay, question one.

613
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:05,853
What is Nicole's

614
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,682
favorite flavor of ice cream?

615
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,293
While, she might tell casual
acquaintances it's cookie dough,

616
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:14,035
the awful truth is
that her favorite

617
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,298
is rum raisin.

618
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,431
- Oh...
- Correct!

619
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,564
It's a legitimate flavor.

620
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:24,176
It's gross, honey. You need
to learn to accept that.

621
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:26,004
Question two.

622
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,789
What is Nicole's biggest fear?

623
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,008
Uh...

624
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:35,883
I'm gonna go with her
irrational fear of birds.

625
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:37,624
- Correct!
- It is not irrational.

626
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,974
- They will peck you!
- Silence!

627
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,455
Yeah!

628
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:44,674
Okay. Question three.

629
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,721
What is Nicole's

630
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:50,593
most embarrassing photo?

631
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:51,942
This one's easy.

632
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,423
Seventh grade,
bowl cut in overalls.

633
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,773
She thought she destroyed
every copy, but...

634
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,384
You didn't!

635
00:33:58,427 --> 00:34:00,473
Show me bowl cut in overalls!

636
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:10,483
Um, that's not...
I, uh, I didn't...

637
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:21,668
Nicole...

638
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,595
I can't believe
she would do that.

639
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:37,292
Nicole...

640
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:38,946
I work with those people.

641
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,035
I-I-I teach their kids.

642
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,125
This is so humiliating.
What were you thinking?

643
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,692
I'm sorry. I don't
know what happened.

644
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:46,954
No, don't do that.

645
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:48,018
You don't get to pull a stunt

646
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,044
like that and then play dumb.

647
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,872
I promise, I didn't.
I would never...

648
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:54,570
Yes, you would! You always do.

649
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:56,157
You always have to be
the center of attention,

650
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,270
and you push it too far!

651
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,620
You humiliated me!

652
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:03,840
I swear I don't know
what happened.

653
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,886
Just go.

654
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,992
You...

655
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:27,037
Audrey!

656
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:29,518
Is it me you hate
or just Nicole?

657
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:33,870
I know you're upset that your
little joke backfired.

658
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:37,700
You can drop the act.
I see who you are.

659
00:35:37,744 --> 00:35:39,852
And I'm going to make sure
everyone else sees it, too.

660
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,443
Celine, are you feeling okay?

661
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,751
Because if stress of being
maid of honor is getting to you,

662
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:47,754
I can take over some
of your responsibilities.

663
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,108
You stay away from
my responsibilities,

664
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,328
and you stay the hell
away from Nicole.

665
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,152
- Hi.
- Hey.

666
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:43,113
She must be so heartbroken.

667
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,593
Can you do me a favor?

668
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,204
Of course.

669
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,945
Can you talk to her?
I'm sort of at a loss here.

670
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:50,208
Absolutely.

671
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,167
I know how to handle this.

672
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,302
It will be okay.

673
00:37:09,879 --> 00:37:11,925
Hi.

674
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:14,971
Look, it's okay to be upset.

675
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:17,147
You have a wedding
and a stepsister in town,

676
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:21,456
and a maid of honor who kind
of stabbed you in the back.

677
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,719
It's hard not to think
everything going wrong

678
00:37:23,763 --> 00:37:25,939
is some kind of sign,

679
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:29,551
like... maybe we're
rushing into things.

680
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,949
Do you believe in signs?

681
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:39,082
I don't know.

682
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:41,084
Maybe.

683
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:45,915
I mean, sometimes
it's hard to ignore.

684
00:37:51,051 --> 00:37:53,662
- I should talk to her.
- No.

685
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:55,597
You know what? You shouldn't be
guilted into anything.

686
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:57,275
She messed up, right?

687
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,886
I mean, it should be you to call
her back when you're ready.

688
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:03,716
You don't wanna say something
that you regret, right?

689
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:06,327
Yeah. You're right.

690
00:38:07,372 --> 00:38:09,243
Thanks, Audrey.

691
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,245
I'm really glad you're here.

692
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,642
I'm gonna get a refill.
Want a cup?

693
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,122
Uh, no. Caffeine makes me
a little crazy.

694
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:34,573
Hey, it's Celine.

695
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:35,637
I know you're pissed at me,

696
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:36,662
but we need to talk.

697
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,359
It's about Audrey.

698
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,815
I looked up a few
of Mark's ex-girlfriends.

699
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,406
Nicole, she's...

700
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:43,712
I think she's dangerous.

701
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,367
I'm working late tonight,
but please call me back.

702
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,938
Hey.

703
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:56,116
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

704
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,944
Yeah, I was just
checking the time.

705
00:38:57,987 --> 00:38:59,424
Big plans tonight?

706
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:01,904
I think something just came up.

707
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:46,688
Nicole, I know
you're avoiding me, but, uh...

708
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:49,299
I have to talk to you.

709
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:51,171
I'm coming over.

710
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,876
It's gonna be okay.

711
00:40:43,919 --> 00:40:46,182
She's still hanging on.
We can't give up on her, right?

712
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:48,794
Okay.

713
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:50,491
This is my fault.

714
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:51,971
No. No.

715
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:56,236
No, it's not.

716
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,933
She just...

717
00:40:57,977 --> 00:41:00,762
She must have fallen. Hey.

718
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:02,285
You can't blame yourself.

719
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:04,462
I should've just
answered her phone call.

720
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:09,031
Nicole, look at me. Look at me.

721
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:11,860
This is not your fault.

722
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:14,646
Bad things happen.

723
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,729
But this isn't something
you're going through alone.

724
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,390
For the rest of our lives,

725
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:24,699
whatever horrible things
life throws at us,

726
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,745
we'll face them together.

727
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,109
♪ I hope we can be much
more than friends ♪

728
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:46,155
♪ So bon appetit je t'aime

729
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:48,462
♪ Bon appetit ♪

730
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:50,769
Audrey.

731
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,901
Hey! I didn't hear you come in.

732
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,924
- What is all this?
- Oh, it's nothing.

733
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:57,384
I just thought
that after your visit

734
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:59,342
you might want
to come home to a hot meal.

735
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:01,910
I've also cleaned up a bit,
if you don't mind,

736
00:42:01,954 --> 00:42:03,714
and there's a hot bath ready,
in case you want to relax

737
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:05,784
before dinner, so take a seat.

738
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:06,872
Take a seat.

739
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,527
You shouldn't have done this.

740
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,920
Oh, it's the least I can do!

741
00:42:11,964 --> 00:42:13,574
That's not what she meant.

742
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:16,316
Nicole has a wedding to plan.

743
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:19,449
The last thing she needs
to worry about is the laundry.

744
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,364
You've been cooped up
so much lately,

745
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:24,280
it must be nice to get out
for the night, huh?

746
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:26,152
There you go.

747
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:36,162
Did I do something wrong?

748
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:38,643
No, it's fine.
It's just Celine is...

749
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,601
How is Celine?

750
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,604
Comatose.

751
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,018
The doctors say
she's hanging in there,

752
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,304
but she hasn't woken up yet.

753
00:42:48,348 --> 00:42:50,480
So awful.

754
00:42:50,524 --> 00:42:52,395
Do they know what happened?

755
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,267
Either she somehow
tripped and fell, or...

756
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,878
- Or?
- Or someone pushed her.

757
00:42:56,922 --> 00:42:59,794
Oh, no... the chicken.

758
00:43:01,274 --> 00:43:03,189
Ah-ah ah-ah ahh!

759
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:06,845
Disaster averted...

760
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:08,107
I hope.

761
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,631
Dinner is almost ready.

762
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,115
Poor thing.

763
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:20,162
Well, looks like
it's just the two of us.

764
00:43:23,949 --> 00:43:25,187
I'm gonna make sure
she's alright.

765
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:26,342
Oh, uh...

766
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:29,519
She probably
needs some space, Mark.

767
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:32,740
I mean,
I went to all this trouble.

768
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:35,613
I mean,
just... stay and eat with me.

769
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:40,835
I'm sorry. Just...

770
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,315
Sorry.

771
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:38,216
Like, this is right there
and I think

772
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,478
that that's probably why you...
- Hey.

773
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:40,765
It's perfectly normal!

774
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:42,288
Morning.

775
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:43,768
How was the run?

776
00:44:43,811 --> 00:44:46,988
It was good. You're right,
I feel better.

777
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:49,948
I guess that's why they call it
exorcising your demons.

778
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:53,691
You're such a dork.
Like, the biggest dork.

779
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,518
Audrey, I thought you
were going shopping.

780
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:57,999
Yeah, I'm gonna wait for you,
so we can go together.

781
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,525
I'm going to have a shower.

782
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:06,573
Actually, Audrey
and I were talking.

783
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:08,749
The wedding's less
than a week away.

784
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:11,839
And now you probably need
more help than ever...

785
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,493
with Celine...

786
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:17,062
So if you want,
I would like you...

787
00:45:17,105 --> 00:45:19,325
to consider me...

788
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:23,068
your maid of honor.

789
00:45:23,111 --> 00:45:24,765
- What?
- Perfect, right?

790
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,593
She can help get things
back on track.

791
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,527
I'm already following up
on Celine's responsibilities.

792
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,355
The venue coordinator is
up to speed on everything.

793
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:31,792
I just need a few details
from you regarding

794
00:45:31,816 --> 00:45:33,228
the bachelorette party,
which I think...

795
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:35,428
There isn't gonna be
a bachelorette party.

796
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:36,751
My best friend's
in the hospital.

797
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:37,778
Nicole, listen.

798
00:45:37,822 --> 00:45:38,779
I don't wanna talk about

799
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,259
replacing my maid of honor.

800
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:42,000
The position is still filled.

801
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:44,306
I'm not saying Celine didn't
make a good maid of honor.

802
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,830
- She did a fine job.
- Do not...

803
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:47,353
refer to her in the past tense.

804
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:49,659
- She's still alive.
- She didn't mean anything by it.

805
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,400
No, she never does.

806
00:45:51,444 --> 00:45:53,324
Can we not do this right now
in front of Audrey?

807
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:56,405
Then when, Mark?

808
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:58,277
She's always here.

809
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:05,110
I'm so sorry.

810
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:22,475
What was that all about?

811
00:46:22,518 --> 00:46:24,129
Which part?

812
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:26,522
The part where you were talking
like Celine's already dead,

813
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:29,090
or the part where we haven't
had 30 seconds to ourselves

814
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:31,789
in two weeks because
your sister's always here?

815
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:33,834
Audrey's crying out there.

816
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:36,924
Mark, I'm going to be your wife.

817
00:46:36,968 --> 00:46:38,970
Could you try defending me,
for once?

818
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:49,894
Um...

819
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:51,983
Sorry.

820
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,377
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

821
00:46:56,683 --> 00:46:59,164
My best friend's
in critical condition.

822
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:01,427
The universe is conspiring
against our wedding.

823
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:03,995
We're fighting
over stupid details.

824
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:06,040
We get married in four days.

825
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:08,608
I don't know how to deal
with all this.

826
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,613
Together.

827
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:19,227
Yeah.

828
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:22,622
Together.

829
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:26,626
Uh, I'm sorry. I'm... sorry.

830
00:47:26,669 --> 00:47:29,063
I just... I feel like
I'm constantly waiting

831
00:47:29,107 --> 00:47:30,586
for the next thing to go wrong.

832
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,721
I guess sooner or later,
we all turn into bridezillas.

833
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:39,508
Well, if you had
to stomp on anyone,

834
00:47:39,552 --> 00:47:41,771
aim for the coordinator.

835
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:43,643
She was kind of mean
to me on the phone.

836
00:47:45,558 --> 00:47:48,256
You probably deserved it.

837
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,779
It's possible.

838
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:52,217
Um, I should go talk to Audrey.

839
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,088
It can wait.

840
00:47:55,611 --> 00:47:57,744
Stay here for a while.

841
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,534
So, this is the one
that I was talking about,

842
00:48:05,578 --> 00:48:08,842
where, like, the hair goes up
but it's also down.

843
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,888
- It looks...
- No, I like that.

844
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:13,542
- I love that dress, too.
- Speaking of dresses...

845
00:48:13,586 --> 00:48:14,761
- We should go.
- Yes.

846
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:16,371
- Yeah.
- I will be ready in one second.

847
00:48:16,415 --> 00:48:18,069
Okay.

848
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,684
Looks like you
patched things up.

849
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:26,904
Yes. We spent the whole day
at the mall yesterday.

850
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,776
She's been
really sweet about it.

851
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:32,170
I still can't believe
I snapped at her like that.

852
00:48:33,867 --> 00:48:37,305
Thank you. It means a lot to me
that you two get along.

853
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:40,656
Just promise me we won't bring
her along for the honeymoon.

854
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,442
- Deal.
- Okay.

855
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:49,187
It's David.

856
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,929
Probably lost his invite.

857
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:54,061
Hey, David. Lose your invite?
I'll...

858
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,804
Wait, what?

859
00:48:57,847 --> 00:49:00,763
- He's in town.
- Already?

860
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:03,462
No, man... We aren't havin'
a bachelor party. We...

861
00:49:04,898 --> 00:49:05,943
They did?

862
00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:10,904
No, I guess...
Yeah, that's great.

863
00:49:11,774 --> 00:49:13,385
I'll see you tonight.

864
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:15,343
Later.

865
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:17,737
Bachelor party?

866
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,826
I thought we were canceling.
Didn't you tell them?

867
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:24,135
I... think this is my fault.

868
00:49:24,178 --> 00:49:26,789
Uh, I didn't know that you
didn't want a bachelor party,

869
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:30,184
so I called everyone, and...

870
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:32,839
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to surprise you.

871
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:35,798
It, it's just because Celine's
still in the hospital, so...

872
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:38,018
They all flew in, Nicole.
I can't just not show.

873
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:41,979
- I'm so...
- Sorry, I know.

874
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,069
Okay, um, just...

875
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:46,853
Try not to be too late, okay?

876
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:49,682
And maybe don't get super drunk
'cause we have a lot of stuff

877
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,510
to do tomorrow
for the wedding, and...

878
00:49:52,598 --> 00:49:54,730
We'll make it an early night.

879
00:49:54,774 --> 00:49:56,123
- And Mark...
- I know.

880
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:59,605
No strippers.
Nothing crazy, I promise.

881
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:02,608
Trust me.

882
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,751
Audrey, can you come in
for a sec? This isn't...

883
00:50:17,492 --> 00:50:19,625
- Of course.
- The zipper must be stuck or...

884
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:21,366
- Yeah.
- Could you...

885
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:24,412
Yeah. Yeah. Hold still.

886
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:27,285
This is so weird. Are you sure
this didn't happen before?

887
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:29,461
Yes, yes. It wasn't this tight.

888
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:31,482
- Nothing was this tight.
- Okay, we will fix this.

889
00:50:31,506 --> 00:50:33,204
Uh, dress lady?

890
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:36,294
You know, a lot of brides
gain weight before the wedding,

891
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:37,599
so it's totally normal.

892
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:40,080
- I didn't gain weight.
- Okay. Okay.

893
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:42,691
Coming in!
How's it going in here?

894
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:45,433
Oh. That's all wrong.

895
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:46,782
Wh-what's wrong?

896
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:49,394
It's... It was taken in
far too much.

897
00:50:49,437 --> 00:50:52,440
Unless you happened to gain
a little weight, or...

898
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:55,139
- No.
- I don't know what went wrong.

899
00:50:55,182 --> 00:50:56,966
- Who took these measurements?
- You did.

900
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,491
You took the measurements.
What did you do?

901
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:00,796
- Audrey...
- No!

902
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,233
It's your-It's your
perfect dress,

903
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:04,017
and you completely
screwed it up!

904
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,759
Well, we'll definitely
take the measurements again

905
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:09,109
and see what we can do.
How much time do we have?

906
00:51:09,153 --> 00:51:11,242
Three days.

907
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:14,941
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
That is impossible.

908
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:17,006
What do you mean, impossible?
W-what does that mean?

909
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,921
Maybe we can try on some
of the other ones you liked,

910
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:22,122
to see if they're a closer fit.

911
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,472
This is my dress. This...

912
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:27,867
Sweetie, I am so sorry.

913
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:31,392
Let me go up front
and see what we got in today.

914
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:32,741
Hey.

915
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:35,744
We will find you a bigger dress.

916
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,572
It's not just the dress.

917
00:51:37,616 --> 00:51:40,184
This is supposed to be the most
important day of our lives,

918
00:51:40,227 --> 00:51:43,012
and nothing has gone right.

919
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:45,580
Maybe we shouldn't be
getting married right now.

920
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:48,627
Maybe we just rushed into it.

921
00:51:50,281 --> 00:51:52,979
Is there anything...

922
00:51:53,022 --> 00:51:55,199
I can do?

923
00:51:55,242 --> 00:51:57,679
No. No. Thank you.

924
00:51:57,723 --> 00:51:58,985
Just wanna think.

925
00:52:07,515 --> 00:52:09,343
Okay.

926
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:28,145
Hey.

927
00:52:28,188 --> 00:52:30,582
Hey. Uh, what are
you doing here?

928
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:31,907
I thought you had
your bachelor party.

929
00:52:31,931 --> 00:52:33,846
Charlie's on his way
to pick me up.

930
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,369
Is Nicole here?

931
00:52:35,413 --> 00:52:36,738
I wanted to talk to her
before I left.

932
00:52:36,762 --> 00:52:40,113
Yeah. She wanted
some time alone.

933
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:43,160
She has a lot on her mind.

934
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:47,033
Everything alright?

935
00:52:47,076 --> 00:52:48,165
Mm.

936
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:51,255
Come on. Talk to me.

937
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,476
It's just, um...

938
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:01,047
Something Nicole said.

939
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:28,248
I hope you don't plan
on taking advantage of me.

940
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,729
Welcome back.

941
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:32,948
And... maybe it's just stress.

942
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:36,169
It's just, she doesn't
seem like herself lately.

943
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,258
Things have been a bit tense.

944
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,738
Mm-hmm.

945
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:41,653
What did she say?

946
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:43,611
I don't know, Mark, it's...

947
00:53:43,655 --> 00:53:45,657
not my, you know...

948
00:53:46,614 --> 00:53:49,530
Audrey, what?

949
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,580
She said that,
with everything going wrong,

950
00:53:55,623 --> 00:53:57,495
that maybe you guys
got in over your head,

951
00:53:57,538 --> 00:54:01,455
and maybe you should slow down.

952
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,721
Slow down?

953
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:12,292
She said she wanted
to postpone the wedding.

954
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:13,641
She said that?

955
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:15,034
Mm-hmm.

956
00:54:16,992 --> 00:54:18,820
I'm so happy you're alright.

957
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:20,300
How are you feeling?

958
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,607
I've been better.

959
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,652
The pain meds
aren't too bad, though.

960
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,616
Nicole, I'm sorry.

961
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:34,532
I don't think I'll be walking
down an aisle any time soon.

962
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:37,317
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

963
00:54:39,014 --> 00:54:43,367
Besides, I don't think
there's going to be a wedding.

964
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,411
What?

965
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,763
I think
we just rushed into things.

966
00:54:48,807 --> 00:54:51,200
You know, I...

967
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:52,854
I thought I could handle it,
but...

968
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,988
everything is falling apart.

969
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:59,121
Things have been so tense
between Mark and me.

970
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:01,036
Maybe it's not
meant to be right now.

971
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,170
Nicole, you can't honestly think

972
00:55:04,213 --> 00:55:06,520
that all of this is your fault,

973
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:11,438
that everything that's happened
is some sort of coincidence.

974
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:13,048
What do you mean?

975
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:16,704
I found some things out
about Audrey.

976
00:55:16,748 --> 00:55:19,490
She's dangerous.

977
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:21,143
She wants to stop the wedding?

978
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:23,363
And look, that's why I
didn't want to say anything,

979
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:25,452
because she's overwhelmed,
and so are you.

980
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:27,367
I mean, planning a wedding
in three weeks

981
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,151
can send any relationship

982
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:30,979
off the rails, Mark.

983
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:34,679
I know we've been
a little bit out of sync,

984
00:55:34,722 --> 00:55:36,898
but I didn't think
it was anything this serious.

985
00:55:36,942 --> 00:55:38,944
You should talk to her.

986
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:45,690
Maybe you should
call off the wedding.

987
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,605
I mean, just for now.

988
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:51,522
With everything that happened
with Rachel, you...

989
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:54,699
You know you don't want
to rush into things.

990
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:00,182
Mark. Mark. Mark.

991
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,925
Whatever happens...

992
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,365
I am here.

993
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:23,510
Marky Mark! It's party time!

994
00:56:23,554 --> 00:56:26,600
Yeah. Just, uh,
give me a second.

995
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:30,038
What's up with him?

996
00:56:30,082 --> 00:56:33,694
- He and Nicole are fighting.
- Seriously?

997
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:36,567
Your brother has
the worst luck with women.

998
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,402
So, where is the party tonight?

999
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:47,882
My place.
We're just hanging out.

1000
00:56:47,926 --> 00:56:49,580
Can I crash?

1001
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:51,320
Uh...

1002
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:54,411
I was totally kidding.

1003
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:57,370
Come with me.

1004
00:57:01,853 --> 00:57:04,464
Uh, Mark's probably gonna
try and be a downer

1005
00:57:04,508 --> 00:57:06,379
and come home early,
so do me a favor.

1006
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,381
Buy a few bottles
of the good stuff, on me,

1007
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,296
and make sure...

1008
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:13,038
he has... a good time.

1009
00:57:14,343 --> 00:57:16,302
I'll make sure.

1010
00:57:16,345 --> 00:57:17,888
He's a lucky guy
to have you in his life.

1011
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:20,480
Oh. Sweet.

1012
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:22,569
You ready? Let's do this.

1013
00:57:22,613 --> 00:57:25,093
Come on. I can't
stay out too late.

1014
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:28,880
Can you try to have a good time?

1015
00:57:28,923 --> 00:57:31,273
- That I can promise.
- Okay.

1016
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,728
He loves me.

1017
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,819
He loves me not.

1018
00:57:56,385 --> 00:57:58,823
He loves me.

1019
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,567
He loves me not.

1020
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:06,395
He loves me.

1021
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,009
He loves me not.

1022
00:58:12,358 --> 00:58:14,621
He loves me.

1023
00:58:20,366 --> 00:58:22,194
He loves me.

1024
00:58:24,152 --> 00:58:25,980
He loves me.

1025
00:58:30,202 --> 00:58:31,725
He loves me.

1026
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:43,824
Hello?

1027
00:58:45,652 --> 00:58:46,914
Mark?

1028
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:55,314
Audrey?

1029
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:33,613
You remember that girlfriend

1030
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:35,659
that you talked about,
Becca Gould?

1031
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:38,966
I talked to her.

1032
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,707
You talked to her?

1033
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:44,189
- Celine...
- Audrey is lying.

1034
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,887
Becca never cheated on Mark.

1035
00:59:46,931 --> 00:59:50,064
And she never hit Audrey.

1036
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:52,414
She thinks
that Audrey hurt herself.

1037
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:54,852
Why would she do that?
That's crazy.

1038
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,463
I know.

1039
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:59,813
It's not the first time
it happened.

1040
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:04,775
She pointed me
to a lot of girlfriends

1041
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:06,515
that Mark has dated,

1042
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,909
and they all
said the same thing.

1043
01:00:08,953 --> 01:00:11,825
How wonderful Mark is...

1044
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,959
and how possessive
his stepsister is.

1045
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:19,746
Celine, you had
a really big fall...

1046
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,618
and you're on a lot of drugs.

1047
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:23,924
Nicole...

1048
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,839
I didn't fall.

1049
01:00:27,362 --> 01:00:29,626

01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,105
Oh, wow.

1065
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,078
Whoo!

1066
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:27,368
Hey.

1067
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,505
Hi, baby.

1068
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,552
- Sorry I was so late, I, uh...
- We need to talk.

1069
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:43,602
Is it about the wedding?

1070
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:46,083
- Audrey told me you...
- No, I...

1071
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:48,085
Wait, what did Audrey tell you?

1072
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:51,871
She said you told her you
were having second thoughts.

1073
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,830
- Is that true?
- No!

1074
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:57,485
I mean...
Yes, I did tell her that, but...

1075
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:59,270
So you can talk
to my sister but not to me?

1076
01:03:59,313 --> 01:04:02,534
I'm trying to talk to you
about your sister.

1077
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,623
Celine's awake.

1078
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,886
She told me she learned
some stuff about Audrey.

1079
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,385
At first I didn't know
whether or not to believe...

1080
01:04:08,409 --> 01:04:09,976
Why is Celine
investigating Audrey?

1081
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,848
Because she knew
something wasn't normal.

1082
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:14,676
And, and she was right.
I found this.

1083
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:23,424
So you're investigating
my sister, too?

1084
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:27,211
Wait. You knew about this?

1085
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,082
She's had some problems, Nicole.

1086
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:30,668
It doesn't mean
you can invade her privacy.

1087
01:04:30,692 --> 01:04:33,826
Invade her privacy?
She's staying in our home.

1088
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,151
I thought we said
no more secrets?

1089
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:37,177
This isn't my secret to tell!

1090
01:04:38,657 --> 01:04:41,355
Uh, I'm gonna leave you two...

1091
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:43,183
No, you'll get out of my house.

1092
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,925
- What?
- Audrey, don't go anywhere!

1093
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:48,188
If you have a problem
with my sister, you can leave.

1094
01:04:48,232 --> 01:04:50,408
But it's fine. Mark, can you
take me to a hotel?

1095
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:53,280
No. Mark can't drive.
Mark's had too much to drink.

1096
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,543
I'll call you a cab.

1097
01:04:55,587 --> 01:04:58,242
Just, just stay here, okay?
It's fine. I'll handle this.

1098
01:04:58,285 --> 01:04:59,939
It's fine.

1099
01:04:59,983 --> 01:05:01,941
- You had a stripper tonight?
- What?

1100
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:04,639
After you looked me in the eyes
and said, "Trust me?"

1101
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,728
- How did you...
- It doesn't matter how.

1102
01:05:08,774 --> 01:05:11,429
I didn't ask for her.
She just showed up.

1103
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,692
Strippers don't just appear,
Mark. They get hired.

1104
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:15,563
I told them no.
Charlie must have hired her.

1105
01:05:15,607 --> 01:05:17,130
Did Charlie put her
on your lap, too?

1106
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:19,065
- Nicole, I think...
- I don't care what you think.

1107
01:05:19,089 --> 01:05:21,091
Get out of my house!

1108
01:05:25,878 --> 01:05:27,488
Audrey, don't...

1109
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:30,927
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me!

1110
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,233
Something is wrong
with your sister.

1111
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:34,582
Mark, listen.

1112
01:05:34,626 --> 01:05:37,281
Have we ever fought like this?

1113
01:05:37,324 --> 01:05:39,196
Ever?

1114
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:41,241
Not until she showed up.

1115
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,815
When you found this,
was it empty?

1116
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:51,382
They all were.

1117
01:05:51,425 --> 01:05:53,340
Damn it. She's off her meds.

1118
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:58,780
Audrey is sick, Nicole. Okay?

1119
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:00,521
She's not crazy. She's not evil.

1120
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,610
- She's my sister and she's sick.
- Mark...

1121
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:04,482
But if you think she's
trying to sabotage me

1122
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:07,398
or my chance at happiness...

1123
01:06:07,441 --> 01:06:09,269
you're sick, too.

1124
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:15,536
I think you're right.

1125
01:06:17,147 --> 01:06:18,931
Maybe we should
call off the wedding.

1126
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:47,829
Audrey, it's Nicole.

1127
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:49,875
I don't know what to say.

1128
01:06:51,268 --> 01:06:53,096
I'm so sorry.

1129
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:57,230
Please come home.

1130
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,922
Mark, I know you're angry, okay,
but you've got to come home.

1131
01:07:36,965 --> 01:07:37,966
It's Audrey. I...

1132
01:07:43,363 --> 01:07:44,625
Mark?

1133
01:07:55,636 --> 01:07:58,422
You're trying to take him
away from me?

1134
01:07:58,465 --> 01:07:59,640
Audrey, please.

1135
01:07:59,684 --> 01:08:00,902
Everyone always tries

1136
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:02,513
to take him away, but you can't.

1137
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:03,644
We're meant to be together.

1138
01:08:03,688 --> 01:08:05,690
It's fate.

1139
01:08:07,996 --> 01:08:12,349
You have to embrace
your fate, Nicole!

1140
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:14,090
Audrey, what are you doing?

1141
01:08:14,133 --> 01:08:16,092
She's trying to
take you away, Mark.

1142
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:20,139
She's trying to keep us apart!

1143
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,446
Audrey, listen to me.

1144
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:26,014
Put the knife down.

1145
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:27,103
Let me help you.

1146
01:08:27,146 --> 01:08:29,627
Help? No, no, no.

1147
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:31,411
I'm not going back
to the hospital, no.

1148
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:33,041
- No, I'm not going back there.
- It's just...

1149
01:08:33,065 --> 01:08:35,807
I belong here with you, Mark!

1150
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:39,506
- Audrey...
- Can't you see what she's doing?

1151
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,683
Everything was fine. Hmm?

1152
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:46,122
Until you decided to marry her.

1153
01:08:46,165 --> 01:08:48,254
I got better for you.

1154
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,189
- I'm fine. I'm fine!
- Okay, that's, that's enough.

1155
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:52,389
That's enough. That's enough.

1156
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:56,044
You're choosing her
over your own sister.

1157
01:08:57,524 --> 01:08:59,135
I'm not going back there.

1158
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:01,920
No, I'm not going back.
You can't make me go back.

1159
01:09:01,963 --> 01:09:03,550
- Let's talk about this.
- No. I'm going to die.

1160
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:05,489
- No! No!
- Mark...

1161
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:07,534
Audrey, let us help you.

1162
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:12,501
- Audrey. Audrey.
- Please don't make me go back.

1163
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:15,151
Audrey, I love you.

1164
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,502
I would never hurt you.

1165
01:09:19,677 --> 01:09:21,809
You know that, don't you?

1166
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:24,595
You love me?

1167
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:26,031
Yes.

1168
01:09:27,206 --> 01:09:29,904
Please, let me help you.

1169
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:34,692
I love you.

1170
01:09:39,958 --> 01:09:42,700
Please, never leave me.

1171
01:09:42,743 --> 01:09:45,311
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1172
01:09:45,355 --> 01:09:47,400
- Please.
- I promise.

1173
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:48,619
- Please.
- I promise.

1174
01:09:48,662 --> 01:09:50,664
Please don't leave me.

1175
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,075
How is she?

1176
01:10:10,118 --> 01:10:12,730
My parents are taking her
back to the hospital.

1177
01:10:12,773 --> 01:10:14,993
They'll stay with her
until she's stable.

1178
01:10:23,523 --> 01:10:24,872
I'm sorry.

1179
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:28,136
I shouldn't have
kept this from you.

1180
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,620
I understand if you don't want
to go through with the wedding.

1181
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:36,014
Call it off?

1182
01:10:36,057 --> 01:10:38,451
After everything you've seen
in the past two weeks?

1183
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:43,761
I've seen some terrible things.

1184
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:48,113
But I also saw the way
you handled Audrey...

1185
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,812
and how much you love her...

1186
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:55,642
how much you love me.

1187
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,820
Mark, if we can
get through this,

1188
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:03,781
anything else life throws
at us will be easy.

1189
01:11:09,613 --> 01:11:11,615
Are you sure you want this?

1190
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,096
I'm sure.

1191
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,981
Also, the deposit
on the honeymoon

1192
01:11:30,024 --> 01:11:31,591
is non-refundable.

1193
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:34,159
So...

1194
01:11:52,438 --> 01:11:54,962
- Hey.
- Hey, are you there?

1195
01:11:55,006 --> 01:11:56,529
I'm just arriving now.

1196
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:59,184
- Is it everything you hoped for?
- It's perfect.

1197
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:01,795
Actually, no, it's not.

1198
01:12:01,839 --> 01:12:04,929
I wish you were here.
It's not going to be the same.

1199
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:06,539
Yeah, you're right.
You should cancel.

1200
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:10,935
The way things have gone,
if I don't get married today,

1201
01:12:10,978 --> 01:12:13,198
I don't think
I'll get another chance.

1202
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:16,549
Fair enough. How's the dress?

1203
01:12:16,593 --> 01:12:19,378
Not what I wanted,
but... it'll do.

1204
01:12:19,422 --> 01:12:21,554
You should write
that on the cake.

1205
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,557
Okay, well, um...

1206
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:25,950
You have some marrying to do,

1207
01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:28,474
and I have physical therapy,
so, um...

1208
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:30,626
You're still coming to visit
before the reception, right?

1209
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:31,695
Of course.

1210
01:12:31,738 --> 01:12:34,915
You'd better, and, Nicole...

1211
01:12:34,959 --> 01:12:36,961
Congratulations.

1212
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,441
I love you.

1213
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:39,877
Love you, too.

1214
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,884
Wonderful to see you again,
Miss Cavanaugh.

1215
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,842
Care to follow me
to the bridal suite?

1216
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,714
Lead the way.

1217
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:57,285
Okay, everything is all set
and running smoothly.

1218
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:59,549
All you need to do is get ready.

1219
01:12:59,592 --> 01:13:00,767
Where were you last week?

1220
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:03,117
Have a vanity here,

1221
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:05,163
bathtub, bathroom through there.

1222
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:07,513
I'll give you some space,
but if you need anything,

1223
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:09,167
just holler, I'm right nearby.

1224
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:10,821
Thank you.

1225
01:13:19,699 --> 01:13:21,571
Nicole...

1226
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:38,326
Hello?

1227
01:13:55,387 --> 01:13:58,695
- Hello, bride.
- Hi.

1228
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:01,001
- You okay?
- Yeah! Sorry.

1229
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:02,960
Just... nerves.

1230
01:14:03,003 --> 01:14:04,831
I've got just the thing
for that.

1231
01:14:05,963 --> 01:14:08,574
Wow, bottom shelf. I'm swooning.

1232
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:10,968
You should be. That's what
we drank on our first date.

1233
01:14:12,012 --> 01:14:14,841
- Mark!
- So.

1234
01:14:14,885 --> 01:14:18,062
How about a quick toast before
becoming my legal property?

1235
01:14:18,105 --> 01:14:21,065
Mm, you're so funny,
but no. I'm in my dress.

1236
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:24,547
- You can't be in here. Now go!
- Uh, okay. Okay, okay. Just...

1237
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:29,160
I came here
because I had to see you.

1238
01:14:29,203 --> 01:14:31,249
And tell you...

1239
01:14:31,292 --> 01:14:33,556
after everything
we've been through,

1240
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,558
I've never been more sure.

1241
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:37,385
I can't wait to marry you.

1242
01:14:37,429 --> 01:14:39,431
And we are going to be...

1243
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:42,216
so happy.

1244
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:48,005
Then you better let me
finish getting ready.

1245
01:14:48,048 --> 01:14:50,050
See you at the altar.

1246
01:15:25,956 --> 01:15:28,698
I don't think the blood is gonna
come out of your dress.

1247
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:38,446
I suppose it doesn't matter.

1248
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:39,796
Hmm?

1249
01:15:39,839 --> 01:15:41,885
Since you left Mark
at the altar.

1250
01:15:43,234 --> 01:15:46,019
First Rachel, then Nicole.

1251
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:50,633
You, uh,
couldn't stand the pain,

1252
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:55,942
so you overdosed,
right here in your room.

1253
01:15:55,986 --> 01:15:57,988
Don't worry. You left a note.

1254
01:15:59,163 --> 01:16:01,948
Recognize the handwriting?

1255
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:04,124
You said yourself
I was pretty good at it.

1256
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,539
Nicole? Five-minute warning.

1257
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,585
Everything okay in there?

1258
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:33,197
Be right out!

1259
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:36,940
Okay!

1260
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,294
We'd better go.

1261
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:45,601
Wedding's about to start.

Audrey?

1270
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,380
Yes, my darling.

1271
01:18:10,381 --> 01:18:11,861
I'm here.

1272
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:13,514
What the hell is going on?

1273
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,039
Where is Nicole?

1274
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:18,215
I am so sorry.

1275
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:20,826
She's gone.

1276
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:22,567
What are you talking about?

1277
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:24,830
She left you this.

1278
01:18:37,016 --> 01:18:39,149
She left you, Mark.

1279
01:18:39,192 --> 01:18:41,151
Everyone leaves you.

1280
01:18:41,194 --> 01:18:43,370
Except for me.

1281
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:46,373
What did you do?

1282
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:50,290
It's so beautiful.

1283
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:53,598
It's so perfect.

1284
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:58,603
Everyone's here for us.

1285
01:19:00,518 --> 01:19:03,739
Everything will be perfect
if you just say, "I do."

1286
01:19:08,178 --> 01:19:09,483
Nicole!

1287
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:19,319
Mark?

1288
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:27,980
Mark?

1289
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:31,331
Oh, sh... Nicole. Nicole.

1290
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:35,466
♪ ...You to death

1291
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:36,989
Mark!

1292
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,578
What did you do?

1293
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:03,059
She's gone, Mark.

1294
01:20:04,103 --> 01:20:05,496
We can still have our wedding.

1295
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:06,889
They're all still
waiting for us.

1296
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:09,021
You're my sister!

1297
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:15,506
Who are you calling, Mark?

1298
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:18,639
I need an ambulance.
My fiancee, she's not breathing.

1299
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:20,206
Stop it!

1300
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,426
I know you love me,
just like I love you.

1301
01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:27,083
Don't make me do something
we'll both regret.

1302
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:30,782
- Audrey, you were getting help.
- I know you love me, Mark.

1303
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,872
We danced together...

1304
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,918
at the bachelor party.

1305
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:37,963
We never danced at the bach...

1306
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:41,924
The stripper. That was you?

1307
01:20:41,967 --> 01:20:45,231
Oh, didn't that feel so good?

1308
01:20:45,275 --> 01:20:47,407
Didn't that feel right, Mark?

1309
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:49,409
Let me take care of you.

1310
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:51,629
Get away from me! You're crazy!

1311
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,413
She doesn't care about you!

1312
01:20:53,457 --> 01:20:54,588
You're out of your mind!

1313
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,199
She doesn't care
about you, Mark!

1314
01:21:02,161 --> 01:21:05,469
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mark.

1315
01:21:05,512 --> 01:21:07,906
I can help you down the aisle.
It's gonna be okay.

1316
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:10,300
Get away from me,
you crazy bitch!

1317
01:21:13,129 --> 01:21:15,827
I am so sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean it.

1318
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:19,918
I did.

1319
01:21:19,962 --> 01:21:21,311
Oh, Nicole, thank God.

1320
01:21:22,616 --> 01:21:24,836
You're alive. Thank... You're...

1321
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,272
No! Audrey, no!

1322
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,239
He loves me! He loves me!

1323
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:43,463
He loves me. He loves me.
He loves me.

1324
01:21:54,518 --> 01:21:55,998
Nicole.

1325
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:06,182
Nicole.

1326
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,462
Hey, it's okay.

1327
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,845
Audrey?

1328
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,895
Thank you for coming.

1329
01:23:07,939 --> 01:23:09,375
I, um...

1330
01:23:10,594 --> 01:23:13,205
I know you didn't have to.

1331
01:23:13,249 --> 01:23:15,512
We heard how well you're doing.

1332
01:23:15,555 --> 01:23:18,080
Yeah, Dr. Lucado says
I'm making real progress.

1333
01:23:20,343 --> 01:23:23,781
And part of the treatment plan
is, um, making amends

1334
01:23:23,824 --> 01:23:26,175
for those that I've... hurt,

1335
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:28,351
and I just want to say, um...

1336
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:32,355
I'm really sorry.

1337
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,749
I didn't realize
what I was doing.

1338
01:23:35,793 --> 01:23:37,838
Audrey, we know.

1339
01:23:38,752 --> 01:23:40,537
We forgive you.

1340
01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,018
I don't know how you can forgive
me after what I've done.

1341
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:46,151
That wasn't you, Audrey.
We know that.

1342
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,417
I don't know how to thank you
for forgiving me.

1343
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:53,419
You just work on getting better.

1344
01:23:53,463 --> 01:23:56,509
That's all we want.

1345
01:23:56,553 --> 01:23:58,555
Do you have it?

1346
01:24:02,254 --> 01:24:04,604
Are you sure?

1347
01:24:04,648 --> 01:24:06,867
Yeah. No, I need
to see it to, um...

1348
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:10,567
remind myself of what's real.

1349
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:20,316
After everything,
we decided to keep it simple.

1350
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,971
It's so beautiful.

1351
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:33,068
I think our time's up.

1352
01:24:34,808 --> 01:24:38,116
Thank you for coming.
I know it can't have been easy.

1353
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,553
We'll always be here
for you, Audrey.

1354
01:24:40,597 --> 01:24:42,599
You're our sister.

1355
01:25:46,228 --> 01:25:48,143
He loves me.

1356
01:25:53,278 --> 01:25:55,280
He loves me not.

1357
01:25:58,109 --> 01:26:00,416
He loves me.

1358
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:05,769
He loves me not.

1359
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:16,171
He loves me.
