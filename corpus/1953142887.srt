1
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,737
They call it the Dragon Age...

2
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,575
a time of political strife,
savage beasts and powerful magic...

3
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,576
but also a time of faith...
faith in the Chantry ofAndraste,

4
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:27,119
a dominant religious order led
by her holiness, the Divine...

5
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,956
Her Templar knights exert
harsh control over the Mages,

6
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,026
restricting the
practice of the arcane

7
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,094
magical arts they believe
have the potential

8
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,863
to unleash a blight upon the world...

9
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:41,366
The most dangerous of these are
the Blood Mages who continue

10
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:46,367
to perform their dark rituals in secret...
in defiance of the Chantry.

11
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,508
Determined to neutralize
this threat at any cost,

12
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:53,812
the Templar's methods become
more brutal and their suspicions rise,

13
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:57,683
even extending to the
loyal Circle of Magi...

14
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:02,488
Corruption infects the Templar ranks
as the leadership sees their role shift

15
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,724
from control and protection...
to suppression.

16
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:10,295
As tensions boil within the Chantry,
the balance of power has been maintained

17
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:14,500
by the Seekers, the finest
and most loyal of the Templars

18
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,369
Handpicked by the Divine herself...

19
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,241
these defenders of truth root out
corruption, wherever it may be found,

20
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,712
be it from rogue Mages, or within
the halls of the Chantry itself.

21
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:30,149
Now the Ten Year
"Gathering of the Faithful" looms,

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,650
and pilgrims from all corners
of the world journey

23
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,150
to the Orlaisian Empire
to pray for peace...

24
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:40,794
A peace that those in the
shadows are plotting to shatter.

25
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,946
Brothers!

26
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:12,947
A new era for Mages
everywhere is about to begin!

27
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:25,976
Now, Avexis, the time
has come to join our cause.

28
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,308
Keep your focus, Cassandra.

29
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:12,222
Don't let your fury run
away with you again.

30
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,914
I know, Byron.

31
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,020
Trust in the Maker.

32
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:30,162
It's useless to resist, Avexis.

33
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,931
Drink.. Drink your destiny...

34
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,566
Brother Frenic...

35
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,207
If she drinks any more, it will kill her..

36
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,953
I will decide when she's had enough.
Is that understood?!

37
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,350
For the Chantry!

38
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,423
For the Chantry!

39
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,140
Ha!

40
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,605
Now, release it!

41
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,292
Enough, Cassandra!
Gather your wits. We have work to do.

42
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,769
I'll draw its eye.
Don't keep me waiting!

43
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:19,638
Hey!

44
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,542
That's right! Come on! Come and get me!

45
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,573
There's nowhere left to run, Mage.

46
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,918
Release the girl and submit!

47
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,853
Make way!

48
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,922
You're from one of the
dragon-hunting clans.

49
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:13,096
It seems I'm outmatched...

50
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,910
Spineless Blood Mage!

51
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,302
You may rise.

52
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,638
We applaud your recent
efforts, High Seeker.

53
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,975
However, your report
also raises many concerns.

54
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:08,647
To think this is all happening
so close to the Ten Year Gathering...

55
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:11,917
Surely it is not a coincidence.

56
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:16,555
We're already taking
extra precautions, Most Holy.

57
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,435
So you managed to bring back
a little Blood Mage girl?

58
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:24,095
Avexis is not a Blood Mage, Your Grace.

59
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,100
She was taken from the Circle of Magi.

60
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:33,638
It's true. She went
missing from the Circle a few weeks ago.

61
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,849
Presumably kidnapped.
We've been searching for her since.

62
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,581
I am most grateful for
her rescue, High Seeker.

63
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,683
We will come for her soon.

64
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,954
I'm afraid I cannot allow
that, First Enchanter.

65
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,256
And why not?

66
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,858
She was the focus of the ritual,

67
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:58,029
and is obviously vital to whatever
the Blood Mages are planning.

68
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,002
She will remain in my custody
until we get to the bottom of this.

69
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,710
Did the Seekers really bring down a drake?

70
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,386
Yes, Your Reverence. It was Cassandra.

71
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,018
You are to be commended
for your exceptional bravery.

72
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,454
I would expect nothing
less from a Pentaghast.

73
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,163
Your family's dragon-hunting
skills are legendary.

74
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:31,225
You honor us, Grand Cleric.
We are proud to serve the Chantry.

75
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:36,635
You have my praise as well, High Seeker.

76
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:41,244
Another notable success
by your loyal order.

77
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,208
However, it seems rather
reckless to risk your

78
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,708
small numbers against
Blood Mage ceremonies.

79
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:54,897
Perhaps if you shared your intelligence,
my Templars could better assist you.

80
00:10:56,088 --> 00:11:01,697
There are times when stealth and
discretion are more valuable than numbers.

81
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:07,065
Are you implying you don't
trust us to act with discretion?

82
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,568
Ensuring that you do is one of our duties.

83
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,671
Or have you forgotten, Knight Commander?

84
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,915
Gentlemen, remember where you are.

85
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,912
My deepest apologies, Your Holiness.

86
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:25,794
With your permission, we shall take our
leave and return to our investigation.

87
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,322
Such violence before
bed will give you nightmares.

88
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,302
Let's see what you've got!

89
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:02,013
There's nothing left for me
to teach you about swordplay.

90
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,949
I know no man tougher
than you with a blade.

91
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,819
But you just bested me.

92
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,790
Yes, but you weren't fighting
with everything you have, were you?

93
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,791
Perhaps, but you had me completely
at your mercy with that final move.

94
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:22,077
Sometimes your blade becomes your shield
and your shield becomes your blade.

95
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,173
Your prejudice misleads
yourjudgment, Cassandra.

96
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,976
To see the truth, you must look
through the eyes of your heart,

97
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,345
and not just the ones in your head.

98
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:37,759
Not everything is what it
appears on the surface.

99
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:44,351
Sorry, I must sound just
like a father lecturing his child.

100
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,530
I'd be proud to have you as a father.

101
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,372
Good night, Byron.

102
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,352
One of the Circle of Magi dogs
was able to sniff out our ritual.

103
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,755
However, its purpose still eludes them.

104
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:23,069
As long as we get Avexis back,
we can proceed as planned.

105
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,439
It's far too dangerous to
continue meeting like this.

106
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:34,969
Here. This is a rare Elven Stone
you can use to communicate with me.

107
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,942
Keep it on your person at all times.

108
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,378
Should you discover any
more useful information,

109
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,249
my Mages and I will be ready to act.

110
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,886
Victory will be ours.

111
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,885
Byron! What are you doing?

112
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,653
There's no time to explain.

113
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,855
Go back to your quarters
and forget what you've seen here.

114
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,458
That's not what you trained me to do.

115
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,362
I trained you to follow orders. Now go!

116
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,967
Byron;

117
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,342
Tell me where you're taking her.

118
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,177
I can't say.

119
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,312
I'm on an important mission.

120
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,981
What is it?

121
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,258
I don't want to involve you in this.

122
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,422
Raise the alarm! Men down!
There's been an intruder!

123
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,891
Someone has taken the girl!
...Search the grounds!

124
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,236
Find her!
...They can't have gotten far!

125
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,276
Come on.

126
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,534
Byron and Cassandra
have taken the girl!

127
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,770
Inform the High Seeker.

128
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,406
The rest of you, follow me!

129
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,115
Hya!

130
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,401
We'll wait here.

131
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,005
For what?

132
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,441
Byron;

133
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:01,245
Yes... I suppose
you're a part of this now...

134
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:06,246
I don't know all the details yet,
but I've been investigating a conspiracy.

135
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,032
That's how I found out about
the Blood Mage ceremony.

136
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,325
Is the High Seeker aware of this?

137
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:19,326
No... I fear the conspiracy goes
all the way to the Chantry.

138
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,600
And you suspect the High Seeker?!

139
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,270
I'm a Seeker.
I'm trained to suspect everyone.

140
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,842
Do you even know
what you are suggesting?!

141
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,343
To doubt the High Seeker <i>is...</i>

142
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,150
This elf girl supposedly has
the ability to control wild beasts.

143
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,719
That's why the Blood Mages wanted her.

144
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,957
That's a rare power, but what
does it have to do with the conspiracy?

145
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:50,161
I don't know yet. But I'm convinced
she's the key to all of it.

146
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,029
And because the High Seeker refused

147
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,999
to return her to the Circle,
you think that means...?

148
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,703
I'm not sure what
to think about any of it!

149
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:02,240
For now, I'm taking Avexis
to a friend I know I can trust.

150
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,087
Who? Tell me!

151
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:37,175
Are these the friends you were waiting for?

152
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:42,182
We can't take on these numbers
and protect the girl. We must retreat.

153
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,553
Go!

154
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,221
Cassandra, wait!

155
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:53,558
Hya!

156
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,229
Behind you!

157
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,135
Byron;

158
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,573
I'll be taking what is mine, Seeker.

159
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,843
No... Avexis...

160
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,087
Release her! Now!

161
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,756
Seeker reinforcements are approaching...

162
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:05,531
Your comrades are
too late, Dragon Hunter...

163
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,773
This round... belongs to me...

164
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:16,340
Byron;

165
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,453
Go after them...

166
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,856
We must get Avexis back...

167
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,858
The Chantry is in peril...

168
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,237
I should have listened to you...

169
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,400
Cassandra...

170
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:45,539
Hate can only breed more hate...

171
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,077
Byron;

172
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,503
Filthy murdering Mage!

173
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,205
I-I'm not the one you want!

174
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,345
Where did your
accomplices take Avexis?!

175
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,081
Stop! You have the wrong person!

176
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,549
Silence, Blood Mage!

177
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,619
No, I'm a Circle Mage,
not a Blood Mage!

178
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,930
A Mage is a Mage!

179
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,802
There they are!

180
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:55,615
Stand down! Lower your weapon, Cassandra!

181
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:01,712
You have some explaining to do.

182
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,214
He's dead!

183
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,583
What?! What happened here? Talk!

184
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,918
These Blood Mages killed Byron.

185
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,588
I'm telling you, I had no
part in this, I swear it!

186
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,089
Where's the girl?

187
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,124
They took her.

188
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,059
Or perhaps you gave her to them!

189
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,562
Why did you and Byron
remove her from her guard?

190
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,304
Talk, Cassandra!

191
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,269
So be it. Take her into
custody! And the Mage as well!

192
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,571
What?!

193
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,074
Listen, we have to get Avexis
back as soon as possible.

194
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,642
In danger!

195
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,954
You had your chance.
Save it for the High Seeker.

196
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,028
Byron came here to meet me.

197
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:53,771
I promised him that I'd
take Avexis to a safe place.

198
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,441
There's no way those Blood Mages
could've known to follow you here tonight.

199
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,479
Not without spies on the inside.

200
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,451
Byron suspected that someone within
the Chantry is behind a conspiracy.

201
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,686
If he was right, and we let
these Seekers take us back,

202
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,622
there's a good chance
we will be "silenced."

203
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,391
Shut up, Mage!

204
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,133
There a problem?

205
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,134
Keep it down back there.

206
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,636
Circle Mages have pledged
their allegiance to the Chantry.

207
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,139
It's Blood Mages who are the opposition.

208
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,384
Please don't assume I'm one of them,
but I can find out where they are.

209
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,715
You said yourself
that if we don't get

210
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:48,215
Avexis back, something
terrible will happen.

211
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,532
And Byron will have then
lost his life for nothing.

212
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,665
Are you sure you know a way to find Avexis?

213
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,873
Byron risked defying our
Order to protect her.

214
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:13,186
It seems that if I am to discover
the truth, I will have to do the same.

215
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,617
This man has a knife!

216
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,519
What?!

217
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,922
Hm?
...What's going on over there?

218
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:29,527
We told you to surrender
your weapons, Mage. Where is it?!

219
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,695
No sudden moves! Search him!

220
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,276
Impressive...

221
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,931
Wait! They aren't pursuing us.

222
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,567
You're pathetic!

223
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,269
Whoa!

224
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,911
Get off of me!

225
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,947
Prefer the top, do you?

226
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,648
Ah! Ah...

227
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,492
Shut up!

228
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,656
No! Wait!

229
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,435
If you were of no use to me,
I'd cut you down here and now, Mage.

230
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,208
But I forget my manners.

231
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,709
Here I've rolled in the
bushes with a pretty

232
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,209
young lady and I haven't
introduced myself.

233
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,716
I am Regalyan d'Marcall.

234
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,788
My friends call me Galyan.

235
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,136
Well, "friend"...

236
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:17,063
If you value your life, you will take me
to the Blood Mage that murdered Byron.

237
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:26,151
That is all we
know at this time, Most Holy.

238
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,648
This is unbelievable...

239
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,062
A traitor amongst the Seekers?

240
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,656
We are currently reviewing
all the facts, Your Reverence.

241
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,257
It's unthinkable!

242
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:45,258
The Seekers are the most pure among us, yet
two of your own have betrayed the Chantry.

243
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,999
A Seeker would never go
against the Chantry.

244
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,709
I assure you that their
actions can be explained.

245
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:58,242
I have a company
of knights standing at the ready.

246
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:01,690
Permission to pursue the
traitors at once, Your Eminence.

247
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:07,886
Perhaps the Seekers would be hesitant
to hunt down one of their own.

248
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:16,060
Dispatch yourTemplars immediately.

249
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,797
These renegades must be brought tojustice.

250
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:35,412
There.

251
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,715
Is this the Blood Mage hideout?

252
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,219
A Circle safe house.

253
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,656
A trap?!

254
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,763
Will you quit waving that thing around?

255
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,764
My intelligence-gathering
associates meet here.

256
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:56,467
If anyone can find where
the Blood Mages are, they can.

257
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,569
More Mages just mean more trouble!

258
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,571
You expect me to trust you?!

259
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,178
Well, Byron trusted me!

260
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,078
Byron and I were friends.

261
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,492
I was the one who told him where the
Blood Mage ceremony would be held.

262
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,621
The First Enchanter sent me to investigate
suspicious Blood Mage activities.

263
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:21,859
It's thanks to the intelligence we gathered
that Byron was able to rescue Avexis.

264
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,434
However, the plan fell apart when the High
Seeker did not return her to the Circle.

265
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,769
I'm not sure the reason behind it,

266
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,540
but that was when Byron started to
question the High Seeker's true intentions.

267
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:40,611
So Byron brought Avexis into the
forest tonight to give her to you...

268
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:43,112
Yes.
She is a uniquely gifted girl.

269
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,612
That's why I think the
Blood Mages abducted her.

270
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,352
Byron and I planned on
hiding her here to keep her safe

271
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,488
until we could get to the
bottom of the conspiracy.

272
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,358
What?

273
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:56,635
The horses are uneasy.

274
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,237
By the Maker...

275
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,671
You knew these men?

276
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,515
Loki...

277
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,027
Haydn

278
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:06,463
What happened? Who did this?!

279
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,899
Blood Mages...

280
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,900
They caught us just as we
returned from Lazarro's...

281
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,576
Haydn

282
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,882
Be at peace, my friend...

283
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,123
Who's Lazarro?

284
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:34,057
An information trader from a
village just outside of Montfort.

285
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,727
He's the one who told me
about the dragon ceremony.

286
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,264
Take me to him.

287
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,177
We'll find out everything he knows!

288
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,482
The Blood Mages may already
be waiting for us, you know.

289
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,351
They've been one step ahead of us this far.

290
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:57,983
Hyah!

291
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,522
Be ready.

292
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,425
You work close
to the edge of Chantry law,

293
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,928
but still claim you are
loyal to the Circle?

294
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,765
Contrary to common belief, not all
Mages wish to see the Chantry deposed.

295
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:19,136
Those of us within the Circle seek only to
be treated with equal dignity and respect.

296
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:23,440
I do my part to help ensure our efforts
are not undermined by the actions of a few.

297
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,511
So you formed a network
to keep tabs on rogue Mages?

298
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,047
Apostates like those in
this blood cult we're dealing with

299
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,049
might claim to act in the cause of freedom,

300
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,452
but more often their only aim
is seizing power for themselves.

301
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,989
I'd think it would benefit
the Circle to have Mages in power.

302
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,494
Not like these.
That wouldn't be good for anyone.

303
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,235
Search teams one and two have reported in.

304
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:56,378
There's been no sign of Cassandra
or the Mage in the lgrecia Forest, sir.

305
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,482
Has there been any word from Galyan?

306
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,684
I'm afraid not, First Enchanter.

307
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,521
We must find him
before the Seekers orTemplars do...

308
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,924
Understood. I will take
charge of the search myself.

309
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,193
I leave it to you, then.

310
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,004
I only pray we are not too late.

311
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,246
You can't see it from here, but Lazarro's
house is halfway up this cliff.

312
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:40,183
He's an elf recluse.
Half-mad, but he hears things.

313
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,086
No one knows how.

314
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,288
He's also quite paranoid.

315
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,791
How can we get in?

316
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,966
Well, you could always try
asking to send down a ladder.

317
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,821
Lazarro!

318
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,426
It's me, Ga lya n!

319
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,266
Lazarro! Are you there?

320
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,949
Laza rro, ca I m down!

321
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,623
Wejust need some information!

322
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:58,695
If you cooperate and tell us what you know,
I'll let you keep your filthy head!

323
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,698
I know nothing! I'm not involved!

324
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,134
Cassandra! Please...

325
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,271
the girl?

326
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,440
What? What girl?

327
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,878
Perhaps you can't hear well.
Let me clear your ears for you.

328
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,515
Frenic! Frenic has her!

329
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:19,649
Who's Frenic?

330
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,553
The leader of the Blood Mages.
He needs her... Needs her power!

331
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,659
For what? What is he planning to do?!

332
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,528
Attack... T-Ten Year...

333
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,331
Frenic is going to attack
the Ten Year Gathering?

334
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,733
Who is his accomplice in the Chantry?

335
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,001
Someone high up...!

336
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:39,536
What's their name?

337
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:42,372
I don't know!
...Who is it?! Talk!

338
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,209
I am only going
to ask you one more time.

339
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,013
Give me the name. Now!

340
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:51,584
No, you don't!

341
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,652
This is a vial of Nesium Suspension.

342
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,690
It emits a bright flash when shattered.

343
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,826
So you think you can escape
using mere parlor tricks?!

344
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,661
They'll kill me!

345
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,530
"They"? You mean the Blood Mages?

346
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,065
I was to alert them if you showed up!

347
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,935
Sorry, we can't let you do that.

348
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,703
It's too late.

349
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:23,013
What is that?

350
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,221
I'm not sure I want to know...

351
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,411
Hya!

352
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:31,948
You all right?

353
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,516
Of course I am.

354
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:54,046
Oh, sod!

355
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,346
The eyes...
Their minds are being controlled.

356
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,344
There's too many!

357
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,513
Yah!

358
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,525
Not good...

359
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:18,388
Thanks, Lazarro.

360
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:22,804
Now... let's just hope this is
actually more than a parlor trick!

361
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,552
I should be able to handle this pain!

362
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:52,322
We need to get to a safe place
where I can treat your wound.

363
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:54,428
I don't need your magic...!

364
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,329
Are you all right?

365
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:02,739
Sorry...

366
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,674
It's hard for me to admit
I'm in your debt, Mage.

367
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,952
My name isn't "Mage." It's Galyan.

368
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,015
There they are!

369
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,471
Why are You here?!

370
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,594
<i>Hm.</i>

371
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,166
After them! Arrest those traitors!

372
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,377
Whoa!

373
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,647
Get up! Don't let them escape!

374
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,528
Oh, my.

375
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,902
There's nowhere to run!

376
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:18,708
Now surrender. Nice and easy.

377
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:22,045
It seems we're out of options here...

378
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,080
Not entirely...

379
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,149
We can make it.

380
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,821
Don't be a fool.
You'll never survive the jump.

381
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,557
That's for the Maker to decide.

382
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,435
Not a Templar!

383
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,599
Get ready.

384
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,602
Don't I get a say in this?

385
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,981
Lfl hadn't been here,
you would have been fish food.

386
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:43,895
Preparations for the Ten Year Gathering
are proceeding without delay.

387
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,999
You have done
a superb job, as always.

388
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I shudder to think what I would do
without your selfless service.

389
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,240
You need never worry about that.

390
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,576
Since the day I entered
the Chantry as a girl,

391
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,751
I have wished only to be
the Right Hand of the Divine.

392
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:09,982
And that you are.
More than I could ever ask.

393
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:14,531
It will be a great day
for the Chantry, the Maker willing.

394
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:23,662
No matter what happens,
we must continue with the ceremony.

395
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,879
The Knight Commander has assured me
the Templars can handle Chantry security.

396
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,278
Come on. Just a little farther.

397
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,350
We can rest here for a while.

398
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,854
Now then... Let there be light.

399
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,706
Cassandra, please...
let me treat your wound.

400
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,513
Ah, that is a nasty scrape.

401
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:12,016
Fortunately...

402
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,362
I happen to have just the thing for it.

403
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:19,391
Now this will hurt a bit.

404
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,601
Sorry.

405
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:31,108
My battle magic is mediocre,
but I am excellent at healing spells.

406
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,432
You should be able to
move it normally in a day or so.

407
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:57,293
My elder brother knew all
about healing herbs.

408
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:00,029
Ah. Was he a Mage?

409
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:04,807
It's merely a jest.

410
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,616
He was murdered by Mages.

411
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:17,242
Blood Mages... When I was a child,

412
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,950
my brother was cut down
right in front of me...

413
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:25,421
They needed fresh dragon
blood for their rituals...

414
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:30,422
So they came looking for the legendary
dragon-hunting families of Nevarra,

415
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,565
to capture a dragon for them.

416
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,671
My brother was the best in our family.

417
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,640
His skills and honor were unmatched.

418
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:49,078
He wouldn't sacrifice a
dragon for their corrupted magic.

419
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:53,149
The Blood Mages killed
all those who refused them.

420
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,136
Uncle!!

421
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:16,472
Anthony...!

422
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:39,825
My brother was strong... kind...
and I loved him dearly...

423
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,733
I've hated Mages ever since...

424
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,737
Blood or Circle Mages...
They all seemed the same to me.

425
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:51,743
No different from the Mage
who murdered my brother...

426
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,383
I'm so sorry, Cassandra.

427
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:06,685
It is true that both Circle
and Blood Mages are Mages...

428
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,424
Our methods may differ,

429
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,429
but there is no denying
we practice a common art...

430
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:16,866
And as a Mage, I would
like to express my sorrow.

431
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:21,043
What happened to your brother
was truly something horrendous.

432
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,563
Move in.

433
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,640
They're gone!

434
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,178
They couldn't have gotten far.

435
00:48:35,012 --> 00:48:36,279
Find them!

436
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,021
Sir!

437
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,597
Cassandra and the Mage
have disappeared, Frenic...

438
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:58,444
They must be eliminated
before the Ten Year Gathering" Oh!

439
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,048
You were saying, Commander?

440
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,020
What have we here?

441
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,728
This is an Elven Stone. He was
sending a message to someone.

442
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,659
"Understood, Knight Commander.
I will commence the search

443
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,802
for Cassandra and Galyan's
whereabouts immediately. Frenic."

444
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:37,673
So, then... you are in league with Frenic.

445
00:49:37,674 --> 00:49:40,509
That's how you
found us so quickly!

446
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,980
You'll pay for your
betrayal of the Chantry!

447
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,766
The wound still hurts,
doesn't it, Cassandra?

448
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,834
You both know too much...

449
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:22,451
Filthy traitor...

450
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,122
Byron is dead because of you...

451
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,449
No! This is not finished!

452
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,219
Cassandra, protecting the Circle
and Chantry is more important than revenge.

453
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,155
I owe it to Byron!

454
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:02,160
We must show this
stone to the Chantry at once!

455
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,162
Cassandra!

456
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,029
The conversion is complete...

457
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:43,962
Behold! The terror we
shall soon unleash upon the Chantry!

458
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:48,537
Now Avexis... Make them fly!

459
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:05,150
Let our cries for vengeance
be carried forth on wings of fire...

460
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,892
Good...

461
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,305
Good...

462
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:27,539
[Iswishing, thwacking noises]

463
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:34,049
Go now. Safe journey, my friend.

464
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,193
This is it!

465
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:47,029
[Icreaking, groaning noise]

466
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:48,597
Give me a hand.

467
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,065
[Icreaking, groaning noise]

468
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,615
The High Seeker's Office is through here.

469
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,849
And you're sure that the
front door is out of the question?

470
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,727
Just come on.

471
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:19,528
Suddenly I get the
sense that sneaking in like this

472
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,770
isn't going to help our case...

473
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,326
I rather liked that cabinet.

474
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,289
High Seeker?

475
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,492
I've been waiting for
your report, Cassandra...

476
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,295
I feared you were captured.

477
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:56,498
Feared? lthought
you were hunting me.

478
00:53:56,499 --> 00:54:01,337
I assumed you had your reasons
and that you would report in eventually.

479
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,638
So...?

480
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:04,516
<i>Where do I start...?</i>

481
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,326
Hm...

482
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:19,755
While the Knight Commander
and I have had our differences,

483
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:23,859
I can't believe that he would go
so far as to subvert the Chantry.

484
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,428
Then perhaps you should look at this.

485
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,807
It's evidence of our claims.

486
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,036
Interesting...

487
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,605
I must show this to the Divine at once.

488
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,374
So you believe me?

489
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:42,311
You've risked your life and
honor in pursuit of the truth.

490
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,847
How could I doubt?

491
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:49,695
You have the heart of a true Seeker,
Cassandra... As did Byron.

492
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,061
Thank you, Sir...

493
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,626
Wait here until my return.

494
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,396
But there is still so much to be done...

495
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:04,533
Leave this to me...
and get some rest, Cassandra.

496
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,639
Yes, High Seeker.

497
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,536
High Seeker!

498
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,434
You...!

499
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,271
Isn't this yours? You left it in the cave.

500
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,548
Allow me to return it.

501
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,412
Seekers!

502
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:53,916
High Seeker...!

503
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,453
My liege!

504
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,556
The fugitives murdered
the High Seeker. Arrest them!

505
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,890
No!
...Hold her!

506
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,201
Silence, traitor!
...He's lying!

507
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,029
It was him!

508
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,374
He's the murderer!

509
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:13,041
He's the murderer!

510
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:51,106
Confess before the Maker
and be absolved of your sins.

511
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:54,009
I just murdered the High Seeker

512
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:57,613
and framed Cassandra
and the fugitive Mage.

513
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,249
They have been branded as traitors.

514
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:04,926
And soon, they will be
executed for their crimes.

515
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,822
Frenic and the girl are ready.

516
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:42,391
A new era is upon us.

517
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:46,738
The day where you may be
called "Divine" is imminent.

518
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,801
And once the plan comes to fruition,

519
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,905
I will personally ensure
that Frenic's mouth is sealed.

520
00:57:56,906 --> 00:58:00,008
Pitiful Blood Mage...

521
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:03,650
I am looking forward
to the Ten Year Gathering.

522
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:20,362
I don't understand it.
He was such a great man.

523
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,173
Why would Cassandra do this?

524
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,403
One can never fathom the
purpose of evil, Your Grace...

525
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:32,216
But rest assured, they will
get theirjust reward.

526
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,915
All of Orlais shares your pain, Most Holy,

527
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:43,955
but in your own words, we must
proceed with the Ten Year Gathering.

528
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,289
The Grand Clerics have assembled,

529
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:50,559
and the congregation has
gathered in the courtyard.

530
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,097
They eagerly await your blessing.

531
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:02,200
I fear that great evil has
gathered amongst the good today...

532
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:05,448
Pray that the Maker can
bring us all together.

533
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:30,328
Byron and the High Seeker believed
in me... and now they're dead.

534
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,638
I should've let you finish the Knight
Commander when we had the chance.

535
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,981
Well, well, well...

536
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:57,929
After all your efforts,
in the end, it came to this...

537
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:05,934
You've landed your heads on the
chopping block, and we still have Avexis.

538
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,769
What are you doing with her?

539
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,973
You mean you don't know?

540
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,709
The whole point of Frenic's
blood ritual was to give him

541
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,012
complete control of
the girl and her abilities.

542
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,391
Control her for what purpose?

543
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:24,786
Frenic will use her powers to
summon dragons to the Chantry...

544
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,656
They should be en route any moment.

545
01:00:27,657 --> 01:00:30,459
Is that even possible...?

546
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,894
You're going after the Divine?!

547
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:37,895
Yes, then a new era will unfold!
A new era where we rule...

548
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,404
Even if you succeed in
murdering the Divine,

549
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:45,147
the Seekers will never let you seize power!

550
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,689
Oh, really?

551
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:53,760
You're right, they wouldn't...
Not him, at least.

552
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:56,318
But a Cleric...?

553
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,665
There's a reason they've chosen dragons
to carry out their assassination plot.

554
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,927
The Divine and all the candidates
next in line to succeed her

555
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:10,035
are attending the Ten Year Gathering,
and they will all be wiped out.

556
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:17,072
This will be done publicly as
if it were a natural disaster,

557
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:21,009
and whoever is left standing
will be the next Divine.

558
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,083
But who is it? Who's the
traitor amongst the clerics?!

559
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:31,420
I have no time to participate in
wild speculations with the likes of you.

560
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:34,300
Who is the traitor...?! Who?!

561
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:38,627
My orders are to execute you
before the start of the Gathering.

562
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:43,805
You'll have to continue this conversation
with Byron and the High Seeker.

563
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:49,975
Who?! Who is the traitor?!

564
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:54,309
Templars! Prepare for the execution!

565
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,246
Tell me! Come back here!

566
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:16,465
Yes, take it all in, Avexis...

567
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:21,103
We are witness to the final
moments of a dying age...

568
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,805
And you shall bring about its demise.

569
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,556
Oh, Maker above!

570
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:16,558
Shine down your light and save me!

571
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,129
Silence, prisoner.

572
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:25,201
Wait!

573
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:36,486
I'll dispatch this fallen Seeker myself.

574
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,097
Hmph. Your bravery is commendable...

575
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,366
Ahhhh!

576
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,013
Galyan!

577
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,516
Are you all right?

578
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:17,085
Galyan.. We got your message...

579
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,088
Sorry we had to cut things so close!

580
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:23,725
I sent a message with a
bird to the Circle of Magi...

581
01:04:23,726 --> 01:04:25,861
Thank the Maker it arrived...

582
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:40,709
After you were captured, we trailed

583
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,280
the Knight Commander and learned
some very interesting information...

584
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:49,284
He has been conspiring
with the Grand Cleric of Orlais.

585
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,152
The Grand Cleric?!

586
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:55,329
Yes.They have been
meeting secretly for months.

587
01:05:22,118 --> 01:05:23,688
Hyaargh!

588
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,798
Cassandra!

589
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:33,862
I know about the Grand Cleric.

590
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,798
You have both turned
your backs on the Chantry!

591
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:41,636
Ha! On the contrary, we are
ushering in a new era for the Chantry...

592
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:45,140
One where events like
Kirkwall will not be tolerated!

593
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,376
We won't allow your plan to succeed!

594
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,748
"Hate can only breed more hate."

595
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:30,094
Those were Byron's last words to me.

596
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,055
Cassandra...

597
01:06:34,056 --> 01:06:37,594
Tie him up. He will answer for his crimes.

598
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,204
You heard her. Up!

599
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,552
In the end, it came to this...

600
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,300
It's the start of the Gathering.

601
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:23,534
Citizens of Orlais,
honored faithful from lands beyond,

602
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:28,906
today we gather to honor the
Maker and his greatest gift to us...

603
01:07:29,478 --> 01:07:34,478
his wife of the spirit,
Andraste, our beloved prophet

604
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:39,220
who gave her life so that
the Chantry might <i>live...</i>

605
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:44,221
This day, each decade,
marks the beginning of a new life.

606
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:49,097
A day when the Maker's
benediction brings greatjoy and...

607
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:27,775
Go on! Good! Crush them all!

608
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:43,320
[Iscreaming, frantic cries of the clerics]

609
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:49,827
Maker's wrath! He sends
dragons to punish our sins!

610
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:04,139
Protect the Divine!

611
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,710
Come on!

612
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:15,483
Most Holy...

613
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,486
<i>No... She's cut off...</i>

614
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,566
We're too <i>late...</i>

615
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,902
Frenic and Avexis should be close by!

616
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,543
I'll find them!

617
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:26,122
[Ipained, gradually weakening roars]

618
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,204
Dragon Hunter...

619
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:19,879
Call the High Dragon!

620
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:02,684
Finish her! Yes! Yes!! Hahahaha!

621
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:05,666
She's done enough of your bidding, Frenic.

622
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,226
You'll never harm this girl again!

623
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,537
It's over. All of it.

624
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,058
<i>No... No!!</i>

625
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,080
Are you all right, your grace?

626
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,744
Your Holiness!

627
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,814
Most Holy!

628
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,249
Quickly. Help her down.

629
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,618
Your Holiness!
...Right, we've got her.

630
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,487
Thank you, Cassandra...
Come, Your Holiness.

631
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,331
The Maker be with you!

632
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,827
Heh, heh, heh...

633
01:13:52,828 --> 01:13:57,828
Fool... Do you really
think I will surrender so easily?

634
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,054
Hyargh!

635
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,994
Together, men!

636
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,868
<i>Frenic...</i>

637
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,141
There is no one coming to help you.

638
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,315
The Knight Commander is dead.

639
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:53,228
Do you hear? Your plan failed, Mage.

640
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:20,715
You are no longer of any use to me!

641
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:22,517
This was never about her.

642
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,586
I merely exploited her ambition
as a means to free us

643
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:32,732
from the oppressive binds of the Chantry,
and create a new world controlled by Mages!

644
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:39,567
As a fellow Mage, you should understand.

645
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,912
You and I are not the same.

646
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:47,376
Then I will destroy you all,
along with the Chantry!

647
01:15:50,445 --> 01:15:52,118
Hwa!

648
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,959
<i>Eh... heh heh heh...</i>

649
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,461
Yaaa!

650
01:16:07,462 --> 01:16:11,832
[Iripping, crunching sounds]

651
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:36,030
Now, men! Everything you've got!

652
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:11,154
Avexis! Wake up! Avexis! Please!

653
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,160
We need you, Avexis! Wake up!

654
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:27,081
Aaaaaghg

655
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,931
Thank you, Avexis...

656
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:16,229
Come on!

657
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:12,853
The righteous stand before the darkness
and the Maker shall guide their hands.

658
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,663
Cassandra...!

659
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,639
For the Chantry!

660
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:06,801
For the Chantry!

661
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,703
For the Chantry!

662
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:11,972
Yeeeahyg

663
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:46,040
What do you think...?
Not bad, huh?

664
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,012
Cassandra...

665
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:56,584
You are the bravest person I have
ever met, and the most beautiful...

666
01:20:56,585 --> 01:20:59,429
This isn't the time or the place!

667
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,461
You fool.

668
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:17,467
Galyan, you've helped me win
back more than just my honor.

669
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,811
Suddenly, the world is
different for me now.

670
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:28,751
Thank you, for everything.

671
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:07,450
For risking her life to protect the
Chantry against the darkest of evil,

672
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:14,491
I hereby proclaim Cassandra
Pentaghast the Hero of Orlais.

673
01:22:17,632 --> 01:22:21,802
And the Chantry also
wishes to express its appreciation...

674
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:26,803
of the heroic Mage that fought
beside her, Regalyan d'Marcall.

675
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:47,027
And for upholding the highest
standards of the Order of Seekers

676
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:52,028
and demonstrating
unwavering faith to the Chantry,

677
01:22:52,167 --> 01:22:57,167
Cassandra Pentaghast shall from this day
forward be the Right Hand of the Divine.

678
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,366
Come forth, child.

679
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,221
Your Holiness...

680
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,490
Cassandra...

681
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:20,554
You seem troubled.

682
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:24,625
This attack... It is only the beginning.

683
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:29,939
There is a storm coming, child.
We must be prepared.

684
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,107
How may I serve?

685
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:54,591
J' closing music J'
