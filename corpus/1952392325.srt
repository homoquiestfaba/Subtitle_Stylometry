1
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,648
Hello.

2
00:00:19,132 --> 00:00:23,026
This is Lou Vanetti,
reporting live
from KBRX.

3
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,986
I don't know if--
[buzz]

4
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,807
[with echo]
anyone out there
can hear me or not.

5
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:32,786
[buzz]

6
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:36,498
[deep inhale]

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,181
Only hours remain before
the earth's magnetic field
declines to zero.

8
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:46,735
[buzz]
And as most
of you know by now,

9
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:49,294
once that occurs,
[buzzing]

10
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:52,878
solar radiation
will destroy
the atmosphere.

11
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,429
And--God be
with us all.

12
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,965
[silence and a
bird cries out]

13
00:01:13,362 --> 00:01:15,085
[tires screech]

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,229
[eerie roar grows]

15
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,515
Turn the car off!

16
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:31,591
[loud hissing]

17
00:01:31,663 --> 00:01:33,768
[buzzing and
small explosions]

18
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,736
[silence]

19
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,528
I think it's gone.

20
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:48,971
Start the car.

21
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,662
[Cynthia]
Damn it!

22
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,467
We'll have
to go back.

23
00:02:57,921 --> 00:02:59,066
[loud vibrating]

24
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,281
[growing roar]

25
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:03,928
Get out of
the car now!

26
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:28,468
(Shane)
Come on!
Jump!

27
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:31,443
[scream]

28
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,824
No!

29
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,122
(Lou, over TV)
Flights across the globe

30
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:00,565
have been grounded
for 24 hours

31
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,604
as the
comet Copernicus
passes Earth.

32
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:05,133
This will be the largest
celestial object in
recorded history

33
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:09,067
to pass this close and
is expected to create a
global magnetic disturbance.

34
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:12,555
When the comet was
first discovered
six months ago--

35
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,838
Good morning.

36
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:15,314
Hi, Miss Penny.

37
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,892
Hi, Cyn. Zoe,
that's Cynthia's
order in the fridge.

38
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:20,872
So I'm
taking the
Science Club

39
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,473
on a field trip
to watch the comet.

40
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:24,913
I heard.
That's very
brave of you.

41
00:04:26,289 --> 00:04:28,013
You're coming
along too,
right, Zoe?

42
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,536
Yeah. Dad is
letting me off
early so I can come.

43
00:04:30,609 --> 00:04:31,722
Right, Dad?

44
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,702
I suppose.

45
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:36,231
(Lou on TV)
...discuss what unforeseen
dangers we may be facing,

46
00:04:36,304 --> 00:04:40,133
we are joined now
via satellite by our
own Dr. James Mayfield.

47
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,451
Hey, look
who's on TV!

48
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,210
Doctor, could
you explain

49
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,799
why you believe it's
possible that the comet
could hit us

50
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:49,929
when almost everyone else
has predicted it will
simply pass us by.

51
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,892
Wait a minute, Lou,
all I said was that
you can't rule it out.

52
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,655
Having just
passed the sun,

53
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:57,383
gases in the
comet's icy core

54
00:04:57,452 --> 00:04:59,143
will be
heating up
like a hotspring.

55
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:03,041
This will affect
the comet speed and
trajectory in ways--

56
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:05,155
that we just
can't predict.

57
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:08,041
Fascinating. Now l
understand the Storm
Hazards Dept.

58
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:10,975
has sent you to northern
Alaska to observe the
comet swing by.

59
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,278
That's right. We'll be
just inside the
Arctic Circle

60
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:16,516
where the comet
is expected to
pass over.

61
00:05:16,586 --> 00:05:19,585
Its orbital fulcrum,
meaning the closest
it will be to Earth,

62
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:23,966
it's a very exciting
opportunity for us
to observe

63
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,236
geomagnetic anomalies
in the Earth's
magnetic field.

64
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,896
Thank you, Doctor.

65
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:31,007
That was local
astrophysicist Dr.
James Mayfield

66
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,420
via satellite
from Alaska.

67
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:37,275
[sizzling and roaring]

68
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:45,347
[birds chirping]

69
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,448
Getting a signal?

70
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,941
Yep. Logging
into the satellite.

71
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:12,471
Ah, my last
two Cubans.

72
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:14,747
I've been
saving them for
a special occasion.

73
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:17,270
That's against
the law, you know.

74
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,190
Yeah. Well.
Relax, Peter
we're in Alaska.

75
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,101
Well, the U.S. Trade
Embargo says that no
American citizen

76
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,948
can smoke a Cuban
cigar anywhere in
the world.

77
00:06:26,013 --> 00:06:27,638
And we're in!

78
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:29,270
Showtime.

79
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,609
You can get
ten years.

80
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:33,498
That's a
good point.

81
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:35,287
I better smoke
both of them.

82
00:06:35,356 --> 00:06:37,744
[phone beeping]

83
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,576
Hey, Pam. Satellite
link is up.

84
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:41,978
You should
be getting
REM readings.

85
00:06:45,818 --> 00:06:47,606
Copy, James.

86
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:48,754
We're getting
it now.

87
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,563
(male voice)
Across the globe,

88
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:58,323
eyes look
skyward tonight.

89
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:00,813
Millions of teachers
and students in
every nation

90
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:03,953
get the chance to
glimpse something great
astronomers of the past

91
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:04,950
could only
have dreamed of.

92
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:10,451
Okay, everyone.
I'd like to show
you something.

93
00:07:10,518 --> 00:07:15,405
Just as our planet
has a magnetic field,
so does the comet.

94
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,444
This comet's gonna pass
Pluto by the time this
guy finishes.

95
00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:23,404
Zoe, could
you come up
here, please?

96
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:30,545
Hold this up
for me, please.

97
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:34,156
We're going to imagine
that this compass
is Earth.

98
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:37,902
As the comet passes,
the magnetic fields interact,

99
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:41,067
creating intense bursts
of electromagnetic waves,

100
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:43,624
which can
interfere with modern
technology so ladies,

101
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,991
no sulking if your
boyfriend don't return
your text messages tonight.

102
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:48,484
[light chuckling]

103
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:51,242
Yo, it's a freaking
comet, not your
mother undressing.

104
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,099
Hey, move it.

105
00:07:53,167 --> 00:07:54,344
Leave him alone!

106
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:57,228
Hey! Hey!!

107
00:07:57,294 --> 00:07:59,049
Hey!

108
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,066
Hey, stop it!

109
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,215
[glass breaks]

110
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,221
Stop it.
Stop.

111
00:08:05,293 --> 00:08:07,234
Stop it.

112
00:08:11,499 --> 00:08:14,401
You'll both be reimbursing
the school for the cost of
a new telescope.

113
00:08:14,475 --> 00:08:16,035
What? This
guy started it,
Miss Penny!

114
00:08:16,107 --> 00:08:17,961
No, I didn't! He
was picking
on him!

115
00:08:18,026 --> 00:08:22,019
It's Mrs. Mayfield now,
and I particularly
care who started it,

116
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,846
you're both paying
for a new telescope.

117
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:30,080
I'll be contacting
your parents about
the exact cost.

118
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,429
Bad enough
you married
my father,

119
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:33,186
now I can't
even get fair
treatment in class?

120
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:35,939
Go wait by the
washroom, Shane.

121
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:40,639
The data is looking
a bit fragmented.

122
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:43,165
Electromagnetic interference
is coming on strong.

123
00:08:45,094 --> 00:08:48,955
Yeah, our friend
Copernicus seems
unusually magnetic.

124
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,752
Where's my lighter?

125
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,276
Viewers are probably
experiencing increased
interference

126
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:55,290
as Copernicus reaches
what is expected
to be

127
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:56,957
its closest
proximity to Earth.

128
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:59,548
Comet is at
orbital fulcrum.

129
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,994
(Pam)
It should be passing
over your area

130
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:02,750
in just a
few minutes.

131
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:04,193
(male reporter)
We've just
gotten word

132
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:06,298
that the comet
has reached--
[static]

133
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,152
Already there are
five press reports
of mass--

134
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:10,941
(Miss Penny)
This is extraordinary.

135
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,100
We'll continue to
broadcast throughout
this historic event,

136
00:09:15,169 --> 00:09:18,551
[heavy static]
but it is possible that
we may experience--

137
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,079
may lose our signal,
and we apologize
for that.

138
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,966
--obviously beyond
our control.

139
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:27,642
Hey. An electromagnetic
storm from the comet

140
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:30,744
is affecting
our electricity.

141
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,736
Whoa, whoa! Just
had a surge in the
electron acceleration.

142
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:42,390
The fields EM levels
are skyrocketing.

143
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,519
Radiation beIt's
being pushed into
the atmosphere.

144
00:09:46,588 --> 00:09:48,114
Pam, are you
reading this?

145
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:52,180
Yes. I'm measuring a
radiation spike in
the belt safe-zone.

146
00:09:52,251 --> 00:09:54,901
4.5 million angstroms
and rising.

147
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,530
Hey, look
at this.

148
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:01,335
Wait, that's odd.

149
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:02,743
I'm getting
a second set

150
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,335
of separate
readings from
the comet.

151
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:07,223
Magnify sector LP4.

152
00:10:08,248 --> 00:10:10,135
[beep]

153
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,132
I see something
in the tail.

154
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:18,261
Copernicus is fragmenting!

155
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,968
We've got a piece
of the comet
breaking away.

156
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:28,525
We can't
see anything.

157
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:29,938
Can you read
the fragment's specs?

158
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,546
Projectile
diameter is
300 meters.

159
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,833
Velocity at
30 kilometers
a second.

160
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:40,360
What's the trajectory?

161
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:43,750
Descending at--

162
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,233
45 degrees.

163
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:49,706
It's gonna
hit Earth.

164
00:10:54,128 --> 00:10:55,753
Use the belt
electron trajectory

165
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,449
to triangulate a
point of impact.

166
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,821
Working on it!

167
00:11:03,695 --> 00:11:06,345
Latitude 51 degrees
and longitude 179.

168
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:09,959
James, that's only
1 00 miles from
where you are.

169
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,458
[breaks up]

170
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:15,144
James? Did you
hear what I said?

171
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:16,806
Get out of there!

172
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,080
Notify I EW to
issue an alert.

173
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:23,654
Repeat, notify
IEW to issue
an alert.

174
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:25,316
Pam, you copy?

175
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,719
Damn it!

176
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,696
Where's their
projective point
of impact?

177
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,191
I don't know.
I lost her.

178
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,956
Maybe l
can amplify
the signal.

179
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:58,366
Shockwave! Get
back in the car!

180
00:11:58,437 --> 00:11:59,866
Let's get
out of here!

181
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:16,064
What's the point?
We're dead!

182
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,018
We can't outrun
a blast!

183
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:20,089
Avalanche bunker
at the bottom
of the hill!

184
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:21,438
Right!

185
00:12:21,505 --> 00:12:23,447
Step on it, man!

186
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:27,512
[roar]

187
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:29,210
[distant explosion]

188
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:33,151
[deafening roaring]

189
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,275
Try uploading
the data in case
we don't make it.

190
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:04,244
James.

191
00:13:04,314 --> 00:13:06,518
[deafening roaring]

192
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,027
Peter! Get
out of there!
Come on!

193
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,058
[shout]

194
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:37,011
(Lou Vanetti)
Reports of massive
damage and casualties

195
00:13:37,076 --> 00:13:38,320
have been coming
in from Alaska,

196
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,210
northern Canada,
and eastern Russia.

197
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:43,210
Communication is
still down throughout
these affected areas.

198
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:45,138
As the death toll rises,

199
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:46,796
we're getting estimates
that as many as a quarter
of a million people

200
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,136
may have
perished in this
history-making disaster.

201
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:51,755
One piece of
good news
to report,

202
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,800
local resident
Dr. James Mayfield

203
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,532
has miraculously
survived the blast

204
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,641
despite being within
a few hundred miles
of ground zero

205
00:13:57,713 --> 00:14:00,134
where the comet struck.

206
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:02,413
He is expected to
be arriving home today.

207
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:11,113
James!

208
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,298
I thought
I'd lost you.

209
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:22,379
It's good
to be home.

210
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,930
(Lou over TV)
Mayfield is one voice
raising caution...

211
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:31,424
Hey, buddy.

212
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,928
Hey, Dad!

213
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,010
[happy chuckles]

214
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,359
You okay?

215
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:38,947
Yeah.
Welcome home.

216
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:40,708
Thanks.

217
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:41,955
Who wants coffee?

218
00:14:42,026 --> 00:14:43,586
I would love one.

219
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,860
Well, I'm sure you guys
has lots of science stuff
to talk about so,

220
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:54,084
Whoa, Shane.
Where are
you going?

221
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:56,323
I just got home,
sit down with us.

222
00:14:56,391 --> 00:15:00,733
Yeah, I'm kinda tired.
I feel like
laying down.

223
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:07,070
He got into a
fight and broke
a telescope.

224
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:10,240
I'm making him
and the other kid
pay for it. Sorry.

225
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,781
No, don't be sorry.
I don't envy either
one of you.

226
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:16,761
I wouldn't want
a stepmother
for a teacher

227
00:15:16,836 --> 00:15:18,396
or a stepson
for a student.

228
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:21,533
Now that you're home,
you're gonna have to
play bad cop

229
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:23,009
and do all
the disciplining.

230
00:15:23,074 --> 00:15:25,921
Otherwise he's never
gonna let me
get close.

231
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:27,328
Deal.

232
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,104
(female voice)
... worst-case scenarios

233
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,373
that were to happen
if the comet were
to hit Earth,

234
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:36,506
I wonder,
Mr. President,
has the impact from the comet

235
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:40,351
created a lasting effect,
the public should be
concerned with.

236
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,804
We're still investigating
that possibility.

237
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,951
But right now, it
doesn't appear that
there's anything

238
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:46,517
that the
public needs
to worry about.

239
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:48,892
You gotta
be joking.

240
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,136
What?

241
00:15:50,206 --> 00:15:51,962
A 300-meter
projectile hits
the planet

242
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,339
at 30 km
per second

243
00:15:53,406 --> 00:15:54,780
and he's saying
there's nothing
to worry about?

244
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:58,423
Maybe he just
doesn't want to
scare the public.

245
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,867
[loud exhale]

246
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:02,071
Unlike some
people I know.

247
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,801
My science advisers
have reported

248
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:09,330
that the immediate
crisis is over.

249
00:16:09,403 --> 00:16:12,053
So the important thing
for the American people
to know

250
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:13,715
is that
they're safe,

251
00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:16,273
that they can
go on about
their daily lives,

252
00:16:16,346 --> 00:16:18,233
This is unbelievable.

253
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,422
James,

254
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:25,806
I know you went
through a terrible
ordeal in Alaska.

255
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,341
But you're
home now.

256
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,093
Okay? So let someone
else do the worrying
for a change.

257
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,973
Enjoy being
with your family.

258
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:37,973
You're right.

259
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,499
You're right
as usual.

260
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:40,784
Mm-hm.

261
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,125
The United States
of America
[static]

262
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:49,971
stands ready
to offer assistance all
available citizens necessary.

263
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,305
[loud piercing noise]

264
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:54,706
What is that
terrible sound?

265
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:00,552
[static, shrill sound]

266
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:04,106
[loud humming
in crescendo]

267
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,599
[loud thuds]

268
00:17:13,137 --> 00:17:13,998
An earthquake?

269
00:17:14,064 --> 00:17:15,590
Quick, take cover!

270
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,509
Shane, you okay?

271
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,777
[door opens]

272
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,756
Yeah.

273
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,374
What?

274
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,894
What?

275
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,064
(James, over phone)
What do you mean
it's been classified?

276
00:18:08,135 --> 00:18:09,411
Just what I said.

277
00:18:09,478 --> 00:18:10,940
All the data we
collected in Alaska

278
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,502
and uploaded
to Government
has been classified.

279
00:18:13,574 --> 00:18:16,355
And neither you nor
I have the clearance
to access it.

280
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:18,243
In fact, we shouldn't
even be talking about
this right now.

281
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,064
The whole dept's
under a gag order.

282
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,409
That tremor
we just had

283
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:23,418
was preceded
by some kind of
EM disturbance

284
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,467
which could mean
that there's been
serious damage

285
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,783
to the
magnetic field.

286
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,534
Yeah. I recorded
an EM spike earlier

287
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:31,010
but I didn't know
what caused it.

288
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:34,424
We need the
comet data. Who
classified it?

289
00:18:34,498 --> 00:18:36,473
The Administration.

290
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:40,701
Great. Not even a
comet hit is immune
to political spin.

291
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:42,908
Maybe there really
was some damage
to the field

292
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:46,205
and they don't want
to disclose it to
the public.

293
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,061
We need
to find out.

294
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,535
(female recorded voice)
You've reached the office

295
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,258
of the President's
Science Adviser.

296
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:53,237
Due to
extenuating circumstances,

297
00:18:53,312 --> 00:18:55,253
this office will not
be taking phone calls

298
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,334
until further notice.
[beep]

299
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:01,564
[deep sigh]

300
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,164
[buzzing]

301
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:34,322
What are you
doing up on
the roof?

302
00:19:34,392 --> 00:19:36,431
T racking the sun.

303
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:39,286
And why would you
be tracking
the sun?

304
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,772
It's not where
it's supposed
to be.

305
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,538
Why would
you say that?

306
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:46,192
Yesterday, the
sun set behind
Eagle Peak.

307
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:49,163
What do you mean?
It's never set
behind the Peak.

308
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:52,492
Exactly.

309
00:19:56,788 --> 00:20:00,846
[phone rings]

310
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:02,671
Hello?

311
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,746
(girl's voice)
Hey! Is
this Shane?

312
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:05,767
Yeah, who's this?

313
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:07,370
Hi, it's Zoe.

314
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:10,192
I was just calling to
tell Miss Penny the
pastries are ready.

315
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:11,850
Pastries?

316
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,928
We're donating
them for the school's
disaster fund drive.

317
00:20:14,001 --> 00:20:15,724
So she can
pick them up
whenever she wants.

318
00:20:15,793 --> 00:20:18,095
Okay, I'll let
her know.

319
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:19,687
Okay.
Bye.

320
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,709
Bye.

321
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,328
Hi.

322
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:25,992
Zoe just called.

323
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:28,235
The pastries for
the fund drive
are ready.

324
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:29,928
Want me to go pick
them up for you?

325
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:32,813
That would be
great, Shane.
Thank you.

326
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,024
Can I help you?

327
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,763
Oh.
Hi.

328
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:52,162
How's it going?

329
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:55,201
Good. You're here
to pick up the stuff
for your mom, right?

330
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:56,768
She's not my mom.

331
00:20:56,842 --> 00:20:59,209
Okay. Step-mom.

332
00:20:59,274 --> 00:21:01,761
Hey. You have
my sympathy.

333
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:04,320
I'd die if my dad
picked one of
my teachers.

334
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:06,978
[cell rings]

335
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:09,153
Hello?
Hey!

336
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,460
My God.

337
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:24,094
What is it?

338
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:27,776
The sun's 10 degrees
off where it should
be this time of year.

339
00:21:27,845 --> 00:21:30,463
How can that be?

340
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:40,352
Okay. In like
an hour?

341
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:43,615
You still meeting
Kevin at the
park today?

342
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:45,144
Uh, yeah.

343
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,483
Yeah, okay.

344
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:49,375
Alright, okay.
Bye.

345
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:53,590
Here it is.

346
00:21:53,664 --> 00:21:54,744
Thanks.

347
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,507
I'll be at
the park
with Kevin.

348
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:57,525
Oh, yeah?

349
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,582
Yeah.

350
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,801
I'll see
you there.

351
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:00,820
Cool.

352
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,491
[car door closes]

353
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,849
Hey, James!

354
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:18,451
Hey, Lou!

355
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:21,109
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you since
the interview.

356
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,271
So, what's
this great story
you've got for me?

357
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:26,932
You remember how
we used to come
out here

358
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:28,214
and watch all
those sunsets?

359
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:29,744
Maybe that's what
you came out
here for.

360
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,793
I was out here
for the babes
and the booze.

361
00:22:31,866 --> 00:22:35,542
Do you remember how this
sundial was always right
on the money?

362
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:37,103
Yeah, I remember.

363
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,221
[loud music from car]

364
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:02,221
[motor revs]

365
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,634
Hey, Shane.

366
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:20,429
Hey, Zoe.

367
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:21,840
So what am l?
Chopped liver?

368
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:25,994
So, Shane buddy, l
got a little problem
because of you.

369
00:23:26,065 --> 00:23:27,755
You see this car?

370
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:31,719
My dad's making me sell it
to pay for the stupid
telescope you broke.

371
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:32,740
We broke it.

372
00:23:32,816 --> 00:23:34,725
Whatever. The
point is,

373
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,708
I think we
can settle this
little problem.

374
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:38,473
How is that?

375
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,549
Drag race.
You and me.

376
00:23:40,622 --> 00:23:44,812
You win, I'll pay the
4000 we owe for
the telescope.

377
00:23:44,878 --> 00:23:47,692
I win,
you pay.

378
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:50,698
Come on, what
do you think?

379
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,837
Not afraid of getting
your ass whupped,
are ya?

380
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:55,873
You wouldn't win.

381
00:23:55,948 --> 00:23:59,046
Ouch. You
hear that?

382
00:23:59,115 --> 00:24:01,351
Greaser-boy thinks
he can beat me.

383
00:24:02,699 --> 00:24:04,422
Let's do it.

384
00:24:07,114 --> 00:24:09,416
Dr. Mayfield
says his suspicion
was first aroused

385
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,848
when he noticed
the sun setting
behind Eagle Peak.

386
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:14,979
Now, I can tell you
from my own experience
as I was growing up here,

387
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:17,285
the sun has never
set behind Eagle
Peak before.

388
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:19,043
And then there's our
trusty sundial here

389
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:24,708
which has never
been wrong.

390
00:24:24,775 --> 00:24:26,084
Until today.

391
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:30,176
[motors rev loudly]

392
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:50,269
[piercing sound
from radio]

393
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,185
Ready, guys?

394
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,055
Get set--

395
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:19,413
[shout]

396
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:29,979
Shane! Get
out, Shane!

397
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,089
Shane!

398
00:25:36,731 --> 00:25:38,073
Shane! Get out!

399
00:25:41,978 --> 00:25:43,287
Oh, my God.

400
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,036
You okay?

401
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:58,802
Are you alright?

402
00:25:58,872 --> 00:26:01,075
[heavy breathing]

403
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:03,510
What happened?
What just happened?

404
00:26:03,574 --> 00:26:06,890
Poor Kevin.
Oh, my God.

405
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,011
I can't
get reception.
What about you?

406
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:18,320
Nothing.

407
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:21,996
What is that?

408
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:24,936
[dull roar]

409
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,078
It looks like
an aurora.

410
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:30,513
Here? I thought
those things only
happened up north

411
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:31,952
in places
like Alaska.

412
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:36,943
Something bad's happening.

413
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:40,911
Dr. Mayfield,
what exactly
is the problem

414
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:43,758
with an axis
tilt changing
ten degrees?

415
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:47,751
I mean, so
what if the sun
sets 10 minutes later?

416
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:49,449
A shifted axis tilt

417
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,558
means the
Earth's axis
of rotation

418
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,997
is out of alignment
with its magnetic poles.

419
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:57,574
This could have serious
consequences for the
Earth's magnetic field.

420
00:26:57,645 --> 00:26:59,881
Seismic activity,
electromagnetic interference

421
00:26:59,949 --> 00:27:02,404
with communications
that we've
been experiencing,

422
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:05,859
This could
all be just
the beginning.

423
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:08,266
The beginning
of what?

424
00:27:08,332 --> 00:27:11,048
A catastrophic
pole reversal.

425
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,626
You mean like
what happened
a million years ago

426
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,633
when the north
and south poles
changed places?

427
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:19,200
That's right.

428
00:27:20,329 --> 00:27:21,278
Back to you.

429
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:26,464
(James)
Yeah! Yeah!
Alright already!

430
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:31,327
James, buddy,
we are famous.

431
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,643
What are you
talking about?

432
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:34,598
[guffaws]

433
00:27:34,663 --> 00:27:35,873
You don't know?

434
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:37,797
Know what?

435
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:41,217
Your story
caught fire.

436
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,969
My report got
picked up by all
the big networks.

437
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:45,564
Really?

438
00:27:45,637 --> 00:27:47,524
Yeah. There is some
weird crap going on
all over this country

439
00:27:47,589 --> 00:27:49,083
that the government
does not want to
talk about

440
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:51,327
but your theory
makes more sense
than these--

441
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:54,592
alien invasion stories
so the networks
picked it up.

442
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,271
Good. Maybe it'll force
the Administration to
come clean.

443
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:01,022
Look, any more
earth-shattering
developments--

444
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,846
I'm your man, right?

445
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:03,929
See you, Lou.

446
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,279
I'm your man, right?

447
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:06,294
See you, Lou!

448
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,614
I'm your man!

449
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,438
Good morning, gentlemen.

450
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:22,812
Good morning,
Mr. President.

451
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,886
Good morning, Mr.
President. How
are you, sir?

452
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,195
Who leaked the
axis tilt to
the press?

453
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:29,116
A Dr. James
Mayfield, sir.

454
00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:31,865
Mayfield? That's your
son, isn't it, General?

455
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:34,355
Yes, sir. Dr.
Mayfield is
my son.

456
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:35,573
Then what the
heck's he doing

457
00:28:35,644 --> 00:28:36,986
leaking
classified information?

458
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:39,190
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not aware
of his activities.

459
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,115
We haven't spoken
in nearly five years.

460
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,968
You don't say.

461
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,621
Maybe now would be
a good time for a
family reunion.

462
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,657
Because if you can't
put a muzzle on him,
we will.

463
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,185
What exactly was
his involvement
with this?

464
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:54,257
Our Storm Hazard
Research Dept.
contracted Dr. Mayfield

465
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:57,395
to monitor the
comet's effect on
the radiation belts.

466
00:28:57,465 --> 00:28:59,668
So wasn't this guy on
the same gag order
as everyone else?

467
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:01,427
Yes, sir, and
his research
was classified,

468
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:04,879
but to be honest, sir,
the data he updated

469
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,675
couldn't have
revealed an
axis tilt

470
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,231
as it was collected
prior to the
comet hit.

471
00:29:09,303 --> 00:29:11,245
Don't argue
semantics with
me, doctor.

472
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,293
A gag order
is a gag order.

473
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:16,366
I don't need 400 phone
calls coming into the
White House

474
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:19,918
every hour about a pole
reversal that's not
going to happen.

475
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:22,705
It's not going
to happen, right,
Dr. Elman?

476
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:25,227
It's a preposterous
thought, Mr. President.

477
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,471
The consensus
is that the
Earth's axis

478
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,987
will slowly fall
back in place as
it rotates.

479
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,466
Glad to hear it.

480
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:35,181
However, this sort
of doomsday hysteria,

481
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,184
is exactly why we need
to keep the public in
the dark right now.

482
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:39,600
Your son--

483
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:40,614
Sir?

484
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,638
Is he smart?

485
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:42,661
Yes, sir.

486
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:43,784
How smart is he?

487
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:44,969
Too smart for
his own good, sir.

488
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,081
That's what it
sounds like.

489
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:48,167
You better
bring him in.

490
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,582
Yes, sir.

491
00:30:00,462 --> 00:30:01,738
James.

492
00:30:01,806 --> 00:30:05,035
It's really happening.
All the telltale signs.

493
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:06,889
This is unprecedented.

494
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,135
What is?

495
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:10,823
The pole reversal.

496
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,064
Shane didn't
come home
last night.

497
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,553
Are you sure?

498
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:17,515
Yeah, his car isn't here,
his bed hasn't been
slept in

499
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:18,823
and I can't reach
him on his cell.

500
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,167
He said he was going
to the park last night.

501
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,926
Oh, my God. I just
heard on the radio

502
00:30:21,995 --> 00:30:24,744
the park was ripped
apart by a major
earthquake last night.

503
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,758
Let's go!

504
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:40,349
[sirens]

505
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:46,207
What's going on?

506
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,125
Dr. Mayfield. We
need you to come to
the air base with us, sir.

507
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:51,329
Base? For what?

508
00:30:51,398 --> 00:30:52,924
I don't know, sir.

509
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:55,615
But we have an executive
order to take you to
the base.

510
00:30:55,685 --> 00:30:57,114
By force if necessary.

511
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,663
Go. Go.

512
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:03,641
I'll find Shane.

513
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:07,031
I'll call you as soon
as I know what's
going on.

514
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:08,187
This way.

515
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:20,512
Anything?

516
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,423
Nothing. That's weird,
I always get a
signal here.

517
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,718
Hey, Dad.

518
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,612
James.

519
00:31:43,677 --> 00:31:46,065
I should've known
you were behind this.

520
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,896
Long time
no see.

521
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:49,654
Five years
is not
so long.

522
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,326
I guess it justs
seemed long
to me.

523
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:55,737
Get my
birthday card?

524
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:58,836
I did.
Thank you.
Very considerate.

525
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:01,754
How's your son? He
must be getting
awfully big by now.

526
00:32:01,818 --> 00:32:05,843
Yes, he is. You
probably wouldn't
even recognize him.

527
00:32:05,913 --> 00:32:10,004
Probably not.
Have a seat, James.

528
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:18,571
So, you caused
quite a stir
in Washington.

529
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,054
How's that, sir?

530
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:22,388
Violating a
government gag
order, for one thing.

531
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:25,618
I didn't violate any gag
order. That axis shift
was my own research.

532
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:26,995
Don't play games
with me, James.

533
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:28,970
You're either on
the team or
you're not.

534
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:30,387
Here we go.

535
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:31,914
You know full well
the intent of the
gag order.

536
00:32:31,989 --> 00:32:34,771
Everything you
worked on
was classified.

537
00:32:34,836 --> 00:32:36,778
The public
has the right to
that information.

538
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,641
It's not your call.

539
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,457
You're a science rat.
You don't make policy.

540
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:45,352
And scaring the American
public is against this
country's greater good.

541
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:48,906
You think you're
a good soldier.

542
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:52,589
You're just a lapdog
for political bosses.

543
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:54,032
You'd probably
shoot me yourself

544
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:56,846
if they told you
it would serve
the greater good.

545
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,133
What am l
doing here?

546
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:08,427
Obviously it's not
because you
missed me.

547
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:12,582
I had the President
of the United States

548
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:16,996
tell me that my son
was a national
security risk.

549
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:21,705
So what?
He wants to burn
me at the stake?

550
00:33:21,772 --> 00:33:24,903
No, lucky
for you,

551
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:26,913
he wants to
hear you out.

552
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:32,417
Oh, you
mean he wants
to cover his ass.

553
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,978
(anchorwoman)
Increased electronic
interference continues

554
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:38,695
[static]
to be reported from
around the world.

555
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:43,016
This new development,
coupled with the increase
of reported seismic activity,

556
00:33:43,081 --> 00:33:45,285
and the appearance
of what seems to
be auroras

557
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:49,508
all around the globe
have many fearing
for the worst.

558
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:54,109
Oh, my God.

559
00:33:57,894 --> 00:33:59,268
Are you guys okay?

560
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:03,134
What happened?
Where's your car?

561
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:08,066
This thin skin is
the Earth's crust.

562
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,659
Spitting liquid
in the core

563
00:34:09,732 --> 00:34:11,619
is the engine
which generates our
protective magnetic field.

564
00:34:11,684 --> 00:34:13,309
Dr. Mayfield, we
didn't bring
you here

565
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,906
for a
geology class.

566
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,767
A shift in
the axis tilt

567
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,623
causes slippage
of the crust
around the core.

568
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:21,854
Consequently, the Earth
is now out of alignment
with its magnetic field.

569
00:34:21,922 --> 00:34:25,217
And the misaligned crust
is causing increased
seismic activity.

570
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:26,907
Yes, yes, we're
aware of all that.

571
00:34:26,978 --> 00:34:30,326
We just want to hear
specific evidence
pertaining to your--

572
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,302
far-fetched notion
of a pole reversal.

573
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:34,838
I assume
you're aware
of beached whales,

574
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:38,174
birds migrating in
the wrong direction,
bees swarming.

575
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,956
Yes, creatures realigned
with the magnetic field
for navigation

576
00:34:41,023 --> 00:34:42,746
were confused, a
short-lived result

577
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:45,302
of the comet's
temporary distortion
of the magnetic field.

578
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,999
Answer me this, then,

579
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,452
why are polar auroras
suddenly appearing in
places they shouldn't?

580
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:53,208
Again, temporary
distortion of the
magnetic field.

581
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:55,927
Similar to what occurs
when there's a bad
solar storm.

582
00:34:55,996 --> 00:34:57,938
What are we
talking about
here, gentlemen?

583
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,288
Aurora Borealis?

584
00:34:59,356 --> 00:35:01,461
Auroras normally occur
when the Earth's poles

585
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,058
attract solar particles.

586
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:05,749
The fact that so many
polar auroras are
appearing elsewhere,

587
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:08,208
indicates that
new magnetic
poles are developing.

588
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:10,137
I saw a
polar aurora

589
00:35:10,202 --> 00:35:12,209
here
last night.

590
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,648
We are now sitting
on a magnetic pole.

591
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,655
Which explains all the
electromagnetic interference,

592
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:18,420
and the
seismic activity
we've been having.

593
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:21,652
Many strange anomalies
have occurred in
modern times

594
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,542
without catastrophic
consequence.

595
00:35:23,608 --> 00:35:27,437
These, um, fields
are like, um,

596
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:30,358
rubber bands.
They bend and
stretch and thin,

597
00:35:30,423 --> 00:35:34,164
but inevitably they
always return to
their original state.

598
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,807
But this
time the rubber
band has snapped!

599
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:43,278
Mr. President, the mini poles
indicate electromagnetic
reversal has started.

600
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:44,875
As the
north and south
poles disintegrate,

601
00:35:44,948 --> 00:35:47,468
the magnetic field
they support
will collapse,

602
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,092
static discharges
will create
electromagnetic shock waves

603
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:51,919
which will fry
everything electronic.

604
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:53,645
We'll be
thrown back into
the Stone Age.

605
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:55,438
The north and
south poles
will disappear,

606
00:35:55,506 --> 00:35:57,229
reemerging at
opposite ends
of the globe,

607
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:58,891
by which point
our protective
magnetic shield

608
00:35:58,962 --> 00:36:01,165
will be completely
gone, exposing us
to cosmic rays

609
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:03,022
which will
incinerate the planet,

610
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:04,430
just like what
happened on Mars!

611
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:07,398
Must we be
so melodramatic?

612
00:36:09,232 --> 00:36:11,882
This is real science,
Mr. President.

613
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:15,464
This planet
has seen many
geomagnetic reversals.

614
00:36:15,535 --> 00:36:17,291
Just not since
we've been here.

615
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,520
As a man
of science,

616
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,078
I'm sure you can
appreciate the need

617
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,353
for thoughtful,
rational discussion.

618
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:29,217
However, your melodrama
and sensational
media appearances,

619
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:32,707
gives one the impression
that your intentions
are perhaps

620
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,667
more to do
with self-promotion.

621
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:41,544
I've had a long
day, gentlemen.
I'm signing off.

622
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,988
What did you
expect, James?

623
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:48,360
You just told them
the world was
gonna end.

624
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:50,149
This isn't
global warming, Dad,

625
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:51,777
where we can spend
years dragging our feet

626
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,460
and debating
the facts.

627
00:36:55,528 --> 00:36:57,022
They'll find
out soon enough.

628
00:36:57,096 --> 00:36:58,983
[birds chirping]

629
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:17,633

00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,129
[piercing sound

631
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,407
Wait.

632
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:24,508
That's the same sound
I heard just before
the quake last night.

633
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:29,467
[shrill sound]

634

[distant dull roar]

638
00:38:03,997 --> 00:38:05,174
Turn off the car!

639
00:38:27,545 --> 00:38:30,512
[thunderous booming]

640
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:31,631
[sizzling]

[beeping]

643
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:53,004
My God.
I've never seen
anything like this.

00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:55,438
[beeps]

645
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:56,937
Save your
data everybody!

646
00:39:42,604 --> 00:39:44,327
[phone rings]

647
00:39:44,395 --> 00:39:46,021
Storm Hazards.

648
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,019
(James)
What just happened?

649
00:39:47,083 --> 00:39:48,228
Oh, my God, James.

650
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:50,568
It was a massive 40 khz
EM pulse surge.

651
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:52,325
Unlike anything
we've ever seen.

652
00:39:52,394 --> 00:39:53,987
40 kilohertz?

653
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,057
Yes. All the cities
that were hit were
blacked out.

654
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,911
And not only that.
Most of the satellites
in orbit got fried.

655
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,049
What could have
possibly created
a surge like that?

656
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,087
It's gotta be
connected to the
polar auroras.

657
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,501
Were the
hits random?

658
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,706
I don't know yet.
We lost power
during the spike,

659
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:10,182
which was
lucky for us.

660
00:40:10,248 --> 00:40:11,840
Otherwise the EM
surge would have
fried everything.

661
00:40:11,911 --> 00:40:14,115
We're just getting our
emergency generators going.

662
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:15,360
We're pulling up data now.

663
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,252
I'm seeing about
2 dozen points,

664
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:19,904
where 40-mile wide
EM waves struck Earth.

665
00:40:21,414 --> 00:40:24,228
Overlay the locations
of the mini poles
on your screen,

666
00:40:24,293 --> 00:40:25,570
and tell me
what you see.

667
00:40:25,637 --> 00:40:28,898
Overlay locations
of all detected
mini poles.

668
00:40:36,035 --> 00:40:37,561
Oh, my God.

669
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:41,147
All the hit areas
are where the
mini poles are.

670
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:43,575
Then that's it.

671
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,275
The solar particles
attracted by the poles

672
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,516
are building up massive
electrostatic discharges!

673
00:40:47,584 --> 00:40:50,399
Pam, your office
has to tell all
those hit areas

674
00:40:50,464 --> 00:40:52,951
to evacuate,
including Lindenville.

675
00:40:53,024 --> 00:40:56,057
The discharges are gonna
get much stronger as
the field fails.

676
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:57,687
It's going to be
hard to issue
an alert

677
00:40:57,759 --> 00:41:00,442
with a global blackout
but we'll certainly
do our best.

678
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:05,011
Can you run a
timeline projection
on your mainframe?

679
00:41:05,086 --> 00:41:07,474
Give me
a couple
of hours.

680
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,621
It'll take a while
to process
the data.

681
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:15,160
James? How do
we stop this?

682
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:16,569
I don't know
that we can.

683
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:27,316
We just had the first
worldwide blackout
in history.

684
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,906
And you and none
of your brains
can explain why?

685
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:31,352
What we know
right now
for certain

686
00:41:31,418 --> 00:41:33,173
is that the
affected cities
were struck

687
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,216
by large
electromagnetic shock waves.

688
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:37,393
Just as
Dr. Mayfield
had predicted.

689
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:41,555
General, have
you been able to
locate your son yet?

690
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:45,398
Not yet, sir.
He's in one of
the blackout areas.

691
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,951
Well, I want to speak
with him as soon as
he's located.

692
00:41:48,023 --> 00:41:49,037
Yes, Mr. President.

693
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:50,704
So tell me,
Dr. Elman,

694
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,367
can you still say
with a certainty

695
00:41:52,438 --> 00:41:54,129
that we're
not experiencing
pole reversal?

696
00:41:54,198 --> 00:41:56,052
I don't have an
answer right
now, sir.

697
00:41:56,117 --> 00:41:57,328
Are we
going to see
more of this?

698
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,924
Give me the
worst-case scenario.

699
00:41:58,997 --> 00:42:00,458
Mr. President, until
we've assembled
our teams,

700
00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:01,808
I don't want
to speculate
on something

701
00:42:01,876 --> 00:42:03,403
that's not my
area of expertise.

702
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:05,842
Don't try to
cover your ass
with me, doctor.

703
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:09,736
We've got power outages
across the country!
American lives are at risk!

704
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:11,633
So tell me,
to the best
of your ability,

705
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:14,567
are we going
to see more
of this?

706
00:42:17,394 --> 00:42:19,303
I believe so,
Mr. President.

707
00:42:21,617 --> 00:42:23,242
Then I have
no choice

708
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:26,509
but to declare
federal martial law.

709
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:27,721
General Mayfield?

710
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:29,101
Yes, sir.

711
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:31,372
You'll supervise
west coast operations.

712
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,966
Yes, Mr. President.

713
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:35,788
We'll start setting
up shelters in the
affected areas, sir.

714
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,361
James, thank God.

715
00:42:52,428 --> 00:42:53,409
Did you
find Shane?

716
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:54,498
Yeah, he was
at the park,

717
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,000
I've been trying
to call you.

718
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:57,930
Cell phones are useless.
Only landlines
are working.

719
00:42:57,995 --> 00:42:59,172
Where's Shane?

720
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,519
One of the
kids he was
with last night

721
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:02,147
was killed in
the earthquake.

722
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:03,908
Oh, no.

723
00:43:03,978 --> 00:43:05,767
What's going on?

724
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,288
There's no power
and I saw an EM
wave in the sky.

725
00:43:08,361 --> 00:43:10,597
It's bad. We're gonna
have to get out
of Lindenville.

726
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:18,722
Shane.

727
00:43:27,046 --> 00:43:28,256
You okay?

728
00:43:30,053 --> 00:43:31,646
It's happening, huh?

729
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:34,051
Is the world
falling apart?

730
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,611
No, no.

731
00:43:37,829 --> 00:43:39,738
Just going
through a
rough patch.

732
00:43:58,304 --> 00:44:00,192
I've packed
for us both.

733
00:44:02,176 --> 00:44:03,354
I'm not
going with you.

734
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:04,984
What do
you mean?

735
00:44:05,056 --> 00:44:06,878
I'm going back
to the base.

736
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:09,277
What are you
talking about?
Why?

737
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,837
I have an idea,

738
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:12,318
and I have to talk
to the President.

739
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,350
I don't want
to, Cyn,
I just--

740
00:44:15,421 --> 00:44:16,948
I don't see
that there's
a choice.

741
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:19,956
You're right,
there is no choice,

742
00:44:20,029 --> 00:44:22,200
because your
family comes first.

743
00:44:22,269 --> 00:44:25,203
No wonder Shane thinks
you don't love him.

744
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:26,737
Listen to me.

745
00:44:26,812 --> 00:44:28,786
This is
not a drill.

746
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:30,168
It's the real deal.

747
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,926
The survival of
the planet depends

748
00:44:31,995 --> 00:44:33,750
on actions taken
in the next
24 hours

749
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:37,495
and those
so-called government
science advisers

750
00:44:37,562 --> 00:44:39,471
don't have a clue.

751
00:44:42,393 --> 00:44:44,051
I have to
do this.

752
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,384
For us.

753
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:53,751
We're here, smack in
the middle of a mini
pole's magnetic center,

754
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:55,603
the most
dangerous place
to be right now.

755
00:44:55,671 --> 00:44:57,231
Everywhere inside
this circle

756
00:44:57,302 --> 00:44:59,124
is gonna get
bombarded by
EM pulses

757
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:01,165
and torn apart by
seismic disturbances.

758
00:45:01,238 --> 00:45:03,245
I want you guys
out of this circle

759
00:45:03,317 --> 00:45:05,456
as soon as possible.
Go to this town here,

760
00:45:05,526 --> 00:45:08,908
Little Brook
and wait for
me, okay?

761
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:11,850
What are you
talking about, Dad?
You're coming, right?

762
00:45:13,652 --> 00:45:16,750
I can't.
I have to go
back to the base.

763
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:19,950
I don't believe
it, you're
abandoning us?

764
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:21,448
That sucks!

765
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:24,272
Try to understand,
there is a global
crisis going on.

766
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:25,931
You think
I don't
know that?

767
00:45:26,002 --> 00:45:28,336
I saw one of my classmates
crushed to death in
a car last night.

768
00:45:28,402 --> 00:45:30,573
I know.
I'm sorry.

769
00:45:30,641 --> 00:45:32,582
So you don't care
if the same thing
happens to us?

770
00:45:32,656 --> 00:45:34,827
Of course I do,
that's why I have
to fix this.

771
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:35,845
We'll be okay.

772
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,935
Leave me alone.

773
00:45:39,664 --> 00:45:41,092
Shane, come on!

774
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:47,244
When an EM wave hits,
turn the car off till
it passes.

775
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,518
The electronics won't be
short-circuited as long as
the power's off.

776
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:55,971
If the power's on,
you and the car
will fry.

777
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,020
How long
will you be?

778
00:45:58,092 --> 00:46:00,231
A day.
Maybe two.

779
00:46:01,548 --> 00:46:02,955
Be careful.

780
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:04,099
Yeah.

781
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:06,753
You too.

782
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:21,733
Shane?

783
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:24,288
No! No!
No, no, no!

784
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,920
Take those
earbuds off.

785
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:27,650
Stay away
from electronics.

786
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,175
You will
get electrocuted
if an EM wave hits.

787
00:46:31,591 --> 00:46:34,046
I'm serious.
It's dangerous.
Get rid of it.

788
00:46:38,214 --> 00:46:40,156
I'll see you soon.

789
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:41,211
Hey--

790
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,249
I love you.

791
00:46:52,995 --> 00:46:56,191
(male voice over radio)
All residents are
advised to remain tuned

792
00:46:56,259 --> 00:46:58,113
to this emergency
broadcast channel.

793
00:46:58,179 --> 00:47:00,796
Federal martial law
has been declared.

794
00:47:00,865 --> 00:47:03,483
Lindenville residents
are ordered to evacuate
their homes

795
00:47:03,553 --> 00:47:06,008
and take shelter
at Lindenville parish.

796
00:47:06,081 --> 00:47:10,074
Why are they telling
everyone to go
to the church?

797
00:47:10,145 --> 00:47:13,689
Didn't Dad say
it's dangerous
to stay in town?

798
00:47:19,935 --> 00:47:21,757
Oh, what's this?

799
00:47:31,453 --> 00:47:32,729
The road's closed.

800
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:34,618
You're supposed to take
shelter in the parish.

801
00:47:34,684 --> 00:47:36,626
We're going
to Little Brook.

802
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:44,633
Ma'am, we have orders
to divert everyone to
the Lindenville parish.

803
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,902
That's ridiculous.
It's not even
safe there.

804
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:49,042
Ma'am, please,
just back it up.

805
00:47:49,113 --> 00:47:50,607
Alright? Let's go.

806
00:48:08,374 --> 00:48:10,992
[radio wallah
with interference]

807
00:48:13,078 --> 00:48:14,288
Come on!

808
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,227
[piercing sound]

[silence]

819
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:32,260
I think it's gone.

820
00:49:33,448 --> 00:49:34,396
Start the car.

821
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:34,838
Damn it!

822
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:38,778
We'll have
to go back.

823
00:50:38,844 --> 00:50:43,546
[loud growing rumble]

824
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:46,450
[loud cracking]

825
00:50:47,676 --> 00:50:49,017
Get out of
the car now!

826

Come on! Jump!

I can't hold on!

835
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:09,805
Yes, you can!!
Don't let go!!

836
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:12,903
Help!
Anybody, help!

837
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:22,344
Grab it!

838
00:52:24,459 --> 00:52:25,408
Come on!!

839
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,766
[groaning]

840
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:53,860
(James)
We need to
evacuate everyone

841
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:55,333
from the mini
pole sites.

842
00:52:55,397 --> 00:52:57,917
We just started
rounding up people
for the shelters.

843
00:52:57,989 --> 00:52:59,418
No, you can't
do that.

844
00:52:59,493 --> 00:53:01,980
The plasma charges
building up from
the pole reversal

845
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,514
are escaping
through the
mini poles.

846
00:53:03,588 --> 00:53:05,890
This whole area
is gonna get hit
worse and worse,

847
00:53:05,956 --> 00:53:07,581
as the field fails.

848
00:53:07,652 --> 00:53:09,986
Alright. I'll notify
the soldiers

849
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:11,131
but communications
have been spotty.

850
00:53:11,204 --> 00:53:12,381
What about
the President?

851
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:13,661
Will you be able
to contact him?

852
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:15,258
Yeah, the emergency
hotline is holding up.

853
00:53:15,331 --> 00:53:17,851
Good. I've got
a crazy idea.

854
00:53:17,922 --> 00:53:20,769
I need to
access Storm
Hazard's mainframe.

855
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:23,135
Oh, follow me.

856
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:24,248
[phone rings]

857
00:53:26,753 --> 00:53:27,767
Storm Hazards.

858
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,116
Pam, talk to me.

859
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:30,678
I'm briefing
the President
in a few minutes.

860
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:33,054
James, the
computer projection--

861
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,461
it's not good.

862
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:55,057
I need to see
whoever's in charge.

863
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:56,692
Get that.

864
00:53:56,764 --> 00:53:58,105
Take them in.

865
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:04,505
Inside this circle
is the most dangerous
place in the west coast.

866
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,871
We're here,
at the epicenter
of the mini pole

867
00:54:06,938 --> 00:54:09,359
creating the
electromagnetic and
seismic disturbances.

868
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:11,321
We need to move
all of these people

869
00:54:11,385 --> 00:54:13,457
outside the
circle to here.

870
00:54:13,529 --> 00:54:15,154
Where did you get
this information?

871
00:54:15,224 --> 00:54:16,784
My husband,
Dr. James Mayfield.

872
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:18,034
He's a government
astrophysicist.

873
00:54:18,104 --> 00:54:19,532
He's briefing the
President right now.

874
00:54:19,607 --> 00:54:22,421
I--l--I haven't heard
anything about this.

875
00:54:22,487 --> 00:54:24,974
My orders are to keep
everybody here.

876
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:27,730
I know, but
I'm telling you
it's not safe here.

877
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:31,180
Lindenville has become
the magnetic center
of a mini pole.

878
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,541
What is that?
Mini pole?

879
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:48,364
[motor starts]

880
00:54:56,241 --> 00:54:57,964
No, no, no.
Turn the
power off.

881
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:00,651
The electricity will
attract the next
EM pulse.

882
00:55:00,721 --> 00:55:02,215
You have to shut
the generator down.

883
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:04,623
Shut it down?
I don't think so.

884
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:07,371
You're not
listening to me!
We're in danger here!

885
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,741
Ma'am, federal martial
law has been declared.

886
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,563
I can't just move
hundreds of people

887
00:55:11,631 --> 00:55:13,835
because you show me
some map with a circle
drawn on it.

888
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:15,790
You know what?
Call General Mayfield.

889
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,261
He'll vouch
for everything
I just said.

890
00:55:24,684 --> 00:55:26,473
(James)
Storm Hazard's lab
just ran this projection.

891
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:30,980
This is what the magnetic
field normally looks like.

892
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:32,295
This is what it
looks like now.

893
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:34,086
Punctured by
mini poles.

894
00:55:36,843 --> 00:55:39,232
This is 12 hours out.

895
00:55:39,306 --> 00:55:42,273
24 hours out,

896
00:55:42,346 --> 00:55:44,200
48 hours out.

897
00:55:44,266 --> 00:55:46,534
Magnetic field
at zero Gauss.

898
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,356
Gentlemen, we
have two days

899
00:55:48,424 --> 00:55:50,977
before our planet loses
its protective shield.

900
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:54,081
and solar radiation
burns us all to
a crisp.

901
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,459
Anyone here
take issue with Dr.
Mayfield's projections?

902
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:07,908
No, sir.

903
00:56:07,973 --> 00:56:09,663
No, sir.

904
00:56:11,716 --> 00:56:13,309
Alright, then,

905
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,543
so who's got a
game plan to stop
this pole reversal?

906
00:56:16,611 --> 00:56:18,880
Alright, this is
the way I see it.

907
00:56:18,947 --> 00:56:21,368
What if we detonate
a nuclear explosion

908
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:22,970
of a magnitude equal
to that with which

909
00:56:23,043 --> 00:56:24,449
the comet
fragment hit Earth

910
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,107
in the
opposing hemisphere

911
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:28,087
so that it
pushes back
with equal force?

912
00:56:28,162 --> 00:56:29,656
Are you crazy?

913
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,137
How do we know
it wouldn't make
things worse?

914
00:56:31,202 --> 00:56:32,314
What about fallout?

915
00:56:32,385 --> 00:56:34,010
Fallout?

916
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:37,147
The pole reversal
completes in
48 hours

917
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:40,118
and then it is
bye-bye planet.

918
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:42,777
Does anybody else
have a better idea?

919
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,983
That's what
I thought.

920
00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:50,330
That comet
fragment hit us

921
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:52,253
with the force of
a 100-megaton bomb.

922
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:53,944
We don't
have a warhead
that powerful.

923
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:56,533
What's the most
powerful nuke in
the U.S. arsenal?

924
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:59,867
We have a new 50-megaton
prototype that's at the
nuclear test site.

925
00:56:59,933 --> 00:57:02,583
We can do a
double detonation
to equal a hundred.

926
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,610
[noises over radio]

927
00:57:08,827 --> 00:57:09,940
And?

928
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,417
We can't get through
to the general.

929
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:12,660
Our communications
are down.

930
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:14,225
We can't just leave
these people here.

931
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,469
This place is a
ticking time bomb.

932
00:57:16,538 --> 00:57:18,926
I suggest
you find a cot
and you chill.

933
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:23,635
And?

934
00:57:23,704 --> 00:57:24,914
(soldier)
Not yet, sir.

935
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,068
Zoe!

936
00:57:29,144 --> 00:57:30,453
Hey, when did
you get here?

937
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:31,948
Just a few
minutes ago.

938
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:36,812
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your
attention please?

939
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:38,893
Hi, I'm
Cynthia Mayfield,

940
00:57:38,966 --> 00:57:41,387
I'm a science teacher
at Lindenville High.

941
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:44,211
Many of you know that
my husband, Dr.
James Mayfield

942
00:57:44,277 --> 00:57:46,186
is a
respected astrophysicist.

943
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:49,228
He's told me
that our town
is the epicenter

944
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:51,405
of the
electromagnetic and
seismic disturbances

945
00:57:51,476 --> 00:57:53,167
that is
happening on
the west coast

946
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,203
and that it's very
dangerous to stay here.

947
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:58,642
So we need to move
outside the circle.

948
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:00,429
The nearest
safe town is
Little Brook.

949
00:58:00,498 --> 00:58:02,440
(soldier)
You want to step
down from there, ma'am?

950
00:58:02,514 --> 00:58:04,401
How come the
soldiers don't
know this?

951
00:58:04,465 --> 00:58:06,058
Because their
communications are down.

952
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:07,373
They're completely
in the dark.

953
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,783
I'm not gonna ask
you again, ma'am.

954
00:58:08,849 --> 00:58:11,783
Please, listen to me.
We could all die here!

955
00:58:11,856 --> 00:58:13,711
Get her off
of there.

956
00:58:15,023 --> 00:58:16,616
Is it true?

957
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:24,134
If you open your
mouth about this
to anyone again,

958
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:27,076
you will
be arrested.
Is that clear?

959
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:29,637
Yes.

960
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,938
And I don't want
to see that
map again.

961
00:58:33,004 --> 00:58:33,898
Release her.

962
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:47,302
(general)
James, you'll
be happy to know

963
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,996
that the
bomber is
on its way.

964
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:52,579
And 250-megaton
warheads will launch
at 16:00 hours.

965
00:59:06,535 --> 00:59:08,258
[phone rings]

966
00:59:08,327 --> 00:59:09,275
Yes?

967
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:12,927
What do you mean
we lost the plane?

968
00:59:16,294 --> 00:59:17,701
Yes.
Thank you.

969
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:22,332
An EM pulse took
out the bomber.

970
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:24,412
The warheads
exploded in midair.

971
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:26,239
They have to try again.
Send another plane.

972
00:59:26,307 --> 00:59:29,089
James, the skies are
unflyable. We'll
lose them all.

973
00:59:29,155 --> 00:59:31,872
They have to try.
Send 20 planes.
One might get through.

974
00:59:31,939 --> 00:59:33,946
James. James.

975
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:37,084
You have to think
of something
else. Fast.

976
00:59:37,154 --> 00:59:39,194
There's got to
be another way.

977
00:59:39,266 --> 00:59:40,924
(Cyn)
We've got to
get out of here.

978
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:44,092
Why would the soldiers
keep us here if it
isn't safe?

979
00:59:44,161 --> 00:59:46,430
Because they
don't know anything.

980
00:59:46,497 --> 00:59:48,885
They're just
following their
last orders.

981
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,334
Communications have
gotten so bad

982
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,406
they can't
even contact
their superiors.

983
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:57,245
What do you
want to do?

984
00:59:59,902 --> 01:00:03,676
Dr. Mayfield was right
when he said the comet
might hit Earth.

985
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,301
I think we
should go.

986
01:00:09,117 --> 01:00:10,065
We're in.

987
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:16,082
Come on.

988
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:17,814
It's right over here.

989
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:20,784
This one here.

990
01:00:41,143 --> 01:00:43,925
Those poor people,
I feel so bad
leaving them.

991
01:00:43,991 --> 01:00:45,900
You did everything
you could, Cyn.

992
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,938
(James)
Gentlemen, I have a
new plan that might just work.

993
01:00:53,013 --> 01:00:54,704
We're gonna detonate
at the bottom of
the ocean,

994
01:00:54,773 --> 01:00:57,456
the Mariana Trench, the
deepest point in
the Earth's crust.

995
01:00:58,389 --> 01:00:59,730
Dr. Elman?

996
01:00:59,796 --> 01:01:01,487
Yes, the
ocean crust
is thin enough

997
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:03,727
that the blast
could go right through
to the lithosphere

998
01:01:03,796 --> 01:01:07,951
yes, it could conceivably
push the planet back
into alignment.

999
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:12,077
The Mariana Trench
is over 36,000 feet,
deep, doctor.

1000
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,706
How do you plan
on getting there?

1001
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:16,911
A submarine.

1002
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:18,406
Unfortunately, doctor,

1003
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:20,750
we don't have any
that are operational.

1004
01:01:20,817 --> 01:01:22,126
What do you mean?

1005
01:01:22,192 --> 01:01:24,395
EM interference
crippled the
onboard computers

1006
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:26,089
that control the
nuclear reactors.

1007
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,745
Are you telling me
there's not a single
sub out there?

1008
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:30,221
That's right.

1009
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:33,450
That's not exactly
true, general.

1010
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:36,616
The Russians have an old
diesel they still
train on.

1011
01:01:36,686 --> 01:01:38,377
She isn't
pretty but
she's running.

1012
01:01:38,446 --> 01:01:41,445
She's on the west coast
for international training.

1013
01:01:58,602 --> 01:01:59,617
Open that bunker.

1014
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,672
Yes, sir!

I guess they're still
ordering everyone
to the church.

[radio interference
with whistle]

1018
01:02:32,709 --> 01:02:33,691
I can hear it.

1019
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,732
Hear what?

1020
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:38,396
An EM
pulse tone.

1021
01:02:38,468 --> 01:02:39,678
What's an
EM pulse tone?

1022
01:02:39,747 --> 01:02:41,340
Electromagnetic shockwave.

1023
01:02:41,411 --> 01:02:45,119
It's a burst of
electromagnetic energy
coming from mini pole.

1024
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:51,447
That sub should
be in the harbor
by now.

[shrill whistle over radio]

1026
01:02:55,808 --> 01:02:57,401
What the heck
is that noise?

1027
01:02:57,472 --> 01:02:59,643
It's a pulse tone.
Cut the engine, Dad.

1028
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:00,759
Now?

1029
01:03:00,832 --> 01:03:01,977
Yes! Stop
the car,
right now!

[shrill piercing whistle]

1031

Ah!

1032
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,122
What was that?

Oh, my God.

1037
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:37,716
Turn the car
off, Michael!
Turn it off!

1038
01:03:41,945 --> 01:03:43,351
Everything electric
has to be turned off,

mp3 players,
everything.

01:03:45,624 --> 01:03:47,892
Get rid of your
watch, Michael.

1041
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,250
[distant roar]

1042
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:57,331
I hope those guys
remember to cut
their engine.

1043
01:04:05,684 --> 01:04:07,113
Cut your engine!

1044
01:04:18,706 --> 01:04:22,448
[many screams]

1045
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:38,630
Cut your engine!!

1046
01:04:38,703 --> 01:04:40,109
Cut your engine!!

1047
01:04:57,964 --> 01:04:59,272
I think it passed.

1048
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:03,274
Michael, what's wrong?

1049
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:06,241
Dad? Are
you okay?

1050
01:05:07,722 --> 01:05:08,802
Can you drive?

1051
01:05:08,874 --> 01:05:09,986
Sure.

1052
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:17,504
James! Check
the engine.

1053
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:21,313
We've got
no time
to waste.

1054
01:05:31,206 --> 01:05:33,278
Battery and
accelerator are fried.

1055
01:05:38,341 --> 01:05:41,090
Looks like we may
be an hour away from
getting out of the circle.

1056
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:43,098
We need to get
my father to
a hospital.

1057
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,578
What's wrong?

1058
01:05:44,644 --> 01:05:46,716
He has a pacemaker.
I think the storm
shorted it out.

1059
01:05:48,355 --> 01:05:50,177
Oh, God!

1060
01:06:03,553 --> 01:06:04,796
Here.

1061
01:06:19,806 --> 01:06:21,049
How are
we doing?

1062
01:06:21,117 --> 01:06:22,328
Good. Give
it a try.

1063
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:23,346
Okay.

1064
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:31,802
[motor starts]

1065
01:06:54,744 --> 01:07:00,821
[Russian wallah]

1066
01:07:02,326 --> 01:07:03,504
[horn honks]

1067
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:24,240
It is an honor,
General Mayfield.

1068
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:25,616
Captain Yolenkov.

1069
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:27,111
This is
Dr. Mayfield.

1070
01:07:27,186 --> 01:07:28,134
Captain.

1071
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,639
I see
the resemblance.

1072
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:32,364
There are two
warheads in the
back of that truck.

1073
01:07:32,433 --> 01:07:35,466
[speaks Russian]

1074
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:41,230
So, we work
together to
save world, no?

1075
01:07:41,296 --> 01:07:45,518
Yes. Dr. Mayfield
will formulate the
detonation sequence.

1076
01:07:45,583 --> 01:07:49,477
My ship, she strong as ox
but she's not so fast,
you know.

1077
01:07:49,551 --> 01:07:52,333
Yes. We know.

1078
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,067
The closest town is
Clarksville. We passed
it a few minutes ago.

1079
01:08:05,132 --> 01:08:06,692
Maybe they
have a hospital.

1080
01:08:06,764 --> 01:08:08,073
No, don't go back.

1081
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,790
I'm okay.
Just get out
of the circle.

1082
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:13,641
[shrill whistle]

1083
01:08:17,418 --> 01:08:18,792
Oh, no,
not again.

1084
01:08:20,106 --> 01:08:22,920
[shrill whistle]

1085
01:08:22,985 --> 01:08:25,254
[distant roar]

1086
01:08:25,321 --> 01:08:27,622
(general)
They've gotta get
out of here fast.

1087
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:41,121
(man)
Get out or I'll
blow your head off.

1088
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:43,556
Okay.
Okay, okay.

1089
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,239
Everyone get out
or I'll kill
all of you!

1090
01:08:46,309 --> 01:08:48,251
Please, my father
is having a
heart attack,

1091
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,146
we have to get
him to a hospital.

1092
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:53,060
Get out or I'll
put him out of
his misery.

1093
01:08:53,124 --> 01:08:55,938
Take it easy.
We're going.

1094
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:02,359
Get out.

1095
01:09:17,952 --> 01:09:19,740
[shout]

1096
01:09:23,967 --> 01:09:25,341
[shout]

1097
01:09:25,406 --> 01:09:26,355
Dad!

1098
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:39,610
[intermittent beeping]

1099
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:55,759
What are the conditions
in the Mariana Trench?

1100
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:58,386
Expect seismic
activity like
you've never seen.

1101
01:09:58,457 --> 01:10:00,180
You should
warn your crew

1102
01:10:00,248 --> 01:10:01,709
that the steam vents
will be heating up
the ocean

1103
01:10:01,784 --> 01:10:03,410
causing violent
current shifts.

1104
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:06,611
Hm. All
this from rock
hitting Earth?

1105
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:10,290
Technically, the
comet fragment was
made of ice, but yes.

1106
01:10:10,359 --> 01:10:15,922
So tell me, Dr. Mayfield,
you plan to detonate
these bombs at one time

1107
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:19,372
[sigh]
No. Not exactly.

1108
01:10:19,445 --> 01:10:21,419
In order
to get a
100-megaton explosion,

1109
01:10:21,493 --> 01:10:26,162
I need to formulate a
detonation sequence
just milliseconds apart.

1110
01:10:26,228 --> 01:10:30,700
You know, of course, that
this vessel cannot outrun
such a shockwave.

1111
01:10:34,195 --> 01:10:35,210
We know.

1112
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:40,363
Your crew, captain.
Do they know?

1113
01:10:40,434 --> 01:10:44,110
They have volunteered
for this mission,

1114
01:10:44,177 --> 01:10:46,762
in order
to save
their families.

1115
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:50,213
[buzz]

1116
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,143
[beep]

1117
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:53,768
[thud]

1118
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,135
Outrunning the
shockwave is the
least of our worries.

1119
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,840
It's fried, Shane.

1120
01:12:03,908 --> 01:12:06,144
You know you can't
start a car without
the battery.

1121
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,967
Cars in the old days
didn't have batteries.

1122
01:12:08,035 --> 01:12:09,213
They had
hand cranks.

1123
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,137
Yeah, well,
we don't have
a hand crank,

1124
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:12,795
and this is
a modern car.

1125
01:12:12,866 --> 01:12:15,484
You don't
need a battery
to drive either.

1126
01:12:15,554 --> 01:12:17,342
All yo need to
do is capture an
electrical charge

1127
01:12:17,409 --> 01:12:19,197
so it'll
help ignite
the spark plugs.

1128
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:21,654
Where are we
gonna get
that from?

1129
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:40,120
Ever seen
anything like this?

1130
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,433
No one has.

1131
01:12:41,501 --> 01:12:44,119
We're witnessing
a geological event

1132
01:12:44,189 --> 01:12:46,360
that hasn't happened
on this scale in
millions of years.

1133
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:49,494
What creates
such hell?

1134
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:55,410
Massive techtonic movements.

1135
01:12:55,483 --> 01:12:58,298
How will this
affect the mission?

1136
01:12:58,363 --> 01:13:00,697
Well, it makes it
nearly impossible.

1137
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,252
[metal groaning]

1138
01:13:45,043 --> 01:13:46,766

[male voice over radio,

1143
01:14:32,715 --> 01:14:33,794
Dad.

1144
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,694
Dad.

1145
01:14:49,767 --> 01:14:51,076
I'm okay.

1146
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:57,058
We have
lost one engine.

1147
01:14:57,127 --> 01:14:58,850
Power will
be 50%.

1148
01:15:12,451 --> 01:15:13,433
Hey.

1149
01:15:18,595 --> 01:15:20,896
Can Shane really
do what he says
he's doing?

1150
01:15:22,882 --> 01:15:25,500
All I know is Shane
loves working
with cars.

1151
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,708
He's the
biggest greaser
at our school.

1152
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,211
Better hurry up
with that, Shane.

1153
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:01,755
100 meters from bottom.

1154
01:16:01,819 --> 01:16:03,281
Almost in position.

1155
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,784
[metal groaning]

1156
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:24,722
Damn it!

1157
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,027
We cannot stay
at this dept
very long.

1158
01:16:27,095 --> 01:16:29,135
You have a
family, captain?

1159
01:16:29,207 --> 01:16:30,483
Of course.

1160
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,306
So we're gonna stay
here as long as
it takes.

1161
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:38,128
If we die from
a crushed hull
or a shockwave,

1162
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:39,691
what difference
does it make?

1163
01:16:39,765 --> 01:16:42,132
If we fail,
the whole
world dies.

1164
01:16:46,612 --> 01:16:48,139
[beeping]

1165
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:50,350
This is it.

1166
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:51,848
We're on!

1167
01:16:51,923 --> 01:16:54,889
Okay, I got us
in the timers
on the warheads!

1168
01:16:54,962 --> 01:16:57,711
[speaks Russian]

1169
01:17:01,106 --> 01:17:02,054
Here it comes!

1170
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:03,438
I'm just
about done.

1171
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:04,749
I don't think l
should be holding
this anymore.

1172
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:05,831
Almost there.

1173
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:11,533
Shane!

1174
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,745
Done!
Antena!

1175
01:17:12,816 --> 01:17:13,743
Tape!

1176
01:17:15,919 --> 01:17:16,867
Come on!

1177
01:17:24,205 --> 01:17:26,147
We need to
move away.

1178
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:29,123
Shane, come on!

1179
01:17:33,804 --> 01:17:34,916
Let's go!

1180
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:19,298
I feel happy
to die knowing
it was to--

1181
01:18:19,364 --> 01:18:21,436
save family
on surface.

1182
01:18:23,076 --> 01:18:25,497
But I'm sad
that you must
die with your son.

1183
01:18:27,587 --> 01:18:29,823
Until a few
days ago,

1184
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:33,054
I hadn't
seen James
in five years.

1185
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:37,213
So--

1186
01:18:37,281 --> 01:18:39,256
[door creaks]
(James)
We're on.

1187
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:55,196
It's done, captain.
Fire when ready.

1188
01:18:59,997 --> 01:19:02,299
[alarm sounds]

1189
01:19:17,882 --> 01:19:21,013
It will be impossible
to outrun the shockwave
with one engine,

1190
01:19:21,082 --> 01:19:22,609
but at least
I tried.

1191
01:19:26,521 --> 01:19:28,081
(Shane)
I think it's done.

1192
01:19:30,872 --> 01:19:32,944
We just have to pray
that one static charge

1193
01:19:33,016 --> 01:19:37,074
has been trapped
in the cylinder.

1194
01:19:37,143 --> 01:19:38,485
[motor doesn't start]

1195
01:19:38,551 --> 01:19:39,892
Come on, baby.

1196
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:41,519
[motor starts]

1197
01:19:43,254 --> 01:19:44,464
Yeah!

1198
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:47,884
You're a genius!

1199
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,148
We've got the greatest
show on earth here, Dad.

1200
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:12,304
It's a scientist's
dream, isn't it?

1201
01:20:32,589 --> 01:20:33,571
Captain!

1202
01:20:38,061 --> 01:20:40,516
If you could take
us into that volcano,

1203
01:20:40,588 --> 01:20:43,271
the steam funnel might
propel us out of the
shockwave's path.

1204
01:20:45,132 --> 01:20:48,393
The hull is
not designed
for such temperatures.

1205
01:20:48,459 --> 01:20:51,775
Hm. What have
we got to lose?

1206
01:21:09,704 --> 01:21:11,492
[loud metal groaning]

1207
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:19,774
Hull temperature
is rising.

1208
01:21:19,846 --> 01:21:22,366
The heat
is expanding

[static]

1210
01:21:40,034 --> 01:21:41,692
Brace yourselves.

1211
01:22:35,801 --> 01:22:39,149
(President)
Thanks to unprecedented
cooperation between nations,

1212
01:22:39,225 --> 01:22:45,301
we have survived the
most catastrophic event to
ever threaten our existence.

1213
01:22:45,367 --> 01:22:48,084
The Earth has been healed.

1214
01:22:48,151 --> 01:22:51,631
The human spirit
has triumphed.

1215
01:22:51,703 --> 01:22:55,761
But we will honor those lost
with our resolve to rebuild,

1216
01:22:55,830 --> 01:22:59,244
and we will rejoice
in what we've
been given.

1217
01:22:59,317 --> 01:23:01,935
A chance for
a new beginning.

1218
01:23:05,556 --> 01:23:07,944
Ten a.m.
Perfect time.

1219
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:11,730
And finally,

1220
01:23:11,795 --> 01:23:15,439
our fragile planet
owes a huge debt
to Dr. James Mayfield.

1221
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:36,296
He's here.

1222
01:23:45,293 --> 01:23:46,537
(Shane)
Dad!

1223
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,969
(James)
This is
your grandfather.
