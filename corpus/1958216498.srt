1
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,024
Kelsey?

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,694
Open the door.

3
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,363
Go away.

4
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,382
You're gonna destroy
the resale value of this dress.

5
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,761
Come on, Kelsey. Come on.

6
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,805
Oh, my-- Come on.

7
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:58,976
Kelsey.

8
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,187
Okay.

9
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,108
What the--?

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,909
I don't wanna pick the wrong one.

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,207
It's ice cream, Kels. Not a man.

12
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:39,892
Hey, girls.

13
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,102
-Oh, Lord, can we run?
-Too late.

14
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,438
-Hey, Maida.
-Hey.

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,317
Honey, have you been sleeping?

16
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,110
Too much.

17
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,030
My darling, you must have needed it.

18
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm sorry to hear about--

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,536
-What do people call it?
-What they've always called it.

20
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,163
Getting left at the altar.

21
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,417
You're gonna find everything's gonna
be all right. You're gonna take a vacay.

22
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,586
Go on a mission trip, you know?

23
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,923
You never know where and when
and how it's gonna happen.

24
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:12,799
You know?

25
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,136
How much older are you than your sister?

26
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,222
I'm 27.

27
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,769
Okay, well, keep praying. Keep praying.

28
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,231
Liz, you're gonna be at church tonight
at the mission spotlight, right?

29
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,068
-Yes. Thank you for reminding me.
-You're welcome.

30
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,280
Oh, and, Kelsey, you're gonna be able
to come and gather your things.

31
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,367
Okay. Okay.

32
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,787
I am not doing that.

33
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,706
What if he's there?
I can't see him now. I'm not doing it.

34
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,210
Don't be late. Okay.

35
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,721
Kelsey, what are you doing? We have to go.

36
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,473
Looking for a vacay.

37
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,935
-Oh, wait, I wanna go there.
-Yeah, me too.

38
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,812
But who's got that kind of money?

39
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,940
Well, you could sell the wedding swag.

40
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,526
Or go with Habitat for Humanity.

41
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,113
-I mean, you never know how or when--
-Oh, stop it!

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,411
I gave up my apartment, I quit my job,
everything to be the perfect wife,

43
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,704
and what do I get?

44
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,622
Pity. And lame advice.

45
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:28,959
While he gets a free pass because he used
the magic words, "The Lord told me."

46
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,627
Oh, I have some magic words for him.

47
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,548
What happened to sweatpants?

48
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,092
Do you want your cake back or not?

49
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,387
Let's go!

50
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,441
Hey.

51
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,359
-How's she doing?
-She's okay.

52
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:24,598
Mina.

53
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,235
-Hey.
-Sorry, not taking questions.

54
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,569
What are you doing?

55
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,780
Keys. I'm gonna put this in the car
and wait there.

56
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,073
-Kelsey.
-I can't, Liz.

57
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,283
There's too many... everything.

58
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,298
Cake.

59
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,778
-Hey.
-Just-- I gotta--

60
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:20,863
I'm late.

61
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,287
-I thought you weren't coming.
-Maida.

62
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,555
So thanks for supporting us
as we serve the Lord in the heart of Asia.

63
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,892
Hello from Taiwan.

64
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,023
We are so happy to come to America.

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,821
Jesus loves you.

66
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,450
Any questions before we wrap up?

67
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,868
Me.

68
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,369
Do you have any advice

69
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:13,123
for the young people
who may be struggling with disappointment

70
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,791
and need to listen to God?

71
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,001
Amen.

72
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,170
There's no formula,
if that's what you mean.

73
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,464
How are they gonna know God's will?

74
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,342
I definitely felt called to mission.

75
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,093
Me, I had plans that fell through,

76
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,346
so I took a teaching job
in Taiwan on a whim.

77
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,306
Worked out well for us.

78
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,352
I think God uses everything.

79
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,188
The way you love, the way you hurt,

80
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,774
your mistakes, your whims.

81
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,945
I guess if you're stuck,
maybe take a leap of faith.

82
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:14,685
What movie are we watching?

83
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,978
Disney.

84
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,229
<i>Mulan.</i>

85
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,397
Appropriate.

86
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,901
He offered me a job.

87
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,530
-Who?
-The guy from Taiwan.

88
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,323
Cool. Doing what?

89
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,869
Teaching. In Taiwan.

90
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,246
What?

91
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,708
He knows the principal.

92
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,543
And they always need teachers.

93
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:42,129
-But Taiwan?
-I'm taking a leap of faith.

94
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,298
Okay? There's nothing for me here.

95
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,925
Me. Mom.

96
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,262
Someone has to pay for Mom.
And you're still in college.

97
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,097
It's just for a semester.

98
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,099
Just for a semester?

99
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,559
Please, Liz.

100
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,686
I cannot take it.

101
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,730
The gossip, the questions.

102
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,232
"You're how old?"
"Why did you drive him away?"

103
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,026
"Braden heard from God. Why didn't you?"

104
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,695
-I need a win, Liz.
-It's your life.

105
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,615
Do whatever.

106
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,911
Where does Mom keep the old-lady tea?

107
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:21,710
This is a job. I'll send money home.

108
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,922
And Mom never remembers me
when I do visit.

109
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,590
The doctors say she's stable for now.

110
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,967
And how is being gone one semester
going to hurt?

111
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,057
It's Braden.

112
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,767
-Why is he calling you?
-I don't know.

113
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,270
-What do I do? Do I answer it?
-No. I don't know.

114
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,982
Just...

115
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,026
What do you want?

116
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,323
Why are you telling me all this?

117
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,286
Are we okay? No, I don't think so, Braden.

118
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,830
I don't think we're okay.
Why don't you ask yourself that?

119
00:08:58,914 --> 00:08:59,957
And while you're at it,

120
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,501
why don't you find a new church
that doesn't buy

121
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,962
your lame
"because God told me" excuses!

122
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:10,008
<i>I know it's a mess, but feelings change.
And I'm in love with Ashlyn.</i>

123
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,386
<i>Please just try and understand.</i>

124
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,098
Never call us again.

125
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,019
What?

126
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,312
What?

127
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,772
He's in love with Ashlyn.

128
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,692
Ashlyn, your college roommate?

129
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,735
They've covered
a lot of ground since then.

130
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:33,740
Hey, hey. Hey, look at me. Look at me.

131
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,119
Any guy who would blow up
everything with you

132
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,496
for some airhead in a strapless dress

133
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,083
doesn't deserve you, okay?

134
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,214
-Seriously?
-I'm sorry.

135
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,261
Okay, we need to go...

136
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,431
on a field trip.

137
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,267
Let's go.

138
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,069
Is this a bad idea?

139
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:12,821
This is a bad idea.

140
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,157
It's a part of the healing process.

141
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,619
Is that Ashlyn's car?

142
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,814
You should go.

143
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:51,527
To Taiwan?

144
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,364
-You're okay with that?
-No.

145
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,224
You're gonna call me, right?

146
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,147
-Get off!
-No.

147
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,900
-Do you hate me?
-Yes!

148
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,196
Now go before I start crying.

149
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,902
Taiwan Adventist Academy?

150
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:42,948
Thanks.

151
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,681
Hello?

152
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,699
Excuse me.

153
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,993
I'm looking for...

154
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,746
Mr. Li Ming.

155
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,207
My English not good.

156
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,124
Right.

157
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:18,585
Principal Li Ming?

158
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,129
Li Ming?

159
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,844
Oh, thanks.

160
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,639
<i>Ms. Kelsey.</i>

161
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:36,228
You very good, very good recommendation.

162
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:38,689
Because I speak English?

163
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:44,152
You travel okay?

164
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,198
I-- Long. Three planes, 22 hours.

165
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,324
So it's...

166
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,124
Just in time.

167
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,834
To...?

168
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:02,963
To teach the class good English.

169
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,511
What is this net?

170
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,222
Oh, this? This is--

171
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,688
-A Bible story. Five loaf, two fish.
-Right.

172
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,191
-Fishnets.
-Okay.

173
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,570
Kidding. Safety. Let's go.

174
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,825
This is the teachers' office.

175
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,620
Your desk. Come.

176
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,252
-We ready. We ready for you.
-Got it. And my classroom?

177
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:45,214
Yes. This is teaching schedule.

178
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,966
This is a lot.

179
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,927
Easy for you.

180
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,637
Yeah.

181
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,932
Your class is mostly eighth grade.

182
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,726
Homeroom. First period.

183
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,022
And every Monday, Friday is chapel.

184
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,398
-Chapel.
-Chapel.

185
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:07,486
Chapel. Everybody has to go to chapel.

186
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,569
Great.

187
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,866
If you have any questions,
you can ask Horace.

188
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:16,118
Horace is a homeroom teacher.

189
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,996
Okay. All right.

190
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,164
-Okay?
-Okay.

191
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:28,006
This is what we use to teach class.

192
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,092
Okay.

193
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:37,307
It's time to go to the class. Follow me.

194
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,456
Please. Please.

195
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,426
Kelsey.

196
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,595
This is your class.

197
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,639
-Please.
-Okay, okay.

198
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:29,026
Hello. My name is Kelsey.
Do any of you speak English?

199
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:32,863
Good. Okay.

200
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,365
I am Teacher Kelsey.

201
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,410
Teacher?

202
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,788
-Are you from America?
-Yes.

203
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,166
Are you a movie star?

204
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,168
Yes, you are so beautiful.

205
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:50,047
You look like movie star.
Like <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

206
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,759
Do you watch American movies?

207
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:56,512
Yes, <i>Fast and Furious.</i> Did you see?

208
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,013
Oh, no.

209
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:01,141
What other movies have you seen?

210
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,685
<i>-Batman.
-Mission: Impossible.</i>

211
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,730
<i>Ant-Man. Spider-Man. Chicago.</i>

212
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,940
Hey, hey, hey.

213
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,280
Okay?

214
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,699
Okay. Thank you.

215
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,913
All right.

216
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,916
One at a time, please.

217
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,793
What other movies have you seen?

218
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,299
Teacher, Trisha says...

219
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,595
there's a girl and she love a beast.

220
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:40,973
<i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

221
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,811
Other movies?

222
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,521
-<i>Lion King.
-Frozen.</i>

223
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,106
<i>-Batman.
</i>-Disney.

224
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,399
<i>Avengers.</i>

225
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,452
Excuse me.

226
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,162
Excuse me.

227
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:30,999
Can you help me?

228
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,261
Okay?

229
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:43,679
Okay.

230
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,598
Guess that's the only English word
you know.

231
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:51,144
I am not okay.
I don't know what I'm doing.

232
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:55,983
I can't go back, and I refuse
to admit one more failure, you know?

233
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,446
No, you don't know.

234
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,826
Thank God you don't understand English
because this is embarrassing.

235
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,953
-I--
-Little.

236
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,874
Okay, thanks.

237
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,134
Okay?

238
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,178
Awesome. Thanks.

239
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,505
What have I done?

240
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,458
-Teacher.
-Yes, Benny.

241
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,961
Why you're so tired?

242
00:24:21,044 --> 00:24:22,129
Cockroaches.

243
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:23,463
They fly.

244
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,217
That is unjust.

245
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:29,720
Roll call.

246
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:32,014
Please answer when I call your names.

247
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,309
You all have English names?

248
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:38,478
Our old teacher give to us,
or sometimes we pick.

249
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,564
Okay. Benny.

250
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,607
Yes.

251
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,275
-Rachel.
-Here.

252
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:44,943
-Morgan.
-Here.

253
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:45,861
Trisha.

254
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:51,575
Evan.

255
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:54,703
Evan.

256
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,959
Hey, hey, quiet down.

257
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:09,927
-What is your name?
-Calvin.

258
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,762
I don't see you on my list.

259
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:16,975
Teacher, he ninth grade,
but English so bad.

260
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,101
No, I not.

261
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,896
No, I am not.

262
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,731
What class are you supposed to be in?

263
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,945
Oh, I stay here.

264
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,863
You go to your class, Calvin.

265
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:34,910
Okay. Bye-bye.

266
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,912
-Bye.
-Bye.

267
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,043
Good morning.

268
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,215
I said, good morning.

269
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,967
Good morning.

270
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,344
Okay.

271
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,224
Thank you.

272
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:16,326
Okay, today, you are going to--

273
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:18,996
Hello?

274
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,248
Trisha.

275
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,088
Today, you are going to tell me about you.

276
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:34,798
Of course it is.

277
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,061
Sit up.

278
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:48,163
Right.

279
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:50,999
Today, we are working on I-N-G verbs.

280
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,334
Page three, please.

281
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:56,713
This is for something
that is happening now.

282
00:29:57,214 --> 00:30:00,133
I am speaking.

283
00:30:00,217 --> 00:30:02,594
You are listening.

284
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:11,103
Just look at the verbs on the page,
add I-N-G to them.

285
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:19,486
I'm boring.

286
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:25,242
Actually, Trisha, if you are boring,
then we are bored by you.

287
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:30,789
If you're bored, you're not trying.

288
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:33,041
Or maybe you should be teacher.

289
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:03,488
Don't be boring, Trisha.

290
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,828
{\an8}Kelsey.

291
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,456
Chapel.

292
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:19,940
<i>Lazarus died.</i>

293
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,119
Hey, Horace.

294
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,247
Yes, Kelsey.

295
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,000
Where can I find Wi-Fi in the apartment?

296
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:40,961
Like... Phone.

297
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,048
I don't--

298
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:46,592
Sorry.

299
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:51,889
<i>The signal is better near a window.</i>

300
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:54,391
Oh, okay. Got it.

301
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,309
Thank you.

302
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:01,982
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've kept you. You must be starving.

303
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:03,609
Go enjoy your lunch.

304
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,580
-Hey, Liz.
<i>-Hey.</i>

305
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,917
Got the Western Union money.
That's a nice chunk of change.

306
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,919
-<i>Thank you.
</i>-You're welcome.

307
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,004
I even splurged on a second-hand couch.

308
00:33:24,713 --> 00:33:27,591
And I made progress as a teacher.
I'm getting the noise level down.

309
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,177
<i>-No small feat.
</i>-Thank you. I taught I-N-G words.

310
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,263
<i>-That's called the gerund.
</i>-Whatever. And I silenced a problem child.

311
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,474
<i>A temporary victory, but I'll take it.</i>

312
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:36,892
<i>I also sat through chapel.</i>

313
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:38,727
You went to chapel?

314
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:40,562
It's compulsory.

315
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:44,191
<i>Kelsey, God did not burn you.</i>

316
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,400
<i>Braden did.</i>

317
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,946
I know. I did let it happen.

318
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:53,700
You realize how boring your middle-class,
white-girl sob-story is, right?

319
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:56,703
Okay. Tell me about your exciting life.

320
00:33:56,787 --> 00:33:59,998
<i>Oh, well, I am about
to meet my thesis professor because...</i>

321
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,710
It's a Mom thing.
I need to ask for more time on a paper.

322
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:06,505
How can he not understand your situation?

323
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:10,175
<i>Oh, because he's a guy.
He compartmentalizes everything.</i>

324
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:14,054
<i>Academics in this box,
family catastrophe in that box.</i>

325
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:16,514
No clue as to how
they would affect each other.

326
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:18,559
-Hope he's not married.
<i>-Divorced.</i>

327
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:19,851
Oh, there you go.

328
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:23,856
Mom's fine, by the way.

329
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:29,069
Liz, I'm sorry I didn't ask.

330
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,530
<i>I'll process it
when I'm ready. It's just--</i>

331
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:35,284
It's taking everything in me to get
through the day with my sanity intact.

332
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:38,745
<i>Are you still there?</i>

333
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,414
Yep.

334
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:46,545
Oh, Professor Clueless is calling.
Got to go. Love you.

335
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:21,205
You can do this.

336
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,372
I can't do this.

337
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,381
-Stupid.
-It is not.

338
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,884
I came all the way from America
to teach you.

339
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,013
What did you say?

340
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,641
Nobody care about English.

341
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,101
I'm done.

342
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:45,062
Trisha, go to the office. Now.

343
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,445
Where were we?

344
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:57,866
Things that make us happy.

345
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,496
Trisha need to be in class.

346
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,916
I need my class to be a safe, fun place.

347
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,459
No, no, no.

348
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,170
You don't understand.

349
00:36:10,254 --> 00:36:12,464
Here in Taiwan,

350
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:16,009
school is serious.

351
00:36:16,093 --> 00:36:17,886
No fun.

352
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:25,561
I think you can learn from Teacher Horace.

353
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,065
He can really teach.

354
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,055
Is it good?

355
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:42,865
I have a question.

356
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:53,417
How did you learn
to work with the students?

357
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:05,345
<i>By doing it wrong first a lot.</i>

358
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:08,807
Oh, yeah.

359
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:11,894
-You laugh.
-Sometimes.

360
00:39:14,855 --> 00:39:15,856
Learn?

361
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,649
No, everyone will see.

362
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,784
Try.

363
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:29,870
Okay.

364
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:30,954
All right.

365
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:48,597
-Good. Good. Okay.
-Okay.

366
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,057
And then:

367
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:53,477
You want me to go?

368
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,188
Okay.

369
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:57,648
Okay. Okay.

370
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,276
-The--
-Helmet. Okay.

371
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,111
-Yes.
-Right. Yeah, that's probably smart.

372
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,739
I don't know what I'm doing.

373
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,470
Well, I'm here, if you care.

374
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,030
<i>Hello.</i>

375
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:55,951
<i>Hello.</i>

376
00:42:58,161 --> 00:42:59,162
<i>Thank you.</i>

377
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:02,416
<i>Thank you.</i>

378
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:06,503
<i>Goodbye.</i>

379
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:07,838
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

380
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:08,755
Really?

381
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:54,343
Did you all get into trouble?

382
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:57,221
Yes. We are so bad.

383
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:58,805
Yes, you are.

384
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:03,977
Teacher, don't be angry.

385
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,523
-Why?
-Because I am so cute.

386
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:11,777
Teacher, you like Taiwan boy?

387
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,820
-What?
-Like our teacher.

388
00:44:13,904 --> 00:44:15,405
Yes, you and teacher.

389
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:16,573
Horace?

390
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:18,534
So cute.

391
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,869
And now we go to your wedding.

392
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:25,082
No, no, no. Horace and I are just friends.
Only work together.

393
00:44:26,959 --> 00:44:28,377
Tell them what I'm saying.

394
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:35,092
Oh, no.

395
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:47,938
Teacher, why you not have boyfriend?

396
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,731
Because mine left me.

397
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:51,525
Why?

398
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:54,528
He left me at the altar.

399
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:01,451
He thought my friend was
more beautiful than me,

400
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:03,787
so he didn't come to the wedding.

401
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,163
Ouch.

402
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,837
-Do you have pictures of your friend?
-Not anymore.

403
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,298
Yes, on the Instagram.

404
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,051
-Teacher, please.
-Please.

405
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,219
-Please.
-Please.

406
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:20,345
Please.

407
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:21,930
Okay, fine.

408
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:30,439
Oh, no. You are more beautiful.

409
00:45:30,522 --> 00:45:31,523
You think so?

410
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:32,691
-Yes.
-Yeah.

411
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:34,776
Now you can get new boyfriend.

412
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,612
Yes, Taiwan boyfriend.

413
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,696
Okay.

414
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:39,948
Thank you. That is enough. Bye-bye.

415
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,175
I am not mad.

416
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:00,677
{\an8}I just wanna know why.

417
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,349
I don't like.

418
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:07,809
But why?

419
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:12,689
Because I stupid.

420
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,442
No, you aren't.

421
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:19,446
English is hard, but you are so smart.

422
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:21,865
I will help you.

423
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:25,827
Do you have a favorite story?

424
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,038
From the Bible?

425
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:31,208
Sure.

426
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:34,336
Pick one and I will help you learn it.

427
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,549
And no more of this. Okay? It's not nice.

428
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:54,815
Yes.

429
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:58,151
-Teacher, you want to go to night market?
-What's that?

430
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:20,883
No!

431
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,259
Squid. You wanna try?

432
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:24,678
No, thank you. That's...

433
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:25,596
Teacher.

434
00:47:26,263 --> 00:47:27,306
Stinky tofu.

435
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:29,850
No, thank you, I'm good.
That smells horrible.

436
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,768
Teacher, do you like <i>boba nai cha?</i>

437
00:47:32,686 --> 00:47:33,854
I'm afraid to find out.

438
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:36,273
No, no.

439
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:39,026
Thank you.

440
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,069
I don't trust them.

441
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:43,155
No, it's sweet.

442
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,496
That is so good.

443
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:58,962
Yes. So good, teacher.

444
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:13,977
Yes!

445
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:29,826
Thank you.

446
00:48:35,207 --> 00:48:36,041
Well...

447
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,086
Bye-bye, Horace.

448
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:47,886
Horace...

449
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:52,224
Can you show me
where to find more <i>nai cha?</i>

450
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:56,520
Tomorrow?

451
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,649

452
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,403
-Okay.
-Okay.

453
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:07,614
Okay.

454
00:49:16,832 --> 00:49:17,666
Thank you.

455
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:26,758
It's okay.

456
00:49:27,634 --> 00:49:29,928
-It's good.
-Yeah.

457
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:35,642
I can't be great at everything.

458
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:39,146
This is actually hard.

459
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:47,196
So how come you don't speak English?

460
00:49:48,822 --> 00:49:50,240
You can teach.

461
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,950
Me? Teach you?

462
00:49:52,034 --> 00:49:53,660
You English teacher.

463
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,582
Only if you teach me Chinese.

464
00:50:11,303 --> 00:50:12,387
What'd he say?

465
00:50:13,222 --> 00:50:14,515
Learn Chinese.

468
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:42,584
Does anyone know what this is?

00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:45,087
-Yeah.
-A ribbon.

470
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,129
Very good.

472
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:53,637

482
00:51:44,646 --> 00:51:47,316
The things you talk about during school.

00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:48,233
Yeah.

484
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:49,776
So true.

485
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:51,945

488
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,160
So when are you gonna show me Taiwan?

489
00:51:59,703 --> 00:52:01,580
Show me Taiwan.

490
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:04,875
You ride?

491
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,628
Yeah, I'll ride.

492
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,718
-Sun Moon Lake.
-This is so beautiful.

493
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,263
Why didn't you take me here sooner?

494
00:53:24,204 --> 00:53:25,205
What?

495
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:51,857
How'd you get there?

496
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:54,401
Run?

497
00:53:54,985 --> 00:53:56,987
Okay. Ready?

498
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:03,577
Thanks.

499
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,432
You all right?

500
00:54:28,769 --> 00:54:29,603
Yes.

501
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:40,614
What are your dreams,
you know, for the future?

502
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:46,245
Dreams for the future.

503
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:51,959
Hard question.

504
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,881
The school, it's family.

505
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:02,511
But what about your family?

506
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:03,971
Parents?

507
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:07,391
No more.

508
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:14,648
You? Dreams?

509
00:55:20,571 --> 00:55:22,447
I'm leaving in a week.

510
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:27,619
I only agreed to one semester.
And I need to go home.

511
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,664
My mother and sister need me.

512
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,749
After that, no idea.

513
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,637
Family... everything.

514
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:48,640
You go...

515
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:50,851
is good.

516
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:34,937
<i>The stars are brightly shining</i>

517
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:39,566
<i>It is the night of our dear savior's birth</i>

518
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:42,778
Teacher, Rachel play for Christmas show.

519
00:56:42,861 --> 00:56:45,656
No! Nobody watch.

520
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:47,991
But we're watching you now.

521
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:51,662
You stay and be there.

522
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:53,705
-Teacher, stay!
-Stay!

523
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:54,998
Stay!

524
00:56:55,082 --> 00:56:56,583
Stay!

525
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,752
Enough. Let's get started.

526
00:57:01,588 --> 00:57:04,258
This is my last class
before I go home to America.

527
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,759
You need to be nice to me.

528
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,221
Will you come back?

529
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:13,475
Maybe one day I can come visit.

530
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,315
Do you know who Santa is?

531
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:24,611
He is so fat,
and have a beard, and bring the gift.

532
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,155
Right. On what day?

533
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,283
Christmas!

534
00:57:29,867 --> 00:57:30,742
Right, okay.

535
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:32,244
Teacher.

536
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:33,704
You bring gift for me?

537
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:37,875
The day you are brave enough
to go to 9th grade English,

538
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,918
I will bring you a milk tea.

539
00:57:42,421 --> 00:57:43,589
All right, listen up.

540
00:57:43,672 --> 00:57:49,011
Today, we are going
to write a letter to Santa.

541
00:57:49,094 --> 00:57:51,638
-Why?
-Because that's what we do in America.

542
00:57:51,722 --> 00:57:56,185
We write a letter to Santa
asking him for what we want for Christmas.

543
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:59,938
And if we're good,
he will bring them gifts.

544
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:04,610
Evan.

545
00:58:08,155 --> 00:58:08,989
Evan.

546
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:12,075
I want to draw.

547
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:14,244
Give me your book.

548
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,504
You'll get your drawing back after class.

549
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,717
Okay, write three things
you want from Santa,

550
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,720
and when you're finished,
bring them to me.

551
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:35,349
Teacher, I thought God give everything.

552
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:39,645
-Well...
-Yes, Jesus said, "Ask and he give."

553
00:58:41,271 --> 00:58:45,108
Good. I ask Jesus for iPhone.

554
00:58:46,068 --> 00:58:47,528
I don't think it works like that.

555
00:58:47,611 --> 00:58:50,614
You need to be careful what you ask for.

556
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:52,449
I asked for a husband once and...

557
00:58:55,911 --> 00:58:58,455
Just finish your Christmas lists.

558
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:02,459
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

559
00:59:04,419 --> 00:59:06,046
Hi. Thank you.

560
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,843
-Thank you. Here you go.
-Thank you.

561
00:59:10,926 --> 00:59:12,636
Okay. Hi. Thank you.

562
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:16,849
Oh, hey. Thank you. Here you go.

563
00:59:24,064 --> 00:59:27,484
Teacher, will Santa give me what I want?

564
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:30,696
Evan...

565
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,364
I...

566
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:39,037
Earthquake!

567
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:50,507
Rachel!

568
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:52,384
Go!

569
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:32,883
Stay, teacher.

570
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:36,887
Teacher, you stay?

571
01:01:54,214 --> 01:01:58,093
Okay, okay, okay.

572
01:01:58,177 --> 01:01:59,344
Too much, too much.

573
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:02,472
Enough, enough. Okay. Yes, yes.

574
01:02:07,477 --> 01:02:09,771
It's Christmas. Christmas.

575
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:13,400
So a special show for Christmas.

576
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:16,486
Rachel!

577
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:23,869
Rachel!

578
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:38,592
Aren't you gonna sing for me?

579
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,636
You have such a beautiful voice.

580
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:44,598
-<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
</i>-But too many people.

581
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:47,809
<i>-We wish you a Merry Christmas
</i>-I will be right in the front row.

582
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:50,771
<i>-And a Happy New Year
</i>-I can't play. Too scared.

583
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:54,900
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas</i>

584
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,068
Want me to come with you?

585
01:02:56,151 --> 01:03:00,322
<i>We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year</i>

586
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,615
Okay.

587
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,368
-We'll be scared together.
-Okay.

588
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:05,619
Okay.

589
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:07,538
Rachel!

590
01:03:08,705 --> 01:03:10,958
Rach--

591
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,460
Hey!

592
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:18,423
Here. Here.

593
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:28,642
<i>O holy night</i>

594
01:03:29,226 --> 01:03:34,606
<i>The stars are brightly shining</i>

595
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,526
<i>It is the night</i>

596
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:43,198
<i>Of our dear savior's birth</i>

597
01:03:45,284 --> 01:03:49,538
<i>Long lay the world</i>

598
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:55,085
<i>In sin and error pining</i>

599
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:58,130
<i>Till he appeared</i>

600
01:03:58,213 --> 01:04:03,218
<i>And the soul felt its worth</i>

601
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:09,057
<i>A thrill of hope</i>

602
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:13,478
<i>The weary world rejoices</i>

603
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:17,649
<i>For yonder breaks</i>

604
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:22,154
<i>A new and glorious morn</i>

605
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:29,119
<i>Fall on your knees</i>

606
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:33,916
<i>O hear</i>

607
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:39,213
<i>The angel voices</i>

608
01:04:39,296 --> 01:04:43,842
<i>O night</i>

609
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:47,137
<i>Divine</i>

610
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:50,474
<i>O night</i>

611
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:55,771
<i>When Christ was born</i>

612
01:04:55,854 --> 01:05:01,151
<i>O night</i>

613
01:05:01,235 --> 01:05:04,696
<i>Divine</i>

614
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:07,574
<i>O night</i>

615
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:13,455
<i>O night divine</i>

616
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:32,099
Good job.

617
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,066
<i>I show that one to Mom every day,</i>

618
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,819
so that she doesn't forget you.

619
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:47,823
<i>I'd be home if I could, you know.</i>

620
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:50,701
<i>It's a paycheck, right?</i>

621
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:52,995
Yeah.

622
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,747
<i>Give Mom a kiss for me.</i>

623
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:37,956
Hey.

624
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:49,384
You guys.

625
01:06:50,135 --> 01:06:53,180
Teacher, your sister, is she American?

626
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:58,685
Yes. I have a picture.
Yeah, that's her right there.

627
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:00,187
-Oh, this one?
-Yeah.

628
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,314
-She's so beautiful.
-Yeah.

629
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:03,774
She's smaller?

630
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,818
She is younger. I am older.

631
01:07:07,486 --> 01:07:10,155
-Yeah.
-Where is your mother?

632
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:14,117
She is in America too.

633
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,577
Where is your mother?

634
01:07:16,912 --> 01:07:18,038
She die.

635
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:20,624
I'm sorry.

636
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,628
It's okay. She's happy now.

637
01:07:25,879 --> 01:07:27,130
Do you get sad?

638
01:07:28,924 --> 01:07:33,136
Sometimes. But Jesus say it's okay.

639
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:39,685
My mom is sick, and I am scared.

640
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:44,773
It's okay, teacher. It's okay.

641
01:07:52,364 --> 01:07:55,242
How do you guys not know
what a submarine is?

642
01:07:55,325 --> 01:07:56,952
Look at the drawing.

643
01:07:57,035 --> 01:07:58,787
It's not good drawing.

644
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:03,000
-Oh, okay. That's fair.
-I draw it. What is it?

645
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,877
Not a race car.

646
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:09,590
Okay, forget it. Everyone just work
on something quietly.

647
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:11,967
And, yes, Evan, you can draw.

648
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:23,687
"Ruth. A story of encouragement
and hope."

649
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:24,770
Benny.

650
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:29,693
Oh, it's a play.
Is this why you wanted to learn?

651
01:08:29,776 --> 01:08:31,694
It's full of English drama.

652
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:32,821
I play Ruth.

653
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:34,948
I play Naomi.

654
01:08:35,032 --> 01:08:37,158
See, Trisha, I told you, you're smart.

655
01:08:37,658 --> 01:08:40,037
-And you're director.
-I what?

656
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:43,457
Every class does English drama,
and teacher directs.

657
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,209
Li Ming never tol--

658
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:48,629
Or I'll take it.

659
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:53,133
She know too much Chinese.

660
01:08:53,716 --> 01:08:55,551
She have Taiwan boyfriend.

661
01:08:55,636 --> 01:08:57,470
What? No.

662
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:58,805
I do not.

663
01:09:03,602 --> 01:09:06,354
Sorry, teacher. They want.

664
01:09:33,506 --> 01:09:34,550
What was that?

665
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:40,180
Parents say he no learn English.

666
01:09:40,264 --> 01:09:42,599
Well, yeah, all he does is draw.

667
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:45,310
They take to a new school.

668
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,187
He's leaving?

669
01:09:48,564 --> 01:09:49,898
Wait!

670
01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:53,484
This is my fault, not Evan's.
Please give me another chance.

671
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:57,364
I have been distracted, but I will
work harder with him, I promise.

672
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:06,331
See? See how well he understands?

673
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:44,077
You quiet.

674
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:46,914
Talk?

675
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:49,917
No. Just...

676
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:55,422
How does God choose parents?

677
01:10:56,131 --> 01:11:00,594
It's like he just plops a helpless baby
into the arms of a clueless teenager

678
01:11:00,677 --> 01:11:03,305
and expects those babies to turn
into responsible adults.

679
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:08,268
He obviously made good choices with yours.
You turned out all right.

680
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:23,325
<i>Sometimes I don't want to know
what you're saying, but right now I do.</i>

681
01:11:29,706 --> 01:11:31,583
These kids need to be loved.

682
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:36,338
And I want to... love.

683
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,640
But I am afraid
if I love anything too much,

684
01:11:46,723 --> 01:11:48,350
God's just gonna take it all away.

685
01:11:58,986 --> 01:12:00,863
Don't be scary.

686
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:03,031
Scared.

687
01:12:05,450 --> 01:12:07,119
Don't be scared.

688
01:12:31,226 --> 01:12:33,812
Teacher. You're with Teacher Horace?

689
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:36,773
We were just getting milk tea. Chill.

690
01:12:37,733 --> 01:12:39,193
What's mean "chill"?

691
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:41,361
Relax. Calm down.

692
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:46,200
Come on, show me what you got.

693
01:12:46,825 --> 01:12:49,161
-Go.
-Come on.

694
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:51,914
"Naomi's son married Ruth,

695
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:55,125
but then a famine came
and there was no food.

696
01:12:55,209 --> 01:13:00,047
Naomi's husband and son died,
so she and Ruth were alone."

697
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,343
My husband and son are dead.
Now I'm alone.

698
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,887
I stay with you.

699
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,722
-No, you are--
-Wait.

700
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:12,184
Hold on. First, I can't hear you.

701
01:13:12,267 --> 01:13:14,102
You need to be louder.

702
01:13:14,186 --> 01:13:16,605
And why are you just standing there?

703
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:24,238
Okay, Ruth and Naomi are leaving Moab.

704
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,990
Take a lap around the stage.

705
01:13:27,866 --> 01:13:30,077
Like, run. Circle.

706
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,495
Thank you.

707
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:33,413
I don't want look stupid.

708
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:37,501
You won't. And, Calvin, you can't bring
your script on-stage the night.

709
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:40,420
Other classes do.

710
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:43,382
They just stand there,
reading from their scripts?

711
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:45,717
Now, that is stupid.

712
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,972
Come on, you guys.
Don't you wanna blow them away?

713
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:53,141
What's mean "blow away"?

714
01:13:53,851 --> 01:13:56,937
Like what you and Rachel did
at the Christmas show.

715
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,815
Be so good that you surprise everyone.

716
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:02,150
Oh, yes. I dance?

717
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,863
No sexy dancing this time, okay?

718
01:14:07,281 --> 01:14:09,241
Come on, everyone. Let's do this.

719
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,076
Come on.

720
01:14:12,744 --> 01:14:15,789
We are going to have so much fun, we what?

721
01:14:15,873 --> 01:14:19,001
-Blow them away!
-Blow them away!

722
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,727
-<i>Hey.
</i>-Hi.

723
01:14:37,394 --> 01:14:38,562
It's been a minute.

724
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:41,106
<i>Yeah, been really busy.</i>

725
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,191
I bet.

726
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:48,906
So tonight, my students are doing
this English drama thing.

727
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:51,325
They're excited. Well, I'm excited.

728
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:56,705
Anyway, I just wanted to call
and hear how Mom's doing--

729
01:14:56,788 --> 01:15:00,167
<i>Sorry, Kelsey. Can't talk now.
I'll catch you later, okay?</i>

730
01:15:00,834 --> 01:15:01,668
<i>Bye.</i>

731
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:21,355
So Horace and I will be in the front row
cheering you on.

732
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:22,564
So pretty.

733
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:25,192
Look, teacher, everyone there. I scared.

734
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:26,777
Oh, it's okay to be scared.

735
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:27,986
Rachel, help Calvin.

736
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,404
How did we do it at Christmas?

737
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:32,366
-We go be scared together.
-Yeah.

738
01:15:33,492 --> 01:15:35,410
Okay, everyone, break a leg.

739
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:40,165
It just means "do a really good job."

740
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:42,584
And if you do, I will make you a deal.

741
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:44,378
Okay, what's deal?

742
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:48,882
If you do a really good job tonight,
I will buy all of you <i>boba nai cha.</i>

743
01:15:48,966 --> 01:15:51,593
-Yes!
-Okay? Have fun.

744
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:53,637
Yeah.

745
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:09,361
"Naomi's son married Ruth,

746
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:13,198
but then a famine came
and there was no food.

747
01:16:13,282 --> 01:16:18,287
Naomi's husband and son died,
so she and Ruth were alone."

748
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:23,500
My husband and son are dead,
now I'm alone.

749
01:16:24,251 --> 01:16:25,878
I stay with you.

750
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:29,590
No, you are young.
You'll find someone else.

751
01:16:30,632 --> 01:16:35,888
No, I stay with you.
You are my family now, okay?

752
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:38,265
"So Ruth left her home

753
01:16:38,348 --> 01:16:43,061
and went with Naomi to Bethlehem,
where Boaz lived.

754
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,898
Boaz had a big farm,

755
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:49,359
ad Ruth went to work in the fields,

756
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:52,070
so she and Naomi had food."

757
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:57,701
Whoa, dude, look! She's so beautiful.

758
01:16:58,827 --> 01:16:59,828
Will you chill?

759
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:02,831
-What's means "chill"?
-Calm down, bro.

760
01:17:04,583 --> 01:17:06,543
He's so handsome.

761
01:17:06,627 --> 01:17:08,378
And you need a husband.

762
01:17:22,017 --> 01:17:24,520
I worked so hard. I'm so tired.

763
01:17:25,103 --> 01:17:25,938
I sleep.

764
01:17:26,522 --> 01:17:27,731
Wait, wait, wait.

765
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:35,489
Here, please.

766
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:38,951
Good night.

767
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:44,748
Look, he is asleep. I make you a deal.

768
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,417
-You go sleep by his feet.
-What?

769
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:54,299
Yes, then he will know you love him. Go.

770
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:57,052
-Okay.
-Break a leg.

771
01:18:12,526 --> 01:18:14,444
God give me a wife.

772
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:19,074
I am blown away.

773
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:22,536
"So Ruth married Boaz.

774
01:18:22,619 --> 01:18:26,748
And they lived happily ever after."

775
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,618
It was so good.
Better than I could imagine.

776
01:19:03,327 --> 01:19:04,995
-Thank you.
-Okay.

777
01:19:07,206 --> 01:19:08,207
So good.

778
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:18,634
They did so well tonight, don't you think?

779
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:23,722
Are you okay?

780
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,938
This my story.

781
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:32,856
Ruth?

782
01:19:33,815 --> 01:19:35,275
My home...

783
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:36,985
far from here.

784
01:19:38,153 --> 01:19:40,656
Rachel, same village.

785
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:46,036
Father's Day, whole village celebrate.

786
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:48,705
I was get married.

787
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:52,751
I go to Taipei for a ring.

788
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:55,462
I told my father...

789
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,173
back for party.

790
01:20:08,392 --> 01:20:09,726
Only few survived.

791
01:20:13,313 --> 01:20:14,773
How did you...?

792
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:19,695
After everything...

793
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:22,990
After?

794
01:20:24,241 --> 01:20:25,742
I angry.

795
01:20:26,952 --> 01:20:27,953
Like you.

796
01:20:29,538 --> 01:20:30,372
Am I?

797
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:35,919
I guess I am.

798
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:40,924
I'm angry and hurt
over very small things compared to...

799
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:47,848
It is okay.

800
01:20:49,975 --> 01:20:53,812
It's okay to feel, Kelsey.

801
01:20:54,521 --> 01:20:56,273
There a time for everything.

802
01:20:57,733 --> 01:21:00,694
Now God give me family.

803
01:21:05,699 --> 01:21:06,533
Kelsey.

804
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:13,916
Your sister. I-- I think emergency.

805
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:22,007
Hello? Liz?

806
01:21:23,467 --> 01:21:25,594
<i>They said Mom only has a few days.</i>

807
01:21:26,428 --> 01:21:28,347
<i>I don't know what to do, Kels.</i>

808
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:31,308
Liz, I'm coming home.

809
01:22:00,462 --> 01:22:01,463
Thank you.

810
01:22:06,677 --> 01:22:07,678
Teacher.

811
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:10,806
Oh, guys.

812
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:13,976
Oh, thank you.

813
01:23:24,463 --> 01:23:25,714
Hey, Mama.

814
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,008
It's Kelsey.

815
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:54,576
Liz?

816
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:56,745
Go away.

817
01:24:25,148 --> 01:24:26,984
The options have expanded.

818
01:24:29,987 --> 01:24:32,447
Yeah. They have.

819
01:24:37,578 --> 01:24:39,496
We can't eat all that before...

820
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:43,876
Leap of faith.

821
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:51,842
What's his name? Harold?

822
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,051
Horace.

823
01:24:53,135 --> 01:24:54,511
Who gave him that name?

824
01:24:55,095 --> 01:24:57,514
No idea. Probably a Canadian.

825
01:25:00,184 --> 01:25:01,560
I told Mom about him.

826
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:06,190
-When?
-When you weren't talking to me.

827
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:09,735
I can't believe you told Mom
before you told me.

828
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:14,031
I bet she loved that.

829
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:16,283
A foreign romance.

830
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:19,077
A love with no language.

831
01:25:21,997 --> 01:25:22,831
Do you?

832
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:25,042
Love him?

833
01:25:29,463 --> 01:25:32,216
<i>To everything, there is a season.</i>

834
01:25:33,717 --> 01:25:38,347
A time to be born and a time to die.

835
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:01,870
I hope it's okay I came.

836
01:26:01,954 --> 01:26:02,955
It's fine.

837
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:06,750
She was always good to me.

838
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:08,377
She loved you.

839
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:12,256
Kels, look, I'm sorry.

840
01:26:12,923 --> 01:26:16,009
All right? I messed up.
I made a terrible mistake.

841
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:17,803
-I thought God told you--
-No.

842
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:19,888
I...

843
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:22,391
I was scared.

844
01:26:24,434 --> 01:26:25,686
But, hey,

845
01:26:26,562 --> 01:26:27,771
I'm not--

846
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,690
I'm not scared anymore.

847
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:31,775
I'm ready.

848
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:34,903
I love you. Kels, I've always loved you.

849
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:36,864
What about Ashlyn?

850
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,116
It didn't work out.

851
01:26:40,492 --> 01:26:41,660
Oh, no, Braden.

852
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:45,038
It worked out perfectly.

853
01:27:22,868 --> 01:27:24,578
-Hi.
-Teacher!

854
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:29,333
-You stay.
-Yes, I stay.

855
01:27:29,416 --> 01:27:31,126
I made you a deal, didn't I?

856
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:36,632
-Where is Calvin?
-Oh, he went back to 9th-grade English.

857
01:27:36,715 --> 01:27:39,551
-Go tell him to come get his milk tea.
-Okay.

858
01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:41,261
Where is your sister?

859
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:43,388
She is coming in a week.

860
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:56,485
Hi.

861
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:01,073
Kiss. Kiss!

862
01:28:01,156 --> 01:28:02,324
Kiss.

863
01:28:02,407 --> 01:28:04,910
Kiss. Kiss.

864
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:06,870
Kiss. Kiss.

865
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:31,311
And now you may kiss the bride.
