1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000


2
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,000


3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,063


4
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:08,964
My client is a very important businessman.

5
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:10,849
He knows what he wants.

6
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:27,327
Do you speak English?
Yes?

7
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:32,819
For I have said, young girls.

8
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:35,665
These are young girls.

9
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,041
The older they get...

10
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:42,452
The more they are used.

11
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,989
Maybe it's time that I'm doing things
elsewhere.

12
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,923
No.
It's okay.

13
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:58,453
We will soon have fresh young girls...

14
00:01:58,454 --> 00:02:00,140
From the mainland.

15
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,679
Totally good, okay?

16
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:13,891
Do you want another one?
Another drink.

17
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:37,301
If you lie to me...

18
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:39,375
I'll kill you both.

19
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:53,365
So you want a little girl?

20
00:02:56,695 --> 00:02:59,893
A virgin. 4000.

21
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:02,564
She's not back stitched right?

22
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,407
No, absolutely fresh and new.

23
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:10,345
Because I am a doctor and I can see it.

24
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:17,105
3000.
- 2000.

25
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:23,774
And I tell my friends that you like virgin girls
sells those that are not.

26
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:42,908
Take him outside.

27
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:51,061
Not you, cabbie.
Only the white man.

28
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:08,846
What do you want?
A tip right?

29
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:10,643
Fuck off.

30
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:17,182
For this month.

31
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,315
Stone.

32
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:08,467
Paper.

33
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,621
Scissors.

34
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:26,663
Rock, paper, scissors.

35
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:34,425
Isolated and difficult to reach without being noticed.

36
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,875
A perfect place for little girls to hide.

37
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,764
Here is the one that matters.

38
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:43,222
He calls himself the Duke. American clothing,
drives an American car.

39
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,007
This guy is fixated on Americans.

40
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,270
You wonder why it is so difficult to catch
.

41
00:08:47,305 --> 00:08:49,775
Than  Captain Lee is the right person for this
right?

42
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:52,133
Stable? He is part
of anything we have done so far.

43
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:55,087
What we need is hard evidence
what a lawsuit by state.

44
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:56,924
I want these pedophiles condemned.

45
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:00,105
In the eight years that I'm here,
we have 100 girls rescued.

46
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,958
25 Perpetrators arrested and 20 convicted.

47
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:05,364
The problem is hardly diminished.

48
00:09:05,991 --> 00:09:08,963
The supply of children is inexhaustible
because he always get away.

49
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,242
Angkor Wat Temple attracts tourists and
tourists bring money.

50
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,104
We need the power of their weapons behind it.

51
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:21,255
About this rig.
Are the ex military? Maybe police?

52
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:24,943
Duke has a network.
Ours must be larger.

53
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:28,388
Okay, that's it for today.
We go again tomorrow.

54
00:09:44,702 --> 00:09:47,419
Do I look like an idiot you think?

55
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,896
Because if I say...

56
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:57,136
Young virgins, I mean that.

57
00:09:57,572 --> 00:10:00,016
Two, to be exact.

58
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:03,270
For a month, real virgins.

59
00:10:03,965 --> 00:10:06,857
From five or six years old and
assured of their virginity.

60
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:13,257
Then I accept that, but the seven-year-olds have
still prefer.

61
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:19,212
They monitor the trade in underage girls.

62
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,948
Is not that your specialty?

63
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,064
You ask me for dangerous things.

64
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:29,796
I'm asking you because you deliver.
Because you have supplied.

65
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:35,299
What you are asking is very expensive.

66
00:10:35,957 --> 00:10:41,447
A real virgin once.
4000 U.S. dollars.

67
00:10:41,987 --> 00:10:44,151
Two Virgins, a month?

68
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,206
Duke, you know I'm a man of my word
.

69
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,145
Yet?

70
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,395
And you know that I am willing
to do business, right?

71
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:59,027
The deal is for two.
Freshly picked...

72
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,426
Flowers. For a month.
So we do business?

73
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:16,786
Morning.

74
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:20,763
New feature but same old hours?

75
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,245
I know I promised earlier
home.

76
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:27,167
A new team.
We owe it to the setting.

77
00:11:28,164 --> 00:11:29,851
I know.

78
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,642
I'm just happy to wake up next to you
.

79
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:40,683
It is much better than all those weeks apart
and no form of communication.

80
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,259
You know the army.

81
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:45,959
Hurray.

82
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:51,824
This is different, I promise.
- We'll see.

83
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,328
I wanted to come along with the program in the village.

84
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:02,118
I thought you volunteer
was in the shelter and not in the village.

85
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:04,822
I am an invitation.

86
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:07,376
And how did you do that?

87
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:09,136
New country, new culture.

88
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:11,902
That is good.
- Is that so?

89
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:16,579
We have four weeks even as
far unpacking boxes.

90
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,682
If you have not missed it then
did you not really necessary.

91
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:24,139
I believe so, yes.

92
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,469
You have not hung paintings.

93
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:45,175
Alex, every time I go to the
girls in the shelter, I see Abigail.

94
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:04,909
We never talk about her.

95
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:19,134
We even say her name
here.

96
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,910
I do not lose her. I miss her.
I forget her scent.

97
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:33,116
I remember the feel of her hands around my neck
.

98
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:39,422
I have no more time for her to cry
.

99
00:13:42,317 --> 00:13:44,383
And that scares me.

100
00:14:23,202 --> 00:14:25,081
Girls, Claire has brought some goodies.

101
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,632
Most of our girls come from villages.

102
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,767
Like these, very poor.

103
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:36,133
With this work, they learn how they positively
to their people to give back.

104
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,487
That's great.
- This is the house of a widow.

105
00:14:38,488 --> 00:14:39,988
A widow?

106
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,553
It's been a year with us.

107
00:14:56,554 --> 00:15:00,347
I heard her say,
maybe writing?

108
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:05,801
The next step in her recovery process
is sharing her story.

109
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,019
Want to play?

110
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,125
I can not. I got to school today
of my mother.

111
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:28,832
I get it.
My mother is a teacher.

112
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:34,217
My mother is the best teacher.
- Yeah, I know.

113
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,344
Eat your breakfast.

114
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:41,157
So you big and strong is
and grandpa can help in the shop right?

115
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:33,247
Got my red bird passing by?

116
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:38,043
Why do you have socks on your hands?
- Work Here?

117
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:41,239
I first lived in America but
when mommy got sick...

118
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,142
We came here to be with Grandpa.
- Have you seen my red bird or not?

119
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,856
I love red birds.
- I.

120
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:52,836
What is your name?
- What's wrong with you, man?

121
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,829
You know he's coming.
Go to the secret place.

122
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:02,072
Are you going home. Hurry up.
Make it your way.

123
00:17:06,131 --> 00:17:08,627
Make it your way.

124
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:45,613
Morning.
I have an appointment with Captain Sin Lei.

125
00:17:46,807 --> 00:17:48,547
He is transferred.

126
00:17:49,008 --> 00:17:52,564
I'm Captain Pakkadey.
The new captain here.

127
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,605
There is nothing about us that transfer.
I'm Alex Becker.

128
00:17:56,835 --> 00:17:59,095
Welcome, Alex Becker.
- Thank you.

129
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,952
Apologies but my Cambodian is not so good.

130
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,728
If you forgive me my English.

131
00:18:09,132 --> 00:18:14,177
Cute family.
Yes, a boy and a girl and a road.

132
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:16,634
You should be very happy that you
many children.

133
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:19,270
The karma of my family is very good.

134
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:24,660
I'm here to speak for
children who do not have a father.

135
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:29,765
Does Captain Sin Lei you informed
cooperation with our organization?

136
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,520
We are here at the invitation of your government.

137
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:35,469
We do work that no organization can do alone...

138
00:18:35,504 --> 00:18:38,003
Because it requires some exchange of information.

139
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:44,054
Our goal is every brothel in the city to close
that small children for the sex trade.

140
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:49,697
Do you know this man?
- I've seen him before.

141
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:53,783
We have investigated complaints about
its activities.

142
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:59,777
But we could find no evidence.

143
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:05,265
That you're probably getting.

144
00:19:12,925 --> 00:19:16,104
All these men are known pedophiles
from other countries.

145
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,557
We send these photos to Interpol.

146
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,674
This is about the fear exchanges...

147
00:19:23,675 --> 00:19:27,979
So that women and girls do not have to fear
to live.

148
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,838
Those who pimp
that should properly be afraid.

149
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:35,185
Supply and demand. We stop the delivery
and prosecute those questions.

150
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:41,052
I'm still your support and
of the police in this neighborhood?

151
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:47,976
There's something in your
Western thought which you do not understand.

152
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:54,899
I have many children rescued.
That itself back to the owners wanted.

153
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,965
In the Asian culture...

154
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:04,730
Is the duty of the child to
for parents to worry.

155
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:11,704
Usually these families so poor that they can not live
.

156
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,557
A child is sacrificed for the rest.

157
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:19,926
Poverty is no excuse for a child to prostitution
to surrender.

158
00:20:20,273 --> 00:20:22,525
In any culture.

159
00:20:22,526 --> 00:20:25,756
And you think that if you catch this criminal...

160
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:29,513
You can change that problem?

161
00:20:32,418 --> 00:20:35,338
In Cambodia we have a saying.

162
00:20:35,432 --> 00:20:39,478
The tiger is dependent on the forest...

163
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,698
Just like the forest depends on the tiger.

164
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,295
You Americans want a fight...

165
00:20:49,795 --> 00:20:54,352
That can not be won.
- And if this was your daughter?

166
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,575
The world takes on, Captain.

167
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:04,681
And will remember who helped and who is not.

168
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,394
Mr. Becker, you have our full cooperation.

169
00:21:10,612 --> 00:21:13,946
I'm sorry for the challenge
but this is not easy.

170
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:17,218
The more you do the right thing all the
easier it goes.

171
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,788
Hello, Miss Claire.
- Good morning, Nha.

172
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:30,064
I hoped that I could deliver my bike so
to the pedal can look...

173
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,137
It makes a clicking sound.

174
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,965
Good tours, beautiful ladies.
Very good and cheap.

175
00:21:36,465 --> 00:21:38,876
I'm sorry but we are already at
Angkor Wat before. But thanks anyway.

176
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:40,849
A dollar please.
A dollar.

177
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,146
Now get out here please.
The lady has been there before.

178
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:55,618
Maybe a new bike?

179
00:21:56,118 --> 00:22:00,456
I have very good quality bikes.
Specially made in Europe.

180
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm afraid I do not know much
bicycle off...

181
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,080
Except what color I like.

182
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:10,370
Some want to sell you crap.

183
00:22:10,826 --> 00:22:13,802
This is my granddaughter.

184
00:22:15,304 --> 00:22:19,405
I found that red scarf that you wore yesterday
very nice.

185
00:22:20,127 --> 00:22:22,369
Yes, I mean.

186
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,341
It's my mother.

187
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:31,377
So the rumors are true.

188
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,944
A new resident in your home.

189
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:48,040
Go back and stay there.

190
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:58,475
Were you working on something old man?

191
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:03,299
Nha Is everything okay?

192
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:13,080
Then I'll come back another time for
to repair or a new bike.

193
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:26,712
Grab your things again?
- What do you want?

194
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:29,917
I'll collect your debt.

195
00:23:31,249 --> 00:23:32,946
I have money for you.

196
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:38,871
Not enough to repay what you owe
.

197
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:42,616
With a girl like that...

198
00:23:45,529 --> 00:23:48,645
'd Lost a lot of debt.

199
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,156
You owe me $ 3,000 owed.

200
00:23:58,127 --> 00:24:00,671
Give me the girl and your fault
is waived.

201
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:04,757
Disappear.

202
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:24,727
It's a fair price.

203
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:44,392
There are no outstanding debts that are not collected.

204
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,801
The main part of this research
is this man...

205
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:02,699
He calls himself the Duke.

206
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:08,946
He has his work moved from Phnom Phen
to Siem Reap for tourists to use.

207
00:25:09,157 --> 00:25:14,395
And like most pimps, he fills his
brothels with young Vietnamese girls.

208
00:25:14,396 --> 00:25:17,584
The vulnerable.
In Cambodia without citizenship...

209
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,933
Without rights and poverty...

210
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:22,624
They are vulnerable targets for these traffickers.

211
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,649
I thought we were talking about girls from
Kahmai.

212
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,833
My people.
- He understands that term.

213
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:34,636
I understand enough to know when
someone hears me, but not listening.

214
00:25:38,976 --> 00:25:43,810
Do not be naive, every child is at risk.
Especially those by misunderstanding...

215
00:25:44,014 --> 00:25:49,302
Think that having sex with a virgin cures you
of the disease AIDS.

216
00:25:50,352 --> 00:25:52,564
What kind of tourists we looking for?

217
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:56,695
The average income in Cambodia is one U.S. dollar per day.

218
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:59,288
And those girls are sold into slavery
for 300 U.S. dollars.

219
00:25:59,289 --> 00:26:04,094
And then there are the pimps.
They often earn U.S. $ 4,000.

220
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:07,098
So who do you think we look?
- Foreigners.

221
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:10,533
Foreigners of all nationalities.
All shapes and sizes.

222
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,727
All backgrounds and economic living standards.

223
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:16,770
The best thing you can do is go where
trouble and keep your eyes open.

224
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:20,701
It is not long before trouble arises.

225
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:23,625
Everything you say is very good...

226
00:26:24,338 --> 00:26:29,914
But you come to our country
without our people understand.

227
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,096
Our history and our ways.

228
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,092
If an accident occurs on the streets
stop the people, out of fear...

229
00:26:40,093 --> 00:26:42,435
That they are to blame for the accident.

230
00:26:45,123 --> 00:26:46,875
Wisdom says...

231
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,608
Dangkorboom We must grow in our garden.

232
00:26:52,781 --> 00:26:57,959
Our work in Kmehr, for the same tree,
means silence.

233
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,592
To survive it is best to remain silent
.

234
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:18,633
Captain, these are pictures of
the Angkor Wat temple, right?

235
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,000
My wife and I have made
when we first visited your country.

236
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:25,720
I am proud.
I let them magnify to 8 x 10...

237
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:27,320
So that I could hang them in my office.

238
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:30,149
These temples are the pride of the people of Cambodia.

239
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,478
In fact earn your money with those photos, right?

240
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:37,091
What is the name of this tree again?

241
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,945
Dangkorboom.
- Right, the Dangkorboom. Interesting.

242
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:44,718
Same tree as you would in your garden plants...

243
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:46,446
As a symbol of silence.

244
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:52,798
Do you find it not ironic that the roots of this tree
of silence...

245
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,274
Slow the Ankor Wat temples swallow?

246
00:27:57,849 --> 00:28:01,048
Your eyes stay shut for
abuse of children for sex trade will...

247
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:04,744
Finally your culture and people swallow.

248
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,086
I believe that here very many good men...

249
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:13,238
Who no longer want to remain silent.

250
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:18,964
Do you agree with that Captain?

251
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:26,167
I stand for the group.
- May I help you?

252
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:32,376
You must understand that the girls
do not want to hear, because you are here.

253
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:36,555
Most western people take pictures
and leave nothing behind.

254
00:28:36,874 --> 00:28:40,103
I know you're not like those other
foreigners.

255
00:28:45,304 --> 00:28:49,436
Although I come from the USA...

256
00:28:50,284 --> 00:28:54,684
We all share a common grief.

257
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,072
A so deep that I almost forgot
how to cry.

258
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:08,224
When my husband in Afghanistan
stationed with our army...

259
00:29:08,893 --> 00:29:12,953
My daughter and I were home alone
in America.

260
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:19,207
And we lived in a nice neighborhood...

261
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:23,082
The kids played in the park and
went by bike to school.

262
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,435
I knew all my neighbors and they knew me.

263
00:29:26,989 --> 00:29:29,913
Life seemed very good and safe
to see.

264
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:34,745
Abigail was seven.

265
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:40,811
She loved puppies and...

266
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:44,641
Dressed like the pink.

267
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:48,537
And she drew
like princesses who walked hand in hand and...

268
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:53,297
Then she said, this is you mom.
And this is me.

269
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:00,701
On that morning I
her ready for school and...

270
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,790
I opened the front door to
her to school.

271
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:11,430
Okay, listen baby.

272
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:13,769
If you're at school and Rosie wants
some of your snacks...

273
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,709
Not give her the whole bag.

274
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:19,014
It's great that you want to share but
mom has made for you.

275
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:22,028
I'll tell you a secret.

276
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,811
Mama has an extra snack in
done for Rosie.

277
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,470
This is probably Aunt Sarah.
If you wait a minute?

278
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,039
And she was gone.

279
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,445
Like she was wiped from the earth.
She was...

280
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:04,456
And every time that I have tomorrow
repeated in my mind...

281
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:10,723
And wondered what could have
call so important that I had lost sight of.

282
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:16,497
We found her body.

283
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:20,260
In a pasture, a year later.

284
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,380
I love my little girl
more than I can ever say.

285
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:53,768
I make drawings.

286
00:31:54,444 --> 00:31:56,530
Do you want to make a drawing?

287
00:32:04,584 --> 00:32:07,191
That's all right.
He ​​is my grandfather.

288
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,709
He's very nice.

289
00:32:11,605 --> 00:32:13,825
Where did you meet this girl?

290
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:15,917
Outside the funny houses nearby.

291
00:32:22,096 --> 00:32:25,400
You can play here but behave nicely.

292
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:34,250
See, I told you he was nice.

293
00:32:47,857 --> 00:32:49,487
Hello, Sophea.
- Hello Miss Claire.

294
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:53,531
I'm here for Alex.
- Yes miss, he's in his office.

295
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,621
I know him.

296
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:08,652
I know him, I've just seen him.

297
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:11,985
That little girl is in danger.
- We stop briefly.

298
00:33:19,386 --> 00:33:24,536
Alex, I've seen that man today.
In the bike shop below our apartment.

299
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:26,359
The little girl who lives at risk
is not it?

300
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,742
This man does not know yet but we're getting close to
.

301
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:30,362
He has not escaped me.

302
00:33:30,864 --> 00:33:33,208
Is that all?
Should we not now directly behind him?

303
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,094
We are doing.
It's just not that simple.

304
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:38,575
I came to ask if you wanted lunch.

305
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:43,954
If you encounter him somewhere
is it important to you to behave normally...

306
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:46,719
He's just a man.
Tell me where and when you've seen him.

307
00:33:46,939 --> 00:33:48,959
But do not go looking for him.

308
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,222
Please, promise me.

309
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:56,403
Are you safe?
- I train here all my life for.

310
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:15,541
80 U.S. dollars, for the small to eat.

311
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:20,433
120 U.S. dollars with the other
for boom-boom.

312
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:31,632
Nervous?

313
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:34,583
It is better for the business if you
the air here lets make.

314
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:38,278
Now you know why I put them in my hotel
delivered wants.

315
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:41,066
And I'll invite some friends.

316
00:34:41,843 --> 00:34:43,369
These girls are a good start...

317
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,629
But we should have more.
Many more girls.

318
00:34:47,957 --> 00:34:51,901
Yes, more girls.

319
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:21,658
You should here have sex with them.

320
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,580
Then I know you're not lying.

321
00:35:47,472 --> 00:35:51,298
You know Duke, I can guarantee
I'm not a trafficker.

322
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:54,255
But my taxi driver, I am not sure.

323
00:35:54,546 --> 00:35:56,388
Now very sweet little girl.

324
00:36:03,586 --> 00:36:06,757
It's okay.
I will save you.

325
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:16,431
I know that taxi driver.

326
00:36:34,649 --> 00:36:38,411
Can I talk to you?
- Of course.

327
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:54,167
I was ten years old.
My little sister was five.

328
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,945
My mother died a few years earlier.

329
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:05,443
My father and brother worked all day in the fields.

330
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,143
Life was very hard.

331
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:12,815
We had little to eat.

332
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:19,584
One day, someone from our village
promise us he...

333
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,316
To a special trade would help.

334
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:29,439
Instead he sold us
to a sex trafficker.

335
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:35,636
Far away to the south.
And we never came back.

336
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:40,362
We were locked in a dark room.

337
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:45,121
We were told that we would not eat or drink
get...

338
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:49,081
Unless we learned how we could please men.

339
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:53,990
They allowed us to watch porn.

340
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:59,825
And we were forced to watch other children
...

341
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:04,068
Who have lived in this brothel than we were.

342
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:08,650
So we knew what we had to do and how.

343
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:16,514
My little sister did not survive...

344
00:38:17,873 --> 00:38:22,048
But she suffers no more.

345
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,451
I sometimes have nightmares...

346
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:32,785
I'm scared, I wake up...

347
00:38:33,623 --> 00:38:38,055
In my new house.
With my new family.

348
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:41,275
And then I know I'm safe.

349
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,537
If a bunch of flowers in a muddy riverbed...

350
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:51,779
Coming up to the surface
and be touched by sunlight.

351
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:58,709
White blossom,
we have lots of flowers.

352
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:03,297
And we have reached out to the sunlight.

353
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:08,956
Like my little sister.

354
00:39:10,814 --> 00:39:14,878
Abigail is now in a safe place.

355
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:19,218
Anyone ever tell the story of
princess Veraly?

356
00:40:19,438 --> 00:40:21,644
I love princess stories.

357
00:40:22,077 --> 00:40:26,551
Princess Veraly reigned over the country of Cambodia.

358
00:40:27,393 --> 00:40:31,319
She loved all Khmer people.
And they loved her.

359
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,971
And they lived in a large palace with towers
like this and...

360
00:40:36,006 --> 00:40:38,791
Which extended far to the sky.

361
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,968
But one day the prince came from the east...

362
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:48,584
With his army across the ocean
to our country to conquer.

363
00:40:49,058 --> 00:40:51,148
The people were very afraid.

364
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:54,567
But not the brave princess Veraly.

365
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:58,404
She stood on the highest part of her palace...

366
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,912
Grabbed her bow and arrow...

367
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,700
And with one shot...

368
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:09,398
Flew the arrow through the country
and the ship landed in front of the prince.

369
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:14,407
The prince was so impressed that he
to those brave person did search...

370
00:41:14,743 --> 00:41:16,751
His mighty army had stopped.

371
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:21,471
Princess Veraly did the dance that the story
of its people portrayed.

372
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,306
The prince had never seen anyone so beautiful...

373
00:41:25,893 --> 00:41:28,507
And he was immediately in love with her.

374
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:33,285
And when they married
fourth nationwide party.

375
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:36,238
And they lived happily ever after.

376
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,111
Thus ends every beautiful fairy tale princesses.

377
00:42:23,104 --> 00:42:27,092
Wash your face.
I need to talk to you.

378
00:42:46,822 --> 00:42:49,354
Whore.

379
00:42:54,046 --> 00:42:57,565
I let you and your friends in the village continue...

380
00:42:58,049 --> 00:42:59,906
Because you have proven your loyalty.

381
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,819
Now you will all live here
because you have deceived me.

382
00:43:06,273 --> 00:43:08,384
Please, I must return to the village.

383
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,302
I will not cheat.

384
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:19,471
Your mother needs you sold me.

385
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:22,824
I'm your only family.

386
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:27,333
I'm more than a good friend.

387
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:29,686
Imagine my disappointment...

388
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:33,731
When I found out that you have something for me
hiding.

389
00:43:34,243 --> 00:43:36,059
A little sister...

390
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:40,053
And not share.

391
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:46,532
While the whole family can thrive.

392
00:44:18,884 --> 00:44:24,279
If your mother were alive, she would
your little sister to sell me.

393
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:28,412
If you do not tell me where she is
will suffer.

394
00:44:31,694 --> 00:44:34,387
She can not hide forever
for me.

395
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:48,368
You do not hurt me.

396
00:44:49,038 --> 00:44:52,227
What man wants a girl
beat up?

397
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:55,898
My dear  You Lie...

398
00:44:57,138 --> 00:45:01,323
Watch the men actually do to you?

399
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,662
Bring them inside.

400
00:45:30,927 --> 00:45:32,933
Tell me girls...

401
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:36,372
You Lie has a little sister
who lives in the village?

402
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:50,898
Lives a child with her?

403
00:45:51,268 --> 00:45:53,080
She has a sister.
- Shut up.

404
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,525
Her name is Tuyen.
Everybody in town knows it.

405
00:45:56,575 --> 00:45:58,111
This is none of your business.

406
00:45:58,471 --> 00:46:03,262
I also know that she's friends with
the granddaughter of the bike dealer.

407
00:46:05,398 --> 00:46:07,876
She's lying.

408
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:13,470
You know it's true bitch.
You want us all suffer through your lies.

409
00:46:32,738 --> 00:46:38,447
Let this be a lesson for your entire home.

410
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:14,440
If that little girl in your house
maybe go with me?

411
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:35,737
Hello darling, what a surprise.

412
00:48:36,278 --> 00:48:39,595
No, that's my fault.
I have the whole schedule changed.

413
00:48:39,596 --> 00:48:42,595
Things went wrong, I'm sorry.
I thought you were still in bed.

414
00:48:45,443 --> 00:48:49,923
No, it is converted.
I have meetings all day.

415
00:48:50,224 --> 00:48:52,821
Are you sure you have seen them?
Are you sure?

416
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:56,773
Alex, I was not thinking.
I wanted the same.

417
00:48:56,983 --> 00:49:00,729
May Thank you
Two beers please.

418
00:49:01,342 --> 00:49:03,088
Give the kids a hug.

419
00:49:03,602 --> 00:49:05,326
I'm coming.
I have to go.

420
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,050
Okay, I love you too.

421
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:18,130
You are discovered.

422
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:20,811
I do not like a member of my team so
discovered.

423
00:49:20,812 --> 00:49:24,283
I have family in Bakh Pei.
Do you think it vellig to go?

424
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:31,200
Do you think it is safe for a while
Bakh Pei to go?

425
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,592
May, look there.

426
00:49:40,482 --> 00:49:45,566
If we do not know the number
get your drink from the band.

427
00:49:45,951 --> 00:49:49,714
I passed him when he came in and heard
his accent, he is an American.

428
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:52,008
Are there any requests?

429
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:55,353
If you want a picture with my friend?

430
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,332
Our first  raised with...

431
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:06,857
A lovable little girl.

432
00:51:52,824 --> 00:51:56,820
Sir, come hither.
This is very good.

433
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,038
Do you know where this comes from?
Do you?

434
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:08,185
These are copies of copies of copies.
This is stolen.

435
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:09,698
It is a major organized crime here.

436
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,862
Here they earn millions of dollars with
and several millions of human beings.

437
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:17,073
You stand at the bottom of the food chain
and you feed it and continue feeding.

438
00:52:17,074 --> 00:52:20,231
Do you enjoy criminals support?
Those little girls forced into sex slavery?

439
00:52:20,266 --> 00:52:24,789
'Cause you're doing.
You're part of it.

440
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:33,136
Well, fortunately we have good photos
of this man.

441
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:34,923
I send them to Interpol.

442
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:40,225
Yes, you need to gather your belongings and family and to
Bakh Pei go.

443
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,695
I'll call you on your mobile.

444
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:45,934
I appreciate your friendship.

445
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:56,427
We did well in the village.
And now here we are.

446
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:18,886
Where are you?

447
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:23,933
Military tourists always come back home.
After Abbey you never came back.

448
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:30,089
Are we therefore here?

449
00:55:31,213 --> 00:55:33,342
We are here because someone has to do it.

450
00:55:33,653 --> 00:55:37,895
The courses, skills.
- I know.

451
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:41,760
But it is pretty good if you do not always know what to do...

452
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:43,477
If you do not always have all the answers.

453
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:48,886
Even if you prefer not to talk about.
It's okay, I'll wait.

454
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,924
I do not know what you think
to wait.

455
00:55:52,295 --> 00:55:55,069
I wait until we are a family again.

456
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:58,232
I do not mean a child.

457
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:03,518
I already accepted.

458
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:07,995
I mean a family
all share together...

459
00:56:07,996 --> 00:56:09,574
The pleasure and pain.

460
00:56:09,759 --> 00:56:14,043
It is not yours to all my pain
and yours alone to bear.

461
00:56:15,394 --> 00:56:19,329
I lost her.
- What?

462
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,596
I lost her tonight.
I was not in the right place.

463
00:56:21,735 --> 00:56:23,913
On the market.
I was not fast enough.

464
00:56:24,088 --> 00:56:27,892
I had no accurate plan which worked.

465
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:33,296
I lost her.

466
00:56:41,236 --> 00:56:43,966
Another little girl.

467
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:47,746
I'm so sorry.

468
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:00,673
Who is that?

469
00:57:02,763 --> 00:57:04,308
They were my inspiration.

470
00:57:04,501 --> 00:57:08,051
Amy Nha's granddaughter and the other girl lived near

471
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:10,601
What is going on?
- I got to the office, I have a lot to do.

472
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,212
Why, what did I say?

473
00:57:12,247 --> 00:57:14,745
I have messed up.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

474
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,012
I did not volunteer for that second tour
got it done...

475
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,696
And I was in the wrong place.

476
00:57:22,591 --> 00:57:25,487
I was in the wrong place for the girl for you...

477
00:57:25,728 --> 00:57:28,578
I was in the wrong place for Abbey.

478
00:58:11,793 --> 00:58:15,336
Shantha, what is it?
What's wrong?

479
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,651
Kim-Ly, have you seen Kim-Ly?

480
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:21,117
Today in the shelter.
- She's looking.

481
00:58:28,878 --> 00:58:32,927
We go to the village work.
- I'll go with you.

482
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:42,794
We are looking for a girl from our
shelter who helped with your roof.

483
00:58:43,294 --> 00:58:45,154
Have you seen her?

484
00:58:50,897 --> 00:58:53,937
She was here looking for her mother.

485
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:57,170
The blue house in the alley.

486
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,537
Good evening.
- We are looking for our friend Kim-Ly.

487
00:59:09,136 --> 00:59:10,739
Have you seen her here?

488
00:59:26,999 --> 00:59:29,748
She cares for her family.

489
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:33,178
Is Kim-Ly returned to the brothels?

490
00:59:40,183 --> 00:59:42,464
What is it? Did something happen to her?

491
00:59:46,868 --> 00:59:51,447
If the range is small, they are worth that much.

492
00:59:52,501 --> 00:59:57,318
But when supply increases
you they are still on the market.

493
01:00:27,277 --> 01:00:30,537
As a mother being, would you be ashamed.

494
01:00:52,485 --> 01:00:54,452
Ready to go.
Come on, guys. Please.

495
01:00:55,606 --> 01:01:00,745
We focus today on the brothel Duke.

496
01:01:00,746 --> 01:01:04,766
The identity of one of our men
yesterday may have been in danger...

497
01:01:04,767 --> 01:01:07,536
Why we must now act immediately
us warrant.

498
01:01:07,571 --> 01:01:10,300
Remember, these men will be armed.

499
01:01:29,879 --> 01:01:32,815
As we speak is your captain
and a few of our men in one of the houses...

500
01:01:32,816 --> 01:01:35,458
Likely for child prostitution
is used.

501
01:01:36,477 --> 01:01:40,789
This is it.
Come on.

502
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:33,509
Go.

503
01:02:41,155 --> 01:02:44,253
Withdrawal.

504
01:02:45,146 --> 01:02:48,351
All clear.

505
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:15,246
You Sophea and stood at the front,
two agents at the rear.

506
01:03:15,247 --> 01:03:19,173
We saw him go in,
but no one saw him leave.

507
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,913
No one on the street.

508
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:31,335
The journey there.

509
01:03:31,818 --> 01:03:34,580
It is hollow.

510
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:47,625
There is good ice.
Then we go back to the hotel...

511
01:03:47,626 --> 01:03:49,857
And then we're going to clean up
because you're a dirty girl.

512
01:04:40,187 --> 01:04:42,400
You said you to all who have participated in successful missions
...

513
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:45,147
And you let go with Le
same taxi vest.

514
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:47,854
Is that your exit strategy
Booking and run away?

515
01:04:47,855 --> 01:04:50,324
The agreement was to have him...
- You're just went inside.

516
01:04:50,325 --> 01:04:53,658
They had not challenged as
if two agents in that room.

517
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:56,123
What are you trying to prove?

518
01:04:56,452 --> 01:04:58,167
I want those lines to be figured out...

519
01:04:58,168 --> 01:05:01,157
And I want a team in those neighborhoods
where he picks up the children.

520
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:02,842
We've searched the streets
and nobody knows anything.

521
01:05:02,843 --> 01:05:06,088
You do know that the time frame is very short...

522
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:08,174
Before he disappears with children
and we can not find him.

523
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:11,479
Maybe you should have asked sooner for help
.

524
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:15,177
I have a treaty with the Cambodian National Police.

525
01:05:15,178 --> 01:05:16,940
This allows me to do what I do.

526
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:19,384
And your generals oversee
on those operations.

527
01:05:19,385 --> 01:05:23,676
In your country cops fired
if they bribed for 5,000 real.

528
01:05:23,677 --> 01:05:26,345
What do you buy for 5,000 real?

529
01:05:26,346 --> 01:05:28,653
12 Eggs and some bananas?

530
01:05:28,654 --> 01:05:33,539
Information about a police raid
is surely worth more? What is it worth?

531
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,086
Thanh Le was beaten.

532
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:42,693
He is in the hospital.

533
01:05:43,938 --> 01:05:47,528
You coordinate it here.
Captain join. I have my mobile. Stay in touch.

534
01:06:37,742 --> 01:06:40,110
What happened?

535
01:06:40,926 --> 01:06:44,466
The criminals in the brothel.

536
01:06:49,268 --> 01:06:54,078
My family.
No one knows who I am or where they are.

537
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,600
This message is a warning.

538
01:07:22,822 --> 01:07:25,670
I have the police reports
read on your service.

539
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:29,946
I know about your successful raids
and then suddenly that series of failed raids.

540
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:36,219
I ask nothing you do not want to answer.

541
01:07:38,511 --> 01:07:43,823
<i> You Americans fight in a war that
can not be won. </ I>

542
01:07:45,845 --> 01:07:49,899
<i> this month. </ I>

543
01:07:50,701 --> 01:07:55,922
<i> To survive, it is best
if you keep quiet. </ i>

544
01:07:57,923 --> 01:08:00,618
<i> Whether you survive depends on me. </ i>

545
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:05,095
<i> Remember that, Captain. </ i>

546
01:08:06,379 --> 01:08:11,622
<i> And you think, if you have one criminal
packed that you can change the problem? </ i>

547
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,464
<i> The karma of my family is very good. </ i>

548
01:08:22,113 --> 01:08:24,961
Where you come from , you can not go here
get and child sexual abuse...

549
01:08:24,962 --> 01:08:27,284
And get away with it.

550
01:08:27,285 --> 01:08:31,336
Can  East meets West
and agree on that?

551
01:08:55,114 --> 01:08:59,787
Duke, am I safe?

552
01:08:59,788 --> 01:09:03,544
I arrived this morning at your premises
and swarming with police. Am I safe?

553
01:09:03,545 --> 01:09:06,322
Quiet.
There is no problem, my friend.

554
01:09:08,298 --> 01:09:12,242
I suggest my customers never disappoints.

555
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:14,834
It's good.

556
01:09:15,764 --> 01:09:18,754
I had the girl or leave.

557
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:21,008
I liked her.

558
01:09:21,009 --> 01:09:25,404
I liked her very much.
I'm not paying for it.

559
01:09:26,156 --> 01:09:28,904
This is for my disappointment and frustration.

560
01:09:28,905 --> 01:09:31,367
We will call her a free appetizer.

561
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:34,340
New agreement.

562
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:40,453
If two girls so hard,
I pay you for the right $ 30,000.

563
01:09:40,454 --> 01:09:43,728
For one month.

564
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:45,882
From a sweet, sweet flower.

565
01:09:45,883 --> 01:09:50,535
Delivered before midnight tonight at my hotel room.

566
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:55,096
They should be nice and young and they must be fresh.

567
01:09:58,508 --> 01:10:02,297
Your fresh cut flower
ready to be delivered.

568
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:19,305
You will not stop until you get to the
meeting in Phnom Phen are.

569
01:10:19,306 --> 01:10:21,720
Understood?

570
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:30,787
Thank you.

571
01:10:30,788 --> 01:10:34,277
If you hear anything, let it be
the authorities know, please.

572
01:10:37,661 --> 01:10:42,265
Wherever you are in the world,
you always meet the same people.

573
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,217
We have said nothing.

574
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:52,816
He is now very good.
Not as good as the Pucho would be.

575
01:10:53,308 --> 01:10:56,660
How much you get for the repair?

576
01:10:57,554 --> 01:11:00,067
You did so much for him.

577
01:11:00,068 --> 01:11:02,723
You must let me pay.

578
01:11:02,724 --> 01:11:06,672
Now I Pucho buy.
- Look, Grandpa.

579
01:11:06,772 --> 01:11:10,160
The Royal Palace of Princess Veraly.
Can we go there?

580
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:16,351
One day we can go.
Grandpa has much work to do.

581
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:24,341
I have an idea.
To show my appreciation to...

582
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:29,047
If you do not mind, can I take her
? I know it quite well there.

583
01:11:29,746 --> 01:11:35,006
I'd like to take her.
- Grandpa, can I join? Please?

584
01:11:42,344 --> 01:11:48,130
We find a Vietnamese man who calls himself Duke.

585
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:59,309
Do you or your family members seen this man
in the last 24 hours?

586
01:12:06,868 --> 01:12:09,913
A while ago...

587
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:17,219
20 minutes ago approximately,
I saw him and some of his men...

588
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:19,621
Girls from the neighborhood in a blue truck stop.

589
01:12:19,622 --> 01:12:22,809
Have you heard where they were going?
- Pnom Penh.

590
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:24,910
I have understood.
- We are on his trail.

591
01:12:24,911 --> 01:12:28,097
Truck to Pnom Penh rides.
Many girls back.

592
01:12:28,098 --> 01:12:31,122
Then we meet in the slum neighborhood.

593
01:13:28,211 --> 01:13:30,509
Calm down.
I'm coming.

594
01:13:42,396 --> 01:13:46,030
Princess Veraly palace must be there somewhere.

595
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:48,482
I'm sure.
- We find it.

596
01:13:57,536 --> 01:14:01,646
That's it. Can we go there?
- Is that it? Above?

597
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:06,274
Well we are going to go.
Listen, these are the rules.

598
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:11,164
Walk very slowly.
You shoot for me and I'm right behind you.

599
01:14:12,331 --> 01:14:15,600
Slow.

600
01:14:17,256 --> 01:14:19,812
Careful.

601
01:14:30,218 --> 01:14:33,056
The shawl was very nice in my dream.

602
01:14:33,057 --> 01:14:38,041
It's still beautiful.

603
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:40,892
It depends on how you look at it.

604
01:14:42,172 --> 01:14:45,013
Do you think that there is a red bird lives?

605
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:50,157
I think many birds and other animals
here to nest.

606
01:15:03,818 --> 01:15:07,230
See you there?
- Why? What is it?

607
01:15:07,231 --> 01:15:12,521
We have to be very quiet.
We do not chase the red bird.

608
01:15:22,655 --> 01:15:24,868
Alex, please take on.

609
01:15:37,231 --> 01:15:39,972
Do not hang up.
I stay on the line.

610
01:15:39,973 --> 01:15:42,835
We went to the chapel.
- In the chapel are you?

611
01:15:42,836 --> 01:15:47,116
The one you see in photos.
- You think he's alone?

612
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:52,237
Can you take a picture? Just one.
Thanks.

613
01:15:55,894 --> 01:15:58,522
One more, please.

614
01:15:58,523 --> 01:16:00,704
I do not want you at risk.

615
01:16:00,705 --> 01:16:02,895
Is there any other way than the one
where he was?

616
01:16:02,896 --> 01:16:06,696
No, we're trapped.

617
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:34,919
We will save you.
Is anyone hurt?

618
01:16:44,144 --> 01:16:46,589
Is she badly hurt?

619
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:51,229
She's not breathing.

620
01:17:16,209 --> 01:17:19,401
I know that you are here.

621
01:17:30,289 --> 01:17:33,988
Come on, sweetheart.
We have hidden long enough.

622
01:17:34,839 --> 01:17:37,539
I'm tired of your kind seen.
- Stop.

623
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:40,872
Shoot me.
The noise will attract tourists.

624
01:17:41,738 --> 01:17:44,652
Do it.
Shoot me.

625
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:47,829
Shoot me.

626
01:17:50,643 --> 01:17:53,735
Chickens squawk.

627
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:58,667
I know how that screams at
must have love.

628
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:06,045
You let chickens stop that screaming...

629
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:10,829
By his head cut off.

630
01:18:12,091 --> 01:18:14,909
Run.

631
01:18:17,351 --> 01:18:21,213
Help.

632
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:42,283
I leave my phone turned
so you can hear my conversation.

633
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:45,269
I'm at the Angkor Wat temple.
Duke, Claire and a little girl.

634
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:49,345
He is armed. I can not wait.
I'm going inside. He Claire.

635
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:01,961
Do not do anything stupid.

636
01:19:01,962 --> 01:19:04,344
You can safely escape if you do what I say.

637
01:19:07,677 --> 01:19:11,318
You're not a doctor.

638
01:19:12,086 --> 01:19:15,492
You know what I'm doing here.

639
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:20,806
Do not come any closer.
Otherwise I kill that woman and then you.

640
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:25,600
You want the girl anyway?

641
01:19:26,216 --> 01:19:28,948
She is mine.

642
01:19:30,406 --> 01:19:32,946
You know I can not let that happen.

643
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:36,008
You have no weapon.
You can not stop me.

644
01:19:36,009 --> 01:19:39,516
That's right, I have no weapons.

645
01:19:39,517 --> 01:19:43,294
But the men who work for me
now have their guns aimed at you.

646
01:19:45,649 --> 01:19:49,398
I'll prove it to you.
Stan, are you there?

647
01:19:49,399 --> 01:19:51,840
I'm ready to shoot.

648
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:58,107
Give the signal and they will shoot.

649
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:07,026
Let's see if you want to get out of here alive.
This is the plan.

650
01:20:07,027 --> 01:20:10,356
Let them go and take me.
I am your hostage.

651
01:20:12,463 --> 01:20:15,053
Let them go.

652
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:18,141
Take me.

653
01:20:36,794 --> 01:20:40,211
Kneeling.

654
01:20:42,763 --> 01:20:45,345
I look for weapons.

655
01:20:47,941 --> 01:20:52,586
It's good.
I am in the right place at the right time.

656
01:20:54,574 --> 01:20:57,193
Go here.

657
01:20:59,983 --> 01:21:04,019
White bitch, if you run too fast
I will kill you.

658
01:21:04,774 --> 01:21:07,873
Stand up slowly.

659
01:21:37,123 --> 01:21:39,761
I got you.

660
01:22:13,925 --> 01:22:16,687
I'm here now.

661
01:23:11,234 --> 01:23:14,961
TWO WEEKS LATER

662
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,786
She will miss her sister.

663
01:23:43,826 --> 01:23:46,902
We miss people we love.

664
01:23:46,903 --> 01:23:49,606
But they are always with us.

665
01:23:58,224 --> 01:24:01,115
I love you.

666
01:24:01,654 --> 01:24:05,207
I love you too.

667
01:24:23,636 --> 01:24:28,623
UNICEF TREASURE THAT WITH 1.2 MILLION CHILDREN
EACH YEAR TRADE IS DRIVEN.

668
01:24:29,997 --> 01:24:34,576
TRAFFICKING NOW IS THE FASTEST GROWING
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE WORLD.

669
01:24:38,733 --> 01:24:43,181
