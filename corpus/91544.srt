00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:18,313
I can't believe
you invited that guy.

3
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,405
He's such a bloodywanker.

4
00:01:20,516 --> 00:01:23,974
Oh, cut it out, Rolo. God!
Why are you always makin' fun of him?.

5
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:26,077
Give me a break. Sissy Brit.

6
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:28,748
Who the hell talks like that?.

7
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:32,054
- you're such ajerk, Rolo.
- you're gonna love this shit.

8
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,721
Pure Costa Rica Freaka.

9
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,025
- Ow!
- Hey, Stacy...

10
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:40,465
while I torch this baby,
how about you lick my chest?.

11
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,561
Oh.

12
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:00,819
- Hey, what about my nipples?.
- Shut up! Someone's watching us.

13
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:04,051
A peeper, huh?
Mykind ofguy.

14
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,822
- Rolo, I'm serious. It creeped me out.
- All right, all right.

15
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,989
I know a place more private...

16
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,364
- and romantic.
- Oh.

17
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:16,199
Ow!

18
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:20,166
Check it out.

19
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:24,678
- What do you think?.
- Ooh!

20
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,078
Should we be doin' this here?.

21
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:30,310
I mean, isn't this, like,
sacred or something?.

22
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,887
What?. No, they're dead.

23
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:37,084
you got any objections, Ricky?.

24
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:42,186
I think you should give it to her, senor.

25
00:02:44,967 --> 00:02:47,697
There he is again.

26
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:51,569
This guy's gonna be
picking his teeth out of my dump.

27
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:06,515
Stacy, this guy doesn't even have teeth.

28
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:14,352
Watch the hair, asshole!

29
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:17,261
Goddamn monkeys.

30
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:23,971
Oh, my God!

31
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:27,736
Who needs a love potion?.
I whipped up something extra tasty.

32
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,367
Ow!

33
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:31,946
So, where are we gonna do this?.

34
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,481
I don't wanna get caught
in the middle of a cemetery.

35
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:41,979
Let's at least go inside
that old mausoleum.

36
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:44,150
Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:48,997 --> 00:03:50,988
Wow.

38
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,091
- Wow.
- Check this out.

39
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:05,771
Oh. Looks like
we don't need you anymore.

40
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:18,252
What the-

41
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,528
It was probablyjust the wind.

42
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:26,667
Okay, we're back in.

43
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,828
Whoo!

44
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,963
Heads or tails?.

45
00:04:32,074 --> 00:04:35,771
- Mmm... heads.
- Oh!

46
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:41,782
- What's "tails"?.
- you don't wanna know.

47
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,951
What is it?. Too waxy?.

48
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,688
Shh. I heard something.

49
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:57,732
Was it, um,
a strange sucking sound?.

50
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,824
Oh!

51
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:05,464
Say, what do you think about smacking
me in the face a couple oftimes?.

52
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:08,065
Not hard.
Well, kinda hard.

53
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,008
What do you say?

54
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:13,843
- No.
- Oh, come on.

55
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,917
- No!
- Oh, come on, Kelly.

56
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:18,543
- It's not like I'm asking you to eat my crap.
- No!

57
00:05:18,654 --> 00:05:22,249
Just slug me.

58
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,137
- Over here!
- No, this way!

59
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:04,115
All right. Here we go.

60
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:26,304
Welcome to Pleasure Island!
I'm your host, Coconut Pete.

61
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:30,215
Put your bags down and meet me
at the pool for a nice drink.

62
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,685
Are you ready
for the ti me of your life?.

63
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,693
Yeah, fiesta time!
Are you ready to party?

64
00:07:42,264 --> 00:07:45,028
- !Buenos dias! Lars Brunckhorst.
- Right this way, my friend.

65
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:48,296
- Welcome to the island. Please,
keep walking. - Listen, I-

66
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:52,339
Are you ready to party?
Come on, now!

67
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:54,739
Party!
Who'd like to party?.

68
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,476
- Hey, Lars Brunckhorst.
- Time to party. Welcome to the party.

69
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:05,918
- Lars Brunckhorst.

70
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,251
- Follow the officer. Follow the officer.

71
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:12,191
Whoo-hoo! Welcome
to Coconut Pete's Pleasure Island!

72
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:15,024
Now, you are here to have fun.

73
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,724
If you choose not to have fun,
fun will be provided for you.

74
00:08:19,634 --> 00:08:23,434
Whoo-hoo!

75
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:26,166
All right, let's go have some fun
now, huh?. Bring it down. Bring it down.

76
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:29,334
- Left, right! Left, right!
- Hey, General. Lars Brunckhorst. Listen-

77
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:32,436
- Nice fuckin' hat, pussy!
- Hey, you got that bag of grass I loaned you?.

78
00:08:32,547 --> 00:08:35,710
Ooh, sorry. you know how it is.

79
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:37,785
Let me know
when you score some more.

80
00:08:37,886 --> 00:08:40,616
Ooh!

81
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:49,459
Hey, you. I'm sorry I'm late.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

82
00:08:49,564 --> 00:08:52,590
Yeah, all right. Go on.

83
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,364
Who wants drinks?
Drinks, drinks, drinks.

84
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:59,497
- Yeah, I like that!
- Bring it on!

85
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:06,146
Hey, Dave. Hey, Carlos.

86
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:09,911
- Hola, Kelly. - Think you could put a
little something ex-tra in my drinks?.

87
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:12,145
I know ex-actly what you need.

88
00:09:12,254 --> 00:09:15,052
There you go.

89
00:09:15,157 --> 00:09:18,888
If anyone else is eager
to share the ex-perience...

90
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:21,155
I'll be around this e-vening...

91
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:24,426
- and we'll be ex-pecting them.
- Okay, okay, okay. I get it.

92
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,592
Put it on my tab.

93
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:29,226
- Hey, at least give me one ofthose margaritas.
- Sorry.

94
00:09:29,337 --> 00:09:32,465
They're so spoken for.

95
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,847
We're gonna go for a quick romp
in the jungle before the pool party.

96
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:42,143
Oh, I don't know, Stace.

97
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,946
I have to play tennis soon,
and, well, to be honest...

98
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:48,921
that stretch ofthe jungle gives me an
extraordinary case ofthe wonky britches.

99
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:51,686
SweetJesus,
you're an F-cake, Putman.

100
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:53,784
What the hell?.

101
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:56,261
you were just telling me
what a nut-cup this guy is.

102
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:58,924
I didnot!

103
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,161
Ladies andgentlemen, boys andgirls...

104
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,431
- your host and rock and roll's
favorite son...

105
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,507
Coconut Pete!

106
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:12,541
Welcome to Pleasure Island!

107
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,775
Whoo-hoo!

108
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:32,697
I love you, Coconut Pete!

109
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,770
Oh! Wel I, I guess
you all heard this one, huh?.

110
00:10:38,473 --> 00:10:42,341
Back you go, dickweed!

111
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:45,413
I guess you also know
that I took this song and turned it...

112
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,642
into a beautiful reality.

113
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,686
- This gorgeous group of people
behind me is our staff.

114
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:56,655
And they're here to take care of you
in more ways than one!

115
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,390
Now, you came here to
escape civilization...

116
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:03,487
and we're gonna hold you to it.

117
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:06,066
your cell phones won't work here.
There are no fax machines...

118
00:11:06,168 --> 00:11:09,660
and most importantly of all,
no strings attached!

119
00:11:16,378 --> 00:11:20,246
Coconut Pete, you're under arrest!

120
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,441
What are the charges, officer?.

121
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,679
For keeping these people from enjoying
free drinks at the pool from noon to 3:.00!

122
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:28,950
That would be a crime!

123
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:31,924
Well, you heard the man.
Free drinks at the pool!

124
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,995
Last one in
is a rotten coconut!

125
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,662
Are you all right?.

126
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:19,763
Yeah. That thing just scared me a little.

127
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:23,002
It's just Welkie, the Welcome Gorilla.

128
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,740
These two idiots were trying to hump him,
so I thought I'd stash him out here.

129
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,112
- I'm Jenny.
- I'm Penelope.

130
00:12:29,217 --> 00:12:31,185
I'm a little lost.

131
00:12:31,286 --> 00:12:34,585
you look familiar.
Have you ever been here before?.

132
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:36,953
Oh, yeah. Um, well, no.

133
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:39,618
Huh.
So where are you from?.

134
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:42,925
- Uh, Nome, Alaska?.
- Hmm.

135
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,693
I guess you just have
one ofthose faces.

136
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,928
- Just take a right up there
to get to the big path.

137
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,835
But you better hurry.
you'll miss the drinks by the pool.

138
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,008
Oh, Manny,
look at the chassis on this one.

139
00:12:58,113 --> 00:13:00,104
Oh, dude.
Wanna get nailed?.

140
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:02,342
Hot dudes lookin'
for some ganderjuice.

141
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,645
Yeah!

142
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:08,189
- Okay, maybe later. Yeah.
- I'll get back to you.

143
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,350
Oh, dude, look at that one, dude.
Green bikini? Oh, dude.

144
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,450
- Look at that little cheetah.
- Hair pie.

145
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,406
- Jackie O'Tripod.
- Dude, what-

146
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:28,169
Oh, dude, check out that
orange bikini, dude.

147
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:30,642
Oh, dude, come on.

148
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:32,906
Do you want to be drilled by Manny?.

149
00:13:33,014 --> 00:13:35,346
Bogey. Bogey.

150
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,475
- 12:00 noon.
- Holy shit, dude.

151
00:13:37,585 --> 00:13:41,180
I know that chick.
That's the chick on that TVshow-

152
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,383
- A.M. Pump Up WithAmyAerobics.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

153
00:13:44,492 --> 00:13:46,221
She's the one in the way back.

154
00:13:46,328 --> 00:13:48,728
Dude, she was. But then the chick
by the palm tree died...

155
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,731
so she got promoted to palm tree.

156
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,994
And then Amy Aerobics died, and so
she's the new number one chick, dude.

157
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:57,230
- She's the new Amy Aerobics!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Amy Aerobics died?.

158
00:13:57,339 --> 00:14:00,934
- What did she die of?.
- She didn't die of a fat ass, I'll tell you that, bro.

159
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:06,272
What's up?.
Dude, don't be gay, man.

160
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,372
- I don't think so.
- Hi.

161
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,610
Oh! Whoo! Hey.

162
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,620
- Lars Brunckhorst. I'm the new masseur.
- Hi.

163
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,690
- I'm Jenny.
- Really nice to meet you, Jenny.

164
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,022
- And this is Yu.
- And really nice to meet you, Yu.

165
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:22,562
So you're subbing in for Inga this week?.

166
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,132
- Yeah.
- Well, you'd better be good.

167
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:27,929
Inga had some great moves.
Let's see what you got.

168
00:14:28,036 --> 00:14:29,833
Ooh.

169
00:14:36,878 --> 00:14:40,814
Oh, God.
Inga never did anything like that.

170
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,110
- Who's the fucking hippie?.
- I'll take that.

171
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,209
Hey, get your own margy.

172
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,121
- It's not for me. It's for our new masseur, Lars.
- Are youserious?

173
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:52,887
We swapped out a six-foot
Swedish broad for this guy?.

174
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,962
- I'm six-one.
- Cool!

175
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:57,293
Oh, don't worryabout him.

176
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,664
He's Coconut Pete's nephew, so he
thinks he can get awaywith murder.

177
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,964
At least assault
with a deadlywet one.

178
00:15:03,071 --> 00:15:05,301
- Who wants to limbo?.
- Limbo! Limbo!

179
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:13,673
I'll show you the ropes
at the club tonight.

180
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:16,979
Look for me.
I'll be the cute chick behind the bar.

181
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,921
Attention: Frankie back to Hollywood!

182
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:23,684
- Dude, whatever.
- Dude, this is you! This is you!

183
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:30,589
- Bend it, don't break it.
- I'll bend anything. I'm gettin' so fuckin'laid tonight.

184
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:54,221
Yeah, drink, sugar! Chug it down!

185
00:15:54,322 --> 00:15:56,347
Chug it down for me!

186
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,619
Hey, what's up there,
you foxes and cockses?

187
00:15:58,726 --> 00:16:01,456
Here comes Coconut Pete!

188
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,961
Hey, am i go. you m ust be Lars.

189
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:12,403
Coconut Pete. Hey, man, I really appreciate
you bringing me into your life circle.

190
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,203
Pleasure's all mine. Say, I hear
good things about your fingers.

191
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:19,174
Is that a tranquillity blouse?.

192
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,805
Yeah, it is. It's actuallythe same one
you wore on your album cover.

193
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:24,908
"Pink Crustaceans and Good Vibrations"?.

194
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:27,010
I read a 1977 interview
where you said that...

195
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:29,589
the teal and blue really kept
you focused during the tough times.

196
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:32,888
That sounds like something
I said back in '77.

197
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:34,985
I guess nobody told you, but, uh...

198
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:37,428
you're supposed to wear
the Pleasure Sweater on luge duty.

199
00:16:37,532 --> 00:16:40,330
Oh, yeah, they did, but it's actually
kind ofhot in here...

200
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,403
and it was kind of
wadded up on the ground-

201
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,667
Just put the goddamn thing on.
Hank, give Lars a hand, will ya?.

202
00:16:45,773 --> 00:16:47,798
Oh, yeah.

203
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:54,108
- Thanks, Hank.
- Hey, Coco Pete, I have a present for you, my friend.

204
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:57,776
- you see the beautiful flower in theyellow dress?.
- Mmm!

205
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:00,013
She's in full bloom.

206
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:03,750
She said she saw you in Tucson
three years ago, 14th row.

207
00:17:08,463 --> 00:17:12,365
Excuse me, but weren't you
at one of my shows?.

208
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,901
U of A, '99?.

209
00:17:15,003 --> 00:17:17,233
- Yeah!
- I remember you! you were in the-

210
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,035
Don't tell me- 15th row.

211
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:25,943
- Fourteenth row!
- I have a pictographic memory for pretty faces.

212
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,107
Well, hey, how about the grand tour?.

213
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:32,118
- Yeah, sure.
- Right this way.

214
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:38,124
Hey, buddy!

215
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:41,286
Ah,Jesus Christ!
That's tequila!

216
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:45,093
I was doubles partners
with Andre Agassi for an entire week.

217
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:48,134
I'm the one who taught 'Dre
to play Cocks and Quarters.

218
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:52,332
If you can believe it,
he'd never played Cocks and Quarters.

219
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,102
Wow. That's interesting.

220
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,336
- Yeah, it's- Well, it's-
- Hey, snow bunny!

221
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:59,640
- Give me a Drambuie, neat.
- you got it.

222
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:04,241
Well, all alone, huh?. Well, don't worry.
"No woman, no cry," right, mon?.

223
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:08,015
Actually, I was quite engaged
until you bullied yourway in here.

224
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:10,989
Yeah, I heard you. Something about, uh,
Cocks and Quarters?.

225
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,493
you know, we have that game in the States
too, except we call it Hide the Sausage.

226
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:18,430
I beg your pardon?. Excuse me,
new fellow, please cut offthis minor.

227
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,366
Oh, come on! Ifthere's grass
on the field, then play ball.

228
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:24,438
Right, guv'nor?.
Hey, Sammy, hit me!

229
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:30,707
Mmm!
Gracias, Sheriff.

230
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:32,871
Legalize it!

231
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:38,283
Hey, late night fun
at the campfire in one hour.

232
00:18:38,386 --> 00:18:41,651
- And don't forget your condoms.
- Tequila! Who wants some?

233
00:18:41,756 --> 00:18:44,782
Hey, what, are you dancing alone?.
Hey, sweetie. Come here.

234
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,621
Hi!

235
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:50,994
Whoo! I now pronounce you
Mr. and Mrs. Funzy!

236
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,533
you owe me one, bro.

237
00:18:53,635 --> 00:18:56,570
Uh, may I kiss the bride?.

238
00:18:56,671 --> 00:19:00,038
- Um... do you work here?.
- I do.

239
00:19:00,141 --> 00:19:03,838
I'm Juan Castillo.
I am dive master.

240
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:06,209
Like, cliffs, or-or-

241
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:11,013
Cliffs, rocks, boards.
Whatever you wish.

242
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,146
Oh, that is a beautiful name.
"Peenalop. "

243
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:18,817
Peenalop.
It's breathtaking.

244
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:21,986
Um, thank you.

245
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:26,226
So, tell me, what brings you
here to us, Peenalop?.

246
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:30,361
Oh, oh. I'm on spring break.
I go to Oral Roberts.

247
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:34,430
Oral Roberts?.
Is that anything like an Anal Johnson?.

248
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,170
'Cause, well,
I've done that a few times.

249
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:42,443
Or am I thinking ofa Dirty Sanchez?.
That's the one.

250
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,283
- I don't know what that is.
- Uh... it's not for you.

251
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:50,687
- Oh, my God!
- Ah,yes.

252
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:52,953
A very magical place.

253
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,246
- Hey.
- Hey, Carlos.

254
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,974
Make it quick.
We got a lot of dishes.

255
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,757
Goddamn monkeys.

256
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:18,038
you?.

257
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:21,946
Carlos, these knives are filthy.
When are you gonna clean 'em?.

258
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,983
Manana.

259
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,047
One, two! One, two, three, four!

260
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:26,203
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

261
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:29,615
- All right!
- Solid.

262
00:22:29,717 --> 00:22:31,878
Play "Margaritaville. "

263
00:22:35,656 --> 00:22:37,453
Excuse me?.

264
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:41,392
Play "Margaritaville. "
I love that song.

265
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:45,056
Darlin', I think you're referrin'
to my song "Pina Coladaburg. "

266
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,862
No, "Margaritaville. '"

267
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:53,530
I think you mean "Pina Coladaburg. "

268
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:56,940
A little song I wrote
seven and a halffucking years...

269
00:22:57,044 --> 00:22:59,911
before "Margaritaville"
was even on the map!

270
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:03,245
Of course,
you wouldn't know that 'cause...

271
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:05,319
you weren't even born yet!

272
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,410
Come on, hog shell. Let's get us a drink.

273
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,489
- I don't need this shit.
- Come on, man.

274
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,615
Fuck that guy!
Son of a son of a bitch!

275
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:15,127
Mothermotherfucker!

276
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:18,164
Hey,Jenny.

277
00:23:20,568 --> 00:23:23,401
- God!
- Sorry.

278
00:23:23,504 --> 00:23:25,597
Give me a heads-up
before you do that.

279
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:29,142
It's just a habit. I could see
how tight you were from a mile away.

280
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,302
What can I say?.
Some girls are just tighter than others.

281
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,447
Sorry.

282
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,680
Uh- So, uh, I guess
I'm talkin' to a celebrity.

283
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:42,449
Congratulations.
I heard you got your own fitness show?.

284
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:46,822
Uh, yeah. Amy Aerobics
accidentally ate some rat poison.

285
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:49,123
It was awful.

286
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,597
But I'm still really psyched.
I've been waiting a long time for this.

287
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,066
- That's great.
- Hey,Jen.

288
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,634
I will be glad to never
have to do this again.

289
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,708
Yeah, it must be tough
living in paradise.

290
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,334
Oh, yeah.
you love it now, butjustwait.

291
00:24:10,651 --> 00:24:14,018
Hey, you guys ever hear the story
ofthe Machete Maniac?.

292
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,487
Ooh!

293
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,490
Let's hear it.

294
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:21,527
Yeah, I don't know.
It's probably too scary for you guys.

295
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,827
- No. No, it's not.
- No, come on, Dave. Please, tell us the story.

296
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:28,731
All right, what the hell.

297
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,669
This must've been, like,
15 years ago, you know?.

298
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:35,230
We had a kid working at the club
named Phil Coletti.

299
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:39,575
And one night-
it was a night a lot like tonight-

300
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,241
this gorgeous woman comes into the club,
asks him ifhe wants to go out to thejungle.

301
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,649
He's like, "Yeah. Whynot?'"

302
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:49,314
So they split. And as they started
getting out to the jungle...

303
00:24:49,423 --> 00:24:53,052
further and further away
from the lights ofthe club...

304
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,390
she starts asking him
these questions, like...

305
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:59,330
does he believe
in the local legends ofthe island...

306
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,924
voodoo, zombies.

307
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:05,597
He's not too worriedabout it.

308
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:07,731
Hejust rolls right over,
starts putting the screws to her.

309
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:12,211
But something doesn't
feel right to Coletti.

310
00:25:12,313 --> 00:25:16,249
But he can't see shit. It's pitch black,
so he just keeps bangin' away.

311
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,545
But then, boom!

312
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:23,282
A flash oflightning lights up the
whole island, and in that one moment...

313
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:28,192
Coletti looks around and sees not only is he
out in the middle ofthat old Mayan cemetery...

314
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:32,527
not only are all the other guys from
the resort standing around watching him...

315
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:35,864
but he sees that
he's having sex with a corpse.

316
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,798
A cold, white...

317
00:25:39,907 --> 00:25:43,570
dirty-from-the-grave dead body.

318
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:46,441
And they say...

319
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:50,278
Phil Coletti calmly walked
to the groundskeeper's shack...

320
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,215
founda machete...

321
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,948
and chopped those staff members
into a hundred pieces.

322
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,885
And they say
he took that same machete...

323
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:05,227
chopped his own dick off
and ran screaming into the jungle.

324
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:08,665
Nobody ever saw him after that.

325
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,896
But from that point on...

326
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:14,497
Phil Coletti was forever known...

327
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:17,133
as Machete Phil.

328
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:21,738
Are you telling me there's some totally
deranged, dickless dude running around out there?

329
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,649
All I'm saying is I don't
go into the jungle alone if I can help it.

330
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:29,280
'Cause you can hear him,
and I've heard him...

331
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,188
crying out...

332
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:36,320
"Where's my penis?.

333
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,299
Where's my penis?.
Where's my penis?'

334
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,996
And that boywas me!

335
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:58,581
you're an asshole,
Putman.

336
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,451
- Anybody get laid tonight?.
- Hey, Pete.

337
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:05,787
I know I did.

338
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,157
Say, anybody seen
Rolo, Stacy or Kelly?.

339
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:10,389
They're probably off screwing around
in the jungle somewhere.

340
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:13,524
Well, shit. I'm gonna needsomebody
to run Luau Night tomorrow.

341
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,200
Uh, yeah, sure.
I'll run Luau Night.

342
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:19,864
What, cut up a couple
of pineapples, whatever.

343
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:22,738
- Yeah, great. Sam, will you run Luau Night?.
- Sure. Can do.

344
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:25,744
We'llgetsome grass mini-skirts,
maybe have a poi-eating contest...

345
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:28,144
and, uh, everyone'll get laid.

346
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:31,343
Sounds great. People, please.

347
00:27:31,452 --> 00:27:34,250
Is it too much to ask?.
Have sex with the guests.

348
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:36,915
Some of'em aren't bad-looking.

349
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:48,164
Hola, Peenalop!

350
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:20,657
Change!

351
00:29:28,902 --> 00:29:32,303
- All right, 200 points. 200 points.
- Oh, good Christ!

352
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:35,136
Oh, you're dead, fucker!
you littleyellow prick!

353
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:38,370
you're fucked!

354
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,140
- Ohh!
- 500 points!

355
00:29:40,247 --> 00:29:44,547
- Fuckin' worked!
- A simple tag would have sufficed.

356
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:47,485
Eat it, fuck-nut!

357
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:50,716
Cue Pretzel.

358
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:52,815
Where's Pretzel?.

359
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:57,022
Come on. Cue Pretzel.
Cue Pretzel. Pretzel- Ah.

360
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,129
Pretzel!

361
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:04,796
Hey, Pretzel!
Get your twisted, salty ass out here.

362
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:08,272
Hey!

363
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:15,908
Ocupado, bro. Go!

364
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:25,557
Sorry, Cliff.
I need you in the maze.

365
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:29,720
- I'm on break.
- Be happy in yourwork, Pear.

366
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,492
Shit.

367
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:38,194
Eh, yeah.
Hey, look, I salty, yeah?.

368
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:41,433
- Wait. What's your name?.
- Listen, mami, I call you later, all right?.

369
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:44,739
Bye.

370
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:12,639
Shit!

371
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,471
I got you!

372
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:32,215
Whoa!

373
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,576
Huh?.

374
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,940
Hello?.

375
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:42,259
Hello?.

376
00:32:58,846 --> 00:33:00,837
- Lars?
- Huh?.

377
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:05,009
Oh. Sorry.
I was just in the middle of my Qi Kung.

378
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:07,382
Wow. Qi Kung?.

379
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:10,719
- Whoa!
- I should have you on my show.

380
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:13,486
- I guess you're not just into
massage, are you?. - Yeah, well-

381
00:33:13,594 --> 00:33:17,155
I mean, bodywork's still my life,
but I've also done the Dianetic thing.

382
00:33:17,264 --> 00:33:18,993
Spent a little time in the Forum.

383
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,897
Did a little Falun Gong in Bang Chow.

384
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:24,232
- But you knowwho's got a great philosophy?.
- Who?.

385
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:26,499
Coconut Pete.

386
00:33:26,607 --> 00:33:28,507
Have a good time all the time.

387
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:30,907
- Always eat the worm.
- Totally.

388
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,777
- Sign ourasses!Sign ourasses!
- Sign ourasses!

389
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:37,578
- What do you know about Feng Chi?
- Um, nothing.

390
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:42,782
Snoring Panda.

391
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,518
Not to be confused
with Linou Gano...

392
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,423
- the Leaking Turtle.
- Oh, my God!

393
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:50,258
- Don't try that in public.
- Dude!

394
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,355
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
send you back over there.

395
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,594
- you'll get plenty of signatures, all right?.
- Come on, hop.

396
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,227
Go ahead.

397
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,397
- Come on, hop!
- That's amazing.

398
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:02,634
It's all really about
connecting your meridians.

399
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:05,644
We all have energy that flows through
us, and it's all connected by buttons.

400
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:08,237
So, what other buttons
can you push?.

401
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:10,782
Tian-Tu.

402
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:14,376
The Heaven Point.

403
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:18,652
Fuck me!

404
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:21,956
Damn!

405
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,394
Maybe I should
take you home with me.

406
00:34:24,498 --> 00:34:28,298
I don't know if
I'd fit in your luggage. Oh, shit!

407
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:31,803
What the-
Oh, my God!

408
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:34,100
- Carlos?.
- What's he doin' up in the air?.

409
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:36,573
- It's gonna be okay, dude.
- I'm not getting a pulse.

410
00:34:39,046 --> 00:34:41,412
"Naughty Carlos'"?

411
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:46,409
Who's driving the boat?

412
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:50,079
you reallyneverplayed
this game as a kid?

413
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,183
We had a cheap
Nicaraguan version called Circle Eater.

414
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:57,821
But, you know-

415
00:34:57,931 --> 00:35:01,094
Are you trying to tell us something, boy?.
Is Timmy trapped in a well?.

416
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:03,328
Come on!

417
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:06,133
- you must come quick!
- Follow the banana!

418
00:35:09,643 --> 00:35:12,612
Oh!

419
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:15,841
Oh, man!

420
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:17,780
Cliff!.

421
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,715
Oh!

422
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:31,122
Who would do something like this?

423
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:33,722
I mean, who the fuck would wanna
come here and do something like this?.

424
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:37,793
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on. Settle down, now.

425
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:40,873
- you're makin' a scene.
- There's a bloody killer on the island.

426
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:45,377
I know who it is. It's Machete Phil,
come out from the jungle.

427
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,845
Cool it,Juanny. you know that's
just a bullshit story for the guests.

428
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:50,712
Hey, it looks like
everybody else is okay.

429
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:53,809
But you gotta see what
someone did to my activities board.

430
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,650
Oh, my God!

431
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:08,264
"Do yourjobs and live.

432
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,598
Tell the guests and die'"?

433
00:36:10,704 --> 00:36:12,763
"Cause everybody's looking
to find their own paradise. "'

434
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,569
What the hell does that mean?

435
00:36:15,676 --> 00:36:19,442
- We have to get off the island.
- We have to get everyone off the island.

436
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:42,661
Ahh! Okay.

437
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:46,603
Okay, the radio's smashed,
and we got no boats.

438
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:49,642
- No boats?.
- How could somebody steal both boats?.

439
00:36:49,743 --> 00:36:51,734
I don't know. I-
I mean, the Smilin' Smuggler...

440
00:36:51,845 --> 00:36:54,109
looked like it was
just driving around on its own.

441
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,478
- What?. On its own?.
- And that phone line had definitely been cut?.

442
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:58,778
It sure as shit was not
chewed up byjungle rats.

443
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:02,480
- We have jungle rats?.
- Okay, what are we gonna tell the guests?.

444
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:04,614
- Nothing. I mean, you saw the board.
- He's right.

445
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:07,751
We tell the guests there's some crazed
maniac on the island with no way off?.

446
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,557
We're gonna have a hundred
crazed maniacs running around.

447
00:37:10,664 --> 00:37:13,633
What about the sign on Cliff?.
I mean, it clearly said, "staff only. "

448
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:15,725
I mean, that means
he's targeting us.

449
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:18,304
I don't understand.

450
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:20,839
Why are they coming after us?.

451
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:30,072
Ahhh.

452
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:34,415
When you're all done with your little
pink panty meltdown let me know...

453
00:37:34,521 --> 00:37:36,682
'cause I'd like to
get down to business.

454
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:41,250
I thought it was time
to bring in the pro.

455
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:43,659
- Hank?.
- Yes, Hank.

456
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:46,858
- The head ofsecurity on all my tours.
- So, what?

457
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:49,868
He keeps aginghippies from stealing
the bong out of yourtourbus?

458
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,632
It just so happens
Hank used to be a federal agent.

459
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:56,971
Yeah, that's right. Headed
an F.B.I. task force on serial killers.

460
00:37:57,077 --> 00:38:00,308
Single-handedly caught
the Minneapolis Mangler.

461
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,780
- Who's the Minneapolis Mangler?.
- Exactly.

462
00:38:03,884 --> 00:38:06,682
Pete, youare aware that
Ipersonallyhave served this guy...

463
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:09,551
twenty beers a day
for the last 10 years, right?.

464
00:38:09,656 --> 00:38:11,851
Hey, I was in Nicaragua, junior!

465
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,449
When you can stuff
yourintestines back in yourpockets...

466
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:16,552
and walk 20 klicks to an aid station...

467
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:20,292
after a knife fight with guerrilla
drug lords, then you talk to me.

468
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,968
All right, since there's
no way offthis rock...

469
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:28,632
- we're gonna have to catch this guy.
- Catch him?

470
00:38:28,742 --> 00:38:32,041
We couldn't even catch the bloody raccoon
that was stealing mywristbands last month.

471
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,706
you didn't ask me to catch
the raccoon, did you, Pip?

472
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:39,244
All right, now here's the plan.

473
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:42,549
you're gonna give this wing nut
exactly what he wants.

474
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:46,387
- you're all gonna do your jobs.
- All right, then tell us something.

475
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:49,018
How the hell are we
supposed to do ourjob...

476
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:52,189
whensomebodyis killing the dick
out ofeverybody on the island?

477
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:55,097
Take it easythere, menstrual cramp.

478
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:59,002
you read the poem
on that board out there.

479
00:38:59,105 --> 00:39:01,665
I seen this a million times.

480
00:39:01,775 --> 00:39:05,211
This guy's playing a game,
and we're gonna play right back.

481
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:09,009
Just keep cool,
and this cat'll come to us.

482
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:11,709
And when he does,
I promise you...

483
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:15,584
I'll be there
with mywhompin' stick.

484
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:27,222
Come on, hit it!
Hit it!

485
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,461
Definitely not this guy.

486
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:32,094
Maybe. Maybe not.

487
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:34,696
What in the queen's wig
is going on here?.

488
00:39:34,808 --> 00:39:37,800
We've got a killer on the loose, and
you're throwing a bloody pinata party.

489
00:39:37,911 --> 00:39:41,574
The cut on that pear kid
was left to right.

490
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:45,412
Left to right! I'm looking
for the left-handed killer, you idiot!

491
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,315
Oh. I see.

492
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:58,464
This is totally fucked up.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

493
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,726
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

494
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:05,262
Hey, you know, I've been thinking
about that poem on the board.

495
00:40:05,372 --> 00:40:08,398
There's something
really familiar about those words.

496
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:11,136
I just can't seem to
wrap my fingers around it.

497
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:14,213
- Can you wrap your fingers around this?.
- Whoa!

498
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:23,589
- Hi,Juan.
- Hi. Uh-

499
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:26,784
- Hi. How are you?.
- Good. I made you a hat.

500
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:29,418
Oh. I-I don't know what to say.

501
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:32,157
Well, say "thank you" and put it on.

502
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:35,257
All right, all right.

503
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:37,529
Thank you. I-I love it.

504
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:39,764
you wanna take a walk on the beach?.

505
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:42,808
Eh-

506
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,844
you know,
it's the same here as it is down there.

507
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:50,110
you know, um, the sand and water here,
the sand and water-

508
00:40:55,755 --> 00:40:58,952
I heard you were being
very bad today,Juan.

509
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:01,289
What you mean?.

510
00:41:01,394 --> 00:41:04,022
When you were
supposed to be in the maze...

511
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,792
you were eating watermelon.

512
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,269
- How you find out about that?.
- Because I see everything,Juan.

513
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:21,304
Hey, you- you know-
you know what?. you know what?.

514
00:41:21,414 --> 00:41:26,716
I think it's a good idea ifwe were
to go down the beach a little more far.

515
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,086
- Huh?. The two of us.
- Okay.

516
00:41:38,131 --> 00:41:40,099
Oh, you know, I forgot.

517
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,226
I'm supposed
to go make S'mores.

518
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,337
- We checked every guest cabana.
- No weapons?. No bloody clothes?.

519
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:53,412
Just pornography and
an ass-load of condoms.

520
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:55,413
The guy in 14
had a wooden Bible.

521
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,506
A wooden Bible, huh?.
That's good.

522
00:41:57,617 --> 00:41:59,676
That's a good job.
All right now,Jenny.

523
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:02,186
you go check on Yu. She's freakin' out.

524
00:42:02,288 --> 00:42:04,347
New meat, you take over here.

525
00:42:04,457 --> 00:42:06,586
Okay?. Break!

526
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:09,685
- you'll be all right?.
- Yeah.

527
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:11,821
Sure.

528
00:42:16,036 --> 00:42:21,133
Shite. Shite. Not her best.

529
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,539
Hello, Pete.

530
00:42:24,911 --> 00:42:27,641
"Hope They've Got Hammocks
in Heaven. "

531
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:31,313
Great.

532
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:34,444
And again, Peter.

533
00:42:34,554 --> 00:42:37,148
you dirty bugger.

534
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,128
What's this?.

535
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,130
Jesus, this is crazy!
We can't do this anymore!

536
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,332
Quiet, Yu.
The guests will hear.

537
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:57,967
Jenny, we cannot act like
there's nothing wrong, okay?.

538
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,171
There are guests everywhere.
We have to tell them.

539
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,010
No! you saw that board.

540
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,858
So Isaidit's totallytea bagseason.

541
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:18,157
Dude, shut up, gay-rod. Give me a light.

542
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:21,097
Hey, guys, I'm gonna need you back at the
bonfire. We're gonna make an announcement.

543
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,829
Oh, good, 'cause I got
an announcement to make to Roy.

544
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:27,532
- I'm totally bake-ached.
- Come on!

545
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,108
Idiots.

546
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,771
Hey, come to the beach.

547
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,747
We're gonna make
an announcement.

548
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:42,653
Help!

549
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:44,450
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

550
00:43:49,262 --> 00:43:51,753
Help!

551
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,005
There's always one fuck-head like you...

552
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,078
trying to shit in the apple pie.

553
00:44:08,014 --> 00:44:11,108
you just shat in the one apple pie
that knows how to shit back.

554
00:44:12,785 --> 00:44:14,844
So why don't, uh, you and me,
let's just-

555
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:20,320
Oh, God!

556
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,497
Oh, my God!

557
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:37,807
Shit!

558
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,816
Shit!

559
00:45:02,535 --> 00:45:06,027
Amy's got some fantastic advice for
everybody this morning, haven't you, Amy?.

560
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:09,870
Here are humans,
here is God, and here are we.

561
00:45:09,976 --> 00:45:12,274
you're the girl, Ame!

562
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,574
Shoulders down.

563
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:18,651
- How are we looking, Dr. Wick?
- you're looking fantastic, Amy.

564
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:21,117
Looking fantastic.
This is one ofthe top five cardio-

565
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,924
Let's do the sun salute!

566
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:04,428
Crab, crab, crab.
Shot. Throw it away. Sal ute.

567
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,465
Crab, crab, crab.
Shot. Throw it away. Salute.

568
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,798
Hey, let's dance.
It's easier when you're smiling.

569
00:46:10,903 --> 00:46:14,031
- I heard one of our ski boats last night.
- Holy shit! That's great!

570
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,199
- I only heard it for a second, but-
- So what do we do?.

571
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,641
If it is one of ours, this guy's got it.
It's probably not a real good idea...

572
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:21,805
to go lookin' for it unless you
want to get your dingy chopped off.

573
00:46:21,914 --> 00:46:24,041
What?.

574
00:46:27,553 --> 00:46:32,183
Hey, I figured it out. I know where
those lines on the board came from.

575
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:36,126
you know that line, "Everyone's
looking to find their own paradise"?.

576
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:39,460
- That's from one of your songs.
- What the fuck you talkin' about?. One of my songs?.

577
00:46:39,565 --> 00:46:43,331
Yeah, it's off youralbum
"Sea Shanties and Wet Panties. '"

578
00:46:43,436 --> 00:46:47,202
- 1978?.
- Let's see those pinchers, people!

579
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,673
What does this song
have to do with all this?.

580
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:52,142
The name of the song
is "Naughty Cal. "

581
00:46:52,245 --> 00:46:55,305
- Naughty Cliff. Naughty Carlos.
- Naughty Cal!

582
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,931
Shit.

583
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:18,503
That's the line that was
on the board yesterday.

584
00:47:25,611 --> 00:47:27,545
I didn't know
where it was from.

585
00:47:27,647 --> 00:47:30,241
How do you not know
the words to your own song?

586
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:34,184
I don't even remember
making the album, okay?.

587
00:47:34,287 --> 00:47:38,280
Shit, it was '78.
We were all out ofourgourds.

588
00:47:38,391 --> 00:47:42,384
It was kind ofa crazy time in 1978.

589
00:47:42,495 --> 00:47:45,396
Oh, man, we had
some fuckin' parties.

590
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,441
"High as a kite"?.

591
00:47:57,543 --> 00:48:00,637
"He fell and cracked his shell"?.
That's like Carlos up in the parasail.

592
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:05,844
Then "lost in a maze,"
exactly like Cliff.

593
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:12,149
So this guyis killingpeople
according to a fucking acid trip song?

594
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:14,283
- This is insane!
- Peter.

595
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:19,388
What's the song about?. I s there
some sort of special significance?.

596
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:21,729
Fuck no. I mean, uh,
I don't know.

597
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:26,271
It's a sea shanty. Naughty Cal's
this, uh, underwater cowboy...

598
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:28,340
and Tokeyand Bongo
are his buddies.

599
00:48:28,441 --> 00:48:31,410
And they go on this adventure
to find, uh, Atlantis or some shit.

600
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:35,811
- I-I-I- - Let's listen to the
next line andsee what happens.

601
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,518
Maybe if I play it backwards.

602
00:48:48,394 --> 00:48:51,022
Wait, listen. Listen.

603
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:01,164
- So, what the hell?.
The orca and the octopus?.

604
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:04,107
I mean, is it
the next victims, or is it the killer?.

605
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,010
Our lives depend on us interpreting
the dumbest fucking song I've ever heard.

606
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:10,514
Please, don't hold back.
Just saywhat you really think.

607
00:49:10,616 --> 00:49:12,447
I'm notsensitive.

608
00:49:12,552 --> 00:49:15,214
you know, I won about five fucking
gold records in my lifetime.

609
00:49:15,321 --> 00:49:17,653
H- How many gold records
do you have?.

610
00:49:17,757 --> 00:49:20,157
Let's see how it ends.

611
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:37,836
Jesus.

612
00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:40,879
Pete!
Yu and Hank are dead.

613
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,141
- Why?. What did we do?.
- No, man.

614
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:45,979
Yu and Hank are fucking dead.

615
00:49:46,085 --> 00:49:49,816
you threatening me?. 'Cause if you are,
you little hairless lap dog-

616
00:49:49,922 --> 00:49:51,890
!Ay, puta!
Just come and look!

617
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,922
"Don't let this be Yu. '"

618
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:00,328
She was just trying
to warn the guests.

619
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:02,594
Hank!

620
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,432
Yu?.

621
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:24,379
Why are we doing
a goddamn fashion show?.

622
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,890
Because it's goddamn
Fashion Show Wednesday, that's why!

623
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:30,793
Lookwhat happened to Yu! Remember
the warning: "Do yourjobs or die"?.

624
00:50:30,897 --> 00:50:32,888
So we're just gonna put
little smiles on our faces...

625
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:34,967
and march out there
and do our goddamn jobs.

626
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:37,763
- you got that?. Lars, you're up. Come on. Let's go.
- you got it, Pete.

627
00:50:41,974 --> 00:50:44,204
Lars Brunckhorst, everybody.

628
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:47,643
Lars is sporting
the Pleasure Poncho.

629
00:50:47,747 --> 00:50:51,911
Only 19.95 at the gift shop.
Thank you, Lars.

630
00:50:52,018 --> 00:50:54,043
I'm tellin'ya, I got a bad
feeling about that new guy.

631
00:50:54,153 --> 00:50:57,953
you are right. It all started
when he got here, didn't it?.

632
00:50:58,057 --> 00:51:00,582
- Sam, it isn't Lars or any of us.
- Look,Jenny.

633
00:51:00,693 --> 00:51:03,821
- I know why you're defending him.
- Pajamas! Come on! Move!

634
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:08,333
- Putman, pillow.
- Putman Livingston, I presume.

635
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:11,267
Oh, ifit isn't
Little Lord Fauntleroy!

636
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,270
Pip, pip! Tallyho!

637
00:51:13,372 --> 00:51:15,806
I got it. In that song...

638
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:19,435
Naughty Cal sings
about the scary octopus.

639
00:51:19,545 --> 00:51:23,003
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus.

640
00:51:23,115 --> 00:51:27,609
- Hello?.
- Dave, just go playwith the curtains or something.

641
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,188
No, no, no. We can't dismiss
that song. What about Carlos and Cliff?.

642
00:51:30,289 --> 00:51:34,521
What about the fact that Hankwas buried in
the sand like the buried treasure in the song?.

643
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:36,686
All right,
so maybe the octopus...

644
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:38,855
is the way
the next person dies?.

645
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:41,525
How do you kill someone
with an octopus?.

646
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:45,331
Octopus spelled backward is "supotco. "
Juan, isn't that Spanish for something?.

647
00:51:45,438 --> 00:51:48,202
"Supotco"?. No.
The word for shoe is zapato.

648
00:51:48,307 --> 00:51:53,108
- Hmm. Shoe.
- Am I the only one who thinks his head looks like an octopus?.

649
00:51:53,212 --> 00:51:55,703
- Shh, shh, shh. Here he comes.
- What did I miss?.

650
00:51:55,815 --> 00:51:58,875
- Apparently, somebody's gonna get killed by a shoe.
- Hmm.

651
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:02,477
Okay, you guys, instead of focusing on the
song, why don't we go look for those boats?.

652
00:52:02,588 --> 00:52:06,684
- Good idea.
- Jenny, why don't you and I go search together?.

653
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:09,226
- Um-
- Putman.

654
00:52:09,328 --> 00:52:11,888
- Why don't you and I go and look for that boat?.
- Are you daft?

655
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:15,456
I'm not going out in the jungle
with you and your bloody shiatsu.

656
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:18,731
If you're the killer,
you'll snap my neck like a twig.

657
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:22,069
All right, stick to the shore.
There's no reason to go in thejungle.

658
00:52:22,174 --> 00:52:24,972
The boats areprobably
gonna be covered with sticks.

659
00:52:25,077 --> 00:52:27,136
Or branches.

660
00:52:27,246 --> 00:52:29,908
Thanks much, officer.

661
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:32,484
Aren't you taking any weapons?.

662
00:52:32,585 --> 00:52:34,746
I have all the weapons I need.

663
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:38,381
Piss on that.
I'm taking a machete.

664
00:52:38,491 --> 00:52:41,051
Thanks for doing this,
Lars.

665
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,095
you're very brave.
Just be careful, all right?.

666
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,101
Good luck, Putman.

667
00:53:00,146 --> 00:53:03,638
Better believe I'll be keeping
an eye on you, Mr. Miyagi.

668
00:53:16,295 --> 00:53:20,595
I know you guys are probably a little
intimidated by cooking for the whole resort...

669
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,931
but I think you're gonna get
a big kick out ofit, okay?.

670
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:27,199
I bet you watched Yu and Kelly.

671
00:53:27,306 --> 00:53:29,900
And most of it's just common sense.
Like right now...

672
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:32,910
I'm making my famous
Coconut Pete's Paella.

673
00:53:33,012 --> 00:53:35,606
Can anyone guess
the secret ingredient?.

674
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:38,582
Come on.

675
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:41,448
Coconut Pete's Paella?.

676
00:53:42,922 --> 00:53:45,288
The secret ingredient?.

677
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:48,827
- Coconut... Pete's-
- Eh-

678
00:53:48,928 --> 00:53:51,897
- Coconut?.
- Yes, goddamn it! Yes!

679
00:53:51,997 --> 00:53:56,957
Yes!

680
00:53:57,069 --> 00:54:01,665
Jesus! you think Eddie Money
has to put up with this shit?.

681
00:54:05,578 --> 00:54:08,172
Goddamn it!
Coconut Pete's Paella!

682
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:12,908
Jesus Christ.
What you think?.

683
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:15,248
I think Pete's under
a lot of pressure.

684
00:54:15,354 --> 00:54:17,413
I don't think
we can sayfor sure. God, I don't know.

685
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:19,753
- What are you doing?.
- Uh, you know.

686
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:23,090
Just, uh, hanging around,
uh, looking through the window.

687
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:26,528
Calamari?.

688
00:54:26,632 --> 00:54:30,033
- Uh-
- It's an aphrodisiac,Juan.

689
00:54:32,238 --> 00:54:34,968
- Oh. Oh!
- What's wrong?.

690
00:54:35,074 --> 00:54:38,100
you're not afraid of
a little octopus, are you?.

691
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,235
Thank you.

692
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:44,015
When you're done here...

693
00:54:44,116 --> 00:54:46,209
I want you to come inside
and find me...

694
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,481
'cause I wanna
wrap my little tentacles around you.

695
00:54:49,588 --> 00:54:52,682
Okay.

696
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,757
No way.

697
00:55:05,404 --> 00:55:07,838
Think about it, the octopus.

698
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,908
Look, she's a weird little chick,
I'll give you that.

699
00:55:10,009 --> 00:55:14,742
But, look, it still
doesn't prove that she's the killer.

700
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:19,250
All right. There is only
one way to find out.

701
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:28,520
Don't be nervous.

702
00:55:28,627 --> 00:55:34,361
Eh, I just want our first time
to be wonderful.

703
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:39,171
So I would say that
if you're the killer...

704
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:41,501
just, you know,
just maybe don't kill me.

705
00:55:41,607 --> 00:55:43,939
Or at least make it,
you know, painless.

706
00:55:44,043 --> 00:55:46,068
With those moves of yours, I bet
you could put me down nice and easy.

707
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:48,339
- Just, zip, and I'm out, right?.
- Look.

708
00:55:48,447 --> 00:55:51,245
The whole reason we're hiding in this
closet is because we think she's the killer.

709
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,341
- Oh.
- I'm gonna bite you.

710
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:55,682
- Well, not too hard, I hope.
- I really like Juan.

711
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:58,279
I rememberwhen we first met, I was
kinda like, "Who the fuck is this guy?.

712
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,517
Some local guy
comin' down here and-"

713
00:56:02,995 --> 00:56:05,293
Mmm.

714
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:12,631
- I haven't been entirely honest with you.
- you mean...

715
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:15,673
you don't really go
to the Oral Roberts?.

716
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,823
Aah!

717
00:56:31,924 --> 00:56:34,154
I mean...

718
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:38,959
I just wanted to leave
my past behind me when I came here.

719
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:42,363
What the fuck are you,
a praying mantis woman?.

720
00:56:46,205 --> 00:56:48,799
I-

721
00:56:48,908 --> 00:56:51,843
I've never been
to a place like this.

722
00:56:51,944 --> 00:56:53,912
I mean, it's just so free.

723
00:56:55,547 --> 00:57:00,246
Juan, I have spent
mywhole life in a gym.

724
00:57:00,352 --> 00:57:03,321
I just wanted to party
like everyone else.

725
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:07,825
My coach, Orgrav,
would kill me ifhe found out.

726
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:12,193
He would hunt me down
like a deranged lunatic.

727
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:16,962
- He's really scary some-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

728
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:21,165
- you are a gymnast?.
- Yeah.

729
00:57:21,273 --> 00:57:24,538
Oh!
Gracias.

730
00:57:29,915 --> 00:57:32,577
No tushie! No! No!

731
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,707
I 'I I be right back.

732
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,410
Okay.

733
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:13,386
Eh, I'm still not sure.

734
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:16,689
I may need a few more hours
to pump her for information.

735
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:18,888
you asshole!
Now you're just trying to get laid.

736
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:21,592
How would you like to be stuffed in this
closet while I go out there and have sex?.

737
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,669
That is a great idea.

738
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:27,102
Shh! Here she comes!

739
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,580
What exactly
are your intentions with Jenny?.

740
00:58:42,221 --> 00:58:44,280
you know, Put...

741
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:49,054
during the Sung Dynasty, there was
a great mystic- MasterTsu Tong Po.

742
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:51,152
And he once said
something verywise:

743
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:55,628
"If you love something, set it free.

744
00:58:55,734 --> 00:58:57,725
- Ifit comes back to you-"
- Fuck off.

745
00:58:57,836 --> 00:59:00,031
It's a bloody Hallmark card.

746
00:59:01,306 --> 00:59:03,274
Just trying to help you, man.

747
00:59:05,044 --> 00:59:08,571
Well, she has taken
quite a fancy to you, hasn't she?.

748
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,014
But I have some...
ammunition of my own.

749
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,814
What kind ofman would I be ifl sat
idly bywhile you stole herfrom me?.

750
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:28,556
Do not underestimate me, Lars.

751
00:59:32,771 --> 00:59:35,205
I know things you don't.

752
01:00:06,638 --> 01:00:09,539
All right, Lars,
let's see what you got.

753
01:00:20,185 --> 01:00:22,415
Lookwhat I found.

754
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:25,388
- Wow.
- Yeah. Shiny.

755
01:00:38,203 --> 01:00:40,171
Hey.

756
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:50,310
Oh! I knewit.

757
01:00:52,017 --> 01:00:55,043
Oh, sick fuck.

758
01:00:55,154 --> 01:00:58,715
Dear God in heaven.

759
01:01:06,331 --> 01:01:08,492
Lars?

760
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:13,930
Oh, dear God!

761
01:01:39,464 --> 01:01:41,329
No!

762
01:01:42,668 --> 01:01:45,432
No!

763
01:01:45,537 --> 01:01:48,973
Huh?.

764
01:02:01,053 --> 01:02:04,250
- you!
- That's right, love.

765
01:02:04,356 --> 01:02:08,190
Now take that stupid bag
off your head and give us a kiss.

766
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:13,759
- What?.
- Advantage, Putman.

767
01:02:13,865 --> 01:02:17,460
Hey-

768
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:19,799
Putman!

769
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:21,770
Putman!

770
01:02:21,873 --> 01:02:25,434
Putman! Wake up, Putman.
It's a dream! It's just a dream, Putman.

771
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:37,012
Farewell.

772
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:42,350
Keep it clean,
keep it clean, huh, mister?

773
01:02:42,461 --> 01:02:44,952
That's a point!
That's a point!

774
01:02:45,063 --> 01:02:47,657
!Mira!The boat!

775
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:56,400
- Whoo!
- !Ay Mami! He found the fucking boat!

776
01:02:57,809 --> 01:03:00,004
Whoo!

777
01:03:00,112 --> 01:03:02,080
Hang on to your kudos.

778
01:03:03,815 --> 01:03:06,784
- Oh!
- She's not going anywhere.

779
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:09,376
- What did you do to the propeller, man?.
- I didn't do anything.

780
01:03:09,488 --> 01:03:11,479
This is the one
that was pulling Carlos.

781
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:14,150
Well, we couldsenda group
to paddle out to the mainland.

782
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:17,194
- We've got plenty of strong guys.
- No chance.

783
01:03:17,296 --> 01:03:20,663
The riptide'll take you out to sea.

784
01:03:20,766 --> 01:03:23,758
you'll be drinking your own urine
in less than 20 hours.

785
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:27,970
- Where's Putman?.
- He's not here?.

786
01:03:28,073 --> 01:03:30,132
He left last night.
He ran offinto the jungle.

787
01:03:30,242 --> 01:03:33,006
- Oh, by "ran off' do you mean "got killed by you"?.
- Ah!

788
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:36,547
What, did you really thinkwe wouldn't notice
Putman was gone if you came backwith a boat?.

789
01:03:36,648 --> 01:03:39,344
- Sam, that's ridiculous.
- Whyis that ridiculous?

790
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:44,081
Hey, look. Putman freaked out in the middle
of the night and took off into the jungle.

791
01:03:44,189 --> 01:03:46,180
Look, we went into your room
last night, Lars.

792
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:48,350
Mark David Chapman over here
has a shrine to Pete.

793
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:51,554
- It's unbelievable!
- So I'm a fan.

794
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:53,995
A fan?.
Man, you're a fucking loon!

795
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:56,499
Look, nobody here
was killed last night...

796
01:03:56,601 --> 01:03:59,832
because Lars
was in the jungle killing Putman.

797
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:02,429
Hey, look. I could never hurt
another person, okay?.

798
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,736
- I don't believe in violence.
- Mm-hmm.

799
01:04:04,843 --> 01:04:06,834
I touch other people
to make them feel better.

800
01:04:06,945 --> 01:04:09,544
Come on. I have an obligation
to get to the bottom of that-

801
01:04:09,648 --> 01:04:13,778
- !Ay! you are the fucking Fun Police!
- Juan!

802
01:04:13,885 --> 01:04:16,410
- What the hell- - Come on,
take it easy! Quit your bickering!

803
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:19,922
Now, we just get through one more night,
the boat will be here tomorrow.

804
01:04:20,025 --> 01:04:23,256
We'llbe allright. So, come on,
everybody, let'sjust have a drink...

805
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:26,798
- and... mellow out.
- I don't want to mellow out, Pete!

806
01:04:26,898 --> 01:04:30,299
I want to know what Lars's deal is, huh?. you
come here and everyone starts getting killed.

807
01:04:30,402 --> 01:04:33,030
Hey, I don't have to tell you shit,
Fun Pig! you wanna Fun arrest me?.

808
01:04:33,138 --> 01:04:35,766
you get a Fun-fucking warrant!
Until then...

809
01:04:35,874 --> 01:04:39,275
stay out of my
Fun-fucking face!

810
01:04:39,378 --> 01:04:41,437
Come on!

811
01:04:45,016 --> 01:04:49,043
Jenny, you know
I'm not the killer, right?.

812
01:04:49,154 --> 01:04:51,145
Look, Lars,
it's not so bad in here, okay?.

813
01:04:51,256 --> 01:04:53,781
- I'll bring you some magazine.
- Yeah.

814
01:04:53,892 --> 01:04:56,087
you familiar
with the expression "sitting duck"?.

815
01:04:56,194 --> 01:04:58,287
No.

816
01:04:59,498 --> 01:05:02,092
- you guys, this is totally fucked up.
- Look,Jenny...

817
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,397
ifhe's the killer,
then we have him in this room.

818
01:05:05,504 --> 01:05:08,166
And if not,
then at least we know it's not him.

819
01:05:16,114 --> 01:05:20,141
Did it stink?.
you bet it stunk.

820
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:23,346
Oh, shit!

821
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,913
- Hey, you guys gonna be hanging around for a while?.
- Totally.

822
01:05:27,025 --> 01:05:30,586
We're just getting started.
Anyway, that's my mom for you.

823
01:05:34,032 --> 01:05:36,523
Any of you guys
have a mother?.

824
01:05:36,635 --> 01:05:38,933
Free drinks,
whoever catches me!

825
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:41,699
Whoo-hoo!

826
01:05:54,619 --> 01:05:56,587
Shit.

827
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:01,657
Oh, God!

828
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:11,196
your prayers have been answered.

829
01:06:11,303 --> 01:06:14,329
- you asshole!
- Nah, I'm not an asshole.

830
01:06:14,439 --> 01:06:17,533
I'mjust young, dumb andfull-
What the fuck?

831
01:06:17,642 --> 01:06:21,806
- What? - Something just
brushed against my leg. What the-

832
01:06:21,913 --> 01:06:24,507
No, there's seriously
something down here.

833
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:27,710
- What?.
- Oh, no, wait!

834
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:30,481
It's just my gigantic cock.

835
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:33,080
Amy's got
some fantastic advice for everybody.

836
01:06:33,191 --> 01:06:35,921
- Oh, my God.
- So, you want to get it on?

837
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:38,552
Dirk, get outta the pool!

838
01:06:38,663 --> 01:06:40,688
- Huh?.
- I'm not kidding!

839
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:45,429
- Hurry!
- Hey, that's what I call service!

840
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:48,370
Now! Get outta the pool!

841
01:07:01,786 --> 01:07:05,085
Hey, help me!

842
01:07:06,625 --> 01:07:10,391
Putman! you're alive!

843
01:07:10,495 --> 01:07:12,861
you've got your arms around me,Jenny.

844
01:07:12,964 --> 01:07:15,762
I can only assume this means
every other man on the island is dead.

845
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:18,267
We got to get outta here! Dirk's dead!

846
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:20,770
He just got electrocuted in the pool!

847
01:07:20,872 --> 01:07:24,865
Really?. What was the look on his face?.
He must have screamed bloody murder.

848
01:07:24,976 --> 01:07:27,877
you're scaring me.

849
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:31,540
I just want to know if smoke
came out ofhis ears. Is that so wrong?.

850
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:34,915
Hey! Oh! Putman, where have you been?.

851
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,545
Running in circles through
this bloodyjungle, that's where.

852
01:07:37,656 --> 01:07:39,783
Thank God you're not dead. Now,
we need to get over to Pete's cabana...

853
01:07:39,891 --> 01:07:41,984
- and get that auxiliary generator.
- Wait, hang on!

854
01:07:42,093 --> 01:07:46,462
If Dirkjust got killed,
then Lars couldn't be the killer!

855
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:52,298
All right now, be on guard.
He might be a little cranky.

856
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:54,998
Lars!Lars, we're here!

857
01:07:55,106 --> 01:07:57,404
Oh, do give it a rest,Jen.

858
01:08:03,515 --> 01:08:05,608
He couldn't have.

859
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:08,049
He's far too large.

860
01:08:10,188 --> 01:08:12,918
We gotta find Pete.

861
01:08:14,426 --> 01:08:17,725
Pete!

862
01:08:19,297 --> 01:08:21,492
Pete?.

863
01:08:26,371 --> 01:08:29,101
Pete?.

864
01:08:29,207 --> 01:08:31,198
you in here, Pete?.

865
01:08:31,309 --> 01:08:34,642
Peter! We need the key
to the generator box.

866
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:56,499
- Damn it!
- Isn't somebody going to get the fuckin' door?.

867
01:09:02,273 --> 01:09:06,209
- Who's there?.
- Who's out there?.

868
01:09:11,449 --> 01:09:14,418
Hey!

869
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:18,250
I think there's a problem with the lights!

870
01:09:18,356 --> 01:09:21,189
Right?.

871
01:09:21,326 --> 01:09:24,523
All right,
Lars will probably come after us here.

872
01:09:24,629 --> 01:09:27,257
We don't knowforsure
that it is Lars.

873
01:09:27,365 --> 01:09:29,925
And we don't know ifhe got out
or if someone else got in.

874
01:09:30,035 --> 01:09:34,062
What is it with you and Lars?. I'm
beginning to wonder if you aren't in cahoots!

875
01:09:34,172 --> 01:09:36,868
I mean, let's see.
you had sex with Rolo, and he's dead.

876
01:09:36,975 --> 01:09:39,068
you and Cliff, right?.
He's dead.

877
01:09:39,177 --> 01:09:42,943
Give me a break. I screwed Juan
and Pete, and those guys aren't dead.

878
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:45,676
Bloody hell,Jen!
Am I the only one?.

879
01:09:45,784 --> 01:09:48,184
All right, let's get back to the case.
What we have to do-

880
01:09:48,286 --> 01:09:51,119
Why don't you drop
the bullshit cop routine, okay, Sam?.

881
01:09:51,222 --> 01:09:55,181
Oh,just as soon as you drop the "I've
got nothing to hide" routine,Juan.

882
01:09:55,293 --> 01:10:00,287
Let me guess. you were in here looking forthis
letterfrom the Encarnacion prison facility?

883
01:10:00,398 --> 01:10:04,459
- What the fuck, man?.
- Fuck, why you are doing this, man?.

884
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:08,130
"Juan shows no signs
of the bizarre and horrible behavior...

885
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:10,230
"that brought him to this institution.

886
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:13,538
"We believe him to be
fullyrehabilitated...

887
01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:16,773
and will be an excellent
addition to your staff. "

888
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:20,373
- What did you do,Juan?.
- I did nothing,Jenny.

889
01:10:20,485 --> 01:10:22,749
What the fuck did you do, man?

890
01:10:22,854 --> 01:10:27,120
Costa Rican prison-
that's some hard-core anal action, man.

891
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:31,252
- Juan, we have to know. - What did
you do,Juan?. - What did you do,Juan?.

892
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:34,627
- What the fuck did you do, man, huh?
- What did you do?

893
01:10:34,733 --> 01:10:37,293
- Tell us!
- I did nothing! Huh?.

894
01:10:40,338 --> 01:10:42,806
El Chupacabra!

895
01:10:42,907 --> 01:10:45,307
- Hey!
- No!

896
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:49,244
Oh! Oh, my God!

897
01:10:54,419 --> 01:10:58,287
- How could you do that?.
- Wait, wait!

898
01:10:58,389 --> 01:11:00,985
I did not do this. I'm not a killer.

899
01:11:01,092 --> 01:11:04,186
What the fuck, man?.
Then, what is this?.

900
01:11:04,295 --> 01:11:06,456
you want to know what I did?.

901
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:08,657
Huh?.
you all want to know what I did?.

902
01:11:11,202 --> 01:11:14,968
Juan Castillo...
went to jail...

903
01:11:15,073 --> 01:11:18,600
for having sex with a goat.

904
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:21,679
Allright?

905
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,941
What you want me to say?.

906
01:11:24,048 --> 01:11:26,380
We lived on a farm!

907
01:11:26,484 --> 01:11:28,782
And I got lonely!

908
01:11:30,455 --> 01:11:32,855
We were-

909
01:11:32,957 --> 01:11:36,688
Oh, we were just
a couple of stupid kids.

910
01:11:36,795 --> 01:11:39,355
No, it wasn'tJuan.

911
01:11:39,464 --> 01:11:41,659
It was Dave...

912
01:11:41,766 --> 01:11:43,734
wasn't it?

913
01:11:43,835 --> 01:11:46,998
you hated him
forwhat he did to your parents.

914
01:11:47,105 --> 01:11:51,565
you see,
what none of us did know...

915
01:11:51,676 --> 01:11:54,543
indeed,
what none ofus could know...

916
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:56,637
was that David's parents...

917
01:11:56,748 --> 01:12:01,685
were trampled to death
at a Coconut Pete concert.

918
01:12:01,786 --> 01:12:04,346
What the hell's
wrong with you, Putman?

919
01:12:04,455 --> 01:12:07,219
Everyone knows Dave's parents
got killed at a Pete show.

920
01:12:07,325 --> 01:12:10,158
Yeah, way to bring up a sore subject.

921
01:12:10,261 --> 01:12:14,994
- What?. I- What?. - you
think I could have killed him?

922
01:12:15,099 --> 01:12:18,193
He's my Uncle Petey.

923
01:12:18,303 --> 01:12:20,737
you all saw him as...

924
01:12:20,839 --> 01:12:23,330
a mellow island songster...

925
01:12:23,441 --> 01:12:26,171
and a resort owner, but...

926
01:12:26,277 --> 01:12:30,008
how many of you knew that he-
he was afraid of dogs...

927
01:12:30,114 --> 01:12:32,446
and that his favorite spice
was rosemary?.

928
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:35,679
Howmanyof you knew that...

929
01:12:35,787 --> 01:12:39,120
he was uncircumcised
and smelled of oranges?.

930
01:12:39,224 --> 01:12:42,125
Yes, that's all
well and good, David.

931
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:44,752
But I'll bet hind to horses...

932
01:12:44,863 --> 01:12:47,195
that you inherit the island.

933
01:12:49,067 --> 01:12:52,195
- The island is already mine.
- What?.

934
01:12:53,404 --> 01:12:55,304
Pete signed it over to me last week.

935
01:12:55,406 --> 01:12:58,102
He was going back on the-
on the road where he belonged.

936
01:12:58,209 --> 01:13:01,804
He was forming a supergroup-
Billy Squier and Eddie Money!

937
01:13:01,913 --> 01:13:06,646
Don Henley was gonna play drums!
Fuck, that would've been tight! Fuck.

938
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:11,313
He was gonna sell the island
to the navyfortest bombing.

939
01:13:11,422 --> 01:13:14,152
But I told him I-I could handle
the responsibility.

940
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:17,626
Lars.

941
01:13:17,729 --> 01:13:20,493
No! No!

942
01:13:20,598 --> 01:13:24,125
Pete.

943
01:13:24,235 --> 01:13:27,432
Oh, my God! Pete!

944
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:34,800
Bravo, Lars, bravo.

945
01:13:34,913 --> 01:13:38,144
Very convincing.
Very convincing.

946
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:43,084
- you fucker!
- Lars! No, stop it! No!

947
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,614
- Stop it!
- Hold it, hold it!

948
01:13:47,725 --> 01:13:51,525
- Let's lock him up again.
- No! No! Stop it!

949
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:54,291
Stop it!
We're not locking anybody up!

950
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,266
We're all gonna stay together,
in one room!

951
01:13:57,368 --> 01:13:59,529
Look, the boat
will be here tomorrow.

952
01:13:59,637 --> 01:14:02,197
We'll go to the club,
gather all the guests...

953
01:14:02,307 --> 01:14:05,105
and wait until the morning,
and we're going to do this together.

954
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:08,838
And we're gonna make it
through the night, okay?.

955
01:14:23,895 --> 01:14:25,863
Screw this, man!
I'm not going anywhere with Lars.

956
01:14:25,964 --> 01:14:27,989
Well, I'm not going anywhere withJuan.

957
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:30,226
- Ooh!
- What kind of a man has sex with a goat?.

958
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:33,065
- Hey, I used a condom.
- Oh.

959
01:14:33,171 --> 01:14:35,469
you told me
they were against your religion.

960
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:41,575
Ehhh, you know, I need to find Peenalop.

961
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,479
I am sure you all understand.

962
01:14:45,583 --> 01:14:48,746
you come anywhere near
my cabana, I'm taking your head off!.

963
01:14:48,853 --> 01:14:52,983
Let's get outta here, Dave. Come on,
Dave, let's get outta here, man.

964
01:14:53,091 --> 01:14:55,218
I don't thinkso.

965
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:03,794
- Jenny, you're making
a most grievous mistake.

966
01:15:07,105 --> 01:15:09,232
I'm still not sure what happened...

967
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:12,434
with all that dodgy business
back in thejungle.

968
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:15,137
But I'm plagued bythe dreams.

969
01:15:16,948 --> 01:15:20,509
I believe I'm safer on my own.

970
01:15:20,618 --> 01:15:23,109
Well, that plan went to hell.

971
01:15:23,221 --> 01:15:26,452
Well, at least
they left us a torch.

972
01:15:26,557 --> 01:15:29,048
Jenny?. Jenny?.

973
01:15:29,193 --> 01:15:34,130
I believe I know where the generator is.

974
01:15:52,984 --> 01:15:55,111
Damn it!
He must have taken my swords.

975
01:15:55,219 --> 01:15:58,552
I don't care ifl have to carve a spear
out ofbamboo, this asshole's-

976
01:15:58,656 --> 01:16:00,783
- Shh, shh, listen.
- No, I'm not gonna shush!

977
01:16:00,892 --> 01:16:03,827
I'm so sick of running from this-

978
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:05,919
I thought
we didn't have any power.

979
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:10,126
Dave?.

980
01:16:10,234 --> 01:16:13,897
Dave. Dave?.

981
01:16:20,445 --> 01:16:22,811
God!

982
01:16:29,454 --> 01:16:33,322
It's me! It's me! It's me!

983
01:16:36,594 --> 01:16:38,494
Holy shit!

984
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:49,762
Oh, my God!
The lock's broken!

985
01:16:49,874 --> 01:16:51,842
Oh, my God! He's out there.

986
01:16:51,943 --> 01:16:55,174
Quick, under the bed,
hurry. Come on!

987
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,147
- Go, go! Hurry!
- you'll never fit.

988
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:02,014
Go, go, go, go, go!

989
01:17:03,287 --> 01:17:04,777
Come on!

990
01:17:04,889 --> 01:17:06,880
Hurry! Come on!

991
01:17:06,991 --> 01:17:10,188
What are you doing?.
Lars, what are you doing?. Hurry!

992
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:12,285
Lars, please!

993
01:17:12,396 --> 01:17:14,796
Come on!

994
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:17,697
Lars, come on! He's coming!

995
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:21,329
Oh, my God!

996
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:24,237
He's coming!

997
01:17:25,843 --> 01:17:27,902
- Whew!
- Holy shit!

998
01:17:28,012 --> 01:17:30,742
Is that how you escaped
out ofthat window?.

999
01:17:30,848 --> 01:17:33,339
Why don't you
just do that all the time?.

1000
01:17:33,451 --> 01:17:36,249
Is that a fat joke?.

1001
01:17:36,354 --> 01:17:38,322
What the hell?.

1002
01:17:39,824 --> 01:17:42,725
What the hell,Jenny?.

1003
01:18:27,905 --> 01:18:31,136
Putman! It was you?

1004
01:18:31,242 --> 01:18:34,234
- What?. What was me?.
- Step back, Putman!

1005
01:18:34,345 --> 01:18:37,940
Oh, you actually believe that
I'm the killer. Oh, that's a laugh.

1006
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:40,210
Then what are you doing here?.

1007
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:43,253
Well, Ijustpoppedbyto say-

1008
01:18:43,354 --> 01:18:46,118
- Uh-
- you perv.

1009
01:18:46,224 --> 01:18:49,921
Really,Jenny, there's a perfectlyreasonable
explanation for all this. I mean-

1010
01:18:50,027 --> 01:18:53,292
Well, you see, it seemed like
such a good final memento and-

1011
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:57,128
Wel I, I - you know how good I thi nk
you look i n red, and that little-

1012
01:18:57,235 --> 01:19:01,433
- No!
- Oh, dear God! Oh, dear God!

1013
01:19:01,539 --> 01:19:03,769
- Where's the key?.
- I don't know.

1014
01:19:03,874 --> 01:19:06,138
Lock the door!
Lock the door!

1015
01:19:06,244 --> 01:19:08,735
The lock's broken!

1016
01:19:08,846 --> 01:19:10,575
Broken?.

1017
01:19:10,681 --> 01:19:14,412
you've manacled me to my deathbed,
you Piccadillywhore!

1018
01:19:14,518 --> 01:19:18,420
- I'm so sorry.
- I could never stay mad at you,Jenny.

1019
01:19:18,522 --> 01:19:22,822
Quickly!
Give me the racket! Give me the balls!

1020
01:19:22,927 --> 01:19:26,328
- Go! Go! Yeah!
- Quickly! Run!

1021
01:19:27,765 --> 01:19:29,562
Get out!

1022
01:19:33,971 --> 01:19:36,940
Machete Phil! I knew it!

1023
01:19:38,809 --> 01:19:42,836
Oh, God!

1024
01:19:42,947 --> 01:19:46,007
- Oh-
- Oh, God!

1025
01:19:46,117 --> 01:19:48,711
- Go.
- N-No!

1026
01:19:48,819 --> 01:19:50,980
- Go, dearJen. Go.
- No!

1027
01:19:53,224 --> 01:19:55,556
Namaste.

1028
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,855
Fuck off!.

1029
01:19:57,962 --> 01:20:00,863
Come on.

1030
01:20:00,965 --> 01:20:03,399
I'm sorry.

1031
01:20:10,408 --> 01:20:14,674
Ahhh, you!
I should have known it was you!

1032
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:17,805
- Doesn't surprise me a bit, really.
- Damn it, Putman!

1033
01:20:17,915 --> 01:20:22,079
- Who is it?.
- I'm sure you think I'll go down without a fight.

1034
01:20:22,186 --> 01:20:25,053
But it's notyet game, set-

1035
01:21:33,424 --> 01:21:36,587
Soap, please.

1036
01:21:49,073 --> 01:21:51,667
Hey! Nice helmet, Lars!

1037
01:21:51,776 --> 01:21:54,267
About time you two perverts
showed up for the party!

1038
01:21:54,378 --> 01:21:57,506
Pourit! Pourit!

1039
01:22:00,117 --> 01:22:02,984
Oh,Jesus Christ!
That's blood!

1040
01:22:13,731 --> 01:22:17,531
- What the fuck?.
- Oh, God!

1041
01:22:19,136 --> 01:22:21,263
Oh, God!

1042
01:22:24,141 --> 01:22:28,077
We're all gonna die!

1043
01:22:38,088 --> 01:22:41,387
Help! Help!

1044
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,229
Penelope!
Where's Juan?.

1045
01:22:46,330 --> 01:22:49,788
I don't know,
I haven't seen him all night.

1046
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,233
What the hell is going on?.

1047
01:22:53,337 --> 01:22:56,363
Juan! Juan!

1048
01:22:56,474 --> 01:22:58,965
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What are you doing?

1049
01:22:59,076 --> 01:23:03,638
- Let me go!
- Don't move! Where the hell have you been?.

1050
01:23:03,747 --> 01:23:09,208
I was looking for Peenalop.
Why you are looking at me like that?.

1051
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:12,255
'Cause you disappeared a halfhour ago,
and now you show up covered in blood.

1052
01:23:12,356 --> 01:23:14,347
Because I just found Putman.

1053
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:17,589
- He's dead.
- Oh, shit! Sam!

1054
01:23:17,695 --> 01:23:20,323
Oh, myGod!

1055
01:23:20,431 --> 01:23:23,127
- The mudbath!
- Let's go, Peenalop.

1056
01:23:41,151 --> 01:23:43,312
Oh, God.

1057
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:24,327
- Oh, no.
- What?.

1058
01:24:25,863 --> 01:24:29,697
- Oh, fuck.
- Sam. Sam.

1059
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:33,826
Sam!

1060
01:24:54,758 --> 01:24:57,454
- Get out.
- What?.

1061
01:24:57,561 --> 01:25:01,190
Get out, now!

1062
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:07,769
Did you know that
I can hold my breath...

1063
01:25:07,871 --> 01:25:10,965
for three minutes and 33 seconds?.

1064
01:25:11,075 --> 01:25:13,976
Nobody ever suspects
the Fun Police.

1065
01:25:14,078 --> 01:25:16,979
- Bullshit. I always have suspected you.
- Bullshit. you did not.

1066
01:25:17,081 --> 01:25:19,049
you are the bullshit!

1067
01:25:19,149 --> 01:25:23,449
He's the guy from the campfire story-
Machete Phil, the kid with no dick.

1068
01:25:23,554 --> 01:25:26,352
No. That's just
an old campfire story.

1069
01:25:26,457 --> 01:25:29,051
What do you piss out of,
your asshole?.

1070
01:25:29,159 --> 01:25:32,959
It's just a story! I have a dick.

1071
01:25:33,063 --> 01:25:35,122
I'm not Machete Phil.

1072
01:25:35,232 --> 01:25:37,632
I'm Machete Sam.

1073
01:25:37,735 --> 01:25:40,829
Sam, whyare you doing this?

1074
01:25:40,938 --> 01:25:43,839
Oh, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

1075
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:48,241
I asked Rolo ifhe hadanygrass,
and he said he didn't have any.

1076
01:25:48,345 --> 01:25:50,973
So then I followed him
into thejungle.

1077
01:25:51,081 --> 01:25:53,072
- Would you believe what I saw?.
- No.

1078
01:25:53,183 --> 01:25:55,743
He had grass. My grass!

1079
01:25:55,853 --> 01:25:59,220
A huge bag ofit.

1080
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:02,850
And he was smokin' it
with those two little hussies...

1081
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,123
even though
he said he had none.

1082
01:26:07,698 --> 01:26:12,158
So then-
No, wait, that's not it.

1083
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:14,737
I found out that Pete was
giving the island to Dave.

1084
01:26:14,838 --> 01:26:17,773
Oh, yeah. That's it.
It wasn't about the grass.

1085
01:26:17,875 --> 01:26:21,675
Although that was incredibly uncool.

1086
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:24,873
It was about Pete giving the island
to that little shithead!

1087
01:26:24,982 --> 01:26:28,713
All-night raving,
pill-popping little son ofa bitch!

1088
01:26:28,819 --> 01:26:32,448
What about me?. H uh?.
I deserved it!

1089
01:26:32,556 --> 01:26:35,389
I'm the best goddamned employee
this place has ever seen!

1090
01:26:35,492 --> 01:26:37,551
Dave was gonna run it
into the ground.

1091
01:26:37,661 --> 01:26:41,256
Not on mywatch!
This is my home.

1092
01:26:41,365 --> 01:26:45,096
Pete thinks I'mjust a clown,
goodforfun andgames.

1093
01:26:45,202 --> 01:26:47,932
Well, I got you guys
to do yourjobs, didn't I?.

1094
01:26:48,038 --> 01:26:50,233
Pretty good managerial skills,
don't you think?.

1095
01:26:50,340 --> 01:26:54,470
Setting you guys up to decipher
that stupid "Naughty Cal'"song.

1096
01:26:57,014 --> 01:26:59,244
Who's the orca?.
Who's the octopus?.

1097
01:26:59,349 --> 01:27:04,218
I am the Walrus!
I am the Walrus! I am the Walrus!

1098
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:06,551
Oh! Ooh!

1099
01:27:06,657 --> 01:27:09,387
Get outta here! Now!
I can't hold him for long.

1100
01:27:09,493 --> 01:27:12,394
Tryputtinghim to sleep!
Trythe-the Snoring Panda!

1101
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:15,329
I can't reach it.
I can handle this.

1102
01:27:15,432 --> 01:27:17,730
- He'll orgasm for another few minutes. Go!
- Ooh.

1103
01:27:17,835 --> 01:27:20,269
- I'm not leaving you!
- I'll be okay.

1104
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:23,134
- Get outta here. It's gonna get messy.
- Ooh. Ooh.

1105
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,640
- Go.
- Go.

1106
01:27:25,743 --> 01:27:30,009
Oh! Ohhh!

1107
01:27:30,114 --> 01:27:32,344
Oh! Ooh!

1108
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:34,940
- Back to the club!
- Are you crazy?.

1109
01:27:35,052 --> 01:27:39,284
It's the most secure building on
the island. It's where we keep the booze!

1110
01:27:42,893 --> 01:27:46,124
Look out, now.
Oh, oh-oh-oh! There you are!

1111
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,198
Baba-boobie!

1112
01:27:48,298 --> 01:27:51,165
- Peenalop!
- Juan!

1113
01:27:51,268 --> 01:27:53,930
Oh, God!

1114
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:57,564
Look, he's after us.
She's saferwith them. Let's go!

1115
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:00,967
Let's go!

1116
01:28:01,078 --> 01:28:03,046
Get the gate!

1117
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,319
Oh, God!

1118
01:28:18,428 --> 01:28:21,124
Oh, God! Nooo!

1119
01:28:21,231 --> 01:28:23,358
- Oh, God!
- Peenalop!

1120
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:26,732
- No! No!
- Peenalop! Peenalop!

1121
01:28:26,837 --> 01:28:29,067
Stop!

1122
01:28:29,173 --> 01:28:33,234
God! Stop it!
What are you doing?.

1123
01:28:33,343 --> 01:28:36,210
- you'll never make it!
- Sam! Please!

1124
01:28:36,313 --> 01:28:41,376
- God! What do you
think you're- - Watch out!

1125
01:28:41,485 --> 01:28:44,852
Harder! Harder!

1126
01:28:44,955 --> 01:28:48,891
She can't breathe!

1127
01:28:53,263 --> 01:28:55,356
Penelope! Get up.

1128
01:28:59,837 --> 01:29:04,331
- Ohh!
- Juan! Juan! Juan, get up!

1129
01:29:04,441 --> 01:29:06,534
Juan, get up.

1130
01:29:06,643 --> 01:29:10,739
Come on! Hurry! Come on!

1131
01:29:14,218 --> 01:29:16,049
Oh, God.

1132
01:29:16,153 --> 01:29:20,112
It's not a party until
someone breaks theJacuzzi.

1133
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:22,385
Oh, God! Juan!

1134
01:29:35,339 --> 01:29:38,308
- Lars!
- The Fun...

1135
01:29:38,408 --> 01:29:40,638
is done.

1136
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:46,308
What happened
to the hot tub?.

1137
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:08,238
Here we go!

1138
01:30:09,773 --> 01:30:11,764
Oh, God!

1139
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:15,936
- No!
- No, it's not possible!

1140
01:30:16,046 --> 01:30:18,241
- What do we do?.
- We can lose him in the jungle.

1141
01:30:18,348 --> 01:30:20,714
- The jungle?.
- I can get us through!

1142
01:30:25,255 --> 01:30:27,655
Come on!

1143
01:30:27,758 --> 01:30:30,090
- Hurry!
- Go, go, go, go!

1144
01:30:30,193 --> 01:30:34,186
I know where this goes!
Let's go! Come on, quickly!

1145
01:30:34,298 --> 01:30:36,596
Go!

1146
01:30:39,703 --> 01:30:42,968
Oh, God!
This was yourbigplan?

1147
01:30:43,073 --> 01:30:46,304
We can do it. It's high tide.
All right, now listen.

1148
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:49,277
I know this is going
to sound disgusting, but...

1149
01:30:49,379 --> 01:30:53,475
when you jump, keep your legs
together and clench your ass cheeks.

1150
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:57,383
Or else, waterwill fly up your butthole
and pulverize your intestine.

1151
01:30:57,487 --> 01:30:59,387
Gross!

1152
01:30:59,489 --> 01:31:01,218
Where are you?

1153
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:05,762
- I trust you,Juan.
- I'm coming! I'm coming!

1154
01:31:12,903 --> 01:31:16,002
Jesus!
Who is this girl?.

1155
01:31:16,106 --> 01:31:18,074
She's...

1156
01:31:18,175 --> 01:31:20,439
my girlfriend.

1157
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:46,325
- Did you see it?. - I
saw it. - Oh, my asshole!

1158
01:31:46,436 --> 01:31:49,030
- What did you see?.
- The RandyRumrunner.

1159
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:51,767
He didn't take it. He sunk it.

1160
01:31:51,875 --> 01:31:54,605
Juan, anyway you could
dive down and get the propeller off?.

1161
01:31:54,711 --> 01:31:57,271
We could put it
on the Smilin'Smuggler.

1162
01:31:57,381 --> 01:32:01,181
- Consider it done, my friend.
- Come on, let's go.

1163
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:24,798
Come on!

1164
01:32:26,877 --> 01:32:30,313
Juan!

1165
01:32:32,015 --> 01:32:35,678
- Come on.
- In the boat. In the boat.

1166
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:42,447
Oh, God!
Where the hell isJuan?

1167
01:32:42,559 --> 01:32:46,290
- Juan?. Juan?.
- Juan, where are you?

1168
01:32:50,867 --> 01:32:53,097
- Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
- It's okay.

1169
01:32:53,203 --> 01:32:56,036
- you should see the other hombre.
- I'll put it on.

1170
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:01,670
Come on.

1171
01:33:05,248 --> 01:33:07,307
Juan!

1172
01:33:09,386 --> 01:33:12,981
It's all right.
It's okay.

1173
01:33:13,090 --> 01:33:16,287
I cannot imagine
a more beautiful way to go.

1174
01:33:16,393 --> 01:33:20,454
Just remember, Peenalop.

1175
01:33:20,564 --> 01:33:23,465
I love you.
!Carajo de mierda!

1176
01:33:23,567 --> 01:33:25,967
I love you!

1177
01:33:26,069 --> 01:33:28,663
Maybe...

1178
01:33:28,772 --> 01:33:30,865
before I go...

1179
01:33:30,974 --> 01:33:32,942
one kiss.

1180
01:33:35,278 --> 01:33:37,678
No, no, no.

1181
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:41,046
I meant,
maybe you and Jenny could...

1182
01:33:41,151 --> 01:33:43,676
kiss each other.

1183
01:33:43,787 --> 01:33:46,051
I always...

1184
01:33:46,156 --> 01:33:48,386
wanted...

1185
01:33:48,492 --> 01:33:52,155
to see that.

1186
01:33:52,262 --> 01:33:55,698
- Oh, God!
- Juan!

1187
01:33:55,799 --> 01:33:58,290
Juan!

1188
01:34:23,193 --> 01:34:25,354
- Aargh!
- Come on!

1189
01:34:25,462 --> 01:34:30,058
Son of a bitch!

1190
01:34:38,842 --> 01:34:41,276
Go! Go,Jenny, go!

1191
01:34:44,648 --> 01:34:47,913
Whoo-whoo!

1192
01:34:51,154 --> 01:34:53,281
Shit!
Turn it, turn it!

1193
01:34:53,390 --> 01:34:55,950
- Lars, what are you doing?.
- Trust me.

1194
01:34:58,161 --> 01:35:00,152
- Lars, stop it!
- Come on, come on!

1195
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:04,359
Yeah!

1196
01:35:06,369 --> 01:35:08,769
- you're bringing us closer to the raft!
- I know.

1197
01:35:25,922 --> 01:35:28,652
Ahhhhhh!

1198
01:35:32,329 --> 01:35:34,695
Yeah!

1199
01:35:37,934 --> 01:35:40,300
- Slowly, slowly.
- Okay.

1200
01:35:42,672 --> 01:35:45,607
We gotta untie these lines.

1201
01:35:49,179 --> 01:35:52,979
Hit it,Jenny! Go!

1202
01:35:59,522 --> 01:36:01,649
- Ahhhhhh!
- Yeah!

1203
01:36:24,314 --> 01:36:27,010
Let's get the hell outta here.

1204
01:36:36,459 --> 01:36:39,519
- Come on!
- Oh, come on!

1205
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:47,900
Die!

1206
01:36:48,004 --> 01:36:49,904
Son ofa bitch!

1207
01:36:59,282 --> 01:37:01,807
They'll probably kick me
out ofthe Pacifist Club now.

1208
01:37:01,918 --> 01:37:04,250
Or at least
ask you nicely to leave.

1209
01:37:08,992 --> 01:37:11,085
Tian-tu-

1210
01:37:11,194 --> 01:37:13,856
the Heaven Point.

1211
01:37:13,963 --> 01:37:16,727
Oh.

1212
01:37:29,479 --> 01:37:32,277
Let's go, Peenalop.

1213
01:39:53,256 --> 01:39:56,350
Gracias, Sheriff!.

1214
01:39:58,528 --> 01:40:01,554
Cut it.

1215
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:04,258
- That is so whack!
- Knock that shit off,Juan.

1216
01:40:04,367 --> 01:40:06,392
you're gonna cause
a hysterical... thing.

1217
01:40:08,705 --> 01:40:13,438
That is so cheebah!
