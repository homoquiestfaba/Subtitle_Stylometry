[This movie is fictional, all persons, organizations, settings and so on are not real.]

2
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,290
Good work.

3
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,900
Hello.

4
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,860
I quit.

5
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,400
Someone was following me.

6
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,510
What do you mean? We have agreed on tomorrow morning.

7
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,510
I've already told you that I work alone, didn't I?

8
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Oh, yes. You're right.

9
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,180
So, who was it?

10
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,710
What?

11
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,580
He knew about me.

12
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,160
Kawamura is going to meet the journalist tomorrow, understood?

13
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,490
I don't have the time to entrust someone else with this.

14
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,920
Hey, Benny...

15
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,020
If you knew anything else, you would tell me, right?

16
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,360
I've already told you everything!

17
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,240
I'll contact you again.

18
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,830
Rain!

19
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,470
We've found him!

20
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,580
Kawamura is going to meet the journalist tomorrow, understood?
I don't have the time to entrust someone else with this.

21
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,620
Hey, Benny...

22
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,210
If you knew anything else, you would tell me, right?

23
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,850
I've already told you everything!

24
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,250
I'm not hiding anything from you.

25
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,190
Anyways, after you've finished your job, vanish into thin air, understood?

26
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,800
You have retired, haven't you?

27
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,330
I'll contact you again.

28
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,800
Morning.

29
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,060
Good morning.

30
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,540
What's that?

31
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,620
My pacemaker. The same as yesterday.

32
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm sorry. He's new here.

33
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,950
It's all right.

34
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,170
Yes.

35
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,330
Now I remember.

36
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,000
I've forgotten my keys at home.

37
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,540
And there's something I've put in the archive which I need now.

38
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,580
Could you lend me your key?

39
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,150
The archive?

40
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Is there a problem with that?

41
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,920
No.

42
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,890
But could you please leave your bag here?

43
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,350
Yes.

44
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,260
Thank you.

45
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,130
I'll walk.

46
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,540
I need to move my body more.

47
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,300
Are you all right?

48
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,910
Put him down, put him down. Get an ambulance.

49
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,640
An ambulance...

50
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,860
That's great...

51
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,860
Rich places are always overflowing with money.

52
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,090
And I have to live in poverty.

53
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm a police officer...

54
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,580
is anyone home?

55
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,380
If there's no one home, I'll come in myself.

56
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,990
I'm coming in!

57
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,020
That bastard... lived in such a big house...

58
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,930
When Kawamura left, where he went and which train he took.

59
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,560
They knew it.

60
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,800
They're trying to get the memory stick.

61
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,700
The content of the stick.

62
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,830
Kawamura didn't carry anything with him.

63
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,780
Have you searched through all his pockets?

64
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,610
Yes, all of them. There was nothing inside.

65
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,180
That's why they're all still searching for the stick.

66
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,340
Don't you understand?

67
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,490
Kawamura did not carry anything with him.

68
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,990
I couldn't get anything.

69
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,760
Last week, a known journalist contacted him.

70
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,930
If he knows anything, he'll spit it out.

71
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,170
A Japanese?

72
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,400
No, he's a foreigner, but his base is in Tokyo.

73
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,380
It seems, there are some bad rumors about Kawamura floating around.

74
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,550
Rumors? What kind of rumors?

75
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,510
They've told me I mustn't speak any further about it.

76
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,950
But he's dead anyways.

77
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,320
You know quite a lot.

78
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,330
Who are they?

79
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,770
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

80
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,030
They are from the CIA.

81
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,970
What?

82
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,670
You've heard me, right?

83
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm very sorry.

84
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,850
I'd really have preferred to hear better news from you.

85
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,610
Yamamoto has already told me about it.

86
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,890
I see it the same way as he does.

87
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,390
We've done everything in our power.

88
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,430
Tell me: What was the reason for his death?

89
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,240
If more bureaucrats are going to die...

90
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,340
rumors and speculations will spread.

91
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,740
It were 3 people within the last 14 months.

92
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,380
If we don't find any clues soon...

93
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,450
Yamamoto will lose his faith in us.

94
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,750
You understand, don't you?

95
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,180
Yes, I understand.

96
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,620
I want to hear a solution for this problem from Yamamoto immediately.

97
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,860
We'll do everything so, that it will correspond with the expectations of the governor...

98
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,870
We'll do everything in our power.

99
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm counting on you.

100
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,810
Thanks for your help.

101
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,380
Please visit me next time.

102
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,110
Oh, sure.

103
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,120
Please call Tattsuan.

104
00:22:24,464 --> 00:22:26,439
[Natural Death]

105
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,110
This... is the lobby of the Grand Hotel, right?

106
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,880
Yes, their chandelier is very characteristic...

107
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,720
And this?

108
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,580
The Park View Hotel.

109
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,700
What? You...

110
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,430
Are you just loitering in hotels all day long?

111
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,770
I sometimes take my wife out for dinner.

112
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,340
I was really surprised how big their lobby is.

113
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,710
If it was me...

114
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,140
I would've been more surprised about the expensive food.

115
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,080
Isn't there a note written on the picture where it was taken?

116
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,180
Tonami is new in the records department...

117
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,790
That guy's always busy, even though he has the same hairdo as you...

118
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,950
It seems, he doesn't even have time for work.

119
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,430
Why don't young people trim their hair nowadays?

120
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,460
This is the latest trend, Tattsuan.

121
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,660
Even when you're standing still, it's moving like this.

122
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,670
It's as if it's floating.

123
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,930
I see.

124
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,050
Hey, what do you think?

125
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,440
What do you mean?

126
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,550
Shimizu died because food blocked his trachea.

127
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,180
Yes, exactly.

128
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,380
And Ishikawa...

129
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,260
took too many sleeping pills.

130
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,460
What do you want to tell me?

131
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,960
Shimizu locked himself up in his hotel room...

132
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,090
So he was alone that night, just like Ishikawa when he died.

133
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,340
Which means...

134
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,370
The suffocation and the overuse of the sleeping pills...

135
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,110
happened in the same night...

136
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,340
while they were in their hotel rooms all alone.

137
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,450
Yes, here's the first investigation department.

138
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,350
The executive vice-president wants to talk to you.

139
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,690
I'm going to him right now.

140
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,230
What do you think?

141
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,960
I don't know yet.

142
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,690
They've died a natural death.

143
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,300
What about him?

144
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,270
He had a heart attack.

145
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,760
The CCTV recorded this yesterday.

146
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,900
He's a member of Yamamoto's team.

147
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,100
Such an ugly Yakuza in our parking lot...

148
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,740
What did he want from him?

149
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,310
Yamamoto seems to think...

150
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,570
that we must have noticed something by now.

151
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,650
Within the last 14 months, 3 bureaucrats have died.

152
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,950
All of them died a natural death.

153
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,390
Well, even if you would tell me to hand you over the culprit...

154
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,600
They all were government officials, tamed by that guy.

155
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,560
What do you want to say with that?

156
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:45,130
If I think about it, I believe they were killed.

157
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,400
We have no proof for that and there are no witnesses.

158
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,770
That's why you're going to investigate.

159
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,810
You want me to go out and find evidence?

160
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Somehow, I can't accept this.

161
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,380
Yamamoto is giving bribe money to some politicians...

162
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,220
Everyone knows that.

163
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,890
But we have to close our eyes anyhow.

164
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,530
But that's not all.

165
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,470
In the end, we police officers have to let them do as they please.

166
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,670
And sometimes we even have to protect them.

167
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,070
Executive vice-president...

168
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,400
Do you think all that can be called righteous?

169
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,940
It's called law.

170
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,950
That's nonsense!

171
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,410
Open your eyes.

172
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,180
There are situations where even our hands are tied.

173
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,500
When I was at interpol in London, there was a guy...

174
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,240
who falsely thought he could bend the law as he pleased.

175
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,700
He ran out out of luck as a cop, when it came to light.

176
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,820
And he started to think about it.

177
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:09,140
Just because of that he could...

178
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,720
save face in front of his dead father.

179
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,570
Bring me some evidence. As soon as possible.

180
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,370
I'm doing this business now since 35 years.

181
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,410
I'd like to say this is going to be easy, but...

182
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
Well... I'll try it.

183
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,020
I depend on you, Tattsuan.

184
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,750
Before all this is over...

185
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,780
you should be careful when you use your car.

186
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,560
Help.

187
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,170
They're trying to kill you.

188
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,670
This is related to your father.

189
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,680
They think your father...

190
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,580
gave something to you and because of that...

191
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,910
Don't get closer!

192
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,820
It's all right now.

193
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,090
My father said, he wanted to correct a mistake he made...

194
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,420
I understand.

195
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,510
It was right here.

196
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,810
Yes.

197
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,060
He got out of the train about here.

198
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,920
Here, yes?

199
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,820
Here?

200
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,820
Yes.

201
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,430
In which direction was he looking?

202
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,220
A bit more to the left.

203
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,200
Here.

204
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,430
Yes, I guess that's right.

205
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,470
Could you please show me the tape which was recorded from there?

206
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,040
Sure.

207
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:42,770
Erm... was it a famous person?

208
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,750
Who?

209
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,410
The person that died.

210
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,920
No, not really. Why?

211
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,580
Because this is the third time that police officers come here for investigation.

212
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,250
The third time?

213
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,380
Yes.

214
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,060
Well...

215
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,890
Could you please give me that tape?

216
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,170
It's my duty to give it to you.

217
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,560
Thank you.

218
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,140
I appreciate your efforts.

219
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,930
Hey, take turns!

220
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,540
Have you found the memory stick?

221
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,010
He anticipated us.

222
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,010
We've got taken by surprise, I'm afraid...

223
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,480
His daughter?

224
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,520
She's dead.

225
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,880
I don't care how you do it.

226
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,160
Go and search the memory stick.

227
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,260
Yes.

228
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,860
[Midori Kawamura]

229
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,050
Ladies and gentlemen...

230
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,750
After a break, we'll continue with...

231
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,550
a performance of Midori Kawamura. Please look forward to it.

232
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,830
Erm... excuse me please...

233
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,030
I'm Miyakawa from the Jazz Swing magazine.

234
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,900
That was a great performance.

235
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,900
Thank you very much.

236
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,840
The truth is, I want to...

237
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,970
write an article about Midori for the next issue.

238
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,400
I thought, maybe you could introduce me to her.

239
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,770
Please wait a moment.

240
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,570
Thank you very much.

241
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,150
That was superb!

242
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,010
Thanks.

243
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,980
Hey...

244
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:16,820
There's a journalist who wants to meet you.

245
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,860
This could be a good promotion for you.

246
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,480
Can't we do this after the performance?

247
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,560
But he said, he hasn't much time.

248
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,630
Hey, is he a nice person?

249
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,330
I'll call him.

250
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,900
Thank you for waiting. I've told her that you want to meet her.

251
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,410
This way, please.

252
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,980
Excuse me.

253
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,050
This is the journalist.

254
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,720
Midori Kawamura.

255
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,990
Nice to meet you.

256
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,410
Please try to finish this in 2 minutes.

257
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,690
The truth is, I'm not a journalist.

258
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,890
Your life is in danger. You should leave this place immediately.

259
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,430
What are you talking about?

260
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,680
Who are you?

261
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,550
Believe me. What I'm telling you...

262
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,380
No way! Sneaking in here and telling me lies...

263
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,580
Even if you tell me it's the truth...

264
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,950
We don't have time.

265
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,680
Erm... excuse me.

266
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,920
I'm a big fan of yours...

267
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,850
Could you please give me an autograph?

268
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:12,700
Let's go!

269
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,940
We need to hurry!

270
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,290
Can we get out from here?

271
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:35,360
I don't know!

272
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,230
He's here.

273
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,800
Hurry!

274
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,150
Hurry!

275
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,520
Who has sent you?

276
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,160
You tell me.

277
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,360
That's what I want to know.

278
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,630
Let's go.

279
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,970
Hey.

280
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,880
I've told you to come here...

281
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,650
I've told you not to get filmed by that camera.

282
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,360
I'm asking you to get away from there!

283
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:30,730
Let me go!

284
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,510
I've told you not to stand there.

285
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,070
Look!

286
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,610
Even though there's so much room...

287
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,800
Why do you need to stand there?

288
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,440
Why should I do what you tell me?

289
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,680
I don't even know who you are.

290
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,590
You're dragging me along all night...

291
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,560
Also, I don't like being ordered around!

292
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,360
You don't realize in what danger you are, do you?

293
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,060
I am trying to save you.

294
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,800
Like you've tried to save my sister?

295
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,730
Do you want to tell me that you've even tried to save my father?

296
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,610
If this is supposed to be a story, I've already read a lot of them.

297
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,950
So I already know the end of a story when I read its beginning.

298
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,420
What story?

299
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,550
Shall I tell you how this story will end?

300
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,330
I know it already.

301
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,300
You will be killed and that's it.

302
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,730
After everything that has happened, that wouldn't be strange.

303
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,750
Where are you going?

304
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm hungry.

305
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,200
Won't you eat?

306
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,210
I usually don't eat in the morning.

307
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,650
What?

308
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,040
You've ordered it, even though you don't want to eat it?

309
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,010
If you go there to the right, there's a police box.

310
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,220
You can go there if you want.

311
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:28,800
Hey...

312
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,470
Where are you going?

313
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,280
What?

314
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,420
Hey, are you listening?

315
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,510
So, you're safe now.

316
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,820
You think you would've made it here even without me, right?

317
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:44,070
[We're on patrol to create a nice town where you can live safely. - Police box of Rokkenmachi.]

318
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,330
3 people in 14 months.

319
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,600
While they were in the position of power, their connection with the Yakuza came to light.

320
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,330
Aren't you reading too much into it?

321
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,970
That's my job.

322
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:37,410
So, does that memory stick really exist?

323
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:38,880
I don't know.

324
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,250
But, these three people...

325
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:46,220
I have a feeling that they were all killed by the same person.

326
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,960
What if there's a professional killer who makes the murders look like they were natural deaths...

327
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,630
If it looks like natural death and not murder, no one would investigate properly.

328
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,630
He must be really good. That man...

329
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,230
It's not impossible.

330
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,440
If this was the case, then the murderer....

331
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,480
must have been in the same car as Kawamura.

332
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:14,980
If there was such a guy...

333
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:17,920
isn't he just killing corrupt bureaucrats one after another?

334
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,790
Working overtime everyday. Just like us, huh?

335
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,800
[Natural death]

336
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,640
What happened to your little sister is very unfortunate.

337
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,180
I don't want to talk about my sister.

338
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:31,330
What you've done to that man...

339
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,130
Who are you?

340
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:41,210
Sometimes I get hired to save people....

341
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,140
So you've got hired to save me, too?

342
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:50,410
No, I thought it was necessary to save you.

343
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,250
Is this related to my father?

344
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,220
Yes, right.

345
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,720
I don't know anything about my father's work.

346
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,770
They don't think that.

347
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,170
Why don't you answer?

348
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,110
Pretend like it wouldn't ring.

349
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:21,540
What?

350
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,910
Do what I'm telling you.

351
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,750
Pretend that we're a couple.

352
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,920
That means, if I had been home too, I would've been killed like my sister.

353
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,890
So...

354
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:10,050
you're telling me, that the only reason...

355
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,220
I was saved is because I wasn't home that time?

356
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:14,760
If you don't want to waste your life now after it was saved...

357
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:16,390
you should open your eyes.

358
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,730
What do you mean?

359
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,270
Didn't you listen?

360
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,200
Yes, I did!

361
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:24,870
My sister was killed...

362
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,340
My father died three weeks before that. So I'm the next...

363
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,640
Stop it!

364
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:31,810
There are people...

365
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,820
who just want to kill you for money.

366
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,120
There's only one thing they care about:

367
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,950
Killing you and finishing their job. That's all.

368
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,600
They're waiting patiently for that one chance.

369
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,800
If that was my job, it would already be finished.

370
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:00,100
Earlier, there was a deliverer passing right next to you.

371
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,240
Do you know what he was delivering?

372
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,810
He was carrying a few cardboards.

373
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,120
You didn't even see such big things?

374
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:19,920
And do you remember those three construction workers?

375
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,570
One of them was holding a hammer.

376
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,470
He was looking at you all the time.

377
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,080
But because your head is just full of talking and yourself...

378
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,450
you didn't realize even that.

379
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,950
Do you even understand in what danger you are?

380
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,530
Are you sure you don't want to die?

381
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,070
Do you need my help?

382
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,250
Try it, then.

383
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,880
There are three men behind me getting closer.

384
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,790
If one of them was holding a knife, who would it be?

385
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,420
The man in the middle.

386
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,870
Come.

387
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,950
There's an amazing amount of CCTV all throughout Tokyo.

388
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:48,750
But they don't really know where we are.

389
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,580
They need about...

390
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,490
six hours to find our true whereabouts...

391
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,490
by reference to the images from the CCTV.

392
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:59,260
That's why we have to move on.

393
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,970
We need to take care not to take the same route twice.

394
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,930
The entrance of a subway...

395
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,870
A convenience store...

396
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,140
They're searching for us thoroughly...

397
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,390
Especially in places where we don't need to reveal our identity.

398
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,590
Churches...
