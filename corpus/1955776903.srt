2
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:29,421
Agamemnon calls you for
a war council.

3
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,823
I shall join you.

4
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:36,660
Give me one more moment.

5
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:40,198
<i>Tell me, oh, muse,
of that ingenious hero</i>

6
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,933
<i>who traveled far and wide
after he sacked</i>

7
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:45,535
<i>the famous town of Troy.</i>

8
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,939
<i>After 10 years of
Agamemnon's bloody siege,</i>

9
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,942
<i>it is only wise Odysseus
who could bring down</i>

10
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>the golden civilization.</i>

11
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:36,419
I love you, Penelope,
my little Bastet cat.

12
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,491
I love you more than
the air, and the wind.

13
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:45,862
I love you more
than life itself.

14
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:51,371
And I you, my handsome
husband, my pirate.

15
00:02:57,776 --> 00:03:00,778
He's strong like his father.

16
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,448
We shall name him Telemachus,
to a great warrior.

17
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,019
Oh, better to teach him
how to use his mind

18
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:12,288
like his father does.

19
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,260
It is Agamemnon.

20
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,531
It is too soon.

21
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,899
When he calls to war,

22
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,837
it is my duty
to fight alongside him.

23
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,276
In the name of Athenae,
promise me you will come back.

24
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,546
That is up to the gods.

25
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,815
But I do promise, as long
as there is breath

26
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:42,719
left in my lungs, I shall
strive to return to you.

27
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,489
The time for
bedding your wife is over.

28
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,391
It's time to prepare for war.

29
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,865
Should I not return,

30
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:59,671
give this to my son
when he becomes king.

31
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,876
Oh. Wait.

32
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,584
May the gods give you fortune.

33
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,855
Goodbye, my love.

34
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,524
The next time you see her,
your name will be sculpted

35
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,495
in the stones of history.

36
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,630
I wouldn't worry
about your wife.

37
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:29,699
With your Ithacan troops
and my Greek forces,

38
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:32,603
we'll have over 1,000 ships.
Troy will fall.

39
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,774
You'll be home in a month.

40
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:40,209
Oh!

41
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,747
Ohh!

42
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:46,117
Ohh! Ohh!

43
00:04:57,963 --> 00:05:00,130
King Agamemnon!

44
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,365
We must return home.

45
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,300
The Trojan wall
cannot be penetrated.

46
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:04,601
I'll never surrender!

47
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:08,706
I'm a cuckold on
this flamboyant nation!

48
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,142
My Helen, my bride,
my property,

49
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:16,613
lies with the dirtiest,
slimiest creature of them all.

50
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,017
We cannot breach the gates
with a frontal attack.

51
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,652
If it is your wish to die to
quell your shame, Agamemnon,

52
00:05:23,654 --> 00:05:26,723
then why don't you charge
the wall like your men

53
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:30,327
and face the slings and arrows
of these flamboyant Trojans?

54
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,863
Achilles, I am a king.

55
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:37,868
- It's 10 years of war!
- The gods must love you so.

56
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,771
If the gods loved me,
I'd be home with my wife.

57
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:45,341
Maybe if you fought with
your heart and your testicles!

58
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,445
Stop! Stop! Stop!

59
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,413
The wall is impenetrable!

60
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:53,317
I see the Trojans ride
in and out all day!

61
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,553
If they can do it,
so can we!

62
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,486
Is there a brain
inside that head?

63
00:05:57,488 --> 00:05:58,824
Achilles...

64
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:03,159
...he does make
a good argument.

65
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:06,329
And you've lost your
brain as well?

66
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,632
No.

67
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:12,336
We have to figure a way
to get in with the Trojans.

68
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,474
And how do you suggest
we do that?

69
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,110
Perhaps there is a way.

70
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,378
The Trojans are
a vain people, yes?

71
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,981
Extremely vain.

72
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:28,618
They build these statues
and put them in their plazas.

73
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,553
They love their statues,
their trophies.

74
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:33,957
They use them to signify
their greatness.

75
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,125
What if...

76
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:39,564
we were to give them a trophy
they could not resist?

77
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,867
It would have to be
a very large trophy.

78
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,902
One that would flatter
them the most.

79
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,904
Exactly.

80
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,539
- What?
- What are you talking about?

81
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,611
Speak plainly.

82
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:58,081
Agamemnon, if I open
the gates of Troy

83
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:01,550
to your army,
might I return home

84
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,055
and never be forced
to war again?

85
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,125
If you bring
the destruction of Troy,

86
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,793
I promise you as a king

87
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,800
you can go home to Ithaca
with your family in peace.

88
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,774
- We have a plan!
- Men?

89
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,553
We have been
walking forever.

90
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,822
Where is this great thing
you speak of?

91
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,227
It is just ahead,
Your Majesty.

92
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:59,579
An offering?

93
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:04,548
The Greeks have
fled like cowards!

94
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,750
A gift from the Greeks
cannot be trusted.

95
00:08:07,752 --> 00:08:09,151
Let's burn it at the temple

96
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,221
and invoke the curse
of the Kraken.

97
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:15,692
And then may all these
Greeks sink and drown.

98
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,694
No, Circe.

99
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:21,701
We will leave the
Greeks to their shame.

100
00:08:24,235 --> 00:08:28,072
Order your man to drag
this trophy into my city

101
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:33,645
so we may celebrate
our victory around it.

102
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,283
Do as the king instructs!

103
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:52,362
- The Kraken!
- Do you hear that?

104
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,531
It's only a legend.

105
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,066
They say the monster
would never harm any Trojan,

106
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,969
but mercilessly
will hunt every Greek.

107
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,576
Silence your tongue or
I'll take it from your mouth.

108
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:09,548
If we succeed, Aesus,
we may return home.

109
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,801
We approach a gate!

110
00:09:31,937 --> 00:09:35,338
I have never seen such
gold and jewels.

111
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,473
And soon, it will be ours.

112
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,343
Beware your greed.

113
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:42,179
Your wandering eye
could get us killed.

114
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,547
Focus on your sword,
the gods, and nothing more.

115
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,551
The hell with the gods!

116
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,359
Hail Priam, King of Troy.

117
00:09:57,361 --> 00:10:00,296
See the gift from
the villainous Greeks.

118
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:03,367
The gods honor you,
great King.

119
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,435
Great Apollo, God of the Sun,

120
00:10:06,437 --> 00:10:10,973
take this offering
and bring us fortune.

121
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:16,112
Long live Priam, bearer
of the sword of Troy!

122
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,480
To Troy!

123
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,815
- To Troy!
- To Troy!

124
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,654
To Troy! To Troy!

125
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,963
The Trojans feast as if
they won the Olympics.

126
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,299
When shall we spring our trap?

127
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,467
We must wait until
their merriment

128
00:10:37,469 --> 00:10:40,103
takes them into deep slumber.

129
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,704
You should have more respect
for an opponent

130
00:10:41,706 --> 00:10:44,306
who has bested our men
for so many years.

131
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:47,076
That's why I take pleasure
with their demise.

132
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,377
Shh!

133
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,713
Aesus, you are young.

134
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:53,315
We kill because
it is our duty.

135
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:56,154
You should not take
pleasure from it.

136
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:48,307
Come on.

137
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,666
You have done me
a great deed,

138
00:12:17,668 --> 00:12:20,637
Odysseus,
King of Ithaca.

139
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,305
I've done what you asked.

140
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,809
Let us finish off the Trojans
so I may return home.

141
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:28,712
Let us take our glory.

142
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,617
Stop him! Charge!

143
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,327
Father, the gate is open!

144
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,429
- The Greeks!
- I knew we could not trust them!

145
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:49,932
Unleash the Kraken, my Lord,
and teach these Greeks a lesson.

146
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:53,070
The monster has never been
unleashed before!

147
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,504
It will destroy everything!

148
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:58,742
No. The Kraken will not harm
a single Trojan.

149
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,076
It will destroy itself
before it does.

150
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,379
I beg you!
Release the Kraken

151
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,515
and teach these
barbarians a lesson!

152
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,219
Save your people!

153
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,924
- To arms!
- The Greek horde is upon us!

154
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:18,395
Circe, lead me to the Kraken.

155
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,331
This way, my Lord.

156
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,870
Defend your home,
and your bride.

157
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,777
Helen, you adulterous whore!

158
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:38,149
I'll have your head on a spike
in my ornament room!

159
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:00,338
I'd forgotten...
how beautiful you are.

160
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,786
My city!

161
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:18,488
Do not look.

162
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,756
Unleash the Kraken

163
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:22,492
and you will have
your vengeance.

164
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,932
Sisters, the hour of
death is upon us!

165
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:39,843
Only you can do this,
good King,

166
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:44,016
and summoning the creature
requires a mighty sacrifice.

167
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,321
We must fight!

168
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,608
- Stop!
- Do not do this!

169
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,511
The Kraken is a beast
before the gods!

170
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,583
You could destroy
the entire earth!

171
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:25,123
Who is this Greek who dares
to topple my treasured walls?

172
00:15:26,924 --> 00:15:30,225
I am Odysseus,
King of Ithaca.

173
00:15:30,227 --> 00:15:34,730
Odysseus, King of Ithaca,
I curse you

174
00:15:34,732 --> 00:15:36,800
and all who follow you!

175
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,368
Your wife will marry another.

176
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,204
Your son will die
without a throne,

177
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:47,376
and none of you Ithacans
will ever reach home!

178
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:50,012
I do not believe
in your curses.

179
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,415
You mindless Greek!

180
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:57,186
If you ever step foot in Ithaca,
it will be destroyed!

181
00:15:57,188 --> 00:16:01,958
Hear me, great Kraken!
Make this curse true!

182
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,004
Can you see your
doom approaching?

183
00:16:16,006 --> 00:16:18,109
Your doom is a fiction.

184
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,382
I will see you in hell.

185
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,050
Ah!

186
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,066
No! Achilles!

187
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,567
Drop your weapon.

188
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,271
Aesus, take her!

189
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,874
My friend, we'll get
you to the boat.

190
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:27,242
Go, Odysseus.

191
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:30,114
Take your men and go home.

192
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:35,753
To the gods, I have killed
the invincible Achilles!

193
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,991
- To the gods!
- You cannot kill a Trojan!

194
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:47,229
As long as she is with us,
you cannot harm us!

195
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,632
- Take me with you.
- Kill me.

196
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,133
It won't make a difference.

197
00:17:51,135 --> 00:17:52,567
You retreat into the sea,

198
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,005
straight into the legendary
Kraken's domain.

199
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,743
Enough of your legends
and curses!

200
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,017
Go, Odysseus.

201
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,454
But forget me not.

202
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,236
Do not mourn your friend.

203
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,740
You'll be joining
him soon enough.

204
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,942
I shall not dread the day

205
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,709
when my name shall be etched

206
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,447
in history alongside
the great Achilles.

207
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,682
Do not be so certain,
cursed king!

208
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:42,820
You will never see your
precious Ithaca again!

209
00:18:50,193 --> 00:18:52,260
Look at your men
quake with fear.

210
00:18:52,262 --> 00:18:54,631
These are the men
you fight to protect?

211
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,364
What was that earthquake?

212
00:18:56,366 --> 00:18:58,601
The city has fallen,
Eurylochus.

213
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,640
Troy is burning.
Take us home.

214
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,537
By Zeus, what is this plague
that is following us?

215
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,278
- It is a Kraken!
- You are all doomed!

216
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,620
How do we defeat
such a thing?

217
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,588
It cannot harm us
as long as we have

218
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,260
this Trojan priestess
as our shield!

219
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,937
You cannot have me
by your side forever, Greek.

220
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:11,307
The Kraken will follow
for all eternity...

221
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:13,909
until you and
your kingdom are dead!

222
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:17,145
Quiet, Trojan witch!

223
00:20:17,147 --> 00:20:19,181
Forward, Eurylochus!

224
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:21,883
As fast as the wind
will take us!

225
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:23,721
Let us leave this place!

226
00:20:27,057 --> 00:20:30,058
- Drink up, men.
- The war is over,

227
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,062
but the king does not return.

228
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,498
Eventually, the widower queen
will give up her delusions

229
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,499
and take a new husband.

230
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:41,003
Until then, best make
yourselves comfortable.

231
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,439
This is our kingdom now.

232
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,977
Queen, come and serve us,
the best remaining men!

233
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,182
To a new reign in Ithaca!

234
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:05,161
Your yearning is wasted,

235
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:07,598
for a dead king
cannot hear you.

236
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:10,798
Mindless brute.

237
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,834
I should toss out
the lot of you.

238
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:15,238
And toss out the support
of the most powerful

239
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,872
families in Ithaca?

240
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,240
Would you deprive
your bastard son

241
00:21:18,242 --> 00:21:19,875
of both a father
and a kingdom?

242
00:21:19,877 --> 00:21:21,710
Tread carefully.

243
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:24,680
You are still a guest
in my home.

244
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:29,317
When my husband returns,
he'll teach you manners.

245
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,786
<i>If</i> your husband returns.

246
00:21:31,788 --> 00:21:35,824
Until then, we demand
your hospitality.

247
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,796
As you wish.

248
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,436
Oh, and you need more wine.

249
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,007
Our cups are running dry.

250
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:13,863
We've been searching
these seas for months.

251
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:16,333
Still not one
recognizable landmark.

252
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,066
We could be completely off
this map.

253
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,869
Are we not heading west
towards the sun?

254
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,904
I steer us west,
but we go east.

255
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,109
I steer us north,
but we go south.

256
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,277
I fear there's
some magic afoot.

257
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:31,748
It's Priam's curse.

258
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,216
Don't talk of curses, Aesus.

259
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,021
Only make things worse.

260
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,658
Bread. King.

261
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:43,292
I'm sorry, my Lord.

262
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:45,061
That's all we got left.

263
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,930
How many days provisions
do we have left?

264
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,566
None. All that remains
is worms and maggots.

265
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,668
I will not eat
before my men.

266
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,836
If there's enough at nightfall,
I will eat then.

267
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:57,806
Have you seen any sign of
the Kraken, Old Thelonious?

268
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:02,311
- No, my Lord.
- Not since the maelstrom.

269
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:04,180
It's all gone, I think.

270
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,518
Let us hope.

271
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:09,988
Priestess?

272
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:14,489
- Priestess?
- Of what temple now?

273
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,691
You mock me with such a title.

274
00:23:16,693 --> 00:23:18,326
Then what shall I call you?

275
00:23:18,328 --> 00:23:20,930
I am Circe.

276
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,498
I'm Odysseus.

277
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,833
I know who you are.

278
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:27,870
Your name has been
cursed forever.

279
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:29,771
Are you going
to tie me up again?

280
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,440
Are you going to try to
leap over the boat again?

281
00:23:32,442 --> 00:23:34,177
And where would I be
leaping to?

282
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,846
Troy is gone.
My people are no more.

283
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:41,049
And where is my protector,
the Kraken?

284
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:43,686
This is all I have,
a whole new world.

285
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,455
This boat,
and the air I breathe.

286
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,091
Nothing more.

287
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,160
Here. Eat.

288
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,661
Why do you offer me
such kindness?

289
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:54,229
You owe me nothing.

290
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:56,297
The war is over, Circe.

291
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:59,035
We are no longer enemies.

292
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,840
Eat this.
It is the last piece.

293
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,410
We need provisions.

294
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:11,145
Do you know these waters?

295
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:14,650
Even if I knew these waters,
why would I help you?

296
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:18,586
You destroyed my city and
stole me out to sea.

297
00:24:18,588 --> 00:24:20,355
And you put a
curse on my name.

298
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:22,057
War has made us equals.

299
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:24,895
I guess we will suffer
through this alone.

300
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:29,364
We should throw that
Trojan bitch into the sea!

301
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:31,033
No.

302
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,803
We need her for protection in
case the Kraken should return.

303
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,074
Besides, I think there's
some good in her.

304
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:42,678
Out here, there are no Trojans.
There are no Greeks.

305
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,247
We are all orphans of the sea.

306
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:47,415
She is one of us now.

307
00:24:47,417 --> 00:24:49,687
Land ho!

308
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:54,489
A rose pink island.

309
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,824
This is strange.

310
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,259
What could make an
island turn that color?

311
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:00,429
Old Thelonious, have you
ever seen such a place?

312
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:02,033
No, my Lord.

313
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,434
An island of pink flowers.

314
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:09,572
Pink flowers on
an island seen...

315
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,173
The Siren's call
is like a dream.

316
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:14,610
They'll tell you what
you want to hear...

317
00:25:14,612 --> 00:25:17,712
To solve your quest,
but you must fear.

318
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,981
The knowledge gave will
bring your fall...

319
00:25:19,983 --> 00:25:22,450
You must beware
the Siren's call.

320
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:24,821
Sirens.

321
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,789
It's an old poem my mother
used to sing to me.

322
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,426
Sirens seduce men
with their song

323
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:35,331
and if a man hears it,
he cannot help but go to them...

324
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,664
and he pays with his life.

325
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,133
Sirens are a myth.

326
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,635
No, they are as real
as you and I.

327
00:25:40,637 --> 00:25:43,905
And if you have a question and
ask them, they will answer it,

328
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:45,708
for they know all things.

329
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,579
But you will be lost forever.

330
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,013
<i>Come.</i>

331
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:54,315
<i>Come to us, brave Odysseus.</i>

332
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:56,552
Did you hear that?

333
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,886
What?

334
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,690
<i>We will tell you
what you need to know.</i>

335
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:04,663
<i>We will tell you the way home.</i>

336
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:07,630
I wish to sail close
to the island

337
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,565
so I can hear
the Sirens' song.

338
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,400
But your men will die.

339
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:13,803
We must find a way home.

340
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,338
We will plug the men's ears
with wax.

341
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,840
Eurylochus, throw me a rope.

342
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,508
You will tie me to the mast

343
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,278
and we will sail
towards the island.

344
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:27,583
This is madness.

345
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,617
I must return my men at home.

346
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:32,854
Tie me.
Tighter.

347
00:26:32,856 --> 00:26:34,989
Listen to me, men!

348
00:26:34,991 --> 00:26:37,226
Cover your ears with
wax until

349
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,728
we are past the island
of the sirens.

350
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,863
Only I shall hear their call.

351
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,798
No matter what I say or what
I do, do not untie me.

352
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,302
Not until we are well
past the island

353
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:49,270
and then, only then,
can you undo my ropes.

354
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:50,873
Let one of the
other men do this.

355
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:54,943
- No.
- I must do this myself.

356
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:57,313
- I am a woman...
- safe from their song.

357
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,481
I will stay by your side.

358
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,049
Very well.

359
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:04,688
Forgive me for what
you are about to see.

360
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:13,563
Do you hear anything,
my Lord?

361
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,266
I am not sure.

362
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:19,700
- <i>Odysseus?</i>
- <i>Odysseus?</i>

363
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:22,238
<i>We have been waiting for you.</i>

364
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
<i>We have a message.</i>

365
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:27,409
<i>Love waits, love waits.</i>

366
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:29,679
<i>Love waits for no man.</i>

367
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,449
<i>Take it, seize it...
you are mighty.</i>

368
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:36,517
<i>There is a wealth of
love abounding here.</i>

369
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,921
<i>Love, sweet love.</i>

370
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:43,092
<i>We will tell you all.
We know everything.</i>

371
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,126
Tell me what I need to know!

372
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:49,398
- <i>Penelope.</i>
- <i>Penelope awaits.</i>

373
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,366
<i>Ithaca awaits you.</i>

374
00:27:52,836 --> 00:27:55,237
Tell me the way home!

375
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:58,373
<i>The Paths of the Dead,
to the paths...</i>

376
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,941
<i>and then to Ithaca.</i>

377
00:27:59,943 --> 00:28:03,944
<i>A long voyage to the south,
to the east...</i>

378
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:05,913
<i>where no sun rises.</i>

379
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,818
<i>To the Paths,
to Penelope, to love.</i>

380
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,055
- No!
- Not the Paths of the Dead, no.

381
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:14,390
There must be another way!

382
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,292
- The Paths of the Dead?
- That cannot be!

383
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,293
Siren, please tell me
another way!

384
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:21,163
<i>Now you know, now you know.</i>

385
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:23,999
<i>It is time to pay
for this knowledge.</i>

386
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,768
<i>With love, oh, beauteous love.</i>

387
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:32,009
<i>Come to me, come,
my Odysseus, my husband.</i>

388
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,411
- Untie me!
- Untie me!

389
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:38,046
I say, please, untie me!
She is here!

390
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,948
- She's not here.
- It is just a dream.

391
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,183
No! She's here.

392
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:44,187
She is there!
She was just there!

393
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,555
- Ignore them.
- They are only voices!

394
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:48,224
<i>Come to me, my love.</i>

395
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,727
<i>My body needs
the fire within you.</i>

396
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:55,264
- Circe, I made a mistake...
- <i>Kiss me, taste me,</i>

397
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,597
- <i>love me.</i>
- Untie me.

398
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:57,599
I do not need these ropes.

399
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:59,235
I know the way home!

400
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,269
You calm yourself,
King of Ithaca!

401
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,840
They show you only delusions!

402
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:05,574
<i>Do not leave me here alone!</i>

403
00:29:05,576 --> 00:29:07,008
<i>Do not leave me!</i>

404
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,944
<i>Come to us.</i>

405
00:29:08,946 --> 00:29:12,414
<i>We will set you free.
We will set you free.</i>

406
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,882
God!

407
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:15,418
<i>I love you, my sweet husband!</i>

408
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,719
- <i>Odysseus...</i>
- <i>Come to me!</i>

409
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,789
Please take my soul!
Penelope!

410
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:24,526
Take my men, take my ship!
Take my kingdom!

411
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:28,631
Just free me and allow me
to be with my love!

412
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,499
Free me, please!

413
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:31,834
Steer us from this island

414
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,702
or your king's mind
will be lost!

415
00:29:33,704 --> 00:29:35,136
Penelope!

416
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:38,308
I will come for you!
I will come for you!

417
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:40,742
No, Odysseus!

418
00:29:40,744 --> 00:29:42,844
Stop, Odysseus!

419
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,680
Stop it!

420
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,449
- We dare not give chase!
- The current is strong here,

421
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:48,650
we risk shipwreck!

422
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:50,318
Then we go for him.

423
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,719
Swim.

424
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:54,222
You, stay if you like.

425
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:57,028
He's lost without me!

426
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:28,190
Welcome, heroic Odysseus.

427
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:31,563
I've been waiting for you.

428
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,174
Ah, the beautiful Penelope.

429
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:49,911
How nice of you
to grace your loyal subjects

430
00:30:49,913 --> 00:30:51,345
with your presence.

431
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:55,150
Go home, I beg you!

432
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:56,919
My husband will be angered
to find his house

433
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:58,688
packed full when he arrives.

434
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,426
Your husband is dead.

435
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,995
And for the sake of your
kingdom and your son,

436
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,529
you must choose
a new husband.

437
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,765
A new king!

438
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:13,067
- Odysseus is alive.
- I feel it.

439
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:15,237
And until you can
prove otherwise,

440
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:18,373
I will remain
faithful to him.

441
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,842
How long do you think
the people will hold out

442
00:31:20,844 --> 00:31:22,444
without a proper king?

443
00:31:22,446 --> 00:31:24,979
You and your son have long
lived off

444
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:26,414
the fond memories
of Odysseus.

445
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:28,183
But it would not take long
to convince them

446
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,853
that the Royal Family
is crazy with grief

447
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,423
and unfit to rule.

448
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:35,660
You are right.

449
00:31:37,426 --> 00:31:43,097
Before I choose, I must weave
a proper wedding shawl

450
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:46,168
so that the gods may
bless the union.

451
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,771
And when it is finished,
I will choose a new husband.

452
00:31:49,773 --> 00:31:51,273
Are you satisfied?

453
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:55,947
I will be when I'm inside
your marriage bed.

454
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,565
Am I alive?

455
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:21,238
Yes, you are,
great warrior.

456
00:32:23,173 --> 00:32:25,242
It's time to rest.

457
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:30,415
Here... eat.

458
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:46,862
Tell me who you are again.

459
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:51,336
I am the one who saved
you from your mortal life.

460
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:55,239
Where is my wife?

461
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,376
I am your wife now.

462
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:06,582
You're a man amongst boys,
the greatest living hero.

463
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,917
You should be a god.

464
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,622
Do you wish to be a god?

465
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:25,769
No.

466
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,508
Every human wishes
to be a god.

467
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,490
What's wrong, my dear one?

468
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:50,028
You do not care for me.

469
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:54,664
No. I do love you.

470
00:33:57,067 --> 00:34:00,768
But I also love
my mortal life.

471
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,340
I love my wife.

472
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:07,311
I love the son
who I've never met.

473
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,583
I want to return
to the life I had before.

474
00:34:15,552 --> 00:34:20,222
I offer you eternal bliss.

475
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:24,495
You reject me as if
I were a mortal wench.

476
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:32,367
Do you want to make an enemy
of god, mortal Odysseus?

477
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:37,608
To turn my fury against
you and your crew?

478
00:34:39,543 --> 00:34:40,811
No.

479
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:46,847
Now kiss me.

480
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,752
Kiss me.

481
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,001
You may enter.

482
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,807
My Lady?

483
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:14,041
I'm not your lady.

484
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:15,879
Not yet.

485
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:19,748
Very nice.

486
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,652
Very nice indeed.

487
00:35:23,786 --> 00:35:25,322
What do you want?

488
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,025
How is it that I was here
a fortnight back

489
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:32,696
and that shroud
has barely grown?

490
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,597
It wasn't quite right.

491
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,001
And I had to make changes.

492
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,503
A proper shroud takes
a great deal of time.

493
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:46,143
Otherwise, the union
will offend the gods.

494
00:35:48,144 --> 00:35:50,412
Well, don't take too long.

495
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:55,483
The people talk.
They desire a king.

496
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:57,587
And I can't wait
to see it on you.

497
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:03,460
Although taking it off you
will be even sweeter.

498
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:07,862
Mmm.

499
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:11,401
I so do love the smell
of that perfume.

500
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:13,969
You have a great deal
to prove

501
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,340
before you're fit
to be a king, Antinoos!

502
00:36:19,643 --> 00:36:21,842
Of course.

503
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:23,711
I'll be downstairs
with the others

504
00:36:23,713 --> 00:36:26,847
enjoying your hospitality
if you need me,

505
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:29,420
widowed queen of Ithaca.

506
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:55,077
Please, Athenae, bring
my pirate back to me.

507
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,449
Tell me, show me what to do.

508
00:37:09,226 --> 00:37:11,525
Is my husband truly dead?

509
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,095
Reveal your wisdom to me.

510
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:16,634
Odysseus, where are you?

511
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,834
<i>Your husband lives,</i>

512
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:21,101
<i>Queen of Ithaca.</i>

513
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:22,737
<i>He is cursed,</i>

514
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:25,173
<i>lost in a world
you cannot touch</i>

515
00:37:25,175 --> 00:37:28,344
<i>that only the
Paths of the Dead can find.</i>

516
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,378
<i>His heart is controlled
by another.</i>

517
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,048
<i>The goddess Calypso
traps King Odysseus</i>

518
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,516
<i>with her possessive love.</i>

519
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,019
No! How can I believe that?

520
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:40,421
<i>I bring you only
the truth you seek.</i>

521
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:42,559
Odysseus?

522
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,861
Are my games not exciting?

523
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:26,304
Are the deaths of my enemies
not enough to make you happy?

524
00:38:28,405 --> 00:38:30,574
Death is never entertaining.

525
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,884
How long have
I been here with you?

526
00:38:43,586 --> 00:38:48,458
For us, it feels like
no time has passed.

527
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,802
This is the price of living
in the mortal realm.

528
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:04,972
- And my wife?
- What of her?

529
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:06,842
Does she still live?

530
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,514
Why do you ask such things?

531
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:15,819
[snarling

532
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:26,364
- If you love me...
- you will tell me.

533
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:34,538
She lives. And your son, too.

534
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,876
Though many years have passed.

535
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:47,784
You make me so sad,
cruel Odysseus.

536
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,922
Ah!

537
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:17,945
My favorite part!

538
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:28,923
This is what happens to those

539
00:40:28,925 --> 00:40:32,563
who don't love me as you do.

540
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:36,565
Is this not exciting?

541
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:42,037
The Warrior of Shadows
has never been defeated.

542
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,606
He must be part god,

543
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:49,013
for no mortal man can fight
as well as this.

544
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:53,715
I can.

545
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:56,985
Of course, my love.

546
00:40:56,987 --> 00:41:00,523
But you will soon be immortal.

547
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:06,528
Then no one will be able
to stand against you.

548
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,133
I do not wish to be immortal.

549
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,601
- You are with me...
- forever, my love.

550
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:17,438
You have no choice now.

551
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,340
If there is no death,

552
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:23,478
then life is a journey
without destination.

553
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,583
Do not be silly.

554
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:36,958
Eat. You'll forget
your woes...

555
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,526
and all will be well again.

556
00:41:39,528 --> 00:41:41,632
I do not wish to eat!

557
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:45,534
I want to return to the truth,

558
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,670
to mortality. <i>Please.</i>

559
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,838
Give me this gift.

560
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,878
Allow me to face
my mortal death.

561
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,546
So be it.

562
00:41:58,548 --> 00:42:00,648
Go and die.

563
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:06,086
Leave me alone... forever...
and die.

564
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:10,691
I shall fight
the Shadow Warrior!

565
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:16,800
I choose no weapon.

566
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:22,838
I wish to meet my end without
another death upon my soul.

567
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,008
Kill me.

568
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:29,110
Kill me with one slice
of your blade.

569
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,014
Let it be done.

570
00:42:33,516 --> 00:42:35,450
You must fight, Odysseus!

571
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,751
Fight!

572
00:42:36,753 --> 00:42:39,222
I want to die!

573
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,559
Please, mighty warrior,
have mercy on my soul.

574
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:48,429
Send me to the underground where
I may wait for my true love.

575
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:51,201
Please do it quickly.

576
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:57,706
I will not kill you,
Odysseus.

577
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,775
- Kill him!
- Kill him now!

578
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:02,244
I will not!

579
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,845
I'm a priestess immune
from your witchcraft.

580
00:43:04,847 --> 00:43:09,284
- How dare you!
- I'm the queen of this land

581
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,351
and I will have vengeance!

582
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:13,121
Stop! Stop!

583
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,521
Calypso, please!

584
00:43:14,523 --> 00:43:17,825
If you have one ounce
of true love in your heart,

585
00:43:17,827 --> 00:43:19,461
you will not do this.

586
00:43:28,204 --> 00:43:32,141
You will leave
me alone... forever.

587
00:43:33,443 --> 00:43:35,346
I am sorry.

588
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:40,050
I must face my own fate.

589
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,983
Where are my men?

590
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:45,286
I know where your men are.

591
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,057
They are under the same
witchcraft as you.

592
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,229
- How do I break the spell?
- Tell me.

593
00:43:54,063 --> 00:43:55,396
Tell me.

594
00:44:04,574 --> 00:44:07,575
Make them breathe
this powder

595
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:11,146
and they will see
the truth again.

596
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,882
Your men will hate you for it.

597
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:17,318
You will rip the
from a paradise

598
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,389
and return them to a world
of death and despair.

599
00:44:22,391 --> 00:44:24,193
How do I return home?

600
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:29,863
By passing
through the underworld

601
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:31,898
on the Path of the Dead.

602
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,369
Its gates lie on
the setting sun.

603
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:38,940
If you can emerge on
the other side,

604
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:42,276
you will find a
farewell gift from me,

605
00:44:42,278 --> 00:44:46,150
to see you to
the shores of Ithaca.

606
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,353
Thank you, Calypso.

607
00:44:53,322 --> 00:44:58,961
These arrived with you
and so they must stay with you.

608
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:06,235
If I did not love another,
I would surely stay.

609
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:12,009
You should find someone
who truly wants you.

610
00:45:44,373 --> 00:45:47,208
We must release them
from their spell.

611
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,880
Maybe we should
just leave them here.

612
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:53,347
A dangerous path lies ahead.

613
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:57,788
Each of them has their own
delusions in this fake paradise.

614
00:45:58,987 --> 00:46:03,124
No. Truth means
more than that.

615
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:04,461
It must.

616
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,198
But I will give them a choice.

617
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:18,673
Hello, my friend.

618
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,840
I've come to take you home.

619
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:23,811
- I am home.
- Have we met?

620
00:46:23,813 --> 00:46:25,782
Do you not know me?

621
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,251
I'm Odysseus.
I am your king.

622
00:46:31,253 --> 00:46:32,952
King?

623
00:46:32,954 --> 00:46:34,755
We have no king here.

624
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:36,527
Join us.

625
00:46:40,096 --> 00:46:44,030
- Aesus?
- Do you remember me?

626
00:46:44,032 --> 00:46:46,467
You fought along
my side at Troy.

627
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,336
Remember Ithaca?

628
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:51,171
Your wife?
Your children?

629
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:54,010
I have no wife, no children.

630
00:46:55,311 --> 00:46:58,282
Do any of you not
wish to return home?

631
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:14,498
What have you
done to my love?

632
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:20,702
What foul trick is this?

633
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,539
It is the trick of truth.

634
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,345
- Odysseus!
- Where have you been?

635
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,447
Where are we?
It seems like a dream!

636
00:47:33,449 --> 00:47:36,316
- It has been a dream.
- Now we're awakened.

637
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:39,889
You must help me.
We need to wake Old Thelonious.

638
00:47:42,157 --> 00:47:45,525
- Get out of there, old hag!
- Begone with you!

639
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,262
Get up.

640
00:47:47,264 --> 00:47:50,133
What are you
doing to my woman?

641
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,881
Who are you, old woman?

642
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:07,849
Don't leave.

643
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:10,184
We were so lonely here
before you came.

644
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:13,323
We will be beautiful again.
We promise.

645
00:48:15,925 --> 00:48:18,159
In order to return
to Ithaca,

646
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,661
we must journey through
the Path of the Dead,

647
00:48:20,663 --> 00:48:24,132
a place where no man has
gone since Orpheus.

648
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,901
Will you follow your king?

649
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,771
I have seen many things

650
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:33,007
and amongst the worst
of them is the truth.

651
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:38,079
My wife in Ithaca
is long dead now

652
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,315
and I cannot see a better way

653
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:46,155
to live my days
than with blind bliss.

654
00:48:47,423 --> 00:48:49,423
Very well.

655
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:52,327
I shall miss you,
old friend.

656
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,061
Thank you for your service.

657
00:48:55,063 --> 00:48:57,099
Farewell, my friends...

658
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:01,003
...farewell.

659
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,179
- Eurylochus?
- Will you join me?

660
00:49:12,181 --> 00:49:15,516
- Why would we stay?
- To sleep with old hags?

661
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:18,452
I would rather
die by your side.

662
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:21,755
- Aesus?
- Will you join me?

663
00:49:21,757 --> 00:49:23,391
Curse the truth!

664
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,159
May Athenae guard us on
this dark journey.

665
00:49:26,161 --> 00:49:28,397
Let us go home.

666
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:50,184
The entrance to the Labyrinth is
only a day's journey from here.

667
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:53,220
Uggh! What's this awful smell?

668
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:57,425
Death, or something
very large.

669
00:49:57,427 --> 00:49:58,495
Look.

670
00:49:59,594 --> 00:50:01,262
What in Zeus do you
think it is?

671
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:04,465
I never seen a man so large!

672
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:07,767
- It's not a man.
- A cyclops.

673
00:50:07,769 --> 00:50:09,470
Giant, ugly brutes.

674
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:12,472
They curse the gods for
giving them only one eye.

675
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:14,874
This one seems
to have moved on.

676
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:17,912
We'd hear a creature this
large from leagues away.

677
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:20,751
We should go
before he returns.

678
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,990
Odysseus, should we go in?

679
00:51:02,992 --> 00:51:04,858
No.

680
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:07,161
The path ahead is treacherous.

681
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:10,296
We should make camp, eat.

682
00:51:10,298 --> 00:51:12,633
We will need our strength
to conquer the test

683
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:15,138
of mind and body
inside these walls.

684
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:52,641
No. I'm not hungry.

685
00:51:54,043 --> 00:51:56,445
What's the matter, Odysseus?

686
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,880
Are you ill?

687
00:51:59,882 --> 00:52:03,016
No.

688
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:06,954
There is a pain in my soul
that will not go away.

689
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:09,824
The Sirens have cut me deep.

690
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:13,362
Calypso's love has
cut me deeper.

691
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:21,471
What it must be like to live
for eternity without true love.

692
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,708
I've broken her heart.

693
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:30,376
We humans...

694
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:33,583
we are such sad,
pitiful beasts.

695
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:38,952
You are an honorable man,
Odysseus.

696
00:52:38,954 --> 00:52:41,554
Wise, steadfast.

697
00:52:41,556 --> 00:52:45,459
Trust that you have made
the right decision.

698
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:49,896
How can I be honorable
after what I have done

699
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:53,402
to my wife, to my men?

700
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:58,472
I've asked them
to leave their joy

701
00:52:58,474 --> 00:53:00,576
and to follow me into death.

702
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:07,581
It is my curse, yet so many
of those I love

703
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,083
are the ones
that are affected.

704
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:12,887
Perhaps I should have been
like your King Priam

705
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,688
and journeyed into death.

706
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,657
Priam is no longer my king.

707
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:19,159
And I remember a man
that night

708
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,831
that was not afraid
of curses.

709
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:29,639
Tell me about your city,
King Odysseus of Ithaca.

710
00:53:32,842 --> 00:53:35,976
Beautiful Ithaca.

711
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:40,213
It is more humble than Troy.
There is no wall.

712
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:44,450
It is an island,
so the sea protects her.

713
00:53:44,452 --> 00:53:47,988
And the women,
the women of Ithaca

714
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,624
are the most beautiful
women in the world.

715
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:53,159
All men say that
about their city.

716
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,532
Not Sparta.

717
00:54:00,101 --> 00:54:02,269
We should sleep now.

718
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:06,641
We'll journey into
the Labyrinth before sunrise.

719
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:10,713
Tomorrow, we walk through
the Paths of the Dead.

720
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:39,708
Let's go.

721
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:12,907
Do you feel that?

722
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,608
A presence.

723
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:17,177
Do not look at them.

724
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:20,414
<i>Odysseus! Come!</i>

725
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:21,751
What was that?

726
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:26,287
Do not listen to them!

727
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:28,188
The voices are in your mind.

728
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:31,057
<i>Aesus, you're going to die.</i>

729
00:55:31,059 --> 00:55:34,394
<i>Odysseus, the tunnels
of the dead</i>

730
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:37,697
<i>will cleanse you
of your sorrows.</i>

731
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:41,501
<i>If you live...
if you live!</i>

732
00:55:41,503 --> 00:55:44,938
<i>Aesus, how many
have you killed?</i>

733
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,275
<i>How many of us are here
because of you?</i>

734
00:55:48,277 --> 00:55:50,209
I think we should go back.

735
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:53,349
No! We go forward.

736
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:59,519
<i>Remember the men you've slain.</i>

737
00:55:59,521 --> 00:56:01,021
Do not fear the ghosts.

738
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,858
<i>They are waiting
for you Aesus...</i>

739
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,364
<i>for revenge!</i>

740
00:56:08,463 --> 00:56:10,866
<i>Aesus...</i>

741
00:56:13,434 --> 00:56:15,704
<i>Aesus...</i>

742
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:21,309
I think we're at the end.

743
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,579
Oh, thank Zeus.

744
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:32,021
Where's Aesus?

745
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:39,159
- I'm going back.
- Take this.

746
00:56:39,161 --> 00:56:41,293
Aesus!

747
00:56:41,295 --> 00:56:44,032
- Come on.
- Aesus!

748
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:34,483
Odysseus?

749
00:57:40,255 --> 00:57:41,790
Odysseus!

750
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:52,599
- Circe!
- This sword isn't working!

751
00:57:52,601 --> 00:57:54,604
- Give it to me!
- I'm a Trojan!

752
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,965
Run! Run! Run!

753
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:27,503
Run!

754
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:31,274
- Come on!
- Hurry up!

755
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:36,911
Let's go! Come on!

756
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,646
- Faster!
- It's gonna cave in on you!

757
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:41,148
Let's go!

758
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,985
Ah!

759
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,230
Thank you for
letting me use it.

760
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:02,269
- You should keep it.
- Now and forever.

761
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,170
It is a treasure of Troy.

762
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:06,874
Therefore, useless
in my hands.

763
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,141
Troy.

764
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:10,876
Even the name seems
like another life.

765
00:59:10,878 --> 00:59:13,315
Like a distant dream.

766
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,885
You are a noble man, Odysseus.

767
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:21,056
Thank you for your strength
on this journey.

768
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:25,458
We have made it through
the Paths of the Dead.

769
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,729
You can do anything now,
Odysseus.

770
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:32,700
We should not be
satisfied yet.

771
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:35,034
We still have to get
through the heart

772
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:37,804
of the mountain
to make it to the shore.

773
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:40,009
We should go.

774
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,778
Queen!

775
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,282
My patience has
reached its limit.

776
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:51,717
You will choose a husband
or we will take you by force!

777
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,653
You will leave
my mother alone.

778
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:55,588
Ah, the young imp speaks.

779
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,858
Well, you'd better choose
your words carefully.

780
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,795
- Do not dare threaten my son.
- He will be king one day.

781
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:04,233
If we allow him to live.

782
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:08,133
Stop!

783
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:10,972
- Choose!
- Choose from us now!

784
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,305
The marriage shroud
is not yet...

785
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:14,407
Then you'll marry
with no clothes!

786
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:19,079
- Please! I will marry!
- Just don't hurt my son!

787
01:00:19,081 --> 01:00:20,313
Swear it.

788
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:21,947
Swear it on the memory
of your husband

789
01:00:21,949 --> 01:00:23,150
and the life of your son!

790
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,851
I swear it!

791
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,686
I swear it on the love
of my true

792
01:00:26,688 --> 01:00:28,954
and eternal husband
that I will choose!

793
01:00:28,956 --> 01:00:32,728
I will marry a man
so that he may act as king!

794
01:00:35,396 --> 01:00:37,932
Now that wasn't
so difficult, was it?

795
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,367
Drink with us,
Queen of Ithaca

796
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:42,972
and tell us who will be
the new king.

797
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:53,349
As it is now, I see no man
worthy to be a king.

798
01:00:56,952 --> 01:00:59,686
The best amongst you
will be revealed.

799
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:01,688
There will be a contest,

800
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:05,458
a test of skill
and strength.

801
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,130
Only after one of you has proven
to possess the qualities

802
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:13,135
to wear the crown will
I choose a new husband.

803
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,722
We've been walking for days.

804
01:02:08,724 --> 01:02:10,226
Surely, we are lost.

805
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,295
We must keep our faith.

806
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,063
Calypso promised that
we could return home

807
01:02:17,065 --> 01:02:19,835
if I made it through
the Path of the Dead.

808
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:22,369
I'm so hungry.

809
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,505
I'm imagining the smell
of cooked meat.

810
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,773
I don't think that's
your imagination.

811
01:02:26,775 --> 01:02:29,043
I can smell it, too.

812
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,447
Where is it coming from?

813
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,863
Oh, thank you, Zeus!

814
01:02:49,931 --> 01:02:51,999
But whose camp is this?

815
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,867
It's not safe to eat
from a stranger.

816
01:02:53,869 --> 01:02:56,771
We haven't eaten since before
we entered the Labyrinth.

817
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,041
Whoever it is,
they will understand.

818
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,411
We'll take only what we need.

819
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:09,349
When I return to Ithaca,
I shall slaughter 1,000 bulls

820
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:11,186
for their honor.

821
01:03:21,929 --> 01:03:24,366
This is a bad idea.

822
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:27,633
Look at these stores of meat.

823
01:03:27,635 --> 01:03:29,436
But what kind of meat is it?

824
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,446
We should leave.

825
01:03:40,682 --> 01:03:43,318
Cyclops. Run!

826
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:47,322
Hide yourself quickly!

827
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,868
What do we do?

828
01:04:11,179 --> 01:04:13,382
I cannot abide
any more suffering.

829
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,117
Your man is lost!

830
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:19,521
We must use this
chance to escape.

831
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,128
I have a plan.

832
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,403
Here.

833
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,342
Eurylochus!

834
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:45,945
Wait, mighty Cyclops!

835
01:04:45,947 --> 01:04:50,282
I have heard that you despise
all of the gods in Olympus.

836
01:04:50,284 --> 01:04:52,552
Then you shall not
want to eat me,

837
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:54,420
for I am cursed.

838
01:04:54,422 --> 01:04:56,555
Eating me shall only
please the gods.

839
01:04:56,557 --> 01:04:59,626
But I have brought you
a great offering.

840
01:04:59,628 --> 01:05:02,595
It is an elixir that is
so powerful, it is said

841
01:05:02,597 --> 01:05:05,467
that not even the gods
know of its existence.

842
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:16,409
It is a potion so potent
that anyone who should drink it

843
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,478
will be imbued with
enough strength

844
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,317
that they can knock Zeus
straight from the heavens!

845
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:41,068
Quick!
I'm not sure how much time

846
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,372
we have with
a creature of that size.

847
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,909
What did you give him?

848
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:51,711
It's extract of
a poppy flower.

849
01:05:51,713 --> 01:05:54,014
We give it to soldiers
who've been injured in battle

850
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:55,382
to help sedate them.

851
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,016
I gave him enough for
an entire battalion.

852
01:05:57,018 --> 01:05:59,420
We should go now.

853
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:05,694
Come on.

854
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:12,666
Bats.
We're on the right track.

855
01:06:12,668 --> 01:06:14,537
I see light!

856
01:06:27,849 --> 01:06:29,351
Thank the gods.

857
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,757
It's our ship!

858
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:40,559
Thank you, Calypso,
for keeping your promise.

859
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:45,999
Penelope, I can finally
return to you.

860
01:06:56,744 --> 01:06:59,845
When I am king,
my first deed will be

861
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:03,583
to tax everyone and everything
until we are all rich!

862
01:07:16,097 --> 01:07:21,133
Telemachus, tell me of what
contest your mother has planned.

863
01:07:21,135 --> 01:07:23,405
I don't know.

864
01:07:27,175 --> 01:07:30,811
My Queen! Your ears must
have been burning.

865
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,079
Now you can tell us yourself.

866
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,284
What game do you have
in store for us?

867
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,455
A race perhaps?
Or a wrestling match?

868
01:07:40,822 --> 01:07:44,124
This is my husband's
hunting bow.

869
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:47,025
It represents the skill
and strength with which

870
01:07:47,027 --> 01:07:50,429
he used to rule this city.

871
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:53,733
The first to string it
and shoot an arrow

872
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,168
through five golden rings
will win the right

873
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,570
to share this kingdom with me.

874
01:07:58,572 --> 01:08:02,275
If there be a just man
amongst you,

875
01:08:02,277 --> 01:08:05,114
may this challenge
reveal him.

876
01:08:09,684 --> 01:08:12,485
Do you not wish
to see who wins?

877
01:08:12,487 --> 01:08:14,856
The winner makes no
difference to me.

878
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,110
Land!

879
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,229
Beautiful Ithaca!

880
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,665
I am home!

881
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:02,602
I am home.

882
01:09:02,604 --> 01:09:06,675
- Congratulations, Odysseus.
- You deserve your homecoming.

883
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,382
You can make this
your home as well.

884
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,416
You are welcome.

885
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:21,153
- I have no home.
- That is my curse.

886
01:09:21,155 --> 01:09:24,022
I will continue
to journey the sea,

887
01:09:24,024 --> 01:09:27,326
travel from place to place,
having adventures,

888
01:09:27,328 --> 01:09:30,832
saving lives...
I'll be like Hercules.

889
01:09:32,033 --> 01:09:35,371
- Circe?
- I will miss you.

890
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,004
I will miss you too,
good King.

891
01:09:39,006 --> 01:09:43,643
Fighting by your side
has been the greatest honor,

892
01:09:43,645 --> 01:09:45,581
King of Ithaca.

893
01:09:55,189 --> 01:09:56,791
You are my friend.

894
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:27,454
I will not wed another.

895
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,123
I will die first.

896
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,058
I will die.

897
01:10:41,368 --> 01:10:43,271
Come in.

898
01:10:46,707 --> 01:10:48,775
You sent for me, Mother?

899
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,511
My son...

900
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,849
Today I will
take a new husband.

901
01:10:56,851 --> 01:10:59,385
Mother, you can't
marry any of them.

902
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:01,620
My father is still alive.
I know it.

903
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:04,492
Let me fight them.
Let me defend your honor.

904
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,795
You are a warrior already,
even so young.

905
01:11:09,797 --> 01:11:14,133
But I'm afraid there are too
many for you to fight alone.

906
01:11:14,135 --> 01:11:16,236
Am I to stay silent?

907
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,537
No.

908
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:20,839
I want you to leave Ithaca.

909
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:23,143
What?

910
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:27,312
I want you to go and
find the fastest ship

911
01:11:27,314 --> 01:11:30,415
and go to Menelaus
in Sparta

912
01:11:30,417 --> 01:11:33,018
and get safe haven.

913
01:11:33,020 --> 01:11:36,589
Here, take this.

914
01:11:36,591 --> 01:11:40,026
This is a ring of
your father's kingship.

915
01:11:40,028 --> 01:11:42,661
If you wear it,

916
01:11:42,663 --> 01:11:46,433
Menelaus will recognize you
as the King of Ithaca.

917
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:51,673
Build an army and
regain the throne.

918
01:11:54,842 --> 01:11:59,081
Go now before those brigands
do any more damage.

919
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:41,055
My city has changed.

920
01:12:54,402 --> 01:12:56,070
Are you lost, old man?

921
01:12:57,405 --> 01:13:00,906
No. I have been gone
for some time.

922
01:13:00,908 --> 01:13:04,445
Here. Get yourself
something to eat.

923
01:13:06,113 --> 01:13:08,680
These wicked suitors
pursue the queen,

924
01:13:08,682 --> 01:13:11,386
and forget generosity is
the key to Athenae's favor.

925
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,556
Speak again
about your queen?

926
01:13:16,658 --> 01:13:18,994
She intends to remarry.

927
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:23,963
Penelope, wife of Odysseus?

928
01:13:23,965 --> 01:13:27,567
Odysseus never returned home
from the Trojan War.

929
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:30,005
Most people presumed
he is dead.

930
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:35,141
What is your name?

931
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:37,479
I'm Telemachus.

932
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:41,347
Telemachus?

933
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:43,782
Son of Odysseus and Penelope?

934
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:46,352
I should have known.

935
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:48,824
You share her kindness.

936
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,491
You know my mother?

937
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:55,164
I knew her well
many years ago.

938
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,032
You have her heart.

939
01:14:01,034 --> 01:14:04,736
Tell me of the man your
mother wishes to marry.

940
01:14:04,738 --> 01:14:07,339
Does she love him greatly?

941
01:14:07,341 --> 01:14:10,045
She despises him.

942
01:14:11,179 --> 01:14:13,478
And what of your father?

943
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,018
Has she forgotten him?

944
01:14:17,118 --> 01:14:18,084
No.

945
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:21,486
Then tell me,
young Telemachus,

946
01:14:21,488 --> 01:14:24,156
will you do me one favor?

947
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:26,358
What is it you ask?

948
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:31,934
Will you help me regain
the throne of my city?

949
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:35,737
Who are you, stranger?

950
01:14:39,173 --> 01:14:42,041
I am Odysseus...

951
01:14:42,043 --> 01:14:44,246
King of Ithaca.

952
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:52,052
I have dreamed many years
that I would return home

953
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:55,090
and meet my son.

954
01:14:56,457 --> 01:14:59,494
My son.

955
01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:06,068
We shall retake this throne.

956
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,213
- Enough!
- Give it to me!

957
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,885
I will solve this problem
once and for all.

958
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:29,188
They attempt to string
your old hunting bow

959
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,626
so they may be
worthy to be king.

960
01:15:41,536 --> 01:15:43,303
It's just another trick!

961
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,039
No one can string that bow!

962
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,676
I can.

963
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:51,611
How dare you, beggar!

964
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:53,646
What are you even doing here?

965
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:58,718
This man is my guest, which
is more than I can say of you.

966
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,321
- Throw this scum out!
- Now!

967
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:05,625
Are you afraid that a beggar
may succeed where you fail?

968
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:08,460
Of course not!

969
01:16:08,462 --> 01:16:11,830
Then allow me
to string the bow.

970
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:15,601
If I should fail, then
you can throw me out.

971
01:16:15,603 --> 01:16:17,702
Unless you fear me.

972
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:20,873
I do not fear you.

973
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,875
But if you fail I will not
just cast you out,

974
01:16:22,877 --> 01:16:25,644
I will cut off your tongue.

975
01:16:25,646 --> 01:16:27,282
Very well.

976
01:17:04,685 --> 01:17:06,652
This cannot be.

977
01:17:06,654 --> 01:17:08,720
I demand to know who you are!

978
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:10,522
Who are you?!

979
01:17:10,524 --> 01:17:12,860
I am the King of Ithaca.

980
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,762
Impossible.

981
01:17:16,764 --> 01:17:20,268
You're a liar.
Kill this liar!

982
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:25,940
Soon we'll be together,
my pirate.

983
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,688
My son...

984
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,818
Aaaaaah!!!

985
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:14,553
Whatever happened to
the legendary Odysseus?

986
01:18:14,555 --> 01:18:16,157
The years have weakened you!

987
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:35,177
Ah! Aaaaaah!

988
01:19:16,717 --> 01:19:19,421
How many times
did I warn you, imp?

989
01:19:28,796 --> 01:19:30,495
I would die for you.

990
01:19:35,369 --> 01:19:36,872
Circe!

991
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:50,252
- Telemachus!
- What happened?

992
01:19:56,157 --> 01:19:58,994
We return the rightful king
to his throne.

993
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,126
Oh, dear me.

994
01:20:02,128 --> 01:20:04,131
Who are these people?

995
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:13,108
Odysseus?

996
01:20:28,957 --> 01:20:31,293
My Bastet cat.

997
01:20:33,427 --> 01:20:37,032
I have not heard you call me
that since the day you left.

998
01:20:40,768 --> 01:20:44,872
My love. My king. My husband.

999
01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:47,406
My husband.

1000
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:49,540
You're here.

1001
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:20,342
What is that sound?

1002
01:21:21,676 --> 01:21:23,710
It is the Kraken.

1003
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,210
It still lives.

1004
01:21:25,212 --> 01:21:27,679
What is this monster?

1005
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:33,387
- It has followed me from Troy.
- I must end this.

1006
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,120
Yes, but you'll die!

1007
01:21:36,122 --> 01:21:37,589
Let me fight with you.

1008
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:41,727
- No.
- It is me the creature wants.

1009
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,332
But you'll die.

1010
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:47,133
If I do not do this,

1011
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:49,102
it shall follow me
for the rest of my days.

1012
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,169
I will stay by your side.

1013
01:21:51,171 --> 01:21:55,142
I refuse to see your world
destroyed as I saw mine.

1014
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:13,594
Come, beast!
I am the one you want!

1015
01:22:15,962 --> 01:22:18,397
Odysseus!

1016
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:20,333
Give me your cape
and bow quickly

1017
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:22,101
so that I may look
to be an Ithacan!

1018
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,602
- No.
- The beast will kill you!

1019
01:22:23,604 --> 01:22:28,275
- You'll die before he dies.
- My plan is sound.

1020
01:22:42,355 --> 01:22:44,290
I am the destroyer
of the Trojans.

1021
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,259
I am Odysseus,
your most hated foe!

1022
01:22:47,261 --> 01:22:50,365
But before you look upon
my face, despair!

1023
01:22:52,298 --> 01:22:55,901
Behold the sword of Troy!

1024
01:22:55,903 --> 01:23:01,507
For I am the last Trojan,
and I fight for Ithaca!

1025
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:02,978
No, Circe!

1026
01:23:05,746 --> 01:23:06,715
No!

1027
01:23:08,716 --> 01:23:10,452
Leave her!

1028
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,438
Circe!

1029
01:23:37,377 --> 01:23:42,481
Odysseus, I've paid
my debt to you at last.

1030
01:23:42,483 --> 01:23:46,054
- No!
- I will get you a healer!

1031
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:52,191
It's time for me to join
my people in the afterlife.

1032
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:56,797
They wait for me there.
I have been gone too long.

1033
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,404
Farewell, sweet Odysseus.

1034
01:24:06,173 --> 01:24:10,177
Your name will be
etched in history.

1035
01:24:15,416 --> 01:24:19,986
Farewell, my warrior princess,

1036
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:21,620
my loyal friend.

1037
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:23,388
Friend...

1038
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:28,495
yes, you are
my dearest... friend.

1039
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,107
<i>They did not know
what men would say of them</i>

1040
01:25:49,109 --> 01:25:50,675
<i>in centuries to come.</i>

1041
01:25:50,677 --> 01:25:54,780
<i>That crudeness took
their hearts barbaric,</i>

1042
01:25:54,782 --> 01:25:56,982
<i>wielding eternal death.</i>

1043
01:25:56,984 --> 01:26:00,318
<i>Will they be remembered for
how nobly they fought?</i>

1044
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,187
<i>For how deeply they believed?</i>

1045
01:26:02,189 --> 01:26:04,790
<i>Or how fiercely they loved?</i>

1046
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:08,995
<i>For they are our fathers
that dwelt in such an age:</i>

1047
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,330
<i>a time of gods and honor.</i>

1048
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:14,799
<i>From them, we have sprung and
will lead forever unto us.</i>

1049
01:26:14,801 --> 01:26:18,035
<i>Unto us from that
great age of heroes</i>

1050
01:26:18,037 --> 01:26:20,407
<i>and of legendary deeds.</i>
