1
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,502
<i>Almighty God, in my hour of need, be with me</i>

2
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:15,522
<i>Let me never forget my sacred
and holy vows onto Thee</i>

3
00:01:15,898 --> 00:01:21,227
<i>and I should not be prey onto demons and devils,
and all the dark things of this world</i>

4
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:25,315
<i>Honour me with the armor of Thy righteousness</i>

5
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:29,041
<i>Give me the sword of truth,
that I shall confound mine enemies...</i>

6
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:33,588
<i>... and be onto Thee... the true knight</i>

7
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:17,233
They blockade the path!

8
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:19,863
This way!

9
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,394
Guard!

10
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Fall back!

11
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,335
COVEEER!!

12
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:48,014
- Jacob, we can stop this.
- Stop now, we lose more men.

13
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,680
There is no stopping this [...]

14
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:54,243
- We can outflank them.
- There are women and children in it.

15
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:56,221
- They won't be hurt.
- They WILL be hurt.

16
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:57,976
We end this today!

17
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,653
WITH ME !!

18
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:03,725
- Your Highness.

19
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,927
- With Allah's help we may still prevail.
- The time for false hope is over.

20
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:12,669
There is one final request
I must beg of you, my friend.

21
00:04:17,845 --> 00:04:21,297
Haven't you had enough of this -
killing for hypocrite priests?

22
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:25,287
- We do God's work.
- The blood we spill here is on our blades.

23
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,553
Our souls, not God's!

24
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:38,367
We don't have to do this anymore.
We can just go.

25
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:39,807
- Go where?
- East.

26
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:41,316
No one goes East.

27
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,740
- Cannot be any worse than here.
- You doubt our cause?

28
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:52,592
- You're not the man you once were.
- None of us are.

29
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:59,805
Go there. Go East!

30
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:03,819
You know, I swore an oath to your father.

31
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:07,195
My father is dead, you are released
of your oath.

32
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:09,720
I release you. Go!

33
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:18,949
- Father.
- Papa!

34
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,073
Hassan will escort you away from here.

35
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:33,073
I will see you again... very soon.

36
00:05:33,775 --> 00:05:35,507
You have to be strong.

37
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,922
You have to be strong.
For the children, for us.

38
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:41,355
My love.

39
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:09,004
GOD WITH US !!!

40
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:35,192
Stop, this is finished.

41
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:33,761
Leave.

42
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,165
My days draw to an end, my son.

43
00:09:22,245 --> 00:09:26,213
- No, father!
- They do... child.

44
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:29,605
That is the nature of life.

45
00:09:32,912 --> 00:09:35,277
<i>All that is left for me...</i>

46
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:40,682
...is to ensure my Kingdom
receives the leader it deserves.

47
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:43,761
Which is why I have chosen you...

48
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:46,138
...to sucseed me.

49
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,420
- Me? But... Shing?
- Your brother is a great warrior.

50
00:09:54,634 --> 00:09:57,756
<i>Now it's the time for peace</i>

51
00:09:58,894 --> 00:10:01,275
That is my request of you.

52
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,313
Father, no one will follow me.

53
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:05,506
They will...

54
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:08,365
...because you will be King.

55
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,206
Majesty, Prince Shing approaches the gates.

56
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:22,324
Our time is less than we thought.

57
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,952
Qiang Long, the royal seal.

58
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,997
Yes, your Majesty.

59
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,758
Qiang Long will escort you...

60
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,622
...ensure that you all safely reaches
the General Sen Ching Wen.

61
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:48,517
I will protect him with my life.

62
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,736
I have made none of these decisions lightly.

63
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:04,018
Which is why... I have chosen you.

64
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:11,707
Father.

65
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:18,889
Out of necessity, Lian.

66
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,148
A King... tends more to his sons.

67
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,598
But it does not mean... he has any
less love for his daughter.

68
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:33,439
I trust you... with your brother's life.

69
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,689
With the future of our Kingdom.

70
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:41,466
Go now.

71
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,678
Majesty.

72
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:03,475
- It's been a long time.
- Too long, my son.

73
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:06,858
I came as soon as I heard
of your declining health.

74
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,779
My health has always been a concern of yours.

75
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:18,232
I have other concerns, father.

76
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:22,389
About... rumors I've heard.

77
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:28,295
Rumors... are the distraction of
children and old women.

78
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:32,716
Indeed. Unless they are true.

79
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:39,107
And... what rumor carries... such weight, my son?

80
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:43,606
Perhaps we should summon my baby brother
to discuss it ?

81
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,514
Unfortunately, your brother
is away from the palace.

82
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:56,169
<i>I fear your ill health is clouding
your judgement, father.</i>

83
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:00,239
The throne is my BIRTHRIGHT !!

84
00:13:01,076 --> 00:13:03,819
I earned it, fighting your wars!

85
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:08,477
Without you... there would be no Kingdom...

86
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,328
.. but everything!

87
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:14,958
I've given everything for you.

88
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:18,224
I know... my son.

89
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:20,421
But please...

90
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,673
...it is in the best interests of the people.

91
00:13:24,793 --> 00:13:28,912
- What... do you know about THE PEOPLE ?!
- Prince Shing!

92
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,348
My son means me... no harm.

93
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:47,520
My father must trust you very much.

94
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:56,008
You have family? A wife?  Children?

95
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:03,813
Resist me and I will see that your children
are nailed to the walls of your home...

96
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:07,145
- ...one piece at a time.
- Shing!

97
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:13,116
That your wife spends the rest of her life
pleasuring my guards.

98
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,482
Die for a King whose time has passed...

99
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,203
or choose to serve a new one.

100
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,697
- Leave us.
- Out ! All of you.

101
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:49,792
Remember this blade, Father?

102
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,370
Your mother... once saved my life with it.

103
00:14:55,206 --> 00:15:00,793
When I was old enough... she gave it to me.

104
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,022
And told me I would be King.

105
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:06,733
But you are not the child she loved.

106
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:14,866
Where is the seal?

107
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:25,153
Where. Is. The. Seal?

108
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,992
Heaven... forgive him.

109
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:13,081
Heaven is closed to me...
because of all the things I've done for you.

110
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:30,600
The King... is dead.

111
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,897
Murdered. By Prince Qiang.

112
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,200
He stole the royal seal.
Bring it to me.

113
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:47,116
Follow me.

114
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,422
Keep your men under control.

115
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,351
Summon General Gao.

116
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:56,668
Now.

117
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:58,858
Or should I send for your family?

118
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,613
The horse!

119
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,878
Stop them!

120
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,717
Go!

121
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:01,943
Maybe we should just keep going?

122
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:06,180
And how far will we get? We have no horse.
We need help.

123
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,798
- You stay here.
- But Lian, I should go!

124
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,360
Father chose you, because he knows
you are strong.

125
00:19:25,572 --> 00:19:29,479
Whatever happens, you keep going.
You reach the Generals.

126
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:31,413
And you will be King.

127
00:19:40,117 --> 00:19:41,372
Be careful.

128
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:38,349
Here.

129
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:42,568
No money, no food.

130
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,146
When you first came in,
I thought you might be the White Ghost.

131
00:20:55,077 --> 00:20:56,721
I guess I was wrong.

132
00:21:03,288 --> 00:21:04,762
Is that the Princess?

133
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:11,015
I seek an escort for the road.

134
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:18,855
I can pay.

135
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:22,563
What use is coin to the dead ?
The Black Guards are hunting you.

136
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:26,864
Look who I found skulking outside!

137
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,876
I'm sorry, I did not see them.

138
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,576
- My father will hear of this.
- So the dead have ears.

139
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:46,297
No, my father is not dead.
It's not true!

140
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:50,263
Oh, you know it is.
After all it was you who murdered him.

141
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:55,632
- Or was it you, Princess?
- Shing.

142
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:59,851
The seal, where is it?

143
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:05,215
You mind?

144
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:16,181
Hold them.

145
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,486
No! Stop it.

146
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:25,563
Give it back to me!

147
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:30,398
- The seal is mine!
- Cut these throats.

148
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:45,056
The sword... is mine.

149
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:48,316
It belongs to me.

150
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:52,033
I'd like it back.

151
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:53,707
Then come.

152
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:58,424
Take it.

153
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,849
Opium.

154
00:23:11,894 --> 00:23:16,029
Your kind are such fools.
Clean him up.

155
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,083
Kill him.

156
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,763
- Lian.
- Qiang!

157
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:48,825
Either way, the boy dies.

158
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:56,145
- Kill him then, I just want my sword back.
- If I give it to you, then will you leave?

159
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,977
You have to help us.

160
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,497
Good luck, Princess.

161
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,043
Wait!

162
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:06,606
Much obliged.

163
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:09,997
Wait. Qiang, come.

164
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:14,975
Please !Help us. We must get to Shing Yuing.

165
00:26:15,486 --> 00:26:18,446
If your reward is what you seek, we have gold.

166
00:26:19,998 --> 00:26:24,545
My brother is the Kingdom's only hope.
If you don't help us, we will be killed.

167
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:28,406
Come. You will be if you stay here.

168
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:24,483
Do what you must,
but there are riders down below.

169
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:29,242
- How many?
- Wake the boy. Quietly.

170
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:34,502
Shh. We have to hide.

171
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,600
Keep looking!

172
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:27,221
Why did you come back?

173
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:30,617
You had your sword.

174
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:35,219
You promised gold.

175
00:29:41,952 --> 00:29:44,181
And I was having that way, anyway.

176
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:52,925
What brings you to our lands?

177
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:07,413
I know. But it's all we have.

178
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:30,399
Let's stop.

179
00:30:34,394 --> 00:30:35,428
Wait here.

180
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,475
I said, wait.

181
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,392
This is our fault.

182
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:15,446
- They need help.
- We need to go, come on.

183
00:31:16,382 --> 00:31:18,025
You can't just go!

184
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,789
Wait!

185
00:32:15,812 --> 00:32:17,374
How is that possible?

186
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,709
- Let me go!
- Come on!

187
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:43,342
You're welcome.

188
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:46,259
It's great.

189
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:54,162
I'm only trying to help.

190
00:32:55,216 --> 00:32:56,801
All right?

191
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:00,864
- I'm Lian.
- I'm Qiang.

192
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:02,975
And you?

193
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:07,645
Xaoi.

194
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,184
Beautiflu name.

195
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,614
We can't just abandon her.

196
00:33:16,149 --> 00:33:19,596
It's one more mouth to feed,
and one more body to hide.

197
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:25,436
They seek three, not four.

198
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:32,218
All right.

199
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,324
That shot.
How did you make it?

200
00:33:40,598 --> 00:33:41,971
Practice.

201
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:45,083
We go off the map, get through the woods.

202
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:48,978
Hopefully we won't see any
Black Guards until Ching Shao.

203
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:04,694
Your Majesty, General Gao.

204
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:06,380
- Lord Shing.
- Majesty.

205
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,162
- Lord Shing.
- Majesty.

206
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,673
How many of your fellow generals
will offer support to the boy?

207
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:21,583
- Once the Council has officiated over the
appropriate ceremony...  - Yes...

208
00:34:21,777 --> 00:34:26,272
... can't be no ceremonies without the seal.

209
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:33,551
But... if he... has the seal,
there's nothing to be done.

210
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,521
He murdered my father.

211
00:34:44,812 --> 00:34:46,991
Stole the Seal.

212
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,810
If that's the case...

213
00:34:51,526 --> 00:34:54,299
...he will be punished. Accordingly.

214
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,312
It's inexcusable.

215
00:34:57,957 --> 00:35:00,639
Even from a Prince.

216
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,470
Forgive me, General.

217
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:20,653
My father's murder has left me overemotional.

218
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:31,125
They will be heading to Shing Yuing.

219
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,812
Make sure they never get there.

220
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:40,196
I'm sorry, for what Shing's men did.

221
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,248
He murdered my father, too.

222
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:46,323
For what, a few coins and a rusty plough?

223
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,132
Does it matter what it was for?

224
00:35:48,584 --> 00:35:51,815
I want to make things better,
for people like you!

225
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:57,119
Do you think it makes a difference
for people like me - who sits on the throne?

226
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:00,549
It should. And we change things.

227
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:03,454
You don't believe me?

228
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:10,015
I believe you're just a boy,
and Shing Yuing is still faaar away.

229
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:13,247
And yet, it's closer than yesterday.

230
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,752
We'll make camp here.

231
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:03,252
I needed that.

232
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:07,125
Tear of the poppy. Dull the man's senses.

233
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,992
Some things are better dulled.

234
00:37:13,812 --> 00:37:16,304
Our lives and the future of our Kingdom...

235
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:20,123
... depending upon your wits.

236
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:23,467
Your Kingdom.

237
00:37:28,868 --> 00:37:30,708
You're far from home.

238
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:35,576
Are you running? Or searching?

239
00:37:36,012 --> 00:37:37,512
Both.

240
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:43,658
Your people...

241
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:48,691
- ... do they believe in Hell?
- We believe in Diyu.

242
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,929
The realm of the Dead.

243
00:37:52,931 --> 00:37:55,929
One is assigned to one of 18 levels.

244
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:59,477
A place of heart [...]. The Lake of blood.

245
00:38:02,723 --> 00:38:04,480
The punishment fits the crime.

246
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,000
What was yours?

247
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:12,567
Ohh... there've been many.

248
00:38:16,331 --> 00:38:18,814
We all have our weights to bear.

249
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:27,648
No doubt, the life of a Princess...
is a heavy burden.

250
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,850
Do you know what it's like - being a woman
in this world?

251
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,889
Do you think watching men destroy everything
you care about bears no weight?

252
00:38:35,555 --> 00:38:37,738
And for what? Pride?

253
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:40,609
Greed?

254
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,732
You warriors march off and forge new worlds.

255
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,600
We have to stay behind, to raise the children.

256
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:52,123
We have to explain why their fathers don't return.

257
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,940
And we have to fix the broken creatures that do.

258
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,959
Do not judge my life.

259
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:07,848
- When you know nothing about being a woman.
- I'm sorry.

260
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,694
A Princess... is a woman, too.

261
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:17,548
I am, what you wanted of me.

262
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:23,221
I did what you needed, but couldn't.

263
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:29,944
I will have what is mine.

264
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:42,576
Wake up.

265
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,738
I want to fire arrows like you.

266
00:39:59,525 --> 00:40:00,514
Teach me.

267
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,108
Teach me!

268
00:40:22,774 --> 00:40:24,736
I thought White Devils didn't bathe.

269
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,871
A man picks up bad habits
when he is away from home.

270
00:40:31,842 --> 00:40:35,571
You've been in many battles?
I wish to become a great warrior, too.

271
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:39,488
My father wanted me to learn from books,
not have to fight.

272
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,478
Teach me!

273
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,213
- Why?
- My father...

274
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,772
Shing must pay.

275
00:40:51,512 --> 00:40:52,560
Please.

276
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:55,343
Teach me.

277
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:00,649
Battle is both craft and art.

278
00:41:01,878 --> 00:41:03,977
First you must learn to craft.

279
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:10,885
Then you push past it, until action and reaction
become instinct. A part of you.

280
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:16,125
The man who taught you,
was he a great warrior?

281
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,759
Use your back, allright ?
Not your shoulders.

282
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:38,256
Release.

283
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:55,422
Fire.

284
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:09,631
Fire!

285
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:17,069
I'm sorry!

286
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:19,738
Better.

287
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:28,064
- You're good with my brother.
- The boy has a good heart and mind.

288
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:31,226
Like his sister.

289
00:42:34,163 --> 00:42:37,381
If we'd gone East, we'd already
been nearing Shing Yuing.

290
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:39,797
Where do you think the most of Black Guard
are concentrated?

291
00:42:40,502 --> 00:42:43,331
Once we get past Ching Shao,
there is less chance that they follow.

292
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:46,648
They follow [...] where my brother instructs.

293
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:50,853
In the Silver Mountains there said to be bandits
who despise your brother and his men.

294
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:55,616
You mean the White Ghost.
Wouldn't he despise us equally?

295
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:06,701
Quiet, stay low.

296
00:43:16,206 --> 00:43:18,879
We should move on, quickly,
Mount off.

297
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:26,340
Thank you.
- No thanks.

298
00:43:27,707 --> 00:43:29,141
You're welcome.

299
00:43:46,814 --> 00:43:48,467
Ching Shao.

300
00:43:50,853 --> 00:43:53,062
Everyone will be looking for you.

301
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,567
We need to find a way in.

302
00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:18,901
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

303
00:44:20,938 --> 00:44:25,312
I'm travelling with my mistress and her
servant boy, searching for new company.

304
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:32,010
You will find us extremely hospitable,
for the right price.

305
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,446
You and your lady are welcome to join us.

306
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:46,724
She's shy, she enjoys her privacy.

307
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:50,447
She will enjoy it so much more
in a city full of strangers.

308
00:45:03,533 --> 00:45:05,383
You gave her your gold.

309
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:11,923
I'll see you are properly rewarded
when we reach Shing Yuing.

310
00:45:31,803 --> 00:45:33,519
Stay calm.

311
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:41,246
Dismount slowly.

312
00:45:49,653 --> 00:45:52,048
- Out of the cart!
- What seems to be the problem?

313
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:54,628
We are searching for the Prince and Princess.

314
00:45:55,116 --> 00:45:57,414
You'll find nothing of interest here.

315
00:46:01,963 --> 00:46:03,836
Let them through!

316
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:12,201
Come on, let's go.

317
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,317
You did well.

318
00:46:53,337 --> 00:46:56,896
- You should stay with us.
- I think my mistress would prefer
to keep travelling.

319
00:46:56,996 --> 00:46:59,840
You're exhausted, and think of the children.

320
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:04,934
I have private rooms, your mistress
will appreciate the privacy.

321
00:47:45,902 --> 00:47:47,535
Waht are you looking at?

322
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,483
You are hungrier than you appeared.

323
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:09,517
Take my guests to clean up.
They must be tired.

324
00:48:16,462 --> 00:48:17,831
Stay.

325
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:22,058
I have something that may interest you.

326
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:34,265
Make sure you are fit to travel.

327
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:39,668
Thank you for your hospitality.

328
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,853
It's all to your health.

329
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,761
This way.

330
00:49:15,064 --> 00:49:17,593
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.

331
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,694
- He served us well.
- Did anyone say he hasn't?

332
00:49:23,319 --> 00:49:24,777
Now go and get cleaned up.

333
00:49:26,094 --> 00:49:28,434
I want to be ready to leave
first thing tomorrow.

334
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,314
- It's still early.
- Just do as I say, Xiaoli.

335
00:49:39,572 --> 00:49:44,247
If you'll excuse me, I have some business
to attend to.

336
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,603
What did you give me?

337
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:56,764
Help the man!

338
00:49:58,284 --> 00:50:00,802
Apparently he can't handle his drink.

339
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:32,197
It's not you they want! They're worth more money
than you've ever seen! Your share alone!

340
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:35,217
I already have a mistress.

341
00:51:37,498 --> 00:51:41,194
- Come on, you have to go. Come on, now!
- What happened?

342
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,324
Let's go! We've been betrayed.

343
00:51:46,112 --> 00:51:49,719
- Hurry, this way.
- Wait, our horses!

344
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:53,106
You'll never pass the city gates.
Go to the river and find a boat.

345
00:51:53,186 --> 00:51:55,851
Head downstream, wait for me
at the Silver Mountain.

346
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:59,366
- There are bandits!
- I know, that's where I was going.

347
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:01,559
- And you?
- I'll meet you there.

348
00:52:02,483 --> 00:52:05,772
If I don't arrive, Shing Yuing
is a day beyond the mountain.

349
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,704
I don't even know your name.

350
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:11,421
Please Lian, go. Go now!

351
00:52:12,669 --> 00:52:14,068
Allright, just go.

352
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:25,688
Untie them all.

353
00:52:49,206 --> 00:52:50,515
Go search the building!

354
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,140
Don't kill him yet!

355
00:53:17,654 --> 00:53:20,207
Where are they? Speak quickly.

356
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:27,656
Tell me now, or I kill you.

357
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,675
General, Prince Qiang and Princess Lian are
on the river headed toward the Silver M ountains.

358
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:35,520
Go after them.

359
00:56:05,756 --> 00:56:07,391
Get to the shore!

360
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:13,571
Run!

361
00:57:33,238 --> 00:57:36,606
<i>Let me go! Let go!</i>

362
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,074
Open your mouth.

363
01:00:21,259 --> 01:00:23,512
It was my choice, I would have let you rot.

364
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:32,894
- My companions?
- Safe!

365
01:00:34,995 --> 01:00:38,857
The Black Guards are as thick as flies on a fart
[...] ask because of you.

366
01:00:39,307 --> 01:00:41,043
You brought them here.

367
01:00:44,803 --> 01:00:48,827
- How did you find me, lad?
- Nobody goes East.

368
01:00:50,965 --> 01:00:52,079
Remember?

369
01:00:56,999 --> 01:01:00,410
There is few [...] of our kind beyond Baghdad.

370
01:01:08,889 --> 01:01:12,990
- We need to talk.
- We have nothing to say. - Please.

371
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:18,037
I should have left you in the woods. For [...]

372
01:01:23,258 --> 01:01:24,780
But you didn't.

373
01:01:30,823 --> 01:01:33,121
As soon as you can move, you leave.

374
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:39,008
Gallain. Gallain, please!

375
01:01:54,473 --> 01:01:58,308
- Please. He lives?
- For now.

376
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:02,984
- You're the outlaw they call the White Ghost?
- I am the White Ghost.

377
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:08,284
But no one calls me outlaw, child.
Not to my face!

378
01:02:09,645 --> 01:02:12,785
- Your friend sent us here.
- My friend?

379
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,705
And you expect that to count in your favor?

380
01:02:16,514 --> 01:02:19,770
- You saved our lives.
- Well, killing Black Guards, that was no hardship.

381
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,037
Your lives have value.

382
01:02:23,485 --> 01:02:24,838
Yes, my love.

383
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:30,050
- Shing will pay handsomely for your return.
- Or he might just kill you. Outlaw!

384
01:02:31,465 --> 01:02:34,717
If we escape my brother,
I will be the King.

385
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:39,756
- How old are you? 10?
- 14 !

386
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:44,618
- And I should help you, because?
- I will give you a reward!

387
01:02:45,021 --> 01:02:49,219
- And you may come down from this mountain!
A free man.
- Now, I do not know.

388
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:54,740
In my experience those who climb to the top only
ever remember they got there by their own effort.

389
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:58,683
- I won't forget!
- Maybe you will, maybe you won't.
I need time to think.

390
01:02:59,503 --> 01:03:02,596
You are lucky my wife likes you.
Where is my wine?!

391
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:08,351
Free them, they got nowhere to run.

392
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:28,991
You were his friend.

393
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,400
We fought alongside one another.

394
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:37,637
- He belives he's damned.
- He's right.

395
01:03:38,744 --> 01:03:41,223
We were, all of us - killers.

396
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:45,224
But he became...

397
01:03:46,983 --> 01:03:48,609
...more than that.

398
01:03:50,705 --> 01:03:54,204
- That what warriors do!
- Some get a taste for blood.

399
01:03:56,114 --> 01:03:57,971
He is not one of them.

400
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:03,020
There was a time I wanted that to be true,
as much as you do now.

401
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,611
At least he still sees hope in others.

402
01:04:09,825 --> 01:04:13,927
Puts his sword at the service of that,
rather than his own game.

403
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:41,448
Your Majesty, we have news!

404
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:48,525
Saddle the horses.

405
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:13,853
Jacob...

406
01:05:15,717 --> 01:05:20,791
- My name is Jacob.
- Nice to meet you, Jacob.

407
01:05:23,778 --> 01:05:27,478
- I am sorry.
- For what?

408
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,271
We'd never have come this far without you.

409
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:43,136
You... don't have to do that.

410
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:46,962
I know. I want to.

411
01:05:48,228 --> 01:05:52,319
There's not much else to do here,
except watch Xaoi eat.

412
01:05:58,903 --> 01:06:00,862
She lives because of you.

413
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:02,978
As do we.

414
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,884
Maybe you've repaid your debt.

415
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:13,852
Rest, for now.

416
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:21,251
Please, help me.

417
01:06:22,453 --> 01:06:24,302
I must see him.

418
01:06:55,464 --> 01:06:56,358
What?

419
01:06:57,908 --> 01:07:00,490
Oh man, don't you ever stop?

420
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:27,358
Here, fucking opium.
It keeps the ghosts away, huh?

421
01:07:28,356 --> 01:07:29,861
This is MY medicine.

422
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,708
What you saw that day...

423
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,713
If it's forgiveness that brought you here,
you've come a long way for nothing.

424
01:07:39,482 --> 01:07:42,637
Perhaps you've come to tell me
it was some terrible mistake?

425
01:07:43,295 --> 01:07:47,376
- That you didn't kill them? Huh?
- I can't tell you that.

426
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:51,175
But they did not die by my sword, I promise.

427
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,434
Riddles give me headaches.

428
01:07:59,494 --> 01:08:02,637
The children were killed by their own mothers.

429
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,923
The women died by their own hands.

430
01:08:24,745 --> 01:08:27,704
Because they fear of what you have become.

431
01:08:28,507 --> 01:08:29,512
Yes.

432
01:08:31,586 --> 01:08:32,845
What is it?

433
01:08:34,091 --> 01:08:37,614
You think if you save this boy,
God will forgive you?

434
01:08:39,794 --> 01:08:43,816
Men can not know God's will,
and when they pretend to...

435
01:08:44,366 --> 01:08:48,323
- ... it ends in blood.
- That I'll drink to.

436
01:09:05,667 --> 01:09:09,400
So what happened to you?
The White Ghost, bandits?

437
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:14,960
I tried my hand as a merchant.
But the Black Guards took all I had.

438
01:09:17,203 --> 01:09:22,055
My wife - she's good with a knife, aint't it?

439
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:29,140
But in one time... she had the most...
beautiful... singing voice.

440
01:09:30,067 --> 01:09:32,141
But the... Guards...

441
01:09:33,744 --> 01:09:36,216
... cut out her tongue!!

442
01:09:37,036 --> 01:09:41,142
Blinded my right eye.
But I still have her.

443
01:09:42,216 --> 01:09:44,391
Which is all that really matters.

444
01:09:45,374 --> 01:09:49,148
If Shing becomes King, this land will burn.

445
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:54,074
All lands burn, Jacob. You know that.

446
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:56,049
Better than anyone.

447
01:09:58,397 --> 01:10:00,175
I have to take a piss.

448
01:10:33,049 --> 01:10:34,719
You should be resting.

449
01:10:35,926 --> 01:10:38,894
I'm younger and healthier than you.

450
01:10:48,973 --> 01:10:50,882
I made a promise to my father.

451
01:10:52,411 --> 01:10:53,984
I swore to him...

452
01:10:55,909 --> 01:10:57,932
... I'd protect Qiang with my life.

453
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,571
But you...

454
01:11:08,321 --> 01:11:09,443
...why?

455
01:11:15,286 --> 01:11:18,407
I once looked for God
in all of the wrong places.

456
01:11:21,662 --> 01:11:24,150
But you... your brother...

457
01:11:26,308 --> 01:11:28,226
It started to make sense again.

458
01:11:33,578 --> 01:11:35,671
My father would have liked you.

459
01:11:37,945 --> 01:11:43,291
Ohhh, I don't know. I think your father
would have taken my head.

460
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:49,291
And rightly so.

461
01:11:52,587 --> 01:11:54,868
Perhaps to the man we first met.

462
01:11:56,698 --> 01:12:00,750
But you... he would have loved.

463
01:12:03,234 --> 01:12:04,950
Lian, I...

464
01:12:31,978 --> 01:12:33,812
He's been out there for hours.

465
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:37,064
With the right people by his side
he will hold the peace.

466
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:43,148
You sound like one of those priests
that blessed us as we marched off to war.

467
01:12:44,809 --> 01:12:46,349
The ghosts...

468
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:50,560
- ...you really see them, too?
- Only when I let my guard down.

469
01:12:51,385 --> 01:12:53,385
And what do they ask of you?

470
01:12:56,357 --> 01:13:00,134
- Mine don't talk.
- They don't need to.

471
01:13:01,784 --> 01:13:04,898
And if they did?
What would the dead whisper?

472
01:13:05,578 --> 01:13:07,381
What is ought, must be paid.

473
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,063
It's not for us to decide when, though.

474
01:13:16,574 --> 01:13:19,236
To the damned, each and every one of us.

475
01:13:21,711 --> 01:13:23,567
You are not hard enough on him.

476
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:27,463
- Gallain, with your help...
- No!

477
01:13:29,566 --> 01:13:31,159
I told you before!

478
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,198
I'm done fighting other men's causes.

479
01:13:35,183 --> 01:13:38,808
- Ah, you could have handed him over to Shing.
- I'm a simple man.

480
01:13:39,258 --> 01:13:42,283
Easily bedazzled by swift-talking
young Princess.

481
01:13:42,598 --> 01:13:46,684
You are many things, none of them simple.

482
01:14:12,378 --> 01:14:14,629
They have [...] reached the riverbank.

483
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:20,355
We have no choice now.
Make what preparations you can!

484
01:14:41,306 --> 01:14:43,886
No more that four bombs in each bag.

485
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:47,427
I chose this place for a reason.

486
01:14:47,635 --> 01:14:50,361
We beat them down below, take as many as we can.

487
01:14:50,441 --> 01:14:52,864
- Bring confusion.
- Fall back to the caves?

488
01:14:54,087 --> 01:14:57,202
- No, you stay here.
- But they're here for me.

489
01:14:58,881 --> 01:15:03,106
And if you die on the Mountain, you will never be
the leader your father wanted.

490
01:15:10,566 --> 01:15:12,123
Be careful.

491
01:16:00,552 --> 01:16:06,598
SHIELDS!! SHIELDS UP!! SHIELDS!!!

492
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:11,564
Return fire! RETURN FIRE NOW!!!

493
01:16:24,611 --> 01:16:25,954
Fall back!!

494
01:17:42,195 --> 01:17:44,070
Get back to the cave, now!!

495
01:17:52,282 --> 01:17:54,652
Back to the cave, we'll finish them there!

496
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:05,898
LET'S GO!!

497
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:17,650
- Get your sister and Xiaoli back to the inner cave.
- I should stay!

498
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:21,705
- You've got nothing more to prove, all right?
Men have died for you, don't let that be in vain.

499
01:18:22,072 --> 01:18:24,423
Go! Go now!

500
01:19:11,165 --> 01:19:13,198
Mei!! NOW!!

501
01:19:16,215 --> 01:19:18,967
The Black Guards!!

502
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:29,154
GO!! GO, MEI, GO!!

503
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:32,531
Go... get the boy... now!

504
01:20:48,747 --> 01:20:52,140
You want my blood?
You want my BLOOD?!

505
01:21:12,438 --> 01:21:17,174
- The others? - Oh, it's just Gallain.
We have to leave, before more Black Guards arrive.

506
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,913
I see you...

507
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:02,287
...woman...

508
01:23:06,225 --> 01:23:07,923
I see you...

509
01:23:32,228 --> 01:23:35,108
Qiang Lian and the white monkey.

510
01:23:36,731 --> 01:23:38,217
Did you help them?

511
01:23:39,954 --> 01:23:41,943
Or was it this one?

512
01:23:51,321 --> 01:23:54,760
No. I think this one is the White Ghost.

513
01:23:58,551 --> 01:24:02,161
- Why?
- Because...

514
01:24:03,607 --> 01:24:05,438
...the boy isn't like us.

515
01:24:07,429 --> 01:24:09,373
And what are we like?

516
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,738
The world will be better without us.

517
01:24:20,425 --> 01:24:23,271
And you... little brother.

518
01:24:25,052 --> 01:24:28,559
Do you really think bandits and barbarians
can win you the throne?

519
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,308
Our father would hate what you have become.

520
01:24:37,902 --> 01:24:39,902
Then it's probably a good thing you killed him.

521
01:25:08,834 --> 01:25:11,605
You've spilled a lot of blood today.

522
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,882
Let's see how much you have left.

523
01:26:49,317 --> 01:26:52,450
Who [...] his bow, dies!

524
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,853
Careful, then. You might cut yourself.

525
01:27:20,295 --> 01:27:23,361
No more, Shing... no more...

526
01:27:29,685 --> 01:27:31,311
