And I will still go to hell
because, you know,
you can't buy redemption.

Everybody wins.

1052
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:28,585
Let's do this thing.
Come on.

Bring your friends.
You have friends?

We got room.

1055

Hey!

1056
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:36,259
[ Hope ]
This thing's insane!

1057
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,361
This school,
it's not like there's
a two-year wait.

1058
00:51:38,394 --> 00:51:40,597
It's, like,
there's a six-year wait.

1059
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,632
What are you saying?

1060
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:46,369
I'm saying I'm gonna get Hope
and you put on a shirt
with some fucking buttons.

1061
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:48,371
Hey, Hope.
Come here, baby.

I love it!
It's so cool!

  everything in it!
- [ Tom ] Okay.

1066
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:06,189
It looks like
it could be a house!
Maybe he lives in here!

1067
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:09,459
Shh.

1068
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:09,459
I'm sure he really does,
but it's still cool!

1069
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:11,628
And I can't even
stop talking!

1070
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,598
[ Danny ] I wrote him,
and then I talked to him
on the phone.

1071
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:17,634
So, do you know
Dr. Kurtz?

1072
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,370
Sometimes he does
a talk-back thing
on his blog.

1073
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:23,706
On his what?

1074
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:23,706
His blog.
He writes a blog.

1075
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:25,308
What's a block?

1076
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:25,308
A blog.

1077
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,776
It's a--

1078
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,776
A blog.

1079
00:52:26,809 --> 00:52:28,611
I can't believe
I'm gonna meet him.

We're all gonna draw
our inner animals.

1082
00:52:39,522 --> 00:52:42,559
This is a school?

1083
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,894
The blog
doesn't do it justice.

1084
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,894
I know.

1085
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1086
00:52:47,263 --> 00:52:50,667
Sorry I'm dressed
like Jack LaLanne.
Elastic only on the weekends.

I'm Dr. Kurtz.

Shock-a-ma-lyah!

You really are

Yes, I am.
You're really Dr. Kurtz.

My wife, Samantha.
My daughter, Hope.

1094

My balls are in her purse,
in case you wanna
meet them later.

1095
00:53:06,415 --> 00:53:09,786
It's a lot different
than talking on the phone.

1096
00:53:06,415 --> 00:53:09,786
Well, I hope so.

1097
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,888
You must be Hope.

Tom.
Then you must be Hope.

1100
00:53:16,525 --> 00:53:18,895
Hi. Samantha Donnelly.
I follow you on Twitter.

1101
00:53:18,928 --> 00:53:20,830
Well, thank you, but--

1102
00:53:18,928 --> 00:53:20,830
She reads your blog.

1103
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:23,433
Then wh-who's Hope?

00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:27,637
I'm Hope! Over here!
That's me! I'm seven!
I'm Hope!

00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,907
How are you?
Let me show you around!

1106
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,009
Come on, you.
You started all this.

1107
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:35,612
[ Danny ]
Oh, I did.

1108
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:39,515
- Mom, Dad! You're not
  gonna believe it!
- Hope. Hope!

1109
00:53:39,548 --> 00:53:42,719
She's okay.
She'll be all right.
She's fine.

1110
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:46,489
It was in the first grade
when we started to notice that
she was having some trouble.

1111
00:53:46,522 --> 00:53:48,691
Yeah, we got a tutor
for her once a week,

1112
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:51,261
and I do these exercises
with her every night, really.

1113
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:51,261
Every night.

1114
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,762
But she's got trouble
with focus.

1115
00:53:52,795 --> 00:53:54,897
It's been a real struggle
for us. Really.

1116
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,500
Yeah. Yeah.

1117
00:53:57,533 --> 00:54:00,970
Most schools try
to train children like Hope
to fit into their systems.

1118
00:54:01,003 --> 00:54:02,972
We prefer to tailor a program
to the child's needs.

1119
00:54:03,005 --> 00:54:04,974
It's like one big IEP here.

your homework, Mr. Collins.

show you the rest.

Do you remember who did
the original assessment?

[ Kurtz ]
We're only half speed
during our summer programs,

1131
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,498
but you can still
get a sense of the place.

1132
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,000
[ Danny ] Oh, yeah.
I got a sense of it already.

1133
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:31,000
How about that, huh?

1134
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:34,604
[ Samantha ] So, is this just
"K" through five, or all the way
"K" through eight?

1135
00:54:34,637 --> 00:54:36,806
No, elementary and middle.

1136
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,742
We'd carry her through the
eighth grade, then place her
in one of our accredited--

1137
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:42,679
No, no, no.
We live in New Jersey.
We can't come all the way in.

1138
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:46,783
No, she'll have a driver.
Every day to
and from school.

1139
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,285
Every day,
through college.

1140
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:52,322
I'll put that
in writing.

1141
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:54,357
Guaranteed.

1142
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,959
A more formal interview
is required, obviously,

1143
00:54:56,992 --> 00:55:00,997
but considering Mr. Collins's
generous donation and what
I see in Hope's records,

1144
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:03,066
I suspect the interview
will go well.

1145
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:07,103
You have a lot to discuss,
but trust me, you want this.

1146
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:10,740
This can change
the course of Hope's life.
I'll give you guys a minute.

- Got a good grandpa.

to the fun stuff.

1154
00:55:26,422 --> 00:55:29,525
What fun stuff? I--
No, we're just gonna
go back home. Right?

1155
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:31,594
No, you said a day.
Remember?

1156
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:31,594
No, I didn't.

1157
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:33,563
We agreed to it.

- I don't think "agreed"
  is the word.

- Samantha. For God's sake.

You are

trying to become

But I'm exhausted.

You have no idea
how exhausting that has been.

You know,
when I met your mom,

00:57:54,036 --> 00:57:55,939

1192
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:01,010
And when I found out,
you know,

I tried to help.

She wouldn't
have any of it.
Refused it.

1196

But, you know,
my life was so extreme.

1197
00:58:14,823 --> 00:58:19,028
It was so full
of drugs and women
and traveling...

and all that
rock star shit.

1199
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:26,903
I always thought,
whoever you were,

that you'd be better off
with a more normal life,

to go on this long.
