196
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,690
You come around the side.

197
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,125
 Well, you're too fast for me.

198
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,727
I had to be a little sneaky.

199
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,529
 Ah, look what I got, Granny!

200
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,697
A nice, tender morsel.

201
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,065
Should we put gravy on her

202
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,634
and just gobble her up?

203
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,202
 No, Grandpa,

204
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,471
then I wouldn't be here anymore.

205
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,872
 Oh, yes, baby, you'll

206
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:20,840
be here.

207
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,908
Once you're in the heart

208
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,142
you're always there.

209
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,610
Come on.

210
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,019
 Grandpa Luther was a cobbler,

211
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,587
but when the shop was closed

212
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,888
he got laid off.

213
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,623
He stood on that unemployment

214
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,225
line for weeks until finally

215
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,593
it ran out.

216
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,128
Made me sad to see it,

217
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,529
but Grandpa and Grandma

218
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,064
wouldn't have no sadness.

219
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:46,632
They made those summers I spent

220
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,034
with them the happiest of my

221
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,101
life.

222
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,207
Grandma Teeden believed

223
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,641
whatever you do in your life

224
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,243
you do it right.

225
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,145
 You shaved yet?

226
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,013
 I ain't even out of bed.

227
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,982
It's 5:30 AM, woman.

228
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,283
 I'm putting up buns,

229
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,551
getting the milk, you get

230
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,086
yourself down here.

231
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,789
Your shirt's all pressed.

232
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,792
 She believed a man gets up

233
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,993
and gets dressed and looks

234
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,728
for work, whether there is any

235
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,762
or not.

236
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,033
 Where's my shirt?

237
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,268
 On the chair.

238
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,704
If it was a snake it'd bit ya.

239
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,775
 You are something else,

240
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,744
Theresa, going through this

241
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,812
foolery every day.

242
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,946
 Well, I won't have the

243
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,181
neighbors thinking just 'cause

244
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,183
you was laid off you lie around

245
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,851
in bed all day in your

246
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,253
nightclothes.

247
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,088
 Okay.

248
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,289
 Just sit right there.

249
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,624
Right here, where everyone

250
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,291
can see you.

251
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,926
Right here-- sit down.

252
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,628
 Grandpa was a good sport.

253
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,662
 That's right.

254
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:50,997
 Well, he made a fuss,

255
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,765
but in the end if it made

256
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,133
Grandma Teeden happy he'd sit

257
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,668
on the porch all day in his

258
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,570
suit and tie and wave at

259
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,237
the neighbors.

260
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,242
I called her Grandma Teeden

261
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,110
'cause when I was little

262
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,711
I couldn't say her name.

263
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,779
So she just stayed Grandma

264
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,681
Teeden.

265
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,049
She sat in the same seat

266
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,250
three times a week, rain or

267
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,985
shine, 'cause it was near the

268
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,053
piano and she wanted me

269
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,688
close to the music.

270
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,089
 There's someone sitting

271
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,791
in your seat.

272
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,029
 No one else dared sit

273
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,597
in Grandma Teeden's seat.

274
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,103
(clearing throat)

275
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,940
 Young man, the Lord spoke

276
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,676
to me not minutes ago, and He

277
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,111
told me, "Theresa, this little

278
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,112
girl needs to sit

279
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,247
near the piano."

280
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,916
And-- And then He told me,

281
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,785
"You go over there and you

282
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,920
explain to him how important

283
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,189
it is for him to move."

284
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:02,201
♪♪

285
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,236
That was very nice of him.

 Grandma loved to sing.

294
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,060
She said it was God putting

295
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,730
a holiday in your heart.

296
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,732
And I'm gonna sing on television

297
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,799
and records.

298
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,768
 Well, I bet you are.

299
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,036
 And I'm gonna be at the

300
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,006
Grand Ole Opry, like The Judds.

301
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,109
 Now how do you know all that?

302
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,778
 I just do.

303
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,880
 I believe you.

304
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,117
Well, that means you're gonna be

305
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,786
away a lot, and you'll be

306
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,955
traveling here and there.

307
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,356
And-- And there's gonna be times

308
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,458
when you feel far away.

309
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,260
 Grandma, what if you get

310
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,463
so far away God can't find you?

311
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,832
 Oh, no, baby, He can always

312
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,833
find you.

313
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,201
When you start feeling that way

314
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,369
you just say to yourself,

315
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:14,106
"Who moved, me or God?"

316
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,009
 I moved.

317
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,344
 That's right.

318
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,413
God never moves.

319
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,415
We're the ones.

320
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,484
Good night.

321
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:26,952
 Good night.

322
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,026
 LeAnn, honey,

323
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,361
LeAnn, baby, wake up.

324
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,762
We're pulling into Nashville.

325
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,430
You need to get up and get

326
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,297
dressed-- ooh!

327
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,899
Watch the head.

328
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,075
 Nashville: across that bridge

329
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,311
was everything I dreamed about.

330
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,155
Hey, look, y'all, it's

331
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:04,390
The Grand Ole Opry.

332
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,426
But we weren't playing there.

333
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,961
We were playing the Graystone

334
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:10,296
Auditorium on West Fourth.

335
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:13,299
(cheers and applause)

336
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,141
But you know what?

337
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,409
Our bus pulled in and for

338
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,010
the first time in my career

339
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,113
there were people, fans,

340
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,214
wanting my autograph,

341
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:29,148
knowing my music.

342
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,150
It was amazing.

343
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,054
 They put you in your own

344
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:35,955
dressing room.

345
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,022
It's got a shower.

346
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,390
Tomorrow you rest 'cause

347
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,126
the next day we got wall to wall

348
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,026
meetings.

349
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,094
Gotta be at the record company

350
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,329
at 10:00, then they're taking us

351
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,563
over to see some publishers.

352
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,165
 Can I have your autograph,

353
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,032
please?

354
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,100
 Sure, sweetie.

355
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,804
Here you go.

356
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,105
Thank you.

357
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,473
 Uh, Lee, they want a picture

358
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,541
over here.

359
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,209
These gentlemen right here.

360
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,410
 Hi.

361
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,183
 Lee, you wanna go over

362
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,050
the set list?

363
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,051
You wanna do "Blue" right here

364
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,319
or where we talked about?

365
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,220
 If we talked about it,

366
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,355
why would we move it?

367
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,456
 That's what I told you.

368
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,924
You guys are driving me nuts.

369
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,259
Here's the rundown, no changes.

370
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,326
I don't care if the President

371
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,261
calls.

372
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,495
 I do!

373
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,370
 Leave it, Mom.

374
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,271
 It's hanging in your face.

375
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,272
 I like it, it's natural.

376
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,206
 Looks like one of Grandma's

377
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,140
old mops.

378
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,276
 I like it.

379
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,610
Okay, guys, it's time.

380
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,112
 Okay, everybody.

381
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,280
LeAnn needs to get herself

382
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,347
together.

383
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,482
Let's take our office outside

384
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,950
in the hall.

385
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,555

stage at the Grand Ole Opry

582
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,925

00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,894

But things were gonna get

585

a whole lot stranger.

We're going out tomorrow.

591

I know where you're staying,

I'll pick you up.

596
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,916
 What?

597
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,117
 Gotta show you while

598
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,386
I tell you, can't do it here.

599
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,754
 Why not?

600
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,422
 Can't.

603
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,859
get away?

604
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,427
 Then you'll miss it.

 Yeah, I got a car,

613
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,641
but what's wrong with walking?

614
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,677
 Walk?

615
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,512
 I see legs down there.

616
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:02,681
 Well, yeah, but I mean,

617
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,548
on the street you're

618
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,583

619
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,517
 Honey, you keep thinking

620
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,551
people's gonna bother me?

621
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,520
Ain't nobody remembers.

622
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,888
The tourists in Nashville

623
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,857
weren't born when I was hot.

624
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,725
And the ones who know me

625
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,660
is too old to care.

626
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,529
You're gonna be the problem.

627
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:18,530
Now here's what we're

628
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,765
gonna do, Missy.

629
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,500
You wear loose clothes,

630
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,201
you put your hair in a ponytail.

631
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,069
You pull it through the back

632
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,437
of an old baseball cap

633
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:26,705
and you slap on the biggest

634
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,173
sunglasses you can find.

635
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,741
Looking like that, you can go

636
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,176
anywhere in this town.

637
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,577
 I don't know.

638
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,712
 It's true, girl.

639
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,014
Reba does it, and she can walk

640
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,049
into any Walmart in the nation.

641
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,551
 You think?

642
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,886
 I know.

643
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,690

646
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,033
I feel like I should stop and

647
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,169
take it all in.

648
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,738
 That's what memories are for.

649
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,641
You remember every single

650
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,809
second of it.

651
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:07,078
For the rest of your life.

652
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,647
 LeAnn! LeAnn!

654
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,249

655
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:14,119

657
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,591
 Can I take a couple more?

658
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,026
I promise I'll get it to you.

659
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,063
That's it.

660
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,567
 Thanks, guys.

661
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,234

 I know the numbers, but she's

732
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,094
more sensible than most of the

733
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,062

734
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:38,196
 Sensible does not mean--

769
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,699
 That's wonderful, sweetheart.

770
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,334
Uh, do you know where Mom

771
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,201

772
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,436

773

774
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,338
 Well, they're at some

775
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,239

776
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,206
Is everything all right?

777
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,042
 Well...

778
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:01,146
LeAnn, your Grandma Teeden's

779
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,313

780
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:05,717
 Oh. What do you mean?

781
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,152
Is it her stomach?

782
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,720
 Yeah.

783
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,155
 Is she all right?

784
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,956

 Grandpa, she always rallies,

787
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,163
She gets these stomach fits

788
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:19,164
all the time.

789
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,365
 LeAnn, I'm calling from

790
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,200

791
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,402

Well, what's wrong with her?

793
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,443
 Well, they don't know yet.

794
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:32,444
They started her on a bunch

795
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,046
of tests and they said they'd

796
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,448

797
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,349

813
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,408
heart's weak.

814
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,443
She could have a heart attack

815

00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,571
This part you're gonna like.

960
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,276
 I don't like this.

961
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,377
I gotta get back, I gotta go--

962
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,278
 You're gonna be back with

963
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,880
plenty of time...

964
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,883
for whatever you have to do.

965
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:21,919
Come on.

966
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,323
 Are you crazy?

967
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,225
I'm not going in here.

968
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,160
Ax murderers hang out in places

969
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,528
like this.

970
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,563
 I've got ax-murderer spray

971
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,298
in my purse.

972
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,501
Okay, get up there, girl.

973
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,503
 Oh, God, what is this place?

974
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,271
It looks haunted.

975
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,672
I don't like it.

976
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,673
 How do you know

977
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:43,608
until you get there?

978
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,775
 Well, you really don't have

979
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,877
to lay an egg to know

980
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,645
it's rotten.

981
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,848
Okay, it's locked, let's go.

982
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:54,852
(birds cooing, wings flapping)

983
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,724
 Oh, this I wore the night

984
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:02,426
I first played the Opry.

985
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:04,295
 Are these all your costumes?

986
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,364
 Mmm, not just mine.

987
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,368
(screaming)

988
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,435
(chuckling)

989
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,371
Oh, that's just Horace.

990
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,206
We put him here to discourage

991
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:16,841
folks from breaking in.

992
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,309
 We?

993
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,410
This is your place?

994
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,679
 No, honey, this nice old man

995
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,314
used to let us keep our costumes

996
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,448
and stuff here when we went

997
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,650
on the road.

998
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,817
Pickle?

999
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,521
 Who wore this?

1000
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,256
 Ernest Tubbs.

1001
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,624
 No way.

1002
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:36,727
 Yep, and these are his boots.

1003
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,297
Bo Riddle made 'em.

1004
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,264
 Well, what are they

1005
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,799
doing here?

1006
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,334
Why doesn't anybody know

1007
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:44,502
about this?

1008
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,304
 I know about it,

1009
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:47,738
you know about it.

1010
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:48,673
 I mean--

1011
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,674
 It's private.

1012
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,513
 Oh, wow!

1013
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:03,354
It's beautiful, what is it?

1014
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,589
 It's a set they built

1015
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,524
for a movie I was gonna make.

1016
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,461
 Oh, look at the cute little--

1017
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:12,997
Oh, it's Nashville.

1018
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,269
But it doesn't snow

1019
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,036
in Nashville.

1020
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:21,005
 Oh, yeah, it does.

1021
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,773
 But not like this.

1022
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,675
 It did once.

1023
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,445
 Look at the cute little bus.

1024
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,713
 Yeah.

1025
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,915
It's an old one.

1026
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,284
Them buses was always cold

1027
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,919
in the winter, hot in

1028
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,820
the summer.

1029
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,821
Here.

1030
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,657
 What's this?

1031
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:40,925
 Part of the reason

1032
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,994
I brought you here.

1033
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,562
It was Tennessee's worst

1034
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:45,830
snowstorm.

1035
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,032
The temperature fell 62 degrees

1036
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,667
in 24 hours.

1037
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:53,571
An Arctic onslaught.

1038
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,674
Them big newspaper words.

1039
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,410
Took a lot of lives, that storm.

1040
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,545
 What does this have to do--

1041
00:38:01,545 --> 00:38:02,847
 If you was on the road when

1042
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,615
the blizzard hit,

1043
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,617
you was in trouble.

1044
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,452
 Were you?

1045
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,720

1046
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,555

1047
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,758

1048
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:15,059
forever breaking down.

1049
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,661

00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,042
(people screaming)

1149
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,920
 Are you all right?

1150
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,188
Is everyone okay?

1151
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,790
 All right, yeah.

1152
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,258
 Everybody okay back there?

1153
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,864
 We didn't know what hit us

1154
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,031
or what we hit.

1155
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,202
 Are you okay?

1156
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,740
 Is everyone all right?

1157
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,709
I'm real sorry, folks.

1158
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,711
We must have left the main road.

1159
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,746
It feels like we hit something.

1160
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,581
I'll try and get the door.

1161
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:05,956
 Looks like we're wedged

1162
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,258
between two trees or something.

1163
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,660
 Can you get it open?

1164
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,061
 Nope.

1165
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,597
She's wedged.

1166
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:14,999
 You mean we're stuck here?

1167
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,867
 It looks that way, ma'am.

1168
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:24,875
 See, it took a while for

1169
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,243
everyone to realize the

1170
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:28,245
situation we were in.

1171
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,313
 Well, how long were

1172
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,614
you there?

1173
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,082
 Long.

1174
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,317
 All night?

1175
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,319
 All night and then some.

1176
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,054
Makes me hungry thinking

1177
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,622
about it.

1178
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,225
 Well, so, what happened?

1179
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,293
I mean, couldn't the driver

1180
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,361
radio for help?

1181
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,096
 This old bus didn't have

1182
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,197
no radio, girl,

1183
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,299
what are you thinking?

1184
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,034
Pork rind?

1185
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,802
 Mm-mmm.

1186
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,203
 When we went into those

1187
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,040
trees, we were on a blacktop

1188
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,908
road just off the old state

1189
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,343
highway between Lyles

1190
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,645
and Wrigley.

1191
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:02,646
Did you ever hear of

1192
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:03,814
them places?

1193
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,182
 No.

1194
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:06,850
 I don't think nobody

1195
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,620
but God had either.

1196
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,289
(engine sputtering)

1197
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,758
Once the motor went dead,

1198
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,161
there was no more heat.

1199
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,399
 Well, how come you didn't

1200
00:43:22,399 --> 00:43:23,801
make a fire?

1201
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,669
 Carbon monoxide poisoning

1202
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,404
in that closed place.

1203
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:28,706
We would have fallen asleep

1204
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,741
and woke up dead.

1205
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,812
Speaking of which...

1206
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,715
I ain't feeling so good.

1207
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:45,723
I hope you don't got

1208
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,091
a weak stomach, honey.

1209
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,895
I'm just gonna give myself

1210
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,766
a little injection here,

1211
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:59,370
and soon...

1212
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,207
I'll be feeling right fine.

1213
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,778
 Why did she bring me here?

1214
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:08,445
To show me that she was

1215
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,180
a junkie?

1216
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,749
I didn't want to see it.

1217
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,083
It made me sick.

1218
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,319
Why do people always show you

1219
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,121
things that hurt you?

1220
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,259
I couldn't look at her.

1221
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,028
She had been my idol and now

1222
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,095
she was just a pathetic

1223
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,363
drug addict.

1224
00:44:26,363 --> 00:44:28,699
I hated her for it.

1225
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:29,733
 I hope I didn't make you

1226
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:31,035
uncomfortable, honey.

1227
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:34,405
I-- I saw you was looking away.

1228
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,346
Well, it embarrasses me, too,

1229
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,115
but there's-- gotta do what

1230
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:45,983
you gotta do.

1231
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,152
 I don't know why.

1232
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,188
 Honey, there's things

1233
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,423
that you can't help.

1234
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,457
 But aren't you afraid of

1235
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,358
going to jail or getting

1236
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,126
arrested or something?

1237
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:03,934
 What did you think that was?

1238
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:04,902
Dope?

1239
00:45:04,902 --> 00:45:05,936
 Well, of course.

1240
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,137
What else could it be?

1241
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,873
 Oh, my Lord.

1242
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,376
Oh. (chuckling)

1243
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,311
Insulin.

1244
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,347
 Oh.

1245
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,382
 I'm a diabetic.

1246
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,050
I take insulin to regulate

1247
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:20,984
my sugar.

1248
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:21,885
Ain't you never heard

1249
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,253
of a diabetic before?

1250
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,456
 Well, yeah, but...

1251
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,424
I've never-- just never met one.

1252
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:28,325
 Well, there's thousands

1253
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,027
of us out there.

1254
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:31,795
People used to die from it

1255
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,497
'til they discovered insulin.

1256
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:34,932
I only need to inject it

1257
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:35,933
twice a day, though,

1258
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,835
then I'm fine.

1259
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:39,136
 Oh, I see.

1260
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,771
Well... (chuckles)

1261
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,306
I'm so sorry, I just thought

1262
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,508
that... well, next time you

1263
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,376
do it, I won't turn away.

1264
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:47,945
 I won't need to do it

1265
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,347
until way late tonight.

1266
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:51,949
 What happens if you don't

1267
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,784
take your shot?

1268
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:55,486
 I go into a coma.

1269
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:57,521
Leave me that way long enough

1270
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,456
and poof!

1271
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,258
But it hasn't happened yet,

1272
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,559
can't you tell?

1273
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,263
 Okay, so finish your story.

1274
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,799
 Where was I?

1275
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,068
 Are you testing me?

1276
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,304
Well, you and all those people

1277
00:46:14,304 --> 00:46:15,539
were locked in this bus

1278
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,241
in the blizzard, freezing.

1279
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,042
 That's right.

1280
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,411
Well, in those days it took

1281
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,913
a long time to get from one

1282
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,248
place to another so people

1283
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,916
packed lunches.

1284
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,951
Picnic baskets.

1285
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,119
 This here sandwich

1286
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,320
is froze solid.

1287
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,822
 Pass it over here,

1288
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,223
I'll thaw it out for you.

1289
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,469
 Did you have enough to eat?

1290
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,237
 Yes, thank you.

1291
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,106
I had me some sandwiches from

1292
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,107
that kind little girl

1293
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,208
and her mama.

1294
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,010
 He's blind.

1295
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:54,311
 We fetched him over and

1296
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,479
took care of him.

1297
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,947
 They shouldn't be traveling

1298
00:46:56,947 --> 00:46:58,115
by themselves.

1299
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,385
 He's blind, not deaf.

1300
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,457
 Hey, hey, folks, folks,

1301
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:10,394
we ain't at a church picnic.

1302
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,129
Now look, we've got to have

1303
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:13,530
some kind of plan.

1304
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,332
If someone doesn't come for us

1305
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,900
soon we're gonna be in

1306
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,868
big trouble.

1307
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:18,902
Do you know what the temperature

1308
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:19,570
is here?

1309
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,038
 Cold.

1310
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,174
 Yeah.

1311
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,609
Well, now, look, I think

1312
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,910
some of us ought to go for help.

1313
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:27,578
Come on.

1314
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:28,512
 Go where?

1315
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,880
It's below zero out there.

1316
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,215
You wouldn't get ten feet

1317
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:32,249
in that blizzard.

1318
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,951
 At least we're safe in here.

1319
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,018
When we don't get to where

1320
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,153
we're supposed to be

1321
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:39,189
they'll send people for us.

1322
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,959
 Well, well, now,

1323
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,061
Miss Singing Star,

1324
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,263
what makes you think so, huh?

1325
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:47,898
I mean, you heard any cars

1326
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,266
pass by out there in the last,

1327
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:51,134
what, six hours?

1328
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,981
 We'd run out of water

1329
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,983
hours before.

1330
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:08,986
We was so cold and so thirsty,

1331
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,520
the only thing left was to

1332
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,655
try and sleep.

1333
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,523
I wish we had a radio.

1334
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:14,691
 (chuckles) I'll give you

1335
00:48:14,691 --> 00:48:16,460
the news: Tennessee is under

1336
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,061
ten feet of snow.

1337
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,264
 I mean for music.

1338
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,200
 You should go to sleep.

1339
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:34,578
 ♪ I need thee every hour

1340
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:41,218

♪ Or life is vain

1353
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,425
 Well, wait a minute.

1354
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,626
What about your insulin?

1355
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,161
Did you have enough with you?

1356
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,262
 In time.

1357
00:49:59,262 --> 00:50:01,631
That's a big part of the story.

1358
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,100
 Well, I guess I'll hear it,

1359
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,800
but I'd like it to be

1360
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,469
in this lifetime.

1361
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,441
What?

1362
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,477
 I was thinking,

1363
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:16,113
how's your Grandma Teeden?

1364
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,514
 How'd you know about her?

1365
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,483
 You mentioned her.

1366
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,118
 I did?

1367
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:22,753
When?

1368
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:24,321
 At the Opry.

1369
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,056
 Oh.

1370
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,257
She's not doing too good.

1371
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,658
She's in the hospital.

1372
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:31,228
 She gonna be all right?

1373
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:33,130
 Well, she always rallies and

1374
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,299
she's real strong, but...

1375
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,135
I really don't know.

1376
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,204
 How old is she?

1377
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,808
 About 60 or 70, I guess.

1378
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:48,078
 That's a big spread, honey.

1379
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,180
 How am I supposed to know?

1380
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,149
She always looks the same to me.

1381
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:53,116
 I bet she knows

1382
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:54,284
how old you are.

1383
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,285
 Well, of course.

1384
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,386
She was there when I was born.

1385
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,156
I wasn't there when she was.

1386
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,458
 That's a point.

1387
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,392
Whoops!

1388
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,194
Gotta go, come on.

1389
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:05,662
 Well, what about the story?

1390
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,097
 Come on, come on,

1391
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:08,131
we gotta go.

1392
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,366
 Go.

1393
00:51:09,366 --> 00:51:10,333
We're always going.

1394
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,535
We never finish anything.

1395
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:12,803
 We don't got all night.

1396
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,670
You're singing at the Grand

1397
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,305
Ole Opry.

1398
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,141
 I couldn't believe what

1399
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,142
I was doing here with this

1400
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,343
crazy woman in an alley

1401
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:22,279
miles from anywhere.

1402
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:23,713
I wanted out.

1403
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:24,681
 Where are you going?

1404
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:26,416
That's our ride.

1405
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,719
Get in.

1406
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,224
 Hi.

1407
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,159
 LeAnn, this is Carl,

1408
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,461
my husband.

1409
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,830
 Well, you're...

1410
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,131
(chuckling)

1411
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,799
Wait a minute, he was the guy--

1412
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:43,867
 Things ain't always

1413
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,902
what they seem, are they?

1414
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:49,473
 Well, get in, girl.

1415
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,208
 I don't know why I got in.

1416
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,243
I just did.

1417
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:54,411
That was the thing about her.

1418
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,378
She made you think the

1419
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,280
craziest thing was normal.

1420
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,518
Then I started seeing headlines:

1421
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,887
"Singer Kidnapped By Maniacs".

1422
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:16,299
Seems like we were driving

1423
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,501
forever.

1424
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,369
It started getting dark and

1425
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:21,371
I started getting real worried.

1426
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,173
Where are we going?

1427
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,652
Oh.

1428
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,853
We're going to where you had

1429
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,322
the bus accident?

1430
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,891
Is there anything there?

1431
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,793
 All right,

1432
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,562
it's right about here.

1433
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,331
Get out, this is it.

1434
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,233
 Are we going to see the bus?

1435
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,613
Where are you taking me?

1436
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,459
 What do you think, honey?

1437
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,528
Ain't it a dandy?

1438
00:53:21,965 --> 00:53:23,567
It's got a steel frame

1439
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,569
covered in weatherproof plastic.

1440
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:26,836
You can almost see through it.

1441
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:27,704
What's the word?

1442
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,738
 Translucent.

1443
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:29,940
 Yeah.

1444
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,775
And the insides is filled with

1445
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,010
12-volt bulbs, like car

1446
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,011
headlights.

1447
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,380
You can see it for miles.

1448
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,748
Trouble is there usually ain't

1449
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,750
nobody around for miles.

1450
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,253
Did you think you was meeting

1451
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,321
your maker when that light

1452
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:45,889
came on?

1453
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,557
 How do you know about this?

1454
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,559
I mean, how does it work

1455
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,927
way out here in this field?

1456
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,896
 Carl and me made it.

1457
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,564
He was a welder by trade

1458
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,433
back when he worked.

1459
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,336
 But how does it...

1460
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,771
 It's got a motion detector.

1461
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,709
 This here is where 18 people

1462
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,810
nearly breathed their

1463
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,478
last breath.

1464
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,948
Soon as we move on,

1465
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:15,385
lights go off, it's black again.

1466
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,020
Don't you know this cross has

1467
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,521
scared a few people half

1468
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:19,589
to death when it come on

1469
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,558
way out here. (chuckling)

1470
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,560
 Why did you do it?

1471
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,365
 Memory.

1472
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:31,635
I got one more story

1473
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:32,969
to tell you.

1474
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,839
I had a visitor that year

1475
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,040
when I was in Nashville:

1476
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,908
my dad.

1477
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,443
He had ridden the bus all the

1478
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,045
way from Conway, Arkansas,

1479
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,713
where I was raised.

1480
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,386
He had written me three letters

1481
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,754
saying he'd be at my house

1482
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,323
for Christmas, but I didn't

1483
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:54,524
answer one of 'em.

1484
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:55,925
 Why not?

1485
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,932
 Well, honey...

1486
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,468
my daddy and me hadn't spoken

1487
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,104
for nigh on 25 years.

1488
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,372
 But--

1489
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,441
 Back when I left home,

1490
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:12,809
nice girls didn't go into

1491
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:15,545
show business.

1492
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:18,081
Least not where I come from.

1493
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,452
 ♪ I need thee

1494
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,854
♪ Oh, I need thee

1495
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,122
♪ Every...

1496
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,991
 I was always singing.

1497
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,426
I guess everybody sung

1498
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:32,696
back then, but I wanted to sing

1499
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,931
country...

1500
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,701
at the Grand Ole Opry.

1501
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:45,909
 If you'd open your Bibles

1502
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:46,943
with me please to the book

1503
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,145
of Isaiah.

1504
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,086
 As soon as I graduated

1505
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,987
high school, I bought a bus

1506
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,490
ticket out of town.

1507
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,892
(voices arguing, muffled)

1508
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,143
 Listen, I can't give her

1509
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:22,612
my blessing.

1510
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:23,947
Listen to me, you step out

1511
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,181
of this house, and you have

1512
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,182
no daddy!

1513
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:27,517
I mean it, girl!

1514
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:28,818
You have no daddy.

1515
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,421
 You'll never see her again.

1516
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,629
 Daddy kept his word.

1517
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,566
The only time he contacted me

1518
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:45,902
was to tell me my mama had died.

1519
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,941
I got his letter the day

1520
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,510
after the funeral.

1521
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,013
When I had them hit records and

1522
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:58,181
everybody started to know me

1523
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,216
all of a sudden people I hadn't

1524
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,184
heard from in years

1525
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:03,520
was related to me.

1526
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,088
That's when I got them letters

1527
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,189
from Daddy telling me

1528
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,957
he was coming to see me.

1529
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,092
You know what I thought

1530
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,527
he wanted?

1531
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,694
I thought he was coming to

1532
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:13,530
ask me for money.

1533
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,498
That's what everybody else

1534
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:16,466
wanted.

1535
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:19,135
You'll find that out.

1536
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,703
 But you didn't...

1537
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:22,472
 That's right.

1538
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,708
I couldn't let go of my hurt,

1539
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,744
my pride.

1540
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,680
I didn't see my own daddy

1541
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,750
when he came to town...

1542
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,084
for Christmas.

1543
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,856
I was still so angry,

1544
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:41,491
I didn't ever want to see him

1545
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:42,625
again.

1546
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,698
I left him a note

1547
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,567
and went off to do my show.

1548
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,604
In two hours I knew I'd be

1549
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:58,074
on that bus and out of town.

1550
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,976
Then I discovered I didn't

1551
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,778
have my insulin.

1552
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,714
 It must be in there.

1553
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:05,815
 It's not.

1554
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,884
My whole purse is missing

1555
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:09,152
and my medicine.

1556
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,687
 Maybe-- Maybe we put it in

1557
00:58:10,687 --> 00:58:11,554
with the music.

1558
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:13,656
 My shot was way past due.

1559
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,996
If the cold didn't kill me,

1560
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:22,031
I knew for sure the diabetic

1561
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,867
coma would.

1562
00:58:23,867 --> 00:58:25,568
 What's wrong, honey?

1563
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,703
 Nobody could've heard me

1564
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,171
crying except a mouse.

1565
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,640
 I, um, I-- it's okay.

1566
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,242
Uh, you wouldn't understand.

1567
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,877
 Maybe I would.

1568
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,178
Never can tell.

1569
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,914
 Or a blind person.

1570
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,185
I'm diabetic and I don't have

1571
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,953
any insulin.

1572
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,157
 That disease took my sight.

1573
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:52,929
I'll be danged if I let it

1574
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,264
take my life.

1575
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,066
It ain't gonna take yours

1576
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,701
neither, honey,

1577
00:58:58,701 --> 00:58:59,802
'cause I got enough insulin

1578
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,771
in here for both of us.

1579
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:03,606
 Seems like that old man

1580
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:05,608
was there whenever I needed

1581
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,677
something on that trip.

1582
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,921
 Your speaking voice is as

1583
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:19,689
pretty as your singing.

1584
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,257
 You know me?

1585
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,092
 I know exactly who you are.

1586
00:59:23,092 --> 00:59:24,260
That's why I asked for your

1587
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,628
autograph.

1588
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,096
You're my favorite singer.

1589
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:31,234
 I can't believe you

1590
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,802
recognize me just from

1591
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,704
hearing me speak.

1592
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,839
 I see with my ears.

1593
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:39,075
You also sang a hymn.

1594
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,077
I'm hoping someday you'll

1595
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,746
record a gospel album.

1596
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,082
Gospel's what I love.

1597
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,022
 I guess you say things

1598
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,792
in a situation like that.

1599
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,060
Things you never share

1600
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,062
with a stranger.

1601
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:02,065
He was a harsh man,

1602
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,100
and he couldn't tell I had

1603
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,202
this burning dream.

1604
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,304
 Well, sometimes you can't

1605
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:10,907
see someone else's dreams.

1606
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,649
 People say you should take

1607
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:22,652
pride, then in the next breath

1608
01:00:22,652 --> 01:00:24,120
they say you should swallow

1609
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,355
your pride.

1610
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,856
I didn't know what to do

1611
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:28,358
with mine so I did the wrong

1612
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,726
thing.

1613
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:32,895
 Oh, honey, it is so easy

1614
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,031
to do the wrong thing.

1615
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,733
Before you know it,

1616
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,867
there's no time left

1617
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,936
to do it right.

1618
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:42,805
We all wait too long.

1619
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,142
 I don't know if I have

1620
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,011
the time.

1621
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,946
 You have plenty of time.

1622
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:52,181
Plenty.

1623
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:55,752
Use it right and get some sleep.

1624
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,962
♪♪

1625
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,330
 He had this little cross

1626
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,132
on his satchel.

1627
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:10,933
I just stared at that cross

1628
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:12,368
for hours.

1629
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:15,004
I knew as long as I could see it

1630
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,373
I was still alive.

1631
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,025
It was time for my shot,

1632
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,428
and I hated to wake him.

1633
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,068
(door creaking)

1634
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,335
That's when we heard the men

1635
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:49,272
beating on the bus door.

1636
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:50,740
 Hey, hey!

1637
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,841
We're in here!

1638
01:01:51,841 --> 01:01:52,775
Let us out!

1639
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:53,976
All right.

1640
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,478
Hey, guys, come on in.

1641
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,779
Hey, come on, everybody,

1642
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:57,480
let's go.

1643
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,481
 Wake up.

1644
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,183
Wake up, they're coming for us.

1645
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,250
 Come on.

1646
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,286
 Wake up.

1647
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,755
Come on, come on,

1648
01:02:05,755 --> 01:02:06,489
you need your medicine.

1649
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:07,523
Let's get you your shot.

1650
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,003
Truth was he didn't have

1651
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:23,139
no more insulin in that box.

1652
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:29,445
He gave me the last...

1653
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:32,081
to save my life.

1654
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,919
The man died in the night.

1655
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,856
I didn't even know he was dead.

1656
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:41,090
(sniffling)

1657
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,127
That man who saved my life

1658
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:47,363
was left inside that bus,

1659
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:51,167
alone in the cold and dark.

1660
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,402
Those people who came within

1661
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:55,104
inches of dying themselves

1662
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,005
didn't want to ride with

1663
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,074
a dead person.

1664
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:02,211
We left him.

1665
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,080
All alone.

1666
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,085
The men had to come back later

1667
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,053
with a wagon and get him.

1668
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,422
 That's why you and Carl

1669
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:14,924
built the cross.

1670
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,832
 A few weeks later, I was

1671
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,367
getting ready to go on stage.

1672
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,002
 I'll be right there.

1673
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,203
They returned your stuff

1674
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:28,538
from that bus ride.

1675
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,207
 Oh, that's not mine--

1676
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,074
 We've got five minutes,

1677
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:33,075
everyone.

1678
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,313
(sniffling)

1679
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:34,036
 The blind man was my daddy.

1680
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:48,351
When I didn't see him in

1681
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:49,619
Nashville he got on the bus

1682
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,053
back to Conway.

1683
01:04:52,188 --> 01:04:53,489
 Why didn't you recognize him?

1684
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:54,390
I mean--

1685
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,491
 I hadn't seen him in over

1686
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,425
20 years and he looked

1687
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:57,526
so different.

1688
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:58,628
He had all that white hair

1689
01:04:58,628 --> 01:04:59,996
and a hat and I didn't know

1690
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:00,997
he had gone blind.

1691
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:02,031
He probably didn't even know

1692
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,366
I was on the bus 'til he

1693
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,434
heard my voice.

1694
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,536
 Maybe he thought you all

1695
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:08,638
would be rescued before

1696
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,940
he had to take his own shot.

1697
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,442
 No.

1698
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:16,212
He knew giving me his last dose

1699
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:17,346
could kill him.

1700
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,485
He just did it anyway.

1701
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:24,553
He gave his life for me

1702
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:27,356
and I refused to see him.

1703
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,626
I can't take back nothing

1704
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,195
I did in my life.

1705
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:35,331
I ain't got no family no more,

1706
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:37,400
but if I did,

1707
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,601
they'd come first.

who's gonna be there with you?

1714
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,076
Well, we had us a good time.

Thanks for coming with me.

1722
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,143
 She's not good, honey.

1723
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:55,745
Daddy just talked to Grandpa

1724
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:56,812
Luther on the phone,

1725
01:06:56,812 --> 01:06:58,581
and they're gonna operate

1726
01:06:58,581 --> 01:06:59,715

1732
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,392
but the Opry can wait.

1733
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:11,427
Grandma Teeden can't.

1734
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,162

1747

 Mm-hmm.

1751
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,820
 You and Dad were working...

1752
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:39,688

01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,243
all the lab results are back,

1896
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,345
but I'm real satisfied.

1897
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:52,781
 Can I see her?

1898
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:53,682
 No, they'll be bringing her

1899
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:56,184
up in a little while.

1900
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,886
Your grandma's one strong woman.

1901
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:59,855
She came through like a trooper.

1902
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,690
 I knew it.

1903
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,225
Thank you, God.

1904
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:04,860
 Where do we go from here?

1905
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,094
 Well, she is gonna need

1906
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,629
several weeks.

1907
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:09,197
I am gonna recommend some

1908
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,033
chemotherapy,

1909
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,601
just as a precaution.

1910
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,302
 I thought you said--

1911
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:14,202
 Well, we got everything

1912
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:15,737
we can see and feel,

1913
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:16,638
but there can always be

1914
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:18,073
microscopic cells we don't catch

1915
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,708
and we don't want this thing

1916
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,611
spreading, okay?

1917
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:24,012
 Grandma Teeden pitched a fit

1918
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,314
over that.

1919
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,949
 I ain't doing it.

1920
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:29,017
All my hair's gonna fall out.

1921
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,285
 You don't need any hair,

1922
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:31,153
woman.

1923
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:32,988
Besides I hear that baldness

1924
01:16:32,988 --> 01:16:35,090
improves your disposition.

1925
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,362
Look it here, darlin'.

1926
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:45,968
 They're beautiful.

1927
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:47,936
You can still stitch better than

1928
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:49,371
any old machine.

1929
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:54,276
 I hope you like yours, too.

1930
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:55,844
 Grandpa.

1931
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,084
It fits like a...

1932
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:03,719
 Glove.

1933
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:07,756
 How did you know the size

1934
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,157
of my hand?

1935
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,993
 From years of holding it,

1936
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:11,994
darling.

1937
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,975
 The next six months were

1938
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,176
the roughest yet.

1939
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,911
We were booked clear across

1940
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:31,179
the country.

1941
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,681
But we got our new bus,

1942
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:33,949
and Daddy designed it.

1943
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,684
And of course nobody could

1944
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:36,685
drive it but him.

1945
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,920
 The record company...

1946
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,390
(indistinct conversation)

1947
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,924
(cheers and applause)

1948
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:44,359
 The funny thing about dreams

1949
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,827
is that they really do come

1950
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,996
true, but in their own time.

1951
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:49,765
I was finally opening at

1952
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,166
the Grand Ole Opry.

1953
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:53,902
(cheering)

1954
01:18:19,828 --> 01:18:20,996
It was thrilling,

1955
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:22,464
but like most good things

1956
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,899
it was going by too fast.

1957
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:25,434
I just wanted to stop and

1958
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,035
take it all in.

1959
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,532
Faith was right.

1960
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,201
I did get there,

1961
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:00,535
but the question was

1962
01:19:00,535 --> 01:19:02,370
who was gonna be there with me?

1963
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,772
 LeAnn.

1964
01:19:03,772 --> 01:19:04,806
Just talked to the record

1965
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:05,507
company.

1966
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:06,508
They're throwing a big party

1967
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,043
after the show.

1968
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,111
They're gonna announce the

1969
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:10,078
release of the new record.

1970
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,246
They're very high on it.

1971
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,114
Think we're gonna get at least

1972
01:19:12,114 --> 01:19:13,048
three big singles...

1973
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:13,949
 Look at this place.

1974
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:14,816
So nervous I can barely breathe.

1975
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:15,884
 It'll be fine.

1976
01:19:15,884 --> 01:19:16,952
Take deep breaths.

1977
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,121

Thanks.

 Oh, Miss Rimes.

1992
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:00,362
I told you I'd get you these.

1993
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:01,530
 Oh, great! Thank you.

1994
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,397
 Can I get some more

1995
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,265
pictures tonight?

1996
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,000
 (mouthing) Yeah, sure.

1997
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,067
I couldn't wait to see

1998
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:07,169
the photographs that night with

1999
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,937
Faith Shawn and me.

2000
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,907
 What you got, honey?

2001
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:13,108
 Oh, I can't wait for you

2002
01:20:13,108 --> 01:20:14,009
to see these, you won't

2003
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:15,277
believe this.

2004
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,883
Where is she?

2005
01:20:21,883 --> 01:20:24,219
 Oh, they're lovely.

2006
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,256
 She's not in them.

2007
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:31,059
 Who?

2008
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,861
 When we were here last time,

2009
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,029
I didn't tell you about it

2010
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,964
because, well, I don't know,

2011
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:37,532
but, anyways, I couldn't wait

2012
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:38,433
to get these pictures so I could

2013
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:39,434
show you but--

2014
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:40,302
 Honey, what are you

2015
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:41,436
talking about?

2016
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,104
 Remember when Grandma Teeden

2017
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,206
got sick?

2018
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:45,407
Faith Shawn, I met her at the

2019
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,175
Opry, and we took pictures

2020
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,410
together and we spent a whole

2021
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:49,277
day together and she told me

2022
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,412
about this horrible bus accident

2023
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,346
and how her father saved her

2024
01:20:51,346 --> 01:20:53,481
life, and-- and...

2025
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:55,584
she's not here.

2026
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:59,020
 Honey, you must be mistaken.

2027
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:03,158
Faith Shawn died two years ago.

2028
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:10,632
 Daddy said most folks didn't

2029
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,200
even know she had died.

2030
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,235
(applause, distant)

2031
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,302
She spent her last years with

2032
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:15,637
some old boy she married helping

2033
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:18,106
the homeless in a mission.

2034
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:19,641
Someone sent Daddy a clipping

2035
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,109
from a Nashville paper because

2036
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:23,645
he had been such a big fan.

2037
01:21:23,645 --> 01:21:27,148
She died in an accident.

2038
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,117
 Do good, honey.

2039
01:21:29,117 --> 01:21:31,419
 It's your night, Lee.

2040
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:32,387

well, so many country performers

2058
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:37,419
have grown up singing in church.

2059
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:38,620
I did, too,

2060
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,456
