1265
01:43:14,962 --> 01:43:16,531
Not so bad yourself.

1266
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:21,634
I guess you found
Spec's body.

1267
01:43:21,636 --> 01:43:22,702
No.

1268
01:43:22,704 --> 01:43:25,771
It was just blood.
Lots of it.

1269
01:43:25,773 --> 01:43:26,974
He couldn't have survived it.

1270
01:43:28,943 --> 01:43:30,310
And Tino?

1271
01:43:31,546 --> 01:43:32,712
Bailed.

1272
01:43:32,714 --> 01:43:34,880
No goodbye, nothing.

1273
01:43:34,882 --> 01:43:36,383
[SCOFFS] Who knows
what he's up to.

[SOBBING]

1275
01:43:54,502 --> 01:43:55,503
Excuse me.

1276
01:44:05,947 --> 01:44:07,548
Permission to return this.

1277
01:44:09,917 --> 01:44:11,318
In honor
of your son, ma'am.

[SOBBING]

1279
01:44:21,394 --> 01:44:22,563
You were with him.

1280
01:44:25,099 --> 01:44:26,433
What was he like?

1281
01:44:29,804 --> 01:44:31,271
Best man
I've known, ma'am.

1282
01:44:34,509 --> 01:44:35,676
Best man I'll ever know.

1283
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:40,347
That's my son.

1284
01:45:21,055 --> 01:45:22,056
Hungry?

1285
01:45:26,127 --> 01:45:27,327
No.

1286
01:45:28,563 --> 01:45:29,664
No, I'm good.

1287
01:45:32,499 --> 01:45:33,634
The book you gave me...

1288
01:45:35,069 --> 01:45:38,904
The fox pin and the last
pages were burned in the fire.

1289
01:45:38,906 --> 01:45:40,741
Guess I'll never know
the ending.

1290
01:45:43,778 --> 01:45:45,445
We'll just have to
make our own, then.

1291
01:45:48,415 --> 01:45:49,482
Won't we?

1302
01:54:05,346 --> 01:54:08,146
When's the last time
you had chocolate?

1303
01:54:08,148 --> 01:54:10,117
When's the last time
we could afford it?
