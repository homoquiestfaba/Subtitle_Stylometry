1
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:33,352
I see it .

2
00:01:33,435 --> 00:01:35,564
Ok, I brought her something.

3
00:01:37,936 --> 00:01:39,160
Go away!

4
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:44,715
Leave.
Leave her alone.

5
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:49,394
Leave!

6
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,062
No, please.

7
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,733
Ven.

8
00:10:03,945 --> 00:10:05,188
Father.

9
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,237
In the Name of the Father...

10
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:46,527
... and the Son... 
and the Holy Spirit...

11
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:49,516
Amen.

12
00:10:56,113 --> 00:11:00,878
This is the blood of Christ,
which he gave for our sins.

13
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,421
Body of Christ.

14
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:14,118
Body of Christ.

15
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:40,199
Hi.

16
00:35:51,138 --> 00:35:57,098
At the end of the way,
there will be a light.

17
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:01,636
And the light is me.

18
00:39:35,143 --> 00:39:36,741
Here.

19
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,200
Give me the gun.

20
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,772
Give me the gun.

21
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:42,433
That's good.

22
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,469
Give me the gun.

23
00:48:00,152 --> 00:48:01,336
Get him out.

24
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:34,101
Here.

25
00:49:36,237 --> 00:49:39,463
The girl came to collect the
family's payment a few times now.

26
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:40,613
Mm hmm.

27
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:42,304
Normally the mother does that.

28
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,304
And the last time she
came, she looked bad.

29
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,645
I mean, really bad actually.

30
00:49:54,988 --> 00:49:58,711
The payments are only for the kids
and the mother. Where is the father?

31
00:49:59,023 --> 00:50:00,244
Right?

32
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:45,439
She's an investigator.

33
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:54,444
She believes something happened
to that girl, you know, on the farm.

34
00:57:00,494 --> 00:57:02,319
Investigator?

35
00:57:04,495 --> 00:57:07,745
You mean like the law?

36
00:57:17,912 --> 00:57:21,192
Is there something
I should know about?

37
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:24,294
How do I know?

38
00:58:11,038 --> 00:58:13,424
In the Name of the Father...

39
00:58:14,288 --> 00:58:18,008
...and the Son... 
and the Holy Spirit.

40
00:58:18,043 --> 00:58:19,764
Amen.

41
01:04:23,211 --> 01:04:24,598
Come on.

42
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:54,033
Corre.
I'll find you, okay?

43
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:57,838
Go hide.

44
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:04,421
Hide.

45
01:11:44,762 --> 01:11:46,619
Get out of the way.

46
01:11:55,452 --> 01:11:58,076
- What the fuck, don't worry!
- No!

47
01:20:31,271 --> 01:20:32,573
What?

48
01:20:33,212 --> 01:20:34,420
Relax.

49
01:21:53,063 --> 01:21:54,181
Get up.

50
01:21:58,604 --> 01:21:59,775
Get up.

51
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:45,314
Run!

52
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:37,569
It's okay.
