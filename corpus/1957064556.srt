2
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,592
Man: Ira, please, don't
get started on Brian.

3
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:56,594
How long have
we been playing
poker at his house?

4
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:57,900
I don't know. 2 years?

5
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:59,031
2 years.

6
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,250
In 2 years, how many
times did he tell US

7
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,469
we're on
his next show?

8
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:02,513
Well, he never actually
said that we were--

9
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:03,471
he has implied it

10
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,473
and hinted at it
many times.

11
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,692
Well, we don't know that
he's not gonna hire US.

12
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,999
Would Ernie, our agent,
be avoiding US

13
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:11,218
if Brian, our scumbag,

14
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:12,610
had shown any interest
in hiring US?

15
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,525
Maybe he doesn't want
to put anybody on his staff.

16
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,397
Maybe he's just gonna hand out
freelance assignments

17
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,485
don't be
so desperate.

18
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:20,401
Ira, we haven't
worked in 8 months...

19
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,229
And I have a wife.

20
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:25,928
All right, i--
don't say it.

21
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,886
Woman: Are you on your way
to your card game?

22
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,105
Man:
Yeah, what's up?

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,759
Brian's show
was picked up.

24
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,326
I want to finish
my book!

25
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,501
Do the show
for one season,

26
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,372
and you can finish
your book during hiatus.

27
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,288
Do you have anything left
from the advance?

28
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,463
No.

29
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:40,725
You're the only one
who knows about this.

30
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,857
Just let Brian know
that you're ready to work

31
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,164
and call me
in the morning.

32
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:57,438
Man: Have you ever worked
with Brian before?

33
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,830
No, I never worked with him.

34
00:02:58,874 --> 00:03:01,398
I know he was
a really big fan
of monkey's up.

35
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,226
Don't bring that up.

36
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,009
Why?

37
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:05,054
When you
bring up a show

38
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,925
that lasted 8 episodes
2 seasons ago

39
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:07,883
it's like
holding up a sign

40
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:10,364
that says,
"will write for food."

41
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,408
Gotcha.

42
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:12,496
Good.

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,063
Now get in there
and suck Brian's dick.

44
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:17,197
I am all over it.

45
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,551
No, no, Brian,

46
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,205
I'm not allowing you
to do this to me.

47
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,989
I thought I was ready
to come back.

48
00:03:27,032 --> 00:03:29,339
You are ready, man!
I got you 22 on the air!

49
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,473
They want a fuckin'
anthology show, man.

50
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:35,302
Every week
a new fuckin' deal.

51
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,433
22 times.

52
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:39,219
And I don't even know
what it's about.

53
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:46,269
More suspenseful
than eerie,

54
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,706
but a little eerie...

55
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,360
With an edge.

56
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,623
Everything's
got an edge.

57
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:54,973
And funny, but dark.

58
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,801
How dark depends on
whether we get

59
00:03:56,845 --> 00:03:58,629
Sunday at 7:00
or Thursday at 10:00.

60
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:01,371
And it's gotta have
this look.

61
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:02,459
Something about...

62
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:05,767
Digitals and pixels
and drop frames.

63
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,988
And we'll get those
chanting Bulgarian monks
to do the theme.

64
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,425
Monks with an edge.

65
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:12,643
Is that what
those idiots told you?

66
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:13,992
That's what
I told them.

67
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,518
Then what's the deal?!
What's the problem, Brian?

68
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,780
I sat on that couch,

69
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,261
and I tried to listen
to my own voice.

70
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,653
I was speaking
in tongues.

71
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:24,525
Who gives a shit what
you were speaking in, Brian?!

72
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,091
You got 22 shows on the air.

73
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:29,312
And I know Melinda.
Once a deal is made,
the rest is cake.

74
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,705
Cake?!

75
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:33,403
Cake?!

76
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,493
22 episodes is cake?!

77
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:39,322
Brian, you just gotta
get a taste for it, ok?

78
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,716
Listen, you're
a little rusty.

79
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,239
Come on, bri!
You're the man!

80
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,501
Remember when
you used to go out
in the desert for 3 days

81
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:45,981
and come back with
2 shooting scripts?

82
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,505
Yeah, but I didn't
come back with
the eightball of blow.

83
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:51,943
Well, if that's
the only problem.

84
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,427
Coke?

85
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,343
Are you out of
your fucking mind?!

86
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,519
Forget it! Forget it!
Bad idea! You're right!

87
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,435
All right.
Let's take this
one step at a time.

88
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,567
All they need by Friday

89
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,180
are story outlines
for the first 6 shows.

90
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,747
Nothing?

91
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,530
Nothing!

92
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:14,879
You've had 30 days, Brian!

93
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:16,098
Goddamn it,
don't do this to me!

94
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,360
You wanted to start
working again.

95
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,796
You said
the therapy was working--

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,755
you're fuckin' centered
or whatever kind of bullshit!

97
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,061
I know you, Brian!
You aren't gonna
like flying coach

98
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:24,628
and living in fucking
hacienda heights!

99
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:27,109
2 words for you, Brian:
Potato famine!

100
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,593
You're not gonna like
scouring on your fucking
friends' bathroom

101
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,899
looking for mushrooms to eat!
I know you, buddy!

102
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,640
When you stick
a darning needle up your ass,

103
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:40,296
you're, like,
at the Van nuys holiday inn!

104
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,517
You ok?

105
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:49,131
No. That's what i'm
trying to tell you.

106
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,883
I just can't do it.

107
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:06,801
Here's what you gotta do.

108
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,324
You gotta get
yourself cleaned up,

109
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,413
play your poker game,
and I'll call you
in the morning.

110
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:14,722
And if you still
don't want to do it,
I'll call Melinda.

111
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,336
Will you get the door?

112
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:31,173
Man: First day's bets.

113
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,088
Yeah, I'm in.

114
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,307
I call.

115
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,483
I feel lucky.

116
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,441
That's right.
Here they come.

117
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,573
King to the 3...

118
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,619
10, ace...
Queen for the actor...

119
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,142
Jack. Looking low.

120
00:06:44,186 --> 00:06:46,144
Looking very low.

121
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,885
Ace, 10.

122
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,018
5.
I'm in it.

123
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,759
Chasing.

124
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,543
I call.
I'm out.

125
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:59,984
You're--you're
folding an ace, too?

126
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:02,160
Brian always
beats me low.

127
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,075
You had him beat
on the table, dummy.

128
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,076
I had a queen underneath.

129
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,514
Well, thanks
a fucking lot, Benny.

130
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:08,558
Jesus Christ, Benny,

131
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,951
they're dealt facedown
for a reason.

132
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,996
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,476
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,480
How about a choco-ccino?

135
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:20,222
I don't think so.
It always makes me
phlegmy.

136
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,571
Ira: Is everything
all right?

137
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:23,486
He never offered me
a choco-ccino.

138
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,923
Can we get a new game
going here?

139
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,229
Yeah, let's go.

140
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,056
Thanks, Benny.

141
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,100
I'm gonna deal again.

142
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,580
It's like a do-over.

143
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,495
This time from
the top of the deck.

144
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,497
Well, you can't ask
for everything.

145
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,152
You in, Benny?

146
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:38,501
Deal me in.
I'm in. I'm in.

147
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,807
All right,
let's ante up, boys.

148
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,504
Ira: Are we gonna play
the whole game this time?

149
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,507
Get your head
in the game
this time, Benny.

150
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,465
For Christ's sake.

151
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,031
Benny: Take it easy.

152
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,643
We're not in high school
anymore. Let's go.

153
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:51,514
Turn yours over,
will ya?

154
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:56,432
10 over here.
We got a 3 and a 5.

155
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,695
Brian wins again.

156
00:07:58,739 --> 00:07:59,783
Neal: Got me again.

157
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,219
Brian's too good
tonight.

158
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,351
Benny:
It's the bank of Brian.

159
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:03,526
What have you
lost, 500?

160
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,614
You are hot.Benny: You're
unbelievable.

161
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,660
Brian, i--
you're killing me.

162
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,531
You are fucking
killing me.

163
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:09,445
Choco-ccino?

164
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,881
May I have
my balls back?

165
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,753
I'm a loser,
you're a winner.

166
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,842
That's a nice shirt, Brian.
Where did you get it?

167
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,626
All right. I give.
I give. I surrender.

168
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,627
I'm italying here.

169
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:18,454
I'm giving up.
I got bupkis.

170
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,890
Bupkis.
It's yours.

171
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,326
Have you lost
weight?

172
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,069
Brian, you are hotter
than honeymoon dick.

173
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:25,766
Cigar?

174
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,245
No, have one of mine.

175
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,160
You want me
to get the door?

176
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:31,336
No, I'll get it.

177
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,034
Deal me out
this hand.

178
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:33,948
Benny: Hank's deal.

179
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,516
Hank:
Just hang on a second.

180
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,048
Benny,

181
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,180
I think you've got
something on your nose here.

182
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:50,617
What?

183
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,619
I'd assume it was something
Brian ate 2 or 3 days ago.

184
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:55,099
Hey, I noticed
you dumping hands
to him, too.

185
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,448
What the fuck
is going on?

186
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:57,841
Yeah. Are you guys
looking for jobs
or something?

187
00:08:57,885 --> 00:08:59,539
Yeah. What's
with you, Hank?

188
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:00,670
I didn't know
you were such
a kiss-ass?

189
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,585
I'm not, I got
shit cards,
all right?

190
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:05,457
Wait a minute.
Is Brian going back to work?

191
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,329
Typical fucking actor.
Me. Me. Me.

192
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:09,592
Why don't you suck my ass,
writer boy?

193
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,028
Hey!not you, ira.

194
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,552
Somebody write
that up for you?
Somebody script that?

195
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,901
No, no. No one has
to write that up for me.

196
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,598
No, I'm a professional
fuckin' actor.

197
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:16,512
I can improvise.

198
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,513
You're
improvising?
Yes!

199
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,819
That explains
my boredom.

200
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,951
Will you assholes
knock it the hell off?

201
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,605
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

202
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,435
I get one night a week
to relax and have
a little camaraderie.

203
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,375
Man: Hey, you!

204
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:57,509
Hey, you!
Up there!

205
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,514
Yes, you!

206
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:20,358
Down here!

207
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,538
Yeah, you!

208
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,678
Champagne,

209
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:39,464
you have
betrayed me!

210
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,512
Aah!

211
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,171
Come here,
shithead!

212
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,477
Second man:
Fuck you!

213
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,487
Stay.

214
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,797
Woman: Help me
get rid of him.

215
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,194
Ouch!

216
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,862
Bet to the half.

217
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,038
Hundred bucks.

218
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:50,710
Brian,
you all right?

219
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,324
Hey, you!

220
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:59,719
I thought I heard
the Marlboro man
talking to me,

221
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:01,764
but it was over
at the hotel.

222
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:06,290
A woman and a man
are standing on
the balcony.

223
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,901
The lights
in the tower

224
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:10,207
flash 4 times
at perfect intervals

225
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:12,688
like
Paul fuckin' revere.

226
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:17,258
I hear a woman scream
up in the tower.

227
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,739
The man on the balcony
points up and says--

228
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,698
"champagne,
you have betrayed me!"

229
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,873
Betrayed me?

230
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,440
Did you say,
"champagne"?

231
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:26,571
Is anyone gonna bet?

232
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,921
The man reappears

233
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:29,923
at the other end
of the hotel
on the fire escape.

234
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:30,924
The woman says to him,

235
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,316
"stay and help me
get rid of him."

236
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,972
The guy kisses her
and takes off
down the escape.

237
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,234
Are you sure this
was the same guy

238
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,497
and the same woman
as the ones on
the balcony?

239
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,369
What do you mean?

240
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:42,631
How well
could you see them?

241
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,501
Hello?!

242
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:46,287
Do something.

243
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:52,859
Bet or fold!

244
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:53,860
Hundred bucks.

245
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:56,688
Hundred bucks
to ira.

246
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,388
I'm out.

247
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:02,346
Neal: I'm in.

248
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,394
Come here. Come here.

249
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:09,005
Come here.

250
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,442
What?

251
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:12,313
It's a test.

252
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:13,531
What are you
talking about?

253
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:14,968
Brian...

254
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,360
He wants to see
which one of US
can break the story.

255
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:17,535
He's playing with US.

256
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:18,754
Just like,

257
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,755
James coburn did
in the last of Sheila.

258
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:20,843
For Christ's sake--

259
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,453
I'm telling you...

260
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:23,759
Hank and Neal are going
to cut our throats
if we cock around.

261
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,327
Now we can
do this if you'll
just get into it.

262
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,241
Stop winning.

263
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,546
Ok, maybe--maybe
it's, just

264
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,026
your run-of-the-mill
sex-for-hire thing,
right?

265
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,680
Hooker's
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

266
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:34,291
She witnesses
a political
assassination.

267
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,251
Wasn't that
your equalizerepisode?

268
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,296
You know, maybe
the hooker's in on this
with the guy in the tower.

269
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,822
A variation of the panel game
or the badger racket.

270
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,389
Maybe you ought to stick
to selling enema bags.

271
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,390
Medical supplies.

272
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,392
Why does she have
to be a hooker?

273
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,872
I don't know, Benny,

274
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,483
maybe her parents
didn't love her enough.

275
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,397
Seriously,

276
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,398
did it ever occur
to you guys

277
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,399
that
a good-looking woman

278
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:56,357
in a hotel room

279
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,446
could be anything
but a hooker?

280
00:13:58,489 --> 00:13:59,664
All: No.

281
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,492
Ok, Benny,
she's not a hooker.
Who is she?

282
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,929
Somebody's wife.

283
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,887
That
is exciting.

284
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,497
All right...
Cold opening:

285
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,064
A Jewel thief comes
into a hotel room, right?

286
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:10,588
And, there's
a husband and wife in bed.
They're asleep.

287
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,764
The wife looks up.
She sees the thief.

288
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,157
Instead of waking up
her husband,

289
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,506
she takes the Jewel thief
out on to the fire escape

290
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,117
and says,
"we can get rid of him."

291
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,554
"Him" being the husband
who's asleep in the bed.

292
00:14:19,597 --> 00:14:21,861
Then how does that
explain the balcony?

293
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:22,905
Or the tower?

294
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:23,863
How much of this
are you married to?

295
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,865
That's it.
I'm going to bell.

296
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,127
This is fucking bullshit.

297
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,433
You know, I get one night
a week to play poker

298
00:14:29,477 --> 00:14:30,347
and have a little
camaraderie,

299
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:32,393
and you assholes
fuck it up.

300
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,394
Are you coming?

301
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:35,178
Yeah, sure. Why not?

302
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,485
Hey, why don't we
go to the bike and play
with the Vietnamese?

303
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,574
It's a good idea.
I don't understand
they say either,

304
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,619
but at least they
fucking play poker.

305
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,100
Thank you for
a lovely evening, gentlemen.

306
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:45,014
Goddamn writers.

307
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:48,365
Benny:
Who put a nickel in him?

308
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:52,804
Benny: Brian's right.

309
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:56,025
Who uses the line
"champagne, you have
betrayed me"?

310
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,331
Either an older man

311
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,636
or an academic
or an intellectual,

312
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,508
not some guy
running around
the chateau marmont

313
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,031
killing and/or robbing,

314
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,119
kissing some babe,

315
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:05,339
and then fleeing down
the fire escape.

316
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,210
Or...

317
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,038
Or what?

318
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,258
Or...

319
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,608
What other kind
of guy

320
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:18,482
uses the word
"betrayed"?

321
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:19,962
A foreigner.

322
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:22,530
A foreigner.

323
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:26,360
I gotta take a leak.

324
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:32,061
Who told you?

325
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:34,542
Our agent's assistant.
Who told you?

326
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:35,978
Your agent.

327
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,024
Yeah, he's been
trying to sign me.

328
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,634
I thought
you should know.

329
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,157
Thank you.

330
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,985
Anybody know what
the show's about?

331
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,161
It's an anthology.
You think he's all right?

332
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:47,947
What the fuck you mean
he's been trying to sign you?

333
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,513
Hey, don't
get mad at me.

334
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,167
How do you like it
over there anyway?

335
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,995
It's great.
Sign with him.

336
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,476
Seriously, you think
Brian's all right?

337
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,564
In what way?

338
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,783
Well, if we weren't
in show business,

339
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:02,352
this sort of obsessional
self-absorption

340
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,050
would be aberrational.

341
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,181
What's your point?

342
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,879
My point is we all know

343
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:10,404
what happened to Brian
2 seasons ago.

344
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:12,101
You've never been
tense at deadline?

345
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:16,279
Yes, but they never had
to send me home with
a psychiatric nurse.

346
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,368
Everybody works
differently.

347
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,458
You think he really saw
what he says he saw?

348
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:22,155
Sure.

349
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:23,547
I don't know,
maybe.

350
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,288
Well, the normal
first reaction

351
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,550
to possible
seeing a murder

352
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:29,205
is not to break it down
into 4 acts.

353
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,294
I think he's
fuckin' with US.

354
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:34,384
Either way, it's
a little psychotic,
don't you think?

355
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:37,431
Well, maybe
we should all
just go home,

356
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,041
take our meetings
with Brian
separately,

357
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,434
and let the chips
fall where they may.

358
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,044
Works for me.
I'm exhausted.

359
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,480
Agreed.
We all go home

360
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,395
and let Brian pull
himself together.

361
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,875
It's settled
then.

362
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:49,921
Anybody wanna
go get a drink?

363
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:52,968
Hank: What about this:
A crystal-meth lab

364
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,057
run by a couple
of disgruntled pharmacists.

365
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,538
Neal: Yeah.
The kids love the whole
pharmacist genre

366
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,540
blow me, Neal,
and I mean that sincerely.

367
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,498
At least about the guy
on the fire escape.

368
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,934
If you don't like
the Jewel thief, fine.

369
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:04,936
You know,
that was just an area.

370
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:10,072
Would you come on?

371
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:11,073
They're spitballing
down there.

372
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,466
I'll tell you
one thing right now,

373
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:13,684
I'm not walking back up.

374
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:17,253
I'm not getting a heart attack
for this guy.

375
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,040
Now what?

376
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:24,043
We have to talk.

377
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,625
Because we're not
practically in.

378
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,323
He's just hard up
for an idea.

379
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:44,063
God.

380
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,107
Benny, he's pumping US,

381
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,891
trying to get US
to work for nothing.

382
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,416
Ira, we've been working
for nothing for 8 months
in your living room.

383
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,548
Yeah, but in my living room,
I don't have to elbow out

384
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:52,941
a couple of desperate hacks
for the privilege.

385
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:55,683
Ira, we're a couple
of desperate hacks!

386
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,337
Even for you
that's pathetic.

387
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,687
You want to know what
would be a lot less pathetic?

388
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:00,514
A job!

389
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:01,515
Look, I've gotta have this.

390
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,473
I got a wife,
I'm leasing to buy,

391
00:18:03,517 --> 00:18:07,477
and I'm going after this,
with you or without you.

392
00:18:07,956 --> 00:18:09,131
What did you just say?

393
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,306
I said if you don't
want this,

394
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,786
I'm going after it
by myself

395
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,092
what are you
talking about?

396
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,311
Nobody even knows
if you can write by yourself.

397
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,271
I got a spec.

398
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,273
What spec?

399
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,665
I did a sample
murder, she wrote.

400
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:23,014
I finished it
last week.

401
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:24,407
You scumbag.

402
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,887
Look,
it's something that
I did in my spare time.

403
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:26,801
You scumbag liar!

404
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:28,107
You weren't even
talking to me!

405
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,108
What was
I supposed to do?

406
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:30,370
Don't try
and justify this!

407
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:31,458
Ok, ok, ok, ok. Listen,

408
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,502
I'm sorry about
what I said.

409
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,156
I don't want to do this
without you.

410
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,202
Then what the hell
are you doing writing
a spec behind my back?

411
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:37,333
And murder, she wrote?

412
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,118
Jesus chr--

413
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,163
isn't that off the air?

414
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,165
They're doing 3
2-hour reunion specials.

415
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:43,992
This is her idea, yes?

416
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,689
She was supportive,
yeah.

417
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,952
Yeah, as in "I can't
blow a man who doesn't
stand up for himself."

418
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:51,565
That's not why
she doesn't blow me!

419
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:52,696
Where are you going?

420
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,567
To get a job!

421
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,611
Now you're
cooking with gas!

422
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:56,135
But it's
every man for himself,

423
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,223
which means,
you're out.

424
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,791
Murder, she wrote.
Unbelievable!

425
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,491
All right, let me ask
you guys something.

426
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:05,318
Theoretically--

427
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,841
evening,
Mr. Pettiford.

428
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,364
Haven't seen you
in a while.

429
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:11,106
Diet coke,
heavy on
the maraschinos?

430
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,110
Remy. Water back.

431
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:16,416
A labbat-ice for me.

432
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:17,504
'Cardi, rocks.

433
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:18,374
Brian: Where's Benny?

434
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:19,854
He vomited
and went home.

435
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:23,727
In that case,
I'll have a vodka
and Sauerkraut juice.

436
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:24,685
Jimmy...

437
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:25,686
Yes, Mr. P.?

438
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:28,993
The west-facing suite,
fifth floor.

439
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:30,343
Do you know who's in there?

440
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,997
No, I don't.

441
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:35,174
Find out for me,
would you?

442
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,393
I--i really
can't do that.

443
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:41,267
I--i kind of
have to respect
the guests' privacy.

444
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,574
I'm sorry,
Mr. Pettiford.

445
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:48,709
I'll, just
go get those drinks.

446
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:52,974
Putz.

447
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,194
I mean...

448
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,813
Man:
Hey, Philippe...

449
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,431
Something else.
Something...

450
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:16,737
Big...

451
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,522
Underneath all of this.

452
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,962
Now what are the blinking
fucking lights in the tower?

453
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:28,052
And I don't want
any TV bullshit.

454
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:32,622
Perpetual novelty.

455
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,408
Perpetual novelty.

456
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,800
It's one of
the basic ideas

457
00:20:36,844 --> 00:20:38,367
in forming
complexity theory.

458
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,847
I've been reading
this book.

459
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,284
They're these
physicists, biologists,
and economists

460
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:45,156
working up in some
think tank in Santa fe.

461
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,506
They've been
trying to come up

462
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,379
with models for studying
complex adaptive systems.

463
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,382
You understand? We're
trying to take a situation

464
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,166
that was happening,

465
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,038
that was unfolding
in the moment,

466
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,301
and we're trying
to find a point
of equilibrium

467
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,825
from which we can
find order in it.

468
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:03,131
Well, these guys
up in Santa fe

469
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:06,439
go on the idea that in
complex adaptive systems,

470
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,745
order is highly dispersed.

471
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,660
There is no single
vantage point from which

472
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:14,838
one can discern
the coherence
of the behavior.

473
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:15,926
In other words,

474
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,320
there is no master
neuron in the brain,

475
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:21,323
no master cell in
the developing embryo,

476
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,586
so what appears to be
order in a system,

477
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,373
is merely the outcome
of cooperation
and competition

478
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,071
among the agents
in that system.

479
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:33,466
Who--who put on
the discovery channel?

480
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:43,563
Anybody here
know French?

481
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:44,477
Brian: Why?

482
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,608
I'm outside, ok?

483
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,088
I'm by the fire escape,

484
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,872
and there are
these 2 very suspicious
French guys, ok?

485
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,180
And one of them
says to the other, just...

486
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,486
Bear with me, it's...

487
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:08,065
"He must still have
the desired pastry
with him."

488
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:16,030
Excuse me.
Mr. P.

489
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,346
You guys
keep working,

490
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,436
I have to go
to the phone.

491
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:33,264
Hank: Wait! Brian,
are you all right?

492
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,528
Brian?

493
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,312
Neal:
Nice fucking
work, Benny.

494
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,574
Yeah, what'd you do?

495
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,271
Find a French-English
dictionary in the John?

496
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:41,882
You said every man
for himself.

497
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:42,883
What's the matter
with you?

498
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,101
We've gotta get
this guy grounded.

499
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,407
Is that what
we're gonna do, Hank?

500
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,583
Look, maybe Brian
saw something,
maybe he didn't,

501
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:50,499
but he's becoming
completely delusional.

502
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:51,544
I think we got
to get him home,

503
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:54,285
and--and--and
call his shrink.

504
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,330
Neal: You're right.

505
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,462
I mean, if Brian
cracks up again,

506
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,029
there might not be
any jobs for any of US.

507
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:02,511
I'll get right to the point.

508
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,643
I want your story.

509
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,340
Gee, you work fast.

510
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,211
What makes you think
I've got a story?

511
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,430
Everybody's got a story,

512
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,084
it's just that
not everybody can tell it.

513
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:11,781
How do you know
I can tell it?

514
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:12,782
I'll tell it.

515
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,088
Doesn't sound like
much fun for me.

516
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,742
There'll be some money
in it for you.

517
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,308
How do you know
who I am?

518
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:20,137
I live just up the hill
from here.

519
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:25,447
My bedroom window
looks straight across
at the upstairs terrace.

520
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:27,014
And?

521
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,235
I saw what went on
up there tonight.

522
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,459
Am I confused or just
out of my league?

523
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,113
Benny: His shrink
was applefield.

524
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,419
Hank: We've gotta call
Dr. Applefield.

525
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,813
Guys, guys, guys, guys. Guys!

526
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:45,206
Steven Spielberg
up at the--

527
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:47,077
Steven Spielberg's
up at the desk.

528
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,514
My god,
that's Spielberg.

529
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,733
Ira: That's not
Steven Spielberg.

530
00:23:50,777 --> 00:23:51,604
Shut up. It is.

531
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:52,779
I'm telling
you it is.

532
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:55,042
My cousin Gary look
more like Spielberg--

533
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:56,478
anything I say
is not--

534
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:59,481
I know Spielberg.
He goes to my temple.

535
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:00,743
Whatever.
Whatever.

536
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:03,833
The waiter did tell you
what I do, didn't he?

537
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:04,878
No.

538
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,488
No wonder you're
being so cagey.

539
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:10,536
You must have thought
I was a blackmailer
or something awful.

540
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,626
I write and produce
television shows.

541
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,324
No kidding.

542
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:19,849
I saw what went on
up there tonight.

543
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:22,417
It started to give me
an idea for a show.

544
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:27,553
You know,
I think maybe--

545
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,385
you think maybe what?

546
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,215
Can we talk about this
someplace else?

547
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,478
Where?

548
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,131
There's a bar
across the street
that I like.

549
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,482
I'm a little old
for that place.

550
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,352
Please.

551
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,049
Can we just get
out of here?

552
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:47,224
Let me get my coat.

553
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,052
It's not Spielberg.

554
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:51,620
I'm telling you
it is.

555
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,404
No, it's not Spielberg.

556
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,449
Are you happy?

557
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,059
Are you shocked
it's not Spielberg?

558
00:24:56,103 --> 00:24:58,366
Hank: Looks like
Ron silver.

559
00:24:58,409 --> 00:24:59,410
Looks like Ron silver?

560
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:01,325
You're wrong
about that, too.

561
00:25:01,369 --> 00:25:03,414
Where the hell's Brian?

562
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,590
Should I go
look for him?

563
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:05,678
Why? So you can tell
him that the Latvians

564
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,375
are playing dominoes
in the men's room?

565
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:08,768
I'll go find him.

566
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,422
I'll go with you.

567
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:41,931
Hi, Connie.

568
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:44,151
Good evening, Mr. P.

569
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:51,593
We could go
up to my place.

570
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:52,942
Ira: Would you two
knock it off?

571
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,291
Neal: Where the fuck
did he go?

572
00:25:54,335 --> 00:25:55,379
Maybe we ought to
just go home

573
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:56,555
and call him
in the morning.

574
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:57,991
Hank: The way
he's been behaving?

575
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,862
With his history?
Listen, he's got
a bagful of pills,

576
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,865
and I happen to know
there's a gun
in the house.

577
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:04,084
A gun
in the house?

578
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:06,521
We went shooting
at the range
together once.

579
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,001
When did you go
shooting at the range?

580
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,350
We're going up there.

581
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:10,438
No, really, when did you
go shooting at the range?

582
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:12,179
I want to know.Enough with the range.

583
00:26:12,222 --> 00:26:16,836
Maybe we just better
go across the street.

584
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,641
So...

585
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:40,511
So...

586
00:26:40,555 --> 00:26:41,948
So, what went on
up there?

587
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:45,081
Can we get a drink
first?

588
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,130
Stoli, rocks.

589
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,914
Aquavit.

590
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,568
Daddy.

591
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,617
Tracy?

592
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,097
No. Carla.

593
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:08,104
I'll have
an aquavit.

594
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,456
She seemed relieved.

595
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,676
Let's start
at the beginning.

596
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,287
What were the lights
in the tower?

597
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:18,549
Well, you're
the expert,

598
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,421
but it seems to me
that that part
of the story

599
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:23,685
won't make any sense
unless you start
at the beginning.

600
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,165
Where at the beginning?

601
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:26,514
Well, don't you
usually start off

602
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,516
with the main character?
Who she is.

603
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,999
All right, I'll pretend
I'm Eugene O'Neill
for a second.

604
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:34,348
Where are you from?

605
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:35,654
New Jersey.

606
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,048
Great. What were
the lights in the tower?

607
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:42,138
Brian. Brian!

608
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,924
Maybe we should
call the police.

609
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,360
Before we do that,

610
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,711
has anyone checked
to see if the front
door's locked?

611
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:56,587
Neal...you're
the most athletic.

612
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,722
I'll check upstairs.

613
00:28:00,766 --> 00:28:03,507
I'll come with you.

614
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:05,205
I'll check
the pool.

615
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,122
Hank: You up here, Brian?Neal: Brian?

616
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:13,169
Hey, Brian?

617
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:20,916
I would've sworn he
turned this thing on
when we left.

618
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:46,637
Benny, what did you do?

619
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:48,639
Neal: What the fuck?!

620
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:49,640
Well, what kind
of schmuck burglar's

621
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:52,861
gonna stand here
and wave his arms?

622
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,735
Neal: Come on, Benny,
move it, move it. Hurry.

623
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,216
Shit!

624
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,870
Man!

625
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,398
This is really great.

626
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:11,271
Shh. I love this song.

627
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:23,457
Let's talk.

628
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,987
Ok, shoot.

629
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:34,250
Aren't you
forgetting something?

630
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:35,251
What?

631
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:36,339
Are you the only one
who gets to be

632
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:38,037
all business
around here?

633
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,430
Yeah, well,
how 'bout this?

634
00:29:40,474 --> 00:29:42,302
If I use
what you tell me

635
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,478
as an "a" story
in an episode,

636
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,045
I'll give you
500 bucks.

637
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:49,962
And how much
will you get paid
for the story?

638
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,920
Well, it's kind
of complicated.

639
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,226
I have
an overall deal,

640
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,880
and things
like story payments

641
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,359
get charged
against it.

642
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,493
So how much will get
charged against it

643
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:00,711
for my story?

644
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,888
After all,
it is my story.

645
00:30:02,931 --> 00:30:03,932
It happened to me.

646
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:07,675
It was a very
upsetting experience.

647
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:10,634
Are you all right?

648
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,516
Somebody's
a little tense.

649
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,648
I don't know
which one to take.

650
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:27,651
What exactly
are your symptoms?

651
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,610
Disorientation,
headache,

652
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:30,567
obsessive thinking.

653
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,788
Do you feel panicked?

654
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,530
Strangely, no.

655
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:41,404
This one
will knock you out.

656
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:45,104
This one you have to take
every day for 3 weeks

657
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:48,803
before you get
any results.

658
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:51,458
This one--
this one's a hypnotic.

659
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:54,591
Possible side effects,
happy happy, joy joy.

660
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:58,073
I highly recommend it.

661
00:30:58,726 --> 00:30:59,640
A woman
with a secret...

662
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:03,426
And a pharmacology
degree.

663
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:06,255
Well, one needs to stay up
on these things,

664
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:07,387
doesn't one?

665
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,476
Or, in this case,
one needs these things

666
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,478
to stay up.

667
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,481
Aren't you gonna
write that down?

668
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:18,137
Only a real hack
writes down his own
bon mots.

669
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,924
Other side effects include
short-term memory loss.

670
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:34,936
This is nice.

671
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,243
And you are?

672
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,549
Her partner.

673
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:43,423
Ex-partner.

674
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:46,513
What have you given him?

675
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:49,342
Nothing.

676
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,343
Don't worry,
I'm not a cop

677
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,911
or a reporter
or anything.

678
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,347
I know who you are.

679
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,697
Well, maybe you and I
can talk later.

680
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,395
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to her.

681
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,441
Later.

682
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,051
Now.

683
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,404
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

684
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,319
Get over here.

685
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,931
Get your hands
off me, ok?!

686
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:15,281
Just relax.Tough guy.

687
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:18,371
Tryin' to show off
in front of him?

688
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:20,025
I'm not gonna show off
in front of him.

689
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,504
What do you mean by that?

690
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:24,333
You're suppose
to play nice in front
of strangers, ok?

691
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,856
You just calm down.

692
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,380
I'm the one goin'--

693
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,424
you mean all over town?

694
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:30,296
I thought I made it
perfectly clear.

695
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,427
I am through with you.

696
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,125
What do you mean
you're through with me?

697
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:34,343
Maybe you're through
with me, you're not
through with the stuff,

698
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:35,562
and that's what
I'm here to protect.

699
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:36,519
Take a look
in the mirror.

700
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:37,912
You're a loser,
and I don't want

701
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,609
to have anything
to do with you.

702
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,176
What do you mean
I'm a loser?!

703
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,917
What are you saying?!
You're calling me
a fucking loser?!

704
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,224
I'll tell you what.
You wanna go with him...

705
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:49,054
I'm not going with him.
We're just talking.

706
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:51,099
You get your hands
off me!

707
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:52,100
Don't manhandle--

708
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:55,408
Fuck!
Ok, I don't give a fuck.

709
00:32:55,451 --> 00:32:56,452
You wanna go
with him?

710
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:57,758
Just don't take
any of my shit.

711
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,325
You're hurting me.
Let go.

712
00:32:59,368 --> 00:33:01,109
Excuse me.

713
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:03,329
Family business.
Step off.

714
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:04,852
Before we
do anything,

715
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:09,248
I want you to know
that I am represented
by Burt fields.

716
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:12,251
Have you already
slept with him?

717
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,340
So what?!

718
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:19,171
Think they accept
credit cards?

719
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:20,563
Desk sergeant said
that they do.

720
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,522
Come on, guys, please.
Hang around with me,
please?

721
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:23,697
What do you think's
gonna happen?

722
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,915
You're right next door
to a police station.

723
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:27,309
I know, but ira's car
is parked up at Brian's.

724
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,615
How we gonna get back?

725
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:31,096
Benny, the desk sergeant
will call a cab for you

726
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,532
when they're ready
to let ira go.

727
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:33,968
Come on,
guys, please.

728
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,361
Please just stay
and wait.

729
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,623
Listen, we're tired.

730
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,407
We need to go find out
what happened to Brian.

731
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,582
Yeah. Besides,
you're the one

732
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:41,106
that opened your mouth
to the security guy.

733
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,804
I know, I know.
But he's gonna
be so pissed

734
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:44,761
when he gets out.

735
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:48,983
You guys probably
need to talk.

736
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:52,987
Well,
ditched those two.

737
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,815
We gave 'em our statements.
They'll be fine.

738
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,817
You know, Hank,
sometimes you scare me.

739
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,036
Pardon?

740
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,820
Yeah, you know,
all your Kumbaya
horse shit

741
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:01,561
about "is Brian
gonna be ok?"

742
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:03,389
But when it comes
to ira,

743
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:05,956
who can't do
anything for you--

744
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,436
I didn't notice you
stickin' around.

745
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,438
Yeah, well, I never
pretended to be
ira's pal, did I?

746
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:10,657
How old are you?

747
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,833
29.yeah? I'm 44.

748
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,226
Yeah? Really?

749
00:34:14,269 --> 00:34:15,879
Is that when
they give out the
hypocrites licenses?

750
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,794
On the day you turn 37,

751
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:19,013
all of a sudden
you realize

752
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,147
that other people
are not what's important.

753
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,365
Really?

754
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,498
You learn to put your faith
in institutions.

755
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:26,760
It's the opposite
of everything

756
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:27,935
that the culture
teaches you.

757
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:31,112
It's not the wife,
it's the marriage.

758
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:34,376
It's not the player,
it's the team.

759
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,725
There are certain
institutions

760
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:38,467
that must be preserved,
even if they are damaged.

761
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,383
And what institution
does Brian represent?

762
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,385
Syndication.

763
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:46,780
So you're not a hippie.
You're Harry lime.

764
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:50,392
That's another great thing
about turning 37.

765
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:51,959
You stop being
indignant.

766
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:54,831
I'm not indignant.
I am in awe.

767
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:58,444
Go, my son,
and sin no more.

768
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,185
Let's get outta here.

769
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,970
Cops give me
the creeps.

770
00:35:28,387 --> 00:35:29,562
Did he kick me?

771
00:35:29,605 --> 00:35:33,479
You hit the planter
when you fell backwards.

772
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,483
There was a woman
with me.

773
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:40,573
Yeah. She said
you wouldn't want
to call the cops.

774
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:41,574
Where'd she go?

775
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:43,967
She hustled sugar ray
out of here.

776
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,100
Did she say
for me to wait?

777
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,885
What do I look like,
a kiosk?

778
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,229
Get in.

779
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:51,252
Why the hell did you
have to tell him

780
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:52,514
that you slept with me?

781
00:36:52,558 --> 00:36:56,562
I told you, I thought
it would get rid of him.

782
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,402
Want a drink?

783
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:12,447
Got any vodka?

784
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:13,970
Stoli?

785
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,451
Fine.

786
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,241
Cozy.

787
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:26,940
You know, I think
I figured out

788
00:37:26,983 --> 00:37:29,421
what I want
for my story.

789
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:31,510
Ok, how much?

790
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:32,554
I want credit.

791
00:37:33,816 --> 00:37:36,384
Look, in order
to get your name
on something

792
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:39,735
you'd have to
actually write it...

793
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:44,305
And you'd have
to actually havea name.

794
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:49,745
You can have
anything else.

795
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:07,720
Boy, I'd hate
to see you
with a crab leg.

796
00:38:28,436 --> 00:38:32,527
Run silent, run deep.

797
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,664
They'll go away.

798
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,376
What if it's
your friends?

799
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,771
What if it's
your partner?

800
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,383
Let me see that.

801
00:39:08,868 --> 00:39:11,523
The safety's on.

802
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:09,450
Whoa! Unh!

803
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:10,233
Danny!

804
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:11,234
Jesus Christ, man,

805
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,714
I think you broke
my fuckin' ass!

806
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:14,368
What the hell
were you doin'?

807
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,674
I was worried about you.

808
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:16,849
Don't you ever
open the door?

809
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,503
How'd you know
I was here?

810
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:21,331
I saw some shadows
in the bedroom upstairs.

811
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,377
You got a woman
up there?

812
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,555
Get that fucking gun
away!

813
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,078
Guns are dangerous.

814
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:30,428
Listen, I got an idea.

815
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:31,733
How 'bout
I call the network up

816
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,343
and give them
some outrageous
bullshit story?

817
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:36,477
Then I think I could
buy you another week.

818
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,783
That's not an idea,
Danny.

819
00:40:37,826 --> 00:40:40,394
When you have
the outrageous
bullshit story,

820
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,743
then you'll have
an idea.

821
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:43,353
Look...

822
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:46,705
Don't say anything
to the network
just yet.

823
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,446
Well, I have to
tell 'em something.

824
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:49,272
Or else you do.

825
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:52,450
I'll figure out something.

826
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,321
I believe in you,
man.

827
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:57,585
And I believe
you believe in me.

828
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:10,206
Yeah, Courtney,
I want you to get
a couple numbers for me.

829
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,514
I know exactly
what time it is,
all right?!

830
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:17,823
Ok, I want you to get me
Dr. Jerry applefield.

831
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,520
Get his service.

832
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:22,523
Quit yawning.
Quit yawning.

833
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,007
What the hell's
goin' on, guys?

834
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,183
How come you aren't
playin' poker?

835
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,619
Ira's in jail.

836
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:32,794
What?

837
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:34,840
He punched out
one of those
security guys.

838
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:36,363
How the hell'd
that happen?

839
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:39,801
Well, he thought
the guy called Benny
a Jew boy.

840
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:40,672
Well, fuck him.

841
00:41:40,715 --> 00:41:42,021
What's goin' on
with Brian?

842
00:41:42,064 --> 00:41:42,935
Who's he up there with?

843
00:41:42,978 --> 00:41:46,242
Beats the shit
out of US.

844
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:50,769
Hey, who represents
you guys?

845
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,614
Knock it off,
will ya?

846
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:12,312
I'm sorry.

847
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,536
You're making it
very hard for me

848
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,060
to pretend
I'm not here.

849
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:25,020
I'm not
a sex junkie.

850
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:27,545
Congratulations.

851
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,373
Nobody wants me
for me, you know?

852
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:34,726
Everybody wants me
'cause I got this
freak dong.

853
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,597
What?!

854
00:42:36,641 --> 00:42:37,598
You know,
I suppose I'm weak

855
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:38,947
'cause I go along
with it, right?

856
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:43,125
But you know,
I got to meet
all kinds of people

857
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,040
I never would've
met otherwise,
you know?

858
00:42:45,084 --> 00:42:49,305
Interesting people.
And it took me places,
you know?

859
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:52,134
Now look where
it's taken me.

860
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:56,574
It's like having
an albatross hanging
between your legs!

861
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:57,618
Tell me something, man,

862
00:42:57,662 --> 00:42:59,402
what's it like
to have a penis

863
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:00,447
that you can't sit on?

864
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:02,057
Look, I don't know
why, exactly,

865
00:43:02,101 --> 00:43:04,843
but I'm not
comfortable
discussing this.

866
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:07,019
You think
I'm comfortable?

867
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:11,458
Come on, I got
a medium-sized
forest creature

868
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:12,502
in my pants!

869
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,548
Hey! I don't wanna
hear another word

870
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,072
about your dick!
Ok?!

871
00:43:17,116 --> 00:43:18,857
Ok. All right.

872
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,162
Lymon's girlfriend--

873
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:24,471
this unbelievable-looking
black chick named,

874
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:25,428
champagne--

875
00:43:25,472 --> 00:43:27,126
ok, well, somebody
must've told--

876
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:28,780
you know, 'cause
she wanted to take me

877
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,520
up in the tower
of the hotel

878
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,566
to, show me
the view, right?

879
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,525
Well, next thing
you know--unh!

880
00:43:35,569 --> 00:43:36,526
If only we hadn't
been leaning

881
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:38,267
up against
the light switch--

882
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:41,183
champagne, champagne--
what hotel was this?

883
00:43:41,227 --> 00:43:43,664
Look, I've done
2 pornos, ok?

884
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,362
They said I was just
another 13-inch cock.

885
00:43:46,406 --> 00:43:48,451
Now I'm selling
plumbing fixtures.

886
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:49,627
What hotel?

887
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,324
The chateau,
up on the strip.

888
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:52,586
The one with the tower.

889
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,284
You were in the tower
tonight shtupping?

890
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:56,503
Making love.

891
00:43:56,546 --> 00:43:57,939
And you were
bumping the lights
on and off?

892
00:43:57,983 --> 00:43:59,767
We were supposed
to go to lymon's room

893
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:01,551
to play pictionary,
right?

894
00:44:01,595 --> 00:44:03,162
But you gotta
bring lubrication.

895
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:08,515
Look, let me
give you a tip
about storytelling.

896
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:10,343
Start
at the beginning.

897
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:11,736
The real question is

898
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,521
will the network let US
run the show?

899
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:17,524
You two?

900
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:20,440
Frankly, no way.

901
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:22,355
And none of that's
gonna matter because
if the network

902
00:44:22,398 --> 00:44:23,878
doesn't have
something to see
by Friday,

903
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,793
there is not
gonna be a show.

904
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,622
But I guarantee
you guys this--

905
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,668
if I can get
another one
of my clients

906
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,060
to configure
his deal

907
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,497
and take the job
that Brian's doing
right now over,

908
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,282
then you two will
be on the show

909
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,632
at no less than
supervising
producers.

910
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:43,115
So, basically,
we shoot Brian
in the nuts.

911
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:45,857
I love Brian.
Do you love Brian?

912
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,641
We love Brian.
We're not gonna
shoot him

913
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,468
in the nuts.

914
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,425
Don't you care
about Brian?

915
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,775
Hang on a second.
Wait a minute.

916
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:51,689
I love Brian, too.

917
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:53,038
He's just like
a brother to me.

918
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:55,344
Yeah, well, he's
sick. He's sick,
you understand?

919
00:44:55,388 --> 00:44:56,519
Yeah.

920
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:57,520
Danny...
Yes?

921
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,480
Could you excuse US
for a second?

922
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:01,524
Yeah.

923
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:02,351
If you don't mind,
we just want to--

924
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,613
you want me
to-.

925
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:06,007
Appreciate it.

926
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:25,723
Hank, this is no time
to take the high
moral ground.

927
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,072
Let me ask you
something.

928
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:30,205
If Danny were
to hand US a couple
of staff jobs,

929
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:33,905
don't you think
he'd want US
as clients?

930
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:35,950
You think
he's gonna fuck US?

931
00:45:35,994 --> 00:45:37,125
We'll know
he's for real

932
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:39,345
if he wants
to sign US.

933
00:45:57,363 --> 00:46:00,801
Well, I need to know
what you guys
are gonna do.

934
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:02,150
And there's
one more thing,

935
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:04,805
and if it's a problem,
we'll shake hands

936
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,155
and go our separate ways.

937
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,330
If you guys
take the jobs,

938
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:11,856
I expect to be
your agent.

939
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,343
What'd I tell you?

940
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:24,912
I know. I know.
I know.

941
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:28,350
Look, I know
you're still pissed.

942
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:30,483
This isn't like you.

943
00:46:30,526 --> 00:46:31,701
Say something.

944
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,007
The guy in the cell
with me

945
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:36,402
had a 13-inch shvontz.

946
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:37,533
My god.

947
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:39,318
No, you idiot.

948
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:40,536
He was the guy
in the tower

949
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,321
at the chateau marmont
tonight.

950
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:43,365
No.
Yes.

951
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,019
This is
unbelievable.

952
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,238
UN-fucking-believable.

953
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:47,979
My god.
So, what happened?

954
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:49,371
Ok, you ready
for this?

955
00:46:49,415 --> 00:46:51,112
Big boy leaves
his girlfriend
on the balcony

956
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:52,853
with this fag
englishman,

957
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:56,161
takes the fag englishman's
black Amazon girlfriend
up to the tower

958
00:46:56,204 --> 00:46:58,119
to show off
the artillery piece.

959
00:46:58,163 --> 00:46:59,381
Hold on. Hold on.

960
00:46:59,425 --> 00:47:01,166
The englishman is gay,
but he has a girlfriend?

961
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:02,776
A shemale, you know?
Transsexual?

962
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,173
And get this...
Its name is champagne.

963
00:47:08,216 --> 00:47:09,609
Champagne?
Champagne.

964
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,479
God.

965
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:11,829
So he's pushin'
and pushin',

966
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:13,308
and they're leanin'
up against the light
switch.

967
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:15,789
Pretty soon
the fag englishman
shows up,

968
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,138
goes bat-shit nuts.

969
00:47:17,182 --> 00:47:20,054
"Champagne, you have
betrayed me!"

970
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:22,709
My god.
My god!

971
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,842
I hope this is
a 10:00 show.

972
00:47:24,885 --> 00:47:27,235
Brian:
That's your story?

973
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:28,628
Woman:
That's my story.

974
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:32,980
Sounds like another
bad TV episode.

975
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:38,377
You're just
being too much
of a perfectionist.

976
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,335
With all due respect,
you don't know
what the fuck

977
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:41,336
you're talking about.

978
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,470
You don't understand
the process.

979
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:46,907
Really?

980
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,431
Where you goin'?

981
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:53,174
Look, you asked me
what happened.

982
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:53,914
I told you.

983
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,220
If you
don't like it,

984
00:47:55,263 --> 00:47:57,526
there's nothing
I can do about it.

985
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,398
But I want you
to stay.

986
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:02,618
And you'll behave?

987
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:05,404
Ok.

988
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,410
Ok, maybe I'm not
a writer,

989
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:12,759
but it seems to me
the problem is

990
00:48:12,802 --> 00:48:15,414
that you're missing
the main character.

991
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:16,676
What main character?

992
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,808
The main character
isn't somebody
over there.

993
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:21,072
It's somebody here
who saw something

994
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:21,986
and can't
figure it out

995
00:48:22,029 --> 00:48:24,423
and it's
driving him crazy.

996
00:48:24,466 --> 00:48:28,470
Television is no place
for literary self-portrait.

997
00:48:28,514 --> 00:48:30,211
Bullshit.

998
00:48:30,255 --> 00:48:33,214
Do you ever actually
watch television?

999
00:48:33,258 --> 00:48:34,999
Do you?

1000
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:37,131
Sometimes.

1001
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,263
Fuck television.

1002
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:40,961
What would
Hitchcock do?

1003
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,971
You're my muse.

1004
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,366
Obviously, there's
no TV show in this,

1005
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:56,281
but it gives US a huge
strategic advantage

1006
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,283
over those 2 shitheads.

1007
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:01,982
All right, we gotta
come up with a story
for Brian.

1008
00:49:02,026 --> 00:49:03,070
He still needs a story.

1009
00:49:03,114 --> 00:49:04,376
We'll have his
undivided attention,

1010
00:49:04,419 --> 00:49:06,682
but we gotta come up
with a story.

1011
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,471
Before we start...

1012
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:14,560
We gotta talk
about our problem.

1013
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:17,780
It's been in the room
staring at US every day,

1014
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:20,958
like a--like a goiter.

1015
00:49:22,611 --> 00:49:26,093
All right... you wanna
talk about this?

1016
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,312
Fine.

1017
00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:30,010
What you did sucked.

1018
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:33,448
We were partners
for 8 years.

1019
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:35,494
You chose
to fuck that up.

1020
00:49:35,537 --> 00:49:37,583
So even if we do
work together,

1021
00:49:37,626 --> 00:49:38,671
let's face it,

1022
00:49:38,714 --> 00:49:41,282
it's not gonna be
like it was before.

1023
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,110
I'm sorry that
you feel this way,

1024
00:49:43,154 --> 00:49:46,418
but it's normal
for a grown man
to be married.

1025
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:47,593
What?

1026
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,073
Not everybody wants
to spend Thanksgiving

1027
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:50,726
at the track.

1028
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,859
Is that what you think
this is about?

1029
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:55,122
Well, don't make this
about the murder,
she wrote,

1030
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,820
because you didn't
know about that
until tonight.

1031
00:49:57,864 --> 00:49:58,952
You've been
pickin' on me

1032
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,476
ever since I got home
from my honeymoon.

1033
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,392
Admit it.
You hate my wife.

1034
00:50:04,436 --> 00:50:05,741
Reality check,
Benny.

1035
00:50:05,785 --> 00:50:07,830
Everybody hates your wife.

1036
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:11,530
You really don't know
that I know, do you?

1037
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,053
Know what?

1038
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:14,315
At your bachelor party--

1039
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,578
a party that I somewhat
helped to organize--

1040
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:18,058
while everyone's
up front with the girls,

1041
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:21,018
you're in the back room
with that cocksucker
fingerman

1042
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:22,236
stabbing me in the back.

1043
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,977
Fantasy baseball?

1044
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,761
Fingerman
was the only one

1045
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:27,459
who had a chance
to overtake me.

1046
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:28,938
He needed
one more big stick,

1047
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:30,375
you made sure
he got griffey.

1048
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:34,683
You're talking about
a fucking rotisserie
league, ira.

1049
00:50:35,293 --> 00:50:37,425
No. You're wrong.

1050
00:50:37,469 --> 00:50:43,257
Look, there's
one thing in life
that I'm good at.

1051
00:50:43,301 --> 00:50:47,348
For 4 straight years
I dominated that league.

1052
00:50:47,392 --> 00:50:49,655
That bothered you,
didn't it?

1053
00:50:49,698 --> 00:50:53,528
Bothered you enough
to try and ruin it
for me.

1054
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:57,445
You're right.

1055
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:00,709
I shouldn't have
done it, but...

1056
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:05,410
Ira, i--
I gotta tell ya...

1057
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:07,412
When things aren't
going your way,

1058
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:10,067
you're kind
of an asshole.

1059
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:15,115
And when things
aregoing your way,

1060
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:18,075
you're
a huge asshole.

1061
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,561
It's amadeus.
What?

1062
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:29,042
The guy in the cell,
me, it's amadeus.

1063
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:33,090
A gifted man destroyed
by threatened, jealous
mediocrity--

1064
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:34,308
that's what Brian saw.

1065
00:51:34,352 --> 00:51:35,875
That's the theme
of the story!

1066
00:51:35,918 --> 00:51:37,181
What about the guy
with the schlong?

1067
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:40,401
...we'll make him
some kind of oddball genius

1068
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:42,751
like...like rain man,
only not retarded.

1069
00:51:42,795 --> 00:51:45,972
No. Not a genius.
Telekinetic.

1070
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,713
The guy is
telekinetic.

1071
00:51:47,756 --> 00:51:49,541
But it's something
that's passed down

1072
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:51,543
genetically,
like schizophrenia.

1073
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:52,631
I don't think
schizophrenia

1074
00:51:52,674 --> 00:51:54,111
can be passed down
genetically.

1075
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:57,375
No, no, no, no. The power,
it's passed down
genetically,

1076
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:58,419
but it skips generations.

1077
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:00,508
It's--it's--it's
this recessive gene

1078
00:52:00,552 --> 00:52:04,512
that--that's only found
in this one family.

1079
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:05,992
Right, right, ok, ok.

1080
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,036
We're at
this family reunion--

1081
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,822
no, like, it's
at a christening,

1082
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,040
or a bris
with a baby--

1083
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:13,521
a new baby
comes into this
old-line family

1084
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:15,088
in San Francisco.Pittsburgh.

1085
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,350
No, no, no.
San Francisco,

1086
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,309
and there this big
house on Nob Hill

1087
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:21,660
and a matriarch--
a respected,
powerful--

1088
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:23,314
stanwyck in
the big valley.

1089
00:52:23,357 --> 00:52:26,360
I'm telling ya,
this is too good
for Brian.

1090
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:29,102
Where's the fuckin' cab?

1091
00:52:32,888 --> 00:52:35,587
I rode on one once.

1092
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:39,721
Brian: What if
the guy watching
is a priest?

1093
00:52:39,765 --> 00:52:43,247
Yeah...Yeah.
That's good.

1094
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,163
The priest doesn't
report it right
away,

1095
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,513
'cause he's not sure
what he's seeing.

1096
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:49,470
Yeah.

1097
00:52:49,514 --> 00:52:50,776
If he says anything
to the cops,

1098
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,387
he'll just sound
like the voyeur
he really is.

1099
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:57,522
The guy who commits
the murder
he confesses

1100
00:52:57,565 --> 00:53:01,352
To a priest.

1101
00:53:01,395 --> 00:53:02,266
What?

1102
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:04,746
Isn't that a kind
of a reach?

1103
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:06,400
That he happens
to confess

1104
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:09,316
to the only witness
to the crime?

1105
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:14,408
Not if--

1106
00:53:14,452 --> 00:53:15,757
Not if the priest

1107
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:19,500
is the only witness
that he confesses
to the guy

1108
00:53:19,544 --> 00:53:21,067
to shut him up.

1109
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,678
Jesus!

1110
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:26,812
Christ! You're
incredible!

1111
00:53:26,855 --> 00:53:28,205
Neal: Thank you.

1112
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:31,469
Thanks. You know,
that's my BMW out there.

1113
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:34,472
Did you--
did you see that?

1114
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:38,476
All right, ok...

1115
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:40,652
All right, second season
of outer limits,right?

1116
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:42,262
There's the one
with the giant ants,

1117
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:44,612
and they all have faces
like Mario cuomo.

1118
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:46,092
You know,
I'm not married
to this notion,

1119
00:53:46,135 --> 00:53:51,271
but what about
something that's not
based on a TV show?

1120
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,665
All right, fine.

1121
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,852
Twilight zone.

1122
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:08,462
Devil episode.

1123
00:54:08,506 --> 00:54:09,420
All right, it's a dark,
rainy night,

1124
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:10,725
the guy pulls
into a monastery,

1125
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:12,292
the monks, they've got
this guy prisoner, right?

1126
00:54:12,336 --> 00:54:14,903
And he turns out--
he's the devil,

1127
00:54:14,947 --> 00:54:16,122
but the guy lets
the prisoner go,

1128
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:17,384
and he's gotta spend
the rest of his life

1129
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:18,429
trying to
recapture the devil.

1130
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:19,865
If we're going to
rip something off,

1131
00:54:19,908 --> 00:54:22,259
let's at least
rip off a feature,
for Christ's sakes.

1132
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,304
Fine. Fine. Even better.

1133
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:27,351
...maybe
something French?

1134
00:54:27,394 --> 00:54:30,354
What do you suppose
we'll get for
supervising producer?

1135
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:31,877
What do you think
that is?

1136
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,705
15k a show.

1137
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:35,402
Really? Times 20.

1138
00:54:35,446 --> 00:54:37,448
You gotta figure
we'll do at least
3 scripts each.

1139
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:39,319
That's like another
70k right there.

1140
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,452
What about
this devil idea?

1141
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,150
D-D-Do you know
where the offices are?

1142
00:54:44,193 --> 00:54:45,499
I--i--i heard they might
be in the same building
as spelling,

1143
00:54:45,543 --> 00:54:47,719
which'd be good
because that means
we could have lunch

1144
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:49,155
at Marie callender's.

1145
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:52,289
What? It's the good one.
The one on Wilshire.

1146
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:54,334
Will you try to focus?

1147
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:57,511
All right,
all right, um...

1148
00:54:57,555 --> 00:55:01,428
Ok, the last detail,
but in space.

1149
00:55:01,472 --> 00:55:03,343
Danny said
no straight Sci-Fi.

1150
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:06,825
All right, the last detail
in the wasteland.

1151
00:55:06,868 --> 00:55:10,611
The last detail
meets mad Max?

1152
00:55:12,047 --> 00:55:14,963
Depressing.
Sucks.

1153
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:16,530
How are you gonna
dump your agent?

1154
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:20,360
I think I'll just
have my lawyer fax her.

1155
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,231
That is brutal.

1156
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:23,102
Yeah, I know.

1157
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:24,451
Ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1158
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:26,410
You're good.
You're good.

1159
00:55:26,453 --> 00:55:28,542
I--i got stuff
to learn.

1160
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:29,456
Ha ha ha.

1161
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,675
Can we have
some coffee here?

1162
00:55:30,718 --> 00:55:33,025
Woman: And then...

1163
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:34,592
And then...

1164
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:36,507
And then
they change places.

1165
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,293
What?

1166
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,034
Who's changed places?

1167
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:43,949
The killer
and the priest.

1168
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:46,778
They're doppelgangers.

1169
00:55:46,821 --> 00:55:49,650
And at the end,

1170
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:51,957
the priest
is in his bedroom.

1171
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,351
He's back
at the rectory,

1172
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:55,961
sitting in a chair...

1173
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:58,180
Looking out
the w-window...

1174
00:55:58,224 --> 00:56:00,487
Only it's not
the priest.

1175
00:56:00,531 --> 00:56:04,186
It's the killer wearing
the priest's vestments.

1176
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,536
He--

1177
00:56:10,105 --> 00:56:11,411
What did
you stop for?

1178
00:56:11,455 --> 00:56:14,153
We were doing
so good this time.

1179
00:56:14,196 --> 00:56:16,460
We were doing good,
weren't we?

1180
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,418
We were doing great.
Great story.

1181
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,551
So...get back
down there.

1182
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:23,031
Well,
that's one story.

1183
00:56:24,076 --> 00:56:25,120
I'll be a dead man

1184
00:56:25,164 --> 00:56:27,296
if I have to go
through this 22 times.

1185
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,646
Well, thanks a lot.

1186
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:31,431
I--i didn't mean it
like that.

1187
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:33,825
You're fantastic, but...

1188
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:37,394
Let's face it.
We're involved because
it's filling a need.

1189
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,353
I need to be overstimulated
to be creative.

1190
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,095
That's always been
my problem.

1191
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:45,184
I just can't take it
anymore.

1192
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:47,012
It's just US,
and it's good.

1193
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:51,451
This time.
But you're only one story.

1194
00:56:51,495 --> 00:56:54,411
By episode 6, we'll do
a story about dope dealers

1195
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:56,456
or satanists, and I'll be
discovered down an alley

1196
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,893
with a needle in my arm
or fucking a goat.

1197
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:01,983
I'm never gonna make it.

1198
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:03,942
Ok, ok.

1199
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,510
Well, look, I think
we've done enough
for one night.

1200
00:57:06,553 --> 00:57:09,991
Look, you take an
ativan, get a good
night's sleep,

1201
00:57:10,035 --> 00:57:12,298
and when you wake up
in the morning,

1202
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:13,604
you'll
write our story,

1203
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:17,303
and everything's
gonna look
a whole lot sunnier.

1204
00:57:21,481 --> 00:57:23,918
Benny: The old lady
pushes into the room
with her Walker, ok?

1205
00:57:23,962 --> 00:57:27,226
And the whole family
parts, so that she
can view the kid.

1206
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:29,271
All right, all right.
When she leans over the kid,

1207
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:30,490
we'll ping-pong closeups.

1208
00:57:30,534 --> 00:57:32,884
The old lady sees something
in the kid's eyes.

1209
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,800
Ok, all right,
and she turns
to the family

1210
00:57:35,843 --> 00:57:37,018
and she asks them
to part

1211
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:38,324
so that she can,
you know,
have some room,

1212
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:42,241
and she reaches in,
and she pulls out
a...

1213
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:43,285
Marble.

1214
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:44,156
A tooth.

1215
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,462
Shark's tooth.

1216
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:47,028
A bear's tooth.

1217
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,943
Both: A wolf's tooth.

1218
00:57:48,987 --> 00:57:50,989
Ok, she puts the tooth
down in the crib,

1219
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:53,861
and wham! It goes flying
into the kid's hand.

1220
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:55,254
The kid has the power.

1221
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:59,388
The kid has the
power, the old lady
has the power.

1222
00:57:59,432 --> 00:58:01,390
Jeez.

1223
00:58:04,742 --> 00:58:05,830
You know they'll
try to make US

1224
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:08,702
share an assistant,
don't you?

1225
00:58:08,746 --> 00:58:09,660
Fuck that noise.

1226
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:11,792
We'll each get
our own assistant.

1227
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:19,887
About this devil idea...
What if...

1228
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,715
We...

1229
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,501
You know, I could get
car insurance now.

1230
00:58:24,544 --> 00:58:25,414
I could...

1231
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,242
How 'bout this...

1232
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:28,722
We're out
in the desert.

1233
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:29,941
wasteland.

1234
00:58:29,984 --> 00:58:32,421
Will you forget about
the wasteland already?

1235
00:58:32,465 --> 00:58:34,902
We're in a desert.

1236
00:58:37,775 --> 00:58:42,475
No. We open up
on a black screen.

1237
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:46,610
Scratch that.
We're in the desert.

1238
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:49,787
Death valley.
Nothing moves.

1239
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:56,054
A couple of vultures
work on some bare bones.

1240
00:58:56,097 --> 00:58:58,970
Suddenly,
Vultures look up.

1241
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:01,538
Something is in the air.

1242
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:04,453
A gopher sticks
its head out of its hole.

1243
00:59:04,497 --> 00:59:07,413
A few feet away,
a crack develops

1244
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:09,067
in the hard-baked surface.

1245
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:14,551
Something is pushing
at the ground
from underneath

1246
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:18,293
like a chick trying
to get out of its shell.

1247
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:19,164
Ok.

1248
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:20,339
The vultures take off,

1249
00:59:20,382 --> 00:59:21,340
and the golfer--

1250
00:59:21,383 --> 00:59:23,429
"golfer"?
What--why is--

1251
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:25,344
why is there
a golfer?
Gopher.

1252
00:59:25,387 --> 00:59:27,346
Gopher.
Gopher.

1253
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:30,784
Jumps out of its hole
and runs away.

1254
00:59:30,828 --> 00:59:35,136
The ground cracks open
just enough

1255
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,357
for an incredibly
grotesque...

1256
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,274
Gnarled, inhuman hand
to push through.

1257
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:43,971
As the sunlight
hits the hand,

1258
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:51,500
it suddenly ungnarls
and morphs into a normal
man's hand.

1259
00:59:51,544 --> 00:59:53,372
No, that's expensive.

1260
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:56,244
No, no, no. I know this guy
just open up a digital house
over on seward.

1261
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:58,333
They can do it all
on a fuckin' macintosh.

1262
00:59:58,377 --> 00:59:59,552
All right, fine, ok,
go ahead.

1263
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,600
After--after the hand,
this little Yoda head,

1264
01:00:03,643 --> 01:00:05,819
and then the rest
of the body comes out,

1265
01:00:05,863 --> 01:00:09,083
and this thing
morphs into--

1266
01:00:09,127 --> 01:00:10,345
Harry Hamlin.

1267
01:00:10,389 --> 01:00:12,913
Harry Hamlin.
Fine.

1268
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:14,175
So then Harry...

1269
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:15,350
Hamlin...

1270
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:18,658
Stands up, stretches,
takes a deep breath,

1271
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,313
turns around, and sees...

1272
01:00:21,356 --> 01:00:23,141
The Las Vegas strip
behind him.

1273
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:25,143
He's the devil.He's the devil.

1274
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:26,927
He's just escaped
from hell.-

1275
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:28,929
There's the whole
flip-flop on the
twilight zoneshow.

1276
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:30,496
I get it,
no, I get it.
I get it!

1277
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:32,803
Of course!
"Escape
from hell."

1278
01:00:32,846 --> 01:00:33,891
That's
our story.

1279
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,762
That is our
fuckin' story!

1280
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:36,676
What'd you do?

1281
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,504
Cool that, man.
Cut that out.

1282
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,984
Turn it off.

1283
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:41,349
Cut to: A pagoda
in the highlands of
east fucking Timor.

1284
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:43,351
American guy,
early 30s.

1285
01:01:43,395 --> 01:01:47,181
Lives with the monks.
Vow of silence,
just prays,

1286
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:49,923
eats rice balls
and chicken fat sandwiches.

1287
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:51,490
There's a phone call.

1288
01:01:51,533 --> 01:01:52,970
He goes over,
he reaches down--

1289
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,667
hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

1290
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,321
If the monks have
taken a vow of
silence,

1291
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,366
why do they have
a telephone?

1292
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,761
A carrier pigeon
flies up his ass, ok?

1293
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:04,155
He gets a message
from his grandmother

1294
01:02:04,198 --> 01:02:05,460
in Pittsburgh.

1295
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:07,854
She tells him
that another one
with the power,

1296
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:10,422
another one like them,
has been born.

1297
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:12,946
Brother.

1298
01:02:14,165 --> 01:02:15,601
Excuse me?

1299
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:24,479
I don't believe
I got your credits.

1300
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:25,829
You have credits?

1301
01:02:25,872 --> 01:02:30,659
Between US, we have 19
produced television credits.

1302
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,314
Well,
that explains it.

1303
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:34,446
That explains what?

1304
01:02:34,489 --> 01:02:37,144
That explains
television.

1305
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,669
I suppose you don't
watch television.

1306
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:41,845
No, I don't.
I prefer movies.

1307
01:02:41,888 --> 01:02:43,498
Yeah, well, you're
ridin' the fuckin' bus.

1308
01:02:43,542 --> 01:02:45,196
Woman: What are you doing,
driving it?

1309
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:46,414
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1310
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:47,807
That's a good one, Lynn!

1311
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:49,243
Driver: Ha ha ha!

1312
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:51,985
We're gonna go
get my car.

1313
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:53,682
All right.

1314
01:02:53,726 --> 01:02:56,163
See, 'cause I thought
Dennis hopper maybe
put you guys on board

1315
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,948
and then when one of you
gets an idea,

1316
01:02:57,991 --> 01:02:59,297
the bus explodes.

1317
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:01,212
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1318
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:03,388
What's wrong
with the idea?

1319
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:06,391
Seriously?

1320
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:08,219
Seriously.

1321
01:03:08,262 --> 01:03:11,875
Well, first of all,
all right,

1322
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:14,399
you do have this
nice little story

1323
01:03:14,442 --> 01:03:15,922
about this
dysfunctional family, fine,

1324
01:03:15,966 --> 01:03:20,622
but then why tart it up
with this--this
telekinesis thing?

1325
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,147
Go with
what is essential.

1326
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,497
The outsider
within the family, see.

1327
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,760
You know,
find the antagonist

1328
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,981
within that situation.
Then...

1329
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:36,334
The old woman.

1330
01:03:36,377 --> 01:03:37,770
It's the old woman.
The old woman--

1331
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,773
she abused the hero,
and that's why
he's so fucked up,

1332
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,340
and now this baby is born,

1333
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,472
and he knows that
she is going to do

1334
01:03:44,516 --> 01:03:45,517
the same thing to him,

1335
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,346
and that is why
he has to come back.

1336
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,000
Well, there you go.

1337
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:53,830
Can I ask you what
you do for a living?

1338
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:56,484
Um, well, I happen to be

1339
01:03:56,528 --> 01:04:00,967
one of the highest-paid
script readers in the business.

1340
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:04,928
I can cover 5 of these
in one night.

1341
01:04:06,146 --> 01:04:08,366
I'm an insomniac.

1342
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,542
So some poor schmuck
is sitting home

1343
01:04:10,585 --> 01:04:13,806
thinking that he's one yes
away from selling a script,

1344
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:16,287
and it's your job to blow
him out of the water.

1345
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:18,419
You know what?
I should get combat pay

1346
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:22,467
for wading
through this crap.
That's what it is.

1347
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,904
Hey, hey, hey!

1348
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:26,036
Ira, take it easy!

1349
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:27,646
It's all right, Claude,
it's all right.

1350
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:31,476
Look, if I don't do it,
somebody else will.

1351
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:32,390
Nazi.

1352
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:34,044
Good.
Good for you.

1353
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,306
Sunset boulevard.

1354
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:37,482
Where the hell
are we?

1355
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:38,396
Excuse me.

1356
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:39,527
Where are we?

1357
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:41,181
Sunset
boulevard.

1358
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,054
It's Guatemala.

1359
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:45,098
It's echo park.

1360
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:46,926
Do you go back
the other way?

1361
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,275
Eventually.

1362
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,103
What the hell
does that mean?

1363
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:51,322
I mean,
I go downtown,

1364
01:04:51,365 --> 01:04:52,889
I go to union
station,

1365
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:54,107
seventh
and alvarado,

1366
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:55,804
and then I come
back sunset
the other way.

1367
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:57,676
And how long till you
get up to the strip?

1368
01:04:57,719 --> 01:05:00,374
'Bout an hour
and a half.

1369
01:05:02,855 --> 01:05:05,553
Could you freshen
these up for US,
please?

1370
01:05:05,597 --> 01:05:08,208
Yeah. Thanks very much.

1371
01:05:13,474 --> 01:05:15,563
He can't be
the devil.

1372
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,305
Right.

1373
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,741
Why?

1374
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:21,918
Well, why would
the devil have to
escape from hell?

1375
01:05:21,961 --> 01:05:23,180
If you're escaping
from hell,

1376
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:25,356
you're escaping
from the devil.

1377
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,140
Ok, well, it's not
the devil, all right?

1378
01:05:27,184 --> 01:05:31,623
He's just a guy, right.
He was a rogue, you know?

1379
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:35,279
In a previous life,
he was a bad guy,
a criminal.

1380
01:05:35,322 --> 01:05:36,976
An escape artist.

1381
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:38,499
Yeah! No, that'd be great.

1382
01:05:38,543 --> 01:05:40,762
He's like the world's
greatest escape artist.

1383
01:05:40,806 --> 01:05:41,633
That's it!

1384
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:43,548
I--you know?
During his life,

1385
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:44,810
no jail could hold him.

1386
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:45,985
Or during his death.

1387
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:47,639
You see there?

1388
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:49,075
No, that's great.
That's good.

1389
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:49,989
Yeah, here we go.

1390
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:52,513
Here we go.
There it is, yeah.

1391
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,995
What?

1392
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:01,305
Wasn't Hudson hawk
the world's greatest
escape artist?

1393
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:02,915
Fuck.
Shit!

1394
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,961
Fuck.
Shit!

1395
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:06,614
Fuck! No!

1396
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:12,316
No, Hudson hawk
was the world's
greatest cat burglar.

1397
01:06:12,359 --> 01:06:13,708
Well, that's not
the same thing.

1398
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:16,363
No, that's different.

1399
01:06:18,626 --> 01:06:19,584
That was close.

1400
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:21,325
I know, but we
got it back, though.

1401
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:23,631
Gotta pee.

1402
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:25,416
I'll keep workin'.

1403
01:06:58,362 --> 01:06:59,015
Yeah?

1404
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:00,494
Hey, Danny, it's Neal.

1405
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:01,756
How's it going, Neal?

1406
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,063
It's going pretty
good, I think, you know?

1407
01:07:04,107 --> 01:07:05,499
What do you mean
you think?

1408
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:07,980
Well, you know,
we've got a...

1409
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,896
We have a story,
you know.
It's just...

1410
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:13,290
Spit it out, Neal.
It's been a rough night.

1411
01:07:13,333 --> 01:07:14,943
Well, I think Hank
is great.

1412
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:16,336
You know that.
I think he's
terrific.

1413
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,688
You know, he's got
a lot of great
ideas, um...

1414
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:21,994
And I think we can
really work well

1415
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:23,256
together
on the show.

1416
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,605
Danny: Neal.

1417
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:25,998
All right, look,
I'm just a little
uncomfortable

1418
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,739
with US both being
supervising
producers, you know?

1419
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:29,784
It's sort of--
it starts to look
like we're--

1420
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:31,482
you know,
like partners.

1421
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:33,049
What's wrong
with being partners, Neal?

1422
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:34,354
Maybe it'll do you both
some good.

1423
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:36,182
Well, i--i just,
you know,

1424
01:07:36,226 --> 01:07:37,488
I've always liked
to work alone,

1425
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:38,445
and you know
what they say

1426
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:39,838
about writing
partnerships.

1427
01:07:39,881 --> 01:07:41,405
Yeah, I know, it's like
2 guys fucking the same dog.

1428
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,146
Listen, Neal,
all you gotta do is

1429
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:45,974
get a teaser, 4 acts,
write out the beats,

1430
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:47,715
and we'll worry about
the credits later.

1431
01:07:47,759 --> 01:07:49,543
Ok, you know,
I don't want
to take anything

1432
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:50,675
away from Hank,
you know?

1433
01:07:50,718 --> 01:07:51,850
I said I think he's
great, you know?

1434
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,243
And the drug thing
doesn't worry me.

1435
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:55,810
I just sort of
feel like if he's
supervising producer

1436
01:07:55,854 --> 01:07:57,725
I should at least
be co-exec.

1437
01:07:57,769 --> 01:07:59,379
Hold on.

1438
01:08:00,815 --> 01:08:02,339
Jennifer?

1439
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:03,949
It's Hank.

1440
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:06,386
Hank. Hank, I thought
you were with Neal.

1441
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:08,954
Well, that's what
I'm calling about: Neal.

1442
01:08:08,997 --> 01:08:10,782
Hank, I've got
a client on the line

1443
01:08:10,825 --> 01:08:11,870
on location in Hawaii.

1444
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:14,655
He's about to leave
the set. Hold on.

1445
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:15,874
Neal?

1446
01:08:15,917 --> 01:08:17,484
I've got a client
on the line from Vermont.

1447
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:18,833
He's just arriving
to the set,

1448
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:20,444
and he's got a case
of tsuris.Hold on.

1449
01:08:20,487 --> 01:08:22,359
All right, what's
the problem with Neal?

1450
01:08:22,402 --> 01:08:24,056
Well, there's no problem.

1451
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,492
He's been a big help.

1452
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:27,233
But you have a problem
sharing the same credit,
right?

1453
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:31,585
Well, I don't think
he's ever been more
than story editor.

1454
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:32,891
Hang on.

1455
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,849
Neal, what's the biggest
staff job you ever had?

1456
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,417
Executive story
consultant on
monkey's up.

1457
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:38,549
You know, I don't
think Hank's
ever been

1458
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,725
anything more than,
like, story editor.

1459
01:08:40,768 --> 01:08:42,509
Hold on. What about you?

1460
01:08:42,553 --> 01:08:45,991
Co-producer
on the rectifier.

1461
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,514
Hang on.

1462
01:09:10,058 --> 01:09:11,582
Danny: Ok, Hank,
here's the deal:

1463
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:14,759
You get supervising,
plus 5k more a week,

1464
01:09:14,802 --> 01:09:16,326
Neal gets
straight producer,

1465
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:18,241
we'll tell him
it's the same money.

1466
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,199
It's our little secret.

1467
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:21,983
I think that's fair.

1468
01:09:30,253 --> 01:09:32,168
Danny: All right, Neal,
but this is gonna be
our little secret.

1469
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:33,343
Don't you think
that's fair?

1470
01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:35,345
Yeah, it's fair.
Now go to work.

1471
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:37,738
Go to work, Hank.

1472
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:47,748
"Client of mine..."

1473
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:49,010
Don't you even
speak to me.

1474
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:53,101
I have no burning desire
to speak to you.

1475
01:09:55,147 --> 01:09:57,454
Fuck!

1476
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,371
My laptop.

1477
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:04,417
Neal:

1478
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:06,419
Where are my car keys?

1479
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:11,859
Fuck!

1480
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:20,363
Man: This is
Dr. Jerry applefield's

1481
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:22,060
current patient line.

1482
01:11:22,103 --> 01:11:23,322
Referrals should--

1483
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:24,410
hello?

1484
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:26,978
Jerry? Brian.

1485
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:29,502
I just can't do it.

1486
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:32,113
Brian, how many times
have I told you?

1487
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:33,332
In order
to have something,

1488
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:36,466
you must first
stop wanting it.

1489
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:59,140
Ira: All right, that's it.
I say we hitch.

1490
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:01,142
Benny: You know,
it would have
been faster

1491
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:02,492
if we stayed
on the bus.

1492
01:12:02,535 --> 01:12:03,928
I'd be back in jail.

1493
01:12:03,971 --> 01:12:05,538
You know, maybe it's
not such a bad idea,

1494
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:08,411
you have
the old lady be
the bad guy?

1495
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:10,064
Just keep walking.

1496
01:12:11,414 --> 01:12:14,025
Bang-zoom.

1497
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,548
Hank: Karma.

1498
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:17,376
Neal: Come again?
I didn't hear you
the first 15 times.

1499
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,899
But you know something?

1500
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,640
This didn't happen
because we were
in those phone booths

1501
01:12:20,684 --> 01:12:21,946
cutting each other's
throats.

1502
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:23,469
Yeah, it did,
and you know it,

1503
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:24,818
and if Karma
does exist,

1504
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:26,342
then that asshole
will run Danny over
in my car.

1505
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:29,736
I think that when
we agreed to do this
behind Brian's back,

1506
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:32,522
we established duplicity
as a ground rule.

1507
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:33,914
Danny was screwing US.

1508
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:35,438
How could we not eventually
try to screw each other?

1509
01:12:35,481 --> 01:12:38,136
Yeah, well, it didn't
take US very long,
though, did it?

1510
01:12:38,179 --> 01:12:39,616
There is a way
to make it right.

1511
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:41,269
Yeah, do we have
to kill a chicken?

1512
01:12:41,313 --> 01:12:42,401
When we get
to Brian's house,

1513
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:44,403
we wake him up,
sit him down,

1514
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:46,405
and tell him
what we tried to do.

1515
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:47,841
Yeah,
that should
calm the waters.

1516
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:50,104
Hey, pal, when you
were having your
nervous breakdown,

1517
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,802
Hank and I tried
to fuck you
in the ass.

1518
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:55,675
And then we give him
"escape from hell."

1519
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,068
Let him say
it's his.

1520
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,374
It'll solve
his problem.

1521
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,244
Temporarily.

1522
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:00,332
It's an act
of contrition.

1523
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,813
It'll put US right
with the lord.

1524
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:03,814
And who knows?

1525
01:13:03,857 --> 01:13:04,945
Maybe he'll
get his shit together

1526
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,426
and wind up running
the show after all.

1527
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:09,297
And we wait till then
to tell him about Danny.

1528
01:13:09,341 --> 01:13:13,998
And we fuck Danny,
and the Karma wheel
comes full-circle.

1529
01:13:14,041 --> 01:13:15,478
See what
I'm saying?

1530
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,871
I'm with you.
Very zen.

1531
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:36,847
Brian: It's
never gonna work!

1532
01:13:37,195 --> 01:13:40,024
It's never
gonna work!

1533
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:43,157
Honey, come on.

1534
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,463
Stop that.

1535
01:13:44,507 --> 01:13:45,246
Aah!

1536
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,423
No. Come here.
Stop that.

1537
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:48,249
It's never
gonna work.

1538
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:49,294
It's never
gonna work.

1539
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:51,862
Come on, you're
gonna hurt yourself.

1540
01:13:51,905 --> 01:13:52,906
Never gonna work.

1541
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:55,518
It's fine. It's ok.

1542
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:58,477
I'm here.

1543
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:00,436
It's never
gonna work.

1544
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,220
No, no, no, no.

1545
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:03,961
It's fine.

1546
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:06,485
It's fine.

1547
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,490
It's ok.

1548
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:15,581
No, no, no, no.
It's fine.

1549
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,322
It's fine.

1550
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:20,064
Come on, now.
You're exhausted, Brian,

1551
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:22,980
and you just need
to sleep.

1552
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:24,416
I'll take care of you.

1553
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:26,113
Just get under
the covers, Brian.

1554
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:27,550
I'll take care
of you.

1555
01:14:27,593 --> 01:14:28,899
You can't
take care of me.

1556
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:31,989
I'll
take care of you.
Just sleep.

1557
01:14:32,032 --> 01:14:33,643
Sorry.

1558
01:15:12,595 --> 01:15:14,684
Shit.

1559
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:38,446
Yes?

1560
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:40,144
Where's Brian?

1561
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,188
Who are you?

1562
01:15:41,232 --> 01:15:43,364
We're
Brian's friends.
Who are you?

1563
01:15:43,408 --> 01:15:45,366
I'm Brian's girlfriend.

1564
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,759
You're Miranda?

1565
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:47,760
Yes.

1566
01:15:49,196 --> 01:15:50,589
I'm Benny kanopka.

1567
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:53,461
This is ira gold--
kanopka-gold.

1568
01:15:53,505 --> 01:15:54,593
Nice to meet you.

1569
01:15:54,637 --> 01:15:57,378
Listen, we need
to see Brian.

1570
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:59,859
I'm afraid
that's impossible now.

1571
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:03,471
You see, Brian spent the night
in the emergency hospital,

1572
01:16:03,515 --> 01:16:05,386
and, um, he's resting now.

1573
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,518
Emergency hospital?

1574
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:07,563
What happened?

1575
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:10,435
How well did you say
you knew Brian?

1576
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:14,178
Stress?

1577
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:17,094
They had to shoot him up
with thorazine.

1578
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,270
How terrible.

1579
01:16:19,313 --> 01:16:20,619
I just wonder.

1580
01:16:20,663 --> 01:16:22,490
The thing that seemed
to set him off
last night--

1581
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,405
he thought
he saw something
over at the hotel.

1582
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:25,929
He was desperate
to find out what it was.

1583
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:28,018
He wants to turn it
into a story.

1584
01:16:28,061 --> 01:16:29,062
See, the thing is,

1585
01:16:29,106 --> 01:16:32,588
we know what happened
at the hotel.

1586
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,720
That's very sweet of you,

1587
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:36,504
but the doctor said
the last thing Brian
needs right now

1588
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,289
is to start thinking
about work again.

1589
01:16:38,332 --> 01:16:41,466
So I will let him know
you came by. So long.

1590
01:16:41,509 --> 01:16:43,337
Hey--hey!

1591
01:16:47,472 --> 01:16:49,039
Benny: I hope
he'll be all right.

1592
01:16:49,082 --> 01:16:50,649
Fuck him.
We'll nail him later.

1593
01:16:50,693 --> 01:16:51,824
Let's get
a cheeseburger.

1594
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:53,913
How could you get
a cheeseburger now?

1595
01:16:53,957 --> 01:16:54,914
Boy.

1596
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:56,568
Look at this.

1597
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,438
Shit.

1598
01:16:57,482 --> 01:16:58,962
Got out ok?

1599
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:00,398
No. I was killed

1600
01:17:00,441 --> 01:17:01,617
in a cell block
riot.

1601
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:04,271
What's up with Brian?
Is everything ok?

1602
01:17:04,315 --> 01:17:05,577
Not exactly.

1603
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,753
He can't see anyone
right now.

1604
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:17,807
Brian?

1605
01:17:19,156 --> 01:17:21,375
My god! Jesus.

1606
01:17:21,419 --> 01:17:22,507
Brian! Jesus!

1607
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:24,857
What do you think
you're doing?

1608
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,686
How could you do
such a thing?

1609
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:30,428
I told you I was
gonna take care
of you.

1610
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:32,691
I'm gonna
take care of you.

1611
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,388
For god sakes.

1612
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,305
Come on.

1613
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,440
Jesus,
that is fucking awful.

1614
01:17:42,483 --> 01:17:44,094
Yeah, well,
can we see him?

1615
01:17:44,137 --> 01:17:45,356
No. Not for
a couple of days.

1616
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,401
We talked
to the doctor
ourselves.

1617
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,447
He's all right.
The girlfriend's
with him.

1618
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:50,927
The g--
what girlfriend?

1619
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,668
You don't know
Brian's girlfriend?

1620
01:17:52,711 --> 01:17:54,321
We do.
Lovely girl.

1621
01:17:54,365 --> 01:17:56,628
Well, if it's
all the same to you,
if she's still up there,

1622
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,021
we'd like
to talk to her.

1623
01:17:58,064 --> 01:17:59,065
You want
to talk to her?

1624
01:17:59,109 --> 01:18:00,893
You don't want
to talk to Brian?

1625
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:02,939
So what if we do?

1626
01:18:12,339 --> 01:18:14,994
Benny: You're not
allowed up there.
Stay back.

1627
01:18:15,038 --> 01:18:16,387
I'm not fucking
with you, man.

1628
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:18,258
I'm not bullshitting.
Now, stay-!

1629
01:18:18,302 --> 01:18:20,173
Hank: Just let me
talk to--
don't touch me.

1630
01:18:20,217 --> 01:18:22,480
Ira: I'm gonna smack you.
I'm gonna smack you hard.

1631
01:18:22,523 --> 01:18:24,308
Are you laying hands
on me?

1632
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,713
Jeez.

1633
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:38,975
All right. Ok.

1634
01:18:39,018 --> 01:18:43,153
All right. Fuck it.
Let's go. Come on.

1635
01:18:44,023 --> 01:18:45,503
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1636
01:18:45,546 --> 01:18:46,722
Hey, come here!
Come here!

1637
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,288
All right,
all right,
all right!

1638
01:18:48,332 --> 01:18:50,334
All right,
time-out, time-out.

1639
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:51,727
Come on.
This is idiotic.

1640
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,164
Let's be up-front
with each other.

1641
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,208
Tell him, Neal.

1642
01:18:55,252 --> 01:18:57,602
We've got a story
for him.

1643
01:18:57,645 --> 01:18:58,821
Well, we got
a story, too.

1644
01:18:58,864 --> 01:19:01,562
But the doctor said
no stories today!

1645
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,260
We're not
bullshitting you.

1646
01:19:03,303 --> 01:19:04,348
He's in bad shape.

1647
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:06,306
Well, why are you
keeping US from him?

1648
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:07,394
We're not keeping you
from him.

1649
01:19:07,438 --> 01:19:09,440
We're protecting him
from you!

1650
01:19:09,483 --> 01:19:10,789
What's the difference?!

1651
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:12,051
Motive.

1652
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,487
Aha!

1653
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:15,359
Wait
a minute.

1654
01:19:15,402 --> 01:19:16,534
Danny.

1655
01:19:16,577 --> 01:19:20,451
Danny came after you guys,
too, didn't he?

1656
01:19:20,494 --> 01:19:21,408
No.

1657
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:22,583
You guys been
talking to Danny?

1658
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:24,194
Come on, ira.
Coy really
is not you.

1659
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:26,718
What's the matter
with you? I've been
in jail all night!

1660
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:27,937
What'd Danny say?

1661
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:29,155
Is it about
the show?

1662
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,897
Show US a girlfriend
and Brian in a puddle

1663
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:34,334
of his own urine,
and maybe we'll tell you.

1664
01:19:42,603 --> 01:19:43,561
Well?

1665
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:44,431
She's in there.
We just left her.

1666
01:19:44,475 --> 01:19:46,129
Maybe she went
back to sleep.

1667
01:19:46,172 --> 01:19:46,912
She's not asleep.

1668
01:19:46,956 --> 01:19:48,348
Well,
then where is she?

1669
01:19:48,392 --> 01:19:52,875
Miranda? Miranda?

1670
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:54,354
Ira: Miranda?

1671
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:57,793
Is everything
all right?

1672
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,581
I'm gonna call
911!

1673
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,410
I'm in the shower!

1674
01:20:06,453 --> 01:20:08,455
Could you guys
come back later?

1675
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:11,328
Ira: Ok, sorry.

1676
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:13,460
We're leaving now...

1677
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,027
All of US.

1678
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:44,143
Well, well, look
what you did now.

1679
01:20:44,187 --> 01:20:46,058
You fucking idiot.

1680
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:47,364
Youpushed me!

1681
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:49,366
He was trying
to hold you back.

1682
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:50,889
Well, he let go.

1683
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:52,978
Sorry, Miranda.

1684
01:20:54,371 --> 01:20:55,372
Miranda?

1685
01:20:55,415 --> 01:20:56,939
Yep,
that's Miranda.

1686
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:59,376
Hank: Well, she sure wasn't
in the shower, was she?

1687
01:20:59,419 --> 01:21:01,508
Yeah, and her name
isn't Miranda.

1688
01:21:01,552 --> 01:21:03,206
Yes, it is.
She told US.

1689
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,077
Well, Hank,
what do you think

1690
01:21:05,121 --> 01:21:07,079
these three
are trying to pull?

1691
01:21:07,123 --> 01:21:07,993
You're paranoid.

1692
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:08,951
Maybe I'm paranoid,

1693
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,909
but her name is
Georgia feckler.

1694
01:21:10,953 --> 01:21:12,345
And she's a writer.

1695
01:21:12,389 --> 01:21:13,694
So the fuck what.

1696
01:21:13,738 --> 01:21:16,393
All right, j-just
tell me one thing.
Is Brian ok?

1697
01:21:16,436 --> 01:21:17,394
Yeah.

1698
01:21:17,437 --> 01:21:18,917
Neal, how do you
know her?

1699
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:20,614
Neal:
She came in to pitch
on monkey's up.

1700
01:21:20,658 --> 01:21:23,443
You had a partner
back then--
a guy with a goatee.

1701
01:21:23,487 --> 01:21:24,575
Yeah, well, now I don't.

1702
01:21:24,618 --> 01:21:26,707
Well, what the hell
are you doing here?

1703
01:21:26,751 --> 01:21:29,145
Who do you think you are?

1704
01:21:29,188 --> 01:21:31,495
Hey, we're Brian's--
friends.

1705
01:21:31,538 --> 01:21:32,409
Really?

1706
01:21:32,452 --> 01:21:33,453
Yeah. And right now

1707
01:21:33,497 --> 01:21:35,760
we're going upstairs
to check on him.

1708
01:21:35,803 --> 01:21:38,241
No, you're not.

1709
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:39,938
Ok...

1710
01:21:39,982 --> 01:21:41,157
Is Brian still alive?

1711
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,856
Yeah. Now no one
try anything funny.

1712
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,162
Are you screwing him?

1713
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:49,469
He happens to know
my work, all right?
Jesus.

1714
01:21:49,513 --> 01:21:51,080
Why'd you let US think
you were his girlfriend?

1715
01:21:51,123 --> 01:21:54,953
Brian wanted to talk to me
about a job on the new show.

1716
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:56,520
I knew that he blew you off.

1717
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:59,305
I just didn't want
to hurt your feelings, ok?

1718
01:21:59,349 --> 01:22:00,741
Men: Bullshit!

1719
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:02,221
Look, 2 minutes ago you're
all at each other's throats.

1720
01:22:02,265 --> 01:22:05,398
A minute a woman appears,
you're the rockettes.

1721
01:22:05,442 --> 01:22:07,357
Hey, sex had nothing
to do with it.

1722
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,576
You lied to US.
You were gonna
cut US out.

1723
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:10,969
Well, I didn't see
much chance

1724
01:22:11,013 --> 01:22:14,277
of getting invited
to the poker game,
did I, Neal?

1725
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,192
I have no idea
what you're
talking about.

1726
01:22:16,235 --> 01:22:18,542
The reason you cut US off
on the monkey's upstory

1727
01:22:18,585 --> 01:22:20,196
is because
I wouldn't play ball.

1728
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,285
Well, I hate to break it
to you, but the reason
you got cut off

1729
01:22:22,328 --> 01:22:24,069
was because your
partner was a psycho.

1730
01:22:24,113 --> 01:22:25,375
He acted that way
'cause everyone

1731
01:22:25,418 --> 01:22:27,377
on your writing staff
kept hitting on me.

1732
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,074
I did not
hit on you.

1733
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:30,380
So you walk
all the freelancers

1734
01:22:30,423 --> 01:22:32,817
out to lot "z"
after the story meetings.

1735
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,949
It was dark.

1736
01:22:33,992 --> 01:22:35,341
Which explains why you
cracked your head

1737
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:37,996
on my car door
after you made your pounce.

1738
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:39,041
Jesus. Neal.

1739
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:39,998
That is weak.

1740
01:22:40,042 --> 01:22:42,392
You pounced on her?
That's sad.

1741
01:22:42,435 --> 01:22:43,871
She is lying!

1742
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:46,309
You guys are beautiful.
You're all freaked out

1743
01:22:46,352 --> 01:22:48,006
because after all
your card games

1744
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,009
and your cocksucking,
Brian went for me.

1745
01:22:51,053 --> 01:22:52,358
On my merits.

1746
01:22:52,402 --> 01:22:55,274
Hey, we did
a thirtysomething.

1747
01:22:55,318 --> 01:22:56,362
Well...

1748
01:22:58,538 --> 01:22:59,757
Come on! I got her!

1749
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:03,456
Hey, Brian!
Hold her!

1750
01:23:06,459 --> 01:23:08,722
My head!

1751
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:10,811
Jesus.

1752
01:23:10,855 --> 01:23:12,378
Man.

1753
01:23:16,165 --> 01:23:19,342
Georgia: Go away.
I told you to leave
Brian alone.

1754
01:23:19,385 --> 01:23:21,953
He's my responsi--

1755
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,999
Brian.

1756
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:26,784
My god.

1757
01:23:27,741 --> 01:23:28,786
My god.

1758
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:30,222
"How do I know it's valium"?

1759
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:32,616
I know it's valium because
I'm holding the empty bottle

1760
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:35,314
with your fucking
phone number on it.

1761
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:36,794
I'm sorry, Dr. Applefield.

1762
01:23:36,837 --> 01:23:40,928
I--well, yeah, he's
breathing all right,

1763
01:23:40,972 --> 01:23:43,670
but he's completely
unconscious.

1764
01:23:43,714 --> 01:23:47,544
He's--his color
is not good at all.

1765
01:23:47,587 --> 01:23:50,460
His--his chest
is all gurgly,

1766
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:52,114
sounds rather phlegmy.

1767
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:54,246
And, I mean,
as far as I know--

1768
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:56,161
and I don't know much
about it--

1769
01:23:56,205 --> 01:23:57,336
he's completely comatose.

1770
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,164
I mean, this is
Judy garland time.

1771
01:23:59,208 --> 01:24:00,470
I cannot wake him up.

1772
01:24:00,513 --> 01:24:01,862
Dr. Applefield:
You think you're
gonna be able

1773
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:03,299
to stay with him
for a couple of days?

1774
01:24:03,342 --> 01:24:06,041
Well, yeah, sure,
but shouldn't he be
in a hospital?

1775
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:07,520
No. I think
I was able to get

1776
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:10,001
everything out of him
when I had him
in the bathroom.

1777
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,394
Does he need anything
special?

1778
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:15,137
You have any
good ideas for a script?

1779
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,836
Hollywood shrink humor.

1780
01:24:19,967 --> 01:24:22,361
He'll be all right
in a couple of days.

1781
01:24:22,405 --> 01:24:26,409
I'm afraid it's
an occupational hazard
with these guys.

1782
01:24:26,452 --> 01:24:29,368
It's a lot of pressure.

1783
01:24:31,544 --> 01:24:33,416
You don't think
he'll do it again.

1784
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:35,200
No. He doesn't
want to die.

1785
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:37,028
He just
doesn't want to write.

1786
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,377
I think when he realizes

1787
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:39,900
that he doesn't have to
take this job,

1788
01:24:39,944 --> 01:24:43,295
he's going
to start to feel some--
some immediate relief.

1789
01:24:43,339 --> 01:24:46,516
All right.
Well, thank you, doctor.

1790
01:24:46,559 --> 01:24:49,084
I'll take care of everything.

1791
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:04,795
So how'd you
get to him, anyway?

1792
01:25:04,838 --> 01:25:07,711
I heard about his deal
2 weeks ago.

1793
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:10,583
I knew somebody
who knew somebody
who used to date him.

1794
01:25:10,627 --> 01:25:12,498
They said he drinks
at the chateau bar.

1795
01:25:12,542 --> 01:25:15,501
I'd been sitting
in that same cocktail dress

1796
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:16,807
every night for a week.

1797
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:20,071
He thought I was this girl
he saw on the balcony.

1798
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:21,551
I went with it.

1799
01:25:21,594 --> 01:25:24,467
Women who sit
in hotel lobbies
in cocktail dresses

1800
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:26,295
in hopes of making money.
Gee--

1801
01:25:26,338 --> 01:25:27,644
go fuck yourself, Hank.

1802
01:25:27,687 --> 01:25:29,254
Ira, well,
who the hell did he
see up there then?

1803
01:25:29,298 --> 01:25:32,475
It was a guy.
He had a 13-inch--
forget it.

1804
01:25:32,518 --> 01:25:33,998
It doesn't matter
anyhow now.

1805
01:25:34,041 --> 01:25:35,565
All connection disconnected.

1806
01:25:35,608 --> 01:25:38,437
Well, he'd been
disconnected anyway.

1807
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:41,005
No, he wasn't.
He would have made it.

1808
01:25:41,048 --> 01:25:42,006
Think so?

1809
01:25:42,049 --> 01:25:43,573
Danny came to US,
offered US gigs.

1810
01:25:43,616 --> 01:25:45,270
He needed some material
to stall the networks

1811
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:47,316
until he found
a replacement for Brian.

1812
01:25:47,359 --> 01:25:48,447
You turned him down?

1813
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:49,753
We're not that desperate.

1814
01:25:49,796 --> 01:25:51,581
When did this happen?

1815
01:25:51,624 --> 01:25:52,538
Late last night.

1816
01:25:52,582 --> 01:25:54,845
And you told him no
last night?

1817
01:25:54,888 --> 01:25:55,846
Yeah.

1818
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:58,892
That's too bad.

1819
01:26:00,764 --> 01:26:03,506
I mean, we gave him
the impression that
we would--

1820
01:26:03,549 --> 01:26:05,464
in other words,
you said you'd do it.

1821
01:26:05,508 --> 01:26:06,639
Yes, but subsequently

1822
01:26:06,683 --> 01:26:09,642
we embraced
a new philosophy.

1823
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,951
So Danny thinks you guys
are still doing the show?

1824
01:26:13,994 --> 01:26:16,345
Good. That'll buy US
some time.

1825
01:26:16,388 --> 01:26:17,128
What?

1826
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,347
Brian's doing the show.

1827
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,131
Can somebody
make some coffee?

1828
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,567
Ha ha ha. Have you
see him lately?

1829
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:24,266
I don't think a cup
of coffee's gonna
do the trick.

1830
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:25,615
It's for US,
you imbecile.

1831
01:26:25,658 --> 01:26:27,530
Now, you said you had
a story for the show, right?

1832
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:29,227
Yeah.

1833
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:30,533
Now, what about you two?
Did you manage to come up
with anything

1834
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:32,404
before you realized Danny
was bullshitting you?

1835
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,494
Yes. We open in a desert.
Death valley.

1836
01:26:35,538 --> 01:26:37,453
Whatever.
Brian's doing the show.

1837
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:39,237
You're gonna be
the staff.

1838
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:40,282
Who you gonna be?

1839
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:41,500
I'm gonna be Brian.

1840
01:26:41,544 --> 01:26:42,893
Why do you
get to be Brian?

1841
01:26:42,936 --> 01:26:45,243
Outside of his shrink,
we're the only 5 people

1842
01:26:45,287 --> 01:26:47,637
who know exactly what kind
of shape Brian is in.

1843
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,073
And we're all writers.

1844
01:26:49,116 --> 01:26:50,379
So we front for him.

1845
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:53,251
Exactly. Brian has this
incredible opportunity.

1846
01:26:53,295 --> 01:26:55,427
He doesn't want to do it.
We do.

1847
01:26:55,471 --> 01:26:56,298
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1848
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:58,387
Why do you
get to be Brian?

1849
01:26:58,430 --> 01:26:59,344
Because...

1850
01:26:59,388 --> 01:27:01,346
I'm Brian's new partner.

1851
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:03,914
Does Brian knowthis?

1852
01:27:03,957 --> 01:27:05,220
Let me take care of Brian.

1853
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:06,830
You guys just keep
bullshitting Danny.

1854
01:27:06,873 --> 01:27:10,268
Tell him you came by
to see Brian last night
to get your car.

1855
01:27:10,312 --> 01:27:12,183
Brian waved you in.

1856
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:13,837
He--he was up working
all night.

1857
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,273
He come up with
3 great stories.

1858
01:27:15,317 --> 01:27:17,406
6. We're gonna work
all night if we have to.

1859
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:18,842
Could you go
make the coffee?

1860
01:27:18,885 --> 01:27:20,060
No, no, but i--i
want to stay here--

1861
01:27:20,104 --> 01:27:21,366
Neal: Benny, would you
make some damn coffee?

1862
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:23,281
She asked you
to make the coffee.

1863
01:27:23,325 --> 01:27:24,848
Do you want the job
or not?

1864
01:27:26,502 --> 01:27:27,416
Jack-off.

1865
01:27:27,459 --> 01:27:29,635
Bring me some
sweet n' low, too.

1866
01:27:30,767 --> 01:27:31,898
Your team?

1867
01:27:31,942 --> 01:27:33,204
Like the '62 mets.

1868
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,512
Great. You'll fill one
supervising producer slot.

1869
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:39,123
You're producer.
You're co-producer.

1870
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:39,993
Wait a minute.

1871
01:27:40,037 --> 01:27:41,430
Don't get greedy.

1872
01:27:41,473 --> 01:27:42,518
I could go to Danny.

1873
01:27:42,561 --> 01:27:43,997
Don't be greedy andstupid.

1874
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:48,219
You're supposed to save that
in case I try and fire you.

1875
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,612
Why would Brian
go for this?

1876
01:27:49,655 --> 01:27:50,743
Hank,
do you mind?

1877
01:27:50,787 --> 01:27:52,049
Why wouldn't he go for it?

1878
01:27:52,092 --> 01:27:53,398
He doesn't have to go
through with the torture.

1879
01:27:53,442 --> 01:27:56,183
He gets to share
45 grand a show.

1880
01:27:56,227 --> 01:27:57,446
He gets to keep his house.

1881
01:27:57,489 --> 01:27:58,534
And he'll be getting

1882
01:27:58,577 --> 01:28:00,100
the best sex
of his entire life.

1883
01:28:00,144 --> 01:28:02,451
You said you didn't
sleep with him.

1884
01:28:02,494 --> 01:28:03,626
Grow up.

1885
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:05,671
Hank: What will a producer
get per episode?

1886
01:28:05,715 --> 01:28:07,499
Georgia:
I don't know--12?

1887
01:28:12,722 --> 01:28:14,463
Hank: Ira,
let her finish.

1888
01:28:14,506 --> 01:28:18,118
Georgia:
By the way, that time
in the parking lot--

1889
01:28:18,162 --> 01:28:20,643
Benny,
where's that coffee?

1890
01:28:29,652 --> 01:28:31,262
Man: Hello?

1891
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,698
It's Brian.

1892
01:28:32,742 --> 01:28:34,657
Well...

1893
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,136
It worked.

1894
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,487
That's beautiful.
Do you think they
can handle it?

1895
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:41,141
You know
what's really great?

1896
01:28:41,185 --> 01:28:43,143
I don't care.

1897
01:28:43,187 --> 01:28:44,406
Wonderful.

1898
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:46,973
That's exactly where
we were trying to get to.

1899
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:49,672
Those 22 shows--
they guaranteed?

1900
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:50,977
Absolutely.

1901
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:52,544
So what'd I tell you?

1902
01:28:52,588 --> 01:28:55,460
In order to have something,
you must first stop wanting it.

1903
01:28:55,504 --> 01:28:57,680
Or appearing to want it.

1904
01:28:57,723 --> 01:28:58,811
Yeah, well,

1905
01:28:58,855 --> 01:29:00,770
we'll get into that
in the next session.

1906
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:02,424
Brian, you're feeling ok?

1907
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:04,904
I'm still
a little phlegmy

1908
01:29:04,948 --> 01:29:06,253
from the choco-ccino.

1909
01:29:06,297 --> 01:29:08,343
Well, I'll send up
some expectorate.

1910
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:09,474
That ought to clear you up.

1911
01:29:09,518 --> 01:29:12,042
Brian, are those guys
still downstairs?

1912
01:29:12,825 --> 01:29:13,739
Do me a favor, will you?

1913
01:29:13,783 --> 01:29:15,393
Will you flush
that bag of pills

1914
01:29:15,437 --> 01:29:17,308
before one of them
gets into it?

1915
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:18,701
Sure.

1916
01:29:18,744 --> 01:29:21,312
And, Brian,
I'm proud of you.
I'll see you Monday.

1917
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:22,487
Monday.

1918
01:30:29,815 --> 01:30:31,861
Thank you very much.
