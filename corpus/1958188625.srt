1
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,800
- Stop moving it!

2
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:09,001
- I'm not moving it.

3
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,603
I thought you were moving it.

4
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:11,971
- No.

5
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,773
- Then it
must be the spirits.

6
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:15,975
- Please
try and be serious.

7
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,409
- Okay, fine.

8
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,847
- Are there any
spirits here with us?

9
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,480
That's it! We're done!

10
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,849
Do it yourself!

11
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,685
- Laura! You know I
need you for safety.

12
00:01:25,687 --> 00:01:27,722
The devil's not gonna
fuck with a virgin.

13
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,792
Okay, fine. I was
totally moving it.

14
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:34,627
- It's not funny. Viola!

15
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,127
How are we supposed
to contact anyone

16
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,797
if you're messing
around with it?

17
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,734
- Relax. It's just a game.

18
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:43,603
Where did you get this
one? It looks really old.

19
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,271
- It was this
weird store in town.

20
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,541
- You think it actually works?

21
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:49,644
- Yeah, I kind of do.

22
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,279
I used it last night and
someone came through.

23
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:55,948
- As if!

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,916
- I'm serious.

25
00:01:56,918 --> 00:01:59,150
- Oh yeah? Who'd you contact?

26
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,553
- You're gonna think I'm crazy.

27
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:01,355
- Too late.

28
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,690
- I think it was Mary Blackwood.

29
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:06,159
- The witch of Hazel Street?

30
00:02:08,029 --> 00:02:09,260
Okay, fine.

31
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,664
Let's see what the old
hag has to say tonight.

32
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,398
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

33
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,209
- We want to speak to the
spirit of Mary Blackwood.

34
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,746
Are you there?

35
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,985
- You heard that?

36
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:33,888
- Most definitely.

37
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:35,923
No one else is home?

38
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:44,964
Are all the doors walked?

39
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:45,900
- I think so.

40
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,401
It could be Tim! He said
he was gonna stop by.

41
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:52,203
I wouldn't put it past
him to try and scare us.

42
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,405
- And when were
you gonna tell me

43
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,608
you took that trifling
man whore back?

44
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,710
- He promised me the
rumors weren't true.

45
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,177
- Oh, he promised?

46
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,781
Because he's always been nothing
but 100% percent truthful

47
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:03,582
since you met him.

48
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,084
- I know you don't like him.

49
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,287
- Sweetie, I know he looks like
he got off the casting couch

50
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,756
of Dawson's Creek,

51
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,358
but he has the personality
of a box of hair.

52
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,731
Come on, let's call his bluff.

53
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:20,034
- What if it's not him?

54
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,035
What if it's something else?

55
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,139
- Like who? Mary Blackwood?

56
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:54,900
- Tim!

57
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,468
- So original, Timothy.

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,803
- It worked on you, Vi.

59
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,538
- What the hell
are you doing here?

60
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,874
- I came to steal my girlfriend
back from your clutches.

61
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,542
- Which girlfriend?

62
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:04,645
- V, stop!

63
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:11,316
- I didn't know you girls
were raising the dead.

64
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,384
- Sure are.

65
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,453
You gonna join us ore
are you too scared?

66
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,488
- Let's do it.

67
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,990
- Tim, no, you don't have to.

68
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,493
- Come on, babe. It'll be fun.

69
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:22,494
Who we contacting?

70
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,196
- The witch. Mary Blackwood.

71
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:26,065
- Yeah, I thought she
was an urban legend.

72
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:27,533
- No, it's public record.

73
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,502
The people of the town
hanged her from the tree

74
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,971
and then burned
her body to ashes.

75
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:32,907
- All right.

76
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,675
Come on, Mary Blackwood,

77
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:39,078
take a break from
being Satan's whore

78
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,248
and show us that
hagged face of yours.

79
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,152
- I didn't do it. I swear.

80
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:51,926
- Relax. It was probably
just your breaker.

81
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,095
Where's your fuse box?

82
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,729
- In the attic.

83
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,632
- Of course it is.

84
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,969
- Tim, no, maybe you shouldn't!

85
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,395
- Hello? Is someone there?

86
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,371
- Laura, are you okay?

87
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,308
- When I used the
board last night,

88
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,343
I just wanted to know if
Tim was cheating on me.

89
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,180
- What'd it say?

90
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:49,114
- It said yes.

91
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,381
- See?

92
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,786
Even a dead witch
knows he's trash.

93
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:57,189
- I was so mad, I told her
I wanted Tim to be dead.

94
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,927
- Same, girl.
What's the problem?

95
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,651
- Last night I had a
dream that he was dead,

96
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:28,689
killed by the witch,
and it felt so real.

97
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,324
- It's fine.

98
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,159
It was just a dream.

99
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:36,295
- Tim!

100
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:38,797
- Laura, he's just
messing with us.

101
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,801
- Tim, this isn't funny!

102
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:51,870
No!

103
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,105
It's her!

104
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:56,675
It's the witch!

105
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,067
Who are you?

106
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,564
♪ This invented madness

107
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:09,968
♪ This invented madness

108
00:11:12,574 --> 00:11:15,140
♪ This invented madness

109
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,613
♪ This invented madness

110
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,817
- Oh, good morning, Sarah.

111
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:27,620
- Morning, Viola.

112
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:31,890
- Oh, I guess "mom" is
too formal these days.

113
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,594
- Morning, mother. Better?

114
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,894
- Yeah.

115
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:38,531
Can I make you a little
coffee? Something?

116
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,232
- That's okay. I
have to get to work.

117
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:42,067
- Ugh, I get so
worried about you

118
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:43,702
working at that bar so late.

119
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,672
I wish you could
find something else.

120
00:11:45,674 --> 00:11:47,906
- Yeah, well, I
don't love it either,

121
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,209
but how else am I gonna
get a place of my own?

122
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,810
- Yeah, I know you're
really not happy

123
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,345
about being back here.

124
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:55,983
I'm sure your stepmom's
place was so much bigger.

125
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,451
- It was, but I kind
of got the feeling

126
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:01,720
she wanted me out of
there as soon as possible.

127
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,855
- What makes you say that?

128
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,057
- She told me she
wanted me out of there

129
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,060
as soon as possible.

130
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,395
- That rotten woman.

131
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,829
To her own stepdaughter?

132
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,532
- Mom, it's fine.

133
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:14,667
- No, it's not fine!

134
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:16,068
I'm gonna call her.

135
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,671
I'm gonna give her
a piece of my mind!

136
00:12:18,673 --> 00:12:20,642
- Just forget about it.

137
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,844
She said I remind
her too much of him.

138
00:12:27,081 --> 00:12:28,082
- Honey, I'm sorry.

139
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,185
- Okay, I have to get to work.

140
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:34,246
- He was like, "Bro, I
heard all that screaming

141
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,180
in the room and everything."

142
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,683
I was like, "Yeah, that was me."

143
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,820
- Now you need to rub
some of that charisma off

144
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:42,921
on my little brother here.

145
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,156
- Oh, it's definitely
coming, man.

146
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:45,625
It's going on tonight.
Ain't that right, baby?

147
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:47,326
- Yeah. You ready to pop
that cherry, little brother?

148
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:48,561
- I don't know.

149
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:49,494
- I'm gonna
get 'em together.

150
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,929
Don't you worry about this, man.

151
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,164
I'm gonna get some titties
in your face, okay?

152
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,633
- Great! How long
have they been here?

153
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,568
- Long enough to make me
thankful I'm not a breeder.

154
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,603
- We should all be so lucky.

155
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,673
- And, tag, you're it.

156
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:02,374
- Don't do me any favors.

157
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,109
- I'll be your best friend.

158
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:05,814
Your very, very best friend.

159
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:08,415
- You're already my only friend.

160
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,518
Hey, guys.

161
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,619
- Good to see you, Sarah.

162
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:14,554
- Hi, Eric.

163
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:16,922
Sarah, our favorite beer witch.

164
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,358
- Clever, Caleb. Never
heard that one before.

165
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,926
- Oh, come on, darling.

166
00:14:20,928 --> 00:14:22,595
You don't have to be so uptight.

167
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:23,563
What's the matter?
Need to get laid?

168
00:14:24,398 --> 00:14:25,230
- Hey, come on, Isaac!

169
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,465
- Hey, hey!

170
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,066
I was just offering
my services.

171
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,470
- I'd rather join a convent.

172
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:31,405
- Asshole.

173
00:14:33,006 --> 00:14:34,172
- Is that funny to you?

174
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,007
- "You asshole!"

175
00:14:37,512 --> 00:14:41,947
- Look, I'm sorry about
him. He's he's just drunk.

176
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,451
- I didn't realize that
was an excuse for assault.

177
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,887
- I didn't mean to say it was.

178
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,088
- Are we done here, Derek?

179
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,960
- Look, I just wanna say
I'm really glad you're back.

180
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:55,963
You know, after you
left for New York,

181
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:58,997
I just never thought
I'd see you again.

182
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,835
- Things didn't
exactly go as planned.

183
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,870
- I'm sorry to hear
about your dad.

184
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,571
He was a really good guy.

185
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:06,938
- Thanks.

186
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,776
He was.

187
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,076
- You staying with your mom?

188
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,880
- For now, until I
find a place of my own.

189
00:15:13,882 --> 00:15:14,881
- How is she?

190
00:15:14,883 --> 00:15:16,783
You know, last I
heard she was...

191
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:17,985
- She's doing just fine.

192
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,792
- Fuck.

193
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,863
- Oh, Sarah!

194
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:32,130
Hey!

195
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,365
Hey, my little baby
brother Asher here,

196
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,600
and he needs a date.

197
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,034
You know anyone you
can hook him up with?

198
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,770
- He's joking. I don't...

199
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:38,538
I don't need help.

200
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,038
- Oh, nonsense!

201
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,473
Hey!

202
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:42,941
- No, no, no. He's right.

203
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,477
Hey, but listen. no good girls.

204
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,012
They ain't no fun.

205
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,381
- No, we need someone who's
gonna keep him on his toes.

206
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,751
A real witch, one
might say.

207
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:52,821
- Isaac, stop.

208
00:15:53,721 --> 00:15:55,489
- No one asked you, Derek.

209
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,591
What do you say, Sarah?

210
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:01,226
Think your mother still has
Mary Blackwood's number?

211
00:16:01,228 --> 00:16:03,228
Or we could just dust
off the old Ouija board

212
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,864
and get your dad to
grab it for us.

213
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:06,231
- Isaac, that's enough!

214
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,767
- It's okay, Derek.

215
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:08,768
I'm sorry, Isaac,

216
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,536
but the only single girl I know

217
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,206
is my good friend
Liz over there.

218
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,175
- Ugh.

219
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,077
- But I'm pretty sure her
dick is bigger than yours.

220
00:16:19,914 --> 00:16:20,748
- Shit!

221
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,115
- All of yours, in fact.

222
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:26,919
- Oh, shit, is that
right?

223
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:27,787
You wanna find out?

224
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:30,188
- Caleb, if I wanted
your comeback,

225
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,157
I'd scrape it off the
back of Isaac's throat.

226
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,158
- The fuck?

227
00:16:33,928 --> 00:16:34,760
- Stupid!

228
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,195
- Hey!

229
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,798
That's enough!

230
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,365
You boys, you're outta here.

231
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,033
- We haven't finished
our drinks yet!

232
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,235
- Oh, these?

233
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:44,770
- Jesus Christ!

234
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:45,607
- Out now, all of you!

235
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,173
- What the fuck?

236
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,742
- This ain't over!

237
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,042
Not by a long shot.

238
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,712
- Okay, Liz.

239
00:16:52,714 --> 00:16:53,548
- Sorry.

240
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,057
- Hey, you okay?

241
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,126
- I'm fine.

242
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,566
- Sometimes it's okay
to just not be fine.

243
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,868
Sometimes it's okay
to scream or cry

244
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,169
or punch someone in the teeth

245
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,272
'cause they slightly
inconvenienced you.

246
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:23,375
- Just being back here
and serving guys like that

247
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,745
makes me feel like
such a failure.

248
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:28,948
- Honey, most of those
boys have had an easy life

249
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,750
because of their families.

250
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:33,186
You've been through hell
and seen the other side.

251
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:36,558
That's a success, not a failure.

252
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,459
- I haven't thought
of it like that.

253
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,196
Every time my mom looks at me,

254
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:47,434
it makes me feel like
she's judging me too.

255
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,904
- Sarah, I'm not gonna
tell you what to do,

256
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,907
but my parents kicked
me out when I was 18.

257
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:57,142
I never spoke to them again.

258
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,477
Your mom wants to
be in your life.

259
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,582
What are you afraid of?

260
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,717
- I guess I'm still embarrassed.

261
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:07,987
- Hey, you're over a year sober,

262
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:11,059
something to be proud
of, not embarrassed by.

263
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:16,529
- I'm still learning how to
be around people, you know?

264
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,797
- Yes.

265
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,500
No one gets that more
than I do, believe me.

266
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:26,507
But this whole self-deprecation,
self-isolation bull shit,

267
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:28,375
it's not gonna make
anything better.

268
00:18:30,444 --> 00:18:33,012
- You're always
right. You know that?

269
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:34,214
- Yeah, I do.

270
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:54,667
Ride home?

271
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,136
- No thanks. I like the walk.

272
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,672
- You're out of my way anyway.

273
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:00,474
Get home safe.

274
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,720
- Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

275
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:48,554
It's just me.

276
00:19:48,556 --> 00:19:50,156
- Derek! What the hell?

277
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:51,590
- It's a good thing you're
not too trigger happy

278
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:52,792
with that thing.

279
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,026
- Why would you
sneak up on a woman

280
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:56,396
walking home alone in
the middle of the night?

281
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:00,032
- I was just trying
to catch up with you.

282
00:20:00,034 --> 00:20:01,002
Sorry I scared you.

283
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,705
- Well, I'm not sorry I
almost burnt your eyes out.

284
00:20:05,707 --> 00:20:07,640
- Not even a little bit?

285
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,776
- Maybe just a smidge.

286
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:11,276
What do you want?

287
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:16,050
- Look, I just wanna
apologize for my friends.

288
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:19,286
You know, they're douche bags.

289
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,823
- You are the company you keep.

290
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,827
- Okay. I deserve that.

291
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,930
- Why do you hang out with them?

292
00:20:30,932 --> 00:20:32,965
It must be exhausting.

293
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:36,037
- I mean, it is, but I don't
really have anyone else.

294
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,904
Asher's been there
since the sandbox,

295
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,609
and Isaac's always
looked out for us.

296
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,711
- It's okay to
outgrow your friends.

297
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:48,114
- Yeah, but it's not that easy.

298
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:50,616
Isaac's dad gave me a job
with the construction company,

299
00:20:50,618 --> 00:20:52,350
so it's not really wise

300
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,222
to get on the wrong
side of the family.

301
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,659
But maybe if I had someone
else to hang out with.

302
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,393
- Are you asking me out?

303
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,598
That's so sweet.

304
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,532
No.

305
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:08,266
- Wait, what?

306
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,869
Why?

307
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:12,605
- Because you asked me
to eighth grade formal

308
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:14,807
and then dumped me
for Julie Henderson

309
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:17,310
when you found out she
Frenches on the first date.

310
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:21,649
- I have to make it up to
you then, if you'll let me.

311
00:21:23,518 --> 00:21:27,352
- Kind of just been trying
to do me recently, you know?

312
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,557
- No, I've been doing me too.

313
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,793
Every night, in fact.

314
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,361
- A masturbation joke. Clever.

315
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:37,630
- Thank you.

316
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,667
I've been work-shopping
it. What do you think?

317
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,836
- I'd avoided it
as a pickup line.

318
00:21:43,838 --> 00:21:47,573
- Look, I just wanna say I
am really glad you're back.

319
00:21:59,787 --> 00:22:01,522
- Oh, isn't that cute?

320
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,590
- The hell do you guys want?

321
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:06,992
- Hey, man, we just wanna
offer the lady our apologies

322
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,261
for the misunderstanding
earlier, that's all.

323
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:11,063
- Save your breath.

324
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,498
- Just get back
in the car, guys.

325
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,701
- Oh, no can do, Romeo.

326
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:17,672
We have unfinished
business with Sarah.

327
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,208
You think you can just
treat us like shit

328
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,244
and get away with it?

329
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,847
- I call 'em like, I see 'em.

330
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:27,813
- Don't touch her!

331
00:22:27,815 --> 00:22:29,582
- Hey, where the fuck you going?

332
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:32,117
Motherfucker!

333
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,451
Hoo-hoo! Shit!

334
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:34,887
God damn!

335
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:38,025
I always knew he was
thick-headed.

336
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,599
- Cute.

337
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:49,402
Not so tough without your
little girlfriend around, huh?

338
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,403
Hey, Asher!

339
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,240
Get over here little brother.

340
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,977
My friend here
looks a bit thirsty.

341
00:22:57,511 --> 00:23:00,413
- Yeah, I think she
could use a drink.

342
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:13,493
- I am a bit thirsty.

343
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,136
- Fucking bitch!

344
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,903
Get her!

345
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,140
- Come on, come on, come on!

346
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:32,144
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

347
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,125
Bitch!

348
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:51,597
Where the fuck'd she go?

349
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:55,634
- Behind you!

350
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:02,174
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

351
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:03,409
Hey, no, no, please, God, no!

352
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:05,611
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

353
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:06,812
I didn't wanna do this.

354
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:09,949
I just want the guys
to accept me.

355
00:24:24,899 --> 00:24:25,931
- Hey, that's enough, Isaac.

356
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,866
- Keep him over there!

357
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:43,217
No smart-ass comment this time?

358
00:24:45,453 --> 00:24:46,952
- Come on, man.
Let's get outta here.

359
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:48,554
- I'm not done yet.

360
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:49,888
- Isaac, come on, man!

361
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,323
Let's go!

362
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,825
You wanted to teach her a
lesson, and you did, all right?

363
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:53,928
You proved your point!

364
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,284
Shit.

365
00:25:23,858 --> 00:25:26,892
- I think that's a sign from
above to get out of here.

366
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:28,594
- Look, I'm with him, Isaac.

367
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:29,897
Let's get outta here, man.

368
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:34,199
- Fine.

369
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:50,618
- Hey, what are we
gonna do about Derek?

370
00:25:51,485 --> 00:25:53,619
- Let's get him in the car.

371
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,054
- Watch your ass.

372
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:55,890
Get up!

373
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,958
Get your ass up, man!

374
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,627
- Good evening.

375
00:28:14,629 --> 00:28:15,696
How can I help you?

376
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,768
My goodness, you're hurt!

377
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:23,837
What happened?

378
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:32,681
- This group of
guys attacked me,

379
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:37,952
and then I woke up

380
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,622
and I was alone.

381
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,924
- These men that
did this to you,

382
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,829
what would you like
to see done to them?

383
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:52,965
- I don't know.

384
00:28:52,967 --> 00:28:55,300
I guess I should call the cops.

385
00:28:55,302 --> 00:28:56,835
- Oh, you can.

386
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:59,505
But what's to stop them from
doing this to another girl?

387
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:01,340
How long would they be locked up

388
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:03,344
before they were
back on the streets?

389
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:08,413
- I guess I hadn't
thought of that.

390
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,084
- And that's if
they believe you.

391
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,952
These men have money,

392
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:16,522
maybe strings that can
be pulled in the town

393
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:17,891
to get them out of trouble.

394
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,262
And you.

395
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:27,268
Well, you have a past.

396
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,070
It's written all over you.

397
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:35,342
What if you could stop
these men for good,

398
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:39,980
teach them that they can't
just get away with everything?

399
00:29:42,916 --> 00:29:44,483
- In a perfect world.

400
00:29:44,485 --> 00:29:46,719
- It is a perfect world.

401
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,453
There are other
ways to make sure

402
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,324
someone gets what they deserve.

403
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:54,729
- How would I do that?

404
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,167
- Come sit and rest.

405
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:09,009
Have you ever used a
spirit board before?

406
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:12,978
There are pathways in this world

407
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,015
far beyond your imagination.

408
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,051
- It's just a game, right?

409
00:30:20,487 --> 00:30:22,724
- I can assure you it's no game.

410
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:27,627
Have you ever lost someone
you wish you could have had

411
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:29,662
a few more moments with,

412
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:32,030
wish you could speak
to one last time,

413
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,768
a family member perhaps?

414
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,870
- I guess.

415
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:41,175
We all have someone we wish
we could talk to again.

416
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:48,213
- Some of the boards
even provide a pathway

417
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:50,616
to righting what's wrong.

418
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:55,020
Karma exists, and
so does vengeance.

419
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,927
- Look, I appreciate
you helping me out,

420
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,997
but it's getting late,
and I just wanna go home.

421
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:07,332
- Oh, suit yourself.

422
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:11,036
I certainly hope you
get home safe this time.

423
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,551
- What do we have to do?

424
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:29,555
- This board belonged to
a very powerful witch,

425
00:31:29,557 --> 00:31:33,160
one who was murdered for
crimes she didn't commit.

426
00:31:34,796 --> 00:31:38,265
Her sorrow and pain loom heavy.

427
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,670
But she requires a sacrifice.

428
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:45,973
- What kind of sacrifice?

429
00:31:47,174 --> 00:31:48,407
- Your blood.

430
00:31:53,447 --> 00:31:54,913
- What the hell?

431
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:55,717
- Sit.

432
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,351
Sarah, I said sit.

433
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:09,930
You'll have to repeat
after me, understand?

434
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:12,299
- Yes.

435
00:32:14,636 --> 00:32:19,104
- I summon the spirit
attached to this board.

436
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:22,809
- I summon the spirit
attached to this board.

437
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:25,977
- A woman wronged,
a woman betrayed,

438
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:28,980
a woman with vengeance
in her heart.

439
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:32,484
- A woman wronged,
a woman betrayed,

440
00:32:32,486 --> 00:32:34,889
a woman with vengeance
in her heart.

441
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:39,391
- Talk to her, Sarah.

442
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:42,062
Ask her if she's here.
Tell her what you want.

443
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:45,230
- Hello, spirit.

444
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,536
Are you here with us right now?

445
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,875
What is your name?

446
00:33:00,347 --> 00:33:01,747
M.

447
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:04,519
A.

448
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,355
R.

449
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:13,826
Y.

450
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:21,901
Is this Mary Blackwood?

451
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,409
- Keep on going, Sarah.
You can't go back now.

452
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:34,680
- I want the men who
attacked me tonight

453
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:36,684
to know the pain that I felt,

454
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:42,422
to feel frightened,
hopeless, vulnerable.

455
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,326
Can you help me.

456
00:34:07,715 --> 00:34:09,615
- Run along, Sarah.

457
00:34:09,617 --> 00:34:11,753
The door has
already been opened.

458
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:43,504
- Hey, beautiful.
You need some help?

459
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:46,072
- Yes.

460
00:36:46,074 --> 00:36:47,207
I would love your help.

461
00:36:53,915 --> 00:36:56,416
- So what do you have in mind?

462
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:33,087
- You killed him.

463
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:35,688
- What?

464
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,422
- You ran away.

465
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,861
- No, it wasn't like that.

466
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:44,462
- You left him alone to die.

467
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:46,031
- No!

468
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,099
No! Please!

469
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:47,935
- Shh.

470
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,077
Now go and find peace.

471
00:39:33,307 --> 00:39:35,375
- Sarah.

472
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,506
- You can catch flies
with that thing.

473
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:09,742
- Sorry. Didn't get
much sleep last night.

474
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,577
- How'd the rest
of your night go?

475
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,611
- It was fine.

476
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,115
Went home, took a bath.

477
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:17,883
Liz, you've known
my mom for a while.

478
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,151
- Yeah.

479
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:21,155
Yeah, since I was a kid.
She used to babysit me.

480
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:25,793
- You know about
what happened to her?

481
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:30,763
- I know what people have
said happened to her.

482
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:33,801
- Did she ever talk to you
about that night at Laura's?

483
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,535
- No, sweetie.

484
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:39,040
She didn't really talk to
anybody after that night.

485
00:40:46,479 --> 00:40:48,847
- Do you know anything
about Mary Blackwood?

486
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:51,517
- Yeah.

487
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,688
I mean, I know what's
in the museums.

488
00:40:54,655 --> 00:40:56,322
Her husband was cheating on her,

489
00:40:56,324 --> 00:41:00,592
and when she found out, he
accused her of being a witch.

490
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:01,860
She was hanged on
that large tree

491
00:41:01,862 --> 00:41:04,464
that's still in the
street, and then burned.

492
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:08,202
Her husband then married
his mistress a month later.

493
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:11,303
You know, the worst part of it

494
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,507
is that she had three daughters,

495
00:41:14,642 --> 00:41:16,377
forced to grow up
without their mother.

496
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:21,882
- Do you believe the
stories about her?

497
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:26,187
- I mean, it depends on what
stories you're talking about.

498
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:30,322
Do I think that she
practiced witchcraft?

499
00:41:30,324 --> 00:41:31,523
Maybe.

500
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:33,759
They said that she
had this spirit board

501
00:41:33,761 --> 00:41:37,262
she used to communicate with
the energies of the earth.

502
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:40,065
But do I think that she's gonna
come back every couple years

503
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,134
to seek revenge on this town?

504
00:41:42,136 --> 00:41:42,970
I don't know.

505
00:41:44,438 --> 00:41:48,941
Look, I knew your mother
very well before that night.

506
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:53,612
And after that night, she was
a completely different person.

507
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:57,318
She saw something
that messed her up.

508
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:03,389
- Her therapist thinks
it was all in her head,

509
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,290
that Tim and Laura
killed themselves

510
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,326
after a fight about him cheating

511
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:10,064
and mom went into
shock finding them.

512
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:13,532
- Hm.

513
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:17,603
That's certainly a less
complicated explanation.

514
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:19,204
Sure.

515
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:21,409
But if you talk to some
people in this town,

516
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,877
they'll tell you
that Mary Blackwood

517
00:42:24,879 --> 00:42:29,114
has some kind of secret,
underground cult of witches

518
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:31,083
that still worship her,

519
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:34,887
helping her haunt this
town for eternity.

520
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,022
Boo!

521
00:42:39,026 --> 00:42:40,559
Should see your face.

522
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:41,794
- I'm gonna go check stock.

523
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:42,897
- Okay.

524
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,053
- Sarah?

525
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,222
Hey, Sarah!

526
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:41,822
- Derek.

527
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:48,994
- Jesus!

528
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:50,597
- Sorry, man.

529
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:51,832
- Did you follow me here?

530
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:55,169
- You weren't answering
my calls or texts.

531
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:59,673
- Yeah, for a reason.
Goodbye, Asher.

532
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,144
- So I'll see you
home later on tonight.

533
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:06,213
- I'm not coming back.

534
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:08,280
I got a new place to crash

535
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:09,984
until I find something
more permanent.

536
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:14,186
- Please, just...

537
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:15,320
Just talk to me, Derek!

538
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:17,124
I mean, you're my best friend.

539
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:20,959
- We're not friends. Asher.

540
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,363
We haven't been for a while.

541
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:25,567
We're just two people
that grew up together.

542
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,200
- Look, I told
them not to do it.

543
00:44:28,202 --> 00:44:29,935
I tried to get 'em to stop.

544
00:44:29,937 --> 00:44:30,903
- You could have killed her.

545
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:33,542
- But we didn't! She's fine!

546
00:44:34,408 --> 00:44:35,774
- How do you know that?

547
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:37,376
- I went to the
bar earlier today,

548
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:40,445
looked in the window,
and she was fine,

549
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:42,349
so no harm, no foul.

550
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:45,853
- If that helps you
sleep better at night.

551
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,257
- You know I just want
them to accept me,

552
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:52,860
like I was one of
the other guys.

553
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:57,632
- Why, Asher? Who
the fuck cares?

554
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:00,232
Be you.

555
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:03,670
Because whoever you're trying
to be, I don't like it, man.

556
00:45:03,672 --> 00:45:06,575
I was always your
friend, no matter what.

557
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:09,374
- Please, Derek.

558
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,545
Hey, I'm so sorry.

559
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:14,079
You gotta forgive me, man.

560
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:16,549
- Try forgiveness
with someone else.

561
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:18,217
I'm done.

562
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,053
- Hey.

563
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,187
Derek.

564
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:42,577
- So is that wedding
ring attached for good,

565
00:45:43,744 --> 00:45:47,547
or does it come off
for special occasions?

566
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:49,348
- Well, I guess that
depends on who's asking.

567
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,558
- Derek!

568
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:58,824
Hi!

569
00:45:58,826 --> 00:46:01,026
How are you tonight, hot stuff.

570
00:46:01,028 --> 00:46:02,160
- Hi, Louise. Thanks.

571
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,863
- Oh my God, you smell so good.

572
00:46:04,865 --> 00:46:06,431
Are you wearing Prada?

573
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:08,233
- I'm not wearing anything.

574
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,638
- So it must be
your natural musk.

575
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,205
Yum.

576
00:46:13,207 --> 00:46:15,575
Hey, you should buy me a drink.

577
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,177
- Maybe later, Louise.

578
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:24,016
Listen, can we talk
about last night?

579
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:24,852
- I'm working.

580
00:46:26,521 --> 00:46:28,453
- I'll wait till
you're done then.

581
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:29,290
- Whatever.

582
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:31,056
- Hi.

583
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:32,126
- Hm.

584
00:46:34,295 --> 00:46:35,129
- Another round?

585
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:39,033
- You better make it a double.

586
00:46:40,301 --> 00:46:42,367
- You all need to find Jesus.

587
00:47:43,765 --> 00:47:44,599
- Hello?

588
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,382
- Asher.

589
00:48:03,818 --> 00:48:04,652
Asher.

590
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:08,889
Asher.

591
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:12,426
Asher.

592
00:48:13,528 --> 00:48:14,861
- Jesus!

593
00:48:14,863 --> 00:48:16,261
- Not quite.

594
00:48:24,773 --> 00:48:28,641
- Yeah, I think she could
use a drink.

595
00:48:28,643 --> 00:48:29,778
Stupid bitch.

596
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:34,980
- Help.

597
00:48:34,982 --> 00:48:36,014
Someone.

598
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:37,284
Please help me.

599
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,487
- Are you frightened?

600
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:44,191
- I'm sorry.

601
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:46,759
I'm so sorry.

602
00:48:59,039 --> 00:48:59,874
Asher.

603
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:25,999
- Hey, you okay?

604
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:28,101
Sit down.

605
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:22,222
Please, God, I don't wanna die.

606
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,991
- God?

607
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:26,559
No.

608
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:27,394
No God.

609
00:50:28,663 --> 00:50:29,831
And no heaven.

610
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:32,901
There's only rot!

611
00:50:39,007 --> 00:50:39,807
- Sarah?

612
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:42,407
- Are you okay?

613
00:50:42,409 --> 00:50:45,043
- Seriously, I'm fine.
I just got dizzy.

614
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:47,112
- You shouldn't be on your feet.

615
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,280
- I'm okay.

616
00:50:48,282 --> 00:50:50,348
- Sarah, it's a slow night.

617
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,554
You could take the rest
of it off if you want.

618
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:55,053
- Are you sure?

619
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,121
- Of course.

620
00:50:56,123 --> 00:50:57,457
Go home, get some rest.

621
00:50:59,994 --> 00:51:01,192
- Maybe you're right.

622
00:51:01,194 --> 00:51:03,063
- Come on. I can walk you home.

623
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,348
Look, are you sure you don't
need a doctor or something?

624
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,118
- Why would I need
a doctor, Derek.

625
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:28,255
- Sarah...

626
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:31,456
You were right about them.

627
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,928
I don't need them as
friends, any of them.

628
00:51:37,765 --> 00:51:39,266
Whatever you need, I'll do it.

629
00:51:40,668 --> 00:51:42,635
If you want me to go to the
cops, I'll tell them everything.

630
00:51:42,637 --> 00:51:44,169
- No. No cops.

631
00:51:44,171 --> 00:51:46,206
I don't want anything
like that involved.

632
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:50,175
- What do you want me to do?

633
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:51,278
- Stay away from them.

634
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,313
Keep yourself safe.

635
00:51:54,682 --> 00:51:56,214
- And what about you?

636
00:51:56,216 --> 00:51:57,652
- I can take care of myself.

637
00:51:59,353 --> 00:52:00,922
- Look, I know you can.

638
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,259
I like a girl who can
take care of yourself.

639
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:10,596
- Well then I've got
the perfect one for you.

640
00:52:10,598 --> 00:52:11,964
- Yeah?

641
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:12,900
Who's that?

642
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,341
I really didn't
need to see that.

643
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,278
- I bet she Frenches
on the first date.

644
00:52:26,446 --> 00:52:28,246
- Still haven't forgot
about that have you?

645
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,149
- Not a chance.

646
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:33,588
- She looks all right.

647
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,390
I tell ya, man, last
night I thought she was-

648
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:41,027
- Yeah, I know, Caleb.

649
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:45,633
- You think she's
gonna go to the cops?

650
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,668
- I don't know.

651
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,771
I feel like if she was, she
would've done it already.

652
00:52:51,773 --> 00:52:53,741
Still, though, we
need to make sure.

653
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:58,410
- What you mean, "make sure"?

654
00:52:58,412 --> 00:52:59,547
- I'm gonna follow her,

655
00:53:00,715 --> 00:53:02,249
put a little fright
in her, you know?

656
00:53:03,117 --> 00:53:04,215
- No. Nah, man, fuck that.

657
00:53:04,217 --> 00:53:05,518
No. Count me out, dude.

658
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,451
- Excuse me?

659
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:08,154
- No, Isaac, I'm serious, man.

660
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:10,455
Look, I'm getting tired
of this shit, all right?

661
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:12,357
I've got too much good
going in my life right now

662
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,026
just to fuck it up for your ego.

663
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:15,728
- Hey, she insulted all of us!

664
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,664
You damn right she did,
and we kind of deserved it!

665
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:20,533
What the fuck you
got to prove, man?

666
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:21,767
Huh?

667
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,836
We're not in high
school anymore.

668
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:26,140
Life has stakes now,
fuckin' consequences.

669
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:29,975
- Damn it.

670
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,111
No, you're right.

671
00:53:32,113 --> 00:53:33,614
You're right, it does.

672
00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:37,083
Let's not do anything.
Let's just go home.

673
00:53:37,085 --> 00:53:38,718
All right? We'll wait.

674
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,886
Wait for her to tell somebody.

675
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,253
Then what's gonna happen, huh?

676
00:53:42,255 --> 00:53:43,923
What do you think?

677
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:45,191
You remember how every night

678
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:46,792
your dad used to beat
this shit outta you,

679
00:53:46,794 --> 00:53:48,293
and I was the one,
hey, listen to me,

680
00:53:48,295 --> 00:53:51,530
I was the one who snuck you
into my house to protect you.

681
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,632
- That's what we're doing? Okay.

682
00:53:53,634 --> 00:53:55,233
You were there for
me. You protected me.

683
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:57,138
I remember that. Yes, I get it.

684
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,606
- Who's gonna protect your
when I'm behind bars, huh?

685
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,449
- Look, man, just leave
the girl alone, all right?

686
00:54:10,484 --> 00:54:12,350
The shit's over with, man.

687
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:14,587
We should have never fucked
with her to begin with.

688
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:15,422
- You kidding me?

689
00:54:16,624 --> 00:54:18,791
What, you just wanna
walk away now, huh?

690
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:20,762
No, no, we're already in this.

691
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:24,462
Hey, look, if I get one
more charge against me,

692
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:26,397
just one, it is over for me,

693
00:54:26,399 --> 00:54:28,167
and it'll sure as shit
be over for you too.

694
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:29,400
- Fuck that.

695
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:30,337
- No, no, you look at me.

696
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:36,309
I am not gonna let that
little bitch ruin our lives.

697
00:54:37,912 --> 00:54:38,746
Okay?

698
00:54:39,614 --> 00:54:40,445
Get your head in the game.

699
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:32,133
- Who are you?

700
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:18,779
- Asher.

701
00:57:09,964 --> 00:57:11,299
A woman wronged.

702
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:15,336
A woman betrayed.

703
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:19,472
A woman with vengeance

704
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:25,911
in her heart.

705
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:53,007
- Bad dream?

706
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,108
- Mom?

707
00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:00,079
- Sarah, when you
came back here,

708
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:01,513
I thought that we
had an agreement

709
00:58:01,515 --> 00:58:03,415
that we were gonna be
honest with each other

710
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:04,352
about everything.

711
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:07,722
- What are you talking about?

712
00:58:09,256 --> 00:58:11,659
- I just got off the phone
with your stepmother.

713
00:58:15,029 --> 00:58:16,762
- I told you not to call her.

714
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:17,598
- I didn't.

715
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:19,600
She called me.

716
00:58:20,968 --> 00:58:23,335
You had a letter
sent to her place

717
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:25,204
about a court date next month?

718
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:27,806
- That letter is
none of her business.

719
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,176
- No, but it's mine.

720
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:34,815
Breaking and entering?
Destruction of private property?

721
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:40,486
Sarah, were you using again?

722
00:58:40,488 --> 00:58:43,422
- God, mom, no! It
wasn't that dramatic.

723
00:58:43,424 --> 00:58:44,723
Dad and Lydia were fighting,

724
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:47,092
and I just didn't
wanna be around it.

725
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:50,729
I thought it was abandoned.
Turns out I was wrong.

726
00:58:50,731 --> 00:58:52,164
- Well, when were
you gonna tell me?

727
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,833
I mean, what, you thought
I wouldn't find out?

728
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,602
- Yeah, kind of.
That was the idea.

729
00:58:56,604 --> 00:58:58,205
I didn't want you to overreact.

730
00:58:59,407 --> 00:59:02,541
- And she told me
that...

731
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:04,211
you were stealing from her.

732
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:07,913
- Gimme a break! That woman
leached off of dad for years.

733
00:59:07,915 --> 00:59:10,418
I just borrowed a couple
bucks for the subway.

734
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:14,286
- Oh my God, Sarah.

735
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:15,423
What happened to you?

736
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:18,325
You were my little girl.

737
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:21,860
- Come off it, mom.

738
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,128
You were never
there as a parent,

739
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,797
and I was never
your little girl.

740
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,766
You were always too obsessed
with her to even notice me.

741
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:29,904
- With who?

742
00:59:31,906 --> 00:59:32,905
- Mary Blackwood.

743
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:34,740
- Stop it.

744
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:35,574
Don't say-

745
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,042
- Why?

746
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:39,044
Why were you so afraid that
she'd come back for you?

747
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:42,515
Do you know how to stop her?
Is there a way to stop her?

748
00:59:42,517 --> 00:59:44,983
- Mary Blackwood is dead.

749
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:46,485
She's been dead for centuries.

750
00:59:46,487 --> 00:59:48,055
I know she's not real now.

751
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:51,592
Tim and Laura killed themselves.

752
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:54,927
I know I should have
listened to your father

753
00:59:54,929 --> 00:59:56,563
and gotten therapy,
and I'm sorry

754
00:59:56,565 --> 00:59:58,797
if this affected the way
I've raised you for so long,

755
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:02,134
but that's over now.

756
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:03,402
She's not coming back.

757
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:08,309
- But what if she did?

758
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:12,746
What if she did come
back, but not for you?

759
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:17,783
- What do
you mean by that?

760
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:19,751
- I have to go.

761
01:00:19,753 --> 01:00:20,986
- Sarah, wait a minute!

762
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:23,188
Sarah, please tell
me you're not saying

763
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:26,091
what I think you're
saying.

764
01:00:26,093 --> 01:00:28,127
- I'm sorry I
never believed you.

765
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:30,331
I don't wanna drag you
back into this again!

766
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:35,934
Derek?

767
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:36,804
What the hell?

768
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:39,240
What's wrong?

769
01:00:41,775 --> 01:00:43,377
- I didn't know
where else to go.

770
01:00:44,513 --> 01:00:45,446
- What happened?

771
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:48,583
- It's Asher.

772
01:00:49,551 --> 01:00:50,351
He's dead.

773
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:54,853
- What?

774
01:00:54,855 --> 01:00:56,155
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have come here,

775
01:00:56,157 --> 01:00:57,389
not after what they did.
- No, Derek, wait!

776
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:58,425
What happened to him?

777
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:01,395
- They think it was a suicide.

778
01:01:04,298 --> 01:01:05,600
- I saw Asher.

779
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,235
I saw him in my dream.

780
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:10,572
- What are you talking about?

781
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:14,475
- Derek, I don't think
he killed himself.

782
01:01:22,683 --> 01:01:23,518
- Another!

783
01:01:27,922 --> 01:01:30,057
- Do you really think that's
a good idea right now?

784
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,458
- My little brother is dead.

785
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,430
You have a better idea of what
I should be doing right now?

786
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:46,271
- Hey.

787
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:47,041
Take it easy.

788
01:01:52,913 --> 01:01:55,480
- When I woke up, I
thought it was a dream.

789
01:01:55,482 --> 01:01:59,753
It felt so real,
but it couldn't be.

790
01:02:01,188 --> 01:02:03,722
- You think that you conjured
the spirit of Mary Blackwood

791
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:04,990
and now she's trying
to kill everyone

792
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:05,924
that attacked you that night?

793
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:07,326
- Look, I know I sound crazy.

794
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:10,796
I know I sound like my mother.

795
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:12,030
- No.

796
01:02:12,032 --> 01:02:16,536
- But the dream I had
last night was so real.

797
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:21,543
And if I'm right,
you're in danger too.

798
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:25,714
- Why would you say that?

799
01:02:30,384 --> 01:02:33,454
- I saw you last
night in my dream.

800
01:02:36,223 --> 01:02:37,057
Dead.

801
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:40,294
You were hanging from a noose.

802
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:45,230
You don't believe me, do you?

803
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:46,066
- No, no.

804
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:48,502
I do.

805
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:51,872
- Really?

806
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:53,774
- Yeah.

807
01:02:55,409 --> 01:03:00,381
I had the same dream of being
hanged, and it felt so real.

808
01:03:03,917 --> 01:03:06,051
I woke up and I
was still in pain,

809
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:08,420
and I looked in the
mirror and I saw this.

810
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,523
- Oh my God.

811
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:11,458
- It still burns.

812
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:15,894
- We have to stop her, then,

813
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,565
before she can kill anyone else.

814
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,198
- How do we do that?

815
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,001
- I wanna go back to that
shop where I met that woman.

816
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:24,369
She told me the door was open.

817
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:25,973
Maybe she knows how to close it.

818
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:28,743
- Okay.

819
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:37,215
- Come on!

820
01:03:39,253 --> 01:03:40,485
Damn it!

821
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:42,854
- Are you sure this
is the right shop?

822
01:03:42,856 --> 01:03:44,089
I mean, the place you described

823
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:45,891
is kind of dime a
dozen in this town.

824
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:47,292
- It was here, I swear!

825
01:03:47,294 --> 01:03:48,493
She took me into the back room

826
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:50,697
and made me touch the board.

827
01:03:50,699 --> 01:03:52,197
- Well, if we can't
find the board,

828
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:54,068
then we're gonna have to
come up with another plan.

829
01:03:55,869 --> 01:03:57,869
- We have to warn
Isaac and Caleb.

830
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:00,542
She's gonna go after them just
like she went after Asher.

831
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:05,010
- I always thought
you were cute.

832
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:07,946
I loved watching you play
football on Friday nights

833
01:04:07,948 --> 01:04:09,881
and tackling all the tight ends.

834
01:04:09,883 --> 01:04:10,719
- Is that so?

835
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:15,588
- It is so.

836
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,888
Hey, Caleb.

837
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,290
- Caleb!

838
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:20,660
- Pull up a chair.
I'll buy a drink.

839
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:21,927
- No, no, no, man.

840
01:04:21,929 --> 01:04:22,928
Let's go on and get
you home, all right?

841
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:23,995
It's been a long day for you.

842
01:04:23,997 --> 01:04:25,698
- Oh, fuck that.

843
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:28,066
Me and Louise were just
getting reacquainted.

844
01:04:29,269 --> 01:04:31,203
- Yeah? Well, say
goodnight, all right?

845
01:04:31,205 --> 01:04:32,404
Come on, man. I'll call you cab.

846
01:04:32,406 --> 01:04:35,376
- I'll call you a
cock sucker.

847
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:40,045
She tell you to come get me?

848
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:40,979
- Come on, Isaac.
Don't start that.

849
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,715
- No, fuck all of you!

850
01:04:42,717 --> 01:04:43,583
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

851
01:04:43,585 --> 01:04:44,786
Isaac, calm down, man.

852
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:48,954
Listen.

853
01:04:48,956 --> 01:04:50,623
Asher was a good kid, all right?

854
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,257
We all know that.

855
01:04:52,259 --> 01:04:53,526
But there was no way
you could have known

856
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:55,561
he would do something
like this, all right?

857
01:04:55,563 --> 01:04:59,032
- You really believe
that suicide bullshit?

858
01:04:59,933 --> 01:05:02,501
Yeah right.

859
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:03,435
- All right, Isaac.

860
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:04,839
So what else was it then, man?

861
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:07,809
- I tell you what it was.

862
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:11,076
It was that bitch Sarah.

863
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,681
She's a nut just like
that mother of hers.

864
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:17,351
I'm telling you, she's after us.

865
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:20,185
- What the fuck, man?

866
01:05:20,187 --> 01:05:21,353
- What the fuck
is going on here?

867
01:05:21,355 --> 01:05:22,622
Are you fucking
hearing yourself, man?

868
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:25,190
You know what? Go
on your own trip.

869
01:05:25,192 --> 01:05:26,425
I'm through with this shit, man.

870
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:28,095
Through with you and
your fucking ego!

871
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,097
- You know what?

872
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,601
I think I will get outta here.

873
01:05:34,702 --> 01:05:35,770
I'm gonna find Sarah.

874
01:05:36,805 --> 01:05:37,737
End this now.

875
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:38,571
- Hey, Isaac, come on, man.

876
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:40,105
- Hey!

877
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,341
- Come on, man!

878
01:05:46,815 --> 01:05:48,550
- I'll see you later.

879
01:05:50,852 --> 01:05:51,753
- Whatever.

880
01:05:54,689 --> 01:05:56,823
- I'm glad you're here.

881
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:02,664
- Caleb.

882
01:06:06,099 --> 01:06:07,434
- Do I know you?

883
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:09,704
- Perhaps.

884
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:43,303
- Show off.

885
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:18,004
- Stomp that bitch,
Isaac. Yeah.

886
01:07:18,006 --> 01:07:19,070
Uh-huh.

887
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:20,438
You can't fuck with us!

888
01:07:25,947 --> 01:07:27,312
What the fuck?

889
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,249
- Do you feel hopeless?

890
01:07:56,044 --> 01:07:57,275
- Hey!

891
01:07:57,277 --> 01:07:58,813
Hold it right there,
you psycho bitch!

892
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:03,616
No one kills my customers!

893
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:04,451
- Why?

894
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:08,155
When he would leave you to
die if given the opportunity.

895
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:12,625
- What the fuck?

896
01:08:24,973 --> 01:08:26,074
- Stand.

897
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:36,618
Men have hurt and
taken advantage of
you your entire life.

898
01:08:37,518 --> 01:08:39,386
Do not numb the pain any longer.

899
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,558
Take back control of yourself.

900
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:10,818
- We're too late.

901
01:09:18,258 --> 01:09:19,091
- Liz!

902
01:09:19,927 --> 01:09:20,960
- Sarah.

903
01:09:20,962 --> 01:09:22,227
Hey.

904
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:23,064
- Don't move.

905
01:09:26,668 --> 01:09:28,233
- What happened?

906
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:29,537
- The stories.

907
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:31,304
They're true.

908
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:34,006
Viola was right.

909
01:09:34,008 --> 01:09:35,977
Mary Blackwood is real.

910
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:39,945
She's one tough bitch.

911
01:09:39,947 --> 01:09:41,149
- Call her an ambulance.

912
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:44,482
- What are we gonna
do about the witch?

913
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:45,751
- We're gonna get that board

914
01:09:45,753 --> 01:09:47,318
and send that god
damn witch back

915
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,622
to whatever hell she came from.

916
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:50,625
- How do we do that?

917
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:55,094
- I have a pretty good idea.

918
01:10:05,073 --> 01:10:09,108
- What the hell?

919
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:19,520
Hey, it's you.

920
01:10:25,325 --> 01:10:26,160
You lost?

921
01:10:27,595 --> 01:10:30,031
You need me to take you home?

922
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:32,967
- I am home.

923
01:10:40,174 --> 01:10:41,374
- You sure you live here?

924
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:44,212
- Come.

925
01:10:55,690 --> 01:11:00,628
Join me.

926
01:11:01,495 --> 01:11:02,496
- Don't have to tell me twice.

927
01:11:33,561 --> 01:11:36,463
You forget to pay
the heating bill?

928
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:41,569
This isn't your house, isn't it?

929
01:11:43,503 --> 01:11:45,239
- It shall be our house.

930
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:47,975
Together.

931
01:12:01,923 --> 01:12:06,561
- You like that, you
fucking bitch?

932
01:12:58,813 --> 01:13:00,348
- Where did you go?

933
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:10,291
All right.

934
01:13:20,735 --> 01:13:22,502
You are so beautiful.

935
01:13:29,377 --> 01:13:30,609
- Disrobe.

936
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:31,444
- Yes, ma'am.

937
01:13:40,388 --> 01:13:42,890
Okay, I can get into this.

938
01:13:49,563 --> 01:13:50,398
- Oh no!

939
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,166
No!

940
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:54,800
Sarah!

941
01:13:54,802 --> 01:13:56,535
God. Oh my God, Liz!

942
01:13:56,537 --> 01:13:57,369
Oh my god.

943
01:13:57,371 --> 01:13:58,871
Oh my God, she was here!

944
01:13:58,873 --> 01:13:59,772
She was here, wasn't she?

945
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:00,775
- Mary Blackwood.

946
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:03,742
- Where's Sarah?

947
01:14:03,744 --> 01:14:05,544
- She went to get
the Ouija board.

948
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:06,847
She's trying to stop her.

949
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:39,745
- Are you vulnerable?

950
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:45,417
- What?

951
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:49,323
No! No!

952
01:14:54,729 --> 01:14:56,464
- Don't get soft now.

953
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:30,231
- What the hell is
Isaac doing here?

954
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:34,201
- We might be too late for him.

955
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:45,913
- Sarah, wait.

956
01:16:03,532 --> 01:16:04,365
Isaac!

957
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:08,936
Are you in here?

958
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:05,594
Oh, God.

959
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:08,530
Isaac.

960
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,264
- Derek.

961
01:17:11,665 --> 01:17:13,067
- Let's just find the board.

962
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:15,703
- In my dream it
was in the attic.

963
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,181
What's wrong?

964
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:01,982
- I'm fine.

965
01:18:05,252 --> 01:18:06,586
- No, you're not!

966
01:18:06,588 --> 01:18:08,055
It's definitely in this room.

967
01:18:15,262 --> 01:18:16,063
It's over here.

968
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:32,446
She's close. We have to hurry.

969
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:48,727
- You ready?

970
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:49,564
- Not at all.

971
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:51,600
Let's do it.

972
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:00,339
- Mom?

973
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:02,407
- What are you doing
in here, Sarah?

974
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:03,976
- I have to stop her!

975
01:19:03,978 --> 01:19:05,944
- We can't be in here, baby.

976
01:19:05,946 --> 01:19:07,446
I can't be in here.

977
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:10,782
- I have to send her back
before she comes for Derek!

978
01:19:10,784 --> 01:19:12,453
- What do you mean
send her back?

979
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:15,354
What did you do, Sarah?

980
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:17,189
- I brought back Mary Blackwood!

981
01:19:17,191 --> 01:19:18,558
All these years, you were right!

982
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:20,425
We should have believed you.

983
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:21,893
- Well, real or not,

984
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:24,999
I should never have let her
control my life the way she did.

985
01:19:26,267 --> 01:19:27,099
- Then help me.

986
01:19:27,101 --> 01:19:28,769
- I don't know if I can.

987
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,371
- I opened the door. You
can help me close it.

988
01:19:32,373 --> 01:19:34,172
- That's not the way it works.

989
01:19:34,174 --> 01:19:36,875
You don't think she's
gonna stop with Derek.

990
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:40,546
Once she does your
bidding, she comes for you.

991
01:19:40,548 --> 01:19:42,916
You only close the
door when you die.

992
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:45,484
- What?

993
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:47,386
- Yeah, that's what
happened to Laura.

994
01:19:47,388 --> 01:19:49,656
- We can still talk to
her, bargain with her.

995
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:51,189
I need you to help me.

996
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:53,892
- You can't bargain
with Mary Blackwood.

997
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,360
She's pure evil.

998
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:58,533
- Mom, please. We have to try.

999
01:20:00,702 --> 01:20:01,869
- You're right.

1000
01:20:04,171 --> 01:20:05,540
This ends tonight.

1001
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:11,943
I summon the spirit
attached to this board,

1002
01:20:11,945 --> 01:20:16,516
a woman scorned,
a woman betrayed,

1003
01:20:16,518 --> 01:20:19,384
a woman with vengeance
in her heart.

1004
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:20,687
Mary Blackwood,

1005
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:23,955
my daughter brought you
back from the afterlife,

1006
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:25,727
but she left the door open.

1007
01:20:26,894 --> 01:20:31,566
I command you to close
the door and leave!

1008
01:20:33,735 --> 01:20:35,069
What do you want?

1009
01:20:36,671 --> 01:20:37,504
- H.

1010
01:20:38,673 --> 01:20:39,473
E.

1011
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:41,842
R.

1012
01:20:43,377 --> 01:20:44,178
B.

1013
01:20:45,112 --> 01:20:45,913
L.

1014
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:50,248
Her blood.

1015
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,350
- We should stop.

1016
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:54,152
- No. We have to keep going.

1017
01:20:55,757 --> 01:20:58,457
Mary Blackwood, will you
take the blood of another?

1018
01:20:59,426 --> 01:21:01,694
- Mom, what are you doing?

1019
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,198
- It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1020
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:05,964
Don't worry.

1021
01:21:05,966 --> 01:21:07,734
Will you take my blood?

1022
01:21:09,236 --> 01:21:10,369
- Mom, no!

1023
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:19,213
Mary Blackwood, I know
you were innocent.

1024
01:21:20,047 --> 01:21:21,315
I know you're angry.

1025
01:21:22,684 --> 01:21:24,985
I want you to be free.

1026
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:29,388
Let go of the anger, Mary.

1027
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,825
Leave this realm.

1028
01:21:31,826 --> 01:21:33,091
- Derek.

1029
01:21:33,093 --> 01:21:36,029
- Don't cause anyone
else any more pain.

1030
01:21:37,766 --> 01:21:42,635
Don't cause my mother
the pain you felt

1031
01:21:42,637 --> 01:21:44,839
when you were taken
from your children.

1032
01:21:46,541 --> 01:21:48,240
Close the door!

1033
01:21:55,015 --> 01:21:56,783
Is she gone?

1034
01:21:56,785 --> 01:21:57,552
- She's gone.

1035
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,620
You've made her close the door.

1036
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:01,523
You did it!

1037
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:05,525
- I knew you could do it.

1038
01:22:25,747 --> 01:22:27,515
- Your blood is next.

1039
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,435
You have been avenged, Sarah.

1040
01:22:50,037 --> 01:22:50,872
Join me

1041
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,941
for eternity.

1042
01:22:54,943 --> 01:22:59,779
- Mary, get your
hands off my daughter!

1043
01:22:59,781 --> 01:23:00,949
- It's too late.

1044
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,951
No more games.

1045
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:24,837
- Burn in hell, witch!

1046
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:44,959
- Derek!

1047
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,225
- Honey, honey, don't look.

1048
01:23:47,227 --> 01:23:49,029
Let's just get you
outta here, okay?

1049
01:23:51,866 --> 01:23:54,332
- You were gonna
sacrifice yourself for me.

1050
01:23:54,334 --> 01:23:56,503
- Of course. I'm your mother.

1051
01:23:57,539 --> 01:23:58,740
I'd do anything for you.

1052
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:03,743
- The Ouija
board! It's gone!

1053
01:24:03,745 --> 01:24:05,847
- Oh, it's destroyed forever.

1054
01:24:06,814 --> 01:24:07,649
- Are you sure?

1055
01:24:11,218 --> 01:24:12,052
Mom?

1056
01:24:17,592 --> 01:24:19,027
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1057
01:25:23,524 --> 01:25:24,358
- Good evening.

1058
01:25:26,493 --> 01:25:27,629
How can I help you?
