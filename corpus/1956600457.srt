Hello neighbor.

17
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:26,729
So good to see you again today.

18
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,669
Did you see the...

19
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,916
What special thing
I brought in to show you?

20
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,549
It's called a picture board.

21
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:51,704
Because behind each one of these
little doors is a picture of people.

22
00:02:56,481 --> 00:02:58,542
Lady Aberlin.

23
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:04,470
Let's see
who's behind this door.

24
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,724
It's King Friday the thirteenth,

25
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,865
with his crown and

26
00:03:12,424 --> 00:03:15,160
mustache and beard.
Who's behind here?

27
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:18,078
It's Mister McFeely.

28
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:22,333
He always says "speedy delivery",
doesn't he?

29
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,502
I'd like you to meet
a new friend of mine.

30
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,859
His name is Lloyd Vogel.

31
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,864
Someone has hurt my friend Lloyd.

32
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,945
And not just on his face.

33
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:50,365
He is having a hard time
forgiving the person who hurt him.

34
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:00,911
Do you know
what that means, to forgive?

35
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,526
It's a decision we make

36
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:13,106
to release a person from the feelings
of anger we have at them.

37
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:19,382
It's strange, but sometimes

38
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:25,255
it's hardest of all
to forgive someone we love.

39
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:36,518
Let's go say hello
to my new friend Lloyd,

40
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:40,919
shall we?

41
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:15,695
♪ I never felt magic crazy as this ♪

42
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:21,469
♪ I never saw moons
knew the meaning of the sea ♪

43
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,749

47
00:05:43,904 --> 00:05:46,162
Here to present this year's
award for Feature Writing.

48
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:49,921
Please welcome
last year's winner Lloyd Vogel.

49
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:10,592
Thank you.

50
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:14,911
It's so wonderful to be among
so many of my fellow misfits tonight.

51
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:20,253
So, why do we write
for magazines for a living?

52
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:25,221
Honestly, because doing anything else
doesn't seem quite like living at all.

53
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,519
We get a front row seat to history.

54
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:32,591
We get to expose the truth
that others cannot see.

55
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,568
And sometimes, just sometimes,

56
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:41,273
we get to change a broken world
with our words.

57
00:07:03,515 --> 00:07:06,374
Thank you. I needed this.

58
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:08,852
I ate a block of cheese for dinner.

59
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,353
So, what are we forgetting?

60
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:13,797
We definitely need more diapers.

61
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:16,778
More than this?
We're going to Jersey for one night.

62
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:19,274
We go through at least
twelve a day.

63
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,904
We do?
What are you feeding that kid?

64
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,648
Wouldn't it be easier
if we left him with a sitter?

65
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:28,089
You know I'm not ready to leave him
with a stranger, okay?

66
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,487
He's too little.

67
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:30,932
Yeah.

68
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,746
Hey, your sister called last night.

69
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:36,770
She wanted to make sure
you'd written your toast.

70
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,496
Oh, I'm all set. I'm just gonna use
my speech from her first wedding.

71
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:42,512
- Or maybe from her second.
- Oh, yeah! Just change the names.

72
00:07:44,011 --> 00:07:46,475
And hey, she wanted
me to tell you something.

73
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,143
Okay...

74
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:55,528
Your father is coming.

75
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,615
I guess she reached out to him a couple
of months ago, and he didn't respond,

76
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:04,666
but, then he called,
and now he's coming to the wedding.

77
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,954
Are you okay?

78
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:14,030
Yeah! I'm fine.

79
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:19,812
But I don't think we should go.

80
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,076
- Lloyd!
- What?

81
00:08:21,076 --> 00:08:24,520
Seriously, why have a baby if you can't
use him to get out of social obligations?

82
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,035
This is what Lorraine was afraid of,
that you would back out.

83
00:08:27,035 --> 00:08:29,594
I'm kidding.
I'm not gonna miss her wedding.

84
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,139
I look forward to them every year.

85
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:33,812
Okay.

86
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:39,427
I think it'll be nice for Gavin
to meet his grandfather.

87
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:42,527
Sure.

88
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,540
Dammit!

89
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,901
Daddy's just being funny.
Daddy's being funny.

90
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:02,520
That's impossible.

91
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:05,569
Here. Take him. Here.

92
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:18,790
There.

93
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,485
Great.

94
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,814
He looks terrified.

95
00:09:36,814 --> 00:09:39,826
He should be.
He's marrying Lorraine.

96
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,855
Oh my God! You look beautiful.

97
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:12,448
Absolutely.

98
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,649
Well, I'm ten pounds short
of my target weight, but whatever.

99
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:16,722
Lloyd. The brother.

100
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:20,382
I know, man. I guess I'm Todd,
you know, the husband.

101
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:23,710
And look at you, ya little peanut.

102
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:27,350
I don't think we're having any kids.

103
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,069
How did that happen?

104
00:10:31,356 --> 00:10:33,195
I invited him and he came.

105
00:10:34,046 --> 00:10:36,346
To walk you down the aisle? Really?

106
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,486
He offered. He missed the first two,
I thought "why the hell not?".

107
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:41,147
I can think of a few reasons why.

108
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:44,767
He's old, and if he's gonna try
to make an effort...

109
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:51,696
Oh, I guess it's time
we get this started.

110
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:57,848
So, in lieu of the typical father of
the bride speech, I thought I'd...

111
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,885
Well, I'd like to sing a little ditty.

112
00:11:05,877 --> 00:11:09,989
This is for my Lorraine
and for you too...

113
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:13,573
And for Todd.

114
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:22,883
♪ I know I stand in line until you think you
have the time to spend an evening with me ♪

115
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:32,531
♪ And if we go some place to dance, I know that
there's a chance you won't be leaving with me ♪

116
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:40,757
♪ Then afterwards we drop into a quiet
little place and have a drink or two ♪

117
00:11:40,757 --> 00:11:43,408
Admit it.
Now you wish we hadn't eloped.

118
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:45,890
He's drunk.

119
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:49,851
Oh, well. He can sing.

Here we are.
In the pearl of the Garden State.

124
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,979
Hello, Jerry.

125
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:20,963
Oh, come on!
You don't have to call me Jerry.

126
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,355
Or call me Jerry.
I don't care.

127
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,030
And hello to you!

128
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,249
Hi, I'm Andrea. Lloyd's wife.

129
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:33,730
Andrea! Of course!

130
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:36,487
What a unique pleasure.

131
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,300
Hello, little fella.

132
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,675
This is Gavin.

133
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:42,606
What a handsome man!

134
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,452
You look just like me.

135
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,558
Let's get a drink?

136
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:54,028
What's this stuff? A pop?
This stuff will kill you.

137
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:57,442
I'm just giving my toast,
and then we're leaving, so...

138
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:04,214
Doll, could you give us a moment?

139
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:09,292
She's not a doll.
She's a public interest attorney.

140
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:11,147
Where the money in that?

141
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,436
You know what?
We're gonna circulate.

142
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:23,479
You got a baby. And a wife.

143
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,572
You happy?

144
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,219
I'm happy.

145
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:34,915
Well, she seems nice enough, but

146
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:38,498
I mean, aren't you a little old
to have a baby?

147
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,185
I'm not that old.

148
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,901
You're smart.

149
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:51,603
Your mom and I hardly knew
each other when she got pregnant.

150
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,149
We were babies.

151
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,305
Don't talk about her!

152
00:13:56,144 --> 00:13:58,526
Wait a minute.
You don't know the whole story.

153
00:13:58,526 --> 00:14:00,792
Your mom really was not the saint...

154
00:14:01,118 --> 00:14:03,577
Don't talk about my mom!

155
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,718
- Come on?
- Get off me!

156
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:12,654
What the hell?

157
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,316
You didn't hear him.

158
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,715
You were out of control.

159
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,177
He was out of control!

160
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:23,898
You just not gonna take
responsibility for any of this?

161
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:26,941
Of course, I am! I offered to
pay for Lorraine's dry cleaning.

162
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,160
Have you ever felt
the way Lloyd does?

163
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:50,967
So angry you want
to hurt someone?

164
00:14:51,634 --> 00:14:53,251
Or at yourself?

165
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,265
I know I have.

166
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,427
When I was a boy
I was very chubby.

167
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:11,358
And the other kids would chase me
and call me names, like "Fat Freddy".

168
00:15:12,235 --> 00:15:14,526
It made me very sad.

169
00:15:16,121 --> 00:15:20,717
Sometimes, when I was by myself,
I would cry.

170
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:26,996
And other times,
it made me very angry.

171
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:34,807
There is always something
you can do with the mad that you feel.

172
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,673
Did you hear that?

173
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:48,442
Someone is at my door.
Let's go see who it is.

174
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,092
It's Mr. McFeely.

175
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:56,759
Speedy delivery.

176
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:02,053
Look. It's a magazine.

177
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,024
Thank you.

178
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:07,688
Magazines are always
so full of interesting information.

179
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:09,065
They sure are.

180
00:16:09,065 --> 00:16:13,150
My friend Lloyd works for a magazine.
He's a very wonderful writer.

181
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,438
That reminds me.

182
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:18,946
I have a video I found, and I thought
you and your neighbor may like to see it.

183
00:16:18,946 --> 00:16:20,078
What is it?

184
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,382
It's about how people
make a magazine.

185
00:16:22,719 --> 00:16:25,340
It's called "How People Make a Magazine".

186
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,693
I know lots of people like magazines, so
I thought you might find this interesting.

187
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:32,576
I think we would, but do you have
time to show it to us now?

188
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,742
I'd be glad to see it again.

189
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:38,141
Let's look at it on Picture Picture.

190
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:45,214
We'll watch it on Picture Picture

191
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:51,630
and see how people
make a magazine.

192
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,778
Now, this is the ink they use in the
printing press that prints the magazines.

193
00:17:04,307 --> 00:17:07,845
Yellow ink. It looks like mustard.

194
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:14,134
And these are large rolls of blank paper,
that are getting loaded into the machine.

195
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:19,967
I wonder how many magazines they can make
out of one of those large rolls.

196
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:25,606
They print the magazines in giant sheets.
One color at a time.

197
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:35,489
This machine assembles the magazine,
and glues it all together.

198
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,630
Oh, now, who's this?

199
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:46,009
These are the people who decide
what will be in the magazine.

200
00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:48,929
They pick the pictures
and design the layout.

201
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:53,123
Oh, that's an important job.

202
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:57,319
And these are the people who write
the words that go into a magazine.

203
00:17:57,711 --> 00:18:01,468
It's a lot of work
to make a magazine, isn't it?

204
00:18:01,737 --> 00:18:03,974
It certainly is.

205
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,392
Yeah.

206
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:18,127
Pay no attention to my face. Softball injury.
Nothing to worry about. Good morning, Ellen.

207
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,945
How are you?

208
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,999
- This should be interesting.
- What should?

209
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:26,564
Sending you on an assignment
with your face all busted up.

210
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,667
- An assignment?
- Yep.

211
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:31,765
You're the perfect person for it.
You just had a baby.

212
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:33,447
Why are you giving me
an assignment?

213
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,251
We're doing an issue
on heroes, and we're

214
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:38,946
profiling a number of inspirational people.

215
00:18:38,946 --> 00:18:43,679
We just need a small piece of copy to
accompany a pretty photo.

216
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:48,618
You hired me as an investigative
journalist. I don't do puff pieces.

217
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:51,830
Wait a second, didn't I hire you
to do whatever I tell you to do?

218
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:56,391
And right now that's doing a profile
on one of our nation's heroes.

219
00:18:56,546 --> 00:18:57,958
Who?

220
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,331
Mister Rogers.

221
00:19:03,364 --> 00:19:04,854
As in the hokey kid's show guy?

222
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:08,165
As in the beloved
children's television host, yes.

223
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:15,053
Look, I think
this could help you, Lloyd.

224
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,658
Just, start to change your image.

225
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,783
I don't need to change my image.

226
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,325
Okay.

227
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,574
Ellen?

228
00:19:27,026 --> 00:19:31,363
He was the only person on our list
willing to be interviewed by you, Lloyd.

229
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:34,627
I guess you're developing a reputation.

230
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:36,929
A reputation? People love talking to me.

231
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:39,858
Yeah, they do. Until they read
what you write about them.

232
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,181
So what? I'm supposed to go easy
on this guy because he

233
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,463
plays with puppets for a living?

234
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,037
400 words. Play nice.

235
00:20:01,443 --> 00:20:03,774
Hello, this is Lloyd Vogel,
from Esquire Magazine.

236
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:08,542
I'm calling to schedule an interview
with Mister Rogers.

237
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:23,301
Sorry about your face.

238
00:20:25,328 --> 00:20:27,075
You know, I got it good too.

239
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,561
Look, I messed this up.

240
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,193
I just want to talk to you.

241
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:36,690
We have a lot that needs to be said.

242
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,059
No. I'm not gonna be ambushed.

243
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,169
Come on, Lloyd.

244
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,310
Hi, honey.

245
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:10,897
- Hi. Hi guys.
- Hi, Lloyd.

246
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,877
Smells in here.

247
00:21:13,153 --> 00:21:16,489
Bathroom trash.
Nine different types of diapers.

248
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,673
Hey, Lloyd.

249
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:29,624
I got it.

250
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:35,900
Hello?

251
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,381
Lloyd?

252
00:21:37,607 --> 00:21:38,683
Who's this?

253
00:21:39,374 --> 00:21:40,815
This is Fred Rogers.

254
00:21:41,263 --> 00:21:42,999
Hi. That was quick.

255
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:48,700
Well, I figured if you want to talk to me,
I should want to talk to you.

256
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:53,857
Yeah, I just wanted to set a time to sit
with you and ask you a few questions.

257
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:57,843
I'm happy to schedule something,
except for one thing.

258
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:59,151
What's that?

259
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:02,344
You have me here right now.

260
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:05,124
Okay. Sure.

261
00:22:08,373 --> 00:22:14,423
On our program, I try to look through the
camera into the eyes of a single child,

262
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:17,955
and speak to him,
or her, trying to be

263
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:22,582
fully present to their feelings
and their needs.

264
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,045
Right.

265
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:30,475
Do you know what the important thing
in the world is to me right now?

266
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,943
No.

267
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:36,396
Talking on the telephone
to Lloyd Vogel.

268
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:43,980
Hey.

269
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,187
Hey.

270
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:49,148
You okay?

271
00:22:50,812 --> 00:22:53,201
I got an assignment.

272
00:22:57,028 --> 00:22:58,962
Where are you going this time?

273
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:02,974
Pittsburgh, tomorrow.

274
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:10,434
I'm profiling Mister Rogers.

275
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:15,286
Really?

276
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:18,638
I love him.

277
00:23:19,224 --> 00:23:21,720
- You do?
- Yeah.

278
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:24,079
Why?

279
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,209
I don't know.

280
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:31,978
Wait, Ellen is giving you a profile?

281
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,261
She knows that's not what you do.

282
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,309
I think that's her point.

283
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,937
Can you say no?

284
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:43,325
Can you take some time
and be with us for a while?

285
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:46,393
You didn't take off any time
when Gavin was born.

286
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:50,541
Not really.

287
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:58,167
At least it's someone good.

288
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,420
Yeah.

289
00:24:02,096 --> 00:24:03,900
We'll see.

290
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:09,552
Oh God, Lloyd.
Please don't ruin my childhood.

291
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,761
Hey, I'm looking for Fred Rogers.

292
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:48,619
Who?

293
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,247
Am I in the wrong place?

294
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:53,328
I know who you are. In here.

295
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:57,607
You'll get about twenty minutes
with him during the break.

296
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:59,203
I was told an hour.

297
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,669
You're not gonna
try to fight him, are you?

298
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,883
Oh, softball league.
Play at the plate.

299
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:08,666
Maybe you shouldn't have led
with your face.

300
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,367
Sorry, guy. Could be a minute.

301
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,854
Is this a Make-a-Wish thing?

302
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:30,200
How are we doing, Margy?

303
00:25:30,243 --> 00:25:31,945
He's ruining my life.

304
00:25:31,945 --> 00:25:33,240
How long?

305
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:39,151
Half-hour already, which puts us...
73 minutes behind. Yikes.

306
00:25:39,151 --> 00:25:42,797
I gotta go in. Cover me.

307
00:25:42,797 --> 00:25:44,475
You're on your own.

308
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:50,307
...color of sweater that I do, but I can't
see colors very well, isn't that funny?

309
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,823
Look at that.

310
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,078
I'm sorry.
Son, he's talking to you.

311
00:25:59,757 --> 00:26:01,318
All right.

312
00:26:02,606 --> 00:26:03,981
Don't do that, sweetheart.

313
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,744
That sword looks awfully sharp,

314
00:26:08,677 --> 00:26:10,705
and heavy too.

315
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,489
- Not really.
- No?

316
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:21,066
Well, you must be very strong
in order to hold it like that.

317
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:27,500
And I bet you are very strong
on the inside, too.

318
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:43,073
Oh, I'd love that.

319
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:45,479
I'm terribly sorry, Fred.
We need to start.

320
00:26:46,383 --> 00:26:48,274
Can I take your picture?

321
00:26:50,854 --> 00:26:53,595
Everybody make sure you can see me.

322
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:55,491
Thank you.

323
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,998
Thank you so much for coming down
and visiting us in the neighborhood.

324
00:26:58,998 --> 00:27:00,971
Folks, if you'll follow me.

325
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:05,156
How often does this happen?

326
00:27:05,574 --> 00:27:07,301
Every day.

327
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,483
Okay here we go!

328
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:14,761
Everybody settle.
Quiet please.

329
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:16,914
Roll sound.

330
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:18,487
- Sound speeds.
- Mark it.

331
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:25,544
And, action.

332
00:27:29,324 --> 00:27:31,388
Do you know what this is?

333
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,425
It's... Lloyd!

334
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:39,949
Lloyd!

335
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,384
Hold please!

336
00:27:41,384 --> 00:27:43,154
We can't fire him, can we?

337
00:27:43,483 --> 00:27:46,505
Hello, Lloyd.
It's nice to meet you.

338
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:48,793
Are you all right?

339
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,706
Play at the plate.

340
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:51,781
It looks like it hurts.

341
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:53,264
Let's chat afterwards?

342
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:56,106
- We need to keep moving.
- We could have Evan take look at him?

343
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,628
No, I'm good.

344
00:27:57,628 --> 00:27:59,813
I'm sorry, Fred,
we need to...

345
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:01,700
Okay, all right.

346
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:06,956
It's wonderful to meet you, I'm so glad
you're here, Lloyd, I'm looking forward to

347
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:09,745
talking with you. I truly am.

348
00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:11,572
After this.

349
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,125
Everyone, this is Lloyd Vogel.
He is a wonderful writer.

350
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:19,470
Thank you, Fred.

351
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,100
Okay, resetting.

352
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,786
Step over here.

353
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,496
Roll sound.

354
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:29,290
Sound speeds.

355
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,104
And slate.

356
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:39,632
And action!

357
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:41,863
Do you know what this is?

358
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:44,606
It's a tent.

359
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,454
Let's set it up.

360
00:29:08,516 --> 00:29:10,171
Mercy.

361
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:12,967
Little bit trickier than I thought.

362
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:43,024
I can't.
I can't do it.

363
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:50,112
It must take two grown-ups
to set up a tent.

364
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:53,385
And that's a cut. Let's go again.

365
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,657
No, let's...

366
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,443
Let's look at that.

367
00:30:00,936 --> 00:30:02,983
Okay, roll playback, please.

368
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:18,671
You know, we could pre-set
a tent for you.

369
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:22,381
No, I think this is good.

370
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:24,964
Yeah.

371
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:28,023
I think we're okay.

372
00:30:29,844 --> 00:30:32,368
Good, that's lunch everybody.

373
00:30:36,015 --> 00:30:38,967
The tent. Why didn't you let them
set it up for you?

374
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:42,555
Children need to know that
even when adults make plan,

375
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:46,397
sometimes, they don't turn out
the way we'd hoped.

376
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:52,002
How long have you been married, Lloyd?

377
00:30:55,283 --> 00:30:56,913
Eight years.

378
00:30:57,683 --> 00:31:01,014
That's a wonderful accomplishment.

379
00:31:02,791 --> 00:31:05,197
Does your spouse have a name?

380
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:07,060
Andrea.

381
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,479
I would like to meet
Andrea some day.

382
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:12,466
I'm sure.

383
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:15,274
You've lived in Pittsburgh
your whole life?

384
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:20,582
I grew up not too far from here
in a town called Latrobe,

385
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:25,556
but we've lived here for quite some time,
and we've raised our boys here.

386
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,477
Do you think living here makes it easier
or more difficult to be a celebrity?

387
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,646
Celebrity? Mercy.

388
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:36,994
You don't consider yourself famous?

389
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:42,630
Fame is a four letter word,
like tape, or zoom, or face.

390
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:46,876
What ultimately matters
is what we do with it.

391
00:31:48,557 --> 00:31:50,551
And what are you doing with it?

392
00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:56,537
We are trying to give children
positive ways

393
00:31:57,225 --> 00:32:00,057
to deal with their feelings.

394
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,476
This piece will be for an issue
about heroes.

395
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:10,204
Do you consider yourself a hero?

396
00:32:10,372 --> 00:32:13,877
I don't think of myself as a hero.
No, not at all.

397
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,591
What about "Mister Rogers"?
Is he a hero?

398
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:21,552
I don't understand the question.

399
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:26,624
There's you, Fred, and then there's
the character you play, Mister Rogers.

400
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,056
You said it was a play at the plate.

401
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:38,608
Is that what happened to you?

402
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:41,722
What did happened to you, Lloyd?

403
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:49,631
I got into a fight.

404
00:32:52,928 --> 00:32:54,290
Oh my.

405
00:32:55,664 --> 00:32:58,815
Who did you get into a fight with?

406
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,787
It's not important.

407
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:16,102
Jerry.

408
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:18,722
And who is Jerry?

409
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:23,513
My father.

410
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:26,339
Oh my.

411
00:33:26,768 --> 00:33:28,645
I'd rather not talk about it.

412
00:33:28,645 --> 00:33:31,710
What were you and your father
fighting about?

413
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,047
I'm here to interview you, Mr. Rogers.

414
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:43,132
Well, that is what we're doing,
isn't it?

415
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,575
We're ready for you
in studio B, Fred.

416
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:47,855
Okay, Margy.

417
00:33:47,855 --> 00:33:49,153
I thought we had twenty minutes.

418
00:33:49,153 --> 00:33:53,343
Can I take your picture? I like to
take pictures of people that I meet

419
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:56,878
so then I can show them
to Joanne later on.

420
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:58,577
Thank you so much.

421
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:01,132
I do hope you'll stick around. I really do.

422
00:34:03,077 --> 00:34:04,407
That's it?

423
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:35,713
Daniel, are you set?

424
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:36,940
I'm set.

425
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,317
Thank you, Daniel.

426
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,968
Did she just talk to the puppet?

427
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:47,483
Daniel isn't just a puppet.
Daniel is Fred, and Fred is Daniel.

428
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:50,973
You mean...

429
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:52,657
Please stop talking.

430
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,605
Let me know
when you're ready, Lattie.

431
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:57,222
Okay. Thank you.

432
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:01,790
And Trolley. Action.

433
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:23,244
Hello, Lady Aberlin.

434
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,919
Hi, Daniel.

435
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,573
Are you making that funny smell?

436
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:31,360
Do you mean
that skunk kinda smell?

437
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,311
No, I'm trying to help
that smell go away.

438
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:38,274
By squirting another smell?

439
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:41,883
That's right. A sweet smelling smell.
Wanna smell?

440
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:43,691
Okay.

441
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,901
That does smell good.

442
00:35:50,324 --> 00:35:52,519
Where did the bad smell come from?

443
00:35:53,503 --> 00:35:55,433
Mister Skunk.

444
00:35:55,863 --> 00:36:01,839
He got scared, and he just sprayed
this smell all over me.

445
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,789
Oh no! Did he say he was sorry?

446
00:36:05,308 --> 00:36:06,326
No.

447
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:12,961
And that just makes me
so very mad!

448
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,632
And I don't know what to do.

449
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:17,737

Thank you, Daniel.

466
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:39,481
- I feel better.
- I'm so glad.

467
00:37:40,998 --> 00:37:42,921
I just don't know if he's for real.

468
00:37:44,181 --> 00:37:45,893
That's not for you to say, Lloyd.

469
00:37:46,285 --> 00:37:47,745
I think with a few more interviews...

470
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:51,147
No, no, no. I told you,
this isn't an exposé, okay?

471
00:37:51,147 --> 00:37:55,560
Just, please, put pen to paper. A couple
of funny anecdotes. Keep it simple.

472
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:59,224
I can't do that, Ellen.
He's a lot more complex than I thought.

473
00:37:59,224 --> 00:38:03,802
He's a children's entertainer.
He's Mister freaking Rogers.

474
00:38:03,802 --> 00:38:05,836
This isn't Mikhail Gorbachev
we're talking about.

475
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:07,674
I don't think you understand
what you're asking of me.

476
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:09,359
I'm asking you to do your job,

477
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,249
Now, get out of here and come back to me
when you have your first draft.

478
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:33,474
This gives new meaning
to "boys in the hoooood".

479
00:38:33,474 --> 00:38:35,949
We'll be back with Mister Rogers!

480
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,726
- Hey.
- Hi.

481
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,321
How'd it go?

482
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,712
He's just about the nicest person
I've ever met.

483
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,974
When you say it it doesn't sound
like a compliment.

484
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:06,351
There is an attitude out there, there are some
things going on, there's a lot of hopelessness.

485
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,534
What do we need to do?

486
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:11,246
There are no simple answers, of course,

487
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:18,843
but if we could, through television programs,
as well as every other imaginable program,

488
00:39:18,843 --> 00:39:22,325
let people know that
each one of us is precious.

489
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:27,465
It all starts in the home. We can
never underrate how important that is.

490
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:35,224
I don't think that anybody can grow unless
he really is accepted exactly as he is.

491
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,821
If somebody is always saying to a child

492
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:41,681
"you're gonna grow up
and you're gonna be fine".

493
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,739
So much of that in this country already.

494
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:45,616
- It's your turn.
- Yup.

495
00:39:45,871 --> 00:39:51,253
A child is appreciated for what
he "will be", not for what he "is".

496
00:39:51,535 --> 00:39:54,096
He will be a great consumer someday.

497
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:59,070
So, the quicker we can get them out of
the nest, so they can go out and buy,

498
00:39:59,098 --> 00:40:01,098
then the better.

499
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:05,776
What do you think is the biggest mistake
parents make in raising their children?

500
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:09,062
Not to remember their old childhood.

501
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,309
Yeah.

502
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:15,710
I think that the best thing
that we can do is to

503
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:20,208
think about what it was like for us,

504
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:24,317
and know what our children
are going through.

505
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,796
But you know what, it's so hard
once you get to be a parent, you always say

506
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:30,847
"I will never do this", when your mother's doing
it to you or your father's doing it to you.

507
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:35,462
You say "I will never do this to my child".
And then you get to our age,

508
00:40:35,462 --> 00:40:40,444
and you forget what it was like
to be this size, you really do forget.

509
00:40:41,142 --> 00:40:44,019
But those children can help
re-evoke what it was like.

510
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:47,837
That's why when you're a parent
you have a new chance to grow.

511
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:49,190
You do?

512
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,464
Did you ever, I can't imagine,
I know that you are the father of two boys,

513
00:40:53,464 --> 00:40:58,219
but I can't imagine you ever having a problem
with your children. You ever have any?

514
00:40:58,219 --> 00:41:01,927
Well, of course, I'm a human being,
just like everybody else...

515
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:06,145
I thought you would just talk to them
and say "Can you say good morning"?

516
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:07,698
And they would change.

517
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:12,319
But, you know, a lot of people
do those parodies...

00:42:43,453 --> 00:42:45,122
Hello.

525
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:49,575
Oh my, I woke you.
Is this Andrea?

526
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:51,123
Yes?

527
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:53,228
This is Fred Rogers.

528
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:55,837
- Oh hi!
- Who is it?

529
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:57,308
Uh, Lloyd's right here.

530
00:42:57,584 --> 00:43:03,295
Andrea, while I have you, I just want to
thank you so much for sharing Lloyd with us.

531
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:06,983
It can't be easy him traveling
with Gavin at home.

532
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,786
Thank you for saying that.

533
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,887
I'm gonna give Lloyd to you now.

534
00:43:14,514 --> 00:43:16,802
Mister Rogers knows my name!

535
00:43:20,885 --> 00:43:22,090
This is Lloyd.

536
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,124
You left without
getting to say goodbye,

537
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:31,501
so I'm glad we get to continue to talk.
I'm going to New York City today to film,

538
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:34,573
and Joanne is coming with me.

539
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:38,208
We thought you might like
to come down and say hello.

540
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:11,203
How much time do you think
I'll have with him today?

541
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,769
You're here because
Fred wants you here.

542
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:19,663
Honored.

543
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,695
He likes everybody,
but he loves people like you.

544
00:44:27,513 --> 00:44:29,615
People like me?

545
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:33,334
I've read your work.

546
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:36,187
You don't really care
for humanity, do you?

547
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,830
I'm just doing my job.

548
00:44:44,418 --> 00:44:47,497
I insisted he read you
before we agreed.

549
00:44:52,104 --> 00:44:53,826
And did he?

550
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:57,373
Every article we could find.

551
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,634
Oh thank you.

552
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:08,099
That made me wanna get up
and do a little dance.

553
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:10,874
We have a surprise
for you, Mister Rogers.

554
00:45:11,015 --> 00:45:14,553
We gonna play one of your songs,
called "You are Special".

555
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,579
How wonderful!

556
00:45:21,708 --> 00:45:26,254
How do you play your instruments
without your bows?

557
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:32,664
Well, we can play pizzicato, which means we're
going to pluck the strings with our fingers.

558
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,383
Hello everybody.

559
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:59,038
Nice to see you.

560
00:46:02,587 --> 00:46:05,593
I call this move
the handshake hand off.

561
00:46:08,661 --> 00:46:10,305
That's quite a skill.

562
00:46:11,196 --> 00:46:14,947
We stole Bill from the
governor's office fourteen years ago.

563
00:46:15,984 --> 00:46:18,548
Have you got a chance
to know him yet?

564
00:46:19,168 --> 00:46:21,258
Love Bill. Big fan.

565
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:25,873
He is very protective of Roge.

566
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:30,013
You call him Roge?

567
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,009
I don't call him Mister Rogers
at home, dear.

568
00:46:36,383 --> 00:46:38,101
Joanne Rogers.

569
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:40,524
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well, dear.

570
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:45,188
How does it feel to be married
to a living saint?

571
00:46:46,563 --> 00:46:48,804
I'm not fond of that term.

572
00:46:49,903 --> 00:46:56,028
If you think of him as a saint,
then his way of being is unattainable.

573
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:59,644
He works at it all the time.
It's a practice.

574
00:47:02,336 --> 00:47:04,511
He's not a perfect person.

575
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:07,349
He has a temper.

576
00:47:07,497 --> 00:47:11,436
He chooses how he
responds to that anger.

577
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:13,965
That must take a lot of effort.

578
00:47:14,794 --> 00:47:18,177
Well, he does things every day
that help ground him.

579
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:23,506
Reads scripture, swims laps.
Prays for people by name.

580
00:47:23,815 --> 00:47:27,654
Writes letters, hundreds of them.
He's been doing that since I met him.

581
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:29,112
Thank you so much.

582
00:47:32,421 --> 00:47:34,556
Thank you folks for coming out.

583
00:47:34,663 --> 00:47:36,606
- My love.
- Bye, my love.

584
00:47:36,606 --> 00:47:39,419
We'll see you in just a few hours.

585
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:42,766
Lloyd, I thought you and I
would spend some time together.

586
00:47:42,766 --> 00:47:43,992
Of course.

587
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:06,563
Do you always take the subway?

588
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:11,038
Joanne and I have an apartment.
It's just a few stops away.

589
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:14,540
It's the easiest way
to get around sometimes.

590
00:48:24,386 --> 00:48:30,050
You've covered some heavy stuff,
especially for a show aimed at children.

591
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,531
I'm glad you had a chance
to view the program.

592
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:38,096
Death, divorce, war. It gets dark.

593
00:48:42,492 --> 00:48:43,793
You know,

594
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:50,844
Maggie Stewart showed me
the most beautiful word in sign language.

595
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:55,464
Do you know what that means?
It means "friend".

596
00:48:57,215 --> 00:48:59,039
Isn't that perfect?

597
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:01,800
Who's Maggie Stewart?

598
00:49:01,988 --> 00:49:03,772

That was wonderful.

614
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:18,797
It seems like all these people
line up to tell you their problems.

615
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:22,944
Isn't it wonderful? Such bravery.

616
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:27,564
It seems like that would be
an incredible burden on you.

617
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:30,952
I'm grateful for you
saying that, Lloyd.

618
00:50:32,205 --> 00:50:34,787
I'm grateful for your compassion.

619
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:41,780
Is it a burden on you?

620
00:50:45,851 --> 00:50:48,148
Okay. Let's assume
it's a burden on you.

621
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:54,339
There's no normal life
that is free from pain.

622
00:50:55,905 --> 00:50:57,549
How do you deal with that?

623
00:50:58,398 --> 00:51:01,528
There are many ways you can deal
with your feelings without

624
00:51:02,006 --> 00:51:04,596
hurting yourself or anybody else.

625
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:07,057
Yeah, like what?

626
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:10,771
You can pound a lump of clay.

627
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:14,445
Or swim as fast as you can swim.

628
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:19,091
Or play the lowest keys on the piano
all at the same time.

629
00:51:23,644 --> 00:51:27,207
Did you ever talk to anyone
about the burden you carry?

630
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,563
Would you like to meet
my special puppet friends

631
00:51:41,563 --> 00:51:44,112
from The Neighborhood of Make Believe?

632
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:53,453
They look like they've seen
better days.

633
00:51:53,809 --> 00:51:56,725
They've been with me
for quite a while.

634
00:51:57,231 --> 00:52:00,131
You ever think about swapping them out,
getting new ones?

635
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:06,841
Didn't you have a special friend
when you were very young, Lloyd?

636
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:11,979
- A special friend?
- Special toy.

637
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:17,415
Or a stuffed animal
that you loved very much,

638
00:52:17,812 --> 00:52:23,788
even as it got ratty and worn-out,
it made you just love it all the more?

639
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,464
I don't know, I'm sure I did.

640
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:32,384
Can you tell me
about your special friend?

641
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:36,922
I think I had a rabbit.

642
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,721
Did your rabbit have a name?

643
00:52:44,037 --> 00:52:46,018
It was just rabbit.

644
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:50,683
It was Old Rabbit.

645
00:52:55,032 --> 00:52:58,028
And who gave you Old Rabbit?

646
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:02,035
My mom.

647
00:53:02,797 --> 00:53:06,074
She must love you very much.

648
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:12,240
That she did.
She died when I was young.

649
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:24,513
I'm sure that if she saw you today,
the person you have become,

650
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:26,997
she would be proud of you.

651
00:53:36,028 --> 00:53:38,048
I want to get back to my questions.

652
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:43,301
You wanted to meet my special friends
from the Neighborhood of Make Believe.

653
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:45,923
No. I asked about the burden you carry.

654
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:53,989
I am King Friday the thirteenth.

655
00:53:54,602 --> 00:54:00,602
Lloyd Vogel the journalist,
I presume?

656
00:54:01,794 --> 00:54:04,865
And here's Daniel Striped Tiger.

657
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:09,523
Sometimes, Daniel is too shy to talk.

658
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,280
But that's okay, Daniel.

659
00:54:23,211 --> 00:54:25,430
Have you met Daniel?

660
00:54:27,824 --> 00:54:29,463
Not officially. No.

661
00:54:40,837 --> 00:54:44,206
I'd like to meet Old Rabbit.

662
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:53,003
I don't wanna talk
about Old Rabbit, I gotta say.

663
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:58,670
Maybe Lloyd doesn't feel
like talking today, Daniel.

664
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,799
And that's okay.

665
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:04,718
Can you put
the puppet down, Fred?

666
00:55:12,037 --> 00:55:16,367
You stopped making the show
in the mid-seventies for three years.

667
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:18,397
Why'd you quit?

668
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:20,704
At that point I felt the program

669
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:24,680
had covered all the major
facets of childhood.

670
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,673
And what brought you back?
Money? Boredom?

671
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:33,408
My sons had grown into teenagers.
And were struggling.

672
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:36,837
We all were.

673
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:42,561
I realized then that there were
still much more to talk about.

674
00:55:44,804 --> 00:55:50,657
I can't imagine it was easy,
growing up with you as a father.

675
00:55:57,474 --> 00:56:01,413
Until recently, my oldest
never told people about me.

676
00:56:03,682 --> 00:56:06,904
He's very private,
and that's okay.

677
00:56:09,197 --> 00:56:13,943
And my younger son,
he genuinely tested me.

678
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:20,270
But, eventually, we found our way.
And now I'm very proud of both of them.

679
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:28,286
But you are right, Lloyd.

680
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:32,150
It couldn't have been
easy on them.

681
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:36,537
Thank you.

682
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:40,724
Thank you for that perspective.

683
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:46,200
You're welcome.

684
00:56:48,306 --> 00:56:51,645
Is that not the answer
you were hoping for?

685
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:56,349
Being a parent does not mean
being a perfect parent.

686
00:56:56,389 --> 00:57:01,398
You might be experiencing
some of that now, with your son.

687
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:09,670
I've been thinking a lot
about you and your father.

688
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,843
Did you work out your disagreement?

689
00:57:15,297 --> 00:57:17,537
This is ridiculous.

690
00:57:18,528 --> 00:57:20,009
Lloyd, where are you going?

691
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:22,714
We're done. Thanks.
It's been a real pleasure.

692
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:30,985
Mercy.

693
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,107
Hey hey.

694
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,410
C'mon, sit down.
We cooked you some take-out.

695
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:07,757
They brought pizza.

696
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,294
Lloyd, this is Dorothy.

697
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,833
Hello.

698
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:24,622
Can't you just say hello?
Where are your manners?

699
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:29,136
I'm sorry. I think we should go.

700
00:58:34,483 --> 00:58:36,983
I had an idea, okay?

701
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,205
We'd eat some food,
we'd talk like people.

702
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:47,615
I messed things up
at the wedding.

703
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:55,475
Of course, you know,
you didn't help, but I get it.

704
00:58:57,862 --> 00:59:02,576
Then, you let me sit out there in my car
on the street for two nights

705
00:59:03,612 --> 00:59:06,419
like I'm homeless,
like I'm some kind of a bum.

706
00:59:06,439 --> 00:59:09,509
- Jerry, you're not helping.
- He won't say a word!

707
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:11,816
You came here
to introduce me to her?

708
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:15,621
Dorothy.

709
00:59:16,711 --> 00:59:18,393
Hi, Dorothy.

710
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,780
Hi, Lloyd.

711
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:23,357
Okay, you did what you came here to do.
Now I want you to leave.

712
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:24,923
Lloyd!

713
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:34,433
I may never come back here,

714
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:37,929
so, please listen to me.

715
00:59:39,234 --> 00:59:44,985
Dorothy and I have been together
and in love for fifteen years.

716
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:48,340
He left as soon as Mom got sick,
did you know that?

717
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,630
Couldn't even wait
for her to die.

718
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,976
She really didn't want me there.

719
00:59:50,976 --> 00:59:53,838
'Cause you were sleeping around
while she was dying.

720
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:56,018
I know. I know it!

721
00:59:57,306 --> 00:59:59,971
It took me years
to get myself together.

722
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:06,887
Dorothy is why I'm standing here.
She helped me grow the hell up.

723
01:00:11,404 --> 01:00:14,394
You know what they tell you
about people, when they are dying?

724
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:16,757
They tell you it's peaceful.
That they just slip away.

725
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:19,972
Mom screamed as she went,
did you know that?

726
01:00:22,031 --> 01:00:24,417
She screamed until she passed out.

727
01:00:24,417 --> 01:00:28,174
And then they came in and revived her,
and she went right back to it.

728
01:00:28,627 --> 01:00:31,791
It was just me, Lorraine
and the nurses!

729
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:34,792
Sign the paperwork.
Pack up the house.

730
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:36,659
Put her in the ground.

731
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:38,994
- Jerry.
- Come on, Lloyd.

732
01:00:41,289 --> 01:00:42,589
My jaw.

733
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:44,131
Jerry.

734
01:00:45,192 --> 01:00:46,841
Jerry!

735
01:00:46,997 --> 01:00:48,836
Oh, Jerry, Oh my God!

736
01:00:48,836 --> 01:00:51,784
- I'll call 911.
- Lloyd, do something!

737
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,563
- Is he breathing?
- Yeah, he's breathing.

738
01:01:10,235 --> 01:01:12,237
Lloyd, do something!

739
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:17,290
The cardiac MRI revealed
more extensive stenosis than we thought.

740
01:01:18,165 --> 01:01:22,843
An operation at this time...
The risk of infection alone...

741
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,760
You know anything?

742
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:41,525
I hate hospitals.

743
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,663
You should go home
and get him to bed.

744
01:01:53,017 --> 01:01:54,845
I don't wanna leave you here.

745
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:56,584
I'm not staying here.

746
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:00,668
Okay.

747
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:04,593
Let's all go together.

748
01:02:05,058 --> 01:02:07,294
No. I have to go to Pittsburgh.

749
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:08,769
Right now?

750
01:02:08,886 --> 01:02:10,187
Yeah, I have to work.

751
01:02:10,701 --> 01:02:12,324
With your dad like this?

752
01:02:12,324 --> 01:02:13,827
I have a deadline.

753
01:02:13,827 --> 01:02:17,452
Yeah, I'm sure Ellen would understand
if you tell her what's happening.

754
01:02:17,452 --> 01:02:18,991
I don't want to.

755
01:02:18,991 --> 01:02:21,550
I wanna go to Pittsburgh.
I wanna do my job.

756
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,022
This shouldn't be a surprise to you.

757
01:02:24,022 --> 01:02:25,967
Don't talk to me like that.

758
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:28,498
You seem to think that
now that we have a kid

759
01:02:28,498 --> 01:02:31,061
I shouldn't care about all the things
I have always cared about

760
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:33,729
just because you don't anymore.
Well, I still care about my work.

761
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:36,789
I have never asked you
to stop caring about your work.

762
01:02:37,706 --> 01:02:38,437
I've gotta go.

763
01:02:38,437 --> 01:02:41,866
Why? Everyone who is important is
in this hospital right now.

764
01:02:41,866 --> 01:02:45,278
Can't you be on my side for once?

765
01:02:46,203 --> 01:02:47,263
You used to be on my side.

766
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,801
I am telling you this
because I am on your side.

767
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:53,210
Now is not the time to go work.

768
01:03:07,907 --> 01:03:10,525
I gotta go, if I'm gonna make
Pittsburgh by morning.

769
01:03:10,572 --> 01:03:11,987
Fine.

770
01:03:12,132 --> 01:03:14,826
I'm gonna go sit with your family,
while you go.

771
01:03:35,726 --> 01:03:37,212
Pittsburgh?

772
01:04:33,189 --> 01:04:34,506
Lloyd! There you are.

773
01:04:34,506 --> 01:04:35,918
Hey, I need to talk to Fred.

774
01:04:35,918 --> 01:04:39,088
Very funny, mister. Get over there.
We're ready to shoot.

775
01:04:40,136 --> 01:04:42,260
Right this way. Come here.

776
01:04:42,767 --> 01:04:44,067
Quiet please.

777
01:04:44,067 --> 01:04:45,656
What? What am doing here?

778
01:04:45,656 --> 01:04:48,528
You're in this episode, of course.
Just wait there.

779
01:04:48,528 --> 01:04:50,200
- Roll sound.
- Sound speeds.

780
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,561
And slate.

781
01:04:52,053 --> 01:04:53,949
And... Action.

782
01:04:59,702 --> 01:05:03,940
Oh, it's my good friend, Lloyd.
Lloyd Vogel.

783
01:05:04,115 --> 01:05:07,140
- You remember Lloyd?
- Fred, I don't understand what's going on.

784
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,866
Can we stop?

785
01:05:09,476 --> 01:05:11,142
Are you feeling unwell?

786
01:05:11,142 --> 01:05:13,890
Stop asking me questions.
I ask you questions.

787
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:18,205
On today's program I thought
we would talk about hospitals.

788
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,128
Sometimes when somebody is sick,

789
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:26,519
- they have to go to a hospital.
- I hate hospitals.

790
01:05:27,149 --> 01:05:30,827
A hospital is a place
where people go.

791
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:31,813
Okay.

792
01:05:31,813 --> 01:05:34,584
Would you like to pretend
we're at a hospital?

793
01:05:34,584 --> 01:05:36,139
No!

794
01:05:57,085 --> 01:05:58,832
Hello, Old Rabbit.

795
01:05:58,832 --> 01:06:00,101
What?

796
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,281
Old Rabbit, I presume?

797
01:06:06,281 --> 01:06:09,880
I'm not... I don't...
Where's Fred?

798
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,515
I've been waiting to meet you,
Old Rabbit.

799
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:17,253
I'm so happy you came for a visit.

800
01:06:19,095 --> 01:06:20,844
Hello, Lady Aberlin.

801
01:06:21,301 --> 01:06:24,627
Well hello. Hello, Old Rabbit.

802
01:06:24,627 --> 01:06:25,852
Oh my God.

803
01:06:25,852 --> 01:06:29,202
We were discussing hospitals.

804
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:33,613
Well, a hospital is where you go
when your body is hurt,

805
01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:37,102
but what do you do
when your feelings are hurt?

806
01:06:37,102 --> 01:06:40,633
Well, you talk about them.

807
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:43,650
♪ It's good to talk. It's good to say ♪

808
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:45,867
- The things we feel.
- What's happening to me?

809
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:48,239
♪ It's good to talk ♪

810
01:06:48,541 --> 01:06:51,477

01:06:51,477 --> 01:06:53,860
♪ It's good to talk ♪

812
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:57,580
Go ahead. Try saying "I like you".

813
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,918
I like you.

814
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,960
♪ I'm sad ♪

815
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:10,413
I'm sad.

816
01:07:10,909 --> 01:07:13,691
♪ I'm angry ♪

817
01:07:17,694 --> 01:07:20,157
When did you become angry?

818
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:25,426
Do you remember?
Did something happen?

819
01:07:47,331 --> 01:07:49,224
Hey peanut.

820
01:07:49,972 --> 01:07:51,935
Hi, Mom.

821
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:03,218
I know you think
you're doing this for me.

822
01:08:04,348 --> 01:08:06,814
Holding onto this anger.

823
01:08:10,441 --> 01:08:12,885
I don't need it.

824
01:08:47,428 --> 01:08:49,098
Lloyd?

825
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:52,860
Lloyd?

826
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:53,812
What happened?

827
01:08:53,812 --> 01:08:56,227
I don't know. He just collapsed.

828
01:08:56,227 --> 01:08:57,819
Is he okay?

829
01:09:59,803 --> 01:10:01,640
Turn.

830
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:09,579
Oh good, you're awake.

831
01:10:10,612 --> 01:10:14,275
My goodness, if I knew you were there,
I would've stopped all this noise.

832
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:17,329
No, no. That was beautiful.

833
01:10:19,633 --> 01:10:24,606
You must be very hungry, Lloyd.
Let me get my jacket, and we'll go out.

834
01:10:24,606 --> 01:10:25,944
I should go.

835
01:10:25,944 --> 01:10:28,379
No, nonsense.

836
01:10:38,358 --> 01:10:40,855
Look at this.
Thank you so much.

837
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,175
Enjoy.

838
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,820
Thank you.

839
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:48,642
Are you a vegetarian?

840
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:55,704
I just can't imagine
eating anything with a mother.

841
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:04,954
Bill was right.
You love people like me.

842
01:11:06,214 --> 01:11:08,384
What are people like you?

843
01:11:09,128 --> 01:11:12,860
I've never met anyone
like you in my entire life.

844
01:11:15,747 --> 01:11:17,715
Broken people.

845
01:11:20,603 --> 01:11:22,788
I don't think you are broken.

846
01:11:29,259 --> 01:11:32,588
I know you are a man of conviction.

847
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:39,817
A person, who knows the difference
between what is wrong, and what is right.

848
01:11:42,055 --> 01:11:46,017
Try to remember
that your relationship with your father

849
01:11:46,675 --> 01:11:50,038
also helped to shape those parts.

850
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:56,915
He helped you become what you are.

851
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,920
Would you do something
with me, Lloyd?

852
01:12:08,318 --> 01:12:13,065
It's an exercise
I like to do sometimes.

853
01:12:13,983 --> 01:12:16,293
We'll take a minute,

854
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:22,175
and think about all the people
who loved us into being.

855
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,036
I can't do that.

856
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:33,691
They will come to you.

857
01:12:37,707 --> 01:12:40,580
Just one minute of silence.

858
01:14:02,091 --> 01:14:04,797
Thank you for doing that with me.

859
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,919
I feel so much better.

860
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:38,081
So, the way I left...

861
01:14:38,498 --> 01:14:40,050
Was messed up.

862
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:43,309
Yes. I should've called you.

863
01:14:43,309 --> 01:14:45,432
You shouldn't have left.

864
01:14:46,402 --> 01:14:49,534
The doctor came out to speak to you,
I didn't know what to tell her.

865
01:14:49,534 --> 01:14:52,310
I really didn't know what
to tell your dad.

866
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:55,368
And on top of that,
I tried to get a cab home,

867
01:14:55,544 --> 01:14:59,258
of course, I couldn't get one,
so had I took a train, at midnight.

868
01:15:00,547 --> 01:15:03,087
People were looking at me
with Gavin like...

869
01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:06,291
Someone was gonna
call Child Services.

870
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:14,971
I know you're trying to apologize,
but that doesn't mean it gets to be easy.

871
01:15:18,273 --> 01:15:19,803
Okay, talk.

872
01:15:22,991 --> 01:15:25,027
Can we sit?

873
01:15:36,852 --> 01:15:38,687
Is he down?

874
01:15:39,141 --> 01:15:41,110
Finally.

875
01:15:47,077 --> 01:15:48,566
Listen...

876
01:15:50,017 --> 01:15:53,660
I realize I need to deal
with my feelings.

877
01:15:57,964 --> 01:15:59,345
When I'm scared,

878
01:16:00,093 --> 01:16:02,805
which I was in the hospital,
and I...

879
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:07,215
I have been for a long time,

880
01:16:10,156 --> 01:16:12,577
I get really angry.

881
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:18,759
And I know it's a way of saying
"I can't deal with this

882
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:22,941
get away from me".
But that's not what I want.

883
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:27,847
That's, actually, the opposite
of what I want.

884
01:16:35,099 --> 01:16:37,285
You and Gavin...

885
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,587
You're what I want.

886
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:54,692
I'm sorry.

887
01:17:13,841 --> 01:17:16,411
I have to go and see Jerry.

888
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:20,880
He's dying.

889
01:17:21,802 --> 01:17:23,904
I know.

890
01:17:24,652 --> 01:17:26,985
My dad is dying.

891
01:17:36,178 --> 01:17:41,572
Celia Sherman. Colby Dickerson.

892
01:17:45,814 --> 01:17:47,755
Justin Cook.

893
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:59,598
Rebecca Aniton.

894
01:18:15,928 --> 01:18:18,320
Lloyd Vogel.

895
01:18:28,473 --> 01:18:30,952
Andrea Vogel.

896
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:37,161
Gavin Vogel.

897
01:18:40,834 --> 01:18:43,252
Jerry Vogel.

898
01:18:57,126 --> 01:18:59,101
Thank you, God.

899
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:28,676
He still eats like a teenager.

900
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,648
Cold cuts, sugar cereal.

901
01:19:34,254 --> 01:19:36,332
Stubborn goat.

902
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,027
At least you come by it honestly.

903
01:19:45,171 --> 01:19:48,677
Did you know about
me and my sister?

904
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:53,908
Not until very recently.

905
01:20:00,094 --> 01:20:02,293
What about my mom?

906
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:08,338
When he got sick last year,

907
01:20:09,665 --> 01:20:11,670
the first episode, he...

908
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:14,799
He started to talk,

909
01:20:14,957 --> 01:20:19,297
and tell me things I wish
he'd told me a long time ago.

910
01:20:48,703 --> 01:20:50,826
We got bourbon, you know.

911
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,958
Someone should drink it.

912
01:20:55,931 --> 01:20:57,432
No thanks.

913
01:21:02,647 --> 01:21:04,721
Not even beer?

914
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,694
Do you have a beer? Yeah I...

915
01:21:08,694 --> 01:21:10,800
I'll drink a beer
if it will make you happy.

916
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,742
No. I don't have a beer. And don't
do it because it'd make me happy.

917
01:21:13,742 --> 01:21:15,031
Do it 'cause you wanna do it.

918
01:21:15,031 --> 01:21:16,982
You don't have a beer
and I don't wanna beer.

919
01:21:16,982 --> 01:21:21,411
So, don't drink anything. Dehydrate.

920
01:21:23,113 --> 01:21:24,609
Sorry.

921
01:21:24,884 --> 01:21:27,401
I definitely broke the Pack 'n Play.

922
01:21:27,685 --> 01:21:29,988
It just snapped like a chicken bone.

923
01:21:31,115 --> 01:21:31,961
How is he doing?

924
01:21:31,961 --> 01:21:33,943
He seems fine.
I don't know.

925
01:21:33,943 --> 01:21:37,054
They don't put a hospital bed
in your living room if you're fine.

926
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:40,415
Hey, thank you for coming.

927
01:21:47,675 --> 01:21:49,020
You're gonna love the sofa bed.

928
01:21:49,020 --> 01:21:50,900
- Yeah?
- No.

929
01:22:13,519 --> 01:22:15,698
Okay. Come here.

930
01:22:35,966 --> 01:22:38,690
I know. I know.

931
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:06,290
I know, you wish it was your mom
who was awake right now. I know.

932
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:08,929
But we're gonna let her sleep, okay?

933
01:23:11,263 --> 01:23:13,893
I'm gonna get better at this.

934
01:23:15,383 --> 01:23:18,451
And we're gonna have to
get used to each other.

935
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:27,884
♪ I like you as you are ♪

936
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:34,873

940
01:23:56,784 --> 01:23:58,846
Who's that?

941
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:02,084
Dorothy?

942
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:04,026
Come on.

943
01:24:08,991 --> 01:24:10,700
You okay?

944
01:24:13,246 --> 01:24:15,369
Yeah, I'm fine.

945
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:20,567
It's four in the morning.

946
01:24:22,547 --> 01:24:25,122
I don't sleep much these days.

947
01:24:29,931 --> 01:24:32,582
You don't sleep either, do you?

948
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,556
I never did this with you.

949
01:24:41,108 --> 01:24:46,328
Up in the middle of the night,
doing the mom thing.

950
01:24:47,031 --> 01:24:49,363
It's not a mom thing.

951
01:24:50,055 --> 01:24:52,255
You know what I mean.

952
01:24:52,641 --> 01:24:54,466
You should rest.

953
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:59,129
No, stay.

954
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:26,384
Hey.

955
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:31,356
Right over there.

956
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:33,592
What?

957
01:25:34,065 --> 01:25:36,710
Just grab two glasses.

958
01:25:37,752 --> 01:25:40,027
I don't think that's the best idea.

959
01:25:40,027 --> 01:25:43,078
How would you know? You don't drink.

960
01:25:45,867 --> 01:25:47,557
Come on.

961
01:25:59,996 --> 01:26:02,835
Now we're talking.

962
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,507
Cheers.

963
01:26:44,869 --> 01:26:47,191
Lloyd.

964
01:26:50,568 --> 01:26:53,953
I am sorry for leaving
you and your sister.

965
01:27:00,809 --> 01:27:06,018
It was selfish. And it was cruel.

966
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:14,700
Will you look at me?

967
01:27:28,861 --> 01:27:32,905
I am so sorry, son.

968
01:27:45,323 --> 01:27:47,469
It's not fair, you know?

969
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:58,149
I think I'm just now starting
to figure out how to live my life.

970
01:28:06,711 --> 01:28:09,869
I've always loved you.

971
01:28:17,139 --> 01:28:21,126
I love you too, Dad.

972
01:28:57,797 --> 01:28:59,610
What?

973
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:04,681
It's stupid.

974
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,838
It's like ten thousand words.

975
01:29:17,838 --> 01:29:19,032
Yeah.

976
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,633
It's not really about
Mister Rogers.

977
01:29:22,633 --> 01:29:23,738
I know.

978
01:29:23,738 --> 01:29:28,804
I mean it is, but it's so you.

979
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:32,806
You never talk about this stuff.

980
01:29:33,885 --> 01:29:35,340
Nope.

981
01:29:36,029 --> 01:29:38,199
It's good.

982
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:40,738
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

983
01:29:40,738 --> 01:29:43,573
Lloyd. I love it.

984
01:29:43,903 --> 01:29:44,897
You do?

985
01:29:44,897 --> 01:29:47,418
Yes. It's gonna be the cover.

986
01:30:38,257 --> 01:30:39,702
Right off the bat,
about the wedding...

987
01:30:39,702 --> 01:30:42,376
Whatever, It was the most
entertaining one yet.

988
01:30:43,565 --> 01:30:45,411
I'm just glad you're here.

989
01:30:52,809 --> 01:30:54,668
Don't go to Martha's Vineyard.

990
01:30:54,668 --> 01:30:57,163
Why not?
It's my honeymoon. I deserve it.

991
01:30:57,163 --> 01:30:58,557
Absolutely you do.

992
01:30:58,557 --> 01:31:01,142
No, it's not a question of entitlement.
You're not gonna like it.

993
01:31:01,142 --> 01:31:03,889
It's a buncha rich jerks,
and it's freezing.

994
01:31:03,889 --> 01:31:06,098
You're gonna freeze to death
with a buncha rich jerks.

995
01:31:08,873 --> 01:31:10,330
Who's here?

996
01:31:12,196 --> 01:31:14,196
Ah, I'm in the right place.

997
01:31:14,624 --> 01:31:16,628
- Come on in.
- Lloyd.

998
01:31:22,330 --> 01:31:24,553
Holy crap.

999
01:31:25,977 --> 01:31:26,897
Andrea?

1000
01:31:26,897 --> 01:31:28,688
Hi Fred.

1001
01:31:28,688 --> 01:31:30,786
Such a pleasure
to finally see you.

1002
01:31:30,933 --> 01:31:32,925
- Can I take this for you?
- Oh, thank you.

1003
01:31:33,337 --> 01:31:35,184
Hello, Mister Rogers.

1004
01:31:35,184 --> 01:31:37,674
Hello.

1005
01:31:39,419 --> 01:31:43,367
Hi Gavin, hello, I hope you and I
can be friends someday.

1006
01:31:48,043 --> 01:31:50,019
Mr. Vogel.

1007
01:31:51,702 --> 01:31:53,786
May I call you Jerry?

1008
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:57,351
Yes sir, you certainly may.

1009
01:32:02,822 --> 01:32:06,705
Lloyd, Joanne adored
your article, as did I.

1010
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:13,983
Andrea, are you
feeling better about daycare?

1011
01:32:14,483 --> 01:32:17,957
A little. Maybe.

1012
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:23,026
What?

1013
01:32:23,026 --> 01:32:24,989
You're not the only one
who talks to Fred.

1014
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:29,934
Mister Rogers, is it true
you are a sharp shooter?

1015
01:32:30,426 --> 01:32:31,990
Navy Seal!

1016
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:34,432
No, I'm afraid not.

1017
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,044
What, the hell, kind of an insane
question was that?

1018
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:39,682
I heard it.

1019
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,269
Andrea, where did you guys go
on your honeymoon?

1020
01:32:42,589 --> 01:32:46,576
We eloped in Maui, so we were kinda
already on our honeymoon.

1021
01:32:46,714 --> 01:32:48,990
- I would've gone.
- You weren't invited.

1022
01:32:50,732 --> 01:32:53,399
Lloyd is embarrassed by us.

1023
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:57,622
- I'm kidding.
- I know.

1024
01:32:58,925 --> 01:33:01,406
Maybe, we should do
a family vacation.

1025
01:33:01,578 --> 01:33:05,426
What do you think about that, Dad? Should
we dip our toes in the ocean together?

1026
01:33:05,426 --> 01:33:06,905
That sounds so nice.

1027
01:33:06,963 --> 01:33:12,816
Crash your honeymoon?
Count me in, If I'm still here.

1028
01:33:31,285 --> 01:33:34,778
You know, death is something

1029
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:38,213
many of us are uncomfortable
speaking about.

1030
01:33:42,126 --> 01:33:45,502
But to die is to be human.

1031
01:33:47,492 --> 01:33:50,281
And anything human is mentionable,

1032
01:33:50,655 --> 01:33:54,526
anything mentionable is manageable.

1033
01:33:57,616 --> 01:34:00,247
Anything mentionable is manageable.

1034
01:34:15,052 --> 01:34:18,189
You gotta send me a copy.

1035
01:34:18,826 --> 01:34:22,146
Joanne would love this
when she sees it.

1036
01:34:22,801 --> 01:34:25,014
It'd be so much cooler
if he was in this.

1037
01:34:26,826 --> 01:34:28,850
Thank you.

1038
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:30,394
I should get going.

1039
01:34:30,563 --> 01:34:32,526
I'll walk you out.

1040
01:34:51,931 --> 01:34:54,023
Count on it.

1041
01:34:54,204 --> 01:34:55,900
Thank you.

1042
01:35:05,923 --> 01:35:09,507
Hey, what did you say to Jerry?

1043
01:35:10,079 --> 01:35:12,264
I asked him to pray for me.

1044
01:35:12,405 --> 01:35:17,788
I figure anyone who's going through what he's
going through must be awfully close to God.

Maybe, I could slow down

1059
01:36:55,902 --> 01:36:57,543
What do you mean?

1060
01:36:57,837 --> 01:37:00,319
To stay at home with Gavin.

1061
01:37:01,407 --> 01:37:04,712
Let you go back to work,
without having to worry about daycare.

1062

- I want to.
- Really? You?

1063
01:37:14,147 --> 01:37:16,649
Gavin and I already discussed that.

01:37:35,799 --> 01:37:40,592
I'm so glad I had a chance to tell you
about my friend Lloyd, and his family.

1066
01:37:43,621 --> 01:37:47,252
I have a new picture of Lloyd
with his family,

1067
01:37:47,252 --> 01:37:49,383
would you like to see it?

1068
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:53,475
There they are.

1069
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,258
That's a nice picture.

1070
01:37:56,526 --> 01:38:00,958
It gives me a good feeling
to see them all together like that.

1071

I hope you know that you made
today a very special day

1072
01:38:08,646 --> 01:38:11,357
by just your being you.

1073
01:38:11,521 --> 01:38:16,964
