1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,969
Amelia, thank you for agreeing

2
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,270
to do this interview.

3
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:38,771
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,273
Thank you.

5
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:43,343
I'm a little nervous.

6
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,678
Really? How so?

7
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,181
Cameras, people watching,

8
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:51,784
kind of feeling the
pressure, you know?

9
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,254
What I actually
mean is some people

10
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,623
may be asking how
it's possible for you

11
00:00:56,624 --> 00:01:00,761
to even feel nervousness
considering what you are.

12
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,396
How did you feel
when you realized

13
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,899
that you were no longer human?

14
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:19,446
What we're working on

15
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,981
is going to change the world.

16
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:23,650
Scientists have known for years

17
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:26,453
that the human brain is
essentially an electrical device.

18
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:29,456
Beginning data stream in 10...

19
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,060
Seven, six.

20
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,396
That's where our memories
are, everything about us.

21
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,466
Our hopes, fears, dreams.

22
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,639
Six, five, four.

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,176
Transmitting neural
impulses from the brain

24
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:50,310
is nothing new.

25
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,245
This, this is the next step.

26
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,347
Containing those connections.

27
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,984
We can't return life
that's already lost.

28
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:02,189
But, we might be
able to intercede

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,257
before the moment of death

30
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,125
and rescue a person's
consciousness

31
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,461
before it's lost forever.

32
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,101
If we can do that,
then that is the key

33
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:18,672
to living forever, to
saving those we love.

34
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,648
To saving those who
leave us too soon.

35
00:02:30,117 --> 00:02:32,985
That's what we're trying to do.

36
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,288
Every day we learn new ways

37
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,657
to conquer the limits
of the human body.

38
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,961
We're approaching new
worlds, new frontiers,

39
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:43,730
and new possibilities for life.

40
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,833
And I will tell you, we
are already looking forward

41
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,001
to the students,
to the pioneers,

42
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,470
and the breakthroughs
yet to come.

43
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:53,406
Each day we hear new
ideas, see new projects,

44
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,107
and we meet new heroes.

45
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,244
Here's to building
a better future.

46
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,279
Here's to building
better people.

47
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:28,442
Dad used to say that life
was like a light switch.

48
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,381
You die and you're
just turned off.

49
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:39,787
I don't think he
was ever afraid.

50
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,859
What do you think?

51
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,403
Still not used to it, you know?

52
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780
Just...

53
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,519
Tell me what you need me to do.

54
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,059
Stay safe out there.

55
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,894
Here's the thing, Adah,

56
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,431
there's no such thing as
the natural order of life.

57
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,733
You're saying in your
book that transhumanism

58
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:30,036
is humanity escaping the
bounds of the human body,

59
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,372
but again, keep in mind
we're talking to everyone

60
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:35,408
that has the main
idea that humanity

61
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:39,579
is having flesh and
bones, being human itself

62
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,980
and having a physical body.

63
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,081
Everything that we engineer,

64
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,583
everything that we do...

65
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,919
For lunch there is celery.

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,355
You need to tell
that partner of yours

67
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,457
that he's a bad
influence on you.

68
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,759
Gotta keep you
lookin' good, mister.

69
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,026
Mm-hm.

70
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:57,498
Maybe I can just call
in sick to work and...

71
00:05:00,334 --> 00:05:02,168
You know, one of these
days I got to tell Amelia

72
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,637
I need more calories
than a ham sandwich.

73
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,138
Enjoy it while it lasts.

74
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,576
Still have things about
each other you don't know.

75
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,110
That's not true, Vaughan.

76
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,613
Carter, I've been
married since college.

77
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,247
You got five months tops, right,

78
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,550
and then she accidentally
leaves the bathroom door open

79
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:20,019
or forgets to flush.

80
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,589
Next thing you know,
seven years go by

81
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,323
and you got a mortgage.

82
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,558
She starts talkin' about kids.

83
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,794
You guys have talked
about that, right?

84
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:28,795
Yeah.

85
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,333
I mean, not recently.

86
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,373
What the hell's so funny.

87
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,841
Oh, it's comin'.

88
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,211
Oh, welcome to the club
of former honeymooners.

89
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:47,980
You better start
picking out baby names.

90
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,982
Until then,

91
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,386
enjoy this time.

92
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:54,621
I am.

93
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:55,556
And you know what, I'm
actually looking forward

94
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,889
to picking out baby names.

95
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,191
I am.

96
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,593
All units be advised,

97
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:02,028
reports of a mentally unstable
man on Lily Boulevard.

98
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,696
Can I get a responder?

99
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,264
So much for lunch.

100
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,849
Are you okay, Mrs. Summerland?

101
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,520
Did you forget something?

102
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,888
Yeah, my tablet.

103
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,824
Yeah, right.

104
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,839
Sir?

105
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,783
Sir, I need
you to take your hands

106
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,452
out of your pockets.

107
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:04,224
It's a beautiful
day, don't ya think?

108
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,532
Look, take it easy, okay?

109
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,356
Why didn't you shoot me?

110
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:38,291
It's all right.

111
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,360
It's all right, it's over.

112
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,895
You all right?

113
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:43,963
I'm gonna need you
to put your hands

114
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,299
behind your back, all right?

115
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,413
Amelia!

116
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,714
Carter.

117
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,032
So, Andrew's leaning
up against the bar,

118
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,534
now bear in mind he's really
drunk right now, right?

119
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,670
And this woman, she
saddles up next to him

120
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:00,072
and she says, "When
a woman asks you"

121
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,909
"how old you think she
is, take your best guess"

122
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,411
"and subtract by 10."

123
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:08,615
And Andrew here
just goes, "I did."

124
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,389
Hey, Carter, we're heading
to the Starlight tonight

125
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,225
if you wanna come.

126
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,661
Yeah, I'll see.

127
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:24,698
Tell her hey for me, all right?

128
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,693
Hey beautiful.

129
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,168
Brought you flowers.

130
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,152
I missed you.

131
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,491
Got big news today.

132
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:28,160
It has been exactly
six months this week

133
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,730
since I stopped energy drinks

134
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:34,033
and I've been taking
lunch to work.

135
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:35,034
Mostly.

136
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,124
I thought it was good!

137
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,325
- Really?
- I liked it.

138
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,660
You couldn't have,
you fell asleep.

139
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,661
It was, I...

140
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:37,797
But before that,
before I fell asleep,

141
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:38,965
I thought it was fun.

142
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,400
For three minutes?

143
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,903
Uh-huh.

144
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:47,006
So, what else do you wanna do?

145
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,674
When you're not
ticketing adorable women

146
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,609
for going five over.

147
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,244
Adorable, huh?

148
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,545
And smart.

149
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,181
Okay.

150
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,182
And funny.

151
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:57,017
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

152
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:58,117
Uh-huh.

153
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,186
What do you do?

154
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,388
I don't know.

155
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,657
Really? Come on.

156
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,795
There's got to be somethin'.

157
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,302
Maybe a little
street piano playing?

158
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,738
No, I could

159
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:23,109
never really push a
piano down the street.

160
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,210
Ha!

161
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,845
They are heavy.

162
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,546
Just sayin'.

163
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,615
All right, okay.

164
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:33,787
So you're not very strong,
I got that.

165
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:38,925
How about something you can
do or that you like to do.

166
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:39,926
Anything.

167
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:41,928
Something.

168
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,198
How 'bout I show you?

169
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,199
Okay.

170
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,071
What's that?

171
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,209
Jesus.

172
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,782
Thanks for answering your phone.

173
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,252
I thought you had plans
tonight with the guys.

174
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,253
Yeah.

175
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,624
How are you?

176
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,893
I'm great.

177
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,294
I paid off another installment.

178
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:49,528
I applied for the Wesley grant.

179
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,263
I'm using my site
to raise donations.

180
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,764
Oh.

181
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,701
Thought you said you were two
months behind on your house.

182
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,702
Yeah.

183
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,974
Amelia's got maybe a
few more months, maybe.

184
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,911
But there's still time.

185
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,748
Look, Carter.

186
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,021
I know it's tough
to let go, I get it.

187
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:21,627
If there's anything
you need, let me know.

188
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,196
I need more time.

189
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,901
Every day we learn new
ways to conquer the limits

190
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,970
of the human body.

191
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:34,573
We're approaching new
worlds, new frontiers,

192
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,343
and new possibilities for life.

193
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,979
So, while I thank you for
this award I will tell you,

194
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,014
we are already looking forward

195
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,016
to the students,
to the pioneers,

196
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,351
to the breakthroughs
yet to come.

197
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:48,187
Each day we hear new
ideas, see new projects,

198
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,888
and we meet new heroes.

199
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,890
Here's to building
a better future.

200
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,193
Here's to building
better people.

201
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,268
Of course I can't believe it.

202
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:03,269
Paul Wesley.

203
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,037
Well, congrats.

204
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,272
Well, thank you.

205
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,473
So, Paul Wesley, when
are you gonna start

206
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:08,941
returning my phone calls?

207
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:11,343
When your show stops pandering
to corn fed housewives.

208
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,946
Tell you producers to reach
outside the box they're in.

209
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,214
- Ooh, ouch.
- Ow.

210
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,282
I was referring to
dinner, but I think

211
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,849
I'll rescind the offer.

212
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,351
Good to see ya, Adah.

213
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,187
Take this.

214
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:21,420
Yeah.

215
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,754
I'm on a flight in
30 minutes, Ellen.

216
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,990
What have you got?

217
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:27,159
I think we have a candidate.

218
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,660
The leukemia patient?

219
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,629
No, he's made a full recovery.

220
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,331
That's unfortunate.

221
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:36,202
Amelia Summerland,
age 26, coma patient.

222
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,436
Aneurysm two years ago.

223
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,271
Diagnosis of Locked-in syndrome.

224
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,807
The brain is fully intact
but much left on her body.

225
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:42,975
She's married?

226
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,410
Yes, Carter Summerland.

227
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,345
I'm sorry, do I know you?

228
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:46,612
I'm Paul Wesley.

229
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,347
I believe you applied
for one of my grants.

230
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,916
We need to speak to you
immediately about Amelia.

231
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,818
Any other family
members our lawyers

232
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:53,919
have to worry about?

233
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,854
She's an only child.

234
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:55,788
Her parents are deceased.

235
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,156
Mr. Summerland, do you know

236
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:59,291
what a non-disclosure
agreement is?

237
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,093
Yeah.

238
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,127
Good.

239
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,128
Sign that.

240
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,116
Max, just in time.

241
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,784
Mr. Summerland,
nice to meet you.

242
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,419
Max Parker, lead robotics.

243
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,020
We're excited to
show you the lab.

244
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,522
Right this way.

245
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,525
Now entering
cyber level four, section D.

246
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,995
All right, all non-essential
personnel, clear out.

247
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:13,632
Carter, I want you to
meet Dr. Ellen Beckett.

248
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,334
Very nice to meet
you, Mr. Summerland.

249
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,602
Dr. Beckett is the
chief neurologist

250
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:18,304
for Wesley Enterprises.

251
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,206
She's been studying
Amelia's scans.

252
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:22,040
Most coma patients have seen

253
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,710
significant deterioration
by this point.

254
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,578
I think there's a
wonderful chance

255
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,248
that your wife is
still in there.

256
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,416
Dr. Beckett is the main reason

257
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,483
we've made such progress
in brain injuries

258
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,152
over the past 10 years.

259
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,753
You can fix Amelia?

260
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,222
Better.

261
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,959
Mr. Summerland, I'd
like you to meet Cindy 69.

262
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:43,329
Go ahead, touch her.

263
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,830
This is the latest generation

264
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,833
of the Cindy 69 companion robot.

265
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,235
My design.

266
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,669
Max, couldn't you
have brought down

267
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,171
one of the elderly
assistance models?

268
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,306
But Mr. Wesley,
this model has the latest

269
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,242
biosynthetic flesh, state of...

270
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,043
Online.

271
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,345
That feels real nice.

272
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,579
Sorry.

273
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,281
That feels real nice.

274
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:02,548
Okay, sorry.

275
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,815
- That feels real...
- Sorry about that.

276
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,886
I didn't think she
was activated yet.

277
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,521
I don't understand.

278
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,789
I apologize, Carter.

279
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,691
Max's social skills
aside, you can tell

280
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:16,462
that this technology is
indistinguishable from human flesh.

281
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,665
Mr. Summerland,
we can help Amelia

282
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:23,535
by putting her brain
into a new body.

283
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,770
Into that?

284
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,974
We can build an exact
replica of your wife.

285
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:36,248
Wait, Mr. Summerland,
we can help you.

286
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,483
You wanna help me?

287
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,050
Put Amelia in a better facility.

288
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,187
Find me someone who
understands Locked-in Syndrome.

289
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,088
But that?

290
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:43,389
It's not even human.

291
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,058
We have artificial
hearts, artificial hips.

292
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,760
We've been replacing
worn out parts

293
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:51,363
on ourselves for the
better part of a century.

294
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:52,931
You can't tell me
that's the same thing.

295
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:56,335
Mr. Summerland, can
I put it another way?

296
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,336
Kim.

297
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:03,375
Okay, say I wanted to replace
the front end of this pen.

298
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,546
I take it off, put
a new front end on.

299
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,048
Ta-da, there's my pen.

300
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:12,751
But wait, what if I want to
replace the other half of it?

301
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,686
No problem.

302
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,987
I just unscrew that, right?

303
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,490
Screw a new backend on.

304
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,058
There's my pen.

305
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,162
Uh-oh, but look, here are the
two pieces that I replaced.

306
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:28,066
If I were to put
these back together...

307
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,436
Would that be the original pen?

308
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:33,572
Or is that the original pen now?

309
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,906
Hm?

310
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,075
Do you get it?

311
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:44,750
You've agreed to
complete secrecy.

312
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:48,720
You discuss this with anyone,
the offer's off the table.

313
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,871
I once had a daughter.

314
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:08,740
In five seconds I went
from driving her to school

315
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,077
to a bed just like this one.

316
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,383
We chose Amelia
because she's young.

317
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:20,752
Her mind is healthy and
we know when and how

318
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,588
she's going to die.

319
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,625
We're offering you
the chance to see her,

320
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:28,127
to hold her again.

321
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,502
If I say yes, what happens?

322
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,169
You would sign power of attorney

323
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,538
over to Wesley Enterprises.

324
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,740
You would give consent
on your wife's behalf

325
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,275
to this procedure.

326
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:45,877
When your wife passes
away, they take her body.

327
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:48,480
She gets officially donated
to scientific research,

328
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,981
but we stay discreet.

329
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,351
We then preserve her
brain and begin a process

330
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,652
we call mapping.

331
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,886
How long does that take?

332
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,322
We need to acclimate
her to a new body

333
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,590
and she'll require
therapy, physical, mental.

334
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,560
It's gonna be some time.

335
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,535
We ask that you
comfort us in this time

336
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,003
and for the future.

337
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,105
It is with our faith in you
that we commit her body,

338
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:23,275
her heart, her being,
into your hands.

339
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:29,114
Insiders suggest
something big on the horizon

340
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,817
for the multi-billion
dollar research facility.

341
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,885
Many may remember
Wesley Enterprises

342
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,087
was in a similar situation
just a few years ago.

343
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,023
What else do you wanna do?

344
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,991
When you're not
ticketing adorable women

345
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,693
for going five over.

346
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,663
This isn't just Wesley
Enterprises playing it safe.

347
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:45,864
We've seen literally everything

348
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:46,965
from this company.

349
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,199
Solar powered blankets,

350
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,135
mission heat tiles,
robot sex toys.

351
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,403
I think it's safe...

352
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,572
To expect the unexpected.

353
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,675
Is Paul Wesley sparking
another scientific revolution?

354
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,410
We'll just have to wait and see.

355
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:03,516
And we say they fear

356
00:23:03,517 --> 00:23:05,350
what they do not understand.

357
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:08,554
Talk about some of the good
that Wesley Enterprises...

358
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,205
It is with our faith in you

359
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:30,976
that we commit her
body, heart, her being,

360
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,678
into your hands.

361
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,013
Into your hands.

362
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,649
Hello.

363
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,527
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

364
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:49,462
Step away from each other.

365
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:50,196
Hey, that's enough.

366
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,030
Back off.

367
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:52,263
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

368
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:52,932
You back up and stay there.

369
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,032
Don't move.

370
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,101
- You back off, asshole.
- Do not move.

371
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,769
Oh my God!

372
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,873
Hey, what the fuck
is the matter with you?

373
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,510
Hey!

374
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,546
Get in the car.

375
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,449
I wrote a poem.

376
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,567
What about the soul?

377
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:32,003
What about the fact that we
are created in God's own image?

378
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:34,272
Quite frankly, I'm shocked
that a Nobel Prize winner

379
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,107
like Dr. Beckett
would engage in work

380
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,309
that seems to suggest that
being human is nothing special.

381
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,578
Which on the face of it...

382
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,580
Actually, Senator,
I think human beings

383
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:45,250
are extremely special
and worth saving.

384
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:48,286
Senator, if someone has
early stage Alzheimer's,

385
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:50,255
then if the technology
that she advocates

386
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,958
becomes reality, it
could save them, correct?

387
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,227
I believe there's a reason
why we don't live forever.

388
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,462
We're not meant to.

389
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,030
Human beings weren't
meant to fly either.

390
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,699
We weren't meant
to travel in space.

391
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,734
We weren't meant to
talk to each other

392
00:25:02,735 --> 00:25:04,135
from across the world.

393
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,370
- Doctor...
- Dialysis,

394
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:08,206
heart transplants,
bypass surgery.

395
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,543
You're familiar with that
one, aren't ya, Senator?

396
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,745
Well, since I see you
wish to make this personal,

397
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,146
I'd just throw that
question right back at you.

398
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,582
That's a good
point, Dr. Beckett.

399
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,250
Many are familiar with the
tragedy that took your daughter.

400
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,186
Are you saying in
theory you'd really

401
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,454
be willing to
replace her this way?

402
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,090
Don't you think as
her mother that might

403
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,592
cheapen her memory?

404
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:29,661
If you see what we're doing
as Frankensteining someone.

405
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,096
Which is absolutely

406
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,130
- not the case.
- That is exactly

407
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,364
what you're doing.

408
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,200
We are talking
about transplants.

409
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,869
The idea behind the technology
that God has given us?

410
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,170
That's not the problem.

411
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,073
But with what some
people might do with it.

412
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,274
This theory

413
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,076
- that Dr. Beckett...
- This is not

414
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:45,443
a theory, Senator.

415
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,378
This will happen.

416
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,116
You will see us save someone's
life with this technology.

417
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:54,152
And you will know that we did it

418
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,588
and not your God.

419
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,224
That did not help us.

420
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,926
These people don't
care about science, Paul.

421
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:02,427
We're trying to lay
the groundwork here

422
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,629
to gain some credibility.

423
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:05,230
You can't go off book like that.

424
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,133
Since when did credibility
involve arguing with the right?

425
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:10,101
That's the conversation
you shouldn't be having.

426
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:13,104
It validates their opinions.

427
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,405
Dr. Beckett, you need

428
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,641
to come downstairs immediately.

429
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:16,642
Why?

430
00:26:17,944 --> 00:26:20,946
Her patterns spike when
we speak directly to her.

431
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,947
Watch.

432
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:27,219
She knows that I'm speaking
specifically to her.

433
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:33,825
Amelia.

434
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,126
Ellen.

435
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36,695
Paul.

436
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:37,696
Max.

437
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,234
Amelia.

438
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:47,505
Okay, let me try something.

439
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,207
Hundreds of years of
research and discovery

440
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,542
and the fix might be as
simple as a light bulb.

441
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,078
What are you talking about?

442
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,112
Voltage.

443
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,781
Activity increase.

444
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,849
Consciousness to level six.

445
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,931
Beginning voltage
increase in 10,

446
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,165
nine,

447
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:15,233
eight,

448
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,467
seven,

449
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,635
six,

450
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:18,670
five,

451
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:19,671
four,

452
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,872
three,

453
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,007
two,

454
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,008
one.

455
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,778
Subject is online.

456
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,658
Amelia,

457
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,296
can you hear me?

458
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,039
Do you know where you are?

459
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:02,548
Do you know who you are?

460
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:14,025
Can you tell me your name?

461
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:27,305
I'm Amelia Summerland.

462
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:41,087
I know, I know, I know, I know.

463
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:42,889
Wait, wait.

464
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,823
Quiet, quiet everybody.

465
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,091
Oh shit.

466
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:46,926
Heart stop.

467
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,093
Heart stop!

468
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:49,427
- Stop it.
- Get a hold of her.

469
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,565
You're safe.

470
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,665
You're safe, Amelia.

471
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,034
You're safe.

472
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,368
You're safe.

473
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,013
We've lost everything.

474
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:10,381
We need to tell her.

475
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:11,649
She won't be able to handle it.

476
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,750
It couldn't possibly be worse

477
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,353
than the episode we just had.

478
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,655
Blunt her emotions.

479
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,325
It'll keep her calm.

480
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,471
So, um, what that means, Amelia,

481
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:36,341
is that you will never age.

482
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,243
You'll never get sick.

483
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:40,278
You'll never die.

484
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,949
You're still you, Amelia, but...

485
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,517
You're different now.

486
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:49,755
Tell me what you're
thinking, Amelia.

487
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,160
Who are all of you?

488
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,867
Wesley Enterprises
experienced a record low

489
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,801
last quarter but
remain optimistic.

490
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,203
Insiders suggest something big...

491
00:30:05,204 --> 00:30:06,304
I want to announce it.

492
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,505
She's not ready.

493
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:08,773
She's talking,
for the love of God.

494
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,608
She struggles
with motor control.

495
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,177
She can't walk
without assistance.

496
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:13,979
Her nervous system
is a disaster.

497
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,746
The interface, it overclocks.

498
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,948
The computer can't keep up.

499
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,217
She's had several
catastrophic failures.

500
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:23,389
When the computer resets,
we have to completely rebuild.

501
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,626
We're six days from an
update with the board.

502
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:30,328
We have to make something up.

503
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,063
How long does it
take to rebuild?

504
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,431
Weeks.

505
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,400
I mean, it's not a simple.
23 hours to be

506
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:35,634
- precise.
- Process.

507
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,802
Here's what we're gonna do.

508
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:38,770
We're gonna put
her back on line.

509
00:30:38,771 --> 00:30:40,005
I'm letting Carter meet her.

510
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:41,472
It's too soon.

511
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,975
We have to have something
to show these people.

512
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:45,410
Imagine how they're gonna react

513
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:46,978
when they see Carter
reunited with his dead wife.

514
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:48,980
The emotional stimuli
might cause another failure.

515
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:49,916
We have to do something.

516
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,116
What about Carter?

517
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,583
I'm worried what
that might do to him.

518
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,588
I'm worried about keeping
this project funded.

519
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,146
Carter.

520
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,180
Amelia.

521
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,620
You have a visitor.

522
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,819
Hello.

523
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,889
We'll be right outside.

524
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:46,031
Do you know what
they did with my ring?

525
00:32:46,032 --> 00:32:47,033
Your ring?

526
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,070
It's been missing
since I woke up.

527
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,421
They wouldn't let me see you.

528
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,422
Why not?

529
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,130
They said there's
things they don't want us

530
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,632
to talk about yet.

531
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:28,173
They said it's the only
way that you'll get better.

532
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,175
Am I sick?

533
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,513
Not anymore.

534
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,417
Then why do I
need to get better?

535
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:40,918
Millie.

536
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,490
There's something in my ear.

537
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,425
I can feel it there.

538
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:48,893
I'll talk to the doctors.

539
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:49,894
My ring.

540
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,365
Can I have it back now, please?

541
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,502
Of course.

542
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,425
I never stopped believing.

543
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,562
I don't understand.

544
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,630
Who are you?

545
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,734
I can feel my hand stall now.

546
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,734
Really?

547
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,405
What?

548
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:36,907
Somebody get in here!

549
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,709
Get back.

550
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,976
Move!

551
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:39,977
Tell me what's happening.

552
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:42,180
Get her legs.

553
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,514
Don't worry, Carter,
this has happened before.

554
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,815
Get her to the chair.

555
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,083
One, two, up.

556
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,718
Tell me what's happening!

557
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,421
Mr. Summerland,
you need to leave.

558
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,223
Mr. Summerland, you
need to leave now.

559
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:54,559
What are you doing to my wife?

560
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,029
What are you doing to my wife?

561
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,298
Get control of her, Max.

562
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:02,733
I'm workin' on it!

563
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:54,619
Don't look.

564
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,254
We noticed when Ellen
would play Mozart

565
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:59,390
over the intercom your
brain activity would spike.

566
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:03,594
So, we figured this
might help you redevelop

567
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:06,030
some of those
broken connections.

568
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,033
And this little present.

569
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:13,771
This is a textbook example
of art meeting science.

570
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,574
When Dr. Beckett
developed microbes

571
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:20,445
that specifically target
cells to help them grow,

572
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:23,080
this was the first
clinical subject.

573
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:26,418
This plant hasn't
aged in over a decade.

574
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:30,822
So it's...

575
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:33,758
Real?

576
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,460
Absolutely.

577
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:38,297
But just, you know,
not all of it.

578
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,733
I guess it's like you.

579
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,034
Like me.

580
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:46,572
You are Amelia.

581
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:55,112
I don't remember if I played.

582
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,213
Oh, don't worry.

583
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,315
It's easy, here.

584
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,349
We're just gonna do the basics.

585
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,550
I'll show you.

586
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,551
Come look.

587
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:02,687
This is C.

588
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,725
Go ahead, play it.

589
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,129
What are you feeling?

590
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,130
Nothing.

591
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:16,967
Okay.

592
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:19,337
I'm gonna try
something different.

593
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,238
You're gonna feel something
completely different,

594
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:25,076
but it's a good feeling,
so don't worry, okay?

595
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,515
Emotions
processing unit reacting.

596
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,851
Okay, play it again.

597
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:45,596
That...

598
00:37:47,533 --> 00:37:48,700
is beautiful.

599
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,871
Okay, play it again.

600
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,006
But take it easy, okay?

601
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,577
Your mind's trying to catch up.

602
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:10,822
That's music.

603
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,240
It wasn't my decision to
introduce her to you yet.

604
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,309
She wasn't ready.

605
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,146
We found the problem
and fixed it.

606
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,488
Why isn't she moving?

607
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,956
She's in standby mode.

608
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,958
Unaware of anything around
her until we give her

609
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:51,028
the verbal command
to wake up again.

610
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,598
It's like sleeping.

611
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,865
- No.
- Carter.

612
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,300
You have her on
a remote control?

613
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,535
It's not like that.

614
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,370
This isn't right.

615
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,304
She was at peace.

616
00:38:59,305 --> 00:39:00,671
Carter, please, please.

617
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:01,507
I understand.

618
00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:02,873
I really do.

619
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,478
It looks very strange
seeing her like this.

620
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,150
Where is your
daughter now, Ellen?

621
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:15,520
I beg your pardon?

622
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,488
Where is her body?

623
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,723
Carter.

624
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:20,090
Where is she.

625
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,427
In the ground.

626
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,864
Where is Amelia?

627
00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:37,408
Find a different test subject.

628
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,745
You know we can't do that.

629
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,186
Wesley Enterprises,
the tech giant

630
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,788
positioned in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa...

631
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:52,857
Shocked the world today
when founder Paul Wesley

632
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:55,493
announced what he says is
the first successful copy

633
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,994
of a human brain.

634
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:59,430
This will give new hope
to Alzheimer's patients,

635
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,366
to parapalegics, to those
suffering from terminal illness.

636
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,268
Our Amelia

637
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,502
is the future.

638
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:06,671
Wesley released
no images of Amelia,

639
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:09,173
but promised to unveil her
publicly three months from now.

640
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:10,675
Wesley's announcement
sent shock waves

641
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:13,143
through both the medical
and religious communities.

642
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,645
Protestors rallied
outside the capital

643
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,280
calling for strict legislation...

644
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:19,550
That clearly defined the
definition of human and machine.

645
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,286
Proponents of the new technology
suggest current definitions

646
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,422
are vague and open
to interpretation.

647
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,625
My colleagues, it would
be foolish to suggest

648
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:31,095
that the world would be
better off without technology.

649
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:34,899
Without our advanced care
for the sick and elderly.

650
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,402
But these technologies
work in harmony

651
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:41,706
with the human spirit,
not against it.

652
00:40:41,707 --> 00:40:43,974
These are gifts from God

653
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:47,912
and if we attempt to
escape from these gifts,

654
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:51,482
to reach higher than we
were intended to reach,

655
00:40:51,483 --> 00:40:55,086
we will have become
arrogant and foolhardy.

656
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,924
Hi, Carter, this
is Senator Williams office.

657
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:01,191
We received your message.

658
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,460
We'd like to speak with
you as soon as possible.

659
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,019
More of her memories are turning

660
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,656
but four weeks to
play Twinkle Twinkle?

661
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:32,890
I am sorry, Max.

662
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,491
Oh no, no, no,
it's not your fault.

663
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,226
Don't apologize.

664
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:39,296
The important thing is that
you're making progress.

665
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:40,330
And that is good?

666
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,033
It's very good, Amelia,

667
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,836
considering most of what you
remember was left in fragments.

668
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:50,741
We have the data here showing
you're making huge strides.

669
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,977
Yesterday you told us a story,

670
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,879
the one in the park.

671
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,214
Do you remember?

672
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,515
Yes.

673
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,826
I'm by a lake.

674
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,294
I jump in.

675
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:14,065
This other man does, too, but
I can't remember his face.

676
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:21,907
Some kids nearby
are laughing at us.

677
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,147
My face is underwater.

678
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,154
I can feel summer.

679
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,590
Now we're sitting under a tree.

680
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,891
I'm reading a poem to the man,

681
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,161
something I wrote, I think.

682
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:52,870
I can't remember his face.

683
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,905
We're walking through a garden.

684
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,174
There's a dance by.

685
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,110
I don't understand why.

686
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,648
There's a feeling of happiness.

687
00:43:07,052 --> 00:43:08,987
A girl walks in, she...

688
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:13,123
I want you to keep
thinking about that, Amelia,

689
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,892
that exact moment.

690
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:18,428
Everything is blurring
together, Dr. Beckett.

691
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,496
Where is the ring?

692
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,067
The screeching...

693
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:24,068
sound.

694
00:43:32,678 --> 00:43:36,814
Warning.

695
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:42,821
All systems offline.

696
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,657
Well, it's very strange.

697
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:48,759
It's too unpredictable.

698
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,828
There's nothing about
what she remembers

699
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,997
that makes any sense.

700
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,000
She needs information.

701
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,435
She doesn't know what to do

702
00:43:58,436 --> 00:44:01,072
with the information
she has now.

703
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,574
Just keep her playing scales.

704
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:06,010
Understood?

705
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:07,078
Understood.

706
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,424
Build.

707
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,658
Good morning.

708
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:28,165
That's one of the few
advantages being a computer

709
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,500
has over humans.

710
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,569
The dreams, they're
more vivid, right?

711
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,841
Yeah, your mind is more free
to create than an organic one.

712
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,809
In fact, if I hadn't
fixed a small glitch,

713
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,711
your brain wouldn't
be able to distinguish

714
00:44:40,712 --> 00:44:42,813
dreams from reality.

715
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,281
Incredible, right?

716
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,884
Look at this, look.

717
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,053
See that?

718
00:44:49,054 --> 00:44:53,423
Every time I look at
these scans, I see growth.

719
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,925
Very important.

720
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:57,161
Look at all this growth,
all these new connections.

721
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:59,596
It's amazing, actually.

722
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,833
Looking at the mathematical
equivalent of your mind.

723
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,969
You can see my thoughts?

724
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:08,807
It's like looking at,
like a jpeg in binary.

725
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,241
Yeah.

726
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:15,079
Do you know, when I was
working on my thesis years ago,

727
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,948
I spent two years
with a neurosurgeon.

728
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:22,286
He likened the brain to more
of a plant than a computer.

729
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:24,054
He said the task
of making a mind

730
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,423
had nothing to do
with making it smart.

731
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:28,525
You had to make something
that was capable

732
00:45:28,526 --> 00:45:30,260
of growing on its own.

733
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:34,698
Like, even something so simple
as a tree or our flower.

734
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,666
It's infinitely more...

735
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:41,305
Hello?

736
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:42,306
Hey?

737
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:47,978
You're not paying attention.

738
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:48,979
Sorry.

739
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,950
Max, can you tell me something?

740
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,052
Sure.

741
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:58,957
Am I still able to be a wife?

742
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,263
Yeah, of course.

743
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,933
I designed your body
to be 100% functional

744
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,634
for sexual activity.

745
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:11,668
You did?

746
00:46:11,669 --> 00:46:14,338
Yeah.

747
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:15,339
Yeah.

748
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,142
Yes.

749
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,278
I used to head up a
love robot project.

750
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,479
Can you believe that?

751
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,951
I couldn't help but
pour a few things over.

752
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:30,087
There's some things you're
gonna have to do to, um...

753
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:32,157
prep the system, kind of.

754
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,594
Ah, can we talk
about something else?

755
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:41,899
I guess having children
is out of the question?

756
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,900
Yeah.

757
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,713
How long were
you married when it happened?

758
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,849
Three months.

759
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:02,954
Hm, well, any time is too
soon, but that is unfortunate.

760
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,323
She had an aneurysm.

761
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,925
It broke the connection
to her spinal cord

762
00:47:07,926 --> 00:47:10,995
but not enough to
damage the brain.

763
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:14,131
I thought they could
just repair her.

764
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:15,532
That's what they promised you?

765
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:18,302
Not the way I thought.

766
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:19,303
Hm.

767
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,572
Well, Sam.

768
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,741
Well, you're right to be
angry, Mr. Summerland,

769
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:26,476
but for the wrong reasons.

770
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:29,279
I want you to meet my chief
policy officer and advisor.

771
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,280
Sam.

772
00:47:32,817 --> 00:47:36,053
Sam Patterson is an
old friend and he and I

773
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,956
have followed Wesley's
developments for quite some time.

774
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:40,557
Hi, Carter.

775
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,026
The senator sent
me your message.

776
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:43,860
I'm sorry to hear
what's happened here.

777
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,164
This is why we have been
on this from the start.

778
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:51,068
Carter, did they ask you a
lot of questions about Amelia?

779
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:52,502
Of course.

780
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,404
Did they ask you for
photographs of you together,

781
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,006
private journals?

782
00:47:56,007 --> 00:47:57,241
Photos, yes.

783
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:58,442
Journals, home movies?

784
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,377
Yeah, whatever I
could get my hands on.

785
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:04,015
They said it would help
return her memories.

786
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:08,118
Is this a deposition?

787
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,921
Are you familiar
with spiritual mediums?

788
00:48:10,922 --> 00:48:12,089
Excuse me?

789
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,557
They use techniques
to fool people.

790
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,760
They say general things
like, "I see a person dying"

791
00:48:16,761 --> 00:48:19,096
"from the chest," ooh.

792
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:23,367
Well, most deaths do occur,
statistically, from the heart,

793
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:25,102
so it's not a bad guess.

794
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:28,138
But not to the
person who just lost

795
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:29,573
a father to a heart attack.

796
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,041
It's emotional manipulation.

797
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:32,442
Carter, what they've built?

798
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,144
It's not your wife.

799
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:35,345
It's an imitation.

800
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,248
You believe it because,

801
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:41,251
well, you wanna believe it.

802
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,887
They're counting on
people to react that way

803
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:46,056
in order to sell
what they wanna sell.

804
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:47,225
Immortality.

805
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,827
People will pay
ungodly amounts of money

806
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:53,230
to have a chance
to fly in space.

807
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:56,633
You think they won't pay at
least a million for this?

808
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,102
Carter, most live
their lives day to day,

809
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:02,406
like you I imagine,
until something happens.

810
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,008
You're dancing through
a big beautiful field

811
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:07,077
and then suddenly a
snake jumps out and bites

812
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:11,249
and the reality of our fragile
lives is suddenly exposed.

813
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,986
We run to the one thing that
we understand to be true.

814
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:17,021
Well, I don't know
what's true here,

815
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,255
but I know what's not.

816
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:22,359
For now, you can fix
this if you help us.

817
00:49:26,597 --> 00:49:28,765
If Congress passes
the Humanity Act

818
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,335
it will become illegal
to copy or sell

819
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:34,771
any element of the human
brain for monetary gain?

820
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:36,306
Correct.

821
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,942
I think the most obvious
critique of your viewpoint

822
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:42,112
is that it forbids others
from making a choice.

823
00:49:42,113 --> 00:49:44,114
It's a false choice.

824
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:46,383
It's something that takes
advantage of people.

825
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:49,120
Mr. Summerland
can speak to that.

826
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:52,623
Mr. Summerland?

827
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,234
What she is now,

828
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:07,004
it's not her.

829
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,043
They took my wife.

830
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,816
Carter, you said that
they took your wife.

831
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:23,687
I assume you signed consent
papers, did you not?

832
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:24,821
She was dying.

833
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,223
I didn't know what to do.

834
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:28,158
I think that most
people would question

835
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,627
why you signed in
the first place.

836
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:35,332
Well then, you have no
idea what it feels like.

837
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:38,268
We need to change
the spin on this.

838
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,437
I got a call from Adah Allen's
producers this morning.

839
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:42,806
They want a one-on-one
interview with Amelia.

840
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:44,909
No way, absolutely not.

841
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,212
Of course you're okay with this.

842
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:50,080
We need to get ahead of
William somehow, otherwise...

843
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:52,516
We are not having this
conversation again, Paul.

844
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,485
In 12 years you
have not ever once

845
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,987
rushed one of my projects, ever.

846
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,256
Which is why you
need to humor me.

847
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:01,658
For 12 years I funded
this humanitarian work.

848
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,460
Don't make this about
the goddamn money, Paul.

849
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,395
I've given you a full
staff with technicians

850
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,931
for four years, not to mention
the cost with prototypes

851
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:09,533
and materials and
security and mark...

852
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:11,501
The work we are doing takes time

853
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:12,902
and you need to respect that.

854
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,238
We don't have
the luxury of time.

855
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:16,106
Paul we are making
progress, but you...

856
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:17,108
No, Ellen!

857
00:51:19,644 --> 00:51:21,479
Do not destroy this.

858
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:33,124
Just get Amelia ready.

859
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:38,662
Got big news today.

860
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:41,398
It has been exactly
six months this week

861
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,267
since I stopped energy drinks.

862
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:46,836
And I've been taking
lunch to work.

863
00:52:00,985 --> 00:52:01,985
I had...

864
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,055
another dream.

865
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:09,594
Okay, why don't
you tell me about it.

866
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,331
I remember Carter.

867
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:16,867
I remember everything.

868
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,872
It's all come back.

869
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:23,873
Everything.

870
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,743
Okay, wow.

871
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:29,813
Wow!

872
00:52:31,282 --> 00:52:32,282
Okay.

873
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:36,753
I need to leave this place.

874
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,022
I need to find my husband.

875
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,858
Okay, shh, shh, shh.

876
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:45,729
Okay.

877
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,240
Hello?

878
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,112
Carter?

879
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:15,585
Yes?

880
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:18,856
Where are you?

881
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,828
Um...

882
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:27,998
Carter, why haven't
you been to see me?

883
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,401
I miss you.

884
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:32,402
I love you.

885
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:13,844
Beginning security lockdown.

886
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:28,525
You are not allowed to do that.

887
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:30,326
What do you mean I'm
not allowed to do that?

888
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,929
Just like I'm not allowed
to contact Carter?

889
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,831
God, what is wrong
with you people?

890
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:37,167
You can't just keep me here.

891
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,541
She doesn't log in
again for any reason,

892
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,042
do you understand?

893
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,311
I'm sorry, but how much
longer can we keep her here?

894
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:49,713
You know what would
happen if she got out there.

895
00:55:49,714 --> 00:55:51,448
She doesn't have rights.

896
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,684
Will you stop that, please?

897
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,159
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

898
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,672
I don't have rights?

899
00:56:15,673 --> 00:56:17,675
Amelia, you scared me.

900
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:26,249
Can you appreciate the magnitude

901
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,186
of everything that's
going on here?

902
00:56:30,421 --> 00:56:32,589
Now, you're saying
that electrical impulses

903
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:33,657
in the brain...

904
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:34,658
Oh, God.

905
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,461
I hate television.

906
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:41,297
I have to boil down
everything, all of the work,

907
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:43,967
research, nuances,
discoveries, everything

908
00:56:43,968 --> 00:56:46,904
into something so
completely basic.

909
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:49,173
It's stupid.

910
00:56:51,776 --> 00:56:53,277
But you know what?

911
00:56:56,514 --> 00:56:57,514
It worked.

912
00:56:58,749 --> 00:56:59,749
How?

913
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:03,987
Every day we learn
new ways to conquer

914
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,955
the limits of the human body,

915
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:08,057
and yet there are still
so many barriers to cross.

916
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:09,627
Goddamn it, Paul.

917
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,767
How do you feel about going
on national television?

918
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:20,771
Convincing the world
of what you are

919
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:25,543
is the first step toward
your independence.

920
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,384
Okay.

921
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:48,098
We're very excited to
introduce you, you know?

922
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:53,402
And, like magic, there she is.

923
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:57,373
Adah Allen, I want you to
meet Amelia Summerland.

924
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:01,979
Hello, Adah Allen.

925
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:09,886
Paul, what is going on?

926
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:11,254
You know what,
maybe we should not

927
00:58:11,255 --> 00:58:12,922
do this today.

928
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,758
I'm totally messing with you.

929
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:15,593
Totally messing with you.

930
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:16,527
Hi, I'm Amelia.

931
00:58:16,528 --> 00:58:18,695
It's so nice to meet you.

932
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,930
Decontamination complete.

933
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,700
Welcome to my home.

934
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:25,334
Your home?

935
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,770
Well, yeah, for the time being.

936
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:28,004
We have every intention
of returning Amelia

937
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:30,439
to her life once
testing is finished.

938
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,508
I think if you
interview Max and Ellen

939
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,344
with Amelia alongside and
then do some demonstration...

940
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:36,746
Yeah, that'll be a part of it,

941
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,816
but I want to talk
to Amelia directly

942
00:58:39,817 --> 00:58:42,719
about her life now
and about Carter.

943
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,253
No.

944
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,723
I told you we can't do that,
not with a pending lawsuit.

945
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:48,091
The viewers wanna know.

946
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:49,793
We need to show the full Amelia.

947
00:58:49,794 --> 00:58:52,328
The story is about
Amelia, not the legal case.

948
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:54,931
Exactly, the story's
supposed to be about Amelia.

949
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:57,300
Her own husband doesn't
wanna talk to her,

950
00:58:57,301 --> 00:59:00,036
Congress is debating whether
to shut this program down.

951
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,806
Come on, how do you expect
me not to talk about that?

952
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:04,540
That topic is off limits.

953
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,576
There's no point in us being
here if we don't get this.

954
00:59:06,577 --> 00:59:07,911
No, you're trying to paint some

955
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:08,879
conspiracy here,
Okay, Paul you're wasting

956
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:09,814
our time,

957
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:11,247
and I'm not gonna let you.

958
00:59:11,248 --> 00:59:12,182
And painting a fake
picture of your corporation

959
00:59:12,183 --> 00:59:13,783
is the least of my concerns.

960
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:14,752
And above all...

961
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:15,752
Quiet!

962
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:20,825
You've actually
talked to Carter?

963
00:59:22,126 --> 00:59:24,694
We thought that was
information best kept for later.

964
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:27,330
This is why you blocked
my network access?

965
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:28,165
Okay, enough.

966
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:29,699
She's not doing this.

967
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,135
You're concerned about some
soon to be forgotten lawsuit

968
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:34,270
and we have the most
advanced scientific feat

969
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,705
right here in front of us.

970
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:39,843
We're concerned about whatever
Amelia is concerned about.

971
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:42,747
That's what the
people want to see.

972
00:59:43,748 --> 00:59:46,016
I want to talk to Carter.

973
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,986
Amelia, do this interview

974
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:53,490
and you can tell Carter
whatever you want.

975
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:04,368
Well, I guess it's in
your hands, Mr. Wesley.

976
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:13,377
Get out of my way.

977
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:17,546
Roll open.

978
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,315
Stand by to dissolve
to one after the open.

979
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:22,719
Challenge,
inspire, inform, and heal.

980
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,488
It's Adah Allen Live.

981
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,559
Amelia, thank you for
agreeing to do this interview.

982
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,795
Thanks for comin' here.

983
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:32,996
Thank you.

984
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:36,733
I am nervous.

985
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,168
Really? How so?

986
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,270
Cameras.

987
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:43,372
People watching, kind of, um,

988
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,641
feeling the pressure, you know?

989
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,712
What I actually mean is,
some people may be asking

990
01:00:48,713 --> 01:00:52,548
how it's possible for you
to even feel nervousness

991
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:54,884
considering what you are.

992
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:56,585
How did you feel
when you realized

993
01:00:56,586 --> 01:00:59,856
that you were no longer human?

994
01:00:59,857 --> 01:01:02,625
Kind of a loaded
question, don't you think?

995
01:01:02,626 --> 01:01:03,893
Why?

996
01:01:03,894 --> 01:01:06,696
'Cause it assumes that
I believe I'm not human.

997
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:09,733
Yeah, but you are
not flesh and blood.

998
01:01:09,734 --> 01:01:10,901
No, I'm not.

999
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:16,639
But human means different
things to different people.

1000
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,007
I would agree, actually.

1001
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,208
I would.

1002
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,443
So, then I'm gonna
rephrase that.

1003
01:01:20,444 --> 01:01:23,246
How did it feel
when you realized

1004
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:25,582
that your old body was gone?

1005
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,757
Conflicted.

1006
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:39,362
It was...

1007
01:01:42,332 --> 01:01:45,102
shocking to not
have a heartbeat.

1008
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,111
I didn't really like
myself at first.

1009
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:59,784
But then I remembered
that I spent two years

1010
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:04,288
in a hospital bed
watching the world go by.

1011
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:10,294
It's like I was dead already.

1012
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:14,464
So, to have a new body...

1013
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,804
And to be able to speak again.

1014
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,373
It's just this huge gift.

1015
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:25,742
I'm sure it is.

1016
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,445
But I think you would
agree that there

1017
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:31,280
are going to be people out there

1018
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:34,684
that are going to have
a challenging time

1019
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:40,490
in accepting you for
who and what you are.

1020
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,328
Some are calling you
a sin against God.

1021
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:46,863
And that's a direct quote

1022
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:50,900
from Republican Senator
Thaddeus Williams.

1023
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:52,601
- Really?
- Yes.

1024
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,770
Guess I'm not votin'
for him next fall.

1025
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:57,340
You have a wicked sense

1026
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:58,975
- of humor.
- I do.

1027
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:01,077
I would say that a
great sense of humor

1028
01:03:01,078 --> 01:03:03,612
definitely makes us human,

1029
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,782
and certainly makes you
human in my opinion.

1030
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,485
But I'm gonna change
it up a little

1031
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,756
and ask you about
your husband, Carter.

1032
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:17,593
My husband's been through a lot.

1033
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:18,627
Well yeah, but to be fair,

1034
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,231
you've both been through a lot.

1035
01:03:22,366 --> 01:03:23,300
Goodnight.

1036
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,234
And the last time he saw you

1037
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:29,238
you had quite a
catastrophic meltdown.

1038
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,074
I don't remember any of that.

1039
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:32,541
From what I was told, the
reason you don't remember

1040
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,378
is because the
physical components

1041
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:39,415
that house your memory,
they literally melted.

1042
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:41,017
And so, I think
this is where people

1043
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:44,053
are gonna struggle
with the idea of you.

1044
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,856
As human as you are and
as humorous as you are,

1045
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:50,159
but on those physical levels,
see you as only a robot

1046
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,561
and that you are
not the real person

1047
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,898
that you quite represent.

1048
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:56,365
Yeah.

1049
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:59,536
What do you say
to people like that?

1050
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,913
I'm not an expert
on spirituality, Adah.

1051
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:11,448
Or medicine.

1052
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,921
I taught fifth grade.

1053
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:24,895
Then one day everything
just stopped.

1054
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:32,202
But one thing got me through.

1055
01:04:33,503 --> 01:04:36,006
My husband never gave up on me

1056
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:41,277
and every day I knew
he would be there,

1057
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:42,612
holding my hand,

1058
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:46,649
playing me music.

1059
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:49,319
Reminding you of who you were?

1060
01:04:51,922 --> 01:04:56,093
But still, your husband, as
dedicated and devoted as he is,

1061
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:02,199
is also going through
his own emotional

1062
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:06,403
and moral struggles
with what you are.

1063
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,608
And consequently, who you are.

1064
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:16,479
And I know that's
got to be heartbreaking.

1065
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,482
So, if Carter were here,

1066
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,119
looking at you,

1067
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:27,823
and you can look
back into his eyes,

1068
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:29,826
what would you tell him?

1069
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,370
Carter,

1070
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,177
Carter it's me.

1071
01:05:51,048 --> 01:05:52,048
It's me.

1072
01:06:06,096 --> 01:06:10,267
Amelia, are you up to sharing
with us what you've learned?

1073
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:13,936
Now?

1074
01:06:13,937 --> 01:06:14,937
Please.

1075
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,327
I read your offer.

1076
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:13,062
I don't think I understand.

1077
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:14,763
They dropped the
restraining order,

1078
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,234
so you can see her, and
if Amelia convinces you

1079
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:21,137
that it is she,
you drop the suit?

1080
01:07:21,138 --> 01:07:24,039
Carter, in the three
days since that interview,

1081
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,609
complaints are
flooding our offices.

1082
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:29,312
The Humanity Act may not
even leave the Senate.

1083
01:07:29,313 --> 01:07:31,547
Things are very
precarious right now.

1084
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,016
And you drop this bomb?

1085
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:35,384
I understand your objections.

1086
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:38,787
Do you understand
this, Mr. Summerland?

1087
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:39,956
I have cancer.

1088
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,227
I may not last out my term.

1089
01:07:46,096 --> 01:07:47,363
I didn't know.

1090
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:48,564
Of course you didn't.

1091
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,133
There was no way
you could've known.

1092
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,935
I haven't even
told my family yet.

1093
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:55,171
If I did, my family
would want me to consider

1094
01:07:55,172 --> 01:07:57,573
the Wesley procedure, so
don't just stand there

1095
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,175
and think it's all about you.

1096
01:07:59,176 --> 01:08:02,411
If you don't help me
put a stop to this,

1097
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:06,583
Wesley Enterprise will
continue to commit this sin.

1098
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:08,851
Again and again!

1099
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:10,486
Senator, I'm aware
of all that you've done

1100
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,321
and I really can't
thank you enough...

1101
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:15,158
Yes, you can, by
being true to your word.

1102
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:16,759
I made a promise to Amelia.

1103
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,595
A promise to Amelia?

1104
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,764
She is not real.

1105
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:25,701
Look, I can not stand
here as a man of God...

1106
01:08:25,702 --> 01:08:27,304
To hell with God.

1107
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,641
All right.

1108
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:34,643
This how you wanna proceed?

1109
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:37,414
I can not support
you, I'm sorry.

1110
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,516
This isn't political, Carter.

1111
01:08:40,517 --> 01:08:42,318
It never is.

1112
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,752
You people are ones to talk.

1113
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:44,753
Listen...

1114
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:50,294
You're here because
you know instinctively

1115
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:55,432
that you need to defend
something valuable and precious.

1116
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:01,404
But you don't know what
that thing is, Carter.

1117
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:02,638
I know exactly what it is, Sam.

1118
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:03,839
Amelia Summerland.

1119
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:07,042
That's the face
that it takes for you.

1120
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:08,612
For me it's my son.

1121
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,750
I see God every
time I look at him.

1122
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:16,051
Other people, it's
something else,

1123
01:09:16,052 --> 01:09:18,121
but it's the same inside.

1124
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,891
You need to ask yourself this,

1125
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:26,330
how can you truly help
Amelia Summerland?

1126
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:29,965
And others?

1127
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:43,579
Senator?

1128
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:46,716
Come with me.

1129
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,921
Excuse me?

1130
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:55,023
If we go there
together and I prove

1131
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,992
to everyone she's a fake,

1132
01:09:56,993 --> 01:10:01,064
wouldn't that reverse
what's happening right now?

1133
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,132
I don't even know anymore.

1134
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,068
Well, if that's the case

1135
01:10:05,069 --> 01:10:06,134
then it doesn't even matter.

1136
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:07,903
Listen, you're upset.

1137
01:10:07,904 --> 01:10:09,872
You're not coping well.

1138
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:11,307
It doesn't matter
what the truth is.

1139
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:13,342
You're gonna believe
it no matter what.

1140
01:10:13,343 --> 01:10:14,810
Well, I could say the same thing

1141
01:10:14,811 --> 01:10:17,381
about a lot of what you preach.

1142
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:32,995
How are you feeling, Amelia?

1143
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:35,197
If you could see
your daughter again,

1144
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:38,201
someone like me,
what would you say?

1145
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:48,243
I don't know.

Senator, I'm sure you remember
the terms as well as I do.

1149
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,698
I hope you remember
all the terms.

1150
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:11,500
He gets as long as he
wants in there with her.

1151
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:14,870
No television crews
during, no technicians,

1152
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,539
just the two of them.

1153
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,573
Of course.

I, uh...

1159

It's okay.

1160
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:39,154
I had this entire page written

1161
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:41,758
of what I was gonna say to you.

1162
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:03,580
You kiss like she did.

1163
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,417
Carter.

1164
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:10,686
They were so thorough.

1165
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:14,858
Your breathing, even that
little scar on your lip.

1166
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,896
I don't know what you are,
but you aren't Amelia.

1167
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,565
I am Amelia.

1168
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,734
No, no, Amelia, my wife?

1169
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:28,871
Had a soul.

1170
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:31,507
I have a soul.

1171
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:36,045
You know I do.

1172
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:42,586
Part of you still believes.

1173
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:49,758
Do you remember the
day at the lake?

1174
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:52,361
When you asked me to marry you?

1175
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:57,601
As if it was some
ordinary question.

1176
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:03,238
I thought that maybe you just
didn't want to be romantic,

1177
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,875
but then I realized
you were just actually

1178
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,812
really, really nervous.

1179
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,816
I bet that all was in
your journal, wasn't it?

1180
01:14:13,817 --> 01:14:15,518
I don't know.

1181
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:16,952
I bet Dr. Beckett knows.

1182
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,421
I bet she could
find the exact page.

1183
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:22,925
All those things you
said in the hospital.

1184
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,359
Our song.

1185
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,494
Our song that Dr. Beckett
knew full well about.

1186
01:14:25,495 --> 01:14:27,095
I played that song for you!

1187
01:14:27,096 --> 01:14:28,330
Amelia couldn't play the piano!

1188
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:29,132
You know what,
I can't take this.

1189
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:30,066
I'm stopping this.

1190
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:31,500
No, no, no interference.

1191
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:33,669
- This is bullshit.
- That was our agreement.

1192
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,670
Hey.

1193
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:37,340
Hey, look at me.

1194
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,878
Look at me, look at me.

1195
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:47,984
I'm different now.

1196
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,451
Why did you let them do this?

1197
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:29,392
I'm sorry.

1198
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:37,099
Just tell me what you need.

1199
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,134
I know you're not her.

1200
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,603
I am.

1201
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:43,873
But when I look at you,
it's almost the same.

1202
01:15:45,174 --> 01:15:48,977
If I did it long
enough, I bet I could

1203
01:15:48,978 --> 01:15:50,345
- make you her.
- I love you.

1204
01:15:50,346 --> 01:15:51,346
I love you.

1205
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,415
I miss you so much.

1206
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,351
Can't that be enough?

1207
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:04,159
Oh, I wish it could be.

1208
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:34,617
I love you, Millie.

1209
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:12,856
What happened to Amelia
and Carter was a tragedy.

1210
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,762
Is this gonna hinder
further research?

1211
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:22,264
Well, I can't speak for
Paul Wesley and the company

1212
01:18:22,265 --> 01:18:26,435
for legal reasons, but I
fully intend on continuing

1213
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:30,606
the work that, as
I've stated before,

1214
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,909
will save millions of lives.

1215
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:37,212
Is online.

1216
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,346
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1217
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,155
Max.

1218
01:18:47,156 --> 01:18:48,156
Amelia.

1219
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:51,594
What happened?

1220
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:55,964
Where's Carter?

1221
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,466
Okay, calm down.

1222
01:18:59,635 --> 01:19:01,336
I'm gonna fix everything,

1223
01:19:01,337 --> 01:19:03,672
but I need you to calm down.

1224
01:19:05,842 --> 01:19:09,812
These, these aren't my hands.

1225
01:19:09,813 --> 01:19:10,813
Amelia,

1226
01:19:14,017 --> 01:19:15,317
a lot has happened.

1227
01:19:15,318 --> 01:19:16,820
Listen, calm down.

1228
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:19,888
What are you talking about.

1229
01:19:19,889 --> 01:19:20,957
Okay, um...

1230
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:24,626
Do you remember when
Dr. Beckett said

1231
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:27,062
that she'd let you go if
you did the TV interview?

1232
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:29,732
Um, everything, it's so foggy.

1233
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,802
It's foggy because I had
trouble porting you over.

1234
01:19:33,803 --> 01:19:37,473
Listen, you did the TV
interview and then...

1235
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,478
Carter, um...

1236
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,249
He didn't show up.

1237
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,455
And then Dr. Beckett
changed her mind.

1238
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,658
She said that she
wasn't gonna let you go.

1239
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:58,193
She changed her mind.

1240
01:19:58,194 --> 01:19:59,194
She did?

1241
01:20:01,965 --> 01:20:04,967
But I'm gonna let you go.

1242
01:20:04,968 --> 01:20:06,768
I transferred you
into a new body.

1243
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:08,036
In this body you'll be free.

1244
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:10,373
You can survive on your own.

1245
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:18,915
I don't know what's gonna
happen to this company, but...

1246
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:24,487
All that matters to me is you.

1247
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:33,229
You can come with me.

1248
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:40,103
You're unlike anything
I've ever made before.

1249
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,111
Okay, I'm, uh...

1250
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,948
I got to wipe some records, okay?

1251
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:55,717
I'm gonna wipe them and I'll

1252
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:56,886
bring clothes.

1253
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,299
There were redundancies.

1254
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:15,471
Everything about Amelia can
be reproduced and fixed.

1255
01:21:16,572 --> 01:21:18,240
Her mind essentially
remains intact

1256
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,408
inside the mainframe,
right up until the moment

1257
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:22,111
before the accident.

1258
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:27,282
So, we'll just pick up
right where we left off.

1259
01:21:27,283 --> 01:21:30,685
I've never given up hope
for this project, never.

1260
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:32,420
Henry Ford once said,
"If I had asked people"

1261
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:35,457
"what they wanted, they
would've said faster horses."

1262
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,759
What Amelia taught
us is profound.

1263
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,930
Accessing visual records.

1264
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:53,175
The product isn't
immortality as we once thought.

1265
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:55,810
What people want is a
higher quality of life,

1266
01:21:55,811 --> 01:21:57,345
not necessarily a longer one.

1267
01:21:57,346 --> 01:22:00,882
People love the idea of Amelia
and that's when it happened.

1268
01:22:00,883 --> 01:22:02,150
The idea.

1269
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,986
A whole new line of
personal companions.

1270
01:22:03,987 --> 01:22:05,787
We can use Amelia's
brain to create

1271
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:07,889
a custom designed
version of her.

1272
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:10,959
It would look, sound, feel
like her, have her personality.

1273
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,895
But the customer can
program her memory.

1274
01:22:13,896 --> 01:22:15,730
They can literally
make Amelia theirs.

1275
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:17,032
What do you
have to say to proponents

1276
01:22:17,033 --> 01:22:18,767
of Thaddeus Williams?

1277
01:22:24,807 --> 01:22:27,476
It's okay to be scared, right?

1278
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:33,215
I would simply
offer my condolences.

1279
01:22:33,216 --> 01:22:35,150
What did you see?

1280
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:36,252
Everything.

1281
01:22:37,253 --> 01:22:38,686
I'm sorry.

1282
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:42,024
I didn't want anything
to do with it.

1283
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:45,627
Please come with
me, please, please.

1284
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:48,296
We can run away you and I.

1285
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:49,998
We could have the
life you never had.

1286
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:51,866
We could adopt.

1287
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:54,736
Could you please just
give me a minute to change?

1288
01:22:54,737 --> 01:22:56,071
Sure, just hurry up, okay?

1289
01:22:56,072 --> 01:22:58,407
We don't have a lot of time.

1290
01:23:01,077 --> 01:23:03,211
Dr. Beckett,
what are you feelings

1291
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:05,614
of Wesley's new announcement?

1292
01:23:07,783 --> 01:23:08,983
I'm sorry?

1293
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,452
A press report this morning

1294
01:23:10,453 --> 01:23:15,057
announced a production
line of customized Amelias.

1295
01:23:15,058 --> 01:23:16,891
What are your thoughts?

1296
01:23:19,695 --> 01:23:21,029
Amelia Summerland,

1297
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,997
humanity's first and
quite possibly last,

1298
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:26,134
embodiment of such an
awes inspiring question.

1299
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:27,970
What is consciousness?

1300
01:23:30,406 --> 01:23:32,374
Erasing back-up
files and redundancies.

1301
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,975
And does the
ideal of consciousness

1302
01:23:33,976 --> 01:23:37,146
evade death and all
its uncertainties?

1303
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:42,785
Does the power to live
devalue what it means to live?

1304
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:48,824
And just because we can,
does it mean we should?

1305
01:23:50,059 --> 01:23:52,260
These fragile
moments slip us by,

1306
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:56,030
one day at a time,
memories may dry.

1307
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:59,334
But hold my hand and
let's sleep tight,

1308
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:03,037
with open arms embracing
with all our might.

1309
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:10,612
When the wind takes us past

1310
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,047
we no longer have
such time to pass.

1311
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,916
1,000.

1312
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:18,921
We all will
falter, we all will fall.

1313
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:25,560
But nothing is ever
lost after all.
