1
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:51,642
Bravo! Bravo!

2
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,579
I don't understand. Is the
conductor a blithering idiot?

3
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,739
We went over the tempo six times!

4
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,899
It's adagio, adagio, adagio.
It's not racehorse tempo!

5
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:06,259
- Ja, ja, Herr Crawford. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- What? Don't be sorry!

6
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,939
Get it right. What good are apologies
when the poetry of the moment is lost?

7
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,259
And you! You're supposed to knock
when you're ready in the trunk.

8
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:13,539
How do I know when you're all clear?

9
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,179
I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,
I couldn't breathe in that...

10
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,339
- Well, you're not hired to breathe!
- But it was her first time, Mr. Crawford.

11
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,539
My God, we went over this
routine all afternoon.

12
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,459
How do I know when to begin
sticking in the swords?

13
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:27,059
I could have stabbed you to death,
and then, I get blood on my ensemble.

14
00:04:27,159 --> 00:04:29,099
Mr. Wei Ling Soo!
You were, as always, brilliant!

15
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,619
I've already taken off my robe.

16
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,179
- Can my wife and I take a photo of you?
- An autograph, please?

17
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,019
- Autographs are for mental defectives.
- But I want to prove I met you.

18
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,259
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd rather that proof didn't exist.

19
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,880
What if you get picked up for sodomy?

20
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,059
Yes!

21
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,019
Stanley?

22
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:54,659
Burkan! How are you, Howard?

23
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,939
Brilliant. You are still
the best in the world.

24
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,579
No thanks to the assorted
Neanderthals I have to deal with.

25
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,739
You haven't changed.

26
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,939
You're still a perfectionist, a snob, a genius,
with all the charm of a typhus epidemic.

27
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:09,179
Well, can I help it if I'm
surrounded by assassins?

28
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:12,219
Nonetheless, you held us spellbound.

29
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,179
And that last effect, from the
sarcophagus into the empty chair,

30
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,819
when you swivel around...

31
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,139
I mean, I do a vanish-and-reappearance
trick in my show

32
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,779
where I transport my pretty assistant

33
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:24,459
from one side of the stage to
the other in a steamer trunk,

34
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,046
but it is nothing
compared to what you do.

35
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,579
I invented that effect myself.

36
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,939
And if you're very good,

37
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,699
when we have more time,
I'll teach you all the moves.

38
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,739
It's actually... It's very simple.
You can do it anywhere.

39
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,379
It's a spectacular trick.

40
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:39,659
It's so good to see you.
How long has it been?

41
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,379
It's a year, at least.
And the tour's going well?

42
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,179
Yes, it's going quite well.
It concludes this week.

43
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:47,979
Munich was good. Barcelona adored me.

44
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,659
And you'll never guess who came
to see the show in Zurich.

45
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,979
- Enid Paxton.
- Enid Paxton?

46
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,219
Little thing in third form,

47
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,419
we both used her as an assistant
when we decided to become magicians.

48
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,339
You sawed her in half,
and I cut her head off.

49
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,299
Well, she was a game girl.

50
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,179
- How is she?
- She's fine.

51
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,779
You don't really notice any of the scars.
Of course, she's fatter than my elephant.

52
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,099
What? Pretty little
Enid with the curls?

53
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,899
Well, the years can be cruel, Howard.

54
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,779
"Life is nasty, brutish and short,"
as the man said.

55
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,139
Was it Hobbes? Yes, I believe it was Hobbes.
I'd have got on rather well with Hobbes.

56
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,499
Shall we go for a drink?

57
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:21,539
Brilliant notion, Burkan.
We can catch up.

58
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,779
Stanley, I need your help.

59
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,526
The plot thickens.
I'll buy you a scotch.

60
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:02,379
The Catledge family are wonderful people.
Caroline Catledge is an old friend of mine.

61
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,659
They're a wealthy Pittsburgh family.
Father made millions in coal before he died.

62
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,819
They're socialites with several houses,
one in the south of France.

63
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,899
Now, the thing is, there's a
young woman staying with them,

64
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:18,419
who has them believing
that she's a spirit medium.

65
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,379
Lord, not another fake psychic.
What a pestilence they are.

66
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,939
They're taken with her
predictions of the future.

67
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,459
- Telling them what they want to hear.
- Precisely.

68
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:30,699
And charging them for all
the good news she brings.

69
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,099
Exactly right. And, of course,
she's a pretty young thing.

70
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,699
Well, of course. A pretty face
never hurt a cheap swindler.

71
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:41,099
Brice Catledge, Caroline's brother,
the heir to the family fortune,

72
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,619
fancies himself in love with her.

73
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,539
I don't know who I loathe more,

74
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,219
those who use simple tricks
to prey on the gullible,

75
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,419
or the gullible, who are so stupid,
they deserve what they get.

76
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,699
Brice Catledge's sister Caroline is
married to a doctor, a psychoanalyst,

77
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:59,659
and he insisted on this
woman doing her séances,

78
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,419
- in the presence of two renowned scientists.
- Rubbish.

79
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,059
Doesn't he know that scientists
are among the easiest to fool?

80
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,299
Well, this is the thing,
I'm embarrassed to say,

81
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,099
that I watched this woman work
from every angle, time and again,

82
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,819
and I couldn't find anything amiss.

83
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,979
I mean, I watched every move,
and Lord knows,

84
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,299
I know pretty much every mind-reading
and séance trick there is,

85
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,219
but I couldn't find a flaw or
spot a single suspicious move,

86
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,459
and I began to doubt
my own clear thinking.

87
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:31,002
You know, I thought,
"Maybe, she's the real thing."

88
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,379
There is no real thing, Howard!
It's all phony!

89
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:38,379
From the séance table,
to the Vatican and beyond!

90
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,979
I can't believe you're saying this.

91
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:41,739
I'm very worried for the family.

92
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,539
If you could come and
observe her in action?

93
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,739
After all, you are the greatest debunker
of fake spiritualists in the world.

94
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,499
There's not a single one
who's got past you.

95
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,939
Olivia and I were all set to take a
holiday, travel through the Galapagos.

96
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,259
But you hate holidays.

97
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:59,499
You'll spend your whole time in
your room practicing card tricks,

98
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,579
and you'll never see the big turtles.

99
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,659
And besides, you've always
loved the south of France,

100
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,179
and you could visit
your Aunt Vanessa.

101
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,379
But if this woman knows she's being
watched by the great Wei Ling Soo,

102
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,899
she'll make some
excuse not to perform.

103
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:17,059
The usual headaches,
resistance in the room...

104
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,339
She'll never know
you're Wei Ling Soo.

105
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,979
No one knows who you are
under all that chinoiserie.

106
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,019
You can pose as anyone you like.

107
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:27,379
Well, if she's fooled you,
she must be very good.

108
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,619
But she won't fool me.

109
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:32,379
I can't wait to see what
gimmickry she's employing,

110
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:36,047
unmask it, and throw
it back in her face.

111
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,419
Postponing our holiday?

112
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,579
- I can't resist.
- You're driven, Stanley.

113
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,325
Don't get angry with me, Olivia.
It won't be for long.

114
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,739
Okay, go.

115
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,859
You've always had the
measure of me, Olivia.

116
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,099
Ever since our very first dinner,

117
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:55,579
when I made your ruby ring
disappear from your finger,

118
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,579
and reappear in your soft-boiled egg.

119
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:01,099
If you recall, I quickly
figured out how you did it.

120
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,859
Yes, you were very impressive.

121
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,739
It was simply a matter of
logic and common sense.

122
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,739
I mean, you palmed the ring and
distracted me by spilling the salt.

123
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,659
I believe it was my clear thinking
that attracted you to me.

124
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,779
Yes, your logic and
common sense equal mine,

125
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,219
but you have the added
quality of being beautiful.

126
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:21,569
You've said it several times, Stanley.
We're a match made in heaven.

127
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,819
What a serendipitous pleasure

128
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,979
to be surprised by my favorite
nephew and Howard Burkan!

129
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,299
Little Howard.

130
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,459
- "Burkan the Great," if you please.
- Of course.

131
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,619
Of all my nephews and nieces,
you're the only one, Stanley,

132
00:11:05,719 --> 00:11:07,659
who isn't boring to the
point of perfection.

133
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,699
I couldn't agree more.

134
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,659
If only you had a slightly milder disposition,
you might actually have friends.

135
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,139
I am his friend.
Notice I use the singular.

136
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,779
Yes, he means he can tolerate me.

137
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,779
You may be Burkan the
Great to your public,

138
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,939
but to me, you'll always
be little Howard Burkan,

139
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,819
who took my favorite scarf,
cut it in half with a pair of scissors,

140
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,099
waved his magic wand over it,
and it didn't come back together.

141
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,179
- I was just learning the trick.
- No, she never got over that.

142
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,699
And to what do I owe
this unannounced visit?

143
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,699
I'm here to expose yet another
fraudulent spiritualist,

144
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,179
and I thought I'd warn you I'll
be dropping by for black pudding.

145
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,979
Yes, the Catledges are holding
séances up at their place.

146
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,699
They've apparently met some gifted medium.
It's the talk of the Côte d'Azur.

147
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,379
She's a little American called Sophie Baker,
and apparently she's very sharp,

148
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,859
but Stanley will get
the measure of her.

149
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,729
I can't wait.

150
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,899
- Welcome!
- Welcome...

151
00:12:10,999 --> 00:12:12,659
- How lovely to see you.
- Bienvenue.

152
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,059
- George, Caroline, Stanley.
- How do you do?

153
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,179
- Hello.
- Stanley. A great pleasure.

154
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,379
- George.
- Charmed.

155
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,299
Of course, George and Caroline
are the reason I'm here.

156
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,899
They're a great deal less gullible
than Caroline's mother and brother,

157
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:28,339
and had hoped that I would be able
to reveal the medium as a fraud.

158
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:30,819
When she fooled Howard Burkan,
we knew we were in trouble.

159
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,579
But then when he said he was
best friends with Wei Ling Soo...

160
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,219
We're great admirers. Who isn't?

161
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,259
I don't know if Howard told you,
her name is Sophie Baker.

162
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,579
Have you heard of her or...

163
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,419
No, I have not, but these sleazy
fraudsters change identity every month.

164
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,739
And I omitted to mention
she's here with her mother.

165
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,659
- Now, that says a lot.
- Yeah.

166
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,099
I hope you kept your eyes on
her mother during the séance,

167
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,939
or did she dim the lights too low?

168
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,259
Caroline, you were next to her.

169
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,499
She held my brother's hand,
and she actually made the table rise.

170
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,499
Well, I looked for the
usual devices, of course.

171
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:03,139
I thought maybe, wrist lifts,
but they weren't there.

172
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:07,179
She's promised to try and make contact
with my father, who died a year ago.

173
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,099
As I was saying,
your mother and your brother

174
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:12,979
are the victims of a dishonest ruse,
as your good sense tells you.

175
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,419
There is, of course, no spirit world,
and even if there were,

176
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,299
you can be sure that some little
American gypsy would not be the one

177
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,459
blessed to unlock its secrets.

178
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,739
Only a low-grade halfwit
would fall for any of this.

179
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,219
But you're not implying that her
mother and brother are halfwits?

180
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,219
Well, I haven't met them yet.
But I'm sure they're like most people,

181
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:31,419
desperate for a little hope
in a world that has none,

182
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,979
and willing to believe anything.

183
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,939
Who shall we say you are?

184
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,379
Introduce me as Stanley Taplinger.

185
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,499
I'm an old friend in the
import-export business.

186
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,619
Understood. Mr. Taplinger,
up to the house.

187
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,979
Come on, Howard.

188
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,939
What is that dreadful noise?

189
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,659
My brother. He practices
serenading Sophie.

190
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,139
Both thine eyes are cute, too

191
00:13:53,239 --> 00:13:56,010
What they do to me

192
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,579
Hear me holler

193
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:01,019
I choose a sweet lollapaloosa

194
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:03,779
In thee

195
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,499
Thou sweet, thou grand...

196
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,979
- Howard.
- Brice, good to see you again.

197
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,819
Can I introduce you to my friend Stanley
Taplinger, who's going to be staying.

198
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,099
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, Mr. Taplinger...

199
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,219
- Taplinger... Taplinger.
- Taplinger.

200
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,459
And, how long will you being
staying with us, Mister...

201
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,579
Not very. I have business elsewhere.

202
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:23,259
Have you told him about Sophie?

203
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,819
Now, is this the girl that
can read minds and such?

204
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,099
- Well, she gets these sensory impressions.
- And, what are they?

205
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,579
It's hard to explain.
She gets these mental vibrations.

206
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,899
Her head vibrates?

207
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,579
- Drink?
- Thank you.

208
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,847
- Have you got a whiskey, Brice?
- I absolutely do.

209
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,659
Now, Sophie looked into my eyes

210
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,339
and told me things about me
she could never have known.

211
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,979
About old girlfriends I'd had,
and places I've traveled to.

212
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,619
Good heavens. You think
she can do it with me?

213
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:51,779
Of course. Of course.

214
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:57,379
Whatever questions you have about life,
the hereafter... Here, cheers.

215
00:14:57,479 --> 00:15:01,059
Perhaps there's a departed loved
one you wish to make contact with.

216
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:04,139
Sophie sees all. She can predict
the future. In short, she's a visionary.

217
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,539
And, I'm told she's very
pleasant to look at.

218
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,459
She's a visionary and a vision.

219
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:13,219
Mother's agreed to subsidize a foundation
for the serious scientific study of her work.

220
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:16,059
Well, after this buildup,
I'm champing at the bit to meet her.

221
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,219
She's doing some psychic readings
over at the Lounsberrys' house,

222
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,739
but she should be here any minute.

223
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,459
And the Lounsberrys, I take it,
are wealthy marks...

224
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,859
Wealthy friends of yours that
she was anxious to meet?

225
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,419
Yes. How did you know?

226
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,299
Mental vibrations.

227
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,619
Excuse me? Telephone call, Mr. Catledge.
Your business office in Paris.

228
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,728
Excuse me.

229
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:43,259
He doesn't make any business decision
at all now without consulting Sophie first.

230
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,859
Well, what can I say, Howard?
He's a moron.

231
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,779
Incidentally, Stanley, I think,

232
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,379
if you could bottle up your
sarcasm a little more skillfully,

233
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,819
it might help us on our mission.

234
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,499
Howard, we all hope someone will
come along with superpowers,

235
00:15:55,599 --> 00:16:00,088
but the only superpower certain
to show up wears a black robe.

236
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,739
Speak of the devil and superpowers,
I think that's her now.

237
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,167
Yeah, there she is.

238
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,899
- Mr. Talmudge.
- Hello.

239
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:23,099
- Taplinger.
- Hello.

240
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,459
I'm so sorry. Yes.

241
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,619
You're every bit as lovely
as you've been described.

242
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,444
Thank you.

243
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,009
Wait.

244
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,605
Don't say anything.
I'm getting a mental impression.

245
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:46,379
Are you from the Orient?
The Far East?

246
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,339
China?

247
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:52,259
Have you been there, or do you visit?

248
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,561
Why do you say China?

249
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,619
I just get that impression.

250
00:16:57,719 --> 00:17:00,650
And what impression is that?

251
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,326
No.

252
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,167
Never mind. It's fading, it's fading.

253
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,139
And you are her sister?

254
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:11,779
- Mother.
- Mother, are you?

255
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:16,379
What lovely cheek bones. The apple
does not fall far from the tree.

256
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,539
And what do you do, Mr. Taplinger?

257
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:19,979
- I'm...
- Wait.

258
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,699
Sophie, what impression do you have
of Mr. Taplinger's line of work?

259
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,242
- I should say Sophie has psychic gifts.
- Has she?

260
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:34,699
It's not immediately clear,
although I...

261
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,359
I do get some vibrations suggesting
that Mr. Taplinger travels a lot.

262
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,059
Well, those are excellent vibrations,

263
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:44,899
but it's not an unreasonable
assumption, is it?

264
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:46,899
I mean, plenty of people
travel in their work.

265
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,682
I see Germany.
Have you been to Germany?

266
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:56,419
Matter of fact, I did have some
business recently in Berlin.

267
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:58,739
I'd say, that's pretty
damn impressive.

268
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:02,299
Mr. Burkan, as you
may know, is a magician,

269
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:05,859
who was brought here to observe
my daughter and find flaws,

270
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,019
but has stayed to marvel at her.

271
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,019
Well, what have I stumbled upon?

272
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,059
You never told us what
you did, Mr. Taplinger.

273
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,088
Neither did your daughter.

274
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:23,883
For some reason, my mental
impressions are cloudy.

275
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:27,539
Cloudy. When you say your
mental impressions are cloudy,

276
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,779
are they cumulus clouds or cirrus?

277
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,419
Mr. Taplinger is a businessman.

278
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,059
What line of business?

279
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,043
The import-export trade.

280
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,769
I see Chinese letters.

281
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:44,524
Chinese writing.

282
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,967
Perhaps, you're visualizing
my laundry ticket.

283
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,459
You're making fun of me.

284
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,299
I'm afraid you're in the
wrong part of the world.

285
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:56,206
I import coffee beans
and cocoa from Brazil.

286
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,459
Well, I didn't... Really?

287
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,499
I think it's time we moved along.
Sophie's had a strenuous afternoon.

288
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,619
It is rather exhausting communicating
with the unseen world.

289
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:12,299
Well, I'm sure Mr. Taplinger doesn't
believe in the unseen world.

290
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,139
On the contrary, I always
thought the unseen world

291
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:16,328
was a good place to
open a restaurant.

292
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,579
Time to go, Sophie.

293
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,579
The spirits have to eat somewhere.

294
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,219
Mr. Taplinger is rather obnoxious.

295
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,649
Obnoxious, but he's not
entirely unappealing.

296
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,019
Congratulations, Stanley,

297
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,739
you've managed to alienate the entire
household in a single afternoon.

298
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,659
She's nothing I haven't seen before.

299
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,179
Pretty young thing with a stage
mother who handles the promotion,

300
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,899
and who knows what else when
the lights are out at the séance.

301
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:43,539
I want you to see her working.

302
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:46,499
More importantly, I want to be
there when you expose them.

303
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,259
Well, I mean, she's not
even a good actress.

304
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,899
"I... I get the impression
of the Orient. China."

305
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:54,539
What utter bilge.

306
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:56,739
Well, I thought that was quite good,

307
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,499
considering you are Wei Ling Soo
and you have just been to Germany.

308
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,339
Yes, it's all very tantalizing.

309
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,219
Careful, she's tricky.

310
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,899
And yet, she's a fraud, Howard.

311
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,619
Because there is no sixth sense.
There are five senses, and no spirit world.

312
00:20:10,719 --> 00:20:14,179
But there are coincidences.
Maybe she's made some lucky guesses,

313
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,847
but we have to be careful not to
build them into something more.

314
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:24,699
Your daughter is going to try to make contact
with my dear departed Harry tonight.

315
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,699
Well, she's been waiting
for the right moment.

316
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,419
Sophie needs the proper vibrations.

317
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,579
Now, of course, we need to
purchase or build an establishment

318
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,379
- suitable for the operation of our foundation.
- Of course.

319
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:43,379
There will be various assorted costs, and
naturally, all the students will pay a fee.

320
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:47,286
And, I assume, profits will
go into psychic research?

321
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:50,299
Most of them.

322
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:54,419
Minus operating
expenses and sundries.

323
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,689
You can count on my support.

324
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:01,819
I've always known there had to be
more to this life than meets the eye.

325
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,659
How could it be that what we
see is all there is to everything?

326
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,459
And, that's such a bleak thought.

327
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,448
Why would God go to so much trouble
if everything comes to nothing?

328
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,779
Well, Sophie is...

329
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:22,979
Sophie is living proof that the
world is alive with hidden things.

330
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,579
She's such an uplifting creature.

331
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:30,725
No wonder my son, Brice,
is so smitten with her.

332
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:34,499
I'm always chasing

333
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,326
Rainbows

334
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:41,219
Watching clouds

335
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:44,841
Drifting by

336
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,139
My schemes

337
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:52,808
Are just like all my dreams

338
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:59,321
Ending in the sky

339
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:04,019
Some fellows look
and find the sunshine

340
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,641
I always look and find the rain

341
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,482
Some fellows make a killing sometime

342
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:14,659
I never even make a gain

343
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,739
Believe me

344
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,499
I'm always chasing

345
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:24,121
Rainbows

346
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,047
Waiting to find a
little bluebird in vain

347
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,819
You know that I'm in love with you?

348
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,499
You mustn't give your
heart away so quickly.

349
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:39,019
You looked into my eyes,
and without even knowing me,

350
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:41,059
you knew me better
than I know myself.

351
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,939
You knew my dreams and my ambitions.

352
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:46,219
Please, don't tell me you're
in love with someone else.

353
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,339
No, no, of course not.

354
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:52,179
I never had time to fall in love.

355
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,339
Mother and I were always
traveling, you know?

356
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,939
Unlike you, we're members
of the working class.

357
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,499
That's over.

358
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,099
I'm gonna take care of you and pamper
you for the rest of your life.

359
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:07,699
Do you like to travel?
I mean, on yachts?

360
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:12,699
Do you like to go to parties and buy
jewels and clothes and go dancing?

361
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,579
I'm a very good dancer.

362
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,885
I'm sure I could get used
to yachts and jewels.

363
00:23:20,479 --> 00:23:23,819
I had an interesting chat with
Mr. Taplinger, as he's called.

364
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,139
You did?

365
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:29,539
Yeah, I'd say he has a classic
neurotic personality disorder.

366
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:33,219
Yeah, brilliant parents
who didn't get along,

367
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,259
closer to his aunt than his mother,
obsessed with mortality,

368
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,579
believes in nothing,
finds life to have no meaning.

369
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,579
Just a perfect depressive,
with everything sublimated into his art,

370
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,419
and he is quite an artist.

371
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:50,899
He began as an escape artist.

372
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:54,899
Interesting choice if anyone ever
wanted to escape from reality.

373
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,579
But, like Freud,
he will not permit himself

374
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,739
to be seduced by childish thoughts
just because they're more comforting.

375
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,929
Very unhappy man.

376
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,769
I like him.

377
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,419
- Miss Baker.
- Hello.

378
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,179
Rested, I presume?

379
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,939
Yes, I had a bath.
I had a little nap.

380
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,499
And now, you're refreshed.

381
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:32,459
Well, no, not entirely.
I had an unpleasant dream.

382
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,859
I've had my share.

383
00:24:34,959 --> 00:24:39,139
I dreamt I was being followed
by a sinister Chinese.

384
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:41,459
You have the Far East on the brain.

385
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:44,239
- What do you think it means?
- I don't know.

386
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,139
Good evening.

387
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:49,459
I understand you're
holding a séance tonight.

388
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,379
She's been waiting for
the right moment,

389
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,899
and now, she says,
"The planets are in alignment."

390
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:57,139
And what do they have
to be in alignment with?

391
00:24:57,239 --> 00:24:58,819
Your vertebrae?

392
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,283
Can you do the séance if someone
in the room is a non-believer?

393
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:09,139
And when you contact the spirits,
will we be able to see the souls?

394
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:12,819
And how are they different from ghosts?
Or are they ghosts?

395
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:15,259
I should think souls
are quite different.

396
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,379
- Have you ever heard of ectoplasm?
- Ectoplasm?

397
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,899
Now, isn't that a milky
substance rather like yogurt?

398
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,019
You are a joker, aren't you?

399
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,699
So, you're saying it
might look like yogurt,

400
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,003
but it will be Mrs. Catledge's
former husband.

401
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,859
Dinner. Sophie, come to dinner.

402
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,699
Isn't the light perfect, Mother?

403
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,339
Really, what exactly
happens at a séance?

404
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:41,139
You know, I don't believe you're so
naive as you make out about the occult.

405
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,779
I will admit, my Uncle Charles
once attended a séance

406
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:46,219
where the medium made a lot
of amazing things happen,

407
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,539
and weeks later, she was
unmasked and sent to prison,

408
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:51,699
for defrauding people out of
substantial sums of money.

409
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,640
Charles. Uncle Charles.

410
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,339
Death by water.

411
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:01,687
What did you say?

412
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:06,049
What? I was just...

413
00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:10,525
I was receiving some
mental impressions. Excuse me.

414
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,939
Come, Stanley, let's go to...
You look stunned.

415
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:18,899
I had an uncle who
drowned many years ago.

416
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:20,019
And when I mentioned him,

417
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:24,539
she lapsed into a kind of fugue state
and muttered "Death by water."

418
00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:30,659
Well, she knew that my sister married
on March the seventh to a bank manager.

419
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,979
There's absolutely no way she
could know that unless...

420
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:35,379
Not you, too, Howard! No!

421
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:39,400
I'll make short work of her
tonight during the séance.

422
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,760
I would like us now to join hands,

423
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:50,579
as we summon

424
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,280
the unseen world.

425
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,927
Now, we're here tonight
to contact the soul

426
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,521
of the departed husband
of Grace Catledge,

427
00:27:06,239 --> 00:27:10,444
father of Brice and Caroline.

428
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,244
Now, I will try to achieve

429
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:20,245
a trance state.

430
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,809
I'm falling deeper,

431
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:33,844
and deeper,

432
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,885
into a trance.

433
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:42,485
Harry Catledge, give me a sign.

434
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:47,925
Give us a sign!

435
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,042
Harry?

436
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:56,605
Is that you, Harry?

437
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,939
Spirit?

438
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:03,083
Signal us once for "Yes."

439
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,979
Twice for "No."

440
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:09,964
Harry, are you okay?

441
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:12,960
Are you happy?

442
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,768
Spirit, if you can hear me,

443
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:24,410
give me a sign.

444
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:34,206
That's not possible.

445
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,699
I mean, damn it, Stanley,
we've both done levitations.

446
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,579
I once raised a real tiger,
but we both have our tricks.

447
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,299
There was nothing supporting
this candle, no threads, no wires,

448
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:50,842
it was floating until
I brought it down.

449
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:55,739
I was just telling
Mr. Pepperidge here

450
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:01,059
how marvelously you made that candle
float with no apparent support.

451
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,739
"Apparent," I think, is the key word.

452
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,499
Is it "Pepperidge," or "Talmudge,"
or "Taplinger?"

453
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:12,739
Anyway, it was a wonderful,
wonderful, super trick.

454
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,659
I mean, I grabbed the candle and found
absolutely nothing supporting it.

455
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,099
That's because there's
nothing to find.

456
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:23,859
My daughter is not some
commercial music hall attraction.

457
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:27,208
She doesn't do tricks.
She is an adept.

458
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,819
I hope I didn't disappoint
you at your first séance.

459
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,259
I found it nothing short of perfection.
Well done, madam.

460
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,499
I can't even remember the last
time I've seen Mother so happy.

461
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,659
Will you join us?

462
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:38,379
We're all going to hear
some really hot music.

463
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,539
Hot music?

464
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,899
- Come on, Sophie, come on.
- Yeah, we...

465
00:29:40,999 --> 00:29:43,419
I thought you said "All this
mental work was exhausting?"

466
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,739
It is, but I love hot music.

467
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,299
Well, I hope you're not plagued tonight
by the dream of the sinister Chinese.

468
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,459
You know, I figured out
who you represented.

469
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,459
- Really?
- Yes.

470
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,539
When I was much younger, years ago,
I went and saw Wei Ling Soo.

471
00:30:01,639 --> 00:30:02,739
Have you heard of him?

472
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,379
He's a Caucasian who disguised
himself as a Chinese,

473
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:09,459
and he billed himself as
the Great Oriental Wizard.

474
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,339
I see, and did you
enjoy his performance?

475
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:16,139
I did, very much. He was brilliant.

476
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:19,419
He vanished a live elephant,
and it was just...

477
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,299
I mean, it just was
completely shocking,

478
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,259
but of course, it was mechanical tricks
that one could learn with enough practice.

479
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,619
I see. And, your performance?

480
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:31,539
- I wouldn't call it a performance.
- Well, call it what you will.

481
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:36,179
I mean, it's a type of trickery,
like card magic or vanishing an elephant.

482
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,449
And I say you're Mr. Wei Ling Soo.

483
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:43,619
And I say there is nothing you
can do that I cannot duplicate.

484
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,179
I don't doubt it. You're great.

485
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,619
But just because you can
duplicate my miracles,

486
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:54,719
in no way proves that
mine are not real.

487
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,219
It was quite a display.
I must say, she impresses me.

488
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:15,259
- And you saw no signs of trickery?
- Not yet.

489
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,379
Well, let's face it, Stanley,
you came to unmask her,

490
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,619
and she's unmasked you.

491
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:24,499
On the one side, yes, she's pulling
off these bewildering feats,

492
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,259
and on the other remains the simple
fact that what she's claiming to do,

493
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:32,219
while exquisitely executed,
is simply not possible.

494
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:34,379
But who's to say what's possible?

495
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:39,619
I'm a physician, and new facts come to light,
new discoveries are made all the time.

496
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:42,499
Things we never dreamed possible.

497
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,339
To cure someone of blindness

498
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:47,539
by having her lie on a couch
and talk about her childhood.

499
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,019
I mean, who'd have thought?

500
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,139
Yeah, but don't you see it challenges
our whole concept of reality?

501
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:57,459
I mean, if there's an unseen world,
an afterlife, souls to contact,

502
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,259
mind reading,
oretelling the future...

503
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,579
Yes, it changes everything we've
held to be scientifically accurate.

504
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:03,619
It's true.

505
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,579
If what she claims was possible,

506
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,379
everything would surely
take on new meaning.

507
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:11,459
And yes, very hopeful meaning.

508
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,979
To think, if there
were more to life...

509
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,739
More what?

510
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,459
That life doesn't end with death?
That the universe works by design?

511
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,099
That God exists.

512
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:26,819
All right, let's not get carried away.
The woman is a charlatan.

513
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:29,419
Because, depressing as the
facts of existence are,

514
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,859
they are the facts.

515
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,859
There is no metaphysical world.

516
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:37,419
What you see out
there is what you get.

517
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,690
I think Mr. Nietzsche has disposed of
the God matter rather convincingly.

518
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,819
Good morning.

519
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,499
May I?

520
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,899
Did you sleep well, Mr. Taplinger?

521
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,139
Or should I just call you
by your Chinese name?

522
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:01,045
You are a very clever
little humbug, Miss Baker.

523
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,859
What are you doing today?

524
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,979
I'm going bird-watching with Brice.
Do you want to join us?

525
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,699
I can't think of a
more inane activity,

526
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:14,163
watching little winged creatures acting
out nature's pointless busywork.

527
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,259
Why don't you join me instead?

528
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,699
Where?

529
00:34:18,799 --> 00:34:21,019
I'm driving to Provence
to visit my Aunt Vanessa.

530
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,219
She's a remarkable woman.

531
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:26,259
We could have lunch. Chat?

532
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,459
Actually, get to know
one another better.

533
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,979
You think you'll trick me into
showing you how I deceive people.

534
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,299
Come on.

535
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:40,366
I'm sure Brice Catledge can live without
drooling all over you for a few hours.

536
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,967
I think I'd like to visit Provence.
I've never been there.

537
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,819
Tell me, doesn't it ever
trouble your conscience

538
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:04,019
to fool that poor,
empty-headed Mrs. Catledge

539
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,699
into believing she's communicating
with her departed spouse?

540
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:11,659
I could just as easily ask you, doesn't
it ever bother you to creep around,

541
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:14,019
dashing people's dreams and hopes?

542
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,259
Not if their hopes are false.

543
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,259
Even if their hopes are false,
if it helps them get through life?

544
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,970
Then you admit you're a fraud?

545
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,339
I wonder if you get your
cynicism from your grandfather,

546
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:28,689
the merchant seaman
with the missing finger.

547
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,243
The missing toe.

548
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,327
Why are you staring at me?

549
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,379
Where are you from?

550
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,443
Kalamazoo.

551
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:50,082
It's in Michigan. And,
you're from London.

552
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:54,160
I see a white house in Belgravia.

553
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:58,899
Fourteen... No, 16.

554
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,486
Wilton Crescent.

555
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:05,059
A piano.

556
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,283
Yes, that's all correct
and rather amazing.

557
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:10,139
But I don't buy it.

558
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,339
'Cause I'm a rational man who
believes in a rational world.

559
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,801
Any other way, lies madness.

560
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:19,219
You'd be happier if I was a fraud,

561
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:22,779
because then, your whole fixed
worldview wouldn't be shaken up.

562
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,619
No, it's quite the opposite.

563
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,019
If you knew how much I don't
want you to be a fake...

564
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,419
But think how embarrassing
it would be for you.

565
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,299
Your whole life, you spent publicly
crusading against spiritualism,

566
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:40,659
and then, you'd have to come out
with it and say that you were wrong.

567
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:42,802
But I'm not wrong.

568
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,600
Is that why Jenny dropped you?

569
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,139
How could you know about Jenny?

570
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,363
I see long, blonde hair.

571
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:56,328
A wonderful laugh.

572
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,885
Yes, she had a lovely laugh.

573
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,819
But who wants a pessimistic bore

574
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:08,647
who hides in his room all day
and practices card tricks?

575
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:14,539
No, I'll tell you who wants a man who locks
himself in his room and practices all day,

576
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,480
who's a committed artist.
Olivia, my fiancée.

577
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:21,566
Yes.

578
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,924
Olivia.

579
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,650
I see a match made in heaven.

580
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:53,179
How can you eat so much?
We just finished lunch.

581
00:37:53,279 --> 00:37:55,619
I told you I like to eat a lot.

582
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,979
George's psychoanalyst says
it's because I need love,

583
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,600
but to me, I'm just hungry.

584
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,579
I mean, a lot of people need love,
but they don't eat their way to it.

585
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:09,739
- You want some?
- No, thank you.

586
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,939
This is so beautiful.

587
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,241
It's transient.

588
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:18,819
Stanley, how nice of you to drop by.

589
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:22,168
And you, I take it, must be Olivia.

590
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,779
Olivia? No, no.

591
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:27,739
Olivia is a brunette.

592
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,019
And she's a bit taller than me,
and she's in London,

593
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,059
anxious to get on with her trip,
so, she can get to work on her book.

594
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,419
I'm Sophie.

595
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,059
You must be the American the
Catledges say is so amazing.

596
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:45,299
Sophie fancies herself a telepathic,
among other things,

597
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:50,059
so, be careful what you think, Aunt Vanessa.
We all know the evil workings of your mind.

598
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:54,499
Stanley doesn't believe in spiritualists.
He thinks you're all scoundrels.

599
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,299
If so, you're a very
pretty little scoundrel.

600
00:38:56,399 --> 00:39:00,445
If you see all and know all,
where's my aunt just been?

601
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,405
Somewhere for her health.

602
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:08,859
I see baths.

603
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:12,819
Is it sciatica or rheumatism?

604
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:16,739
It's sciatica, and that
is quite remarkable.

605
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:19,659
How can you know that I've just
come back from a spa in Italy?

606
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:21,979
However she knows, it's not
through mystical vibrations,

607
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,059
I can assure you.

608
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:28,099
He's always been so militantly
scientific, even at six years old.

609
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,859
One of the most kind
and gentle local priests

610
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:34,859
said that Stanley was the only child
in the neighborhood destined for Hell.

611
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,379
And why do you still trek to Italy,

612
00:39:36,479 --> 00:39:38,699
to pay good money to
bathe in plain spring water

613
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:42,539
that is not a drop more medicinal than
the water that flows from your own tub?

614
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,299
I'm not going to get into that
debate with you, Stanley.

615
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:46,819
It brings out the beast in you.

616
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:49,499
And I see you still buy
this stupid nostrum.

617
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,419
It's a health mixture. Sulfur,
molasses and barley extract.

618
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:58,899
It's disgusting and is of no proven value.
Perhaps if I needed an emetic.

619
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:01,099
Am I the only sane person
left on this planet?

620
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,219
I love him, but he was always
an incorrigible child.

621
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,499
Can I give you something?

622
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,539
No, thank you. Just a
little wine, if you have any.

623
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,059
- We've just eaten.
- Are those little cakes?

624
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,739
Good heavens, are you seriously
going to have more food?

625
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:15,059
- They're delicious.
- Unbelievable!

626
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:18,179
Now, tell me something about my
Aunt Vanessa's colorful past.

627
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:21,939
Leave her alone, Stanley.
She's not a performing monkey.

628
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,299
Do you have a telephone I could use?

629
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:27,139
I'm sorry, it's 3:00, and I was
supposed to meet Brice for drinks,

630
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,339
but I'm never gonna make it.

631
00:40:28,439 --> 00:40:31,299
Brice Catledge is the young
milksop who's smitten with her,

632
00:40:31,399 --> 00:40:35,259
and ready to lay his family fortune at
her feet to subsidize her chicanery.

633
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,299
Can you believe it? He serenades her.

634
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:38,739
Well, it sounds rather
romantic to me,

635
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:40,939
but you wouldn't know
about such things, Stanley.

636
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,979
It would mean joining the human race.

637
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,059
- Here, it's in the study.
- Thank you.

638
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,819
Why do you badger her? She's quite
likable, even if she is a fraud.

639
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:53,939
You know, one of the
cardinal rules of magic,

640
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:56,219
is that the magician must
never repeat his trick,

641
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,779
because sooner or later,
one begins to notice the move,

642
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:01,219
and he's caught.

643
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,090
- But the more I watch her...
- Yes?

644
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:08,241
The more I'm stumped.

645
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,961
Could she be real?

646
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,459
I'm beginning to question
my own common sense.

647
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,779
I've always questioned
your common sense.

648
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:23,139
You've always been so certain
about the world, Stanley.

649
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,979
And I've always tried to teach
you that we don't know.

650
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,339
We really don't know.

651
00:41:28,439 --> 00:41:32,179
We're just poor,
limited human beings.

652
00:41:32,279 --> 00:41:35,801
The goldfish doesn't understand
who changes the water in his bowl.

653
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:37,819
If only she was real,

654
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,459
it would lift the dark cloud that's
followed me since childhood.

655
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,699
Well, I'm sure your fiancée would
appreciate a sunnier bridegroom.

656
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:47,419
Olivia likes me as I am.
Sophie agrees we're a match made in heaven.

657
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,448
Has she met her?

658
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:53,779
No, but there,
she's guessing correctly.

659
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,619
I told Brice I'd be late.

660
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,499
I said I was just sitting down
for some of your blood pudding.

661
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:02,121
Tell me something about my aunt.

662
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:10,339
Do you have a handkerchief
or an article of clothing,

663
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:12,419
or a piece of jewelry I could use?

664
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:14,721
My pearls.

665
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,686
These are beautiful.

666
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,844
Yes.

667
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,299
I'm receiving a... It's cloudy.

668
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:41,739
Cloudy...

669
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,566
Here comes the usual
theatrical fertilizer.

670
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:54,364
I see an important Englishman.

671
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:01,683
Perhaps a member of Parliament.

672
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:04,209
Go on.

673
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,979
- A love affair.
- I don't believe this.

674
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,579
You cannot possibly know this.

675
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,379
Something's wrong.

676
00:43:14,479 --> 00:43:15,899
What?

677
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:18,819
- He's married.
- Aunt Vanessa?

678
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,339
- I see a sequence of trysts.
- I've never told her anything.

679
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:22,899
He cannot leave his wife.

680
00:43:22,999 --> 00:43:24,619
No, he did not.

681
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,539
And so, you're heartbroken.

682
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,739
Sophie, you are a miracle.

683
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,339
And you vow never to love again.

684
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:30,619
How does she do it?

685
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,979
You're never to marry.

686
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,219
This is beyond comprehension.
I've never known anything like it...

687
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:37,567
But this is a symbol. This is...

688
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,699
The breakup.

689
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:44,299
He gave me those on our
last evening together.

690
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,139
- Sophie.
- I'm so sorry.

691
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:49,899
Sophie, is there really a spirit world?
Do you really tune in on it?

692
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,619
Is there more? Have I not seen it?

693
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,240
Where have you been all my life?

694
00:44:01,879 --> 00:44:05,539
When did you first realize you
had this extraordinary gift?

695
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:08,579
Very young. My teens.

696
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,699
Well, and you saw it as
a way to make money?

697
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:15,259
Well, my father abandoned us,
and we were very poor.

698
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:16,659
But it's astounding.

699
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:22,459
I mean, I've always believed that the dull,
tragic reality of life is all there is,

700
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:25,819
- but you are proof that there's more.
- More what?

701
00:44:25,919 --> 00:44:30,363
More mystery, more magic.

702
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:32,619
Will you...

703
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,859
Dear. Boy.

704
00:44:35,959 --> 00:44:37,619
You leave this to me.

705
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:41,339
I did get a little anxious vibration when
the engine started smoking back there.

706
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:44,099
Don't worry, I'm gonna
have a look at this.

707
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:46,899
I actually have an inkling
as to what this might be.

708
00:44:46,999 --> 00:44:49,419
What are you gonna do?

709
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,139
Yes, not to worry.
I think it's the... I'm actually...

710
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:56,568
I'm actually rather good at
dealing with anything mechanical.

711
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:57,779
I don't understand it!

712
00:44:57,879 --> 00:45:00,899
I put the entire engine back together,
and I still have these two pieces.

713
00:45:00,999 --> 00:45:03,379
This doesn't make any sense.

714
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:06,299
- If I can just get these back into here...
- You should hurry. It's gonna rain.

715
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:07,779
Don't worry, it's not going to rain.

716
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,299
No, I think I can feel it already.

717
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:12,259
- No, the skies are clear...
- We gotta put the top up.

718
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,379
- I have to be able to do this...
- We have to put the top up.

719
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,859
- It's raining.
- No, please just give me a minute.

720
00:45:16,959 --> 00:45:18,459
- Stanley, come on...
- If I can only put this in here.

721
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,739
- We have to put the top up. Come here!
- All right.

722
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:22,979
You can't put the top up
without taking this off.

723
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,339
- What?
- How are you gonna do it without the...

724
00:45:24,439 --> 00:45:25,579
- The canopy has to come off.
- Okay, okay.

725
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,219
Okay, lift! Pull!

726
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:29,059
- It's stuck, it's stuck!
- All right.

727
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,939
No, don't do that.
You'll break it, you'll break it...

728
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:32,579
It's lightning, it's lightning.
We'll be killed.

729
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:34,539
- There must be a catch somewhere.
- What do we do?

730
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,219
- Get under the car!
- God, I don't want to go under the car!

731
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,539
It's fine. It's on four rubber wheels!
It can't get struck by lightning!

732
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:42,489
- Just go under there!
- No!

733
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:44,979
We're gonna die!

734
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:47,361
- Run! Run!
- Run?

735
00:45:50,879 --> 00:45:52,524
Stanley!

736
00:45:53,999 --> 00:45:55,419
Come now, I've got you.

737
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,219
- I've got you.
- Okay.

738
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:58,619
- My God!
- God, we're gonna die.

739
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:00,379
- I know this place!
- What?

740
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:01,619
I can... I know this place!

741
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:03,019
- How?
- We can go in there.

742
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,939
- Let's run! Go!
- Come on.

743
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:06,779
- Will it be open?
- Well, it'll be open!

744
00:46:06,879 --> 00:46:09,889
It always used to be open.

745
00:46:10,919 --> 00:46:14,099
- Goodness! I found that rather exhilarating.
- Did you see that lightning?

746
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:15,539
Goodness me.

747
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,899
I can't believe I found this place.

748
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:18,379
- What is this?
- It's an observatory.

749
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:21,139
- I came here as a boy.
- Thank God we found it.

750
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:23,059
We just got a little wet. It's water.

751
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:25,259
Are you kidding? We could've
been struck by lightning.

752
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,059
We could die of pneumonia.

753
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:29,779
I'm sure your fiancée
wouldn't be too pleased.

754
00:46:29,879 --> 00:46:32,339
Well, this would never have
happened if Olivia was here.

755
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:33,779
No?

756
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:37,019
She's too competent.
She'd have fixed the car.

757
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,659
Is she also a mechanic?

758
00:46:38,759 --> 00:46:41,099
Well, she's one of those people
who's good at everything.

759
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,299
How lucky for you.

760
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,819
- Yes, yes.
- That's...

761
00:46:43,919 --> 00:46:45,848
I suppose so.

762
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,604
What are you staring at?

763
00:46:52,439 --> 00:46:55,688
You have no idea how
miserable you look.

764
00:46:56,919 --> 00:47:00,259
I'm freezing. I mean, the...

765
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,539
Can you hold me, or something?

766
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:04,259
I can offer you my waistcoat.

767
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:05,779
No, you're wetter than I am.

768
00:47:05,879 --> 00:47:10,482
Just put an arm around me,
or you know... Body heat, it's...

769
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,819
My aunt used to bring
me here as a boy.

770
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:17,379
The roof opens up.

771
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:18,979
Really?

772
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:21,379
You can see the universe.

773
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:22,819
It's menacing.

774
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:24,299
Can you open it?

775
00:47:24,399 --> 00:47:26,619
I hardly think that's the
brightest idea at the moment.

776
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,401
- We just ran away from that.
It's still up there. - Right, right.

777
00:47:31,879 --> 00:47:34,810
Just have to wait it out.

778
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:41,019
What was so menacing
about the universe?

779
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:42,559
The size.

780
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:46,085
Of course, I was much smaller, then.

781
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,899
Poor Howard's car.

782
00:47:50,999 --> 00:47:52,849
Are you a little warmer now?

783
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:59,499
Tell me, with all your
powers of prognostication,

784
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,619
could you have ever predicted,

785
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:05,419
when you first saw me vanishing an
elephant onstage in my Chinese ensemble,

786
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:07,579
that you and I would one day

787
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,419
end up in a deserted celestial observatory
in a rainstorm in the south of France?

788
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,179
It's highly ironic.

789
00:48:15,279 --> 00:48:17,368
It's morbid.

790
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,290
I feel sleepy. I'm going
to have a little nap.

791
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:44,299
The rain stopped.

792
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:48,219
It stopped a while ago.
I didn't want to wake you.

793
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,899
You looked too peaceful sleeping.

794
00:48:50,999 --> 00:48:55,099
Yes, it's the first peaceful sleep
I've had in a very long time.

795
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,459
Does this thing open the roof?

796
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:02,128
Yes, let me show you.
I've never forgotten this.

797
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:19,481
You find that menacing?

798
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:22,245
No.

799
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,724
I'd say it was pretty romantic.

800
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:40,539
Who stole my heart away

801
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,539
Who makes me dream all day

802
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,480
Dreams I know can never come true

803
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,765
Seems as though I'll never be blue

804
00:49:52,879 --> 00:49:55,139
Who

805
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:58,979
Means my happiness
Who

806
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,283
Would I answer yes to

807
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:07,459
Well, you ought to guess who
Who?

808
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,727
No one, but you

809
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:13,161
Penny for your thoughts.

810
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,490
Nothing.

811
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,699
Well, you know what my thoughts are?
I've already told you I want to marry you.

812
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:24,739
That we'll get married at summer's
end at the Donaldsons' yacht.

813
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,299
It's enormous, and it can accommodate
all the guests we'd want to have.

814
00:50:28,399 --> 00:50:31,459
And then after the wedding,
we sail it, with those who wish,

815
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:33,179
from Monaco to Greece,

816
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:35,099
and then we honeymoon
on the Greek Islands.

817
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,401
What do you think?

818
00:50:39,479 --> 00:50:43,059
That's pretty swanky stuff
for a girl from Kalamazoo.

819
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:44,739
And then we'll live in Europe.

820
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,979
You'll run your foundation.
You'll be world-famous.

821
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:48,565
I'll be so proud of you.

822
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,379
You know, my mom has been so
happy since you've been here.

823
00:50:51,479 --> 00:50:55,525
Before you came, she was so glum,
and now she's all aglow.

824
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,779
Pierre! Bring the boxes up to
mademoiselle's room. Merci!

825
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:02,979
What are those?

826
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:06,459
Well, you know those dresses you were
fawning over when we walked through town?

827
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:09,219
I got them for you. All of them.

828
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:11,647
I told you I was gonna pamper you.

829
00:51:13,879 --> 00:51:15,319
Who?

830
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:19,804
Shall I sell the beach house
on the Jersey Shore?

831
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:22,539
Then, I won't.

832
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,339
I really didn't want to.
It has such sentimental meaning.

833
00:51:26,439 --> 00:51:28,379
I'm so glad you said that, Harry.

834
00:51:28,479 --> 00:51:30,522
Go on.

835
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:35,299
Harry, I hope this question
doesn't embarrass you,

836
00:51:35,399 --> 00:51:39,739
but I have to ask it.

837
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,406
Were you always faithful to me?

838
00:51:44,479 --> 00:51:46,419
I knew it!

839
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:49,539
Certain so-called friends of
mine suggested otherwise,

840
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,366
that you had a long affair
with Sally Summers.

841
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,499
No, I really didn't believe it.

842
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:01,299
But I'm ashamed
to admit, I did wonder.

843
00:52:01,399 --> 00:52:03,419
Harry...

844
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,565
I'm so relieved to know
that I was the only one.

845
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:13,281
I was the only one, wasn't I?

846
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,240
How wonderful you make me feel.

847
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,779
Well, look who's strolling
the grounds this morning!

848
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:25,139
Why aren't you in
your room, practicing?

849
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:27,219
I'm too excited to lock myself away.

850
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:28,459
What are you and Brice up to?

851
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,499
Brice is away for the week, in Paris.

852
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:32,819
Mother and I are going swimming.

853
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,979
I'm sure swimming isn't
your favorite pastime.

854
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:37,139
Nonsense. I accept your invitation.

855
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,579
Just need to buy a bathing suit,
and I'll, meet you by the pool.

856
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:40,979
We're not going to the pool.

857
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:42,419
We prefer to swim off the rocks.

858
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:44,299
The rocks? Even better.

859
00:52:44,399 --> 00:52:46,939
Live dangerously, I say.
You only live once.

860
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,339
Or maybe two or three times,

861
00:52:48,439 --> 00:52:51,040
depending on your
supply of ectoplasm.

862
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,099
You are a much better swimmer
than I would have imagined.

863
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:55,979
I'm also a much better dancer.

864
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:58,779
Really? You must take
me dancing sometime.

865
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:00,179
Perhaps I shall,

866
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:04,259
now that life is no longer weary,
stale, flat and unprofitable.

867
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:06,099
That's from something.

868
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:08,179
Is that Dickens?

869
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:09,819
Dear, poor thing.

870
00:53:09,919 --> 00:53:13,019
Madam, your wunderkind
has much catching up to do.

871
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,299
Isn't that Dickens?

872
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,010
That's Dickens.

873
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,539
The Seventh is actually
one of my favorites

874
00:53:39,639 --> 00:53:42,019
of Beethoven's symphonies,
but if you haven't heard them,

875
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,379
the string quartets are sublime.

876
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:47,939
Especially the late ones,
the... the 15th and the 16th.

877
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:50,659
Of course, they are rather
intellectually demanding,

878
00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:51,819
but that's the thing
about intelligence.

879
00:53:51,919 --> 00:53:53,419
You must never despair.

880
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,528
Yours can be raised.

881
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:05,899
You know, it's extraordinary.

882
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:09,219
I have smelled these
flowers a hundred times,

883
00:54:09,319 --> 00:54:13,459
and yet I have never really
smelled them until now.

884
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:15,219
What a pity.

885
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:18,779
All the rest of the human race
that you consider boobs,

886
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,059
smelling flowers and
you all left out.

887
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:23,019
Now, wait. Yes.

888
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,219
They... They've enjoyed,
but mindlessly,

889
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,579
because they never thought.
They never... They never stopped

890
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,299
for a moment to consider what a
rotten deal it all appears to be.

891
00:54:33,399 --> 00:54:36,419
To be born, to have
committed no crime,

892
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:38,721
and yet to be sentenced to death.

893
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,800
But notice I say, "Appears to be."

894
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:46,699
Alvin, hello. It's Stanley Crawford.

895
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,379
Yes, Wei Ling Crawford.

896
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:50,019
How are you?

897
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,339
Good, splendid.

898
00:54:51,439 --> 00:54:54,979
Listen, Alvin, I have the story
of a lifetime for your paper

899
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:57,659
and I wanted you to have it first.

900
00:54:57,759 --> 00:55:00,219
No... Well, yes, it is a...

901
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,059
It's a theatrical piece, but it's...
It's much more than that, much more.

902
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:05,899
It's science, it's...

903
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:09,328
It's philosophy, it's religion.

904
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:17,699
Brice is coming home
tonight from Paris.

905
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:20,259
The week went so fast.

906
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,483
Have you decided to accept
Brice's marriage proposal?

907
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,059
Well, he is pushing me very hard.

908
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:29,299
Well, I'd grab it if I were you.

909
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:30,459
I mean, it'd be logical.

910
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,539
An uneducated nobody from
some ridiculous-sounding city,

911
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:37,819
gifted, miraculously,
through no achievement of your own,

912
00:55:37,919 --> 00:55:40,779
and now you've developed
a taste for high living...

913
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:43,099
Yachts, motorcars.

914
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:45,139
You know, Stanley,

915
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:49,888
I'm not quite as desperate
as you make me out to be.

916
00:55:50,919 --> 00:55:53,779
There have actually
been a number of...

917
00:55:53,879 --> 00:55:56,659
I don't know, substantial men
who have fallen in love with me.

918
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:58,484
Really?

919
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:00,499
Well, you could've fooled me.

920
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,339
Although, with the ability you have,

921
00:56:02,439 --> 00:56:06,259
one does automatically
become intriguing...

922
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,019
And you do have agreeable features,

923
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:11,163
but it's your gift,
I'm sure, which is...

924
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:16,081
Well, I wouldn't say charming,
but it is impressive.

925
00:56:17,479 --> 00:56:21,001
I mean, even you just said
I have agreeable features.

926
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:22,939
They're more than agreeable.

927
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,287
Provided the light hits you just so.

928
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:28,739
Can I ask what time
of day that might be?

929
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,659
Just in case I ever need to look
my best for a job interview?

930
00:56:32,759 --> 00:56:35,179
Dusk. You're prettiest at about 8:20

931
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:37,379
in the summer,
when the light is fading.

932
00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:39,699
I see, the light must be fading,

933
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:42,001
so that I'm not too visible.

934
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,099
Exactly. I'm thinking when I do
the vanishing elephant trick,

935
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,448
you must be lit precisely
as I light the elephant.

936
00:56:49,759 --> 00:56:51,848
I don't think I'll pursue that.

937
00:56:52,599 --> 00:56:54,961
You coming to the ball,
at the palace?

938
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:57,019
Of course I am.

939
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,845
My whole life I've wanted
to go to a ball like that.

940
00:57:00,879 --> 00:57:02,059
Do you have a date?

941
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:03,739
I do, indeed.

942
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:06,819
I'm going with the most charming
woman in the south of France.

943
00:57:06,919 --> 00:57:08,644
My Aunt Vanessa.

944
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:11,219
I like her.

945
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:12,899
I am going to dance and drink

946
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:16,259
and enjoy all the things you
have brought to my life.

947
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:19,290
Maybe you and I can even
have a dance together.

948
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,579
Didn't you say that we might
have a dance together?

949
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,619
Your mental vibrations told
you my feet are killing me.

950
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:50,859
Please, be my guest.

951
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:52,659
She so appreciates your support.

952
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:54,802
Aunt Vanessa?

953
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:24,339
You know that you're
the only person tonight

954
00:59:24,439 --> 00:59:27,085
who hasn't made a comment
on my appearance.

955
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:30,179
I'm overwhelmed, Sophie.

956
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:33,219
I never dreamed you could
look this beautiful.

957
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:34,805
That's more like it.

958
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,019
You must have moved mountains
to achieve this effect.

959
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,923
Thanks.

960
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,379
And this is all without the
added benefit of the lighting

961
00:59:44,479 --> 00:59:46,488
that you give your elephant.

962
00:59:47,439 --> 00:59:50,882
You know, tomorrow I'm doing
that press conference about you.

963
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:56,050
Tell me, Stanley.

964
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:00,899
Apart from my gift,

965
01:00:00,999 --> 01:00:04,203
which has changed your life so...

966
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:09,563
Have you not, in the...

967
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:13,364
In the time that
we've spent together,

968
01:00:14,359 --> 01:00:17,219
had any other...

969
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:20,090
Thoughts about me?

970
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:23,619
Well, I've already told you,
I'm in awe of you.

971
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:25,779
I don't mean as a mystic.

972
01:00:25,879 --> 01:00:27,699
I'm...

973
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:29,888
I mean as a woman.

974
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,179
As a woman?

975
01:00:33,279 --> 01:00:34,619
What an odd question.

976
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:37,779
I've never technically
regarded you as a woman.

977
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:40,139
You were a charlatan who
turned the tables on me,

978
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:42,619
and now I feel both
humbled and proud.

979
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,762
You're proud of me?

980
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:47,019
You? No, I'm proud of myself

981
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:48,979
for being big enough to
admit that I was wrong

982
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:51,019
and foolish all these years.

983
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,419
I've been rather snobbish and...
And rude.

984
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:57,040
Condescending about
other people's faith.

985
01:00:57,679 --> 01:01:02,099
So you never thought
about me as a female?

986
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:04,299
Well, I was always certain
you were not of my sex,

987
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:06,059
if that's what you're asking.

988
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:07,819
And quite good to look at.

989
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:09,379
I mean, comparatively.

990
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:12,219
I've exposed some pretty
unattractive mediums,

991
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,219
a number of
horrible-looking creatures.

992
01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:17,819
You do understand,
I'm seriously considering

993
01:01:17,919 --> 01:01:20,059
marrying Brice Catledge?

994
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:22,248
Well, I think you'd be insane not to.

995
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:25,240
You don't see it as...

996
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,379
A little hasty of me?

997
01:01:28,479 --> 01:01:30,179
Well, it's you who can
foretell the future,

998
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:33,339
and I'm sure your vibrations
are very positive.

999
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,219
And common sense would
say that this man

1000
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:36,619
is a tremendous catch for you.

1001
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:40,339
Far beyond what you could hope,
given your trivial resume.

1002
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:42,539
And of course, now that
you're emerging as a...

1003
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,019
As a phenomenon, you'll always
be able to do quite well,

1004
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,539
financially, although nothing
like the Catledge fortune.

1005
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:50,779
And most of your time
will be spent with your...

1006
01:01:50,879 --> 01:01:53,889
Your foundation,
where he'll be a great help.

1007
01:01:54,279 --> 01:01:56,819
So the time that
we've spent together,

1008
01:01:56,919 --> 01:01:59,019
has just had...

1009
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,939
Had no impact on you...

1010
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:03,684
Whatsoever?

1011
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:08,367
I say, don't...

1012
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:12,970
You don't tell me you're experiencing
romantic feelings for me?

1013
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,339
What if I was?

1014
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:16,699
Well, that's absurd.

1015
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:20,287
You... You... You imagined
that you and I...

1016
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,939
Isn't it enough you've opened
my eyes to the joy of living?

1017
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:27,339
I mean, you've conquered my mind.

1018
01:02:27,439 --> 01:02:29,979
Do you, do you also need
to conquer my heart?

1019
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,203
I just thought, in the time
that we had spent together...

1020
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:35,659
That you...

1021
01:02:35,759 --> 01:02:37,579
Don't misunderstand me. I...

1022
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:40,059
I hold you in the highest
possible esteem, and tomorrow,

1023
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,579
I am prepared to tell
the world as much.

1024
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:44,040
Excuse me.

1025
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:52,459
There you are, Stanley.

1026
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,739
I don't know about you,
but I danced till dawn.

1027
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,579
Can you believe the little
medium has grown fond of me?

1028
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:00,819
Well, why shouldn't she?
According to the newspapers,

1029
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:02,219
you're her greatest press agent.

1030
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:04,779
No, no, I mean, I mean,
she's emotionally taken with me.

1031
01:03:04,879 --> 01:03:07,179
I believe she fancies herself
falling in love with me.

1032
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:08,579
But you're both spoken for.

1033
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:10,419
I know. It defies all reason.

1034
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:13,299
She's on the verge of
capturing a rich young man,

1035
01:03:13,399 --> 01:03:14,859
dullard that he is.

1036
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,459
And Olivia and I are,
by her own vibrations,

1037
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:19,099
the acme of congruity.

1038
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:22,179
Well, it seems you've given
the matter some thought.

1039
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:24,099
I was rather taken aback.

1040
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,779
She is looking rather
stunning this evening.

1041
01:03:26,879 --> 01:03:28,604
Yes, to be sure.

1042
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:31,299
She did make a rather

1043
01:03:31,399 --> 01:03:33,419
surprising entrance.

1044
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,739
Come, I've got to drive
back to Provence,

1045
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:40,361
and you have some journalists
to see in a few hours.

1046
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:46,610
How did you first
discover Miss Baker?

1047
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:50,379
I came to unmask her, as I
have done countless others,

1048
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:55,459
but after trying every which way,
came to the indisputable conclusion

1049
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:57,659
that she is a genuine medium.

1050
01:03:57,759 --> 01:03:59,499
How can you be so certain

1051
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:01,059
she's authentic?

1052
01:04:01,159 --> 01:04:03,139
I know all the tricks.

1053
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:04,779
Conjuring is my life's passion.

1054
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:07,659
Debunking fake mediums, my specialty.

1055
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:09,739
What are her plans for the future?

1056
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:13,805
She plans to start a foundation and
a school for teaching the occult.

1057
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:15,699
How does it feel to be wrong

1058
01:04:15,799 --> 01:04:18,819
all these years about the occult?

1059
01:04:18,919 --> 01:04:21,539
Well, on the one side,
I'm embarrassed,

1060
01:04:21,639 --> 01:04:24,339
but also thrilled to finally
be able to take a deep breath

1061
01:04:24,439 --> 01:04:26,339
and see new possibilities in life.

1062
01:04:26,439 --> 01:04:28,379
So, it is fair to say that you feel

1063
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:31,579
the world is not as
rational and predictable

1064
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:33,619
as you've always so adamantly,

1065
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:36,684
and sometimes insultingly, claimed?

1066
01:04:36,879 --> 01:04:39,019
I deserve your criticism, I know.

1067
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,539
I've always been a rational man
with a great faith in science.

1068
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:44,779
What can I say?

1069
01:04:44,879 --> 01:04:47,859
But it would appear that perhaps,

1070
01:04:47,959 --> 01:04:51,859
to say I believe in
the dignity of man

1071
01:04:51,959 --> 01:04:53,923
is simply not enough.

1072
01:04:55,879 --> 01:04:57,499
Even as a baby, it was clear

1073
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,899
from the very beginning
that she was a special child.

1074
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:01,699
It's gonna be a
world-class foundation.

1075
01:05:01,799 --> 01:05:03,819
Yes, there'll be students
from all over the world.

1076
01:05:03,919 --> 01:05:05,219
You have to see her.

1077
01:05:05,319 --> 01:05:07,859
They are very close friends of mine.
I came at once, but she stumped me,

1078
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:10,059
so I brought in Mr. Wei
Ling Soo under an alias

1079
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:11,539
to unmask her.

1080
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:13,379
Now you see the result.

1081
01:05:13,479 --> 01:05:15,019
And damned if he isn't
her biggest fan.

1082
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,339
There you are. Excuse me.

1083
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:19,019
- I have some seriously distressing news.
- What?

1084
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:20,739
Your aunt's been in a serious
automobile accident.

1085
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:22,219
What happened? Is she all right?

1086
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:24,979
- She's in critical condition at the hospital.
- I need to get there.

1087
01:05:25,079 --> 01:05:26,779
- Yes, of course, I'll drive you.
- Do you want me...

1088
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:28,729
To come with you? I know the way...

1089
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,539
Jacques.

1090
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:49,139
Bonjour, George.

1091
01:05:49,239 --> 01:05:51,699
- This is Stanley.
- Yes, how do you do?

1092
01:05:51,799 --> 01:05:54,240
So, how's she doing?
What's happening?

1093
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:57,779
- What was...
- En anglais.

1094
01:05:57,879 --> 01:06:00,179
She's in the operating room now.

1095
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:01,539
Everyone is doing his best.

1096
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:04,179
So what do you think?
Is she going to be all right?

1097
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:06,939
At this moment, it's touch-and-go.

1098
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,579
Touch-and-go?

1099
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:10,299
You... You can wait there,
if you want.

1100
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:11,979
- Touch-and-go.
- You're in surgery with her?

1101
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:13,849
Yeah, I know.

1102
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:22,139
Now, don't worry.
They have an excellent staff here.

1103
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:23,779
You know, she's an incredible woman.

1104
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:25,659
She practically raised me.

1105
01:06:25,759 --> 01:06:27,819
She's been through a lot in her life.

1106
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:29,579
Sit down. Let me get you some tea.

1107
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:31,819
No, I'm too shaken up for tea.

1108
01:06:31,919 --> 01:06:33,579
Well, perhaps I can
scare up a whiskey?

1109
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:35,139
Better idea.

1110
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:36,819
You know, she shouldn't be
allowed to drive at her age.

1111
01:06:36,919 --> 01:06:39,259
Well, it's in the hands
of the doctors now.

1112
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,299
I know how helpless one feels,

1113
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:44,939
but all you can do is
just keep calm and pray.

1114
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:46,739
Yes.

1115
01:06:46,839 --> 01:06:48,979
The power of prayer.

1116
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:51,899
- Always ridiculed it.
- As have I.

1117
01:06:51,999 --> 01:06:54,819
And yet, some people swear by it.

1118
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:57,579
You know, I know this sounds crass,

1119
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:01,699
particularly coming from me,
a man of science, but...

1120
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:03,419
If the worst happens,

1121
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,019
at least through Sophie,

1122
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,880
you'll be able to contact her spirit.

1123
01:07:09,279 --> 01:07:10,890
Yes.

1124
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:12,859
Yes, that's comforting, isn't it?

1125
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:14,099
Yes.

1126
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:16,640
I never thought I'd say it, but yes.

1127
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:18,659
Well, you buck up,

1128
01:07:18,759 --> 01:07:21,121
and I will find that whiskey.

1129
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:54,045
I don't know if you can hear me

1130
01:07:56,159 --> 01:08:00,379
and I haven't always led
an exemplary life. I've...

1131
01:08:00,479 --> 01:08:03,499
I've not only been a skeptic,

1132
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,939
a non-believer,
but been much worse...

1133
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,459
A man with contempt for...

1134
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,579
For people who give themselves
over to the idea that...

1135
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:18,645
That there's some kind of
benevolent father figure up there.

1136
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,899
I've always said it was childish,
wishful thinking, strictly for primitives,

1137
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,499
all these, all these hopes about a...

1138
01:08:26,599 --> 01:08:27,819
A purpose for life,

1139
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:30,539
a larger meaning.

1140
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:34,819
That all our suffering will
somehow accrue to some...

1141
01:08:34,919 --> 01:08:37,121
Greater plan.

1142
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:44,564
But if what I see of late is real

1143
01:08:46,519 --> 01:08:49,165
then I don't have all the answers.

1144
01:08:49,999 --> 01:08:52,619
It's possible,

1145
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,619
even logical, that...

1146
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,619
We are here by design,

1147
01:08:57,719 --> 01:09:00,081
to search some higher ideal.

1148
01:09:01,959 --> 01:09:04,059
And that you...

1149
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:06,088
Could be real.

1150
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:14,459
And although I have no
right to expect anything,

1151
01:09:14,559 --> 01:09:16,939
my aunt,

1152
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:18,459
whom I love,

1153
01:09:18,559 --> 01:09:20,761
is in mortal danger.

1154
01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:24,961
And so, I ask you...

1155
01:09:26,679 --> 01:09:28,881
I ask you...

1156
01:09:38,599 --> 01:09:40,528
Wait a minute.

1157
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:46,819
This is the stupidest

1158
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:50,328
load of twaddle I have ever heard.

1159
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:54,659
My common sense tells me,

1160
01:09:54,759 --> 01:09:57,819
I'm falling into a seductive morass

1161
01:09:57,919 --> 01:10:02,010
of sugarcoated claptrap because
I want my aunt to be all right.

1162
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:07,939
That girl...

1163
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:10,207
Is a fake.

1164
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:14,699
I told you the surgeons
were wonderful.

1165
01:10:14,799 --> 01:10:15,859
Should I not stay?

1166
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:17,379
Well, there's nothing
for you to do here.

1167
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,299
She's sleeping comfortably.
She responded well to the drugs.

1168
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:22,899
The surgery went beautifully.
She's out of danger.

1169
01:10:22,999 --> 01:10:25,699
You know, after you left,
I began to pray for her.

1170
01:10:25,799 --> 01:10:26,859
Really?

1171
01:10:26,959 --> 01:10:30,099
Then I rejected the entire
notion as pure poppycock.

1172
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:32,459
And that includes Miss Sophie Baker.

1173
01:10:32,559 --> 01:10:33,899
Is that right?

1174
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:36,179
Well, if Sophie is a fraud,

1175
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:39,881
then how does she do what she does?

1176
01:11:06,519 --> 01:11:07,699
Stanley!

1177
01:11:07,799 --> 01:11:09,099
- We were all so worried.
- So worried!

1178
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,099
You can imagine how anxious we were

1179
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:12,419
about your Aunt Vanessa.

1180
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:14,739
- Yes!
- Thank God!

1181
01:11:14,839 --> 01:11:19,099
Madam, I can assure you,
God had nothing to do with it.

1182
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:20,844
She had good doctors.

1183
01:11:20,959 --> 01:11:24,059
Yeah, we have all been
on tenterhooks, Stanley.

1184
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,099
Well, couldn't Sophie have
predicted the outcome

1185
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,139
and put all your minds at ease?

1186
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,019
Me? I didn't even know.

1187
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,059
I was so mobbed
by all the press, I...

1188
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,939
If I had known, I would have
gone with you to the hospital.

1189
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:36,179
Well, it's all over.

1190
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:38,659
And, "All's well that ends well."

1191
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:40,609
That's not Dickens.

1192
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:43,259
Well, now that
everything's ended well,

1193
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,579
shall we repair to the garden?

1194
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,779
- Brice? Mrs. Baker?
- Me? Great idea.

1195
01:11:47,879 --> 01:11:50,499
I'm so excited about the further
details of the foundation.

1196
01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:52,939
- I want to talk over...
- Actually, there are a few financial details...

1197
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:54,579
Mother, I'm just gonna stay here.

1198
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:55,859
And thank you, by the way.

1199
01:11:55,959 --> 01:12:00,164
And I really want to go into
some detail about how much...

1200
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,499
Stanley, I can't imagine what has
been going through your mind.

1201
01:12:04,599 --> 01:12:06,939
I mean, Aunt Vanessa's
such a dear woman.

1202
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:09,099
Yes, well, a man in a
hospital waiting room

1203
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,939
while a loved one is under the
knife has many feverish thoughts.

1204
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:14,619
I imagined that if I prayed

1205
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,001
my prayers might be heard.

1206
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:19,099
You thought of praying?

1207
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,139
I never imagined I would
hear those words.

1208
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:25,419
And my ace in the hole,
so to speak, was that...

1209
01:12:25,519 --> 01:12:27,339
Even if the worst had
happened and Aunt Vanessa

1210
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:29,819
had sadly passed away,
you could always put me in touch

1211
01:12:29,919 --> 01:12:32,419
with her in the spirit world,
and that...

1212
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,499
That rather put a smile on my face.

1213
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:37,339
Well, in the end, she pulled through.

1214
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:39,019
Well, you look exhausted.

1215
01:12:39,119 --> 01:12:40,459
Well, can you blame me?

1216
01:12:40,559 --> 01:12:44,139
What I need now is a good
bath and a nap and...

1217
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,419
- So, if you'll excuse me...
- Yes, of course.

1218
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:48,448
Stanley...

1219
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:51,819
I'm so relieved about Aunt Vanessa.

1220
01:12:51,919 --> 01:12:54,179
She's such a marvelous woman.

1221
01:12:54,279 --> 01:12:56,179
Yeah, she's so lovely.

1222
01:12:56,279 --> 01:12:57,979
We should break open the champagne.

1223
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:00,259
We should celebrate.

1224
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:02,939
Aunt Vanessa's recovered.
Not to mention

1225
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:08,405
that I find this whole thing
a most rewarding experience.

1226
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:12,043
You feel no remorse?

1227
01:13:13,039 --> 01:13:14,619
Why should I feel remorse?

1228
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:17,570
Hoodwinking a lifelong friend.

1229
01:13:19,719 --> 01:13:20,979
I see it quite differently.

1230
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:23,327
Hoodwinking is what we do.

1231
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:26,139
Now, you've got to understand
that since we were boys,

1232
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:27,979
I have played second fiddle

1233
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:30,019
to that egomaniacal,
self-regarding...

1234
01:13:30,119 --> 01:13:31,179
Genius.

1235
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:32,779
Yeah, he's a genius at what he does,

1236
01:13:32,879 --> 01:13:35,419
and I turned out to be a mere mortal.

1237
01:13:35,519 --> 01:13:39,059
But now, after years
of trailing in his wake,

1238
01:13:39,159 --> 01:13:41,219
and I admit,
some envy and resentment,

1239
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:45,699
I have finally put one over
the great Wei Ling Soo.

1240
01:13:45,799 --> 01:13:49,939
I have fooled the man
who could not be fooled.

1241
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:52,924
Not quite, Howard.

1242
01:13:54,119 --> 01:13:56,379
- How did...
- You admired this effect when

1243
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,299
you saw my show in Berlin.

1244
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:00,339
I said I'd teach it to you
if you behaved yourself,

1245
01:14:00,439 --> 01:14:02,880
but you have not behaved.

1246
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,099
It's a trick, Sophie.

1247
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,659
I don't really dematerialize
and reassemble my ectoplasm

1248
01:14:08,759 --> 01:14:11,979
any more than you contact
spirits or read minds.

1249
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,579
Stanley, I can explain...

1250
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,099
I watched you so closely.

1251
01:14:16,199 --> 01:14:18,339
Howard watched your mother,

1252
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,768
but who watched Howard?

1253
01:14:22,839 --> 01:14:24,459
You were free to rap on the table.

1254
01:14:24,559 --> 01:14:26,619
You seized the floating candle,
you swore there were no wires

1255
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,619
making it float, and I
took you at your word.

1256
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:32,659
You were free to rap
once for yes, twice for no.

1257
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:35,539
And when Sophie excused
herself at my aunt's

1258
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:39,019
to make a telephone call,
she called you

1259
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:43,324
and you fed her information
about my aunt.

1260
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:46,566
At first, I couldn't believe
you would betray me like that.

1261
01:14:47,999 --> 01:14:49,859
But, as you know,

1262
01:14:49,959 --> 01:14:52,019
I am a misanthrope.

1263
01:14:52,119 --> 01:14:53,899
And that people do
unconscionable things

1264
01:14:53,999 --> 01:14:57,179
does not run counter to my
normal view of humanity.

1265
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,939
As boys, we both chose
magic as our calling.

1266
01:15:01,039 --> 01:15:04,739
We both practiced day and night,
I as much as you.

1267
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:08,979
My skill was the equal of yours,
and yet, you emerged

1268
01:15:09,079 --> 01:15:12,123
onto the world stage
as the great artist.

1269
01:15:12,599 --> 01:15:13,819
But it wasn't fair.

1270
01:15:13,919 --> 01:15:16,360
Life's not fair, Howard.

1271
01:15:16,839 --> 01:15:21,124
In fact, as a general rule, as I've
often said, it's pretty nasty.

1272
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:24,124
Because of Sophie,

1273
01:15:24,759 --> 01:15:27,530
I began to succumb
to magical thinking.

1274
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:31,450
And for a while,
I was actually happy.

1275
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:34,379
But I was happy as a fool is happy.

1276
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:37,219
Happiness is not the
natural human condition.

1277
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:39,659
And incidentally, you never
practiced as much as I did,

1278
01:15:39,759 --> 01:15:41,459
and your skill was
never equal to mine.

1279
01:15:41,559 --> 01:15:42,979
Stanley, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

1280
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:46,259
I ran into Howard here when he
was sent to expose me, and he...

1281
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:49,099
He did expose me, quite easily.

1282
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,179
But we made this private
pact to do this scheme,

1283
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,564
and I only agreed because it
meant so much to Mom and me.

1284
01:15:56,039 --> 01:15:58,779
I view your behavior as...

1285
01:15:58,879 --> 01:16:02,259
A great man views the
malicious mischief of...

1286
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:04,819
What shall we say, pygmy?

1287
01:16:04,919 --> 01:16:06,419
You're a fake.

1288
01:16:06,519 --> 01:16:09,699
As I always should have known,
and did, in my heart.

1289
01:16:09,799 --> 01:16:12,843
I only wish I hadn't wasted
so much time with you.

1290
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:18,299
Well, now you're just being
a pompous stick in the mud.

1291
01:16:18,399 --> 01:16:20,579
We played an elaborate
joke on you, Stanley.

1292
01:16:20,679 --> 01:16:22,299
No one was harmed.

1293
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,579
My reputation will suffer,
and you played me for a fool.

1294
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,059
Your reputation is all ego!

1295
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:29,579
I've...

1296
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,059
Yes, yes, things got out of hand,
but no awful thing happened.

1297
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:35,259
I mean, you were... You were happy.

1298
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:37,699
And you enjoyed life for once.

1299
01:16:37,799 --> 01:16:40,579
You saw the world as
optimists see the world.

1300
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,259
And we had some laughs
together, so don't...

1301
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:44,779
Say that you wasted
your time with me.

1302
01:16:44,879 --> 01:16:46,499
What would you have been doing?

1303
01:16:46,599 --> 01:16:50,419
Sitting in your room and shuffling
cards in front of a mirror?

1304
01:16:50,519 --> 01:16:52,579
All my optimism was an illusion.

1305
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:54,339
Well, I started reading that book

1306
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:56,939
by that German philosopher,
you know, that you gave me?

1307
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:58,979
I didn't really
understand much of it,

1308
01:16:59,079 --> 01:17:02,099
but he said that we need
our illusions to live.

1309
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:03,730
You mean lies.

1310
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:07,379
You were much happier when you
let some lies into your life, Stanley.

1311
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:10,619
Think about it, Stanley, do you
really want to ruin the peace of mind

1312
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:11,779
Grace Catledge has,

1313
01:17:11,879 --> 01:17:15,299
secure in the knowledge that
she is her husband's only love?

1314
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:17,339
We can't go around
deluding ourselves.

1315
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,579
But we must.

1316
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,139
If we're to get through life.

1317
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:26,763
I mean, I didn't say it,
I'm just quoting, you know, Mister...

1318
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:29,499
Nietzsche.

1319
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:32,019
And, in the end, who really knows

1320
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:33,659
- what's real and what's not?
- Well, it's quite clear

1321
01:17:33,759 --> 01:17:35,939
what's real, my praying
for my aunt was poppycock,

1322
01:17:36,039 --> 01:17:37,619
the doctor's skill was real.

1323
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:40,459
No. You will never know that,
because George,

1324
01:17:40,559 --> 01:17:43,339
Caroline's husband,
the psychoanalyst,

1325
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,819
told me that he was praying
for your aunt, too.

1326
01:17:45,919 --> 01:17:47,259
And so we don't know if maybe

1327
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:49,499
it was his prayers that got answered.

1328
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:51,608
Maybe the angels like him better.

1329
01:17:51,759 --> 01:17:54,819
I won't dignify this
conversation any longer.

1330
01:17:54,919 --> 01:17:56,419
I'm going to go and
visit my Aunt Vanessa

1331
01:17:56,519 --> 01:17:59,339
until she's on her feet,
and then good-bye.

1332
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:01,459
And you won't forgive me?

1333
01:18:01,559 --> 01:18:03,339
Well, I can't forgive you.

1334
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:05,779
Only God can forgive you.

1335
01:18:05,879 --> 01:18:08,047
But you said there is no God.

1336
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:11,281
Precisely my point.

1337
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:10,379
It's good to be home.

1338
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:13,459
More robust than ever, I'll wager.

1339
01:19:13,559 --> 01:19:15,139
"What doesn't kill me...

1340
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:18,219
"Makes me stronger."
A great man said that.

1341
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:19,899
Not the "God is dead" fellow.

1342
01:19:19,999 --> 01:19:22,739
- The very same.
- Nevertheless, I think he was wrong.

1343
01:19:22,839 --> 01:19:24,819
What doesn't kill us often
knocks the hell out of us.

1344
01:19:24,919 --> 01:19:28,441
Well, sometimes a close
call wakes a person up.

1345
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,899
I've had another idea
for our honeymoon.

1346
01:19:31,999 --> 01:19:33,979
What if, after the Greek Islands,

1347
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:35,699
we set sail for the South Seas.

1348
01:19:35,799 --> 01:19:37,859
I've always wanted
to visit Bora-Bora.

1349
01:19:37,959 --> 01:19:39,259
Would that interest you?

1350
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:40,979
I've never... I've never heard of it,

1351
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:43,659
but the name sounds pretty exotic.

1352
01:19:43,759 --> 01:19:45,927
Exotic?

1353
01:19:46,359 --> 01:19:49,403
I love how you pick always
the exact right word.

1354
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:55,459
Yes, of course, Olivia.
I'll be home in a few days.

1355
01:19:55,559 --> 01:19:57,979
I just have to see that Aunt
Vanessa is up and running,

1356
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:00,939
and I have one or two press
interviews I have to do.

1357
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:02,939
Some things need to be smoothed over.

1358
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:05,139
This is where I could use your tact.

1359
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:07,579
Yes, of course. Yes.

1360
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,449
Bye, darling.

1361
01:20:10,999 --> 01:20:12,939
I bet you'll be glad
to get back to London

1362
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:14,968
and put all this behind you.

1363
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,299
You might enjoy the Galapagos.

1364
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:22,099
You're a great admirer of Darwin's.

1365
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:25,448
Big turtles. Yes, I suppose so.

1366
01:20:26,959 --> 01:20:30,003
And of course, you must miss Olivia.

1367
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:37,299
A very fine woman. I can tell
that from her photographs.

1368
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,139
Such elegance and style.

1369
01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:41,819
Absolutely perfect for
a man of your taste.

1370
01:20:41,919 --> 01:20:44,099
Well, yes, it's, there's no question.

1371
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:46,659
We're ideally suited.

1372
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:50,179
A very... And you need
a well-educated woman

1373
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:52,561
to keep up with you.

1374
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:55,259
And she's quite attractive, to boot.

1375
01:20:55,359 --> 01:20:58,619
Yes, yes, it's very easy to see us

1376
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,299
side by side through life's journey.

1377
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:04,499
A very handsome couple indeed.

1378
01:21:04,599 --> 01:21:07,299
Yes, there's no question.
We're ideally suited.

1379
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:09,219
As you would say.

1380
01:21:09,319 --> 01:21:12,459
A quite rational choice.

1381
01:21:12,559 --> 01:21:15,379
I mean, it's not entirely cerebral.

1382
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:17,499
I mean, I do love her.

1383
01:21:17,599 --> 01:21:18,979
What are you suggesting?

1384
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:22,179
- Suggesting?
- In the nuance of your tone?

1385
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:24,099
Of course I love her.

1386
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:28,099
Or are you saying you think
I've come to love Sophie Baker?

1387
01:21:28,199 --> 01:21:30,539
Me? I never mentioned Sophie.

1388
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,259
Well, I thought you
were heading there.

1389
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:34,859
Sophie Baker? The little fake
who played you for a dupe?

1390
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:36,539
Exactly. That wretch.

1391
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,539
Why would I suggest you've
fallen in love with Sophie?

1392
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:40,059
Well, you might.

1393
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,539
I never know what goes on
in that devious mind of yours.

1394
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,419
The very idea of you and that
specious American telepathic.

1395
01:21:47,519 --> 01:21:49,779
Well, I know it defies all reason.

1396
01:21:49,879 --> 01:21:53,379
You, a creature of reason.
A man of intellect.

1397
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:56,059
- To be sure.
- Certainly not trivial.

1398
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:57,699
No, to say the least.

1399
01:21:57,799 --> 01:22:00,525
And she's hardly in the
same class as Olivia.

1400
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:03,179
The comparison makes me laugh.

1401
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:05,699
Olivia is a person of
accomplishment and charm.

1402
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:07,059
Sophie's a street finagler

1403
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:10,099
who makes her way living off
one bit of hokum to the next.

1404
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,299
Well, I don't see how you
can compare the two.

1405
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:14,939
Well, don't put ideas into my head!

1406
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,241
Well, far be it from me.

1407
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:25,979
Of course, she does come
from dire circumstances.

1408
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:28,419
I mean, it's very
easy to be judgmental

1409
01:22:28,519 --> 01:22:30,579
about people who are
born into circumstances

1410
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,659
less fortunate than one's own.

1411
01:22:32,759 --> 01:22:34,099
Life is harsh.

1412
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,459
One must do what one must to survive.

1413
01:22:36,559 --> 01:22:37,779
Well put.

1414
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:39,819
And people do sometimes
make the wrong choices,

1415
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:41,819
which they regret,

1416
01:22:41,919 --> 01:22:45,619
even though no serious harm was done.

1417
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:48,339
Which of us has not made
some blunders in life?

1418
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:52,099
And there is a rather appealing
quality about Sophie.

1419
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,179
Despite her disgusting behavior.

1420
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:58,779
Yes, her smile is rather winning.

1421
01:22:58,879 --> 01:23:00,299
Of course, it depends how much value

1422
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:01,819
you put on the purely physical.

1423
01:23:01,919 --> 01:23:03,619
Well, no, I...

1424
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,779
I, for one, esteem
the higher virtues.

1425
01:23:06,879 --> 01:23:09,127
Beauty of the soul.

1426
01:23:11,559 --> 01:23:15,081
Although her eyes are rather
pleasant to look into.

1427
01:23:15,559 --> 01:23:18,139
And that she can be amusing,
under the right circumstances.

1428
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,539
But Olivia is an educated,
cultivated woman.

1429
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:24,219
One that befits a man
of your artistic genius.

1430
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:27,019
Yes, now, my genius
must be factored in.

1431
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:31,819
On paper, there's really no reason
to prefer Sophie to Olivia.

1432
01:23:31,919 --> 01:23:33,962
Well, I would say the opposite.

1433
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:37,899
And so your suggestion that I,

1434
01:23:37,999 --> 01:23:42,659
I be honest with Olivia and tell
her that irrational as it seems,

1435
01:23:42,759 --> 01:23:45,139
I've fallen in love with Sophie...

1436
01:23:45,239 --> 01:23:47,739
That's a preposterous notion.

1437
01:23:47,839 --> 01:23:50,121
It's lunacy.

1438
01:23:52,959 --> 01:23:54,379
Yet I can't help feeling that...

1439
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:57,139
That you love Sophie.

1440
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:58,699
Yes, I understand.

1441
01:23:58,799 --> 01:24:00,619
You're puzzled and bewildered

1442
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:02,539
because your foolish logic

1443
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,299
tells you that you
should love Olivia.

1444
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:06,659
Foolish logic?

1445
01:24:06,759 --> 01:24:09,219
And yet, how little that logic means

1446
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:12,059
when placed next to Sophie's smile.

1447
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,123
What are you saying?

1448
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:18,899
That the world may or may
not be without purpose,

1449
01:24:18,999 --> 01:24:22,920
but it's not totally without
some kind of magic.

1450
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,843
I have irrational positive
feelings for Sophie Baker.

1451
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:31,539
It's like witnessing a
trick I can't figure out.

1452
01:24:31,639 --> 01:24:34,299
I wouldn't try to figure it out.
I'd simply move on it.

1453
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,240
Word is, she's already accepted
Brice Catledge's proposal.

1454
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,684
Taken to reading the great books?

1455
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:02,924
Yes.

1456
01:25:03,599 --> 01:25:06,899
Well, you once said not to despair.

1457
01:25:06,999 --> 01:25:09,042
There's hope for my brain.

1458
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,259
Perhaps I was a bit caustic.

1459
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,484
But you will admit you were guilty
of some rather sleazy doings.

1460
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,259
Yes, well, those days are over.

1461
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:21,619
I no longer have to worry about

1462
01:25:21,719 --> 01:25:25,099
where to sleep and how to eat.

1463
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,846
I take it Brice Catledge has made
a serious marriage proposal?

1464
01:25:29,399 --> 01:25:30,819
Yes.

1465
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:32,619
A very tempting one.

1466
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:34,099
Wouldn't you agree?

1467
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:36,459
Yes, I suppose so.

1468
01:25:36,559 --> 01:25:39,205
But I'm here to make you
a more tempting one.

1469
01:25:39,839 --> 01:25:41,564
More tempting than this?

1470
01:25:42,879 --> 01:25:44,299
I came to say

1471
01:25:44,399 --> 01:25:45,979
that for some inexplicable reason

1472
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,601
that defies common sense
and human understanding,

1473
01:25:50,519 --> 01:25:52,579
that I have, of late,

1474
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:54,579
experienced some small...

1475
01:25:54,679 --> 01:25:57,419
Quite small, but discernible

1476
01:25:57,519 --> 01:26:00,370
inner stirrings regarding your smile.

1477
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,059
How magnanimous of you.

1478
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:03,899
Yes, I thought you'd think so.

1479
01:26:03,999 --> 01:26:06,219
And possessing a soul which is large

1480
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:09,579
and capable of complexity,
as all great minds are,

1481
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,699
I have decided to forgive you

1482
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,286
and take you under my wing.

1483
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,083
Your wing?

1484
01:26:17,559 --> 01:26:19,979
It's a saying. Obviously,
I don't have wings.

1485
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:22,539
I only mean that...

1486
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:23,979
Incredible as it sounds,

1487
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:26,299
and this is no small gesture,
given the time wasted

1488
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:28,259
and the public embarrassment
you've caused me,

1489
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:30,619
that I'm...

1490
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,921
Willing to take you back.

1491
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:35,083
Take me back where?

1492
01:26:35,719 --> 01:26:38,490
Under the moon in the observatory.

1493
01:26:38,759 --> 01:26:42,379
I regretted what I was doing,

1494
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:44,299
but I was too inept to change course,

1495
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,179
and I apologize.

1496
01:26:48,279 --> 01:26:49,579
Really.

1497
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:50,819
And I accept your forgiveness.

1498
01:26:50,919 --> 01:26:52,979
I understand that it's
very generous of you,

1499
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:54,659
and I have to be going.

1500
01:26:54,759 --> 01:26:57,379
Going? I haven't said
what I came for.

1501
01:26:57,479 --> 01:26:59,179
Well, then just say it and go,

1502
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:02,005
because I have a dinner
to go to with my fiancé.

1503
01:27:02,799 --> 01:27:04,859
I'm here to say

1504
01:27:04,959 --> 01:27:07,299
that in spite of everything,

1505
01:27:07,399 --> 01:27:10,125
I am willing to
consider marrying you.

1506
01:27:10,519 --> 01:27:12,059
- What?
- Naturally,

1507
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:15,841
you can't believe your good fortune.
I appreciate that.

1508
01:27:16,519 --> 01:27:19,179
Stanley, brilliant as you
are with a deck of cards,

1509
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:23,040
you are terrible at proposing.

1510
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,379
- I've never proposed before.
- Really?

1511
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:28,681
Not even to your fiancée?

1512
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:31,219
She proposed marriage.

1513
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:34,259
The truth is I've never really
felt the urge to propose before.

1514
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:35,659
Use your head!

1515
01:27:35,759 --> 01:27:38,459
We're not a match made in heaven,

1516
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:41,819
and as you've said before many times,

1517
01:27:41,919 --> 01:27:45,043
when the heart rules
the head, disaster follows.

1518
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:47,739
But the fact is...

1519
01:27:47,839 --> 01:27:50,099
I love you.

1520
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:53,899
And somewhere in your confused,
black, little criminal's heart,

1521
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:55,724
you care for me.

1522
01:27:55,879 --> 01:27:58,099
I'm marrying Brice Catledge.

1523
01:27:58,199 --> 01:27:59,899
You advised me to.

1524
01:27:59,999 --> 01:28:01,579
You must never take my advice.

1525
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:02,619
I'm a major eccentric.

1526
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:04,099
You know, Brice adores me,

1527
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:07,379
and he offers me a life of travel

1528
01:28:07,479 --> 01:28:10,259
- and excitement and high living.
- No, no,

1529
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:12,339
he worships you, and you
don't want to be worshiped.

1530
01:28:12,439 --> 01:28:13,659
You'll be bored.

1531
01:28:13,759 --> 01:28:15,659
Sailing to the Greek Islands?

1532
01:28:15,759 --> 01:28:17,179
And Bora-Bora?

1533
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:19,259
Well, they're just,
they're just rocks in the ocean!

1534
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:20,899
It's who you go with!

1535
01:28:20,999 --> 01:28:22,859
Do you want to spend the
rest of your life with a man

1536
01:28:22,959 --> 01:28:26,299
who plays the ukulele
and croons to you?

1537
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,000
You know I like you
very much, Stanley.

1538
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,849
I even began falling
in love with you.

1539
01:28:33,959 --> 01:28:38,259
But when you went on to show
me how irrational it was,

1540
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:40,139
and then you proved it

1541
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,179
- with geometrical logic.
- No...

1542
01:28:42,279 --> 01:28:44,619
Geometry was never my strong subject.

1543
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:47,459
After all, what can you offer me?

1544
01:28:47,559 --> 01:28:49,099
Grumpy moods?

1545
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,779
Insults?

1546
01:28:50,879 --> 01:28:55,619
Pessimistic grumbling about
how awful life is for all of us?

1547
01:28:55,719 --> 01:28:57,499
Well, around you, I'm not gloomy.

1548
01:28:57,599 --> 01:28:59,499
That's only because I fooled you

1549
01:28:59,599 --> 01:29:02,419
into thinking that there's more
to life than meets the eye.

1550
01:29:02,519 --> 01:29:05,179
No, no, I have not lost my pessimism,

1551
01:29:05,279 --> 01:29:09,979
but you are like an oasis
in the grim desert.

1552
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:12,619
And as far as what I can offer you,

1553
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:15,923
life with a brilliant
and witty genius.

1554
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:18,219
I have to go.

1555
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:20,059
No, this is your last offer.

1556
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,659
You must not be an ingrate.

1557
01:29:21,759 --> 01:29:22,859
Good-bye, Stanley.

1558
01:29:22,959 --> 01:29:25,179
I will not stand around here,
cap in hand,

1559
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:28,847
waiting for some halfpenny
con artist to be my bride!

1560
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:30,739
This is it. You don't agree now,

1561
01:29:30,839 --> 01:29:32,779
offer's off the table.

1562
01:29:32,879 --> 01:29:34,019
Do you hear me?

1563
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,779
You irritating Lilliputian!

1564
01:29:35,879 --> 01:29:39,003
You're throwing away your
passport to paradise!

1565
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:42,179
Can you forgive me, Stanley?

1566
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:44,219
I have forgiven you, Howard,

1567
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:46,339
as I've forgiven Sophie.

1568
01:29:46,439 --> 01:29:49,219
I agree, I needed a pie in the face.

1569
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:51,499
Well, I saw a side of you in
this I've never seen before.

1570
01:29:51,599 --> 01:29:53,819
It was refreshing.

1571
01:29:53,919 --> 01:29:57,859
Even now, Sophie's smile
still penetrates my soul.

1572
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,259
Now you believe we have souls?

1573
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:02,379
No, I believe each of
us must find a reason

1574
01:30:02,479 --> 01:30:04,219
to truly embrace life,

1575
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:06,859
and for me, Sophie is that reason.

1576
01:30:06,959 --> 01:30:09,499
Well, if nothing else,
it's made you certain

1577
01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:11,939
it would've been a
mistake to marry Olivia.

1578
01:30:12,039 --> 01:30:14,179
I spoke to Olivia on the telephone.

1579
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:16,579
She's much less upset
than I'd anticipated.

1580
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:20,219
Very calm, very reasonable.

1581
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:21,819
She's in the Galapagos.

1582
01:30:21,919 --> 01:30:24,219
She said she was disappointed,

1583
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:26,579
but she understood that
these things happen,

1584
01:30:26,679 --> 01:30:29,419
and if I was still going to feel
this way when I returned,

1585
01:30:29,519 --> 01:30:31,499
it's much better we found out now.

1586
01:30:31,599 --> 01:30:33,859
What a lovely, rational human being.

1587
01:30:33,959 --> 01:30:35,379
I should look her up.

1588
01:30:35,479 --> 01:30:38,569
She's bright, pretty,
she likes magicians.

1589
01:31:17,559 --> 01:31:19,779
Well, how did it go?

1590
01:31:19,879 --> 01:31:22,446
Can you believe she turned me down?

1591
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:25,608
Poor Stanley.

1592
01:31:25,759 --> 01:31:28,299
That scamp could've had me,

1593
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:31,019
but instead, she chose
Brice Catledge.

1594
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:34,459
Well, he is very rich
and good-looking.

1595
01:31:34,559 --> 01:31:35,899
She'd have been happier with me.

1596
01:31:35,999 --> 01:31:38,699
So in the end, you lost her.

1597
01:31:38,799 --> 01:31:41,219
It's sad, because...

1598
01:31:41,319 --> 01:31:43,760
There really was
something between us.

1599
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:48,019
Some chemistry. Some magic.

1600
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:51,659
And I say chemistry
or magic because...

1601
01:31:51,759 --> 01:31:54,819
I believe I actually loved
her from the first...

1602
01:31:54,919 --> 01:31:56,859
First moment I laid eyes on her.

1603
01:31:56,959 --> 01:32:00,179
Well, love at first sight is
a kind of magic, isn't it?

1604
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:02,179
You need a drink. What will you have?

1605
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:03,765
A scotch, please.

1606
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:06,939
In the end, she proved to be a fool.

1607
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:10,059
You mean to choose that handsome
young millionaire over you?

1608
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:12,379
Well, she may come to her senses.

1609
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:15,579
Women do change their
mind about such things.

1610
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,459
Well, it's too late...
I've taken the offer off the table.

1611
01:32:18,559 --> 01:32:21,019
I'll not let myself be
pushed around by big eyes

1612
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,526
and a smile.

1613
01:32:25,599 --> 01:32:27,801
Although she's much more.

1614
01:32:29,079 --> 01:32:31,059
But she had her chance,
and she said no.

1615
01:32:31,159 --> 01:32:34,659
You mean if she changed her mind,
you wouldn't accept her?

1616
01:32:34,759 --> 01:32:35,979
It's too late.

1617
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:38,281
You can't be that stubborn.

1618
01:32:40,959 --> 01:32:45,219
Well, I suppose if she woke
up and realized how happy

1619
01:32:45,319 --> 01:32:46,659
she'd be with me,

1620
01:32:46,759 --> 01:32:49,360
how much more fun she'd have in life,

1621
01:32:50,559 --> 01:32:52,841
how much I'd come to love her.

1622
01:32:53,479 --> 01:32:55,219
She gave nothing back.

1623
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:58,443
She gave you no sign
at all that she cared?

1624
01:32:59,959 --> 01:33:03,139
If she'd given me a sign,

1625
01:33:03,239 --> 01:33:06,779
I'd have taken her in
my arms, carried her off

1626
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:09,081
and married her.

1627
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:13,409
All I was looking for was one sign.

1628
01:33:21,879 --> 01:33:23,729
Sophie?

1629
01:33:31,239 --> 01:33:33,089
Will you marry me?
