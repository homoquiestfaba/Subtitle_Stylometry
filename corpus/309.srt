1
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,960
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phoney emotions.

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,120
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,440
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit, -

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,240
- there's nothing fake
about Truman himself.

5
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,320
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,760
lt isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine. lt's a life.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,120
l'm not gonna make it. You're
gonna have to go on without me.

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,200
No way, mister.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,160
You're going to the top of
this mountain, broken legs and all.

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,520
Many viewers
leave him on all night, for comfort.

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,200
You're crazy, you know that?

12
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,720
For me there's no difference between
private life and public life.

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,120
My life is The Truman Show.
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,640
lt's a noble life.
lt is ... a truly blessed life.

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,480
Tell me something l don't know.

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,200
All right.
Promise me one thing, though.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,280
lf l die before the summit, use me
as an alternative source of food.

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,400
You're gross.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,040
lt's all real.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,320
Nothing you see on the show is fake.
lt's merely controlled.

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,000
Eat me, dammit. That's an order.

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Maybe just your love handles.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,320
l have love handles?
Yeah, little ones.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,880
- Truman, you're gonna be late.
- Okay!

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,120
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

26
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,480
And in case l don't see you,
good afternoon and good night.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,680
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer. Hey, Pluto.

28
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,080
- He won't hurt you.
- l know. lt's just me.

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,880
Come on, Pluto.

30
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,320
What is it?

31
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,920
An aircraft began shedding parts
as it flew over Seahaven -

32
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,960
- a few moments ago.
Luckily, no one was hurt.

33
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,240
How do you feel today .. ?
That's good.

34
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,560
- Thinking offlying somewhere?
- Nope.

35
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,480
This is classical Klyne.
Forget about the perils offlying -

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,880
- and let this music calm you down.

37
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,880
''Dog Fancy'', please.
Thank you very much.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Get me a paper, will you, Errol?

39
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,040
And one of these for the wife.
Loves her fashion mags.

40
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,160
- That be all for you, Truman?
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,720
- Hank!
- Good morning, Truman.

42
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,120
Good morning, Truman.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,640
- How's your lovely wife?
- Good. Yours?

44
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,600
Couldn't be better.

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,200
- Nice talking to you.
- You too. Think about that policy.

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,440
Two for one. That's a good deal.
Doppelgänger special.

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,920
Hey, fellas.
Going in? Go ahead.

48
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,560
- Go ahead.
- l'm not that anxious to get there.

49
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,600
Could l have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji lslands.

50
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Truman, did you see this?

51
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,040
l'm sorry, ma'am. lf he's in a coma
he's probably uninsurable.

52
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,880
Yes, Fiji. Do you have a listing
for Lauren Garland?

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Nothing listed ...

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,200
Do you have a Sylvia Garland?
S for Sylvia.

55
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,600
Nothing ...
Okay, thank you.

56
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,640
- Lawrence.
- l've got a prospect in Wells Park.

57
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,600
Wells Park?
On ... Harbour lsland?

58
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,000
- You know another one?
- l can't. l have an appointment.

59
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,360
Dentist, or ... yeah.

60
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,440
You'll lose more than your teeth
if you don't meet your quota.

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,000
They're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

62
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:09,160
You need this. Besides, a half hour
across the bay will do you good.

63
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,400
Thanks.

64
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,240
Hello. Ferry's still here, huh?
Thought l might have missed it.

65
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,400
- One way or return?
- Return.

66
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,680
There you go, sir.

67
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,280
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead, l'll be fine.

68
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,080
Hi, honey.

69
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,960
Look what l got free at
the checkout. lt's a ''Chef's Pal''.

70
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,880
lt's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in
one. No sharpening, dishwater-safe.

71
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,680
Wow ... that's amazing.

72
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,120
Truman ... you missed a spot.

73
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,800
That is a beer.

74
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,040
- l'm thinking about getting out.
- Yeah? Out of what?

75
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,280
Out of my job. Out of Seahaven.
Off this island. Out.

76
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,920
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You've got a great job. A desk job.

77
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,360
l'd kill for a desk job.

78
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,840
You should try stocking vending
machines. Now there's excitement.

79
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,160
- Don't you ever get antsy?
- Where's there to go?

80
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,200
- Fiji.
- Where's Fiji? Near Florida?

81
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,960
See here? This is us ...

82
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,600
And all the way
around here ... Fiji.

83
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,400
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

84
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,640
There's still islands in Fiji where
no human being has ever set foot.

85
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,560
So when are you gonna go?

86
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,760
lt's not that simple.

87
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,880
lt takes money, planning ...

88
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,680
- You can't just up and go.
- Right.

89
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,400
l'm gonna do it,
don't worry about that.

90
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,240
Bonus time
is just around the corner.

91
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,280
- Are you coming for a drink?
- No, l can't tonight.

92
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,200
l don't like that weather, son.
We should head back.

93
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,360
Just a bit farther. Please?

94
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,360
- Okay.
- Yes!

95
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
Daddy!

96
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,920
You're soaked.
Where have you been?

97
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,200
- We can scrape together 8,000 ...
- You and Marlon ...

98
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,080
- We can bum around the world.
- And then what?

99
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,800
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe l feel like a teenager.

100
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,680
We have mortgage payments. Do we
just walk away from our obligations?

101
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,720
- lt would be an adventure.
- We were going to try for a baby.

102
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,040
- lsn't that enough of an adventure?
- That can wait.

103
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,920
l want to get away.
See some of the world. Explore!

104
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,520
You want to be an explorer ...

105
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,320
This will pass.
We all think like this now and then.

106
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,960
Let's get you out
of these wet clothes. Come to bed.

107
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,640
You never see anything. They always
turn the camera and play music.

108
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,840
The wind blows, the curtain moves.
You don't see anything.

109
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,600
''Dog Fancy'', please.
Thank you.

110
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,760
Paper, Earl, please.

111
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,920
l might as well get one of these.

112
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

113
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,320
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

114
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,680
Dad?

115
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,040
Hey, what are you doing?

116
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,360
Get out of the way!

117
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,440
Stop those people!
Stop! Stop!

118
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,360
Open the door! Somebody
stop the bus! Stop the bus!

119
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,520
Somebody stop it!
Stop the bus!

120
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,960
lt doesn't sound insane at all.

121
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,640
l see him ten times a week.

122
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,600
l almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon ...

123
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,240
lt was Dad.
Dressed like a homeless man.

124
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,640
And a businessman and a lady
with a dog forced him onto a bus.

125
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,920
lt's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown.

126
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,360
They never found Dad's body.

127
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,680
lf it wasn't him, it was his twin!
Did Dad have a brother?

128
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,800
You know perfectly well
that your father was an only child.

129
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,320
Just like you.

130
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,560
Sweetie ... You're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

131
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,720
You sailing off into that storm ...

132
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,000
But l've never blamed you.
And l don't blame you now.

133
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,880
Truman ..?

134
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,720
What are you doing down here?

135
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,040
Fixing the mower.

136
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,960
- l saw my father today.
- l know.

137
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,160
Your mother called.

138
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,040
You shouldn't upset her like that.

139
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,120
- What did you want?
- l made macaroni.

140
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,360
- l'm not hungry.
- You know ...

141
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,880
We ought to throw out that mower.

142
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,480
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

143
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,680
What's he doing?

144
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,000
They got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

145
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,760
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Sorry l fell on you.

146
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,400
l've been such a klutz all day.
l must have sprained this ankle.

147
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,360
- l'm so sorry to fall on you.
- Don't worry about it.

148
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,840
- l'm Meryl.
- Hi, l'm Truman.

149
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,920
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- l've got to commit this to memory.

150
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,360
Come on, an ice-cold brewsky.

151
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,360
You're gonna have to copy off me,
so be careful.

152
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,320
You're a better person than l am.

153
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,520
- See you later.
- Bye.

154
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,480
See you later, loser.

155
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,240
Hi.

156
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,840
- Konnichi-wa.
- What?

157
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,560
- You take Japanese.
- Oh, yes ...

158
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,640
Lauren, right?

159
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,920
- lt's on the ...
- Lauren, right.

160
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:51,320
- l'm Truman Burbank.
- Yeah, l know.

161
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,320
- l'm not allowed to talk to you.
- Really?

162
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,640
- l'm a pretty dangerous character.
- l'm sorry. lt's not up to me.

163
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,320
Girls have got to be careful.

164
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,960
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- lt's not that.

165
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,080
Was it Meryl, the girl l was with?
We're not ... We're just friends.

166
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,120
- lt's nothing like that.
- lt's how l look? Not your type?

167
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,400
No.

168
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,200
l was wondering that myself.

169
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Would you maybe, possibly
sometime go out for some pizza?

170
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,400
- Like, Friday? Saturday?
- l can't.

171
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,160
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

172
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,480
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, l know.

173
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,440
lf we don't go now,
it won't happen. Do you understand?

174
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,080
So what do you want to do?

175
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,360
Please keep your hands
inside the car!

176
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,120
This is my favourite pizza place.
Tony, one large, extra plankton!

177
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
We have so little time.
They'll be here any minute.

178
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,400
- They don't want me talking to you.
- Then don't talk.

179
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,240
They're here.

180
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,200
- What do they want?
- Listen to me.

181
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,480
Everybody knows everything you do.
They're pretending. Understand?

182
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:37,120
- My name's not Lauren, it's Sylvia.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

183
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,320
- Who are you?
- Her father.

184
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,560
l've never seen him before.
Truman, don't listen to him.

185
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,320
Everything l've told you
is the truth.

186
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,520
lt's fake. lt's all for you. The sky
and the sea. Everything is a set!

187
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,600
Please, don't listen to him.
He's gonna lie to you.

188
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,440
- l want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. We've tried it all.

189
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Hypnotism, shock therapy ...
Don't worry, you're not the first.

190
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,840
- She brings all her boys down here.
- Truman, he's lying!

191
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,720
Get out of here. Come and find me.

192
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,640
- l'll see you in school.
- We're moving to Fiji.

193
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
Sylvia! Hey!

194
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,120
- Why didn't he just follow her?
- His mother got really sick.

195
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,320
He couldn't leave her.
He's kind. Maybe he's too kind.

196
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,400
l can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

197
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,720
Come on, Sal. We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

198
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,560
Close, but no cigar.

199
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,240
Another beautiful day in paradise.
But don't forget to buckle up.

200
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,560
He's heading west on Stuart.
Stand by, all extras.

201
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,240
He's turning onto Lancaster Square.

202
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,880
My God, he nearly hit her! Something
is wrong. Change frequencies.

203
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,480
Sorry about that, folks. l guess
we picked up a police frequency.

204
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:18,280
lt's classical Klyne, and we've
still got some great music ahead.

205
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,520
But buckle up. Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

206
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,160
- Can l help?
- l have an appointment.

207
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,920
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

208
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,800
- Just tell me what's happening.
- We're remodelling.

209
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,640
- lt's none of your business.
- Tell me, or l'll report you!

210
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,520
You're trespassing.

211
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,600
- Marlon!
- Truman, what are you doing here?

212
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,880
l've got to talk to you.
l'm on to something big!

213
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,760
- You look like shit.
- l think l'm mixed up in something.

214
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,400
A lot of strange things
have been happening.

215
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,960
The people on the elevator,
there was no backing on it ...

216
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,800
And the radio starts following me,
talking about everything l'm doing.

217
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,520
- This is one of your fantasies.
- l think this is about my dad.

218
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,280
l think he's alive. l'll tell you
about it later. l'm being followed.

219
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Who?

220
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,160
lt's hard to tell.
They look like regular people.

221
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,200
- How about those two?
- Could be.

222
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,720
lt's when l'm unpredictable.
That's when they can't ...

223
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,640
Anything happen ..?
We have to get out of here.

224
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,720
- You ready to go?
- l can't.

225
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,360
- You're gonna get us both fired.
- Okay then, let's do it.

226
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,120
Whatever you say, l'm game.
Your birthday comes but once a year!

227
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,280
Maybe l'm being set up
for something.

228
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,920
You ever think that your whole life
has been building toward something?

229
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,520
No.

230
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,400
When you were hauling chickens,
how far did you get off the island?

231
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,960
l went all over. Never found
a place like this, though.

232
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,840
Look at that sunset. lt's perfect.

233
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,040
That's the big guy.
Quite a paintbrush he's got.

234
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,520
Just between you and me, Marlon ...

235
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,600
- l'm going away for a while.
- Really?

236
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,600
Little Angel.

237
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,800
My little clown ...
Old carrot-top.

238
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,040
The best photos ...

239
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,680
- We should be getting you home.
- Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

240
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,080
Do you remember, Truman?
You slept the whole way there.

241
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,800
- lt looks so small.
- Things do, when you look back.

242
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,320
Look, Truman.
The happiest day of our lives.

243
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,200
- Look! Jean, Jodie, Joanne ...
- Doesn't she look beautiful?

244
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,160
Well, she still does.

245
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:21,680
There's room for baby photos. l want
to hold a grandchild before l go.

246
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,880
We really should get you home.
No, you stay. Relax.

247
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:31,520
- Your favourite show is coming on.
- And we have something to discuss.

248
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,160
- A certain person's birthday.
- Oh, l see.

249
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:42,720
There'll be another ''Lucy'' tomorrow.
Now it's time for Golden Oldies.

250
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,560
Tonight we present the classic:
''Show Me the Way to Go Home''.

251
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,160
You don't have to leave home to
discover what the world is about.

252
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,240
We learn that no one is poor
who has friends.

253
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,360
Full oflaughter, love, pain,
sadness, but ultimately, redemption.

254
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,360
The cherry scene will have you
splitting your sides with laughter.

255
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,160
There'll be tears, too, when
David and Jennifer are reunited.

256
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Let'sjoin the Abbotts
in Camden Village.

257
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,800
Thank you, Sweetie.

258
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:55,480
l need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

259
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,640
- l'd love to, but l'm really late.
- What's your rush?

260
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,240
There was that elevator disaster.
lt was on the news.

261
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,840
The cable just snapped.
The elevator plummeted ten flights.

262
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,400
Right next door to where you work.
What if you had been in there?

263
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:21,640
Anyway, l have an amputation on
one of the women from the elevator.

264
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,000
She's very young. lt's sad.
Wish me luck.

265
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,160
l'll cross my fingers for you.

266
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,400
Excuse me. May l help you?

267
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,840
l'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. lt's very important.

268
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,320
That's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

269
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,240
Sure ... Okay, fine.
Can you pass along a message?

270
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,960
l had to go to Fiji.
l'll call when l get there.

271
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,400
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

272
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,800
- Fine. l'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

273
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,800
Sorry.

274
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,520
Let me help you with that.

275
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,040
He's here.

276
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,960
Scalpel.

277
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,400
l'm now making
my primary incision, -

278
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,040
- just above the right knee.

279
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,880
- Nicely done.
- Unless you're family ...

280
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:47,560
- lt's just a beautiful job.
- l'll let someone else tidy up.

281
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,760
- l'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

282
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,920
- How can l help?
- l'd like a flight to Fiji.

283
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,080
- When would you like to leave?
- Today.

284
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,840
l'm sorry. l don't have anything
for at least a month.

285
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,720
lt's the busy season.

286
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,880
Do you want to book the flight?

287
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,200
l'll make other arrangements.

288
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,240
Last call for Chicago!
All aboard!

289
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,720
Thank you.

290
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:19,440
Windy City, here we come.

291
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,040
Hi!

292
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,560
Hello ...

293
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,840
- Mom, isn't that you know you?
- Face the front.

294
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,960
Everybody off, we've got a problem.

295
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,080
l'm sorry, son.

296
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,760
- Wasn't his father from Chicago?
- His father was from Des Moines.

297
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,080
- Why does he want to go to Chicago?
- He's not going anywhere.

298
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,200
Truman?

299
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,440
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

300
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,440
- Truman ...
- Look.

301
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,560
l predict that, in just a moment,
we'll see a lady on a red bike -

302
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,080
- followed by a man with flowers and
a Volkswagen with a dented fender.

303
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,320
- Truman, please ...
- Look!

304
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,440
Lady ...

305
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,800
Flowers ...

306
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,200
- And ..?
- And ...

307
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,640
- Truman, this is silly.
- There's the dented Beetle! Yes!

308
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,600
You know how l did that?
They're on a loop.

309
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,200
They go around the block, they
come back, they go around again.

310
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,720
- l invited Marlon to barbecue ...
- l won't be here.

311
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,400
We need more charcoal.

312
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:28,040
Are you listening
to a word l'm saying?

313
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,840
You're upset
because you want to go to Fiji?

314
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,560
Okay, go.

315
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,840
l think you should save
for a few months, and then go.

316
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,800
l'm going to take a shower.

317
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,480
Let's go now.
l'm ready. Why wait?

318
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,320
Early bird gathers no moss,
rolling stone catches the worm.

319
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:00,160
Truman, what are you doing?

320
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,520
- Truman ...
- Where shall we go?

321
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,280
- Truman, where are we going?
- l guess l'm being spontaneous.

322
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,800
Somebody help me!
l'm being spontaneous!

323
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,760
Forget Fiji.
We can't drive to Fiji, can we?

324
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,360
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

325
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,560
That's right, l do.
But l never have.

326
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,680
And that's why people go places.

327
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,760
- l think l'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

328
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,680
Blocked at every turn. Beautifully
synchronised, don't you think?

329
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:58,000
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should l?

330
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,200
Truman, let's go home.

331
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,880
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

332
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:15,680
lt'll be like this all the way
to Atlantic City. Let's go back.

333
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,840
l'm sorry.
l don't know what got into me.

334
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,160
- Can you please slow down?
- Yes, l can.

335
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,280
- That's our turn-off.
- l changed my mind.

336
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,560
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardis Gras!

337
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,440
Look, Meryl. Same road, no cars.
lt's magic.

338
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,520
Let me out. lf you want to
destroy yourself, do it on your own.

339
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,480
l think l'd like a little company.

340
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,760
Oh, Truman ...
You knew this would happen.

341
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,080
You know you can't drive over water.

342
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,160
Let's go home,
where you'll feel safe.

343
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,520
Give me your hand ...
You drive!
