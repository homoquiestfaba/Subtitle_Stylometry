1
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,105
They ought to make the day the time changes
the first day of summer.

2
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,900
- What?
- Well, it's eight o'clock and it's still light.

3
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:29,111
A lot of good the extra daylight does us.

4
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:32,990
Now, we've still got a three-hour drive back.
We're not gonna be home until after midnight.

5
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:35,701
Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny,
you wouldn't do it.

6
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:38,829
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

7
00:02:38,913 --> 00:02:41,624
You know, I figure we're either gonna
have to move Mother out here,

8
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:43,626
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

9
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,880
- She can't make a trip like this.
- Oh, I don't know that she can't.

10
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:50,424
Is there any of that candy left?

11
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:51,759
No.

12
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,970
Look at this thing.
"We still remember."

13
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:57,515
I don't. You know, I don't even remember
what the man looks like.

14
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:59,558
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

15
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,727
Yeah, five minutes
to put the wreath on the grave

16
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:04,355
and six hours to drive back and forth.

17
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:05,773
Mother wants to remember,

18
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,985
so we trot 200 miles into the country
and she stays at home.

19
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,653
Well, we're here, John. All right?

20
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:16,117
<i>Testing. Are we back on?</i>

21
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,744
<i>Oh. Uh, ladies and gentlemen</i> ‒

22
00:03:18,828 --> 00:03:19,870
Hey, do ‒

23
00:03:19,954 --> 00:03:23,416
<i>we're coming back on the air
after an interruption due to technical probl</i> ‒

24
00:03:36,053 --> 00:03:39,223
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

25
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:41,058
Which row is it in?

26
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,539
Boy, there's no one around.

27
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:06,334
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

28
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:09,545
Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep
on the time change.

29
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:12,715
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

30
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,467
There it is.

31
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:32,818
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

32
00:04:33,736 --> 00:04:36,155
Each year we spend good money
on these things.

33
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,866
We come out here,
and the one from last year is gone.

34
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,788
Well, the flowers die, and the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

35
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:48,626
Yeah, a little spit and polish,
he can clean this up, sell it next year.

36
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,629
Wonder how many times
we've bought the same one.

37
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:12,149
Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?

38
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:33,754
Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh?

39
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,673
Come on.

40
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:37,925
I haven't seen you in church lately.

41
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:42,388
Well, there's not much sense
in my going to church.

42
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,101
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

43
00:05:47,184 --> 00:05:48,811
It was from right over there.

44
00:05:48,894 --> 00:05:50,813
I jumped out at you from behind a tree,

45
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:53,816
and Grandpa got all excited,
and he shook his fist at me and he said,

46
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:56,485
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

47
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,196
Remember that? Right over there.

48
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,283
You used to really be scared here.

49
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:04,034
Johnny.

50
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:05,786
Hey, you're still afraid.

51
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,872
Stop it now. I mean it.

52
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:14,545
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

53
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,465
Stop it! You're ignorant!

54
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:20,468
They're coming for you, Barbra.

55
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:23,053
Stop it.
You're acting like a child.

56
00:06:23,137 --> 00:06:25,097
They're coming for you.

57
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:27,725
Look! There comes one of them now!

58
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:30,895
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.

59
00:06:30,978 --> 00:06:33,022
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!

60
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,406
No!

61
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,075
No! Johnny!

62
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,244
Help me! Help!

63
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,174
It's all right.

64
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:02,846
Don't worry about him.
I can handle him.

65
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,933
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

66
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:10,604
Truck is out of gas.

67
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,648
This pump out here is locked.
Is there a key?

68
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,732
I suppose you've tried this.

69
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,369
Do you live here?

70
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,967
Jesus.

71
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,269
We've gotta get out of here.

72
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:02,730
We have to get to where
there are some other people.

73
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,569
M-Maybe we better take some food.

74
00:15:08,652 --> 00:15:10,946
I'll see if I can find some food.

75
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,369
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

76
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,579
What's happening?

77
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:15,803
Two of them.

78
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:23,686
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

79
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:26,230
- I can take care of those two.
- I don't know. I don't know.

80
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:29,358
- I know you're afraid, but we have to ‒
- I don't know! I don't know!

81
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:32,861
What's happening?

82
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,626
They know we're in here now.

83
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:09,101
Don't look at it.

84
00:20:22,257 --> 00:20:24,676
Get some more lights on in this house.

85
00:21:02,214 --> 00:21:05,133
Why don't you see if you can find some wood,
some boards, something there by the fireplace,

86
00:21:05,217 --> 00:21:07,219
something we can nail this place up.

87
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:13,725
Look, goddamn it ‒

88
00:21:16,311 --> 00:21:19,773
Look. I know you're afraid.

89
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:21,942
I'm afraid too.

90
00:21:22,025 --> 00:21:24,653
But we have to try to
board the house up together.

91
00:21:24,736 --> 00:21:27,948
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

92
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:29,575
We'll be all right here.

93
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,286
We'll be all right here
till someone comes to rescue us.

94
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:34,288
But we have to work together.
You'll have to help me.

95
00:21:34,371 --> 00:21:37,291
Now, go in and get some wood
so I can board the place up.

96
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:39,668
Do you understand? Okay?

97
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:41,920
Okay?

98
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:23,123
That'll hold 'em.
Those things aren't that strong.

99
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:26,668
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

100
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,842
There. This room looks pretty secure.

101
00:24:36,803 --> 00:24:39,806
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

102
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:47,022
Won't be long before those things'll be back,
pounding their way in here. They're afraid now.

103
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:53,487
They're afraid of fire.
I found that out.

104
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:08,877
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's Diner?

105
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,638
Anyhow, that's where I found that truck
I have out there.

106
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,725
There's a radio in the truck.

107
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:26,978
I had jumped in to listen to it...

108
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:31,191
when a big gasoline truck
came screaming right across the road.

109
00:25:31,274 --> 00:25:35,654
Well, there must have been
10, 15 of those things chasing after it,

110
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:38,615
grabbing and holding on.

111
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,912
I didn't see them at first.

112
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:48,917
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

113
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:51,711
And those things were catching up to it.

114
00:25:54,631 --> 00:25:57,342
Truck went right across the road.

115
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,097
Slammed on my brakes
to keep from hitting it myself.

116
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,182
It went right through the guardrail.

117
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:10,981
I guess ‒

118
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:14,568
I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

119
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,695
into that gas station
by Beekman's Diner.

120
00:26:18,363 --> 00:26:20,115
It went right through the billboard,

121
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:23,034
ripped over a gas pump
and never stopped moving.

122
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:25,745
By now it was like a moving bonfire.

123
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:32,168
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

124
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:38,383
I can still hear the man screaming...

125
00:26:42,971 --> 00:26:45,974
these things just backing away from it.

126
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,940
I looked back at the diner to see if there was
anyone there who could help me.

127
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,361
That was when I noticed that...

128
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,615
the entire place had been encircled.

129
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:06,202
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

130
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:12,334
By now, there were no more screams.

131
00:27:14,628 --> 00:27:16,046
I realized that...

132
00:27:17,797 --> 00:27:19,215
I was alone,

133
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:22,052
with 50 or 60 of those things

134
00:27:22,135 --> 00:27:27,140
just standing there, staring at me.

135
00:27:29,267 --> 00:27:31,561
I-I started to drive. I...

136
00:27:32,771 --> 00:27:34,898
just plowed right through them.

137
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:38,276
They didn't move.
They didn't run or...

138
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:42,280
Just stood there, staring at me.

139
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,285
I just wanted to crush them.

140
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,039
They...

141
00:27:52,832 --> 00:27:55,752
scattered through the air, like bugs.

142
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,049
We were riding in the cemetery...

143
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:03,343
Johnny and me.

144
00:28:04,469 --> 00:28:05,804
Johnny.

145
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,102
We ‒

146
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:16,231
We came to put a wreath
on my father's grave,

147
00:28:18,358 --> 00:28:20,151
Johnny and m...

148
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,320
And he said,

149
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:26,449
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"

150
00:28:29,494 --> 00:28:31,579
And we didn't have any.

151
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:36,126
And...

152
00:28:38,628 --> 00:28:41,131
Oh, it's hot in here.

153
00:28:42,173 --> 00:28:43,675
Hot.

154
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:51,182
Uh, and he said,

155
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:53,226
"Oh, it's late.

156
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:56,104
Why did we start so late?"

157
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:57,522
And I said,

158
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:02,944
"Johnny, if you'd gotten up earlier,
we wouldn't be late."

159
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:07,407
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

160
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,535
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny."

161
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:15,749
And then this man
started walking up the road.

162
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,711
He came slowly,

163
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:22,130
and Johnny kept teasing me and saying,

164
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,674
"He's coming to get you, Barbra."

165
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:28,595
And I laughed at him and said,
"Johnny, stop it."

166
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:32,348
And then Johnny ran away.

167
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:33,808
And I...

168
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:38,271
I went up to this man,
and I was going to apologize.

169
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:41,066
Why don't you just keep calm?

170
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:42,984
And I looked up, and...

171
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:44,652
and I said, "Good eve ‒"

172
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:47,697
And he grabbed me.

173
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,742
He grabbed me!

174
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:53,161
And he ripped at me!

175
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:56,122
He held me and he ripped at my clothes!

176
00:29:56,206 --> 00:29:58,750
I think you should just calm down.

177
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,503
Oh, I screamed, "Johnny!

178
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,213
Johnny, help me!

179
00:30:03,296 --> 00:30:05,423
Oh, help me!"

180
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:07,425
And he wouldn't let me go.

181
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:09,511
He ripped...

182
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:15,642
And then Johnny came, and he ran,
and he... he fought this man.

183
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:19,479
And I got so afraid, I ran.

184
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:20,855
I ran.

185
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:23,066
I ran.

186
00:30:25,443 --> 00:30:27,487
And Johnny didn't come.

187
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:32,283
We've got ‒
We have to wait for Johnny.

188
00:30:37,914 --> 00:30:40,625
Maybe we'd better go out and get him.

189
00:30:42,252 --> 00:30:44,337
We have to go out and get Johnny.

190
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,922
He's out there.

191
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:48,675
Please! Don't you hear me?

192
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:50,927
We've got to go out and get him.

193
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:53,888
Please!

194
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:56,558
We have got to go get Johnny!

195
00:30:56,641 --> 00:30:58,643
Please help me!

196
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:00,436
Please!

197
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,481
Don't you know what's going on out there?
This is no Sunday school picnic.

198
00:31:03,565 --> 00:31:06,526
Don't you understand?
My brother is alone!

199
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:08,862
- Your brother is dead.
- No!

200
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:11,030
My brother is <i>not</i> dead!

201
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:14,868
No! Oh!

202
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:07,337
<i>Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,</i>

203
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,173
<i>and because of the crisis

204
00:32:10,256 --> 00:32:13,635

<i>At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.</i>

210
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:29,025
<i>There is an epidemic of mass murder
being committed</i>

211
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:32,028
<i>by a virtual army
of unidentified assassins.</i>

212
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:36,282
<i>The murders are taking place
in villages, cities, rural homes, and suburbs</i>

213
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,327
<i>with no apparent pattern
or reason for the slayings.</i>

214
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,039
<i>It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.</i>

215
00:32:43,122 --> 00:32:45,667
<i>We have some descriptions
of the assassins.</i>

216
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,461
<i>Eyewitnesses say
they are ordinary-looking people.</i>

217
00:32:48,544 --> 00:32:51,047
<i>Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.</i>

218
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,507
<i>Others describe them as being...</i>

219
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:05,561
<i>So, at this point there is no
really authentic way for us to say</i>

220
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:08,731
<i>who or what to look for
and guard yourself against</i> ‒

221
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:11,067
<i>misshapen monsters.</i>

222
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,862
<i>Reaction of law enforcement officials
is one of complete bewilderment at this hour.</i>

223
00:33:14,946 --> 00:33:17,532
<i>So far we have been
unable to determine</i>

224
00:33:17,615 --> 00:33:20,785
<i>that any kind of
organized investigation is yet under way.</i>

225
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:23,705
<i>Police, sheriffs' deputies
and emergency ambulances</i>

226
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:26,207
<i>are literally deluged with calls for help.</i>

227
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:28,626
<i>The scene can best be described
as mayhem.</i>

228
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,379
<i>Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,</i>

229
00:33:31,462 --> 00:33:34,424
<i>along with the governors of several
Eastern and Midwestern states,</i>

230
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:37,677
<i>have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,</i>

231
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,637
<i>but that has not happened as yet.</i>

232
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:43,683
<i>The only advice our reporters
have been able to get from official sources</i>

233
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:48,021
<i>is for private citizens to stay in their homes
behind locked doors.</i>

234
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:50,231
<i>Do not venture outside for any reason</i>

235
00:33:50,315 --> 00:33:52,608
<i>until the nature of this crisis
has been determined</i>

236
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,445
<i>and until we can advise
what course of action to take.</i>

237
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:57,822
<i>Keep listening to radio and TV</i>

238
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:01,826
<i>for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.</i>

239
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:04,329
<i>Thousands of office and factory workers</i>

240
00:34:04,412 --> 00:34:06,956
<i>are being urged
to stay at their places of employment,</i>

241
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,542
<i>not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.</i>

242
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,711
<i>However, in spite of
this urging and warning,</i>

243
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:15,798
<i>streets and highways are packed with
frantic people trying to reach their families,</i>

244
00:34:15,882 --> 00:34:18,468
<i>or apparently to flee just anywhere.</i>

245
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:22,972
<i>We repeat: The safest course of action
at this time is simply to stay where you</i> ‒

246
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,369
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word</i>

247
00:34:44,452 --> 00:34:47,080
<i>that the president
has called a meeting of his cabinet</i>

248
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:49,123
<i>to deal with
the sudden epidemic of murder</i>

249
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,626
<i>which has seized
the eastern third of this nation.</i>

250
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:54,045
<i>The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.</i>

251
00:34:54,128 --> 00:34:56,047
<i>Members of the presidential cabinet</i>

252
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:00,968
<i>will be joined by officials of the FBI
and the joint chiefs behind closed doors.</i>

253
00:35:01,052 --> 00:35:03,554
<i>A White House spokesman,
in announcing this conference,</i>

254
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:05,181
<i>says there will be
an official announcement</i>

255
00:35:05,264 --> 00:35:07,350
<i>as soon as possible
following that meeting.</i>

256
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:10,269
<i>This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.</i>

257
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:15,483
<i>Latest word also from national press services
in Washington, DC, now tells us</i>

258
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:18,277
<i>that the emergency presidential conference
which we've just mentioned</i>

259
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:20,279
<i>will include high-ranking scientists</i>

260
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:23,324
<i>from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.</i>

261
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,368
<i>That's the extent of this latest</i> ‒

262
00:35:34,627 --> 00:35:37,880
<i>All radio and TV stations
across the eastern part of the country,</i>

263
00:35:37,964 --> 00:35:39,966
<i>including the one
to which you are listening,</i>

264
00:35:40,049 --> 00:35:42,385
<i>have joined their facilities
in an emergency network</i>

265
00:35:42,468 --> 00:35:44,595
<i>to bring you this news as it develops.</i>

266
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:50,977
<i>We urge you to stay tuned to radio and TV
and to stay indoors at all costs.</i>

267
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,938
<i>Late reports reaching this newsroom
tell of frightened people</i>

268
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:56,983
<i>seeking refuge in churches, schools,
and government buildings,</i>

269
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:59,861
<i>demanding shelter and protection
from the wholesale murder</i>

270
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:01,904
<i>which apparently is engulfing
much of the nation.</i>

271
00:36:01,988 --> 00:36:06,409
<i>Law enforcement officials are at a loss
to explain or, even at this hour,</i>

272
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:09,787
<i>even to theorize about the reasons
for this wave of murder.</i>

273
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:13,499
<i>So far, all they're able to give the public
is something similar to the response</i>

274
00:36:13,583 --> 00:36:16,711
<i>of Chief T.K. Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina,</i>

275
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:18,713
<i>who is quoted as saying, quote,</i>

276
00:36:18,796 --> 00:36:21,591
<i>"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets.</i>

277
00:36:21,674 --> 00:36:24,927
<i>Tell 'em to go home
and lock their doors and windows up tight.</i>

278
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:28,598
<i>We don't know what kind of
murder-happy characters we have here."</i>

279
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:32,310
<i>End quote. That's Chief Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina.</i>

280
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:37,482
<i>So far the only descriptions,
the only clues anyone has of the killers</i>

281
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,734
<i>come from frightened witnesses.</i>

282
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:44,489
<i>These eyewitness accounts variously describe
the murderers as "ordinary looking people,"</i>

283
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:48,159
<i>"misshapen monsters,"
"people who look like they're in a trance,"</i>

284
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:52,121
<i>and "things that look like people
but act like animals."</i>

285
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:54,248
<i>Some eyewitnesses tell of seeing victims</i>

286
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:57,502
<i>who look as though
they had been torn apart.</i>

287
00:36:57,585 --> 00:37:00,880
<i>This whole ghastly story
began developing two days ago</i>

288
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:03,132
<i>with the report of the slaying
of a family of seven</i>

289
00:37:03,216 --> 00:37:05,551
<i>in their rural home
near Gulfport, Louisiana.</i>

290
00:37:05,635 --> 00:37:09,055
<i>Since then, reports of some
senseless killings began snowballing</i>

291
00:37:09,138 --> 00:37:13,059
<i>in a reign of terror which has hopscotched
in an erratic and disconnected pattern</i>

292
00:37:13,142 --> 00:37:16,145
<i>throughout much of the eastern
and midwestern United States.</i>

293
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:20,274
<i>Efforts to keep track of the murder reports
by the placing of markers on a map</i>

294
00:37:20,358 --> 00:37:24,362
<i>seem to indicate a general spreading
from the extreme southeastern United States</i>

295
00:37:24,445 --> 00:37:25,947
<i>to the north and west.</i>

296
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,450
<i>Our newsmen have been on the telephone,
talking with officials in other cities,</i>

297
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:32,912
<i>and have determined
that none of this kind of mass murder</i>

298
00:37:32,995 --> 00:37:35,456
<i>has yet been reported
west of the Mississippi River,</i>

299
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,919
<i>except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.</i>

300
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:43,214
<i>Similar killings have been reported
around the Houston and Galveston areas,</i>

301
00:37:43,297 --> 00:37:46,300
<i>- but nothing like the...</i>
- I found a gun and some bullets out there.

302
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,178
<i>- It was only late yesterday</i> ‒
- Oh, and these.

303
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:53,224
<i>that it soon became clear that we were
facing some kind of national emergency.</i>

304
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:55,601
<i>When first reports began filtering in,</i>

305
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,853
<i>newsmen and law enforcement agencies
were of the opinion</i> ‒

306
00:37:57,937 --> 00:38:00,356
This place is boarded up pretty solid now.

307
00:38:01,524 --> 00:38:04,360
We ought to be all right here for a while.

308
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:08,281
We have the gun and the bullets,
food and the radio.

309
00:38:08,364 --> 00:38:11,284
<i>...began to suspect
an obscure kind of conspiracy.</i>

310
00:38:11,367 --> 00:38:14,287
Sooner or later,
someone's bound to come and get us out.

311
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,038
<i>...creatures from outer space.</i>

312
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:21,252
<i>So again, we join with law enforcement agencies
in urging you to seek shelter in a building.</i>

313
00:38:21,335 --> 00:38:23,254
<i>Lock the doors and windows securely.</i>

314
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:25,256

<i>Be cautious of any suspicious strangers,</i>

316

<i>and keep tuned to your radio and television

Look, I don't know if you're hearing me ‒

319
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,226

320
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,562

some critical balance</i> ‒

321

If anything should try to break in here,
I can hear it from up there.

322
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:44,525
I'll be down to take care of it.

325
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,075

326
00:38:55,578 --> 00:38:57,288
Okay?

<i>Repeating this latest bulletin just received
moments ago from Cumberland, Maryland,</i>

337
00:40:10,903 --> 00:40:14,573
<i>civil defense authorities have told newsmen
that murder victims show evidence</i>

338
00:40:14,657 --> 00:40:18,244
<i>of having been partially devoured
by their murderers.</i>

339
00:40:18,327 --> 00:40:21,163
<i>Medical examination of victims' bodies
shows conclusively</i>

340
00:40:21,247 --> 00:40:24,625
<i>that the killers are eating the flesh
of the people they kill.</i>

341
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:29,797
<i>And so this incredible story
becomes more ghastly with each report.</i>

342
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,841
<i>It's difficult to imagine</i> ‒

343
00:40:31,924 --> 00:40:33,259
<i>such a thing actually happening,</i>

344
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:36,178
<i>but these are the reports we have been
receiving and passing on to you,</i>

345
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:40,766
<i>reports which have been verified as completely
as is possible in this confused situation.</i>

346
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,853
<i>It</i> is <i>happening, and it would appear
that no one is safe</i>

347
00:40:43,936 --> 00:40:45,396
<i>from this wave of mass</i> ‒

348
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,940
Hey! Come here!

349
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:50,234
Calm ‒ Calm down! Calm down!

350
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:55,156
Hold it!

351
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,032
Don't shoot. We're from town.

352
00:40:57,116 --> 00:40:59,034
- A radio!
<i>- ...Butler County, Pennsylvania.</i>

353
00:40:59,118 --> 00:41:02,997
<i>The Butler County sheriff has verified
that reports of murder victims</i>

354
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,208
<i>being partially eaten
by their slayers is true.</i>

355
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:08,711
<i>No further details available at this time.
However</i> ‒

356
00:41:08,794 --> 00:41:11,589
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

357
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,215
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

358
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:15,968
You mean you didn't hear the racket
we were making up here?

359
00:41:16,051 --> 00:41:18,179
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

360
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:21,432
- Could've been those things, for all we knew.
- That girl was screaming.

361
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:23,601
Surely you must know
what a girl screaming sounds like.

362
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:24,935
Those things don't make any noise.

363
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:27,229
Anybody would know
somebody's in need of help.

364
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:29,940
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

365
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:31,942
We thought we could hear screams,

366
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:34,945
but for all we knew that could have meant
those things were in the house after her.

367
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:38,157
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more ‒

368
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,284
The racket sounded like
the place was being ripped apart.

369
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:42,328
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

370
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:46,165
Now, wait a minute. You just got finished
saying you couldn't hear from down there.

371
00:41:46,248 --> 00:41:48,584
Now you say it sounded like
this place was being ripped apart.

372
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,795
It would be nice
if you'd get your story straight, man.

373
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:53,547
All right, now you tell <i>me.</i>

374
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:57,551
I'm not gonna take that kind of a chance
when we've got a safe place.

375
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:00,888
We luck into a safe place, and you're
telling us we've gotta risk our lives

376
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:03,390
just because somebody
might need help, huh?

377
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:04,725
Yeah. Something like that.

378
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:07,436
- All right, why don't we settle this ‒
- Look, mister!

379
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,730
We came up, okay? We're here.

380
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:13,484
Now, I suggest we all go back downstairs
before any of those things find out we're in here.

381
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,569
They can't get in here.

382
00:42:15,653 --> 00:42:18,280
- You got the whole place boarded up?
- Yeah, most of it.

383
00:42:18,364 --> 00:42:21,158
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

384
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:24,036
You're insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

385
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:26,163
I'm telling you, they can't get in here.

386
00:42:26,247 --> 00:42:29,291
And I'm telling you,
those things turned over our car.

387
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,085
We were damned lucky
to get away at all.

388
00:42:31,168 --> 00:42:35,506
Now you tell me those things
can't get through this lousy pile of wood?

389
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:37,883
His wife and kid's downstairs.

390
00:42:37,967 --> 00:42:39,468
The kid's hurt.

391
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:43,305
Well, I still think we're better off up here.

392
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:46,559
We could strengthen everything up,
Mr. Cooper.

393
00:42:46,642 --> 00:42:48,811
With all of us working,
we could fix this place up in no time.

394
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,813
We have everything we need up here.

395
00:42:50,896 --> 00:42:53,524
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

396
00:42:53,607 --> 00:42:55,317
Man, you're really crazy.
You know that?

397
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:57,695
You got a million windows up here.
All these windows.

398
00:42:57,778 --> 00:43:00,573
You're gonna make them strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

399
00:43:00,656 --> 00:43:02,616
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

400
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,202
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

401
00:43:05,286 --> 00:43:08,706
Did you hear me when I told you
they turned over our car?

402
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,876
- Oh, hell, any good five men can do that.
- That's my point.

403
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:14,169
Only there's not going to be five,
or even 10.

404
00:43:14,253 --> 00:43:16,672
There's gonna be 20, 30,
maybe a hundred of those things.

405
00:43:16,755 --> 00:43:19,466
And as soon as they know we're here,
this place is gonna be crawling with them.

406
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,970
Well, if there are that many,
they'll probably get us wherever we are.

407
00:43:23,053 --> 00:43:26,056
Look, the cellar.

408
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,644
The cellar, there's only one door, right?
Just one door. That's all we have to protect.

409
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:33,939
Tom and I fixed it
so it locks and boards from the inside.

410
00:43:34,023 --> 00:43:37,818
But up here, all these windows, why, we'd never
know where they were gonna hit us next.

411
00:43:37,902 --> 00:43:39,862
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

412
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:42,323
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

413
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:46,035
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

414
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:47,494
Ah!

415
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:49,496
We can get out of here
if we have to.

416
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,458
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

417
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:56,337
But down there, with no windows, if a rescue
party did come, we wouldn't even know it.

418
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,631
But the cellar is the strongest place.

419
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:00,341
The cellar is a death trap.

420
00:44:00,424 --> 00:44:02,843
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.

421
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:04,762
I think he's right.

422
00:44:04,845 --> 00:44:06,639
You know how many's out there?

423
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:08,641
I don't know.
I figure maybe six or seven.

424
00:44:08,724 --> 00:44:12,186
Look.
You two can do whatever you like.

425
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:14,313
I'm going back down to the cellar

426
00:44:14,396 --> 00:44:17,566
and you better decide,
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

427
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,319
and I'm not gonna unlock it again,
no matter what happens.

428
00:44:20,402 --> 00:44:22,655
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!

429
00:44:22,738 --> 00:44:24,865
I've made my decision.
Now you make yours.

430
00:44:24,949 --> 00:44:27,534
Now, wait a minute!
Let's think about this.

431
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:30,412
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

432
00:44:30,496 --> 00:44:33,624
And if we do decide to stay down there,
we'll need some things from up here.

433
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,669
So let's at least consider this a while.

434
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:38,545
<i>...at all costs.</i>

435
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:40,547
<i>Late reports reaching this newsroom</i> ‒

436
00:44:40,631 --> 00:44:43,968
If you box yourself in the cellar and
those things get in the house, you've had it.

437
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:46,095
At least up here
you have a fighting chance.

438
00:44:50,432 --> 00:44:53,102
Yeah, it looks like
about eight or 10 out there now.

439
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:55,187
That's more than there were.

440
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:57,356
There are a lot out back too.

441
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,441
<i>So far, the best advice they're...</i>

442
00:45:38,772 --> 00:45:40,691
- Harry?
- It's all right.

443
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:43,027
- Harry, what's happening?
- It's ‒ It's all right!

444
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,752
Damn thing.

445
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,418
We gotta fix these boards.

446
00:46:41,502 --> 00:46:43,128
You're crazy!

447
00:46:43,212 --> 00:46:45,547
Those things are gonna be
at every window and door in this place!

448
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:47,341
We've got to get down into the cellar.

449
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:50,219
Go down in your damn cellar!
Get out of here!

450
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:54,598
- I'm ‒ I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

451
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:57,726
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

452
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:00,395
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

453
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:03,148
and the radio and the food
is part of what I'm fighting for.

454
00:47:03,232 --> 00:47:06,068
- Now, if you're going down in the cellar, get.
- The man's insane.

455
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:08,237
He's insane.

456
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,531
We've got to have food down there.
We've got a right.

457
00:47:10,614 --> 00:47:12,825
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

458
00:47:12,908 --> 00:47:15,369
- You going down there with him?
- W-Well, I ‒

459
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:18,372
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

460
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:21,708
Listen, I got a kid down there.

461
00:47:21,792 --> 00:47:23,710
She can't possib ‒
I couldn't bring her up here.

462
00:47:23,794 --> 00:47:27,506
She can't possibly take all the racket from
those things smashing through the windows.

463
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:29,383
Well, you're her father.

464
00:47:29,466 --> 00:47:32,094
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

465
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:35,264
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

466
00:47:35,347 --> 00:47:38,600
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

467
00:47:38,684 --> 00:47:41,186
Now, get the hell down in the cellar.

468
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,106
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

469
00:47:45,858 --> 00:47:47,401
You bastards!

470
00:47:49,903 --> 00:47:52,531
You know, I won't open this door again.
I mean it.

471
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:55,450
- Mr. Cooper, with your help, we can ‒
- With my help!

472
00:47:55,534 --> 00:47:58,912
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up. Just let him go.

473
00:48:01,373 --> 00:48:02,791
Wait a minute.

474
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:06,128
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

475
00:48:13,677 --> 00:48:17,014
- You're gonna let them get her too, huh?
- It's all right, honey. Go ahead.

476
00:48:27,983 --> 00:48:31,320
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

477
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:34,656
But there ‒ there's lots of places
we can run to up here.

478
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,366
Mr. Cooper?

479
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,662
We'd all be a lot better off
if all three of us were working together.

480
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,540
Hey.

481
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:45,125
Hey, kid.

482
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:55,427
He's wrong, you know.

483
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,846
I'm not boxing myself in down there.

484
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,516
<i>To repeat, this radio station
will remain on the air day and night.</i>

485
00:49:04,478 --> 00:49:08,482
Well, we're safe now.
It's boarded up tight.

486
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:10,400
What about Tom and Judy?

487
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:12,569
They wanna stay up there, let 'em.

488
00:49:16,448 --> 00:49:19,910
There are... two other people upstairs.

489
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:23,455
- A man and a girl.
- We heard the screaming.

490
00:49:23,538 --> 00:49:25,207
Yeah, but I didn't know who they were,

491
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,335
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

492
00:49:28,418 --> 00:49:30,420
Of course not, Harry.

493
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:46,186
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

494
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,897
She feels warm. Maybe it's shock.

495
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,900
Where'd you get the bandage?

496
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:55,279
Some laundry in a basket.
I tore a sheet.

497
00:50:02,661 --> 00:50:04,830
Let them stay upstairs.

498
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:08,125
Let them.

499
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:11,086
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

500
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:14,423
We'll see who's right.

501
00:50:14,506 --> 00:50:17,718
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

502
00:50:18,343 --> 00:50:20,512
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

503
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:24,099
- To be right. Everybody else to be wrong.
- What do you mean by that?

504
00:50:27,728 --> 00:50:30,230
Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

505
00:50:32,024 --> 00:50:34,401
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

506
00:50:34,484 --> 00:50:37,738
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

507
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:39,823
- The radio said to stay inside ‒
- Radio?

508
00:50:40,782 --> 00:50:42,659
Radio, upstairs. I heard a news bulletin.

509
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:45,454
There's a radio upstairs,
and you boarded us in down here?

510
00:50:45,537 --> 00:50:47,372
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

511
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:49,791
Nothing! Nothing!
They don't know anything yet.

512
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:52,669
The ‒ There's mass murder everywhere,

513
00:50:52,753 --> 00:50:55,464
and people are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

514
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:58,008
Take the boards off that door.

515
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:00,135
We are staying down here, Helen.

516
00:51:00,218 --> 00:51:03,388
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

517
00:51:03,472 --> 00:51:06,767
If the authorities know what's happening,
well, they'll send people for us,

518
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,643
or they'll tell us what to do.

519
00:51:08,727 --> 00:51:12,647
How are we going to know what's going on
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

520
00:51:22,449 --> 00:51:24,743
We may not enjoy living together...

521
00:51:26,328 --> 00:51:29,414
but dying together
isn't going to solve anything.

522
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:31,333
Those people aren't our enemies.

523
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,668
Mr. Cooper!

524
00:51:35,003 --> 00:51:38,131
Mr. Cooper?
Ben found a television set upstairs.

525
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:43,303
Let's go up. Tom?

526
00:51:43,387 --> 00:51:44,721
Yes.

527
00:51:44,805 --> 00:51:48,183
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

528
00:51:48,266 --> 00:51:50,977
Harry and I could come upstairs.

529
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:53,647
Okay. Yeah. Right away.

530
00:51:55,816 --> 00:51:58,735
- Will you do it?
- Do I have to?

531
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:02,656
Look, honey, nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

532
00:52:03,407 --> 00:52:05,826
Do this, for me.

533
00:52:05,909 --> 00:52:07,411
Okay.

534
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:09,788
Okay, open up.

535
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,728
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

536
00:52:36,606 --> 00:52:38,442
She's all I have.

537
00:52:40,068 --> 00:52:42,404
Why don't you go upstairs now?

538
00:53:09,764 --> 00:53:11,850
Her brother was killed.

539
00:53:11,933 --> 00:53:14,394
Hey, give me a hand with this thing.

540
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:18,064
I gotta go help Ben with the television.

541
00:54:00,524 --> 00:54:03,068
Don't be afraid of me.

542
00:54:03,151 --> 00:54:05,820
I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.

543
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:16,331
This place is ridiculous.

544
00:54:16,414 --> 00:54:19,501
Look at this.
There's a million weak spots up here.

545
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,672
Give me one of those.

546
00:54:27,676 --> 00:54:29,761
Her brother was killed.

547
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:39,771
And they talk about these windows.

548
00:54:39,854 --> 00:54:41,815
I can't see a damned thing.

549
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:44,401
There could be 15 million
of those things out there.

550
00:54:44,484 --> 00:54:46,570
That's how much good these windows are.

551
00:54:50,657 --> 00:54:53,535
Why don't you do something
to help somebody?

552
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:01,293
Here, I have it.
Drag a couple of those chairs together.

553
00:55:01,376 --> 00:55:03,461
There's a socket over here.

554
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,844
Now, you'd better watch this
and try to understand what's going on.

555
00:55:12,887 --> 00:55:14,723
I don't want anyone's life on my hands.

556
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:16,308
Is there anything I can do to help?

557
00:55:16,391 --> 00:55:18,268
I don't want to hear
any more from you, mister.

558
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:20,520
If you stay up here,
you take orders from me!

559
00:55:20,604 --> 00:55:22,355
And that includes leaving the girl alone.

560
00:55:22,439 --> 00:55:24,983
- It's on! It's on!
- There's no sound.

561
00:55:26,067 --> 00:55:27,944
Play with the rabbit ears.

562
00:55:28,028 --> 00:55:30,989
<i>Reports, incredible as they seem,</i>

563
00:55:31,072 --> 00:55:33,575
<i>are not the results of mass hysteria.</i>

564
00:55:33,658 --> 00:55:34,784
Mass hysteria.

565
00:55:34,868 --> 00:55:36,745
What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

566
00:55:36,828 --> 00:55:37,871
Shut up.

567
00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:39,706
<i>In all parts of the country.</i>

568
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:42,709
<i>The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation</i>

569
00:55:42,792 --> 00:55:47,672
<i>is being committed by creatures
who feast upon the flesh of their victims.</i>

570
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:51,009
<i>First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development</i>

571
00:55:51,092 --> 00:55:55,722
<i>came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.</i>

572
00:55:55,805 --> 00:56:00,310
<i>Officials and newsmen at first discounted
those eyewitness descriptions</i>

573
00:56:00,393 --> 00:56:02,228
<i>as being beyond belief.</i>

574
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:04,522
<i>However, the reports persisted.</i>

575
00:56:04,606 --> 00:56:07,233
<i>Medical examinations
of some of the victims</i>

576
00:56:07,317 --> 00:56:10,528
<i>bore out the fact
that they had been partially devoured.</i>

577
00:56:12,781 --> 00:56:15,742
<i>I think we have some late word
just arriving,</i>

578
00:56:15,825 --> 00:56:17,869
<i>and we interrupt to bring this to you.</i>

579
00:56:19,204 --> 00:56:21,206
<i>This is the latest disclosure in a report</i>

580
00:56:21,289 --> 00:56:24,000
<i>from National Civil Defense headquarters
in Washington.</i>

581
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:28,546
<i>It has been established
that persons who have recently died</i>

582
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,258
<i>have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.</i>

583
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:36,304
<i>A widespread investigation
of reports from funeral homes,</i>

584
00:56:36,388 --> 00:56:38,056
<i>morgues, and hospitals</i>

585
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:42,102
<i>has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life</i>

586
00:56:42,185 --> 00:56:44,562
<i>and seeking human victims.</i>

587
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:47,982
<i>It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,</i>

588
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:50,068
<i>but it does seem to be a fact.</i>

589
00:56:51,194 --> 00:56:52,946
<i>When this emergency first began,</i>

590
00:56:53,029 --> 00:56:56,366
<i>radio and television
was advising people to stay inside,</i>

591
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:58,618
<i>behind locked doors, for safety.</i>

592
00:56:58,702 --> 00:57:00,995
<i>Well, that situation has now changed.</i>

593
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,416
<i>We're able to report
a definite course of action for you.</i>

594
00:57:04,499 --> 00:57:06,960
<i>Civil defense machinery has been organized</i>

595
00:57:07,043 --> 00:57:10,964
<i>to provide rescue stations
with food, shelter, medical treatment,</i>

596
00:57:11,047 --> 00:57:13,633
<i>and protection
by armed national guardsmen.</i>

597
00:57:13,717 --> 00:57:17,178
<i>Stay tuned to the broadcasting stations
in your local area</i>

598
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:19,264
<i>for this list of rescue stations.</i>

599
00:57:19,347 --> 00:57:22,350
<i>This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.</i>

600
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:25,562
<i>Look for the name
of the rescue station nearest you</i>

601
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:29,107
<i>and make your way to that location
as soon as possible.</i>

602
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:31,943
So we have that truck.
If we can get some gas, we can get outta here.

603
00:57:32,026 --> 00:57:34,821
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

604
00:57:34,904 --> 00:57:36,448
But it's locked.

605
00:57:36,531 --> 00:57:38,742
<i>...emergency meeting called
this afternoon by the president.</i>

606
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:41,786
<i>Since convening,
this conference of the presidential cabinet,</i>

607
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:45,373
<i>the FBI, the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA</i>

608
00:57:45,457 --> 00:57:47,834
<i>has not produced any public information.</i>

609
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:52,630
<i>Why are space experts being consulted
about an earthbound emergency?</i>

610
00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:56,468
<i>So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question</i>

611
00:57:56,551 --> 00:57:59,429
<i>centers on the recent explorer satellite
shot to Venus.</i>

612
00:58:00,722 --> 00:58:05,518
<i>That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth, but never got here.</i>

613
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:07,562
<i>That's the space vehicle which orbited Venus</i>

614
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:10,440
<i>and then was purposely destroyed by NASA</i>

615
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:12,442
<i>when scientists discovered it was carrying</i>

616
00:58:12,525 --> 00:58:15,361
<i>a mysterious, high-level radiation with it.</i>

617
00:58:15,445 --> 00:58:18,114
<i>Could that radiation
be somehow responsible</i>

618
00:58:18,198 --> 00:58:21,034
<i>for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?</i>

619
00:58:21,117 --> 00:58:24,454
<i>Newsman Don Quinn in Washington
has posed those questions.</i>

620
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:27,207
It's obvious.
Our best move is to try to get out of here.

621
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:29,834
- How are you gonna get over to that pump?
- Look!

622
00:58:31,085 --> 00:58:33,588
<i>You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe.</i>

623
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:35,173
<i>Is that right?</i>

624
00:58:35,256 --> 00:58:37,133
<i>Yes, yes,
that was the subject of the meeting.</i>

625
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:39,928
<i>Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon</i> ‒

626
00:58:40,011 --> 00:58:42,597
<i>There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.</i>

627
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,974
<i>In other words, you feel that
the radiation on the Venus probe</i>

628
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:46,643
<i>is enough to cause these mutations?</i>

629
00:58:46,726 --> 00:58:49,395
<i>- There was a very high degree of radiation.
- Well, just a minute.</i>

630
00:58:49,479 --> 00:58:52,273
<i>I'm not sure that that's certain at all.
I don't think that has been</i> ‒

631
00:58:52,357 --> 00:58:55,151
<i>It's the only logical explanation
that we have at this time.</i>

632
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:57,362
<i>In other words,
it is the military's viewpoint that this</i> ‒

633
00:58:57,445 --> 00:58:59,572
<i>the radiation
is not the cause of the mutation.</i>

634
00:58:59,656 --> 00:59:03,034
<i>I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.</i>

635
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:05,370
<i>I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,</i>

636
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:08,373
<i>until we</i> ‒
<i>until this is irrefutably proved.</i>

637
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:10,625
<i>Everything is being done that can be done.</i>

638
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:13,002
<i>We'll have to hurry for our next meeting.</i>

639
00:59:14,295 --> 00:59:16,548
<i>Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between</i> ‒

640
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:19,467
<i>A definite connection
as far as Dr. Keller and myself</i>‒

641
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:23,096
<i>Doctor, please. I thought
we decided that is not proved yet.</i>

642
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:26,057
<i>Was it</i> ‒ <i>Was the satellite</i> ‒
<i>When the satellite was exploded</i> ‒

643
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,142
<i>It was an unusual amount of radiation,</i>

644
00:59:28,226 --> 00:59:30,937
<i>enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.</i>

645
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,356
<i>Could have happened
to have a bearing on it.</i>

646
00:59:33,439 --> 00:59:35,650
<i>It does seem to have a bearing on it.</i>

647
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:38,486
<i>- Will there be a reply for the</i> ‒
<i>- Later.</i>

648
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,988
<i>- Yes.
- There will be a reply?</i>

649
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:42,073
<i>- Yes.
- Later this afternoon?</i>

650
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:45,910
<i>There will be a report this afternoon?</i>

651
00:59:45,994 --> 00:59:48,246
<i>- Perhaps there will be a report later.
- Yes. Yes.</i>

652
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:49,831
<i>Will you close the window?</i>

653
00:59:49,914 --> 00:59:52,709
<i>We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.</i>

654
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:58,882
<i>We're hoping to get
some further explanation of this</i> ‒

655
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:01,342
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.

656
01:00:01,426 --> 01:00:04,387
He said the rescue stations
have doctors and medical supplies.

657
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,890
If we could get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

658
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:09,183
<i>...is one of the world's foremost authorities</i>

659
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:11,269
<i>on space science and technology.</i>

660
01:00:11,352 --> 01:00:13,563
Willard. I saw a sign that said Willard.

661
01:00:13,646 --> 01:00:15,940
It's only about 17 miles from here.

662
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:17,984
You know this area.
Are you from around here?

663
01:00:18,067 --> 01:00:20,028
Judy and I are both from around here.

664
01:00:20,111 --> 01:00:22,280
We were on our way up to the lake
to go swimming.

665
01:00:22,363 --> 01:00:25,408
And Judy had a radio,
and we heard the first reports about this.

666
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:27,535
So we knew the old house was here
and we came in

667
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:29,829
and found the lady upstairs, dead.

668
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:31,539
Then these other people came.

669
01:00:31,623 --> 01:00:33,917
We went down into the basement
and put a bar across the door,

670
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,501
and it is pretty strong.

671
01:00:35,585 --> 01:00:37,962
How could we possibly get away from here?

672
01:00:38,046 --> 01:00:40,548
We've got a sick child, two women,

673
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,258
one woman out of her head,

674
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:45,386
three men, and the place
is surrounded with these things.

675
01:00:46,554 --> 01:00:49,390
<i>Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,</i>

676
01:00:49,474 --> 01:00:51,225
<i>has been working very hard</i>

677
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:54,729
<i>to find some solution
to these things that are happening.</i>

678
01:00:54,812 --> 01:00:56,814
<i>Do you have any answers at this time?</i>

679
01:00:56,898 --> 01:00:58,733
<i>Yes, we have some answers.</i>

680
01:00:58,816 --> 01:01:02,487
<i>But first let me stress the importance
of seeking medical attention</i>

681
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,656
<i>for anyone who's been injured in any way.</i>

682
01:01:04,739 --> 01:01:08,993
<i>We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.</i>

683
01:01:09,077 --> 01:01:10,536
How bad has your kid been hurt?

684
01:01:12,956 --> 01:01:15,208
Um...

685
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,461
Look, you go down there and tell ‒ Judy?

686
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:22,006
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here,
and you stay with the kid, all right?

687
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:25,551
<i>Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.</i>

688
01:01:25,635 --> 01:01:28,054
<i>In the cold room at the university,</i>

689
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:29,639
<i>we had a cadaver.</i>

690
01:01:29,722 --> 01:01:34,018
<i>A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.</i>

691
01:01:34,102 --> 01:01:36,062
<i>Sometime early this morning,</i>

692
01:01:36,145 --> 01:01:39,315
<i>it opened its eyes and began to move its trunk.</i>

693
01:01:39,399 --> 01:01:42,610
<i>It was dead,
but it opened its eyes and tried to move.</i>

694
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:48,408
They want you upstairs.
Did she ask for me?

695
01:01:48,491 --> 01:01:50,952
She hasn't said anything.

696
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:53,037
I don't understand.

697
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,791
Baby? It's Mommy.

698
01:01:58,001 --> 01:01:59,293
I hurt.

699
01:02:00,586 --> 01:02:04,090
I'll come back down
as soon as I find out what they want.

700
01:02:04,173 --> 01:02:06,009
Thank you, Judy.

701
01:02:06,759 --> 01:02:08,678
<i>The bodies should be disposed of at once,</i>

702
01:02:08,761 --> 01:02:10,555
<i>preferably by cremation.</i>

703
01:02:10,638 --> 01:02:12,265
<i>Well, how long after death, then,</i>

704
01:02:12,348 --> 01:02:14,225
<i>does the body become reactivated?</i>

705
01:02:14,308 --> 01:02:15,977
<i>It's only a matter of minutes.</i>

706
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,771
<i>Minutes? Well, that doesn't give people
time to make any arrangements.</i>

707
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:22,316
<i>No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.</i>

708
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,779
<i>The bodies must be carried
to the street and</i> ‒ <i>and burned.</i>

709
01:02:26,863 --> 01:02:28,531
<i>They must be burned immediately.</i>

710
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:31,075
<i>Soak them with gasoline and burn them.</i>

711
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:34,537
<i>The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts</i>

712
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,081
<i>that a funeral service will give.</i>

713
01:02:37,165 --> 01:02:40,418
<i>They're just dead flesh, and dangerous.</i>

714
01:02:40,501 --> 01:02:45,548
Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads
or sheets to tear up into small strips, okay?

715
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:47,633
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

716
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:50,219
We need some bottles or jars
to make Molotov cocktails

717
01:02:50,303 --> 01:02:51,929
to hold them off while we try to escape.

718
01:02:52,013 --> 01:02:54,057
Hey, there's a big can of kerosene down there.

719
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,851
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

720
01:02:56,934 --> 01:02:58,728
There's a big key ring down there.

721
01:02:58,811 --> 01:03:00,897
There may be a key to the gas pump on it.

722
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,565
I'll check.

723
01:03:02,648 --> 01:03:05,443
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

724
01:03:05,526 --> 01:03:07,820
Meantime, a couple of us
can go out and try to get the gas,

725
01:03:07,904 --> 01:03:09,489
then come back for the rest of the people.

726
01:03:09,572 --> 01:03:11,365
But that'll leave a door open someplace.

727
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:14,494
Yeah, that's right. It better be this door.

728
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:16,704
It's closer to the truck.

729
01:03:16,788 --> 01:03:19,373
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

730
01:03:19,457 --> 01:03:21,542
While we're gone,
the rest of you can hole up in there.

731
01:03:21,626 --> 01:03:23,711
I found some fruit jars in the cellar.

732
01:03:23,795 --> 01:03:26,547
And there's a key on here
that's labeled for the gas pump out back.

733
01:03:28,091 --> 01:03:31,094
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

734
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,430
I can handle the truck, no sweat.

735
01:03:37,433 --> 01:03:39,977
You're it then. You and I will go.

736
01:03:44,982 --> 01:03:48,694
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

737
01:03:48,778 --> 01:03:52,240
You can go upstairs
and toss the cocktails from a window.

738
01:03:52,323 --> 01:03:54,575
Tom, you and I will have to unboard this door.

739
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:57,537
After you toss the cocktails,
you hustle back down here and lock this door.

740
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:01,582
It's no good to board it up
because we'll have to get back in quickly.

741
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:05,294
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

742
01:04:05,378 --> 01:04:07,755
then we'll worry
about getting everybody into the truck.

743
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:09,340
Now, let's move it.

744
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:12,260
<i>No place to flee for safety,</i>

745
01:04:12,343 --> 01:04:14,887
<i>except for the rescue stations
which have been set up.</i>

746
01:04:14,971 --> 01:04:18,307
<i>Indications are
that before this emergency is over,</i>

747
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:22,311
<i>we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.</i>

748
01:04:29,568 --> 01:04:31,820
You always have a smile for me.

749
01:04:31,904 --> 01:04:34,573
How can you smile like that all the time?

750
01:04:36,199 --> 01:04:38,201
How many do you have done?

751
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:43,123
Come on, honey. We gotta move.

752
01:04:43,957 --> 01:04:47,377
- Tom, are you sure about the phone?
- The phone is dead out.

753
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:49,546
All you get is a recorded message.

754
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:54,009
If I could only call the folks.
They're going to be so worried about us.

755
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:57,220
Everything'll be all right.

756
01:04:57,304 --> 01:05:00,223
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll call them.
They might even be there.

757
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:03,018
I know.

758
01:05:06,605 --> 01:05:08,106
- Tom?
- Hmm.

759
01:05:10,025 --> 01:05:12,110
Are you sure we're doing the right thing, Tom?

760
01:05:12,194 --> 01:05:14,363
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

761
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:17,157
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

762
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,992
We've got to get to a rescue station.

763
01:05:19,785 --> 01:05:21,620
- I don't know.
- Come on, honey.

764
01:05:21,703 --> 01:05:23,455
You're starting to sound
like Mr. Cooper now.

765
01:05:23,538 --> 01:05:25,415
But why do you have to go out there?

766
01:05:25,499 --> 01:05:29,378
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

767
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:31,421
Ben doesn't know
anything about that stuff.

768
01:05:33,298 --> 01:05:35,884
- But we're safe in here.
- For how long, honey?

769
01:05:35,968 --> 01:05:38,095
We're safe now.

770
01:05:38,178 --> 01:05:40,263
But there's gonna be more and more
of those things.

771
01:05:40,347 --> 01:05:42,349
I know. I know all that.

772
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:48,730
Hey. Listen.

773
01:05:48,814 --> 01:05:51,358
Remember when we had the big flood?

774
01:05:51,441 --> 01:05:55,153
Remember how difficult it was for us
to convince you that it was right to leave?

775
01:05:56,071 --> 01:05:58,699
Remember?
Remember we had to go to Willard then?

776
01:05:58,782 --> 01:06:01,159
This isn't a passing thing, honey.

777
01:06:01,243 --> 01:06:04,955
It ‒ It's not like
just a wind passing through.

778
01:06:05,038 --> 01:06:07,624
We've got to do something, and fast.

779
01:06:13,672 --> 01:06:16,341
I just don't want you to go out there,
that's all.

780
01:06:16,425 --> 01:06:18,093
Hey.

781
01:06:18,176 --> 01:06:20,345
Smile, honey.

782
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:22,431
Where's that big smile for me?

783
01:06:24,808 --> 01:06:26,685
Boy.

784
01:06:26,768 --> 01:06:29,354
You sure are no use at all, are you?

785
01:06:29,438 --> 01:06:31,982
We've got work to do, honey.

786
01:06:32,065 --> 01:06:33,692
And you ‒ you ‒

787
01:06:50,417 --> 01:06:52,210
We better get her downstairs.

788
01:06:52,294 --> 01:06:54,921
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.

789
01:06:56,673 --> 01:06:58,842
She's right.
You have to go downstairs now.

790
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:02,054
Just for a little while, until we get back.

791
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:04,056
Then we can all leave.

792
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:06,558
Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

793
01:07:25,869 --> 01:07:28,080
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

794
01:08:17,796 --> 01:08:19,339
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

795
01:08:19,422 --> 01:08:21,216
Okay, toss 'em!

796
01:09:01,423 --> 01:09:02,757
Go ahead! Go on!

797
01:09:18,982 --> 01:09:21,276
- I'm going with him.
- Get back in the cellar!

798
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,570
- No!
- It's too late. Too late!

799
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,914
Well, is she coming? Come on.

800
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:36,750
Get in!

801
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:51,241
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

802
01:10:51,324 --> 01:10:52,534
Watch it.

803
01:10:58,415 --> 01:10:59,541
Watch the torch!

804
01:11:06,589 --> 01:11:08,341
We've gotta get away from the pump!

805
01:11:19,894 --> 01:11:21,229
Hang on!

806
01:11:22,314 --> 01:11:24,983
Tom! Tom, you guys need
to get out of the truck!

807
01:11:43,585 --> 01:11:45,920
Come on. Let's get outta here.

808
01:11:46,755 --> 01:11:50,175
- Come on, come on!
- My jacket's caught.

809
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:59,369
Let me in! Let me in!

810
01:13:00,578 --> 01:13:01,663
Cooper!

811
01:13:01,746 --> 01:13:02,831
Cooper!

812
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:09,147
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things!

813
01:15:39,195 --> 01:15:41,364
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

814
01:15:45,868 --> 01:15:48,871
There's supposed to be another broadcast
at three o'clock.

815
01:15:48,955 --> 01:15:51,207
Ten minutes.

816
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:55,044
Oh. Only 10 more minutes?

817
01:15:55,128 --> 01:15:58,006
We don't have very long to wait.

818
01:15:58,089 --> 01:15:59,882
We can leave.

819
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:03,595
Well, we'd better leave soon.

820
01:16:03,678 --> 01:16:05,763
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

821
01:16:11,227 --> 01:16:15,148
You know anything about this area at all?
I mean, is Willard the nearest town?

822
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,485
I don't know.

823
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:23,072
We were...

824
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:28,661
just trying to get to a motel before dark.

825
01:16:29,871 --> 01:16:31,873
You said those things
turned your car over.

826
01:16:31,956 --> 01:16:34,751
You think we can get it back
on its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

827
01:16:34,834 --> 01:16:37,795
Seems like it was pretty far away.

828
01:16:37,879 --> 01:16:39,672
Seems like we ran.

829
01:16:40,673 --> 01:16:42,508
Forget it. It's at least a mile.

830
01:16:43,259 --> 01:16:44,927
Johnny has the keys.

831
01:16:45,553 --> 01:16:49,098
You're going to carry that child a mile?
Through that army of things out there?

832
01:16:49,182 --> 01:16:52,685
I can carry the kid.
What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt?

833
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:57,315
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

834
01:16:59,317 --> 01:17:00,485
What's wrong?

835
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:04,280
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

836
01:17:04,364 --> 01:17:06,949
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

837
01:17:07,617 --> 01:17:09,243
She can't walk. She's too weak.

838
01:17:12,914 --> 01:17:17,001
- Well, one of us could try to get to the car.
- You gonna turn it over by yourself?

839
01:17:17,085 --> 01:17:20,338
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

840
01:17:23,758 --> 01:17:26,886
You have a car? Where? Where is it?

841
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:29,347
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

842
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:31,516
But where is it?

843
01:17:43,736 --> 01:17:45,238
Good Lord.

844
01:17:55,456 --> 01:17:57,208
<i>...being monitored closely by scientists</i>

845
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:00,294
<i>at all the radiation detection stations.</i>

846
01:18:00,378 --> 01:18:04,215
<i>At this hour, they report the level
of the mysterious radiation</i>

847
01:18:04,298 --> 01:18:06,092
<i>continues to increase steadily.</i>

848
01:18:06,884 --> 01:18:09,011
<i>So long as this situation remains,</i>

849
01:18:09,095 --> 01:18:12,056
<i>government spokesmen warn
that dead bodies will continue</i>

850
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:14,726
<i>to be transformed
into the flesh-eating ghouls.</i>

851
01:18:14,809 --> 01:18:19,355
<i>All persons who die during this crisis,
from whatever cause,</i>

852
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:21,858
<i>will come back to life
to seek human victims</i>

853
01:18:21,941 --> 01:18:25,778
<i>unless their bodies
are first disposed of by cremation.</i>

854
01:18:25,862 --> 01:18:28,364
<i>Our news cameras have just returned</i>

855
01:18:28,448 --> 01:18:31,826
<i>from covering such a search-and-destroy
operation against the ghouls,</i>

856
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:34,328
<i>this one conducted by Sheriff Conan McClelland</i>

857
01:18:34,412 --> 01:18:36,414
<i>in Butler County, Pennsylvania.</i>

858
01:18:36,497 --> 01:18:38,958
<i>So now let's go to that filmed report.</i>

859
01:18:39,041 --> 01:18:41,753
<i>All law enforcement agencies
and the military</i>

860
01:18:41,836 --> 01:18:45,923
<i>have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.</i>

861
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:49,093
<i>The survival command center
at the Pentagon has disclosed</i>

862
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:53,347
<i>that a ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head</i>

863
01:18:53,431 --> 01:18:56,017
<i>or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

864
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:57,977
<i>Officials are quoted as explaining</i>

865
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,856
<i>that since the brain of a ghoul
has been activated by the radiation,</i>

866
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:06,277
<i>the plan is,
kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.</i>

867
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:10,656
<i>- Want anything from the supply wagon, Kus?
- Uh, no, we're all right.</i>

868
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,116
<i>Okay.</i>

869
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,494
<i>Hey, Cass,
put that thing all the way in the fire.</i>

870
01:19:14,577 --> 01:19:16,954
<i>- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right. I gotcha.</i>

871
01:19:17,038 --> 01:19:19,165
<i>Chief McClelland, how is everything going?</i>

872
01:19:19,248 --> 01:19:22,668
<i>Ah, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.</i>

873
01:19:22,752 --> 01:19:25,338
<i>You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.</i>

874
01:19:25,421 --> 01:19:27,840
<i>Chief, do you think we'll be able
to defeat these things?</i>

875
01:19:27,924 --> 01:19:30,510
<i>Well, we killed 19 of them today,
right in this area.</i>

876
01:19:30,593 --> 01:19:33,846
<i>Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.</i>

877
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:35,932
<i>They must have thought
somebody was in there.</i>

878
01:19:36,015 --> 01:19:38,392
<i>There wasn't though.
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.</i>

879
01:19:38,476 --> 01:19:40,937
<i>We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.</i>

880
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,189
<i>Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?</i>

881
01:19:43,272 --> 01:19:44,482
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

882
01:19:44,565 --> 01:19:47,068
<i>Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,</i>

883
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:48,778
<i>would I stand a chance with them?</i>

884
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:51,155
<i>Well, there's no problem.
If you had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.</i>

885
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:52,740
<i>That's a sure way to kill 'em.</i>

886
01:19:52,824 --> 01:19:55,451
<i>If you don't, get yourself a club or a torch.
Beat 'em or burn 'em.</i>

887
01:19:55,535 --> 01:19:57,036
<i>They go up pretty easy.</i>

888
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:59,622
<i>Well, Chief McClelland,
how long do you think it will take you</i>

889
01:19:59,705 --> 01:20:01,707
<i>until you get the situation under control?</i>

890
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,585
<i>Well, that's pretty hard to say.
We don't know how many of 'em there are.</i>

891
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:07,296
<i>We know when we find 'em, we can kill 'em.</i>

892
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,299
<i>- Are they slow-moving, Chief?
- Yeah, they're dead.</i>

893
01:20:10,383 --> 01:20:12,218
<i>They're all messed up.</i>

894
01:20:12,301 --> 01:20:16,639
<i>Well, in time, would you say you oughta
be able to wrap this up in 24 hours?</i>

895
01:20:16,722 --> 01:20:19,350
<i>Well, we don't really know.</i>

896
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:22,937
<i>We know we'll be into it most of the night,
probably into the early morning.</i>

897
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,647
<i>We're working our way toward Willard,</i>

898
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,858
<i>and we'll team up
with the National Guard over there,</i>

899
01:20:26,941 --> 01:20:28,943
<i>and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.</i>

900
01:20:29,026 --> 01:20:30,653
<i>Thank you very much, Chief McClelland.</i>

901
01:20:30,736 --> 01:20:34,615
<i>This is Bill Cardille, WIC TV 11 news.</i>

902
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:36,576
<i>Thank you, Bill, for that report.</i>

903
01:20:36,701 --> 01:20:40,246
<i>Official spokesmen declined to speculate
just how long it may take</i>

904
01:20:40,329 --> 01:20:43,833

905

- I don't know. I ‒

906
01:20:57,346 --> 01:20:59,599
I ‒ It isn't the fuse.

907
01:20:59,682 --> 01:21:02,727
The power lines are down.

908
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:07,565
Helen, I have to get that gun.

909
01:21:09,525 --> 01:21:11,611
Haven't you had enough?

910
01:21:11,694 --> 01:21:15,239
Well, two people are dead already
on account of that guy.

911
01:21:15,323 --> 01:21:17,325
Take a look out that window. Look at ‒

912
01:22:15,383 --> 01:22:17,009
Get over here, man!

913
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,221
Come on!

914
01:22:37,446 --> 01:22:39,615
Go ahead. Go ahead.

915
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:41,867
You wanna stay up here now?

916
01:22:41,951 --> 01:22:43,744
Helen, get in the cellar.

917
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,707
Get in the cellar now. Move!

918
01:24:24,512 --> 01:24:27,431
No! No!

919
01:24:31,977 --> 01:24:33,729
Karen?

920
01:24:33,813 --> 01:24:34,814
Karen?

921
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:39,401
Karen.

922
01:24:42,738 --> 01:24:44,365
Poor baby.

923
01:24:46,242 --> 01:24:49,120
Baby.

924
01:25:34,415 --> 01:25:36,292
No! No!

925
01:25:37,918 --> 01:25:41,172
No! No! No!

926
01:25:42,756 --> 01:25:44,258
No!

927
01:25:45,593 --> 01:25:47,136
No! Get out!

928
01:25:49,305 --> 01:25:52,057
No! No, Johnny!

929
01:25:52,141 --> 01:25:54,393
No!

930
01:25:54,476 --> 01:25:56,604
No, no!

931
01:25:56,687 --> 01:25:59,106
Oh, help me, help me.

932
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:00,691
Oh!

933
01:30:33,338 --> 01:30:34,840
Hey, Vince, Al,

934
01:30:34,923 --> 01:30:37,384
you wanna get about four or five men
and a couple dogs?

935
01:30:37,468 --> 01:30:39,470
There's a house over here
behind those trees.

936
01:30:39,553 --> 01:30:42,306
We wanna go check it out.
You still here, Bill?

937
01:30:42,389 --> 01:30:45,392
Yeah, Chief, we're going to stay with it
till we meet up with the National Guard.

938
01:30:45,476 --> 01:30:47,352
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

939
01:30:47,436 --> 01:30:49,480
- You're doing all the work. You take it.
- Thank you.

940
01:30:49,563 --> 01:30:51,982
We should be wrapped up here
about three or four more hours.

941
01:30:52,065 --> 01:30:53,692
We'll probably get into Willard then.

942
01:30:53,775 --> 01:30:56,195
I guess you can go over there
and meet the National Guard.

943
01:30:56,278 --> 01:30:58,614
Nick, you and the rest of these men
wanna come with me?

944
01:30:58,697 --> 01:31:00,866
Bill, I'm gonna check the office,
see what's happening.

945
01:31:00,949 --> 01:31:03,368
All right, Steve.
Tell 'em we're going to stay with it

946
01:31:03,452 --> 01:31:06,622
and everything appears
to be under control.

947
01:31:56,505 --> 01:31:58,799
They need you down there by the barn.

948
01:31:58,882 --> 01:32:00,384
Okay.

949
01:32:02,094 --> 01:32:04,721
Some of you guys
can follow the wagon down.

950
01:32:04,805 --> 01:32:07,641
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

951
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:13,855
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

952
01:32:52,728 --> 01:32:54,730
He's a dead one. Get up here!

953
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:00,169
You, drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

954
01:33:00,253 --> 01:33:01,796
- Nothing down here.
- All right.

955
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,507
Go ahead down and give 'em a hand.
Let's go check out the house.

956
01:33:04,591 --> 01:33:06,593
There's something there. I heard a noise.

957
01:33:11,264 --> 01:33:13,933
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head,
right between the eyes.

958
01:33:17,729 --> 01:33:20,815
Good shot. Okay, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

959
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:24,068
That's another one for the fire.

960
01:33:43,963 --> 01:33:48,301
All right,
send a wagon through directly. Over.

961
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,643
Keep those dogs back off of those things.

962
01:34:58,287 --> 01:35:00,957
Come ahead with the motorcycle, please.

963
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,542
Let's go!

964
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:04,669
That's the way!

965
01:35:05,962 --> 01:35:08,172
Hey, Randy,
light these torches
over here.

966
01:35:08,256 --> 01:35:10,133
Get those people in the back.
Way in the back.
