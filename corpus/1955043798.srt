<i>Or as the locals would tell you...</i>

7
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,838
<i>...a boy became a fish.</i>

8
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:01,076
<i>The boy came from
an average suburb...</i>

9
00:01:02,744 --> 00:01:05,581
<i>...of a great American city.</i>

10
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:09,115

<i>...he dazzled all the town's people</i>

18

him to showcase his talents</i>

[Mrs. Koll] Oh, look at you.

71
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:15,447
- Welcome home, son.
- Oh, Josh, careful, careful.

72
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,517
[Josh] Ah, he's fine. He
looks great. He looks great.

73
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,385
Oh, honey, we missed you so much.

74
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:20,986
- We would have come to get you.
- I know.

75
00:07:20,988 --> 00:07:22,288
Well, why didn't you want
us to come to get you?

76
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,793
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

77
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,230
What's up, dingleberry?

78
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,278
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

79
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:52,520
I love you.

[sighs]

81
00:08:29,591 --> 00:08:32,525
I told your mom not to clean too much.

82
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:35,564
I know how you like for
things to stay the same.

83
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:42,670
Hmm.

84
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:06,859
[Mrs. Koll] Spencer, Emily, dinner!

85
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:08,594
[Emily] But that's what I keep telling him.

86
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,363
Uh, well, I am just glad that he's home

87
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:11,430
so we get to see you more.

88
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:13,366
Hmm, well, that's the real reason

89
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:14,499
why I wanted him to come home

90
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,201
so I could hang out with you guys.

91
00:09:16,203 --> 00:09:18,537
So, Spence, you must be
ready to get back to shop.

92
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,339
You know, if he was a girl
we were gonna name him Emily.

93
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,074
- Ran into Marc the other day.
- Really?

94
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:23,910
He said he could use some help down there.

[cell phone vibrating]

96
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:27,379
[Mrs. Koll] Who is it, honey?

97
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:28,647
Just the guys.

98
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,949
Oh, the rat pack.

99
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:34,387
[growls]

100
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,323
[chuckles] I think you should answer it.

101
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:39,191
- Hey.
- Yo, dude!

102
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:41,160
Hey, man.

103
00:09:41,162 --> 00:09:43,463
Yeah. I'm home.

104
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:45,164
- Oh, Nathan's?
- No!

105
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,233
Uh-huh, there was just
a shooting over there.

106
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,167
Mom, he just got back from Afghanistan

107
00:09:49,169 --> 00:09:50,570
I think he can handle Echo Park.

108
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,906
Uh, well, why don't
you guys just come here?

109
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:55,208
Oh, okay, I'll ask her. Hey, mom...

110
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,508
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,111
She says, "Go fuck yourself, Mailer."

112
00:09:58,113 --> 00:09:59,545
- Ooh!
- Language. Language.

113
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:01,480
Okay. Yeah, I don't
know, I-I'll let you know.

114
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,651
Okay. Okay, bye.

115
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:07,788
We should go.

116
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:11,291
Okay.

117
00:10:11,293 --> 00:10:12,492
Then maybe later I can show you...

118
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,227
I can go.

119
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,362
[Spencer] Oh, that's right, you're of age.

120
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:18,131
[Mrs. Koll] Well, why don't...
You don't have to go tonight.

121
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,998
I mean you could see them anytime you want.

122
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,969
You're back now... for good.

123
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:25,405
How do you know that?

124
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,073
What?

125
00:10:27,075 --> 00:10:28,541
I saw it on the news.

126
00:10:28,543 --> 00:10:30,276
Look, just-just don't
scare your brother, okay?

127
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:31,544
- They're all back for good.
- Wait a minute.

128
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,478
Cooper, you don't think that's true?

129
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,013
[Mrs. Koll] Oh, stop it,
Josh, of course it is.

130
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,416
Three times was enough.

131
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:39,685
They are not sending you back again.

132
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,521
- I'm just sayin'...
- Spencer!

133
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,825
[Mrs. Koll] Please will
you tell your brother?

134
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,164
[rumbling]

135
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,334
Let's just go real quick.

136
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:56,971
I wanna show you the
apartment, it's really cute.

137
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:03,412
Uh... Let's just clean up here.

138
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:20,560
I'll tell you what, if I had
been at the desert that long

139
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:24,196
they'd have to tear me
away from your bedroom.

140
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:27,566
I can't believe he's goin'
out with his friend's tonight.

141
00:11:27,568 --> 00:11:31,603
Hey, he's young, he
wants to see his buddies.

142
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:34,073
- They can't send him back.
- No, they won't.

143
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,474
- They can't do that to us.
- They won't, he's home.

144
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,142
- He's fine, he said...
- But we don't know...

145
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,544
Don't listen to Cooper, he doesn't know!

146
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,546
- It's all rumors.
- We don't know.

147
00:11:40,548 --> 00:11:43,051
How can you know?

148
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:51,959
Hey, um, can we have the keys?

149
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,728
- Can't Emily take you?
- She's not going.

150
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,464
That's good. See you later.

151
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:01,970
[instrumental music]

152
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,608
Monogamy is an intellectual choice.

153
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,243
Amen!

154
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:13,412
We're all fucking animals,
okay? And that is my point.

155
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:16,148
And if you think that you
have total self control...

156
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,084
Hey, Paul, if you think that
you have total self control

157
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,119
then... I don't know, man

158
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:23,388
your girlfriend probably fucking hates you.

159
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,358
Doesn't matter to me 'cause
Imma be fucking her either way.

160
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,060
- You're an idiot.
- Hey.

161
00:12:28,062 --> 00:12:30,363
Yo, fuck me, little brother.

162
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,297
All grown up and shit.

163
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:35,100
'Sup, Howie. Where's Toad?

164
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,170
- Everything set?
- How's your mom doing, Coop?

165
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:40,373
- Uh, fine.
- See, perfect example.

166
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,374
You think his mom doesn't have
self-control, you're a dumbass.

167
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:44,410
She's been ignoring your
little dick for years.

168
00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:47,313
Yeah, well, you gotta put in the 50 years

169
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:49,581
if you wanna get the gold watch.

170
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,618
I mean think about how many of
us have rocked their hurricane

171
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,088
with Darla over there.

172
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,656
See, that is my point exactly.

173
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:59,658
We are not built to put
our seed in just one garden.

174
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,195
What does, uh, "Garden"
refer to in this context?

175
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:05,230
What the fuck do you think
"Garden" refers to, dude?

176
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,465
Garden!

177
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,868
Garden, vagina, garden, okay?

178
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,603
And if you think a woman

you can join the conversation?

Hmm.

00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:46,238
- Yeah.
- Oh, you are ripped, dude.

Ah, I could still take him.

195
00:13:47,808 --> 00:13:50,542
Back on base, I got into
fight with these two rednecks.

196
00:13:50,544 --> 00:13:51,877
Could've used you.

197
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:54,749
Man, I wish I was there.
I could have translated.

198
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:59,185
So, uh, you're for good,
or... you're going back?

199

- Buy me a beer too.

I can see nothing's changed.

Uh, where's Toad?

Oh, dude, Toad, he's
fucking pissed at you, dude.

For not callin' him, he's pissed!

212
00:14:35,822 --> 00:14:37,690
Yeah, he's been whining about it all day.

213
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,392
He's been acting weird lately.
He knew you were comin' back.

- So...
- So he left?

[Howie] Spencer, have-have
you talked with Toad?

216
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,901
I'm not sure he wants to see you, buddy.

217
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,436
Yeah, but Toad's a fucking
sensitive vagina, man.

Let's go in the back, let's
fucking forget about it.

I don't know if I'm in the mood.

Are you gonna bitch about this all night?

226
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,695
Should have called us more, man.

Well, like I said there's a chance.

neighborhood's turning into

knew where that stuff was

...poke around and see if
I can find something useful.

Hmm, not exactly, it's
more like a scrapbook.

357
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:12,898
I've been scavenging for material.

358
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,967
So are you like in the
scrapbooking business?

359
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:18,336
Oh, no, I was working at
a pet store for a while.

360
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:19,971
They were jerks.

361
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:22,341
There comes a point
where you just have to...

362
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:25,477
...break away and follow your dreams.

363
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:27,513
That's probably true.

364
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:32,151
I mean if you find
something you really love.

365
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,689
- Right?
- Right.

366
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,528
So what do you love, Spencer?

367
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:45,163
Uh, wha...

368
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:48,065
I-I'm just asking, like...

369
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,803
- Do you love bein' a soldier?
- Marines, it's a bit different.

370
00:24:50,805 --> 00:24:52,371
I don't know about that stuff.

371
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:54,305
Isn't it like you go
to school though, or...

372
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:57,276
If I wanted that, I guess, yeah.

373
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:01,013
Well, then w-why join?

374
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:04,349
I mean why-why go away?

375
00:25:04,351 --> 00:25:06,051
Honestly?

376
00:25:06,053 --> 00:25:07,920
Everyone's always asking
you what you wanna do?

377
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:10,154
What you wanna make?

378
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:12,056
The Marine Corp just gives you that.

379
00:25:12,058 --> 00:25:14,860
You don't have to think about it.

380
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:16,161
It's not your decision
when you're a part of

381
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:18,063
something bigger.

382
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:22,567
Well, being a part of something bigger...

383
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:26,103
...doesn't make it better.

384
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:28,909
You know that, right?

385
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:34,513
Is that how you convince
yourself to leave the pet store?

- Generally unpleasant and...
- Horrible.

It was in the library and she recited

901
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:32,302
every fucking word of it from memory.

902
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:34,269
Holy Grail.

903
01:01:34,271 --> 01:01:36,842
Destiny kinda shit.

904
01:01:39,077 --> 01:01:42,045
I don't know what you're
talkin' about, man.

905
01:01:42,047 --> 01:01:43,612
Look, I'll-I'll go check at the lake.

906
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:45,682
I need you to help me maximize
my extended breath-hold.

907
01:01:45,684 --> 01:01:46,715
I'm out of practice.

908
01:01:46,717 --> 01:01:48,517
Hold this.

909
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:51,420
Spencer, what is going on with you, man?

910
01:01:51,422 --> 01:01:53,722
Press start when I go under.

911
01:01:53,724 --> 01:01:55,827
Spencer!

912
01:01:57,094 --> 01:02:00,531
Spencer! Spencer!

913
01:02:04,302 --> 01:02:06,702
Okay.

914
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:11,407
Peanut butter... or...

915
01:02:11,409 --> 01:02:13,776
...peanut butter and jelly?

916
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:16,079
How do you eat a peanut butter sandwich?

917
01:02:16,081 --> 01:02:18,380
Doesn't it stick to your mouth?

918
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:20,383
I like it.

919
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:23,186
This jelly is so slimy.

920
01:02:23,188 --> 01:02:25,220
- You're slimy.
- You're slimy.

921
01:02:25,222 --> 01:02:27,423
No, you literally kinda slimy.

922
01:02:27,425 --> 01:02:30,561
[laughs] No. No!

923
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:37,499
- We should make a toast.
- What to?

924
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:39,235
[sighs]

925
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:42,206
I don't know. You do it.

926
01:02:43,307 --> 01:02:46,108
To long life.

927
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,778
Is that supposed to be ironic?

928
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,612
[laughs]

929
01:02:50,614 --> 01:02:53,215
Okay. Uh, to peace on Earth.

930
01:02:53,217 --> 01:02:54,784
You're boring.

931
01:02:54,786 --> 01:02:57,519
Fine, I don't know.

932
01:02:57,521 --> 01:03:00,123
- To boobs.
- Boobs?

933
01:03:00,125 --> 01:03:03,358
Well, I guess that's something.

934
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,063
Clink.

935
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:14,537
[coughing]

936
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:17,307
Hey, hey.

937
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:18,340
Breathe.

938
01:03:18,342 --> 01:03:20,045
[grunts]

939
01:03:21,146 --> 01:03:22,878
[groans]

940
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,416
- What was my time?
- Fuck you, man. Fuck.

941
01:03:26,418 --> 01:03:29,719
You have to stop it when
I come out of the water!

942
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:31,255
Goddammit!

943
01:03:34,326 --> 01:03:36,827
What the fuck?

944
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:45,168
What the fuckin' hell, stuntman.

945
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,769
Yeah, think of all the
times we could have like...

946
01:03:46,771 --> 01:03:49,271
Halloween?

947
01:03:49,273 --> 01:03:51,307
I really don't recall that night.

948
01:03:51,309 --> 01:03:52,909
Well, dude, you were driving.

949
01:03:52,911 --> 01:03:54,309
Well, if you remember it so well

950
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:55,677
why weren't you drivin'?

951
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:57,213
I'll punch you in the liver.

952
01:03:57,215 --> 01:03:59,682
[sighs]

953
01:03:59,684 --> 01:04:01,751
Are his parents home? Like,
maybe we should go in to garage.

954
01:04:01,753 --> 01:04:03,786
The whole point was for
us to wait for him here.

955
01:04:03,788 --> 01:04:05,554
Yeah, but if we're smokin',
then maybe we shouldn't do

956
01:04:05,556 --> 01:04:07,590
that in a seedy alley, genius.

957
01:04:07,592 --> 01:04:09,425
Cops patrol back here.

958
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:11,760
Would you at least grow a right nut, Paul?

959
01:04:11,762 --> 01:04:13,463
Don't have to go for
both, I know that's a lot

960
01:04:13,465 --> 01:04:16,633
to ask from you, but just
invest in half the package...

961
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:17,800
[knocking on window]

962
01:04:17,802 --> 01:04:21,239
- Jesus Christ!
- Uh, come on.

963
01:04:22,407 --> 01:04:24,673
You're like the fuckin'
seed of Chucky, man.

964
01:04:24,675 --> 01:04:26,342
You know, Toad's been callin' me.

965
01:04:26,344 --> 01:04:27,577
What the fuck is going on?

966
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:29,746
Uh, we saw it all. It's fine, okay?

967
01:04:29,748 --> 01:04:31,680
Look, they pulled the car
out, there was no one in there

968
01:04:31,682 --> 01:04:33,383
she couldn't have been with him.

969
01:04:33,385 --> 01:04:35,351
- Well, how can you be so sure?
- I swear on my life, man.

970
01:04:35,353 --> 01:04:36,753
We just came from there.

971
01:04:36,755 --> 01:04:38,521
Well... then where is she?

972
01:04:38,523 --> 01:04:40,690
Look, we saw him leave, we
didn't see her leave, okay?

973
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:42,224
What do you think, they had like

974
01:04:42,226 --> 01:04:43,559
a secret rendezvous point or somethin'?

975
01:04:43,561 --> 01:04:45,762
Calm down. It's nothin' to worry about.

976
01:04:45,764 --> 01:04:47,429
Toad said that Spencer said...

977
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:50,700
Consider tangible evidence
versus the fucked up

978
01:04:50,702 --> 01:04:52,635
post-accident mind of your hero, okay?

979
01:04:52,637 --> 01:04:54,836
He's not working on a practical level.

980
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:56,405
Don't get on an edge about it.

981
01:04:56,407 --> 01:04:57,606
No, not an edge, I'm
tryin' to figure out...

982
01:04:57,608 --> 01:04:59,541
Chill out, bro, okay?

983
01:04:59,543 --> 01:05:01,878
I'm done with the conspiracy theories.

984
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,479
Let's get some tunes goin'.

985
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:05,984
[upbeat music on radio]

986
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,351
Oh, you have to kill me.

987
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:11,753
- What... cops?
- Uh, girlfriend.

988
01:05:11,755 --> 01:05:14,289
Oh! Crap, hide.

989
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:15,758
- Let's hide.
- Where do you wanna hide?

990
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,360
What, the glove compartment or somethin'?

991
01:05:17,362 --> 01:05:20,264
- Hey, you guys, come on.
- Alright.

992
01:05:22,467 --> 01:05:24,970
Oh. Hey.

993
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:28,704
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

994
01:05:28,706 --> 01:05:30,673
Hey, Emily.

995
01:05:30,675 --> 01:05:33,342
We didn't even see you there.

996
01:05:33,344 --> 01:05:34,943
[Emily] He's not with you?

997
01:05:34,945 --> 01:05:38,748
Uh, no, uh, we're waiting
for him, he's still with Toad.

998
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:40,950
He told you to say that?

999
01:05:40,952 --> 01:05:43,552
- No.
- No, it's true.

1000
01:05:43,554 --> 01:05:45,387
Why did you guys leave
him alone last night?

1001
01:05:45,389 --> 01:05:46,688
We didn't.

1002
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,724
Ask Cooper, he'll tell you all about Alice.

1003
01:05:48,726 --> 01:05:50,394
You, idiot.

1004
01:05:51,663 --> 01:05:54,796
That's not a thing. I don't know
what I'm talking about. I'm...

1005
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:57,934
I'm kidding. Cooper's such a nut.

1006
01:05:57,936 --> 01:05:59,635
Who's Alice?

1007
01:05:59,637 --> 01:06:03,141
Look, Em, we don't wanna
get in the middle of this?

1008
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:07,045
Too late now, Cooper.

1009
01:06:14,985 --> 01:06:17,753
- How you doin', Em?
- Who's Alice?

1010
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:20,757
I'm gonna take off with these guys.

1011
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:22,557
[Mailer] Hey, what's
up? Everything alright?

1012
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:25,695
- No, not really.
- What happened at the lake?

1013
01:06:25,697 --> 01:06:28,063
[Toad] Yeah, we checked it out.
Took a look around. She's not there.

1014
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:31,168
[Mailer] That's not what
Spencer was saying to me.

1015
01:06:34,838 --> 01:06:36,373
Spencer.

1016
01:06:39,643 --> 01:06:42,644
Okay, I just need to say this.

1017
01:06:42,646 --> 01:06:45,782
I've been thinking, and I
can't pretend like I'm not angry

1018
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:50,320
and you need to understand that
I have every right to be angry.

1019
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:52,789
I wanna give you whatever
space it is that you're needing

1020
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:54,456
but I also wanna be there for you

1021
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:58,062
because you clearly cannot
be here for yourself.

1022
01:07:00,565 --> 01:07:02,731
So let's just start with you doing

1023
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:06,536
a much better job of talking to me.

1024
01:07:06,538 --> 01:07:07,903
[breathing heavily]

1025
01:07:07,905 --> 01:07:10,572
[timer beeps]

1026
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:13,575
What are you doing?

1027
01:07:13,577 --> 01:07:15,845
I broke my record.

1028
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:18,780
Are you even listening to me?

1029
01:07:18,782 --> 01:07:20,650
Most of the time.

1030
01:07:20,652 --> 01:07:23,686
Spencer, I'm trying to tell
you that I think you need help.

1031
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:26,191
Yes, will you time me?

1032
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:30,528
Who's Alice?

1033
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:36,802
Where did you meet her?

1034
01:07:39,471 --> 01:07:42,537
- At work.
- When?

1035
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:44,507
I don't know, what's the day.

1036
01:07:44,509 --> 01:07:46,575
Did you know her before
you broke up with me?

1037
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:49,077
- I didn't break up with you.
- God, God, don't say that.

1038
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:52,648
It makes it worse.

1039
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,887
- Did you know her?
- Yes.

1040
01:07:57,021 --> 01:07:58,653
- Did you sleep with her?
- Em...

1041
01:07:58,655 --> 01:08:01,456
Don't act like it's not
an important question.

1042
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,592
I didn't say no. Can't you just...

1043
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:04,059
Can't you just what?

1044
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:06,561
Figure it out, stupid girlfriend
or sometimes-girlfriend

1045
01:08:06,563 --> 01:08:08,798
or whatever it is that I am?

1046
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,032
My God, Spencer, you were so good

1047
01:08:11,034 --> 01:08:13,702
and now lying and not
telling the truth all at once.

1048
01:08:13,704 --> 01:08:15,438
It's just a thing that happened.

1049
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,906
So that's it?

1050
01:08:16,908 --> 01:08:18,708
You come back and it's
like five years together

1051
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:20,675
that's just gone?

1052
01:08:20,677 --> 01:08:22,544
You had your freedom, and now you come back

1053
01:08:22,546 --> 01:08:24,813
and you're some kinda guy that
takes random girls to parties?

1054
01:08:24,815 --> 01:08:27,517
You don't think that I
know that I fucked up.

1055
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,720
Whatever I'm feeling it's not about you.

1056
01:08:31,722 --> 01:08:35,460
The whole thing has nothing to do with you.

1057
01:08:48,605 --> 01:08:50,705
And you see this one. Did
he take out that tree too?

1058
01:08:50,707 --> 01:08:53,976
That's what it did to the car.

1059
01:08:53,978 --> 01:08:55,644
- Where were you?
- Spencer?

1060
01:08:55,646 --> 01:08:59,482
- Sit down!
- Hello, Spencer, how are ya?

1061
01:08:59,484 --> 01:09:00,982
[Josh] I'll call Henry.

1062
01:09:00,984 --> 01:09:04,019
I understand you had a bit
of an accident last night.

1063
01:09:04,021 --> 01:09:05,620
Yes, sir.

1064
01:09:05,622 --> 01:09:07,990
The main thing is we
just wanna get you back

1065
01:09:07,992 --> 01:09:09,759
where you need to be.

1066
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:10,793
What if you get called back?

1067
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:13,129
Your country and-and our family

1068
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:14,464
need you to be ready for that.

1069
01:09:14,466 --> 01:09:15,932
Listen, now-now legally

1070
01:09:15,934 --> 01:09:17,567
you're just lookin' at
damage to the guard rail

1071
01:09:17,569 --> 01:09:19,802
a few private trees, things
like that, simple stuff.

1072
01:09:19,804 --> 01:09:22,504
No real harm done there.

1073
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:24,906
But we know about the boy at the party.

1074
01:09:24,908 --> 01:09:26,843
Cell phone videos, all that.

1075
01:09:26,845 --> 01:09:30,045
Family lawyer has got in touch with us.

1076
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:32,482
Now, luckily there's no brain damage.

1077
01:09:32,484 --> 01:09:34,150
Gonna be some reconstructive
surgery necessary.

1078
01:09:34,152 --> 01:09:36,919
I think it's much better...

1079
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:38,854
...if we just sweep it
away, settle out of court.

1080
01:09:38,856 --> 01:09:40,923
Your parents and I'll
pay off all the bills.

1081
01:09:40,925 --> 01:09:42,258
[muffled voice] And you are gonna work off

1082
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,626
every last cent, you understand me?

1083
01:09:44,628 --> 01:09:46,696
[Henry] Yes, you'll pay off the bills.

1084
01:09:46,698 --> 01:09:48,164
We can deal with that later.

1085
01:09:48,166 --> 01:09:50,266
I think what's much more important here

1086
01:09:50,268 --> 01:09:52,535
is that everyone's concerned about you.

1087
01:09:52,537 --> 01:09:55,871
The way I see it, Spencer,
the only way out is through.

1088
01:09:55,873 --> 01:09:59,741
Your parents are here, your
friends, they can all help.

1089
01:09:59,743 --> 01:10:01,110
But you're gonna have
to just look this thing

1090
01:10:01,112 --> 01:10:04,246
right in the face and deal with it.

1091
01:10:04,248 --> 01:10:08,084
Be a man. Say your I'm sorrys.

1092
01:10:08,086 --> 01:10:10,686
And move on.

1093
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:12,220
This isn't a damn game.

1094
01:10:12,222 --> 01:10:13,688
Didn't they teach you discipline?

1095
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:14,723
[knocking on window] Josh, please.

1096
01:10:14,725 --> 01:10:16,092
Spence, let's go.

1097
01:10:16,094 --> 01:10:17,692
[Mrs. Koll] Guys, no, not now. Not now.

1098
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:18,861
You know, what, these
guys need to understand

1099
01:10:18,863 --> 01:10:19,995
the gravity of the situation.

1100
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:21,830
They're half the problem.

1101
01:10:21,832 --> 01:10:23,031
- Let's go, guys, come on.
- Hey!

1102
01:10:23,033 --> 01:10:24,767
- Come on, this way.
- Come on.

1103
01:10:24,769 --> 01:10:27,137
We're getting out of here.

1104
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:44,786
[sighs]

1105
01:10:44,788 --> 01:10:48,292

1106
01:11:06,743 --> 01:11:08,244
[chuckles]

1107
01:11:08,246 --> 01:11:11,280
This is like the best day ever.

1108
01:11:11,282 --> 01:11:14,317
What is this?

1109
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,055
I've got a surprise for you.

1110
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,291
Where?

1111
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:28,632
[instrumental music]

1112
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:50,919
[gasping]

1113
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:53,089
[people cheering]

1114
01:11:53,091 --> 01:11:55,223
[both chuckling]

1115
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:56,858
This is heaven?

1116
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:59,227
Or a dream?

1117
01:11:59,229 --> 01:12:02,365
Is this the book?

1118
01:12:02,367 --> 01:12:05,670
Alice, uh, are these people from the book?

1119
01:12:08,905 --> 01:12:10,406
Come on, you know the answer.

1120
01:12:10,408 --> 01:12:13,108
[both chuckle]

1121
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,044
Just stop asking questions.

1122
01:12:16,046 --> 01:12:18,981
It's just a place like any other.

1123
01:12:18,983 --> 01:12:21,485
But can it last forever?

1124
01:12:22,819 --> 01:12:25,286
Can anything?

1125
01:12:25,288 --> 01:12:27,289
If you don't let it
end, it doesn't have to.

1126
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,157
[chuckles]

1127
01:12:29,159 --> 01:12:30,259
It'll never have to.

1128
01:12:30,261 --> 01:12:32,097
Right?

1129
01:12:33,131 --> 01:12:35,130
Only question you should be asking...

1130
01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:37,299
[sighs]

1131
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:40,335
...is where should I be right now.

1132
01:12:40,337 --> 01:12:42,271
I know the answer.

1133
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:44,373
Here.

1134
01:12:44,375 --> 01:12:46,174
With you.

1135
01:12:46,176 --> 01:12:49,680
[instrumental music]

1136
01:12:57,889 --> 01:12:59,421
I'm-I'm-I'm
starting to feel

1137
01:12:59,423 --> 01:13:02,659
like that might not be a victory, Spencer.

1138
01:13:04,929 --> 01:13:06,294
Why don't you wanna be back

1139
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:09,065
with all those people
who are waiting for you?

1140
01:13:09,067 --> 01:13:11,200
- Oh, I can't.
- Why?

1141
01:13:11,202 --> 01:13:14,003
Because...

1142
01:13:14,005 --> 01:13:15,870
...I've...

1143
01:13:15,872 --> 01:13:17,238
...I've done things.

1144
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,974
What-what-what
things?

1145
01:13:19,976 --> 01:13:22,212
Terrible things.

1146
01:13:23,381 --> 01:13:26,818
- Spencer...
- I can't breathe up there.

1147
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:34,089
They never found my body, did they?

1148
01:13:34,091 --> 01:13:36,759
Spencer, oh my God.

1149
01:13:36,761 --> 01:13:38,193
Breathe. Breathe!

1150
01:13:38,195 --> 01:13:40,196
Wake up, breathe.

1151
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:41,296
[crying] Spencer.

1152
01:13:41,298 --> 01:13:43,264
Mom?

1153
01:13:43,266 --> 01:13:45,401
- Spencer, wake up.
- No, no, let be back.

1154
01:13:45,403 --> 01:13:46,869
- No, Spencer. Spencer!
- Let be back.

1155
01:13:46,871 --> 01:13:48,169
Spencer, if you father sees you

1156
01:13:48,171 --> 01:13:50,004
doing this, he'll go crazy.

1157
01:13:50,006 --> 01:13:52,107
Look at me! Look at me.

1158
01:13:52,109 --> 01:13:53,776
Oh, baby.

1159
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:56,778
[sobbing] You need, you need to stay here.

1160
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,414
- Here, Spencer.
- No, no.

1161
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:00,081
- I can't stay here.
- Stop!

1162
01:14:00,083 --> 01:14:01,317
- Spencer, stop it!
- I can't stay here.

1163
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:03,451
Please let me help you.

1164
01:14:03,453 --> 01:14:05,321
[crying]

1165
01:14:05,323 --> 01:14:08,324
Spencer? Spencer?

1166
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:10,125
Let's go. Come on, man.

1167
01:14:10,127 --> 01:14:12,961
Stop, stop.

1168
01:14:12,963 --> 01:14:15,397
Just stop, stop. Let's slow down.

1169
01:14:15,399 --> 01:14:17,133
- Just slow everything down.
- What for?

1170
01:14:17,135 --> 01:14:18,933
What for? Come on, you're
so intense right now.

1171
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:21,003
Let's just... take a deep breath

1172
01:14:21,005 --> 01:14:23,272
and talk about where we go from here.

1173
01:14:23,274 --> 01:14:24,773
That's the theme of the day.

1174
01:14:24,775 --> 01:14:26,776
Yeah, well, do you
realize what you just did?

1175
01:14:26,778 --> 01:14:29,144
I broke five minutes, man.

1176
01:14:29,146 --> 01:14:30,812
The Submarine Kid broke twenty.

1177
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:33,115
[panting] I think she can
hold her breath forever.

1178
01:14:33,117 --> 01:14:35,250
Spencer, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1179
01:14:35,252 --> 01:14:37,419
Just more practice then
I can stay with her!

1180
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:39,789
Stop thinking about this shit! Quit it!

1181
01:14:39,791 --> 01:14:41,991
Let's just take your brother,
we can go to Nathan's.

1182
01:14:41,993 --> 01:14:43,424
On the way at least we
can get a case of beer

1183
01:14:43,426 --> 01:14:45,494
and a sack of weed and
fucking relax and talk about.

1184
01:14:45,496 --> 01:14:47,263
No, man! Let me do this!

1185
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:49,098
Do what? Wait.

1186
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,566
What are you doing?

Don't apologize for this.

Spencer...

1240
01:19:29,145 --> 01:19:31,345
...I know you won't believe
me, but whatever this is

1241
01:19:31,347 --> 01:19:33,885
it's not your story.

01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:37,119
You think you're escaping
the bullshit with this

1243

but you're just going farther into it.

1244
01:19:39,756 --> 01:19:41,456
You're lost.

1245
01:19:41,458 --> 01:19:45,126
I was just like you. I
came back, I was a shell.

1246
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:48,129
I had to retrace the steps.

1247
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:50,665
It's hard work.

1248
01:19:50,667 --> 01:19:54,369

out is not real freedom.
