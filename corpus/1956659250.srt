(Thunder crashing)

(static buzzing)

3
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:27,295
Man#1:
DADDY?

4
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,164
Man #2:
IT'S OVER, KURT.

5
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,665
IT'S OVER.

6
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,303
- Kurt: YOU DID THIS TO ME! (Shouts)
- (gunshot)

7
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:41,509

00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,687
Woman:
What's today?

11
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,556
- My birthday.
- It is?!

12
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,392
- How old are you today?
- Five.

13
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,262
- Are you excited?
- Yes.

14
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,563
(Rewinds)

15
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,701
Ah, here we go.
For you.

16
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,139
Man:
Hey, Pat, looking good.

17
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:17,445
- Back up, back up.
- Woman: Hit it!

18
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:19,347
- (Cheering)
- Man: That's it, kid.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,582
Okay, Sara?

20
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,352
(Cheers)
Whoo, good job.

21
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,790
Man:
Go get the candy.

22
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,860
Woman:
Kurt, that's enough.

23
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,462
Pat!

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,602
What a beautiful
music box.

25
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:43,737
(Playing tune)

26
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,642
Kurt, sweetie, come on.
Give that back to Sara.

27
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:51,645
- Kurt!
- (Horn tooting)

28
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,919
- (applause)
your candles.and blow out

29
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,888
(blows)

30
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,890
Woman:
That was mean!

31
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,792
(Kid laughs)

32
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,328
- (guests exclaim)
- Kurt!

33
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,664
- (Kurt laughing)
- Okay, that is it!

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,569
(Laughing continues)

35
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:27,114
Man:
Sara, it's okay.

36
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,487
Woman:
Happy birthday, sweetie.

37
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,332
(Whooshing)

38
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,335
Kurt?
Kurt?

39
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,670
Kurt!

40
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:56,810
(Tape forwarding)

41
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,415
(door opens)

42
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,185
- (music box playing)
- Kurt?

43
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,590
I know you're probably
mad at Mommy,

44
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,959
but you know why I had
to bring you up here, right?

45
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,764
It was not very nice,
what you did to Sara.

46
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,567
And you're gonna have
to say you're sorry.

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,303
Honey, are you okay?

48
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,439
Kurt, look at me.

49
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,809
Kurt, what's wrong?

50
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,315
- (Thuds)
- (shouts)

51
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:36,684
(gasping, whimpering)

52
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,456
- Sweetie, what are you doing?
- (Crying)

53
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,224
(yelps, panting)

54
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,897
(choking, coughing)

55
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:55,503
- (crying throughout)
throughout) playing

56
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,979
(thudding continues
throughout)

57
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:30,270
(static buzzing)

58
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:37,511
Woman: 911,
what's your emergency?

59
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,681
Sara: My mom's upstairs and she's hurt real bad.

60
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,516
Is she awake?

61
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,685
Can she talk to you?

62
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:48,956
She's on the floor.
There's lots of blood.

63
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,526
- What's your name?
- Sara.

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,796
- How old are you, Sara?
- Five.

65
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,399
It's my birthday.

66
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:00,934
Sara, we're starting
help for your mommy.

67
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,103
I need to find out
what's wrong with her.

68
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,839
Can you tell me what's
the matter with your mommy?

69
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,542
I don't know.
She's bleeding real bad.

70
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:11,679
Okay, sweetie.
With me.y on the line

71
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,448
An officer will be there
as soon as they can.

72
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:16,784
Don't hang up, Sara.
With me, okay? Ne

73
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,553
Okay.

74
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,690
Sara, is your
daddy home?

75
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,759
- He's a policeman.
- Is he there?

76
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:29,630
- He's not home.
In the house with you?

77
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,099
My brother.

78
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,102
- What's his name?
- Kurt.

79
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,805
He was bad today.

80
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,466
Pat:
WHY DID HE DO THIS?

81
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,935
Woman:
IT'S COMPLICATED.

82
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:12,139
KURT'S MIND HAS FALLEN
INTO A DEEP PSYCHOSIS,

83
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,175
WHICH HAS DAMAGED
HIS BRAIN.

84
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,846
HIS MEMORIES HAVE BEEN
SEVERELY REPRESSED.

85
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,982
IT'S KURT'S WAY
OF COPING WITH--

86
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,718
WITH WHAT HE DID
TO HIS MOTHER.

87
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:28,622
Why did you kill
your mother, Kurt?

88
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:33,160
SO HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

89
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:36,730
NO. YOUR SON APPEARS
TO BE SUFFERING

90
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:40,601
FROM A RARE FORM OF DISSOCIATIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER.

91
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:43,804
KURT IS CONFUSED.

92
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,507
HE HAS BURIED
SO MUCH OF HIS PAST

93
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,143
THAT HE HAS LOST HIS OWN SENSE OF IDENTITY.

94
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,646
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE IS ANYMORE.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,950
HIS SENSE OF REALITY
IS COMPLETELY DISTORTED.

96
00:06:56,984 --> 00:07:00,554
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE HIS OWN LIFE STOPS

97
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,756
AND WHERE THE REST
OF THE WORLD BEGINS.

98
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,893
IT'S AS THOUGH
HIS MIND WERE--

99
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,195
WERE TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE.

100
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,799
CAN YOU HELP HIM?

101
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:14,001
CAN YOU HELP
BRING HIM BACK?

102
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,471
I DON'T KNOW.

103
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,097
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
WE CAN DO HERE.

104
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:49,269
FAIRVIEW IS A MUCH
BETTER FACILITY.

105
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,806
IT'S A FULL SERVICE
MAXIMUM-SECURITY HOSPITAL.

106
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,076
WE'RE JUST NOT
EQUIPPED FOR...

107
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,780
FOR WHAT HE MIGHT
BE CAPABLE OF.

108
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,483
HE'LL GET THE BEST POSSIBLE
TREATMENT THERE.

109
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,888
I KNOW.

110
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,791
I JUST THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE HE MIGHT GET BETTER.

111
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,960
WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

112
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,863
HE HASN'T RESPONDED
TO ANY OF THE TREATMENT.

113
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:20,033
HIS INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE HAS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT.

114
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:23,503
- SO HE STILL HASN'T SPOKEN SINCE--
- NOT A WORD.

115
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,691
THERE ARE SOME
TRANSFER PAPERS

116
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:46,159
IN MY OFFICE I WILL
NEED FOR YOU TO SIGN.

117
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,295
- (Locks clank)
- OKAY.

118
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,071
(Twig snaps)

119
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,741
(rustling)

120
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,312
(door opens)

121
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,149
- HI, HONEY.
- HI.

122
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,988
HOW DID IT GO?

123
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,890
AH, ABOUT HOW I EXPECTED.

124
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:33,827
UM, THEY FELT IT WOULD
BE MORE APPROPRIATE--

125
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:38,932
THEY'RE TRANSFERRING KURT
TO FAIRVIEW TONIGHT.

126
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:41,334
I'M SORRY.

127
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,772
I'M JUST GONNA GO CHANGE.

128
00:11:44,805 --> 00:11:46,907
WHERE'S SARA?

129
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,842
WHERE DO YOU THINK?

130
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,278
* OH, I JUST WANT TO BE

131
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,981
* WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE BE

132
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,482
* WHOA, AT THE SPOT

133
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,985
* WHOA,
AT THE SPOT *

134
00:11:58,018 --> 00:11:59,853
* THE SPOT,
OH, I JUST WANT TO GO... *

135
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:03,924
SO IS THE CAMPING STUFF
READY?

136
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,793
YES, IT'S IN THE GARAGE.

137
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,095
WHAT'S THE PLAN AGAIN?

138
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,097
WE'RE MEETING
THE GUYS AT 8:00,

139
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,801
DRINKING BY 8:10,
SETTING UP CAMP BY 8:20

140
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:16,870
- AND GETTING IT ON BY 8:30.
- (Giggles)

141
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,473
- V, PUT THAT OUT.
- WHAT?

142
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,375
- WHAT A DRAG?
- NO NO, COME ON.

143
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,778
JOLENE'S DOWNSTAIRS.
JUST NOT IN THE HOUSE.

144
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,479
OH, I KNOW YOU
WANT ONE.

145
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,050
WELL, I KNOW YOU'LL
WANT ONE AT 8:35,

146
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,820
RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME
PAUL FINISHES FILLING YOU UP.

147
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,155
MY GOD, YOU'RE SICK.

148
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:38,225
- (Knocks)
- Jolene: ARE YOU GIRLS ALMOST FINISHED IN THERE?

149
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,527
- YOUR FATHER'S HOME.
- YEAH, WE'RE JUST--

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,362
OH, WE'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

151
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,064
(Coughs)

152
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,501
NOW WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU
TELL HER WE'RE DOING,

153
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,403
SO I CAN EARN
MY OSCAR NOMINATION?

154
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,140
WE'RE GOING TO THE MOVIES THEN WE'RE CRASHING AT YOUR HOUSE.

155
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,575
WONDERFUL, DARLING.

156
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,178
- WHAT IF SHE TRIES TO CALL?
- MAKE SOMETHING UP.

157
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,247
OR BETTER YET,
JUST DON'T ANSWER IT.

158
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,882
OKAY.

159
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,553
- HAND ME MY CLOTHES.
- YES, DARLING, RIGHT AWAY.

160
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,555
OKAY, THANK YOU.

161
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,483
(Laughter)

162
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,089
(boy chattering)

163
00:13:42,122 --> 00:13:43,857
GO LEFT.

164
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:48,328
THERE WE GO.

165
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,830
- OH, PFFT!
- (Laughter)

166
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,438
PAT?

167
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,009
PAT?

168
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,388
PAT.

169
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:41,048
(Door closes)

170
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,386
WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.
I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED.

171
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,888
VERY FUNNY.

172
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,993
HEY, VERONICA,
CAN I HELP YOU FIND SOMETHING?

173
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,661
NO NO, I'M GOOD.

174
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:58,031
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS ARE HUNGRY,
I CAN MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

175
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,436
SO WHAT TIME'S THE MOVIE?

176
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,438
- 8:00.
- 8:30.

177
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,276
THE MOVIE STARTS AT 8:00,

00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,411
BUT WE PROBABLY HAVE

BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

180
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,285
YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY RATHER YOU ATE HERE
INSTEAD OF THE JUNK AT THE THEATER.

181
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:21,288
JOLENE, WE'LL BE FINE.
BESIDE WE DON'T HAVE TIME ANYWAY.

182
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,103
* Oooh, so fine

183
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:40,040

184
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,942

185
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,621

186
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,703

187
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,210

188
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,451
(Panting)

189
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,655
OH FUCK.

190
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,404

193
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,161
(Grunting)

194
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,635

GARY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

197
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:58,145
OKAY, LISTEN,

199
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,150

206
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,284
(sighs)

207
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,935
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

208
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,804
YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUTTA ME.

209
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:08,541

WITH YOUR BROTHER?

210
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,843
V, PUT THAT AWAY.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT THAT.

211
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,845
GOD, SARA,
I DIDN'T KNOW.

212
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,014
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW
FUCKED UP YOUR BROTHER WAS.

00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,719

216
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,696

217
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:31,864
- AND START LOOKING AT OUR--

218
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,501
IT'S OKAY.

219
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,670
SO WHERE ARE YOU GIRLS

228
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:03,396
OH, HONEY, COME ON.
DON'T START, PLEASE.

229
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,566
I'M SERIOUS.
YOU HAVE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

230
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,869
- IF YOU DON'T SAY SOMETHING, I WILL.

WE GOT AWAY WITH IT.

240
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,402
HE WAS JUST LIKE, SARA--

241
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,371

- (Screams)
- (whistling)

254
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,860
Jolene: WHY DO YOU ALWAYS LET
THEM GET AWAY WITH EVERYTHING?

255
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:49,996
HONEY, YOU DO THIS
EVERY TIME.

256
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,665
YOU ARE ALWAYS MAKING
EXCUSES FOR HER.

257
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:54,066
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

258
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,669
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE AFRAID
OF BEING TOO HARD ON HER.

259
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,204
HONEY, SHE NEEDS
DISCIPLINE.

260
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,672
YEAH, WELL SHE GETS
PLENTY OF THAT.

261
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:01,207
BUT SHE'LL ONLY
LISTEN TO YOU.

262
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,643
SHE DOESN'T EVER
LISTEN TO ME.

263
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,545
SHE DOESN'T RESPECT ME.

264
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:07,814
AND SOMETIMES
I WONDER IF YOU DO.

265
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,849
OH, COME ON.
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

266
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:12,685
- YEAH, I DO, BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE AFRAID.
- AFRAID OF WHAT?

267
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,555
AFRAID THAT I MIGHT ACTUALLY DO A
BETTER JOB THAN HER REAL MOTHER.

268
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:23,162
I JUST GET
SO FRUSTRATED.

269
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,598
Dispatcher: All units we have a 318 in progress

270

277
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,120
THANK GOD.

278
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,522

YOU WERE JUST THERE
ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.

291
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,946
YOU'RE LUCKY
I DIDN'T RUN YOU OVER.

292
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,381
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
BACK THERE ANYWAY?

293
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,756
I THOUGHT I WAS...

294
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:40,292
I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

295
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,194
YEAH, WELL,
YOU ALMOST WERE.

296
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:45,197

WHO?

300
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,825

NO.

305
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,844
I WAS CHASING HIM.

306
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,982
THEN HE PUSHED ME.

307
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,490

00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:46,859
NO, THERE WAS
NO ONE THERE.

309
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,329
I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE.

310
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,267
YOU WERE ALONE.

311
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,975
PLEASE JUST TAKE ME HOME.

312
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,014

00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,201
- WE HAVE TO SHARE THAT ONE.
- NICE, THANKS.

355
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:34,440
- (Belches)
- Veronica: NICE.

356
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:36,842
(Laughs)

357
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,348
ARE YOU COMING?

358
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,551
(Sighs) WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

359
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,320
NO.
I JUST--

360
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,456
I'M JUST A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT.

361
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,659
JUST GOT A WEIRD FEELING
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

362
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,661
WE'RE SO CLOSE
TO MY HOUSE.

363
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,230
- I JUST--
- COME HERE.

364
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,740
COME HERE.

365
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,185
DON'T YOU WORRY YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD ABOUT A THING.

366
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:22,388
YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T LET ANYTHING
HAPPEN TO THIS BEAUTIFUL BODY, RIGHT?

367
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:24,256
- PAUL, I'M SERIOUS.
- (Sighs)

368
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,458
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S UP?

369
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,161
WHAT'S REALLY
BOTHERING YOU?

370
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,297
IT'S KURT.

371
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,465
- YOUR BROTHER?
- YEAH.

372
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:38,570
IT'S JUST THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY
WEIRD AROUND THE HOUSE LATELY...

373
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,807
ESPECIALLY WITH MY DAD.

374
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,244
LIKE TONIGHT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
SIGN THE TRANSFER PAPERS FOR KURT.

375
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,780
AND THEN VERONICA WAS LOOKING AT
THE FILE AND THEN JOLENE GOT MAD.

376
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,482
SARA, SARA.

377
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,784
YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO.

378
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,720
I KNOW HE'S YOUR BROTHER,

379
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:57,155
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

380
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,262
I JUST HATE TO SEE
YOU GET ALL WORKED UP.

381
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,598
I KNOW.

382
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:09,568
I GUESS I'M JUST REALLY
KIND OF NERVOUS ABOUT...

383
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:12,671
YOU KNOW, TONIGHT.

384
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,773
OKAY.

385
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,176
LISTEN, I DON'T WANT
YOU TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

386
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,648
WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
IF YOU'RE NOT READY.

387
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,884
LET'S JUST
HAVE FUN, OKAY?

388
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,586
OKAY.

389
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,522
DOES MY SARA GIRL NEED
A LITTLE LIQUID COURAGE?

390
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,259
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
SHE DOES.

391
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,629
(Rattling)

392
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,299
DON'T WORRY, GUYS.
WE'VE GOT THIS.

393
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,568
OH!
(Laughs)

394
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,906
COME ON.

395
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,843
Dr. Engle:
HE'S LOST HIS OWN SENSE.

396
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,745
Denton:
IT'S KURT.

397
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,449
(Siren wailing)

398
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:06,325
(radio chatter)

399
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:20,839
WHERE'S THE GUARD?

400
00:37:20,872 --> 00:37:23,008
HE'S BACK BY THE REAR ENTRANCE
JUST STRAIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

401
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,411
- TAKE THE MEDICS.
- THIS WAY, GUYS.

402
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,549
(Door buzzes)

403
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,718
(radio chatter)

404
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,588
OKAY, TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

405
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,390
WELL, I'M NOT
REALLY SURE.

406
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,659
KURT WAS SCHEDULED
TO BE TRANSFERRED.

407
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,894
HE WAS BEING HELD MEDICATED
IN THE DETAINMENT ROOM.

408
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:44,630
THERE WERE TWO ARMED GUARDS
WHO WERE ASSISTING--

409
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,064
WAIT WAIT WAIT,
SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN.

410
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,367
- KURT?
- HE'S A PATIENT.

411
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,502
- NOT KURT BAKER?
- YEAH.

412
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:52,571
OH SHIT.

413
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,506
SO YOU KNOW
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

414
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,609
AT SOME POINT HE MUST HAVE
ATTACKED THE GUARDS.

415
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,345
THERE WERE TWO
SECURITY GUARDS?

416
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:01,447
YES, ONE IS DOWN,
THE OTHER ONE'S MISSING.

417
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,781
HE'S NOT ANSWERING
HIS RADIO.

418
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:04,750
IS IT POSSIBLE HE MAY
HAVE GONE AFTER HIM?

419
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,618
THAT'S DEFINITELY
A POSSIBILITY.

420
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,054
NURSE, COULD YOU GET THESE PATIENTS TO THEIR ROOMS, PLEASE?

421
00:38:09,087 --> 00:38:10,556
I'M TRYING, LINDA.

422
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:12,324
COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GO.

423
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,398
DISPATCH, WE HAVE A SITUATION AT YELLOW GLEN.

424
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,534
ONE SECURITY GUARD IS DOWN,
THE OTHER IS MISSING.

425
00:38:22,568 --> 00:38:26,037
COULD POSSIBLY BE IN PURSUIT,
BUT THERE'S NO CONTACT AT THIS TIME.

426
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,806
Dispatcher:
Affirm, 1540.

427
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,075
We have reports
of a one-car rollover accident

428
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,444
on Highway 10
east of milepost 13.

429
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:34,513
Available units
please respond.

430
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:37,749
- PARSONS, YOU GOT THIS?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:39,718
THANKS.

432
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,822
THE SECURITY GUARD'S DEAD.

433
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,557
OH MY GOD.

434
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:48,594
OKAY, SEAL OFF THIS AREA.
I WANT EVERYBODY OFF THIS FLOOR.

435
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,462
OKAY.

436
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,731
MOORE, CAN YOU HELP
THEM THERE?

437
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,332
YEAH.

438
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,138
HEY, PAT.

439
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,708
WE HAVE A HOMICIDE HERE.

440
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,810
OKAY, LET'S GET
OUR K9 UNIT UP THERE

441
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,945
AND I WANT A TWO-MILE PERIMETER AROUND THE HOSPITAL.

442
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:09,615
- EVERYBODY'S ON THIS.
- 10-4.

443
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:12,918
HEY, PAT.

444
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,487
GO AHEAD.

445
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,391
IT'S KURT.

446
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,595
(Static)

447
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:26,364
DID YOU COPY THAT?

448
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,901
YEAH.

449
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:31,737
I COPY.

450
00:39:34,573 --> 00:39:36,608
PAT, I'M--

451
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,444
I'M SORRY.

452
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,512
WE'LL FIND HIM.

453
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,115
I KNOW.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

454
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:01,099
(Crickets chirping)

455
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,696
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

456
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,130
SOMETHING LIKE THIS
COULD HAPPEN.

457
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,866
EXCUSE ME, LINDA.
GARY'S WIFE IS ON THE PHONE.

458
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,868
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HER?

459
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,105
- IS THIS GARY?
- NO.

460
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:42,073
GARY IS THE ONE
WHO'S MISSING.

461
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:43,709
I'LL HANDLE IT.

462
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:45,911
- MOORE.
- YEAH?

463
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,846
I WANT YOU TO MAKE
A SWEEP OF THE GROUNDS.

464
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,781
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S
WHERE THEY NEED TO BE.

465
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:52,751
LOOK FOR CLUES--
WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND.

466
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,194
(Footsteps crunching)

467
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:19,905
(panting)

468
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:45,563
Dr. Engle:
THIS IS IT.

469
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,359
PAT.

470
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:16,962
I'M-- I'M SO SORRY.

471
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:18,697
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

472
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,100
LANE, I WANT TO
KEEP THIS LOW-KEY.

473
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,335
I DON'T WANT ANY OUTSIDE
DEPARTMENTS ON THIS

474
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,971
AND I WANT
SAFETIES ON, OKAY?

475
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,039
RIGHT, CHIEF.

476
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:42,253
CAN I HAVE
A MOMENT ALONE?

477
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,655
PLEASE?

478
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,757
OF COURSE.

479
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,400
(Door shuts)

480
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,561
- (radio flickers)
- JESUS!

481
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:38,796
Baker, this is Parsons.
Come in.

482
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:45,103
(Sighs)

483
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,905
GO AHEAD.

484
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:48,506
I'M DOWN HERE
AT THE CAR ACCIDENT.

485
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,208
THE DRIVER'S BEEN KILLED.

486
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:51,910
Pat:
Can you take care of it?

487
00:46:51,943 --> 00:46:54,445
SHERIFF, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS.

488
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:56,915
WHAT IS IT?

489
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,184
WELL, WE FOUND
A NAME TAG IN THE CAR

490
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:01,486
WITH THE NAME
GARY JORDAN.

491
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,354
OH, JESUS.

492
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,297
(Panting)

493
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,920
(door creaks)

494
00:47:36,254 --> 00:47:38,389
HELLO?

495
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,261
IS ANYONE HERE?

496
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:46,264
(Door slams)

497
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,308
(bottle rattles)

498
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,569
HELLO?

499
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:23,194
COME ON.

500
00:49:23,228 --> 00:49:25,363
COME ON,
RING, DAMN IT.

501
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:27,265
(Service hose dinging)

502
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,534
(phone ringing)

503
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,338
911, what is the nature
of your emergency?

504
00:49:33,371 --> 00:49:37,308
- (Service hose dinging)
- Hello? Hello?

505
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,061
OH, GOD.

506
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,028
(Weakly)
WHY?

507
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,139
(Grunts)

508
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:56,221
(groaning)

509
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,331
AH!

510
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,272
(Straining)

511
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,555
OH GOD.
SHIT.

512
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,325
(Groans)

513
00:51:41,799 --> 00:51:44,235
(groans)

514
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,648
(panting)

515
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,803
(Kurt laughing)

516
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,476
(laughing)

517
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,744
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT.

518
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,446
DOES HIS GIRLFRIEND KNOW
THAT HE DID THAT?

519
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,349
I JUST TELL IT
LIKE I SEE IT.

520
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,218
OH, I THINK
I'M GONNA TELL HER.

521
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,919
I'M FREEZING.

522
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:38,256
HEY, I KNOW A WAY
TO WARM YOU GUYS UP.

523
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:39,790
Sara:
YEAH, I'LL BET YOU DO.

524
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,960
EVERY TIME I FART,
EVERYBODY DRINKS.

525
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,263
- ARE YOU READY?
- AND HOW OLD ARE WE?

526
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,265
I CANNOT BELIEVE
I ACTUALLY SLEEP WITH YOU.

527
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,967
- (Farts)
- (groans)

528
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,570
EVERYBODY DRINK.
OOOH!

529
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,379
THAT IS SO WRONG.

530
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,282
ROAR.

531
00:53:04,315 --> 00:53:05,616
OH MY GOD,
THAT REMINDS ME.

532
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,352
I HAVE TO TELL
YOU GUYS THIS.

533
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,819
LAST WEEK I WENT
IN FOR MY PAP SMEAR.

534
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:11,789
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING
WE ALL NEED TO HEAR ABOUT.

535
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,425
NO NO, LISTEN.
I GO IN,

536
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:16,927
THE NURSE TELLS ME TO TAKE OFF ALL
MY CLOTHES AND PUT ON THIS GOWN.

537
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:20,565
SO I'M SITTING ON THE TABLE,
MY BARE ASS IS HANGING OUT

538
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:22,333
AND THE DOCTOR COMES IN.

539
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,869
HE TELLS ME TO LAY BACK AND PUT MY FEET UP IN THE STIRRUPS.

540
00:53:24,902 --> 00:53:27,838
SO I LAY BACK,
SPREAD MY LEGS,

541
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,641
PROP MY FEET
UP IN THE STIRRUPS

542
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,009
AND HE'S DOWN THERE.

543
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,844
YOU KNOW,
HE'S DOWN THERE.

544
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,514
HIS HEAD IS DOWN
THERE AND HE GOES,

545
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,584
"OH MY.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO NUMB YOU UP FOR THIS ONE."

546
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:42,820
I'M THINKING,
"OH MY GOD. NUMB ME UP?

547
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:45,423
I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO THIS BEFORE.
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?"

548
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:47,725
SO HE TELLS ME
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH

549
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,727
AND IT'LL ALL BE OVER
BEFORE I KNOW IT.

550
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,464
SO I TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
HE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THERE

551
00:53:53,498 --> 00:53:55,566
AND GOES,
"NUMB NUMB NUMB NUMB."

552
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,503
(Laughing)

553
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,939
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA
DO TO YOU LATER.

554
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:04,409
- OH, YOU KNOW IT, HONEY.
- (Laughs)

555
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,043
I CAN'T FIND MY--

556
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,012
Greg:
LET'S GO RIGHT NOW.

557
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,515
Veronica:
OKAY.

558
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,854
HEY, GUYS.

559
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,756
I'VE GOT A RUNNER
ON DECK.

560
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:20,491
- NO. NO.
- OH, NO.

561
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,393
- NO NO NO NO.
- NO NO NO, WAIT.

562
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:24,529
- (Farts)
- (laughing)

563
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,531
(groans)

564
00:54:26,564 --> 00:54:28,633
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
JUST DID THAT AGAIN.

565
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,935
(Blowing)

566
00:54:30,968 --> 00:54:34,505
OH, THAT'S SO GROSS.

567
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,407
DRINK.

568
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:39,009
HONEY, ONE MORE OF THOSE AND YOU'RE GOING TO SIT BY YOURSELF.

569
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:43,581
(Laughing)

570
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,291
(phone ringing)

571
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:02,400
HEY.

572
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:04,802
- DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?
- Yeah.

573
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:08,072
WELL, I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU,
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

574
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:10,508
He's escaped.

575
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,642
WHAT?

576
00:55:11,676 --> 00:55:14,879
UH, LOOK I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GET INTO IT RIGHT NOW.

577
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:17,982
JUST SOMETHING WENT WRONG
DURING THE TRANSFER.

578
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,017
What are you guys
going to do?

579
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,986
WE'RE TRACKING HIM RIGHT NOW.
WE'LL CATCH HIM.

580
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,455
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA
TRY TO COME HERE, DO YOU?

581
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:26,557
No, no I don't think so.

582
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:28,826
JESUS, HONEY.

583
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,695
(Locks click)

584
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:33,398
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

585
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:36,634
I'VE GOT TO GO, OKAY?
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

586
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:39,970
OKAY.
I LOVE YOU.

587
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,706
YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO.

588
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:45,009
- HONEY.
- YEAH?

589
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,878
ABOUT EARLIER...

590
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:50,848
I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO COME OUT THAT WAY.

591
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:53,083
I KNOW.

592
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,723
I'LL CALL YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

593
00:55:58,756 --> 00:56:00,357
Bye.

594
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,880
(Radio chatter)

595
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:24,482
SO WHAT DO WE GOT?

596
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:28,018
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE SECURITY GUARD WAS DOING OUT HERE.

597
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,187
ANY IDEAS
AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS?

598
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,723
THAT'S JUST IT-- I DON'T THINK THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT.

599
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:33,891
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

600
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:36,727
I MEAN,
JUDGING FROM THE NECK WOUNDS ON THE DRIVER,

601
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:39,163
HE WAS STABBED AND MURDERED
BEFORE THE CAR EVEN CRASHED.

602
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:40,998
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

603
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,867
SO WE'VE GOT TO ASSUME
THAT OUR SUSPECT

604
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,770
AND THE SECURITY GUARD WERE BOTH IN
THE CAR WHEN THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED.

605
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:48,172
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
THEY HITCHED A RIDE OR SOMETHING?

606
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:51,208
SHERIFF, THE K9 UNIT
JUST PICKED UP A SCENT

607
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,943
JUST BELOW THE TREE LINE.

608
00:56:52,977 --> 00:56:54,512
SOMEBODY'S ALIVE
OUT THERE.

609
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,080
LET'S FIND OUT
WHO IT IS.

610
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,982
DONNY.
DONNY, COME HERE.

611
00:56:58,015 --> 00:56:59,884
YEAH?

612
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,720
- I NEED YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR.
- SURE.

613
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,656
- YOU KNOW WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

614
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:07,992
I WANT YOU TO GO
TO MY HOUSE.

615
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:10,661
BUT DON'T YOU THINK I SHOULD HELP OUT WITH THE SEARCH PARTY?

616
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:12,797
I KNOW.
I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE.

617
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,699
OKAY.

618
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:18,068
- DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT--
- I'M NOT SURE.

619
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,204
I JUST WANT YOU THERE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS, OKAY?

620
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,573
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

621
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:25,476
HEY, DONNY.
KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

622
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,712
- I DON'T WANT TO UPSET MY WIFE.
- OH, OKAY.

623
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,146
JUST HANG OUT BY THE END
OF THE DRIVEWAY.

624
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,815
- I'LL HEAD THERE RIGHT NOW.
- THANKS, DON.

625
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,116
SURE.

626
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:35,452
(Dog barking)

627
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:44,061
* Please be mine

628
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:47,565
* Be mine

629
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:50,635
* Please be mine
this time *

630
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:52,570
* This time...

631
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,271
(phone ringing)

632
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,843
* Please be mine

633
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,812
* Please please
be mine *

634
00:58:01,846 --> 00:58:05,149
* Please be mine
for all time *

635
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:07,752
* For all time

636
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,689
* There's so much

637
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:16,594
* I want to say to you...

638
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,632
Dispatcher: All units,
we have reports of an unidentified

639
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,267
911 call
at Simpson's Garage,

640
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,570
4212 Highway 10,
code 3.

641
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,504
Available units,
please respond.

642
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,559
(Branch snaps)

643
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,965
(footsteps)

644
00:58:56,934 --> 00:58:58,769
OH, LORD.

645
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:46,984
OH.

646
01:00:11,742 --> 01:00:13,043
(Twig snaps)

647
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,976
OH NO.

648
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:57,421
- (Beeping)
- (soft music playing)

649
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:11,168
SARA, WILL YOU SHUT
THAT THING OFF?

650
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:16,473
* For once in my life...

651
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,043
(beeping continues)

652
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:24,448
* I believe,
without a doubt *

653
01:01:24,481 --> 01:01:28,118
* That we could

654
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:31,488
* Just discover

655
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:35,793
* What true love

656
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:39,463
* Is really about

657
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:43,333
* Time after time,
girl... *

658
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,470
- IT'S MY DAD.
- (Beeps)

659
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:49,940
* So whenever
you need me *

660
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:54,812
* I'll be...

661
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,815
- (beeps)
- * I'll be yours

662
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:00,785
- * For the rest of my life... *
- Pat: Hey, Sara...

663
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:03,320
HEY! HEY.

664
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:07,091
* Always, I'll be...

665
01:02:07,124 --> 01:02:09,960
Pat: We have a police situation.
I don't know where you are,

666
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,962
but I need you to pack up and get out of there right away.

667
01:02:11,996 --> 01:02:14,431
Get back to the house
or go back to Veronica's.

668
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,834
Call me as soon as
you get this, all right?

669
01:02:16,867 --> 01:02:18,435
I love you.

670
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:24,108
* Remember
I'll be by your side *

671
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:27,511
* For now I

672
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:31,115
* Make this promise

673
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:34,852
* Through good and bad

674
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:38,022
* I'll be true

675
01:02:38,055 --> 01:02:42,226
* There's only

676
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,329
* One reason to live

677
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:50,134
* And that only

678
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,403
* Reason is you

679
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:56,540
* My heart and soul

680
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:59,977
* Belong to you, girl

681
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:03,547
* You can count on me

682
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:08,285
* I'll give
my life for you *

683
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,822
* I'll be yours

684
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:14,024
* For the rest
of my life *

685
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:16,026
* Rest of my life

686
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,163
* For always

687
01:03:19,196 --> 01:03:22,366
* I'll be by your side

688
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:25,069
* I'll be...

689
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:40,217
(police radio chatter)

690
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:18,122
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

691
01:04:18,155 --> 01:04:19,890
(Chuckles)

692
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,063
- Gary: HEY!
- WHAT WAS THAT?

693
01:04:59,096 --> 01:05:00,464
WHAT?

694
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,667
COME ON, SARA,
IT WAS PROBABLY JUST--

695
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:06,503
- Gary: HEY!
- WHAT THE FUCK?

696
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,641
- Greg: PAUL?
- YEAH?

697
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,510
Greg:
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

698
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,579
ARE YOU GUYS
FUCKING AROUND?

699
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:18,148
- Greg: NO, SOMEBODY'S--
- Gary: HEY!

700
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:21,085
SHIT.
STAY IN HERE.

701
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:25,189
THIS BETTER BE
A FUCKING JOKE.

702
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,996
WHERE'S THE FLASHLIGHT?

703
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:34,498
- VERONICA?
- Veronica: OVER HERE.

704
01:05:36,133 --> 01:05:38,268
Greg: I THINK IT'S OVER IN THAT BAG.

705
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,607

A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU TONIGHT, GARY.

769
01:11:29,719 --> 01:11:31,855
WHERE'S KURT?

01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:18,402
WHAT ABOUT GARY?

782
01:12:19,736 --> 01:12:23,607
HE'S PRETTY BEAT UP,
BUT HE'S ALIVE.

783
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:26,676
WELL, TALK TO HIM
AND FIND OUT WHAT HE KNOWS.

784
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,812
YOU'VE GOT IT.

785
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,648
- IS THAT KURT?
- Send the girls up to the house right away.

786
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,583
And in the meantime,
keep your eyes open.

787

800
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:28,037
IT'S YOUR FATHER.

801
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,741
- Pat!
- HEY, HONEY. ARE THE GIRLS WITH YOU?

802
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:35,044

805
01:13:41,551 --> 01:13:43,520
FIRST OF ALL, DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

806
01:13:43,553 --> 01:13:46,189
(Whispering) DON'T TELL ME EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

807
01:13:46,222 --> 01:13:48,925
KURT'S OUT THERE.
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

808
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,193
HE ALMOST KILLED SARA.

809
01:13:50,226 --> 01:13:52,662
WE'LL FIND HIM.
JUST KEEP THE GIRLS CALM.

810
01:13:52,696 --> 01:13:54,664
WE KNOW WHERE KURT IS
AND WE'RE MOVING...

811
01:13:54,698 --> 01:13:56,700
(static crackling)

812
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:00,103
HONEY? PAT?

813
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:02,038

817
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:14,651
DRINK THIS.

818
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,557
IT'S KURT, ISN'T IT?

819
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:22,025
Jolene: WHAT?

820
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:24,961
I HEARD DONNY.

821
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:27,230
HE SAID KURT'S
THE ONE DOING THIS.

822
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,132
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

823
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:33,202
YES, IT'S TRUE.

824
01:14:33,236 --> 01:14:34,938
HE KILLED THEM.

825
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,641
MY FUCKING PSYCHO
BROTHER KILLED PAUL.

826
01:14:37,674 --> 01:14:39,843
OH, HOW COULD
DAD LET THIS HAPPEN?

827
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:41,845
YOUR DAD IS DOING
EVERYTHING HE CAN.

828
01:14:41,878 --> 01:14:44,080
THIS IS NOT
HIS FAULT.

829
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:46,850
WHAT WERE YOU DOING UP IN THOSE WOODS IN THE FIRST PLACE?

830
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:49,252
NOTHING. WE WERE--
WE WERE JUST--

831
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:52,221
JUST WHAT?
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO THE MOVIES.

832
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:55,525
JOLENE, I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

833
01:14:55,559 --> 01:14:57,927
- YOU LIED TO ME!
- IT'S-- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

834
01:14:57,961 --> 01:14:59,629
YOU ALMOST
GOT KILLED TONIGHT.

835
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:01,531
YOU CALL THAT
NO BIG DEAL?

836
01:15:01,565 --> 01:15:02,966
YOU DON'T GET IT.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

837
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,968
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO LET KURT GET OUT.

838
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,736
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

839
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:11,007
I AM SO TIRED OF YOUR LIES AND YOUR EXCUSES.

840
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,543
EVERYTHING IS
SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT.

841
01:15:13,577 --> 01:15:16,279
- NOTHING'S YOUR FAULT EVER.
- GIVE ME A BREAK! JESUS!

842
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:18,281
A BREAK?

843
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:20,283
OH, I'M SORRY.
HAVEN'T YOU HAD ENOUGH BREAKS?

844
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:22,619
NOT WITH YOU AROUND.

845
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:29,292
NO MATTER WHAT I SAY...

846
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:32,829
YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME.

847
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,931
YOU LET VERONICA

848
01:15:34,964 --> 01:15:37,967
TALK YOU INTO GOING
UP INTO THE WOODS

849
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:40,637
WITH THOSE BOYS
DOING WHO KNOWS WHAT.

850
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:42,872
- AND NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.
- THAT IS-- THAT IS NOT FAIR!

851
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:44,941

852
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,083
- WHO IS IT?

853
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:57,053
Gary:
IT'S ME.

854
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,656
THAT'S GARY,
THE GUY WHO HELPED US.

855
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:02,125
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, LET HIM IN.

856
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:04,260
PLEASE.

857
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,062
- (Door opens)
- Jolene: OH, JESUS.

858
01:16:06,095 --> 01:16:09,565
- (Grunts)
- WHAT HAPPENED?

859
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,776
- SARA, GO GET ME SOME WET TOWELS.
- YEAH?

860
01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:21,945
- Sara: OKAY.
- GET THE FIRST-AID KIT FROM THE BATHROOM TOO.

861
01:16:21,978 --> 01:16:23,980
Sara:
SURE.

862
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:26,816
OKAY.

863
01:16:28,818 --> 01:16:31,187
SO I WANT YOU
TO APPLY SOME PRESSURE.

864
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:33,657
- THAT SHOULD HELP STOP THE BLEEDING.
- ALL RIGHT.

865
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,058
- YOU GOT IT?
- YEAH.

866
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,793
- (Moans)
- SORRY.

867
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:38,928
I'M GONNA TRY TO REACH

872
01:17:38,722 --> 01:17:40,356
THANK YOU.

873
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:42,325
YOU'RE WELCOME.

874
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,063
I GUESS I SHOULD BE
THE ONE THANKING YOU.

875
01:17:48,765 --> 01:17:51,300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD'VE DONE IF YOU HADN'T HELPED US.

876

I'M SORRY.

880
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,323
IT'S OKAY.

881

IT'S JUST KIND OF CREEPY,
YOU KNOW?

882
01:18:18,494 --> 01:18:20,629
I BARELY
EVEN REMEMBER HIM.

883
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,702
ONE DAY
IT JUST HAPPENED.

884
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:31,841
IT WAS
MY FIFTH BIRTHDAY.

885
01:18:34,978 --> 01:18:37,781
THEY TOOK HIM AWAY
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

886
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:44,387
YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN I DO.

887

YEAH. A LITTLE.

888
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:57,300
I GREW UP HEARING
STORIES ABOUT HIM.

889
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,070
I GET SO MUCH CRAP.

890
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:04,107
"THE SISTER OF THAT PSYCHO KID WHO KILLED HIS MOM."

891
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,549
AFTER A WHILE, PEOPLE KIND
OF FORGOT ABOUT HIM.

892
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,019
SO DID I.

893
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,025
I FIGURED I'D NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

894
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:25,428
AT LEAST
I HOPED I WOULDN'T.

895
01:19:26,896 --> 01:19:28,998
(Water patters)

896
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:38,942

- KURT?
- SHUT UP!

1056
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:47,022
KURT! NO!

1057
01:38:47,055 --> 01:38:48,323
(Scissors thud)

1058
01:39:43,678 --> 01:39:45,647
- (groans)
- (Sara screams)

1059
01:40:13,641 --> 01:40:15,343
DADDY?

1060
01:40:16,611 --> 01:40:18,313
IT'S OVER, KURT.

1061
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:20,548
IT'S OVER.

1062
01:40:22,617 --> 01:40:25,187
YOU DID THIS TO ME!

1063
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:32,127
(Grunts)

1064
01:40:38,566 --> 01:40:40,668
Pat's voice:
IT'S OKAY.

1065
01:40:40,702 --> 01:40:43,371
IT'S OKAY.

1066
01:40:43,405 --> 01:40:46,608
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

1067
01:40:46,641 --> 01:40:48,443
IT'S OKAY.

1068
01:40:48,476 --> 01:40:51,446
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

1069
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:04,526
- IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
- (Kurt gasping)

1070
01:41:04,559 --> 01:41:06,294
IT'S OKAY.

1071
01:41:13,635 --> 01:41:17,305
(Panting)

1072
01:41:17,339 --> 01:41:19,307
NOW REMEMBER, KURT,

1073
01:41:19,341 --> 01:41:22,477
DON'T TELL
ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

1074
01:41:24,412 --> 01:41:26,481
THIS IS
OUR LITTLE SECRET.

1075
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:29,784
NOT A WORD.

1076
01:41:29,817 --> 01:41:33,121
Mother: YOU'D BETTER STILL BE IN YOUR ROOM WHEN I GET UP THERE.

1077
01:41:34,556 --> 01:41:36,224
KURT?

1078
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:39,327
Pat: BETTER PULL YOUR PANTS UP.

1079
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:42,430
SIT THERE
AND BE A GOOD BOY.

1080
01:41:59,781 --> 01:42:01,449
KURT?

1081
01:42:03,218 --> 01:42:05,353
I KNOW YOU'RE
PROBABLY MAD AT MOMMY.

1082
01:42:05,387 --> 01:42:07,589
BUT YOU KNOW WHY I HAD TO BRING YOU UP HERE, RIGHT?

1083
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:12,227
IT WAS NOT VERY NICE,
WHAT YOU DID TO SARA.

1084
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,629
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

1085
01:42:16,198 --> 01:42:18,166
HONEY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

1086
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:20,568
KURT, LOOK AT ME.

1087
01:42:22,404 --> 01:42:24,272
KURT, WHAT'S WRONG?

1088
01:42:26,408 --> 01:42:27,909
(Bat thuds)

1089
01:42:27,942 --> 01:42:31,279
Pat: OH, KURT,
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

1090
01:42:36,451 --> 01:42:38,253
DADDY.

1091
01:42:38,286 --> 01:42:39,821
WHAT...

1092
01:42:53,968 --> 01:42:55,737
(siren blaring)

1093
01:43:01,609 --> 01:43:04,479
Pat: SO HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

1094
01:43:06,481 --> 01:43:08,850
Dr.
Engle: AT SOME POINT HE MUST'VE ATTACKED THE GUARDS.

1095
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:12,720
Pat: IT'S KURT,
HE'S ESCAPED.

1096
01:43:14,756 --> 01:43:16,358
Dr. Engle:
KURT IS CONFUSED.

1097
01:43:18,593 --> 01:43:21,629
HIS SENSE OF REALITY
IS COMPLETELY DISTORTED.

1098
01:43:23,798 --> 01:43:25,600
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE IS ANYMORE.

1099
01:43:26,668 --> 01:43:28,636
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

1100
01:43:28,670 --> 01:43:30,305
WHERE HIS OWN
LIFE STOPS

1101
01:43:30,338 --> 01:43:32,574
AND WHERE THE REST
OF THE WORLD BEGINS.

1102
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:34,842
Medic #1: OKAY, GUYS,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

1103
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:37,011
- (Heart monitor beeping)
- Medic #2: GUNSHOT WOUND.

1104
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:39,347
(Grunts)

1105
01:43:41,349 --> 01:43:43,418
- Medic #1: ALL RIGHT, DOES HE HAVE A PULSE?
- Medic #2: NO PULSE.

1106
01:43:43,451 --> 01:43:46,254
Medic #1: NO SIGN OF SINUS RHYTHM.
WE'RE GONNA START COMPRESSIONS.

1107
01:43:50,925 --> 01:43:52,760
- DADDY?
- (Flatlining)

1108
01:43:52,794 --> 01:43:54,962
- Medic #1: CHARGE 200.
- Medic #2: 200 CHARGING.

1109
01:43:54,996 --> 01:43:57,265
- Medic #1: CLEAR!
- (Defibrillator sparks)

1110
01:43:57,299 --> 01:43:59,334
IT'S OVER, KURT.

1111
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:01,336
IT'S OVER.

1112
01:44:01,369 --> 01:44:03,771
YOU DID THIS TO ME.
(Yells)

1113
01:44:03,805 --> 01:44:05,873
- (gunshot)
- (flatlining)

1114
01:44:05,907 --> 01:44:07,475
Medic #1: OKAY,
LET'S GET 200 OF EPI--

1115
01:44:07,509 --> 01:44:08,876
Medic #2: GOT IT.
HE'S NOT BREATHING.

1116
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:10,144
Medic #1:
ALL RIGHT, CHARGE 300.

1117
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:12,780
- Medic #2: 300 CHARGING.
- Medic #1: TRY IT AGAIN.

1118
01:44:12,814 --> 01:44:14,816
- CLEAR!
- (Defibrillator sparks)

1119
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,386
(flatlining)

1120
01:45:17,379 --> 01:45:19,381
Dr.
Engel: YOUR SON APPEARS TO BE SUFFERING

1121
01:45:19,414 --> 01:45:23,518
FROM A RARE FORM OF DISSOCIATIVE PERSONALITY DISORDER.

1122
01:45:25,453 --> 01:45:28,790
KURT IS CONFUSED.

1123
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,526
HE'S LOST HIS OWN
SENSE OF IDENTITY.

1124
01:45:32,894 --> 01:45:35,597
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO HE IS ANYMORE.

1125
01:45:37,399 --> 01:45:40,535
HIS SENSE OF REALITY IS
COMPLETELY DISTORTED.

1126
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:46,541
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
WHERE HIS OWN LIFE STOPS

1127
01:45:46,574 --> 01:45:48,543
AND WHERE THE REST
OF THE WORLD BEGINS.

1128
01:45:50,478 --> 01:45:52,714
IT'S AS THOUGH
HIS MIND WERE--

1129
01:45:52,747 --> 01:45:54,982
WERE TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE--

1130
01:45:55,016 --> 01:45:57,452
WERE TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE--

1131
01:45:57,485 --> 01:45:59,387
TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER PLACE.

1132
01:46:03,157 --> 01:46:05,126
Veronica: WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH YOUR BROTHER?

1133
01:46:05,159 --> 01:46:08,430
Jolene: KURT'S OUT THERE.
PEOPLE ARE DEAD.

1134
01:46:08,463 --> 01:46:11,633
Denton:
KURT? NOT KURT BAKER?

1135
01:46:11,666 --> 01:46:14,135
Paul:
I KNOW HE'S YOUR BROTHER,

1136
01:46:14,168 --> 01:46:16,370
BUT IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

1137
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:19,407
Sam:
I DIDN'T SEE ANYONE.

1138
01:46:19,441 --> 01:46:21,443
YOU WERE ALONE.

1139
01:46:21,476 --> 01:46:23,778
Sara: I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

1140
01:46:26,648 --> 01:46:28,650
I KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

1141
01:46:29,717 --> 01:46:32,119
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

1142
01:46:32,153 --> 01:46:34,922
IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT.

1143
01:47:23,638 --> 01:47:25,673
- HEY, I'M HOME.
- HI, HONEY.

1144
01:47:25,707 --> 01:47:27,208
HEY, HONEY.
HEY, SARA.

1145
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:29,043
HI, DAD.

1146
01:47:31,613 --> 01:47:33,648
- IS HE UPSTAIRS?
- MM-HMM.

1147
01:48:16,157 --> 01:48:18,192
(Instrumental music playing)
