1
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,900
Sue, you know l like you.

2
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,000
How long have you been
in this building?

3
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
12 years.

4
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
That long.

5
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,000
And we never had a
problem, right?

6
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,900
But you owe me 3 months
rent now.

7
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
You pay me 400 dollars
a month,

8
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,100
l could be renting it out
for 7, maybe 8.

9
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
l think it´s more than fair,
isn´t it?

10
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,600
Yes, it´s extremely fair,
Stanley.

11
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,300
l mean, l don´t care, but we´ve
got to get paid.

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,600
lt´s still a business,
not a charity.

13
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,200
Yes. l´ll get you the money by
Friday, Stanley, l promise.

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Get it to me by the end of the
month. That´s more than 2 weeks.

15
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,100
Otherwise, l can´t carry you
anymore.

16
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,000
l appreciate that.

17
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,600
l´m familiar with all types of
legal paperwork,

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,300
and even though l have
no formal degree in law,

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
l can do any type of contract
and even file suits.

20
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,800
l have all the secreterial skills
that l think you would require

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,900
and l feel quite qualified
for the job.

22
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,400
Here´s my resume and
letter of recommendation.

23
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,200
You´ve taken Psychology
and Modern Dance.

24
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,900
Well, l have a BA in Psychology
from Columbia University.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,100
l did take a few courses
in Modern Dance, but...

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,700
We´ll be in touch.

27
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,600
Thank you. My primary
background is law, though.

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,900
l worked for 12 years
for a law firm.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, thank you very much.

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,100
What´s a beautiful young woman
like you doing by herself

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
on a Sunday morning?

32
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Crossword puzzle.

33
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,300
My name is Willie.

34
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,000
Hello, Willie.

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,500
Will you show me your breasts?

36
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,200
Excuse me?

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,400
l´d love to see your breasts.

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, it´ll cost you.

39
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,000
How much?

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,100
10 bucks.

41
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,600
l can´t afford it.

42
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,400
Well, that´s the going rate, even
with a senior citizens discount.

43
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:14,300
What´s a European capital,
6 letters, starts with a ´P´?

44
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:25,500
Prague. Or Paris with 2 ´R´s.

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,300
l think Prague works better.

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,300
Where are you going?

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,700
l´m going to get a coffee.

48
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,400
Would you get me a
Strawberry Mystic?

49
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
A Mystic?

50
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,700
Yeah, strawberry flavor. lt´s
75 cents. l´ll pay you back.

51
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
No, no.

52
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,600
Thank you.

53
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Thank you.

54
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,700
Excuse me. You dropped a dollar.

55
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,400
Oh, thank you.

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,700
No problem.

57
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,600
You want a cigarette?

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,800
No, thank you.

59
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,200
You´re smart.

60
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,800
How can you tell? l mean,
we´ve only just met.

61
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,600
You don´t smoke.

62
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,800
Well, that doesn´t make
me smart.

63
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,500
lt just means l never
got in the habit.

64
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
That´s what l mean,
you´re smart.

65
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,700
Anything interesting in there?

66
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,200
Where?

67
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,100
The paper?

68
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,600
Oh, no, the usual crap.

69
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,800
Why do you read it?

70
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
Goes well with cigarettes
and coffee.

71
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,000
There you are.

72
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,000
Here, keep the change.

73
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,300
Well, it was nice to
speak to you.

74
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,300
Sue.

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Ben.

76
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,800
Nice meeting you Ben. Would be
nice to chat some more.

77
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,100
Yeah well, you have a good day .

78
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,500
Do you live around here?

79
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,000
No, l live in Minnesota.

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,500
Minnesota?

81
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,900
That´s out in the Midwest.

82
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,100
Yeah, l know where
Minnesota is.

83
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,600
l´m sorry. New York brings out
the mean streak in me.

84
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,500
lt was nice meeting you.

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Wait a sec, wait! Do you
have a pen?

86
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Take it! You can throw
it out if you want.

87
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,500
l´ll give you a call, Sue.

88
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,600
ls everything all right?

89
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,700
Yeah, l´ll take some more
coffee, if you don´t mind.

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,000
All right.

91
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,300
Hey Eddie, listen to this.

92
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,700
The other night when
l was working,

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
there´s this guy sitting
in the back,

94
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,200
and he´s like, ´´hey babe,
we need some more coffee. ´´

95
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,200
and l´m like,
l don´t like it,

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,000
´cause l´m not his babe,
l´m not his anything.

97
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,800
But l go back there, start
pouring the coffee.

98
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,200
The next thing l know ,
he´s got his hand on my ass,

99
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,200
so l say to him...

100
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Thank you.

101
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,600
So, l go to take some
other orders,

102
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,500
Then, maybe 10 minutes later,
same bozo wants a refill,

103
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
So, l´m thinking, he´s
learned his lesson.

104
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,700
So, l go back there.

105
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,500
Now his cup of coffee is up
against the wall,

106
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,300
all the way on the other
side of the table,

107
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,200
so l have to reach for it
to pour the coffee,

108
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
and as l´m reaching to
pour the coffee,

109
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,900
l can feel his hand smack up
between my legs,

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
l can feel him fingering
my pussy.

111
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,800
l´m like, ´´what? You think
just because l work

112
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
in an all-night diner, you can
just finger my pussy

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,200
any time you feel like it?´´

114
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,100
l fucking whacked him
right on his head.

115
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,900
He was on the floor on
his ass, it was beautiful.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,600
´Cause, Eddie, baby, you´re
the only one for me.

117
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,700
You dress like a slut,
you talk like a slut,

118
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
what the hell do
you expect?

119
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,800
That´s all you have to
say to me

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,600
after everything l go through?
You changed, Eddie.

121
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,500
Where the hell are you going?

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,700
Good morning, l´m calling
in reference

123
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,100
to your ad in the ´´T imes. ´´

124
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,500
´´Medium-sized midtown legal
firm seeks office manager. ´´

125
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Already? Yikes! Early bird
does get the worm, huh?

126
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,600
Thank you very much.

127
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you think?

128
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,400
Oh, l quite like it.
lt´s complicated, but...

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,900
really quite simple.
l think l like it.

130
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Yeah, l see what you mean.

131
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,500
These group shows are
so difficult.

132
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,000
They must be very difficult
to organize, l think.

133
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,600
Yes, certainly for
the curator...

134
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh yes, for him especially.
Of course, yes.

135
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,700
l think, they did a good job,
l think. Don´t you?

136
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,700
Yeah, it´s curiously
coherent.

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
Oh, excuse me.

138
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,900
There you are Agnes.
Hello. Nice to see you.

139
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,100
Yeah, sure, go with Agnes.
See what l care.

140
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,400
lt´s a fucked up world,
if you ask me.

141
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,300
l didn´t ask you,
but you´re correct.

142
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
Men, all they wanna do is
jerk off in your face

143
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,600
and make you swallow
their cum.

144
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,600
Well, fuck them and fuck
their mothers.

145
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,000
lt´s true. You want a beer?

146
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Thank you. Why not?

147
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,200
How´s everything?

148
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,200
Well, a couple of days ago my
grandmother died from pneumonia.

149
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,600
That sucks.

150
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,700
Well, that´s New York for you.
What are you gonna do?

151
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,900
Listen, you wanna go get
a cup of coffee?

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
lf l don´t have cof fee
first thing in the morning,

153
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,000
l just can´t do anything.
Especially in the winter.

154
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,000
ln the summer,
l don´t care.

155
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah, all right. But on
one condition.

156
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,600
What?

157
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,000
We go Dutch.

158
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,400
Fine by me.

159
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,600
l can´t stand it when somebody
buys you a coffee and

160
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,200
then they think they own you.

161
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,700
But this once, l´ll invite you.

162
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,400
lt´s fine, ´cause l don´t
like to pay.

163
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,900
Okay, cool.

164
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,400
Besides, this cold weather
makes my tits hurt.

165
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,800
Me too.

166
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,900
Hey, gringo! Can we get
some drinks here?

167
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
How can l help you, ladies?

168
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,400
l´ll have a double whisky in
a tall glass with some ice.

169
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,900
What kind of whisky?

170
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,900
´´Wild Turkey. ´´

171
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
How about you?

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
l´ll have a Johnnie Walker
on the rocks.

173
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,800
l love to drink in the morning.

174
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,600
As opposed to the rest
of the day?

175
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,200
As opposed to nothing.

176
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
So, why did you start talking
to me in the street?

177
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,800
You started talking to me.

178
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,800
Really?

179
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
So, what do you do?

180
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
l rob banks and video stores.

181
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Anything to eat?

182
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, l´ll have salad and
some bread.

183
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
How about you, ma´am?

184
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,000
Just go make the salad
and bring me back

185
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
a double whisky in
like 5 minutes.

186
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,500
Why video stores?

187
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,400
´Cause they´ve always
got cash.

188
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,200
Besides, l can pick up a
couple of videos,

189
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,200
watch them at home and then
l take them out

190
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
on Canal Street, sell them
for 5 bucks a pop.

191
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,800
So what do you do?

192
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,200
l´m between jobs at the moment.

193
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,100
l used to be a dental
assistant.

194
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
But then l lost my job when
Clinton got re-elected.

195
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,900
What does Clinton
getting re-elected

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
have to do with your work?

197
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,600
Nothing. But, you know,
that´s when it happened.

198
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,000
But l don´t care, cause people
stink from the mouth.

199
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,500
l haven´t had a cavity
in years.

200
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,300
As far as teeth are concerned,
l´ve been very fortunate.

201
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,800
l don´t ever go to doctors. lf l´m
in pain, l just drink it away.

202
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,900
l just lost my apartment and
l don´t even care, it´s a relief.

203
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,600
That´ll be 22 dollars
and 15 cents.

204
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
No, that´s all right. l´ll take
care of it.

205
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,500
Now, listen up, Billie-Joe,
or whatever your name is,

206
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,700
l got money, but the thing is,
do you really want me to pay?

207
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
No, no, l was gonna
invite you.

208
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,000
Folks like you are always
welcome.

209
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,600
That´s what l thought!
So, why don´t you go

210
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,200
to the cash register,
get me 50 bucks

211
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,400
and we´ll be on our way.

212
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,500
Thank you for coming.

213
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,300
No, thank you,
for having us.

214
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Thanks for breakfast.

215
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,400
l got to get going,
l´ll see you later.

216
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,600
lt was my pleasure.

217
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,300
l live right here if you
wanna come up.

218
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,600
No, l´ve got things l gotta
take care of,

219
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,600
so l´ll see you later.

220
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,800
Okay. l live on the top floor,
end of the hall.

221
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,600
l´ll have the money in a week.

222
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,200
You´ve never had any problem
with me, l promise. Okay?

223
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,300
Okay.

224
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Hello, Mom?

225
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Mom, l miss you.

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Mom, how are you?
Mom, don´t hang up.

227
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
Mom, please don´t hang up.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,800
How´re you doing?

229
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,000
l´ll have a chocolate donut.

230
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,000
Something else?

231
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,500
Yeah, a cup of coffee.

232
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,400
Buck fifty.

233
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,000
Kind of empty tonight.

234
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,600
lt´s getting late.

235
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,000
Keep the change.

236
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,600
No, thanks.

237
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
l´m too worked up to sleep.

238
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,700
Well, l´m closing soon.

239
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Why? What time is it?

240
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,700
Getting late. Midnight.

241
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,300
l didn´t know it´s that late.

242
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,500
You wanna go have a drink?

243
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,600
No, thanks, l gotta get
back to Brooklyn.

244
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,000
Right, yeah.

245
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,700
l don´t know what l
was thinking.

246
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,200
l gotta get up early, too.

247
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,600
Thanks.

248
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,500
You´re sure about this?

249
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,100
Yeah. lt´ll be nice to have
some company

250
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,800
and someone to help
with the rent.

251
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,300
Yeah, we´ll have fun. You got
anything to drink?

252
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,100
Sure, yeah.

253
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Unfortunately, when
my boss died,

254
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,400
l didn´t get a reference at
the time, ´cause l thought

255
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,600
l was gonna go into a
different field, but l´m sure

256
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
l can get a reference from
one of his partners.

257
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,300
l was the boss´s right hand man,
so to speak, for a long time.

258
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,300
Then, when he died, the office
shut down very suddenly.

259
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,600
Hi.

260
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Hi.

261
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,800
l was thinking that maybe
you´d like to come over

262
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,300
and have a good time with
me and my girlfriend.

263
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,500
You mean like, ´´good time´´
good time? Or...

264
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,800
Yeah, a good time.

265
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,800
Sure, yeah, why not. l mean,
l´m not busy in the afternoon,

266
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,600
l don´t have anything to do.

267
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,600
l mean, in the evening
l get busy, but...

268
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,400
We were there 3 days,
you know,

269
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
when finally the helicopter
came to rescue me,

270
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,400
you know, gets cold up
in the mountains there.

271
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,800
That´s why they call me like
the lndiana Jones of New York.

272
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Take off your coat.

273
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,500
lt´s cozy.

274
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,900
So, where´s your friend?
lsn´t there supposed to be

275
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,100
a third party to this party?

276
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,300
Don´t worry about it,
just relax.

277
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,300
Was that your friend?

278
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Yeah.

279
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,900
Listen, what´s your name?

280
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Lola.

281
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,500
Lola. Okay, Lola? Fine!
Your friend? l can´t do it.

282
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,600
Get rid of her or something.
l mean, l can´t...

283
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,300
Okay, all right.
Just don´t get crazy.

284
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Don´t... crazy? Listen,
you don´t even know

285
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,600
about crazy, okay? l was
shot at, many times.

286
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,400
l´ve fucking killed people for
looking at me sideways.

287
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,800
l´d rather get shot at
than have to deal

288
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,200
with that, all right?
Believe me.

289
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,800
Okay.

290
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,200
Just can we do something
about that?

291
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,300
Yeah

292
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Sue, something came up. l can
explain it to you later, but...

293
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
Listen, that´s okay, no, no,
forget what l said, cancel,

294
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,100
l was kidding you. Don´t you
know when l´m kidding?

295
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,200
Yeah, we got 7-Up, beer.

296
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,200
Save the 7-Up in case your
grandmother ever comes to visit.

297
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,700
Hi. There was a girl who
came out of there before,

298
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,000
that wasn´t you, was it?

299
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,600
Yeah.

300
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,000
You´re really beautiful.

301
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,100
But really old.

302
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
No, not at all.

303
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,300
My god, your skin is so soft.

304
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,800
Just took a bath.

305
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,600
So what, am l interrupting
something now?

306
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
No.

307
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,500
Here´s your beer.

308
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,400
Forget the beer.

309
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,000
Hey, Sue! What´s the matter?

310
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,000
Sue!

311
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,800
What did you say to her?

312
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,800
l kissed her.

313
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,700
One... two... you ain´t got

314
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,800
Hi, gorgeous day, isn´t it?

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
How old is she?

317
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,600
Oh, sorry. How old is he?

318
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,400

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,300
Oh. lt´s a gorgeous little

You´re a gorgeous little

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,000
He´s got beautiful eyes.

322
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,800
Come on, Max, you

Well, fuck you!

326
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,500
l´m sorry, Lola.

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
l´ll see you around.

328
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,600
What are you gonna bet on?

329
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,000
The double.

330
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,000
Sounds good to me.
Do you want another?

331
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,800
Yeah.

332
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,600
Okay.

Okay.

335
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,200
Do you need any
help in here?

336
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,200
No, we´re not hiring
right now.

337
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,600
Are you the owner?

338
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,400
l´m his daughter.

339
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,900
Oh, well, in that case,
l´ll have a Johnnie Walker.

340
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,500
On the rocks?

341
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,600
Yeah.

Yeah.

344
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,100
Have you ever bartended?

345
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,300
Oh yeah, l´ve done
a lot of things.

346
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,800
Like what?

347
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,700
Waitressing, modelling. l ran a
law office for 12 years.

348
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
There´s a lot of law
offices in town.

349
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,200
Yeah, but nobody´s hiring.

350
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,400
l just need a job. l got
sick of it, anyway.

351
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,200
Can´t live on unemployment
forever.

352
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,200
Not in New York fucking City.

353
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
l know what you mean.

354
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Do you like this job?

355
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,700
l don´t mind it. l´m working
my way through my Ph. D.

356
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,500
Really? What are you
studying?

357
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,100
Clinical Psychology.

358
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,200
The way l´m going, l´m
gonna need your services

359
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,800
pretty badly in about
2 months.

360
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,400
l hope not. l won´t be done
for another 2 years.

361
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,100
Oh, no, by then you´ll have to
fish me out of the morgue.

362
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
How much do l owe you?

363
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,100
lt´s on the house.

364
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,400
Thank you.

365
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,400
Hi, Minnesota.

366
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,200
How´re you doing, Sue?

367
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,200
All right.

368
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,600
lmagine seeing you here.

369
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,300
Where have you been?

370
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,200
l´m glad to see you.

371
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:55,800
Really?

372
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,000
Yeah, l was thinking
about you.

373
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,600
Oh really?

374
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,400
l am!

375
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,700
Lost my number?

376
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,600
l didn´t lose your number.
l was busy.

377
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,800
God, you´re incredible.

378
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,800
ln what sense?

379
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,800
You´re so passionate.

380
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,900
l feel like a teenager.
Jesus Christ!

381
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,100
Well, it´s been a long time
since l made love

382
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,300
with somebody l
really liked.

383
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,900
Do you make love to people
you don´t like?

384
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,000
Oh, yeah.

385
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
So, what happened
to Minnesota?

386
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,200
Minnesota´s just
a home base.

387
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,800
l write for airline magazines
and travel a lot.

388
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,300
And the wife and children
in Minneapolis come

389
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,500
to the airport all teary-eyed to
greet you when you come home?

390
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,500
The wife is remarried and
lives in Connecticut.

391
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,300
There are no children.

392
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,800
No kidding?

393
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,000
No kidding.

394
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,200
´Cause, you know,
we already fucked,

395
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,400
so you don´t have
to lie to me now.

396
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:53,600
l wouldn´t lie to you, Sue.

397
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,900
Well... cream and sugar?

398
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,300
No. Just black.

399
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,900
So, tell me about
your work.

400
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,800
l told you, it´s just
this and that.

401
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,300
l travel to a place,
l do some research,

402
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,100
l get the atmosphere, write
about it. That´s it.

403
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,300
Sounds so simple.

404
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,300
No. Believe it or not,
l used to be a boxer.

405
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,500
That was simple.

406
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
l mean, l never thought
l could write.

407
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,600
l can´t even spell.

408
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,700
The trick is, not to be
redundant, to keep it fresh.

409
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,200
l guess the most important
thing is to make

410
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,900
a good impression
on the editor.

411
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Does that work?

412
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,100
l try.

413
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,500
l try to make everything a
little special, a little unique.

414
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,900
What about you?

415
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,300
Tell me about yourself.

416
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,700
Oh, nothing has happened
to me for years.

417
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,700
l go in and out of
the apartment,

418
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,400
l go up ten blocks,
down ten blocks,

419
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,900
l have sex with a lot of strangers
and l watch a lot of TV.

420
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,900
Your life is as interesting
as anyone´s.

421
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,800
Maybe more than most.

422
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,200
Why do you say that?

423
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,900
´Cause you´re yourself.

424
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,700
Because you choose.

425
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,500
So, l choose to be lonely?

426
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,800
Maybe.

427
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,500
Why?

428
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
l don´t know.

429
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,000
You never got married?

430
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,000
No. l have only accidental
people in my life, like you.

431
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,700
l´d hate to be thought of
as an accident.

432
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,600
Yeah, well...

433
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,900
l gotta get going. l got
a lot of work to do.

434
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,900
Yeah.

435
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
That´s why l came to New
York. To get something new.

436
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Me too.

437
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,200
Something new,
something exciting.

438
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,100
l´m addicted to the city.

439
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,400
Sometimes l think l´d be
happier any other place.

440
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,400
But where else could you find
this level of noise?

441
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,200
l´ll see you real soon, Sue.

442
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,700
No, you won´t.

443
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,300
Hi, Sven.

444
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Hello, Miss Sue.

445
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
How´re you doing?

446
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,200
Good.

447
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,400
How are you?

448
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,400
Okay.

449
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,200
Do you want some coffee or
something cold to drink?

450
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,400
Actually, coffee would be nice.

451
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,900
Do you want cream
and sugar? l forget.

452
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
Yeah, both.

453
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Okay.

454
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,700
Here. How´s it going?

455
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,000
Good.

456
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,400
Yeah?

457
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,700
Yeah.

458
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,000
lt´s gonna be fixed.

459
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,800
Oh gosh, you´re a
genious, Sven.

460
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,400
What would l do
without you?

461
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,700
l don´t know.

462
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
You should still get
yourself a new set.

463
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,200
Okay. l´ll ask Santa.

464
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,400
He´s a good guy to ask.

465
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,000
Yeah.

466
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,000
Hello? Okay.

467
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,800
You Miss Sue?

468
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,400
Me Su Yan Sin, who you?

469
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,400
Sign here.

470
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,800
Hello? Yes, they´re
beautiful.

471
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Jesus Christ!

472
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,600
Thank you.

473
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,000
Thank you.

474
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,700
Here´s to you.

475
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,200
So, you´re still trying to
impress your editor?

476
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,000
l´m still trying.

477
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,800
Flowers? Lunches?
Chocolate?

478
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,600
No, nothing like that.

479
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,700
You´ve been down to Mexico?

480
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,200
No. Why?

481
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,000
l had a job down there,
it was beautiful.

482
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,800
lt was fun. This place reminds
me of a place in Mexico.

483
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,700
l know something else fun.

484
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,800
What´s that? What are
you doing, Sue?

485
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,600
Getting comfortable.

486
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,900
Getting comfortable...

487
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You´re getting more
than comfortable.

488
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,100
That´s all right.

489
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,100
l like this dress.

490
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,900
You do?

491
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,600
Yeah, l do.

492
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
You wanna dance?

493
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,400
No, l´d like to take you down
to Mexico some time.

494
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,600
What are you gonna do?

495
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,700
Sue... stop.

496
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Sue... come on...

497
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,300
Sue, what are you doing?

498
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:19,300
You wanna dance?

499
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,300
Yeah.

500
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,100
You want me to dance?
You´re gonna regret it.

501
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,100
No.

502
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,800
You know why l wanna
dance with you?

503
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,200
l like to dance with you.

504
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,100
You still think l´m
an accident?

505
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Yeah, but a good accident.

506
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,200
No, seriously.

507
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,700
Atall, handsome wonderful
accident.

508
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,500
You really do think l´m an
accident, don´t you?

509
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,300
Well, there´s good accidents
and there´s bad accidents.

510
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,200
You´re a tall, handsome,
good-kisser accident.

511
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,500
How´s that?

512
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,800
You think l´m just in this
for the sex?

513
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,400
Nothing wrong with that.

514
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,000
Come on, Ben, don´t be
a baby. Come on!

515
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,600
Sue, you know what?

516
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,200
Stop, all right? Stop.

517
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,200
There, that´s for the drinks.
l don´t need this.

518
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,600
Ben. Come on!

519
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:55,200
Hello, yes, l´d like to speak
to one of your hotel guests.

520
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,500
His name is Ben.
He´s about

521
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,400
32 or 34, l don´t know,
something like that.

522
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,900
He´s tall, he´s very
handsome, he´s...

523
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,300
No, l´m afraid l don´t know
his last name, but can´t you...

524
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,000
Okay, great, thank you,
fuck you, too.

525
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,600
We must be neighbours.

526
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Yeah, l live down the street.

527
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,200
l´m Linda.

528
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,200
Sue.

529
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,800
Have you found a job yet?

530
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,000
No.

531
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
You´re quiet.

532
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,900
Yeah. l´m not that big
on conversation.

533
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,800
l only communicate
through sex.

534
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,200
Oh.

535
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh. l´m not gay or anything.

536
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,300
Well, let´s see...

537
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,500
Have you seen any
movies lately?

538
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,700
No, l don´t go to the movies much.

539
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Why not?

540
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,100
l don´t like to go alone and
it´s so expensive, you know .

541
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,900
You get the popcorn
and the soda.

542
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Yeah, you don´t want to go to
the movies without popcorn.

543
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,200
And that´s 15 bucks
easy and...

544
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,400
You know, there´s a lot
of stuff on TV.

545
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,000
Although l don´t want to
watch too much and become

546
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,700
one of those automated zombies,
you know, no brain...

547
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,400
You must have friends?

548
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,000
No.

549
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,700
What do you mean, no?

550
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Well, kind of lost touch,
you know.

551
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,500
Friends, family, kids. All go
their own ways, get jobs.

552
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,700
You´re not married?

553
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,300
No. l´ve resisted the
institution of marriage

554
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,000
and now it´s probably
too late,

555
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,800
and l´m too old and
set in my ways.

556
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,700
Nonsense.

557
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,500
Hello? Operator?

558
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,000
Could you connect me with
my mother in...

559
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,800
My mother, please.

560
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,500
What´s the number?

561
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,800
l can´t remember. lt´s some kind
of a facility in Seattle.

562
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,000
Portland. Portland. Sorry.

563
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,000
You´ll have to give me
the number.

564
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,300
You dial the area code and
then 5551212.

565
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,500
Operator?

566
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,600
Yes?

567
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,100
Don´t get off the line.
l just...

568
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,100
l just need somebody to
talk to for a minute.

569
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
You sound like a nice person.

570
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,700
Miss, we´re very busy
right now.

571
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, l´m sure, l just...

572
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,200
l´ll be all right in a minute.

573
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,000
l just need someone to
talk to for a minute.

574
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,000
l´ll be all right
in a minute.

575
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,200
Operator, are you
still there?

576
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,200
Yes.

577
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
Where are you located?

578
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,400
l just need to talk,
to calm down.

579
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,400
l´ll be all right
in a minute.

580
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
Sorry, we cannot give out
that information.

581
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,000
Why not?

582
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,400
For security reasons.

583
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,700
Oh, l see.

584
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,000
l have to get off
now, Miss. l´m sure,

585
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,900
lif you get the number,
somebody will help you.

586
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,300
l´m sorry. l just...

587
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,800
My mother has Alzheimer´s.

588
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,000
My mother has Alzheimer´s
and l haven´t been able

589
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,600
to have a conversation
with her in years.

590
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,300
Operator? Operator?

591
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,200
Yes?

592
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,200
My mother was very beautiful.

593
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,400
l´m sorry, Miss.

594
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,200
You´re a very kind person,
operator, very kind.

595
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,400
lt´s very surprising.

596
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,400
Why is it surprising?

597
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,600
l don´t know. l always
think that

598
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,400
operators are just sort of like
machines, you know.

599
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,600
Thank you very much
for your kindness.

600
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,800
l´d love to work with children.
l feel quite qualified.

601
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:17,100
l have a BA from Columbia
in Psychology.

602
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,200
When did you graduate?

603
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,100
A little more than
ten years ago,

604
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,700
but during that time
l feel that

605
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,200
l´ve learned a lot of
other things

606
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,600
just from life in the city
and living here

607
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,600
and people that l´ve met.

608
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,500
lt´s just that right after
l graduated

609
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,200
l didn´t feel like pursuing
social work right away.

610
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,900
So, l did some other things.

611
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,500
But now l feel very
interested in it

612
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,000
and l´d like to give it a try.

613
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Thank you very much.

614
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,200
lt´s quite all right.

615
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,300
Then what? What now?

616
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,300
Back home to New York.

617
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,600
Back to the same rut?

618
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,100
No! lt won´t be the same.

619
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,600
l´ve gone straight, honest.

620
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,400
Do you?

621
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,300
l came all the way across
the ocean for you.

622
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,700
Has it been on long?

623
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,400
About 5 minutes.

624
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,700
Thanks.

625
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,800
l told him l want to go
back to work.

626
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,500
He promised he´ll find
me something.

627
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,500
He wants me back.

628
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,500
That´s wonderful, Jack.

629
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,700
Things will be different
from now on.

630
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,100
Can l have some of
your popcorn?

631
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,400
Well, sure.

632
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,700
l can´t make it without you.

633
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:53,000
You don´t want to throw away
6 years just like that, do you.

634
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,700
You should have thought
lof that earlier.

635
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,600
Don´t send me away!

636
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,600
All right, l´ll go with you.

637
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,600
There´s a flight that leaves for
New York in the morning.

638
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:14,800
All right.

639
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,000
Let´s get going.

640
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,100
Not right now. l need some
time by myself.

641
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,000
l understand, l really do.

642
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,600
l´ll leave you alone, then.

643
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,800
Look, could you please
stop following me?

644
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,900
Hey, take it easy.

645
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,200
Look...

646
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,500
What´s the matter with you?

647
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,700
Just don´t follow me, okay?

648
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,400
We did what we did,
it was nice.

649
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,200
But just don´t follow me, okay?

650
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,200
Shit!

651
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:15,400
Hi.

652
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:16,400
Hi.

653
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,300
l don´t want anything. l just
like to sit for a few minutes.

654
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,800
Sure.

655
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,500
Are you all right?

656
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,200
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

657
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,300
lt´s a nice dress.
You look great.

658
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,400
What is it?

659
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,000
l´m fine.

660
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,000
l´m going to California at
the end of the week.

661
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,500
lt´s gonna be quite
a change.

662
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,200
l thought you wanna
get your Ph. D. here.

663
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,600
No, UCLA.

664
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,800
Wow, that´s a long way off.

665
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,800
Yeah, it´s a good school,
though.

666
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,200
Yeah.

667
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,300
What is it?

668
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
ls there anything l can
help you with?

669
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,500
Sure... 1 ,200 dollars.

670
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,000
Does that sound like a good
deal or what?

671
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,700
l think l can swing it.

672
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,200
No! No!

673
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,600
Yeah.

674
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,600
Why are you so nice to me?

675
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,400
Because l like you.

676
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,900
You look like you´re going
through a hard time.

677
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,000
Well, let me think about it.
l still have a couple of weeks.

678
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:11,900
You should take it
now, Sue.

679
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,800
l´m gonna be gone at the
end of the week.

680
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,100
lt´s no big deal.

681
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,900
No, no.

682
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:43,900
What is it?

683
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,900
Oh, l´m okay.

684
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,400
l just had a little trouble
breathing for a second.

685
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,400
You should see a doctor.

686
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,400
No, l´m fine, really.
l´m fine.

687
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,500
l´m here through Sunday.

688
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,700
Okay, great.
l´ll see you then.

689
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,100
Bye.

690
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:16,900
What are you doing here?

691
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,100
l´ve been looking for you for days.

692
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,600
l can´t get involved with
anybody right now.

693
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,400
Why not?

694
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,300
Because l´ve just got
too many problems

695
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,600
and l just can´t get burnt
by somebody right now.

696
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,800
You really think l´m
gonna burn you?

697
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,800
Yes, l do, l really do.

698
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,300
l´ve been burnt by everybody,
all around me,

699
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,200
ever since the day l was born.
And l just...

700
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,400
l know it´s my fault,
lt´ my fault,

701
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,700
because l get too vulnerable,
it´s not their fault.

702
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,600
But l just... l just
can´t do it.

703
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,600
You´re not even here,
you travel all the time.

704
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,600
One minute you´re here,
one minute you´re gone.

705
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,200
lt´s just...

706
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,800
Sue, l´m not going to be
traveling forever.

707
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,300
lt´s your job.

708
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
lt´s been my job for the
past 4 years.

709
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,300
Exactly. And before?

710
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:24,200
Before l was a chef.

711
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,200
And chefs are nailed down?

712
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,000
l was, yes.

713
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,100
Come on, Sue! Come out here!

714
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:33,900
Please!

715
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,800
Before that, l ran a video
store for 3 years.

716
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,800
Before that, l was
in the army.

717
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,400
They trusted me... government,
come on.

718
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,100
Sue, it´s all right.

719
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,800
Things change.

720
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,800
My life doesn´t change.

721
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,400
Yes, your life can change.

722
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,100
No, it doesn´t change, that´s
the point. lt never changes.

723
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,300
lt will.

724
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,400
lt doesn´t.

725
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,300
l can´t have children. l´ve
taken a million drugs,

726
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,300
l´ve had a million abortions.
lt´s ridiculous.

727
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:15,000
l don´t care. Do you hear
me? l don´t care.

728
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,500
ls that true?

729
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,900
Yes, that´s true.

730
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,800
Yeah! Well, thank you
very much.

731
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,000
lt was really nice
meeting you.

732
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,000
Oh, ditto, ditto.

733
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,000
l can start whenever
you want.

734
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,000
All right. Well, l´ll talk to
the guys upstairs

735
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,200
and we´ll call you later.

736
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,700
Okay, thanks.

737
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,800
You left me your
number, right?

738
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,800
lt´s on my resume.

739
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Okay.

740
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,300

741
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,000

Thank you.

745
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,000
Hello, Miss Kallenowski.

746
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,700
Nice to meet you.
Come in and have a seat.

747
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,200
Oh, sure. Thank you.

748
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:12,000
Well, Miss Kallenowski.
Sue, if you don´t mind,

749
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:16,400
seems you have a lot of
experience and...

750
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,200
everything we require in one
of our employees.

751
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,800
So, congratulations, good to
have you aboard.

752
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,000
Thank you so much.
You won´t be sorry.

753
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,900
Beautiful day, isn´t
it, driver?

754
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,700
l said, beautiful day, isn´t it.
Can you hear me?

755
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,700
l mean for New York,
in this time of year.

756
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,000
l love this kind of weather.

757
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,600
l´m going to lunch with
a friend of mine.

758
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,200
He´s a writer. He´s
very interesting.

759
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,800
Well, writers by definition
are interesting

760
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,600
people, though, aren´t they?

761
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,100
l really like this guy.

762
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,200
When l´ve been feeling
good, l can´t imagine

763
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,800
why l was feeling bad
for so long.

764
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,300
l don´t know where the
desperation

765
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,800
comes from sometimes.

766
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,200
What´s his name?

767
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,100
Ben.

768
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,100
Ben what?

769
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,100
l don´t know. But he didn´t
ask my last name, either.

770
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,900
Why didn´t you ask him?

771
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,900
Ask him what?

772
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,600
For the rent money.

773
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,300
No. l told you, l got this job.
Why should he pay my rent?

774
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,400
Commitment. Love.
Sharing.

775
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,300
l mean, don´t get me wrong,
my offer still stands,

776
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,800
but if he´s the right guy,
then he´ll come through.

777
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:01,200
No, l couldn´t do that.

778
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,500
My number in Santa Monica.
Linda McNeil.

779
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,600

anything, okay?

780

noodles to go, please?

No, no eggroll. Just

787
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,900

788
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,500
No soda. Sesame noodles,
no eggroll, no soda.

789
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,800
Sesame noodle!
No soda! To go!

790
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:08,300
How much, please?
How much, please?

791
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,100
Watch where you´re walking,
you piece of shit!

792
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,200
What´s all that noise? Where
are you calling from?

793
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,300

a job. l´m going to lndia.

lt happened all of a sudden.

Somebody else has
dropped out.

799
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,900
l had to make up my mind.

800
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,100
l needed time to get
ready and go.

801
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,400
Good luck, Ben.

802
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,900

809
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,700

Oh, really?

What am l doing here?

888
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:34,700
The real question is,

889
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,400
l´m looking for Lola.
Where´s Lola?

890
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,600
What the hell´s going
on here?

891
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:40,400
Lola has been gone
for weeks.

892
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,200
Where did she go?

893
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,600
l don´t know. l haven´t
heard from her.

894
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,200
Do you want something
to drink?

895
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,400

01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,200
Sit down. lt will cost

01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,200
What do you mean?

899
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:07,900
l was joking.

900
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,800
What have you got there?

901
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:13,800
A knife.

902
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,400
Oh, l thought it was
gonna be a gun.

903
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:22,200
Ain´t you scared of letting in
people, just like that?

904
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,900
Especially guys who´d just
come out of jail?

905
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,200
No, l love violence.

906
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,100
You do.

907
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:33,700
Uh-huh.

908
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,800
Keep drinking.

909
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,100
l didn´t mean to kill
the conversation.

910
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,800
You didn´t kill nothing.
l come here to kill Lola.

911
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,100
The cheating bitch.

912
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,000
l was going to cut her
arms off.

913
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,200
lt sounds so exciting.

914
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:55,000
But Lola´s not here.

915
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,800
No, she´s not.

916
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,600
But l am.

917
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,800
You´re some woman, Sue,
you know.

918
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:13,500
ln a lot of ways you
remind me of Lola.

919
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
Really?

920
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,200
You even drink like her.

Thank you.

922
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,200
l´m just going to take
my watch off.

923
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,200
lt´s a gift from my mother.
l wouldn´t want anything

924
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,400
to happen to it when
my arm goes.

925
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,400
What do you mean?

926
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,100
lt´s a joke.

927
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:39,200
l get it.

928
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:47,500
You know, you came through
the door, l said to myself:

929
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,500
´´Now, there´s the man
for you.´´

930
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,600
And l have really
good instincts.

931
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,900
You know, Eddie, sex is
very important to me.

932
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Lola never had any
complaints.

933
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,800
Yeah, well, Lola´s
not here.

934
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:32,200
Hi, Pedro, how´s it going?

a little dizzy.

Ben, could l borrow a few
dollars, just to tide me over?

You´re teasing me, right?

that she´s gonna be dead

1102
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,300

noodles to go.
