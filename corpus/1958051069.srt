1
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:04,251
Who the fuck are these guys?

2
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:17,583
Overwatch One. Come in, Overwatch
One. Overwatch, we got a problem.

3
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:18,833
<i>Do you copy?</i>

4
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,542
Stay off this channel.

5
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:23,584
No, we have a serious
problem. Did you not hear me?

6
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,584
<i>That's why you ever bring a lawyer
on an op. Stay off this channel.</i>

7
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:30,543
Fuck!

8
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,293
Mr. Nyland will see you now.

9
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:30,043
Great. Thank you.

10
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,751
- Sir.
- Are you Henderson?

11
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:42,709
Uh, Hendricks, sir.
Owen Hendricks.

12
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,126
How long you been
here, Mr. Hendricks?

13
00:02:45,626 --> 00:02:49,750
Only ten minutes, but you're very busy.
You're running the whole operation...

14
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:54,293
You mean how long I've been working here.
About two days. Just finished CIA 101.

15
00:02:56,418 --> 00:02:58,209
I'm sending you to the Senate.

16
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:01,543
Score.

17
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,125
Word is, head of the Senate
Intelligence Committee is planning

18
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:08,126
to read a classified
document at a public hearing.

19
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,583
Okay, and you want me
to tell him he can't.

20
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:14,292
Tell him that he's
an engorged ball sack

21
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,876
who should walk into
an airplane propeller.

22
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:21,501
Yes, sir. You mean tell
him that figuratively.

23
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:27,208
No, I don't. Listen to me
carefully, Mr. Hendricks.

24
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,251
If you fail to stop Senator Smoot
from reading that document...

25
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:34,293
you won't be working here
tomorrow. Am I clear?

26
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:42,251
You're a dead man walking.

27
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:47,875
Nyland thinks he can keep me in the dark
on the agency's covert clusterfucks,

28
00:03:47,876 --> 00:03:49,168
but he's wrong!

29
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,500
If I wanna read a document,
I'll read a document!

30
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:58,000
I have a constitutional
mandate to oversee the CIA,

31
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:03,043
and I am gonna exercise the hell out
of it, starting by subpoenaing you.

32
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:06,043
Now, I'm going back
into my hearing...

33
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,834
and I'm quoting this document.

34
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:21,084
Sir, that is completely your prerogative
as you are head of... the committee,

35
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,667
but may I just remind you that
revealing classified information

36
00:04:24,668 --> 00:04:27,708
is in violation of 18
U.S. code section 798

37
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,833
and will result in not
only criminal sanctions,

38
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:33,833
but potential reprimand
and censure in the Senate.

39
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:37,709
Also, that type of shit looks really
bad in a campaign video against you.

40
00:04:38,793 --> 00:04:42,251
If there's nothing else I can help
with, I gotta get back to Langley.

41
00:04:43,293 --> 00:04:44,793
It was a pleasure meeting you.

42
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,250
- How did it go?
- Pretty good.

43
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:54,125
- Dave!
- Thanks for your help.

44
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:57,084
In my office! Now!

45
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,583
Hey. Did you check
out that new CIA swag?

46
00:05:02,584 --> 00:05:04,875
Yeah. I'm gonna get me
one of those ski masks.

47
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,875
Yeah. Those are nice, right?

48
00:05:06,876 --> 00:05:08,500
- I don't even ski.
- Well...

49
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,793
- I just wanna look like a bank robber.
- Oh, oh, oh.

50
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,376
Here we go.

51
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,417
Oh, shit... I'm sorry.

52
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:16,834
Okay. What?

53
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:22,250
- Yeah. Hi. This is my office.
- We heard Nyland sent you to Capitol Hill.

54
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,708
Yeah, I didn't get to the Senate for
six months. You get there on day two?

55
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,990
- Trust me, it wasn't a reward.
- What was the assignment?

56
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:31,667
Just advising on
a classification.

57
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:34,292
Don't lie to us, Hendricks.
I was a professional sneak.

58
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,792
We know you met with the
head of Senate Intelligence.

59
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:39,500
Yeah. And I got my
ass handed to me.

60
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:42,583
I was straight-up cannon fodder
in the Nyland-Smoot feud.

61
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:44,708
Only reason the general
counsel sent me was...

62
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:46,459
Because new
guys get the shit work.

63
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:49,083
What the hell is this?

64
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:50,375
This is the crazies.

65
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:53,292
- The nutjobs.
- People trying to graymail the CIA.

66
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:54,833
Every letter
is from someone

67
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:58,750
threatening to expose classified
information if we don't help them.

68
00:05:58,751 --> 00:06:01,667
- That's extortion.
- Yet we get hundreds a year.

69
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:05,543
Your job? Vet each one of those. See
if the author can back up the threat.

70
00:06:08,376 --> 00:06:10,501
- How often does that happen?
- Hmm.

71
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:11,918
It happens.

72
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,918
Yeah. Oh, and if the secrets they're
threatening to reveal are bad,

73
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,334
it's a nightmare to navigate.

74
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,543
- That is a lot of coffee.
- Fuck.

75
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,125
I can't afford to fall asleep.

76
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:44,126
- Why? You got a brief?
- A brief? No. I work directly with SOG.

77
00:06:45,876 --> 00:06:49,250
Sorry, who are they? I'm struggling
to keep all the acronyms straight.

78
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,958
Special Operations Group.

79
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,668
Imagine if meth became sentient
and was given weaponry.

80
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:58,293
I've been in this building
for three straight days,

81
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,917
but if I leave, those crazy fucks
are gonna green-light a covert op

82
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:05,667
that I am single-handedly
keeping them from executing.

83
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:07,751
They don't listen
to their lawyer?

84
00:07:09,126 --> 00:07:11,875
No, this place is an
organization of con men,

85
00:07:11,876 --> 00:07:13,917
which makes us lawyers
for cheats and liars

86
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:15,959
who are actively
trying to sabotage us.

87
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:20,209
If you have any brains, get out before
the ink dries on your paperwork, kid.

88
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:21,751
Thanks.

89
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:24,292
<i>I've been unjustly
imprisoned in Connecticut.</i>

90
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:26,583
<i>I don't know how that
ham ended up in my purse.</i>

91
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:30,667
<i>I know about the aliens. I
worked for the agency in Cuba in 1963.</i>

92
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:32,500
<i>It was a
false flag operation.</i>

93
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:36,125
<i>If you don't help me, I'll expose
all I know about the JFK assassination.</i>

94
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:38,167
<i>My boyfriend
is cheating on me.</i>

95
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:42,168
<i>If you don't get him to stop, I'll expose
all the secret CIA prisons in Jersey.</i>

96
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,250
<i>My name is Max Meladze.</i>

97
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,834
<i>I'm in prison in Phoenix.</i>

98
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:58,209
<i>Get me out or I will spill agency secrets
on Selby Shaw, PW Butcher, and more.</i>

99
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:00,251
<i>You owe me.</i>

100
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,209
Um...

101
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:46,458
- Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Jesus Christ! Okay.

102
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,043
It's just Owen. You good?

103
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,001
It's me, from the
coffee... room.

104
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,001
What do you want?

105
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:56,333
Working on the crazies,
hoping you could help me.

106
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:58,376
No. Absolutely not.

107
00:08:59,001 --> 00:09:00,208
It'll take a second.

108
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,667
Never
help anyone around here.

109
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:06,125
And definitely do
not trust anyone.

110
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,542
This place is designed to
pit us against each other.

111
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:09,543
Okay.

112
00:09:10,418 --> 00:09:12,917
Got it. Except I really
do need your help.

113
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:16,043
So, what can I do to get you
to answer a few questions?

114
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:19,876
Do you have any speed?

115
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,459
No.

116
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:25,349
- Well, this has been fun. Toodle-oo.
- My roommate takes Adderall.

117
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:28,375
Good enough. Five pills
for every question. Go.

118
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:33,625
Okay, so I got this letter and I came
across a very weird name, PW Butcher.

119
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:35,208
Any idea what that means?

120
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,876
Yeah, that's a cryptonym.

121
00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:40,083
An agency code name for
a clandestine operation.

122
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:42,417
The first two letters,
PW, are a digraph,

123
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:45,583
literally the country code where
the operation is taking place,

124
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:49,000
and the two-syllable word that follows,
Butcher, is the actual code name.

125
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,208
Where did you find that?

126
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,168
In the graymail letter. Some
woman in prison for murder.

127
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,875
Yeah, there's no way an asset
should know an agency cryptonym

128
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,417
or even know they exist.

129
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,293
Does that mean this
is the real deal?

130
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:05,126
- Pfft. Not my department. Mm-mm.
- Come on.

131
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,751
I'll give you ten extra pills.

132
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,251
Do I follow up on this or not?

133
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:17,709
I wouldn't.

134
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,751
Why does it feel
like that's a yes?

135
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:25,543
Okay, if you were not gonna follow
up on this, where would you not go?

136
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,334
I gotta talk to someone
about an old op.

137
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:38,209
Excuse me, ladies, could you...?
What's up, dude? Could you, uh...?

138
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,834
My name's Owen Hendricks from
the general counsel's office.

139
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:47,625
Not interested.

140
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:50,543
I can respect that, but I got
questions that need answering.

141
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,500
Make it fast.

142
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,501
Sure.

143
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:00,458
What can you tell me about
the cryptonym PW Butcher?

144
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,501
PW is the country code for
Belarus, and then Butcher...

145
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:07,000
is a code name for an
operation in Belarus in 2009.

146
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:10,084
Okay. Great. And what
about the name Selby Shaw?

147
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,793
- What about it?
- Is it connected to PW Butcher?

148
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,583
I don't have access
to the specifics,

149
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:21,958
but Selby Shaw is a
pseudonym for a DO officer

150
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,792
who operated in
Belarus at that time.

151
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:26,584
Hmm. Okay. They're
both tracking as...

152
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:30,583
Would you mind putting in the
name Max Meladze? Maxine Meladze.

153
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,709
M-E-L-A-D-Z-E.
See what comes up.

154
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:38,709
Please.

155
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:43,793
Nothing.

156
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,668
- You sure?
- Yeah.

157
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:48,751
What's this about, anyways?

158
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:54,417
Agency got a graymail
letter from Meladze.

159
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:55,709
Jesus Christ.

160
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,083
- What?
- There's no way anyone outside the agency

161
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:02,251
should know a classified agency
cryptonym and an officer pseudonym.

162
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:07,709
- Could Meladze could be one of ours?
- Not without her showing up in the system.

163
00:12:08,543 --> 00:12:09,543
But?

164
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:13,125
But it's possible she
was a hip-pocket asset,

165
00:12:13,126 --> 00:12:16,375
so there wouldn't be a file on her
and no way to ID her case officer.

166
00:12:16,376 --> 00:12:19,168
Why would her handler soft
file her in the first place?

167
00:12:19,876 --> 00:12:22,333
She could've been a new
source he hadn't fully vetted.

168
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,543
With that level of
institutional knowledge?

169
00:12:25,126 --> 00:12:26,126
No.

170
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:27,793
That's troubling.

171
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,751
Okay.

172
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,043
Listen to me. I need you to
give me Selby Shaw's real name.

173
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,042
- And you think this is real?
- Yes.

174
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,375
Sir, she knows
classified information.

175
00:12:43,376 --> 00:12:45,833
- And you ran all this down in a few hours.
- Yes, sir.

176
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:48,834
And I have a lead on where to go
next. Our operative's real name.

177
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,959
Selby Shaw is a pseudonym
for Dawn Gilbane.

178
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,918
What the hell is wrong with you?

179
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:01,376
Never write an officer's true name
and their pseudonym on the same paper.

180
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:06,958
- Uh, sorry, sir, I didn't know.
- Get Kitchens and Ebner in here.

181
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,626
This can't be good.

182
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:21,333
- Where is she now?
- Meladze? At a prison in Phoenix.

183
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,833
- No, the operative.
- Gilbane.

184
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,875
She's at an agency
black site in Yemen.

185
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:27,959
Yes, sir?

186
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,959
Who had the
crazies before Hendricks?

187
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,583
- I did.
- Did you even open the folder?

188
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:36,709
Of course, sir. I did my due
diligence with everything in there...

189
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:39,625
Keep going with
the investigation.

190
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:42,042
These two will pick up the
slack on your workload.

191
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,043
Yes, sir.

192
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,626
Yes, sir?

193
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,459
Oh, sh...

194
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,750
- Thanks for screwing me over.
- I'm sorry, man. I had no idea.

195
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,626
Yeah,
bullshit. You set me up.

196
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,833
You set yourself up by doing jack shit
with those folders when you had them.

197
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,833
That's not true. Violet
had the folders before me.

198
00:14:23,834 --> 00:14:27,833
- How many cases of graymail did you find?
- A few. So, what's the story?

199
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,958
A possible hip-pocket
asset that knows too much.

200
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,042
How do I get to Yemen?

201
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:33,708
Nyland didn't say,
"Go to Yemen."

202
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,042
"Keep going
with the investigation."

203
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:39,417
Yes, but the answers I need are
in Yemen. So how do I get there?

204
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:43,958
Travel coach. Rent
an economy car.

205
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,001
Seriously?

206
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:49,876
Yeah. And keep the
receipts for everything.

207
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,959
They don't call this place
"the Company" for nothing.

208
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:59,250
I don't think I've ever
seen you dance like that before.

209
00:14:59,251 --> 00:15:01,418
This is amazing.

210
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:04,418
- All right. What's up?
- Okay.

211
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:09,126
If I get this in, you have to
buy groceries for the week.

212
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:13,418
- Oh, wow, that was so close.
- Ooh.

213
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:19,083
Okay, you have gotta clean the bathroom.
No. You gotta clean Owen and I's shower.

214
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,959
That sounds disgusting.

215
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,751
Whoo! Thank you.

216
00:15:25,043 --> 00:15:26,459
- Hey.
- Hi.

217
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:28,958
Did you bring
beer? I texted you.

218
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,626
Uh, no. You didn't.

219
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,501
- Huh.
- Hey.

220
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:36,875
- What's up, Bubba?
- I texted my mom.

221
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,875
No, you slow down, Mother.

222
00:15:38,876 --> 00:15:43,501
- Ooh. Sucks. Is there any food?
- Uh, there might be some pizza left.

223
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:47,709
What are you wearing?

224
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:51,667
It's Tad's. We're
role playing later.

225
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:54,125
I am making a special delivery.

226
00:15:54,126 --> 00:15:55,751
I'm so sorry that I asked.

227
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:00,458
- I'll take that.
- Where you going?

228
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,667
- Ah. You got next.
- I gotta pack.

229
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:03,876
To go where?

230
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:05,584
It's classified.

231
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:09,458
Look how smug he is about that.

232
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,209
So smug. Why so smug?

233
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:16,584
Are you ready, Chicago?

234
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,167
So, seriously,
where are you going?

235
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:29,918
Seriously, I can't tell you.

236
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:33,126
Okay. Well, how's your new job?

237
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:37,458
Have you made any new friends or
overthrown any foreign governments?

238
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:40,250
No to the friends. Maybe
to the governments.

239
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,293
Fingers crossed.

240
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,292
- Your mom called me.
- Oh?

241
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:49,208
Apparently, you forgot to tell
her that we aren't dating anymore.

242
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:52,208
Well, I haven't talked
to her in six months,

243
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:55,043
so she also doesn't
know I work at the CIA.

244
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:59,209
You can't avoid dealing
with her forever.

245
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:00,833
Sure I can.

246
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,668
- Hey, how's the firm?
- Ugh.

247
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:06,167
All I do is freeze my ass
off in a conference room,

248
00:17:06,168 --> 00:17:09,583
reading technical specs on
homicidal dialysis machines.

249
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:12,208
The joy of being a first
year at a law firm.

250
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:14,792
You should've joined
the agency with me.

251
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:18,125
Oh, my God. Could you imagine?
My parents would kill me.

252
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:20,709
There's this cool thing.

253
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,042
It's called "not giving a fuck what
your parents think." Super liberating.

254
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,959
- Did you find out where he's going?
- My powers of seduction were ineffective.

255
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,167
Do you mind if I take this?

256
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,417
- No.
- Thank you.

257
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:34,792
Well, he's definitely flying
because he's packing a carry-on,

258
00:17:34,793 --> 00:17:38,917
but he is not flying for long
because he's only packing a carry-on.

259
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:42,833
Your powers of deduction are wasted
at the Department of Treasury.

260
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,917
Okay, just for that, Tad and I, we're
gonna role play in your room tonight

261
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:48,959
once you're off circumnavigating
the globe in your government jet.

262
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:52,709
- I don't get a jet.
- Since when do spies fly commercial?

263
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,292
I'm not a spy.

264
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:55,293
I am a lawyer.

265
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,417
Hey!

266
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:55,876
What's going on,
man? How's it going?

267
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:59,834
I'm Owen Hendricks over at
the general counsel's office.

268
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:04,542
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Okay, listen,
man. No, no, no. Wait. Whoa!

269
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,959
God.

270
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:14,084
Hey, hi. I think there's
been a mistake. Fuck.

271
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,626
Wow. You guys really
loosened these teeth.

272
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,793
I'm an American, dumbass.
So, there's been...

273
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:34,417
Thank God. Hi. I'm Owen Hendricks
from the general counsel's office.

274
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:38,333
And you just thought you'd pop
by a black site unannounced.

275
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,251
Sorry. Was I supposed to call?

276
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:47,626
There was no cable
traffic about your trip.

277
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:51,583
No clearance from the
ambassador or diplomatic cover.

278
00:19:51,584 --> 00:19:53,626
- Well, I'm new.
- You're an idiot.

279
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:57,917
- Or just pretending to be one.
- It's actually neither of those.

280
00:19:57,918 --> 00:20:00,375
- Hmm.
- I flew all the way here

281
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:01,875
to talk to you about an old op

282
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,959
- from many years ago. What...?
- Bullshit. Bullshit.

283
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:09,834
What color is this?

284
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:14,459
Blue?

285
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:21,084
You really are new. Otherwise, the agency
would have issued you a black passport

286
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:24,084
which grants you
diplomatic immunity.

287
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:26,834
No one told me that.

288
00:20:27,334 --> 00:20:28,376
- Strip him.
- What?

289
00:20:29,168 --> 00:20:32,668
What? Wait a second. What are
you doing? No, no. Whoa, guys.

290
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,125
Fuck. No. Hey, this is a
new suit. What is going on?

291
00:20:39,126 --> 00:20:43,667
That's what I wanna know. No way
you came out here to talk about an old op.

292
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:46,833
I think you're here to investigate
us, which makes you a hostile.

293
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:48,167
But you fucked up.

294
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:50,708
Without a cover identity
and a diplomatic passport,

295
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:54,375
the Yemeni secret police will arrest you
for spying and shoot you in the head.

296
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:57,209
With a black passport,
you just get deported.

297
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,793
But someone should have told you
that before you got on the plane.

298
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:05,208
- Made some enemies at work already?
- Looks like it.

299
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:09,001
- You sure don't have any friends here.
- All right. Let's... Wait.

300
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,501
So... here's what's
gonna happen.

301
00:21:13,959 --> 00:21:16,500
You're gonna tell me what you're
really doing in my black site

302
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:20,292
or the PSO is gonna get an
anonymous tip you're up to no good.

303
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:24,001
You're gonna end up with a cattle prod
in one end, a hollow point in the other.

304
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:25,667
No, no, no.

305
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,584
Fuck!

306
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:31,875
God! I'm telling you the
truth! I came across a graymail

307
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:36,750
that was connected to a fucking operation
that you ran. Wait, wait, listen to me.

308
00:21:36,751 --> 00:21:39,667
It's my first week on the job.
I got recruited in law school.

309
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,583
I said no to a bunch
of high-paying jobs

310
00:21:41,584 --> 00:21:44,042
because I got this pathological
need for stimulation.

311
00:21:44,043 --> 00:21:46,417
Probably 'cause my dad got
blown up in Afghanistan.

312
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,500
My mom never got over it.

313
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,208
I have just been running away

314
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,875
from having to spend any longer than five
minutes with my thoughts alone ever since.

315
00:21:53,876 --> 00:21:55,542
So, yeah, when that recruit came

316
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:58,458
and he promised me I could do
cool stuff, I thought, "Fuck it."

317
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:02,167
And, you know, fuck it. Maybe
I'll even make my dad proud.

318
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:06,417
You know, I have been faking it
until I made it for my entire life,

319
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,958
but I'm sorry because I
can fucking understand

320
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:13,126
how I have clearly miscalculated
applying that approach to the agency.

321
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:20,293
What's the op?

322
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:25,000
PW Butcher. The asset's
name is Maxine Meladze.

323
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,501
She wrote us a graymail letter.

324
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:30,543
Cut him loose.

325
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:40,334
Yeah, I fucking pissed myself.

326
00:22:40,876 --> 00:22:43,376
Congratulations. You
are good at your jobs.

327
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:46,083
<i>I never met Meladze.</i>

328
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:47,418
But you remember her.

329
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,084
Vaguely.

330
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,001
I used HUMINT from her
to carry out an op.

331
00:22:52,584 --> 00:22:55,375
If I remember right, she
was a pretty valuable asset.

332
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:58,750
Upper-level player of the Belarus
chapter of the Russian mafia.

333
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:02,084
She had serious connections
inside Russian intelligence.

334
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:05,584
- Who was her handler?
- Sorry, I don't remember.

335
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:09,333
It was a long time ago, and I've
run a hundred ops since then.

336
00:23:09,334 --> 00:23:11,001
But she was a big deal.

337
00:23:11,793 --> 00:23:14,750
And the fact that somebody would
hip-pocket a girl like that

338
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,375
should scare the
crap out of you.

339
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:20,126
Listen, sorry about the
enhanced interrogation.

340
00:23:20,626 --> 00:23:22,833
- Yeah.
- Some guys might hold a grudge.

341
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:27,167
I chalk it up to a communication
breakdown and a lesson on the importance

342
00:23:27,168 --> 00:23:30,083
of following protocol when
interacting with clandestine services.

343
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:33,750
So I don't have to tell anyone at
Langley about the whole torture thing?

344
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:37,251
Exactly. Although some people
might enjoy hearing about it.

345
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:42,043
Yeah. Pretty sure I can smooth
things out with them, though.

346
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:46,458
Working at the CIA is like a never
ending game of musical chairs.

347
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:51,042
Everyone is maneuvering to figure out who
will have a seat when the music stops.

348
00:23:51,043 --> 00:23:55,626
Easiest way to make sure you have a seat
is to hamstring the guy next to you.

349
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,626
If you don't start playing,
figuring out how shit works,

350
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:01,751
you're gonna be in trouble.

351
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,542
More trouble than getting
my fingernail pulled out?

352
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:07,793
Nails grow back. Drive safe.

353
00:24:08,834 --> 00:24:10,668
Keep an eye peeled for the PSO.

354
00:24:40,584 --> 00:24:41,584
How did it go?

355
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,626
Oh, I can't
talk about it.

356
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,417
- What?
- I can't talk about it.

357
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:06,126
- Come on, man. Just let me sleep.
- What are you wearing?

358
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:09,833
My suit got ruined.

359
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:10,876
Mm-hm.

360
00:25:12,668 --> 00:25:15,043
I'm surprised they let you
on the plane wearing that.

361
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,333
Suggests a country with
lesser security standards.

362
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:22,876
- Third world, perhaps?
- I said I can't talk about it.

363
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,167
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.

364
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:31,750
- Owen was in the shit somewhere.
- Owen loves being in the shit.

365
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:34,959
- He didn't love this.
- Can you guys please just let me sleep?

366
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:36,668
What happened?

367
00:25:37,834 --> 00:25:39,168
I can't talk about it.

368
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:41,168
But I'm fine.

369
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:43,751
You don't seem fine.

370
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:50,501
Come on.

371
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,751
What...? What are you doing?

372
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,959
Mm. Being human.

373
00:25:58,293 --> 00:26:00,043
Come on. Get in here.

374
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:04,293
- I don't wanna wrinkle my outfit.
- Said by no one young ever.

375
00:26:09,126 --> 00:26:10,126
I'm running late.

376
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:13,208
Call me if you wanna talk. Okay?

377
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,209
Thank you.

378
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:18,043
Are you okay?

379
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:20,876
I am now.

380
00:26:22,043 --> 00:26:23,459
Now, get out of my room.

381
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,376
Okay. Get some sleep.

382
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:35,084
No.

383
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:46,668
- Hello.
<i>- Hold for the general counsel.</i>

384
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,583
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

385
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,126
- Hi.
- How was Yemen?

386
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:05,626
It was great. No
thanks to you two.

387
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,417
Look, I don't mind getting
hazed 'cause I'm the new guy,

388
00:27:10,418 --> 00:27:13,418
but if either one of you try
to torpedo me like that again,

389
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:15,543
we're gonna have a problem.

390
00:27:17,334 --> 00:27:18,334
Hmm.

391
00:27:18,335 --> 00:27:22,084
Now, I gotta get upstairs.
General counsel needs me. Again.

392
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:25,209
Cheers.

393
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:30,001
Without a 201 file, no way
to know who Meladze's handler was.

394
00:27:30,501 --> 00:27:34,042
But given that Agent Gilbane
confirmed that Max was an asset,

395
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,793
we have to take the
graymail threat seriously.

396
00:27:37,668 --> 00:27:40,584
- I didn't tell you to go to Yemen.
- Yes, sir.

397
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:45,043
I decided to make the judgment call
that it was the necessary next step.

398
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:49,250
Plus, I figured you're the type of
leader who appreciates initiative,

399
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,458
but if you want me
to get approval...

400
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,084
No. Initiative is good.

401
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:55,959
Nice job.

402
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,209
Thank you.

403
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:01,959
What happened to your hand?

404
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:08,501
Closed it in a car door.

405
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:10,334
Ah.

406
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:15,459
Go to Phoenix. Talk to Meladze.

407
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,418
Yes, sir.

408
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,668
Now?

409
00:28:26,126 --> 00:28:28,793
Sir, it's just, my day
started three days ago.

410
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,001
Great. Yeah. Phoenix it is.

411
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:41,584
<i>What can you tell me
about Max Meladze?</i>

412
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:45,292
She's been held without bail due
to the brutal nature of her crime.

413
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:48,751
- Who'd she kill?
- A trucking guy named Salvatore Kwitny.

414
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:53,251
Phoenix PD thinks Miss Meladze was
using his trucks to run product.

415
00:28:55,584 --> 00:28:57,833
So, what is the CIA's
interest in her?

416
00:28:57,834 --> 00:29:01,833
Not at liberty to say, but I'll
need a digital copy of her file

417
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:04,709
and a private room to meet with
her. No listeners, no cameras.

418
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:46,876
Shall we?

419
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:52,917
Who are you?

420
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,876
I'm Owen Hendricks from the general
counsel's office at the CIA.

421
00:29:56,668 --> 00:29:57,793
We got your letter.

422
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,250
- Took you long enough.
- Yeah, it's a busy place.

423
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:06,126
You know that making threats
against the agency's a crime, right?

424
00:30:06,709 --> 00:30:07,834
I know many things.

425
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:11,126
More than you, that's for sure.

426
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:16,751
So how long has it
been, huh? A few weeks?

427
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:21,250
- You know how to use the copy machine?
- We're not here to talk about me.

428
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:25,209
- What happened to your hand?
- I closed it in a car door.

429
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:32,168
Liar. I've pulled out enough fingernails
to know what it looks like afterwards.

430
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:36,042
You seem really proud of that.

431
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,583
Shouldn't I be? Some of
those nails were for the CIA.

432
00:30:38,584 --> 00:30:41,542
Oh, is that one of the things
that you're threatening to expose?

433
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:42,543
No.

434
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:47,793
- So how do you like the agency so far?
- It's great. Who was your handler?

435
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:51,126
Dumb question, because now I
know you have no hard file on me.

436
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:55,126
Which means you have no idea
what I know or who I can burn.

437
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,875
Maybe. But I'm gonna
find out soon enough.

438
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:02,084
Only if I tell you,
which I won't...

439
00:31:03,084 --> 00:31:05,043
unless you do some
things for me.

440
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:08,583
- Who pulled out your fingernail?
- No one.

441
00:31:08,584 --> 00:31:10,793
I have classified CIA documents.

442
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:13,418
You have documents?

443
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:16,709
So many documents. Who
pulled out your nail?

444
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:22,792
An operative in Yemen. I
went to ask her about you.

445
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:27,043
"Her." You know, you give away
information without realizing it.

446
00:31:28,084 --> 00:31:30,584
I'm surprised you
survived your trip.

447
00:31:32,418 --> 00:31:34,250
It certainly doesn't
inspire confidence

448
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:36,833
that you're the right lawyer
to help me get out of here.

449
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:39,543
- I am not here to get you out.
- Games.

450
00:31:40,126 --> 00:31:41,750
I am bored.

451
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:45,334
- Tell your boss to call someone else.
- Wait, hold on. Just...

452
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:51,168
Hi, excuse me, one second, excuse
me. Excuse me. Miss, please.

453
00:31:56,668 --> 00:31:57,917
Give me those documents.

454
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,834
If you're telling me the
truth, then I'll help you.

455
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:02,959
There. See?

456
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:04,834
Was that so hard?

457
00:32:05,876 --> 00:32:08,875
- They're in a storage locker.
- You have top-secret CIA documents

458
00:32:08,876 --> 00:32:11,125
in a storage locker where
anyone can find them?

459
00:32:11,126 --> 00:32:12,834
I like to live dangerously.

460
00:32:13,334 --> 00:32:15,125
<i>you need to
secure those files ASAP.</i>

461
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:18,042
<i>Call the local FBI
office and get an escort.</i>

462
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:19,043
Yes, sir.

463
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:22,543
- You need me to send Kitchens to help?
<i>- No, sir. Definitely not.</i>

464
00:32:23,626 --> 00:32:26,334
- I've got this.
- <i>All right. Don't fuck this up.</i>

465
00:32:33,168 --> 00:32:35,042
<i>You have reached
the Phoenix Division</i>

466
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:36,625
<i>of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.</i>

467
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:39,708
<i>If you know your party's extension,
you can dial it at any time.</i>

468
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,583
<i>For Cyber Division, press one.</i>

469
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,125
<i>For International Operations

470
00:32:44,126 --> 00:32:47,125
<i>For Critical Incident

471
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:50,083
<i>For Criminal Investigative
Division, press four.</i>

472
00:32:50,084 --> 00:32:52,875
<i>You have pressed four, Criminal
Investigative Division.</i>

473
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:54,500
<i>All investigators are...</i>

474
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:55,501
Fuck it, man.

475
00:33:16,709 --> 00:33:19,334
<i>Empathy can
be thought of in several ways.</i>

476
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:23,376
<i>The first is to contrast
empathy with sympathy...</i>

477
00:33:37,918 --> 00:33:38,918
<i>In true psychopaths...</i>

478
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:40,500
Who the
fuck is this guy?

479
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,543
<i>The parts of the brain that
control empathy are dark.</i>

480
00:33:52,293 --> 00:33:54,417
<i>Psychopaths have
reduced connections</i>

481
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:56,668
<i>between the ventral
medial prefrontal cortex,</i>

482
00:33:57,334 --> 00:33:59,168
<i>the part of the brain
responsible for...</i>

483
00:34:15,293 --> 00:34:16,418
We'll take the bag.

484
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:27,000
Bro, what's your plan here? It's
not like you'll get out of there.

485
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:29,708
I'm sorry. Who are you?

486
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:32,958
We're the guys who are gonna take
the bag. Did you not see his gun?

487
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,125
No, I saw it, man.

488
00:34:34,126 --> 00:34:37,167
Just not the first one I've
seen today... Yesterday.

489
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:39,958
It was two days ago. I
can't do the math, man.

490
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:43,333
- It's been an epically strange day.
- No problem. We can end it for you.

491
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:46,083
No, I'm good. Wasn't
really complaining.

492
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,667
Open the gate. Give us the
bag, maybe we'll let you go home.

493
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:51,584
Not gonna happen, man. My bad.

494
00:34:52,709 --> 00:34:55,293
You do know bullets go
through metal, right?

495
00:34:58,209 --> 00:35:00,376
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

496
00:35:02,293 --> 00:35:04,083
Hey, relax!
Relax! <i>Calmate!</i>

497
00:35:04,084 --> 00:35:06,667
I got it! It's fine!
Come in. I got it.

498
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,584
All right.

499
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:17,418
Shit.

500
00:36:23,543 --> 00:36:25,126
That was not cool, bro.

501
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:28,709
You made me run. I hate running.

502
00:36:30,418 --> 00:36:31,418
The bag.

503
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:34,251
Fuck you.

504
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,293
You look rough.

505
00:37:57,251 --> 00:37:59,168
You got a little bit of vomit...

506
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,626
Using me as an errand
boy almost got me killed.

507
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:12,251
Who the fuck booby-traps
a bag with acid?

508
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:14,418
A survivor.

509
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:17,168
Where's my money?

510
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,500
In my trunk. Who were the
guys trying to get it from me?

511
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:23,793
Disgruntled competitors. They
think it belongs to them.

512
00:38:24,293 --> 00:38:26,708
As soon as we're done, I'm
giving it to the police.

513
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,418
Are you really this stupid?

514
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:31,250
No, you're not handing it over.

515
00:38:31,251 --> 00:38:33,458
When you leave
here, take the bag,

516
00:38:33,459 --> 00:38:36,083
put it in a garbage can at
the back of the parking lot,

517
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:38,500
and I will have someone pick
it up and secure it for me.

518
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:39,625
Why would I do that?

519
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:42,667
Because I have all the leverage.
You have no idea who I am,

520
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:46,793
or what I know, Owen, and that
should scare the shit out of you.

521
00:38:47,418 --> 00:38:50,751
So I spent the afternoon going
through your social media.

522
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:53,750
Thank you for giving me
your real name by the way.

523
00:38:53,751 --> 00:38:55,292
Who I am is hardly relevant.

524
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:59,293
I disagree because now I know
everything you've done since college.

525
00:38:59,834 --> 00:39:02,209
Every place you've lived.
Every woman you've dated.

526
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:07,418
I know that your father is buried
in a military cemetery and...

527
00:39:08,251 --> 00:39:10,250
you spend a lot of time there.

528
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:12,376
I don't need social media
to know who you are, Max.

529
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:16,626
I read your arrest report. I
saw the photos of your house.

530
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:22,500
You're a woman that lives without life.
Not even one photo on any of your walls.

531
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:24,334
What, no family? No friends?

532
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:26,293
No joy?

533
00:39:27,709 --> 00:39:31,209
Seems like the only thing that
you have is being a criminal.

534
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,751
How I live my life
isn't important.

535
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:40,125
I know about dozens of top secret
CIA operations in Belarus and Russia

536
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:42,417
involving incredibly
well-connected people.

537
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:45,500
Stuff the agency would do
anything to keep secret.

538
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:47,583
So here's what
you're going to do.

539
00:39:47,584 --> 00:39:51,083
You're gonna go back to Langley and make
sure the Company's number one priority

540
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,043
is having the murder
charges against me dropped.

541
00:39:53,626 --> 00:39:57,125
And if anyone there thinks it
would be easier to have me killed,

542
00:39:57,126 --> 00:40:01,208
if anything happens to me,
a press release will go out

543
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:05,000
detailing the minutiae of a decade's
worth of clandestine operations.

544
00:40:05,001 --> 00:40:07,459
- And guess who will be blamed?
- I get it.

545
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:11,208
Let me call my boss.

546
00:40:11,209 --> 00:40:12,209
Oh, my God.

547
00:40:12,668 --> 00:40:13,876
No. Owen.

548
00:40:15,084 --> 00:40:16,833
You're not calling your boss.

549
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,417
He isn't going to want
anything to do with this.

550
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,042
When he finds out
how bad this is,

551
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,043
he will do anything to
wrap this around your neck.

552
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:28,918
There's no reason why you need to
be collateral damage in all of this.

553
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,751
Do not try to
manipulate me. Don't.

554
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:35,292
I'm just a lawyer doing my job.

555
00:40:35,293 --> 00:40:38,208
No. You're just a lawyer standing
in the middle of a minefield,

556
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:39,542
and you don't even know it.

557
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:41,667
So, yeah. Do what
you need to do.

558
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:43,958
Stumble around,
blow yourself up,

559
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:48,168
or you can let me guide you through
this so you don't destroy yourself.

560
00:40:49,793 --> 00:40:52,000
Your
compassion is touching,

561
00:40:52,001 --> 00:40:55,334
but there's no way you're offering to
help me out of the goodness of your heart.

562
00:40:58,834 --> 00:41:01,333
So, you don't have the
leverage that you claim.

563
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,584
- Oh, no?
- No.

564
00:41:03,834 --> 00:41:07,168
If I'm in a minefield, and
I'm not buying your premise...

565
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:12,043
you need me to get out safe
or else you might not survive.

566
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:16,668
You really thought it was Christmas
morning when I walked in here.

567
00:41:17,376 --> 00:41:20,292
A kid fresh out of law school who
doesn't even know how to run the copier.

568
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:21,584
I think that's what you said.

569
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:24,875
You thought you could manipulate and
bully me into doing things your way,

570
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:28,625
but you made a mistake, I'm a guy
that doesn't mind falling on his face

571
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:29,958
or getting in over my head.

572
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,626
I actually kinda like that.

573
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,459
It's why I get up
in the morning.

574
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:37,834
So stop playing games.

575
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:41,918
I need you and you need me.

576
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,459
So let's make a deal.

577
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:52,000
Forget it. You're a murderer. The
last thing I need is your help.

578
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:54,625
I'm going back to Langley, giving
a full report on what happened.

579
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:55,792
I'll be in touch.

580
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:57,125
- Okay.
- Guard.

581
00:41:57,126 --> 00:42:00,543
You do that, but before you leave,
I have a parting gift for you.

582
00:42:03,334 --> 00:42:05,084
My handler was Not Bob.

583
00:42:07,834 --> 00:42:11,459
- What is that, a fucking riddle?
- No, your agency will know who it is.

584
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,418
Good luck.

585
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,168
You're gonna need it.

586
00:42:49,168 --> 00:42:52,501
<i>So I spent the afternoon
going through your social media.</i>

587
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:00,334
<i>Now I know everything
you've done since college.</i>

588
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,584
<i>Every place you've lived.</i>

589
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,459
<i>Every woman you've dated.</i>

590
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:43,376
Sor... Just one second.

591
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,584
Oh, no. No.

592
00:43:59,626 --> 00:44:01,834
No, no, no. What...
What time is it?

593
00:44:02,584 --> 00:44:06,043
- What day is it?
- It's 9 a.m. on Thursday.

594
00:44:07,834 --> 00:44:08,834
Oh, fuck.

595
00:44:09,918 --> 00:44:11,001
Fuck. Uh...

596
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:15,168
Last thing I remember,
I... I was eating...

597
00:44:19,334 --> 00:44:20,334
Yep.

598
00:44:20,876 --> 00:44:23,751
Those barbarians. They drugged
me so they could go run their op.

599
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:26,000
Uh, can't you stop them?

600
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:28,709
No, once they're wheels up,
all I can do is damage control.

601
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,251
Well, so long as
you're not busy, um,

602
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:36,709
if I said the name "Not
Bob," what would you say?

603
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:38,668
What?

604
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:43,125
Hey, I ate an Ambien sandwich.
I need short simple questions.

605
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:44,459
Who is Not Bob?

606
00:44:45,084 --> 00:44:47,501
- Everybody's heard of Not Bob.
- I haven't.

607
00:44:48,043 --> 00:44:50,125
He's a legend inside the agency,

608
00:44:50,126 --> 00:44:53,125
ran the most dangerous ops in history,
he retired as a division chief.

609
00:44:53,126 --> 00:44:54,834
Why do we call him Not Bob?

610
00:44:55,334 --> 00:44:59,792
Because he refused to use the pseudonym
of Bob or Robert as a first name.

611
00:44:59,793 --> 00:45:02,959
Well, I just got Not Bob's
name from my graymailer.

612
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:09,333
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

613
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,333
Assets don't know their
case officers' real names,

614
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,458
and sure as shit wouldn't
know an internal nickname.

615
00:45:14,459 --> 00:45:18,292
People keep saying that she shouldn't
know these things, and then she does.

616
00:45:18,293 --> 00:45:21,542
- So, what am I supposed to do?
- Get out of my office.

617
00:45:21,543 --> 00:45:22,459
Janus.

618
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,375
I have enough trouble trying to
control my rogue spec ops team.

619
00:45:25,376 --> 00:45:28,583
The last thing I need is any of your
radioactive graymail case getting on me.

620
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:30,833
Come on. It can't be that bad.

621
00:45:30,834 --> 00:45:33,501
It's always that bad, you moron.

622
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:37,875
Not Bob isn't just some
former king shit CIA officer.

623
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:40,084
He is currently the
chief of staff...

624
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:42,417
The... The president?

625
00:45:42,418 --> 00:45:45,209
For the fucking President
of the United States.

626
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:56,418
So, what happened in Phoenix?

627
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:05,126
Uh...

628
00:46:07,126 --> 00:46:08,209
Um...

629
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:10,834
Well?

630
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,626
Upon interviewing Max Meladze,

631
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:22,459
I feel that her threat
of graymail is credible

632
00:46:23,126 --> 00:46:25,959
and requires further
investigation.

633
00:46:31,459 --> 00:46:32,459
Okay.

634
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:34,793
Keep me posted.

635
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,584
- Hello?
<i>- I'm gonna ask you one question.</i>

636
00:47:52,626 --> 00:47:55,126
And if you answer honestly,
I'll accept your offer.

637
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,543
What's the question?

638
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:03,501
Can I trust you?

639
00:48:06,001 --> 00:48:07,501
When our interests align.

640
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:09,001
Otherwise, no.

641
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,168
I'm in.
