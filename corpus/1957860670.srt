00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,999
Haunted Houses tend
to be a main attraction

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,279
during Halloween season.

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,709
You enter a dark place,

7
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,589
you walk down a long hallway,

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,644
and you never know what
will be lurking about.

9
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,119
(laughs)

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,859
What if you entered a contest,
(cat yowling)

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,569
And won an exclusive ticket

12
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,059
to the one night only Shadow's Edge?

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,714
Well that's what
tonight's feature's about.

but remember to follow the rules.

17
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,336
Now, enter at your own risk.

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,949
Um, hi.

23
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,863
Can you get me some black
cream makeup out of the case?

24
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,166
I don't work here.

25
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,617
But you have a name tag on.

26
00:02:48,157 --> 00:02:49,324
No, I don't.

27
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,127
[Evan] You're gonna
get fired, you know that?

28
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,359
Good, I can finally
get out of here, then.

29
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,159
[Evan] How can you
hate this place so much?

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,809
This place is great.

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,326
I mean, look at that, those girls are hot.

32
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,069
And that one's shorts are so short,

33
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,569
they might as well be called a belt.

34
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,403
If you like it so much,

35
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:13,379
why don't you come around
the counter and work for me.

36
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,089
[Evan] All right, so
why do you work here?

37
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,619
Your love of Halloween?

38
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,109
Hell no, Halloween
is the dumbest holiday.

39
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,119
I don't even know why people celebrate it.

40
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,729
It's like Easter, it looses
it's appeal once you get older.

41
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,690
[Evan] What are you talking about?

42
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,489
Easter rocks.

43
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,559
My mom still hides eggs in our
back yard on Easter Sunday,

44
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,393
and I love it.

45
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:32,069
Hell, I still color Easter eggs.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,569
It's a wonder you
don't have a girlfriend.

47
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,649
[Evan] Hey, you're just jealous

48
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,039
'cause I can color some
pretty bad ass eggs.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,439
Yeah, well, I wish I had a
couple of those eggs right now.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,990
There's a couple of people
I'd like to throw them at.

51
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,303
Am I one of them?

52
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:46,971
I'll let you know.

53
00:03:48,993 --> 00:03:50,279
Hey, excuse me.

54
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,259
Um, is this where the contest winners

55
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,239
are supposed to meet for
the haunted house outside?

56
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,159
Unfortunately, yes.

57
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,809
Sweet.

58
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,419
Man, I've been looking
forward to this forever.

59
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,359
Halloween and horror
are my life, you know?

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,729
I've actually seen just
about every horror film

61
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,199
that you could possibly imagine.

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,679
I've been to, like, every
haunted house so far this year.

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,439
Now, I don't know what it
is about blood and guts,

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,989
but (sighs) just gets me excited.

65
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,703
[Evan] Yeah, I can see that.

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,590
[Vincent] Huh?

67
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:21,479
(laughs) Evan.

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,799
I'm one of the contest winners, too.

69
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,269
[Vincent] Oh, hey, how's it goin'?

70
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,103
Vincent.

71
00:04:25,104 --> 00:04:26,579
So you're a horror buff, huh?

72
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,279
Yeah, I actually drove
an hour to get here.

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,569
When I heard about this contest,

74
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,369
and knew that there was a chance

75
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,439
that I could spend the night
locked in a haunted house,

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,729
I just had to put my name
in this contest, you know?

77
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,539
So you got a ticket for this house?

78
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,740
No, I don't believe
in that sort of thing.

79
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,639
You don't believe in what sort of thing?

80
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,099
Halloween, you know,
paying to go through

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,529
some cheesy plywood fun house,

82
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,749
watching people dress up
like their five years old,

83
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,650
stuff like that.

84
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:54,989
So, uh, this must be like winning

85
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,189
the lottery for you, huh?

86
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,549
Yeah, (sighs) my mom was
pissed when she found out

87
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,839
I entered in this contest.

88
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,449
You know, she thinks that
Halloween is for, like, misfits,

89
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,759
and, you know, people with
no time on their hands.

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,399
So if you ever see her,
don't tell her I'm here.

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,639
I told her I was staying at
a friend's house tonight.

92
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,463
I'll be sure to keep my mouth shut.

93
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,423
Oh, Christian.

94
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:20,669
(Christian sighs)
(Evan snickering)

95
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,589
You wouldn't happen to know anything about

96
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,529
why a customer complained
about one of my employees

97
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,779
refusing to help them, and
taking their name tag off

98
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,219
right in front of them, would you?

99
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,520
[Christian] No, I don't.

100
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,490
Just out of curiosity,
uh, where is your name tag?

101
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,443
Uh...

102
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,389
Must have fallen off.

103
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,299
Mm-hmm, look Christian,

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,246
I know Halloween isn't
your favorite time of year,

105
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:46,199
but the fact is that you're getting paid

106
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,759
to help the customers with their wants

107
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,769
and needs inside the store.

108
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,509
You're not getting paid
to lean on the counter,

109
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,739
and mope around.

110
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,043
You need to take a better
interest in your work.

111
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:01,214
(Christian sighs)

112
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,599
I bet if you showed a
little more enthusiasm,

113
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,189
you'd really start to enjoy your work,

114
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,199
and maybe even Halloween.

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,519
Every little positive thing you do

116
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,989
can really make a world of difference.

117
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,899
Not only for you, but for the customers.

118
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,969
Do you understand what I'm
trying to say, Christian?

119
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,803
Yeah.

120
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,783
Good.

121
00:06:17,784 --> 00:06:19,349
Well, as you may know,
I've been given the task

122
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,689
to work with The Shadow's
Edge Haunted House,

123
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,099
and I'll be in and out of the store

124
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,479
getting everything set up for tonight.

125
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,119
So I need you to be on your best behavior.

126
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,189
Can I count on you to do that?

127
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,023
You bet.

128
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,049
Hey, you're a lucky ticket holder.

129
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,189
Yeah, I am!

130
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,610
Slap it!

131
00:06:36,611 --> 00:06:39,874
[Evan] All right!

132
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,442
(Nick mumbles excitedly)

133
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:44,110
(ominous music)

134
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,823
How about him?

135
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:50,793
Ugh, no, ew.

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,939
Come on, this is the only way

137
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,679
into the house, tonight, with me.

138
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,793
I don't know.

139
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,259
Just go over there, and
turn on that sex appeal

140
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,959
like I know you can, baby.

141
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,036
I couldn't, he literally
looks like he would

142
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:06,903
hump my leg, if he could.

143
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,359
Look, listen, you said so yourself,

144
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,909
you want to come into this house with me

145
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,851
to have a little bit of, uh, fun.

146
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,349
So pop that chest out, lick those lips,

147
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,921
and, uh, seduce this
guy out of his ticket.

148
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,303
No, no, absolutely not.

149
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,383
You serious?

150
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:28,773
- Yeah.
- Fine, all right.

151
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,689
I'll do it, but you're
gonna have to appreciate me

152
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,040
a little bit more for this.

153
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,919
So my man, I notice you
got one of those tickets

154
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,149
into the house tonight.

155
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,419
Let's say I, uh, give you 20 bucks for it?

156
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,413
No, no, man.

157
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:55,791
How 'bout, uh...

158
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,829
How 'bout 40?

159
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,229
- Uh...
- 40 bucks.

160
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,569
I really want to go to this house.

161
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,820
Right, uh...

162
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,379
50, that's the highest.

163
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,029
50.
- No, man.

164
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,325
I just can't part with it.

165
00:08:08,326 --> 00:08:10,405
(sighs) Sorry.

166
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,479
All right, all right, check it out.

167
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,339
You see that chick
standing right over there?

168
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,359
[Creepy Guy] Yeah.

169
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,999
[Eli] She will do anything you want.

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,229
If you want to dress her
up like a little boy,

171
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,280
lick some frosting off her, or something?

172
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,213
She'll do it.

173
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,039
You know, honestly, though,

174
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,929
I don't find her all that attractive.

175
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,059
What, are you serious?
(creepy guy stammering)

176
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,069
Are you a little dog
fucker, what the fuck?

177
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,903
I don't.

178
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:39,391
(paper crinkling)
- Give me this.

179
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,308
Hey, hey.

180
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:45,059
(clapping)

181
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,559
I knew you'd do better than me.

182
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,393
Yeah, you just remember

183
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,710
about the little appreciation
you told me about.

184
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:58,022
I still don't get it.

185
00:08:58,023 --> 00:08:59,099
You don't get it?

186
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,329
How do you not get it?
- What nuts?

187
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,459
Like, I don't get it.
- The hell?

188
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,803
Like, what's the joke?
- Whoa.

189
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,193
What are you looking at?

190
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,293
Her.

191
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,169
Hi, can I help you?

192
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,909
Oh, no thanks.

193
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,429
Okay, well, I'm here
whenever you need help.

194
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,263
Thank you.

195
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:25,539
'Scuse me, guys.

196
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,239
Be right back.

197
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,859
What's he doin'?

198
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,363
Thinkin' with his penis.

199
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:37,507
Don't get it, you don't need that stuff.

200
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:38,699
Excuse me?

201
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,199
The clown makeup.

202
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,699
There's no way a gorgeous
girl like yourself

203
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,159
is gonna be covering her
pretty face with that garbage.

204
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,259
Actually, I'm not here
for a Halloween costume,

205
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,389
I'm just here killing time.

206
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,182
Oh, you got a hot date
next door at the cafe?

207
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:53,014
No, no.

208
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:56,789
I actually won a contest
to spend the night

209
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,379
out in the haunted house.

210
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,079
Oh, so you're a Halloween junkie.

211
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,289
Hardly, my friend said it would be funny

212
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,529
to enter me into this contest,
and wouldn't you know,

213
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,863
my name was drawn, and I won.

214
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,639
I'm really not too typically optimistic,

215
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,669
but I thought it was worth
coming and checking out,

216
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,069
and maybe the joke'll be on
them, and I'll have a good time.

217
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,933
[Christian] Yeah.

218
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,759
What about you, are you here

219
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,869
looking for a Halloween costume?

220
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,859
Me, no, I picked out
my costume weeks ago.

221
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,689
I'm actually here for
the haunted house, too.

222
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,680
I was chosen as a winner.

223
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,819
Oh, really?

224
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,422
Yeah, that haunted house
out there is, like, my heaven.

225
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:37,919
(laughs) Well, it looks like

226
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,449
we'll be spending the night together.

227
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,410
[Christian] I'm sorry?

228
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,669
Out in the haunted house?

229
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,493
[Christian] Oh, right, of
corse that's what you meant.

230
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,759
Well, I'm Abigail.

231
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,949
- Can I call you Abbie?
- Sure.

232
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,790
[Christian] I'm Christian.

233
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,899
Can I call you Chris?

234
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,830
[Christian] Well, you
could, but I won't answer.

235
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,369
(laughing quietly)

236
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,644
Nice to meet you, Christian.

237
00:10:57,645 --> 00:10:59,725
Nice to meet you.

238
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,139
(both laugh nervously)

239
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,439
Well, I have to go take
care of a few things,

240
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,636
but I guess I'll see you out
in the house, in a little bit.

241
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:07,885
[Abbie] Yeah, I'll
see you in a little bit.

242
00:11:07,886 --> 00:11:08,886
All right,

243
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,990
ta-ta.
- [Abbie] Bye.

244
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:14,999
Ta-ta?

245
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,833
Hey, shut up.

246
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,099
At least I talked to her.

247
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,133
Yeah, but ta-ta?

248
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,149
All right, a question for you, Einstein,

249
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,110
are you planning on continuing

250
00:11:22,111 --> 00:11:24,122
a conversation with her within the tent?

251
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:27,929
No, I'm gonna get inside.

252
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,549
How?

253
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,383
Give me your ticket.

254
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:32,279
Hell no, you don't even like Halloween.

255
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,869
So, we're good friends, right?

256
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,069
I've done a lot for you.

257
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,014
[Evan] Like what?

258
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:38,429
Um, (snaps) you remember that time

259
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,929
that you broke your mom's favorite vase?

260
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,279
I told her that I tripped and broke it.

261
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,113
I covered for you, man.

262
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:43,409
We were like eight years old,

263
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,288
and the next day you told my mom

264
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,988
that I put you up to lying for me.

265
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,850
Oh, come on, man.

266
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,750
I'll never ask you for anything again.

267
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:54,659
Fine.

268
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,343
Yeah, right. (laughs)

269
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,743
Sorry, man, you'll have to
kill me to get this ticket.

270
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,856
Fine, screw both of you.

271
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:08,524
(Evan and Vincent laughing)

272
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,929
There's gotta be a way I
can get into that house.

273
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,489
[Evan] Go talk to Nick.

274
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,289
I don't think Nick likes
me very much, right now.

275
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,269
Then you better go kiss some ass.

276
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,442
Okay, I have never kissed anyone's ass.

277
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:20,969
Then you better skip kissing his ass,

278
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,096
and go straight for his crotch area.

279
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:24,269
(Christian and Evan
conversing in the background)

280
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,949
Do you have a ticket for this house?

281
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,449
[Christian] Wish me luck.

282
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,759
Why else would I be standing here?

283
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,783
Touche. (laughs)

284
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,429
(clears throat) So I'm
thinking that you and I

285
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,189
should probably stick together
when we go inside this house,

286
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,499
just so, in case we get alone.

287
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,419
I mean, we are alone.

288
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,213
Because I don't want you to be alone.

289
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,499
I prefer to be alone.

290
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,779
It's how I entered this
dark, lonely world,

291
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,559
and it's how I'm going to
leave this dark, lonely world.

292
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,939
I've seen enough horror films to know

293
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,209
that you're as good as dead
if you're out by yourself.

294
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,659
You know, new place, all alone.

295
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,303
I'm just trying to look out for you.

296
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,430
What was your name?

297
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,229
Raven.

298
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,063
Raven, huh?

299
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,543
Yeah, why?

300
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,689
Do you have a problem with that?

301
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,559
Oh, no, I just never
heard the name Raven before.

302
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,393
It's unique.

303
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,119
Raven is the darkest bird out there,

304
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,499
but yet, has this purity about itself.

305
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,139
I like to feel like I'm a raven.

306
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,566
Dark and mysterious on the outside,

307
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:40,769
but so knowledgeable and
powerful on the inside.

308
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,133
You know, I know of a
couple porn stars named Raven.

309
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,893
Well, I'm Vincent.

310
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:51,449
And I am Woodpecker,
because I like to peck at...

311
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,799
Ow!

312
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,329
Well, anyways, I am getting very excited

313
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,459
to be going into this house with you.

314
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,410
You seem to be a very
beautiful and interesting girl.

315
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:09,292
A very interesting girl. (laughs)

316
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:12,126
(traffic zooming)

317
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,129
Excuse me.

318
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,739
Sorry, I'm looking for Cecil Smith.

319
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,983
I was told he's the guy
in charge of all this.

320
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,799
House doesn't open til tomorrow.

321
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Yeah, I know that.

322
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,779
You, uh, one of those
contestant winner people?

323
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,879
No, I'm from inside the store.

324
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,169
I was told I'd be out here to assist

325
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,793
with the sneak peak, tonight.

326
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:40,709
(spits)

327
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,748
Thank you.

328
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:48,899
Oh, by the way, I really
like your costume.

329
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,733
What are you supposed to be, like,

330
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:51,633
a dirty person from the South?

331
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,709
Sorry.

332
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,543
Prick.

333
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,993
Mr. Smith.

334
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,809
Hi, Nick Mangelsens, I'm
one of the managers here.

335
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,819
I just wanted to welcome
you guys to our store,

336
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,653
and to our town.

337
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:08,670
I didn't know we had
a welcome crew for us.

338
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,700
Is there a reason why you're
looking at me like that?

339
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:15,659
Oh, no, I just didn't
expect you to have the accent.

340
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,339
Oh, yes, God forbid an Englishman

341
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,540
charge of something
like this in the States.

342
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,099
Would you like me to get
you some tea and crumpets?

343
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,683
Would that make you feel better?

344
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,400
Nothing was meant by it, I'm sorry.

345
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,889
I'm sorry, I couldn't resist.

346
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,986
You never know what to expect down here.

347
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:36,149
You really had me goin' there.

348
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,319
Usually, we come into town,

349
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,520
and people look at us
as if we're murderers.

350
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,449
Excuse me a moment.

351
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,283
Waylon!

352
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,064
How many more times do I have to tell you

353
00:15:46,065 --> 00:15:48,763
to get off your ass and help around here?

354
00:15:48,764 --> 00:15:51,064
I've told you a hundred
times to do something!

355
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,719
I'm sorry about that.

356
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,650
Quite all right.

357
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:56,750
He's a little crazy.

358
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,593
Look, I appreciate your kindness,

359
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,709
but I have a full staff
who travel around me,

360
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,269
help me out.

361
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,423
I really don't think I
have any use for you.

362
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,519
Well, just look at me as your assistant.

363
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,279
If you need a water, just say,
"Hey, Nick, get me a water."

364
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,929
You know, if you want me to
dress up in a werewolf costume,

365
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,059
and hide inside of the house,
and jump out and scare people,

366
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,799
just say the word and I'll do it.

367
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,483
Your wish is my command.

368
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,730
Oh, what the hell.

369
00:16:24,731 --> 00:16:25,806
Welcome aboard.

370
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:27,183
Excellent!

371
00:16:27,184 --> 00:16:29,789
Is there anything you
need right now, Mr. Smith?

372
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,083
No, and call me Cecil.

373
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,776
I think I'm fine, thank you.

374
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:36,449
All right, well then, I
guess I'll head back inside,

375
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:37,709
and gather up the contestant winners,

376
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,599
and fill them in on things, and, uh,

377
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,069
we'll see you at sundown?

378
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,569
[Cecil] That you will.

379
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,919
See you then.

380
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,889
Oh, and remember, if you
need anything at all,

381
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:47,823
just shout for me.

382
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,589
Christian, what are you doing out here?

383
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,479
You need to be inside helping customers.

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,895
Sorry, Nick, but
this'll only take a sec.

385
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:58,698
(sighs) What is it, Christian?

386
00:16:58,699 --> 00:16:59,759
I'm kinda in a hurry, here.

387
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,889
Well, I was thinking about
what you told me about,

388
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,959
you know, taking more of
an interest in my work,

389
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,119
and Halloween, and whatnot.

390
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,709
So I thought, um, maybe I could

391
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,029
help out in the haunted house tonight,

392
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,219
you know, just as an extra set of hands.

393
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
I really think it could help me

394
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:13,810
get more into the Halloween spirit.

395
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,113
Why do I have the feeling

396
00:17:18,113 --> 00:17:19,029
you're setting me up for something?

397
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,862
I'm not!

398
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:22,649
I really think that this whole
haunted house thing is cool,

399
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,850
and I should embrace it.

400
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,003
I don't know.

401
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,329
Well, you see that guy over there?

402
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,489
- Yeah.
- That's Cecil Smith.

403
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,259
He's the owner of this place.

404
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,719
He'd be the guy to make
a decision like that.

405
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,039
Go talk to him.

406
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,629
Thanks, Nick.

407
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,679
Oh, hey, Christian.

408
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,580
[Christian] Yeah?

409
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:40,763
Feels good getting into the
Halloween season, doesn't it?

410
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:46,279
(Christian sighs)

411
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,979
(gate dragging)

412
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,713
So, this your baby, huh?

413
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,599
The house, I mean.

414
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,889
You own it?

415
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,240
Something like that, yes.

416
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:09,809
Do I know you?

417
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,023
No, actually, I work inside the store,

418
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:16,109
and I was curious about
this haunted house-thing,

419
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,999
and my manager sent me out here

420
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,759
to see if you could use any help.

421
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,133
[Cecil] My, this store
is pretty friendly.

422
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,703
So, is that a yes or a no on me helping.

423
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:32,669
I have a full staff.

424
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,099
I really don't want or
need a bunch of people

425
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,903
walking around inside here tonight.

426
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,833
Something could get broken, or worse.

427
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,030
Someone could get hurt.

428
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,509
It's the last thing I need at this point.

429
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,759
(ominous music)
It's a big enough risk

430
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,199
opening this thing up to the public,

431
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,300
with some of the things that we do inside.

432
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,429
It's only a matter of time

433
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,180
before someone gets seriously hurt.

434
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,959
I've actually been quite lucky

435
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,869
that no one has gotten hurt, so far.

436
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,939
I promise I'll be careful.

437
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,499
You're word means nothing to me,

438
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,613
considering I only met you a minute ago.

439
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:09,089
(sighs) You gotta let me in.

440
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,787
Why do I gotta let you in?

441
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,479
Halloween is my favorite holiday.

442
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,369
It's like my Christmas.

443
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,479
I work inside the store,

444
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,069
so I wasn't able to enter the contest

445
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,509
for the sneak peak tonight.

446
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,500
It's not fair.

447
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,269
Just 'cause I work inside the store,

448
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,489
and surround myself with
Halloween, and what I love,

449
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,199
I don't get to have fun
when something this amazing

450
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
comes to town for one night?

451
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,343
Look, kid,

452
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,693
if I let you in,

453
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,569
then I'd have to let in
everyone who asked me

454
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,789
if they could come inside the house.

455
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,740
It's just not fair.

456
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,523
Wait.

457
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,353
I guess it wouldn't hurt to
let you inside here, tonight.

458
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,338
We'll just act like you're
one of the VIP ticket holders.

459
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:53,319
(Christian laughs)

460
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,557
It could be our little secret.

461
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:56,223
This is so awesome, thank you!

462
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,677
But you can't tell
anyone that I let you in.

463
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,709
[Christian] I promise, I won't.

464
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,389
I'm being serious.

465
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,273
If you tell anyone, then
I'll have to kill you.

466
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:11,189
(Christian laughs and stammers)

467
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,049
[Christian] Good one.

468
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,003
Well, um...

469
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:16,709
[Christian] Oh, um, Christian.

470
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,173
Christian, it was nice meeting you.

471
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,593
[Christian] Nice to meet you.

472
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,729
But I have to get some work done

473
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,719
before I let you guys in here tonight.

474
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,659
Right.

475
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,493
Remember.

476
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:34,769
(old instrumental music)

477
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,610
So?

478
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm in.

479
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:38,009
How'd you manage that?

480
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,839
Can I have all the contestant winners

481
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,193
gather over by me, please.

482
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,509
Greetings, everyone.

483
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,859
I'll be one of your
hosts for this evening.

484
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,073
My name is Nicolas van Man-ghoul-sens,

485
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,819
and before we go inside the haunted house,

486
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,919
there are a few rules to go over.

487
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,433
No one is to touch
anything inside the house,

488
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,130
and everyone is to stay
together, unless told otherwise.

489
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,149
You wander away from the group,

490
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,033
you're likely to have the
blood sucked from your neck.

491
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:15,179
I need everyone to sign
these release forms

492
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,739
before we go inside.

493
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,359
What for?

494
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,219
Because once inside, we are the property

495
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,259
of The Shadow's Edge, and all the living

496
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,763
and non-living things inside.

497
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,279
If they want to eat your brains,

498
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,730
they're more than welcome to.

499
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:31,919
Now I'll need everyone to write legibly,

500
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,049
and have your IDs ready
before we go inside,

501
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,182
so we know you're giving us the real name,

502
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:37,409
and not some phony made up name.

503
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,059
Kind of like your phony made up name,

504
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,523
Nicolas van Man-ghoul-sens.

505
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,989
Everyone take the next few moments

506
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,190
to fill out these forms.

507
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,713
Oh, and one more thing.

508
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,489
Once inside, the exits
will be padlocked shut,

509
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,182
and there will be no way out.

510
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:56,369
Everyone will be locked inside

511
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,113
with all the demonic
creatures. (laughs maniacally)

512
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,729
I don't know if I can stand
being trapped in the house

513
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,707
with that guy all night long.

514
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,599
Maybe you're the one with the problem.

515
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,799
By the way, I wanted to ask you,

516
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,686
what are you gonna put down
as your name on your sheet?

517
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:21,836
My name, Raven.

518
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:26,837
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I
thought it was Crow, my bad.

519
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,779
What name are you putting down?

520
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,613
Dicklicker?

521
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,803
Funny, very, very funny.

522
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,989
So can I borrow that pen
when you're done with it?

523
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,890
Sure.

524
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,723
Thanks.

525
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,379
So did you drive yourself, today?

526
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,259
Or did a friend drop you
off, like, a girlfriend,

527
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,669
or a guy friend.

528
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,079
I drove myself.

529
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,330
[Christian] Cool, cool.

530
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,750
So do you live with yourself,

531
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,369
(Abbie laughing)
or you know, with a friend,

532
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,569
or maybe somebody who's
more than a friend? (laughs)

533
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,743
What, what's so funny?

534
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,469
Why don't you just ask me?

535
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,303
[Christian] Ask you what?

536
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:12,899
If I have a boyfriend?

537
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,759
Isn't that where this really uncomfortable

538
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,499
conversation is leading to?

539
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,023
No, it's just, it...

540
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,153
Fine, do you have a boyfriend?

541
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:23,459
No.

542
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,393
No, not right now.

543
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,599
Most guys, these days, are
just looking for a free ride.

544
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,900
[Christian] A free ride?

545
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,967
Oh, right, I get it.

546
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:35,129
But I'm not that kind of girl.

547
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,949
I like to make a guy
work for my affections.

548
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,650
[Christian] There's
nothing wrong with that.

549
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,299
Well, I'm not like most girls.

550
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,149
[Christian] I can see that.

551
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,759
Most girls wouldn't go
through something like this.

552
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,210
Really shows you're willing
to try anything once.

553
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,730
Yeah, I feel like I'm
like that most of the time.

554
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,219
[Christian] Maybe we
could hang out some time.

555
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,443
I'd like to put that theory to the test.

556
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,763
I think I'd like that.

557
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,509
(clears throat) Here's the
pen you wanted to borrow.

558
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,909
[Christian] Oh, thanks.

559
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,376
I'm gonna go turn this is in.

560
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:11,969
Um, I'll see you in a bit?

561
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,866
[Christian] See you soon.

562
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:13,699
Bye.

563
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:19,797
(ominous music)

564
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:20,631
(gate creaks)

565
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:22,019
Right this way, everyone.

566
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,909
Get excited, say trick or treat!

567
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,037
Trick or shut the fuck up!

568
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:29,288
(laughing)

569
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,819
(gate creaking)

570
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:37,082
(metal chinking)

571
00:24:39,966 --> 00:24:44,966
(ominous music)
(footsteps)

572
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,361
It smells like wood in here.

573
00:24:57,618 --> 00:25:00,035
(door slams)

574
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:06,003
(lock rattling)

575
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:12,842
(Halloween sound effects)

576
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,339
Welcome, everyone, to the study room.

577
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,203
Please, come in, come in.

578
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,893
This looks like something

579
00:25:21,894 --> 00:25:23,793
out of a children's public access show.

580
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,919
Don't touch anything.

581
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,420
[Christian] Okay, I'm sorry.

582
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,469
Damn fools have no manners, whatsoever.

583
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,063
Okay, I said I was sorry.

584
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,000
Hey, Vincent, I think I
found the perfect mate for you.

585
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,443
I think I found my perfect mate.

586
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,859
Please, there's no such
thing as a perfect mate.

587
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,159
Only someone that you can
tolerate to grow old with,

588
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,199
that doesn't make you want
to go on a shooting rampage,

589
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,169
and kill everything and everyone in sight.

590
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:24,899
When it's all over, you lay next to them,

591
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,543
and rot together underneath
the Earth's surface.

592
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,299
(Vincent laughs)

593
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,000
I love your idea of pillow talk.

594
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,996
(Raven sighs)

595
00:26:34,997 --> 00:26:35,830
(Sasha laughs)

596
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:36,869
Come on, babe.

597
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,399
Where are we going?

598
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,429
Let's go find a little
place where we can, uh...

599
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,169
Hmm?
(Sasha laughs)

600
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,807
Maybe we should wait a little bit.

601
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:46,199
(Eli sighs)

602
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,759
Come on, we've got all night.

603
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,979
But I don't want to wait.

604
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,509
Besides, I know how you get.

605
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,343
What?

606
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:53,176
You're gonna get tired,

607
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:54,815
and you're not gonna
be in the mood anymore.

608
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:57,779
I'm not really in the
mood right now, anyways.

609
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:01,409
Why, because of the company?

610
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,613
Well, kinda.

611
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,393
Well, what is it?

612
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,210
Eli, don't.

613
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:16,679
No, he's staring my girl down.

614
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,819
Come on, don't...

615
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,189
I ain't gonna let him stare
my girl down, like that.

616
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,140
I promise, if you don't, I'll
do that one thing you like.

617
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,875
(laughs) You know, when I...

618
00:27:29,021 --> 00:27:29,854
Go on.

619
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,799
Can I get a hell, yeah?
(Sasha laughing)

620
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,883
Hell, yeah!

621
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:39,522
(Sasha laughing)

622
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:50,339
Hey!
(metal thuds)

623
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,303
God damn it!

624
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,659
Don't you fucking kids listen?

625
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,069
But it's just a cup.

626
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,269
And you're just a dumb broad.

627
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:59,969
Hey, leave her alone.

628
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,079
What did you say, boy?

629
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,699
I said, leave her alone.

630
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,493
Or what?

631
00:28:04,494 --> 00:28:06,797
- I'll, I'll...
- Christian...

632
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:08,013
Enough, Waylon.

633
00:28:08,014 --> 00:28:11,514
(Halloween sound effects)

634
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,363
They were touching things, boss.

635
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,043
Waylon, we've been over
this a hundred times,

636
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,770
you have no say in anything
that goes on around here.

637
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,163
You are my employee,

638
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,446
and you will listen to what I have to say.

639
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,147
Now put the cup back on the shelf,

640
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,209
and go and stand over in
the corner until I need you.

641
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,043
Yes, sir.

642
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,290
I'm sorry about that, everyone.

643
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:55,143
Waylon sometimes gets a big head.

644
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,530
Hey, Christian, how are you?

645
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,969
Let me be the first to welcome you all

646
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,759
inside The Shadow's Edge Haunted House.

647
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,023
My name is Cecil Smith.

648
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,909
Have they all signed the forms?

649
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,781
Yeah, yeah, I have them right here.

650
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:18,532
(paper rustling)

651
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,743
Good, good.

652
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,713
We chose one lucky town
to come to to set up.

653
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,849
A lot of people ask us

654
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,863
why we only have it open for one night.

655
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,799
Why set up this tent, and go
through all that hard work

656
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,513
for one night a town?

657
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,453
Well, quite frankly, that's
all the time we need.

658
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,010
It only takes a few hours for everyone

659
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,363
to have the life scared out of them.

660
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,203
This is no ordinary haunted
house, this house is special.

661
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,999
The things that we do inside this house

662
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,143
mess with your minds.

663
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,880
You don't know what is real,

664
00:30:16,342 --> 00:30:17,313
or what is fake.

665
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:23,253
The blood that stains
these walls, these floors,

666
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,213
is it real?

667
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,003
Is it fake?

668
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,570
Let your minds decide.

669
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,833
People outside waiting to come through,

670
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,803
hear the screams from within,

671
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,840
and they don't know what to think.

672
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,980
Should they call for help?

673
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,820
Should they run away in fear,

674
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,140
that they could be the next
to possibly fall victim

675
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,623
to The Shadow's Edge?

676
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,663
Now some of you may be asking yourselves,

677
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,573
hey, Cecil, why is it
called The Shadow's Edge?

678
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,540
Because that's where the freaks play.

679
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,740
That's where reality and nightmares meet

680
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,640
to create a world so terrifying

681
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,390
that you don't know if this is real life,

682
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,263
or just fake.

683
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,433
Sure, you can scream for help.

684
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,380
Scream all you want,

685
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,303
but the truth is, you chose
to be part of this contest.

686
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,033
Now that you've won, you're
part of this nightmare.

687
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,390
There is no way out for you.

688
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,933
You're locked in.

689
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,133
Locked in with the freaks.

690
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,733
Freaks that have only
one thing on their minds,

691
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,143
torture.

692
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,083
I see by your faces that it's
all ready starting to set in.

693
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,343
Fear is in your mind.

694
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,616
Well before you have a
chance to ease your minds,

695
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:24,167
let me remind you of something,

696
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,380
this is new territory for you.

697
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,335
You don't know what is behind that door.

698
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:37,523
You have no idea what is
lurking in the shadows.

699
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:42,303
All you know is that you are mice

700
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,133
in this maze that I have created.

701
00:32:48,171 --> 00:32:52,588
This will be the most
interesting night of your life.

702
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,753
And what's even better,

703
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,030
those forms that you filled out,

704
00:32:59,734 --> 00:33:01,643
they allow us to do
anything we want with you.

705
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:07,458
(Cecil laughs)

706
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:13,143
There's no turning back now.

707
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,247
You're all in to the end.

708
00:33:23,549 --> 00:33:25,139
It's showtime.

709
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,839
Cecil Smith, hmm.
(Halloween sound effects)

710
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,553
Who is this man of darkness?

711
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:34,169
He sends freezing cold
shivers down my spine.

712
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,209
What I wouldn't do to spend a night

713
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,124
locked in a haunted house with him.

714
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,779
(laughs)

715
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,209
Well, who's ready to start this nightmare?

716
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,129
Let's get this party going?

717
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,989
Now remember to stay together,

718
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,123
and don't touch anything!

719
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:52,229
Ooh, yes!

720
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,699
Can you feel it in the air?
(Halloween sound effects)

721
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,650
That's Halloween, ladies and gentlemen.

722
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,183
One more thing, before
the real fun begins.

723
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,073
Everyone is to stay together,
unless otherwise informed.

724
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,290
You'll get your chance
to check things out,

725
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,410
but you do things my way, or else.

726
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,389
That's right, everyone.

727
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,799
You wander away from the group,

728
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,863
you're subject to have the
blood sucked from your neck.

729
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,799
Can you wander away from the group?

730
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,416
I'll second that.

731
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:29,215
I'm going to suck your blood.

732
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:30,049
Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha.

733
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,179
You know what, all
of you can kiss my ass.

734
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,039
I'm just trying to have a good time,

735
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,079
and get everyone into
the Halloween spirit,

736
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,729
and alls I've heard all night

737
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,049
is all of you mumbling under your breath,

738
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,169
and making fun of every
God damn word I say.

739
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,564
Every single one of you can piss off.

740
00:34:50,565 --> 00:34:53,215
I hope you all burn in hell,
and die in here tonight.

741
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,683
I'm outta here.

742
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,075
(Evan laughing)

743
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,160
Sons of bitches!
(mask clatters)

744
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:09,226
(Nick fumbling with door)

745
00:35:09,227 --> 00:35:12,458
Damn it, I need the damn key.

746
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:14,826
(ominous music)

747
00:35:14,827 --> 00:35:16,727
Hey, do you have the key to this lock?

748
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,206
Look, I don't have time for this,

749
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,193
do you have the key to this lock?

750
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,169
Listen, bitch, I just
wanna get out of here

751
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,819
before I do something I regret,

752
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,499
so for one last time,

753
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,893
do you have the key to this lock?

754
00:35:57,543 --> 00:35:59,463
(chain rattles)

755
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:02,853
(Nick choking)

756
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,719
(Nick gasping)

757
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,056
(chain clattering)

758
00:36:07,057 --> 00:36:10,224
(gagging and choking)

759
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:14,445
(heavy breathing)

760
00:36:19,103 --> 00:36:22,603
(shoes thumping on floor)

761
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:29,167
(bones crunching)
(chain rattling)

762
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,939
(chain clatters to the floor)

763
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,995
Get it, nuts?

764
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:37,448
(laughs) Like balls, right?

765
00:36:37,449 --> 00:36:38,879
(laughs) Yeah.

766
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,350
I didn't get it before, man.

767
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,127
Oh my God.

768
00:36:46,952 --> 00:36:48,269
Text from your girlfriend.

769
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,703
No, a text from my mom.

770
00:36:51,561 --> 00:36:53,069
I'm telling her I'm staying
at a friend's tonight.

771
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,049
Aw, you still let mommy
know where you're at.

772
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,629
Yes, I don't want her to worry.

773
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,889
I mean, she is the type that if I tell her

774
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,959
I'm going to the store, and
I'll be back in 20 minutes,

775
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,909
she'll start worrying after 21 go by.

776
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,910
Ah, so, um, why are you
lying about where you're at.

777
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,529
'Cause if I tell her I'm here,
she's not gonna believe me.

778
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,659
Then she'll stay up all
night worrying about me.

779
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,759
You really are a
momma's boy, aren't you?

780
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,229
Hey, shut up.

781
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,930
You don't know me well
enough to make fun of me.

782
00:37:18,931 --> 00:37:20,489
Well, in all honesty,

783
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,729
I think it's kinda cute.
(ominous music)

784
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,839
Really?

785
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,673
Yeah.

786
00:37:25,674 --> 00:37:27,970
Okay, everyone, will you
please come over this way?

787
00:37:29,586 --> 00:37:30,886
The fun is about to start.

788
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:44,062
(ominous music)

789
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,099
(Halloween sound effects)

790
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,253
I told all of you

791
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:55,769
that you would get the chance
to roam around this house,

792
00:37:57,427 --> 00:37:59,849
and you have also been forewarned

793
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,250
about the dangers that
lurk around every corner.

794
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,333
But right now, we have a
special treat for one you.

795
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:16,533
Ah, how about this lovely
young lady, right here?

796
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,389
I promise not to bite hard, sweet heart.

797
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,979
I'm more of an observer.

798
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,580
No one is an observer tonight.

799
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,703
You are all my prey.

800
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,053
Trust me, take my hands.

801
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,039
(indistinct)

802
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,850
(laughing)

803
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:39,809
(thump)
- Oh!

804
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,643
Fine.

805
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,876
And what might your name be, my sweet?

806
00:38:43,877 --> 00:38:45,274
Sasha.

807
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:48,209
Sasha, what a beautiful name.

808
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,409
Thank you.

809
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,749
You're a very attractive lady.

810
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:54,389
I take it that you're
into fashion and makeup,

811
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,885
and all that glamor stuff.

812
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:57,613
Well, looks like this don't come easy.

813
00:38:57,614 --> 00:39:00,622
(men whistling and catcalling)

814
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:03,119
What if I told you that
we had some makeup artists

815
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,039
inside the house tonight?

816
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,869
Would that make you happy?

817
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,489
I guess.

818
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,323
Excellent.

819
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,659
Sasha, my darling, Waylon, here,

820
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,710
is going to take you for a special treat.

821
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:19,289
You're going to get a makeover,
as you've never had before,

822
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,819
and it's all curtesy of The Shadow's Edge.

823
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,463
Don't be afraid, take his hand.

824
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,210
He isn't going to do
anything to you, I promise.

825
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,506
That's it, now take her away.
(Halloween sound effects)

826
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:36,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait, wait, wait.

827
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,369
Relax.

828
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,199
I don't want her leaving my sight.

829
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,543
Well, unfortunately,
you can't go with her.

830
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,049
There's only room for one, you see.

831
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,350
I'll be right back, hon.

832
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,770
Now, as for the rest of you,

833
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,693
won't you all follow me as
I take you on a little tour.

834
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,906
About time.

835
00:40:04,907 --> 00:40:07,240
(footsteps)

836
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:13,083
So, uh, need a hand to hold on to?

837
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,369
There is no hand in
this world worth holding,

838
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,173
especially not yours.

839
00:40:22,304 --> 00:40:23,813
Would a simple no have killed you?

840
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:33,011
(ominous circus music)
(Halloween sound effects)

841
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:42,472
(clowns snickering menacingly)

842
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,979
[Waylon] Go.
(slap)

843
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,769
Don't you ever touch me
again, you fucking pig.

844
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,296
You watch that pretty
little mouth of yours.

845
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:50,550
Get off me!

846
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:53,634
(restraints clatter)

847
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:56,151
Let me out...

848
00:40:56,152 --> 00:40:58,735
(Sasha crying)

849
00:41:36,391 --> 00:41:39,308
(Sasha whimpering)

850
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,992
They'll make you so pretty.

851
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:53,576
(Sasha crying)

852
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:00,349
Perfect.

853
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:07,588
God damn, you're beautiful.

854
00:42:08,399 --> 00:42:09,316
Stay still.

855
00:42:12,037 --> 00:42:13,563
I want this to be special.

856
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,478
(thud)
Ah!

857
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:15,478
God damn it!

858
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:19,138
You stupid bitch!

859
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:22,139
(breathing heavily)

860
00:42:36,004 --> 00:42:38,754
(clown snickers)

861
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:43,025
(scissors snipping)

862
00:42:50,346 --> 00:42:52,929
(Sasha crying)

863
00:42:54,827 --> 00:42:56,410
Well, it's too bad.

864
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,908
We could have been something special.

865
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:07,750
Now I'm gonna have to make
you look like one of us.

866
00:43:07,774 --> 00:43:10,749
(laughing)

867
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,137
(Sasha screaming)

868
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:14,998
What the hell was that?

869
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:16,379
All part of the experience.

870
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,519
Nothing to worry about.

871
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,529
No, that sounded like Sasha.

872
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,430
Where are you going?

873
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,619
To see if my girlfriend's all right.

874
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,899
I assure you, she's just fine.

875
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,250
She's getting special
VIP treatment, right now.

876
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,696
I promise you, everything
is going to be just fine.

877
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:37,197
(Halloween sound effects)

878
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,479
Remember the rule of not touching anything

879
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,473
inside this house?

880
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,199
Yeah, I just thought I saw some dust,

881
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,783
and I was gonna dust it off for you.

882
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,729
Man, can't believe how much crap

883
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:07,919
they actually cram into this tent.

884
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,129
You're calling all this crap? (laughs)

885
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,179
Just seems like such a waste

886
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,709
to have all this stuff
set up for one night,

887
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,967
don't you think?

888
00:44:14,968 --> 00:44:16,612
I don't know.

889
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,049
I mean, I guess if you're really
passionate about something,

890
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,069
that makes it worth it,

891
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,829
and some people are so
passionate about things

892
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,019
that they're willing
to do anything for it.

893
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,879
[Christian] What about you?

894
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,899
What about me?

895
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,579
[Christian] Do you have
any passions in life?

896
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,199
I have lots of passions?

897
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,539
[Christian] Anything
you'd do anything for?

898
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,889
Some.

899
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,029
Well, name one,

900
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,380
just to give me an example.

901
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,869
All right, well, I
guess, I'd have to say

902
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,879
that I'm passionate about
becoming an actress.

903
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,359
- An actress, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

904
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,439
What kind of actress?

905
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,969
What do you mean, what kind of actress?

906
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:55,970
Oh, you know, like, TV
actress, stage actress? (laughs)

907
00:44:56,179 --> 00:44:58,319
Hmm, I guess...

908
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,959
I guess I would like
to be a stage actress.

909
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,039
You know, I never would have pegged you

910
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,059
as the actress type.

911
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,909
Oh, and what would
you have pegged me as?

912
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,599
Well, if I had to go with
my first impression of you,

913
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,673
I'd say, quiet type.

914
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,789
You know, innocent little girl,

915
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:17,009
and in high school, sat in the back,

916
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:19,649
and kept her head down,
didn't cause any trouble.

917
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,479
Always did what mommy and daddy told her,

918
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,949
never caused any problems.
- (laughing) Oh, God.

919
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,159
Perfect little angel.

920
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,233
(laughs) That's what you thought I was?

921
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:30,119
Yeah, and I have to say,

922
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,289
even after talking to you for a little,

923
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,729
I think that's partially true.

924
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,889
You know, I think you're a rather shy

925
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,259
and to herself kind of girl.
- (laughs) Okay, okay, okay.

926
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,443
Well, let me let you
in on a little secret.

927
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:43,116
Come here.

928
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:46,327
I'm not as innocent as I look.

929
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,143
Can I help you with something?

930
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,523
What happened to your face?

931
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,959
I was in a car accident
when I was younger,

932
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,210
and I went face-first
through the windscreen.

933
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,733
Did it hurt?

934
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,370
What do you think?

935
00:46:22,423 --> 00:46:25,206
(sighs) So, doesn't this
remind you of something

936
00:46:25,207 --> 00:46:27,063
out of an '80s horror film?

937
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:30,659
Is that all you do with your existence,

938
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:32,999
is watch horror films?

939
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,973
No, I also watch porn.

940
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,909
Ugh.

941
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:39,743
What?

942
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,679
(clears throat) So are we gonna get

943
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,999
to roam around on our own?

944
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,653
I'm about ready to fall asleep.

945
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,529
[Evan] Yeah, this is pretty lame.

946
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,509
I've got a neighbor that
does one out of his garage,

947
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,782
and that's scarier than this.

948
00:46:56,783 --> 00:46:59,399
(sighs) I have to agree.
(Halloween sound effect)

949
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,499
Can't we go back to the makeover?

950
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,781
I've been dying to have
an afternoon like that.

951
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:07,469
(laughs softly)

952
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,783
You guys have no idea
what you're in for.

953
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:11,999
Everything I told you
(Halloween sound effects)

954
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,923
About this haunted house is true.

955
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,359
That's funny 'cause I
don't remember you saying

956
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,103
this haunted house blows ass.

957
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:21,803
What, dude?

958
00:47:21,804 --> 00:47:24,089
Look, all I know is that when
I signed up for this contest,

959
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:27,089
it sounded like we were gonna
be able to roam around freely,

960
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,833
and we haven't been able
to do a thing like that.

961
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:35,459
If you want to roam freely
throughout this haunted house,

962
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,047
all you have to do is ask.

963
00:47:37,973 --> 00:47:39,873
Can I roam around the haunted house?

964
00:47:41,629 --> 00:47:42,462
Of corse.

965
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:43,295
Thank God.

966
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,749
Finally.

967
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:47,099
Wait, Raven!

968
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,953
I, uh, don't want you to be alone.

969
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,193
Fuck this, I'm out of here.

970
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,869
[Evan] Hey, Christian,
you want to head off, too,

971
00:47:57,870 --> 00:47:59,339
and check out this place?

972
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,173
No, man.

973
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,119
[Evan] What?

974
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,953
Abbie.

975
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:06,550
What about her?

976
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,320
We're gonna go off by ourselves.

977
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,221
Nice, give me some!

978
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,139
(Christian laughs)

979
00:48:17,013 --> 00:48:18,899
- [Christian] Hey.
- Hey.

980
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,369
Which way you headed?

981
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,679
I don't know, but I don't
want to head off by myself.

982
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,762
Would you like some company?

983
00:48:23,763 --> 00:48:28,109
I'd love it. (laughs)

984
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,410
For someone who thinks
this place is boring,

985
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,330
and wanted to go and explore the place,

986
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,039
you're sure spending a lot
of time in the same room.

987
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,289
Yeah, I just thought I'd hang out here,

988
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,569
and let everyone else get a head start

989
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,219
on checking out the place.

990
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,259
Besides, I thought I'd, uh,

991
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,810
touch all the pictures in
this room when you leave.

992
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,707
Don't think I don't know
sarcasm when I hear it.

993
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,769
But you've got to be the biggest smart ass

994
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,050
that I've ever known,

995
00:48:58,497 --> 00:49:00,123
and I promise you this,

996
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:03,903
if you touch anything
else inside this house,

997
00:49:05,573 --> 00:49:06,406
I'll kill you.

998
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,602
Oh, I get it, now you're
the one being a smart ass.

999
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:13,503
(laughs) I get it.

1000
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,500
Now, if you excuse me,

1001
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,370
I have some business to attend to.

1002
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,860
[Evan] See you, See-cil.

1003
00:49:25,617 --> 00:49:27,509
It's Cecil.

1004
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,110
[Evan] Catch you later, Cecil.

1005
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:49,162
(door scraping)
(ominous music)

1006
00:49:56,146 --> 00:49:57,487
(door scraping)

1007
00:49:57,488 --> 00:49:59,405
(thud)

1008
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,293
(door scraping)

1009
00:50:09,337 --> 00:50:11,004
Hm, hungry, Abbie?

1010
00:50:13,529 --> 00:50:16,799
Mm, you know, as
delicious as that looks,

1011
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,899
I think I'm gonna pass.

1012
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,463
Whatever, you're missing out.

1013
00:50:22,126 --> 00:50:24,899
Man, you gotta have a
lot of time on your hands

1014
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,600
to think of all this creepy
stuff for a haunted house.

1015
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,449
[Abbie] I don't know, I
think it's kind of creative.

1016
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:32,883
Creative, I think
it's borderline psycho.

1017
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,459
(knife scraping)

1018
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,363
Well, that's hot.

1019
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,153
Oh, yeah?

1020
00:50:38,153 --> 00:50:39,000
You think so?

1021
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:40,859
Yeah, the only thing that's missing

1022
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,389
is some blood all over the knife.

1023
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:43,709
Well, come here and give me some blood.

1024
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,741
Hey, (Abbie laughing)

1025
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:45,809
Take it easy, you're gonna hurt somebody.

1026
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,043
I want some of your blood.

1027
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,711
(both laughing)

1028
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,287
Let's go check out some
of the other rooms.

1029
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,533
Come on, work.

1030
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,053
Sasha, you in here, babe?

1031
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,459
Sasha, quit being the
little bitch you are,

1032
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,810
and come on out, all ready!

1033
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:28,782
(picture rattles)

1034
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:30,115
God damn clowns.

1035
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:32,441
(creaking)

1036
00:51:32,441 --> 00:51:33,274
Who's there?

1037
00:51:37,864 --> 00:51:39,779
(ominous music)

1038
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,100
Shit, man.

1039
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,820
Fucking gave me a fucking heart attack.

1040
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,339
Where's Sasha?

1041
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:48,173
Who?

1042
00:51:48,174 --> 00:51:50,489
My girlfriend, the
one you took with you.

1043
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:51,950
Oh, right, uh...

1044
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,743
She's, uh, she's back that way.

1045
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:06,740
(box creaking)

1046
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,123
Raven, where'd you go?

1047
00:52:15,483 --> 00:52:17,853
Man, that girl is playing hard to get,

1048
00:52:19,211 --> 00:52:20,111
and I'm loving it.

1049
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,703
Oh, speaking of loving
it, this is awesome.

1050
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,333
Huh.

1051
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,393
Whoa, kick ass.

1052
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:56,537
(scissors slicing)

1053
00:52:56,538 --> 00:52:58,889
Ah, you cut me!

1054
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:00,659
What the hell is the matter with you?

1055
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,859
Don't touch my doll.

1056
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,479
Yeah, well, don't
play with sharp objects.

1057
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,429
Give me those scissors!

1058
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,024
I said, give the to me.

1059
00:53:07,025 --> 00:53:08,400
No.

1060
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:13,401
(Vincent grunts)
(ominous music)

1061
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:15,790
(footsteps)

1062
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,222
What's going on in here?

1063
00:53:20,223 --> 00:53:21,659
Your little friend, here, just cut me

1064
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,819
with those scissors in her hand.

1065
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,123
What have I told you about
playing with these scissors?

1066
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:29,820
Give me those scissors,

1067
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:31,770
and go wait outside in the hall for me.

1068
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,153
Let me see.

1069
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,619
Look, I understand you wanting to give

1070
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,849
the ultimate scare, and all,

1071
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,709
but having little girls run
around with sharp scissors,

1072
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:52,563
cutting into people's arms,
isn't my idea of a fun time.

1073
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,129
It's just a scrape.
(Halloween sound effects)

1074
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,778
Look, I'll tell you what,

1075
00:53:57,779 --> 00:54:00,089
I've got some bandages in
one of the control rooms

1076
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,490
that Waylon can get for you.

1077
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,803
Good.

1078
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,079
What are you gonna do
about the little girl?

1079
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,729
[Cecil] Oh, I'll handle her.

1080
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,580
She knows better.

1081
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:13,746
She'll get a stern talking to.

1082
00:54:13,747 --> 00:54:16,019
Yeah, and maybe a spanking
wouldn't hurt her, either.

1083
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,370
I said I'll deal with it.

1084
00:54:18,323 --> 00:54:20,309
Now, if you can find your
way back to the study room,

1085
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:22,923
where we first met up,
I'll send Waylon your way.

1086
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,730
I'm going to have a word with
the young lady, right now.

1087
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,059
Young girl, what have I told you

1088
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,010
about playing with these scissors, hmm?

1089
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,979
This is not a toy,

1090
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,829
this is a very serious and sharp tool,

1091
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,633
and can do some serious damage.

1092
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,229
Now what happens when I take
a pair of scissors like this,

1093
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,823
and I cut someone's arm, hmm?

1094
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:56,906
[Little Girl] They get cut.

1095
00:54:56,907 --> 00:54:59,707
And what happens when someone
gets a cut on their arm?

1096
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:02,039
[Little Girl] They bleed.

1097
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,840
How much do they bleed?

1098
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,663
I said, how much do they bleed?

1099
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,192
[Little Girl] Not very much.

1100
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:12,749
(sighs) How many more
times do I have to tell you?

1101
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,549
If you're going to cut someone,

1102
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,429
you do it either here, or here.

1103
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:19,889
Never, ever cut their arm.

1104
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,253
Not unless you have a bigger,
sharper pair of scissors, hmm?

1105
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:28,021
(sighing)

1106
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:32,793
I know you're young, I
know you're still learning.

1107
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,650
I know, some day, you'll
get all this stuff down.

1108
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,110
You have potential,

1109
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:42,363
and one day you'll make better decisions.

1110
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,399
Now where's that pretty
little smile of yours

1111
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,229
that I like to see, hmm?

1112
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,339
That's it.

1113
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,010
Now, go on, get out of here.

1114
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,469
Well, I learned that lesson
(Halloween sound effects)

1115
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:59,863
A long time ago.

1116
00:55:59,864 --> 00:56:01,442
(scissors snipping)

1117
00:56:01,443 --> 00:56:04,473
Ooh, mine still has some blood on it.

1118
00:56:08,055 --> 00:56:08,888
Hmm.

1119
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:11,064
(Halloween sound effects)
- [Abbie] I thought there were

1120
00:56:11,065 --> 00:56:13,649
so-called monsters in here that
were supposed to be hiding,

1121
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:15,989
and jump out and scare us. (laughs)

1122
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:18,233
Maybe they fell asleep
'cause they were bored.

1123
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:25,643
What?

1124
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:28,763
Screw it.

1125
00:56:31,553 --> 00:56:32,720
Uh, I'm sorry.

1126
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:36,663
It just felt right.

1127
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,820
That was incredible.

1128
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,630
I'm not usually like this.

1129
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,060
Well, I'm glad you're like that with me.

1130
00:57:00,648 --> 00:57:03,231
Come on, let's get out of here.

1131
00:57:07,026 --> 00:57:12,026
(ominous music)
(Halloween sound effects)

1132
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:30,377
Hello?

1133
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:32,044
Babe, where are you?

1134
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:36,000
Baby, where are you?

1135
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:40,291
Who is this?

1136
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:45,029
Ah, damn it!

1137
00:57:55,131 --> 00:57:57,714
(tape ripping)

1138
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:04,559
You know, for such a
dark and isolated person,

1139
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,063
you do have a tender touch.

1140
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,129
(slap)

1141
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,963
Ow.

1142
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:17,129
So I bet everything that
I'm saying right now

1143
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,839
is turning you on.

1144
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:21,659
It's getting you all wound up and excited.

1145
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,609
You're just ready to explode with emotion.

1146
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,093
You're just looking for
something to take it out on.

1147
00:58:27,688 --> 00:58:28,521
You probably want to take me

1148
00:58:28,522 --> 00:58:29,940
right here, right now, don't you?

1149
00:58:34,728 --> 00:58:36,728
(thump)

1150
00:58:39,069 --> 00:58:40,949
Ah! (laughs nervously)

1151
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,223
Is that what you wanted?

1152
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:43,229
(Vincent laughs)

1153
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:44,907
Uh, yeah..

1154
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:47,793
I want you, right here.

1155
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,364
Right here?

1156
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:51,198
Here.

1157
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:53,160
In front of him?

1158
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,483
Yeah.

1159
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,300
I've got an idea.

1160
00:59:02,046 --> 00:59:05,046
(hurried footsteps)

1161
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,980
So I see those two are still alive.

1162
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,393
So what's the update on the rest of them?

1163
00:59:21,278 --> 00:59:22,993
I don't know.

1164
00:59:22,994 --> 00:59:25,232
(ominous music)

1165
00:59:25,233 --> 00:59:27,779
When our Sissy passed away,

1166
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,749
I promised her I'd look after you,

1167
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,593
but you are about to join her.

1168
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,949
Now get out there and do your job,

1169
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,400
before those kids start
sniffing around too much.

1170
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,489
It's the room where
that little girl cut me.

1171
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,390
Thought we could make use of this bed.

1172
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:54,110
Oh!

1173
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,889
Wait, you want to do this
on the little girl's bed?

1174
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,419
It's not like she really lives here,

1175
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,549
she's just an actor pretending.

1176
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,259
But what if she comes back in?

1177
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:08,250
She's not coming back in,

1178
01:00:08,251 --> 01:00:10,229
she's all ready got in
trouble for cutting my arm.

1179
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,513
Now come on, let's do this all ready.

1180
01:00:15,227 --> 01:00:17,727
(Raven sighs)

1181
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:23,973
Ah, ah, ah, ow, ow, ow!

1182
01:00:26,233 --> 01:00:27,986
(laughs) What, did I hurt you?

1183
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:29,133
You little baby.

1184
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,419
No, no, it's just, uh, fine, baby.

1185
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,213
I just wasn't expecting
you to chow down on my lip.

1186
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,792
Ow, jeez, what you do that for?

1187
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:51,763
(laughs) Just go with it.

1188
01:01:00,467 --> 01:01:02,776
Baby, you are a freak.

1189
01:01:02,777 --> 01:01:04,194
[Raven] Mm-hmm.

1190
01:01:07,183 --> 01:01:09,850
(ominous music)

1191
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:28,112
(scissors stabbing)

1192
01:01:28,113 --> 01:01:30,742
(Vincent screaming)

1193
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:33,576
(Raven screaming)

1194
01:01:35,403 --> 01:01:36,236
What was that?

1195
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:37,486
I don't know.

1196
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,488
(scampering footsteps)

1197
01:01:47,934 --> 01:01:49,309
(door slams open)

1198
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:50,557
Ah, oh Jesus Christ!

1199
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:53,391
(Raven screaming)

1200
01:01:56,531 --> 01:01:58,771
Somebody help me!

1201
01:01:58,772 --> 01:02:00,689
(thud)

1202
01:02:08,948 --> 01:02:10,589
Please, don't hurt me.

1203
01:02:10,590 --> 01:02:13,596
(Raven sobbing)

1204
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:15,262
(head exploding)

1205
01:02:15,263 --> 01:02:18,013
(blood dripping)

1206
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:23,865
(hammer thudding)

1207
01:02:25,258 --> 01:02:26,643
What the fuck?

1208
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:29,107
(grunting)

1209
01:02:29,108 --> 01:02:31,358
(smashing)

1210
01:02:35,378 --> 01:02:37,545
(yelling)

1211
01:02:41,386 --> 01:02:42,985
(door slamming)

1212
01:02:42,986 --> 01:02:45,236
(grunting)

1213
01:02:54,391 --> 01:02:56,246
(running footsteps)

1214
01:02:56,247 --> 01:02:57,462
- [Eli] Go!
- Whoa, whoa, what's up?

1215
01:02:57,463 --> 01:02:58,296
Just go!

1216
01:02:58,296 --> 01:02:59,129
[Christian] What happened?

1217
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,462
[Eli] Come on!

1218
01:03:05,845 --> 01:03:08,012
(Eli breathing heavily)

1219
01:03:08,013 --> 01:03:09,641
Eli, tell us what's going on.

1220
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:11,692
(Eli breathing heavily)
Eli, talk to us!

1221
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,819
This place, it's, uh...

1222
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,559
Some-something's...

1223
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,669
Something's, something's not right.

1224
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,503
Something's going on.

1225
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,336
What?

1226
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,561
Look, just tell us what's going on.

1227
01:03:20,562 --> 01:03:22,379
He just killed her.

1228
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,549
Killed who?

1229
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,159
I don't, uh, the gothic looking chick.

1230
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,269
What, Raven?

1231
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,949
- Yeah.
- Wait, somebody killed Raven?

1232
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:29,783
Ugh.

1233
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,689
Are you sure she was killed?

1234
01:03:33,690 --> 01:03:35,399
I mean, it's not an act, or something?

1235
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,783
It's a haunted house, dude!

1236
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:40,859
You think I don't know what I just saw?

1237
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,589
He took a frickin'
sledgehammer to her head.

1238
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,209
Wait, wait, you're starting...

1239
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,399
You're starting to freak me out.

1240
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,017
[Christian] Look, who killed her?

1241
01:03:49,018 --> 01:03:52,713
I don't know, it was some big guy.

1242
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:56,669
He had long hair, looks like
he didn't shower in years.

1243
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,503
Where is he?

1244
01:03:58,350 --> 01:03:59,183
I...

1245
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,103
I stabbed him.

1246
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,779
I want out of here, we need
to get the hell out of here.

1247
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,459
We'll get out of here, just calm down.

1248
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:10,859
Ah, I don't believe this.

1249
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,019
Maybe we should call the police, first.

1250
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,451
[Abbie] Where is it?

1251
01:04:14,452 --> 01:04:16,739
I don't know, I had it before.

1252
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,670
Where's your cell phone?

1253
01:04:17,671 --> 01:04:18,839
I don't carry a cell phone.

1254
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,490
Who doesn't carry a cell phone?

1255
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,380
Well, Eli, let's use yours.

1256
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:23,220
No, screw that.

1257
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:24,299
My girlfriend is somewhere in here,

1258
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,859
and I'm not leaving til I find her.

1259
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,509
Wait, are you crazy?

1260
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,363
There's a killer out there,

1261
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,839
and you want to look for
your girlfriend by yourself?

1262
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,099
You need to get your hands off me.

1263
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,116
We need to find a way out of here.

1264
01:04:33,117 --> 01:04:35,039
And you need to get out of my way.

1265
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,779
Fine, give me your cell phone.

1266
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:37,961
I said get out of my way.

1267
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:40,712
- Don't shove me!
- Boys, stop it!

1268
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:45,419
Look, you guys can do
whatever the hell you guys want.

1269
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:47,249
I'm gonna go find Sasha.

1270
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,379
[Christian] We shouldn't
leave each other.

1271
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:51,989
Listen, I don't care
for either one of you.

1272
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,519
All I know is someone just got killed,

1273
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,009
and my girlfriend is still
in here somewhere, alone.

1274
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:58,010
I'm gonna do whatever I can to find her.

1275
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:00,989
Going somewhere?

1276
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:03,149
What kind of messed up
house do you have here?

1277
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:05,450
I just saw some chick
get her face smashed in.

1278
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,009
I think you better calm down.

1279
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,179
I think you need to tell me exactly

1280
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:10,649
what the hell's going on here.

1281
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:12,479
I told you before,

1282
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,370
what's inside these walls lives...

1283
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:16,679
(fist thudding)

1284
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,880
You better hope nothing
happened to Sasha.

1285
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,899
Are you all right?

1286
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,733
I'm fine.

1287
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:25,829
Cecil, we need to get
out of here and get help.

1288
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,724
Do you have the key to get out of here?

1289
01:05:27,725 --> 01:05:29,516
Yes, it's right here.

1290
01:05:29,517 --> 01:05:31,739
All right, let's go.

1291
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,119
[Cecil] Wait,

1292
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,909
there's something we
have to do before we go.

1293
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:38,469
What?
(ominous music)

1294
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:39,813
(Christian grunting)
(Abbie screaming)

1295
01:05:39,814 --> 01:05:41,605
Let go of me!

1296
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:43,204
(thud)

1297
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,852
Stop, stop hitting him!

1298
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:47,520
(Abbie sobbing)

1299
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,489
I bet the two of you
have a million questions

1300
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:52,606
running through your heads right now.

1301
01:05:52,607 --> 01:05:54,185
You won't get away with this.

1302
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:57,801
[Cecil] (laughs) I
all ready have, my boy.

1303
01:05:57,802 --> 01:05:59,939
I all ready have.

1304
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:03,629
You see, if word gets
out that something fishy

1305
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,279
was going on inside this house,

1306
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:09,179
I just act like one of the
contestant winners snapped,

1307
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,279
and went on a killing rampage,

1308
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,863
killing everyone inside the haunted house.

1309
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:18,959
And then I'll give
myself a few little cuts

1310
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,899
to make it look as it
the killer turned on me,

1311
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:24,723
and when I get interviewed
by the police and media,

1312
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:28,349
I'll just say how unfortunate it was

1313
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,401
that this had to happen, and
how I feel for the families

1314
01:06:32,402 --> 01:06:36,239
and the victims, yadda, yadda, yadda.

1315
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,603
And the next thing you
know, I'm on my way.

1316
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,363
It's perfect.

1317
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:44,849
What did we do to you?

1318
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,759
[Cecil] (laughs) Why
does everything have to be

1319
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,203
done for a reason, huh?

1320
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:51,985
Did you ever stop to think

1321
01:06:51,986 --> 01:06:53,459
that there are sick people out there

1322
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,123
who just enjoy torturing and
killing other people, huh?

1323
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,109
[Christian] You're sick.

1324
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:02,193
You bet I am.

1325
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:06,530
Take them to their separate rooms.

1326
01:07:16,637 --> 01:07:18,396
(quiet whimpering)

1327
01:07:18,397 --> 01:07:20,209
Oh my God, no.

1328
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:23,666
No, no, babe?
(coughing and crying)

1329
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,917
Babe, what happened to you?

1330
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,639
(Sasha coughing and crying)

1331
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,473
Oh my God.

1332
01:07:33,565 --> 01:07:35,378
I'm gonna get whoever did this.

1333
01:07:35,379 --> 01:07:37,132
I'm gonna fucking kill him.

1334
01:07:37,133 --> 01:07:39,633
(both crying)

1335
01:07:40,845 --> 01:07:44,033
I love you so much.
(ominous music)

1336
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:45,727
(flesh squelching)

1337
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,811
(suspenseful music)

1338
01:08:26,498 --> 01:08:28,748
(thudding)

1339
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:39,659
My mother told me
that when I was little,

1340
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:41,073
I was fascinated with blood.

1341
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:45,179
Wait, don't kill me.

1342
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:47,230
Let me go, I won't tell anyone about this.

1343
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,192
(Cecil laughing)

1344
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:52,109
Oh, you kids are so dumb these days.

1345
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:54,419
Do you think I'm going to kill you?

1346
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,820
No, where's the fun in that?

1347
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,567
I'm just going to torture you,

1348
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,131
and then I'll let Waylon, here, kill you.

1349
01:09:02,132 --> 01:09:04,929
(Cecil chuckles)

1350
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,779
Don't touch me, asshole!

1351
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,159
Can one of you get his feet for me?

1352
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:09,063
Thanks.

1353
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,613
Now hold him tight.

1354
01:09:18,835 --> 01:09:20,215
(Christian yelling)

1355
01:09:20,216 --> 01:09:25,216
(Christian gasping)
(Cecil laughing)

1356
01:09:30,545 --> 01:09:34,962
(blood dripping)
Now this is living.

1357
01:09:37,761 --> 01:09:41,729
(sighs) Well, I'd love
to stay and cause you

1358
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:43,938
some more pain and discomfort,

1359
01:09:43,939 --> 01:09:46,737
but there's a young lady
that needs some attention.

1360
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:50,852
You know, there's something
about torturing girls

1361
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,706
that I enjoy better than guys.

1362
01:09:52,707 --> 01:09:55,170
[Christian] You touch
her and I'll kill you.

1363
01:09:55,171 --> 01:09:57,569
Now, now, I believe that's what Waylon

1364
01:09:57,570 --> 01:09:58,833
is going to do to you.

1365
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,383
You hear that, boy?

1366
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,470
I'm gonna kill you.

1367
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:11,633
Right there.

1368
01:10:16,226 --> 01:10:20,639
(thud) (flesh squelching)
(fence clattering)

1369
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,709
Evan?

1370
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,650
Holly shit.

1371
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:24,389
What the hell's going on here?

1372
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:25,529
Why are they trying to kill us?

1373
01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:27,629
I don't know, man, but
we gotta get out of here.

1374
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:29,039
How are we getting out of here?

1375
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,762
Cecil has the keys.
(flesh squelching)

1376
01:10:30,763 --> 01:10:32,312
(thud) (horn honking)
- [Evan] Where is Cecil?

1377
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:34,049
He's going after Abbie.

1378
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:35,100
We gotta go save her.

1379
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:41,450
(Evan breathing heavily)

1380
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,329
Come on, man, we gotta keep moving.

1381
01:10:45,330 --> 01:10:47,129
Yeah, I'm just getting dizzy, man,

1382
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:49,027
I got hit in the head with a hammer.

1383
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:49,861
You gonna be all right?

1384
01:10:49,862 --> 01:10:51,928
[Evan] Yeah, yeah, I just
need to rest for a minute.

1385
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:53,303
Go on, I'll catch up with you.

1386
01:10:53,304 --> 01:10:54,659
No way, man, I'm not leaving.

1387
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:55,493
Here, I'll help you,

1388
01:10:55,494 --> 01:10:57,635
we can keep moving.
- [Evan] No, just go!

1389
01:10:57,636 --> 01:10:59,800
Go on, I'll be right behind you.

1390
01:10:59,801 --> 01:11:00,963
You sure?

1391
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:03,619
[Evan] Yeah, just
go. (breathing heavily)

1392
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:04,829
All right.

1393
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:06,963
Don't take too long, I'm not
leaving here without you.

1394
01:11:06,964 --> 01:11:09,041
[Evan] Okay, just go get Abbie.

1395
01:11:09,042 --> 01:11:11,709
(ominous music)

1396
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:17,271
(running footsteps)

1397
01:11:18,473 --> 01:11:21,890
(scuffling across floor)

1398
01:11:30,836 --> 01:11:33,586
(Evan screaming)

1399
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,419
I'm gonna kill 'em all.

1400
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,075
(running footsteps)

1401
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:53,222
(whispering) Christian?

1402
01:11:53,223 --> 01:11:54,056
[Christian] (whispering) Are you okay?

1403
01:11:54,057 --> 01:11:58,251
I'll get you out of here.
(metal clanking)

1404
01:11:58,252 --> 01:12:00,502
[Abbie] Christian, hurry.

1405
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,369
All right, let's get
you the hell out of here.

1406
01:12:20,264 --> 01:12:21,214
Come this way.

1407
01:12:21,214 --> 01:12:22,047
[Abbie] No, don't go that way.

1408
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:22,880
Let's go this way.

1409
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:23,713
[Christian] But there's no exit

1410
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:25,296
that way.
- Come on!

1411
01:12:28,164 --> 01:12:31,081
(flesh squelching)

1412
01:12:37,814 --> 01:12:39,314
Here, hold this.

1413
01:12:43,291 --> 01:12:45,283
(ominous music)
(Abbie gasps)

1414
01:12:45,284 --> 01:12:46,904
Abbie!

1415
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:48,654
Don't come any closer,

1416
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:50,919
or I'll cut her throat.

1417
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:53,609
Look, just put the knife
down, and let her go.

1418
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:55,259
She hasn't done anything to you.

1419
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,019
Do you understand the concept
of me cutting her throat?

1420
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,170
Now stay where you are.

1421
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:05,133
Just give us the key, and let her go.

1422
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,779
Let ger go, give us the key. (laughs)

1423
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,213
Listen to you, you sound like an idiot.

1424
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:16,409
Do you think I'm just going
to let you waltz out of here?

1425
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,360
I've got a good thing going on in here.

1426
01:13:20,623 --> 01:13:21,959
Maybe we can help you.

1427
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,793
Join you.

1428
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,443
Join me, yeah, right.

1429
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:29,368
You don't have what it
takes to kill people.

1430
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:32,699
But wait a minute, you
killed Waylon, didn't you?

1431
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:35,054
That's how you got away.

1432
01:13:35,055 --> 01:13:37,305
Bravo, he's one of my best.

1433
01:13:38,436 --> 01:13:40,462
[Abbie] You're a sick freak.

1434
01:13:40,463 --> 01:13:41,373
Careful, honey.

1435
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:43,723
I've got a sharp object
up against your throat.

1436
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,270
We can work this out.

1437
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:51,149
You killed my best friend,
we killed your best friend.

1438
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,110
We're even.

1439
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:55,353
Firstly, Waylon wasn't my best friend,

1440
01:13:56,263 --> 01:13:59,579
and secondly, there you go again,

1441
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:03,329
thinking there has to be a
reason for someone being killed.

1442
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:05,716
Do you know how many people we've killed?

1443
01:14:05,717 --> 01:14:09,393
Hundreds, and we're going
to kill hundreds more.

1444
01:14:10,834 --> 01:14:13,128
I don't care who they are.

1445
01:14:13,129 --> 01:14:15,686
I don't even care that you killed Waylon.

1446
01:14:15,687 --> 01:14:18,033
All I care about is torturing people.

1447
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,888
You see these scars on my face?

1448
01:14:22,889 --> 01:14:25,043
It wasn't a car accident.

1449
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:25,877
I did it.

1450
01:14:27,156 --> 01:14:28,656
Handy work, right?

1451
01:14:29,716 --> 01:14:31,856
I got bored one night,

1452
01:14:31,857 --> 01:14:34,953
and I sat in front of the
mirror and cut my face,

1453
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:38,703
and watched the blood drip down my face.

1454
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,173
So I guess you're right,
I am a sick freak.

1455
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,213
You know what?

1456
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:52,340
I'm sick of explaining myself to you.

1457
01:14:53,385 --> 01:14:55,912
I'm going to kill her,

1458
01:14:55,913 --> 01:14:58,080
and I'm going to kill you.

1459
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:00,809
Is there anything you
want to tell Christian

1460
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,160
before you die, sweetheart?

1461
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:04,798
No?

1462
01:15:04,799 --> 01:15:06,462
(Abbie gasping)

1463
01:15:06,463 --> 01:15:07,296
Okay.

1464
01:15:08,457 --> 01:15:09,800
This is going to be sweet.

1465
01:15:09,801 --> 01:15:11,166
(ominous music)
(squelching)

1466
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:15,250
(Christian grunting and yelling)

1467
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:19,496
(thud)

1468
01:15:19,497 --> 01:15:20,433
Get the knife.

1469
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:27,033
Christian, no, wait!

1470
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,089
We can work something out.

1471
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,339
It doesn't have to end this way.

1472
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,319
Yeah, it does, you bastard.

1473
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,548
(knife stabbing)

1474
01:15:37,549 --> 01:15:40,549
(Christian gasping)

1475
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,603
Looks to be a bit pale, dad.

1476
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,823
I'd say so, darling.

1477
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,290
Wipe that makeup off your face, now, dear.

1478
01:15:54,807 --> 01:15:57,740
What, you looked shocked, Christian?

1479
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:01,878
What, you don't like me anymore?

1480
01:16:01,879 --> 01:16:04,984
I thought we had something going.

1481
01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:07,597
What do you think of
my new boyfriend, dad?

1482
01:16:07,598 --> 01:16:10,181
Mm, I don't know, sweetheart.

1483
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,790
I don't think he's your type.

1484
01:16:14,201 --> 01:16:16,730
No, I don't approve of this one.

1485
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:17,731
Okay, dad.

1486
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,679
(sighs) Oh, well.

1487
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,954
I guess we can't date, after all.

1488
01:16:25,955 --> 01:16:29,218
So what are we going to do with this one?

1489
01:16:29,219 --> 01:16:31,052
Let Chainz kill him.

1490
01:16:32,790 --> 01:16:34,990
No, dad, let me kill him, please.

1491
01:16:36,248 --> 01:16:37,602
I don't know, Abigail.

1492
01:16:37,603 --> 01:16:38,967
Oh, come on.

1493
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:41,015
I don't think you're ready
for killing someone, yet.

1494
01:16:41,016 --> 01:16:43,436
Dad, I did all the
work of keeping him here.

1495
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:44,919
You should have seen me, dad.

1496
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:46,647
I was doing so good.

1497
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:49,398
I could be an actress, after all.

1498
01:16:50,275 --> 01:16:51,872
Let me kill him, dad, please.

1499
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,456
I'm ready, I swear.

1500
01:16:57,171 --> 01:17:01,076
These are the moments that
a parent really treasures.

1501
01:17:01,077 --> 01:17:02,406
[Christian] You bitch.

1502
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:05,468
(Abbie laughs)

1503
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:07,836
What did you call me?

1504
01:17:07,837 --> 01:17:09,996
[Christian] How could you do this?

1505
01:17:09,997 --> 01:17:12,386
(laughs) Are you listening to this, dad?

1506
01:17:12,387 --> 01:17:14,137
He wants to know why.

1507
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:17,868
You know, I don't know.

1508
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:21,063
I guess you could say it's a family thing.

1509
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:34,061
(knife stabbing)
(ominous music)

1510
01:17:34,714 --> 01:17:37,464
(heart pounding)

1511
01:17:39,886 --> 01:17:42,553
(heart slowing)

1512
01:17:52,855 --> 01:17:57,855
(Christmas music)
(people talking)

1513
01:18:13,493 --> 01:18:17,129
(sighs) Holidays make
me sick to my stomach,

1514
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:18,080
wouldn't you agree?

1515
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,213
Yeah.

1516
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,013
I'm Abigail.

1517
01:18:23,007 --> 01:18:24,723
- Michael.
- Michael.

1518
01:18:25,918 --> 01:18:28,190
You have the most beautiful eyes, Michael,

1519
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:30,209
if you don't mind me saying so.

1520
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,881
Thanks, I grew them myself.

1521
01:18:31,882 --> 01:18:33,209
(Abigail laughs)

1522
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:35,159
So are you here with anybody?

1523
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,409
Yeah, my mom, dad, and sister

1524
01:18:37,410 --> 01:18:40,256
are inside that stupid
Christmas Wonderland thing.

1525
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,153
And you decided to stay out here.

1526
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:46,143
Man, I grew out of this
stuff when I was nine.

1527
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:50,163
Come on, don't you think
it'd be fun to go through it?

1528
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:54,899
Come on, you're not gonna make me

1529
01:18:54,900 --> 01:18:57,236
go in there all alone, are you?

1530
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,820
Uh, I don't know.

1531
01:18:59,989 --> 01:19:02,906
Come on, it'll be fun, I promise.

1532
01:19:16,181 --> 01:19:17,098
Ho ho ho.

1533
01:19:23,314 --> 01:19:24,945
[Michael] (screaming) No!

1534
01:19:24,946 --> 01:19:27,946
(heavy metal music)

1535
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,529
You know what they say,
(Halloween sound effects)

1536
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:41,339
A family that slays
together, stays together.

1537
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,439
You know, I was thinking about purchasing

1538
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,349
The Shadow's Edge, but
seems they like to keep

1539
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:47,883
the business in the family.

1540
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:51,599
Well, many holidays are upon us,

1541
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,449
so be careful which house you enter.

1542
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:56,798
You may be there for eternity.

1543
01:22:56,799 --> 01:22:59,283
(laughs) Until next time, my victims.

1544
01:23:00,617 --> 01:23:03,284
(evil laughter)

1545
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:08,736
(somber music)

1546
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:20,808
(witch cackling)
