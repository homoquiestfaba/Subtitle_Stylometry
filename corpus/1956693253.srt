1
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,237
- I am about to place
my fate in you, my jury.

2
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,847
Yes, you out there,

3
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,111
sitting on the couch
with your remote control,

4
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,809
gathered around the glow
of the modern day fire.

5
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:34,425
You see, since I was a kid, I
imagined my life as a movie.

6
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,734
Imagined a crew surrounding
me, filming my every step.

7
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,346
So it's totally appropriate
that you, my audience,

8
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,393
will decide guilty
or not guilty.

9
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:52,095
But before you do, please,
weigh all of the evidence.

10
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:52,965
Shit.

11
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,417
[toilet flushing]

12
00:01:16,337 --> 00:01:18,426
- What are you looking at?

13
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:20,428
- Another one bites the dust.

14
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,430
- Just feed me, man, I'm hungry.

15
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:24,258
- So how does it feel?

16
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,346
- You mean does it bum me out

17
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:27,304
to watch seven of my homies die?

18
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:30,655
Or am I happy to finally
have the tank all to myself?

19
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:32,440
- Yeah, which?

20
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:33,354
- What do you think?

21
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:35,095
Now feed me, bitch.

22
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,618
- [Male Hamster] Come on,
feed me, feed me, feed me.

23
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,401
- [Female Hamster]
If you don't feed me,

24
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,707
I'm gonna eat him.

25
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,100
- [Female Hamster]
I am so dizzy.

26
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,362
- [Male Hamster] More
pellets, more pellets.

27
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:42,972
- [Brown Cat] Can't
you see we're starving?

28
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,408
- [Red Cat] You were supposed
to feed us five minutes ago!

29
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:45,670
- [Plants] It's about time.

30
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:47,542
- [Male Plant] Don't you
give a shit about us?

31
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,978
- [Female Plant] Why do
cats always get fed first?

32
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,111
- [Male Plant] Tap
water, no Evian?

33
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:52,503
- [Ants In Cadence]
Find food, find food.

34
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,114
Find food, find food.

35
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,289
- [Ant] Sound off!

36
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:57,247
- Daddy, where's my drink?

37
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,642
- Can you think of
another way to ask that?

38
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:04,167
- Please, please,
please, please, please.

39
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:15,961
Daddy.

40
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:21,358
- Another fish died,
Shaq Number Seven.

41
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,273
That just leaves
Shaq Number Eight.

42
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:24,144
- Poor fish.

43
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,668
- Yeah, poor fish.

44
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,974
- More cereal.

45
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,545
- Okay kiddo, have a good day.

46
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:35,503
- Kiss off?

47
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,070
- Kiss is off.
- Good.

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,426
- Good morning, it's 11:30.

49
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,994
It's a beautiful day
out, clear and sunny.

50
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:51,475
Rise and shine.

51
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:13,236
[gentle piano music]

52
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,700
[piano music fading]

53
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:51,883
- You never run your hands
through my hair anymore.

54
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:56,584
- Why do you do that?

55
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,847
- What?

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,415
- Why is it when I'm
doing something nice,

57
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,634
you point out how I
never do anything nice?

58
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:08,552
- That's not a
good habit, is it?

59
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:09,379
- No.

60
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,556
- Can you believe
we still have ants?

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,166
- Yeah, I called the service.

62
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:17,822
How'd you sleep?

63
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,563
- I had to take two Ativans.

64
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:22,653
Then I was up again at
four for about two hours,

65
00:04:22,697 --> 00:04:23,915
took another.

66
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,440
- A little gin and
pot, too, I noticed.

67
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,615
- Don't start with me.

68
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,182
I had a tough night.

69
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:37,581
After you left I
started meditating.

70
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:41,019
And it suddenly hit me.

71
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,499
What happened to me,

72
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:45,807
I always thought of as happening
to a seven-year-old girl

73
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,462
or thinking about
how it happened

74
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,465
to someone the same
age Walt is now.

75
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,120
But last night it really...

76
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,342
I started thinking
about how it happened...

77
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:03,868
to me.

78
00:05:07,698 --> 00:05:10,353
Not a seven-year-old
girl in a picture.

79
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:12,747
It was me.

80
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,621
[sighing]

81
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,146
- You wanna lie down?

82
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,672
- Oh [sobbing] yeah.

83
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:30,852
[crying softly]

84
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:32,375
- I wish I knew what to say.

85
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,250
- Talk to me like it was
Walt this happened to.

86
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,563
- I will always protect you.

87
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,698
What happened was
wrong and terrible.

88
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:55,180
No one should ever hurt
someone as special as you.

89
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,791
As wonderful as you.

90
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:00,360
You mean everything to me.

91
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,146
You're smart and
lovable, talented.

92
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,801
I will always love you.

93
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:09,586
Always.

94
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:19,422
[keyboard clicking]

95
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,249
- I know, I know.

96
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:24,471
Nobody sympathizes with
someone in a Mercedes.

97
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:26,690
But I can't help it,
it's the car I drive.

98
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:30,651
I remember the first time
I saw one of these SLKs.

99
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,436
I fell in love with it, it's
the best car I've ever had.

100
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,439
So don't hold it
against me, okay?

101
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,790
- Where does SpongeBob live?

102
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:44,839
A, under a rock; B, in a
pineapple or C, Jurassic Park?

103
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,318
Over.

104
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,059
- B, in a pineapple, over.

105
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,235
- Correct, over.

106
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,020
- There's your
coach, go get 'em.

107
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,500
Over and out.

108
00:06:56,677 --> 00:07:01,682
["Judy In Disguise" by John
Fred and his Playboy Band]

109
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,094
Which one's yours?

110
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,532
- Green shirt, yours?

111
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:29,710
- Oh, the one checking
out the gopher holes.

112
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:31,494
[laughing]

113
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:32,669
Yeah, that's my boy.

114
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,673
So, so what's with
the bellybutton ring?

115
00:07:37,848 --> 00:07:39,371
- Oh, my last act of rebellion.

116
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,070
What about you?

117
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,855
You've got, uh, skateboard
sneakers and what?

118
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,597
Pacific Sunwear shorts,
what's up with that?

119
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,078
- Oh, I'm trying to
become a 14-year-old.

120
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,514
You know what's
so cool right now?

121
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,516
Boys' socks.
- Mm.

122
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,387
- The only type of girls'
clothes I ever used to wear

123
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,693
were my wife's socks
'cause they're short

124
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:58,086
and guys' come up to here.

125
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,304
- Oh I know, I hate that.

126
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,742
- Finally, short
socks are in for guys.

127
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,658
My days of
cross-dressing are over.

128
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,834
- Yeah, sure they are.

129
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,052
I bet you're wearing

130
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:11,055
red Victoria's Secret
panties right now.

131
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,535
- Hot pink.

132
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:16,147
- Pink's cool, but
the shirt has to go.

133
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,149
No logos, billboards aren't in.

134
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,978
And if those are
your comic books,

135
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,677
you have taken the
14-year-old thing too far.

136
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,768
- Nah, studio wants us to
turn these into a screenplay.

137
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:30,379
- So have you written
anything I might have seen?

138
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,208
- Oh, we had a movie
out last summer.

139
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,863
My wife and I write together.

140
00:08:35,906 --> 00:08:37,038
She's sick today.

141
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:38,387
- Oh, it's goin' around.

142
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,955
So, what was the movie?

143
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,915
- Oh, it was just
this, this bear movie.

144
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,395
- I saw that.
- Yeah?

145
00:08:46,438 --> 00:08:48,919
- Oh my God, when that black
actor, what's his name?

146
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:50,704
When that bear jumped
out and got him,

147
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:52,793
that I did not expect.

148
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,099
- Yeah, well it was
a good popcorn movie.

149
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,579
- Oh, it was great.

150
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:58,842
I was so scared, I was grabbin'
my husband's arm so hard

151
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:01,802
he had to tell me to
ease up, it was great.

152
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,064
- I'm Mark, by the way.

153
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,935
- Danni, as in
Daddy wanted a boy.

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,026
- Sorry to interrupt,
members of the jury,

155
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,115
but I suspect that
you're wondering by now,

156
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:14,336
have I already thought
about having sex with her?

157
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,164
Well, you have to understand,

158
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,774
as I notice there
are a good number

159
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:20,429
of female members in the
jury, the truth about men.

160
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,084
Women like to think that
they're the same as men

161
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,390
because they find themselves
fantasizing about sex

162
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:26,914
with someone other
than their spouse,

163
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:30,395
a la the handsome Naval
officer in Eyes Wide Shut.

164
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:33,529
But ladies, for men,
at least for me,

165
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,576
it's more of a second
by second thing.

166
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,448
- What is SpongeBob's
favorite food?

167
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:42,059
- Thank you for
not wearing a bra.

168
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,932
B, Crabby Patties, over.

169
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:47,630
- [Walter] Correct.

170
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,240
- So perfect from here.

171
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,114
Going for the frontal
view, don't let me down.

172
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,595
Oh, sorry about that, chief.

173
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:58,946
Yikes, Polanski-ville,
not going there.

174
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,949
Okay, there's your coach.

175
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,168
Go get 'em, over and out.

176
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:06,954
Go get 'em.

177
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:11,959
Mayday, mayday.

178
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,308
Bellybutton ring.

179
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:14,222
Do I sit there?

180
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,527
No way, I can't sit there.

181
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,835
I have to sit there,
sit there, sit there.

182
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,969
But I'm always that way.

183
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,797
My wife tells me her
girlfriends complain

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,973
that their husbands, who
are just in their forties,

185
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,409
can't get it to stay up.

186
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:28,976
I can't keep it down.

187
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,587
But, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, please,

188
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,894
don't judge me so harshly.

189
00:10:33,937 --> 00:10:37,245
Thinking and doing are
two different things.

190
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,161
Even Jimmy Carter, whose
initials are the same as Christ,

191
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,816
for Chrissakes, even
he lusted in his heart.

192
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:44,426
- So your son's
into SpongeBob, too?

193
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,950
- Oh, yeah, SpongeBob
in, Pokemon out.

194
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:48,169
- Yep.

195
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,866
Oh, did you know they're
giving away posters

196
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,041
at KB Toys on Saturday?

197
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,956
- Oh really, that's great.
- Mm, hm.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,002
- Are you gonna take your son?

199
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:56,307
- I might go in the morning.

200
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,443
- And so I was looking
for her, B-F-D.

201
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,880
She just seemed
nice, that's all.

202
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,882
We talked the whole
hour of practice.

203
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:08,232
She's nice, that's all.

204
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:13,020
- Dad, they're givin' away
free goldfish at the pet store.

205
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:14,717
- Walt, we are not
getting a goldfish.

206
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,414
- Hey, come on,
can't I just look?

207
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,025
- Yes, you can look,

208
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,287
but I'm telling you we're
not getting a goldfish.

209
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,941
We already have two
cats and six hamsters

210
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,203
and I end up feeding them all,

211
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,814
so we are not
getting a goldfish.

212
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:28,035
[water splashing]

213
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,558
What are you gonna name 'em?

214
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:32,648
- Shaq One, Two, Three, Four,
Five, Six, Seven, Eight.

215
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,649
- It's a good name.

216
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,695
Welcome to our home.

217
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:41,178
- Like everybody would be
better off if I wasn't here.

218
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:43,093
If I was dead.

219
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,225
- No, look at me.

220
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,749
Look at me.

221
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:47,881
That's your brain
trying to trick you.

222
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,796
That is chemicals in your brain

223
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,101
that are fighting against you.

224
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,756
- It's me, it's
what's inside me.

225
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,889
- No, no, it's not really you.

226
00:11:55,932 --> 00:11:57,455
You have an illness.

227
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:02,939
When you have the flu, your
body is not what it normally is.

228
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:05,072
You don't look at yourself and
think, this is the real me.

229
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:07,509
You think, this is me sick.

230
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:10,381
Well this is you, sick, and
you're gonna get better.

231
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,165
- How?

232
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,778
I'm on every drug in
the goddamn pharmacy.

233
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,171
- They're not working right.

234
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,651
We'll have to find
something else.

235
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,610
Because you're vital to us.

236
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:26,093
Vital to me, we need
you, we love you.

237
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,921
- You don't understand.

238
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,358
It's not like I'm just
a little depressed.

239
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,881
- I know.
- No, you don't.

240
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:37,844
It's agony, every
fucking minute is agony.

241
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:45,199
Coming from somewhere inside
me and I can't tell where.

242
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:49,856
It's like I'm going to
fall into a black hole

243
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,901
and never come out.

244
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,949
- Don't let it trick you.

245
00:12:56,993 --> 00:12:59,082
It's not on your side right now.

246
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,389
I am.

247
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,132
You have to believe me.

248
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,050
While she sleeps,

249
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:12,487
I often find myself
watching old clips

250
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:13,880
from the movie of my life.

251
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:18,710
[gentle piano music]

252
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,019
Wow, it's beautiful.

253
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:27,589
- It's in case you
ever lose your way.

254
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,069
- Oh, to our new house?

255
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:31,767
- Read the cover.

256
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:36,206
- Neh-so-we-toil--

257
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,730
[giggling]

258
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,168
- North, east, south, west,

259
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:44,084
you're the one I love the best.

260
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:47,391
- [Mark] Oh--

261
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:48,436
- It's true.

262
00:13:49,654 --> 00:13:52,919
- Thank you, thank you.

263
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,442
- Thank you for the house.

264
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,357
[gentle chuckling]

265
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,405
Oh!
[lamp crashing]

266
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,844
- After my movie's
over, I stare at her.

267
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,152
In sleep she is so peaceful,

268
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:12,199
having found a refuge from
all her sadness and fears.

269
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,683
Yes, go Walt!

270
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,163
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

271
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:21,077
- Where you been?

272
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,470
- Oh, Walt was sick last week.

273
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,558
How'd we do?

274
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:25,429
- We won, four to two.
- Woo hoo!

275
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,170
- Not that anyone's
supposed to keep score.

276
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:28,911
- So you wanna do
an errand with me?

277
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,174
It was my week to bring the
drinks but I left them at home.

278
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:32,915
So I gotta go to
the grocery store.

279
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,091
If you come with me,
we can get chocolate.

280
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:35,875
- Okay.

281
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,314
- So, so how long have you
guys been back together?

282
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,230
- Goin' on a year.

283
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,233
- Well, maybe it was
good for you two.

284
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:47,060
A break.

285
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,150
- He's just so caught up
in his work, you know?

286
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,500
I mean, he quotes Gordon Gekko:

287
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,458
"Money doesn't sleep."

288
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,896
- It's a good movie.

289
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,549
- He's gotten
better about it now.

290
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:03,293
- Did you see other people
when you were separated?

291
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,120
- Oh yeah.

292
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,732
- I've been married
sixteen-and-a-half years.

293
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,126
So please tell me,
what was it like

294
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,259
being with someone else?

295
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:13,347
- It was great.

296
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:17,133
I don't think it's
natural to be monogamous.

297
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:22,922
But, you know, we do
what we have to do.

298
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,230
- We got that bar in a gift
basket from a producer after

299
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:29,276
he chose someone else to write
the new Terminator movie.

300
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,581
It was good.

301
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,018
- Well, as long as
it's dark chocolate.

302
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,323
If it's not dark chocolate,
there's no point.

303
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,586
- Dark chocolate with almonds.
- Even better.

304
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,679
[parents cheering]

305
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,640
[exciting music]

306
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,600
- Come on Walt!

307
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:54,910
Oh get up honey, come
on, honey, get up!

308
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,304
Get up Walter, come on.

309
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:59,045
Come on honey get up!

310
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:04,398
[cheering]

311
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,965
- Way to go, woo!

312
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,576
Woo-hoo!

313
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:10,230
- Mark.
- Hm?

314
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:13,059
- Your voice, it's
so high-pitched, you
sound like a girl.

315
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,191
Woo-hoo!

316
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,063
Good job, all right!

317
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,211
[cheering]

318
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,394
[clapping]

319
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:54,622
- Younger, taller, handsomer.

320
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,320
- She's not that good looking.
- Who?

321
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:04,153
- Danni, her lips
come together funny.

322
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,417
You talk about her so much.

323
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,204
[sighing]

324
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,857
- She's nice, that's all.

325
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:18,167
- I'm sorry.

326
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,217
I hate men with deep voices.

327
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:27,481
- I hate soccer.

328
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:32,355
[keyboard clicking]

329
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:35,967
- [Ringside Announcer]
Welcome to Atlanta

330
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,057
and the main event.

331
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,319
- [Ringside Announcer]
Like any woman,

332
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,930
our challenger refused
to do the weigh-in.

333
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,410
- [Ringside Announcer]
Right, age has definitely

334
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:46,543
been kind to her, she
looks strong and ready.

335
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,024
- But she's yet to
defeat the champion,

336
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,332
Frank Cantrell, AKA Step-Dad.

337
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:55,074
Age 62, weighing in at 165.

338
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,292
- [Ringside Announcer]
And he's looking

339
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:58,164
a little the worse
for wear, Chuck,

340
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:01,036
a pretty big paunch and
those awful bow-legs.

341
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,559
- He's always been
ashamed of those, Bill,

342
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,431
but what he loses in physique

343
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,389
he makes up for in
sheer brutality.

344
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:09,218
He's been an unstoppable
force to the challenger.

345
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,654
- [Ringside Announcer]
Wait a second,

346
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,178
is that a cigarette
in his glove?

347
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,614
- Incredible!

348
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,572
And I thought he was on
the patch during training.

349
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,314
[bell dinging]

350
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:22,797
- No cheap shots, no low
blows, no slow motion.

351
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,146
No animal sound effects.

352
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,973
Touch gloves.

353
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:26,844
Come out fighting.

354
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:31,022
- As usual, it's Carrie
in Frank's corner.

355
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:35,636
A remarkable team and for the
past sixteen-and-a-half years,

356
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,768
this man's been
in Lorna's corner.

357
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,857
- Minus that six weeks
when she went solo.

358
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,295
- That's just a bump
in the road, Chuck.

359
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:44,862
But, what concerns me is this:

360
00:18:44,906 --> 00:18:46,864
is he really up to the task

361
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:49,563
or will he get squeamish
at the first sight of blood

362
00:18:49,606 --> 00:18:51,521
and try to stop the fight?

363
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,523
- [Ringside Announcer]
We'll know soon enough.

364
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,178
[bell dinging]

365
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:57,875
- [Mark] Hang in there,
champ, it's on its way.

366
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,924
- [Walter] I've been hungry
for like, 33 minutes.

367
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:04,534
- [Frank] Where's the bird?

368
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,276
- It's almost ready.

369
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:12,542
Would you like to
know the menu, Lorna?

370
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,196
- Sure, Mom.

371
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,893
- Well, we're having turkey.

372
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:18,026
[laughing]

373
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:21,769
And fluffy cornbread stuffing.

374
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,249
Uh, crumb green beans.

375
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,467
[Lorna snapping]

376
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:28,123
Fancy sweet potatoes
and cranberry sauce.

377
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,778
Oh, my pies.

378
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:32,301
- A-ha.

379
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:35,870
- Sweet potato with old
fashioned rum sauce and pecan.

380
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,046
- Can I have some pie or
something, I'm hungry.

381
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,221
- After supper.

382
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,179
[kitchen timer dinging]

383
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,354
- Oh, my sauce, excuse me.

384
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,313
- You're gonna have
to be patient, Walt.

385
00:19:44,357 --> 00:19:47,098
- You said that 34 minutes ago.

386
00:19:47,142 --> 00:19:50,145
- Okay, son, sit up in your
chair and give me a break.

387
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:50,972
All right?

388
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,715
- You don't want me to
starve to death, do you?

389
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,673
- [Mark] Put your
silverware down.

390
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,587
[silverware clattering to floor]

391
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,633
- What, he said to put it down.

392
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:00,808
- I'll tell ya what he needs.

393
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,201
He needs his butt spanked.

394
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,377
- He's eight, he's hungry.

395
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,595
- I didn't let you
carry on like that

396
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,683
when you were eight.

397
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,250
[light chuckling]

398
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:10,644
- He can't help it.
- He could help it.

399
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:13,516
He's got you pretty
well trained, I see.

400
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,910
Children need
discipline, darling.

401
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,391
You don't wanna raise a brat.

402
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:19,653
Take it from me,

403
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:22,395
you better start now
before it's too late.

404
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,440
- [Ringside Announcer] She's
not answering that upper cut.

405
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:26,486
- Seems weak on her legs.
[bell dinging]

406
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,923
- And there's the
bell ending the round.

407
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,404
- Maybe they've just faced
each other one time too many,

408
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,711
'cause I'm just not
feeling the intensity.

409
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:37,279
The heat.
[bell dinging]

410
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,499
- Frank, you do the carving.
- Mm, hm.

411
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:47,420
- There, Walt, take this to
the den and eat it there.

412
00:20:47,463 --> 00:20:49,248
You can watch TV, go on, now.

413
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,167
I can't do this anymore.

414
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,082
- Do what?

415
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,172
- Pretend to love you.

416
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:03,740
For years, every
time I've seen you,

417
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,613
every time I've picked up the
phone and heard your voice,

418
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,528
I've pretended that
everything was okay.

419
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,704
- Oh, for God's sakes, Lorna.

420
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,793
Let's just eat our dinner
before it gets cold.

421
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,664
- Walt's eight years old
and he wants to, what?

422
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,666
Hit him with his belt
'cause he's hungry?

423
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,277
Send him out to find a switch?

424
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,453
- I didn't say a goddamn
thing about hitting anybody!

425
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:21,976
- I have not forgotten,
right at this table,

426
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:24,500
you threw a plate
of food in my face.

427
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,633
- Oh Lorna, you have
the longest index finger

428
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:27,677
in the world.

429
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,983
- Don't you defend him.

430
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,290
Do you remember hitting
me hard across the mouth

431
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,552
in an elevator?

432
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,901
'Cause I said you didn't need

433
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:36,033
to keep punching the
button for it to work?

434
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:40,168
All of your so-called discipline
when I was a teenager?

435
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,039
I started to totally fall apart.

436
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,606
- Oh, you never fell apart.

437
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,695
You were bumped up two grades.

438
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:48,611
Graduated high school
when you were 16.

439
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:50,657
Look at your house!

440
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,528
You've always
landed on your feet.

441
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:53,921
- I was falling apart.

442
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:56,010
Why do you think I left
home when I was 16?

443
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:59,709
To get away from you,
to save my sanity.

444
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:01,581
I remember you making me...

445
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,021
a fully-developed teen...

446
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:13,201
strip to my underwear
and you beating me

447
00:22:13,244 --> 00:22:15,116
for running away for two days.

448
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:17,423
You stopped, smoked a cig,

449
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,642
came back and beat me some more.

450
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,036
- I don't remember ever
doing any such thing.

451
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,646
- Oh!

452
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,214
- Everything's always gotta be
so dramatic with you, Lorna.

453
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:29,130
You are the heroine
in your own tragedy.

454
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,610
- Sounds like you
and your shrink

455
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:31,698
have had a lot to talk about.

456
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,743
Always blame the parents.

457
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,571
You wait 'til your
son is an adult

458
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,530
and blaming everything on you.

459
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,227
Bunch of raging bullshit!

460
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,055
- You have never once
owned up to what you did.

461
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:43,013
- Well, I don't know
what you want me to say.

462
00:22:43,057 --> 00:22:44,667
- You don't? Really?

463
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:47,714
I apologize, how about that?

464
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,718
- You are a grown woman.

465
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:54,677
Whatever happened,
happened a long time ago.

466
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,114
I'm not about to kiss your ass.

467
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,380
- Where were you?

468
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:09,910
You were supposed to take
of me and you didn't.

469
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:12,086
- You liked to
worry us to death.

470
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:16,482
You know, with your
drinking and your drugs

471
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:19,702
and your stayin' out
all night with boys.

472
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,792
You were outta control
and you deserved it.

473
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,187
- What about the
stuff when I was five?

474
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,711
And six?

475
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,713
And eight?

476
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:31,932
What about that?

477
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:36,458
I remember coming to
you for help, Mom.

478
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:40,767
Telling you I felt
crazy, I wanted a shrink.

479
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,770
Sexually abused
by Peter's friend.

480
00:23:43,813 --> 00:23:47,948
And you, turning away and
saying nothin' happened to you.

481
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:52,126
I took good care of you,
yes, you are perfect.

482
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,868
That was always the
message, Mother is perfect.

483
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:59,002
But I was dirty.

484
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:01,657
Whorish, unclean.

485
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,312
Groveling around down
there in the muck.

486
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:06,749
That was how you
wanted me to feel.

487
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:11,798
But I have perfection, perfect
husband, perfect house,

488
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,496
career, friends, perfect life.

489
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,499
So fuck you!

490
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:18,848
Fuck both of you!

491
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:22,896
[grunting]

492
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:32,949
- [Ringside Announcer] A
K-O in the second round.

493
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:35,735
No punches pulled tonight.

494
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,956
[gentle piano music]

495
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:57,757
[thunder booming]

496
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,934
- Do you know how I would've
written it if it was a movie?

497
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,720
- Like a boxing scene
in the Raging Bull.

498
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:10,204
- No, I would have left
the room with Walt.

499
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:14,077
Taken the shotgun
from the gun cabinet,

500
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,169
and then I would have made
my way back downstairs

501
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,954
to the dining room.

502
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,262
[shotgun cocking]

503
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,742
Happy Thanksgiving.

504
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:27,830
- Oh shit.

505
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:32,182
[shotgun firing]

506
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,578
- Love you, mean it.

507
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:39,929
- That'd be a good scene.

508
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,323
A real trailer moment.

509
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,024
- But the Raging Bull
idea is good, too.

510
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,769
[gentle piano music]

511
00:25:58,687 --> 00:26:00,863
- I trust that you will
come to understand,

512
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:03,605
those of you out there in
your den or your bedroom,

513
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:05,085
why I am doing this.

514
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:08,784
Tonight was not the first
time I'd heard about

515
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:10,960
what Lorna's brother's
friend had done to her.

516
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:14,442
Lorna could handle
her parents now,

517
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,965
but he was another story.

518
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,404
About a year ago, after
kicking me out of the house,

519
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,928
then taking me back in,

520
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:24,887
Lorna told her physician
that she was sleep-deprived.

521
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:27,977
The doctor said that
chronic insomnia

522
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,327
was almost always a
psychological issue

523
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:32,808
and she recommended a
therapist and a psychiatrist

524
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:34,984
that specialized in
medication for depression.

525
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,815
In the very first session,

526
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,513
her therapist asked Lorna
if she'd ever been molested.

527
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,781
You see, the brain
will do anything

528
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:51,697
to avoid dealing with trauma.

529
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,046
It represses things.

530
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,224
That doesn't mean that
Lorna had forgotten

531
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,792
what had happened to
her at the age of seven.

532
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,968
She told her mother
about it when she was 15.

533
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,451
But, when the brain
doesn't want you

534
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:08,975
to revisit the dark place,

535
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:12,631
it distracts you with
backaches, neck pain, insomnia.

536
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:16,025
The brain has many
weapons in its arsenal;

537
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,419
anything to avoid that place.

538
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,478
Yes, I admit that was
me in the front seat,

539
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,655
the shotgun riding shotgun.

540
00:27:38,352 --> 00:27:41,224
You see, after a few sessions,

541
00:27:41,268 --> 00:27:44,010
the therapist suggested
that Lorna write down

542
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,926
what had happened and
how it had affected her.

543
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:57,110
"I remember the shower
running, Peter in the shower.

544
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:03,029
"He's sitting on Peter's
bed beckoning me over.

545
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,074
"I don't want to.

546
00:28:06,554 --> 00:28:11,080
"I want to, I like the
attention, special attention.

547
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:13,866
"I don't like at all the
fear of being caught.

548
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:17,957
"The pain, the feeling I'm
left with, I know it's bad.

549
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:22,962
"I feel some tiny bit clever
'cause I pretend to sleep

550
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:27,009
"and am a heavy rag doll as
he tries to manipulate my body

551
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,881
"as he takes off my pajamas.

552
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:33,015
"He pulls the pants
down around my ankles.

553
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,453
"I did make it a
little hard for him

554
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:37,933
"and I'm pleased with this.

555
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,894
"He has never taken all
my clothes off before.

556
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:45,071
"It's too much, too exposed.

557
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,423
"I remember him, Ralph Dell.

558
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,906
"Ugly, pimply teen
with dark hair,

559
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:56,822
"brown eyes, maybe glasses.

560
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:03,176
"Suddenly my face pressed
down and it's in my mouth.

561
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:11,097
"All I remember of him is
that sick smile, his voice:

562
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,752
"Is that okay?

563
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,493
"Am I hurting you?

564
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:23,109
"Very quickly he is..."

565
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,514
- Very quickly he is
spewing in my mouth.

566
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,128
I reel back, gag spit it.

567
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:43,651
Think it's piss in my mouth.

568
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,525
Then he pulls my clothes
back and I open my eyes

569
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,006
and I think I just ran away.

570
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:54,009
Time up, shower stopped.

571
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,795
I think I just ran away.

572
00:29:58,535 --> 00:30:01,538
[window shattering]

573
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:08,067
I don't understand what
is happening to me,

574
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,592
but it is making me bad.

575
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:13,986
I have a secret.

576
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,120
A dirty secret I
must not tell a soul.

577
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:19,818
Forget it.

578
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,343
So I do.

579
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:28,914
God I have a great husband.

580
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:58,421
- Wake up.

581
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:00,554
Wake up!

582
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:02,469
- What, oh fuck, fuck!

583
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,471
- Ralph Dell?

584
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,342
- Who are you, what do you want?

585
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,737
- Did you used to
live on Hazelton Road?

586
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,565
Is that where your parents
lived when you were 16?

587
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,828
- Uh, Hazelton Road, yeah.

588
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,572
- Do remember a little
girl named Lorna?

589
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:19,747
- Who?

590
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,270
- Peter's little sister.

591
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:23,142
Do you remember her?

592
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,840
Of course you remember her.

593
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,536
- [Ralph] No, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

594
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,320
Who are you?

595
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,669
- Don't lie to me.

596
00:31:28,712 --> 00:31:29,583
- [Ralph] What are
you talking about?

597
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,366
- Don't even fucking lie to me.

598
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,020
- You put the gun down.

599
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:33,630
- Don't lie to me or I'll
blow your fucking face off!

600
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:34,501
- I don't know what you want,
I don't know what you want!

601
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:35,719
- Tell me you remember her!

602
00:31:35,763 --> 00:31:37,286
- I remember her,
Peter's little sister,

603
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,461
she was always hangin' around
when I played in his band.

604
00:31:38,505 --> 00:31:39,288
- And...

605
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:43,553
what did you do to her?

606
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:46,861
- Nothin', I didn't do
nothin', man, I swear.

607
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,913
- Open your mouth.
- What?

608
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:58,307
- I'm gonna help you remember.

609
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:00,831
- Fuck you.

610
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,572
- Open your mouth mother fucker
or I'll pull the trigger!

611
00:32:02,616 --> 00:32:04,487
- No, please!
- Open it!

612
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,101
[wind chimes chiming]

613
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,194
Is that okay?

614
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,153
Am I hurting you?

615
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,987
Swallow this.

616
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,642
[shotgun fires]

617
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,958
You wouldn't convict
me, would you, my jury?

618
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:43,265
Don't you think he did
this to other children?

619
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,441
He could still be doing it now.

620
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:48,705
If it was your wife, your
daughter, your sister,

621
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,664
you'd slaughter him too, right?

622
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:55,321
No, you wouldn't.

623
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,193
But you'd fantasize about it.

624
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:01,109
And you'd run it
over and over again.

625
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:03,894
Like a movie.

626
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,423
But as much as I
wanted to do it,

627
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:13,469
to drive there to shoot
him or hack him to pieces,

628
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:15,254
as many times as
I'd run the images

629
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,169
through the
projector in my mind,

630
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,432
I could not open the cabinet.

631
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:24,393
So this is not the crime
that you must judge me on.

632
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:54,336
- I didn't know how
much it affected them.

633
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,605
Frank wasn't always like that.

634
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,479
It's just the stress
of the business.

635
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,833
They seemed okay.

636
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:15,618
I'm sorry.

637
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,405
- You need to tell her that.

638
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,671
- It doesn't matter,
she's so cold.

639
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:31,852
- Cold?

640
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:36,987
You don't know her
at all, do you?

641
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,470
- We must've done
something right.

642
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,473
I mean look at her.

643
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,868
She's so successful.

644
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:51,089
She married you.

645
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,097
She does so well.

646
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:04,841
I mean we musta done
something right.

647
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,722
[keyboard clicking]

648
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:19,639
- You just remember it
can all end in a snap.

649
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:20,901
- Yeah, yeah.

650
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:21,945
- And they put
you in movie jail.

651
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,382
- Yeah, yeah.

652
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:25,471
- One minute I'm
producing a movie for FOX,

653
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:27,386
I'm on a roll, I
got the new Beemer.

654
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,780
Next minute it tanks, it's
straight to movie jail.

655
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:33,435
Do not collect $200,
do not pass go.

656
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:34,219
- Yeah.

657
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:35,437
- We need more gin!

658
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,612
- [Mark] Huh?

659
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,792
- Sweetie, you have to get
us some more Tanqueray.

660
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,534
There's a bottle at the house
and you're okay to drive.

661
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:47,493
[kissing]
[Lorna laughing]

662
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:48,755
- Come with me.

663
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:52,367
- No, no, we're gonna
[sucking imaginary toke]

664
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:53,194
- Here, this is Walt's.

665
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,021
- Oh, Walt, here.

666
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:57,677
Oh!

667
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,330
- [Mark] Careful,
careful with that.

668
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,505
- I know!

669
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:00,723
Hey Annie, Annie, come here.

670
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,250
You don't smoke, right?

671
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,555
- No.
- Okay, cool.

672
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,471
You guys go, bottle
of Tanqueray, go!

673
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,605
Yoo-hoo!

674
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:17,958
- What a great house, how
long have you lived here?

675
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,047
- A couple years.

676
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,570
- Yeah, how much
did you pay for it?

677
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,616
- [Mark] I don't
wanna think about it.

678
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:25,792
- Hey, I love your
oven, does Lorna bake?

679
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,273
- Nah, not much.

680
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:29,404
- Well you two seem
like a great couple.

681
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,666
I can't believe we
hadn't met before,

682
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,016
though I do remember
you from Casino Night.

683
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,583
- Really?

684
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,150
- You were, uh, you
were in a tuxedo.

685
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,630
You looked very sharp.

686
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,503
Whoa, your shoe's untied.

687
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:42,852
- Oh, yeah.

688
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:44,724
My laces have been
untied for years,

689
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,987
but, I haven't
tripped on 'em yet.

690
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,815
- Oh, I'll tie 'em
for you, I insist.

691
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:54,821
So I wanna ask you something,
a hypothetical question.

692
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:57,389
- Well that's, that's
the most dangerous kind.

693
00:36:57,432 --> 00:37:00,130
- Do you think it's possible
for two married people

694
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:02,959
to have sex with
someone else just once

695
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,744
and afterwards just be friends?

696
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,837
- I think that's a
hell of a question.

697
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:13,448
- 'Cause I'd really
like to be friends

698
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,449
with you and Lorna.

699
00:37:19,846 --> 00:37:21,804
- I don't think it's possible.

700
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,676
You know, someone always
ends up telling someone,

701
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,025
or someone gets hurt

702
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:27,375
because they like the
other person too much

703
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,160
or, you know, it's
a chemical thing.

704
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:34,121
- It's just I've been
married twelve years

705
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:37,211
and I've been thinking am I
gonna have sex with the same man

706
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,908
for the rest of my life?

707
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:41,868
I mean the animal kingdom
is not monogamous.

708
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:43,522
Except penguins, you know.

709
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,480
I saw on the Discovery Channel
that penguins are monogamous.

710
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:49,354
- Oh, well, of course all
penguins look exactly alike.

711
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:53,662
I mean once you've had a
penguin you've had them all.

712
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:54,837
- That's good.

713
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,666
[light chuckling]

714
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,805
- I grew up in New Hampshire

715
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:07,981
and we used to
ski every weekend.

716
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:11,637
And one thing I learned
was not to ski the last run

717
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,421
because that's when
the trail's really icy

718
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,640
and most people break their legs

719
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:17,512
and you'd be sledded
down by the ski patrol.

720
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,472
- Oh, I don't follow.

721
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,387
- Oh, that's okay, I
mean I'm ad-libbing.

722
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:28,480
It's late Annie, it's the
last run, and I don't,

723
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,397
I think we better not
go down the mountain.

724
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:35,835
- You're right.

725
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,707
Besides you have
the perfect wife.

726
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:41,536
She's so fun and she's so alive.

727
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,279
And you don't wanna mess
with a perfect marriage.

728
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,108
[light chuckling]

729
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:55,333
- So, President Calvin
Coolidge and his wife

730
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,683
are visiting a government farm.

731
00:38:57,726 --> 00:39:00,599
And Mrs. Coolidge sees
this rooster, you know,

732
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,644
so she says to the
farmer, she says,

733
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:04,080
how many times a
day does he do that?

734
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,605
And the farmer says,
twelve times a day.

735
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:09,521
She says, would you please
tell the President that?

736
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:11,044
So the farmer goes
to the president,

737
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:13,394
tells him about the
rooster, twelve times a day.

738
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:16,049
And Coolidge says,
same hen each time?

739
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:17,659
The farmer says no, no, a
different hen each time.

740
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:20,445
He says, would you please
tell Mrs. Coolidge that?

741
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:22,577
[laughing]

742
00:39:24,797 --> 00:39:28,191
Don't shoot the messenger,
it's a true story.

743
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,932
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Absolutely.

744
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,456
- Woo, woo, woo, woo!

745
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,632
- Hey, speaking of,
where have you guys been?

746
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:38,680
- Yay, hold this [laughing]
thank you, thank you.

747
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,117
Whoop, oh shit!

748
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,815
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

749
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:45,557
- You know we should probably
think about going pretty soon,

750
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,819
Walt's got a game tomorrow.

751
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:49,691
- Oh, he's fine, I'm
fine, we're all fine.

752
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:52,477
- I think you're a
little too fine, honey.

753
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,695
- Well, so what?

754
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:55,436
This is the best
I've felt for months.

755
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,917
- I know, but you have
to take your medication

756
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,266
and you're drinking.

757
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:00,746
- I don't need to take
my medication anymore.

758
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,791
- And I worry.
- I don't.

759
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:04,663
Having it out with my
parents helped a lot.

760
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:08,144
It was a relief, what?

761
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,409
You want me to be on
medication the rest of my life?

762
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:12,192
- No, I don't.

763
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:13,802
- Well, I'm not sick.

764
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:16,109
Come on, come on.

765
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:17,763
It's Friday night.

766
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:20,896
Don't be a wet blanket.

767
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,769
- Yeah, don't be a wet blanket.

768
00:40:27,642 --> 00:40:28,730
- Hey, Coach.

769
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:29,470
- [Coach] Yeah.

770
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,037
- Hey, listen,

771
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,604
I know this is a lot to spring
on ya at the last minute,

772
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,083
but, uh, Walt would
really like it

773
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,781
if he could play goalie.

774
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:36,738
- Has he been practicing?

775
00:40:36,782 --> 00:40:38,087
- Yeah, I told him he had to

776
00:40:38,131 --> 00:40:39,741
so we've practiced
a little every day.

777
00:40:39,785 --> 00:40:42,091
Of course I realize how each
game really comes down to

778
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,702
if the goalie can
stop the ball or not.

779
00:40:43,745 --> 00:40:45,530
And since this is the
last game of the season--

780
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:47,488
- Look, I'll put him
in the last ten minutes

781
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:48,924
and I'll put our best
players on defense--

782
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:50,230
- Oh, great.

783
00:40:50,273 --> 00:40:51,536
- I don't care if we
win or lose the game.

784
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:52,667
If he wants to play
goalie he can play.

785
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:53,886
- Thanks, thank you.

786
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,672
[sighing]

787
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,892

[parents cheering]

789
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:19,738
- Let's go, boys!

790
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:24,786
- Hey.
- Hey [chuckling]

791
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:29,095
- That's the same shirt you
wore the first time I met you.

792
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,226
- This?

793
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,053
- I remember.

794
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,144
I can't believe this is
the last game, this is it.

795
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:36,711
- I know.

796
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,408
- Substitution Ref!

[whistle blowing]

798
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:40,976
- Oh shit, is it the
last ten minutes already?

799
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,195
- [Coach] Walt,
you're gonna be great.

800
00:41:43,326 --> 00:41:46,373
[upbeat cowbell music]

801
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,983
- Okay, Walt, let's go!

802
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:51,378
- Lookin' good, Walt.

803
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:54,860
Stay in the middle of the
goal and watch the ball.

804
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:57,471
Sorry.

805
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,169

the goalie was beaming

- Hi.
- Hey.

00:43:03,276 --> 00:43:06,845
- So, who's the second
to the last boss?

824
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,108
- [Walter] Bowser, duh.

825

- Hey!
- Hey there.

00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:16,637
- How'd it go?

829
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:18,900
- We won, Walt made three saves.

830
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:20,423
- That's great.

831
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,513
- Spielberg was there, his
kid was on the other team.

832
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:26,168
- Did you ask Steve when
he's gonna return my call?

833
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:28,649
I left a message in '97.

834
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,520
- Walt made three saves?

835
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:31,739
- They didn't score on him once,

836
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:34,089
it was unbelievable
how he did in the goal.

837
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:36,265
- And we beat Spielberg.
- We beat Spielberg.

00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:43,272
You would have really
liked watching him.

840
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:46,798
- I know, I didn't get
any sleep last night.

841
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,104
- Yeah, I'm sure that pot
is really helping, too.

842
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:53,500
- It's helping me,
what about you, Steven?

843
00:43:53,543 --> 00:43:54,719
- I feel fantastic.

844
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,723
- By the time I got there it
would've been almost over.

845
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,942
- Well, he didn't play goal
'til the last ten minutes.

846
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,030
- I wasn't sure what
field it was this week.

847
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,771
- I left it on the
bulletin board.

848
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,079
- I couldn't get out
there in the heat.

849
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:10,082
I don't feel good, okay?

850
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,521

who were always on the rag.

- Hi, Danni, it's Mark.

854
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,676
- [Danni] Oh, hi.

855
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,896
- How are you?

856
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,072
- [Danni] Good, hold on a sec.

857
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:44,899
- Okay.

858
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,035
- [Danni] There, sorry, I
was just putting on a shirt.

859
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:52,907
So, what's doin'?

860
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:55,518
- Oh, nothing much, I just,

861
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:59,653
it's Tuesday and it's
weird, no more practice.

862
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,002
- [Danni] Yeah, I know.

863
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:03,701
- I guess I got used to
seeing you every week.

864
00:45:06,616 --> 00:45:07,966
Well, the truth is,

865
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,532
I just really look forward
to Tuesdays, you know?

866
00:45:09,576 --> 00:45:12,057
It's sorta the day that the
rest of my week led up to.

867
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:14,189
- [Danni] It was fun.

868
00:45:16,148 --> 00:45:21,066
- Anyway, you know, I think
I'd just kick myself, you know,

869
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:22,328
and thinking about
it a lot later on,

870
00:45:22,371 --> 00:45:23,895
if I didn't just come
out and tell you, well,

871
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:25,766
maybe you can already tell.

872
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,769
But you probably have
no idea how badly

873
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,902
I have wanted to
hook up with you.

874
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,905
I'd thought long and hard
about using the phrase hook up.

875
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:36,646
I determined it was
best because, A, it's
what the kids say,

876
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:38,910
and any years I could shed
in this situation would help;

877
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:41,216
B, it didn't sound
tawdry or revolting

878
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,002
nor C, too mushy, in fact,

879
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:46,178
I wish we'd had the phrase
hook up when I was younger.

880
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:47,048
It's great

881
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:51,009
- [Danni] You have?

882
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:54,229
- Yeah, I mean, when
I first met you,

883
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:57,798
I thought you were really
hot-looking, beautiful-looking.

884
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:00,758
But then when we started
spending more time together

885
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:04,065
and actually talking
each week, I really,

886
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,459
I really started
to like you a lot,

887
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:08,591
and I started
thinking about you,

888
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:11,638
and now I'm really
rambling because I can tell

889
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:13,945
this is going nowhere and I'm
getting really embarrassed.

890
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:17,165
- [Danni] No, don't be
embarrassed, I'm flattered.

891
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:20,690
But I can't do that,
you know, I'm married.

892
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:23,824
- Right, right.

893
00:46:25,043 --> 00:46:26,566
I guess that time
when we were driving

894
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:29,090
you were talking about how
being faithful wasn't natural,

895
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:31,005
it was just conjecture--

896
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:33,094
- [Danni] Right, I also
said that you know,

897
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:34,617
you do what you have to do.

898
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:36,663
- Yeah, you did.

899
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:41,407
Well, maybe it was
just the chocolate.

900
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,235
- [Danni] Ha, ha, yeah,
definitely the chocolate.

901
00:46:43,278 --> 00:46:45,193
- God, I'm so embarrassed.

902
00:46:45,237 --> 00:46:47,935
- [Danni] Don't be
embarrassed, it's, you know,

903
00:46:47,979 --> 00:46:50,982
if I'd met you back when
I was separated that--

904
00:46:51,025 --> 00:46:53,419
- No, look, I'm just glad
that you're not, you know,

905
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:55,508
pissed or repulsed by me.

906
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:58,337
- [Danni] Of course
not, don't be silly.

907
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:02,863
- Well, then, tail tucked,
I will hang up now,

908
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:06,562
and try to pretend like this
phone call never happened.

909
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:08,086
- [Danni] Aw.

910
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:09,522
- I will miss seeing you.

911
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:12,351
Bye.

912
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:13,613
- [Danni] Bye.

913
00:47:16,442 --> 00:47:19,184
- Oh, I'm such a fucking idiot!

- [Danni] That's okay.

929
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,961
- I just thought I
should really try

930
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:42,832
and explain myself a
little more, you know?

931
00:48:42,876 --> 00:48:45,313
So you'd understand
and you wouldn't think

932
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:46,967
that I was just
some married jerk

933
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:49,317
that does this kind
of thing all the time.

934
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:53,104
I have been faithful to my
wife since we met in college.

935
00:48:53,147 --> 00:48:58,152
And, well, I'm very aware
of what I'm doing and why.

936
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:02,200
And, see, this past
year-and-a-half,

937
00:49:02,243 --> 00:49:05,116
it's just been really hard.

938
00:49:05,159 --> 00:49:09,076
See, my wife is
clinically depressed

939
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,296
but she stopped
taking her medication

940
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:13,211
and so I'm having
to do everything.

941
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:17,389
And, I really, I can't
talk to anyone about it.

942
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:21,523
- [Danni] What do
you do for yourself?

943
00:49:21,567 --> 00:49:22,568
- For myself?

944
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:25,353
- [Danni] Yeah, what
do you do for yourself?

945
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:26,267
Just for you?

946
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:33,448
- Nothing, I guess that's what
I was looking for with you.

947
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:36,147
Something that's just for me.

948
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,018
I mean I know it came out
like it was all about sex

949
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,064
and I'm sorry about that.

950
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:42,240
I mean I do think you're
really beautiful and all that

951
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:47,288
but [sighing] I guess I need
a friend who's just mine.

952
00:49:50,378 --> 00:49:52,076
- [Danni] I could
be your friend.

[upbeat music]

954
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:00,388
- We talked for over an hour.

955
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:03,348
It was so much
better than a shrink.

956
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,785
A shrink gets paid
to empathize and ask,

957
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:07,439
how did that make you feel?

958
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,137
Just like a prostitute
gets paid to make you feel

959
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:11,965
like you've got a
big, perfect dick.

960
00:50:14,489 --> 00:50:17,710
But for some reason, I
honestly don't know why,

961
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:20,321
Danni really listened,
really cared.

962
00:50:21,105 --> 00:50:23,281
With her, it was real.

963
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:27,285
And then it was back to reality.

00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,550
[bright music]

965
00:50:42,126 --> 00:50:43,431

00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:44,389
- Hey.

00:50:44,432 --> 00:50:45,085
- [Lorna] Hey guess what?

968
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:46,086
- What?

969
00:50:46,130 --> 00:50:47,653
- I met Steven's drug dealer.

970
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:50,917
She's a little old lady
from Pasadena [giggling]

971
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,310
it was a riot.

972
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:55,443
Gray hair, pint-sized,
all the money she makes

973
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:57,576
goes directly to her
grandkids' college fund.

974
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,405
I, uh, I bought an ounce.

975
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:01,928
I can't keep
mooching off Steven.

976
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:03,930
Even he was starting
to complain.

977
00:51:03,973 --> 00:51:05,410
- I don't see how you can stand

978
00:51:05,453 --> 00:51:06,976
spending so much time with
him, he's such a blowhard.

979
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:09,414
- Oh I just tune him out
when he goes on like that.

980
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:11,720
- He's a jerk to me,
not that you'd notice.

981
00:51:11,764 --> 00:51:13,461
- He is not, he likes you a lot.

982
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:14,810
[laughing]

983
00:51:14,854 --> 00:51:16,377
- Oh bullshit, at his
wife's birthday party,

984
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:18,031
he was being such an asshole.

985
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,728
Making fun of the
way I told that joke

986
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:21,295
while he was putting
his arms around you.

987
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,166
- He was drunk.

988
00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:23,428
- He's always drunk.

989
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:25,430
And he's an asshole
when he's drunk.

990
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:27,258
Ergo, he's always an asshole.

991
00:51:27,301 --> 00:51:28,737
- He's not an asshole!

992
00:51:28,781 --> 00:51:30,087
- If he wasn't your pot
buddy, your drinking buddy,

993
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,436
you'd think he was an asshole.

994
00:51:31,479 --> 00:51:33,002
- You know what that was
about at Barb's party?

995
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:33,960
- What?

996
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:36,180
- She had invited Butch Tyler,

997
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:37,833
who she clearly wants to fuck.

998
00:51:37,877 --> 00:51:39,313
And she made that big deal about

999
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:41,315
how couples shouldn't
sit next to each other,

1000
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,535
so she could sit next
to Butch all night.

1001
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:44,840
It's her 40th birthday

1002
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:47,669
and she treats her
husband with contempt.

1003
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:49,889
So, yeah, he flirted with me,

1004
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,717
and yeah, he got
a little drunk--

1005
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,761
- You always have
an excuse for him,

1006
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:54,633
you're so understanding
of Steven.

1007
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:57,157
- We're both going through
a hard time right now.

1008
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,941
He's out of work.

1009
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:02,293
He's stuck in a rental and
his wife's going around

1010
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:03,816
looking at houses they
couldn't possibly afford.

1011
00:52:03,859 --> 00:52:06,384
- See you don't get it, he's
taking you down with him.

1012
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:08,168
- Steven's not
taking me anywhere.

1013
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,822
I'm perfectly capable of
bringing myself down, thank you.

1014
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:12,041
- Why do you think he can't
get arrested in this town?

1015
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,305
Because he's a drunk,
he is not sharp.

1016
00:52:14,348 --> 00:52:15,436
Would you trust Steven

1017
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,090
to produce an
80-million-dollar movie?

1018
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,570
50? 20? 10?

1019
00:52:18,613 --> 00:52:20,659
- Do you know what we talk
about when we're together?

1020
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:22,226
- What, I have no idea.

1021
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:24,837
- Usually nothing, we
just sit in his backyard,

1022
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,187
we have a little wine,
we smoke a little dope.

1023
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:28,971
Stare up at the trees.

1024
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:31,060
- Yeah, but what do
you get out of that?

1025
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:35,674
- A break, I just need a break.

1026
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:38,677
You make me feel unproductive,
you make me feel--

1027
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,157
- Well, you are unproductive.

1028
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,549
- Well yeah, I know that.

1029
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:42,898
You think I like not being able

1030
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:45,074
to get out of bed
in the morning?

1031
00:52:45,118 --> 00:52:46,467
Not being able to write?

1032
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:50,645
I earned half of everything
we've got from writing,

1033
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:52,560
and right now the
idea of writing again

1034
00:52:52,604 --> 00:52:54,606
fills me with nothing but dread.

1035
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:58,566
Just like coming home and
seeing you fills me with dread.

1036
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,961
'Cause I know all we do
is get into it and argue

1037
00:53:02,004 --> 00:53:03,223
and I'm sick of
it, do you hear me?

1038
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,746
I'm sick of it!

1039
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,660
- Where are you going?

1040
00:53:05,704 --> 00:53:07,096
- To pick up our son at school,

1041
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,533
if that's all right with you.

1042
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:10,796
And tonight I am taking
Annie to the Comedy Store

1043
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,363
to see JoJo's act.

1044
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:13,755
- There's that meeting at Zach's
tomorrow morning, remember?

1045
00:53:13,799 --> 00:53:16,497
- Yeah, I remember,
I'm not stupid.

1046
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:18,369
I'll be home at 10, Mother.

1047
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,936
- Okay, wait, wait.
- I have to get Walt.

1048
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:22,373
- You got a couple minutes.

1049
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:26,812
Look, I don't wanna fight.

1050
00:53:28,553 --> 00:53:29,597
I don't.

1051
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:34,428
I understand why you just wanna
sit and stare at the trees.

1052
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:37,649
It's been tough going through
all this stuff, it's no fun.

1053
00:53:38,563 --> 00:53:39,346
- No, it's not.

1054
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:42,958
- I miss you when
you're not here.

1055
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:44,612
- You miss that I'm not working.

1056
00:53:44,656 --> 00:53:46,440
- No, no, I miss you.

1057
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:49,487
I miss going for
long walks with you.

1058
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,967
I miss lunch at Marmalade's.

1059
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:55,971
[sighing]

1060
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:58,365
I miss writing a sexy
scene and taking a break

1061
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:02,151
and acting it out.

1062
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:11,552
- I'm not going
to drink tonight.

1063
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:15,295
I'm going to get on
a better schedule.

1064
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:20,257
You can wake me up
tomorrow morning at 9:30.

1065
00:54:22,215 --> 00:54:24,304
Okay?

1066
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,306
- Oh.
- Okay, okay, okay?

1067
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:29,875
Okay.

1068
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:30,702
- Okay.

1069
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,925
Let's go get our son.

1070
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,536
[school bell ringing]

1071
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:39,363
- Hi Dad!

1072
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:42,409
- [Mark] Hey, buddy.

1073
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:43,671
- Hey Mom, hey Dad.

1074
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:47,371
Can you pour mustard and
ketchup on me like a hotdog?

1075
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:52,158
- Hey, maybe, maybe, maybe.
- Okay.

1076
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:55,770
[funky music]
[screaming and yelling]

1077
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,206
Time for the pickles!

1078
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,121
- [Lorna] On your foot!

1079
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:01,907
- [Mark] Pickles, whoa!

1080
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:06,607
- We should do this every day!

1081
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:08,870
[yelling]

1082
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:14,441
- Oh, stop!

1083
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,066
[car engine]

1084
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:41,990
[knocking on door]

1085
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:42,948
- I'm going to bed.

1086
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:46,168
- Well, where have you been?

1087
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,654
- Uh, after we saw her act,
JoJo wanted to go to this party.

1088
00:55:53,698 --> 00:55:56,396
Danny DeVito was there
with his kids, great kids.

1089
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,877
- Well, I don't think
they were there 'til two.

1090
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,227
- Oh, I wanted to
go way before but.

1091
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:05,536
She only had three drinks
but they were doubles.

1092
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:07,494
Anyway, I didn't dare
have her drop me off

1093
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:09,278
and then drive herself
home, so I drove your car.

1094
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:11,455
It's a really nice
car, by the way.

1095
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:12,760
- Thanks.

1096
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,545
- Oh, she threw up
in the driveway so.

1097
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:22,596
- So, uh, I guess you
need a ride home, huh?

1098
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,684
- Yeah.

1099
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,307
Are you okay?

1100
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:43,661
- I remember my mom hosing down

1101
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:46,794
my stepdad's puke off
the stoop of our house.

1102
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,233
I'm not going to
become my mother.

1103
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,803
- Well, I promise I won't
go out with her again

1104
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,544
for anything that
involves alcohol.

1105
00:57:00,155 --> 00:57:02,941
- My birthday's Saturday.
- Really?

1106
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:04,595
And what do you want
for your birthday?

1107
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:06,684
- I don't know.

1108
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:08,337
I do know, actually.

1109
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,817
A progressive scan DVD player

1110
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:12,994
with DTS and THX-Ultra decoding.

1111
00:57:13,865 --> 00:57:16,258
- Whoa, boys and their toys.

1112
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:17,825
- [Mark] Yeah.

1113
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,697
- Well, I can't
give you that, but,

1114
00:57:20,567 --> 00:57:21,916
I could give you a blow job.

1115
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:29,968
- Well that's certainly the
best offer I've gotten so far.

1116
00:57:31,926 --> 00:57:33,493
- But you're from New Hampshire

1117
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:36,017
and you don't ski the last
run or however that went, so.

1118
00:57:36,061 --> 00:57:37,758
- Yeah, huh.

1119
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:39,760
- Oh, I guess we'll
just have to settle

1120
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,806
for a pre-B-day kiss.

1121
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:47,028
Good night.

1122
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:00,694
- Shaq Number Four,
I hardly knew ye.

1123
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:02,261
- [Goldfish] Better him than me.

1124
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:07,875
- Ah, my genius
writers, dove Lorna?

1125
00:58:07,919 --> 00:58:08,876
- Oh, she's come
down with the flu

1126
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,399
so she won't be joining us.

1127
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:11,662
- Oh, poor thing.

1128
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:13,098
I'll have Kiyomi fix her
up some chicken soup.

1129
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:14,621
- Very sweet of you.

1130
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:16,797
- [Zach] And, uh, you
can take it right home.

1131
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:18,669
Why did you make
the secretary older?

1132
00:58:18,712 --> 00:58:19,887
- [Mark] A studio note,

1133
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:21,106
they thought it'd be
better if she was--

1134
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:22,629
- [Zach] I don't care
what they thought.

1135
00:58:22,673 --> 00:58:24,849
You let me deal with the
studio, I'll protect you.

1136
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:26,415
- [Mark] All right.

1137
00:58:26,459 --> 00:58:29,767
- Okay, now I'm not sure
hashish is right for our girl.

1138
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,420
It seems pretty tame.

1139
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:32,987
- Yeah, I agree.

1140
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:36,643
But we thought cocaine was
too passe and heroin too much.

1141
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:37,905
- What about ecstasy?

1142
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,341
And that would get her
in trouble with the firm

1143
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:40,908
but it's not too much.

1144
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:41,692
Ever done it?

1145
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:42,867
- Uh, no, no, no.

1146
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:44,869
I've never done
anything more than pot.

1147
00:58:45,826 --> 00:58:47,001
- It wasn't around
in my drug days.

1148
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:48,829
It sounds right, though.

1149
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,702
- I'm going to Book Soup.

1150
00:58:51,745 --> 00:58:52,964
Need anything?

1151
00:58:53,007 --> 00:58:55,140
- Uh, no thanks.

1152
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:57,098
Brenda, Mark, Brenda.

1153
00:58:57,142 --> 00:58:58,709
- Hi.
- Oh, I loved your movie.

1154
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,319
- Well, thanks.
- It was great.

1155
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:02,103
- It was just a bear movie
but for a bear movie,

1156
00:59:02,147 --> 00:59:03,670
it was pretty good.

1157
00:59:03,714 --> 00:59:06,891
- The best part was when
that, uh, African-American,

1158
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:08,762
I can't remember his name

1159
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:11,852
and that bear came outta
nowhere, it was creepy.

1160
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:17,205
Anyway, nice to meet you.

1161
00:59:17,249 --> 00:59:18,032
- You, too.

1162
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:24,343
- A-M-W.

1163
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,912
[keyboard clicking]

1164
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:30,567
I met her at this
fashion show in Chicago.

1165
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,917
So when she calls to tell me
she's coming out for a week,

1166
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,745
I say she can stay here.

1167
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:37,399
Then last night we're
in bed and she goes,

1168
00:59:37,443 --> 00:59:40,751
I'm not sure about goin'
back to Chicago right now.

1169
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:42,143
It's winter.

1170
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,189
I might sign with this
modeling agency out here.

1171
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:46,452
And I felt my blood run cold.

1172
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:49,586
I told her from the start,
I am not the marrying kind.

1173
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:51,892
Try to get that
line in the script.

1174
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:53,851
I'm not the marrying
kind, I like that.

1175
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:54,939
- Okay.

1176
00:59:56,505 --> 01:00:00,814
- Okay, look, if the studio
tries giving you any more notes,

1177
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:03,469
you tell 'em to go
through me first.

1178
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,907
We'll talk some more
in a couple of weeks.

1179
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:09,475
I'm going to Bermuda, Sting
is letting me use his house.

1180
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:11,608
- Nice.
- Yeah, I know.

1181
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:13,653
Every day I think
about what I've got.

1182
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,829
I was living on the street
starting at 12 years old.

1183
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:17,657
Now look at this.

1184
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,050
I just hope they keep
lettin' me make pictures.

1185
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:21,052
- Oh, you'll be like John
Huston if you wanna be.

1186
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:22,575
Directing with an oxygen mask.

1187
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,622
- Yeah, I love making pictures.

1188
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:27,711
It's all I love.

1189
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:34,195
- See, I'm not my mother.

1190
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:36,763
I pay someone to hose
down the puke for me.

1191
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:41,376
Zach loved the laundry
room scene you wrote.

1192
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:46,817
- That was a good
scene, wasn't it?

1193
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:49,689
- Yeah, but he wants more of a
shorthand between our couple.

1194
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:52,997
- Peel back the
layers of the onion.

1195
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,607
He didn't say that, did he?

1196
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,087
- No, thank God.

1197
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:03,268
- We've been together forever,
what do we talk about?

1198
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:04,661
- I don't know.

1199
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:07,664
Zach's going to
Bermuda for two weeks.

1200
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:11,058
- I know, we had our
honeymoon in Bermuda.

1201
01:01:11,102 --> 01:01:13,452
We could have them
talk about that.

1202
01:01:13,495 --> 01:01:14,975
Gag.

1203
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:16,716
- I loved our honeymoon.

1204
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,630
- No [chuckling] no.

1205
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:21,634
I mean, gag, the characters
talking about it.

1206
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,680
I hate it in movies
when people do that.

1207
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:28,249
No, it was nice
when we were there.

1208

01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,711
- You know exactly how
this is going to end.

1386
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:49,277
- How?

1387
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:52,411
- You're gonna see me for
awhile, we're gonna be friends,

1388
01:12:52,455 --> 01:12:53,673
and then you're gonna realize

1389
01:12:53,717 --> 01:12:55,327
that it's not gonna
go beyond that.

1390
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,069
You'll lose interest
and it'll end.

1391
01:12:58,112 --> 01:13:00,680
It happens to me all the time.

1392
01:13:00,724 --> 01:13:02,639
- So you're used to
guys falling for you.

1393
01:13:02,682 --> 01:13:04,205
- Yep.

1394
01:13:04,249 --> 01:13:06,077
- Yeah, but you said that we
wouldn't go beyond friends.

1395
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,208
Look what happened.

1396
01:13:07,252 --> 01:13:09,472
- Well, that was a fluke.

1397
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:11,082
- No it wasn't, nope.

1398
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:13,519
- Yes it was, I'd never even
gone skinny dipping before.

1399
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:14,346
- No it wasn't.

1400
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,129
A fluke? No.

1401
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,740
I don't like that word.

1402
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:19,525
- Okay, well, you can call it
whatever you need to call it

1403
01:13:19,569 --> 01:13:20,700
but that is what it is.

1404
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:22,310
- No, it wasn't a
fluke, I'll tell ya why.

1405
01:13:22,354 --> 01:13:24,269
Let's say it was my
friend Boston in the pool.

1406
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:27,141
You wouldn't have done
that with him, right?

1407
01:13:27,185 --> 01:13:30,580
- No.
- See, it wasn't a fluke.

1408
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,712
- But I might of done
that with someone else.

1409
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:37,021
- Okay, okay,
here's what I think.

1410
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:41,460
It was a fluke if you
hadn't been drunk.

1411
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:43,288
If you hadn't been
skinny dipping.

1412
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:44,724
If the water had been warmer

1413
01:13:44,768 --> 01:13:47,074
and other people had been
in the pool, if, if, if.

1414
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:50,208
I say, it was such a fluke
that it was meant to be.

1415
01:13:51,688 --> 01:13:52,732
- Okay.

1416
01:13:54,734 --> 01:13:58,042
- Come to a hotel with me.
- No, no, no.

1417
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:00,436
- Come on, please?
- No.

1418
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:01,828
- Come on [laughing]
- No.

1419
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:04,614
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'd feel guilty.

1420
01:14:04,657 --> 01:14:06,529
- Did you feel
guilt about before?

1421
01:14:07,617 --> 01:14:09,488
- Guilt comes with climax.

1422
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:13,187
- So if you climax twice
then the two guilties

1423
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:14,754
will cancel each other out.

1424
01:14:14,798 --> 01:14:16,669
- Twice?
- Mm-hm.

1425
01:14:16,713 --> 01:14:18,758
- Oh, promises, promises.

1426
01:14:22,153 --> 01:14:24,198
- I never even got to kiss you.

1427
01:14:24,242 --> 01:14:25,809
[laughing gently]

1428
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:27,811
- You're gonna get to know
me and you're gonna realize

1429
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:30,422
that I'm not the
person you think I am.

1430
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,425
- See you think I've put you
up on a pedestal or something.

1431
01:14:34,513 --> 01:14:35,862
- I'm just a Joe.

1432
01:14:35,906 --> 01:14:37,342
- I'm just a Joe, too.

1433
01:14:37,385 --> 01:14:40,214
- Oh, thanks for bringin'
me down to your level.

1434
01:14:40,258 --> 01:14:41,955
- I think about
you all the time.

1435
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:46,090
I have imaginary
conversations with you.

1436
01:14:47,613 --> 01:14:49,528
I've even had an imaginary
conversation with you where

1437
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:52,313
I tell you that I have imaginary
conversations with you.

1438
01:14:55,055 --> 01:14:58,015
I just, I just
wanna be with you.

1439
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:07,285
But if that can't happen
then I'll settle for friends.

1440
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,635
I can handle that.

1441
01:15:10,897 --> 01:15:14,814
- Good, I'm not 100%
convinced, but good.

1442
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:21,517
- Friends, friends is good.

1443
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,825
[gentle piano music]

1444
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:28,045
I pull these out on
occasion, a reminder.

1445
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:30,438
Yeah, I know they're
sappy but they're real.

1446
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,096
We used to tape them to
the wall in the bathroom

1447
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,489
of our first apartment.

1448
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:41,972
I look in the mirror,
what do I see?

1449
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:44,931
There's so much of
you inside of me.

1450
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:47,804
I'm in a dream, alive,
a dream come true.

1451
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:51,590
Could there be so much
of me inside of you?

1452
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:54,898
I know the answer, but
I still want to hear.

1453
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:59,946
[Lorna humming]
[shower running]

1454
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:05,038
- Even if I had a brain
transplant, ba-doom.

1455
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,605
- Oh that's the best one yet.

1456
01:16:08,781 --> 01:16:10,348
Uh-oh.
- What?

1457
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:12,263
[Lorna yelping]

1458
01:16:12,306 --> 01:16:14,831
- Make room for Daddy.

1459
01:16:14,874 --> 01:16:18,138
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1460
01:16:18,182 --> 01:16:20,967
[moaning lightly]

1461
01:16:29,933 --> 01:16:31,587
- What are you doing?

1462
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:34,067
- I'm just reading these.

1463
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,853
- Golden oldies.

1464
01:16:37,941 --> 01:16:40,683
- Not that old, classic rock.

1465
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:45,992
- Come to bed, hon.

1466
01:16:46,036 --> 01:16:47,559
I hate sleeping without you.

1467
01:16:51,868 --> 01:16:54,610
- [Walter] Hey, it
tickles, it tickles!

1468
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:56,829
- [Lorna] Hey, hey,
hey, it's fair.

1469
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:58,918
- Mommy, that tickles!

1470
01:16:59,919 --> 01:17:02,139
- Oh, did Mommy make these?

1471
01:17:02,182 --> 01:17:03,836
- Yeah, I'm gonna hang
'em up on the door.

1472
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,750
Ow, you made me fall!

1473
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:06,578
- Great, can I, uh, talk to you?

1474
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,841
- Yeah, in a sec?

1475
01:17:08,885 --> 01:17:09,973
- Sure.
- Okay.

1476
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:11,844
- Come on!

1477
01:17:18,851 --> 01:17:20,984
- We still have ants, I
can't stand it anymore.

1478
01:17:21,027 --> 01:17:23,029
- The guy's comin'
to spray tomorrow.

1479
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:24,291
- Well, tell him to
get under the house,

1480
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:26,250
'cause there must be a
nest in the foundation.

1481
01:17:29,862 --> 01:17:31,211
I heard the phone, what's up?

1482
01:17:32,909 --> 01:17:33,692
- It was Brian.

1483
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:36,347
We're fired.

1484
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,001
- What?

1485
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:39,567
- Studio is not gonna hire
us to write another draft.

1486
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:42,048
Apparently in Bermuda Zach
was so inspired by our script

1487
01:17:42,092 --> 01:17:43,963
that he decided to
rewrite it himself.

1488
01:17:45,138 --> 01:17:48,881
- That asshole!

1489
01:17:48,925 --> 01:17:50,056
- He didn't even call
us to let us know.

1490
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,928
His genius writers.

1491
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:53,843
- We worked our ass
off for him ten months.

1492
01:17:53,886 --> 01:17:56,628
- I think that was
part of the problem.

1493
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,151
- Oh, here you go.

1494
01:17:58,195 --> 01:17:59,805
- We shouldn't have taken
ten months, we were slow.

1495
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:01,894
- You don't know why Zach
decided to do what he did

1496
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:03,330
and you will never know--

1497
01:18:03,374 --> 01:18:05,028
- We should have written
two scripts in ten months

1498
01:18:05,071 --> 01:18:06,420
and made twice the money.

1499
01:18:07,944 --> 01:18:09,859
Brian says we have to take
more bites out of the apple.

1500
01:18:09,902 --> 01:18:11,425
- Brian can go fuck himself.

1501
01:18:11,469 --> 01:18:13,079
- Studios want new
material to read.

1502
01:18:13,123 --> 01:18:15,299
You have to keep feeding
the beast, you know that.

1503
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:17,301
This is a fashion industry
and if we don't watch it

1504
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:19,172
we're gonna be out of fashion,
like your friend, Steven.

1505
01:18:19,216 --> 01:18:21,087
- Well, why don't
you do more huh?

1506
01:18:21,131 --> 01:18:23,046
Yourself, why can't
you be the man for once

1507
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:24,134
and do the work?

1508
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:25,396
- What, you don't
think I want to?

1509
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:26,963
You told me the stuff
I write alone sucks.

1510
01:18:27,006 --> 01:18:28,312
- It does suck.

1511
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:29,748
- What am I supposed to
do, turn in shitty work?

1512
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:32,577
- You're supposed
to write better!

1513
01:18:46,983 --> 01:18:49,159
I want a drink, do
you want a drink?

1514
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:51,727
- No, thanks.

1515
01:18:53,163 --> 01:18:54,555
- No, you'll just
have another brownie

1516
01:18:54,599 --> 01:18:55,948
like you're so in control.

1517
01:18:59,082 --> 01:19:01,693
[door slamming]

1518
01:19:05,001 --> 01:19:06,611
- On April 15th, 18--

1519
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:07,830
- [Mark] No cheating.

1520
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:10,833
- 65, Abruham Lincoln was--

1521
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:14,575
- Abraham.
- That's what I said.

1522
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:17,796
Abraham Lincoln
was assassinated.

1523
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,494
- Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln,
how did you enjoy the play?

1524
01:19:20,538 --> 01:19:21,713
You sound great, Walt.

1525
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,627
- Thanks.

1526
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,237
- I'll be back in half an hour.

1527
01:19:24,281 --> 01:19:25,325
- Where you going

1528
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:26,109
- Um,

1529
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,329
just a sec.

1530
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:30,156
- Read it again.

1531
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:37,120
- Um, Steven ran out.

1532
01:19:37,163 --> 01:19:39,992
I'm just gonna take
him a couple of joints.

1533
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:42,516
I'm gonna be right back.

1534
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,996
- Okay, but it's really
not a good night to party.

1535
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,781
I'm worn out and I'd really like

1536
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:46,956
if you could put him to bed.

1537
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:48,392
Plus tomorrow
morning's his play.

1538
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:50,220
- Just going there and
then comin' right back.

1539
01:19:50,263 --> 01:19:51,047
- Okay.

1540
01:19:55,399 --> 01:19:58,228
[clock ticking]

1541
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:06,018
By 2 a.m. I feared that
something terrible had happened.

1542
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:08,020
She could be in a
drunken car accident.

1543
01:20:08,064 --> 01:20:09,979
She could be dead.

1544
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:11,632
I could feel it in my gut.

1545
01:20:11,676 --> 01:20:15,158
Feel that something awful was
happening at this very moment.

1546
01:20:21,033 --> 01:20:24,645
[Lorna and Steven laughing]

1547
01:20:28,214 --> 01:20:29,999
- Marko! Polo!

1548
01:20:30,042 --> 01:20:32,305
- Steven, Steven, go home.

1549
01:20:32,349 --> 01:20:33,785
- [Lorna] Oh, don't be mad.

1550
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,440
- No, no, just one more
drink, for all of us.

1551
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:38,094
- [Mark] Steven, go
home to your wife,

1552
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,051
she's been calling all night
and it's three in the morning.

1553
01:20:39,095 --> 01:20:40,618
- Ah, relax, just one more.

1554
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:42,359
- I'm telling you to get the
fuck outta here and go home.

1555
01:20:42,402 --> 01:20:45,144
- Aw, you don't have
to be like that.

1556
01:20:45,188 --> 01:20:46,015
It's okay, Steven.

1557
01:20:46,058 --> 01:20:47,886
- No, no, it's not okay.

1558
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:50,410
Go home, you fucking
asshole, go home.

1559
01:20:50,454 --> 01:20:52,543
- I don't know why
you're getting so upset.

1560
01:20:52,586 --> 01:20:53,457
Nothing happened.

1561
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:56,155
- Go home, I'm warning you.

1562
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:57,069
- Mark.

1563
01:20:57,113 --> 01:20:58,505
- Honey, go inside, all right?

1564
01:20:58,549 --> 01:21:00,290
For God's sake, Walter's
play is tomorrow morning.

1565
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,031
- Yeah, I know,
I'm gonna be there.

1566
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:04,337
I'm setting the alarm, I
told you I'm gonna be there.

1567
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:05,643
- Right, right, just go to bed.

1568
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,210
- You know, don't
boss me around.

1569
01:21:07,253 --> 01:21:08,820
You're always trying
to control me.

1570
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,691
You wanna get wasted it's okay.

1571
01:21:10,735 --> 01:21:12,258
But I tell you I
wanna stop drinking

1572
01:21:12,302 --> 01:21:13,477
and you want an ecstasy party.

1573
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:14,391
Did you ever think about that?

1574
01:21:14,434 --> 01:21:15,305
- Honey, go to bed, okay?

1575
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:17,263
Just go to bed.
- No, nope.

1576
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:18,917
- Go to bed.
- Nope.

1577
01:21:18,961 --> 01:21:20,440
- Go to bed.
- Nope.

1578
01:21:23,966 --> 01:21:26,794
- And you, you selfish
fucking prick, leave.

1579
01:21:26,838 --> 01:21:28,057
- Lorna--

1580
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,275
- Don't look at
her, motherfucker.

1581
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:30,320
I am telling you to
turn around and go home.

1582
01:21:30,363 --> 01:21:32,017
Now, get out!

1583
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:34,628
[thudding]
[Lorna screaming]

1584
01:21:34,672 --> 01:21:37,240
- Jesus, Mark, you're
acting totally ridiculous.

1585
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:38,894
What's the matter with you?

1586
01:21:38,937 --> 01:21:40,373
- You are not coming in my
house ever again, you hear me?

1587
01:21:40,417 --> 01:21:41,853
- I don't know why you're
so upset about this.

1588
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,420
There's nothing
going on between us.

1589
01:21:43,463 --> 01:21:44,160
- You're an asshole, a loser,
a has been who never was.

1590
01:21:44,203 --> 01:21:45,770
- You've got it all wrong.

1591
01:21:45,813 --> 01:21:46,553
- Goddammit, can't
you get it through

1592
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:47,946
your thick fucking skull

1593
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,296
that I just want you
to go fucking home?

1594
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,690
- Oh, wow, I think I've
had enough of this.

1595
01:21:54,344 --> 01:21:55,127
- Look.

1596
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:06,573
This is your last chance,
Mark, I'm warning you.

1597
01:22:09,141 --> 01:22:10,664
- Fuck off.

1598
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:12,928
- [Steven] I mean
it, your last chance.

1599
01:22:14,016 --> 01:22:18,237
- On April 15th, 1865,

1600
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:22,198
Abraham Lincoln was ass-inated.

1601
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:25,636
[light chuckling]

1602
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:30,119
Honest Abe had become our
most beloved president.

1603
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:32,599
[clapping]

1604
01:22:32,643 --> 01:22:34,862
- [Teacher] Excellent
show, everyone.

1605
01:22:34,906 --> 01:22:37,735
We wanna thank you, parents,
for coming out today to watch.

1606
01:22:37,778 --> 01:22:40,651
Uh, it means a great deal to
all your children here today.

1607
01:22:43,306 --> 01:22:45,961
Now, if you would, we're gonna
continue our math lesson.

1608
01:22:46,004 --> 01:22:47,310
- Aren't you gonna say hi?

1609
01:22:48,267 --> 01:22:50,878
- Oh, hi.

1610
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:51,705
- Where's Lorna?

1611
01:22:52,576 --> 01:22:54,360
- She's at home.

1612
01:22:54,404 --> 01:22:55,187
- Another late night?

1613
01:22:58,277 --> 01:22:59,539
We'll talk later.

1614
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,715
Let's get the kids
together for a play date.

1615
01:23:05,241 --> 01:23:06,807
- [Teacher] If we look
at exercise three-eight,

1616
01:23:06,851 --> 01:23:09,071
you notice six, six times five.

1617
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:13,292
- And this is when things
start to get dicey, I confess.

1618
01:23:13,336 --> 01:23:16,382
I'd had no sleep,
my head throbbed.

1619
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:18,297
I felt like a guest
in my own life

1620
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:20,212
as the world spun without me.

1621
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:23,346
And I craved a
Nestle's crunch bar.

1622
01:23:25,217 --> 01:23:27,741
[quirky music]

1623
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:03,038
And then came the crash.

1624
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,865
[shopping carts crashing]

1625
01:24:04,909 --> 01:24:06,345
Sorry.
- Mark!

1626
01:24:08,304 --> 01:24:10,175
- Hey.
- Hi.

1627
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:14,397
- Well I hope they don't
raise my insurance over this.

1628
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,268
- Uh, no damage done.

1629
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:18,009
Hey, did you see Billy Crystal?

1630
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:22,057
I saw Billy Crystal over
in the deli section.

1631
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:25,886
Are you okay?

1632
01:24:27,105 --> 01:24:28,280
No offense, but you look
like you should have

1633
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:29,847
coins over your eyes.

1634
01:24:32,502 --> 01:24:33,416
- No offense taken.

1635
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:36,723
- You having one of those days?

1636
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:42,512
- Yeah, I know shit has to roll
downhill but why do I always

1637
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:45,123
have to be the one
stuck in fuckin' valley?

1638
01:24:47,169 --> 01:24:49,301
- I'm right down
there with you, kiddo.

1639
01:24:51,129 --> 01:24:52,174
You and me both.

1640
01:24:53,044 --> 01:24:55,220
- And she meant it, too.

1641
01:24:55,264 --> 01:24:57,483
Who knows what was going
on behind her closed doors,

1642
01:24:57,527 --> 01:25:00,138
but I'm sure it wasn't
picture-perfect.

1643
01:25:00,182 --> 01:25:02,575
Not for her, not for anyone.

1644
01:25:04,403 --> 01:25:07,014
- Well, it's nice
running into you.

1645
01:25:09,582 --> 01:25:10,627
- You, too.

1646
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:16,850
- Hey, why don't you think
about gettin' some junk food

1647
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:17,808
next time, will ya?

1648
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,903
- Danni!

1649
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,690
Hey.

1650
01:25:30,734 --> 01:25:32,388
- You are losing
control, my friend.

1651
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:36,435
- I just thought that you
might need some of these, too.

1652
01:25:38,437 --> 01:25:41,092
They're dark chocolate
with almonds.

1653
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:43,616
- Thanks.

1654
01:25:49,231 --> 01:25:50,014
- Don't go.

1655
01:26:26,964 --> 01:26:28,618
Tell me this is real.

1656
01:26:30,446 --> 01:26:31,403
- It's real.

1657
01:26:31,447 --> 01:26:33,840
- Yeah, it's really you.
- Yeah.

1658
01:26:36,669 --> 01:26:39,803
[gentle piano music]

1659
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:15,578
[moaning]

1660
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:30,984
- You taste so good.

1661
01:27:55,357 --> 01:27:57,576
[moaning]

1662
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,598
[gentle gasping]

1663
01:28:25,474 --> 01:28:27,476
- You're gonna take this
as a backhanded compliment,

1664
01:28:27,519 --> 01:28:30,653
but you know what was so nice?

1665
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:32,785
- What?

1666
01:28:32,829 --> 01:28:36,920
- Well Brock is really
huge and, well, it hurts.

1667
01:28:36,963 --> 01:28:38,661
But you felt just right.

1668
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:44,406
- Ah, the advantages
of a small dick.

1669
01:28:44,449 --> 01:28:47,060
- I didn't say small.

1670
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:50,107
- Oh, I'm exactly
average, I measured.

1671
01:28:50,934 --> 01:28:52,544
- We can never do this again.

1672
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:58,115
- That's what you
said about the pool.

1673
01:28:58,158 --> 01:28:59,551
- I mean it this time.

1674
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:03,947
- I wrote a poem about the pool.

1675
01:29:04,861 --> 01:29:06,384
- Oh, no.

1676
01:29:06,428 --> 01:29:08,038
- Yeah, I didn't tell
you 'cause I was afraid

1677
01:29:08,081 --> 01:29:09,474
it would freak you out.

1678
01:29:10,388 --> 01:29:11,781
- Good thinking.

1679
01:29:13,435 --> 01:29:16,351
- It's a couple syllables too
long for a haiku but it'll do.

1680
01:29:18,918 --> 01:29:20,137
Do you wanna hear it?

1681
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:20,964
- Okay.

1682
01:29:23,706 --> 01:29:26,404
- I remember when the
earth stood still,

1683
01:29:27,579 --> 01:29:32,584
and nothing moved
except me inside you.

1684
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:08,577
- I am a non-functioning
member of society,

1685
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,970
once active, now not.

1686
01:30:20,066 --> 01:30:20,850
How'd he do?

1687
01:30:21,894 --> 01:30:23,635
- Great, great.

1688
01:30:25,724 --> 01:30:28,031
I could tell he was nervous
because he said his stomach hurt

1689
01:30:28,074 --> 01:30:30,076
but he was great.

1690
01:30:34,167 --> 01:30:35,778
- I'm fucking up.

1691
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:41,914
I'm a fuck-up.

1692
01:30:47,703 --> 01:30:48,791
I'm a fuck-up.

1693
01:31:01,673 --> 01:31:02,892
Remember Bermuda?

1694
01:31:04,589 --> 01:31:05,721
Pink sand?

1695
01:31:06,939 --> 01:31:10,508
And us sneaking
out the silverware

1696
01:31:10,552 --> 01:31:12,815
engraved with the initial
of my new last name?

1697
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:20,039
Don't forget that.

1698
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:25,958
Don't forget the good years.

1699
01:31:26,002 --> 01:31:28,265
We had a lot of good years.

1700
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,193
- I have a confession to make.

1701
01:31:46,152 --> 01:31:47,284
- What is it?

1702
01:31:51,723 --> 01:31:56,162
- I, uh...

1703
01:31:56,206 --> 01:31:58,600
I tried to kill
Shaq Number Eight.

1704
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:02,081
- What?

1705
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:05,911
- Yeah, I went in to
feed him this morning

1706
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:10,786
and I expected him to be
dead, because they'd all died,

1707
01:32:10,829 --> 01:32:13,745
one by one, and I'd
just fed the cats

1708
01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:15,878
and the hamsters and
the plants and Walter

1709
01:32:15,921 --> 01:32:20,752
and I was just sick
of it, and I was,

1710
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:24,713
I was really sick of waiting
for this fish to die.

1711
01:32:27,846 --> 01:32:32,851
So, I took him and I
flushed him down the toilet.

1712
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:42,905
[toilet flushing]

1713
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:01,837
And then it came back,
I couldn't believe it.

1714
01:33:06,058 --> 01:33:09,235
He had to live, so he did.

1715
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:19,158
We're still here, you and I.

1716
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:22,597
We made it.

1717
01:33:24,816 --> 01:33:26,992
- Yeah, yeah, whatever asshole.

1718
01:33:27,036 --> 01:33:28,733
Just hurry up and feed me.

1719
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:34,391
- So now the time has
come, time to decide.

1720
01:33:34,434 --> 01:33:38,656
You, a jury of my peers
bathed in the screen's glow.

1721
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,831
Am I guilty?

1722
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,572
And of what crime?

1723
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,312
Adultery?

1724
01:33:42,355 --> 01:33:43,792
Illicit drug use?

1725
01:33:43,835 --> 01:33:45,489
Attempted murder of a goldfish?

1726
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:49,188
You could convict me of all
of these and more, I suppose.

1727
01:33:50,363 --> 01:33:53,192
I have no excuses but
I have my reasons.

1728
01:33:54,411 --> 01:33:57,109
Yet I submit to you
that I am truly guilty

1729
01:33:57,153 --> 01:33:58,458
of only one thing:

1730
01:34:02,419 --> 01:34:03,202
Of being human.

1731
01:34:05,422 --> 01:34:06,945
- Of being human.

1732
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,734
- Of being human.

1733
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:14,083
- Of being human.

1734
01:34:15,084 --> 01:34:16,651
- Of being human.

1735
01:34:17,477 --> 01:34:20,611
[gentle piano music]

1736
01:34:38,803 --> 01:34:41,806
[keyboard clicking]
