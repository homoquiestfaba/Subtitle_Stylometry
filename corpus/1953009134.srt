1
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,587
 

2
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,752
 

3
00:00:16,794 --> 00:00:18,989
 

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,043
 

5
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,109
 

6
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:53,458
Man: Silence, please!

7
00:00:58,535 --> 00:01:00,298
 

8
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,202
 

9
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:11,110
Woman:
Take care, sir.

10
00:01:11,148 --> 00:01:12,911
 

11
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,815
 

12
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:16,080
 

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,951
 

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,491
 

15
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:28,228
 

16
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,617
 

17
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,183
 

18
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:37,830
 

19
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:42,567
 

20
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:44,631
 

21
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:51,412
 

22
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:55,141
Joe:
My dog is an Alsatian bitch.

23
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:57,449
Her name is Tulip.

24
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,354
I've never owned a dog
before her.

25
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,553
Alsatians have a bad reputation.

26
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:06,495
They are said to bite the hand
that feeds them.

27
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,967
Indeed, Tulip bit my hand once,
but accidentally.

28
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,628
She mistook it
for a rotten apple

29
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,194
we were both trying to grab
simultaneously.

30
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,642
One of her canines sank
into my thumb joint to the bone.

31
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,166
Oh, well.
We... we all make mistakes.

32
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:24,078
 
And she was dreadfully sorry.

33
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:26,674
She rolled over
with all her legs in the air,

34
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:30,016
and, later on, when she saw
the bandage on my hand,

35
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,520
she put herself in the corner,

36
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,580
the darkest corner
of the bedroom,

37
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,819
and stayed there
for the rest of the afternoon.

38
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:38,350
She could hardly do more
by way of apology,

39
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:41,057
for she'd become
so hysterically excited

40
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,623
at the mere hint
of being taken out for a walk

41
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,693
that she rushes into the kitchen
to grab the vegetables

42
00:03:46,737 --> 00:03:49,035
and scatters them
all about the corridor

43
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:50,903
as if they were rose petals,

44
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:54,672
marking her ascension
to heaven.

45
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:59,512
It seems to me
both touching and strange

46
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:02,780
that she should find the world
so wonderful.

47
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,118
 

48
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:10,752
# Piddle, piddle,
seal, and sign #

49
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:13,126
# I'll smell your ass #

50
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:15,654
# you smell mine #

51
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,466
# human beings
are prudes and bores #

52
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:22,995
# you smell my arse #

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,008
# I'll smell yours #

54
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:27,067
 

55
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,513
Choir: # human beings
are prudes and bores #

56
00:04:31,548 --> 00:04:33,880
# you smell my arse #

57
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:39,583
# I smell yours #

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,654
Joe:
When children are difficult,

59
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:49,257
the cause is often traced
to their home.

60
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:51,961
And it was upon Tulip's
first home

61
00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:55,062
that I blamed
her unsociable conduct.

62
00:04:55,105 --> 00:04:58,199
 

63
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,004
 

64
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:05,009
She had originally belonged
to some working-class people

65
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:07,778
who, though fond of her
in their way,

66
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,251
seldom took her out.

67
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:10,548
She was too excitable.

68
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:13,317
For nearly a year,
she scarcely left the house,

69
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:17,657
but spent her time mostly alone
in a tiny backyard

70
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,958
while they were at work all day.

71
00:05:19,997 --> 00:05:21,726
She could hardly be expected,
therefore,

72
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:25,496
to learn the ways of a world
she so rarely visited.
 

73
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,763
The only training
she ever received

74
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:31,467
was an occasional thrashing
for the destruction

75
00:05:31,508 --> 00:05:34,443
which her owners discovered
when they returned home.

76
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:37,038
 

77
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,742
 

78
00:05:39,783 --> 00:05:44,686
Alsatians, in particular,
do not take kindly to beatings.

79
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:47,121
They're too intelligent
and too nervous.

80
00:05:47,157 --> 00:05:49,125
 

81
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:54,229
It was from this life,

82
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:56,528
when she was 18 months old,
that I rescued her,

83
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,797
and to it that I attributed

84
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:02,896
the disturbances of her psyche.

85
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:06,568
Thereafter it was clear that
if she could have had her way,

86
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,341
she would never let me
out of her sight again.

87
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,814
 

88
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:53,148
 

89
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,259
 

90
00:06:58,462 --> 00:07:01,056
 

91
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,647
 

92
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:49,177
 

93
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:53,476
 

94
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,181
 

95
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:03,518
While I was extremely grateful

96
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,723
to the gallant stranger
who had come to my rescue,

97
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:08,492
Tulip's subsequent behavior

98
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:11,797
may have caused him
to regret his kindness.

99
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:15,737
The journey home
was, however, mercifully short,

100
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:19,333
and I held high expectations
of a less-fraught stroll

101
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:23,369
along the towpath of the thames
to my flat in putney.

102
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,826
She was so unused to
being out in the world

103
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:39,294
that she could not differentiate

104
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:42,526
between the swollen river
lapping the towpath

105
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,158
and a mere puddle.

106
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:47,364
She rushed into it
and immediately sank.

107
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,699
I hastened to her rescue,

108
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:55,074
but I could scarcely
help laughing

109
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:57,705
at the sight of her
when I heaved her out.

110
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,978
She was less amused than i.

111
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,746
This unexpected immersion

112
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:05,254
had one useful consequence,
however.

113
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:08,587
The coal dust in the yard
in which she had been confined

114
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,456
by her former owners

115
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:13,189
was washed clean away.

116
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:17,797
And so it was
that this beautiful creature

117
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:21,395
came into my life
and transformed it.

118
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:24,874
By the end
of that eventful first day,

119
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:28,207
she, too, had undergone
a metamorphosis,

120
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:31,146
from beggar maid to princess.

121
00:09:31,181 --> 00:09:32,671
And it was i,

122
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:36,208
the somewhat shabby hero
of my own storybook,

123
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:39,620
who had rescued her
and won her heart.

124
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,181
 

125
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:46,827
 

126
00:09:46,863 --> 00:09:49,696
In the journal
of general Bertrand,

127
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,667
Napoleon's grand marshal,

128
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,135
this entry occurs...

129
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,003
"1821, april 12.

130
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,376
At 10:30, the emperor passed
a large and well-formed motion."

131
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,676
I sympathize with the general.

132
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:13,451
However, Tulip's bowel movements
caused me even greater concern

133
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,859
since she has
two small canine anal glands

134
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:20,886
which Napoleon did not have.

135
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,195
Therefore, hers required
twofold the supervision.

136
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:27,067
 

137
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:30,163
These canine glands
produce a secretion

138
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:34,666
which is periodically released
by the passage of a...

139
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,475
general bertrand-pleasing form.

140
00:10:37,514 --> 00:10:39,982
 

141
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,610
If, however,
a dog is continually...

142
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:45,621
 
...loose in the bowels,

143
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:48,123
the glands become congested

144
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,092
and can form abscesses.

145
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,754
It was a misty
september morning,

146
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:56,197
and I had taken Tulip out
to relieve herself,

147
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,666
which she was peacefully doing.

148
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:02,798
It always pleases me to see her
perform this physical act.

149
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,775
Her ears lie back,
her head cranes forward,

150
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,371
and a mild, meditative look
settles on her face.

151
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:12,904
While we were
thus harmlessly engaged,

152
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:16,715
a cyclist shot around the corner
towards us.

153
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,983
Since Tulip
was safely on the pavement,

154
00:11:19,022 --> 00:11:21,513
I would not have noticed
this person at all

155
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:24,356
if he had not addressed me
as he flew past.

156
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:28,558
Try taking your dog
off the pavement to mess!

157
00:11:28,598 --> 00:11:30,589
One should not lose
one's temper,

158
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,624
but the remark stung me.

159
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:35,365
Joe:"what?
To be run over by you?

160
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,396
Well, try minding
your own business!"

161
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,964
I am and all!

162
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:40,703
He bawled
over his shoulder.

163
00:11:40,744 --> 00:11:43,042
What's the
bleeding street for?!

164
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:46,480
"For turds like you!"
I retorted.

165
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:49,883
"Bleeding dogs!" he screamed.
"Assholes!" I replied.

166
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,978
There was no more
to be said.

167
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,648
I had had the last word.

168
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,681
 

169
00:11:55,725 --> 00:12:00,788
Nevertheless, I am able to see
other people's points of view.

170
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,491
I know a few things

171
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:05,797
upon which it is a positive
pleasure to tread.

172
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:07,803
Whenever I take Tulip out,
therefore,

173
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,670
I offer her
the opportunity to drop twigs

174
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:12,675
where there are trees.

175
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:16,577
Here, amid the flotsam
and jetsam of french letters

176
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:20,014
and the swollen bodies
of drowned cats, dogs, and birds

177
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,607
left by the tide,

178
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:25,280
she is often moved
to open her bowels.

179
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:32,191
If not, we pass on to another
species of refuse dump.

180
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:35,789
The dead are less particular
and more charitable

181
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:37,231
than the living.

182
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,201
It is a charming
little cemetery.

183
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,429
 

184
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,304
To what better use
could such a place be put?

185
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,331
And are not its ghosts gladdened

186
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:49,243
that so beautiful
a young creature as Tulip

187
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,941
should come here for her needs,

188
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,642
whatever they may be?

189
00:12:53,683 --> 00:12:55,981
 

190
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:59,750
Tulip sometimes
embarrasses me, too.

191
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:01,381
She delivered herself once

192
00:13:01,424 --> 00:13:03,858
in front
of a greengrocer's shop...

193
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:07,294
and this on the way home from
a long walk on putney common,

194
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,763
where she had already left

195
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:11,562
as much as I supposed her
to contain.

196
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,569
I knew the grocer and his wife

197
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:16,538
were a surly,
disobliging couple.

198
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:18,768
Hoping that they would not
observe Tulip,

199
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:22,574
I hastened by, hissing at her
to"hurry up for god's sake!"

200
00:13:22,612 --> 00:13:23,738
As I passed.

201
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,042
I glanced back,

202
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:27,811
intending to disown her
if she had been observed.

203
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:30,820
Tulip had just finished
and was following me.

204
00:13:30,854 --> 00:13:32,287
But at that very instant,

205
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:36,315
the man and his wife flew
angrily out and caught my eye.

206
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,725
Useless now
to pretend ignorance.

207
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,661
Yet I continued on my way.

208
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:42,688
They hurled insults after me.

209
00:13:42,732 --> 00:13:44,461
Woman: Here! Mister!

210
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:47,766
Look what your bleeding dog's
gone and done!

211
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,204
Then my conscience smote me.

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,504
True, they were horrid people,

213
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:55,739
but Tulip's gift would not help
to uplift their hearts

214
00:13:55,778 --> 00:13:57,712
to a sweeter view of life.

215
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:00,045
As soon as this noble thought
occurred to me,

216
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,176
I retraced my steps.

217
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,676
"I'm sorry about my dog,"
I said.

218
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,690
"But if you give me
some newspaper

219
00:14:07,724 --> 00:14:10,022
"or a bucket of water
and a brush,

220
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,755
I'll clear it up for you."

221
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,838
It took me some time
to swab it up,

222
00:14:26,876 --> 00:14:29,140
but I was thorough.

223
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,237
 

224
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,775
 

225
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,183
 

226
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:51,363
"Well   that's done,"
I said cheerfully.

227
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:56,338
It was now her turn
to pretend not to catch my eye.

228
00:14:56,372 --> 00:15:00,502
"You could say 'thank you,"'
I added mildly.

229
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:02,534
 
Why should i?!

230
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,310
She retorted, with a brief,
contemptuous look.

231
00:15:06,349 --> 00:15:08,613
Standing there
with my hands full,

232
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:12,712
I had an impulse to drop it all
back on the pavement.

233
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,414
Women are dangerous,

234
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:18,018
and I feared now
that Tulip's death cries

235
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:19,323
as she went under a bus

236
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:21,694
while dodging
some vegetable missile

237
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:23,824
would sound like music
to this one.

238
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:25,857
 

239
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:28,598
I restrained myself.

240
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,473
For as long as I could remember,

241
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:38,537
I had been searching
for an ideal friend.

242
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:39,980
But I have never really found

243
00:15:40,016 --> 00:15:43,816
the person who fitted
my exacting requirements.

244
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:45,684
There was always some flaw...

245
00:15:45,722 --> 00:15:48,350
too tall, too short...

246
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,655
too outgoing, too shy...

247
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:54,789
too insecure, too independent.

248
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:56,196
As the years passed

249
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:58,632
and the opportunities
grew fewer,

250
00:15:58,668 --> 00:16:02,934
I had a mental image of the
ideal friend as a plain jug,

251
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,599
containing a delightful mlx

252
00:16:04,641 --> 00:16:08,202
of good companionship
and intellectual stimulation,

253
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,576
the shape, age, and size
of which

254
00:16:10,613 --> 00:16:14,845
no longer
had any importance for me.

255
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:16,181
I still felt

256
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,687
that if I only turned
this corner instead of that

257
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:21,519
or boarded this bus
rather than that one,

258
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:24,492
I would find the ideal friend
waiting for me

259
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,291
and that we would recognize
each other at once

260
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,697
after the exchange
of a few words.

261
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:34,726
Ah, and a further complication
was that I did not want anyone

262
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,966
to think
that I was pursuing them.

263
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:38,473
It was therefore necessary

264
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:42,376
to encounter the ideal friend
face-to-face,

265
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:43,743
which is not easy

266
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,046
if you happen both to be moving
in the same direction.

267
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:54,048
It was with a measure
of naiveté in dog affairs

268
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,888
that my first consultation
with a vet

269
00:16:56,926 --> 00:17:00,020
was to inquire
whether she was in heat.

270
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:01,587
 

271
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,862
The question was never settled,
that is to say by him.

272
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,631
All he said
in a cold voice was...

273
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,638
have you no control
over your dog?

274
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,367
In the face of the evidence,

275
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:13,967
it was idle
to say anything but"no,"

276
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,944
to which,
still keeping his distance,

277
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,878
he dryly replied...

278
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:21,372
then take her out
of my surgery at once.

279
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:27,352
Another vet
had been recommended to me.

280
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,984
He was an ex-army man, a major.

281
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,152
 
Tulip!

282
00:17:31,194 --> 00:17:32,821
Just have to
take them like...

283
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:35,558
having failed as I had failed
to shout her down,

284
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:39,034
the major swooped upon her,
yelping...

285
00:17:39,068 --> 00:17:41,263
these Alsatians,
they're all the same!
 

286
00:17:41,304 --> 00:17:45,604
...and beat her about the body
with his bare hands.

287
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:48,576
These dashing military tactics

288
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:50,875
did not enable him
to examine her,

289
00:17:50,913 --> 00:17:53,780
if that was part of his plan.

290
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:56,444
As I walked away
from this establishment,

291
00:17:56,486 --> 00:18:00,946
I supposed myself to be in the
position of an undoctorable dog.

292
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,719
And this gloomy reflection

293
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:05,523
was succeeded by another,
which was...

294
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:07,961
"if all Alsatians are the same,

295
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:11,694
did any of them ever
receive medical attention?"

296
00:18:11,734 --> 00:18:13,895
It transpired that they did,

297
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:16,461
this time
for a most important service...

298
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:19,236
to have her inoculated
against distemper.

299
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:20,708
 

300
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:24,342
I had made the appointment
by telephone

301
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,680
and had thought it politic to
apologize for Tulip in advance.

302
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:31,414
 

303
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,353
 

304
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,421
The first sight that greeted us

305
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:40,952
before we ever reached
the surgery door...

306
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:42,294
for its window looked out

307
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:44,561
upon the yard
through which we passed...

308
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,434
was a spaniel,
all too plainly seen within,

309
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:52,908
absolutely motionless and
with an air of deep absorption.

310
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:56,207
The dog was standing
upon the table in an empty room

311
00:18:56,245 --> 00:19:00,773
with a thermometer sticking out
of its bottom, like a cigarette.

312
00:19:00,817 --> 00:19:04,344
It was almost as though
he'd put it there himself.

313
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:06,753
Oh, Tulip.

314
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:09,656
If only you
were like that.

315
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:11,023
But she was not.

316
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,618
 

317
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:17,957
Can you turn her back to me
and hold her head still?

318
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,797
I think so.
Good.

319
00:19:19,836 --> 00:19:20,962
Now just keep her head
like that.

320
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:24,234
Uh, may I give her
the injection myself?

321
00:19:24,273 --> 00:19:26,764
You could show me where
to do it, and she wouldn't
mind it from me.

322
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,333
Oh, I say, don't hurt her.

323
00:19:28,377 --> 00:19:29,935
There's really no need.

324
00:19:29,979 --> 00:19:31,970
 

325
00:19:33,349 --> 00:19:37,342
After this,
Tulip would not, could not

326
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,013
even enter the streets

327
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:44,220
in which her last two
experiences had taken place.

328
00:19:45,995 --> 00:19:48,225
I would suddenly miss her
from my side

329
00:19:48,264 --> 00:19:52,394
and, looking wildly around,
espy her far behind me.

330
00:19:52,435 --> 00:19:55,529
There was no getting away
from her face.

331
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,268
It said both,"what?"
And,"what?!"

332
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:02,471
I then noticed that in spite of
the nourishing food I provided,

333
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,911
Tulip looked too thin.

334
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:06,938
The distressing word"worms"

335
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:10,578
was dropped into my ear
by a passing stranger,

336
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,180
and soon after,
I decided to take her along

337
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:16,521
to miss, um, uh, Canvenini
or something like that,

338
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:20,995
which was the name of the lady
vet that she kindly gave me.

339
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:29,194
Miss, uh, Canvenini
stood quietly in front of us,

340
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:32,435
looking down at Tulip while
I stumbled through some account

341
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,670
of her past and present
troubles.

342
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,337
Then she asked...

343
00:20:36,379 --> 00:20:38,040
what's her name?
 

344
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,741
I told her.

345
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:43,878
Well, Tulip,
you're a noisy girl, aren't you?

346
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,354
What is it all about?

347
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:49,358
Oh, how maddening,
how intolerable it was!

348
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:52,987
I found myself
suddenly yelling...

349
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:55,759
stop it, you brute!

350
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,129
 

351
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:58,428
I biffed her nose.

352
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,434
 

353
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:01,333
The blow was harder
than I intended.

354
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:04,796
I see.

355
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,398
Just slip the lead
through her collar.

356
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,501
I'll examine her
in another room.

357
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:10,307
A-are you sure
it'll be all right?

358
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:12,371
Perfectly all right.

359
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,027
 

360
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,629
 

361
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:38,868
 

362
00:21:54,156 --> 00:21:56,090
 

363
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,559
No signs of worms.

364
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:01,062
She is in excellent
condition.

365
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:02,724
Uh...
how did she behave?

366
00:22:02,765 --> 00:22:04,357
Good as gold.

367
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,493
Did you tie her nose?

368
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:07,695
Heavens, no!

369
00:22:07,737 --> 00:22:11,332
I never do that.
I knew she would be no trouble.

370
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:12,534
How?

371
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:15,339
Well, you learn by experience,
I suppose.

372
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:17,903
But it isn't difficult
to tell a dog's character

373
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,278
from its face.

374
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,216
Tulip's a good girl.
I saw that at once.

375
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,515
You are the trouble.

376
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,214
I sat down.

377
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:27,722
She is in love with you,

378
00:22:27,757 --> 00:22:30,248
so life is full of worries
for her.

379
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,817
In order to protect you,
she wants to be free.

380
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:33,886
Mm.

381
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:36,227
So she doesn't like
people touching her.

382
00:22:36,265 --> 00:22:37,562
But when you're not there,

383
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,295
there is nothing
for her to do.

384
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:41,860
Speak to her quietly.
Mm.

385
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:45,533
In time,
she'll do anything for you.

386
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,508
 

387
00:22:47,543 --> 00:22:50,068
 
Excuse me. Has, uh...

388
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:54,446
has she...
uh, um, um, miss canveninl...

389
00:22:54,483 --> 00:22:57,179
has she ever been bitten?

390
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:59,744
Sublime woman.

391
00:23:04,927 --> 00:23:09,660
My sister, Nancy,
who had no flxed abode,

392
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:12,360
became aware that I had been
looking in vain

393
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:16,599
for someone to become
Tulip's escort and caretaker,

394
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,437
as my office responsibilities
on most mornings

395
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:21,102
required me to abandon her

396
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:25,239
to long periods
of loneliness and boredom.

397
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:29,012
From the outset,
Tulip made it very clear

398
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:33,511
that she, not Nancy,
was mistress of the house

399
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:35,956
and had every intention
of maintaining this position.

400
00:23:35,991 --> 00:23:37,356
 

401
00:23:37,393 --> 00:23:41,022
I had naturally been worried
that Nancy, once installed,

402
00:23:41,063 --> 00:23:44,999
would attempt to invade
what remained of my privacy,

403
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:47,969
but Tulip defended our territory
rather well.

404
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,994
 

405
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,803
The room Tulip and I occupied

406
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:58,541
was to remain
strictly out of bounds,

407
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:01,812
and any attempt by Nancy
even to approach it,

408
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:04,649
let alone knock at the door
or enter,

409
00:24:04,687 --> 00:24:08,487
was greeted by a prolonged
outburst of ferocious barking.

410
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:11,118
 

411
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,692
 

412
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,597
 

413
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:20,499
 

414
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:38,044
 

415
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,723
No more was needed.

416
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:50,561
Nancy would not advance
another step,

417
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,932
but would call out to ask
some pointless question.

418
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:57,962
Nancy: Joe, shall I put
the kettle on?

419
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,271
  Joe?
 

420
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:01,833
Are you in there?

421
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,242
 

422
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,611
I thought I might
go up to the west end

423
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:06,876
to look at the shops,

424
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:10,977
but if it's going to rain,
then I don't suppose I will.

425
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,147
Joe?

426
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:14,588
Days passed,

427
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:18,389
and my sister's mind got busy,
as I guessed it would,

428
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:22,591
with the problem
of obstructing my wishes.

429
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,929
 

430
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:54,495
You know,
she's a quite different dog

431
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,827
when you're not here.

432
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:58,799
She's quiet, she's obedient,
she does everything I tell her.

433
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,802
And there's none
of that terrible fuss

434
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:03,964
about me going
into your room...

435
00:26:04,006 --> 00:26:06,440
when you're not in there.

436
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:09,706
I should, of course, say
how grateful I was to Nancy,

437
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:11,110
in spite of everything.

438
00:26:11,146 --> 00:26:14,274
I could not imagine anyone
filling this role better.

439
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:17,683
But that role was not quite
the one Nancy had envisaged

440
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,381
when she came to live with us.

441
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,548
She saw herself
as a member of the household.

442
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,023
Nancy:
  Joe?

443
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:26,050
I saw her
as a dependable kennel maid.

444
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,154
 

445
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,595
While I was at the office,

446
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:40,200
Nancy attempted to seduce Tulip
away from me,

447
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:43,109
and I thought,
at one awful moment,

448
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:46,137
that she had almost succeeded.

449
00:26:48,784 --> 00:26:53,084
I awoke in a panic to find
that Tulip was not asleep

450
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:55,682
in her usual chair in our room,

451
00:26:55,724 --> 00:26:57,749
and the dreadful thought
struck me

452
00:26:57,793 --> 00:27:00,887
that she had decided
to spend the night with Nancy.

453
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:03,124
The idea that
she could have rejected me

454
00:27:03,165 --> 00:27:04,723
in favor of my sister

455
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:07,361
was almost too much to bear,

456
00:27:07,403 --> 00:27:09,337
and I sank back into my pillow,

457
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:12,465
thinking that our life
of companionship was over

458
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:14,476
and that I was once more alone
in the world.

459
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,503
And then I heard
a faint, familiar noise...

460
00:27:18,547 --> 00:27:20,572
the soft, melancholy noise

461
00:27:20,616 --> 00:27:23,210
that Tulip makes
when she's unhappy.

462
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:25,220
 

463
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:33,094
 

464
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:42,162
 

465
00:27:44,139 --> 00:27:46,835
She had been lured
into my sister's room

466
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,503
and kept there against her will,

467
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:52,912
and she immediately followed me
back to my own room.

468
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:59,145
She remained
what she always was...

469
00:27:59,188 --> 00:28:01,247
my dog.

470
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,690
I should never have doubted her.

471
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:06,718
But now that I had been
proved wrong,

472
00:28:06,762 --> 00:28:12,428
I was able to fall contentedly
into a deep and restful sleep.

473
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,463
 

474
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:34,381
I was not to have any rest
from Nancy, however.

475
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:37,790
Having failed
to win Tulip over to her side,

476
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:40,818
she was prepared to carry on
this battle to the end,

477
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:42,956
however gory that might be.

478
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:45,296
 
 

479
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:50,664
 
Nancy had, of course,
relied upon my inability

480
00:28:50,706 --> 00:28:55,075
to stand by and watch her being
savaged without intervening.

481
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,136
She must therefore have taken
a quiet satisfaction

482
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,648
in seeing me beat off my dog,

483
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:04,846
even though every blow
fell unwillingly.

484
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:06,946
 

485
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,623
 

486
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:16,387
Tulip! Down!

487
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:18,297
 
Stop this nonsense, Tulip!

488
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,561
Tulip!

489
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,262
 
 

490
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,793
Down! Stay, Tulip!

491
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:24,669
 

492
00:29:29,978 --> 00:29:32,412
I hardly remember for how long

493
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:36,612
these two formidable females
tussled for my custody.

494
00:29:36,652 --> 00:29:40,110
It was certainly
more than a year.

495
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:41,383
And it was rather...

496
00:29:41,423 --> 00:29:43,118
 

497
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:44,716
...distracting.

498
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,694
 

499
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,127
Alas, very few of my friends

500
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,034
ask me to stay with them
anymore.

501
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:58,539
 

502
00:29:58,574 --> 00:30:00,337
Those who have no pets
of their own

503
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,970
are a little forgetful
about inviting Tulip...

504
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:05,604
twice.

505
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:08,138
People seem to take exception
to being assaulted

506
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:12,483
whenever they cross their legs
in their own sitting rooms.

507
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:18,518
One of the last hosts to invite
us down to his country home

508
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,551
was a captain pugh,

509
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:24,760
who had served with me in france
in the 1914 war.

510
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,862
I had seen nothing of him
for a great many years,

511
00:30:30,906 --> 00:30:32,874
and then he suddenly
turned up again.

512
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:35,741
He said he was farming in kent

513
00:30:35,777 --> 00:30:40,510
and gave me orders
to come down and stay.

514
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:43,848
He agreeably added Tulip
to the invitation,

515
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:48,721
and so we traveled down into
kent together that very month.

516
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,688
Actually, I remembered
very little about my host,

517
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:54,753
except that he had been
an officer

518
00:30:54,796 --> 00:30:58,892
who had managed to combine
great courage and efficiency

519
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:03,132
with a marked habit
of indolence.

520
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:05,162
Uh, whenever, for instance,

521
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:07,004
he had wanted
his servant or his orderly,

522
00:31:07,042 --> 00:31:09,670
it had been his custom
to fire his revolver

523
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:12,111
one shot for the servant,
two for the orderly

524
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:14,672
to save himself
the exertion of shouting.

525
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:17,844
 
Strange fellow, what.

526
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:32,099
 

527
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,873
An odd figure...

528
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:44,106
and, as I was to discover,
set in his ways.

529
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:47,638
His whims were, indeed, to
contribute to the misfortunes

530
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:50,516
that befell us beneath his roof.

531
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,695
 

532
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:27,918
 

533
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:32,084
 

534
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,087
 

535
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,633
Pugh: Now, I hope
Tulip won't go after them.

536
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,605
They're laying rather well
at present.

537
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,608
I hoped not, too.

538
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:49,543
He may have been hinting that
I should put Tulip on a lead,

539
00:32:49,578 --> 00:32:52,274
but how can one gauge
the intelligence of one's animal

540
00:32:52,314 --> 00:32:55,408
if one never affords it
the chance to display any?

541
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,044
 

542
00:32:58,086 --> 00:32:59,883
Tulip!

543
00:32:59,921 --> 00:33:01,650
I was too late.

544
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,056
 

545
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,394
 
 

546
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,284
I apologized profusely,

547
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,688
but it turned out to be
not at all an important cat.

548
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,992
 

549
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:41,518
It can stay there now.

550
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:45,863
I'll have someone let it out
before night falls.

551
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:49,234
I permitted myself to be...
  yes.

552
00:33:49,271 --> 00:33:52,968
I permitted myself
to be amused.

553
00:33:53,008 --> 00:33:55,067
Little did I think

554
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,570
that this cat was to take
his revenge upon us later.

555
00:34:03,018 --> 00:34:08,081
Captain pugh's idleness
had only gained ground.

556
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:10,387
 

557
00:34:31,113 --> 00:34:33,138
The problem
that troubled him the most

558
00:34:33,181 --> 00:34:34,580
appeared to be whether,

559
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,881
for an hour or more both
before and after every meal,

560
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:40,979
it would be more rewarding
to nap on a sofa

561
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:44,423
or to undress and return to bed.

562
00:34:47,863 --> 00:34:50,024
 

563
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,363
Every room, including
the bathroom and kitchen,

564
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:58,236
were furnished with a sofa.

565
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,178
In those rare moments
he was on his feet...
attention!

566
00:35:07,215 --> 00:35:09,843
...pugh would stalk
about his farm building

567
00:35:09,885 --> 00:35:12,149
shouting commands
in military fashion,

568
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:15,418
and causing great consternation
among the cows.

569
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:17,550
All right, now!
Quick! March!

570
00:35:17,592 --> 00:35:18,820
 

571
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,828
Come along, then!
Come along, there!

572
00:35:20,862 --> 00:35:22,329
Step lively!

573
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:24,093
Come on, then!

574
00:35:25,467 --> 00:35:27,697
All right, you cows!

575
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:30,364
Stand at ease!

576
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:34,273
He then retired for the night
up the wide wooden staircase

577
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:38,405
with its low treads
to reduce leg strain.

578
00:35:39,581 --> 00:35:42,049
Pugh paused to observe
that he was a light sleeper

579
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,951
and therefore hoped
that Tulip was a sound one.

580
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:50,287
So as to wake up
like a giant refreshed.

581
00:35:50,325 --> 00:35:53,624
I had been allotted
the bedroom joining his.

582
00:35:53,662 --> 00:35:55,721
And besides the bed
it contained,

583
00:35:55,764 --> 00:35:58,198
I was glad,
though not surprised,

584
00:35:58,233 --> 00:36:02,329
to find a comfortable sofa...

585
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,271
for Tulip.

586
00:36:05,307 --> 00:36:08,276
In fact,
Tulip is a very quiet sleeper,

587
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,245
although she will usually
pay me one visit in the night

588
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:13,509
and put her nose
against my face.

589
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:17,507
Perhaps I cry out in my dreams,
or do not,

590
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:22,012
a-and she wishes to reassure
herself that I am not dead.

591
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,321
 

592
00:36:25,794 --> 00:36:27,785
 

593
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:33,558
 

594
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,500
It was therefore
well-precedented

595
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:40,565
when she wakened me
at about 2:00 a.m.

596
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:42,474
I petted her and turned away.

597
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,978
She pulled at me
in an urgent kind of way.

598
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:47,174
What could she want?

599
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:51,410
 

600
00:36:51,453 --> 00:36:53,580
Ah! So that was it.

601
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:57,080
She left me then,
but she did not go to her sofa.

602
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,922
Don't be tiresome, Tulip!

603
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,427
Go back to bed!

604
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,089
We'll visit the cat
in the morning.

605
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,223
 

606
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:06,496
Silence.

607
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:08,558
Then I heard...

608
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,002
 
...plop...

609
00:37:10,038 --> 00:37:11,266
 
...plop...

610
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:12,933
 
...plop.

611
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:15,875
 

612
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:17,902
I fumbled for my matches.

613
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:20,847
Tulip was coming to me
from the other side of the room,

614
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:25,182
wagging her tail and gazing
at me with soft, glowing eyes

615
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,313
as she kissed my cheek.

616
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,152
Avoiding all the rugs,

617
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,250
she had laid her mess
on the linoleum

618
00:37:32,294 --> 00:37:35,161
and as far from me
as she could get,

619
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:37,289
against pugh's
communicating door.

620
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:40,995
And, indeed,
she couldn't have helped it.

621
00:37:41,036 --> 00:37:44,699
I saw at once,
when I got out of bed to look,

622
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:49,199
she couldn't have retained that
for a moment longer.

623
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:53,409
 

624
00:38:07,128 --> 00:38:08,459
Pugh:  

625
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:11,431
 

626
00:38:11,466 --> 00:38:13,696
 

627
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,528
 

628
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:20,439
 

629
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:22,409
 

630
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,447
 

631
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,179
 

632
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:41,793
 
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Tulip!

633
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,695
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

634
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:45,791
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Shh! Shh!

635
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,392
 

636
00:38:47,435 --> 00:38:49,335
 

637
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,703
She had used every device
that lay in her power

638
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,708
to tell me something,

639
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,903
and I had not understood.

640
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:59,107
Alas, for the gulf
that separates man and beast.

641
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:03,083
Did she lose some confidence
in me at that moment?

642
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,018
I have often sadly wondered.

643
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:06,850
 

644
00:39:06,888 --> 00:39:08,480
Poor pugh.  

645
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:11,720
It was not, I fear, with
the look of a giant refreshed

646
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,228
that he appeared
at the breakfast table later.

647
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:17,754
He said kindly
that it was of no consequence.

648
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:20,233
But it was.
 

649
00:39:20,268 --> 00:39:22,202
The norton was waiting
in the yard,

650
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:25,502
its engine
snickering impatiently.

651
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,907
Tulip was never asked again.
 

652
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:32,973
 

653
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:50,993
But here the story
finds a happy ending.

654
00:39:51,032 --> 00:39:54,798
If I did forfeit any of Tulip's
confidence at that period,

655
00:39:54,836 --> 00:39:57,964
I have reason to believe
that I had recovered it later,

656
00:39:58,006 --> 00:40:00,702
as we shall soon see.

657
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:03,944
Dogs read the world
through their noses

658
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:06,469
and write their history
in urine.

659
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:08,982
Tulip is particularly
instructive

660
00:40:09,017 --> 00:40:10,484
when she is in season.

661
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:13,578
She has two kinds
of, uh, urination...

662
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:16,021
a necessity and a social.

663
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:20,016
In necessity,
she squats squarely and abruptly

664
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:21,995
right down on her shins,

665
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,726
her hind legs
forming a kind of dam

666
00:40:24,766 --> 00:40:27,496
against the stream
that gushes out from behind.

667
00:40:27,535 --> 00:40:30,629
Her expression is complacent.

668
00:40:30,672 --> 00:40:33,163
For social urination,
she seldom squats,

669
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:35,733
but balances herself
on one hind leg,

670
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:38,473
the other being cocked up
in the air.

671
00:40:38,513 --> 00:40:40,504
A single drop will do.

672
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:42,607
The expression on her face
is businesslike,

673
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,983
as though
she were signing a check.

674
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,547
She attends socially
to a wide range of objects,

675
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:53,083
the commonest group being
the droppings of other animals.

676
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,995
Fresh horse dung having
a special attraction for her

677
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:02,025
and is always liberally sprayed.

678
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:07,465
Then she sprinkles any food
that has been thrown out...

679
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,704
buns, bones...

680
00:41:09,744 --> 00:41:13,236
fish, bread...

681
00:41:13,281 --> 00:41:15,078
vomit...

682
00:41:15,116 --> 00:41:18,643
unless it is food
she wishes to eat.

683
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:23,146
Dead and decaying animals
are carefully attended to.

684
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:25,182
 

685
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:46,771
There came a day
when she suddenly added my urine

686
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:51,649
to the other privileged objects
of her social attention.

687
00:41:53,154 --> 00:41:55,679
How touched I was.

688
00:41:55,723 --> 00:41:58,590
How honored I felt.

689
00:41:58,626 --> 00:42:00,821
"Oh, Tulip.

690
00:42:00,862 --> 00:42:03,854
Thank you," I said.

691
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:07,629
And now she always does it.

692
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:11,867
So I feel that if ever there
were differences between us...

693
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:14,841
 
...they're washed out now.

694
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,844
I feel a proper dog.

695
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:26,815
Soon after Tulip
came into my possession,

696
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:29,880
I set about finding
a husband for her.

697
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:32,722
She had had a lonely
and frustrated life hitherto.

698
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,421
Now she should have a full one.

699
00:42:34,462 --> 00:42:37,090
A full life naturally included

700
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:40,828
the pleasures of sex
and maternity.

701
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:42,426
And although I could not,

702
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:46,668
of course, accommodate her
little puppies in my small flat,

703
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:51,202
that was a matter to which
I would give my attention later.

704
00:42:54,082 --> 00:42:56,050
Miss, uh, Canvenini,

705
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:59,110
provided me with the address
of a Mr. Blandish,

706
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:03,715
who lived in sheen and owned
a good Alsatian named max

707
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:06,693
whom he was willing to lend.

708
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:09,891
 

709
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,596
 

710
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:17,002
 

711
00:43:17,038 --> 00:43:20,007
Max was then revealed
as a heavy, handsome dog

712
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:23,943
with the grave deportment
of the old family retainer.

713
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:26,469
When I was invited
into the sitting room...

714
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:28,505
show the gentleman in,
max.

715
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:31,541
...he kept me
under close surveillance.

716
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:40,121
The house and its management
clearly belonged to him.

717
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:43,289
To have offered him any kind
of familiarity, it was plain,

718
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:46,061
would have been as shocking
a breach of etiquette

719
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,036
as if one had attempted
to stroke the butler.

720
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,971
Matches.

721
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:05,782
Matches. Are there no matches
in the house?

722
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,722
Oh, well, never mind.
L-i think I've got some.

723
00:44:16,597 --> 00:44:19,498
Thank you, max.
 

724
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:25,100
Uh, then, will this be
his first experience

725
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:26,936
of, um, uh  

726
00:44:26,974 --> 00:44:29,169
With the opposite sex?

727
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,077
I've been told there might be
some difficulties

728
00:44:32,113 --> 00:44:33,978
unless, uh...

729
00:44:39,387 --> 00:44:42,151
oh, you needn't
worry about that.

730
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,750
Max knows his oats,
all right.

731
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:46,487
Oh, he's been
married before, then?

732
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:49,087
He's never been churched,
it's true.

733
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,360
But when we were down in the
country a couple years ago,

734
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:54,800
he happened upon a stray bitch
in heat...

735
00:44:54,836 --> 00:44:57,600
not at all a classy one,
either...

736
00:44:57,638 --> 00:45:01,096
and had his wicked way with her
on the spot.

737
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:04,305
He'll be delighted to repeat
the performance with Tulip,

738
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:06,609
I can assure you.

739
00:45:13,187 --> 00:45:15,519
Oh, then, well, well,
it was only that...

740
00:45:15,556 --> 00:45:18,992
leave it all to me.

741
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,790
I've got a very reliable
little book,

742
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:24,423
not that max will need
to look up anything in it.

743
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:26,490
 

744
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:31,527
It's all right, max.

745
00:45:31,572 --> 00:45:34,370
The gentleman
has permission.

746
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:37,139
In case
you took the wrong hat.

747
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:40,079
 

748
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:44,847
A formal introduction
was effected a few days later.

749
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:47,047
The sound
of max's throaty rumble

750
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:48,783
as we advanced up the driveway

751
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:50,757
announced that he was on duty.

752
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,350
And the opening door

753
00:45:52,393 --> 00:45:56,352
disclosed him planted squarely
on the threshold as before.

754
00:45:56,397 --> 00:46:00,595
But no sooner had max approached
Tulip in the most affable manner

755
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:03,001
than she rounded
vigorously upon him

756
00:46:03,037 --> 00:46:06,165
and drove him down the passage
into the pantry.

757
00:46:06,207 --> 00:46:08,835
 

758
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:11,674
 

759
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:15,113
The blandishes took no offense.

760
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:19,585
Mr. Blandish.

761
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,521
"I see she is..."

762
00:46:22,557 --> 00:46:24,354
quite the sweet
and proper little bitch.

763
00:46:24,392 --> 00:46:26,792
 

764
00:46:26,828 --> 00:46:29,854
I can see them get along
famously together

765
00:46:29,897 --> 00:46:33,526
when her time comes.

766
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:37,470
Uh, more chuckles and winks
at Mrs."B."

767
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:38,938
I could not help wondering

768
00:46:38,973 --> 00:46:42,841
from what source of knowledge
such optimism derived.

769
00:46:42,877 --> 00:46:45,141
 

770
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:43,435
That should be between
her seventh and ninth day.

771
00:47:43,471 --> 00:47:47,168
...his index finger
knowingly pointing to heaven.

772
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:50,644
The nuptials shall take place
in the back garden.

773
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:53,078
...uh, pointing at my tie.

774
00:47:53,114 --> 00:47:56,140
"Well, uh, my own information
says a later day,"

775
00:47:56,183 --> 00:47:58,014
I ventured to remark,

776
00:47:58,052 --> 00:48:00,919
"and that the second week
might be better."

777
00:48:00,955 --> 00:48:04,254
But he firmly replied
that I was mistaken

778
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:07,022
and I could safely leave matters
to his judgment.

779
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:10,326
I then suggested that they
might be exercised together

780
00:48:10,364 --> 00:48:12,059
between now and then.

781
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:14,124
 
What a good idea!

782
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:15,499
...cried Mrs. Blandish.

783
00:48:15,536 --> 00:48:19,302
But her husband was instantly
and flatly opposed.

784
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,036
It was Mrs. Blandish
who took max for walks

785
00:48:22,076 --> 00:48:23,941
while he himself was at work.

786
00:48:23,978 --> 00:48:26,640
And he would not permit her to
have any part in this business,

787
00:48:26,681 --> 00:48:28,945
at any rate, in his absence.

788
00:48:28,983 --> 00:48:32,441
When we left, max was again
withdrawn from hiding,

789
00:48:32,486 --> 00:48:34,681
to say goodbye to Tulip.

790
00:48:34,722 --> 00:48:36,246
 

791
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:38,815
His other wife
bit him in the shoulder,

792
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:41,487
but he won't at all mind
a few more bites

793
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:43,554
when his time
with Tulip comes.

794
00:48:43,598 --> 00:48:45,566
  eh?

795
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,091
He said this with such gusto

796
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:51,468
that I glanced again,
involuntary, at Mrs. Blandish,

797
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:54,770
who was smiling roguishly at him

798
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:57,801
with her small, even teeth.

799
00:48:57,845 --> 00:48:59,904
 

800
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:34,004
Dear Tulip chose to come to heat

801
00:49:34,048 --> 00:49:36,744
in the midst
of the most arctic winter

802
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:40,652
this chilly country had suffered
for 50 years.

803
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:44,954
But it was my first experience
of her in this condition,

804
00:49:44,992 --> 00:49:46,983
and I was enchanted.

805
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:54,427
I was touched by the mysterious
process at work within her

806
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:58,598
and felt very sweet towards her.

807
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,767
That small, dark bud...
her vulva...

808
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:03,800
became swollen
and more noticeable

809
00:50:03,844 --> 00:50:05,641
as she walked ahead of me,

810
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,875
and sometimes
it would set up a tickle

811
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:09,576
or some other sensation,

812
00:50:09,617 --> 00:50:12,643
for she would suddenly
squat down on the road

813
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:15,281
and fall to licking it.

814
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:17,586
 

815
00:50:57,331 --> 00:50:59,458
 

816
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:08,275
Tulip is still bleeding,
I'm afraid.

817
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:10,573
Oh, not to worry.

818
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:12,670
 

819
00:51:12,713 --> 00:51:14,681
Yes.

820
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,410
 

821
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:19,283
Never mind.
 

822
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,515
Everything
will be quite all right

823
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:24,080
after we leave them alone
together in the garden.

824
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,786
 

825
00:51:25,826 --> 00:51:29,455
They'll get down to business
in no time.

826
00:51:29,497 --> 00:51:30,691
 

827
00:51:30,731 --> 00:51:32,528
Yes.
Yes.

828
00:51:32,566 --> 00:51:35,535
Everything will be
quite all right.

829
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:38,037
 

830
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:43,575
 

831
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:45,545
 

832
00:51:45,579 --> 00:51:47,479
 

833
00:51:52,653 --> 00:51:54,848
 

834
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:00,085
The end of this fiasco
will already be apparent.

835
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:03,585
Max was propelled by Tulip
back into the house.

836
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:05,861
And so it was
that this marked the end

837
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,803
of Mr. Blandish's indulgence
and our visit.

838
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:13,534
"You bad girl," I said to Tulip

839
00:52:13,574 --> 00:52:16,236
as we trudged away
through the snow.

840
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:19,303
But she was now,
when she had me back to herself,

841
00:52:19,346 --> 00:52:22,179
in her most disarming mood.

842
00:52:22,216 --> 00:52:24,013
And as soon as we were home,

843
00:52:24,051 --> 00:52:26,713
she attempted
to bestow upon my leg

844
00:52:26,754 --> 00:52:29,985
all the love
that the pusillanimous max

845
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:32,356
had been denied.

846
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:34,761
 

847
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:46,635
Uh, miss Canvenini informed me

848
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:50,075
that mating dogs
was not always a simple matter

849
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,374
and added
the belated information

850
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:54,643
that when they were
inexperienced,

851
00:52:54,682 --> 00:52:57,674
the application of a little
vaseline to the bitch

852
00:52:57,718 --> 00:53:01,119
sometimes helped to excite
and define the interest,

853
00:53:01,155 --> 00:53:03,316
besides acting as a lubricant.

854
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:06,326
She then put me in touch
with a Mr. Plum,

855
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,592
who owned a well-kept Alsatian
off putney hill.

856
00:53:10,631 --> 00:53:14,397
"Now, do be serious,"
I said to Tulip.

857
00:53:14,435 --> 00:53:17,768
I rang Mr. Plum's bell.

858
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:19,102
 

859
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:23,132
He at once emerged
and led us to the garage.

860
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:28,609
"Nice dog," I said.

861
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:30,048
"What's his name?"

862
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:31,449
Uh, chum.

863
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:32,611
...said Mr. Plum.

864
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:34,416
 

865
00:53:37,725 --> 00:53:39,590
Mr. Plum looks at his watch.

866
00:53:39,627 --> 00:53:42,596
 

867
00:53:44,198 --> 00:53:45,859
 

868
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,234
 

869
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:58,869
"Perhaps Tulip would concentrate
better if we left them alone,"

870
00:53:58,913 --> 00:54:01,347
suggested Mr. Plum.

871
00:54:05,486 --> 00:54:07,044
 

872
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:09,055
He looks at his watch again.

873
00:54:09,089 --> 00:54:12,422
Mrs. Plum has a cup of tea
for us in the flat.

874
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,519
...Mr. Plum added,
glancing at his watch.

875
00:54:15,562 --> 00:54:18,793
 

876
00:54:22,703 --> 00:54:25,263
 

877
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:28,306
 

878
00:54:28,342 --> 00:54:30,902
Two cups of tea
were already poured.

879
00:54:30,945 --> 00:54:32,173
I took mine up.

880
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:35,807
It was not tepid.
It was cold!

881
00:54:35,849 --> 00:54:38,682
The striking thing
about Mrs. Plum's kitchen

882
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:40,209
was its cleanliness.

883
00:54:40,254 --> 00:54:43,690
The kitchen was more like
a model ideal-home exhibition

884
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:46,249
than a room actually in use.

885
00:54:46,293 --> 00:54:48,727
Mrs. Plum stood
in its perfect center,

886
00:54:48,762 --> 00:54:53,096
holding in her arms the most
doll-like baby I ever saw.

887
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:56,694
I congratulated Mrs. Plum
on the beauty of her kitchen

888
00:54:56,737 --> 00:54:58,466
and added that it was a marvel

889
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:01,997
to keep a place so clean
when it contained a dog.

890
00:55:02,042 --> 00:55:04,033
And she answered
in her grave voice

891
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:06,273
that chum was not allowed
into the house

892
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:09,714
because dogs make things dirty.

893
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:14,412
Tulip was exactly
where we had left her.

894
00:55:14,455 --> 00:55:16,548
 

895
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,119
I smeared her lavishly
with vaseline

896
00:55:21,161 --> 00:55:22,992
and tried to hold her still

897
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:27,592
while Mr. Plum strove to guide
chum to a more accurate aim.

898
00:55:27,634 --> 00:55:30,000
 

899
00:55:30,037 --> 00:55:33,200
It was all of no use.

900
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,174
I realized
that our efforts to please

901
00:55:35,209 --> 00:55:38,804
had turned into cruelty
and said,"we must stop."

902
00:55:38,846 --> 00:55:42,009
Could it be,
as Mr. Plum suggested,

903
00:55:42,049 --> 00:55:44,040
that she might relax more

904
00:55:44,084 --> 00:55:48,578
if the action was transferred
to my own flat?

905
00:55:50,024 --> 00:55:53,118
Tulip greeted chum
with infantile pleasure

906
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,129
and at once
instituted nursery games,

907
00:55:56,163 --> 00:55:58,290
chasing him
or being chased by him

908
00:55:58,332 --> 00:55:59,526
in and out of my flat,

909
00:55:59,566 --> 00:56:02,933
scattering newspapers
like leaves in the wind.

910
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,632
Chum still found her attractive,

911
00:56:05,672 --> 00:56:09,699
but of sexual interest
on her side, there was no sign.

912
00:56:09,743 --> 00:56:12,678
Later on, we took them out
for a walk together

913
00:56:12,713 --> 00:56:14,943
on putney common.

914
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:17,109
What was Tulip
trying to tell us?

915
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,483
Had I brought her to max
too early

916
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,647
and to chum too late?

917
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:24,657
Was neither dog personally
acceptable to her?

918
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:28,593
Or was her devotion to myself
all the love she needed?

919
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:30,927
 

920
00:56:35,636 --> 00:56:37,297
Mr. Plum:
Here, chum! Good boy!

921
00:56:37,337 --> 00:56:40,272
Come here, boy!
Come here, I say!

922
00:56:40,307 --> 00:56:42,935
Will you do
as you're told?!

923
00:56:42,976 --> 00:56:44,705
Chum!

924
00:56:44,745 --> 00:56:46,872
Oh, I thought chum
was going to be like that.

925
00:56:46,914 --> 00:56:48,814
Well, I don't like
to blame him.

926
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:51,215
We've had some jolly good
hikes together,

927
00:56:51,251 --> 00:56:53,344
but, of course,
when you're married,

928
00:56:53,387 --> 00:56:55,548
you've got other people
to consider,

929
00:56:55,589 --> 00:57:00,492
and it's natural that the wife
should want one's company, too.

930
00:57:00,527 --> 00:57:02,495
But I had left off listening

931
00:57:02,529 --> 00:57:05,327
to Mr. Plum's
sorrowful reflections.

932
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:08,797
Cutting across our path
was a curious figure

933
00:57:08,836 --> 00:57:12,602
who instantly caught
my attention.

934
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,732
 

935
00:57:22,883 --> 00:57:25,010
 

936
00:57:37,731 --> 00:57:41,758
I wouldn't be surprised
if she's a barren bitch.

937
00:57:41,802 --> 00:57:45,829
Too nervous and highly strung
for my liking.

938
00:57:45,873 --> 00:57:48,307
Now, if it hadn't been
a sunday

939
00:57:48,342 --> 00:57:51,869
and me having a young lad
with me and all,

940
00:57:51,912 --> 00:57:53,573
I wouldn't have minded

941
00:57:53,614 --> 00:57:56,913
unleashing one of me own
dogs on her here and now.

942
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,784
They'd soon find out
if she's a barren bitch or not.

943
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:03,722
Uh, t-there aren't
m-many people about.

944
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:06,248
Can't we go over
into those bushes?

945
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:08,693
N-no one
would see us there.

946
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:10,959
I'd have been pleased
to try,

947
00:58:10,998 --> 00:58:14,229
but I couldn't
in front of the young lad.

948
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:16,736
Did you give her a lead
at all?

949
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:20,035
You know,
prompt her, like?

950
00:58:20,073 --> 00:58:22,837
There's ways
of stimulating them up.

951
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:24,571
Uh, vaseline?

952
00:58:24,611 --> 00:58:27,273
Ah. You knew about that.

953
00:58:27,314 --> 00:58:29,714
I wouldn't have minded
demonstrating it

954
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,082
on one of me own dogs,

955
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:36,215
if it hadn't been for
the presence of the young lad.

956
00:58:36,256 --> 00:58:37,780
I had by now conceived

957
00:58:37,824 --> 00:58:40,622
so intense a dislike
for this sickly faced youth,

958
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:43,152
who looked as though there was
little he did not already know

959
00:58:43,197 --> 00:58:45,324
about the art
of self-stimulation,

960
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:48,266
that I could hardly keep
the venom out of my gaze

961
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:49,667
and asked irritably

962
00:58:49,703 --> 00:58:54,197
whether he could not be sent
for a walk by himself.

963
00:58:55,342 --> 00:58:58,675
The desire to instruct
is a powerful one,

964
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:01,613
and our lecturer
could not resist it.

965
00:59:01,648 --> 00:59:04,344
He accordingly sent the boy off
with one of the dogs,

966
00:59:04,384 --> 00:59:06,750
and then,
after a cautious look around,

967
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:08,982
demonstrated
upon the remaining animal

968
00:59:09,022 --> 00:59:13,959
what transpires when one exerts
a slight warming pressure

969
00:59:13,994 --> 00:59:16,588
on its member.

970
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:18,029
What occurred then

971
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:22,365
requires no further
enlarging upon.

972
00:59:22,402 --> 00:59:24,427
And that was the end
of my attempt

973
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:26,939
to marry Tulip that season.

974
00:59:30,611 --> 00:59:32,602
 

975
00:59:37,784 --> 00:59:41,151
I had a lot of trouble
with the local dogs...

976
00:59:41,188 --> 00:59:43,053
far more than I had had
in the winter.

977
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:44,421
It became quite a puzzle

978
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:49,361
to know where to exercise Tulip
when she was in heat.

979
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:52,125
The only fault
I could find with her

980
00:59:52,165 --> 00:59:54,599
was that she was apt to spread
the news of her condition

981
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:58,867
by sprinkling the doorstep
on her way in and out,

982
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:00,998
which naturally brought
all the neighboring dogs along

983
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:02,702
in a trice

984
01:00:02,743 --> 01:00:04,404
to hang hopefully
about the building

985
01:00:04,444 --> 01:00:06,537
for the rest of her season.

986
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,777
Thereafter,
her walks became as harassed

987
01:00:09,816 --> 01:00:11,943
as are the attempts
of film stars

988
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:15,318
to leave the savoy hotel
undetected by reporters.

989
01:00:15,355 --> 01:00:17,323
Stealth, therefore,

990
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:21,384
was an essential preliminary
to success.

991
01:00:21,428 --> 01:00:22,656
 

992
01:00:22,696 --> 01:00:26,894
A single bark would undo us now.

993
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:33,239
 

994
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:37,173
 

995
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:41,705
Dogs would materialize
out of the very air

996
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:43,613
and come racing towards us.

997
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:46,949
Some were so small
that by no stroke of luck

998
01:00:46,987 --> 01:00:50,514
could they possibly achieve
their high ambition.

999
01:00:50,557 --> 01:00:52,320
And some were so old
and arthritic

1000
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:53,883
that they could hardly
hobble along.

1001
01:00:53,927 --> 01:00:56,157
Yet all deserted hearth and home

1002
01:00:56,196 --> 01:00:59,222
and skirmished after us so far

1003
01:00:59,266 --> 01:01:01,393
that I often wondered
whether those who dropped out

1004
01:01:01,435 --> 01:01:03,562
ever managed to return home.

1005
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:04,797
 

1006
01:01:04,838 --> 01:01:06,931
Well, then I lost my temper.

1007
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:09,965
Scram! Shoo! Piss off!

1008
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:14,242
I took to pelting the dauntless
creatures with sticks and clogs,

1009
01:01:14,281 --> 01:01:16,340
but Tulip instantly flew off
to retrieve them

1010
01:01:16,383 --> 01:01:20,547
and returned with sundry dogs
clinging to her bottom.

1011
01:01:20,587 --> 01:01:23,556
With all the intelligence
gone out of her eyes,

1012
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:25,455
she would reach
a point of frenzy,

1013
01:01:25,492 --> 01:01:27,824
tearing my clothes or my flesh
with her teeth.

1014
01:01:32,632 --> 01:01:35,829
Most of our walks, therefore,
ended in bad humor.

1015
01:01:35,869 --> 01:01:37,928
And I was thankful to get home

1016
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:40,906
safely out of reach
of our oppressors,

1017
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:44,638
who, being unable to rise above
themselves in any other way,

1018
01:01:44,678 --> 01:01:47,238
remained where they were.

1019
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:51,240
There was one mongrel
in my district

1020
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:55,584
to whom Tulip was so devoted
that it was quite a romance.

1021
01:01:55,622 --> 01:01:58,853
He was a very small
and rather wooden terrier

1022
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:00,416
with a mean, little face.

1023
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,291
And I had only to
pronounce his name...

1024
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:04,160
which was watney...

1025
01:02:04,197 --> 01:02:07,098
for her to prick up her ears
and lead me excitedly

1026
01:02:07,134 --> 01:02:10,433
to the public house
in which he lived.

1027
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,166
The publican
would let the little dog out,

1028
01:02:13,206 --> 01:02:14,901
and Tulip would greet him

1029
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:18,342
with all her prettiest
demonstrations of pleasure.

1030
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:21,905
Every now and then, she would
place a paw on his back,

1031
01:02:21,948 --> 01:02:25,782
as though to hold him still
for contemplation.

1032
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:29,016
What she saw or smelt
in this dreary, little dog

1033
01:02:29,055 --> 01:02:32,115
I never could understand.

1034
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:35,890
 

1035
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:39,865
During her heats, he practically
lived on our doorsteps

1036
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,595
and, when she appeared,

1037
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:44,297
clung like a barnacle
to one of her hind legs

1038
01:02:44,337 --> 01:02:47,135
while she patiently stood
and allowed him to do with her

1039
01:02:47,174 --> 01:02:51,270
as he would and could
or could not.

1040
01:02:51,311 --> 01:02:53,575
But when,
in the long intervals between,

1041
01:02:53,613 --> 01:02:55,205
she visited him in his pub,

1042
01:02:55,248 --> 01:02:58,411
he never found for her
more than a moment to spare.

1043
01:02:58,452 --> 01:03:00,443
Having ascertained,
with a sniff,

1044
01:03:00,487 --> 01:03:02,011
that there was nothing doing,

1045
01:03:02,055 --> 01:03:06,583
he would retire stiffly
to his duties behind the bar.

1046
01:03:06,626 --> 01:03:09,424
"Never mind, Tulip dear,"
I would say.

1047
01:03:09,463 --> 01:03:13,160
"It's the way of the world,
I fear."

1048
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,795
The nicest thing for her,
therefore, it seemed to me,

1049
01:03:16,837 --> 01:03:20,568
would be to find her
an Alsatian watney.

1050
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:35,955
Nancy:
"I have rented a bungalow
in Sussex for the summer.

1051
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:38,787
"Owner accepts dogs.

1052
01:03:38,825 --> 01:03:40,292
"No need to look further

1053
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:43,922
"if you are in search
of holidayaccommodation.

1054
01:03:43,964 --> 01:03:46,364
'N."'

1055
01:03:46,399 --> 01:03:49,891
Joe:"i flxed up Tulip's
love affairs here in London.

1056
01:03:49,936 --> 01:03:53,372
"Can't possibly make it.
Joe."

1057
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,011
"None of your dogs

1058
01:04:02,048 --> 01:04:03,982
"could possiblybe as good
as mountjoy.

1059
01:04:04,017 --> 01:04:05,382
"And Mrs. Tudor-Smith

1060
01:04:05,418 --> 01:04:07,477
"is frightfullykeen
on the marriage.

1061
01:04:07,521 --> 01:04:09,386
'N."'

1062
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:11,913
Oh, this was Nancy's trump card.

1063
01:04:11,958 --> 01:04:14,324
Mountjoy belongs to some people

1064
01:04:14,361 --> 01:04:16,591
a little further down
witchball lane.

1065
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,927
He is an Alsatian

1066
01:04:17,964 --> 01:04:20,865
of such ancient
and aristocratic ancestry

1067
01:04:20,901 --> 01:04:23,665
that Mrs. Tudor-Smith
has been heard to declare

1068
01:04:23,703 --> 01:04:27,730
that his genealogy went back
even further than her own did.

1069
01:04:27,774 --> 01:04:29,605
I have often seen him,

1070
01:04:29,643 --> 01:04:33,079
uh, just outside the gates
of badgers' holt,

1071
01:04:33,113 --> 01:04:34,580
where he resided.

1072
01:04:34,614 --> 01:04:38,880
He always seems to stand in
the classic"show dog" attitude,

1073
01:04:38,919 --> 01:04:41,319
as though he had invented it.

1074
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:43,822
And he perpetually poses
for cameras

1075
01:04:43,857 --> 01:04:46,621
that he must believe
are somewhere about.

1076
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,027
If he has ever emitted
any sound louder than a yawn,

1077
01:04:50,063 --> 01:04:51,530
I have not heard it...

1078
01:04:51,565 --> 01:04:55,365
certainly nothing so coarse
as a bark.

1079
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:59,437
"Dear Nancy, I have
an urgent business matter

1080
01:04:59,472 --> 01:05:04,409
which might require my presence
in London over the summer."

1081
01:05:04,444 --> 01:05:06,435
"If you wanta second string,

1082
01:05:06,479 --> 01:05:09,448
"Colonel Finch says you can
have Gunner whenever you like.

1083
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:11,712
'N."'

1084
01:05:13,353 --> 01:05:14,820
We went.

1085
01:05:14,854 --> 01:05:16,788
 

1086
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:21,084
Well, we're here,
aren't we?

1087
01:05:21,127 --> 01:05:23,425
But you've no idea
of the difficulties ahead.

1088
01:05:23,463 --> 01:05:26,261
You couldn't
possibly cope.

1089
01:05:26,299 --> 01:05:28,358
You're exaggerating.

1090
01:05:28,401 --> 01:05:31,063
If you can cope,
so can I!

1091
01:05:31,104 --> 01:05:32,901
 

1092
01:05:32,939 --> 01:05:36,670
Tulip entered her heat
on the first day of june,

1093
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,371
and within a few days,

1094
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:42,108
mon repos
was in a state of siege.

1095
01:05:42,148 --> 01:05:44,708
Nancy began by thinking this
rather amusing,

1096
01:05:44,751 --> 01:05:47,948
and she found the little
scotties and sealyhams

1097
01:05:47,988 --> 01:05:51,389
who came to call sweet.

1098
01:05:51,424 --> 01:05:52,618
 

1099
01:05:52,659 --> 01:05:54,593
She found it less amusing,
though,

1100
01:05:54,628 --> 01:05:57,563
when they accumulated
and camped out all night

1101
01:05:57,597 --> 01:06:00,589
quarreling and whining
among the seven dwarves.

1102
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:01,862
 

1103
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:03,892
Nancy found it
less amusing still

1104
01:06:03,937 --> 01:06:05,905
when she tried
to take Tulip for walks

1105
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:08,066
and fell into the error
I had made

1106
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:10,474
of attempting
to beat off her escort,

1107
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:12,637
which resulted
in a torrent of complaints

1108
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:14,044
amongst the locals

1109
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:18,244
that she'd been seen
in torn clothes and flesh.

1110
01:06:18,284 --> 01:06:20,115
 

1111
01:06:20,153 --> 01:06:22,178
 

1112
01:06:27,794 --> 01:06:30,490
Tulip, therefore,
was not taken out at all,

1113
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,691
and all the windows
presented her

1114
01:06:32,732 --> 01:06:36,498
with a spectacle of a dozen
or so of her male friends

1115
01:06:36,536 --> 01:06:38,128
awaiting her outside.
 

1116
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:41,004
She barked at them incessantly.

1117
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:44,499
They barked back.
She would break into song.

1118
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:48,105
The expensive curtains
were all in tatters.

1119
01:06:48,148 --> 01:06:50,616
Soon they forced their way
in at several points,

1120
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,550
and my sister and I engaged

1121
01:06:52,585 --> 01:06:55,986
in ejecting dogs
of all shapes and sizes,

1122
01:06:56,022 --> 01:06:59,048
from dining room, sun parlor,

1123
01:06:59,092 --> 01:07:01,788
and even in the night
from our bedrooms.

1124
01:07:01,828 --> 01:07:05,059
I've never seen such
scruffy articles!

1125
01:07:05,098 --> 01:07:07,794
You're an absolute
disgrace!

1126
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:11,827
Go on! Sod off!
Bugger off home!

1127
01:07:11,871 --> 01:07:14,806
Get back to your slums!

1128
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:17,833
 
You're not her class.

1129
01:07:17,877 --> 01:07:21,779
Oh, damn and blast the dogs!

1130
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:26,183
Joe!

1131
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:28,720
  Joe!

1132
01:07:31,024 --> 01:07:33,754
For god's sake! Joe!

1133
01:07:35,495 --> 01:07:40,125
Joe: Tulip had not seen much of
mountjoy during her wooing week.

1134
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:43,795
The Tudor-Smiths
had thought it undesirable

1135
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:46,738
that he should mlx
in such low company.

1136
01:07:46,773 --> 01:07:48,707
But now was
the appropriate time,

1137
01:07:48,742 --> 01:07:50,710
and she was pleased to see him.

1138
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:53,406
And as soon
as he made his wishes clear,

1139
01:07:53,446 --> 01:07:56,244
she allowed him to mount her.

1140
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:59,683
But for some reason, he failed
to achieve his purpose.

1141
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:04,213
His stabs, it looked to me,
did not quite reach her.

1142
01:08:04,257 --> 01:08:06,748
After a little,
she disengaged herself

1143
01:08:06,793 --> 01:08:08,818
and began to flirt
in front of him.

1144
01:08:08,862 --> 01:08:11,729
But he had graver ends in view.

1145
01:08:11,765 --> 01:08:13,528
Again she stood.

1146
01:08:13,566 --> 01:08:16,091
This time, he appeared to
have moved further forward,

1147
01:08:16,136 --> 01:08:19,037
but now she gave a nervous cry
and escaped from him once more.

1148
01:08:19,072 --> 01:08:20,972
 

1149
01:08:23,309 --> 01:08:25,436
They tried again and again.

1150
01:08:25,478 --> 01:08:28,106
The same thing always happened.

1151
01:08:31,651 --> 01:08:33,278
It was sorrow to watch them

1152
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:36,345
trying to know each other
and always failing,

1153
01:08:36,389 --> 01:08:38,789
until she would have no more
to do with him

1154
01:08:38,825 --> 01:08:40,850
and drove him away.

1155
01:08:41,995 --> 01:08:43,462
Who would have supposed

1156
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:47,489
that mating a bitch
could be so baffling a problem?

1157
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:54,439
I sent for the local vet.

1158
01:08:54,474 --> 01:08:56,339
Next morning,
he came and stood with me

1159
01:08:56,376 --> 01:09:01,177
while the animals repeated their
futile and exhausting antics.

1160
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,477
It's the dog's fault.

1161
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:09,682
His foreskin is too tight,
you know?

1162
01:09:09,722 --> 01:09:11,622
He can't draw her.

1163
01:09:11,658 --> 01:09:13,751
That's a disability
that could have been corrected

1164
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:15,761
when he was a puppy.

1165
01:09:15,795 --> 01:09:18,059
He's a rig dog, too.
Eh?

1166
01:09:18,097 --> 01:09:21,726
He has
an undescended testicle.

1167
01:09:21,768 --> 01:09:25,568
That's a serious
disqualification in mating.

1168
01:09:25,605 --> 01:09:27,129
Eh?

1169
01:09:27,173 --> 01:09:30,040
Uh...

1170
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:31,543
 

1171
01:09:31,578 --> 01:09:33,808
Ugh! Off with you.

1172
01:09:33,847 --> 01:09:36,179
There was nothing now to be done

1173
01:09:36,216 --> 01:09:40,516
but to bundle Tulip
and convey her to mon repos.

1174
01:09:40,553 --> 01:09:43,113
 

1175
01:09:43,156 --> 01:09:47,684
# Human beings
are prudes and bores #

1176
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:49,160
 

1177
01:09:53,533 --> 01:09:57,299
We re-entered her taxl
and were driven back.

1178
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:07,036
Dusk was now falling.

1179
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,742
I restored her
to the ravaged back garden,

1180
01:10:09,782 --> 01:10:12,307
and it was while I stood
with her there

1181
01:10:12,352 --> 01:10:14,547
that the dog next door

1182
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:18,148
emerged through what remained
of the fence.

1183
01:10:18,191 --> 01:10:21,354
He hung there in the failing
light... half in, half out...

1184
01:10:21,394 --> 01:10:24,295
his attention
flxed warily upon me.

1185
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:28,664
He was a disreputable,
dirty ragamuffin.

1186
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:31,431
I smiled at him.

1187
01:10:31,471 --> 01:10:33,962
 

1188
01:10:34,007 --> 01:10:38,706
"Well, there you are, old girl,"
I said to Tulip.

1189
01:10:38,745 --> 01:10:42,203
"Take it or leave it.
It's up to you."

1190
01:10:42,248 --> 01:10:46,207
I knew my intervention
was at an end.

1191
01:11:09,809 --> 01:11:13,404
Tulip gazed at me
in horror and appeal.

1192
01:11:13,446 --> 01:11:15,175
"Heavens," I thought.

1193
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:18,581
"This is love?
These are the pleasures of sex?"

1194
01:11:18,618 --> 01:11:19,983
 

1195
01:11:20,019 --> 01:11:21,418
It was a full half-hour

1196
01:11:21,454 --> 01:11:26,323
before nature released dusty,
who instantly fled.

1197
01:11:26,359 --> 01:11:27,758
And it was more as though

1198
01:11:27,794 --> 01:11:32,288
she had been freed from
some dire situation of peril

1199
01:11:32,332 --> 01:11:35,358
than from the embraces of love.

1200
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:40,201
The following day,
a car was summoned

1201
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,104
to take us to the station.

1202
01:11:42,141 --> 01:11:43,301
 

1203
01:11:43,343 --> 01:11:46,335
When all was ready
for immediate departure,

1204
01:11:46,379 --> 01:11:49,940
the engine running,
the car door open,

1205
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:52,247
I emerged
from the ruined bungalow

1206
01:11:52,285 --> 01:11:54,185
with Tulip on the lead

1207
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:58,054
and ran the gauntlet of dogs
down the garden path.

1208
01:11:58,091 --> 01:12:02,494
They pursued us in a pack
so far down the country lanes

1209
01:12:02,528 --> 01:12:05,827
that I was suddenly terrified
that the more pertinacious

1210
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:08,732
would gain the station
and invade the train.

1211
01:12:08,768 --> 01:12:11,669
The scene had the quality
of a nightmare,

1212
01:12:11,704 --> 01:12:14,605
but the car outstripped them all
at last,

1213
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,939
and we got safely away.

1214
01:12:17,977 --> 01:12:20,844
 

1215
01:12:26,419 --> 01:12:29,855
Tulip was not a barren bitch.

1216
01:12:32,492 --> 01:12:35,052
Later on, when she got heavier,

1217
01:12:35,094 --> 01:12:38,655
I set about designing a box
for her.

1218
01:12:42,135 --> 01:12:46,595
I asked miss Canvenini to be
on hand in case we needed her.

1219
01:12:48,975 --> 01:12:53,173
But Tulip took us unawares.

1220
01:12:53,212 --> 01:12:56,147
She whelped five days
before her scheduled time

1221
01:12:56,182 --> 01:13:00,243
and was alone in my flat
when her labor began.

1222
01:13:00,286 --> 01:13:02,379
She was in her box.

1223
01:13:02,422 --> 01:13:05,016
She had understood its purpose
after all.

1224
01:13:05,058 --> 01:13:06,423
She was panting.

1225
01:13:06,459 --> 01:13:08,552
A tiny sound, like
the distant mewing of gulls,

1226
01:13:08,594 --> 01:13:10,528
came from the box.

1227
01:13:10,563 --> 01:13:13,123
I knew that Tulip was glad
that I was there.

1228
01:13:13,166 --> 01:13:16,294
Nevertheless,
I did not approach her.

1229
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:19,668
I could not see well,
but I knew what was happening.

1230
01:13:19,705 --> 01:13:21,798
And I heard her tongue and teeth
at work.

1231
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:24,935
She was nosing this package
out of herself,

1232
01:13:24,977 --> 01:13:26,842
severing the umbilical cord,

1233
01:13:26,879 --> 01:13:30,246
releasing the tiny creature
from its tissues,

1234
01:13:30,283 --> 01:13:33,218
and eating up the afterbirth.

1235
01:13:35,455 --> 01:13:38,390
I was in awe
of this beautiful animal.

1236
01:13:38,424 --> 01:13:40,119
In the midst of her life,

1237
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:42,787
performing unerringly
upon herself

1238
01:13:42,829 --> 01:13:45,889
the delicate and complicated
business of creation,

1239
01:13:45,932 --> 01:13:50,028
as though directed
by some divine wisdom.

1240
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:53,937
She produced eight puppies
at half-hourly intervals

1241
01:13:53,973 --> 01:13:58,273
and was not done
until evening fell.

1242
01:13:58,311 --> 01:14:02,680
When it was plain
that she had finished,

1243
01:14:02,715 --> 01:14:05,650
I went and kissed her.

1244
01:14:06,786 --> 01:14:10,051
She allowed me
to touch and lift her babies.

1245
01:14:10,089 --> 01:14:12,284
She had complete
confidence in me

1246
01:14:12,325 --> 01:14:14,759
that I would not hurt them.

1247
01:14:14,794 --> 01:14:16,523
It was misplaced.

1248
01:14:19,265 --> 01:14:21,665
As soon
as my common senses returned

1249
01:14:21,701 --> 01:14:22,998
and I envisaged a future

1250
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:26,801
that contained
eight extra dogs...

1251
01:14:26,839 --> 01:14:28,966
I prepared a bucket of water

1252
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:30,976
and a flour sack weighted

1253
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:33,911
with such heavy objects
as I could lay my hands on.

1254
01:14:33,946 --> 01:14:37,074
How could I distract
proud Tulip's attention

1255
01:14:37,116 --> 01:14:40,552
while I carried out
my dark deed?

1256
01:14:42,388 --> 01:14:44,822
Suddenly, she hurried out
into the sitting room,

1257
01:14:44,857 --> 01:14:49,317
as though making for my terrace,
which was her customary latrine.

1258
01:14:53,032 --> 01:14:55,432
For the first time in her life,

1259
01:14:55,468 --> 01:14:58,562
she had deliberately fouled
my flat.

1260
01:14:58,604 --> 01:15:02,096
But I was not thinking of that
as I mopped it all up.

1261
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:04,439
I was thinking
how sadly bedraggled and thin

1262
01:15:04,477 --> 01:15:05,944
she had appeared

1263
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:08,242
in the brief glimpse
I had of her.

1264
01:15:08,281 --> 01:15:10,215
The bucket and flour sack

1265
01:15:10,249 --> 01:15:13,275
were fated not to be used
as first intended.

1266
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:16,186
Though looking back now
over the years,

1267
01:15:16,222 --> 01:15:19,453
it might have been better
if it had been.

1268
01:15:21,394 --> 01:15:23,760
And as I watched upon my terrace

1269
01:15:23,796 --> 01:15:27,596
the unfolding of these
affectionate, helpless lives,

1270
01:15:27,633 --> 01:15:29,032
I hoped to put the creatures

1271
01:15:29,068 --> 01:15:32,196
out among adult, educated,
and prosperous people,

1272
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:34,103
but my hopes were not realized.

1273
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:36,233
 

1274
01:15:36,275 --> 01:15:38,368
My landlord, understandably,

1275
01:15:38,411 --> 01:15:42,177
had told me to get my animals or
myself out of the place at once.

1276
01:15:42,215 --> 01:15:47,380
The puppies went one by one
to whomsoever would take them.

1277
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:50,218
How well did I do for them?

1278
01:15:50,256 --> 01:15:53,020
I did in the end
what I'd meant not to do.

1279
01:15:53,059 --> 01:15:54,754
I'd cast them to fortune.

1280
01:15:54,794 --> 01:15:58,093
I had flown too high.

1281
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,998
Health and happiness
cannot be secured.

1282
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:04,628
And the only way to avoid
the onus of responsibility

1283
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:06,604
for the lives of animals

1284
01:16:06,639 --> 01:16:08,903
is never to traffic in them
at all.

1285
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:11,068
I gave one puppy
to a shopkeeper friend

1286
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:12,771
who offered to find him a home.

1287
01:16:12,812 --> 01:16:15,872
He was sold over the counter...
to whom, I never discovered.

1288
01:16:15,915 --> 01:16:18,611
What happened to him?
I don't know.

1289
01:16:18,651 --> 01:16:20,380
The owner of one said
it had been too difficult

1290
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:21,750
to house-train.

1291
01:16:21,787 --> 01:16:25,348
The owner of another, a laborer,
and the last, a drinker,

1292
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:28,827
spun a long story to account
for its disappearance.

1293
01:16:28,861 --> 01:16:33,730
The impulse to follow up their
small destinies soon weakened.

1294
01:16:33,766 --> 01:16:36,997
Hmm. Better not to know.

1295
01:16:37,036 --> 01:16:39,061
 

1296
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,565
Whatever blunders
I may have committed

1297
01:16:43,609 --> 01:16:47,170
in my management
of my animal's life,

1298
01:16:47,213 --> 01:16:51,149
she lived on
to the great age of 161/2.

1299
01:16:51,617 --> 01:16:55,610
I was a bit drained in spirit
when Tulip came into my hands.

1300
01:16:55,655 --> 01:16:59,318
And the 15 years
she lived with me

1301
01:16:59,358 --> 01:17:02,725
turned into the happiest
of my life.

1302
01:17:02,762 --> 01:17:06,528
She entered my life
when I was quite over 50,

1303
01:17:06,565 --> 01:17:10,831
and she entirely transformed it.

1304
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:14,067
She offered me what I had never
found in my life with humans...

1305
01:17:14,106 --> 01:17:15,903
constant, single-hearted,

1306
01:17:15,941 --> 01:17:19,069
incorruptible,
uncritical devotion,

1307
01:17:19,111 --> 01:17:23,070
which is in the nature
of dogs to offer.

1308
01:17:23,115 --> 01:17:27,643
She placed herself
entirely under my control.

1309
01:17:27,687 --> 01:17:30,155
Looking at her sometimes
in her later years,

1310
01:17:30,189 --> 01:17:32,180
I used to think
that the ideal friend...

1311
01:17:32,224 --> 01:17:36,320
whom I no longer wanted,
perhaps never wanted...

1312
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:39,388
would have had the mind
of my Tulip,

1313
01:17:39,432 --> 01:17:41,696
always at one's service
through the devotion

1314
01:17:41,734 --> 01:17:44,999
of a faithful
and uncritical beast.

1315
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:48,803
Are not all human contacts
based upon one person's wish

1316
01:17:48,841 --> 01:17:51,867
to claim the affairs of another?

1317
01:17:51,911 --> 01:17:53,173
Everyone, it seems,

1318
01:17:53,212 --> 01:17:57,376
wishes everyone else
different from what they are.

1319
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,884
 

1320
01:18:17,103 --> 01:18:20,038
Nancy: Joe!

1321
01:18:20,072 --> 01:18:21,869
  Joe!

1322
01:18:21,907 --> 01:18:24,398
Joe!
