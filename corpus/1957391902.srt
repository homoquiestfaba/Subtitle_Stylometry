1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,083
(police siren wails)

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,330
- Dr. Langdon.

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,628
Are you familiar with the
statistics of violence

4
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:21,283
in the United States?

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,559
There's a violent crime
committed every 17 seconds.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,370
Forcible rape every five minutes.

7
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:32,909
Robbery every 46 seconds.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,003
Murder every 21 minutes.

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,869
The fact that I find it

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,999
hard to ignore the staggering statistics,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,783
is what my husband calls paranoia.

12
00:00:46,788 --> 00:00:48,138
I'm sure he's mentioned it.

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,830
- [Doctor] Would you like some
coffee or a glass of water?

14
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,071
- Water would be nice.

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,210
Thank you.

16
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,409
Jack thinks that we're all immortal,

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,539
and that the pain and
the suffering happens

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,113
on some distant planet.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,610
He doesn't realize

20
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,403
that the violence is
happening right outside,

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,053
and that the statistics
have faces and families,

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,893
and spouses.

23
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,173
- Like yourself.

24
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:28,493
- I'm a woman living in a volatile city.

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,949
My husband leaves me alone for
days on end in a big house.

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,979
Every night after work,

27
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,809
I have to walk through
a dark parking garage

28
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:36,923
to get to my car.

29
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,923
Yeah, I think I'd sum myself
up as a walking target.

30
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,939
- And you don't think you can survive.

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,690
- I'm not afraid of dying if
that's what you're asking.

32
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:54,513
Death I could take.

33
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:59,140
- [Doctor] And what are you afraid of?

34
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,273
- Just look at the news.

35
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,399
There's sick, sick, torturous
things going on out there.

36
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,943
And I can't get Jack to see it.

37
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:20,008
- But your husband feels that
you're being a bit obsessive.

38
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,340
- I don't know what else I can do.

39
00:02:25,341 --> 00:02:26,499
- You know, you could confront your fears

40
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,850
instead of running from it.

41
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,193
Are you familiar with
the term virtual reality?

42
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,363
- I think so yes.

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,269
- We've developed a new treatment

44
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,698
to help people conquer phobias

45
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:45,099
that goes beyond virtual
reality or hypnosis.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,269
It involves a total mind immersion

47
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,719
which allows us to go far
into the human psyche.

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,309
It gives us a great deal more information

49
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,913
about the human mind for short.

50
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,957
I think this will be a
very great help to you.

51
00:03:01,183 --> 00:03:04,479
- This certainly is not what
I expected when I came here.

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,330
- I know it all sounds a bit ominous.

53
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,583
But it's quite safe.

54
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,249
You see, we need to know
how much fear is necessary

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,150
to differentiate between a real threat

56
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,603
and what is not a real threat.

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,100
Just look at the light and relax.

58
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:27,101
(suspenseful music)

59
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,789
- I'm sorry, Doctor Langdon.

60
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,383
But I'm just not sure.

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,743
- I know this is an awful
lot to digest at one time.

62
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,439
Maybe you'd like to come back another day.

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
We can try it again.

64
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,333
- Okay, I'll think about it.

65
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,491
(suspenseful music)

66
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,437
(soft music)

67
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,060
- [Reporter] Mayor McMillan's speech

68
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,689
at tonight's charity
benefit was interrupted

69
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,090
just minutes ago with a tragic
news of the mayor's daughter

70
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,479
22-year old Natalie McMillan
and four others were involved

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,630
in a drug-related one-car accident.

72
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:25,381
(dramatic music)

73
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,609
And in local news, Malibu
authorities are on the lookout

74
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,289
for the culprit in a series
of dog and cat mutilations

75
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,519
that has residents crying wolf.

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,269
More than 20 household
pets have disappeared

77
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,670
over the past two weeks
in the Malibu hillsides.

78
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,468
(soft music)

79
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:08,705
- Hi, Mrs. Porter.

80
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,770
Lovely day today, isn't it?

81
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:12,339
Beautiful.

82
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Beautiful day.

83
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,382
(dramatic music)

84
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,257
(fountain pouring)

85
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,585
- [Alarm Voice] Door is ajar.

86
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:28,793
You have 10 seconds to disengage
or reactivate the alarm.

87
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,610
Alarm activated, thank you.

88
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,611
- Jack?

89
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:44,032
Jack!

90
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,101
Jack?

91
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Jack.

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,439
- I don't care what the report says.

93
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,749
You can't run a business based around

94
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,631
some bullshit audit figures.

95
00:06:57,632 --> 00:06:59,518
Yeah listen, I got to finish packing.

96
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,839
Yeah, we'll talk about it on the plane.

97
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,009
See you then.

98
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,369
- You're leaving?

99
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,509
- I don't have any choice.

100
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,499
The auditors are trying to
write off some of our assets.

101
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,869
Tim and I are going to
New York for three days

102
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,499
to try to straighten it out.

103
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,569
- Three days.

104
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,679
- Did you see Dr. Langdon?

105
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,879
- [Jenny] Yes.

106
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,880
- Well?

107
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,769
- You know I heard on the news today

108
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,203
that there's been a rash of
cats and dogs missing lately.

109
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,369
What do you suppose is causing it?

110
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,723
- Road kills probably.

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,629
- Well, Mrs. Horton never found out

112
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,209
what killed her labrador.

113
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,469
She thought it might be
some kind of a wild animal

114
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,009
or something.

115
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,459
- Jenny, what am I
supposed to say to that?

116
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,429
- That you won't go.

117
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,498
That you won't leave me
here like this again.

118
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:51,799
- What did the doctor say?

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
- Not much.

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,459
- What am I supposed to do?

121
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,719
Let the company fall to pieces

122
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,539
because my wife is
terrified of her own shadow?

123
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,549
- Jack, her dog was ripped to pieces.

124
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,329
- The vet told Mrs. Horton it
was a roadkill, an accident.

125
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,039
And even if it was a wild animal,

126
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,869
a whole pack of them for that matter,

127
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,999
how the hell they going to get
in here for Christ's sakes?

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,209
This place is like Fort Knox.

129
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,029
I've installed a top security system,

130
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,449
closed circuit cameras,
the windows are like steel.

131
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,859
There's three deadbolts on each door.

132
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,059
I'm even building a brick wall outside.

133
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,679
I mean, what else can I do?

134
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,713
Stay with you every hour of every day?

135
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:37,053
Jenny, you got to stop this.

136
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,730
You won't even let me
open a window anymore.

137
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,330
- I'm sorry.

138
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,913
- We're becoming prisoners.

139
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,763
- I'm sorry, Jack.

140
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,053
Damn it, I just can't help it.

141
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:57,003
- You're gonna be fine.

142
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
- Do you love me?

143
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,920
- What do you think?

144
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,197
(soft music)

145
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,479
- [Alarm Voice] Alarm disengaged.

146
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,031
- I'll call you when I arrive
in New York to check on you.

147
00:09:37,032 --> 00:09:37,949
- Okay.

148
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:38,782
- It's gonna be late.

149
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,223
- That's okay, call me.

150
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:43,894
- I love you.

151
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:55,907
Bye honey.

152
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,813
(suspenseful music)

153
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,856
(ominous whispering)

154
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,204
(dog barking)

155
00:10:26,651 --> 00:10:29,651
(suspenseful music)

156
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,884
- [Alarm Voice] Alarm activated.

157
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,034
(doors locking)

158
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:48,035
Thank you.

159
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,893
- Hi, Theresa?

160
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,810
This is Jenny.

161
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:46,159
Jenny Porter.

162
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
How have you been?

163
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,323
Yeah, it has, hasn't it?

164
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,289
Hey, but we should get together sometime.

165
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,290
Yeah.

166
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,569
Hey you know what, what about now?

167
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,799
You could come over for dinner

168
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,019
and you could even stay the
whole night if you want.

169
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,313
Jack's out of town and, you're kidding.

170
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,853
Oh my God, I didn't even
know you had a baby.

171
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,663
He's 14 months old.

172
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
Oh wow Theresa.

173
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,170
Has it really been that long?

174
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,573
Oh listen, no problem.

175
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,610
We'll talk tomorrow then.

176
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,393
Okay, all right.

177
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,790
Okay bye-bye.

178
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,697
Oh, idiot.

179
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,515
(suspenseful music)

180
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,479
- [Reporter] So we can
count on more of the same,

181
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,939
sunny and 72.

182
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,149
Thanks Tony.

183
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,549
Coming up next, record
highs on Wall Street.

184
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,550
We'll be right back.

185
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,374
(dramatic music)

186
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:23,408
(ominous whispering)

187
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,372
(suspenseful music)

188
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:37,595
(crickets chirping)

189
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,626
(cat meows)

190
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,213
(suspenseful music)

191
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:57,538
- You hush, you're staying here with me.

192
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,129
- [Reporter] The House of
Representatives debated today

193
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,552
over the President's
controversial Crime Bill.

194
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:09,319
The reform package
includes drastic measures

195
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,459
to increase the number of
policemen on the streets

196
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,293
of our city.

197
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,652
As well as legislators...

198
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,653
(suspenseful music)

199
00:15:36,885 --> 00:15:38,631
In a related matter, the President...

200
00:15:38,632 --> 00:15:41,632
(flashlight clicks)

201
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:48,332
Their constitutional right to bear arms.

202
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,659
And the President is expected

203
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,909
to sign that bill into law tomorrow.

204
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,629
Officials in Congress are optimistic

205
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,479
that the Navy's new proposed high-tech

206
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,280
satellite detection system will result

207
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:05,702
in positive identification

208
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:08,359
that the body of the 28-year old woman

209
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,799
who was found mauled to
death today by wolves

210
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,939
in the Malibu hillside

211
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,689
was indeed Jenny Porter.

212
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,240
Authorities found traces
of Miss Porter's body

213
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,459
strewn throughout the Point Dune region,

214
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,470
where the Navy completed
its second of the successful

215
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:22,029
satellite matrix system launches.

216
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,839
Pentagon officials were
pleased with the results

217
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
and look forward to two more attacks.

218
00:16:25,081 --> 00:16:26,070
- Get a grip.

219
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:28,209
- Get the US out of the
UN was the cry today

220
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,469
in New York where the
President presided over

221
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,209
the historic Middle East Peace Conference.

222
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,010
The first time in over a
decade that representatives

223
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,487
of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization...

224
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,451
(growling)

225
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,521
(suspenseful music)

226
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,590
(dog growls)

227
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:08,320
(scratching on door)

228
00:17:08,321 --> 00:17:11,071
(dramatic music)

229
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:38,761
- Oh my God.

230
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:47,512
(door shakes)

231
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,041
(suspenseful music)

232
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:34,511
Let me in, let me in.

233
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:38,274
Please open this door.

234
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:41,890
(shotgun fires)

235
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,300
(dramatic music)

236
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:11,770
(dog growls)

237
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:14,438
(Jenny screams)

238
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:19,653
(crickets chirp)

239
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,363
- I'm sorry, baby.

240
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,450
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,410
Lay down.

242
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,870
Come on, lay down.

243
00:19:57,962 --> 00:20:00,462
(dog panting)

244
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:13,190
(dog whining)

245
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:15,858
(men screaming)

246
00:20:17,048 --> 00:20:20,191
- I'm gonna kill it, I'm gonna kill it.

247
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,900
(dog squealing)

248
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,901
(suspenseful music)

249
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,040
- Do you ever fantasize
about being killed?

250
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,630
- Never.

251
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:50,523
- Do you ever wonder about all
the different ways of dying?

252
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,280
You know, violently.

253
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:54,281
- Jesus.

254
00:20:58,232 --> 00:20:59,110
Are you hungry?

255
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:00,210
Want something to eat?

256
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:06,501
Come on, let's go.

257
00:21:08,482 --> 00:21:10,899
(soft music)

258
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:19,099
Are you hungry?

259
00:21:32,922 --> 00:21:34,339
Come here, honey.

260
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:40,819
Hey sweety.

261
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,003
Wanna eat, come on?

262
00:22:08,362 --> 00:22:10,544
- [Girl] Help me.

263
00:22:10,545 --> 00:22:12,195
(suspenseful music)

264
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,779
(glass breaks)

265
00:22:26,008 --> 00:22:28,591

266
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:41,152

00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:43,746
(light switch clicks)

270
00:23:46,368 --> 00:23:49,368
(suspenseful music)

271
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,307
(Jenny screams)

272
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:12,498
Bengolt, get away from that window.

273
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,499
Go on, get.

274
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:55,299
(water dripping)

275
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:13,059

(cat screeches)

278
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:30,631
Bengolt, Bengolt get out of here.

279
00:26:34,913 --> 00:26:35,746
You're driving me crazy.

280
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:36,787
Get away from that window.

281
00:26:37,593 --> 00:26:39,690
(Jenny gasps)

282
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:42,691
(suspenseful music)

283
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:09,181
(phone rings)

284
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,580
Holly.

285
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:14,581
Holly!

286
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:19,111

287
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,309
Holly, Holly.

- [Alarm Voice] Door is ajar.

289
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,359
You have 10 seconds to disengage

290
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,360

292
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,113

00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:47,289
- [Alarm Voice] Four, three, two, one.

294
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,699
Sequencing complete.

295
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,482
Initiating automatic lockdown.

296
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:53,349
(window sliding)

297
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,703
Alarm activated, thank you.

298
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,080
(suspenseful music)

299
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:05,021

300
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:12,721

306
00:29:00,763 --> 00:29:01,763
Holly.

307
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,444
Holly?

308
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,122

(dogs growling)

324
00:31:11,945 --> 00:31:13,362
- No answer.

325
00:31:13,363 --> 00:31:15,081
- She's probably sound asleep by now.

326
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,665
- Yeah, she's safe.

327
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:20,430

(suspenseful music)

340
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
- Sparky?

341
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,239
- Hi, Mrs. Porter.

342
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,893
Are you playing with Sparky, huh?

343
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,183
I'm gonna take him home,
I think he likes you.

344
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:52,705
Good boy!

345
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,363
Mrs. Porter, are you all right?

346
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,940
- Yeah.

347
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,003
Yeah, I'm fine.

348
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,003
It was just Sparky.

349
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,090
- [Doctor] Jenny.

350
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,499
- What was that?

351
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,583
- [Jenny] Doctor Langdon?

352
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,853
- Our time is up.

353
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,433
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to take you out now.

354
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,710
I'll count back to one and you'll awaken.

355
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,780
Three.

356
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,090
Two.

357
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:35,654
One.

358
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,549
(Jenny gasps)

359
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,550
Welcome back.

360
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,250
- Oh my God.

361
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,339
I thought I left the office.

362
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,719
- That's the beauty of it.

363
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
How do you feel?

364
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
- Okay.

365
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,239
- I think it was necessary for you to see

366
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,373
how much fear can feed upon itself.

367
00:34:02,414 --> 00:34:04,164
- I was so terrified.

368
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,979
- I merely planted the
seed of a German shepherd.

369
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,313
And you did the rest.

370
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,771
- My mind turned Sparky
into a pack of wolves?

371
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:17,313
- Yes.

372
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,673
- Good Lord, maybe I should be in therapy.

373
00:34:25,054 --> 00:34:28,193
- At least until you get
a better perspective.

374
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,473
- Excuse me, hello?

375
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,089
- Oh, Mr. Robinson, how are you today?

376
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,223
- Oh, I'm not that great.

377
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,901
- Doctor Langdon will be right out

378
00:34:52,902 --> 00:34:54,962
and he'll have you smiling in no time.

379
00:34:54,963 --> 00:34:59,963
By the way, did you change
insurance companies?

380
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,459
We've had a problem getting
paid the last couple of visits.

381
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,769
- Oh yeah.

382
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,603
I mean, no.

383
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,739
I mean I meant to get a
new insurance company,

384
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,679
but the others guys are real
sticklers about payments.

385
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,139
- Let me know when you can please.

386
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,973
- I will.

387
00:35:13,973 --> 00:35:14,806
- [Doctor] Come on in, George.

388
00:35:14,807 --> 00:35:16,139
- Oh, hi doc.

389
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
- Yeah, go on.

390
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,749
- What is your problem
that you had the see me

391
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,750
three days early?

392
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:31,039
- Oh, it's pretty much the same problem.

393
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,083
Only worse.

394
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,323
I, I got an eviction notice.

395
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,139
- Didn't you pay the rent as we discussed?

396
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,539
- Yeah, I meant to.

397
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,829
But I, I guess I got carried
away at the Price Club again.

398
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,359
- George, what good is it to save money

399
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,859
on 10 cases of fish food,

400
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,261
when you can't even
afford to pay your rent?

401
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:53,509
- It seemed like a great buy at the time.

402
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,879
- You've gotta be more responsible

403
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,880
when it comes to your financial matters.

404
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
- I know.

405
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,830
- All right, let's get started.

406
00:36:06,963 --> 00:36:09,973
I want you to relax and tell
me exactly what you're feeling.

407
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,113
- What am I feeling?

408
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,769
I'm feeling like it's all
dog eat dog out there.

409
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,149
Or better yet, it's cat
eat bird, dog eat cat,

410
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,069
and so on and so forth.

411
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,261
Until I'm the one that's being eaten.

412
00:36:31,262 --> 00:36:34,170
(mouse squeaks)

413
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:35,552
(suspenseful music)

414
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:38,477
(hawk screeches)

415
00:36:38,478 --> 00:36:40,811
(cat meows)

416
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:45,772
(dog growls)

417
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:49,699
(suspenseful music)

418
00:37:00,979 --> 00:37:03,896
(staple gun fires)

419
00:37:16,548 --> 00:37:18,965
(paper rips)

420
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,610
- I think I'll go with Lana.

421
00:37:36,611 --> 00:37:37,861
Oh, we're late!

422
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:42,626
(students chattering)

423
00:37:46,451 --> 00:37:49,201
(dramatic music)

424
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:58,296
(students chatter)

425
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:05,481
(dramatic music)

426
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:40,222
(typing)

427
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,027
(cards falling)

428
00:39:46,988 --> 00:39:50,187
(suspenseful music)

429
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:53,188
(lights flickering)

430
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,178
(man groans)

431
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:26,819
- Damn, I must've overslept again.

432
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,273
Last guy that fell asleep on the job,

433
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,109
he got tagged and they took
him to the crematorium.

434
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:38,269
When he woke up, ashes to ashes.

435
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,713
Dust to dust.

436
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,400
Anderson, number two.

437
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,599
Riding lawnmower accident.

438
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,933
You're gonna have to
improvise something there.

439
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,473
Cut off all his toes.

440
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:00,589
Nasty.

441
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,590
Very nasty.

442
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,803
- What a horrible way to die.

443
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,759
- George, it's not the how or why.

444
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,400
How many times do I have to tell you?

445
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,909
You can't choose your own death.

446
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,123
Death chooses you.

447
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,649
Oh, that's good.

448
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,650
That's very good.

449
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:32,421
(phone rings)

450
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,089
- Hello?

451
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,023
- [Vince] Yeah, is the
room still for rent?

452
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:40,978
- Yes, yes it is.

453
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:42,943
Would you like to come over and see it?

454
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,624
(dial tone)

455
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,339
Let's see, what do we have here?

456
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,033
Original, tomato.

457
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,243
Fish food, great.

458
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:01,753
Petey, chow time.

459
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,576
(knocking on door)

460
00:42:17,805 --> 00:42:20,779
Are you the one that called?

461
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,568
- Yep, that's me.

462
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,736
(police siren blares)

463
00:42:29,803 --> 00:42:32,581
- What was your name again?

464
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:35,090
- Vince.

465
00:42:35,091 --> 00:42:36,781
Vince Powers.

466
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:39,282
(dog barking)

467
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,447
- Well, the room's right this way.

468
00:42:59,593 --> 00:43:02,343
(water splashes)

469
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,909
Well this is...

470
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:09,673
- A little sparse for $300 a month.

471
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,219
- Well, the ad did say this
was an unfurnished room.

472
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,979
- Unfurnished.

473
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,139
The ad said furnished.

474
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,439
- Oh no, that's impossible.

475
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,489
I distinctly remember
filling out the card.

476
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:23,140
- There it is in black and white.

477
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,403
One furnished room, $300.

478
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,959
- Looks like somebody altered the card.

479
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,239
- Really?

480
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,563
Gosh, I hadn't noticed.

481
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,683
Geez, that's awful.

482
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,483
The world today.

483
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,493
So how about it Georgie?

484
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,950
- How'd you know my name?

485
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,422
- So what are we going to
do about our little problem?

486
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:49,561
- What problem?

487
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:53,422
- We seem to have a
disagreement on the room.

488
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,799
- I wouldn't call it a disagreement.

489
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,279
It's more of misunderstanding,
don't you think?

490
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,280
- What do I think?

491
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,220
I think you should make good on your end.

492
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,359
- You're right.

493
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,560
You're absolutely right.

494
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,523
I can lend you a few of my things.

495
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:13,129
I don't have much.

496
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,609
- That's okay, Georgie,

497
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,283
Cause I don't need very much.

498
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,029
- Anything else, Vince?

499
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,258
- Yeah, a little more to the right.

500
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:31,259
Ho, perfect.

501
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,508
- Well, if there's nothing else,

502
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,453
- Hey, how about dinner?

503
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:39,468
- I'm not hungry.

504
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,473
- Not for you, for me.

505
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,699
Bed and board, pal.

506
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,793
Says so right here.

507
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:49,770
- Where?

508
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,750
Meals provided.

509
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:54,363
- There, see.

510
00:44:54,364 --> 00:44:56,699
Would I lie to you about
something like that?

511
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,223
Hey, you're probably tired
from all the moving, right?

512
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:02,489
Want to hit the sack right away?

513
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,379
- Yeah, I'm real tired.

514
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,989
- There see, I knew it.

515
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,483
I'm not such a bad guy.

516
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,609
Tell you what?

517
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,099
Just give me 10 bucks
and we'll call it even.

518
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,223
- Ten dollars.

519
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,410
Oh, I almost forgot.

520
00:45:15,411 --> 00:45:17,625
I need the rent money from you,

521
00:45:17,626 --> 00:45:19,643
- But I haven't even
slept here yet, Georgie.

522
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,260
I may not like your bed.

523
00:45:24,496 --> 00:45:26,579
I may not like this room.

524
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:30,502
I may not like you, and then what?

525
00:45:30,503 --> 00:45:32,368
I've just given my life savings

526
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:34,307
to sleep in an uncomfortable bed

527
00:45:34,308 --> 00:45:37,209
in a lousy apartment
leased by a total creep.

528
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,579
I ask you, is that fair?

529
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,359
- Well, I suppose not,

530
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,193
but I don't...

531
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:43,150
- Tell you what.

532
00:45:43,151 --> 00:45:44,289
I'll go to the bank tomorrow

533
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,629
if it'll make you feel any better.

534
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,443
In the meantime, how about that 10 bucks?

535
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:01,084
- That's fifty dollars.

536
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:03,652
- Look on the bright side, Georgie.

537
00:46:03,653 --> 00:46:05,933
You won't have to cook
for me for five days.

538
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,879
- Is there anything else
you'll be needing, Vince?

539
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,150
- Georgie believe me, if I do,
you'll be the first to know.

540
00:46:24,444 --> 00:46:27,111
(winding clock)

541
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:40,469
(door opens)

542
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,533
Pleasant dreams, Georgie.

543
00:46:53,716 --> 00:46:56,216
(phone rings)

544
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,540
- Hello?

545
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:07,573
Good morning, Wells.

546
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,959
What are you doing up so early?

547
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:14,329
I'm late?

548
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:16,999
Late!

549
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:20,439
(dramatic music)

550
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:45,348
(water dripping)

551
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:53,816
(dramatic music)

552
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,116
I can't vouch for you, Vince,

553
00:48:26,117 --> 00:48:27,833
but I was not raised in a barn.

554
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,139
Rule number two, do not,

555
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,429
I repeat, do not use my toiletries.

556
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,429
If you do, you're a dead man, understand?

557
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,023
Without order, there is chaos.

558
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:43,163
What's that?

559
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,550
You say something, Vince?

560
00:48:51,267 --> 00:48:53,683
I didn't think you did.

561
00:48:56,739 --> 00:48:59,739
(suspenseful music)

562
00:49:07,067 --> 00:49:09,567
(door closes)

563
00:49:26,147 --> 00:49:28,814
(girl laughing)

564
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,179
- How's the view from down there, Georgie?

565
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,259
- View?

566
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,269
Vince, I wasn't looking.

567
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,909
- Sure, and the check is in
the mail and I love you...

568
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,009
- Do you have the rent check?

569
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,810
- I promise to pay the rent on time.

570
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,259
Georgie, I promised you I'd go
to the bank today, didn't I?

571
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,439
It's not the first time
I've broken my promise.

572
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,665
- You don't have it?

573
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,083
- No.

574
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:04,706
- You know Vince, without
order there is chaos.

575
00:50:04,707 --> 00:50:06,119
(slams door)

576
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,209
- Georgie, are you trying to insinuate

577
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,860
that I'm taking advantage of you?

578
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,016
Gosh, next thing you know,

579
00:50:13,017 --> 00:50:16,159
you'll be giving me a
list of rules to live by.

580
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,039
I suppose this attitude
you're flexing here,

581
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,989
stems from this morning's events.

582
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,569
I suppose you think I left
that mess for you to clean.

583
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,403
Right?

584
00:50:22,404 --> 00:50:25,179
What do you think, that
I was raised in a barn?

585
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,499
Well, I saw what you did to
the kitchen and the bathroom,

586
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
cleaning it up for me,

587
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,149
thinking I would be so inconsiderate

588
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,793
to not clean up my own mess.

589
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,509
Well it just so happens that I
was at the bank this morning.

590
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,789
When I remembered how
I'd left the room a mess.

591
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:41,199
So I got out of my place,
in the front of the line,

592
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,719
and walked all the way
home just to clean it up.

593
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,229
Well imagine my shock and surprise,

594
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,459
when I found out that you
had already done it for me.

595
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,157
Trying in essence to show me up.

596
00:50:55,158 --> 00:50:57,259
- I wasn't trying to show you up.

597
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,639
- Georgie, I think you owe me an apology.

598
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,419
- All right Vince, I'm sorry.

599
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,599
- Jesus Georgie, don't apologize.

600
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,023
It's too late for that.

601
00:51:09,206 --> 00:51:10,836
And I'll tell you what.

602
00:51:10,837 --> 00:51:12,679
You want your rent so badly?

603
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,357
I'll just go and get it for you.

604
00:51:14,358 --> 00:51:17,239
Oh yeah, I know a place that's open.

605
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,816
I guess I'll just have
to be rude to my guest

606
00:51:19,817 --> 00:51:22,093
and leave her here alone with you.

607
00:51:23,627 --> 00:51:26,709
- Oh Vince really, it
can wait till tomorrow.

608
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,936
- Car keys.

609
00:51:27,937 --> 00:51:28,937
- What?

610
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:31,859
- Well, I can't very
well walk the 20 miles,

611
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,499
now can I, Georgie?

612
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,557
I'd be gone all night.

613
00:51:35,558 --> 00:51:37,193
Car keys.

614
00:51:39,686 --> 00:51:42,293
I just hope you're satisfied.

615
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:50,671
(knocking on door)

616
00:51:50,671 --> 00:51:51,671
- Come in.

617
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:58,233
- Hi, I'm Georgie.

618
00:52:07,817 --> 00:52:09,567
You have lovely toes.

619
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,700
- Thanks.

620
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,823
- I'm an expert on toes.

621
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,423
You might say toes are my life.

622
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:26,102
- My ex-boyfriend gave it to me.

623
00:52:26,103 --> 00:52:29,459
It's a symbol of his
love and kind devotion.

624
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,713
- It's sweet.

625
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,219
What does it say?

626
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,343
- Satan's slut.

627
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:42,009
I think he was a little
wasted when he picked it.

628
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:43,860
- Well, it's the thought that counts.

629
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:47,150
- All done.

630
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,410
How do they look?

631
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:51,980
Like the color?

632
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:55,303
- Yes, yes.

633
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,299
- Don't worry, Georgie.

634
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,480
It won't bite.

635
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,229
Oh, I thought you said
toes were your life.

636
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,740
- Yes, dead ones.

637
00:53:10,623 --> 00:53:13,947
- Hey you little weirdo. (laughs)

638
00:53:26,296 --> 00:53:28,879
(men shouting)

639
00:54:10,896 --> 00:54:13,479
- Hey buddy, lock yourself out?

640
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,393
- My car.

641
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:17,910
What did you do to it?

642
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,629
- What are you getting
so upset about Georgie?

643
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,479
I went out to get your rent last night,

644
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,809
and on the way home, I don't know,

645
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,849
I must've taken a wrong turn and bam.

646
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,529
Ended up in a homecoming parade.

647
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,719
Hey, a simple mistake.

648
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,149
It could happen to anybody.

649
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:36,939
- But it's my car, Vince.

650
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,049
- Georgie, you're right.

651
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:43,050
So I guess this belongs to you.

652
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,309
Congratulations, Georgie.

653
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:49,469
First place for the best decorated car.

654
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:51,895
Ho, and if that weren't enough,

655
00:54:51,896 --> 00:54:54,709
I got the rent money too.

656
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,760
Just like I promised.

657
00:54:58,524 --> 00:55:01,173
- What am I supposed to do with these?

658
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:03,559
- Oh, now I suppose
you're going to tell me

659
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,829
you wanted cash.

660
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,599
You know Georgie, you are
one hard-to-please guy.

661
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,940
Besides I was late, I was in a hurry.

662
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:15,146
(dramatic music)

663
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:26,856
(brakes screech)

664
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:30,649
- What does he want from me?

665
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:32,143
All I want is a little peace.

666
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,259
What do I have to do
to get a little peace?

667
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,159
- [Reporter] Last night, a
bizarre robbery took place

668
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,234
downtown when a lone unidentified burglar

669
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,899
broke into a video arcade,

670
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,869
getting away with hundreds
of dollars in quarters.

671
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:45,956
After police gave chase
and shots were fired,

672
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:47,989
the suspect eluded police

673
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:50,639
by ducking in a lengthy parade route.

674
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,883
Police are still searching for the car.

675
00:55:54,405 --> 00:55:56,822
(horn honks)

676
00:55:58,435 --> 00:56:01,102
(tires screech)

677
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,459
- Nice car friend.

678
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,510
You know how to read?

679
00:56:14,385 --> 00:56:16,746
You know what this says?

680
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:19,044
- S-A-M?

681
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:21,545
- Beautiful, what's this read?

682
00:56:24,336 --> 00:56:26,336
- S-A-M sucks.

683
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,019
- Next time you're
gonna decorate your car,

684
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:30,853
you should call us.

685
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,063
We'd love to help.

686
00:56:33,696 --> 00:56:36,446
(banging on car)

687
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:43,706
(glass breaks)

688
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:44,866
- Little shit!

689
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:47,534
(window breaks)

690
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:53,247
(frat boys shouting)

691
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,460
- Cornell, snap to it.

692
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:27,986
I need a tag right away for this one.

693
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:31,089
Cops are on their way
down right now, Kafka.

694
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:33,879
- Well, we're all out of room I'm afraid.

695
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,259
- Nonsense, Georgie.

696
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,819
This is the revolving
door of life and death.

697
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,439
Someone's always coming in.

698
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,539
Someone's always going out.

699
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,149
So we are here for pickup as well.

700
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:46,140
- Who?

701
00:57:46,141 --> 00:57:48,430
- Number 15, Brewster

702
00:57:49,459 --> 00:57:51,543
The magician's assistant.

703
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:54,007
Poof, you're dead.

704
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:59,103
Hurry up with that tag,
they'll be here any minute.

705
00:58:03,576 --> 00:58:06,576
(suspenseful music)

706
00:58:33,957 --> 00:58:35,129
- What do we got here?

707
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:39,149
- Murder victim, decapitation.

708
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:42,036
- I haven't seen one of
those in a long time.

709
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:43,187
- Sorry about the wait.

710
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,249
- No hurry.

711
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,039
- She's not going anywhere. (laughs)

712
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,549
Nice clean cut.

713
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,479
- [Assistant] Yeah, it's
a good follow-through.

714
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:54,783
- [Detective] She got a name?

715
00:58:55,728 --> 00:58:57,713
- Satan's slut!

716
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,440
- You sure that's not just
some sort of stage name?

717
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,270
- Excuse me.

718
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,650
- What's that kid's name?

719
00:59:13,237 --> 00:59:15,904
(tires screech)

720
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:28,627
(suspenseful music)

721
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,556
(hatchet bangs)

722
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:38,557
(suspenseful music)

723
00:59:56,269 --> 00:59:58,769
(dog barking)

724
01:00:17,979 --> 01:00:20,312
(kicks can)

725
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:25,859
(suspenseful music)

726
01:00:56,557 --> 01:01:00,140
(garbage truck approaches)

727
01:01:09,568 --> 01:01:12,401
(Georgie yelling)

728
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:04,839
- Hey, wait a minute.

729
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,329
Hey, I, I know this must look bad for me,

730
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:10,489
but it's not me.

731
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,749
You got to believe me, it's not me.

732
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,529
It's my roommate.

733
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:14,913
He's been driving me crazy.

734
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:19,178
- You look like shit.

735
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:23,229
You've either got the worst
table manners in the world

736
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:27,699
or you're too stupid to clean
up after you cut up a body.

737
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,769
- Cut up, me?

738
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,223
I had nothing to do with it.

739
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:33,809
I'll prove it to you.

740
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:35,079
- Hey, what do you think you're doing?

741
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,739
- I'm going to show you her ass.

742
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:37,828
- You little pervert.

743
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:40,669
- She has a tattoo there.

744
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,630
- How do you know?

745
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:43,029
- She showed it to me.

746
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,376
- She showed it to you?

747
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:47,529
- Was that before or after
you killed her, Georgie?

748
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,879
- What?

749
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:49,959
- Get him.

750
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,627
(playful music)

751
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,679
- I got him.

752
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:06,329
I got him, I got him.

753
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:10,328
(assistant screams)

754
01:03:10,329 --> 01:03:12,996
(playful music)

755
01:03:45,219 --> 01:03:46,469
- You're fired!

756
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:58,669
- I would like to purchase a
very powerful handgun, please.

757
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,070
- How much you got to spend?

758
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,460
- What will this buy me?

759
01:04:09,537 --> 01:04:11,219
- For the price you're paying,

760
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,299
that's the best home
defense weapon money'll buy.

761
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,689
- Bullets, I need bullets.

762
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,609
- Well, we have several types.

763
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:20,738
Wad cutters, dumb dumbs.

764
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:23,482
It would help if I knew
what you were shooting at.

765
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:24,653
- My roommate.

766
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,920
I want to blow his head off.

767
01:04:28,179 --> 01:04:32,673
- In that case, I recommend hollow points.

768
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:38,073
They're the best for close range targets.

769
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:41,810
Sign here.

770
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:49,229
That'll be 48 hours before
you can have the weapon.

771
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,794
State regulation.

772
01:04:50,795 --> 01:04:53,975
- I don't have 48 hours.

773
01:04:53,976 --> 01:04:55,223
- Hey!

774
01:04:57,134 --> 01:04:59,884
(brakes screech)

775
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,423
- What's up, Georgie?

776
01:05:05,477 --> 01:05:08,359
(dramatic music)

777
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,219
Hey wow, man.

778
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,415
Rent's not due for another three weeks.

779
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:14,859
- Well, I'm speeding
up your 30-day notice.

780
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,039
- Can we discuss this?

781
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,999
- Out of my apartment, out of my life.

782
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
- Hey, take a coffee break pal, will ya?

783
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:23,639
Uh listen, there's
something you ought to know.

784
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,799
- No, this is my apartment.

785
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,139
I make the rules, I make the decisions.

786
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,099
Without order, there is chaos.

787
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:32,497
I'm ordering you to disappear.

788
01:05:34,146 --> 01:05:35,243
- Hold it, punk.

789
01:05:35,244 --> 01:05:37,577
(gun fires)

790
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:42,436
(monitor beeping)

791
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,169
- How is he?

792
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,170
- He'll recover.

793
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,873
He's a lucky boy, very lucky boy.

794
01:06:03,445 --> 01:06:04,866
(George gasps)

795
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:06,443
- Boy oh boy, Georgie.

796
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,560
You've really done it this time.

797
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,490
And if things weren't bad enough,

798
01:06:16,504 --> 01:06:18,893
we lost the lease on our apartment.

799
01:06:19,813 --> 01:06:24,493
You know Georgie, I
can't help but feel that,

800
01:06:25,383 --> 01:06:27,453
that I'm to blame for your misfortunes.

801
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,699
So I've decided that the only
proper thing to really do

802
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:35,863
is for me to spend all my
free time here with you.

803
01:06:35,864 --> 01:06:38,123
By your side.

804
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:42,286
(George grunting)

805
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:50,491
(alarm beeping)

806
01:06:51,944 --> 01:06:54,694
(dramatic music)

807
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,223
Goodbye Georgie.

808
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,229
- He's recovering just fine.

809
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,297
He'll be up and around in no time at all.

810
01:07:52,176 --> 01:07:53,676
His heart stopped.

811
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,332
Looks like a massive coronary.

812
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,793
(mother gasps)

813
01:07:57,794 --> 01:07:59,723
I've never seen anything like this before.

814
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:05,819
- You were with him till the end?

815
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,119
- Yes.

816
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,083
- Did he say anything?

817
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,940
- Yes.

818
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,643
He wanted me to tell you
that he loved you very much.

819
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,309
And above all else, he wanted to make sure

820
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:21,363
that I got my security deposit back.

821
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:27,921
(dramatic music)

822
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:49,611
(George shouting)

823
01:08:52,546 --> 01:08:54,025
- No, no, no.

824
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:55,609
He'll be all right.

825
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,039
All right, George.

826
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:01,399
We certainly didn't make
much progress today, did we?

827
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,429
- I was so angry.

828
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,916
I didn't know how else to respond.

829
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:05,750
- Yeah.

830
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:07,369
Well, we'll see you next Friday, George,

831
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,829
at your regular time.

832
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:09,830
- Okay.

833
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,800
- No, no, no.

834
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,600
That's not what we do.

835
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,650
Look, let me give you someone

836
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:19,250
that can tell you more about it.

837
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:23,210
Dr. Dempsey, could you
speak to Mr. Isaacs?

838
01:09:24,485 --> 01:09:25,789
He's seen the report on "60 Minutes"

839
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,590
and wants to cancel his appointment.

840
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,200
- Damn it.

841
01:09:31,647 --> 01:09:33,069
Hello, Mr. Isaacs.

842
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,159
This is Dr. Dempsey.

843
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,260
What can I do for you?

844
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:39,163
No, that's not accurate.

845
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:43,543
No, she did not have her brain fried.

846
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:45,899
No, no damage at all.

847
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,726
You know we're suing for that.

848
01:09:47,727 --> 01:09:52,727
Yes, yes, I am aware of
the cats in the microwave.

849
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:55,889
But just be rest assured.

850
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,939
Our equipment is very safe.

851
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:58,990
You will not explode.

852
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,560
No, that's not true.

853
01:10:01,561 --> 01:10:03,043
We have very few deaths here.

854
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,116
Well, that was several months ago

855
01:10:08,117 --> 01:10:10,453
and those kids were just college students.

856
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:13,849
We adjusted the emissions

857
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:15,809
and we gave him a very nice memorial fund

858
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:16,960
for their whole family.

859
01:10:18,746 --> 01:10:22,099
Let me put you on hold for a second.

860
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:23,489
I'll transfer you to the other phone.

861
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:24,490
He hung up.

862
01:10:29,338 --> 01:10:30,171
(phone beeps)

863
01:10:30,172 --> 01:10:32,457
- [Receptionist] Shall I
send in your 11 o'clock?

864
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:34,383
- Send him in.

865
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,336
Shall we begin?

866
01:10:47,337 --> 01:10:50,069
- Well, actually Dr. Langdon,

867
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:52,403
I have to tell you,
I'm a little concerned.

868
01:10:54,510 --> 01:10:56,149
- About what?

869
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:59,039
- Well sir, you did say
the procedure was new

870
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,833
and I did just hear
the last guy screaming.

871
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,545
- Steve, I'm a professional
and I'm here to help you.

872
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:09,705
Do you really think I'd put you in danger?

873
01:11:09,706 --> 01:11:12,563
- No, I mean, yes.

874
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,129
I hope not.

875
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:17,530
- Why don't you have a seat?

876
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:25,296
(static charges)

877
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:31,077
(Hawaiian music)

878
01:11:53,237 --> 01:11:55,987
(flash explodes)

879
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:02,698
- Hello?

880
01:12:06,930 --> 01:12:07,930
- Forest.

881
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:14,479
- Marshall, can you
tell me what's going on?

882
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,480
- You're having a near death experience.

883
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,859
- You mean I'm dead?

884
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:20,860
- Yes.

885
01:12:22,906 --> 01:12:23,906
- What did I do?

886
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:25,673
- You don't remember?

887
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,643
- I remember olives.

888
01:12:31,826 --> 01:12:34,243
(jazz music)

889
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,933
- Hey, here's one for you.

890
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:48,599
What's going on with those shots of me

891
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,429
and my skydiving set?

892
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,684
- I still have a few more to print.

893
01:12:52,685 --> 01:12:54,183
- You gonna come up with me sometime?

894
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,439
- What if you're up there
and the thing doesn't open?

895
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,273
- The chute?

896
01:12:58,274 --> 01:12:59,409
- Yeah.

897
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:00,710
- You can forget about it.

898
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:04,526
- Yeah thanks, I think I will.

899
01:13:04,527 --> 01:13:06,429
- Oh come on, Steven, that's half the fun.

900
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,569
- What, half the fun is dying?

901
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:09,239
Since when is dying half the fun?

902
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,789
- Marshall.

903
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,309
- [Marshall] How you doing, Fred?

904
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,419
This is Steven Forest.

905
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:16,609
- Marshall tells me good things.

906
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:17,596
- He does?

907
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,809
- Fred's the editor of
California Magazine.

908
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:21,095
I showed him some of your stuff.

909
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,739
- Steve, I thought it was tremendous.

910
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,119
Really.

911
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,459
Flight leaves Tuesday morning.

912
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:27,599
You'll get in say nine-ish.

913
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,089
We'll get to work by eleven.

914
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,603
We'll have you back the next day.

915
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,919
- Wait, back from where?

916
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,489
- A photo shoot for the magazine.

917
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:40,619
- Call my office, we'll
give you the rundown.

918
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,669
I got to see some people.

919
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:42,660
I just wanted to meet you.

920
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:44,289
It was a pleasure.

921
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,609
You guys go crazy.

922
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:46,610
Dinner's on me.

923
01:13:48,067 --> 01:13:49,599
Hey Dave!

924
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,379
- You should have been
doing this a long time ago.

925
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:53,377
Get the hell on that passport once.

926
01:13:53,378 --> 01:13:56,513
Okay, that's the one.

927
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:02,460
Ask her to dance.

928
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:05,180
- Oh no.

929
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:06,829
- Oh come on Steve, this is your night.

930
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,219
You're on a roll, celebrate.

931
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:09,439
- I don't.

932
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,473
- Why, why not?

933
01:14:11,543 --> 01:14:13,041
- I don't dance.

934
01:14:13,042 --> 01:14:14,512
- Jesus, Forest.

935
01:14:14,513 --> 01:14:17,143
You don't dance, you don't
jump out of airplanes.

936
01:14:20,032 --> 01:14:21,032
- I don't know.

937
01:14:23,362 --> 01:14:26,279
(Marshall choking)

938
01:14:36,129 --> 01:14:39,129
(banging on table)

939
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,499
- It was awful, wasn't it?

940
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,470
I think it affected you worse than me.

941
01:14:56,137 --> 01:14:57,187
- He looked so young.

942
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,479
God, I hate these things.

943
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:00,719
Don't you hate these things?

944
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,720
- Yeah.

945
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,899
I hate these things.

946
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,052
- So what are you telling me?

947
01:15:09,053 --> 01:15:10,803
He died, choking on an olive?

948
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:14,204
- It's just like that guy.

949
01:15:14,205 --> 01:15:15,484
Did you hear about that guy?

950
01:15:15,485 --> 01:15:16,318
- What guy?

951
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:17,539
- He was having lunch with his wife.

952
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,259
It was a tuna salad sandwich.

953
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:20,849
An hour later, he's dead.

954
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,339
- What the hell are you
talking about, he's dead?

955
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,240
- Bad tuna.

956
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:24,249
Same thing with chicken.

957
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:26,479
Salmonella, people die.

958
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,739
- You heard about this guy.

959
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,874
He was killed walking by
the Empire State Building.

960
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:32,009
Somebody dropped a penny.

961
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:33,149
- Oh, come on.

962
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:35,049
- No, he's right, they got a law now.

963
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,145
- I'm Paula.

964
01:15:36,146 --> 01:15:38,859
- Steven Forest.

965
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,693
- Oh, wow.

966
01:15:39,694 --> 01:15:41,239
You're his friend from high school.

967
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,903
The photographer guy, huh?

968
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,539
Did you do this one?

969
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:47,470
- Yeah.

970
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:48,499
- It's really good.

971
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,884
- Steve-O.

972
01:15:49,885 --> 01:15:52,109
I'm sorry.

973
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:54,139
I know you guys were tight.

974
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:54,973
Listen, about Tuesday.

975
01:15:54,974 --> 01:15:56,849
My guy will pick you up about eight.

976
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:57,683
- Tuesday?

977
01:15:57,684 --> 01:15:58,819
- The shoot.

978
01:15:58,820 --> 01:15:59,820
- Oh right, right.

979
01:16:01,194 --> 01:16:02,075
- Great.

980
01:16:02,075 --> 01:16:02,908
- Did you tell him?

981
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:03,741
- You got to tell him that story.

982
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:05,399
- Some guy in Georgia, what?

983
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:06,819
- Yeah, you didn't hear about this?

984
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:08,149
In Atlanta?

985
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:10,300
This guy's walking down
the street one day.

986
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,539
He exploded.

987
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,229
Nothing left but his shoes.

988
01:16:15,230 --> 01:16:16,469
He exploded.

989
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:17,670
Apparently this happens.

990
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,192
- I've got to go.

991
01:16:21,193 --> 01:16:22,443
- Are you okay?

992
01:16:27,892 --> 01:16:29,720
(phone beeps)

993
01:16:29,721 --> 01:16:32,683
- Yo, right.

994
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,760
June-ish.

995
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:39,011
(police radio blares)

996
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:41,512
(siren wails)

997
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:50,779
- Was it a heart attack?

998
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,880
- Steven, what are you afraid of?

999
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:57,461
- This morning, I was taking a shower

1000
01:16:57,462 --> 01:16:59,531
and suddenly I start thinking,

1001
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:03,179
what if I slip and fall and
smash my nose into the tile?

1002
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:05,369
Cartilege gets jammed up into my brain.

1003
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:06,203
- God!

1004
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,939
- A week ago, my bathroom
was just a bathroom.

1005
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,403
Now it's a gauntlet.

1006
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:17,629
Last night, I moved my alarm
clock away from the bed

1007
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,880
because I read in the Times,

1008
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:21,799
it gives out magnetic
fields that cause cancer.

1009
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,309
- I saw that too.

1010
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,209
- This morning, it didn't even wake me up.

1011
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:27,310
I didn't even hear it.

1012
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:32,021
What is that?

1013
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,172
- It's a macadamia nut.

1014
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,579
- How did you know, Marshall?

1015
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,440
- I met him at Sky High.

1016
01:17:41,441 --> 01:17:42,929
- You jump out of airplanes?

1017
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,743
- No, God no.

1018
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,629
I was there for two weeks
helping set up their computers.

1019
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,630
That's what I do.

1020
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:51,179
I took one of those courses you see on TV

1021
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:52,153
at three in the morning.

1022
01:17:52,154 --> 01:17:55,683
- Computers, computers.

1023
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,119
Aren't you afraid of
repetitive motion sickness?

1024
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,640
- With me it's birds.

1025
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:02,474
- What?

1026
01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:04,499
- I'm afraid they're
gonna peck my eyes out.

1027
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:05,500
Like in that movie.

1028
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:09,160
Did you ever have that?

1029
01:18:09,161 --> 01:18:13,519
- No, but I think I
know what you're saying,

1030
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,149
like pecking into your eyeballs,

1031
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:18,120
so there's blood coming down.

1032
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:19,608
- Nasty.

1033
01:18:19,609 --> 01:18:21,051
It's nuts.

1034
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:21,885
- It's ridiculous.

1035
01:18:21,885 --> 01:18:22,772
- We're completely stupid.

1036
01:18:22,773 --> 01:18:24,560
- I know.

1037
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:27,311
(romantic music)

1038
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,030
I feel like he's watching us.

1039
01:18:50,761 --> 01:18:55,329
- Apparently, there are these cases

1040
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,339
where people get phone calls
in the middle of the night

1041
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,239
from an old friend or something

1042
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,249
and they talk a little while,

1043
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:02,409
and the friend warns them
about something horrible

1044
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:03,971
that's gonna happen.

1045
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:05,709
And then later it turns out

1046
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:08,089
the old friend was killed or something,

1047
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,389
before the phone call.

1048
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:10,499
- Why are you telling me this?

1049
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:11,390
- Isn't it scary?

1050
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:12,749
Dead people on the telephone.

1051
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,730
- No, I mean don't tell me this.

1052
01:19:15,694 --> 01:19:16,873
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1053
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:23,124
Still here.

1054
01:19:34,567 --> 01:19:35,593
- You cheered me up.

1055
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,540
- Me too.

1056
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,559
Good luck on your photo thing.

1057
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,352
- Oh, thanks.

1058
01:19:42,353 --> 01:19:44,069
- Do you have a business
card or something?

1059
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,433
- Sure.
- Just in case.

1060
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,480
Maybe we could.

1061
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:49,021
- Definitely.

1062
01:19:49,022 --> 01:19:50,439
- All right then.

1063
01:19:58,262 --> 01:19:59,762
- Drive carefully.

1064
01:20:01,702 --> 01:20:02,702
- Bye.

1065
01:20:07,004 --> 01:20:09,504
(phone rings)

1066
01:20:18,141 --> 01:20:21,141
(suspenseful music)

1067
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:49,220
- Marshall?

1068
01:20:51,033 --> 01:20:53,366
(dial tone)

1069
01:20:58,774 --> 01:20:59,990
- Was that you?

1070
01:20:59,991 --> 01:21:01,009
- Was what me?

1071
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,489
- Nothing.

1072
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,109
I thought maybe you
were trying to warn me.

1073
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,309
- About what?

1074
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:06,300
- A trip.

1075
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,133
Oh, that's it, isn't it?

1076
01:21:07,134 --> 01:21:08,629
Something happened on the trip.

1077
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:10,459
This never would've happened
if you hadn't interfered.

1078
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,469
- Oh, now it's my fault.

1079
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:12,601
- You were always pushing me.

1080
01:21:12,602 --> 01:21:13,803
(flash explodes)

1081
01:21:13,804 --> 01:21:14,730
- [Model] How do I look?

1082
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:16,259
- [Steven] Great, where are you off to?

1083
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,339
- Spain.

1084
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,220
- [Steven] Oh, that's great.

1085
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:19,769
- Yeah, you been there?

1086
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:21,629
- [Steven] No, never been to Spain.

1087
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,939
Can you look at my finger?

1088
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:24,199
- Okay.

1089
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,759
- [Steven] So where are you off to?

1090
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,099
- London.

1091
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,781
- [Steven] Oh, you'll have a great time.

1092
01:21:28,782 --> 01:21:31,413
- Really, you've been there?

1093
01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:33,573
- [Steven] No, never been to London.

1094
01:21:33,574 --> 01:21:35,259
Can you look at my finger?

1095
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,773
- Oh, wait, wait.

1096
01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:38,420
Is my hair good?

1097
01:21:38,421 --> 01:21:41,072
- [Steven] So where are you off to?

1098
01:21:41,073 --> 01:21:42,179
- Italy.

1099
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,639
Great grandmother's going to be 90.

1100
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:46,369
- [Steven] Oh, flying?

1101
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:47,381
- Oh yeah.

1102
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:51,779
You ever worry about it, to fly?

1103
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,079
- Well you know it's like they say,

1104
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,093
you have a better chance of
dying in your own bathroom

1105
01:21:55,094 --> 01:21:57,279
or your car.

1106
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,369
Planes are very safe.

1107
01:21:58,370 --> 01:21:59,529
Safest way to travel.

1108
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:04,041
I'm sure every now and
again, something happens.

1109
01:22:04,042 --> 01:22:07,125
(jet engine falling)

1110
01:22:11,682 --> 01:22:12,515
(flash explodes)

1111
01:22:12,516 --> 01:22:14,909
(male model screams)

1112
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,249
- [Fred] Steve-O, this is Fred.

1113
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:19,672
Driver will be there to
pick you up around 7:30.

1114
01:22:19,673 --> 01:22:21,853
That's me, gotta go.

1115
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,399
- [Mom] Hi Steve, it's Mom.

1116
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,853
Dad and I were calling to
see how the funeral was.

1117
01:22:27,854 --> 01:22:28,821
Love you.

1118
01:22:28,822 --> 01:22:31,819
- [Paula] Hi Steven, it's Paula.

1119
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:33,439
I was just calling to see if you wanted to

1120
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,849
maybe go get a drink or something

1121
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,313
before you leave on your trip for luck.

1122
01:22:38,494 --> 01:22:40,994
(piano plays)

1123
01:22:57,123 --> 01:22:58,650
- You okay?

1124
01:22:58,651 --> 01:23:01,401
(crowd applauds)

1125
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:04,991
(siren wails)

1126
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,729
- [Radio DJ] Most insurance plans.

1127
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:12,349
Call toll free 1-800-888-NEED.

1128
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:15,726
That's 1-800-888-5633.

1129
01:23:15,727 --> 01:23:19,029
KBN in the Sin Barney
timeline, good morning to you.

1130
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,863
Up with me this hour

1131
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:21,729
as part of Earthquake Preparedness Week,

1132
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,449
we've got professor Mark Campmann

1133
01:23:23,450 --> 01:23:25,039
from the University of Arkansas.

1134
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,789
- [Mark] Hi, how are you?

1135
01:23:26,790 --> 01:23:28,089
- [Radio DJ] Professor Campmann predicts

1136
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:32,029
that the LA area will be hit
with a 9.5 magnitude earthquake

1137
01:23:32,030 --> 01:23:33,259
this Tuesday.

1138
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:34,279
- [Mark] That's correct.

1139
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:36,149
- [Radio DJ] Professor,
what exactly can we expect

1140
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,603
from a tremor of that size?

1141
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:40,923
- [Mark] Total devastation.

1142
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,239
- [Radio DJ] And we'll be right back.

1143
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,698
- [Commercial] And when you
don't get enough exercise...

1144
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:48,532
(doorbell buzzes)

1145
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,920
- Am I too early?

1146
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:55,800
So where are you off to?

1147
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:57,990
- San Francisco.

1148
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:00,123
- [Driver] I guess
you're getting out of LA

1149
01:24:00,124 --> 01:24:02,048
at just the right time.

1150
01:24:02,049 --> 01:24:03,019
- What do you mean?

1151
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,909
- [Driver] Well you know,
all this earthquake business.

1152
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:08,899
But I guess there's no ban on
earthquakes in Frisco either.

1153
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:10,498
- No, I guess not.

1154
01:24:10,499 --> 01:24:14,466
- [Driver] Well, what are you gonna do?

1155
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:16,009
You know, apparently it's not the shaking

1156
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:16,843
that's the problem.

1157
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:18,329
It's the stuff that falls on you.

1158
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,769
That's the killer.

1159
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:22,758
Massive spillage, head trauma.

1160
01:24:22,759 --> 01:24:23,592
(explosion)

1161
01:24:23,593 --> 01:24:24,699
- What's that?

1162
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,289
- [Driver] That and the fire, gas lines.

1163
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:28,919
Stuff burns.

1164
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:29,920
- What is that?

1165
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,973
(classical dirge plays)

1166
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:44,840
Stop!

1167
01:24:44,841 --> 01:24:46,370
(tires screech)

1168
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:49,621
- [Driver] What the hell are you doing?

1169
01:24:50,508 --> 01:24:51,869
- I don't understand.

1170
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,639
- That was the driver.

1171
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,589
Forest didn't get off the plane.

1172
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,689
- What?

1173
01:24:56,690 --> 01:24:58,576
- It wasn't the trip, you didn't even go.

1174
01:24:58,577 --> 01:24:59,468
(doorbell rings)

1175
01:24:59,468 --> 01:25:00,468
- The earthquake.

1176
01:25:01,309 --> 01:25:03,563
You remember you had
that hat with the light?

1177
01:25:09,563 --> 01:25:10,396
- What happened?

1178
01:25:10,397 --> 01:25:11,799
- It was like a mining hat.

1179
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,079
- The one with the light.

1180
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:13,913
- Yeah.

1181
01:25:13,913 --> 01:25:14,746
- What about it?

1182
01:25:14,746 --> 01:25:15,579
- I need it.

1183
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,009
- You need my mining hat?

1184
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:18,359
- [Mom] Who is it, Lou?

1185
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:20,359
- It's Steven, he wants my mining hat.

1186
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:22,009
- Hi Ma.

1187
01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:23,209
- You're digging a hole or something?

1188
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,259
You look terrible.

1189
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,618
- Hi honey, how was the funeral?

1190
01:25:27,619 --> 01:25:29,098
- It was great.

1191
01:25:29,099 --> 01:25:31,189
- Your father and I are
baking some pancakes.

1192
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:32,210
- No, thanks Ma.

1193
01:25:32,211 --> 01:25:33,863
I don't think we'll have time.

1194
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:38,308
- Oh, Steven, you really
should call your Auntie Carla.

1195
01:25:38,309 --> 01:25:41,148
She's about to have that ear operation.

1196
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:44,119
Call her, while she can still hear you.

1197
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,120
- Okay Ma.

1198
01:25:58,709 --> 01:26:00,268
- You want to tell me what's going on?

1199
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:01,102
- What?

1200
01:26:01,102 --> 01:26:02,102
- I don't know.

1201
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,159
- Look, this guy on the radio mentioned

1202
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,629
there might be an earthquake.

1203
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:09,569
- And you want my hat just in case?

1204
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:11,029
- Just want to be prepared.

1205
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:12,809
You guys should too.

1206
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,839
Maybe you want to keep the hat.

1207
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,089
- No, no.

1208
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:17,149
What if it hits while
you're in the shower.

1209
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,859
Are you gonna wear the hat in the shower?

1210
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:19,939
- I don't know, no.

1211
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,109
- Maybe you're just gonna
stop taking showers?

1212
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:22,980
- What are you saying?

1213
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:23,920
- I'm not saying anything.

1214
01:26:23,921 --> 01:26:26,319
I'm just wondering if you're
gonna stop taking showers.

1215
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,999
- Of course not.

1216
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:28,980
That's ridiculous.

1217
01:26:28,981 --> 01:26:31,015
- Yeah, it is.

1218
01:26:31,016 --> 01:26:32,198
(phone rings)

1219
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:34,606
- [Mom] I got it.

1220
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:37,357
(dramatic music)

1221
01:26:40,848 --> 01:26:45,848
- Dad, I got a job, a photoshoot.

1222
01:26:46,288 --> 01:26:47,538
- That's great.

1223
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:50,883
- I know it's great, it's really great.

1224
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:54,117
But I couldn't get on the airplane.

1225
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,157
Why am I doing this?

1226
01:26:56,158 --> 01:26:59,393
- I'm just not sure you know
what you're reacting to.

1227
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,219
When you get to be my age,

1228
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,139
you begin to realize that

1229
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,909
death is just another part of life.

1230
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:09,979
You're not happy about
it, but you accept it.

1231
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,189
You take your Auntie Carla for instance.

1232
01:27:12,190 --> 01:27:14,969
She's getting on, she
could go at any minute.

1233
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:18,087
But she's had a full life
and when the time comes,

1234
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:20,139
I'll be ready for it.

1235
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:23,899
I'll accept it and I'll
keep right on living.

1236
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:26,220
Everything's going to be okay.

1237
01:27:28,688 --> 01:27:29,807
- Really?

1238
01:27:29,808 --> 01:27:30,810
- That was Leah.

1239
01:27:30,811 --> 01:27:31,894
- [Dad] Yeah?

1240
01:27:33,158 --> 01:27:34,825
- Auntie Carla died.

1241
01:27:37,859 --> 01:27:38,859
- What?

1242
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:43,570
- She didn't make it
through the ear operation.

1243
01:27:45,139 --> 01:27:46,139
- Oh my God!

1244
01:27:48,248 --> 01:27:49,998
Oh my God, oh my God.

1245
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,943
(Dad shouting)

1246
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:01,680
(suspenseful music)

1247
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,189
- Why can't I remember?

1248
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,409
- [Marshall] Maybe you
never saw it coming,

1249
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,549
- But I was being so careful.

1250
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:13,550
- Hi there, cookie.

1251
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:16,579
- Auntie Carla?

1252
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,993
- How are you, sweetheart?

1253
01:28:18,909 --> 01:28:19,909
- I wish I knew.

1254
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,710
How are you?

1255
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:22,759
- I'm dead.

1256
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:24,539
- Oh yeah I heard.

1257
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,379
Dad was real upset.

1258
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,153
- I know, I'm going to give him a call.

1259
01:28:31,168 --> 01:28:33,178
(dial tone)

1260
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:36,848
(busy signal sounds)

1261
01:28:36,849 --> 01:28:38,516
- [Man] Who is this?

1262
01:28:43,263 --> 01:28:44,909
- [Radio Voice] Here
is the latest forecast

1263
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:47,069
for Los Angeles and vicinity.

1264
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:49,739
The synapses have brought a level trop

1265
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:51,196
over California today,

1266
01:28:51,197 --> 01:28:53,046
with a strong Western wind...

1267
01:28:53,047 --> 01:28:54,299
(knocking on door)

1268
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,849
Over Southern California.

1269
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:59,539
This trop will move east of
the Southern California...

1270
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,705
(mug shaking)

1271
01:29:01,706 --> 01:29:03,789
- Paula, cover your head.

1272
01:29:05,392 --> 01:29:06,392
- Why?

1273
01:29:08,297 --> 01:29:09,434
Hi!

1274
01:29:09,435 --> 01:29:10,736
- Come on, come on.

1275
01:29:10,737 --> 01:29:11,695
- What?

1276
01:29:11,695 --> 01:29:12,545
- Under the table.

1277
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:14,212
- What's the matter?

1278
01:29:15,847 --> 01:29:16,930
- Earthquake.

1279
01:29:18,095 --> 01:29:21,696
(helicopter flying)

1280
01:29:21,697 --> 01:29:23,530
- That's a helicopter.

1281
01:29:25,047 --> 01:29:27,439
- Oh, but there's gonna be an earthquake.

1282
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:28,273
- Oh my God.

1283
01:29:28,273 --> 01:29:29,106
- I know.

1284
01:29:29,107 --> 01:29:31,024
- No, your forehead's bleeding.

1285
01:29:31,025 --> 01:29:34,435
- Oh I guess I, a lot.

1286
01:29:34,436 --> 01:29:36,593
- Oh let me see.

1287
01:29:39,145 --> 01:29:40,849
What have you been doing?

1288
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:41,850
- Nothing.

1289
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,800
Did you go out with her?

1290
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:58,273
- [Marshall] A couple times.

1291
01:29:59,274 --> 01:30:00,274
- Did you kiss her?

1292
01:30:20,034 --> 01:30:22,701
(clock ticking)

1293
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:27,049
- Do you like Fred Astaire?

1294
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:28,050
- What?

1295
01:30:29,900 --> 01:30:33,269
- They're having a thing with Fred Astaire

1296
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:35,443
at the county museum.

1297
01:30:35,444 --> 01:30:37,113
I got two tickets.

1298
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,559
Do you like Fred Astaire?

1299
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,397
- Fred Astaire, not really.

1300
01:30:46,714 --> 01:30:47,714
I mean he's okay.

1301
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:49,670
The dancing.

1302
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:53,503
- Yeah, that's what I like, the dancing.

1303
01:30:56,230 --> 01:30:58,653
So do you want to go?

1304
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:03,690
- Yes.

1305
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,059
Where are you going?

1306
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,279
- I thought we're going to the movie.

1307
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:20,403
- What now?

1308
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,344
- You don't want to go?

1309
01:31:22,344 --> 01:31:23,177
- No, I do.

1310
01:31:23,178 --> 01:31:25,350
It's just the earthquake.

1311
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:26,480
(siren wails)

1312
01:31:26,481 --> 01:31:27,981
- Are you kidding?

1313
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:31,449
Steven, that's ridiculous.

1314
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:32,880
You're being ridiculous.

1315
01:31:33,732 --> 01:31:38,482
- [Steven] I just want to wait
until it's a little safer.

1316
01:31:46,484 --> 01:31:48,881
(police radio blares)

1317
01:31:48,882 --> 01:31:51,549
(monitor beeps)

1318
01:32:18,528 --> 01:32:19,528
- Paula!

1319
01:32:29,101 --> 01:32:30,101
Paula!

1320
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:33,180
Paula.

1321
01:32:33,181 --> 01:32:35,598
(car starts)

1322
01:32:40,907 --> 01:32:43,140
(Hawaiian music plays)

1323
01:32:43,141 --> 01:32:45,700
(tires screeching)

1324
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:48,959
Damn, I knew the minute
I did something stupid,

1325
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,519
this was going to happen.

1326
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,859
- All you did was cross the street.

1327
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,693
What are you gonna do,

1328
01:32:52,694 --> 01:32:54,389
spend your entire life
stuck on one city block?

1329
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:56,449
- I didn't have to run like an idiot

1330
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:57,573
into moving traffic.

1331
01:32:58,629 --> 01:33:00,099
I should have crossed when it was safe.

1332
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,539
- Steven, when is it ever safe?

1333
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:04,119
- So you admit it, I was right.

1334
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:05,779
It's never safe.

1335
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,389
- Nothing is ever safe,
so what's your point?

1336
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:09,059
Hey, Marshall.

1337
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:10,999
- Fred, what are you doing here?

1338
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,259
- Some schmuck dropped a
light on my head at the shoot.

1339
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,093
And what the hell are you doing here?

1340
01:33:15,094 --> 01:33:17,169
You're supposed to be up in San Francisco.

1341
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:19,449
- I couldn't get up the
nerve to get on the plane.

1342
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:22,079
(phone rings)

1343
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,629
- Hello?

1344
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:24,949
Right.

1345
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:26,619
Sorry guys, gotta go.

1346
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,169
Looks like I'm going to pull through.

1347
01:33:28,170 --> 01:33:29,619
Just a concussion.

1348
01:33:29,620 --> 01:33:32,969
Hey Steve-o, if you
live, will you call me?

1349
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:33,930
- Really?

1350
01:33:33,930 --> 01:33:34,930
- Hey, Phil.

1351
01:33:35,988 --> 01:33:38,905
(Marshall choking)

1352
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,279
- Would you stop that?

1353
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,989
What are you crazy,
those things killed you.

1354
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:45,999
- [Medic] I think we're getting something.

1355
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:46,880
- What's your point?

1356
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,810
- [Medic] Getting a pulse.

1357
01:33:47,811 --> 01:33:50,625
- If you hadn't eaten that
olive, you'd still be alive.

1358
01:33:50,626 --> 01:33:51,626
- [Medic] Breathe!

1359
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:56,105
- Yeah, but Steven, I love olives.

1360
01:33:56,106 --> 01:33:58,856
(Hawaiian music)

1361
01:34:04,546 --> 01:34:06,419
(flash explodes)

1362
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:07,639
- [Medic] We got him.

1363
01:34:07,640 --> 01:34:08,640
- Jesus.

1364
01:34:11,367 --> 01:34:12,367
That's incredible.

1365
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,287
- Perhaps you should come back next week.

1366
01:34:16,288 --> 01:34:21,288
- Sorry, I think I
understand everything now.

1367
01:34:21,486 --> 01:34:23,436
I don't think I have a problem anymore.

1368
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:38,086
(door closes)

1369
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,800
- Dr. Langdon.

1370
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,380
- Thank you.

1371
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:55,880
- Hello Brandon.

1372
01:35:08,706 --> 01:35:11,373
(machine beeps)

1373
01:35:30,525 --> 01:35:31,769
(intercom buzzes)

1374
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:33,533
- [Receptionist] Mrs. Dalton is here.

1375
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:38,475
Mrs. Dalton is here.

1376
01:35:38,476 --> 01:35:39,440
(static discharges)

1377
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:41,075
It's her usual time.

1378
01:35:41,076 --> 01:35:43,276
Mrs. Dalton is here.

1379
01:35:43,277 --> 01:35:44,836
I'm sending her in now.

1380
01:35:44,837 --> 01:35:48,004
Mrs. Dalton, Mrs. Dalton, Mrs. Dalton.
