I think the one that still
stands out the most to me
is the 3-D episode.

the episode where we find out

that we're Jewish.

18
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,851

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,826
There's this one moment
that I always see

32
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:37,862
when they play
the highlight reel,
you know,

33
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,399

are feeding the baby.

such a funny scene,

'cause I mess up

38
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,723

and they kept it.

39
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:18,336
The other one
would be, um,

40
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,305
an episode where I get
hypnotized by Tommy and Sally

41
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:25,076
and I end up going to
a restaurant to confront
the Big Giant Head,

42
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:28,412

the words that sort of
set off my hypnosis.

I love that scene.

In terms of Sally,
I would have to say,

47
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,298
and this is the se--
third episode we ever shot,

48
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,835

she kicks down the door.

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,059
I certainly do remember what I
think is the funniest moment,

57
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:19,431
which was when I stormed
upstairs in drag...

58
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,404
Well, that was a wash.

59
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,707
...and yanked off
my wig and earrings

60
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:32,844
and said I need...
...some herbal tea and
a fat-free cookie.

61
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:35,780
We did two passes, and only
on the second pass

62
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:39,251
Bonnie came-- ran
forward and said,
"Can you yank your wig off,

63
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,087
and your earrings,"
so it was virtually
an improvised moment.

64
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,556
I just thought
it was hilarious.

65
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:54,098
I think my biggest
challenge playing Harry

maintaining the energy for it,

winking at the fact

it never takes itself
seriously, ever.

00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:29,847

all-balls-out attitude

127
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:32,350

certainly led by John,

Don't blame us.

00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,432
We didn't know;

Isn't it great to always
have that excuse?

Yes, it definitely is.
Sorry, I'm an alien.

170
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,154
than seeing Jane Curtin
break up, 'cause you know

171
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,256
this is gonna go on
for another 20 minutes.

172
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:53,424
[laughing]

173
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,258
We'll get it.

174
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,293
Stay with us.
Stay with us.

175
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:02,266
[Director]
And...

176
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,636
These three guys,
John, French, and Joey,

177
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:09,306
that I feel like,
literally, are my brothers,

178
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:12,643
<i>and they've helped me learn
so much about myself</i>

179
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,177
<i>and so much about acting,</i>

180
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,180
and I will miss that
more than anything.

181
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:20,751
[audience cheering,
applauding]
