- You okay?
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

538

Okay.

It's okay. My daughter, Julia.

Yes.

Thank you.

Yeah, eventually.

That's where we think she ended up.

Can I ask why?

- Why she ran away?
- Yeah.

559
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,778
Yes, you can, but I don't think
you'll like me when I've told you.

560
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,281
Is it important if I like you?

No, not remotely.

562

Well, my daughter and I have
the same initial, "J."

563
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:51,962
One day she opened the wrong letter
and found out I was having an affair.

564
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,089
She was devastated.

565
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,551
She told me if I didn't stop,
she would tell her mother.

566
00:43:58,428 --> 00:44:01,888
Of course I agreed to stop,
but I didn't.

567
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,683
I couldn't.

568
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,854
And so she told her mother.
Her mother screamed at me

569
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,858
and I screamed at my daughter.
My daughter ran away,

571

- You didn't get away either.

- Yeah, I also heard them say

they may be putting us
in hotels for the night.

596
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,623
Oh, God. They told me
to report back at 7:00.

Yeah, me too. I think that's to collect
the vouchers for the hotels.

I saw a reasonably good restaurant
up there by the phones.

600
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,468
Maybe we could get together for an hour

have something to eat?

and he called me
in a highly stressed state.

713
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,927
Ma'am, we have an airport shutdown
and 60 grounded flights.

714
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,929
We are extremely stretched.

715
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,806
I need to know if you consider
this McGregor

716
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,266
to be a threat to public safety.

717
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,809
It's hard to say.

718
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,811
I mean, I think
we'd all feel a lot better,

719
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,813
including him,
if you could keep an eye on him.

720
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,356
Ma'am, is that a yes or a no?

721
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:15,733
Yes.

722
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,695
Right, okay. Thank you,
I'll get back to you.

723
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:23,116
Security to information desk, over.

724
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,159
This is information.
Go ahead, security, over.

725
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:29,205
Yeah, I need you to put out a call
for passenger McGregor,

726
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:35,295
- Tyler McGregor on flight 240 to Louisville, over.
- "McGregor... 240 to Louisville."

727
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,339
Yeah, tell him to report
to your desk immediately.

728
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:41,843
Is that it? No more information
than that?

729
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,012
He's a convicted sex offender.

730
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:48,016
You want to put that out over
the loudspeaker, be my guest. Over.

731
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:51,561
Let's have a drink.

732
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,397
- Okay.
- Come with me.

733
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,192
- Um, I'm sorry.
- Oh.

734
00:53:58,277 --> 00:54:00,069
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

735
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,738
It's okay.

736
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,406
So? You want to come?

737
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,242
Yeah.

738
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,372
MAN, over loudspeaker:
Would passenger McGregor

739
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:15,168
traveling on the 1830 flight 240 to Louisville

740
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,795
please report to the information desk
immediately?

741
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,715
That's passenger McGregor
to the information desk.

742
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,008
Thank you.

743
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,684
Sir, would you happen to be
John looking for Laura?

744
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,978
- Yeah.
- She described you well.

745
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,772
She left a message for you.

746
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,857
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

747
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,911
Okay.

748
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,666
Welcome to my crib.

749
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,126
Very luxurious.

750
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,464
One window, with a view of...

751
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,841
a brick wall.

752
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,303
Come on in.

753
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,138
I should really go.

754
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:11,975
Go where? Do what?

755
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,103
Come on, we're stuck here.

756
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:17,480
Hmm?

757
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,072
Uh, I wonder could you help me?

758
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,324
Could you put out a call for a passenger
who's traveling to Miami?

759
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:29,242
Passenger's name?

760
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,619
Well, I don't know her last name,
but the first name is Laura.

761
00:55:31,704 --> 00:55:33,579
We arranged to meet
in the restaurant across by--

762
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:35,206
Okay, sir,
this is an information desk.

763
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,958
I know that, I know that.
But this young girl,

764
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,168
she's a kid and she could
be in trouble. She's missing.

765
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:41,254
Sir, I'm busy. I'm going to have
to ask you to step away--

766
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,880
One call, that's it. 30 seconds.
You could have done it by now.

767
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:44,882
Hey, fellas, will you
get this guy out of here?

768
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,552
What's your problem?
Screw you.

769
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,387
Make yourself useful.

770
00:55:50,222 --> 00:55:52,557
Find us something to watch.

771
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:55,226
And relax, will you?

772
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:59,981
So we have a $30 credit
for food and drink.

773
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,192
- But we're not hungry, right?
- No.

774
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,777
[TV playing]

775
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,487
So let's celebrate instead,

776
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,365
or drown our sorrows.

777
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,242
Which?

778
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:16,414
- You've had too much already.
- Too much sorrows.

779
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,583
I agree.

780
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,503
No, too much to drink.

781
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,465
Don't be silly.

782
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,428
Yeah.

783
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,972
I really should go.

784
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,515
Why?

785
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,185
Why do you want to go?

786
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,980
Why does every man
nowadays want to leave me?

787
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:43,608
Is there something wrong with me?

788
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:44,901
No.

789
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,361
God, no, you're--

790
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,573
you're fine.

791
00:56:52,284 --> 00:56:54,577
- Then prove it.
- Please.

792
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,038
Kiss me.

793
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,373
I can't.

794
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,210
Why not?

795
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,587
Kiss me, come on.

796
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,591
You're drunk.

797
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,385
You don't like me.

798
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,555
Then what's the problem?

799
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,849
What's the problem?

800
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:19,811
- What's the problem?
- Please don't do that.

801
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:21,979
Ah.

802
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,194

[Whispers]
Say you're fuckin' sorry.

[Indistinct PA announcement]

809
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:14,443
Hey, Laura? Laura.

810
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,487
Hey.

811
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,239
- Hey. Sorry.
- Hey.

812
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,533
- Hi.
- How you doing? All right?

813
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,703
- You okay? I was worried about you.
- I'm fine. Sore head.

814
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:25,997
- Hungover?
- Little bit.

815
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,999
- Yeah.
- Sorry about last night.

816
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,209
Ah, that's no problem.
I got your note. Thanks.

817
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:31,627
- Nice note.
- Good.

818
01:00:31,712 --> 01:00:33,337
And so did you have fun?

819
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:34,797
- I'm not sure.
- Oh.

820
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,924
I think I must have fallen asleep.

821
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:39,218
Oh, I know all about that stuff. Yeah.

822
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,220
It's been a crazy few days.

823
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:42,722
I bet it has.

824
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:45,516
- Anyway...
- So...

825
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,019
- Good luck. Have a good journey.
- Yeah.

826
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,687
You really take care now.

827
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,731
It was really nice
to meet you again.

828
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,566
It was great to talk to you.
Great to meet you.

829
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,568
- Maybe we'll meet again one day.
- Yeah.

830
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,241
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,243
- See ya.
- See ya. Travel safe.

- I'm keeping my eye on you.

836
01:01:40,489 --> 01:01:42,990
You made the call.
You did the right thing.

JOHN'S VOICE:
"See you next time."

844
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:34,291
They were four innocent enough words,
but they went through me like a knife.

845
01:02:34,376 --> 01:02:36,961
Because in that moment, I realized to them
I'd become a familiar face,

846
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:41,132
a joke--the British guy
who was running a one-man campaign,

847
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:43,092
stubbornly scratching away,
refusing to do

848
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,762
what you've all been urging me to do
for years and years,

849
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,764
move on, let go, and all that stuff.

850
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:50,599
[Chuckling]

851
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,226
Yeah, it's not easy.

852
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,687
I got sober a long time ago
out in Los Angeles--

853
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,731
I don't know--
35, 36 years ago.

854
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,984
And I was crazy. I was insane.
I was sickened to death,

855
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:04,447
drunk and insane, and...
I was sentenced to AA meetings.

856
01:03:04,531 --> 01:03:06,449
And I hated--
I hated the damn things.

857
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,411
I hated all this God stuff.
It made me want to puke.

858
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,956
You know, "Move on. Let go, let God.
Surrender and win" and all this.

859
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,209
I was a winner.
I've been a winner all my life.

860
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,212
And, uh...

861
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,214
but I was fighting all the time.

862
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,924
And anyway,
to cut a long story short,

863
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:27,261
I met-- there was this old man.
He was a priest,

864
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,015
a Jesuit priest. His name was Joe Riley,
Father Joe Riley.

865
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,225
And I'll never forget him
as long as I live.

866
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,770
One night I was about to leave the meeting.
I had to get the hell out.

867
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:39,315
And he stood in my way, said,
"Where the hell do you think you're going?"

868
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,900
I said, "You get out of my way."

869
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:42,902
He said, "You're not going anywhere."

870
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:45,863
But he looked up into my face,
and he had these piercing blue eyes,

871
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,032
a cigarette in his mouth.
He said, "You know--"

872
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,367
He said, "You look like to me--
You look like

873
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,078
you're busted, disgusted
and not to be trusted."

874
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,330
[Chuckling]

875
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,998
And he was right. [Laughs]

876
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:01,003
I wasn't to be trusted by anyone.
I'd never trust myself either.

877
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:03,214
And one day I asked him--
I said, "Okay, Father,

878
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,758
you know all the"--I called him Father
and he got a kick out of that.

879
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:07,801
I said, "You know all the answers.
You're a pretty smart guy.

880
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,929
What's the shortest, most powerful
prayer in the world?"

881
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,472
'Cause I was fast.
I needed quick answers.

882
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,557
'Cause I wanted to be back
on the fast track.

883
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:16,060
I said, "What is the fastest, most

He said, "The fastest, most powerful
prayer in the world--"

885

"The fastest, most powerful prayer in the world,

- my friend, is 'Fuck it."'

888
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,241

"Fuck it." Can you believe it?

[Laughs] He said, "it's the prayer
of release and surrender."

890
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:36,997
And I felt the whole weight of the world
going off my shoulders.

891
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:39,500
And just before Father Riley died,

892
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:42,294
I asked him--I said, "How do I get it?
How do I know?"

893

that happened two days ago.

I was traveling on my way here--

898
01:04:57,269 --> 01:04:59,603
my journey here
with a young girl from Brazil.

899
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:02,731
She was a kid, beautiful little thing.
Name was Laura.

900
01:05:03,692 --> 01:05:05,693
And there was a snowstorm at Denver.

901
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,988
Flights were delayed
and so we arranged to have dinner.

902
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:10,948
And when I showed up,
she wasn't there.

903
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:13,784
But she left me this note.
Hold that, will you?

904
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:19,039
And she said,
"Ran into someone cute.

905
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:22,209
"Never done this kind of thing before.

906
01:05:22,294 --> 01:05:24,920

if my daughter is alive,

915
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:54,992
she knows where I am,
where to find me.

916
01:05:55,076 --> 01:06:00,164
And her silence means that she's probably
made the choice not to be in touch.

917
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,333
But if she's dead...

918
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,588
then she's dead.

919
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:13,052
