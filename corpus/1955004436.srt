Oh, hi.

5
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:37,448
It's so cool. Look at us, guys.

6
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:40,160
We're here, Southern California.

00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:45,749
<i>♪ Hoo, hoo ♪</i>

8
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:50,837
Um, I don't know if you guys notice
anything different about me.

9
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:57,177
Hey, short hair, don't care.

10
00:01:58,845 --> 00:01:59,930
<i>♪ Hoo, hoo ♪</i>

11
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:03,934
I cut my hair, y'all.

12
00:02:04,017 --> 00:02:07,353
You know what I noticed?
People judge you based on your hairstyle.

13
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:09,231
Ever notice that? Right?

14
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,817
'Cause I used to have really long hair,
and I'd wear it in a ponytail every day

15
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:15,070
'cause I didn't know how to do
anything to my hair, right?

16
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:16,821
So just, ponytail every day.

17
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:19,116
So... people thought I was a lesbian.

18
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,994
Hey, where all my lesties at?

19
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:25,413
<i>♪ Hoo, hoo ♪</i>

20
00:02:25,622 --> 00:02:27,207
Thank you for coming.

21
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,502
All my lesties.
That means a lesbian bestie.

22
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,797
Lestie.

23
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:37,425
I wore my hair in a ponytail.

24
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,553
Everybody thought I was a lesbian, right?
So now I cut my hair short.

25
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:43,389
So... people still think I'm a lesbian.

26
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:52,107
I think it's more than my hair
that gives off the vibe,

27
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,151
'cause sometimes
I'm a little tomboy, right?

28
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,486
Like, I call everybody "bro."
"Hey, what's up, bro?"

29
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,780
Everybody's "bro,"
no matter who I'm talking to.

30
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,490
"Hey, Anj, how was the movie last night?"

31
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,326
"Bro.

32
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,577
Bro, it was so good.

33
00:03:04,702 --> 00:03:06,579
Seriously, Mom, you should see it."

34
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,668
So good.

35
00:03:11,876 --> 00:03:13,795
Or, like,
if somebody gives me a compliment,

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,047
I usually just say,
"Oh, thank you," right?

37
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:19,801
But sometimes I'm like,
"Oh, for real? That's wassup."

38
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,180
"That's wassup."

39
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:26,266
Who says "That's wassup"?

40
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:28,852
I'll tell you. Boys, lesbians and me.

41
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,356
That's wassup.

42
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:37,652
I am married, though.
Uh, to a man, to clarify.

43
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:41,114
Um, and here's the thing.
My ring is fancy, right?

44
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:45,952
My ring is fancy, but I'm not fancy, okay?

45
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,578
I mean, like, my chandeliers?

46
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:51,791
These are some fancy chandeliers,
but I rented those.

47
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,585
I mean, like, I'm not fancy.

48
00:03:54,836 --> 00:03:57,047
This is how fancy I am not,
you guys, okay?

49
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,216
I live in Los Angeles,
so every now and then

50
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,344
I have to go to these, like,
red carpet Hollywood events

51
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:04,054
where you get dressed up all nice

52
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:07,098
and you walk the red carpet
and they take pictures of you

53
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:10,435
and they go,
"Anjelah, who are you wearing?"

54
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,479
"Oh, uh... Forever 21!"

55
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:23,240
"I got these at Claire's right here."

56
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,995
"They're gold, but now
they're like rose gold."

57
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,921
I'm not fancy.

58
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:40,424
Even on planes.
I'm not fancy on planes, you guys.

59
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,300
Like, my husband and I
just flew to Europe.

60
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:46,054
And we flew first-class,
but it was like a fancy first-class

61
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,514
where, like, everybody got
their own private, individual,

62
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,059
like, spaceship-type seat

63
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,478
and there was all kinds
of buttons everywhere.

64
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,149
So I was a little confused at first.
I was like, "Wait a minute. Uh...

65
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,776
am I flying the plane?"

66
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,910
"Uh, excuse me.

67
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,828
Um...

68
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,164
I didn't do real good in school."

69
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,296
And, like, all I wanted to do
was lean my chair back a little bit

70
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,214
so I could relax while
I was watching my movie, right?

71
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:24,468
So I'm trying to find
the "lean back a little bit" button.

72
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:28,138
"Okay, that's it right here.

73
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,848
That's good."

74
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,896
"I'm laying down.

75
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:41,067
I'll just sit up. It's fine."

76
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:59,836
"This how rich people sit?"

77
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,173
It was fancy.

78
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:06,134
And they had hundreds of movies
for us to choose from, right?

79
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,345
We were going to Europe,
so I wanted to be prepared

80
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,305
for all I was about to experience there.

81
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:13,016
So I decided to watch the movie, <i>Taken.</i>

82
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,313
It's a good movie.

83
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:24,361
At one point, I leaned over to my husband.
I was like, "Uh, babe...

84
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:27,030
don't get taken."

85
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,575
"'Cause I ain't gonna
be able to find you."

86
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,495
Serious, this guy is so smart...
Liam Neeson.

87
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,663
He's, like, the smartest guy in the world.

88
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:38,833
You guys, if you ever hear
about me getting kidnapped,

89
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,962
don't call the police.
Call Liam Neeson, please.

90
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:47,300
This guy is solving crimes
from across the world on the phone.

91
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:48,885
On a flip phone.

92
00:06:51,388 --> 00:06:53,139
He don't got a data plan, nothin'.

93
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,311
He's gonna figure it out.

94
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:01,272
Talking about,
"Is the wind blowing to the east?"

95
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,776
"Uh, which way the east, Liam Neeson?"

96
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,283
If I ever meet Liam Neeson in person,

97
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,827
I think I'm just gonna start crying...

98
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:17,121
'cause that means that he found me.

99
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,222
Told all our friends
we were going to Europe, right?

100
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,681
They started warning us right away.

101
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,518
Like, "You're going to Europe?
Watch out for gypsies."

102
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:40,353
I'm like, "Gypsies?

103
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,355
What's 'gypsies'?

104
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,940
Like Egyptians?"

105
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,778
"Are they mad at us?
Did we do something to them?"

106
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,156
They're like, "No, gypsies.

107
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:54,200
They will rob you and take
all your stuff, right?

108
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,953
They got all kind of gypsies.
They got old lady gypsies,

109
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,622
little kid gypsies,

110
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,873
sneaky squirrel gypsies."

111
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,753
My road manager Lauren,
she used to live in Europe,

112
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:08,256
so she even told me...
She was like, "Okay, listen.

113
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,550
If a woman comes up to you

114
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,262
and throws her baby at you,
don't catch it."

115
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:21,478
I'm like, "Just let the baby fall?"

116
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,813
She's like, "Yeah, 'cause
as soon as you catch her baby,

117
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,773
all her gypsy friends are gonna
stick their hands in your purse

118
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,858
and your pockets and take all your stuff."

119
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,903
I'm like, "Da-a-a-ng!

120
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:33,156
Well, that's dedication."

121
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:40,037
Shoot, at that point I think
she kind of earned my stuff.

122
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,790
Right? 'Cause, like, if you're
throwing your baby at someone,

123
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:46,336
that's straight dedication
to the game right there.

124
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:48,004
Respect.

125
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,552
Right? 'Cause, like, if she's
gonna throw her baby at me,

126
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:57,347
she's gonna trust that, one,
I'm gonna catch her baby, right?

127
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,932
And that, two,
I'm gonna give her baby back.

128
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,727
You know what I'm saying?

129
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,688
'Cause, like, what if she throw
her baby at me and I miss?

130
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,524
Now her baby on the floor
with a concussion.

131
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,109
Right?
Or what if she got a really cute baby

132
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:12,820
and I don't want to give it back?
You know what I mean?

133
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,531
Like what if it's a half-Black,
half-Asian baby?

134
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,282
I'm gonna keep that one.

135
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,918
But now I have the upper hand
in negotiations, right?

136
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,671
Like, "Oh, you want your baby back?

137
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,089
Now you want your baby back.
Give me my iPhone."

138
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,093
"You can keep my wallet.
I'll cancel my credit cards.

139
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,763
I need my phone book contacts."

140
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:40,557
'Cause I don't know
anybody's phone number by heart.

141
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,600
You guys know people's
phone number by heart?

142
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,228
No, right? Like, I know nobody...

143
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,313
my mom, my husband...
nobody's phone number.

144
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,566
If I'm in an emergency situation
and people are like,

145
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:52,402
"Hurry, give us your mother's phone number
so we can call her,"

146
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,738
I'd be like, "Okay. It's 'Mom.'"

147
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:00,910
"Right. What's her phone number?"

148
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,329
"M-O-M."

149
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,211
Let's just hope they don't ask me
for my husband's phone number.

150
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,962
"Hurry, give us
your husband's phone number."

151
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:14,090
"Okay, it's Pooky Boo Lover Buns."

152
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,056
By the time we landed, I was hyped.

153
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,434
Like, I was ready to fight somebody.

154
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:27,353
Right? Every time I saw a baby,
I was flinching.

155
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,191
Just, like, punching random strangers
for no reason.

156
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,406
I'd just finished watching <i>Taken.</i>
I think everybody's trying to kidnap me.

157
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:39,490
We were checking in at the hotel.

158
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:42,368
The guy at the front desk, he was nice.
He was like, "Welcome.

159
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,829
Would you like some help
with your bags up to your room?"

160
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,290
I was like...
"No, gypsy."

161
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:52,962
"Hmm, nice try."

162
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,131
Our first stop was Rome, Italy.

163
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,800
It was awesome, you guys.

164
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,554
We went to the Forum,
the Vatican, the Colosseum.

165
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,808
And, like,
this trip really made me realize

166
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,351
that I should have paid attention
in school.

167
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:11,105
For real, 'cause, like,
all I kept thinking was,

168
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:14,442
"Man, if I didn't cut class
all throughout high school,

169
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,069
I would probably be having fun right now."

170
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,072
I mean, but it was still cool.

171
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:23,033
Even if you're not a history buff,
like, it was still pretty amazing.

172
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,870
Like, 'cause I was standing there
in front of the Colosseum,

173
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,038
just really, like, almost emotional,
'cause I'm like,

174
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,751
"Dang, I cannot believe that,
like, right here, years ago,

175
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:35,296
is where they filmed
the movie, <i>Gladiator."</i>

176
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,756
You know what I'm saying?
Like, Russell Crowe

177
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,634
could've been right here.

178
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:42,512
Poof!

179
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:50,854
After that, we took
an 11-hour train ride to Paris.

180
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,315
Let me tell you,
an 11-hour anything is terrible.

181
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,026
To anything, like, even a massage.

182
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,529
Everybody likes a massage.
Go for an hour, maybe two hours.

183
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:02,448
But 11 hours, your skin gonna fall off.

184
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,827
And, like, I don't know
what I was thinking,

185
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,036
'cause we could've jumped on a plane

186
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,830
and been there
in like five minutes, right?

187
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:11,791
But in my mind I thought
it was gonna be romantic, right?

188
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:14,669
I was like,
"Oh, let's take a train to Paris.

189
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,212
It'll be so romantic.

190
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,297
Like, there'll be a caboose in the back

191
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:20,925
where they're dancing,
wearing flapper dresses,

192
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,260
celebrating 'The War Is Over.'"

193
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,268
It's not like that.

194
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:35,231
If you've never been
on an overnight train,

195
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,982
let me just paint the picture for you.

196
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,068
I almost died that night.

197
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:43,573
The smell on this train was so bad,

198
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:47,368
it literally almost choked me to death.

199
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,120
Have you ever tried
to hold your breath for 11 hours?

200
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:55,543
I almost died. And there would've been
nobody to charge in my murder.

201
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,379
They would have been,
"Oh, my God, who killed her?"

202
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:01,298
"Smell."

203
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,092
"Smell killed her."

204
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:07,388
This is what it's like. You get
on the train, and they have cabins,

205
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,306
and there are six bunk beds in each cabin.

206
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:11,392
If you don't buy all six bunk beds,

207
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,853
they just stick some rando
in there with you.

208
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:15,646
So good luck, okay?

209
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,440
So this is what it's like.
We get on the train,

210
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:19,442
and in the first cabin
there's a Chinese family,

211
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,819
then there's a Haitian family,
then there's us Americans,

212
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:23,487
and then there's, like, an Italian family,

213
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,114
then a French family.

214
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,324
Like, there's just all kind
of different people, right?

215
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,994
Like, it's kind of like a buffet.

216
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,245
Go with me for a second.

217
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,330
Like, you know how sometimes
you go to a buffet

218
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,374
and they got the seafood
and the Italian food,

219
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,794
and then they got the Chinese food
right next to the barbecue?

220
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,670
And you're like,
"Wait, that's too many smells.

221
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:42,172
I can't figure it out."

222
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,719
It was kind of like that, except it was
like a two-week-old buffet.

223
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,097
Yeah, it wasn't fresh.

224
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,896
And, like, I'm not really a diva, okay?

225
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,857
I don't consider myself a diva,
but that night, it was questionable.

226
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,570
'Cause, like, I just kept trying to
find somebody that worked on the train.

227
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:06,990
Like, "Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Um...

228
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:11,410
can you point me into the direction
where passengers can breathe?"

229
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:18,334
"Yeah, similar to this,
but preferably unscented."

230
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,463
"Oh, this is the only section?

231
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:25,174
Oh, okay...

232
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:29,679
'cause we bought a first-class ticket

233
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,599
and it's not really a first-class smell."

234
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:44,986
"Okay."

235
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,863
"Just go back to my seat? Okay, thanks."

236
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,826
I felt like I was being
human-trafficked into Paris.

237
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,870
I kept looking for Liam Neeson.

238
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,414
I couldn't find him.

239
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:00,084
When we got to Paris,
we went to the Louvre.

240
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,294
That's where they filmed
that movie, <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

241
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:08,258
I kept trying to reenact the scenes,
but they don't like it when you do that.

242
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,594
And the bridge that you walk across
to get to the Louvre

243
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,638
is, like, the lovers bridge, right?

244
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,598
Where you go with your lover,
you get a lock,

245
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,392
you lock it onto the bridge

246
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,268
and then you throw
your key into the river,

247
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:21,271
and it's supposed to be like
you're locked in love forever, right?

248
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:25,026
So we did that, but our lock
came with two keys,

249
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:26,276
so I threw one in the river.

250
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:30,364
I kept one in my pocket just in case
this fool act up. You know what I mean?

251
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:32,241
Don't play with me. Click.

252
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,252
It was an awesome trip.
My husband and I had a great time.

253
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:48,340
And some of you may know that my husband
is actually a Christian rapper.

254
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,384
Yes.

255
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:55,222
Uh, most of you probably didn't even know
Christian rap was a thing.

256
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:58,059
Oh, it's a thing.

257
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,770
Yeah, it's legit.

258
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:03,898
Don't get caught sleepin'
on that Christian rap game, homie.

259
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,944
His last album went
triple Pentecost platinum.

260
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:11,739
Booyah.

261
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,496
My husband is
a Christian rapper, right?

262
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,709
And I'm a Christian and I'm a comedian,
but I'm not a Christian comedian.

263
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:28,464
Let me explain.

264
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,384
I don't have jokes that are like,

265
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,055
"So Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
walk into a bar."

266
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,516
"Sinners."

267
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,692
It's not my style.

268
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:51,654
And, like, a lot of my comic friends,
they always tell me,

269
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,864
"Oh, you're so conservative."
Right?

270
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,826
And then my Christian friends are like,
"Oh, you're so edgy."

271
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,454
But, like, I just do me.
You know what I mean?

272
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,082
Like, I can't be anybody else but me.

273
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,417
Right?

274
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:09,172
Just do you and do you well.
You know what I'm sayin'?

275
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,049
Like, I'll tell you the truth.
I love Jesus, okay?

276
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,927
Yes, I do.

277
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,013
But I will punch a ho.

278
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,277
I mean, like, I don't want to.

279
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:37,241
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I don't want to fight you.

280
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,328
Like, if you're yelling at me, go ahead
and yell at me. I don't even care.

281
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,165
You wanna say some curse words at me,
say some curse words.

282
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:45,749
I don't even care.

283
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:51,047
But if you are right here...
in my face?

284
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,383
Like, if our eyelashes...

285
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,680
is braided together...

286
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,475
I will cut... you.

287
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,158
In the name of Jesus.

288
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:32,546
We're in Southern California, so there's
probably some cholos here tonight.

289
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,175
I see you, Boo.

290
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:41,638
Uh, recently I was invited
to cholo church.

291
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,646
It's kind of like regular church...
but a little different.

292
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:55,360
Right? 'Cause, like, at regular church
they're very warm and inviting.

293
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:58,488
"Hi. Welcome to Christ
For The Nations Baptist Church.

294
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,491
Come on in. Two of you? Okay.
It's your first time here?

295
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:03,953
Come sit up in the front,
closer to the anointing.

296
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:06,371
Up in the front. Two seats.
Thank you. Two seats.

297
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:08,540
Praise the Lord. Hallelujah."

298
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,135
It's a different congregation
at cholo church.

299
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,391
The people at cholo church, the Lord has
really brought them through some stuff.

300
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,311
And by stuff, I mean 10 to 15.

301
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,569
This is how the guy
was giving the announcements

302
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:40,697
when I first walked in to cholo church.

303
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,534
"Yeah, what's up, eh?
Church about to get started.

304
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,536
I'm gonna have to ask y'all
to take your seats.

305
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:49,665
If you don't have a seat,
one will be appointed to you."

306
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,419
"Yeah, what's up, eh?
You need some seats in the back?

307
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:57,298
You need some seats? <i>Sabes que,</i>
come right here in the front."

308
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:59,549
"Come right here in the front.

309
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,135
What I say?

310
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,806
Why you acting all scared for?"

311
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:13,689
"Uh, you're pointing at me
with your hand shaped like a gun.

312
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,359
It's literally a handgun."

313
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,782
But this church was legit, though.
I gotta give 'em that.

314
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,575
They were straight-up.
They were legit.

315
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:29,621
Like, when I say you could
see Jesus on him, I mean literally,

316
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:33,209
'cause he had Him tattooed right here.

317
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,211
Straight dedicated.

318
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,429
My husband and I
been married for three years.

319
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,348
Thank you.

320
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:51,643
I'm learning a lot, you guys.

321
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm learning about marriage,
I'm learning about my husband.

322
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:58,401
One thing I learned
about my husband is that, um...

323
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,277
he's not real handy.

324
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:05,532
Like, he don't really like
to fix stuff around the house.

325
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:09,203
It's not that he doesn't like to,
it's just that he can't.

326
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:14,750
And, like, to me, a guy
who could fix stuff, like, that's hot.

327
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,543
Any ladies in here agree that's hot?

328
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:19,213
Right?

329
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,298
That's hot.

330
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:23,759
Like, you could be
real ugly in the face...

331
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:29,890
...but if you could fix my plumbing...

332
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:32,268
...and rewire some cables...

333
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:34,186
...ooh, girl, that's hot.

334
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,815
My poor husband.

335
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:44,529
He cannot fix an appliance
to save our lives. I'm serious.

336
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:50,411
If our lives depended on my husband
fixing the microwave clock

337
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:51,745
for daylight savings...

338
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,166
...we are gonna die.

339
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:02,756
But it's okay,
'cause you know what?

340
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,260
What he lacks in handiness,
he makes up for in actual hotness,

341
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,345
'cause he's real purty.

342
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:11,974
Don't hate.

343
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,685
He's real good-looking.

344
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,396
He's, like, way better-looking than me.

345
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,148
Like, in our relationship,

346
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,191
I'm the one with the good personality.

347
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,825
Another thing I've learned
about my husband is, uh,

348
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,995
we don't really like
the same sexy-time music.

349
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:37,124
It's kind of important.

350
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,461
'Cause recently my husband,
he's trying to set the mood, right?

351
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,463
"I'm putting on some sexy-time music."

352
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:46,300
But to me, it sounded like a church song.

353
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,641
I said, "Uh, babe, what is this?"

354
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,519
He says, "A love song."

355
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,398
I said, "Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
it's a love song to Jesus."

356
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:06,529
"What we trying to do, get our praise on
or get our freak on? What's happenin'?"

357
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:12,826
"You trying to multitask me?
That's what you're trying to do?"

358
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,464
Listen, you guys...
I have some advice, okay?

359
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,343
Take it or leave it. Whatever you want.

360
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:37,684
If you are trying to have sexy time
while listening to Pandora,

361
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:41,355
upgrade to the commercial-free version,
please.

362
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:54,993
I mean,
'cause the last thing you want to hear is:

363
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:58,622
"Hey, girl."

364
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,167
"Are you in good hands with Allstate?"

365
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,095
Well, I was in good hands.

366
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:17,349
But now I just wanna pay some bills.

367
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:25,524
I remember our first emergency.

368
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:29,570
I had to rush my husband to the hospital
because he had kidney stones.

369
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,947
- Aww.
- I know. And I had heard a while back...

370
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:37,369
Somebody told me the most pain a man
can ever feel is kidney stones, right?

371
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,247
So, like, I'm trying to keep
that thought in my mind

372
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:44,042
as I'm looking at my husband
who is, like, hunched over in pain,

373
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,630
moaning, groaning, crying a little bit.

374
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:50,715
'Cause I'll be honest, you guys.

375
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,220
There were a couple times
where I did think to myself, like,

376
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:58,515
"Mm, you need to man up."

377
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:09,109
Right?
'Cause my husband, he's over here like...

378
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,028
"Babe, it hurts! Babe, it hurts!"

379
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:14,323
And I'm just like, "Babe."

380
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,785
"What's wrong?"

381
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:22,872
"What's it feel like?"

382
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,629
"Like a cramp?"

383
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,857
"Is it like a period?

384
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,410
"Oh, you want me
to take you to the hospital."

385
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:04,414
"You're funny."

386
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:10,086
"Just grab the heating pad."

387
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:20,681
Ladies, I tried to tell him just curl up
in a ball and rock back and forth.

388
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,437
It didn't work.

389
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,565
And the thing was,
we were about to go to bed, right?

390
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,360
And I wasn't feeling well,
so I had just taken NyQuil.

391
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:38,031
So I'm trying to rush my husband
to the hospital, dozing at the wheel.

392
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:43,662
By the time we get there,
he's dying in pain, I'm intoxicated.

393
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,748
The doctor's trying
to communicate with us,

394
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:49,876
like, "Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

395
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,128
Um, who drove you guys here?"

396
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:56,007
And I was just like, "Um...

397
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:58,552
Your Honor?"

398
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,234
"Can I say something?"

399
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,198
"I drove us guys here."

400
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,536
"But I have an excuse.

401
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,995
I'm on NyQuil.

402
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,041
He's just a baby."

403
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:34,463
So they admitted us both.

404
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:38,717
It's pretty expensive.

405
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:41,678
Right now everybody's talking about
affordable health care, right?

406
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:43,722
But, for me, my health care
has always been affordable

407
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:47,892
because my cousin June
is my primary doctor. And, uh...

408
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,230
Although June has never been
to medical school before.

409
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:58,278
She works front desk at a doctor's office,
so... she hears a lot.

410
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,906
She wears scrubs to work.
I trust her.

411
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,161
Sometimes I call her for advice.
I'll be like,

412
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,163
"Hey, June, I'm really congested.
What should I do?"

413
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,998
And she'll be like,
"Okay, this is what you wanna do.

414
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,959
You want to get a cup of hot water,
squeeze a whole lemon into it.

415
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,837
One teaspoon of hot sauce,
one teaspoon of pepper.

416
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,921
It'll clear you right up."

417
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,426
I'm like, "Okay, first of all,
this prescription sounds delicious."

418
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:26,097
"I'm gonna be real honest with you.

419
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:28,851
I'm probably gonna make some extra
and eat it with chips later."

420
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:33,689
My problem was, I would take advice
from anybody wearing scrubs

421
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:36,733
just because they look
smarter than me, right?

422
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:40,904
I used to until I realized
that there's a store in the mall

423
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,198
where anybody could buy scrubs.

424
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,371
You don't have to be a doctor, you don't
have to show a license, nothing.

425
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:50,955
You just walk in,
pick your favorite color,

426
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,666
boom, Dr. Anjelah.

427
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:55,585
So I'm gonna do it, you guys.

428
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,295
I'm gonna go buy myself
some scrubs, okay?

429
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,088
I'm gonna use 'em as my pajamas.

430
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:00,883
I'm gonna sleep in them at night.

431
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,384
Then I'm gonna wake up
early in the morning,

432
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:03,886
throw on some tennis shoes,

433
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,054
run over to Starbucks
for my morning coffee

434
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,557
where everybody keeps letting me
cut in front of them in line

435
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:11,976
'cause they just assume I got off
a late-night shift at the hospital,

436
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,353
saving lives.

437
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:18,775
Yeah.

438
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,820
No, yeah, it's a genius plan,
you know,

439
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:24,948
until there's an actual
emergency at Starbucks.

440
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,326
Right? Could you guys imagine that?

441
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:31,663
Some guy at Starbucks lying
on the ground, having a seizure?

442
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:34,958
Everybody's looking at me like,
"Oh, thank God you're here."

443
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,878
Right? What am I gonna do?

444
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,881
Tell him a joke,
hope he laughs his seizure away?

445
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:44,927
This is what I would do, you guys, okay?

446
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:48,346
I would get in real low, right,
so nobody else could hear me,

447
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:53,810
and I'd just be like,
"Um... excuse me. Sir?

448
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,690
Hi."

449
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:03,904
"Okay, listen. Um...

450
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:05,906
these are just my pajamas."

451
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:10,243
"Yeah, anybody could buy them.

452
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,330
Okay, look, I'm not a real doctor,

453
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,793
but don't worry about it 'cause
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

454
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:20,003
All right, I got this.
Everybody move back, please.

455
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:22,297
Move back. I need some space.
Everybody step back.

456
00:30:22,422 --> 00:30:23,757
Okay, you call 9-1-1.

457
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:27,928
You, give me a skinny vanilla latte
and a breakfast sandwich.

458
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:32,557
You, I need a cup of hot water,
some lemon and some hot sauce, stat."

459
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:39,773
Then I'd just start saying any word
I've ever heard on <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

460
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,236
"Uh, you, uh, defibrillate
his aortic valve."

461
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,449
Another thing I've learned, being married,

462
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:53,077
is we're not always gonna see
eye to eye on things, you know?

463
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:54,370
No, we won't.

464
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,165
And like, for instance, okay,

465
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,251
there is a hierarchy
in the Latino culture.

466
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:02,879
We don't talk about it, but it's there.

467
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,882
There's all kinds
of different Latinos, right?

468
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,551
Mexican, Puerto Rican, Salvadorian,

469
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:10,679
Cuban, Colombian, Dominican,

470
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:12,597
blah-blah-blah-bian,
bleh-blah-blah-bian,

471
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:15,350
bleh-bleh-bleh.

472
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,853
All kinds of us, right?

473
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,771
And, like, my husband,
he's Puerto Rican, okay?

474
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:22,649
Any Puerto Ricans here tonight?

475
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:27,529
Hey. All seven of California's
Puerto Ricans came out tonight.

476
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:32,034
My husband, he's Puerto Rican, right?

477
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,537
So he thinks Puerto Ricans are at the top
because they have J. Lo.

478
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:40,583
All right. We get it.
Team Puerto Rico: one point.

479
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:42,961
Well played.

480
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:45,005
Me, I'm Mexican, okay?

481
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,130
Any Mexicans here tonight?

482
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:53,805
So, pretty much everybody else.

483
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,391
Okay.

484
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,852
I'm Mexican,
so I think Mexicans are at the top

485
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,479
because we have the best food.

486
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,402
These are just facts, you guys.

487
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:09,362
Google it if you want to.

488
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:13,700
We're not even, like,
the best in the Latino foods.

489
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:17,787
Like, we jumped into regular
food category. You know what I mean?

490
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,456
Like, ask any of your friends
what their favorite food is,

491
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:22,959
and nine out of ten times they're
gonna go, "Oh, uh, favorite food:

492
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:25,461
pizza, Chinese and Mexican."

493
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:27,923
They don't say Latino.

494
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:34,012
"Oh, I like Latino food.
All-encompassing Latino food."

495
00:32:34,137 --> 00:32:36,056
Nah, bro, they say Mexican.

496
00:32:37,933 --> 00:32:39,059
That's wassup.

497
00:32:42,437 --> 00:32:45,398
I mean, for the most part, people don't
even know the difference between us.

498
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:48,860
They think all Latinos eat Mexican food.

499
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:55,283
Ask any random white guy, "Hey, name
a Latino dish that is not Mexican."

500
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:57,119
"Uh, fa-jee-tahs."

501
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:02,498
No, that's Mexican. "Kay-suh-dill-uh."

502
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:07,629
No, that's also Mexican.
"Nacho Bellgrande."

503
00:33:11,215 --> 00:33:12,634
That's American.

504
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:16,972
Nice try.
Team Mexico: one point.

505
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:23,561
I may think Mexicans are at the top,
but I'm not the top Mexican.

506
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:26,773
I still don't speak Spanish.

507
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,316
I know. I wish I did.

508
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:31,069
Any other Latinos here
that do not speak Spanish?

509
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,654
Where you at?

510
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,656
See? I'm not the only one.

511
00:33:34,781 --> 00:33:36,532
Air fives.

512
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:41,121
Where the Latinos that do speak Spanish?
Where are you guys at?

513
00:33:46,209 --> 00:33:47,752
Oh, congratulations.

514
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:51,297
You're better than us.

515
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,347
I bet you put it on your résumé, too, huh?

516
00:34:02,225 --> 00:34:05,728
"Bilingual, Spanish and English.

517
00:34:05,812 --> 00:34:07,605
Happy face, happy face."

518
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:15,279
Well, good for you.

519
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,199
<i> Felicidades.</i>

520
00:34:21,703 --> 00:34:23,746
I wish I spoke Spanish.

521
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:27,500
I got Rosetta Stone.

522
00:34:27,709 --> 00:34:31,129
I've had it on my computer since 2006.

523
00:34:31,213 --> 00:34:32,588
I'm still on level one.

524
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:38,636
<i>Caballo, caballo, caballo.</i>

525
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,057
<i>Bicicletas son verdes.</i>

526
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,600
<i>Bicicletas son verdes.</i>

527
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,854
This is why I'm still
on level one, you guys.

528
00:34:47,979 --> 00:34:50,148
Every time I hear that
little computer lady say,

529
00:34:50,273 --> 00:34:53,276
<i>"Bicicletas son verdes,"</i>

530
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,197
it sounds real rhythmic, like a song.

531
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,200
<i>"Bicicletas son verdes."</i>

532
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:03,912
So I just keep pressing the button.

533
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:05,997
Over and over.

534
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:08,041
<i>Bicicletas son verd...</i>

535
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:10,085
<i>Bicicletas son verd...</i>

536
00:35:10,168 --> 00:35:11,711
<i>Bicicle... Bicicle...</i>

537
00:35:11,836 --> 00:35:13,796
<i>Bici... Bici... Bici... Bici...</i>

538
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:20,428
<i>♪ Bicicleta ♪</i>

539
00:35:25,267 --> 00:35:26,475
<i>♪ Bicicleta ♪</i>

540
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:29,645
<i>♪ Caballo ♪</i>

541
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:33,233
<i>♪ Caballo, er, er, er ♪</i>

542
00:35:33,357 --> 00:35:34,692
<i>♪ Caballo ♪</i>

543
00:35:47,455 --> 00:35:49,291
So I'm still on level one.

544
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:55,755
I'm not really learning Spanish,
but I do have a new favorite song.

545
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,009
<i>"Bicicletas Son Verdes."</i>

546
00:36:00,093 --> 00:36:01,636
<i>♪ Pa-pa pom-pom ♪</i>

547
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:14,857
A lot of times people just assume
that I speak Spanish, right?

548
00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:17,277
They'll just start saying
Spanish words at me really fast.

549
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:19,154
And I don't wanna come out
right away and be like,

550
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,364
"Whoa, whoa, wait.
I don't speak Spanish." Right?

551
00:36:21,489 --> 00:36:23,783
'Cause I'm ashamed of myself.

552
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:29,164
So what I do is I just like to go along
with the conversation as long as I can.

553
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,873
And then, like, at the end,

554
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:33,251
I just give them like
a go-to Spanish phrase like,

555
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:35,753
<i>"Ay, qué bueno."</i>

556
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:47,807
But it usually has nothing to do
with what they're talking about.

557
00:36:47,932 --> 00:36:50,226
So they're just like, "Huh?"

558
00:36:51,894 --> 00:36:54,230
<i>"Claro que sí. Claro."</i>

559
00:36:57,317 --> 00:36:58,943
"No? No <i>claro?</i>

560
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,823
Okay.
Well, I haven't learned that song yet."

561
00:37:10,872 --> 00:37:13,208
I still don't have kids.
I still don't want kids.

562
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,545
But I baby-sit a lot. I do. I baby-sit.

563
00:37:17,628 --> 00:37:19,547
My friends always ask me
to baby-sit their kids.

564
00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:22,508
The one person in the group
with no actual parenting experience.

565
00:37:24,177 --> 00:37:28,014
You know what?
I learned that kids are smart.

566
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:29,974
And by smart, I mean manipulative.

567
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,519
They know how to get what they want.

568
00:37:33,602 --> 00:37:34,896
They know how to get out of trouble.

569
00:37:35,021 --> 00:37:37,773
"I run this house."

570
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:39,901
And they do.
They run the house, right?

571
00:37:39,984 --> 00:37:41,986
Like, I was baby-sitting
my godson Elijah, right?

572
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,989
He's four years old, right?
He wouldn't eat his dinner.

573
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:47,033
I said, "Elijah, eat your dinner."

574
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:49,785
He just grabbed his food,
put it up to his mouth,

575
00:37:49,911 --> 00:37:52,872
and then he put it back down.

576
00:37:52,955 --> 00:37:56,209
I said, "Uh, Elijah, I can see you.

577
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:58,836
I'm a real person."

578
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:01,797
"You're not eating your dinner."

579
00:38:01,923 --> 00:38:03,341
He goes, "Yes, I am."

580
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,634
I said, "Elijah, I'm gonna call your mom.

581
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,511
I'm gonna tell her
you're not eating your dinner."

582
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,349
You know what he said to me?
He goes, "Okay.

583
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:13,017
Can you tell her I'm thirsty, too?"

584
00:38:15,353 --> 00:38:16,604
What a jerk.

585
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,942
I said,
"Uh, I'll tell her why I spanked you.

586
00:38:21,025 --> 00:38:22,610
I'll tell her that, huh?

587
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:25,905
Oh, your mom doesn't do spanks?
Well, she's not here, is she?"

588
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:31,286
And that was the last time I baby-sat him.

589
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,085
Yeah.
And my sister just had a baby last year.

590
00:38:39,168 --> 00:38:42,546
He's so cute, you guys.
Cutest baby in the whole wide world.

591
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:44,632
I know I'm biased because he's my nephew.

592
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,676
But then there's actual facts
that you can Google. So...

593
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,762
He's so cute, you guys.

594
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:52,098
He's half Vietnamese, half Mexican.

595
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:53,641
He's a little Vie-xican.

596
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,686
And he has the whitest name ever...

597
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,939
Austin Reed Williams.

598
00:39:01,274 --> 00:39:03,025
<i>Ay, que guero.</i>

599
00:39:06,028 --> 00:39:09,198
I know we didn't start off
very Latino with "Johnson," right?

600
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:10,950
But my brother-in-law, who's Vietnamese,

601
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:13,702
he was adopted by
an all-American white family,

602
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:15,621
and that's how he got
the last name "Williams."

603
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,333
Like, he was born in Vietnam,
they put him on a plane,

604
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,585
flew him to America, and now he's white.

605
00:39:25,214 --> 00:39:26,966
I'm serious.

606
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:32,680
He's the only Vietnamese person I know
that listens to country music,

607
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:35,683
chews tobacco and goes hunting
on the weekends.

608
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:40,646
He considers his camouflage shirt
to be his "good" shirt.

609
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:45,360
Oh, yeah, he has embraced 'Merica.

610
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:51,740
He's Vietnamese, super white,
and he married a Mexican.

611
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,617
He's all kinds of confused.

612
00:39:55,578 --> 00:40:00,416
And the crazy thing is, he speaks
better Spanish than my whole family does.

613
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,295
'Cause he works in construction
with real Mexicans.

614
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:13,137
My family's very Mexican-American, okay?

615
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:14,638
We speak very little Spanish.

616
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:17,099
My in-laws are super Puerto Rican.

617
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:19,477
They speak very little English.

618
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,521
But they try, okay? They try.

619
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,272
Like, my mother-in-law
will call me sometimes.

620
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:25,983
She'll leave me a message
on my voice mail like,

621
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:29,945
"<i>Hola, mami.</i>
It's your mother-in-law. Eh, call me."

622
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:38,580
So sweet.

623
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,624
They're super Puerto Rican.

624
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,335
Like, they should win
Puerto Rican Of The Year award.

625
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:47,380
No, they're really good at it.

626
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:51,175
Like, I don't know how they do it,
but no matter what they're talking about

627
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:55,971
in any conversation,
they can seamlessly bring up Marc Anthony.

628
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:01,143
You can have a conversation
with my father-in-law.

629
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:05,106
He'll be like, "Hey, the Yankees,
they're gonna be good this year.

630
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:08,192
But if not, it's okay. Marc Anthony,
he gonna do a special on TV.

631
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:09,944
I'll record it for you."

632
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:16,284
My mother-in-law
is very traditional, okay?

633
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:20,455
She likes to drink her Pilon coffee,
watch her stories,

634
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,874
make room on the wall for another
Puerto Rican flag somewhere...

635
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:28,546
Or coasters,
or a bath mat, or a clock.

636
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,548
Puerto Rico everywhere.

637
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,176
And she likes to keep up with us
in our busy lives, right?

638
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:37,012
So we taught her how to use
Instagram and Facebook.

639
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:38,973
I'm sorry, "Fay-book," um...

640
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:44,353
Which is great, 'cause now sometimes I'll
be going through my comments from people.

641
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:47,690
They'll be like, "Hey, love your videos.
When are you coming to Michigan?"

642
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,401
"Hey, we were at your show last night.
Had a great time."

643
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:52,528
<i> "Hola, mami."</i>

644
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:54,947
"It's your mother-in-law.

645
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,158
You look too skinny in that picture."

646
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:59,868
"Eh, call me."

647
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,040
So sweet.

648
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:11,130
Now that's she's on social media,
she loves to watch my every move.

649
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:13,215
Everything I do.

650
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,678
Like, remember when everybody was doing
the ALS ice bucket challenge? Right?

651
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:19,347
Well, I did one too, right?
So I posted it on Instagram.

652
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,140
My mother-in-law calls me the next day.

653
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:25,394
She goes,
"Anjelah, I seen you ice bucket video...

654
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,229
<i>pero </i>I didn't see no ice."

655
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:38,240
But she's really proud of us, too.
Like, she's super proud.

656
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:41,160
Like, anytime we're in a newspaper
or a magazine,

657
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:46,290
she'll cut it out, put it in a frame,
put it on the wall, right? Super proud.

658
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:50,419
And recently I noticed that she's started
printing out our Instagram photos.

659
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:58,427
So now, if you come over to my
in-laws' house and you look on the wall,

660
00:42:58,553 --> 00:43:00,804
you'll see a family portrait
from the 1980s,

661
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:07,102
a picture from my wedding day,
and my lunch from eight months ago.

662
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,230
Hashtag "foodie," hashtag "nomnom."

663
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,402
She's learning.

664
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:19,156
I'm getting older, you guys.
I'm getting older.

665
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,116
I mean, we all are.
We're all getting older.

666
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:22,951
But it's about me right now.

667
00:43:25,454 --> 00:43:28,457
I'm getting older, but I don't feel it.
I don't feel like I'm getting older,

668
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:33,045
but I am noticing myself
starting to do older things, okay?

669
00:43:33,128 --> 00:43:35,964
Like, I'm noticing, like, the questions
that I ask nowadays

670
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,342
are like old people questions.

671
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,637
Like, "What time is breakfast?"

672
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,395
"Do you accept coupons?"

673
00:43:49,604 --> 00:43:51,355
You know, stuff like that.

674
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:54,275
And, like,
my friend went to a wedding, right?

675
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:56,694
And I feel like young people
would ask questions like,

676
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:58,862
"Oh, you went to a wedding? Was it fun?

677
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:01,073
Was there an open bar?
Did you meet anybody?"

678
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:02,700
Right? Like, stuff like that.

679
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:05,494
Me, I ask questions like,
"Oh, you went to a wedding?

680
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,830
Did they let you take
the centerpiece home?"

681
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:13,377
"How about the food?
What kind of food did they serve?

682
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:15,838
Was it, like, buffet-style?

683
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,089
It's the best.

684
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:18,882
How about parking? Was it valet?

685
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:22,136
Self-park? Ugh! Brutal."

686
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:27,224
I think I'm getting older

687
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:30,436
because I'm starting to give
way too many details to things.

688
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:33,522
Right? Way too many details.
And I see my dad do that.

689
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,190
He gives way too many details to stuff.

690
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:37,401
Like I can ask my dad
a very simple question.

691
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,946
"Hey, Dad, are you coming to visit me
this weekend or next weekend?"

692
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:44,492
His answer should sound something like,
"This weekend."

693
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:48,663
Or "Next weekend."

694
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,748
No, not my dad.

695
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:53,751
No, you ask my dad that question,
this is the answer you're gonna get:

696
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:57,588
"Oh, well, hey, I requested time off
from my supervisor.

697
00:44:57,713 --> 00:45:00,549
He trying to tell me that
I didn't request the time off

698
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:05,346
when I know I did, and then here he goes
giving Diego like two weeks off.

699
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:07,931
You're not even supposed to have
two weeks at a time, right?

700
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:11,811
So I said, 'Look, I'm gonna
call my union rep, okay?'

701
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:14,563
Sometimes if you just say 'union rep, '
they get all scared.

702
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,565
So I said,
'Look, I'm gonna call my union rep.'

703
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:18,984
And then he goes,
'Fine, you can have your time off.'

704
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:23,405
But he almost didn't give it to me,
but then he did. But he almost didn't."

705
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:33,749
"So... this weekend..."

706
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,084
"...or next weekend?

707
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:38,587
Too many details, Dad.

708
00:45:39,672 --> 00:45:42,466
You're not invited anymore."

709
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:47,054
I think I'm getting older
'cause I hear people around me

710
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:50,683
say things like, "Turn down for what?"

711
00:45:52,727 --> 00:45:55,855
And then I tell them what.

712
00:45:57,231 --> 00:45:59,233
"Turn down for what?"

713
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:01,318
"Uh, it's really loud."

714
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:09,993
"Turn down for what?"

715
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:13,873
"You have work in the morning."

716
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,920
"Pshh! Turn down for what?"

717
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:22,297
"You have three kids now!"

718
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:24,759
"It is about that time.

719
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:28,095
To turn it down."

720
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,848
<i>♪ Pa-pa pom-pom ♪</i>

721
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:39,732
Anybody here ever do jury duty?

722
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:42,693
Yeah?

723
00:46:42,777 --> 00:46:44,737
I had jury duty not too long ago.

724
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:50,367
And we were one day into the trial,
and all of a sudden I was released

725
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:54,413
because apparently I am a terrible juror.

726
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,459
This what happened.

727
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,711
Um, okay, first of all,
I don't know if anybody here

728
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:05,340
has ever been to the movies
with your black friend, okay?

729
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:08,761
And your black friend
likes to talk to the movies

730
00:47:08,844 --> 00:47:11,013
like the actors can hear them.

731
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:15,392
You know what I'm saying?
Like, "Ooh, you better run!"

732
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:18,353
"He right behind you!"

733
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:23,191
He right behind you!"

734
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:29,657
"He ain't even runnin'."

735
00:47:30,574 --> 00:47:33,577
It was a similar situation
in the courtroom.

736
00:47:33,661 --> 00:47:35,037
This what happened.

737
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,498
The first piece of evidence
they put up on a screen

738
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,667
is a picture of this woman's face

739
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,461
that's just, like, beat-up,
bruised, swollen.

740
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:44,212
You can't even tell it's a woman, right?

741
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:49,635
You're supposed to see the picture,
register it, and make a mental note.

742
00:47:49,718 --> 00:47:51,720
Well, I can make a mental note.

743
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:56,266
I just have a hard time
not saying my mental note.

744
00:47:57,434 --> 00:48:03,440
So the picture comes up on the screen
and my response is: "Ooh, what?"

745
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:08,403
"Oh, hell no!

746
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:14,117
Da-a-a-ang!"

747
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,496
"That's her face?"

748
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,501
"But that's her face, though?"

749
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:28,966
"Da-a-a-ang.

750
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,262
Wait, wait, wait. Put it back up."

751
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:38,433
"Lawyer lady,
put it up real quick, please?

752
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:43,397
Oh, hell no."

753
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,274
"Uh-uh. Guilty!"

754
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:48,777
"He did it."

755
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:52,155
"That's him right there."

756
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:57,953
They don't like it when you do that.

757
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,918
Even the process to get picked
to be on a jury is terrifying, right?

758
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:06,169
And, like,
I speak in front of people for a living.

759
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:08,422
That's what I do, right?
But all of a sudden,

760
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:12,593
because I'm in a courtroom in front of
maybe 30 people, even I'm nervous, right?

761
00:49:12,718 --> 00:49:14,428
'Cause, like, the judge is talking to me,

762
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:17,431
and I'm just nervous
'cause a judge is talking to me.

763
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,016
I feel guilty for no reason.

764
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:24,271
And the judge is asking me questions like,

765
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:27,983
"Juror number 11, how do you
feel about scientific evidence?"

766
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:40,871
"Scientific evidence..."

767
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,291
"I didn't do very good in school."

768
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,754
"Uh, she said 'scientific.'"

769
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:53,592
"I feel like I should say a big word."

770
00:49:57,304 --> 00:49:58,722
"Um...

771
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:04,311
scientific evidence...

772
00:50:04,394 --> 00:50:08,398
is usually presented as factual evidence

773
00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:11,443
in cases where certain circumstances

774
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:16,031
do not provide a level of authenticity

775
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:22,329
that has been derived
through process of elimination,

776
00:50:22,412 --> 00:50:27,542
having been determined
in the petri dish..."

777
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,007
"...to show you

778
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:38,261
that, in fact, it is scientific."

779
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:48,730
"So...

780
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:52,067
yeah."

781
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:54,319
Then the judge just starts
taking notes, right?

782
00:50:54,444 --> 00:50:56,238
Two attorneys, they start writing notes.

783
00:50:56,363 --> 00:51:00,868
I'm like, "Uh, did I win that one?"

784
00:51:01,076 --> 00:51:03,245
Now it's the attorneys' turn.
Now they get to ask me questions.

785
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,000
"Juror number 11, earlier you said that
scientific evidence was usually correct.

786
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,169
I think that's what
you were trying to say.

787
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:14,381
Do you have much experience
with scientific evidence?"

788
00:51:17,885 --> 00:51:20,679
"Um...

789
00:51:20,804 --> 00:51:24,391
other than <i>Law & Order: SVU..."</i>

790
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:29,230
"...no, not a whole lot."

791
00:51:29,437 --> 00:51:32,941
Now she has to have a serious conversation
with me about a TV show.

792
00:51:33,025 --> 00:51:37,238
"In these episodes of <i>Law & Order: SVU,</i>
has there ever been a case

793
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,741
where the scientific evidence
was proven incorrect?"

794
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:44,828
"Um...

795
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:48,999
well, I haven't seen every episode..."

796
00:51:51,418 --> 00:51:52,878
"...but there was this one time

797
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:54,963
where Jennifer Love Hewitt
was guest-starring.

798
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:56,965
And she did a good job.
I thought she did real good.

799
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:59,134
It was like a new role for her.
It was real serious.

800
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,096
She had to cry a lot,
so I thought she did good.

801
00:52:02,221 --> 00:52:04,472
Anyway, there was this guy.
He would follow her to work every day

802
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:07,184
since she was like 16 years old,
but he would rape her all the time,

803
00:52:07,268 --> 00:52:09,436
like every day, every day,
every day, every day, every day.

804
00:52:09,644 --> 00:52:11,688
And like, first of all,
I don't know how she didn't see him,

805
00:52:11,813 --> 00:52:15,442
'cause even I saw him
right at the beginning of the episode.

806
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,403
I was like,
'Yeah, that's him walking right there.'

807
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:24,409
But that's 'cause, like, I'm real good
at figuring stuff out like that.

808
00:52:24,618 --> 00:52:29,206
Typewriter lady, don't forget to put
that I'm real good at figuring stuff out.

809
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:32,709
Anyway, they found some DNA evidence,
and they couldn't connect it to him,

810
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:34,586
so then he got to go home."

811
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:39,133
"So do you still feel that
scientific evidence is usually correct?"

812
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:45,973
"Ohh.
I see what you did.

813
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:50,102
Wait a minute. Have I seen you
on an episode one time?"

814
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:53,814
'Cause I do watch <i>Law & Order: SVU</i>
all the time, you guys.

815
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:57,318
And it's got me thinking that
not only am I a terrible juror,

816
00:52:57,442 --> 00:53:01,029
but I'd probably be a terrible
police detective as well.

817
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:02,823
Because, like, they show
these detectives...

818
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:04,658
Olivia Benson, right?

819
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:07,953
Yeah. Detective Stabler,

820
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:09,997
Detective New Hot Latino Guy.

821
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:14,584
Right? And they show 'em in these
adrenaline-pumping situations, right?

822
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:18,046
They're chasing a perp down an alley.
All of a sudden, they trip and fall.

823
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,299
They just get back up
and start chasing him again.

824
00:53:22,509 --> 00:53:24,511
Has anybody here ever fallen before?

825
00:53:27,348 --> 00:53:31,059
It hurts... you guys.

826
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:36,606
If I trip and fall down, I'm staying down.

827
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,568
For a while.

828
00:53:40,694 --> 00:53:42,529
Rubbing my knee.

829
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:47,575
I will be the cop that calls in like...

830
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:50,078
"Officer down!"

831
00:53:50,162 --> 00:53:53,165
"Officer down."

832
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:54,624
"Are you shot?"

833
00:53:54,749 --> 00:53:59,171
"No, but I need some Neosporin!"

834
00:53:59,421 --> 00:54:02,799
"Hurry!

835
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:05,760
There's little rocks in it!"

836
00:54:17,981 --> 00:54:20,859
To be a good cop, you have to
know your north from your south,

837
00:54:20,942 --> 00:54:23,278
your east from your west.

838
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:26,031
You've seen the episodes, right?

839
00:54:27,157 --> 00:54:29,243
"Suspect's heading southbound
on First Street."

840
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:31,912
This would be my call:

841
00:54:32,037 --> 00:54:34,415
"Suspect made a left."

842
00:54:39,253 --> 00:54:41,338
"Uh, north or south?"

843
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:43,798
"Definitely not to the right."

844
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:51,848
"Uh, in which direction?"

845
00:54:51,973 --> 00:54:54,226
"Towards McDonald's."

846
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:02,984
They show 'em chasing this perp
into a dark, empty warehouse, right?

847
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,611
They have their gun out.

848
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,947
All of a sudden,
this guy just pops out of nowhere,

849
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:10,242
and their response is: "NYPD! Freeze!"

850
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:12,494
Where, like, my response would be:

851
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:14,037
Boom! "Who was that?"

852
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:26,216
But now he can't tell you who he was.

853
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:33,974
I'd probably be
a terrible 9-1-1 dispatcher.

854
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:39,771
God forbid you have to call 9-1-1...
and I answer the phone.

855
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:44,192
"9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

856
00:55:44,276 --> 00:55:46,487
There's a guy trying to get in your house?

857
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:49,990
Well, did you lock the door?"

858
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:53,660
"You didn't lock the door?

859
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:56,579
Well, that was dumb, huh?"

860
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:03,504
"I mean, like,
you don't watch movies or..."

861
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,924
"No... Yeah, no, I'm sending the cops.

862
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:10,469
They are on their way,
but it's gonna be, like, 15 minutes.

863
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:12,095
You better find a hiding spot."

864
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:17,518
"And don't get under the bed.
They always look there first."

865
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:30,322
When I first started doing stand-up,
I got kind of famous on YouTube

866
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:32,615
for this joke about getting my nails done.

867
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:54,346
Oh, you've heard it?

868
00:56:56,515 --> 00:56:58,266
It's...

869
00:56:58,392 --> 00:57:02,229
It's crazy 'cause, like,
when this video first came out,

870
00:57:02,312 --> 00:57:05,273
I had no idea it was
gonna blow up like that.

871
00:57:05,357 --> 00:57:07,359
Like, so many people have seen this video

872
00:57:07,484 --> 00:57:11,446
to the point where now I get scared
when I walk into a nail salon.

873
00:57:13,907 --> 00:57:16,034
'Cause, like, I don't
want them to recognize me

874
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:17,994
and then, like,
cut my finger on purpose.

875
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,249
But then blame it on me
like it was my fault.

876
00:57:22,374 --> 00:57:24,334
"Honey, relak your hand."

877
00:57:38,432 --> 00:57:40,183
"You want to wak your eyebrow?"

878
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:44,938
"Uh, no, thank you."

879
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,440
"Honey, you need to wak."

880
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:52,613
"I lie your eye sadow. It look nice.

881
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:54,948
Your eye sadow. Look down. Look down."

882
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,453
"I lie the sadow."

883
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:07,502
Now sometimes the girls that are getting
their nails done, they recognize me.

884
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:10,547
Like, "Hey, you're the girl
that does the nail salon..."

885
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:11,923
"Mm, no!"

886
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:15,636
"What, are you crazy?"

887
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:20,307
Right? 'Cause, like, one time
I was getting my pedicure done,

888
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:22,684
and the lady that was doing
my pedicure, she said to me:

889
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:24,519
"What your name?"

890
00:58:31,526 --> 00:58:35,530
And it wasn't like
your typical friendly greeting, like:

891
00:58:35,614 --> 00:58:38,866
"Hi, honey. How you do?

892
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,286
How you mom?"

893
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:44,205
It was different.

894
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,500
It was very like:

895
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,085
"What your name?"

896
00:58:54,257 --> 00:58:57,594
I said, "Anjelah." And she goes,
"That what I thought."

897
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:03,099
"Oh, shoot.

898
00:59:03,224 --> 00:59:05,226
Vietnamese people have YouTube."

899
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:09,147
I started getting all nervous.

900
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:11,316
She could tell I was getting
a little uncomfortable,

901
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:14,110
so she goes,
"Don't worry, I don't tell nobody."

902
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:16,946
"Oh, thank you."

903
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,115
Besties!

904
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:24,954
People always ask me, like,
"How'd you learn to do that accent?

905
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:26,956
Who taught you how to do that?"
Right?

906
00:59:27,123 --> 00:59:30,251
Well, I grew up in a place
called San Jose, California.

907
00:59:32,546 --> 00:59:34,797
It's the Bay Area's Westminster, okay?

908
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:39,302
So I grew up eating pho.
Do you guys eat pho?

909
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,014
Right? So I grew up eating pho.

910
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:46,976
And I would put all kind of chili sauce
in my pho...

911
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:50,813
'cause I'm Mexican.

912
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:52,482
So I put all kind of chili sauce
in my pho,

913
00:59:52,649 --> 00:59:55,151
and the lady that worked there,
she would get mad at me

914
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:58,821
'cause she thought I was just
playing around and wasting all her sauce.

915
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:00,574
So she would yell at me.
She'd be like:

916
01:00:00,782 --> 01:00:03,243
"Don't put the too mut the sah!"

917
01:00:11,752 --> 01:00:15,672
"If you put the too mut the sah,
you met the whole thing up."

918
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:22,053
"If you do the sah, you do the one tam."

919
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:26,433
"You do sah, no sah."

920
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:29,644
"Sah, no sah."

921
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:34,357
"Mah-mah say, mah-mah sah,
mah sah, no sah."

922
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:46,994
"If you met the whole thing up,
you don't get to take back."

923
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,601
"She don't get to take back!"

924
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:25,116
And when that joke first came out,
a lot of people loved it, right?

925
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,788
But some people hated it... and I started
getting hate mail from people.

926
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:30,705
Aww.

927
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:33,291
Yeah. Like, I would get a letter.

928
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,002
And you could tell it was
written by a Vietnamese person.

929
01:01:38,212 --> 01:01:40,173
'Cause, like, I would read
a letter and it'd be like...

930
01:01:40,298 --> 01:01:42,676
"If I see you in the street..."

931
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:47,555
"...you don't want that to happen."

932
01:01:56,356 --> 01:01:59,317
Oohhh!

933
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,945
Then it started getting real crazy, right?
I started getting death threats.

934
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,823
One time after a show,
this Vietnamese guy,

935
01:02:04,947 --> 01:02:08,869
he was so mad at me,
he yelled at me, he cussed at me.

936
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:10,704
But he didn't cuss correctly.

937
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:14,875
He come up to me real mad.
He was like...

938
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:17,043
"What the fut?"

939
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:23,383
Real mad. F-U-T.

940
01:02:25,635 --> 01:02:27,804
"What the fut?"

941
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,519
I was like, "Mm, sir,
I don't even know if that counts."

942
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:36,563
I'm Anjelah Johnson.

943
01:02:36,646 --> 01:02:39,065
Thank you guys so much
for coming out to my show.

944
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,901
I appreciate you.

945
01:02:41,067 --> 01:02:43,069
I love you.

946
01:02:43,152 --> 01:02:46,113
Thank you so much. Have a good night.

947
