He wouldn't have taken it
to the authorities.

1163
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:20,484
He would have circulated it
at parties.

1164
01:35:22,497 --> 01:35:26,490
Success is fragile,
Mr. Ledbetter.

1165
01:35:28,503 --> 01:35:32,496
Do you know what it is
to have a muse?

1166
01:35:37,512 --> 01:35:41,516
I think I do.

1167
01:35:41,516 --> 01:35:44,519
Joey was nothing like him.

1168
01:35:44,519 --> 01:35:48,523
But sometimes,
if the light was just right,

1169
01:35:48,523 --> 01:35:52,516
I could almost believe.

1170
01:35:53,528 --> 01:35:56,531
[ Sighs ]

1171
01:35:56,531 --> 01:36:00,524
I guess I'll have to
fiind another one.

1172
01:36:10,545 --> 01:36:13,548
Look at you.
Drunk as a skunk.

1173
01:36:13,548 --> 01:36:17,541
Oh, but I put a nick
in Stuyvesant's armor.
[ Laughs ]

1174
01:36:18,553 --> 01:36:22,557
Stuyvesant?

1175
01:36:22,557 --> 01:36:24,559
Haven't you
fiigured it out yet, baby?

1176
01:36:24,559 --> 01:36:26,561
Don't you know
what killed Scotty Gates?

1177
01:36:26,561 --> 01:36:30,554
Not Stuyvesant,
not Stuyvesant's
no-face slaves,

1178
01:36:31,566 --> 01:36:33,568
just craziness.

1179
01:36:33,568 --> 01:36:36,571
That's what makes
all these victims.

1180
01:36:36,571 --> 01:36:39,574
None of your fancy demons,
just plain ol',

1181
01:36:39,574 --> 01:36:43,567
run-of-the-mill
craziness.

1182
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:49,573
That's the only beast
you have to tame.

1183
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:57,592
Rom.

1184
01:36:57,592 --> 01:37:01,596
I liked what you played,
up at the party.

1185
01:37:01,596 --> 01:37:04,599
Little raw,
little rusty,

1186
01:37:04,599 --> 01:37:08,592
but it was good to hear.

1187
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:13,608
You have a beautiful face.

1188
01:37:13,608 --> 01:37:17,601
In a strange turn of events,
police were aided
by a homeless man,

1189
01:37:18,613 --> 01:37:22,606
Romulus Ledbetter, who resides
in a rocky enclosure
in Inwood Park.

1190
01:37:23,618 --> 01:37:26,621
Ledbetter, known to locals
as "The Caveman, "

1191
01:37:26,621 --> 01:37:30,625
was instrumental
in the capture and arrest
of Joseph Peasley,

1192
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:33,628
who is suspected of murdering
Scott Gates.

1193
01:37:33,628 --> 01:37:37,632
Gates'body was found
in the same park
on Valentine's Day.

1194
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:41,625
A police spokesperson
stated that "The Caveman"
is a local hero.

1195
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,633
[ Gasps ]

1196
01:37:54,649 --> 01:37:58,642
Daddy.

1197
01:37:59,654 --> 01:38:03,647
I wanted to warn you.

1198
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:09,664
You know, you could
come home for awhile.

1199
01:38:09,664 --> 01:38:12,667
I mean, if you wanted to.

1200
01:38:12,667 --> 01:38:16,660
I don't think Mama would mind.
You know, just--

1201
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:22,677
just for awhile.

1202
01:38:22,677 --> 01:38:26,681
Y-You know, Lulu,
I don't think so.

1203
01:38:26,681 --> 01:38:29,684
Maybe some other time.

1204
01:38:29,684 --> 01:38:32,687
Thanks just the same.

1205
01:38:32,687 --> 01:38:36,680
[ Sighs ]

1206
01:38:39,694 --> 01:38:43,687
Daddy, I want you to know...

1207
01:38:45,700 --> 01:38:49,693
I am really--
[ Sighs ]

1208
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:58,713
I'm proud.

1209
01:38:58,713 --> 01:39:02,706
[ Sniffles ]

1210
01:39:03,718 --> 01:39:07,711
I'm proud of you.

1211
01:39:08,723 --> 01:39:12,716
