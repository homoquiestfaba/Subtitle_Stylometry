00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,641
Exactly what you said
about Morristown and Osgood.

166
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,327
This one's different. It's not following
the pattern. It's growing faster.

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,527
It's growing faster.

168
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,889
Every storm chaser
this side of Hawaii is going to Riverside.

169
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,771
Which, by the way,
is where I think we should go.

170
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,928
But you want us to go where? Silverton?

171
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,841
If you would like, consider this
an instinct thing instead of a data thing.

172
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,726
If you heard that,
then you also heard that Steve cut us off.

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,002
- And it's on my dime now.
- I heard that.

174
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,288
This is months on the road.
And guess what.

175
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,603
We got nothing you can't get on YouTube.
Worst season I've ever had.

176
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,201
You think this is instinct. I think it's data.

177
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,330
The fact is,
it's neither without a big fat dose of luck.

178
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,724
And there is nothing I can do about that.
Okay?

179
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,486
So back off of me.

180
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,371
I just want you and your data
to find me a goddamn tornado.

181
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,887
Then Silverton's our best chance.

182
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,967
What do you think?

183
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,249
She's the one with all the degrees.

184
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,846
My money's on her.

185
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,210
Silverton it is.

186
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,530
You better be right about this.

187
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,047
- It's your last chance.
- Wow.

188
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,727
REEVIS: Yeah, okay. Hang on. Okay. It's okay.

189
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,325
All right. We recording?

190
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,561
- We're good?
- You ready?

191
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,920
- Hell, yeah, man!
REEVIS: - Yeah! Get fired up!

192
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,440
- I'm ready!
REEVIS: - You ready for this shit?

193
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,040
DONK: Maybe we should get some girls
to watch this stunt, huh?

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,881
REEVIS: That's what I'm talking about.
Get fired up! Let's go for real! It's go time!

195
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,008
- Let's go, let's go!
- Safety first.

196
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,970
Okay, just do a test run first, all right?
Move, jackass!

197
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,482
DONK: - Get out of the way. Here we go.
- Come on. Yeah. You got it, buddy.

198
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,640
REEVIS: - Come on, buddy!
MAN 1: - Come on, Donk! Let's go, boy!

199
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,683
He's gonna check the speed on this one.

200
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,851
MAN 2: Yeah! Do it, Bro!

201
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,764
- Let's go!
- Test drive!

202
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,490
Let's go for the test drive!

203
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,125
MAN 2: There you go, Donkie!

204
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,886
Well, that looked pretty good to me.
What do you think?

205
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,166
Eh.

206
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,482
What? You wanna
nail some tail or what, dog?

207
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,689
- I'm always up for nailing tail!
REEVIS: - That's what I'm talking about.

208
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,605
Once this hits the Internet, you'll
be beating them off with a stick.

209
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,889
- Fours? Fives? All kinds?
- I'm talking fives, sixes.

210
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,451
Fives, for sure. Come on!

211
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
DONK: - Bam!
- Trust me, buddy!

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,889
Yeah! All right! Hang on.

213
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,765
- Richie! Record this, son.
REEVIS: - Are you drunk?

214
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,800
RICHIE: - Yeah.
REEVIS: - I'm just getting started.

215
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,247
RICHIE: Hang on! Wait!
We're gonna light the pool on fire.

216
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,520
- Light that thing, Richie!
REEVIS: - Yeah! Light it up!

217
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,886
Light that puppy up.

218
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,087
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

219
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,322
The Flaming Pool of Death!

220
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,847
You ready to go?

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,367
Let's do this!

222
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,601
Action!

223
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,762
That's right! Come on, Donk!
You got this!

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,206
Oopsie daisy!

225
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,762
(ALL WHOOPING)

226
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,649
- That was awesome. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

227
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,406
- Ha-ha-ha.
REEVIS: - That was awesome, Donk.

228
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,325
- A million hits, easy!
- Oh! A million?

229
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,042
- Maybe more!
- Hell, yeah, dude! We're gonna be famous!

230
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,690
(ALL LAUGHING)

231
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,842
WOMAN: - Shit, my pool!
- Dude, your mom. Your mom.

232
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,567
What the hell are you two idiots doing?

233
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,405
DONK: - I thought you were at work!
- That makes any difference?

234
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,607
REEVIS: Look!

235
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,804
- That's the <i>Titus!</i> I've seen it on TV! Come on!
- Bye, Ma!

236
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,723
Let's take a tour of the ultimate
storm-chasing vehicle, the Titus.

237
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,363
She's equipped with 24 surveillance cameras,
so we have eyes from every angle.

238
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,602
Bulletproof Lexan windows.

239
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,441
A gyroscopic stabilized camera.

240
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,807
A five-ton winch.

241
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,561
Four-millimeter solid steel armor.

242
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,281
Now, back here, we have
a mini weather center, complete with...

243
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,206
...an anemometer, humidity sensor
and potentiometer.

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,528
But the thing that makes her really special
are these grappling claws.

245
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,923
Ah.

246
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,721
They can stabilize us in winds
up to 170 miles an hour.

247
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,089
We're not going anywhere
with those suckers dug in.

248
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,970
Clear!

249
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,731
This is the culmination of my life's work.

250
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,290
JACOB: What about the turret, Pete?

251
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,205
Right. The turret is up here.

252
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,881
Which gives us a 360-degree view
of outside.

253
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,124
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that
will, when we find one of these bad boys...

254
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,203
...give us the shot of the century.

255
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,051
A sight nobody but God has witnessed:

256
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,251
the eye of the tornado.

257
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,201
That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.

258
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,725
Let's get some B roll.

259
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,408
Get shots of the claws, the instruments
on the back, panel stuff.

260
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,688
- Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?
- Got it.

261
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,689
My storm's expanding.

262
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,126
That means it's going to be really big
by the time it gets here.

263
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,566
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

264
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,004
Hey.

265
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,043
How's my bug?

266
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,842
Well, listen, um...

267
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,044
I know I was gonna try
and make it home this weekend...

268
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,602
...but we got a real big storm coming,
and Mama's gotta work.

269
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,604
No. No. I'm gonna need you to tell Grandma
and Grandpa that we're...

270
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,804
I know.

271
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,440
I know, sweet girl. I'm sorry.

272
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,970
I'm really sorry.

274
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,241
Grace...

275
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,282
Hey, hey.

276
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,201
Did you get all that?

277
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,686
TOM: We can't postpone this, Gary.
There's not enough room inside for everyone.

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,162
- The weather's gonna be fine.
GARY: - It's your call.

279
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,210
DONNIE: There's Dad taking shit
from Principal Walker.

280
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,640
GARY: I will do that.

281
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,043
DONNIE: Did you get the last of the interviews?

282
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,287
I still got a few to do.

283
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,809
But what I did get was a nice shot
of Miss Bell's cleavage. Wanna see?

284
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,007
DONNIE: Trey.

285
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,124
What? You don't get many teachers
with a rack like that.

286
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,090
Cut it out. We need to start editing
right after graduation.

287
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,561
Dad wants the clips online
by the end of next week.

288
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,041
What's the point of doing
a video time capsule?

289
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,567
Video won't even exist in 25 years.

290
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,445
What? Let's just get it finished. Okay?

291
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,681
Fine.

292
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,323
Did you see the weather report?
Supposed to be a big storm coming.

293
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,005
Maybe they'll cancel the whole...

294
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,764
Whoa. There's your girl.

295
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,163
If I don't get it by the end of the day,
you'll not get the internship.

296
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,560
It's as simple as that.

297
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,770
TREY: Oh, dude. Now's your chance, man.
Vulnerable girl.

298
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,924
Comforting guy. Right?
Just go talk to her and see if she's okay.

299
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,401
- We have work to do.
- Chickenshit. Come on.

300
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,246
I need to get the last of the interviews,
and Dad's, like, on my case about it.

301
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,405
Screw Dad.
Go do something for yourself for once.

302
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,565
Bro, I am literally begging you.
Just go talk to her.

- Stop.

I gotta film this train wreck.

310
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,041
TREY: And he's pulling into the station.

311
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,850
Hey, Kaitlyn?

312
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,931
Hey.

313
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,445
It's Donnie.

314
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,045
Yeah. I know.

315
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,004
TREY: Strike one.

316
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,727
Are you okay?
I saw you outside with Miss Blasky.

317
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,928
Right. Uh...

318
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,968
I had this application for an apprenticeship,
and it had to be submitted by the weekend.

319
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,569
And Miss Blasky checked it for me,
and it's just completely corrupted.

320
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,961
I don't know what happened to it.

321
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,482
It was fine yesterday.

322
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,126
Yeah. Yeah, that's toast. What was it about?

323
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,930
The abandoned factory on Garner.

324
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,764
DONNIE: - Oh, the paper mill?
- Yeah.

325
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,081
DONNIE: Yeah.

326
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,528
When they shut it down,
the state never paid for an official cleanup.

327
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,048
So there's all these chemicals
and hazardous materials sitting there...

328
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,523
...contaminating the soil
and probably running off into the water.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,810
- That's what the film's about.
