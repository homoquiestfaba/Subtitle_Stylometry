1
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,600
<i>I was lucky. I came from</i>
<i>the most beautiful place on Earth...</i>

2
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
<i>... where music was everywhere.</i>

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>And people believed</i>
<i>there was no difference...</i>

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
<i>...between being awake</i>
<i>and dreaming.</i>

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,400
<i>My dream was always clear.</i>

6
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
<i>For as long as I could remember,</i>
<i>I wanted to be a musician.</i>

7
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
<i>That's my mother.</i>

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,600
<i>She's the one who taught me</i>
<i>how to sing.</i>

9
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
<i>That's me.</i>

10
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,200
<i>Whenever I heard her voice, all</i>
<i>I wanted was to be held in her arms...</i>

11
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,600
<i>...so I could be closer</i>
<i>to the source of the magic.</i>

12
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,200
<i>When my mother suddenly died...</i>

13
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,200
<i>...I felt like everything around me</i>
<i>had died too.</i>

14
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
<i>I couldn't feel anything anymore.</i>

15
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,600
<i>The only thing that kept me going</i>
<i>were the letters from Uncle Alfonso.</i>

16
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,200
<i>He'd gone to Los Angeles and made</i>
<i>it big in the restaurant business.</i>

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,800
<i>He said the streets really were paved</i>
<i>with gold if you worked hard enough.</i>

18
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>I didn't know what to do, so I asked</i>
<i>my grandfather, a very wise man...</i>

19
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,600
<i>... what he thought. And he told me</i>
<i>that all of life is a dream...</i>

20
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
<i>...and I should choose my dreams</i>
<i>carefully...</i>

21
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
<i>...because they're</i>
<i>very powerful things.</i>

22
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,400
<i>So I set off to chase my dream:</i>

23
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
<i>Los Angeles, City of Angels.</i>

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
<i>And my future? Well, yet to unfold.</i>

25
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
<i>Who would've thought</i>
<i>I'd end up like this?</i>

26
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
<i>It turned out that Uncle Alfonso</i>
<i>wasn't the taco king of L.A.</i>

27
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
<i>He didn't even own the place.</i>

28
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
<i>But he was the assistant manager</i>
<i>and he did get me this job...</i>

29
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,800
<i>...so I shouldn't complain,</i>
<i>but I can't take those hats.</i>

30
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,600
Here she comes. Okay.

31
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
-Hi.
-Hello. What can I do for you?

32
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
I'll have a Happy Burrito combo
with extra cheese.

33
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,200
<i>That's Nina, the love of my life. And</i>
<i>she doesn't even know that I exist.</i>

34
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Okay. Happy Burrito
with extra cheese.

35
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
-To go.
-To go. Absolutely.

36
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,200
Hi there, baby doll...

37
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
...angel...

38
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
...precious...

39
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,200
...beautiful pussycat.

40
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,200
When you look at me...

41
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
...you kill me.

42
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
You make me chase my tail in circles.

43
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,000
Okay, that's going to be 3.75.
And I'm really sorry about him.

44
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Yeah, whatever. That's 3...

45
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,200
...and that's 4.

46
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,600
-There you go. Have a beautiful day.
-Thank you.

47
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
You'll be back, pussycat. I know it.

48
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't bet on it, taco boy.

49
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Dude, you suck.

50
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
You know that women don't like
your macho comments.

51
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,800
What they appreciate is to be
spoken to with respect.

52
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,000
<i>Respeto,</i> that's what it's all about,
<i>chivo.</i>

53
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,800
What you talking about? She was hot.
Didn't you see that?

54
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,400
I'll show some <i>respeto.</i> I'll be like,
"Call me taco boy! Call me taco boy!"

55
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,800
<i>It's amazing what depths a person</i>
<i>will sink to when they get desperate.</i>

56
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
<i>But as long as I could play my music,</i>
<i>I didn't care.</i>

57
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,400
<i>Most people have forgotten about</i>
<i>the dreams that brought them here.</i>

58
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>But then again, so have I.</i>

59
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

60
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
This next song is "Lonely Girl."

61
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,200
And remember, the more you drink,
the better I sound. Thank you.

62
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
Clean this up.

63
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,400
Thank you very much.
We're gonna take a short break...

64
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,200
...and I'll be right back,
so please don't go away.

65
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Thank you.

66
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,200
Julián. Juan. Come here.

67
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
Give me a hand with the stuff.

68
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey. Wake up.

69
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
Okay.

70
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
You guys...

71
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
...are so losing your Game Boy...

72
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,400
...as soon as I get this in the house.

73
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,400
-Gonna give me a hand?
-I'll give you a hand.

74
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,800
-No, I got it. I got it.
-Please, let me help you. It's okay.

75
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
-Do you play?
-Yeah.

76
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
-And where do you live?
-I live next door.

77
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,600
Well, I hope you're not planning
on making too much noise, okay?

78
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait, wait. Let's do this right.
My name's Antonio.

79
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,000
-Hi.
-What's your name?

80
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
Mirabela.

81
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,800
-Let's get started.
-Okay, and just this one.

82
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,400
I can get the rest.
Just this one will be good.

83
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Hi.

84
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,200
I just wanted to say to you that...

85
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,400
...that I'm really sorry about my
co-worker's behaviour the other day.

86
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,200
He's just not....

87
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,800
He's not very smart sometimes.

88
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,400
-You're the guy from the taco place.
-Yeah. I'm Antonio.

89
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
-I'm Nina.
-How are you?

90
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,600
Look, I wanted to ask you...

91
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
...I don't know if you wanted to go
to dinner or dancing this Friday...

92
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,200
...I was wondering if you were
available to do me the honour?

93
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Is that a date you're asking for?

94
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,400
I think so.

95
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm flattered,
but I will have to say no.

96
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
-Because I have to work on Friday.
-Okay.

97
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm sorry. Maybe some other time.

98
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
Okay.

99
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Hey.

100
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,400
I'm gonna be there anyway,
Friday night at La Zona Rosa...

101
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
...if you....

102
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
-If you change your mind or....
-Okay.

103
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
-Bye.
-Thank you.

104
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
Who was that?

105
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I don't know. Just some guy.

106
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
What's up, uncle?

107
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,000
Antonio, look around this place.

108
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
It doesn't take all these people
to roll a burrito.

109
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
We have way too many workers.

110
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,000
We're gonna have to let someone go.

111
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Since you were the last one hired...

112
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
...l guess you have to be
the first one fired.

113
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
I can't do anything about it.
It's corporate.

114
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,600
But I'm family!

115
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm your blood!

116
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm really sorry.

117
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Here. Here's a week's pay.

118
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,000
Take it!

119
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
Take it!

120
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,600
lt'll hold you over...

121
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,800
...for a while at least,
until you find something else.

122
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
You'll be okay, Tonio.

123
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
You're young, you're strong.

124
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,600
-You'll be okay, eh?
-Sure.

125
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,000
Thanks for everything, uncle.

126
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,200
I don't know, maybe I'll go back to
Mexico. You know, I would if I could...

127
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,800
...but I can't because
I'm a total failure.

128
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah, it's a setback. So what?

129
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,600
Yeah, but nobody wants to hear
my music.

130
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,400
Girls don't wanna be with
a broke musician.

131
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
I don't know. I'm scrawny, I'm short.

132
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,200
Don't let nobody tell you
about what people wanna hear.

133
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
People get tired of being sold the
same old thing over and over again.

134
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
After a while, they look for
something real.

135
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,600
-You think?
-Yeah, that's why I took this NPR job.

136
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,600
Oh, the NPR job, right.
Because that pays the big dollars.

137
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,200
I don't know. Maybe you should
enter that contest.

138
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
What contest?

139
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
What contest?

140
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,600
It's only the largest Latino band
competition this side of Tijuana.

141
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,200
-How come I haven't heard about it?
-I don't know. But I'll tell you this:

142
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,200
The winner gets to open a concert
for a world-famous mystery musician.

143
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
You know what the top money is?
The top band wins 10,000.

144
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,400
Ten thousand dollars? Wow.

145
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,400
Ten thousand dollars.

146
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,200
Hey!

147
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,400
Antonio! Hey. Keep the noise down.

148
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Antonio! Jeez.

149
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

150
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,200
If you're gonna play music...

151
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
...then play music.

152
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
You might wanna hear something
from my collection.

153
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,600
You have a collection?
I gotta see this.

154
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Let me just see what you have.

155
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,200
-The oldies.
-That's the good stuff.

156
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
You don't have to tell me that.

157
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,400
Come on. Come inside,
we'll play them together.

158
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,600
No, thanks, I've heard them.
I gotta get back to my card game.

159
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
-Oh, yeah? What are you playing?
-Solitaire.

160
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Solitaire?

161
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,200
Oh, come on, by yourself?
Come over here, we'll play the songs.

162
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,000
José José.

163
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
You know, my father
used to play with him.

164
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
And he told me some gossip.
He said that José José's father...

165
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
...only wanted classical music
in the house...

166
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
...because he was
an operatic singer...

167
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,600
...and forbade him
to play that pop.

168
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,800
-Well...
-I want to see that.

169
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
...let's see if you know who this is.

170
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you know--?

171
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
-Okay, I don't wanna see it.
-I know how to do this, thank you.

172
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
I know that.
That's Paquita la del Barrio.

173
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Also known as
Francisca Viveros Barradas.

174
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,800
The defender of women against
<i>el macho.</i>

175
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
-She's from my hometown.
-Oh, is she?

176
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
Yeah. She sings about
getting dumped. I can relate.

177
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
Do you know who this is?

178
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
-Perfidia. Perfidia.
-Who?

179
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
That's Alberto Dominguez,
and his Xavier Cugat version.

180
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
When they told Xavier Cugat
that his music...

181
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
...was too much
middle-of-the-road...

182
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
...he said, "Well, I'd rather play
'Chiquita Banana'...

183
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,400
...and have a swimming pool
than play Bach and starve."

184
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,600
-He said that?
-Yes, he did.

185
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:01,000
-How come you know so much?
-Because I'm a geek, that's why.

186
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
What are you doing?

187
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
What are you talking about?

188
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're just incredible,
the way you sing.

189
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,400
It made the hair on my arm stand up,
look at that.

190
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,600
-You should be singing all the time.
-No, I'm too old.

191
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Yeah, okay? I used to sing.

192
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,800
But that was a long time ago.

193
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,200
With my ex, Javier.

194
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Back in Veracruz,
we had some really good times.

195
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
And then he came here,
he met some <i>pocha</i> Pop-Tart...

196
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
-...and dumped me.
-You know what...

197
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
...forget the loss, you know,
just be happy that it happened.

198
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,200
Yeah.

199
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,200
Well, I've stayed too long.
I gotta get back to my kids.

200
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,800
Enjoy the records.
And don't play them too loud.

201
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay.

202
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,000
<i>Making your intention</i>
<i>your reality.</i>

203
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,000
<i>My 10-step program for making</i>
<i>the intention...</i>

204
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,600
<i>... of creating a stress-free, tranquil</i>
<i>mind your daily experience.</i>

205
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,000
<i>Step one:</i>

206
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,200
<i>Remember that</i>
<i>your natural state is joy.</i>

207
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,000
This is El Zorro coming at you
from L.A.'s best music.

208
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,400
That's Latin America's best music.

209
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,400
Now settle back...

210
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,200
...here's a groove for you that's gonna
warm up your afternoon.

211
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
-I'm gonna have to clean that window.
-You're--

212
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Look at that. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

213
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,800
-You're gonna go back to Mexico?
-Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

214
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,600
No. I want to enter the contest.

215
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,800
-I knew it.
-What do you mean, you knew it?

216
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,400
-I knew it.
-But I gotta change my sound.

217
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
I can't be likee everybody else.
I'm not a boy anymore.

218
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
I can't do that 18-year-old,
hormone-crazed--

219
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,800
I don't know. You know what?
I like your style.

220
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,000
-Why?
-I think it's young.

221
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
-I think it's hip, it's got energy.
-You do?

222
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,400
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

223
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,200
I mean, I wanna keep
the old-school sound vibe.

224
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
I don't know.
You gotta help me find a band.

225
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Help me find some guys
I have a chemistry with.

226
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,400
I think I've got a couple of guys that
could be just the right guys for you.

227
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
Okay, we're back.

228
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Hello?

229
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
Hello?

230
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,200
Hello?

231
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,600
Hello?

232
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,400
Hello. Oh, sorry. Excuse me.

233
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
I was.... You had
a "Help Wanted" sign out there?

234
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,000
Hey, Vijay, uncle!
Someone's here for the job.

235
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,000
Raj, I'm right here.
There's no need to yell, son.

236
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,400
-So you're looking for a job, huh?
-Yes, sir.

237
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,600
You ever pump gas before?

238
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,600
No, sir.

239
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,800
Well, that's all right, because
we don't have any gas pumps.

240
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,400
Right?

241
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
You seem like a good guy.
You got the job.

242
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,000
You start tomorrow morning, 8 a.m.
Minimum wage.

243
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,400
That's okay, it's great.
I'll be here a half-hour early then.

244
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,200
-Thank you very much.
-You're very welcome.

245
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Thanks a lot.

246
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
-Sorry. Sorry about that.
-It's cool. It's all right.

247
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,800
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay. Bye-bye.

248
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,600
-Not a problem.
-Not a problem? Okay.

249
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
-Clumsy fellow, huh?
-Shit happens.

250
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,600
I like him.

251
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400
<i>Papá</i>, please eat your food.

252
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
I thought we were going out.
Why aren't you dressed yet?

253
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
I don't think I should leave him.

254
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Come on. He's gonna be fine.

255
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,600
You don't do anything anymore except
study and worry about your dad.

256
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,800
You're turning into a geek.

257
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Are you gonna be all right
without me, <i>Papá?</i>

258
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,800
Sure, <i>mija.</i> You go out and have fun.

259
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Okay, I'm gonna change really fast.

260
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,800
Come on, let's go dance.

261
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,600
-No.
-Yeah.

262
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,000
Thank God you broke me
out of my house.

263
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,600
-I know. It's about time, right?
-Yes.

264
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,200
That's him, right?

265
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
He looks super cute tonight.

266
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
-He looks super busy to me.
-What are you talking about?

267
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,800
He looks like a nice guy.
I don't think he's into her.

268
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,400
I'm very sorry.

269
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
He's breaking his neck
to get over here.

270
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,400
Excuse me. Excuse me.

271
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,800
May I have this dance with you?

272
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,800
-Can I open my eyes now?
-No, no. No, don't look.

273
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
It's worth the wait. You'll see.

274
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Almost there. Okay, here we are.

275
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
All right, you ready?

276
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,600
It looks so small.
Nothing like it feels.

277
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
You know, sometimes
when I just feel like...

278
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
...the whole city's
gonna swallow me up...

279
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,800
...and I don't want to crawl
on all fours anymore...

280
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,000
...I come up here and I feel....

281
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,800
I feel like anything
can happen up here.

282
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,400
I don't know, like I can lick the stars.
I can, I don't know, suck the moon.

283
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,000
I could be president.

284
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Oh, God, I'm weird, right?

285
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,600
What do you wish?

286
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,200
I wish that...

287
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,800
...my mother was still alive.

288
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
One day...

289
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
...I told her that...

290
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,800
...I would be the first one
in the family to be a doctor.

291
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
A veterinarian.

292
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
And I'll never forget...

293
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,000
...she smiled at me and she said:

294
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
<i>"Paloma...</i>

295
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
...you're gonna be the best...

296
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,600
...veterinarian in the world."

297
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,000
And you are. You're going to be.

298
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I know it. I feel it.

299
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
No.

300
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
Because she's gone now.

301
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,400
I know, I know.

302
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,600
Oh, my God, you're beautiful.

303
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
Inside and outside.

304
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,800
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know,
I couldn't help myself, I....

305
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
What?

306
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
Come here.

307
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
Come on, <i>Papá.</i>

308
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,200
I'll help you into bed.

309
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
<i>Papá?</i>

310
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,200
Yes, doctor.
Hold on one moment, please.

311
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
-Hi, Miss Acosta?
-Yes.

312
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,400
-I'm Dr. Lopez.
-Hi.

313
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
I'm happy to say that your father's
gonna be fine.

314
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,800
Thank you, doctor.

315
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
He had a stroke,
but it was only a minor one.

316
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,800
He's gonna need some extra care for
a while, but he's gonna fully recover.

317
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
-Can I see him now?
-Yeah, sure.

318
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,800
-Thank you.
-This way.

319
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,400
-Stop.
-I just don't know...

320
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,800
...why he left his children.
That I'll never understand.

321
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
All right, all right.
You call Child Welfare...

322
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,800
...and you report him.
That is what you do.

323
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
I can't.

324
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,400
You are not over him, are you?

325
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,200
I am so completely over
that pig of a man.

326
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,600
You know what I'm gonna do?

327
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,400
-I am gonna do a psychic reading.
-Oh, God, no.

328
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
Yes, and you're gonna love it.
That's what you need right now.

329
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,800
-And are you ready?
-No.

330
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Here we go.

331
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
There's a man nearby.

332
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
-It's giving me three clues.
-What do you mean, clues?

333
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,800
Well, so that you'll recognize him
when you meet him.

334
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,800
First, he will be
a great lover of music.

335
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,800
Oh, that's nice.

336
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,800
Second, he will cherish
the colour red.

337
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,000
He will serve you...

338
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,800
...the greatest meal
you have ever had.

339
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,200
So fabulous that
you will scream with joy.

340
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,200
Or it might be the other way around
where you're serving him the meal.

341
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,600
I don't know. But either way,
there's food involved, for sure.

342
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
When do I meet him?

343
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't know.

344
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,200
<i>Papá,</i> I was so scared.

345
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,400
Nina. Nina.

346
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,200
I thought I was gonna lose you too.

347
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Why did you even worry?

348
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,800
You know I wouldn't leave you.
Not yet, anyway.

349
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You know, Nina...

350
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,200
...I died for a minute,
and guess what.

351
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,800
I saw <i>Mamá.</i>

352
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,800
Really?

353
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,000
-How is she?
-Oh, she is doing great.

354
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,000
Beautiful as ever.
And you know what else?

355
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,600
She says she will wait for me
until it's my time to cross over.

356
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,200
And she will have a big plate
of my favourite spicy tamales...

357
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,400
...just for me, so I can
smell my way to the other side.

358
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,400
That's sweet, <i>Papá.</i>

359
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,400
Just as long as you're not planning
on having those tamales too soon.

360
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,600
<i>Mamá</i> told me it is not my time yet.

361
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,600
No, it was amazing.
He actually talked to his dead wife.

362
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,000
No, it was amazing.
He actually talked to his dead wife.

363
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, what was that...?
How did he end up...?

364
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
What was the communication
between them?

365
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,400
It was tamales.

366
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
-Tamales?
-Yeah.

367
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,200
Imagine that.

368
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Now, let's go.

369
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,800
Here we are.

370
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
They're great, huh?
Nobody knows who they are yet.

371
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,800
But they're on their way up.

372
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,200
That's Pancho on the guitar,
Enrique on the bass...

373
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,800
...and José on the drums.

374
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,600
Hey, Raj.
Raj, can I ask you something?

375
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
How long you been together
with your girlfriend?

376
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,400
My fiancée. And I've known her
for about three years.

377
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,600
Three years, huh?

378
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,200
-Raj?
-Yep.

379
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,000
How did you know
that she was the one?

380
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
First time I saw her, I knew.

381
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,000
You knew. And did she know too?

382
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,800
Are you kidding? I had to chase her
around like some crazy fool.

383
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
But you know what they say,
when a man knows, he knows.

384
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
It's black and white for us men,
no grey stuff in between.

385
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,800
Right. That's right.

386
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
Raj.

387
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
Last question.

388
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,400
How did you hook her?

389
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,000
I mean, how did you win her over?
What did you do?

390
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,200
Well, I never gave up,
but I didn't crowd her either.

391
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,800
I bought her a lot of beautiful gifts.

392
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:28,000
And most importantly, I made her
confident I'd be able to provide for her.

393
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,600
Women wanna know that a guy
can take care of her...

394
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,000
...a guy that can really
bring home the bacon.

395
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,800
I say this even though
I'm a vegetarian.

396
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,600
-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome.

397
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,600
Okay, okay.

398
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,000
Look, I hope I'm not bothering you.

399
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Look, I just want to give you
these flowers, that's all.

400
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,200
Nothing more. No, really.

401
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,600
She wouldn't believe that.

402
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,800
Dr. Lopez will be here soon
to check up on you, <i>Papá.</i>

403
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
Thank you, <i>mija.</i>

404
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Here, let me close the curtains so you
can watch your show better.

405
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,600
No, <i>mija</i>, that's okay.
I like them open.

406
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,600
Look, I'm not stalking you.
No, why would l?

407
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,600
See? It's better like this.

408
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Fuck!

409
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,600
Stop!

410
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,800
-What?
-What was that all about?

411
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,400
-What was what all about?
-You.

412
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,600
I mean, come on. The band is not
all about you and your guitar.

413
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,600
I know that, it's just
we're playing with old amps. Yeah?

414
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
You have to open them wide up
or else it doesn't sound good.

415
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,200
-You should know this.
-All right. All right.

416
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,200
Can we just break it down a little bit
so I could hear myself?

417
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,400
One, two. One, two, three, four.

418
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,400
Okay. Wait, wait. Pancho! Pancho!

419
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,400
Pancho, I thought you told me
you were cool with this setup.

420
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
You told me you were not
the lead vocalist type.

421
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,400
-I never said that, man.
-Okay. Look....

422
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,000
Look, we came here together
for the contest, all right?

423
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
And exposure is something...

424
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,800
...that each and every one of you
needs right now.

425
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,800
So let's drop the egos...

426
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,600
...and let's get out of the way
of the music, okay?

427
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,400
I don't know what's wrong
with me, man. I'm sorry, man.

428
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I don't know what happened to me.

429
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

430
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,200
We never had any trouble
before that guy came in.

431
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,000
You know what I mean?

432
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,000
I think he plays good.

433
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, yeah, I mean, the guy can play.

434
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,600
But he....

435
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,200
He doesn't have the mojo
that we need for the band, you know?

436
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,600
Yeah.

437
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,600
Look, guys, just go with me
on this one, all right?

438
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,600
-We're gonna win the $10,000--
-Thank you.

439
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,600
I got it. We're gonna win the $10,000.

440
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,600
We'll open for the mystery musician.
We'll win the whole thing.

441
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,200
-You just gotta trust me on this.
-I just want to play.

442
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,800
We all want to play.

443
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
-Let's do it.
-Come on.

444
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,000
Hi. I came to see
how the two of you are.

445
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,200
I left so many messages.

446
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,400
Hi.

447
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,200
I know. I'm sorry.

448
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,200
I haven't been able
to return your calls.

449
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,800
It's....

450
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
I've been really busy with <i>Papá.</i>

451
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,600
That's not what I meant.

452
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,800
I mean, that's why I came by,
because I wanted to help you.

453
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,400
Well, there's nothing
that you can really do.

454
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,800
I just have to be here.

455
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,800
That's why he got in trouble
in the first place...

456
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,400
...because I wasn't here for him.

457
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,400
But now is when you really need
your friends, right?

458
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
-I brought you something.
-No, I can't take it.

459
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,600
Please, please.
I want you to have it.

460
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,600
I can't. I can't be with you, Antonio.

461
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,000
Why?

462
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,000
I just can't.

463
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Please understand.
Don't make it harder on me.

464
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,600
Nina...

465
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,600
...I'm here for you.

466
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,000
X marks the place.

467
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,200
Thank you.

468
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,600
-Tonio.
-Hey.

469
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,600
I got some bad news. They just called.
They're not coming.

470
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,600
They quit.

471
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,400
-Quit?
-Yeah.

472
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,600
They want to go off on their own.

473
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,000
That's great. That's....

474
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,600
That's great.
That's a really classy move.

475
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,400
Like, three days--
Right before the tryouts!

476
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,000
I know.

477
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,400
Tonio. Tonio.

478
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,400
Come on. I'll buy you one.

479
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,400
You know-- You know why? Because
he thinks he's better than me.

480
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,800
He thinks because he went
to the right schools...

481
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,800
...he came from
a better neighbourhood....

482
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,600
Listen.

483
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,000
I hear you.

484
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,200
Thank you.
Thank you for giving me that.

485
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,600
But it's true. He always....

486
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,000
Always has all those airs.

487
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
You guys have any requests?

488
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,400
Requests?

489
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,600
What do you call yourselves?

490
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,200
Los Hermanos Solitos.

491
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,600
"The Lonely Brothers."
Why so lonely, huh?

492
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,600
-We're all single.
-We have no girlfriends, no wives.

493
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,600
No problem.

494
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,400
Right, that's how it is.
You have anything original?

495
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,200
-Want an original? You got it.
-I always want something original.

496
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,600
Javier, you wanted me to sign
the papers, I signed them.

497
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,400
That's what you wanted,
that's what you got.

498
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,800
-Just leave me alone.
-No way.

499
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,600
But, Javier, look...

500
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,600
...don't forget to be a father
to our babies, huh?

501
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,400
They need that.
You just can't drop them too.

502
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
You can't divorce your children.

503
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,000
Very good.

504
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,600
Antonio.

505
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,200
Where have you been?

506
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,200
For you.

507
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,600
-They're red.
-Yes.

508
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,400
I just wanted to thank you
for reminding me...

509
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,800
...that my world is music.

510
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Antonio, I....

511
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,200
-I don't deserve this.
-What, are you kidding?

512
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Don't ever say that. You're wonderful.
Don't doubt yourself. Here.

513
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,000
-Come in.
-Oh, no, I can't. I gotta....

514
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,800
I gotta go down to Los Lobos
and meet my new band.

515
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,200
Do you want to come with me?

516
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,800
-Oh, no. I have a lot of laundry.
-Laundry?

517
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,600
And I don't have anybody
to look after my kids.

518
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,400
Kids.

519
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,400
But....

520
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
Doesn't look like they'll notice.

521
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,000
-Maybe next time.
-Okay.

522
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,400
But these are so beautiful.

523
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,000
I feel like a queen.

524
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,200
That's because you are one.

525
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,800
Okay. Well...

526
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
...try to make it. Okay?

527
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,200
Then all of a sudden he got mad,
picked up the mike and threw it at me.

528
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,200
-And he walked out of the studio.
-Don't do live interviews.

529
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,200
-I gotta. That's what I do.
-What if they don't like you?

530
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,600
No, no. I just make sure
there's no sharp objects.

531
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,000
-Mirabela.
-Hi.

532
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,000
I'm so glad you came.
I wasn't sure if you were gonna come.

533
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,400
You look beautiful. I want you to meet
my manager. Alberto, a.k.a. El Zorro.

534
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,400
Thank you for coming.

535
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,600
You devilish charmer, you.

536
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,600
I want you to meet
the rest of the group.

537
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,600
We have Rafael, <i>el guitarrón.</i>

538
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,400
Welcome.

539
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,200
-Adon on the percussions.
-Glad you could make it.

540
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,800
-Thank you.
-A pleasure.

541
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,200
And then we have here
little Jorge on lead guitar.

542
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,200
Jorge. Mirabela.

543
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,400
I wasn't sure if you were gonna
show up. I really started to doubt it.

544
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,200
And since you're here,
why don't we...

545
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,800
...take this opportunity...?

546
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Now you sing with me, come on.

547
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,200
Nice meeting you guys.

548
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,600
-I have to go.
-Why?

549
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,000
-Thank you.
-What happened?

550
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,800
I don't know.

551
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,000
Mirabela. Mirabela, it was perfect.

552
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,000
-Antonio.
-Did you hear?

553
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,800
Did you hear?
You complete the band.

554
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,800
Did you hear the way
the room loved you?

555
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,800
It was just like my mother
used to sing.

556
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,600
I'm not your mother.
I'm not that old yet.

557
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,000
I know. That's not what I meant.

558
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,600
-Mirabela, please. Please listen to me.
-Look.

559
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,400
I'm not young or sexy anymore.

560
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,200
Come on.

561
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,600
Who wants to hear me sing?

562
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,400
I do. I really do.

563
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,400
I can't.

564
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,400
I just can't.

565
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Oh, Mirabela.

566
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,400
-ls it good?
-Oh, yeah.

567
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,000
I've never seen you eat this much,
<i>Papá.</i>

568
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,800
I'm a new man now.

569
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I feel so good that I could eat
the whole world.

570
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,400
Well, you can start
with your breakfast.

571
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,600
Where's that nice young man
you've been seeing?

572
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,800
I haven't seen him around lately.

573
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,600
Since when did you notice
such things?

574
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,600
I had a dream about
the two of you last night...

575
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,400
...and you were very happy together.

576
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,800
Well, that's nice, but....

577
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,800
I don't have time for dreams
right now.

578
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,600
Our dreams are the most important
thing in this life, <i>preciosa.</i>

579
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,800
Mirabela?

580
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,600
Come on in. I'm back here.

581
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,000
Where?

582
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,400
So, what else do you do
besides laundry?

583
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,800
Housecleaning.

584
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,400
-Could you reach that for me?
-What thing?

585
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,200
-You're so silly.
-Hey!

586
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,600
What are you doing? Hey.
Give me that.

587
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,200
-You want your laundry?
-Have you lost your mind?

588
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,200
-No, I wanna help you regain yours.
-What are you talking about?

589
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,800
-I know you really want to do this.
-Oh, God.

590
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,600
What makes you think
I wanna do that?

591
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,000
-I hate the thought of even doing it.
-No, you don't. You love it.

592
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,000
This is part of you.
It's your whole soul.

593
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,800
Oh, God.

594
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,600
-What?
-I thought you were different.

595
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,400
-What do you mean?
-You're like all men.

596
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:45,200
You think that all a woman
wants to do is play house?

597
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,000
Let me tell you something, okay?
I have dreams.

598
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,400
Big ones. I wanna sing.

599
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,200
I wanna sing in front of Javier,
that two-timing cheater...

600
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,800
...in front of his girlfriend...

601
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,400
...in front of everybody who thinks
I'm not thin enough.

602
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,400
In front of the whole damn world.

603
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,600
What is so funny?

604
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, my God, yes.
I'm laughing at you.

605
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,400
Because you're funny to me.

606
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,200
Oh, yes, you are.

607
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
You're very funny to me.

608
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,600
I-- I--

609
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,000
I'm gonna see you at rehearsal,
at 5:00 today. And don't be late, okay?

610
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Don't mix colours with whites.
It gets very muddy.

611
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
You know how to do laundry.

612
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,000
Five o'clock.

613
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,800
Mirabela?

614
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,800
Can I ask you something?

615
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,400
I don't know. Have you ever been
truly in love?

616
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,200
I'm not talking about, like, like.

617
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,800
I'm talking about, like,
really, really in love?

618
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:20,000
I thought I was with Javier,
but that was something else.

619
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,800
Right, but....

620
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,400
Look, but what if you
were in love now, let's say...

621
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,000
...with somebody new today...

622
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,000
...how would you tell them?

623
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,600
Who is she, anyway?

624
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,400
Well...

625
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,400
...she's this woman
who doesn't know her own beauty.

626
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,400
And I just--
I don't know how to tell her.

627
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:49,200
Well, you don't tell
a woman anything...

628
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,400
...just show her.

629
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,600
Show her you love her.
She'll understand.

630
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Not in her head, but in her heart,
where it counts.

631
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,600
Is that in a song somewhere?

632
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,200
Hey, come on.

633
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,800
You'll see. Look, look. Come on in.

634
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,000
I know it. They'll love you.
Come on. You'll see.

635
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,800
Mirabela!

636
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,000
Hey, guys. Hey, look, I've been
working on this electronic loop and....

637
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,600
Welcome to the Super Estrella
Mystery Musician tryouts.

638
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,400
Welcome to the Super Estrella
Mystery Musician tryouts.

639
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,200
Today's bands from all over
will battle it out...

640
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,200
...to the final stage
of the competition.

641
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,400
Only three lucky bands will advance.

642
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:37,600
So let's kick it off with
band number one, Bolivar.

643
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,200
What did she say?

644
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,000
She said five minutes. Five times.
Is that 25 minutes?

645
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,200
Okay, you can take the 5
to the 110 to the....

646
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,600
<i>That was band number one, Bolivar,</i>
<i>straight out of Monterrey, Mexico.</i>

647
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,000
-We can take Sepulveda.
<i>-Let's hear it for Bolivar.</i>

648
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,200
-We're not gonna make it.
-Where is she?

649
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,800
So keep calling in. Your votes and
our judges' votes will be tabulated.

650
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,000
And up next, Las Ultrasónicas.

651
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,200
I'm gonna make them late.

652
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:10,000
-Do I look fat?
-You look fabulous.

653
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,400
Mommy, you look beautiful. Honestly.

654
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,800
Thank you, babies. Kiss.
Kiss, kiss.

655
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,400
Enough of that.

656
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,000
You listen to your mom
on the radio, okay?

657
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,200
No more food.

658
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,200
-Thank you. I love you.
-Good luck!

659
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,200
-Here she comes. Here she comes.
-Let me see.

660
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,400
You're gorgeous.

661
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,000
That was Las Ultrasónicas.
It looks like you guys liked them.

662
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,600
Cartel de Santa is up next.

663
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,800
Where you guys been?
Come on, let's go. Come on.

664
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,200
Zorro, I'm sorry.
Traffic was terrible.

665
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,000
-You look great.
-Thanks. You don't think it's too tight?

666
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,400
-No, no, no. Looks terrific.
-Come on, guys. Let's go.

667
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
What an amazing group.
Cartel de Santa.

668
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,400
-Let's go. Come on.
-Hurry, hurry. Come on.

669
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,800
Up next, All Star Gringo Star.

670
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,600
What's the matter? Come here.

671
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,600
-What's the matter?
-What if they don't get me out there?

672
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,800
What do you mean,
what if they don't get you?

673
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
What if I've been lying to myself
and to everybody?

674
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:26,400
-What if they throw things at us?
-What?

675
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:28,400
Yeah, what if it just doesn't work?

676
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,000
Listen to me. You've got it.
This is gonna be terrific.

677
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,400
You're ready for this.
This is your moment. Enjoy it.

678
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,800
Okay? Get ready. Come on.

679
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,600
We worked really hard for this,
given it everything we've got.

680
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:05,400
Now I want you to go out there,
be brave, be bold and honest.

681
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,800
-Let's go! Go, go, go.
-Go on and have fun.

682
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,600
Hello, 818. We're El Gran Colectivo.

683
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,200
-Come on in.
-So is it hard being in a band?

684
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,600
You know, performing in front of
all those people?

685
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,200
I usually do it in front of
my family and friends...

686
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,800
...but I guess there's a first time
for everything.

687
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,400
-Let's not talk about it.
-You don't want to jinx it.

688
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,200
-No. No.
-Thank you. Thank you.

689
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,200
-No, you. You.
-You. You.

690
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,200
What are you gonna do with the...?

691
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,800
-How are you?
-Dr. Lopez!

692
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,400
-Good to see you.
-How you feeling?

693
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,400
-I feel terrific.
-You look terrific.

694
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,600
-How are you?
-Hey, how are you?

695
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,800
How have you been?

696
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,200
You see that?
Who's that guy Nina's with?

697
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,200
Some doctor.

698
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,200
Looks like someone's
got Nina's attention.

699
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:30,800
Good for him.

700
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,800
What, you don't care?

701
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,800
Nope. Not at all.

702
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,200
Make sure you don't spill.

703
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,400
You don't look like someone
who doesn't care.

704
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,200
I know I know you from somewhere.

705
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,600
Well, I live two blocks away from you.

706
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,800
-What's your name?
-Beatriz.

707
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,200
-Beatriz?
-Yeah.

708
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,800
I see you almost every evening...

709
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,200
...when I come back from work.

710
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,400
-How do I look?
-Fantastic.

711
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,200
Nina, will you help me make outfits
for the band?

712
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:02,800
Sure.

713
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,000
Zorro, I don't know, I don't know.
Nina's driving me crazy.

714
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,000
My mind's on fire.
I don't know what to do.

715
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:14,400
You'll be fine.

716
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,800
-Hi.
-Hey.

717
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,200
-Are you Antonio Hernandez?
-Yeah. That's me.

718
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,400
What can I do for you?

719
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,200
-We're from Estrella Arts Management.
-Yeah?

720
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,000
We'd like to talk
about your career.

721
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:12,000
We saw you play at the tryouts.
We think you've got potential.

722
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,000
Well, thank you.
That's very nice of you to say.

723
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,400
There's a great deal of talk lately
from the major record labels...

724
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,000
...about recruiting a
fresh, new Latin talent.

725
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,600
A solo act to be
the next big crossover.

726
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,400
-But I'm not a solo act.
-With our help, you could be huge.

727
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:32,800
Playing mainstream songs in English.

728
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,800
I don't know, maybe you have
the wrong guy.

729
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,600
-Maybe less ruffles.
-Okay.

730
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,800
I'll be right back.

731
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,600
-Will you start on the hem, hon?
-Of course.

732
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,800
You really do look gorgeous,
you know?

733
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,600
It would look a lot better on you.

734
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,600
No way. I'm too skinny.

735
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,200
Look at me. I wish I could have
some nice curves like you do.

736
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,200
I'm a stick.

737
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,800
Why do we worry about our bodies
all the time?

738
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,400
We're never satisfied, are we?

739
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,000
Yeah, and it's usually
just to please a man.

740
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,600
I've decided that I don't need a man.

741
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,600
But there is...

742
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,800
...someone that you're crazy about,
isn't there?

743
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,200
Why do you say that?

744
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,000
I saw you and Antonio at the party.

745
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,400
I'm not ready to get serious
with anyone.

746
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,800
Do you love him?

747
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,000
I don't know.

748
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,200
He loves you.

749
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:06,000
Really?

750
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,600
Oh, I'm sure of it.

751
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,200
So, what we're offering
is to manage you...

752
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,000
-...and set you up as a solo act.
-I know. I understand that.

753
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,600
But I already have a manager.

754
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Look, I know your manager,
and he's a really nice guy...

755
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,200
...but he hasn't been
in the game for years.

756
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,000
He just can't do for you
what we can.

757
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:32,800
You know, Antonio, sometimes
you just have to forget about the past.

758
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,600
This is a fast-paced industry.

759
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,600
If you don't grab your chance when it
comes around, you get left behind.

760
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,400
-Forgotten.
-Yesterday's news.

761
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,600
I mean, to be honest with you...

762
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,800
...it has always been my dream
to just make an album.

763
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,200
I just want to have a CD, that's all.

764
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,400
Well, better yet, how about
a record deal?

765
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,000
You really think so?
You don't think it's too late?

766
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,200
I still have a chance?

767
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,800
We wouldn't be here if we didn't.

768
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,400
Well, look,
I really gotta think it over.

769
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,400
Sure.

770
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,200
But don't take too long.
This one is on us.

771
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:21,400
-I got it.
-Thank you.

772
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,800
I'll take it over there for you.

773
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
-Well, thank you for coming.
-Okay.

774
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,800
-Sorry my hands are dirty.
-It's okay.

775
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,400
I mean, they're not dirty,
they're just greasy.

776
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,000
-I'll be in touch, okay?
-Okay.

777
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,000
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

778
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,200
-Here you go. This should be it.
-What's up?

779
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,800
So you got a record deal, huh?

780
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:48,400
-Maybe.
-Well, good for you, man.

781
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,000
-Hey!
-Zorro, I'm so glad you're here.

782
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,800
-I need to talk to you.
-Can we talk later? We're late.

783
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,800
Please, I gotta talk to you.
If you were me...

784
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,200
...and all of a sudden you had
opportunities you worked so hard for--

785
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,000
Opportunities? When we're done...

786
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:11,800
...you'll have more
than you ever know.

787
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,200
No, I know, but listen to me.

788
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,000
If you had to then make a choice
between two things...

789
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,200
-...that you really wanted--
-Listen. Let me tell you something.

790
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,000
This is the reason I became
a manager to begin with...

791
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,000
...to bring beautiful music
to the world.

792
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,200
We're gonna bring <i>boleros</i>
back to life.

793
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,200
I'm excited about this.
Are you excited?

794
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,600
-Yes.
-Of course. Come on.

795
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,000
-Let's go inside. Come on. Let's go.
-Okay.

796
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,600
I had a sofa made out of
this material.

797
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,400
You look wonderful.

798
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,800
-I don't look like I'm going to a funeral?
-No. You look very handsome.

799
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,200
Thank you.

800
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,400
Don't spill on your jackets. No.

801
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:01,000
Oh, my goodness, she looks beautiful.

802
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,600
You look great!

803
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,800
We're back with Pancho
from All Star Gringo Star.

804
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,600
<i>So are you excited about the finals?</i>
<i>Do you think you got a good chance?</i>

805
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,600
<i>Yeah, I think we do have</i>
<i>a really good chance.</i>

806
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,200
Now you told me earlier...

807
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,000
...that the contest has generated
so much publicity...

808
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,600
...that there's talk
of record industry interest.

809
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,400
Yeah, yeah. Well, not for us,
unfortunately, just yet.

810
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:43,400
But I did hear that the lead singer
from El Gran Colectivo...

811
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,400
<i>... is signing up</i>
<i>with a new manager...</i>

812
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,000
<i>...and is going solo</i>
<i>right after the contest, so....</i>

813
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,800
Imagine that.
So he'll be going out on his own?

814
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,600
Yes, the best of luck for him.

815
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,800
I'm sure your band
will stay together...

816
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,200
...and you guys are gonna do
just fantastic, Pancho.

817
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,600
You are too kind.
Thank you very much.

818
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,600
-Antonio, we need to talk to you.
-What is this we hear in the news...

819
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,800
...that you have a new deal
with a new manager?

820
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,200
And that you're going solo?

821
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,600
How could you do that
to Zorro and Mirabela?

822
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,400
How could you do that to us?

823
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,200
-I thought what we had was good.
-I'm really sorry.

824
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,000
I should've told you
what was going on.

825
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,600
-Yeah, what's going on?
-I feel really bad. You know--

826
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,800
Because I keep things inside,
and I should say what I'm feeling--

827
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,800
-Oh, please. So it's true.
-No, Mirabela, wait.

828
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,800
I did get the offer. And let me tell you,
it was really tempting, but--

829
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,800
Antonio, we'd be happy for you.
Just don't do it behind our backs.

830
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,200
I turned it down.

831
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:04,200
Because-- Because we're better
all together. Our music is all of us.

832
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,200
-Are you sure?
-Of course I'm sure.

833
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:10,600
Because I don't have a big office
downtown.

834
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,400
Who cares about
a big office downtown?

835
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,800
Those big-office people
never believed in me like you did.

836
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,200
And what happened to:

837
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,600
"You're gonna bring the <i>bolero</i>
back to the people"?

838
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,600
-What happened to that?
-Okay.

839
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,600
All right. All right.

840
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,400
-Hi.
-Hey. How are you?

841
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,800
-Guess what.
-What?

842
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,800
-I'm going to vet school.
-That's great. I'm so happy for you.

843
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,200
That's everything you wanted, right?

844
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,400
It's great.

845
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:22,800
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

846
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,000
Sorry for what?

847
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,800
I think I've been really stupid.

848
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,400
No, no, you had a lot going on.
You couldn't help but be stupid.

849
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:36,800
I'm just kidding.

850
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,400
I mean, what's important
right now...

851
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,600
...is that you become everything
your mother said you should become.

852
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,200
But...

853
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,800
...what about us?

854
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,200
What about us?

855
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,200
You think that...

856
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,800
...maybe we can...

857
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,000
...start again where we left off?

858
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,800
But why? I mean, I don't know
how you feel about me.

859
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:12,200
-Yes, you do.
-No, I don't.

860
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,400
Yes, you do.

861
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,200
You're gonna go off to vet school...

862
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,600
...find some vet and do
some animal experiments.

863
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,600
Dissect animals and....

864
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,600
Thank you for shutting me up.

865
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,200
-I want you, Antonio.
-Really?

866
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,800
My name is Marco Mendez
from Super Estrella...

867
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:51,200
...and welcome to
the Mystery Musician Contest.

868
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,600
Tonight, one lucky band
is gonna be named the winner...

869
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
...and will open for the
mystery musician next week.

870
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:03,000
But that's not all.
Because that band...

871
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:08,400
...is gonna walk off with
$10,000 cash today.

872
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:13,200
So let's settle back and give a big
welcome to the band number one:

873
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,200
Zoé!

874
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,600
So...

875
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:03,200
...how's everybody feeling?

876
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,400
Have you seen how many people
are out there?

877
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,200
-We've never competed before.
-Three hundred people.

878
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,200
They got nothing on you. Nothing.

879
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:14,800
I'm not gonna lie to you,
this is a big night.

880
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,000
But all those people out there...

881
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,400
...they're your friends, they're your
family, they're your supporters...

882
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:23,600
...they're on your side.

883
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,800
This isn't about competition.
You gotta forget about competing.

884
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,200
This is about doing
what it is that you do.

885
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,000
And what is it that you do? You play.

886
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,000
-Right. Yeah.
-That's right.

887
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:40,000
And you know what? You've gotta love
what you do. They'll feel that.

888
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,400
I swear. Trust me.

889
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,400
-All right, give it up for Zoé!
-Okay.

890
01:25:58,200 --> 01:25:59,400
One, two, three, four.

891
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,400
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-What's up?

892
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,800
I wanted to know, why did you
do that to me on the radio?

893
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:19,400
Look, man, I....

894
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:23,000
This whole thing just got out of hand.
I'm sorry. It's....

895
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,400
I guess I wanted it all.

896
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,800
Maybe I was expecting too much,
I don't know.

897
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,000
Yeah, well, don't expect too much
and you won't regret too much.

898
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:38,600
Okay, now give it up
for All Star Gringo Star.

899
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,200
Come on.

900
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,200
One, two, three, four.

901
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,800
I'm just gonna take a little peek
at the crowd.

902
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,800
Oh, no, no, no. Don't you dare.
Don't let the crowd psych you out.

903
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,000
Mirabela.

904
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,600
Javier.

905
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,400
That bastard.

906
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,800
She's so...

907
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,400
...young. So...

908
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:48,000
...skinny.

909
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:54,600
I can't. You know what? I can't.

910
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,200
Why? Why? What's the matter?

911
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,200
-I can't do it, okay?
-Why not?

912
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,800
No, you sing the song.

913
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,600
I told you not to let the crowd
get to you, didn't l?

914
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,400
It's my ex. He's out there...

915
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,400
-...and he's with her.
-Okay.

916
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,000
Okay, Mirabela, you're not
gonna give up everything...

917
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,200
-...because of one dumb guy, are you?
-Oh, God.

918
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,800
I'm not gonna let you do it, okay?

919
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,200
This means so much to you,
and you mean so much to me.

920
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,400
I do?

921
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:26,000
Of course you do.
You made me believe in myself.

922
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:28,200
I did?

923
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,600
Absolutely.

924
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,200
Thank you.

925
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,800
Oh, it's okay.

926
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,800
Is everything okay?
We're on in, like, very soon.

927
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,400
We got a little situation.
Her ex is out there.

928
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,600
-That's bad?
-Oh, yeah.

929
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:53,000
-Her ex is out there.
-So?

930
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,000
That's bad.

931
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,600
Oh, right.

932
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,600
-Listen, he's....
-A loser.

933
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,800
-Yeah. A loser.
-A real loser.

934
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,000
If he did not know what a good thing
he had when he was with you...

935
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,800
...then he'll never find out.

936
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,400
That's right. Get up on that stage
and show him what you're made of.

937
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,000
Mirabela? I don't say much...

938
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,200
...but you were born for this moment.

939
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,200
Now you get up there
and you be fantastic for you.

940
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,800
-Right, for yourself.
-For yourself.

941
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,800
And now let's give it up
for El Gran Colectivo!

942
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,200
-Yeah. Screw him.
-Yeah!

943
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,600
Let's go, guys!

944
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,000
Hello. Hello, Los Angeles.

945
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:54,800
We're El Gran Colectivo...

946
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,000
...and this next song
is a pretty song...

947
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:02,000
...that I want to dedicate to somebody
very special to me. Thank you.

948
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,400
Bravo.

949
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're gonna recount the votes...

950
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:00,400
...and we'll be right back,
so don't go away.

951
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,000
I just want everyone to be ready
for whatever happens...

952
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:16,000
...because this is gonna be
very, very close.

953
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,000
Okay, guys. Okay.

954
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:23,400
Let's just.... We've come this far,
what if we don't win?

955
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,000
It doesn't matter. We have
the most important thing, right?

956
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:29,000
We have each other. So come on,
let's toast to the winners.

957
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,800
-To the winners.
-To the winners.

958
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,200
-You're right.
-Thank you.

959
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:36,000
Antonio's right, because before
this contest, I was <i>solito...</i>

960
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,800
...and I met a beautiful girl
and I have beautiful friends.

961
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:42,000
I love you guys.

962
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:45,400
You know, it's true,
if it wasn't for this contest...

963
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,400
...I never would've met you, Mirabela,
my beautiful <i>corazón.</i>

964
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,400
What?

965
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,400
I've been crazy about you
from the first moment I saw you.

966
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,000
I didn't know you felt that way.

967
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,400
Thank you.

968
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:06,000
Allow me.

969
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,800
If you believe you're a winner,
then you are.

970
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,600
-Okay, then to the winners!
-To the winners.

971
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:25,600
-To the winners.
-To the winners.

972
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:35,400
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the mystery musician:

973
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,600
<i>El Señor</i> José José!

974
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,600
Thank you very, very much.

975
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,200
I would like to introduce to you
right now...

976
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,000
...the winners of
the Mystery Musician Contest:

977
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:00,600
El Gran Colectivo!

978
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,400
And now allow us to sing to you...

979
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:13,600
...a very special song.

980
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,200
<i>In the end, winning or losing</i>
<i>didn't matter.</i>

981
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,600
<i>Because together, we made</i>
<i>something greater...</i>

982
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:33,400
<i>... than if we each had stayed</i>
<i>on our paths alone.</i>

983
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,200
<i>And isn't that the beauty of life?</i>
<i>The love that we give and receive.</i>

984
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,000
<i>So see, my grandfather was right.</i>

985
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,800
<i>Our dreams are very powerful things.</i>
