523
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,647
You know, mumbles,
I said I was sorry before.

524
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,515
But now I really am.

(SPUTTERING)

526
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:44,931
Can I please have second chance?

527
00:38:46,963 --> 00:38:48,997
Go!

528
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm alive! I'm okay!

534
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:20,858
What day is it?

535
00:39:20,883 --> 00:39:22,569
Christmas Day.

536
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,004
Then I haven't missed it.

537
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:29,366
I'm giving you a raise and a
month-long vacation in sunny Hawaii!

539
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,514

I bought you a rocket so you
can fly home for the holidays!

545

Oh! You make me very happy!

I finally feel like...
A lucky duck!

564

I'm gonna go broke!

578

I gotta think of a strategy
to reverse the situation.

579
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,767
Should I steal back
all the presents?

580
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:18,602
Should I cut
everyone's salaries?

581
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,637
I gotta concentrate.
