- Danevang Presents --

2
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:27,333
- Mega Shark Vs.
Giant Octopus --

3
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:15,780
Aviation and Missile Command.
Sonar Test.

4
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:22,975
Height 3-4-0-3.
Win 3-2-2 to 1-0.

5
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:28,260
- Continue to report.
- Roger. Speedbird swings to the left --

6
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,851
- And continues close to the ground,
heading 9

7
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:33,190
Okay, Speedbird.

8
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:42,678
Wait a second part
of an iceberg dropped.

9
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:58,635
Hello.

10
00:02:58,952 --> 00:03:01,290
- Half of the continent is ...
- Vince, it is okay.

11
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:03,349
Why are you so nervous?

12
00:03:03,588 --> 00:03:06,925
- I know not.
- Just relax and enjoy it.

13
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,296
It is like a poem.

14
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:27,682
Speedbird, Alpha Tango here.
Can you see anything?

15
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:30,653
Can not see anything and radar
detects nothing

16
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,511
It is a wasteland.
It is no miles in circumference.

17
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,163
Remember lieutenant,
This is a confidential mission.

18
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:43,301
Get problems
the government will not be known by you.

19
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,673
Turn off the engine.

20
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,136
<i> Lieutenant, hold your position
and wait for signal. </ i></i>

21
00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:25,671
There you are.

22
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:29,050
Diving 20 degrees down.

23
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:38,260
Got it. Changing course.

24
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:41,657
Turn left. 3-0-0.

25
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,676
She is beautiful.

26
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,754
- Huge.
- Absolutely.

27
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:01,165
There are a whole bunch.

28
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,480
There are many.

29
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:25,077
Speedbird for April.
Is in position --

30
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,851
- And ready for
sending LFAS leave.

31
00:05:28,738 --> 00:05:35,021
On my signal:
3, 2, 1 and leave ..

32
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,333
LFAS sent off
and works.

33
00:05:42,534 --> 00:05:46,653
I want to receive
signals of 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ..

34
00:05:47,203 --> 00:05:49,280
Are the signals
emerged switches?

35
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,404
- It's incredible.
- Records we here?

36
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:01,900
Camera 2 and 3 are active.

37
00:06:06,054 --> 00:06:07,575
Hold on.

38
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,830
- What ...
- There is something with sonar.

39
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,103
<i> Lieutenant, what is the status of LFAS? </ i></i>

40
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:22,297
It is in level
1-20 and rising.

41
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,544
1-30, 1-40, 1-50.

42
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,298
Ladders, sir.
Is 1-60 ...

43
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,325
- What happened?
- I know not.

44
00:06:38,326 --> 00:06:42,193
- What is that noise?
- It's Dawry she hates us.

45
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:45,885
The noise? We need to
to leave the area.

46
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:47,890
- It's whales.
- No, it is not.

47
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:52,030
Something bothers whales.

48
00:06:52,031 --> 00:06:54,387
- Music?
- No, something stronger.

49
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:56,574
Man, what I thought of?
Whales are not the ...

50
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:05,577
The framework iceberg.
They kill themselves.

51
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:06,743
Think. Think.

52
00:07:10,715 --> 00:07:12,163
This is it!

53
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,136
It's a transmitter.
Son of a bitch, this is a LFAS!

54
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,573
What?

55
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:25,708
Low Frequency Active Sonar.
They should not be used.

56
00:07:28,692 --> 00:07:30,167
The iceberg is different.

57
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:27,952
Got a napkin?

58
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:32,670
Here in Japan, Mr. Harvey
we have certain customs.

59
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,449
Yes, we also practice in the United States.

60
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:39,395
So as to urinate
on a colleague?

61
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:43,542
I take it
too seriously.

62
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:48,292
- He feels you demean him.
- I can understand that.

63
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:51,737
There are many crazy things.

64
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:53,028
Listen.

65
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:55,358
Things are happening
is --

66
00:08:55,359 --> 00:08:57,665
- Larger than our
own small problems.

67
00:08:57,666 --> 00:09:00,885
And one has only the fun,
even doing.

68
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:03,961
The point is as long as we retain
our good mood --

69
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,879
- Everything will be okay,
I promise.

70
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,660
- Thank you Vince.
- Hey. I am a driver.

71
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,239
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

72
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,103
That I do not know.
Nightmare.

73
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:58,614
It was also the worst,
I have been exposed.

74
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:02,131
- Yes, even ...
- What?

75
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,627
That I do not know. I think
I saw something out there.

76
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:11,994
- What?
- Whatever.

77
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:17,448
What are they
Drop guys here?

78
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,196
FBI agents.

79
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,611
Perhaps "Sad Mou" a spy.

80
00:10:26,612 --> 00:10:28,175
- Do you?
- Not talking about.

81
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:30,194
After our little stunt,
my job is in jeopardy.

82
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:32,471
- I'll stay here.
- You are a coward.

83
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:38,393
- Okay.
- Did you know?

84
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,975
- You are late, McNeill.
- Yes, I know.

85
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:42,833
- It's the third time this week.
- It is enough, Dick.

86
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,669
Get some pills, ik!

87
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,365
What a mess.

88
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:02,128
Is that your official opinion?

89
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,485
It is a propeller.

90
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:06,816
It is the only explanation
on such a large wound.

91
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:14,988
It looks like the same type of injury
we were on the other whale.

92
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:24,816
- What did I miss?
- A promotion!.

93
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,605
Poor animals.

94
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,233
Hey, can I borrow it?

95
00:11:38,102 --> 00:11:41,758
- Strange. He ever seen it?
- What's on?

96
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:47,542
The damage of this wound
does not come from something mechanical.

97
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:49,359
This wound is organic.

98
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,084
Organic, crosses.
Do you know how it sounds, Emma?

99
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:56,367
Mention one thing in the sea
can do this.

100
00:11:56,368 --> 00:11:59,141
I stole not Dawry,
I borrowed it.

101
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:03,075
There is damage to
half a million dollars.

102
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:05,018
The Board is furious.

103
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:07,025
There were over 50 of them
and they went berserk.

104
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,620
- Whales are not behaving itself.
- You of course.

105
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:12,071
You are in places
where you should not have!

106
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,842
Yes, and thank God I was so.

107
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,004
Otherwise, we had not discovered
effect of ...

108
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:18,570
Shut up!
Listen to me!.

109
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,067
I am at risk.

110
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:24,470
I suggest that you go home
and think about what you have done.

111
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:29,476
- There is a meeting tomorrow morning.
- You know I'm right, Dick!

112
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:33,470
There is something big out there.
Something very big.

113
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,304
Perhaps I should gather
some samples.

114
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:47,501
Pak!. We already have the answer!.

115
00:12:55,881 --> 00:12:57,105
What's wrong?

116
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,644
Nothing. I'm just allergic
against the men in suits.

117
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,852
- Yes, I am too.
- What happened?

118
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:04,945
Nothing.
Let's have a drink.

119
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:16,628
It irritates me.
It's just about Dawry.

120
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,928
- About the damage.
- Fuck them.

121
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,668
They are only interested in money.

122
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:25,011
- They can not see what is happening
- Of course not.

123
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,693
They are not a
mermaid like you.

124
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,743
Yes, but this mermaid
being fired.

125
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:32,666
- They will not decide anything tonight.
- No, they will fire me tomorrow.

126
00:13:33,592 --> 00:13:38,148
- So it gives me very little time.
- For what?

127
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:43,758
It is the same face,
as when we stole the submarine.

128
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,462
Borrowed.

129
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,520
Hello, I came here
to see the body.

130
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:11,914
Nobody has given me
about this.

131
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:15,930
Typical! I was also
at home and then television.

132
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:18,696
We should get the payment
for these guards, right?

133
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,928
That, I agree!

134
00:14:24,045 --> 00:14:25,559
Thank you.

135
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:30,400
Just hurry,
with whatever you're doing.

136
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:34,622
The boys will move it
on the high seas in the evening.

137
00:14:34,927 --> 00:14:37,162
You know, before it explodes.

138
00:15:29,778 --> 00:15:33,520
Mr. Orry, I'm Dr. Shimada
from the oceanic Institute.

139
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:36,776
- I am here to ...
- Liar!.

140
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,879
- Who is lying?
- All.

141
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,889
They say that it was
a design error.

142
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,026
I saw it on TV,
before they arrested me.

143
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,387
I know.

144
00:15:47,124 --> 00:15:50,584
They say that all were killed!

145
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,580
No survivors.

146
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:54,890
How the hell can they say what
when I sit right here?

147
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:57,186
- Do not worry.
- Quiet?

148
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,027
My family think I'm dead
and I can not call them.

149
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,163
We'll contact your family soon.

150
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,850
But you must
to cooperate with us.

151
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,543
These people can be unpleasant,
if they do not get their way.

152
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:14,226
Believe me, I know.

153
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:20,180
Are you not for them?

154
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:23,313
As I said,
I am a scientist.

155
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:28,327
And you have seen
I would like to talk to you about.

156
00:16:35,256 --> 00:16:36,696
I saw it.

157
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,229
I saw its eyes.

158
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,430
How they looked?

159
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,013
Please show me that.

160
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,825
Take your back, sir.
Right up your seat, miss.

161
00:17:31,346 --> 00:17:33,258
Right up your seat, sir.

162
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:42,881
Change your seat up.
Change your seat up.

163
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,529
Change your seat up.

164
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:57,334
Please sit down.
It's just turbulence.

165
00:17:57,928 --> 00:18:00,386
- We need to marry for 2 days.
- You'll handle it.

166
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:03,020
This is the captain.
Fasten your seatbelts.

167
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:09,731
Holy shit!

168
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:40,712
- Emma, wait.
- You are not my boss more, Dick.

169
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,932
Emma, you're a good employee,
you just need a little discipline.

170
00:18:43,933 --> 00:18:46,212
- Want some advice?
- No.

171
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:49,913
Love is not the ocean too much
it will not be returned.

172
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,812
Professor Sanders?

173
00:19:57,565 --> 00:20:01,562
Emma McNeill!

174
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:04,627
- When we last seen?
- For 5 years ago.

175
00:20:04,628 --> 00:20:07,792
5 years. It is too long to
be away from my favorite pupil.

176
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,297
What is wrong with the teacher.

177
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:15,426
You got me away from the gutter.
So it makes us almost to the family.

178
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:21,307
- It's all a bit messy at the moment.
- Tell me everything.

179
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:25,771
Are you sure you're okay?
You look tired.

180
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,745
I have just been
fired from the Foundation.

181
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,463
And I am sure,
that no shadows me.

182
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,362
- Who?
- FBI.

183
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:35,736
Bloody FBI.

184
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:39,519
Du hunter you until you bleed.
Do not worry, Emma.

185
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,434
I will not let
them touch you.

186
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:46,063
I see you have taken
laboratory with you.

187
00:20:46,064 --> 00:20:48,337
Is there anything you want
I should look at?

188
00:20:48,338 --> 00:20:50,135
Funny you should ask.

189
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:08,086
You stole it
from the scene?

190
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:11,482
Work calls.

191
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:04,570
- A tooth?
- It has a big smile.

192
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,990
Very big!

193
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,235
- 11
- Inches? Oh God!

194
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,482
- Feet.
- Feet?

195
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,964
Crazy.
Who do you think it belongs?

196
00:22:15,254 --> 00:22:18,689
That I do not know.
You are past palæontolog.

197
00:22:23,357 --> 00:22:27,143
I would say the strains
from a very old guy.

198
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,507
A dinosaur?
You must be crazy.

199
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:33,134
- Why are you unsure?
- Did not I always taught you ...

200
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:36,346
Good to doubt,
but better to investigate.

201
00:22:36,347 --> 00:22:37,662
Yes, I am proud of it.

202
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,772
Say hello to Megalodon.

203
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:44,404
It means "Big teeth."

204
00:22:44,692 --> 00:22:48,852
Lived for 8 million years ago
and was the largest røvdyr in his time.

205
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:51,494
- The extinct order ..
- 1.5 million years ago.

206
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,848
The biggest fish
ever existed.

207
00:22:53,849 --> 00:22:57,534
And possibly the largest shark,
who have ever lived.

208
00:23:00,556 --> 00:23:03,996
Previous studies
have shown --

209
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:09,017
- That Megalodon ate larger animals
including whales.

210
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:13,362
Are you trying to tell me that a
extinct prehistoric shark --

211
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:14,826
- Ate my whale?

212
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,562
Clearly not extinct.

213
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,917
- It is impossible.
- Are you sure?

214
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:21,299
I can not turn on the TV
without hearing about --

215
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,045
- Unexplained
disasters at sea.

216
00:23:24,046 --> 00:23:28,233
But inexplicably does not
re prehistoric monster.

217
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:31,528
Why not? Observations
of havmonstre --

218
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:33,322
- Has existed for many years.

219
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:38,305
- I have written articles about it.
- It has never told me.

220
00:23:38,306 --> 00:23:40,838
Students may be
a bit skeptical.

221
00:23:41,101 --> 00:23:45,041
I was fired from the FBI, could not
risk was fired from the university.

222
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,441
And besides it would
no, believe me.

223
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:50,525
Yes?

224
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:55,589
Dr. Shimada, nice final
to hear your voice.

225
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:20,044
Dr. Shimada, I have heard everything
wild about your diving adventure.

226
00:24:20,045 --> 00:24:22,743
They are amazing.

227
00:24:22,744 --> 00:24:27,047
To steal a nuclear submarine
so it does not hit a dolphin --

228
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,675
- I would say
is more than game.

229
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,401
Indeed, it was a youth.

230
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:35,166
So you were thrown out
of the fleet.

231
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:39,530
May I introduce my
former pupil, Emma McNeill.

232
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:44,760
Brilliant havfotograf and pilot.

233
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:48,102
Miss, a pleasure
to meet you.

234
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,262
Should we?

235
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:57,643
I was surprised when I heard
that your government needs help.

236
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,628
Well, technically Dr. Sanders ...

237
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,780
- Lamar.
- So, Lamar.

238
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:05,182
Technically speaking, it is not my government,
who have asked for help.

239
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,637
- It's me.
- This makes it only better.

240
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:10,862
Diplomatic seen
I am not here.

241
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:15,944
Despite many reports no
appears with the root cause.

242
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:19,359
This is probably
lack of physical evidence --

243
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,024
- Or pictures or anything else.

244
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:23,870
And if there was evidence
they would not come forward.

245
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,631
The government would hide them
To avoid panic.

246
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:31,498
They are afraid. They are not ready
to a catastrophe of enormous scope.

247
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:35,789
And when they realize the situation
gravity will be too late.

248
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,501
That is exactly why I came --

249
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:40,950
- So we can determine what we are facing
and what we can do about it.

250
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:51,243
It was not what I expected
not from the attack characterization.

251
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,497
How accurate are your attack look like?

252
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:58,990
The injuries we can not be compared
with a Megalodons physiology.

253
00:26:00,157 --> 00:26:04,184
However, I got talking to one of
the only survivors of the attack --

254
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:07,123
- Before my government took him away.

255
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,641
Look at these sketches.

256
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:18,371
Note the eye.
Enormously with a large vertical pupil.

257
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:22,416
I agree. It is not
one eye from a shark.

258
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,938
No, it looks like more ...

259
00:26:42,944 --> 00:26:44,052
It is for you.

260
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,369
For me?
Who knows, I am here?

261
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:47,942
It has no sender.

262
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:09,899
The mini-submarine's camera.

263
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,292
- Vince must have delivered it.
- Who?

264
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:14,727
My friend Vince was present
when it happened.

265
00:27:14,728 --> 00:27:16,277
Given what happened?

266
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,934
Oh God! Thought it was a nightmare!

267
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:32,248
Definitely a shark.
A Megalodon.

268
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:35,108
And its friend ...

269
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:40,327
The same as in the diagram.

270
00:27:40,328 --> 00:27:43,268
- The expected ...
- What. A giant squid?

271
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:46,275
- Octopus.
- Octopus.

272
00:28:03,326 --> 00:28:05,919
- Chips?
- I am on diet.

273
00:28:06,197 --> 00:28:09,856
Wise to deliver video to you
instead of to the authorities.

274
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:14,752
He knew I went to you.
I spoke often about you.

275
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:19,145
One thing is certain
now we have half the equation.

276
00:28:19,146 --> 00:28:20,771
The photographic evidence.

277
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:23,665
A good starting point
as possible to give an answer.

278
00:28:28,636 --> 00:28:29,720
Amazing.

279
00:28:30,032 --> 00:28:32,071
Two prehistoric creatures
is mysteriously --

280
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:34,111
- Released in this world.

281
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,667
Maybe not so mysterious.

282
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:39,409
All icebergs melt
because of the ozone layer.

283
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:42,372
Perhaps it is our fault.

284
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:14,648
We are at 1-5-0-6.

285
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:17,610
We are ready, sir.

286
00:29:17,611 --> 00:29:19,475
We have not seen anything yet.

287
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:22,247
Give my president
personal word --

288
00:29:22,248 --> 00:29:26,064
- To arrive we find the monster,
we send it to hell.

289
00:29:35,813 --> 00:29:38,376
Shark! 1000 yards
and coming closer.

290
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:45,219
Ready for battle!

291
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,504
- Time to move forward!
- Start Operation Delta.

292
00:29:49,731 --> 00:29:53,339
Start the Delta.
I repeat: Start the Delta.

293
00:29:56,101 --> 00:29:59,117
500 yards and
comes ever closer!

294
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:03,762
The target is fixed.

295
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:07,158
Fire!

296
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:10,169
I repeat: Fire!

297
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:20,335
Stop no. Send the big monster
back to hell.

298
00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:38,025
- The target disappeared, sir.
- The target is hit!

299
00:30:38,234 --> 00:30:40,819
We can not
confirm yet, sir.

300
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,058
Washington dialing up
the target is hit.

301
00:30:43,264 --> 00:30:46,100
But, sir?
The target is returned.

302
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:52,682
The resurrected.

303
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,170
No.

304
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:17,136
No!

305
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,661
Stand up sleeper snouts.

306
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:49,368
- Seiji, you will have coffee?
- Yes!

307
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:51,568
- Sugar?
- Yes.

308
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,147
Good morning.
What can I help you?

309
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:20,403
It is not a
particularly nice place, do you?

310
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:23,347
It has the same illumination
as in Guantanamo.

311
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,722
I am pretty sure.

312
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:33,540
See not so scared off Dr. Shimada.
You will not be sent to Mansanar.

313
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:37,050
No, Mansanar were Americans.

314
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,965
Very well, Miss McNeill.

315
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:47,562
I amazes me safely over,
why we disturbed your sleep.

316
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,201
Let me guess
our country needs us.

317
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:54,033
One point for Irish.

318
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:57,659
Actually I am amazed at the fact
why it took so long!

319
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,150
We exhausted all opportunities
before we called the reserve team.

320
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:08,464
Your plan did not work.

321
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:12,959
We are facing a threat --

322
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,008
- Which no one had imagine.

323
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,001
Like Hurricane Katrina.

324
00:33:20,002 --> 00:33:23,254
Very good,
and fun, Dr. Shimada.

325
00:33:23,774 --> 00:33:27,986
Do you know that your Japanese Government,
has given us full control over your destiny?

326
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:31,083
Your life in my hands.

327
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:36,004
Unless you want to
commit ritual suicide.

328
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,839
It is wrong.

329
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,815
And it comes from someone
whose career is in ruins.

330
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,882
Sleeping on your
previously learned sofa.

331
00:33:49,123 --> 00:33:51,861
What now? Will i have some
money for rent?

332
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:54,394
- Hey!
- Do not worry!

333
00:33:54,703 --> 00:33:56,429
You should be happy.

334
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,235
This country would like to hear
what you have to say.

335
00:34:00,148 --> 00:34:04,549
For 20 years were
my ideas ignored --

336
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:07,469
- Why should it
have changed?

337
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,341
To be honest --

338
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,096
- In the losers
that everyone on line.

339
00:34:14,097 --> 00:34:16,824
You said the shark --

340
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:21,075
- Since all spoke
of seismic disturbances.

341
00:34:22,485 --> 00:34:25,908
- What you want from us?
- Solutions.

342
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:29,090
If we do not find a way
to stop it --

343
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,601
- Will Sharkzilla
dominate the oceans.

344
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,991
If you dominate the seas,
dominate your world.

345
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,999
I hope i is aware.

346
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,077
What? With many more
opportunities is that?

347
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:45,362
The red dots show where
Military ships have been attacked.

348
00:34:49,663 --> 00:34:52,960
These show attacks on civilians.

349
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:00,993
Megalodon does not discriminate.

350
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:03,787
But yes, he is a
Fair killing machine.

351
00:35:03,788 --> 00:35:05,155
And he is not alone.

352
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:19,066
- What the hell ...
- A squid.

353
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:21,427
- They were frozen together.
- But now 2 individuals.

354
00:35:21,428 --> 00:35:25,933
Unless you believe that the shark
Téléport from place to place --

355
00:35:25,934 --> 00:35:29,449
- I think you'll see it fits
Timeline of the disaster.

356
00:35:29,665 --> 00:35:31,786
A giant squid.
It is crazy.

357
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,890
We have talked about
how we can contain them.

358
00:35:34,896 --> 00:35:37,838
- Do not destroy them?
- No, we believe containment.

359
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,706
Yes, these monsters are a threat --

360
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:43,329
- But they represent also the main
scientific discovery of our time.

361
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,100
You can not just wipe.

362
00:35:47,237 --> 00:35:49,681
And we want your words
that you do everything in your power --

363
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:51,803
- To catch these monsters.

364
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:55,534
Believe in it?
And what do I get?

365
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:57,685
You get our full support.

366
00:35:57,686 --> 00:36:00,131
Professor Sanders and I
Both agree --

367
00:36:00,132 --> 00:36:02,869
- To isolate them in areas --

368
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,100
- Where it is possible to
contain and catch them.

369
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:09,801
Could I?

370
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,510
Bay in San Francisco
and Tokyo --

371
00:36:23,511 --> 00:36:25,889
- Are the best opportunities
in this scenario.

372
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,052
Look at it as a coral.

373
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:31,413
And how would we get them going
ideal for these places?

374
00:36:31,414 --> 00:36:33,233
By sending
them an invitation?

375
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,263
- We are working on!
- Work quickly!

376
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:41,524
Naval intelligence indicates
that they will continue their attacks.

377
00:36:41,525 --> 00:36:46,300
They are not
they kill only.

378
00:36:46,301 --> 00:36:49,436
Then find a solution
as soon as possible!.

379
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,726
See here.

380
00:38:25,307 --> 00:38:26,809
- Thank you.
- It was so little.

381
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,663
Do you?

382
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:33,986
It is not easy to work
where there are armed guards.

383
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,400
As far as I know it is not
new to you to be under pressure.

384
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:40,474
To sail a submarine at night
seems to be exciting.

385
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:46,654
Yes, I have always been
attracted by water.

386
00:38:46,883 --> 00:38:49,643
- Has always felt myself a part of it.
- I have too.

387
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:56,716
No matter how large or
strong waves were.

388
00:38:57,442 --> 00:39:01,296
- They never scared me.
- You scared even me.

389
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:04,652
Everyone in my family
were fishermen.

390
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:11,333
Lived on the water.
Were alive because of the water.

391
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:16,637
Everyone wanted me to
follow in their footsteps.

392
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:22,033
- Why did you not?
- Death was everywhere.

393
00:39:23,575 --> 00:39:26,509
I saw a dolphin being caught,
when I was a child.

394
00:39:27,778 --> 00:39:29,837
I could not liberate it.

395
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:34,486
The panic in its eyes.
Despair is.

396
00:39:36,032 --> 00:39:37,554
That was it.

397
00:39:38,817 --> 00:39:41,335
I never got over
"worm on the hook".

398
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:08,968
I would go for a walk.

399
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:15,927
You know a trip.

400
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,417
- You smell good.
- To do well.

401
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:56,650
Fragrances are a powerful thing.

402
00:40:56,651 --> 00:41:00,076
They can form
basis for relations.

403
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,215
Scents can even explain --

404
00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:06,769
- Why is chemistry
between any people.

405
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,668
- You say the most romantic thing.
- Really.

406
00:41:10,986 --> 00:41:16,352
They say that physical attraction
literally based on the scents.

407
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:21,527
- What?
- Pheromones.

408
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:24,735
- Oh, my God do you think that ...
- Pheromones.

409
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,975
It means we can use
to attract them.

410
00:41:27,545 --> 00:41:28,927
Yes!

411
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:53,889
- Emma is brilliant.
- I agree.

412
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:56,432
I've taught her,
everything she knows.

413
00:41:56,433 --> 00:41:57,690
Before ordering
cake and balloons --

414
00:41:57,691 --> 00:41:59,763
- Is there anyone who will tell me
what the hell is happening?

415
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:02,096
The smell!. Scent
biological effect.

416
00:42:02,335 --> 00:42:04,620
Pheromones are the means
linking all species.

417
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:07,229
It is the source of procreation.
The ultimate magnet.

418
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,710
We use San Fransico's and
Tokyo's bay as bait --

419
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:11,847
- With pheromones from both monsters.

420
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:15,343
Shark and octopus captures
smell and are drawn to --

421
00:42:15,344 --> 00:42:18,419
- And think ahead
a partner in them.

422
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,747
A tragic decision.

423
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:22,146
How are we sure
they bite the bait?

424
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:25,709
They have been
frozen for millions of years.

425
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,635
Would you not be horny?

426
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:40,386
These pheromones
released into the water --

427
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,738
- And attracts our friend
San Francisco's bay.

428
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:46,018
We can use technology UAB
to place the feeding strategy --

429
00:42:46,053 --> 00:42:48,235
- To lure them directly
into the trap.

430
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:50,570
And if I may ask
what is your case exactly?

431
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,989
You may well ask.

432
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,304
And may the people of
San Francisco to ask questions!

433
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:55,601
What they do not know ...

434
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,010
- If you need assistance please call.
- I will do.

435
00:43:03,187 --> 00:43:05,097
Lucky for us, my
Government produced the substance --

436
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:07,349
- Is necessary
to catch squid.

437
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:11,667
- They had hidden it.
- But it is not destroyed.

438
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:16,354
And we've only just learned
to know each other.

439
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:20,527
I know. In this darkness,
you were my only light.

440
00:43:21,154 --> 00:43:25,046
- I only hope ...
- If the fate will be our turn.

441
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:39,609
- Are you sure you want to clear you?
- Sure.

442
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,618
It is always best to fight on
one's own home which says.

443
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:45,178
Yes.

444
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:49,879
- I am waiting for you in Tokyo.
- Good luck.

445
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:51,631
Sayonara.

446
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:57,357
Well Julia, back to work.

447
00:44:02,693 --> 00:44:05,308
Sparkling 7, this is Tango-Delta-9.
I have seen something.

448
00:44:07,976 --> 00:44:11,014
1-7. The Tango-Delta-9.
We have seen something.

449
00:44:11,278 --> 00:44:13,100
It could be the guys.

450
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,917
Shark or octopus?

451
00:44:17,918 --> 00:44:19,587
Octopus.
It is hard to say.

452
00:44:19,588 --> 00:44:21,530
They have almost the
same size.

453
00:44:23,669 --> 00:44:25,859
The image disappears.

454
00:44:26,005 --> 00:44:28,455
Tango-Delta reduce
delay your account.

455
00:44:30,608 --> 00:44:34,850
Sir, we are flying in height 3-0, a lower
height could put the mission in jeopardy.

456
00:44:34,851 --> 00:44:36,870
When you say put the mission in jeopardy
do you think yourself.

457
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,506
- But, sir ...
- Go down and keep an eye on the monster --

458
00:44:39,507 --> 00:44:41,810
- Or I'll get your wings involved.
- Roger.

459
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:48,619
What is the point?
If he flies lower ...

460
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,307
Is it possible to make it work
as having been paid for.

461
00:44:53,669 --> 00:44:56,582
Black Bird flying down to
height 6-5-0.

462
00:44:56,583 --> 00:44:57,669
Understood.

463
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,588
See?

464
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,108
How low-flying the aircraft?

465
00:45:10,486 --> 00:45:12,823
- Approximately 100 feet above the surface.
- Soft enough to take pictures.

466
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:14,495
- Stig!
- What?

467
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,521
Get him to grow now!

468
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:22,291
Mayday! Mayday!
I crash!

469
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:25,806
- Pin his last position.
- No!

470
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:32,299
Get ready to fire.

471
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:41,789
- Fire!
- Firing!. The missiles are on their way!

472
00:45:51,646 --> 00:45:53,992
- The goal is gone, sir.
- Yes, along with the aircraft.

473
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,910
Now when we have placed the bait,
how long does it?

474
00:46:04,911 --> 00:46:06,797
With the current rate
and speed --

475
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:10,285
- I would say he frames
The first goal of 5 hours.

476
00:46:10,286 --> 00:46:13,312
- And where is it?
- It is located there.

477
00:46:15,459 --> 00:46:17,714
Far from civil activity.

478
00:46:17,715 --> 00:46:20,991
The place is like a big cave.

479
00:46:21,555 --> 00:46:24,637
If you push it against the wall,
it has nowhere to go.

480
00:46:24,638 --> 00:46:26,687
And what about delivery?

481
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:30,285
We put them
these guys must not destroy it.

482
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,950
You put me in a difficult situation.

483
00:46:32,985 --> 00:46:36,043
Last time he was behind the helm,
he hit a sandbank.

484
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:38,344
A violation is
costing several million dollars.

485
00:46:38,817 --> 00:46:42,363
At least, rescued
your submarine.

486
00:46:43,184 --> 00:46:44,866
I get us into.

487
00:47:05,724 --> 00:47:07,792
I just heard from Seiji.

488
00:47:07,793 --> 00:47:12,100
Squid are on their way to Tokyo
and our sharks are on the way to do so.

489
00:47:15,114 --> 00:47:17,353
- Are you okay?
- Yes, and you?

490
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:24,862
We have to be very
careful out there, Lassie.

491
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,424
I know.

492
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,122
We are entering into their world now.

493
00:47:29,123 --> 00:47:31,476
Your backyard. They have the advantage.

494
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:36,339
It is strange, I have always
perceived me as an observer --

495
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,723
- A scientist
not a soldier.

496
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:42,241
Well, in a perfect world
it would be the case.

497
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:47,304
But every scientist faces
for something like this sooner or later --

498
00:47:47,462 --> 00:47:50,468
- When to intervene,
for humanity's sake.

499
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:57,848
I am thinking of Einstein and Oppenheimer.
The extent of it. Devastation.

500
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,588
Yes, it is a great one.

501
00:48:01,029 --> 00:48:03,177
But ta 'no mistake, Emma.

502
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:07,232
What we are doing here is necessary
and true.

503
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:15,740
I am just so happy,
you could be with me.

504
00:48:15,741 --> 00:48:17,985
I do not know how I would
do it without you.

505
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:21,457
Of course you know it.
I am proud of you, Emma.

506
00:48:22,077 --> 00:48:24,406
I have always been.

507
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:29,135
But never again,
yet I am now.

508
00:49:26,024 --> 00:49:28,178
- Ready.
- Roger.

509
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,235
Heather makes clear.
On my signal.

510
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:36,149
3, 2, 1
Frakobel Heather.

511
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:44,398
Quietly.

512
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:03,924
How does it feel to be
behind the helm again?

513
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,948
Nervous?

514
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:10,050
We were sitting Megalodon.
Are you nervous?

515
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:14,021
I love it sgu!

516
00:50:31,348 --> 00:50:34,907
- We are about 100 meters.
- Okay.

517
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:36,786
I take my arm.

518
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:45,615
- 50 meters.
- Roger.

519
00:50:50,197 --> 00:50:51,344
In position.

520
00:50:56,569 --> 00:50:58,163
Understood.

521
00:51:05,334 --> 00:51:08,525
- Is on the starboard side.
- Roger.

522
00:51:11,191 --> 00:51:12,459
Quiet now.

523
00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:19,457
- Prepare for frigøring.
- Are ready!.

524
00:51:22,952 --> 00:51:25,410
Okay.
Unlock it.

525
00:51:29,148 --> 00:51:33,415
I said freeing it.
I know. I heard you.

526
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:38,824
- What are you doing?
- It stuck.

527
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:42,383
Stop the Christmas game
and release it!

528
00:51:42,562 --> 00:51:44,957
Have you not heard of genius?
Armen stuck.

529
00:51:45,205 --> 00:51:46,367
- Sir?
- What?

530
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:50,143
The goal came because the first two
and maintains the expected rate.

531
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:55,085
How long does it
before it reaches the bay?

532
00:51:55,086 --> 00:51:57,652
Its speed has increased to
almost threefold.

533
00:51:57,653 --> 00:51:59,027
In two, listen up!.

534
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,347
The shark will be with you
in about 5 minutes.

535
00:52:01,382 --> 00:52:03,907
Find a way that frees it
or leave the submarine!

536
00:52:04,954 --> 00:52:08,620
The submarine has no anchor. If we leave the
it can operate in a net fisherman.

537
00:52:08,621 --> 00:52:10,053
Or enter the Bay.

538
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:13,035
To unlock it,
it had to be here.

539
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,563
Find out!
We run out of time!

540
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:19,488
I have always loved the dodgems!

541
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:27,115
- Quiet. You are destroying it.
- It will not happen.

542
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,392
The goal has increased the speed
to 500 knots, sir.

543
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:40,408
Jesus, he is quicker
than a jet.

544
00:52:41,173 --> 00:52:44,067
Try to come out of here.
I try, we are stuck!

545
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,567
Expected arrival: 2 minutes.

546
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:51,641
Admiral Scott, expected arrival
about 2 minutes. Make you ready.

547
00:52:55,658 --> 00:52:57,712
- Get us in position.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:52:58,726 --> 00:53:00,960
Nemo!. I repeat: Nemo!

549
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:05,681
Drop the chain of command!.

550
00:53:05,692 --> 00:53:07,959
When I give the order,
slider in order to kill!

551
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,609
We have lost his arm!
So what. Get away!

552
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:26,663
- The goal is within reach.
- Within reach, sir.

553
00:53:26,698 --> 00:53:28,149
Wait for the order!

554
00:53:30,922 --> 00:53:32,490
Wait for the order!

555
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:35,507
Wait for the order!

556
00:53:44,982 --> 00:53:46,653
Hey!
Are you okay?

557
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,936
- Fire!
- Fire!

558
00:53:51,807 --> 00:53:54,264
We are firing!
I repeat: we are firing!

559
00:54:28,176 --> 00:54:29,545
Reports!
Reports!

560
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:32,393
- Too much dust, sir.
- Impossible to see, sir.

561
00:54:32,661 --> 00:54:37,544
- Fire again.
- Anything to see?

562
00:54:40,797 --> 00:54:42,713
Still nothing new on the target.

563
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,381
The target is destroyed!

564
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,958
The goal is ruined!
I repeat: the goal is ruined!.

565
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,342
Who will have hajstøvler?

566
00:54:56,635 --> 00:54:59,402
Sir, I get a signal.

567
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:08,075
Some orders, sir!

568
00:55:14,218 --> 00:55:15,886
Some orders, sir!

569
00:55:16,103 --> 00:55:17,184
Sir!

570
00:55:21,996 --> 00:55:23,997
- Oh, dear!
- Hold on!

571
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:33,632
Turn off the autopilot.
Turn left! Now!

572
00:55:35,441 --> 00:55:37,735
Sir, the target is moving towards
Golden Gate Bridge.

573
00:55:38,966 --> 00:55:40,524
Sir?

574
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:19,069
The goal is gone, sir.
It can not be seen on radar.

575
00:56:22,289 --> 00:56:23,851
Call Shimada in Tokyo.

576
00:56:32,594 --> 00:56:36,964
I sincerely hope that i had more
successful than we had here in Tokyo.

577
00:56:37,767 --> 00:56:39,405
Shimada, what happens?

578
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:42,795
As can see, we've tricked
squid to the bay.

579
00:56:43,285 --> 00:56:46,014
But our military has only
supposed to make it sour.

580
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:49,151
Like a rabid dog, the
more aggressive than ever.

581
00:56:51,963 --> 00:56:54,842
- It's crazy.
- The change course, sir.

582
00:56:55,223 --> 00:56:56,403
Wait a moment.

583
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:58,940
It seems that the monster flees.

584
00:57:02,927 --> 00:57:06,075
Oh, my God, what have we done?

585
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:12,132
Tell me, had success
with the shark?

586
00:57:12,794 --> 00:57:14,555
Very little I fear.

587
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:19,869
Sir, cephalopods is
disappeared from radar.

588
00:57:20,794 --> 00:57:22,826
Then we have much more to watch.

589
00:57:23,194 --> 00:57:25,628
Did Dr. Sanders
and Mrs.. McNeill it okay?

590
00:57:25,629 --> 00:57:27,864
- Yes, we have it good.
- Yes, but the city is in ruins.

591
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:30,060
Thousands have died.
What the hell happened?

592
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:31,959
Watch your tone
or if you smoke in arresten!

593
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,811
She not going anywhere
and do you know!

594
00:57:33,812 --> 00:57:36,138
Her idea is the only one who
could be used on this mission.

595
00:57:36,139 --> 00:57:38,340
Seiji what happened?

596
00:57:38,375 --> 00:57:42,344
We got problems. Bait
worked as you said Emma.

597
00:57:42,345 --> 00:57:44,947
- But when he came to the Bay ...
- You are a failure.

598
00:57:45,133 --> 00:57:49,312
Cephalopods were affected by
many shots, but no effect.

599
00:57:49,613 --> 00:57:51,000
The same here.

600
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,515
It seems that our weapons
almost no effect.

601
00:57:53,516 --> 00:57:56,832
- Conventional Weapons.
- What do you suggest?

602
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,049
Perhaps it is time
to use something more powerful.

603
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,607
- What nuclear weapons?
- Yes.

604
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:04,221
- I can not believe you are saying!
- I can not.

605
00:58:04,222 --> 00:58:06,773
I can. It is a
Standard military solution.

606
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:10,921
There are many deaths,
on both sides of the globe.

607
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,442
And you want to add more?

608
00:58:12,466 --> 00:58:15,402
Nuclear weapons may be our
only realistic solution.

609
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:19,307
And that is what
I would recommend to Washington --

610
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:21,539
- Before we have
a global disaster.

611
00:58:23,343 --> 00:58:27,816
- Do you think he will really do it?
- He speaks with the Pentagon at the moment.

612
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,710
We can not allow
that this happens.

613
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:33,432
Efficacy of an underwater nuclear explosion
would be catastrophic.

614
00:58:33,433 --> 00:58:35,514
The destruction of marine life;
unthinkable.

615
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:38,759
And the sea will be polluted
of radioactive fallout.

616
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,733
Potential damage to coastlines
and loss of life --

617
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:44,106
- Will be extremely high.

618
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:48,055
- And many tidal waves.
- We need to think of something fast.

619
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,522
I propose that we get some sleep,
and think about it.

620
00:58:51,523 --> 00:58:53,900
We can not reach something,
so tired we are.

621
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:26,424
<i> destruction of marine life;
unthinkable. </ i></i>

622
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:51,289
- Jesus! What?
- "Trilla in Manila".

623
00:59:52,455 --> 00:59:55,243
- Say it again.
- We get them to kill each other.

624
00:59:59,713 --> 01:00:00,800
That I do not care about.

625
01:00:01,026 --> 01:00:03,106
Same battle as they were frozen in
for millions of years ago --

626
01:00:03,107 --> 01:00:05,462
- Will be the battle as
kill them.

627
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:07,289
It is brilliant, Emma.

628
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:10,159
Just a moment.
Can I interrupt this for a moment?

629
01:00:10,313 --> 01:00:12,268
How to propose in
we bring the two together?

630
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:16,664
We use the same pheromones
process which we used earlier.

631
01:00:16,665 --> 01:00:20,000
It was the only
worked perfectly.

632
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:22,457
Okay.
Let's say they meet --

633
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,946
- How are we sure,
that they will fight to death?

634
01:00:25,947 --> 01:00:28,854
It is in their nature.
They are natural enemies.

635
01:00:31,234 --> 01:00:34,099
The fact that they were frozen
midst of battle, makes it clear.

636
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:37,353
Since isalderen came nearer
the animals were panicked and fled.

637
01:00:37,354 --> 01:00:42,224
But not these two. They chose to be
and fight to death.

638
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:47,355
Only hatred stronger than
their instinct for survival --

639
01:00:47,356 --> 01:00:48,903
- May have led to this.

640
01:00:50,788 --> 01:00:53,067
Your hatred is our last chance.

641
01:00:53,068 --> 01:00:55,008
Precisely. Physics laws take effect.

642
01:00:55,009 --> 01:00:58,803
Both possess a force
as our military has not.

643
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:02,929
But do they spend their
forces on each other.

644
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:05,518
- Bang.
- They kill each other.

645
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,647
Secure. But we have a small problem.

646
01:01:09,648 --> 01:01:15,603
What we see there?
No answer?

647
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:18,323
- Nothing.
- 1 point for you.

648
01:01:18,324 --> 01:01:19,874
They move in silence
and low depth.

649
01:01:20,456 --> 01:01:23,211
SR 75 spionflyvene
have no signal.

650
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,350
And if we get a signal --

651
01:01:25,351 --> 01:01:27,630
- They move so quickly
that we can not detect them.

652
01:01:27,631 --> 01:01:28,833
They are adjusting.

653
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:32,146
Uro. All marine life accelerates
under stress.

654
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:35,881
And they can increase their speed by up to
three times when they are tense.

655
01:01:35,882 --> 01:01:37,284
Yes, we make them sure.

656
01:01:37,285 --> 01:01:40,405
Yes, they make me and all
world leaders acidic.

657
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:45,810
They control the oceans completely.
All the boats are in port.

658
01:01:45,811 --> 01:01:48,949
- I can not carry anything.
- There is only one solution.

659
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:53,237
Place the bait in the ocean
and room them.

660
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:58,745
They will continue where they left off.
Everything we do is to get them in the ring.

661
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:02,743
- What insurance?
- A place far from civilization.

662
01:02:02,744 --> 01:02:05,803
A place where anything they can do
are harming each other.

663
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:09,792
I assume you have submarines
to patrol out there now.

664
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:13,713
Yes, all are in full alert.
The Japanese do the same.

665
01:02:15,153 --> 01:02:20,703
So get us into a submarine with our
with pheromones, and get us out there.

666
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,563
The release of pheromones
is crucial.

667
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:38,550
It is important that the system
pumps every 15 minutes.

668
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:42,452
Understood.
The system works 100%.

669
01:02:42,865 --> 01:02:44,896
Thank you captain.

670
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:00,554
You are a little green.
Going to sygelukafen?

671
01:03:00,604 --> 01:03:04,196
No, the pills will work.

672
01:03:06,943 --> 01:03:09,325
There are several buttons on it now.

673
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:13,540
- You used to sit behind the helm?
- Yes but it was in the past.

674
01:03:13,963 --> 01:03:15,714
Well, from the old school.

675
01:03:15,946 --> 01:03:18,735
The release of Dr. Sanders
pheromones works perfectly.

676
01:03:18,736 --> 01:03:19,704
Brilliant.

677
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:22,502
I have some questions
about our current course.

678
01:03:22,503 --> 01:03:24,032
Why?

679
01:03:24,954 --> 01:03:28,189
Because the further north we sail,
Despite tougher is the sea.

680
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:30,577
You are surely not afraid
Sunday captain too?

681
01:03:32,032 --> 01:03:34,351
You have to
forgive my old pupil.

682
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,066
But she can li '
to use his leisure to drown.

683
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,184
Latest position on the shark,
was to the north.

684
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:42,519
How do you know it will keep the price?
I know. Intuition.

685
01:03:43,113 --> 01:03:46,576
It must be good to be so inaccurate,
reach you at work.

686
01:03:46,611 --> 01:03:49,543
It frightens me,
but you start with what you know.

687
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:53,432
Instinct, followed by track
and a solution.

688
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:54,784
Hopefully.

689
01:03:54,982 --> 01:03:59,358
- What kind of solution that we hope?
- A bloodbath.

690
01:04:03,357 --> 01:04:04,774
Full speed ahead.

691
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:12,569
Everything seems to go according to plan.

692
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,048
We continue
to follow them north.

693
01:04:15,049 --> 01:04:19,327
It seems that our friends
prefer the cold climate.

694
01:04:19,963 --> 01:04:22,214
It looks like this.

695
01:04:22,524 --> 01:04:27,411
Unusual, but none of them
has followed a certain pattern.

696
01:04:27,412 --> 01:04:29,588
Yes but in a way or duck
it makes sense.

697
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:31,230
- What do you think?

698
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,848
They are programmed to
to cross each other.

699
01:04:35,022 --> 01:04:38,588
The point,
random, or intended --

700
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:40,763
- Is what that creates
life and destruction.

701
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:45,570
The universe was created
of such an intersection point.

702
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:49,545
The events in our daily lives,
is also created by them.

703
01:04:49,546 --> 01:04:54,414
- Or destroyed them.
- True.

704
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:58,418
Still, whatever
Ahead --

705
01:04:58,419 --> 01:05:02,876
- I am pleased that our
paths have crossed each other.

706
01:05:02,877 --> 01:05:04,908
Yes, it has been a pleasure.

707
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:11,566
Julio Cesar said: "In today's
end, which came on --

708
01:05:12,282 --> 01:05:17,029
- But the battle will end.
- Also will the end be known.

709
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:22,006
But if we meet again,
why we should smile.

710
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:27,047
- But if not.
- Then there was this battle a success.

711
01:05:36,836 --> 01:05:40,100
I need to talk
with navigator.

712
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:49,449
- I think much of the night.
- So do I.

713
01:05:50,502 --> 01:05:52,983
Every time I get up.

714
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:59,474
- We talk to you later.
- Okay.

715
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:02,060
Every man on the bridge!

716
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:09,298
- Put it on medhør.
- Yes.

717
01:06:09,455 --> 01:06:10,743
What happens?

718
01:06:10,744 --> 01:06:13,519
- Sounds like Russian.
- They say they are being attacked.

719
01:06:13,986 --> 01:06:16,750
Who is under attack?
I thought there were no ships out.

720
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:20,557
Captain, I have confirmed that
Petrox from a tanker has been hijacked --

721
01:06:20,558 --> 01:06:22,396
- By the Finnish coast
three days ago.

722
01:06:22,397 --> 01:06:25,213
Petrox would not pay ransom,
As the crew was killed.

723
01:06:27,785 --> 01:06:29,579
They shout søuhyre.

724
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:32,097
It sounds to monster
got them up and running.

725
01:06:32,332 --> 01:06:35,477
Captain, I suggest you
change course immediately.

726
01:06:35,512 --> 01:06:37,943
If we are lucky, the rest
after his meal --

727
01:06:37,978 --> 01:06:39,124
- And we could
overtake it.

728
01:06:39,331 --> 01:06:41,598
Maybe we can get it to
to hunt us.

729
01:06:41,633 --> 01:06:42,764
Hunt us?

730
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:46,374
Pin transmission.
We change course there.

731
01:06:55,851 --> 01:06:58,829
- Ready for battle!
- Pirates?

732
01:06:59,171 --> 01:07:00,988
They have been hit hard.

733
01:07:04,922 --> 01:07:08,569
- What kind of monster did this?
- Impossible to say.

734
01:07:08,772 --> 01:07:12,399
- Released in still the bait?
- Every 15 minutes as ordered.

735
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:14,627
- Good.
- And if he turns out?

736
01:07:14,662 --> 01:07:17,945
So are we ready for him!
Maybe he escaped!

737
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,920
Shark!

738
01:07:27,449 --> 01:07:29,755
- What the hell is happening?
- Shark attack.

739
01:07:31,532 --> 01:07:33,238
He is just above us, Captain.

740
01:07:34,189 --> 01:07:36,889
- Time to move forward!
- Roger. Time to move forward!

741
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:49,898
Callback Jack up.
Say they have to do torpedo are ready!

742
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:52,355
We have full speed on
Devil with the heels!

743
01:07:54,652 --> 01:07:56,387
Jesus!
How in the liver to such an?

744
01:08:03,377 --> 01:08:06,624
Torpedo 1 and 2 are ready, sir.

745
01:08:08,532 --> 01:08:10,010
Get ready for firing!

746
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:15,199
Fire torpedo 1!

747
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:18,469
Fire torpedo 2!

748
01:08:19,552 --> 01:08:20,411
Move!

749
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:23,454
Torpedo will stay on course.

750
01:08:24,485 --> 01:08:28,315
Frames of 5, 4, 3, 2 ..

751
01:08:32,658 --> 01:08:33,979
Torpedo are missed!

752
01:08:35,897 --> 01:08:37,394
Oh, God!

753
01:08:41,345 --> 01:08:42,948
He tails at us!

754
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,040
Wolf Pack Fleet is ready for service.

755
01:08:53,257 --> 01:08:55,790
Good shot, boys
but is delayed.

756
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:58,067
Sorry boss.
We did what we could.

757
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:00,971
This is unacceptable.
This command must be reported!

758
01:09:01,006 --> 01:09:02,806
This command saved your ass!

759
01:09:03,354 --> 01:09:05,239
Should have timed it better!

760
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:09,903
Send another team torpedoes away.
Let's keep him at a distance.

761
01:09:09,904 --> 01:09:12,100
I thought you would have him
to follow us.

762
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:14,850
I will. But I will not
have him so close!

763
01:09:17,127 --> 01:09:18,348
Yes, sir.

764
01:09:29,758 --> 01:09:32,293
- Sonar: Reports!
- Pack away, sir.

765
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:35,580
- What do you mean gone?
- All 5 ships.

766
01:09:38,881 --> 01:09:40,640
Destruction of an octopus.

767
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:44,293
Squid?
How ...

768
01:09:44,491 --> 01:09:46,990
See if you can get them.

769
01:09:48,598 --> 01:09:50,597
All communication is dead, sir.

770
01:09:50,946 --> 01:09:54,104
- Try one more time.
- Yes.

771
01:10:00,246 --> 01:10:03,056
Captain, octopus approaching.
300 meters at the port.

772
01:10:03,316 --> 01:10:06,734
- Time to move forward!
- Full speed ahead. Yes!

773
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:07,465
- Captain?
- Not now Dr.

774
01:10:10,132 --> 01:10:12,013
Captain, I know these waters well.

775
01:10:12,201 --> 01:10:14,842
There is a massive passage
15 miles away.

776
01:10:15,185 --> 01:10:17,251
- Passage?
- I've been there.

777
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:20,126
It is risky, but we can
escape from them.

778
01:10:20,127 --> 01:10:22,447
He is right. We do not slip away
from those in the high seas.

779
01:10:29,364 --> 01:10:31,148
The goal we seek, 100 meters.

780
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:32,703
Enable nødturbo now!

781
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:35,577
But sir, it will
overheat ...

782
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:38,917
It was an order!
Enable nødturbo now!

783
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:43,864
Nødturboen is now activated.
Enabled.

784
01:10:57,162 --> 01:10:59,725
If we do not have the speed of
we are dying here, guys.

785
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:02,582
Speed increases, sir.
The engine keeps.

786
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,977
- Roger.
- The speed increases, captain.

787
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:08,212
- Take us to the path he said!.
- Yes, Captain.

788
01:11:19,336 --> 01:11:23,598
Dr. We have discovered some
disruption on our radar.

789
01:11:27,757 --> 01:11:30,575
There are several intercepted signals
near the arctic circle.

790
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,561
That must be them.

791
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:34,575
There are many disorders,
it could be explosions.

792
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:36,397
Explosions?

793
01:11:36,621 --> 01:11:41,126
My last message
shows only one submarine.

794
01:11:44,088 --> 01:11:45,507
Only one.

795
01:11:47,254 --> 01:11:49,213
Trying to communicate with the submarine.

796
01:11:49,214 --> 01:11:52,751
I tried to make contact with
all ships. No response.

797
01:11:53,164 --> 01:11:55,371
It is perhaps only
a communications error --

798
01:11:55,372 --> 01:11:59,523
- Disorders due to depth,
or errors in the system itself.

799
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:03,126
- What about the submarine?
- It is impossible to say now.

800
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:09,176
We must be optimistic,
and help the survivors.

801
01:12:09,481 --> 01:12:12,450
Navigator. Take their
rate. Leave.

802
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,862
We are approaching.
100 meters again.

803
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:19,103
- Should I reduce the speed, sir?
- Negative. Keep the current pace.

804
01:12:22,677 --> 01:12:24,785
The goal is gone.
No traces of squid.

805
01:12:27,897 --> 01:12:30,441
- Should we stay on course?
- Yes.

806
01:12:40,782 --> 01:12:44,732
We have an estimate sir.
The width is less than 25 meters.

807
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,495
Sir, the target is returned
It seems to be the shark.

808
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,652
- How are we?
- 22.8 meters wide!

809
01:12:58,387 --> 01:13:01,815
- Distance to target?
- 75 meters and comes closer.

810
01:13:13,998 --> 01:13:15,615
- Captain?
- 20 meters.

811
01:13:18,943 --> 01:13:20,404
Keep her calm now.

812
01:13:21,724 --> 01:13:23,027
Captain?

813
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:27,545
- We do not!
- Quiet.

814
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:31,887
Captain, he ...

815
01:13:34,664 --> 01:13:36,070
Quiet.

816
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:40,348
Reduce speed now!

817
01:13:43,851 --> 01:13:47,243
- Improve speed now!
- We frames wall!

818
01:13:47,732 --> 01:13:51,799
- Improve speed now!
- Negative. You are insane!

819
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:55,405
- Will you kill us all?
- Drop your weapon!

820
01:13:55,607 --> 01:13:58,100
10 meters again.
The aim is approaching continue.

821
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:05,575
- Drop your weapon!
- Go back!

822
01:14:06,595 --> 01:14:08,464
Gåå back!
You are insane!

823
01:14:20,344 --> 01:14:22,863
- The speed is restored.
- We are in favor.

824
01:14:24,642 --> 01:14:26,370
Hold the hat and glasses!

825
01:14:26,371 --> 01:14:30,481
- Isvæg straightforward.
- Turn right!

826
01:14:32,906 --> 01:14:35,015
How many torpedoes
is left?

827
01:14:35,236 --> 01:14:38,036
- Only 1
- Prepare torpedo 3

828
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,059
- Ready.
- Shoot!

829
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,757
You got it!

830
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,049
- Captain?
- Speak up!

831
01:14:53,478 --> 01:14:55,389
The goal comes ever closer.

832
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,062
The goal comes ever closer.

833
01:15:02,245 --> 01:15:04,539
3, 2 ..

834
01:15:07,862 --> 01:15:10,702
Captain, I pick up a lot
underwater disturbance.

835
01:15:10,703 --> 01:15:13,070
Two animals.
Hard to say what they do.

836
01:15:13,983 --> 01:15:16,760
It works.
They are together. They are struggling.

837
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,589
What happens?
Who has taken over!

838
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,131
It is impossible to say.
There are many sounds.

839
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:50,736
Sir, the targets are separated.

840
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:55,137
They just lick their wounds.
It is not over yet.

841
01:16:02,276 --> 01:16:05,938
Captain, the animals were separated.
But is still active.

842
01:16:05,973 --> 01:16:08,958
Can we not get away from here,
we need to see what happens?

843
01:16:08,993 --> 01:16:10,966
- Take us periscopes height.
- Yes, sir.

844
01:16:11,288 --> 01:16:12,659
Good work, sir.
Can you handle it?

845
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:16,521
It is like to ride, sir.

846
01:16:24,941 --> 01:16:29,696
- Americans are still not equal.
- Are you sure?

847
01:16:29,879 --> 01:16:31,271
There is nothing here, sir.

848
01:16:32,892 --> 01:16:35,338
If the submarine has survived, it could
not have come this far.

849
01:16:35,339 --> 01:16:37,820
- Are there any signals at all?
- No.

850
01:16:37,821 --> 01:16:40,874
- Maybe it sunk.
- No, never!

851
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,428
There are intercepted
activities in the water.

852
01:16:44,429 --> 01:16:46,921
To the north by
a passage.

853
01:16:47,245 --> 01:16:51,752
Of course. That is where
we are going.

854
01:16:52,339 --> 01:16:54,592
Are you crazy.
It is impossible to navigate there.

855
01:16:54,801 --> 01:16:57,811
And the radar shows that
may have been an avalanche.

856
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,925
Or something else.
Changing course, Captain.

857
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:15,348
- Sir, both targets disappeared.
- What?

858
01:17:15,383 --> 01:17:17,617
They were on screen for a
moment ago and now they are gone.

859
01:17:17,831 --> 01:17:21,048
Perhaps the dead
of their injuries.

860
01:17:21,374 --> 01:17:24,028
Dead?
It would be good.

861
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:25,644
Real communication?

862
01:17:26,021 --> 01:17:28,289
Barely online.
Only short range.

863
01:17:28,324 --> 01:17:30,888
See if you can get in cash
with the Japanese submarine.

864
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:31,910
Yes.

865
01:17:34,184 --> 01:17:36,999
- I know these waters.
- How?

866
01:17:38,042 --> 01:17:40,084
I have been together
some whales here.

867
01:17:45,446 --> 01:17:49,662
- Captain, may I look?
- Yes.

868
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:00,318
Just when you think
there is no logic --

869
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:02,144
- Life is just a
random mess.

870
01:18:04,643 --> 01:18:08,466
- Something hit us!
- We have multiple damage sites.

871
01:18:08,735 --> 01:18:11,598
- Get us to the surface now!
- I try, but do not respond!

872
01:18:18,454 --> 01:18:21,720
- Make clear the missiles!
- Yes, sir!

873
01:18:23,128 --> 01:18:25,597
- With this speed, you'll kill us.
- Step down!

874
01:18:25,632 --> 01:18:27,026
We need to come
to mini-submarine.

875
01:18:28,373 --> 01:18:30,197
Get us up!

876
01:18:30,778 --> 01:18:32,615
- I try.
- Get in!

877
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:35,170
Sir, it comes straight at us.

878
01:18:36,713 --> 01:18:39,999
- Captain, we need a mini-submarine.
- Go! Move!

879
01:18:43,861 --> 01:18:46,360
You can not beat it.
You have to leave the ship!

880
01:18:46,752 --> 01:18:48,279
Move!

881
01:18:50,657 --> 01:18:52,537
- Get away from here now!
- Back!

882
01:18:53,775 --> 01:18:56,100
- Disconnect us now!
- Isolated.

883
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:01,102
Sir, it is just against us.

884
01:19:03,564 --> 01:19:05,011
Fire torpedo s!

885
01:19:09,264 --> 01:19:10,841
- There!
- Hang on!

886
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,931
- Emma, move up!
- We will not handle it!

887
01:19:23,886 --> 01:19:24,996
Got you!

888
01:19:25,175 --> 01:19:27,279
- What happened?
- MORE!

889
01:19:27,723 --> 01:19:29,333
Oh God!

890
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:34,043
It is Seiji.

891
01:19:39,828 --> 01:19:41,213
Yes!

892
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:03,851
Seiji. No!

893
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,861
What are you doing?

894
01:20:09,507 --> 01:20:11,117
- I take there.
- To do what?

895
01:20:11,118 --> 01:20:13,411
- To save my friend.
- You can not. You kill us all.

896
01:20:13,412 --> 01:20:15,209
- Lamar.
- It's too late.

897
01:20:30,728 --> 01:20:33,999
I knew they could not
stay away from each other.

898
01:21:37,131 --> 01:21:39,114
It appears,
they finally finish it --

899
01:21:39,115 --> 01:21:41,829
- As they began to
for millions of years ago.

900
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:17,447
Can anyone hear me?

901
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:22,986
- There are Shimada.
- There.

902
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:27,664
The Shimada.
Can anyone hear me?

903
01:22:28,847 --> 01:22:32,152
- Emma!
- It was incredible.

904
01:22:55,257 --> 01:22:57,247
You could have been,
slightly longer.

905
01:22:57,248 --> 01:23:01,800
I am thinking, maybe I could
be a little longer.

906
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:03,723
What do you think?

907
01:23:03,724 --> 01:23:07,160
Now there are several
great secrets --

908
01:23:07,161 --> 01:23:10,951
- I could be as long
you want me to be.

909
01:23:12,607 --> 01:23:16,453
I am not the type who
stands in the kitchen and cook food.

910
01:23:16,457 --> 01:23:20,095
- I am a mermaid.
- My home is there.

911
01:23:23,626 --> 01:23:26,854
The sea, like you.

912
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:39,511
Do you know that only 8% of the oceans
has been studied?

913
01:23:39,512 --> 01:23:41,725
It sounds like a challenge.

914
01:23:41,726 --> 01:23:44,900
Have you ever seen a herd of whales
swim to Mozart?

915
01:23:45,355 --> 01:23:47,850
I think
I soon will.

916
01:23:52,283 --> 01:23:55,756
- Emma! Seiji!
- Lamar!

917
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:59,876
Oh, no!
You have the facial expressions!.

918
01:23:59,877 --> 01:24:02,630
- Well, I thought ...
- Oh no, teacher.

919
01:24:02,631 --> 01:24:05,832
To find these monsters were
a unique event.

920
01:24:08,296 --> 01:24:11,252
- What is it?
- A new unique event.

921
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,187
A volcano.

922
01:24:17,765 --> 01:24:21,421
A type of volcanic life?
Protected?

923
01:24:21,962 --> 01:24:25,114
- Where are they taken?
- In the North Sea.

924
01:24:26,583 --> 01:24:28,709
- Are you ready?
- Oh, yes.

925
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:30,424
- And you?
- Let's go!
