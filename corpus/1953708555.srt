00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,836
(wind howling)

2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,713
(thunderclap)

3
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,924
(whinnies)

4
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,971
(groans)

5
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,758
(whinnies)

6
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,510
(neighs)

7
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,284
(mare neighs)

8
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,615
(foal neighs playfully)

9
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,168
(screeches)

10
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,733
(speaks Arabic)

11
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,072
(neighing)

12
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,776
(speaks Arabic)

13
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,575
(speaks Arabic)

14
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,855
(mare neighs plaintively)

15
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,762
(speaks Arabic)

16
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,451
(screeches)

17
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,165
(shouts in Arabic)

18
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,676
Is there trouble, Kadir?

19
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,807
It's Mansoor. He's always trouble.

20
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:21,843
But we paid his bribe.
We'll be all right... I hope.

21
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,492
Neera!

22
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,024
I was just looking.

23
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,725
(Kadir chuckles)

24
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,431
- I'm not tired, honest.
- We'll stop in the foothills.

25
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,531
It's safer there.
Not much longer.

26
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:20,943
I was dreaming about home.
It's so beautiful - like a palace.

27
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,710
Big grassy fields
for my grandpa's horses.

28
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,880
They're the best in the whole valley.
They win every race.

29
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,582
Well, almost every race.

30
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,454
He must be a very important man,
your grandfather,

31
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:38,622
to breed horses that never lose,
to live like a king in a palace.

32
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,995
I know he didn't want
to send me away,

33
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,625
but he thought it'd be safer
until after the war.

34
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,832
Life has a way of shifting,
like blowing sand.

35
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,604
- (hawk screeches)
- (man shouts in Arabic)

36
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,804
What... what is it?

37
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,779
Kadir? What's wrong?

38
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,647
(men shouting in Arabic)

39
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,118
Mansoor.

40
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,590
Save yourself, Neera!

41
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,597
Go west. Find the mountains.
Follow them home.

42
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:16,465
Don't stop. Don't look back.
Go now! Go!

43
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,164
- What about you?
- Go!

44
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,935
Kadir!

45
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,838
(shouting in Arabic)

46
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,357
(gunshots)

47
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,873
(gunshots)

48
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,754
(shrieks)

49
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,694
(flies buzzing)

50
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,478
(running water)

51
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,000
(slurps)

52
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,910
(horse snorts)

53
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,162
(neighs)

54
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,555
Good boy.

55
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,897
Good boy.

56
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,296
Wait!

57
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,102
Come back!

58
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,540
Come back.

59
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,012
(neighing)

60
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:02,345
Hey! Where are you going?

61
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,350
Wait for me!

62
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,510
Wait!

63
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,063
(grunting)

64
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,405
(running water)

65
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,013
(slurps)

66
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,681
(grunts)

67
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,194
I'll get you a drink.

68
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,919
(giggles)

69
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,101
(wolf howls)

70
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,914
(whistles) Black?

71
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,320
(whistles)

72
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,762
Black?

73
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,201
(whistles)

74
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,012
Good boy.

75
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,850
We'll find a way home.
You and me, together.

76
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,075
We just have to keep going.

77
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:02,272
We're close, I think... I hope.

78
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,501
We're home.
It's there, see? Come on.

79
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,175
(vehicle approaching)

80
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,409
(neighs)

81
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,882
Hold, boy. Easy, now.

82
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,084
No, wait. Come back!
Don't leave me!

83
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,424
Come back.

84
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,995
Black?

85
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,342
(creaking)

86
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,358
Hello?

87
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:00,695
Hello?

88
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,463
- (yells)
- (shrieks)

89
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,201
- Aden?
- Neera, is that you?

90
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,869
We thought you were dead.

91
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,574
No, it's really me in person.
See?

92
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:19,481
What were you going to do,
chase me away?

93
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,416
I didn't even know it was you.

94
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:26,617
We heard the caravan was attacked.
I didn't expect to ever see you again.

95
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,717
- Where is everyone?
- They ran away.

96
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,593
- Everyone?
- Not Ben Ishak or me.

97
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:47,969
- Is he all right?
- Sometimes I hear him crying.

98
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,976
Go away.

99
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:59,248
Leave me alone.
Can't you hear? Go.

100
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,590
But it's me, Grandpa.

101
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,328
Neera?

102
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,199
Grandpa.

103
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,972
Oh, Neera.

104
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:25,346
If he hadn't helped me, I would've given up.
I just wouldn't have gotten here.

105
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,615
Sometimes in the desert,
the devil plays tricks.

106
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:35,217
Our minds get all twisted
and we imagine things.

107
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:39,696
No, he's real. He is.
He's already so strong and fast.

108
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,290
- We have to find him.
- Neera...

109
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,963
This black colt is just a trick,
a devil dream.

110
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,409
He doesn't exist.
Only here, and here. Let him go.

111
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,570
(horse galloping)

112
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,346
(man shouts in Arabic)

113
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,930
That horse, the one in front.

114
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,904
- Isn't that Kazeer?
- Uh-huh.

115
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,172
Kazeer doesn't belong to us anymore.

116
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,712
None of them do.

117
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,544
They're scattered.

118
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:37,213
Rhamon took Kazeer.
He took most of the mares.

119
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,521
- They were like family.
- There was no other way.

120
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:46,587
When the soldiers came with their tanks
and their bombs, they destroyed our fields.

121
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,863
Our crops burned to the ground.
There was nothing left. Nothing.

122
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:55,202
I could not afford to feed them anymore.
I had to sell.

123
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,434
Even Jinah?

124
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,636
The thought of anyone else
owning Jinah,

125
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,977
that cut too deep,
like a jagged knife.

126
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:07,381
So I sent her back to the desert,
where she belonged.

127
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,046
Some people thought
I was foolish,

128
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,386
but I knew it was right.

129
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,052
We are not breeders anymore.
So be it.

130
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,222
At least we have a roof overhead.

131
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:21,993
That's luckier than most.

132
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,159
We kept Abha.

133
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,982
Oh, Abha.

134
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:13,984
(neighs)

135
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,824
(distant neighing)

136
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,742
(Neera sings in Arabic)

137
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,884
(Ishak chuckles)

138
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,386
- (Neera) You remember it?
- (Ishak) Maybe.

139
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,892
(Ishak and Neera sing in Arabic)

140
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,089
- (both) (music) My beloved
- (music) My beloved

141
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,191
(all) (music) Like a rose

142
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,069
(music) A precious rose
that blooms in a garden

143
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:11,540
(music) You shall be
forever in my heart

144
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,577
(Ishak) (music) Bom bom

145
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,736
(all sing in Arabic)

146
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,609
(music) My beloved, my bel...

147
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,086
- (Ishak) Whoa!
- (laughter)

148
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,292
Salaam alaika, Ishak.
Need help?

149
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:40,860
We will manage.

150
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,705
Kazeer looks good, don't you think?

151
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,576
You should have been at the races.
He won, of course.

152
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:52,242
Mansoor was too busy thieving his way
through the desert to bring Radan,

153
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,775
so it was hardly a challenge.
Nothing even came close.

154
00:25:55,887 --> 00:26:00,790
Still, I appreciate my prizes.
You may recognize some.

155
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,828
- He won those?
- Yeah. It's the new rules.

156
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,262
Each tribe stakes their best mare.

157
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,425
The winner gets them all.

158
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:13,096
You are a lucky man, Rhamon,
to have won such fine horses.

159
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,106
Your reputation grows
along with your herd.

160
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:19,166
I hear Mansoor caught
your silver mare Jinah.

161
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,906
They say he couldn't catch
the black foal that ran beside her.

162
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,314
Perhaps it stumbled
into the secret valley.

163
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,581
You should have kept her.
You would have had a chance.

164
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:33,590
Instead you have what? That one?

165
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:39,528
Do the hopes of the great Ben Ishak
rest with your plow horse?

166
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,459
Stop being a hermit, old man.
Come to next year's races.

167
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,768
See Kazeer win again
for the tribe of Rhamon.

168
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,332
See you there, huh?
Ma salaama.

169
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,148
Grandpa!

170
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,056
Did you hear what he said?

171
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,619
It's got to be him.
My colt. He's Jinah's son.

172
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,962
It's gossip, Neera. Rumors.

173
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:19,697
If we find him, we can start all over.
We can raise a new herd.

174
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,467
We'll have horses again,
just like before.

175
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,999
(Ishak) Listen to you.
Such big plans.

176
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:33,347
You remind me of your mother-
brave, fearless. She loved her horses.

177
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,319
She could see
right into their hearts.

178
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:39,380
She rode like she was born to it.

179
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,085
Better than most of the men.

180
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,340
(cock crows)

181
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,427
(neighing)

182
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,590
(laughing)

183
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,773
(whinnying)

184
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,936
(neighing)

185
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,671
(neighs)

186
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,822
(neighs)

187
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,506
(laughs)

188
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:59,913
Ohh! (laughs)

189
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,731
Come on. Good boy.

190
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,902
Good boy.

191
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,590
(laughs)

192
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:14,155
Ben Ishak! Ben Ishak!
It's Neera!

193
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,759
She's back, but she's not alone.
She's... Come quickly!

194
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,538
Come on! Hurry.

195
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,035
Neera! What are you doing?

196
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,511
- Have you gone mad?
- It's him, Grandpa.

197
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,209
He's not a dream. He's real.
And he's fast. Did you see?

198
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,618
- You could have been hurt.
- No, he wouldn't hurt me.

199
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:42,854
His heart is full of fire, Neera.
Like the devil, Shetan.

200
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,363
Whoa. Easy, now.

201
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:48,489
He can beat Kazeer, Grandpa.

202
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,525
I know it. He can win.
He really can.

203
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:56,664
Even if he's as good as you think, even
half as good, the festival's almost here.

204
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,972
There's no time to train,
there's no jockey, there is nothing.

205
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:03,810
I can ride him. He listens to me,
and he'll do it if I ask him.

206
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,873
He's raw. He's wild.

207
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,580
And you, you're just a child, a girl.

208
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:14,317
- But that's not fair.
- You know how dangerous this course is?

209
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:18,419
I refuse to lose anyone else.
So don't even think about it, understand?

210
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:21,362
I won't allow it. I forbid it.

211
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:23,525
I forbid it.

212
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,874
You have to help me, Aden.

213
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:34,400
What? Are you joking?
Tell me you're joking.

214
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,448
(Neera) it's our secret now.
All right?

215
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,651
Keep him slow
until you get past me.

216
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:19,245
Slow. And wait for my signal, all right?

217
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,149
On mark.

218
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,421
Be set...

219
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,156
That's not slow!

220
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,402
What happened to "slow"?

221
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,631
(men shouting in Arabic)

222
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,643
(children shouting)

223
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,971
Jinah.

224
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,165
Ben Ishak.

225
00:35:55,052 --> 00:35:57,145
Ben Ishak...

226
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,494
- (Aden) Where is he?
- I don't know.

227
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:14,497
- (whistles)
- Call him again.

228
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:15,766
(whistles)

229
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,106
(neighing)

230
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,579
We'd better hurry.

231
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,592
Jinah...

232
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,201
Yes... Remember me?

233
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,870
(group chanting) Rhamon! Rhamon!

234
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,217
(second group) Mansoor! Mansoor!

235
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,753
(cheering)

236
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,097
Control your horse, Mansoor.
This is a race, not a fight.

237
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,936
(hunting horn)

238
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,135
(men shout in Arabic)

239
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:35,619
(Aden) Wait! Wait for us!
Out of the way!

240
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,677
We're coming!

241
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,847
(cheering)

242
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:49,194
Whoa. Easy. Steady. Steady.

243
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,997
The tribe of Ben Ishak
humbly presents its official entrant -

244
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,038
the stallion Shetan.

245
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,506
But there's an entrance fee.
What do you have to offer?

246
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,773
- That broken-down old mare?
- (laughter)

247
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,712
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

248
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,716
What if he loses?
Have you thought of that?

249
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:11,117
He won't lose.
Now go on and tell them.

250
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:15,887
The proud tribe of Ben Ishak
offers its finest horse as entry fee -

251
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,791
the stallion Shetan.

252
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:23,323
But it's supposed to be a mare,
not some devil horse.

253
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:28,202
The finest mare.
That is the rules.

254
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:33,005
Stop whining, Rhamon.
Let him race.

255
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,841
(conversation in Arabic)

256
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:45,019
Tell Ishak to say his goodbyes.

257
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,583
Good luck.

258
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,104
(whinnies)

259
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,440
(whinnies in response)

260
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,518
Easy, easy. Ohh.

261
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,520
Steady, now. Steady.

262
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,554
Whoa, whoa.

263
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,432
(cheering)

264
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,297
Whoa, whoa! Steady!

265
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,064
Steady! Go!

266
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,072
No!

267
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,747
(riders yelling)

268
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:14,008
You can do it, Shetan!
Run! Run!

269
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,128
Up, Shetan! Up!

270
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,956
Yes! Good boy!

271
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,156
Come on, Thor!

272
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,324
Hyah! Hyah!

273
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,411
Come on! Come on!
Go! Go!

274
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,082
Out of my way!

275
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,372
We're catching them! Yes! Yes!

276
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,367
Go! Go!

277
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:24,532
Yes! Yes, Shetan! Yes!

278
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:31,075
- Get out of the way!
- (shouts in Arabic)

279
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,169
Yes! Good, Shetan! Good!

280
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,681
(Rhamon) Come on! Come on!

281
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,453
Go!

282
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,339
- Get out of my way, Mansoor!
- (speaks Arabic)

283
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:54,729
We're gaining on them!
Come on! Come on!

284
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,102
You can do it, Shetan!
You can do it!

285
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,017
There's our chance, Shetan!
Now! Come on!

286
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,355
Watch out!

287
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,184
Let me pass!

288
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,060
- Hey! No! You can't do that!
- Out of my way!

289
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,706
- (shouts in Arabic)
- (crowd cheers)

290
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,655
Faster, Shetan! Faster!

291
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,127
Go, Shetan! Go! Go!

292
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:50,070
(frenzied cheering)

293
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,746
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

294
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,685
Neera!

295
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,921
Good boy! You did it! You did it!
You're such a good boy!

296
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:10,763
(crowd chanting)
Shetan! Shetan! Shetan!

297
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:31,480
I'm sorry I disobeyed you, Grandpa.
But he won. He won!

298
00:46:31,555 --> 00:46:34,149
Are you angry?

299
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:41,828
Neera! Neera, you did it,
you tricky little fry!

300
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:45,130
- (Aden) We did it! We did it!
- You too, Aden!

301
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,295
We did it!

302
00:50:32,202 --> 00:50:33,295
{{{the end}}}
