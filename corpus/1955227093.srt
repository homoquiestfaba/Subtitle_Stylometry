Hey, Kristy!

556
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:48,407
Kristy!

557
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:53,379
Kristy!

558
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,383
Over here!

559
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,819
Kristy!

560
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:04,923
Hey!

561
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:05,724
KRISTY: Hi.

562
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:13,565
Hey.

563
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,034
Hi.

564
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:18,170
It's Grahm from the
club the other night.

565
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,071
I recognize you.

566
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,672
Yeah, I recognize you, too.

567
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:29,381
So how's it going?

568
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,449
Fine.

569
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,851
You're just hanging out?

570
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,020
Yeah.

571
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,387
What are you doing here?

572
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,123
Just hanging out.

573
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:39,925
You know, just in nature.

574
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,027
Just hanging out
at the "be-ach".

575
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:46,232
[Clears throat]

576
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:49,101
A lot of waves today, man.

577
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:49,901
Yeah.

578
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:50,836
It's the beach.

579
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,811
Did you have fun at the
club the other night?

580
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,215
Uh, yeah.

581
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,416
It was pretty cool, yeah?

582
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:05,217
Yeah.

583
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,922
Yeah.

584
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,924
No Angel today, though, huh?

585
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:14,293
No.

586
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:15,961
What's she doing?

587
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,964
I think she's still asleep.

588
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:23,735
She didn't come till,
like, 10:00 this morning.

589
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,536
So...

590
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:25,471
What was she doing?

591
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,239
Working or something?

592
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,174
I don't know?

593
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:30,442
Does she sell stuff?

594
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,911
I don't know.

595
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,812
That's cool.

596
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:36,014
I don't know what you mean.

597
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:38,384
Party stuff.

598
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,318
I don't know.

599
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:44,290
Your legs have
some hair on them.

600
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,759
I forgot to shave.

601
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,261
Me, too

602
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,762
Yeah, your legs are hairy.

603
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,074
So what are you
going to do later?

604
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,575
I'm going to go
to singing class.

605
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:04,543
Oh, OK.

606
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:05,377
Yeah, all day.

607
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:12,084
Because I thought maybe that,
uh, you know the way things

608
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:14,520
Ended or whatever
the other night maybe

609
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,156
We should give it another go.

610
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:21,893
Well, I have my
singing class so.

611
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,863
So yeah, no.

612
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,365
So you're probably
going to do that.

613
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:27,166
Yeah.

614
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,134
That's all day?

615
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:29,568
That's all day.

616
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:31,537
It's like a workshop.

617
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,472
What the fuck does that mean?

618
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,273
It means it's all day.

619
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:40,779
And night?

620
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,849
Well, at night I'm
just going to go home.

621
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:44,916
What are you going to do there?

622
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:45,851
Watch TV.

623
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,457
That's a pretty bathing suit.

624
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:52,424
Thank you.

625
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,230
Yeah.

626
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,598
Look at that girl running.

627
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,399
God.

628
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:03,869
Yep.

629
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:08,540
Won't your voice get sore?

630
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,008
Your throat muscles?

631
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,477
Won't your throat get
a little bit tender?

632
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:14,079
No, I just drink a lot of tea.

633
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,416
I drink a lot of chamomile tea.

634
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:21,620
I knew a girl one time who
was drinking a lot of tea.

635
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,755
She was always pissing green.

636
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,691
It was always green her piss.

637
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,230
I think I just saw a dolphin.

638
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,030
Really?

639
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:32,864
Yeah.

640
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,932
Where?

641
00:35:34,032 --> 00:35:37,569
It was out there by
that chick surfing.

642
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:39,004
That's my friend.

643
00:35:39,104 --> 00:35:39,971
Oh, yeah?

644
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:40,972
What's her name?

645
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,474
Sarah.

646
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,976
Sarah.

647
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,780
Dolphins are real
sexual animals.

648
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,848
I don't think so.

649
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:52,050
They are.

650
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,754
I think they're
more like humans.

651
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:56,722
Exactly.

652
00:35:56,822 --> 00:36:00,025
Well, I mean,
they're just smart.

653
00:36:00,125 --> 00:36:01,126
I think they're smart.

654
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,094
I don't think
they're that smart

655
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:05,096
Or they'd be walking around...

656
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,097
They don't have legs.

657
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,766
Having food and shit.

658
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,134
You know what I mean?

659
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,236
No.

660
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:11,503
That's how you prove
that they were smart.

661
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,939
No, they rescue humans.

662
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,907
What the fuck is that?

663
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,876
They rescue humans.

664
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,346
They're like
water bound lassie?

665
00:36:20,446 --> 00:36:21,613
What the fuck is this?

666
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:22,814
Kind of.

667
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:23,682

668
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,150

Nice to meet you.

675
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:32,824
Yeah.

00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:33,625
My pleasure.

677
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:34,526
How are you?

678
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:35,427
- Uh, OK.
- I'm good.

679
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:36,362
I'm good.

680
00:36:36,462 --> 00:36:38,697
You doing some
surfing out there?

681
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:40,332
Yeah, trying to.

682
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,401
I'm a boogie boarder.

683
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,702
Oh, yeah?

684
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:47,406
Yeah, It's like two or three
times harder than surfing.

685
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,174
I do body surfing, too.

686
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,877
But boogie boarding is
kind of my speciality.

687
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,245
Right.

688
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:55,347
GRAHM: You'll have to come out
here sometime and watch me.

689
00:36:55,447 --> 00:37:01,152
It's hard, though, like my
muscle's get all ripped up.

690
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:02,521
I get all swollen.

691
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:04,290
Maybe we should get going.

692
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,324
What are you guys going to do?

693
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:06,658

00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,360
Oh, yeah?

Suit hard to get out of?

696
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,664
I can't get out
of it fast enough.

697
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,999
KRISTY: Yeah.

698
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:16,802
GRAHM: That's the cool thing
about boogie boarding, too.

699
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,136
I don't even wear a suit.

700
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,508
KRISTY: Yeah.

701
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:23,942
OK.

702
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,377
Yeah.

703
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:26,545
Do you want me to
get your towel?

704
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:27,613
Sure, thanks.

705
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:28,714
You want me to help
you carry anything?

706
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:31,149
KRISTY: No.

707
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:31,950
I'll see you around.

708
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,818
KRISTY: Yeah.

709
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:33,619
Yeah.

710
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,053
KRISTY: Maybe.

711
00:37:35,153 --> 00:37:36,087
Nice to know you.

712
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,561
That man was strange.

713
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,030

think he's following me.

like to come up front.

I said before, I just

Want to get, um, a sense
of what you sound like,

755
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,548
What your style is.

756
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:51,216
Style is very important.

you'd like to sing.

a very strong style.

766

And, um, I think perhaps...
And this is just a suggestion

767
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:26,918
And it's part of learning...
That perhaps if you, um,

768
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:30,188
It sounds like you're coming
a little bit from here.
