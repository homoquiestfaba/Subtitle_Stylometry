1
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:29,068
The old woman remembered
a swan she had bought...

2
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:32,908
many years ago in Shanghai
for a foolish sum.

3
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,079
"This bird," boasted
the market vendor...

4
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,414
"was once a duck that
stretched its neck...

5
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,579
in hopes
of becoming a goose.

6
00:00:41,655 --> 00:00:45,921
And now look.
It is too beautiful to eat."

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,764
Then the woman and the swan
sailed across an ocean...

8
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:57,270
many thousands of li wide...

9
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:00,670
stretching their necks
toward America.

10
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:09,875
On her journey
she cooed to the swan...

11
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,046
"In America I will have
a daughter just like me.

12
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:17,215
But over there, nobody will say
her worth is measured...

13
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,691
by the loudness
of her husband's belch.

14
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:26,564
Over there, nobody will
look down on her...

15
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:31,037
because I will make her speak
only perfect American English.

16
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:42,549
And over there, she will always be
too full to swallow any sorrow.

17
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:52,087
She will know my meaning
because I will give her this swan...

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,221
a creature that became more
than what was hoped for."

19
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,174
But when she arrived
in the new country...

20
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:11,507
the immigration officials
pulled the swan away from her...

21
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:13,842
leaving the woman
fluttering her arms...

22
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:17,715
and with only one swan
feather for a memory.

23
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:27,993
For a long time now,
the woman had wanted...

24
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:30,188
to give her daughter
the single swan feather...

25
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:34,860
and tell her, "This feather
may look worthless...

26
00:02:34,936 --> 00:02:37,370
but it comes from afar
and carries with it...

27
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:40,407
all my good intentions."

28
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,840
- Hi!
- Oh, Jennifer! Oh, hi!

29
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:50,008
- Hi, June.
- Hi.

30
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:53,383
Yeah, I want-- That's it.
How are you, June?

31
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:04,997
...the official line
of scrimmage. No gain.

32
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:09,627
- Come on, do or die.
Right here. Come on, do or die!
- Come on!

33
00:03:09,736 --> 00:03:12,170
- All right, all right,
they're lining up for a pass!
- A pass, man!

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,674
- It's a pass! Here we go, baby!
- Fourth and seven.

35
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,504
- Here we go. Come on!
- Oakland.

36
00:03:16,576 --> 00:03:18,340
All right, all right,
here we go! Here we go!

37
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:21,506
- Yes. Yes. Yes!
- Yeah!

38
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,675
Yes! I told you, man!
I told you!

39
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:28,848
Yeah, you owe me five bucks!

40
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:33,325
Every morning,
"Wave, Wave, Waverly-a!"

41
00:03:35,096 --> 00:03:37,689
I do not sound like--
She's saying I sound like my--

42
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,699
I do not sound like my mother.
How could I be like my mother?

43
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:44,169
- And you started--
- She said that too.

44
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:45,865
- She is right, you know.
This kind of vegetable...
- What?

45
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:47,532
- Don't put Chinese cabbage in the salad.
- has to be, has to be boiled.

46
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:50,701
- I always use Chinese cabbage--
- It's bitter.

47
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,372
- Mmm, Dad, that smells good.
- Thanks.

48
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:56,883
- No! No!
- It will fall apart!
- Someone help me now.

49
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,181
- I can't believe they're still arguing.
- Come on, picture time!

50
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,382
- Picture time! Picture time!
All right, picture time now.
- Waverly, Waverly loves it!

51
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,187
- Aunt Rose! Rose!
- Rose! Rose! Rose!

52
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,457
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Picture, picture.
- We're ready.

53
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:12,623
- Come on.
- Oh! June.
-June. Come here.

54
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,963
- Come on, June!
- Get over here!
- Get over here!

55
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,971
-Get over here!
-Come on!
-Oh, no, that's all right, Lena.

56
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:20,632
- Come on!
- It's all right.
- No, really.

57
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:24,199
- Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Go on!
- Come on, right now.

58
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:27,644
-June, come closer, darling. Come closer.
- All right, enough.

59
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:31,776
- Enough. Time to take the picture now.
- Come on, girls.

60
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:33,978
All right, let me check your hair.
Okay, it looks nice.

61
00:04:34,055 --> 00:04:36,649
- Now smile naturally, Ma.
- I always do, Waverly.

62
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:38,987
- You look beautiful.
- No, you don't. Do a nice, friendly one.

63
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,995
- You look younger all the time.
How is that?
- I give you my good skin.

64
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:44,326
- Really? You promise?
- You will look like me when you are older.

65
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,490
- Yes.
- Come close.
- I'm close, Mom.

66
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:48,966
- But don't crush my hair.
- Say cheese.
- I won't.

67
00:04:49,036 --> 00:04:51,971
- Cheese!
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

68
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,973
Ying Ying, take this.

69
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:18,660
-My mother died four months ago.
-...$9.99.

70
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:23,500
I realized for the first time,
they wanted me to take my mother's place.

71
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:29,341
So I sat down on the East,
where things begin...

72
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,345
with my mother's best friends.

73
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:46,016
My mother started the Joy Luck Club,
having met all these women in church.

74
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:48,788
Auntie An Mei...

75
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,262
Auntie Lindo...

76
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,526
Auntie Ying Ying.

77
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,694
For 30 years,
these women feasted...

78
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,704
forgot past wrongs,
laughed and played...

79
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:03,141
lost and won
and told the best stories.

80
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:05,302
Each week
they hoped to be lucky...

81
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:07,677
and that hope
was their only joy.

82
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:13,584
Their connection with each other
had more to do with hope...

83
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,781
than joy or luck.

84
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:22,555
- You win like your mother?
- Uh, I only played once...

85
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,656
- with some Jewish friends in college.
- Hmph! Jewish mah-jong.

86
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:30,396
Not the same thing.
Entirely different.

87
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,598
Now, Chinese mah-jong
very tricky.

88
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:37,336
You have to watch
what everybody throw out...

89
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:40,107
and you keep all this
in your head.

90
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:45,850
And if nobody play well...

91
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,355
then the game is just like
Jewish mah-jong: no strategy.

92
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:53,519
You American girls
play Chinese, Jewish.

93
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:56,687
What's the difference?

94
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,994
Oh.

95
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,762
They were worried.
In me, they see their own daughters.

96
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:05,237
Just as ignorant of all
the hopes and dreams...

97
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,968
our mothers brought
to this country.

98
00:07:16,684 --> 00:07:19,949
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
No talking in Chinese.

99
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,454
- Huh?
- How do I know you're not cheating?

100
00:07:22,523 --> 00:07:24,615
- We would not cheat.
- You don't know, but not we.
- Ah.

101
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:29,129
You don't know, but we are your auntie,
and we are very honest people.

102
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:32,324
- We will not cheat you.
- Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

103
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,144
Hey, June, why you not
take the piano home?

104
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,680
You only one who play.

105
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:55,487
When I was nine years old...

106
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,490
my mother's version
of believing in me...

107
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,151
was believing that
I could be anything...

108
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:02,821
anything she wanted;

109
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:06,923
the best piano prodigy
this side of China.

110
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,307
I never practiced.

111
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,310
Lucky for me, old Mr. Chong
couldn't tell the difference.

112
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,437
He'd gone stone-deaf
over the years.

113
00:08:29,456 --> 00:08:32,893
Me and Beethoven,
we both hear it in our head!

114
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:44,828
Okey-dokey.
Now, how many sharps...

115
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:46,998
how many flats?

116
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:49,508
- What key are we in?
- Z major.

117
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,101
- What? Good.
- Z major!

118
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:57,538
Now, for the recital...

119
00:08:57,618 --> 00:09:00,245
more feeling...

120
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:02,948
more gusto!

121
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:15,563
I'm a girl and by me
that's only great

122
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:19,600
I am proud that
my silhouette is curvy

123
00:09:19,673 --> 00:09:21,663
When I was young,
Auntie Lindo...

124
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,609
was my mother's
best friend and archenemy.

125
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:28,114
Their weapons of choice
were comparing their children.

126
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:30,115
Mom was sick of hearing
Auntie Lindo brag...

127
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:34,620
about her daughter Waverly, who
was Chinatown's chess champion.

128
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:37,520
That night Mom figured
I'd redeem her...

129
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,618
- with my international piano debut.
- I ask my daughter...

130
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:44,129
"Help me carry grocery."

131
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:46,927
She think this too much ask.

132
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,801
All day long she play chess.

133
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,205
I dust off all her trophy.
Appreciate me? No.

134
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,799
You lucky you don't have
the same problem.

135
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:01,644
My problem
worser than yours.

136
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:04,479
If I tell June
time to wash dish...

137
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:07,486
she hear nothing but music.

138
00:10:07,554 --> 00:10:10,490
It's like you can't stop
this natural talent.

139
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:15,018
Being a girl

140
00:10:26,673 --> 00:10:30,041
Until that night,
I didn't believe I was a prodigy.

141
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,048
Twerp.

142
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:48,691
In fact, I used to go out of my way
to prove my mother wrong...

143
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:51,355
that I wasn't cut out
to be the best anything...

144
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:54,059
I could only be me.

145
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,298
It was incredible. It was like my hands
were possessed by Mozart.

146
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,501
And everybody could see this,
could hear this.

147
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:06,909
I was a genius.
I had been discovered.

148
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,345
And then I heard it.

149
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:48,053
Maybe they didn't notice.

150
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:52,717
Bravo! Bravo!
Encore! Well done!

151
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,673
Here we come
Walkin' down the street

152
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:11,677
- After the talent show fiasco...
- Get the funniest looks from

153
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:16,182
- I figured I never had
to play the piano again.
- Everyone we meet

154
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,514
- 4:00. Turn off TV.
- Hey, hey, we're the Monkees

155
00:12:18,585 --> 00:12:20,849
- Practice piano time.
- People say we monkey around

156
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,684
- I couldn't believe what she
was saying. Like I was...
- But we're too busy singin'

157
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:27,852
- supposed to go through the
same torture again. Forget it.
- To put anybody down

158
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,361
- What I say? 4:00.
- We're just tryin' to be friendly

159
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:33,024
-Come and watch us sing and play
-I'm not going to play any more.

160
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,591
- Why should I?
- We're the young generation

161
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:38,365
- What did you say?
- And we've got something to say

162
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:40,873
I'm not your slave.
This isn't China.

163
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,602
You can't make me.

164
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,668
- Get up!
- No! No, I won't.

165
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,847
No!

166
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:55,719
No! No, I won't.

167
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,554
You want me to be someone I'm not!
I'll never be the kind of daughter
that you want me to be!

168
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:04,791
There be two kinds of daughter:
obedient or follow own mind.

169
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,629
Only one kind of daughter
could live in this house:

170
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,465
- obedient kind.
- Then I wish I wasn't your daughter!

171
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:13,198
I wish you weren't my mom!

172
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:18,474
Too late to change this.

173
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:22,981
That's when I remembered
what we could never talk about.

174
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,984
Then I wish I were dead...

175
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,851
like them, the babies
that you killed in China!

176
00:13:32,058 --> 00:13:34,754
My mother had once told me
this strange story...

177
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,797
what happened
to her in China.

178
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:42,164
She said she was going to Chungking
to meet the man who was her husband.

179
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:47,469
That was the first time I ever heard
she was married before my father.

180
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:51,500
She barely had time to grab
her babies, twin girls.

181
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:55,344
That was the first time
I heard she had other babies.

182
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:07,820
I always try to picture
in my mind what really happened...

183
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,830
but she would never explain.

184
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:13,331
She would only say by the time
she reached Chungking...

185
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,333
she had lost everything.

186
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,166
And I said,
"Wait, what do you mean 'everything'?

187
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,967
What happened
to those babies?"

188
00:14:23,243 --> 00:14:27,839
There were so many things about
my mother I never understood.

189
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:32,750
This is the only one
I never forgave.

190
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,220
The babies.

191
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:38,224
You know?
Two babies?

192
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:42,352
The babies? We all thought
that the babies had died.

193
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:45,226
- But last month at a church picnic--
- You know...

194
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,826
two babies your mother leave
on the roadside, in wartime?

195
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:53,566
It's miracle,
but we find them.

196
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,576
Yes! Can you imagine?
They still alive!

197
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,578
What are you saying?
They're alive?

198
00:15:00,647 --> 00:15:03,581
I think your mother
always want to find them...

199
00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:05,583
her long-cherished wish.

200
00:15:05,652 --> 00:15:07,778
So after she died,
we tried for her;

201
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:12,120
- writing, writing, writing.
- "My--"

202
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,660
- This is from them, those babies?
- Ah, no baby anymore.

203
00:15:20,366 --> 00:15:22,664
They're alive!

204
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:29,134
Oh, what does it say?
What does it mean?

205
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:33,043
It say--
See here?

206
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:35,943
They are very glad--
No, no, no, no, no.

207
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:39,451
Overjoyed beyond belief...

208
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,682
at last find you,
their little sister.

209
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:51,822
And they say--
See here?

210
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,335
How sad, how very sad...

211
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:57,836
too late to meet their mother...

212
00:15:57,904 --> 00:16:01,341
now she no longer in this world.

213
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:04,475
Yes, yes.

214
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:07,138
It says--
See here?

215
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:09,477
You must come to China
and meet them...

216
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:13,542
and tell them
all about their mother.

217
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,589
What could I tell them?

218
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:20,149
I didn't know anything
about her. She was--

219
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:23,321
- She was my mother.
- What do you mean?
Tell them how smart she was...

220
00:16:23,397 --> 00:16:25,331
- Your mother is your voice.
- how kind she was.

221
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,926
- Everyone love her.
- How sincere, how hard-working she was.

222
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:31,765
- And the excellent dishes she cooked.
- Even better than mine.

223
00:16:31,837 --> 00:16:34,671
And how beautiful she sang.
Don't you remember?

224
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,268
How can a daughter
not know her own mother?

225
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:44,350
You're right.
I will tell them.

226
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:48,717
I-I should.
I want to.

227
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:58,894
June? June.

228
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:02,833
What you thinking?

229
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:05,929
Oh, those babies,
of course. The twins.

230
00:17:07,641 --> 00:17:10,439
I can't believe I'm actually
going to meet them.

231
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:18,884
How sad they must have been
when you told them Mom died.

232
00:17:21,153 --> 00:17:23,280
That must have been the hardest
letter for you to write.

233
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,893
Oh, peanut bowl empty.

234
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:33,624
Oh! Oh, I'll get us some.

235
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:39,161
All this time never
telling her the truth.

236
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:42,674
- Must tell her today.
- How can you not tell her?

237
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:46,008
How can I tell her what
the letter really say?

238
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:49,276
Then she never go to China,
never go to see her sister.

239
00:17:49,348 --> 00:17:52,807
Am I right?
Yes, of course.

240
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:57,821
Lindo, I still think it's wrong.

241
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,268
It's so sad for those babies.

242
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:12,634
How could Suyuan
give them up?

243
00:18:14,508 --> 00:18:17,772
To lose a mother so young...

244
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:21,940
to wonder why.

245
00:18:22,015 --> 00:18:24,744
Even to this day I wonder...

246
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,980
how my own mother
could give me up.

247
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:35,118
That day...

248
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:38,961
when I was only
four years old...

249
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:42,297
I came upon a meeting...

250
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,997
that would change
my life forever.

251
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:46,630
Come here quick.

252
00:18:46,705 --> 00:18:48,037
Come here.

253
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:52,979
Huang Tai Tai,
this is my daughter.

254
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:54,637
Come here, Lindo.

255
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:55,839
Come over here.

256
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,508
Come to Mama.

257
00:18:57,584 --> 00:19:00,484
Don't keep Huang Tai Tai waiting.

258
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,948
She looks like a brat.

259
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:08,289
She's usually very obedient.

260
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:09,884
She's just shy today.

261
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,968
I didn't know it, but that day
my mother made a promise:

262
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:21,405
- that when I became 1 5, I would
go live in this woman's house...
- She looks so skinny.

263
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:24,635
Don't go by her looks.

264
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:28,670
Look at that lucky face.

265
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:30,647
She'll give you many grandsons.

266
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:36,383
and fulfill the old matchmaker's
guarantee to have many sons...

267
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:40,324
- with a husband
I had never met before.
- Come here! Come here!

268
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:43,294
Have Huang Tai Tai
take a closer look at you.

269
00:19:51,238 --> 00:19:53,205
Stop stuffing yourself!.

270
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:57,467
No girl should eat so fast.

271
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:05,017
For the next ten years...

272
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:09,488
my mother treated me as if
I already belonged to Huang Tai Tai.

273
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,762
Look at those dirty spots!

274
00:20:22,935 --> 00:20:26,201
Who would want such a dirty
daughter-in-law?

275
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:28,173
Always be careful.

276
00:20:28,275 --> 00:20:31,368
Otherwise when you go
to Huang Tai Tai's...

277
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,344
she will disapprove of you.

278
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,843
My mother did not say these things
because she didn't love me.

279
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:42,046
She said these things...

280
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:45,386
so she would not wish
for something...

281
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,618
that was no longer hers.

282
00:21:19,392 --> 00:21:21,484
And then one day...

283
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,826
my mother said our whole family
was moving to the south.

284
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:29,299
Everyone except me.

285
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:59,356
Remember...

286
00:21:59,432 --> 00:22:01,457
when you see Huang Tai Tai...

287
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:04,559
act happy.

288
00:22:06,573 --> 00:22:09,371
Really, you are very lucky.

289
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:21,172
The marriage ceremony has begun.

290
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:26,115
Bride and groom,
pay respect to each other.

291
00:23:26,185 --> 00:23:28,518
Pay respect to the ancestors.

292
00:23:31,357 --> 00:23:34,087
Be blessed with prosperity!

293
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:39,490
Be blessed with many sons!

294
00:23:58,117 --> 00:24:03,317
That night I would meet
my husband for the first time;

295
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,155
the one who would
control my destiny...

296
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:11,686
decide whether
I was happy or not.

297
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:26,674
This one moment would decide
for my whole life...

298
00:24:26,746 --> 00:24:29,009
whether fear would rule...

299
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,710
or I would.

300
00:24:33,086 --> 00:24:38,353
I decided
underneath I knew who I was.

301
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:42,384
I promised myself
never to forget.

302
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:31,575
I have prayed to the gods
many days for you...

303
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:34,169
so that you were not too ugly...

304
00:25:34,247 --> 00:25:35,805
or too old.

305
00:25:40,653 --> 00:25:43,816
I must have prayed too hard.

306
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,656
Ha! Scared you to death!

307
00:25:59,137 --> 00:26:00,695
I am the husband.

308
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:03,866
I make all the decisions.

309
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:06,570
You sleep on the floor.

310
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,343
Do it! Do it now!

311
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:42,714
The next few years,
I tried to accept my life...

312
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:45,375
to act like an obedient wife.

313
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:52,215
Every night I made
Huang Tai Tai special soup...

314
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,726
good for mother-in-laws.

315
00:26:54,794 --> 00:26:57,387
Still, she was not pleased.

316
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:00,789
Where are my grandsons?

317
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,726
My son says...

318
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:07,739
you often refuse...

319
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:10,173
to sleep with him.

320
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:13,076
What kind of a wife are you?

321
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:32,895
You sleep on your side.

322
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:42,936
After that,
I slept with my husband.

323
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,771
Every night
I slept with him...

324
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:50,213
just like brother and sister.

325
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,191
Where are my grandsons?

326
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:10,166
Huh?

327
00:28:10,236 --> 00:28:13,568
My son says he's planted enough
seeds in you to fill a basket.

328
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,836
Plenty for
ten thousand grandsons!

329
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:18,375
It's all your fault!

330
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:19,740
Always running around...

331
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:23,042
letting my son's seeds
spill out.

332
00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:24,208
From now on...

333
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:26,147
you lie in bed all day.

334
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:27,446
Lie down!

335
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:29,679
Lie down!

336
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,747
Until my grandson comes!

337
00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:33,222
Do you hear me?

338
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:35,692
Disgusting little thing!

339
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,490
Close all the windows!

340
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,230
Feel this.
I'm pregnant.

341
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,291
That's impossible.

342
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,201
It's yours!

343
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:05,249
What'd I tell you?

344
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:07,877
She's like this all the time.

345
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:21,659
What the hell's happening?

346
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,896
What's wrong?

347
00:30:25,938 --> 00:30:28,498
Tell me quick!

348
00:30:29,509 --> 00:30:31,135
It's so scary.

349
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,700
It's too terrible to say.

350
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:35,373
I had a bad dream.

351
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,608
Our ancestors came to me!

352
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:39,309
So angry!

353
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:42,115
They told me if Tyan-yu stays...

354
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,781
in this marriage...

355
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:46,518
he will die.

356
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,787
What's this bullshit?

357
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:51,260
What a stupid girl
to have bad dreams!

358
00:30:52,397 --> 00:30:53,990
The ancestors said...

359
00:30:54,066 --> 00:30:56,296
if the matter is
not settled immediately...

360
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:57,836
they will begin...

361
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:00,531
the cycle of destruction!

362
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:03,039
There are three signs, he said.

363
00:31:03,108 --> 00:31:06,044
First, he has drawn a spot
on Tyan-yu's back.

364
00:31:06,112 --> 00:31:09,240
And this spot will eat away
Tyan-yu's flesh.

365
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:13,080
Just as it ate away
our ancestor's face.

366
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:18,220
The same mole I had seen
during all those nights...

367
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,781
of sleeping just like
brother and sister.

368
00:31:22,662 --> 00:31:26,496
Next, our ancestor
touched my mouth.

369
00:31:26,566 --> 00:31:27,827
Our ancestor said...

370
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,891
if I don't leave this marriage...

371
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:32,528
all my teeth will fall out.

372
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:35,938
But how could I leave
this family I love so much?

373
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:39,239
I live and die
for this family.

374
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,915
The open spot in my mouth...

375
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:50,922
where a rotted tooth
fell out four years ago.

376
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:54,348
Our ancestor also said
this girl here...

377
00:31:54,426 --> 00:31:56,451
is Tyan-yu's
true spiritual wife...

378
00:31:56,528 --> 00:32:00,226
already growing his son!

379
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:01,788
It's true!

380
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:06,964
To prove it our ancestor
planted the seed in her womb.

381
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:09,633
Already ripe in one day.

382
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:11,676
Ah Ping!
Come over here!

383
00:32:12,778 --> 00:32:14,176
Come over here!

384
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:28,223
If you don't believe me,
ask the matchmaker.

385
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:31,888
I told them the matchmaker
had made the wrong match...

386
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:35,229
on purpose,
just for money.

387
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:51,182
Matchmaker, how could you?

388
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,411
How could you?

389
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:55,146
Well...

390
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:57,246
mistakes happen in Heaven.

391
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:58,983
The hell with this!

392
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,457
Get out!

393
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,824
All of you!

394
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:09,529
Huang Tai Tai
got her grandson.

395
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:12,866
The servant girl
got her marriage.

396
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,713
I got a rail ticket to Shanghai.

397
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,880
So, you see, I still kept
my promise to my mother.

398
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,019
But years later, things
were somewhat different...

399
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:39,064
with my daughter
Waverly's wedding.

400
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:42,730
- Ma, it's me.
- Oh, Waverly-a.

401
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:45,236
- You already at the beauty parlor?
- No.

402
00:33:45,304 --> 00:33:47,738
- No?
- No, I'm-- I have a headache.

403
00:33:47,807 --> 00:33:50,070
Headache?
You have a headache?

404
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:52,234
So you cannot keep
your promise to your mother?

405
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,576
- Ma!
- No, don't come.
Why should I want you to come...

406
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,912
when all you're telling me
you don't want to come?

407
00:33:57,983 --> 00:34:01,317
- Ma, that's not what I said!
- What's wrong with the way I look now?

408
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,480
I just go to wedding
with old hair.

409
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,825
Shit!
She always does this!

410
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:13,731
My mom always does this.

411
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:16,824
Whatever I say,
whatever I do...

412
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:18,994
whatever I think...

413
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:22,597
she always has
the perfect countermove.

414
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:26,809
As if she had been
the chess champion.

415
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:33,818
Even at that age,
I knew I had an amazing gift:

416
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,184
this power,
this belief in myself...

417
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:40,190
to be better than anyone else.

418
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:43,422
If someone was bigger than me,
older than me, it didn't matter.

419
00:34:45,097 --> 00:34:49,500
And if they were mean,
I could make'em sorry.

420
00:34:58,277 --> 00:35:00,302
Checkmate.

421
00:35:09,521 --> 00:35:12,115
Congratulations.
She was--

422
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:15,284
It was the only part
of my life, to this day...

423
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,795
where I trusted myself
completely.

424
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,467
- Very good.
- Thank you.

425
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:26,130
- Good work.
- Thank you.
- You did good.

426
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:29,298
- I was safe there.
- Very nice job.
- We've been very lucky.

427
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:32,344
- I still cry remembering that.
- Thank you.

428
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,407
- You not see Life magazine?
- No.

429
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:43,648
I told my daughter, "Use your
horses to run over the enemy."

430
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:45,985
- One fine day
- She won very quickly this way.

431
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,992
- Oh, good.
- You'll look at me
- Bye-bye.

432
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:50,324
- Bye-bye.
- Say bye-bye.
- And you will know

433
00:35:50,396 --> 00:35:54,331
- Our love was meant to be
- Bye.
- Bye.

434
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,164
- One fine day
- Hi.

435
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,670
- You're gonna want me for your girl
- Ah, Mrs. Chew!

436
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:05,472
Oh, you know my daughter,
Waverly Jong, chess champion?

437
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:09,639
- The arms I long for will open wide
- Smart girl! Bye.

438
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:12,809
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- And you'll be proud to have me

439
00:36:12,885 --> 00:36:15,945
I wish you wouldn't do that,
telling everyone I'm your daughter.

440
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:18,989
- What you mean? You so ashamed
to be with your mother?
- One fine day

441
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:22,050
- You're gonna want me for your girl
- It's not that.

442
00:36:22,128 --> 00:36:24,824
It's just that it's so...

443
00:36:24,896 --> 00:36:27,990
- embarrassing, that's all.
- What? Embarrassed you be my daughter?

444
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:30,661
- I'll keep waiting and some day, darling
- That's not what I said.

445
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:33,864
- Then what you say? Look at me!
- You'll come to me

446
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:36,668
- When you want to settle down
- Look at me!

447
00:36:36,742 --> 00:36:40,336
- Oh, one fine day
- Why do you have to use me to show off?

448
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,005
- We'll meet once more
- If you want to show off...

449
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:46,710
- And then you'll want the love
- then why don't you learn to play chess?

450
00:36:46,784 --> 00:36:48,719
You threw away before

451
00:36:48,786 --> 00:36:51,186
One fine day

452
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:55,159
You're gonna want me
for your girl

453
00:36:58,264 --> 00:37:02,257
Waverly! Waverly!
You come back!

454
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:08,773
About time.
Boy, are you in trouble.

455
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:15,913
Sit down. Eat.

456
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:22,617
This girl not have
concerning for us.

457
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:25,987
We not concerning
this girl.

458
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:54,952
I'm never gonna
play chess again!

459
00:37:55,019 --> 00:37:57,614
You can't make me!

460
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,123
You can torture me
all you want...

461
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,626
I still won't.

462
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:19,400
Did you hear what I said?

463
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:47,505
For months I kept expecting Ma
to beg me to play chess again...

464
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:52,340
but she never mentioned it,
as if I had never played at all.

465
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:06,920
Guess what? I've decided
to play chess again.

466
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,954
You think it is so easy.

467
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:17,128
One day quit,
next day play.

468
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:20,137
Everything for you
is this way.

469
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:25,768
So smart, so easy, so fast.

470
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:35,811
Not so easy anymore.

471
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:49,666
What she said,
it was like a curse.

472
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:55,172
This power I had,
this belief in myself...

473
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:58,402
I could actually
feel it draining away.

474
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:05,807
I could feel myself
becoming so ordinary.

475
00:40:07,585 --> 00:40:12,353
All the secrets I once saw...

476
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:15,824
I couldn't
see them anymore.

477
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,920
All I could see was--

478
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:24,025
were my mistakes,
my weaknesses.

479
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:26,469
The best part of me just...

480
00:40:26,538 --> 00:40:29,996
- Check.
- disappeared.

481
00:40:38,617 --> 00:40:41,347
But I can't put it all
on my mother.

482
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,684
I did it to myself.

483
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,360
I never played chess again.

484
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,235
She needs a cut
and a perm, Trevor.

485
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:02,797
And this color of hers, it's from that
cheap black dye she's been using at home.

486
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,811
God forbid she'd pay to have
anything professionally done.

487
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,972
Why I should pay?
What for?

488
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:15,485
Why I should pay 90 dollar?
To act like you? So important.

489
00:41:15,554 --> 00:41:18,853
Go to fancy barber
with torn-up jeans.

490
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:24,719
Darlene, we need
a shampoo here.

491
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:33,333
I mean, I even married
a Chinese guy to please her.

492
00:41:33,405 --> 00:41:36,498
He was gorgeous.
He gave her a granddaughter.

493
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:40,135
But was she satisfied?

494
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:44,876
When we got divorced, she got
all upset like it was my fault.

495
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:50,355
I just want to show you
something. It's upstairs.

496
00:41:50,422 --> 00:41:53,322
- Watch out for Shoshana's toys.
- And when I finally started dating again...

497
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:56,327
when I tried to hint
to her about Rich...

498
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,590
that we were
living together--

499
00:42:00,398 --> 00:42:02,663
How could she not notice?

500
00:42:02,733 --> 00:42:07,295
This was not going to go away,
even with her silent treatment.

501
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:15,072
This is what
I wanted to show you.

502
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:20,010
You know Rich,
the guy I told you about?

503
00:42:20,085 --> 00:42:24,681
I don't know why he got it for me.
It's really never cold enough to wear.

504
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:26,655
You wanna try it?

505
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:35,498
This not so good.

506
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:38,034
Only leftover strips.

507
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:41,367
See? Fur too short.

508
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,340
No long hairs.

509
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:51,048
How can you
criticize a gift?

510
00:42:51,115 --> 00:42:54,244
He gave this to me
with all his heart.

511
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,644
That's why I told you.
Not so good.

512
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:03,652
I wasn't going to let her
get away with it this time...

513
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:07,960
making me feel bad about Rich,
the love of my life...

514
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:10,762
who treated me
like I was perfect.

515
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:15,135
Well, aren't you going
to say anything else?

516
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:18,141
What I should say?

517
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,646
About the apartment,
about this!

518
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:24,614
And this!

519
00:43:25,884 --> 00:43:28,478
Or this!

520
00:43:28,554 --> 00:43:31,523
All of this!

521
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:42,498
We're here!
Where is everybody?

522
00:43:42,568 --> 00:43:47,300
The next week I brought Rich to Mom's
birthday dinner, sort of a surprise present.

523
00:43:47,371 --> 00:43:51,364
I figured she was going to have
to accept Rich, like it or not.

524
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:55,503
- Oh, Rich, this is my father.
- How ya doin'?

525
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:57,514
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- How are you?
- I'm good, thank you.

526
00:43:57,583 --> 00:44:00,143
And, Ma, this is Rich.

527
00:44:01,686 --> 00:44:06,487
Great to meet you.
Boy, something smells wonderful.

528
00:44:06,557 --> 00:44:09,322
I guess we came to the right
place, huh? Here you are.

529
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:14,490
You know, Waverly has been telling me
that you are the best cook.

530
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:25,199
I think maybe we got her.

531
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:33,278
So many spots on his face.

532
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:36,014
Of course, the night
was still young.

533
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:40,023
Thank god I already prepped
him on the Emily Post of Chinese manners.

534
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:42,219
Hi, Uncle.
How are you?

535
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:49,255
Actually, there were a few things
I forgot to mention.

536
00:44:52,204 --> 00:44:54,331
Uh, let me make a toast.

537
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:56,635
- He shouldn't have had that second glass...
- Here's to...

538
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,699
- when everyone else had
had only half an inch...
- everyone in the family.

539
00:44:58,777 --> 00:45:01,974
just for taste.

540
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:08,545
Shrimp. My favorite.

541
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:11,315
He should have taken only
a small spoonful of the best dish...

542
00:45:11,389 --> 00:45:13,824
until everyone had
had a helping.

543
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:16,121
He has good appetite.

544
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:22,626
He shouldn't have bragged
he was a fast learner.

545
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:31,505
But the worst was when Rich
criticized my mother's cooking...

546
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:34,010
and he didn't even know
what he had done.

547
00:45:34,579 --> 00:45:36,672
As is the Chinese
cook's custom...

548
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:40,411
my mother always
insults her own cooking...

549
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:43,579
but only with the dishes
she serves with special pride.

550
00:45:43,655 --> 00:45:47,181
This dish not salty enough.

551
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:50,023
No flavor.
It's too bad to eat.

552
00:45:50,094 --> 00:45:53,427
But please--

553
00:45:53,498 --> 00:45:55,864
Oh!

554
00:45:55,934 --> 00:45:58,925
That was our cue
to eat some...

555
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:01,768
and proclaim it
the best she'd ever made.

556
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,103
You know, Lindo...

557
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:06,940
all this needs is
a little soy sauce.

558
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:09,275
Oh! Uh, oh.

559
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:21,784
So, how'd your mom react when
you told her about the wedding?

560
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,827
It never came up.

561
00:46:25,664 --> 00:46:28,632
How come?

562
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:31,668
She'd rather get
rectal cancer.

563
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:35,802
Oh.

564
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:41,641
Ma, a soft wave for body.
What do you think?

565
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:43,646
Look, she doesn't
want it too short.

566
00:46:43,715 --> 00:46:46,148
Otherwise it'll be
too tight for the wedding.

567
00:46:46,217 --> 00:46:50,085
And we don't want it
looking too weird or kinky.

568
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:54,318
Isn't that right, Ma?
Not too kinky?

569
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:58,487
Why does my daughter think
she's translating English for me?

570
00:46:58,563 --> 00:47:01,088
Maybe I don't go.

571
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:03,690
- What do you mean?
- Maybe I don't go to your wedding.

572
00:47:03,768 --> 00:47:06,704
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- Maybe already ridiculous.

573
00:47:06,771 --> 00:47:10,264
Hair too ridiculous for
future husband's family.

574
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:18,007
I could see her face
looking at me...

575
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:20,643
but not seeing me.

576
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,210
She was ashamed...

577
00:47:23,288 --> 00:47:26,621
so ashamed
to be my daughter.

578
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:31,829
Ma?

579
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:36,027
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

580
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:38,967
Nothing.
I-- I only thinking...

581
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:42,505
thinking about my mother...

582
00:47:42,574 --> 00:47:45,974
how much I wanted
to be like her.

583
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:52,014
Your mother?

584
00:47:52,083 --> 00:47:54,016
She told me...

585
00:47:54,085 --> 00:47:57,543
all the hopes
she had for me...

586
00:47:57,621 --> 00:48:01,284
words I would never forget.

587
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,989
You're so lucky.

588
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:07,496
You don't have ears like mine.

589
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:11,860
You'll have a better life!

590
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:15,498
But listen carefully
to what is calling.

591
00:48:17,275 --> 00:48:19,835
Can you feel in your heart...

592
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:23,175
what I am saying?

593
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:27,617
Will you always keep it there?

594
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:34,891
You know...

595
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,019
after today...

596
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:41,463
I will never...

597
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:48,132
give you any more advice.

598
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:54,141
In my memory, my--

599
00:48:54,211 --> 00:48:57,612
my mother very
important to me...

600
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,672
just like her words.

601
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:06,282
Easy to appreciate memory.

602
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:18,135
Ma?

603
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:22,797
Why don't you like Rich?

604
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:30,943
It's Rich you afraid
I not like?

605
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:33,143
If I don't like your Rich...

606
00:49:33,217 --> 00:49:36,449
I act polite, say nothing;

607
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,648
let him have big cancer...

608
00:49:38,722 --> 00:49:41,157
let my daughter be a widow.

609
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,992
I like Rich.
Of course I do...

610
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:52,498
to allow him to marry
such a daughter.

611
00:50:00,577 --> 00:50:02,670
You don't know--

612
00:50:04,581 --> 00:50:07,346
You don't know the power
you have over me.

613
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:11,847
One word from you,
one look...

614
00:50:11,922 --> 00:50:14,356
and I'm...

615
00:50:14,425 --> 00:50:17,862
four years old again,
crying myself to sleep.

616
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:22,193
Because nothing I do...

617
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:29,539
can ever, ever please you.

618
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:48,050
Now--

619
00:50:48,126 --> 00:50:51,289
Now you make me happy.

620
00:51:09,414 --> 00:51:12,349
Look, look, look, look, Ma, Ma,
Auntie Ying, Auntie Ying.

621
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:14,681
- I did it.
- Rich!

622
00:51:14,753 --> 00:51:17,516
Where'd it go?
Did it go inside?

623
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:22,356
-Oh, come on.
-God, I can't take you anywhere.

624
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:25,021
- So where'd it end up?
- Oh, Lena, do you want to eat?

625
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:27,427
- Thank you.
- Oh, here's a fork.

626
00:51:27,498 --> 00:51:29,295
- Okay.
- Well, I'm trying.

627
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:32,358
- Ta-la!
- Oh!

628
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:35,929
Wow! That's beautiful, huh?

629
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:37,998
Oh, oh.

630
00:51:39,443 --> 00:51:41,878
What's the matter,
guest of honor?

631
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:44,005
- Yeah!
- Should eat more!

632
00:51:44,114 --> 00:51:46,378
Should eat more!
Too skinny!

633
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:49,045
Well, I thought you said
I was getting fat.

634
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,056
- Auntie An Mei said that.
Why you always confusing us?
- Oh, look.

635
00:51:53,123 --> 00:51:55,990
June so happy,
going to China...

636
00:51:56,061 --> 00:51:58,358
see her sisters at last.

637
00:51:59,998 --> 00:52:04,798
Only steamed.
Can't get you fat.

638
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:14,436
How terrible for Suyuan...

639
00:52:14,512 --> 00:52:16,445
to lose your babies...

640
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:20,507
never know if they
are alive or dead.

641
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:32,527
Only one thing's worse.

642
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,065
I was only 1 6.

643
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:52,512
Stop looking!

644
00:53:04,394 --> 00:53:06,454
Ying Ying.

645
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,958
Ying Ying.

646
00:53:19,777 --> 00:53:21,574
Open the watermelon!

647
00:53:39,963 --> 00:53:41,954
Dog fart!

648
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:56,670
Ah, Lin Xiao--

649
00:53:59,117 --> 00:54:00,981
Lin Xiao.

650
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:24,724
After that, everything
like this dream.

651
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,059
Our wedding...

652
00:56:28,398 --> 00:56:30,628
our son.

653
00:56:55,967 --> 00:56:58,458
Honored guests!

654
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:00,231
Thank you for coming.

655
00:57:00,304 --> 00:57:03,273
I have persuaded
the famous diva, Miss Bai Yen...

656
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,309
- to sing in honor of my son.
- There he was...

657
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:09,072
with his opera singer.

658
00:57:09,146 --> 00:57:12,876
This was not
his first conquest...

659
00:57:12,949 --> 00:57:17,284
only the first I permitted
myself to recognize.

660
00:57:18,655 --> 00:57:23,889
By then I knew what kind
of man I had married:

661
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,793
happiest when he was cruel.

662
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:50,585
Let me have him.

663
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,385
He became forgetful.

664
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:02,827
Don't touch it!

665
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:06,858
So forgetful he had not
returned by the next morning.

666
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:10,565
Or the next evening.

667
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:25,784
Who's this?

668
00:58:25,856 --> 00:58:28,791
This person is a whore.

669
00:58:28,858 --> 00:58:31,418
Just like you.

670
00:58:41,072 --> 00:58:42,039
My son!

671
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:44,731
My son!

672
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:46,800
Listen to that voice!

673
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:49,344
Strong...

674
00:58:49,413 --> 00:58:51,710
like his father!

675
00:58:57,954 --> 00:59:00,753
Look at you!
Disgusting!

676
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:03,588
You make me sick!

677
00:59:22,012 --> 00:59:23,980
Clean up this mess!

678
00:59:28,284 --> 00:59:30,809
You hear me?

679
01:00:13,797 --> 01:00:16,733
My whole life turned
in this moment.

680
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,396
If I had left him
or killed him...

681
01:00:20,471 --> 01:00:24,532
I would not have lost
the one thing that mattered.

682
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,025
My mind kept repeating
a single thought.

683
01:00:53,103 --> 01:00:55,867
He had taken from me
my innocence...

684
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:00,206
my youth, my heart,
everything.

685
01:01:12,456 --> 01:01:16,722
So I took from him
the only thing I could.

686
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:44,018
My baby was so light
in my arms...

687
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:48,047
because his little spirit
had flown away.

688
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,391
And with his,
my spirit had also gone.

689
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:14,715
Years later,
I moved to America.

690
01:02:14,784 --> 01:02:19,414
But what I had done in China
was always with me.

691
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:25,724
In time, I remarried...

692
01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:29,231
and I had a daughter.

693
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:32,701
But Lena had no spirit...

694
01:02:32,769 --> 01:02:35,500
because I had none
to give her.

695
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,601
Mommy?

696
01:02:51,956 --> 01:02:54,481
Mommy?

697
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:56,684
Are you hungry yet?

698
01:03:06,971 --> 01:03:09,371
Mom?

699
01:03:12,476 --> 01:03:17,038
Mommy, please answer me.

700
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:28,916
Mommy? Oh, Mom!

701
01:03:28,992 --> 01:03:31,358
As I was growing up...

702
01:03:31,427 --> 01:03:34,487
there were times when Mom
went through these bad spells.

703
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:39,324
She often seemed
scared and sad.

704
01:03:40,003 --> 01:03:43,440
But she would never
talk about it...

705
01:03:43,507 --> 01:03:48,001
except to say that she had been
married to a bad man in China.

706
01:03:58,856 --> 01:04:02,188
Over the years
Mom got better...

707
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:07,195
although it seemed like all her fears
turned into worries about me.

708
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:12,260
So now that I'm married...

709
01:04:12,369 --> 01:04:15,702
and she's visiting
our new house...

710
01:04:15,773 --> 01:04:19,208
I hope she can finally
be happy for me.

711
01:04:31,221 --> 01:04:34,452
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

712
01:04:39,228 --> 01:04:41,719
He's very nice to me.

713
01:04:43,067 --> 01:04:46,900
Nice.

714
01:04:46,969 --> 01:04:50,336
Nice. Very nice.

715
01:04:51,574 --> 01:04:54,271
- Oh, Mom? Mom--
- What's this?

716
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:56,335
Why don't you, uh, rest
in the living room?

717
01:04:56,413 --> 01:04:58,347
I'll make you
some tea, okay?

718
01:04:58,414 --> 01:05:01,349
I've got some
chrysanthemum tea.

719
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,478
- What's this writing?
- Mom! It's nothing.

720
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:10,081
You know. It's just
the things we share.

721
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:12,525
At least that's what
Harold calls it.

722
01:05:12,596 --> 01:05:15,360
Sharing.
Everything 50-50.

723
01:05:15,431 --> 01:05:18,697
So our love is always equal.

724
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:22,603
- The irony is, I was the one
who started it that way.
- Let's see--

725
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,639
- Forty-one dollars.
- Oh, total?

726
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:33,148
Each. What?
You don't have enough?

727
01:05:33,217 --> 01:05:36,983
No, it's, uh...

728
01:05:37,054 --> 01:05:39,614
it's just, uh, I was
never very good at math.

729
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:43,489
So what if I had a salad
and he had three courses?

730
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,755
We were equals.

731
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:48,195
Except that I work in his firm
and he pays himself...

732
01:05:48,297 --> 01:05:52,597
seven times more
than he pays me.

733
01:05:52,668 --> 01:05:56,161
Seven and a half.

734
01:05:56,239 --> 01:05:59,835
And then last year, when we
finally decided to get married...

735
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:05,472
we agreed: love, yes;
false dependencies, no.

736
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:08,916
With most everything,
we keep track of what we spend...

737
01:06:08,985 --> 01:06:11,818
then split it 50-50.

738
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:14,949
Of course we agreed early on
not to include personal stuff...

739
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:19,427
like my tampons and
feminine hygiene spray...

740
01:06:19,496 --> 01:06:21,521
and his shaving lotion
and foot powder.

741
01:06:21,597 --> 01:06:24,465
Honey, isn't there
a generic brand of cat food?

742
01:06:24,534 --> 01:06:28,972
I mean, do they know the difference?
For crying out loud, $34.76.

743
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,530
But we still have these
philosophical arguments...

744
01:06:31,608 --> 01:06:33,838
about the gray areas.

745
01:06:33,911 --> 01:06:36,777
Like magazines I subscribe to,
which he reads...

746
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:39,246
but only because they're there.

747
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:43,219
And the cat.

748
01:06:43,286 --> 01:06:46,722
Even the goddamn cat's fleas.

749
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:49,724
You gave her to me
as a birthday gift.

750
01:06:49,793 --> 01:06:53,387
And now you want me to pay
to get rid of her fleas?

751
01:07:10,146 --> 01:07:12,411
Ice cream you don't share.

752
01:07:12,481 --> 01:07:15,177
You don't eat ice cream.

753
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,688
Ever since that time you got sick on
strawberry and chocolate flavor together.

754
01:07:18,755 --> 01:07:20,746
I remember.

755
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:26,052
Now you must pay for half
of his ice cream?

756
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:31,396
Why do you do this?

757
01:07:31,467 --> 01:07:34,494
Lena?

758
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,766
Hmm.

759
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:42,177
Lena, when you buy charcoal,
you have to buy lighter fluid.

760
01:07:42,246 --> 01:07:46,342
Don't you know that yet? Do I
have to remind you every time?

761
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:50,581
Lena cannot eat ice cream.

762
01:07:51,755 --> 01:07:55,054
What?

763
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:57,719
What are we talking about?

764
01:07:57,793 --> 01:08:01,355
It's true. I've hated
ice cream all my life.

765
01:08:01,431 --> 01:08:03,797
I don't touch the stuff.

766
01:08:04,967 --> 01:08:08,994
Well, I assumed you were always
trying to diet or something.

767
01:08:09,106 --> 01:08:14,271
Oh, yes, she's lost so much weight
you can't see her anymore.

768
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:18,447
Hmm.

769
01:08:19,815 --> 01:08:23,546
One million dollars,
and the walls are still crooked.

770
01:08:23,654 --> 01:08:28,250
- It's bad luck.
- Harold wanted to keep it
that way for the effect.

771
01:08:28,324 --> 01:08:34,024
For effect? A person has to lie here
thinking she's in a coffin?

772
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:39,761
- Oh!
- Careful. It's not too sturdy.

773
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:42,360
Harold made it back in college.

774
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:45,134
Why do you keep it?

775
01:08:45,207 --> 01:08:49,439
You put one more thing on top
and everything falls down.

776
01:08:49,512 --> 01:08:51,673
Do you need anything else?

777
01:08:53,516 --> 01:08:56,384
- No.
- Okay.

778
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:01,046
No. Nothing.

779
01:09:02,492 --> 01:09:04,926
...competition.

780
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:07,759
- What is a drag race?
- What an idiot!

781
01:09:07,831 --> 01:09:10,925
Regatta, not drag race!

782
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:14,265
I don't believe this guy!

783
01:09:14,337 --> 01:09:16,328
It's cold.

784
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,266
Excuse me?

785
01:09:20,844 --> 01:09:24,574
I said, would you close
the window, please? It's cold.

786
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:42,694
That's right for 1,000.
Takes you to an even 6,000.

787
01:09:42,765 --> 01:09:44,699
Oh, there's the bell
for "Final Jeopardy."

788
01:09:44,768 --> 01:09:47,703
You have 30 seconds to come up
with the right question.

789
01:09:55,578 --> 01:09:59,810
Honey, move.
What's goin' on?

790
01:09:59,882 --> 01:10:03,216
I don't think you should get credit
for your ice cream anymore.

791
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:09,385
Fine. You got it.
End of discussion.

792
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:18,039
Why do you have to be
so goddamn fair?

793
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:23,548
Now at 10,400, but you're
still not in the lead. Nancy--

794
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:26,709
Just what is this
about exactly?

795
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:32,584
I don't know.
Maybe everything.

796
01:10:33,225 --> 01:10:36,661
The way we account for
everything. What we share, what
we don't share. I'm sick of it.

797
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:41,325
Adding things up, subtracting. Making it
come out even when it's not. I'm sick of it.

798
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:45,097
You're the one
who wanted the cat!

799
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:49,334
- What are you talking about?
- All right.

800
01:10:49,408 --> 01:10:52,468
If you think I'm being unfair,
we'll both pay for the fleas.

801
01:10:53,078 --> 01:10:56,241
This is not about fleas.
That is not the point.

802
01:10:56,315 --> 01:11:00,012
Then, please, tell me.

803
01:11:00,085 --> 01:11:02,815
What is the point?

804
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:12,290
I-- I just think that we
need to change things.

805
01:11:12,364 --> 01:11:16,198
We need to think about
what this marriage is based on...

806
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:21,166
- not this balance sheet.
- Well, I know what
our marriage is based upon.

807
01:11:21,273 --> 01:11:24,037
And if you don't,
then you better think about it...

808
01:11:24,109 --> 01:11:27,010
before you start
to change things.

809
01:11:35,053 --> 01:11:38,489
All around this house,
I see the signs.

810
01:11:38,557 --> 01:11:41,958
My daughter looks,
but she does not see.

811
01:11:42,027 --> 01:11:45,121
This is a house that
will break into pieces.

812
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:55,832
Mom?

813
01:12:14,259 --> 01:12:17,251
It's not too late.

814
01:12:17,329 --> 01:12:21,857
All my pains, my regrets...

815
01:12:21,934 --> 01:12:25,028
I will gather them together.

816
01:12:32,544 --> 01:12:37,345
My daughter will hear me calling,
even though I've said no words.

817
01:12:39,351 --> 01:12:41,444
She will climb the stairs
to find me.

818
01:12:41,553 --> 01:12:44,522
- Mom?
- She will be scared...

819
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:48,959
because at first
her eyes will see nothing.

820
01:12:49,027 --> 01:12:51,291
- She will feel in her heart...
- Mom?

821
01:12:51,363 --> 01:12:55,163
- this place where she hides her fears.
- Mom?

822
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:57,668
She will know...

823
01:12:57,736 --> 01:13:02,833
I am waiting
like a tiger in the trees...

824
01:13:02,908 --> 01:13:07,709
now ready to leap out
and cut her spirit loose.

825
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,718
Mom.

826
01:13:20,993 --> 01:13:24,554
Do you know what you want?

827
01:13:26,932 --> 01:13:29,992
I mean, from him.

828
01:13:32,905 --> 01:13:34,805
Respect.

829
01:13:36,775 --> 01:13:39,107
Tenderness.

830
01:13:39,177 --> 01:13:41,668
Then tell him now.

831
01:13:41,747 --> 01:13:46,343
And leave this lopsided house.

832
01:13:46,418 --> 01:13:51,446
Do not come back
until he give you those things.

833
01:13:51,523 --> 01:13:55,323
With both hands open.

834
01:14:00,532 --> 01:14:02,500
I can't..

835
01:14:04,269 --> 01:14:07,432
Losing him does not matter.

836
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:12,705
It is you who will be found... 

837
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:17,846
and cherished.
