It is impossible for me to play with
neighborhood children -

215
00:22:26,200 -> 00:22:29,800
- The interaction would have been
particularly important to me.

216
00:22:30,000 -> 00:22:33,000
That is why I'm so heavy.

217

Do not mess me and let it.

endangered seabirds.

Look at those dead ducks!

309
00:33:26,200 -> 00:33:32,200

333
00:37:22,400 -> 00:37:26,200
- I do not sleep.
- Could be worse.

334
00:37:27,400 -> 00:37:31,400
See now though, Kevin.

335
00:37:36,800 -> 00:37:40,000
Do you think you will ever
our parents?

336
00:37:42,000 -> 00:37:47,000
Sometimes I wonder if that would be nice
if they were there.

337
00:37:48,200 -> 00:37:52,600
I think of them at Christmas
and when I need money for beer.

338
00:37:53,000 -> 00:37:56,600
You do not remember
what we had.

339
00:37:56,800 -> 00:38:03,200
It was a bohemian life,
Wash the brook where the armpits.

340
00:38:04,400 -> 00:38:07,400
Visiting grandpa and grandma
was a lot easier.

341
00:38:10,200 -> 00:38:16,800
I probably should tell you
Buckles t‰dist‰ few things.

342
00:38:20,800 -> 00:38:24,000
He was
angel descended from heaven.

343
00:38:26,400 -> 00:38:32,000
He had a magnificent buttocks.
They were like carved marble.

344
00:39:32,000 -> 00:39:34,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

345
00:39:36,400 -> 00:39:38,800
Thank you,
veditte that our car from the field.

346
00:39:39,000 -> 00:39:44,400
It is quite difficult to cultivate a field, if
It is autollinen students.

347
00:39:44,600 -> 00:39:46,600
That is what it is.

348
00:39:48,600 -> 00:39:51,400
What
fat guy on your problem?

349
00:39:51,600 -> 00:39:56,200
- He is sleeping sickness.
- Is the name kaatok‰nni?

350
00:40:00,800 -> 00:40:08,000
We are very grateful
but we must continue the journey.

351
00:40:08,400 -> 00:40:12,200
You need to bark to dig
my wallet in my hand.

352
00:40:12,800 -> 00:40:14,000
What?

353
00:40:14,400 -> 00:40:19,000
If you can afford to drive there
car, you can pay for the towage.

354
00:40:21,600 -> 00:40:24,000
Jesus. He wants money.

355
00:40:25,000 -> 00:40:27,000
Graduation TIME
22 HOURS AND 1 MINUTE

356
00:40:35,000 -> 00:40:39,800
There should be someone pikkutie.
Map where it is?

357
00:40:40,800 -> 00:40:44,000
- It is a good question.
- Where is Miss Bunny?

358
00:40:44,400 -> 00:40:48,600
- What the rabbit. Where is the map?
- Miss Bunny can be anywhere!

359
00:40:49,000 -> 00:40:54,600
- Maybe it wanted freedom.
- What is your job was, Dink?

360
00:40:54,800 -> 00:40:58,200
My job?
What was your job then?

361
00:40:58,600 -> 00:41:02,800
I take care of transportation Dave
with. We do not have wasted the car.

362
00:41:03,000 -> 00:41:05,200
Hukkasiko Kevin tools? No.

363
00:41:05,400 -> 00:41:08,000
- Do you have a sword in it, Kevin?
- What do you mean?

364
00:41:08,400 -> 00:41:13,400
Tools have been
all the time in the boot.

365
00:41:14,200 -> 00:41:16,400
Rabbits!

366
00:41:17,600 -> 00:41:20,000
We will find it a magical forest.

367
00:41:20,200 -> 00:41:25,000
Look around you, Dave. Map is
longitude and latitude just cause.

368
00:41:25,400 -> 00:41:31,400
We can look for it for months just
in vain. Dink, now is not honest.

369
00:41:31,600 -> 00:41:37,000
- You think that we will find a forest?
- I think so.

370
00:41:37,200 -> 00:41:40,800
Do you think so
or are you unsure?

371
00:41:50,600 -> 00:41:52,600
I am sure the matter.

372
00:41:55,000 -> 00:41:56,200
Car!

373
00:42:02,600 -> 00:42:09,400
- We drove just a bit misleading.
- It was only a small error.

374
00:42:22,800 -> 00:42:26,000
- Get in the car.
- Vain of this map was destroyed.

375
00:42:26,200 -> 00:42:27,600
Get in the car!

376
00:42:32,800 -> 00:42:39,400
- The meter is 99.007.
- We are 1.5 km away.

377
00:43:08,600 -> 00:43:12,000
I do not see
no magical marihuanamets‰‰.

378
00:43:28,000 -> 00:43:30,200
They have been here.

379
00:43:36,800 -> 00:43:39,000
Here is nice.

380
00:43:41,600 -> 00:43:43,800
Is it nice here?

381
00:43:45,000 -> 00:43:48,000
Is.

382
00:43:51,400 -> 00:43:54,400
Look around you.

383
00:43:54,600 -> 00:43:58,200
We are aware of.
This is not beyond reach.

384
00:44:00,000 -> 00:44:05,200
I have the divorce between
and the company, which decomposes into the hands.

385
00:44:07,800 -> 00:44:12,800
You might not realize
I am a bad, fucked.

386
00:44:14,600 -> 00:44:16,800
Dink, you just take care of the rabbit.

387
00:44:18,200 -> 00:44:22,000
You again try to retrieve it,
that muussasit rabbit.

388
00:44:22,400 -> 00:44:29,200
Kevin, do you think you're gay?
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:44:30,200 -> 00:44:32,200
- And you ...
- Take it easy.

390
00:44:32,400 -> 00:44:38,800
Please yourself! If this fails,
you can go back to college.

391
00:44:39,000 -> 00:44:43,400
I can not.
This is my life!

392
00:44:46,000 -> 00:44:48,200
Look carefully!

393
00:44:51,400 -> 00:44:53,400
This is my life.

394
00:45:35,200 -> 00:45:41,800
What direction now run?
Dick, can you help us?

395
00:45:43,600 -> 00:45:45,000
Dick.

396
00:45:46,400 -> 00:45:49,400
Okay, okay, okay.

397
00:45:49,600 -> 00:45:54,600
Sun sets due west.
We have to go south.

398
00:45:57,200 -> 00:46:02,000
- South is over there. We go there?
- It suits me.

399
00:46:02,400 -> 00:46:06,400
- Sounds good.
- Turn left then.

400
00:46:06,600 -> 00:46:08,000
Damn it!

401
00:46:28,400 -> 00:46:32,000
This may not be true.

402
00:46:47,000 -> 00:46:53,400
Put leaves and grass, tires
below, so you get out of it.

403
00:46:55,000 -> 00:46:57,000
There is one tree, old man.

404
00:47:05,200 -> 00:47:11,200
Before you start to the ropes,
Would you like to draw little cloud?

405
00:47:11,400 -> 00:47:13,600
I have here a bottle tˆmpsy‰kin.

406
00:47:14,000 -> 00:47:17,600
T÷MPSY: fox urine
AND VƒLJƒHTƒNYTTƒ beer

407
00:47:17,800 -> 00:47:21,600
That is the best offer throughout the day.

408
00:47:21,800 -> 00:47:24,400
Then we went to.

409
00:47:30,400 -> 00:47:33,400
S‰tk‰st‰ Thank you, old pal.

410
00:47:33,600 -> 00:47:39,200
I thank you for the ride.
My Name is otherwise Oldman.

411
00:47:39,400 -> 00:47:45,800
- Oldman!
- I'm already an old man.

412
00:47:47,200 -> 00:47:49,200
This herb smells good.

413
00:47:49,400 -> 00:47:54,200
I had many years
Ministry of Agriculture jobs.

414
00:47:54,400 -> 00:47:57,200
- I learned to increase their own ruohoni.
- Is this homemade?

415
00:47:57,400 -> 00:48:02,200
Raised by the considerable quantities.
I was pretty good at it.

416
00:48:03,600 -> 00:48:09,800
- This is a very good fag.
- P‰tk‰p‰ well.

417
00:48:10,800 -> 00:48:18,400
That is a bit away from the
1600 ha
<i> Indica sativa. </ i>

418
00:48:20,200 -> 00:48:22,800
Where? Where it is, Oldman?

419
00:48:28,200 -> 00:48:32,200
Surely you do not have nothing
mate friends, waiting?

420
00:48:33,600 -> 00:48:34,800
Per‰mieskavereitako?

421
00:48:35,200 -> 00:48:37,400
I like boys.

422
00:48:39,400 -> 00:48:45,000
- I think I'll keep the boys.
- Do you like?

423
00:48:45,200 -> 00:48:50,200
I'm happy
and I am quite all.

424
00:48:50,600 -> 00:48:53,000
Damn it.

425
00:49:06,600 -> 00:49:10,200
I do not see any
magical marihuanamets‰‰.

426
00:49:13,200 -> 00:49:17,800
- Here we go, boys.
- Oh, Jesus, after all.

427
00:49:41,200 -> 00:49:47,400
There it is now.
Eve is responsible for all this.

428
00:49:49,400 -> 00:49:51,400
Hello, darling.

429
00:49:54,200 -> 00:49:59,800
You will have 2 hours 40 minutes
Control of time before the flight.

430
00:50:01,000 -> 00:50:03,800
- Do something to get to work.
- Come on.

431
00:50:29,600 -> 00:50:36,000
- What was here before?
- Waist was a 76-cm.

432
00:50:36,200 -> 00:50:41,600
- Belly was like a washboard.
- I meant this forest.

433
00:50:47,600 -> 00:50:53,200
At night we drove to Nebraska
huoriin drinking and to address.

434
00:50:53,600 -> 00:50:57,600
- Then I got gonorrhea.
- I did not mean exactly that.

435
00:51:10,200 -> 00:51:14,200
We do not cultivate marijuana
drug.

436
00:51:14,400 -> 00:51:21,000
It was for medical research.
We wanted to help people.

437
00:51:21,200 -> 00:51:27,000
The irony is that the Government, which
farmers for this good purpose -

438
00:51:27,200 -> 00:51:30,200
- Did this criminal activity.

439
00:51:30,400 -> 00:51:35,600
Now, when I see how much hemp
here is still in the woods -

440
00:51:36,000 -> 00:51:41,200
- I just moved.

441
00:51:41,400 -> 00:51:46,000
I wish I could return to those times.

442
00:51:46,200 -> 00:51:52,000
If I get to heaven,
I hope it will remind of this.

443
00:51:54,600 -> 00:52:00,000
- Thank you for bringing us here.
- Thank you, boys.

444
00:52:01,000 -> 00:52:05,000
You can earn a very
fruits of our labor -

445
00:52:05,400 -> 00:52:08,600
- As long as you remember to tell;
what you saw here.

446
00:52:09,800 -> 00:52:15,800
Indeed, I can swear that this
forest has not been here much longer.

447
00:52:20,000 -> 00:52:21,800
Was all.

448
00:52:31,400 -> 00:52:36,400
<i> "Take it, yes it is enough </ i>

<i> 68 s‰tk‰‰ perch </ i>

450
00:52:49,200 -> 00:52:53,400
Take it properly.
Do not suck out of this than vuohentissi‰.

451
00:52:53,600 -> 00:52:58,000
Drink a Spanish style.
We need to sing lead vocals at the end.

452
00:52:59,000 -> 00:53:05,400
<i> "Take it, yes it is enough </ i>
<i> 38 s‰tk‰‰ perch </ i>

453
00:53:08,200 -> 00:53:14,000
<i> "Take it, yes it is enough </ i>
<i> None s‰tk‰‰ perch </ i>

454
00:53:25,200 -> 00:53:30,000
Damn it, Oldman.
The first time I heard the whole song.

455
00:53:31,800 -> 00:53:33,400
Is not it great?

456
00:53:33,600 -> 00:53:38,400
There's a bend behind
There are two motorcycle policemen.

457
00:53:38,800 -> 00:53:41,600
- Police?
- Exactly. Back straight, Dickie.

458
00:53:47,200 -> 00:53:50,600
- Hello. How's it going?
- Do you have a problem?

459
00:53:51,000 -> 00:53:55,600
Do you know where to find a workshop,
which is open on Sundays?

460
00:53:56,000 -> 00:53:57,800
Spring broke.

461
00:54:00,000 -> 00:54:05,000
Mule kicked him when he
was 12 and he never recovered.

462
00:54:05,200 -> 00:54:10,200
- Their kilsan from a workshop.
- Raahustamme ago tiehemme.

463
00:54:21,200 -> 00:54:27,800
Well, Dickie, to me is enough.
You can leave me here.

464
00:54:29,400 -> 00:54:31,800
- Are you sure?
- Yeah sure.

465
00:54:44,800 -> 00:54:48,800
You have a post office box number.
, Write sometimes.

466
00:54:50,800 -> 00:54:55,400
You are awesome guys.
I had a lot of fun. Thank you.

00:54:57,400 -> 00:55:02,800
- I wish I could go with you.

468
00:55:03,000 -> 00:55:05,800

Oklahoma Police
ROLLING CONTROL POINT

474
00:56:15,000 -> 00:56:21,200
- Good luck in prison, boys.
- Shut up. We may overcome this.

475
00:56:21,600 -> 00:56:25,600
Do not be upset.
We need to invent something.

476
00:56:25,800 -> 00:56:31,200
Think! We could hide marin
and retrieve it later.

477
00:56:31,400 -> 00:56:35,800
- Go into the queue for that.
- I can not.

478
00:56:36,000 -> 00:56:39,200

This is a car.

482
00:56:52,000 -> 00:56:57,000
- Car engine overheated.
- Happiness, that has become worse.

483
00:56:57,200 -> 00:56:59,800
- Really?
- What did you say?

484
00:57:00,800 -> 00:57:03,400
Nothing. Thank you, officer.

485
00:57:06,200 -> 00:57:11,200
If we get behind that hill,
we can drive back.

486
00:57:11,600 -> 00:57:15,200
Then look for someone arable
and hidden stuff.

487
00:57:27,000 -> 00:57:29,800
- Good morning, officer.
- Driver's license and registration.

488
00:57:30,200 -> 00:57:33,800
- What is it about?
- This is a routine inspection.

489
00:57:34,000 -> 00:57:39,600
- You look very nice today.
- Excuse me?

You have a fine physique.

Are you not a bit old

492

Jellyfish, look.

493
00:58:02,000 -> 00:58:05,800
- My God.
- Is that a flower of Oklahoma ID?

494
00:58:06,000 -> 00:58:10,200
- Maybe. We are Kansas.
- This is not Kansas, Dorothy.

495
00:58:10,600 -> 00:58:14,200
Go elsewhere in Oklahoma.
Hurry up!

496
00:58:16,800 -> 00:58:18,000
Let's go.

Graduation TIME

498
00:58:30,000 -> 00:58:31,600
Arrest respiration.

499
00:58:38,800 -> 00:58:42,000
- Come out and open up your luggage.
- With pleasure.

500
00:58:42,200 -> 00:58:48,000
- I can not walk.
- Come out and move away.

501
00:58:48,200 -> 00:58:49,800
Hurry up!

502
00:58:53,800 -> 00:58:55,800
You help physical barriers.

503
00:58:56,000 -> 00:58:58,800
- What a cool box is?
- Rabbits.

504
00:58:59,000 -> 00:59:03,200
Shit they are no rabbits,
but the dog snacks. Out of there.

505
00:59:03,400 -> 00:59:05,000
Hurry up!

506
00:59:12,200 -> 00:59:15,200
Can I
having learned from that book?

507
00:59:15,600 -> 00:59:19,400
- Shut off the car and trust!
- Okay.

508
00:59:20,600 -> 00:59:25,400
I read a story where the suspect
had built a car marijuana.

509
00:59:25,600 -> 00:59:28,200
Do you live alone?

510
00:59:33,800 -> 00:59:36,200
- Nothing?
- No.

511
00:59:37,400 -> 00:59:43,200
- Has it been like that before?
- Last year, when the time over it.

512
00:59:49,200 -> 00:59:52,000
Toipuuko your dog?

513
00:59:56,800 -> 01:00:00,600
Listen now.
Here is something suspicious.

514
01:00:01,000 -> 01:00:06,200
It has never been looking for him
exhausted without finding anything.

515
01:00:06,400 -> 01:00:10,000
You seem to conceal something.

516
01:00:11,200 -> 01:00:13,800
No secret you something?

517
01:00:23,400 -> 01:00:27,400
- I'm gay.
- What?

518
01:00:27,600 -> 01:00:33,400
I'm gay
and I teach them my friends homoiksi.

519
01:00:38,000 -> 01:00:39,400
Are you gay?

520
01:00:39,800 -> 01:00:46,000
This is the case. I'm homompi
as Gay sapiens.

521
01:00:47,400 -> 01:00:53,000
- Or gay? Forgetting for a moment.
- Will there we go now?

522
01:01:03,800 -> 01:01:07,600
Johan is a man. That funny looking
said that he is gay.

523
01:01:07,800 -> 01:01:13,000
- Did you see the big guy 'legs?
- That this is how?

524
01:01:47,400 -> 01:01:50,400
Graduation TIME
ONE MINUTE

525
01:01:56,600 -> 01:02:01,800
- Good luck, red devil.
- Thank you, Dick.

526
01:02:12,800 -> 01:02:15,400
<i> Please leave a message. </ i>

527
01:02:15,600 -> 01:02:20,600
<i> Hello, Richard. Here is Becky. </ I>
<i> You're not at home. </ i>

528
01:02:20,800 -> 01:02:25,400
<i> This is a difficult time. </ i>
<i> Perhaps we could talk. </ i>

529
01:02:25,600 -> 01:02:30,600
<i> I'd like to talk. </ i>
<i> Okay. Bye. </ I>

530
01:02:35,000 -> 01:02:39,800
The place is full of policemen,
so it is smoked in the Mari field below.

531
01:02:40,200 -> 01:02:42,600
We have to act.

532
01:02:42,800 -> 01:02:47,800
Waiting only increases the risk that
that stuff gets wet in the rain.

533
01:02:48,000 -> 01:02:49,800
<i> Not again! </ i>

534
01:02:50,800 -> 01:02:53,000
Someone even if the goat can eat it.

535
01:03:00,800 -> 01:03:07,800
Kept busy. The place is swarming with
cops and old dirt farmer.

536
01:03:08,000 -> 01:03:12,600
Dividing us into two teams,
with two men.

537
01:03:12,800 -> 01:03:16,800
Dink, keep watch airplanes
event. This does not go long.

538
01:03:21,800 -> 01:03:23,600
There it is arable.

539
01:04:07,200 -> 01:04:10,600
Fortunately, the marijuana is not here.

540
01:04:11,600 -> 01:04:15,600
My business failed
for several reasons -

541
01:04:16,000 -> 01:04:19,000
- But they were not related to money.

542
01:04:21,600 -> 01:04:28,000
If the marriage fails, it is due to
that I have tried enough.

543
01:04:31,800 -> 01:04:36,400
We met a man,
who hitchhikes across Asia Int.

544
01:04:36,600 -> 01:04:41,800
I've never met
happier people.

545
01:04:42,000 -> 01:04:43,200
This is the case.

546
01:04:49,600 -> 01:04:51,400
Let's go home.

547
01:05:07,000 -> 01:05:08,400
Thank you.

548
01:05:47,000 -> 01:05:50,800
I'm sorry marihuanamets‰st‰.
Maybe next time.

549
01:05:52,200 -> 01:05:57,200
- For the first time will hardly be, Kevin.
- Keep the care of yourselves.

550
01:06:01,600 -> 01:06:06,000
Hopefully, you and Becky's Cases
arranged. I like him.

551
01:06:07,400 -> 01:06:14,200
He made you happy. When
you were happy, were we.

552
01:06:14,400 -> 01:06:18,800
Thank you, boys.
It was nicely said.

553
01:06:40,400 -> 01:06:43,000
Gosh.

554
01:06:46,000 -> 01:06:51,400
- Hey, Dave. Hey, Dick.
- Come on, Bill.

555
01:06:51,600 -> 01:06:57,200
- Why we had to come here?
- Rabbits need a sandbox.

556
01:06:59,200 -> 01:07:03,800
We are not going anywhere
except to the bank.

557
01:07:09,600 -> 01:07:12,000
Bye, Dick.

558
01:07:15,200 -> 01:07:16,800
Hey, guys.

559
01:07:17,000 -> 01:07:20,400
You have
Kansas State Map T-paidassasi.

560
01:07:23,400 -> 01:07:26,200
Can not be true.

561
01:07:28,000 -> 01:07:32,200
Anyone
who buy such T-shirt -

562
01:07:32,400 -> 01:07:37,800
- Sees marihuanamets‰n Oldman,
before it disappears.

563
01:07:38,200 -> 01:07:40,800
When I covered my kuluni -

564
01:07:41,000 -> 01:07:44,200
- We are looking for Oldman -

565
01:07:44,600 -> 01:07:51,200
- And we share with him
50 000 dollars.

566
01:07:51,400 -> 01:07:56,400
- Drat.

567
01:07:56,600 -> 01:07:58,200
It is true.

Making boxes

569
01:08:14,800 -> 01:08:16,800
Listen up, fool.

570
01:08:43,600 -> 01:08:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin soon,
so repeating tasks. Hunter.

571

572
01:08:53,800 -> 01:08:56,800

- Exactly. Dinkadoo?
- I received the money.

01:09:01,200 -> 01:09:03,000

01:09:03,400 -> 01:09:10,000
- Kevin, tell your brew.
- Hot dog gets 50 cents.

576
01:09:10,200 -> 01:09:14,400
Limut cost 25 cents

577
01:09:14,600 -> 01:09:18,400
I, of course, I read about
trip hazards.

578
01:09:18,600 -> 01:09:22,400
Let's go to sell T-shirts.

579
01:09:28,000 -> 01:09:31,200

580

My name is Hunter,

01:10:26,800 -> 01:10:32,200
Who will be interested in it. You
you opened the door, so close it now.

594
01:10:32,400 -> 01:10:36,800
You heard what Madsen said.
Close your mouth and then the door.

595
01:10:37,000 -> 01:10:41,600
Sweet Pea joined the club.
Good morning, Hendrix.

596
01:10:41,800 -> 01:10:45,800
I'm not Hendrix.
My name is ...

597
01:10:47,200 -> 01:10:49,600
Ferdinand.

598
01:10:51,400 -> 01:10:55,200
Wait a minute. Madsen, olepa accurate.

599
01:10:55,600 -> 01:10:59,800
- Ferdinand is one of the code.
- Do not come on now.

600
01:11:00,000 -> 01:11:03,600
Let the just be fun,

01:11:04,000 -> 01:11:07,000
You kuvotatte me.

602
01:11:08,200 -> 01:11:11,200
It's disgusting that the mother will
to walk the same streets as you.

603
01:11:11,400 -> 01:11:14,400
- What is your mother doing?
- Shut up, Mari larva.

604
01:11:14,600 -> 01:11:17,200
Mari Toddler. Great.

605
01:11:19,200 -> 01:11:24,600
You probably wondering why you have not already
Prison pussaamassa asphalt.

606
01:11:24,800 -> 01:11:27,000
Would you like something to drink?

607
01:11:27,200 -> 01:11:32,400
It is due to the fact that
Government wants to conceal information ...

608
01:11:34,200 -> 01:11:39,800
... Which you primitive
turd you are going to sell.

609
01:11:41,800 -> 01:11:45,200
Hello, limupoika,
bring orange juice and ice.

610
01:11:51,400 -> 01:11:54,800
Well, gorilla, siirryh‰n there.

Sit on those chairs.

612
01:11:59,600 -> 01:12:05,200
Oklahoma Police
has told us -

613
01:12:05,400 -> 01:12:09,600
- That you have a map board
Kansas down the country.

614
01:12:09,800 -> 01:12:12,400
I guess we all know,
what countries they are.

615
01:12:12,600 -> 01:12:15,000
This is the case.

616
01:12:15,200 -> 01:12:18,400
It was a rhetorical question,
Smoking boy.

617
01:12:18,600 -> 01:12:25,800
Now you have to press a secret
information on hundreds of T-shirts.

618
01:12:26,200 -> 01:12:31,000
We can not prevent you from

621
01:12:42,200 -> 01:12:46,000
- Who are looking for
this magical marihuanamets‰‰.

622
01:12:46,600 -> 01:12:49,200
Who the hell else is it invented?

623
01:12:49,400 -> 01:12:53,200
Our parents come up with it.
I would say marijuana nirvana.

624
01:12:54,800 -> 01:12:58,200
Please. Hopefully
it is not too much ice.

625
01:12:58,400 -> 01:13:01,000
- Thank you.
- No problem.

626
01:13:03,200 -> 01:13:05,400
She is quite OK.

627
01:13:05,600 -> 01:13:07,400
But ...

628
01:13:07,800 -> 01:13:14,600
If the reserve and bringing into captivity
each hamppuhemmon -

629
01:13:14,800 -> 01:13:20,800
- Which appears to Kansas,
Government has to pay millions.

630
01:13:21,000 -> 01:13:25,000
That is what we drug cops
we will not be permitted.

631
01:13:26,400 -> 01:13:30,800
Sever drug snake's head
and see how it crawls -

632
01:13:31,000 -> 01:13:33,600
- My stool,
blood and limassaan.

633
01:13:33,800 -> 01:13:39,400
It gets the worm in the sand,
before it finally dies.

634
01:13:40,800 -> 01:13:46,200
We are a drug-snake
or those who buy a T-shirt?

635
01:13:46,400 -> 01:13:50,400
Was it a bit too hard
metaphor, pyllypoju?

636
01:13:56,800 -> 01:13:59,400
Let's dance, tyynynpurijat.

637
01:14:21,000 -> 01:14:25,000
What if the first-packaging of goods?
Okay, acid-heads?

638
01:14:32,200 -> 01:14:35,000
Come on, boys.

639
01:14:35,200 -> 01:14:38,800
Here is a document
which you must sign.

640
01:14:40,000 -> 01:14:43,600
Then the rotation is mammon.

Teen couple's proposal at the same time,

642

Do you listen to you? Behold
my eyes when I speak to you.

643
01:14:54,800 -> 01:15:01,400

645
01:15:03,600 -> 01:15:06,600
Do not go, even denied,
in excess of Kansas.

646
01:15:07,000 -> 01:15:12,000
Where would you like to subscribe to Kansas
something, do not do it.

647
01:15:12,200 -> 01:15:14,400
Do not do it.

648
01:15:15,600 -> 01:15:19,400
And do not even uneksiko -

649
01:15:19,600 -> 01:15:25,600
- That you owned in Kansas
business premises or residential property.

650
01:15:25,800 -> 01:15:29,400
- That was already a foregone conclusion.
- It was all in vain.

651
01:15:29,600 -> 01:15:32,400
Those other things are important.

652
01:15:33,200 -> 01:15:35,800
Live according to their

653
01:15:40,600 -> 01:15:42,600
Give it here.

654
01:15:42,800 -> 01:15:47,600
Is that clear, you are Jim Morrison
less cooli disciple?

655
01:15:48,600 -> 01:15:50,000
Okay.

656
01:16:11,800 -> 01:16:14,400
