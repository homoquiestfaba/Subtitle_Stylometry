It is possible that the stealing

It is impossible for me to play with
neighborhood children -

215
00:22:26,200 -> 00:22:29,800
- The interaction would have been
particularly important to me.

216
00:22:30,000 -> 00:22:33,000
That is why I'm so heavy.

217

One of the dirt farmer asked about it,

Do not mess me and let it.

endangered seabirds.

Look at those dead ducks!

309
00:33:26,200 -> 00:33:32,200

00:37:22,400 -> 00:37:26,200
- I do not sleep.
- Could be worse.

334
00:37:27,400 -> 00:37:31,400
See now though, Kevin.

335
00:37:36,800 -> 00:37:40,000
Do you think you will ever
our parents?

336
00:37:42,000 -> 00:37:47,000
Sometimes I wonder if that would be nice
if they were there.

337
00:37:48,200 -> 00:37:52,600
I think of them at Christmas
and when I need money for beer.

338
00:37:53,000 -> 00:37:56,600
You do not remember
what we had.

339
00:37:56,800 -> 00:38:03,200
It was a bohemian life,
Wash the brook where the armpits.

340
00:38:04,400 -> 00:38:07,400
Visiting grandpa and grandma
was a lot easier.

341
00:38:10,200 -> 00:38:16,800
I probably should tell you
Buckles tädistä few things.

342
00:38:20,800 -> 00:38:24,000
He was
angel descended from heaven.

343
00:38:26,400 -> 00:38:32,000
He had a magnificent buttocks.
They were like carved marble.

344
00:39:32,000 -> 00:39:34,200
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

345
00:39:36,400 -> 00:39:38,800
Thank you,

346
00:39:39,000 -> 00:39:44,400
It is quite difficult to cultivate a field, if
It is autollinen students.

347
00:39:44,600 -> 00:39:46,600
That is what it is.

348
00:39:48,600 -> 00:39:51,400
What
fat guy on your problem?

349
00:39:51,600 -> 00:39:56,200
- He is sleeping sickness.
- Is the name kaatokänni?

350
00:40:00,800 -> 00:40:08,000
We are very grateful
but we must continue the journey.

351
00:40:08,400 -> 00:40:12,200
You need to bark to dig
my wallet in my hand.

352
00:40:12,800 -> 00:40:14,000
What?

353
00:40:14,400 -> 00:40:19,000
If you can afford to drive there
car, you can pay for the towage.

354
00:40:21,600 -> 00:40:24,000
Jesus. He wants money.

355
00:40:25,000 -> 00:40:27,000
Graduation TIME
22 HOURS AND 1 MINUTE

356
00:40:35,000 -> 00:40:39,800
There should be someone pikkutie.
Map where it is?

357
00:40:40,800 -> 00:40:44,000
- It is a good question.
- Where is Miss Bunny?

358
00:40:44,400 -> 00:40:48,600
- What the rabbit. Where is the map?
- Miss Bunny can be anywhere!

359
00:40:49,000 -> 00:40:54,600
- Maybe it wanted freedom.
- What is your job was, Dink?

360
00:40:54,800 -> 00:40:58,200
My job?
What was your job then?

361
00:40:58,600 -> 00:41:02,800
I take care of transportation Dave
with. We do not have wasted the car.

362
00:41:03,000 -> 00:41:05,200
Hukkasiko Kevin tools? No.

363
00:41:05,400 -> 00:41:08,000
- Do you have a sword in it, Kevin?
- What do you mean?

364
00:41:08,400 -> 00:41:13,400
Tools have been
all the time in the boot.

365
00:41:14,200 -> 00:41:16,400
Rabbits!

366
00:41:17,600 -> 00:41:20,000
We will find it a magical forest.

367
00:41:20,200 -> 00:41:25,000
Look around you, Dave. Map is
longitude and latitude just cause.

368
00:41:25,400 -> 00:41:31,400
We can look for it for months just
in vain. Dink, now is not honest.

369
00:41:31,600 -> 00:41:37,000
- You think that we will find a forest?
- I think so.

370
00:41:37,200 -> 00:41:40,800
Do you think so
or are you unsure?

371
00:41:50,600 -> 00:41:52,600
I am sure the matter.

372
00:41:55,000 -> 00:41:56,200
Car!

373
00:42:02,600 -> 00:42:09,400
- We drove just a bit misleading.
- It was only a small error.

374
00:42:22,800 -> 00:42:26,000
- Get in the car.
- Vain of this map was destroyed.

375
00:42:26,200 -> 00:42:27,600
Get in the car!

376
00:42:32,800 -> 00:42:39,400
- The meter is 99.007.
- We are 1.5 km away.

377
00:43:08,600 -> 00:43:12,000
I do not see
no magical marihuanametsää.

378
00:43:28,000 -> 00:43:30,200
They have been here.

379
00:43:36,800 -> 00:43:39,000
Here is nice.

380
00:43:41,600 -> 00:43:43,800
Is it nice here?

381
00:43:45,000 -> 00:43:48,000
Is.

382
00:43:51,400 -> 00:43:54,400
Look around you.

383
00:43:54,600 -> 00:43:58,200
We are aware of.
This is not beyond reach.

384
00:44:00,000 -> 00:44:05,200
I have the divorce between
and the company, which decomposes into the hands.

385
00:44:07,800 -> 00:44:12,800
You might not realize
I am a bad, fucked.

386
00:44:14,600 -> 00:44:16,800
Dink, you just take care of the rabbit.

387
00:44:18,200 -> 00:44:22,000
You again try to retrieve it,
that muussasit rabbit.

388
00:44:22,400 -> 00:44:29,200
Kevin, do you think you're gay?
What the hell are you doing?

389
00:44:30,200 -> 00:44:32,200
- And you ...
- Take it easy.

390
00:44:32,400 -> 00:44:38,800
Please yourself! If this fails,
you can go back to college.

391
00:44:39,000 -> 00:44:43,400
I can not.
This is my life!

392
00:44:46,000 -> 00:44:48,200
Look carefully!

393
00:44:51,400 -> 00:44:53,400
This is my life.

394
00:45:35,200 -> 00:45:41,800
What direction now run?
Dick, can you help us?

395
00:45:43,600 -> 00:45:45,000
Dick.

396
00:45:46,400 -> 00:45:49,400
Okay, okay, okay.

397
00:45:49,600 -> 00:45:54,600
Sun sets due west.
We have to go south.

398
00:45:57,200 -> 00:46:02,000
- South is over there. We go there?
- It suits me.

399
00:46:02,400 -> 00:46:06,400
- Sounds good.
- Turn left then.

400
00:46:06,600 -> 00:46:08,000
Damn it!

401
00:46:28,400 -> 00:46:32,000
This may not be true.

402
00:46:47,000 -> 00:46:53,400
Put leaves and grass, tires
below, so you get out of it.

403
00:46:55,000 -> 00:46:57,000
There is one tree, old man.

404
00:47:05,200 -> 00:47:11,200
Before you start to the ropes,
Would you like to draw little cloud?

405
00:47:11,400 -> 00:47:13,600
I have here a bottle tömpsyäkin.

406
00:47:14,000 -> 00:47:17,600
TÖMPSY: fox urine
AND VÄLJÄHTÄNYTTÄ beer

407
00:47:17,800 -> 00:47:21,600
That is the best offer throughout the day.

408
00:47:21,800 -> 00:47:24,400
Then we went to.

409
00:47:30,400 -> 00:47:33,400
Sätkästä Thank you, old pal.

410
00:47:33,600 -> 00:47:39,200

00:47:39,400 -> 00:47:45,800
- Oldman!
- I'm already an old man.

412
00:47:47,200 -> 00:47:49,200
This herb smells good.

413
00:47:49,400 -> 00:47:54,200
I had many years
Ministry of Agriculture jobs.

414
00:47:54,400 -> 00:47:57,200
- I learned to increase their own ruohoni.
- Is this homemade?

415
00:47:57,400 -> 00:48:02,200
Raised by the considerable quantities.
I was pretty good at it.

416
00:48:03,600 -> 00:48:09,800
- This is a very good fag.
- Pätkäpä well.

417
00:48:10,800 -> 00:48:18,400
That is a bit away from the
1600 ha
<i> Indica sativa. </ i>

418
00:48:20,200 -> 00:48:22,800
Where? Where it is, Oldman?

419
00:48:28,200 -> 00:48:32,200
Surely you do not have nothing
mate friends, waiting?

420
00:48:33,600 -> 00:48:34,800
Perämieskavereitako?

421
00:48:35,200 -> 00:48:37,400
I like boys.

422
00:48:39,400 -> 00:48:45,000
- I think I'll keep the boys.
- Do you like?

423
00:48:45,200 -> 00:48:50,200
I'm happy
and I am quite all.

424
00:48:50,600 -> 00:48:53,000
Damn it.

425
00:49:06,600 -> 00:49:10,200
I do not see any
magical marihuanametsää.

426
00:49:13,200 -> 00:49:17,800
- Here we go, boys.
- Oh, Jesus, after all.

427
00:49:41,200 -> 00:49:47,400
There it is now.
Eve is responsible for all this.

428
00:49:49,400 -> 00:49:51,400
Hello, darling.

429
00:49:54,200 -> 00:49:59,800
You will have 2 hours 40 minutes
Control of time before the flight.

430
00:50:01,000 -> 00:50:03,800
- Do something to get to work.
- Come on.

431
00:50:29,600 -> 00:50:36,000
- What was here before?
- Waist was a 76-cm.

432
00:50:36,200 -> 00:50:41,600
- Belly was like a washboard.
- I meant this forest.

433
00:50:47,600 -> 00:50:53,200
At night we drove to Nebraska
huoriin drinking and to address.

434
00:50:53,600 -> 00:50:57,600
- Then I got gonorrhea.
- I did not mean exactly that.

435
00:51:10,200 -> 00:51:14,200
We do not cultivate marijuana
drug.

436
00:51:14,400 -> 00:51:21,000
It was for medical research.
We wanted to help people.

437
00:51:21,200 -> 00:51:27,000
The irony is that the Government, which
farmers for this good purpose -

438
00:51:27,200 -> 00:51:30,200
- Did this criminal activity.

439
00:51:30,400 -> 00:51:35,600
Now, when I see how much hemp
here is still in the woods -

440
00:51:36,000 -> 00:51:41,200
- I just moved.

441
00:51:41,400 -> 00:51:46,000
I wish I could return to those times.

442
00:51:46,200 -> 00:51:52,000
If I get to heaven,
I hope it will remind of this.

443
00:51:54,600 -> 00:52:00,000
- Thank you for bringing us here.
- Thank you, boys.

444
00:52:01,000 -> 00:52:05,000

- As long as you remember to tell;
what you saw here.

446
00:52:09,800 -> 00:52:15,800
Indeed, I can swear that this
forest has not been here much longer.

447
00:52:20,000 -> 00:52:21,800
Was all.

448
00:52:31,400 -> 00:52:36,400

451
00:52:53,600 -> 00:52:58,000
Drink a Spanish style.
We need to sing lead vocals at the end.

452
00:52:59,000 -> 00:53:05,400
<i> "Take it, yes it is enough </ i>
<i> 38 sätkää perch </ i>

<i> None sätkää perch </ i>

454
00:53:25,200 -> 00:53:30,000
Damn it, Oldman.
The first time I heard the whole song.

455
00:53:31,800 -> 00:53:33,400
Is not it great?

456
00:53:33,600 -> 00:53:38,400
There's a bend behind
There are two motorcycle policemen.

457
00:53:38,800 -> 00:53:41,600
- Police?
- Exactly. Back straight, Dickie.

- Hello. How's it going?
- Do you have a problem?

459
00:53:51,000 -> 00:53:55,600
Do you know where to find a workshop,
which is open on Sundays?

460
00:53:56,000 -> 00:53:57,800
Spring broke.

461
00:54:00,000 -> 00:54:05,000
Mule kicked him when he
was 12 and he never recovered.

462
00:54:05,200 -> 00:54:10,200
- Their kilsan from a workshop.
- Raahustamme ago tiehemme.

463
00:54:21,200 -> 00:54:27,800
Well, Dickie, to me is enough.
You can leave me here.

464
00:54:29,400 -> 00:54:31,800
- Are you sure?
- Yeah sure.

You have a post office box number.

00:56:15,000 -> 00:56:21,200
- Good luck in prison, boys.
- Shut up. We may overcome this.

475
00:56:21,600 -> 00:56:25,600
Do not be upset.
We need to invent something.

476
00:56:25,800 -> 00:56:31,200
Think! We could hide marin
and retrieve it later.

477
00:56:31,400 -> 00:56:35,800

Nothing. Thank you, officer.

485
00:57:06,200 -> 00:57:11,200
If we get behind that hill,
we can drive back.

486
00:57:11,600 -> 00:57:15,200
Then look for someone arable
and hidden stuff.

487

- Good morning, officer.
- Driver's license and registration.

00:58:06,000 -> 00:58:10,200
- Maybe. We are Kansas.
- This is not Kansas, Dorothy.

495
00:58:10,600 -> 00:58:14,200
Go elsewhere in Oklahoma.
Hurry up!

00:58:30,000 -> 00:58:31,600
Arrest respiration.

499
00:58:38,800 -> 00:58:42,000
- Come out and open up your luggage.
- With pleasure.

500
00:58:42,200 -> 00:58:48,000
- I can not walk.
- Come out and move away.

501
00:58:48,200 -> 00:58:49,800
Hurry up!

502
00:58:53,800 -> 00:58:55,800
You help physical barriers.

503
00:58:56,000 -> 00:58:58,800
- What a cool box is?
- Rabbits.

504
00:58:59,000 -> 00:59:03,200
Shit they are no rabbits,
but the dog snacks. Out of there.

505
00:59:03,400 -> 00:59:05,000
Hurry up!

506
00:59:12,200 -> 00:59:15,200
Can I

507
00:59:15,600 -> 00:59:19,400
- Shut off the car and trust!
- Okay.

508
00:59:20,600 -> 00:59:25,400
I read a story where the suspect
had built a car marijuana.

509
00:59:25,600 -> 00:59:28,200
Do you live alone?

510
00:59:33,800 -> 00:59:36,200
- Nothing?
- No.

511
00:59:37,400 -> 00:59:43,200
- Has it been like that before?
- Last year, when the time over it.

512
00:59:49,200 -> 00:59:52,000
Toipuuko your dog?

513
00:59:56,800 -> 01:00:00,600
Listen now.
Here is something suspicious.

514
01:00:01,000 -> 01:00:06,200
It has never been looking for him
exhausted without finding anything.

515
01:00:06,400 -> 01:00:10,000
You seem to conceal something.

516
01:00:11,200 -> 01:00:13,800
No secret you something?

517
01:00:23,400 -> 01:00:27,400
- I'm gay.
- What?

518
01:00:27,600 -> 01:00:33,400
I'm gay
and I teach them my friends homoiksi.

519
01:00:38,000 -> 01:00:39,400
Are you gay?

520
01:00:39,800 -> 01:00:46,000
This is the case. I'm homompi
as Gay sapiens.

521
01:00:47,400 -> 01:00:53,000
- Or gay? Forgetting for a moment.
- Will there we go now?

522
01:01:03,800 -> 01:01:07,600
Johan is a man. That funny looking
said that he is gay.

523
01:01:07,800 -> 01:01:13,000
- Did you see the big guy 'legs?
- That this is how?

524
01:01:47,400 -> 01:01:50,400
Graduation TIME

525
01:01:56,600 -> 01:02:01,800
- Good luck, red devil.
- Thank you, Dick.

526
01:02:12,800 -> 01:02:15,400
<i> Please leave a message. </ i>

527
01:02:15,600 -> 01:02:20,600
<i> Hello, Richard. Here is Becky. </ I>
<i> You're not at home. </ i>

528
01:02:20,800 -> 01:02:25,400
<i> This is a difficult time. </ i>
<i> Perhaps we could talk. </ i>

529
01:02:25,600 -> 01:02:30,600
<i> I'd like to talk. </ i>
<i> Okay. Bye. </ I>

530
01:02:35,000 -> 01:02:39,800
The place is full of policemen,
so it is smoked in the Mari field below.

531
01:02:40,200 -> 01:02:42,600
We have to act.

532
01:02:42,800 -> 01:02:47,800
Waiting only increases the risk that
that stuff gets wet in the rain.

533
01:02:48,000 -> 01:02:49,800
<i> Not again! </ i>

534
01:02:50,800 -> 01:02:53,000
Someone even if the goat can eat it.

535
01:03:00,800 -> 01:03:07,800
Kept busy. The place is swarming with
cops and old dirt farmer.

536
01:03:08,000 -> 01:03:12,600
Dividing us into two teams,
with two men.

537
01:03:12,800 -> 01:03:16,800
Dink, keep watch airplanes
event. This does not go long.

538
01:03:21,800 -> 01:03:23,600
There it is arable.

539
01:04:07,200 -> 01:04:10,600
Fortunately, the marijuana is not here.

540
01:04:11,600 -> 01:04:15,600
My business failed
for several reasons -

541
01:04:16,000 -> 01:04:19,000
- But they were not related to money.

542
01:04:21,600 -> 01:04:28,000
If the marriage fails, it is due to
that I have tried enough.

543
01:04:31,800 -> 01:04:36,400
We met a man,
who hitchhikes across Asia Int.

544
01:04:36,600 -> 01:04:41,800
I've never met
happier people.

545
01:04:42,000 -> 01:04:43,200
This is the case.

546
01:04:49,600 -> 01:04:51,400
Let's go home.

547
01:05:07,000 -> 01:05:08,400
Thank you.

548
01:05:47,000 -> 01:05:50,800
I'm sorry marihuanametsästä.
Maybe next time.

549
01:05:52,200 -> 01:05:57,200
- For the first time will hardly be, Kevin.
- Keep the care of yourselves.

550
01:06:01,600 -> 01:06:06,000
Hopefully, you and Becky's Cases
arranged. I like him.

551
01:06:07,400 -> 01:06:14,200
He made you happy. When
you were happy, were we.

552
01:06:14,400 -> 01:06:18,800
Thank you, boys.
It was nicely said.

553
01:06:40,400 -> 01:06:43,000
Gosh.

554
01:06:46,000 -> 01:06:51,400
- Hey, Dave. Hey, Dick.
- Come on, Bill.

555
01:06:51,600 -> 01:06:57,200
- Why we had to come here?
- Rabbits need a sandbox.

556
01:06:59,200 -> 01:07:03,800
We are not going anywhere
except to the bank.

557
01:07:09,600 -> 01:07:12,000
Bye, Dick.

558
01:07:15,200 -> 01:07:16,800
Hey, guys.

559
01:07:17,000 -> 01:07:20,400
You have
Kansas State Map T-paidassasi.

560
01:07:23,400 -> 01:07:26,200
Can not be true.

561
01:07:28,000 -> 01:07:32,200
Anyone
who buy such T-shirt -

562
01:07:32,400 -> 01:07:37,800
- Sees marihuanametsän Oldman,
before it disappears.

563
01:07:38,200 -> 01:07:40,800
When I covered my kuluni -

564
01:07:41,000 -> 01:07:44,200
- We are looking for Oldman -

565
01:07:44,600 -> 01:07:51,200
- And we share with him
50 000 dollars.

566
01:07:51,400 -> 01:07:56,400
- Drat.
- You're all geniuses.

567
01:07:56,600 -> 01:07:58,200
It is true.

Making boxes

569
01:08:14,800 -> 01:08:16,800
Listen up, fool.

570

Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin soon,
so repeating tasks. Hunter.

571

- Exactly. Dinkadoo?
- I received the money.

01:09:01,200 -> 01:09:03,000

01:09:03,400 -> 01:09:10,000
- Kevin, tell your brew.
- Hot dog gets 50 cents.

576
01:09:10,200 -> 01:09:14,400
Limut cost 25 cents

577
01:09:14,600 -> 01:09:18,400
I, of course, I read about
trip hazards.

578
01:09:18,600 -> 01:09:22,400
Let's go to sell T-shirts.

579
01:09:28,000 -> 01:09:31,200

My name is Hunter,
but Ferdinand.

01:10:26,800 -> 01:10:32,200
Who will be interested in it. You
you opened the door, so close it now.

594
01:10:32,400 -> 01:10:36,800
You heard what Madsen said.
Close your mouth and then the door.

595
01:10:37,000 -> 01:10:41,600
Sweet Pea joined the club.
Good morning, Hendrix.

596
01:10:41,800 -> 01:10:45,800
I'm not Hendrix.
My name is ...

597
01:10:47,200 -> 01:10:49,600
Ferdinand.

598
01:10:51,400 -> 01:10:55,200
Wait a minute. Madsen, olepa accurate.

599
01:10:55,600 -> 01:10:59,800
- Ferdinand is one of the code.
- Do not come on now.

600
01:11:00,000 -> 01:11:03,600
Let the just be fun,

01:11:04,000 -> 01:11:07,000
You kuvotatte me.

602
01:11:08,200 -> 01:11:11,200
It's disgusting that the mother will
to walk the same streets as you.

603
01:11:11,400 -> 01:11:14,400
- What is your mother doing?
- Shut up, Mari larva.

604
01:11:14,600 -> 01:11:17,200
Mari Toddler. Great.

605

You probably wondering why you have not already

Would you like something to drink?

607
01:11:27,200 -> 01:11:32,400
It is due to the fact that
Government wants to conceal information ...

608
01:11:34,200 -> 01:11:39,800
... Which you primitive
turd you are going to sell.

609
01:11:41,800 -> 01:11:45,200
Hello, limupoika,
bring orange juice and ice.

610
01:11:51,400 -> 01:11:54,800
Well, gorilla, siirryhän there.

01:11:57,400 -> 01:11:59,400
Sit on those chairs.

612
01:11:59,600 -> 01:12:05,200
Oklahoma Police
has told us -

613
01:12:05,400 -> 01:12:09,600
- That you have a map board
Kansas down the country.

614
01:12:09,800 -> 01:12:12,400
I guess we all know,
what countries they are.

615
01:12:12,600 -> 01:12:15,000
This is the case.

616
01:12:15,200 -> 01:12:18,400
It was a rhetorical question,
Smoking boy.

617
01:12:18,600 -> 01:12:25,800
Now you have to press a secret
information on hundreds of T-shirts.

618

We can not prevent you from

621
01:12:42,200 -> 01:12:46,000
- Who are looking for
this magical marihuanametsää.

622
01:12:46,600 -> 01:12:49,200
Who the hell else is it invented?

623
01:12:49,400 -> 01:12:53,200
Our parents come up with it.
I would say marijuana nirvana.

624
01:12:54,800 -> 01:12:58,200
Please. Hopefully
it is not too much ice.

625
01:12:58,400 -> 01:13:01,000
- Thank you.
- No problem.

626
01:13:03,200 -> 01:13:05,400
She is quite OK.

627
01:13:05,600 -> 01:13:07,400
But ...

628
01:13:07,800 -> 01:13:14,600
If the reserve and bringing into captivity
each hamppuhemmon -

629
01:13:14,800 -> 01:13:20,800
- Which appears to Kansas,
Government has to pay millions.

630
01:13:21,000 -> 01:13:25,000
That is what we drug cops
we will not be permitted.

631
01:13:26,400 -> 01:13:30,800
Sever drug snake's head
and see how it crawls -

632
01:13:31,000 -> 01:13:33,600
- My stool,
blood and limassaan.

633
01:13:33,800 -> 01:13:39,400
It gets the worm in the sand,
before it finally dies.

634
01:13:40,800 -> 01:13:46,200
We are a drug-snake
or those who buy a T-shirt?

635
01:13:46,400 -> 01:13:50,400
Was it a bit too hard
metaphor, pyllypoju?

636
01:13:56,800 -> 01:13:59,400
Let's dance, tyynynpurijat.

637
01:14:21,000 -> 01:14:25,000
What if the first-packaging of goods?
Okay, acid-heads?

638
01:14:32,200 -> 01:14:35,000
Come on, boys.

639
01:14:35,200 -> 01:14:38,800
Here is a document
which you must sign.

640
01:14:40,000 -> 01:14:43,600
Then the rotation is mammon.

Teen couple's proposal at the same time,

642

Do you listen to you? Behold
my eyes when I speak to you.

643
01:14:54,800 -> 01:15:01,400
I suggest that you drive through in Kansas

Do not go, even denied,

646
01:15:07,000 -> 01:15:12,000
Where would you like to subscribe to Kansas
something, do not do it.

647
01:15:12,200 -> 01:15:14,400
Do not do it.

648
01:15:15,600 -> 01:15:19,400
And do not even uneksiko -

649
01:15:19,600 -> 01:15:25,600
- That you owned in Kansas
business premises or residential property.

650
01:15:25,800 -> 01:15:29,400
- That was already a foregone conclusion.
- It was all in vain.

651
01:15:29,600 -> 01:15:32,400
Those other things are important.

652
01:15:33,200 -> 01:15:35,800
Live according to their

653
01:15:40,600 -> 01:15:42,600
Give it here.

654
01:15:42,800 -> 01:15:47,600
Is that clear, you are Jim Morrison
less cooli disciple?

655
01:15:48,600 -> 01:15:50,000
Okay.

656
01:16:11,800 -> 01:16:14,400
