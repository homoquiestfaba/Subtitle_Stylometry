1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,200
My name is Dalton Russell.

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,900
Pay strict attention to what I say

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,800
because I choose my words carefully
and I never repeat myself.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,900
I've told you my name. That's the "who. "

5
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,200
The "where" could most readily
be described as a prison cell.

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,965
<i>But there's a vast difference</i>

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,700
<i>between being stuck in a tiny cell
and being in prison.</i>

8
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,900
The "what" is easy.

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,400
Recently I planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank robbery.

10
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,100
That's also the "when. "

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,800
As for the "why,"
beyond the obvious financial motivation,

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
it's exceedingly simple.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,900
Because I can.

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,700
Which leaves us only with the "how. "

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,900
And therein, as the Bard would tell us,

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,700
lies the rub.

17
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,900
So, your mother tells me about

18
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,100
a certain young lady who's helping you
with the Triborough Bridge project?

19
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,900
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

20
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,100
He's crazy.

21
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,265
- Now? On 51st? 50...
Yeah, that's where he is right now.

22
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,400
He's on 40, he... No, he's still on 47th Street,
but it's a much smaller space.

23
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,200
What do I have to...

24
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,750
Yeah, we'll get lobster.
I'll put it on Mr. Ansinori's card.

25
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:27,500
Whatever. It's a meeting
with one of his clients or something.

26
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Because it's been like over a year now.
Yeah.

27
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,700
I want to snap this guy's neck,
I swear to God.

28
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,100
So what?

29
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,000
So what? They're flowers.
They could've been to his grandmother.

30
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:49,800
They could've been to me.
It's my birthday, so...

31
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Okay, so maybe it's a client's.

32
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,100
Okay. This is funny.

33
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,200
I got this guy in front of me
that thinks I don't see him looking at me.

34
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,500
Fantastic. God damn it.

35
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

36
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,900
Can you lower your voice
just a little bit, please?

37
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,800
You're getting a little loud on your phone.
Please.

38
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Yeah. Fine.

39
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,100
I don't want you
disturbing the other customers.

40
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,400
- Sorry.
- All right?

41
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,400
- Yeah, you got it.
- Thank you.

42
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,100
It was a security guy.

43
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
I didn't know I was in a library.
It's a fucking bank.

44
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,100
Manhattan Trust.

45
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,100
...from Yale.
And this fucking rich prick I work for.

46
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,700
Thank you.

47
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,700
Excuse me. Sir?

48
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,100
Easy.

49
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,700
Everybody get down on the fucking floor!
Now!

50
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,300
Get down on the ground!

51
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,200
You have four seconds!
Anyone still standing gets shot!

52
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,700
One! Two! Three!

53
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
Back away from that counter!
Get your hand away from that button!

54
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,600
Put your hands on the floor! Now!

55
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,565
Oh... What the... What is this?

56
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
- Todd, what are we gonna do?
- What the fuck do you want me to do?

57
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:25,100
Keep your head down, fat man!
- All right!

58
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,700
Get your fucking face on the floor!

59
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,800
You get the same treatment
as everyone else, Rabbi.

60
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,900
Get down.

61
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,200
Now, my friends and I are making

62
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,000
a very large withdrawal from this bank.

63
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,700
Anybody gets in our way
gets a bullet in the brain.

64
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,300
Lie down, old man!
Put your fucking hands down!

65
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,200
Get your face on the floor.
All right, I'm down! I'm down!

66
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,700
Hey, Officer,
there's smoke coming out of there.

67
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,100
Possible 10-30. Manhattan Trust.
20 Exchange Place.

68
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,000
I have got hostages.

69
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,000
You fucking cops come near this door,
I start killing people.

70
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,300
I not fucking kidding, man.

71
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,300
Central. Give me an 85.

72
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,100
Back up, sir! Back up! You!

73
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,700
Shit!
- Back up! Back up!

74
00:08:39,735 --> 00:08:41,200
Stay around the corner!

75
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,200
Central, give me an 85.

76
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,565
Perp with a gun. Possible hostages.

77
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,000
I repeat, possible hostages.
20 Exchange. Manhattan Trust.

78
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:50,700
Baby, I'm fighting for my life over here.

79
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Keith, every time we have this conversation,
it's the same thing.

80
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,100
<i>- "Not now. "
- Listen. Listen.</i>

81
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,300
Do you know what kind of thin ice
I'm on right now

82
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,500
with this check-cashing thing?
They want to lock me up.

83
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,765
<i>If this $140,000 doesn't show up
somewhere soon,</i>

84
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,100
<i>- things gonna get rough for me.
- But you didn't take it.</i>

85
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,900
Of course I didn't take it, baby.
It's just some lying drug dealer

86
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,900
trying to save his own ass
by fucking me over.

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
<i>- Eventually, it'll go away.
- Then what?</i>

88
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,100
<i>- What about us?
- Then, you know, I'll make First Grade</i>

89
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
and we'll have enough money
to buy a bigger place and then, you know...

90
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,900
Why we got to have this conversation
every time your brother gets locked up

91
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,900
<i>- or gets caught stealing a car?
- He's the only family I've got.</i>

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,900
All right, I'm sorry, baby. You okay?

93
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
- You still love me?
- I'm sorry, too.

94
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
<i>- You still love me?
- I love you, baby.</i>

95
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,500
All right. Big Willie and the twins for you
when I get home.

96
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,900
- I got the handcuffs.
- I got the gun.

97
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,500
Bye, Big Daddy.

98
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,865
- Big Willie and the twins, huh?
- That's correct.

99
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,800
Her lowlife brother, he's got three priors,
one for armed robbery.

100
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,200
17-year-old high-school dropout.
Doesn't have an honest bone in his body

101
00:09:44,235 --> 00:09:47,500
and he's too fucking stupid
to amount to anything. Even as a criminal.

102
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,900
- Can't you get rid of him?
- I could, couldn't I?

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,500
No, she loves him. What am I gonna do?
Put him out in the street?

104
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,250
- How's he feel about you?
- Oh, he's thrilled.

105
00:09:54,285 --> 00:09:55,900
To have a detective
sleeping in the next room,

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,200
banging his sister.
Then she tries to bring it all back on me.

107
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,900
You know, "If we had a bigger place,
we wouldn't have this problem. "

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Of course, if we got married
then things would be different.

109
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,600
- And what's wrong with that?
- A wedding. Furniture. Kids.

110
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,165
You know what a diamond ring costs?

111
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,665
- Come on, man. You've been married.
- Please. I was 21.

112
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,900
- Yeah, but you give her a ring?
- Yeah, but she won't call me back.

113
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,300
- You guys cops?
- Oh, shit! He made us!

114
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,865
Christmas came early for you this year.

115
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,000
Bank robbery. Hostage situation.
20 Exchange Place.

116
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,200
- What?
- Grossman's on vacation. You're up.

117
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,965
What about the Madrugada thing?
The check-cashing thing?

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
- I thought I was in the doghouse.
- I just threw you a bone.

119
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200
As far as I'm concerned, you still work here,

120
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,500
- but if you don't think you're ready...
- No, no, he's ready!

121
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
Oh, good. Good.

122
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,800
I'm giving you a break, here.
Don't make me look like a fool.

123
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,500
- This is it, baby. The show!
- Yeah.

124
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
You got the call, man. God damn!

125
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,800
I guess I should be happy.
I might get to put off I.A.B.

126
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,900
Here's all you need to know.
You walk in unarmed.

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,700
Head bad guy puts a gun to your head
and makes you get on your knees.

128
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,500
You look around. There are five armed men
pointing Uzis at you.

129
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,100
Just picture them in their underwear.

130
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
How about orange jumpsuits and shackles?

131
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,400
- There you go, Keith. You can do this, man.
- Look out, bad guys. Here I come.

132
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,100
Get back around the corner!
Get back!

133
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,700
I told you, move it! Move it!

134
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,400
Get those people back!
Get them the hell out of here!

135
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,100
All right, guys, as soon as we pull up,
I want everybody out.

136
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,700
The second floor window. Now.

137
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
- Let them in there!
- Let's go! Go now!

138
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Sarge, what do you got?

139
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,000
I got a perp in the bank.
Possible hostage situation.

140
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,365
Who's on today? Who's your boss?

141
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
- Sergeant Hernandez. I'll get him over here.
- Get him down here.

142
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,100
- Sergeant Hernandez, you on the air?
- On the air. Go.

143
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,900
Sarge, I got Sergeant Collins over here.
He called this in.

144
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,500
Can you come over to the other side?

145
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,800
Redirect, on my way. Let's go.

146
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,100
Back up! Go around,
around the corner.

147
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,500
Pull back. Pull it back.
We got to keep this secure.

148
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:23,700
- Collins? What you got?
- Hernandez.

149
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,400
I got a perp inside with a gun.
He claims he's got some hostages in there.

150
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,500
Everyone, heads up! Let's clear the way!

151
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,800
Let's go. Set them up. All right.

152
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
We've got it under control.

153
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,700
Step back, please!

154
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,000
- Step back!
- Get back! Thank you.

155
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,000
There's nothing going on.

156
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,100
You'll see it on the news tonight.

157
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
Step back, please.

158
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,065
Mr. Case?

159
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,800
Oh, good morning, Katherine.
What can I do for you?

160
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,100
Sir, there's a robbery in progress
at one of our branches.

161
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Oh, my.

162
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,900
- Has anybody been hurt?
- I don't think so, but there are hostages.

163
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,300
Oh, how awful.

164
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,100
- Which branch is it?
- Number 32. 20 Exchange Place.

165
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
- Which one?
- 20 Exchange Place.

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Thank you, Katherine.

167
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Case.

168
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Oh, dear God.

169
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,000
Get these people out of here.
Come on, open these gates. Back up.

170
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:09,300
Up on the sidewalk. Come on in.

171
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,465
Sergeant Collins, first on scene.
Are you the hostage negotiator?

172
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,200
That's right. Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell. What do you got?

173
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,200
Not much.
Saw the bank was filled with smoke.

174
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,600
The door was locked.
I tried to take a look inside

175
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,100
and one of the gunmen opens the door,
sticks a. 357 in my face,

176
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,800
screaming in some foreign accent
about killing hostages.

177
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,600
- See any other gunmen?
- No, sir. I couldn't see anything at all.

178
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,300
- You hear anything inside?
- No, sir,

179
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,400
but with that. 357 sticking in my face,
I can't really be sure. I'm sorry.

180
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Okay.

181
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,700
Good, good. Good, good, good, good.
You did a good job, Sergeant.

182
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,100
You ever had a gun
stuck in your face before?

183
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,650
- Yeah, once.
- Really?

184
00:14:49,685 --> 00:14:51,100
Yeah, by a 12-year-old.

185
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,600
- What was that like?
- Not one of my better days.

186
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,800
I bet. All right, well, look.

187
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,500
As soon as we get this thing cleared up,
we'll cut you loose, all right?

188
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,500
If you don't mind,
I'd rather hang around a while,

189
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
at least until we make contact.

190
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,700
That's what I like to hear, Sergeant.

191
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,200
What? Come on. Why you doing this?
Why you doing this to me?

192
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,300
Pop, what's going on? Yo.

193
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,400
All bank employees,
raise your hands!

194
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,500
Bank employees, this side!
Everyone else, over there!

195
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,300
Now, I need everybody
to take your cell phones and your keys

196
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,100
out of your pockets and handbags
and hold them in the air.

197
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,700
- What's your name?
- Peter.

198
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,300
- Peter what?
- Peter Hammond.

199
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,700
- Where's your cell phone, Peter Hammond?
- I left it at home.

200
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Peter, think very carefully
about how you answer the next question

201
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,900
because if you get it wrong,
your headstone will read,

202
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,100
"Here lies Peter Hammond, hero,

203
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,500
"who valiantly attempted
to prevent a brilliant bank robbery

204
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,465
"by trying to hide his cellular phone,

205
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,100
"but wound up getting shot
in the fucking head. "

206
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,300
Now, Peter Hammond,

207
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,700
where is your cell phone?

208
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,300
I'm telling you, I did. I left it at home.

209
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Okay, I fucked up. I'm sorry. Please.

210
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,000
Hey. Don't worry about it.

211
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Just let me talk to you!
Please, please, listen to me.

212
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,200
Let me explain.

213
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Help! Help me.

214
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Stop!

215
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,500
Stop!

216
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,600
Anyone else here smarter than me?

217
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,900
- And you are?
- Vikram Walia.

218
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,700
Vikram Walia. Thanks, Vikram.

219
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
Hey, mister.

220
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
Keep it.

221
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,100
Men here. Women here.

222
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,500
Move!

223
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,800
I need all of you
to strip down to your underwear.

224
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Now.

225
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Lady?

226
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,800
Believe me. This is the only situation
where I'd ask you to do this.

227
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,500
- But take off your fucking clothes.
- No.

228
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,800
You should be ashamed of yourself.

229
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
<i>What's with you mishegoyim?</i>

230
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,665
Go ahead. Make my day.

231
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,300
- Take your fucking clothes off, lady.
- No!

232
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,300
Stevie?

233
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,100
Let's go!

234
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,100
Now, I need all of you

235
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,100
to put on one of these suits
and these masks.

236
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,300
<i>I'm Shon Gables, with CBS 2 News,
outside Manhattan Trust Bank,</i>

237
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,900
<i>where we have just been told
by investigators,</i>

238
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,700
<i>the bank has been robbed.</i>

239
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,000
<i>The suspect or possible suspects are inside,</i>

240
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,900
<i>holed up with an unknown number
of hostages.</i>

241
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
- Captain Darius?
- Yeah.

242
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
I'm Detective Frazier.
This is Detective Mitchell.

243
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Hey.

244
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,300
You may remember,
we worked that hospital thing on 93rd,

245
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:00,965
during my training?

246
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,500
Oh, yeah. That was a real shame.

247
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,350
Yeah, it was. It was.

248
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,100
So, what do we got?

249
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,900
I got an unknown number of suspects
and an unknown number of hostages,

250
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,500
and a bank, and about a million spectators,
and I can't see shit inside there,

251
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,300
- so I'm kind of busy.
- I understand.

252
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,100
The way this works, Mr. Frazier,
is I deal with Mr. Grossman.

253
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:21,400
So if you need anything,
you can speak with him, okay?

254
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
No, it's not okay, Captain.

255
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,100
Detective Grossman is away on vacation,

256
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,000
so Detective Frazier
is the big dick today, all right?

257
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,700
Now, if you need anything,
you can speak to me, all right?

258
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,165
I guess it'll have to be.

259
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,500
That's the way it's gonna be.
You got vests for us?

260
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,900
- Berk!
Yo!

261
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,900
- Get these guys some vests!
- Okay.

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
- And check them into the command log.
- Okay.

263
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,600
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of your hair

264
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,600
and let you get control
of this crime scene, okay?

265
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,900
You'll let me know when you're ready
with a detailed briefing?

266
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,900
- Okay.
- We're gonna take a walk down to the diner.

267
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Don't go in the bank without calling us first,
all right? Okay?

268
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:56,600
- All right.
- Good to see you, Captain.

269
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,700
Shouldn't we be in there?

270
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,300
Let's give him some time. See what he does.
Come on.

271
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,900
Until he secures his position
and gets the physical layout,

272
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,200
he'll only dump on us.

273
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,700
If the show starts, he'll call us.
Trust me. I've seen him work.

274
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,900
Your call, Keith.

275
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,100
Can you get that for me?
I guess it is, isn't it?

276
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:23,165
That's the one thing I learned
from Grossman,

277
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,500
is these guys don't have much respect
for what we do.

278
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,965
- How do you mean?
- Well, to them it's a tactical situation.

279
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Us being here means there's
a mental side to it that they don't get.

280
00:22:32,235 --> 00:22:34,500
- Told you, you could handle this.
- Yeah.

281
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,000
I keep waiting for someone higher up
on the food chain to show up and say,

282
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,200
"Here's what we do. "

283
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,600
What happened at the hospital?

284
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,500
Guy shot himself, shot his girlfriend.
Thank you.

285
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,200
I told you, I've got

286
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,900
a heart condition.

287
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,300
Get up.

288
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,800
Put down
your fucking weapons!

289
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,150
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

290
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:33,400
- Don't move! Don't move! Come here!
- I haven't got...

291
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,900
- Come here, come here, come here!
- I work in the bank!

292
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,900
On your knees! Down on your knees now!

293
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:41,517
- They sent me out here!
- Now!

294
00:23:41,552 --> 00:23:44,100
- He said stay away!
- Cuff him.

295
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,700
If you come near the bank,
he'll throw out two dead bodies!

296
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,700
- Who said this? Who?
- I don't know who!

297
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,200
The guy with the big fucking gun!

298
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,000
- That's who!
- All right, get on your feet. Let's go.

299
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:53,500
- There's four of them in there!
- Come on.

300
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,800
Christ!

301
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,100
- Calm down!
- Let's go!

302
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,400
- Am I gonna be on TV?
- Yeah. A big star. Let's go. Come on.

303
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,900
Was it a time when I thought
I might not see my family again? Yeah.

304
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,700
Yeah, I thought about it.
I mean, at first, I wasn't...

305
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:11,165
It was too much to think about at that point.

306
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,300
You know, with a gun in your face,
but after a while I...

307
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:16,500
You know, I thought about...

308
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,665
Yeah.

309
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,600
My wife, you know,
not seeing my wife again.

310
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,100
My kids. I got a 10-year-old son,
17-year-old daughter.

311
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,800
Yeah, I thought about it, man.
What do you think?

312
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,300
Those are my babies.

313
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,800
Beautiful.

314
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,000
Go ahead.

315
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,400
Miss White, I want you to rest assured

316
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,300
my only intention is to spend time
in your wonderful city

317
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
and to enjoy all that it has to offer.

318
00:25:56,235 --> 00:25:57,600
And no business with your uncle?

319
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,000
In truth, I have very little
to do with him these days.

320
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,150
I'm told you haven't seen him in nine years.
Is that right?

321
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:06,200
- You are extremely well informed.
- I have to be. Yes?

322
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:09,200
I have a Mr. Arthur Case
on the phone for you.

323
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,200
We'll need to end this here.

324
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,300
I'm gonna need
a copy of your purchase agreement,

325
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,500
your mortgage application,
and the other documentation,

326
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
- and I'll be in touch.
- Thank you, Miss White.

327
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:20,600
Right this way, sir.

328
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,465
Arthur Case? You sure?

329
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,600
<i>- That's what he said.
- He said his name, just like that?</i>

330
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,000
It wasn't his secretary
saying he was on the line?

331
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,000
<i>- No, ma'am.
- All right. Put him through.</i>

332
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,200
<i>Okay.</i>

333
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,500
<i>- This is Madeleine White.
- Miss White, I'm Arthur Case.</i>

334
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,065
Oh, good morning, Mr. Case.

335
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,000
<i>- Have we met formally?
- No, sir, I don't believe we have.</i>

336
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,365
Yet, you're always turning up

337
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,800
at my July 4th parties in Southampton.

338
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Yes, we know some of the same people.

339
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,900
It seems.

340
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
I'll come right to the point.

341
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,600
I have a small problem
which requires someone

342
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,000
with very special skills
and complete discretion.

343
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,900
Are you such a person
or have I been misinformed?

344
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,700
<i>Go on.</i>

345
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Can I pick you up in front of
your office building in five minutes?

346
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,900
- I'll be downstairs.
- Thank you.

347
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,900
They had a kind of genius plan

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,500
for throwing us out of whack

349
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,000
and depriving us
of any kind of way of controlling ourselves.

350
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,100
They were... They were very

351
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,700
insistent, and yet, strangely detached.

352
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,700
All I know is that they called each other
a variation of Steve.

353
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
Steven, Steve-O, Stevie.

354
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,165
And they called you what?

355
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,200
They didn't call me anything.
They just told me...

356
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,400
You're lying to me. Tell me the truth, now.
You're lying to me.

357
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Tell me the...
Look at me and tell me the truth.

358
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,000
They had AK-47 s out. Four of them.

359
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,865
- You know a lot about guns.
- No.

360
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,900
- I don't know anything about guns, except...
- But you know they had an AK-47.

361
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
- Everybody knows what an AK-47 is.
- Everybody?

362
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,000
Anybody who's ever watched
a decent action movie would.

363
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,700
- You ever rob a bank before?
- Are you kidding?

364
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,500
Me rob a bank? No.

365
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,700
- Never stole a dollar?
- Never.

366
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,100
- Never?
- Not ever.

367
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,300
- You know what?
- That one time. That one time, that one time.

368
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,800
I stole a nickel
from my grandmother's pocketbook once.

369
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,000
She was Polish.

370
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,900
<i>I used to go up to her and say,
"Mama, toh nicklah, toh nicklah. "</i>

371
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,100
One day, I opened her pocketbook
and there was a nickel.

372
00:28:51,135 --> 00:28:52,500
I took it.

373
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,000
That was the only thing I ever took.

374
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,700
Look, Detective, I didn't mean
to give you a hard time back there.

375
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,965
Forget about it. What's the story, Captain?

376
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,800
Well, the hostage they let go
was Herman Gluck, 73.

377
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,265
He was having chest pains.
Paramedics have him.

378
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,900
They told him to say
that if any cops came near the door,

379
00:29:13,935 --> 00:29:16,265
they'd throw out two dead bodies.

380
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,200
He thinks there's four perps.
Says they came in dressed as painters.

381
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,600
There's a video system in the bank.

382
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
We're working on getting a download

383
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,100
from Manhattan Trust's
central security office, but it'll take a while.

384
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,600
We got the block locked up.
I got men in the windows.

385
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:35,400
We're checking on the sewers with D.E.P.

386
00:29:35,435 --> 00:29:36,765
What about the phones?

387
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,700
Cut and diverted into M.C.C.
We're the only ones they're gonna call.

388
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,500
Cell phones are monitored
and we can jam the air whenever you say.

389
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,800
But we like to leave it clear
in case a hostage is able to get through,

390
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,100
but so far nothing.

391
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,100
- 911?
- It's up on the screen.

392
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,200
Any call about a bank
gets routed straight to us.

393
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,100
Well, that's my end of it, Detective.

394
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
Yeah.

395
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,400
Yeah, I'm not calling them yet.

396
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,000
Beg your pardon?

397
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,400
Doesn't feel right yet,
you know what I mean?

398
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm not gonna call him
and ask what I can do for him.

399
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,200
Let's see what he does.

400
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,700
Your call.

401
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,400
Now, Mr. Case, why don't you
let me explain to you how I work?

402
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,400
Please. That would be nice.

403
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,500
Well, you say that there are family heirlooms
inside your safety deposit box.

404
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,000
That's fine.

405
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,700
But in my experience, people like you
have people working for them

406
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,300
that handle these kinds of things.

407
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,300
And when they can't,
well, they don't call me.

408
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,200
Their people call me.

409
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,600
So, immediately, I know
that there's something in that box

410
00:30:49,635 --> 00:30:52,800
that you don't even want
your closest aides to know about.

411
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,300
No problem with me.

412
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,500
You tell me I don't need to know
what's in that box and I don't need to know.

413
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,500
But if you tell me
that it's a bunch of old baseball cards

414
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,500
and I find out that it's the launch codes
for a nuclear missile,

415
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,300
then let's just say
we no longer have an agreement.

416
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

417
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,700
What's inside that box, young lady,

418
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,500
has belonged to me
since before you were born.

419
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,800
It's very valuable
and poses no danger whatsoever to anyone.

420
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,700
Except you.

421
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,300
Okay. Well, first,
there are men with guns in there,

422
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,200
so I can't guarantee any results. Agreed?

423
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,000
- Of course.
- All right.

424
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,000
Now, what makes you think
that they want to rob your box?

425
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,300
I don't.

426
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,100
Well, why don't you tell me
how you would like this to end?

427
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,800
I'd prefer that nobody
ever touch my safe deposit box.

428
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,800
Not them, not you, not the authorities.

429
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,800
And the sooner this situation ends,
the happier I'll be.

430
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:56,500
- Is that specific enough for you?
- No.

431
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
The contents of that box

432
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
are of great value to me.

433
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,800
So long as they remain my secret.

434
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,800
And if they're exposed?

435
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,700
I'll face some difficult questions.

436
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:25,200
- So, it stays locked or it disappears.
- Precisely.

437
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,500
- Can you make that happen?
- Yes.

438
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,000
I hope so.
I have to say, I can't help but be skeptical.

439
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:34,000
Whoever gave you my number
got the same deal.

440
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,800
Clearly, they must have been satisfied.

441
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,900
Steve?

442
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,100
It's time for Steve-O.

443
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,900
I came out here to take a look
at the perimeter they laid down.

444
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,400
Guess what I found?

445
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,900
That hostage they let out said these guys
came in dressed like painters, right?

446
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,100
Yeah.

447
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,900
Probably stolen.

448
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Have them run it and check it for prints.

449
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
- Everybody on?
- Yep, I'm there.

450
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,100
- Sure you got the right number?
- Absolutely.

451
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,200
Okay. Nothing yet.

452
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,100
We got video.

453
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,600
Let's have it.

454
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
What happened to that camera
right there?

455
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

456
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,300
Yeah, there it is.
That guy right there.

457
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,700
It's like he blinds the camera
with the flashlight.

458
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,300
It's weird, isn't it?
It's like nobody else sees it.

459
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,200
- You'd think it'd be pretty bright, huh?
- It could be infrared.

460
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,400
- What's that?
- Infrared bulb.

461
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,500
See, humans can't see it,
but a video camera will pick it up.

462
00:34:24,535 --> 00:34:26,600
He could knock out the cameras
without no one knowing.

463
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:27,865
Right, right, right, right.

464
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,700
He knocked out
the cameras about 10:00.

465
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,900
So, for approximately two minutes,

466
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,800
we got no evidence of people
leaving or entering the bank. That's great.

467
00:34:35,835 --> 00:34:38,800
Miriam, how long were you there
before it began?

468
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,465
It was just a few minutes.

469
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,700
Well, can you tell us what happened
after the explosions and the smoke?

470
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,100
They just told us to put our heads down.
And then close our eyes.

471
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,165
And then I just remember one of them

472
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,000
telling the others to just go down
and fix the cameras.

473
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,900
<i>- The video cameras?
- I don't know.</i>

474
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,100
Anything else you want to share with us?

475
00:34:58,135 --> 00:34:59,200
No, just...

476
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,100
- You sure?
- Yeah, I...

477
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Could you give us
the names of the bank robbers, maybe?

478
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
I'm just messing with you, sweetheart.

479
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,800
- You okay?
- Thank you.

480
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Okay.

481
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,000
- It was pretty awful.
- Was it bad?

482
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,300
I mean, they made us strip.

483
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,300
They made us take off our clothes.

484
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,800
I don't understand why they had to do that.

485
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,365
I really just thought...

486
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,800
I thought I was gonna be killed.

487
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,600
Well.

488
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,800
- All right, my dear.
- Okay.

489
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,300
- I can go?
- No.

490
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,065
- No?
- No, you got to stay.

491
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,600
- You got to stay.
- No, you can go.

492
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,900
No, stay. No, go.

493
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,500
Did you rob the bank?

494
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,900
- You did.
- Did you rob the bank?

495
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,400
- No.
- You sure?

496
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,200
There's movement at the front door.
- Let's go.

497
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Put down the fucking weapon!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

498
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,600
Don't move! Don't move!

499
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,000
He's got a device on him there.

500
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,300
I said put your hands on your head
and get down on your fucking knees!

501
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,100
I said put your hands on your head
and down on your knees now!

502
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,600
Hands are tied!
Hands are tied.

503
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,750
- Jesus, pat him down.
- All right.

504
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm one of the hostages!
- Careful.

505
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,300
Easy, be very careful,
now. Easy.

506
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
I can't see him from where I'm at.

507
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,700
I can see him. I got a clear shot.
Any weapons?

508
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,300
- Who are you?
- Vikram Walia. I work in the bank.

509
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:18,500
Okay. Vikram? Is this a bomb?

510
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,800
- Oh, shit! A fucking Arab!
- What? No. I'm a Sikh!

511
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,965
- Is that a bomb?
- No.

512
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,200
- Answer me, Vikram. Is this a bomb?
- No.

513
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,700
- Are you booby-trapped?
- No, fuck, no.

514
00:36:24,735 --> 00:36:26,400
Okay, Vikram, I need you to relax.

515
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,100
- Jesus, give me a hand.
- I don't know.

516
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Just watch.
There's a lot of movement in that bank.

517
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,800
- Team, take him down.
- Mike, now, get him.

518
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:34,265
What the fuck? Easy, easy.

519
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,000
Get off my... That's my turban. Get off. Easy.

520
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,600
Get... My turban!
Look, fuck, give my turban back!

521
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,000
Come on, shut up. Relax.

522
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,000
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me my turban back.

523
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,700
- You can't fucking rip my turban.
- Shut up, already.

524
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,000
- What the fuck?
- Come on, move it.

525
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,000
Get your fucking hands off me!

526
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,100
And the 11:00 and 12:00...

527
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,300
And don't forget about your 1:00
with Chancellor Joel Klein.

528
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
- Oh, Madge. What a day...
- Your Honor.

529
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,565
Madeleine! How are you?

530
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm just fine, but thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

531
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,500
- Sure. Madge, are we through here?
- Yes, Mr. Mayor.

532
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,600
This way, Miss White.

533
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,500
I always have time to put on a tux
and eat free food for a good cause.

534
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,500
Who are we saving this week?

535
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,300
Well, I'm doing a round of support

536
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,300
for the Joseph Freidkin Memorial Fund
for Spinal Cord Research

537
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
and we're having
our annual fundraiser next month.

538
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
If you could attend,
it would give us such a boost.

539
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,500
It would be my pleasure.
Is there anything else I can do to...

540
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,600
- What the fuck do you want?
- A favor.

541
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,500
- No shit. Which kind?
- The last one I'll ever ask of you.

542
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,200
That's the kind I had in mind.

543
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,800
You know about this hostage situation.

544
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:45,165
On my way. What's it to do with you?

545
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,365
All right, well, I need to keep an eye on it.

546
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,500
So, I want you to bring me down there
and tell whoever's in charge

547
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,500
to extend me every courtesy.

548
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,800
You're out of your fucking mind.

549
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,100
If it was easy,
it wouldn't square us, would it?

550
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,500
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

551
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,700
You just have to call in a few markers,
that's all.

552
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,000
I may have to give out a few.

553
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,100
Then that's exactly what you'll do.

554
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
You're a magnificent cunt.

555
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,200
Thank you.

556
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,300
<i>It's been a very tense situation
for several hours now.</i>

557
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,700
<i>It's unclear how many hostages are inside</i>

558
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,200
<i>and how many robbers
police are dealing with.</i>

559
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,600
<i>Officials say this all started out
as a robbery at Manhattan Trust,</i>

560
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:38,500
<i>but has turned into this hostage situation.</i>

561
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,400
<i>Negotiators are here on the scene,
working very hard</i>

562
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,100
<i>and it's still unclear
on any possible injuries.</i>

563
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,850
<i>Of course, we'll keep you up to date
with the very latest</i>

564
00:38:46,885 --> 00:38:49,500
<i>and we will remain here on the scene
as this all unfolds.</i>

565
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,500
<i>That's the latest from here
in lower Manhattan.</i>

566
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,300
<i>Reporting live, I'm Sandra Endo.
Back to you.</i>

567
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,300
"Protect and serve" my ass.
Where's my turban?

568
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm not talking to anybody without a turban.

569
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,000
It's part of my religion, to cover my head
in respect to God. I'm a Sikh.

570
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,400
Okay, we'll find your turban.

571
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,800
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me outside.

572
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:08,865
Now, no, I don't think you heard that.

573
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,300
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

574
00:39:11,335 --> 00:39:13,300
- I didn't hear that.
- I heard what I heard.

575
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,465
I'll give you all the information you want.

576
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,400
I don't need this. I need my turban.
It's part of my religion.

577
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,600
- We'll get you your turban.
- We'll find it for you.

578
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:23,065
No, no, no. Not "get me. "
I want my turban now.

579
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,900
You just got to start thinking
about the people inside the bank now.

580
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:27,000
It's a dangerous situation.

581
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,500
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside the bank.

582
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,100
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer to come down.

583
00:39:32,135 --> 00:39:33,600
You can write a formal complaint.

584
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,000
But for now,
we got to deal with this situation.

585
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

586
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,900
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

587
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,500
I could apologize on behalf of the NYPD,
but that was not us. We are detectives.

588
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,700
- We're gonna try and find out...
- What do you want to know?

589
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:49,365
- How many were there?
- I think there were about four.

590
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,200
- How many hostages?
- I don't know how many hostages, 20, 30.

591
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm fucking tired of this shit.
What happened to my fucking civil rights?

592
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,500
Why can't I go anywhere
without being harassed?

593
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,800
I get thrown out of a bank.
I'm a hostage. I get harassed.

594
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,000
I go to the airport.

595
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,900
I can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

596
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,800
Fucking random, my ass.
I nearly lost my job...

597
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,200
I bet you can get a cab, though.

598
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
I guess that's one of the perks.

599
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Put the ice on your face.

600
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,500
<i>"Two buses with full gas tanks.
One jumbo jet with full gas tank</i>

601
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,300
<i>"and pilots at JFK,
parked at the end of runway. "</i>

602
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:30,000
<i>They give us until 9:00 pm to do this,</i>

603
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,500
<i>then they kill one hostage every hour
in front of TV cameras.</i>

604
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,100
"Bank is secured with Semtex.
We will demonstrate if necessary. "

605
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,100
- Whatever you do, don't give them a jet.
- There's no plane. Maybe a bus. Maybe.

606
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:42,800
Till I talk to them, they get nothing.
Not even a cup of coffee.

607
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,000
For now, we wait.

608
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,500
Let's let them wonder
what we're doing, okay?

609
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,800
Excuse me, Detectives. This is Arthur Case.

610
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,500
- He's the...
- I'm Chairman, Board of Directors.

611
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,700
- Of the bank. You wanna talk to him?
- Absolutely.

612
00:40:54,735 --> 00:40:57,400
Mr. Case, how are you?
I'm Detective Frazier.

613
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,865
Anything in particular
you think we should know?

614
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,000
No. I just wondered
if I might be of some assistance.

615
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,100
- Have they made any demands?
- They want a jet.

616
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,400
Oh, I see.

617
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,400
Would you like me to arrange one for you?

618
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,300
I'm so sorry. I must have misunderstood.

619
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,800
That's quite all right, Mr. Case.

620
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,350
Where can we reach you
if we need anything?

621
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:32,200
Well, those are my people in there,
you know,

622
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,200
and I would like to stay here for a while.
And I won't disturb you.

623
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:37,265
I'll be very quiet right down...
Sergeant Collins!

624
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,600
Mr. Case, we'll try and keep you posted
as best we can,

625
00:41:40,635 --> 00:41:42,600
but you're gonna have to excuse us
for now, okay?

626
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,400
Right this way, sir.
Thank you very much.

627
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,600
- Absolutely.
- This way, sir.

628
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,300
Thank you very much.
- And thank you all so much.

629
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

630
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
This way, sir.

631
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,200
"Fifty hungry people need food now. "

632
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,800
All right.
Are we ready with the listening devices?

633
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,100
I'm gonna need 15 minutes
once we get the food.

634
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,100
Pizza's the best. No sandwiches.

635
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,165
Is she for real?
Are you for real?

636
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,500
Well, if we send in, say,
10 pizzas boxes with transmitters,

637
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,400
maybe we'll get some conversation
if we give them something to group around.

638
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,465
Give them each a sandwich, it's hit or miss.

639
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,200
They can move around
and I don't have 50 transmitters.

640
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,400
- What's this?
- It's a digital recorder.

641
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,565
You click it, and it'll record for half an hour.

642
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,065
- James Bond shit.
- Well, you can get them on Amazon.

643
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,700
- You gonna ask for a hostage?
- He already gave us one, didn't he?

644
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:09,800
I ask for another one,
he says no, then what?

645
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,700
No, he knows what he's doing.

646
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,900
He gave us a hostage.
We'll give him some food.

647
00:43:13,935 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't want to get caught bluffing this guy.

648
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,500
Fuck this shit. Look, they want to shoot me
for taking off my mask, they can go ahead.

649
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,200
Do you wanna get us all killed?

650
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,400
You wanna relax?
What the hell is the difference?

651
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,300
They're out there robbing the bank!

652
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,900
- Can't you see they fucked him up?
- Shut up.

653
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
<i>You think they dressed us like this for fun,
pueta?</i>

654
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,400
- I have no idea
- Please shut up.

655
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,700
...why they made us put on all of this crap.

656
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,700
Probably so when the cops break in
and try to rescue us

657
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,000
- we all get fucking shot.
- Oh, my God!

658
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
It's a great plan, but, no, thanks.

659
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,600
I told you to shut up! Leave him!

660
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,500
No! Don't do this to me! Please, don't.

661
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,900
I'll do as you say! No! Help! Help!

662
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,500
Please, don't! Don't!

663
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,100
One guy did most of the talking.

664
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,500
He told everyone else what to do.

665
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,300
- So they were talking amongst themselves?
- We couldn't hear them.

666
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,000
They had us in these rooms.

667
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,700
The doors were locked all the time.

668
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
We didn't know what they were doing.

669
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:45,600
- Did you hear anything they said?
- I have problems with my hearing.

670
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,500
- I see.
- I wear hearing aids.

671
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,300
- Where are they?
- They're in my ears.

672
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,500
- Let's see.
- Let me see them.

673
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,200
- Yeah, let's take a look at them.
- Yeah, it's a hearing aid.

674
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,565
That's your other one, there?

675
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,600
What's the red part, there?
What does that do?

676
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,200
They're different colors.
You need two different...

677
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:01,200
And to distinguish right from left, also.

678
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,700
- Distinguish right from left?
- Yeah.

679
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,300
Right from wrong.

680
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,350
I don't understand.

681
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:08,300
- Steve?
- I'm sorry?

682
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,800
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh.

683
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,700
Steve. Is that your name? Steve?

684
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,400
Stevie? Steve-O?

685
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,100
- How much are they gonna pay you?
- I'm sorry?

686
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,765
- You heard me.
- No, I didn't.

687
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,700
- How much are they going to pay you?
- Who's gonna pay me?

688
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:25,800
- Were you involved in this robbery?
- Absolutely not.

689
00:45:25,835 --> 00:45:28,100
Were you involved in this situation?

690
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,600
- What situation?
- Don't lie. Don't lie.

691
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,700
If he gives us a tip, I'm keeping it.

692
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,700
- Put that gun down!
- Check that weapon!

693
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
All right, everybody, relax.
Calm down. Calm down.

694
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,600
Calm the fuck down!

695
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,800
How you doing?

696
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,600
I'm Detective Keith Frazier,
Hostage Negotiation Team.

697
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,700
How's it going?

698
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,000
Okay. I hope the pizzas are okay.
They might be a little cold.

699
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,900
Listen, you pick up the phone
anytime you want.

700
00:46:16,935 --> 00:46:18,617
It's a direct line to me.

701
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:20,300
I would love to talk to you.

702
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,300
Nice talking to you.

703
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,600
Shit. Fucking Russians.

704
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,900
Call Operations. See if they can get
a Russian translator over here ASAP.

705
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,800
And get some fucking body bags.

706
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,600
I hope you know what you're doing.

707
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,600
Because if my guys got to shoot it out
with those fucking savages...

708
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:11,200
Okay, okay, okay. Mitch?

709
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,465
Check with either one of the hostages.

710
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,300
Find out if they heard any Russian
or Russian accents when they were in there.

711
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,200
We'll be all right.

712
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,600
No!

713
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,000
Down on the floor!

714
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,900
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go. Let's go.

715
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,500
Stop crying! Shut the fuck up!

716
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:03,900
Get in there! Sit down! Put your masks on!

717
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,965
Come on, let's go. Come on, boobs.

718
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,500
- "Boobs"? Who the fuck you talking to?
- Let's go. You heard me! Shut the fuck up!

719
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,000
- Why?
- Move that fat ass! Let's go! Come on!

720
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,400
"Fat ass"? Are you kidding me?

721
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,400
If you don't shut the fuck up,
I'm gonna put my foot up your fat ass!

722
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,800
Put your masks on!

723
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,800
Put your hands on the ground!

724
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,400
Okay, okay.

725
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,200
On the floor. Hands are on the floor.

726
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,700
Masks on!

727
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,100
Put your hands on the ground!

728
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,000
Come on, boobs, let's go.

729
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,400
Oh, shit. Sit down! Sit down!

730
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,900
She was on line in front of me.

731
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,700
He was the teller on my line.

732
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,600
This guy was to my right
and his kid was in front of him.

733
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,700
He was playing with a video game.

734
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,365
I remember her.

735
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,800
- Why do you remember her?
- Great tits.

736
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,700
- You remember seeing any of them after?
- Yeah, I saw her one time afterwards.

737
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,300
- How are you sure you saw her again?
- I could see under the suit.

738
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,465
Can't hide quality like that.

739
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,100
This guy, he almost got us all killed.

740
00:49:23,135 --> 00:49:24,200
How?

741
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,765
They put eight or nine of us
in an office for a while.

742
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,900
This guy took off his mask
and was talking like he wasn't afraid.

743
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,465
"I don't have to wear this damn mask,"
you know?

744
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,300
So, they come in, pull him out of the room
and smack him around a little.

745
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,700
- You see him again after that?
- No.

746
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,700
- Was he okay?
- Seemed fine.

747
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,000
You...

748
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,700
- You recognize anyone else from that room?
- I can't be sure about the others.

749
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,400
No one?

750
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,900
- Why don't you keep looking?
- You know, I was terrified.

751
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,300
What about before it began?

752
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,800
You didn't look around
while you were waiting in line?

753
00:49:59,835 --> 00:50:02,300
I was talking to my girlfriend on the phone.

754
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,100
You wanna take another picture?

755
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,600
I could bend over and pick up a pencil.

756
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,700
Whatever.

757
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,700
This guy.

758
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,900
Asshole.

759
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,700
What the fuck? This ain't Russian.

760
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,800
No? What the hell is it?

761
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,700
It's not Polish. Not Hungarian.

762
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,200
Bulgarian, maybe.

763
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,200
It's Central European. Sort of.

764
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,700
That's it?
I mean, you're the language expert.

765
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,200
What? No.

766
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,000
- What do you think?
- Well, okay.

767
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,900
Well, this is New York City.

768
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,900
Somebody on the street
must know what it is.

769
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,300
Probably the hot-dog man.

770
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,100
Berk, play that over the speaker for me.
Excuse me.

771
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,100
Excuse me!

772
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,100
Does anybody know
what language they're speaking? Anybody?

773
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,500
Yo, my man.

774
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,900
Hey, Phil, let that guy through. Come on.

775
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,700
- You know what language they're speaking?
- Yeah, they're speaking Albanian.

776
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,100
- Albanian?
- Albanian. From Albania.

777
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,300
What am I doing here?

778
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,465
Yo, am I getting arrested for something?

779
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,700
No, you're not getting arrested.
Come on. Come on.

780
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,300
Whoa.

781
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,400
- Okay. What are they saying?
- I have no idea what they're saying.

782
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,400
You got no idea?
I thought you said you spoke Albanian.

783
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,600
No. I never said I speak Albanian.

784
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,700
You said you spoke Albanian.

785
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,000
I never said I speak Albanian.

786
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,500
Well, how do you know it's Albanian?

787
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,850
My ex-wife and her parents are Albanian.

788
00:51:57,885 --> 00:52:00,100
Her parents couldn't speak English for shit.

789
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,565
I have no idea what they're saying,

790
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,300
but I'll tell you right now
that the language is 100% Albanian.

791
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,900
- 100%?
- 100%.

792
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Call the Albanian Consulate.
See if they can get somebody over here

793
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,700
to translate this for us. Make it happen fast.

794
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,400
Okay, you hang out
in the back for me, okay?

795
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,600
Oh, man, not again.

796
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,300
Van was stolen two days ago, but it's clean.
No prints.

797
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,800
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

798
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,000
Albanian?

799
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:25,300
My man, like I told you, 100% Albanian.

800
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,900
Undeniable.

801
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,100
- Hey.
- Thanks.

802
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,900
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
There go that motherfucker right there.</i>

803
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,600
<i>Hey, yo, you thought you was gonna
get away with that shit, didn't you?</i>

804
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,200
How does this game work?

805
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:20,400
You get points for doing dirt,
like jacking a car or selling crack.

806
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,200
And you lose points
if someone jacks your ride or shoots you.

807
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,165
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

808
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,800
<i>Take that! Take this! What? What? What?</i>

809
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,900
<i>Talk shit now! I don't hear you!</i>

810
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,700
<i>Eat this! Eat that! Eat this! Eat that!</i>

811
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:36,200
<i>You're gone, baby! You're dead! Bye-bye!</i>

812
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,500
Jesus!

813
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,800
What's the point of this?

814
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,400
Like my man 50 says,
"Get rich or die tryin'."

815
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,000
Yo, you'd get mad points
for knocking over the bank.

816
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,100
- You think that's cool?
- Hell, yeah. You trying to get paid, too.

817
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,700
Finish your slice.
I'll take you back to your father.

818
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
I got to talk to him about this game.

819
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,200
- Is it good?
- No doubt.

820
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,200
It's gonna be okay.

821
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,400
Cool.

822
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,500
You'll be home soon.

823
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,600
That's whassup.

824
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,200
- Sir?
- Yeah.

825
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,200
- No luck with the Albanian Consulate.
- What do you mean?

826
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,800
I couldn't tell what the guy
was talking about. I think he wanted money.

827
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
And I tried the State Department.
That takes a month.

828
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,100
Okay.

829
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,400
- Call her.
- Are you crazy?

830
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,900
- I hate that bitch. Come on.
- You said she speaks Albanian, right?

831
00:54:42,935 --> 00:54:44,800
- Yeah, she was born there.
- Call her.

832
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:46,700
I'm gonna regret this.

833
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,600
- Who's Detective Frazier?
- Right here.

834
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,300
- I have Ilina Maria over here.
- Miritia.

835
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:33,800
- Oh, how you doing?
- Hello.

836
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,100
How you doing?

837
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,800
- What's this?
- Parking tickets. You can fix them?

838
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,900
Yeah, I'll see what I can do.

839
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,800
Can you listen to this
and tell us what they're saying?

840
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,700
You can't smoke in here.

841
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,100
Shit. Go ahead.
