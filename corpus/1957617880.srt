00:15:02,004 --> 00:15:03,178
- More like five.

182
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,282
- Oh really?

183
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,424
Well, I guess we have a
lot of catching up to do.

184
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:09,287
Oh shit.

185
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:14,706
Hope you guys are hungry,
because there's plenty of food.

186
00:15:14,741 --> 00:15:16,846
- Smells great. Can we
give you hand?

187
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,711
- Sure. Why don't you mash
those potatoes?

188
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,092
- Anyone else want a brew?

189
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:23,301
- I thought you were
cutting back.

190
00:15:23,336 --> 00:15:27,409
- Oh, it's just a beer,
Sis. come on. Don't worry.

191
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,623
One Rocket Billy Bone
special coming up.

192
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:38,765
- I can't remember the last
time I mashed potatoes.

193
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,042
- [Sally] Hey, if you're good at

194
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,596
there's plenty of
opportunities around here.

195
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:45,116
- Tractor belt busted again.
We have to get a new one.

196
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,877
- Well, I just got one.
I'm sure it's in my-

197
00:15:47,912 --> 00:15:50,466
- Don't worry about it,
Sally. Just order a new one.

198
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:55,575
What brings you back?

199
00:15:57,301 --> 00:15:58,095
- Just visiting.

200
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,544
- Well, you could have called.

201
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,720
- Thought I'd surprise you.

202
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,549
- Yeah, well you are
good at that.

203
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,347
How's the garage?
Still in business?

204
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:12,247
- Yeah, if you can
call it business.

205
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:13,110
- Yeah.

206
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:16,561
I'm gonna go wash up.

207
00:16:17,907 --> 00:16:19,461
Excuse me.

208
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,981
[tense music]

209
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:30,265
[crickets chirping]

210
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:34,821
- So, what's on the
agenda for tonight?

211
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:36,512
- The usual.

212
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,170
Good booze and wild women.

213
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,209
- You with a wild woman?

214
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:45,521
Been taking bee pollen again?

215
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:48,628
- Hey, that was just
my experimental period.

216
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:52,011
- I thought we might stop by,

217
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,771
and see Terry on the
way into town.

218
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,325
- Terry split.

219
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,640
- You're kidding. Terry?
Where would he go?

220
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:01,503
- He didn't say.

221
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:03,988
- He just disappeared.

222
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,197
- Yeah, it was really
out of nowhere.

223
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,754
Everybody knew he was
having a hard time of it.

224
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:13,618
He got into a heavy loan
with the bank,

225
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:16,000
and they were really
coming down hard on him.

226
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:19,590
Just to disappear like that.

227
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,008
I guess he must've felt ashamed.

228
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,078
- Any more potatoes?

229
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:29,082
- Sure. I'll be right back.

230
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,259
[crickets chirping]

231
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:36,779
[phone ringing]

232
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:38,126
- That's for me.

233
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,625
- Can I get anyone
anything else?

234
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,075
- No thanks, Sal.

235
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:04,669
- I've got to go out for a bit.

236
00:18:04,704 --> 00:18:05,774
I'll see you later.

237
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:11,987
[sighs]

238
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:14,817
- I'm sorry.

239
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,269
I just can't stand to see
him like this anymore.

240
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:21,859
It's driving me nuts. I just
wish he'd tell me what's wrong.

241
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,930
- There's probably a
lot of pressure on him,

242
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:25,069
to try and run the farm.

243
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,829
- We've always had that.

244
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:30,971
This last year, it's been
something else.

245
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,734
I don't know.

246
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:36,701
It's like there's something
eating at him inside,

247
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:38,289
and he won't tell me what it is.

248
00:18:39,256 --> 00:18:41,465
I feel like I've been
frozen out of his life.

249
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,053
- Maybe I can talk to him.

250
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,471
- Would you?

251
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:48,334
- I can try.

252
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:49,162
- Thanks.

253
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:58,067
I'm gonna go wash my face.

254
00:18:58,102 --> 00:18:59,724
[tense music]

255
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,174
- I think I need a beer.

256
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:06,766
[country bar music]

257
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:14,498
- I need to Mich Drys,
scotch and soda, Jose Cuervo.

258
00:19:16,603 --> 00:19:17,915
- Christie, have you seen Wendy?

259
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,918
- She was here a minute
ago. She was out dancing.

260
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:24,956
[country bar music continues]

261
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:26,820
- That son of a bitch.

262
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,481
- Better keep you eye on
that one, Carl.

263
00:19:37,521 --> 00:19:40,765
[music fades]

264
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,353
- Thanks.

265
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:43,837
- The pleasure's all mine.

266
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:45,045
- That's probably true.

267
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,565
I guess I better get
back to work.

268
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,637
- Yeah, I better go find
Billy before he empties a keg.

269
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:53,019
- Stick around. You
might get lucky.

270
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:56,712
- Okay okay okay, I'm a
little drunk.

271
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,680
But, don't tell me your

272
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,581
valve covers don't need
a little tightening up.

273
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:04,858
- We gotta go.

274
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:06,860
- Hey, no you don't.
No you don't.

275
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,724
- [Girl] Sorry, Billy.

276
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:12,003
- Calls for a toast.

277
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:14,247
[grunting]

278
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:19,114
- That Bud's a little
strong for you, huh Billy?

279
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,460
- The only thing that's
strong around here

280
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:23,118
is your breath, mother fucker.

281
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:26,086
- Yo Ted, I think our
buddy Billy here is drunk.

282
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,157
- He's running his mouth.

283
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,262
- Fuck off.

284
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:32,023
[punch lands]
[grunts]

285
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:34,060
- Ted, I'm gonna take
Billy outside now.

286
00:20:35,372 --> 00:20:38,029
[Billy gagging]

287
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:48,039
[punches landing]

288
00:20:48,074 --> 00:20:50,835
[Billy gagging]

289
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,873
You're not so mouthy now,
are you Billy?

290
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:55,530
Maybe you'd like to apologize.

291
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:57,911
- Eat shit and die.

292
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:01,467
[kicks landing]

293
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:05,367
[gun cocks]

294
00:21:05,402 --> 00:21:07,852
[gun fires]

295
00:21:07,887 --> 00:21:08,784
- Get away from him.

296
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:10,061
- What are you doing?
Put it down.

297
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,615
- Get away from him!

298
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,307
- Hey man, don't get
weird. It was a fair fight.

299
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:15,170
- Back off!

300
00:21:17,103 --> 00:21:17,931
Come on.

301
00:21:22,384 --> 00:21:23,661
[Billy coughing]

302
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:25,180
You all right?

303
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:27,493
- Yeah, I'm just great.

304
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,322
- Want me to kill him?

305
00:21:29,357 --> 00:21:30,392
- You crazy.

306
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:32,221
- Am I talking to you?

307
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:34,603
- Why not? He's just a
worthless piece of shit.

308
00:21:35,742 --> 00:21:37,365
- You can't do this.

309
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,573
You just kidding, right?

310
00:21:39,505 --> 00:21:40,782
- Sorry.

311
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:43,923
- Hey, don't. Please.
Don't shoot.

312
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,616
- I'd feel bad about this.

313
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:48,721
You got any kids?

314
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:50,930
- No.

315
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:51,758
- All right.

316
00:21:51,793 --> 00:21:53,760
- Hey, wait! Don't!

317
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:57,868
[gravel crunching]
[sirens blaring]

318
00:21:57,902 --> 00:22:01,389
[police radio chattering]

319
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:08,568
- Yeah, I think he was just in
a hurry to change his shorts.

320
00:22:11,088 --> 00:22:14,712
- Carl's one of those people
that I have no sympathy for.

321
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:17,232
Guy's a sociopath,
plain and simple.

322
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:19,717
Why Lynch hired him
is beyond me.

323
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:21,443
Anyway, what's the story, Kyle?

324
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:23,549
I thought you were out in
the coast, racing cars.

325
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,413
- Guess I just needed
to take a break.

326
00:22:25,447 --> 00:22:26,828
- Think you'd be helping
Aaron with the farm,

327
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,243
or what, just to visit?

328
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:29,658
- Haven't really given
it much thought.

329
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:31,039
- I hope we get a chance
to have a beer

330
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:32,074
before you hit the road again.

331
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,006
It's been a while.

332
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:35,802
- What's he doing here?

333
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,598
- Carl McCormick

334
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:41,360
caused a little ruckus
with Billy down at the bar.

335
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,051
- I heard shots were fired.

336
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:44,224
- They were beating the
crap out of me.

337
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,399
- It was no big deal.

338
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:49,678
- Let me make this clear
from the beginning, Kyle.

339
00:22:49,713 --> 00:22:52,232
Don't try me.

340
00:22:52,267 --> 00:22:55,546
You do whatever business you
have here in town and get out.

341
00:22:58,446 --> 00:22:59,999
Did you write him up?

342
00:23:00,033 --> 00:23:02,657
- Well, no. I didn't think
there'd be any need to do that.

343
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:05,004
- Discharging a
firearm in the city

344
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:07,040
is a violation of the code.

345
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,318
Write him up.

346
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,045
- Yes, sir.

347
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,326
I don't think Don's too
happy to see you again.

348
00:23:17,361 --> 00:23:19,777
- Guess he didn't mellow
much with age, did he?

349
00:23:19,812 --> 00:23:21,158
- The way he treats you,
you'd think you were

350
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:24,023
the only one who ever raced
around town in a hot car.

351
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,751
I'm beat. Can we get
out of here?

352
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:31,168
- Sure. I'm on my way out too.

353
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,860
[phone ringing]

354
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,280
- Hey Gordy,

355
00:23:41,178 --> 00:23:43,732
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something.

356
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:44,664
What'd did you guys find out

357
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:46,425
about Terry Thomas's
disappearance?

358
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:49,255
- Nothing. He just left.

359
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:51,913
He wasn't first, and he
won't be the last.

360
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:56,227
It's not so unusual around
her these days, Kyle.

361
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,713
It's not the same as
it used to be.

Come on, let's get going.

363
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,901

kind of a record.

Thought you might want
to take a break.

366
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:22,357
- No, thanks.

00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:45,587
So you gonna be around a
while or what?

370
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:46,795
- If I'm not in the way.

00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,522
Suit yourself.

372
00:24:49,557 --> 00:24:51,800
You've got as much right here
as I do. It's half yours.

373
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:57,357

374
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:58,842
and get a couple of beers
after you're finished?

375
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,706
- Hard to say when
that would be.

376
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,534
- Well, I'll help you.

377
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:02,880

major differences in the past,

your business.

I was just looking for him.

live down the road aways.

00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:48,474
Kyle. Good to see you.

534
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:52,168
Business, huh? Well, come
on back. We can talk here.

535
00:33:53,583 --> 00:33:57,000
I hope you've come to see
me about a little rematch.

536
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,623
I fear my sense of caution

537
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:01,349
got the better of me
the other day.

538
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,215
- I understand that you're
now own Terry Thomas's farm.

539
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:07,735
- That's right, yes.

540
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:08,977
If you're interested, I
could probably

541
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:11,083
swing a loan for you
down at the bank.

542
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:14,845
I kind of have it in down
there, if you know what I mean.

543
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,054
- I was more interested in

544
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,332
the arrangement you
had with Terry.

545
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:19,850
- Oh, that's simple.

546
00:34:19,885 --> 00:34:22,888
Terry had his up against
the wall. He needed money.

547
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,787
I offered to loan him
$50,000 against the farm.

548
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,444
Next thing you know, he
up and split.

549
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,308
I guess he just couldn't
handle the pressure.

550
00:34:29,343 --> 00:34:30,171
- What pressure?

551
00:34:30,206 --> 00:34:31,828
- Being in red ink up to here.

552
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,899
That can get to you
after awhile.

553
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:36,626
Poor sucker didn't know
whether he was coming or going.

554
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,663
- Why did you loan
Terry the money?

555
00:34:39,698 --> 00:34:41,803
- Well, it's not because
I'm your good neighbor Sam.

556
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:43,081
We both know that.

557
00:34:45,462 --> 00:34:48,776
Look, Kyle. I'm a businessman.

558
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,054
Making money as all I know.

559
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,780
When I see something
I can get on the cheap

560
00:34:52,814 --> 00:34:55,438
and sell it a fat profit,
I'm interested.

561
00:34:55,472 --> 00:34:57,233
I didn't know how Terry
could work things out,

562
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,304
things being the way they were.

563
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:01,478
I figured I could get
some more land cheap.

564
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,654
- Did Terry tell you
he was leaving?

565
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:07,001
No, I heard it from one
of the girls at work.

566
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:09,279
Can't say that I was
surprised though.

567
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:11,385
He always had the feel of
a quitter to me.

568
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:14,905
- Well, I won't take up
any more of your time.

569
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,461
I just wanted to get a
little more information.

570
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:19,669
- You looking for Terry?

571
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:22,154
- Yeah. You might say that.

572
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:23,914
- Owe you money?

573
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:25,882
- No.

574
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:29,437
You see, I know Terry
was no quitter.

575
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:34,339
His great grandfather
settled here in 1887.

576
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,099
He would've eaten beans
in the chicken coop

577
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,136
before he gave away that farm.

578
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:42,519
It would have taken more than
reading to chase him away.

579
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:44,003
- Well, you never can tell.

580
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,592
I've seen junkies in Chicago

581
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,492
sell their wedding
rings to get a fix.

582
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:51,494
- Yeah, well. We'll see.

583
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,255
- Hey, if you're ever
interested in exercising

584
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,810
that dinosaur yours
again, give me a shout.

585
00:35:57,845 --> 00:35:59,847
I'll give you a quarter
mile headstart.

586
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:09,719
[country bar music]

587
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:21,765
- What's the great tragedy?

588
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:26,011
- Nothing, I was just thinking.

589
00:36:26,045 --> 00:36:28,807
- Yeah, I gave it up. Gives
you wrinkles, you know?

590
00:36:28,841 --> 00:36:32,051
- [Waiter] What can I
get for you?

591
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:33,501
- And for that pearl of wisdom,

592
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:35,538
you can buy me a drink, buddy.

593
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:36,711
Gin and tonic water.

594
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:40,198
- I'll have a shot of
Cuervo and another draw.

595
00:36:43,062 --> 00:36:44,202
- So how's Billy doing?

596
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:45,962
- Just fine.

597
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:47,998
I think he was too drunk
to feel anything.

598
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,139
- Sorry about the whole thing.

599
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,556
- I guess Carl was just mad
at me for dancing with you,

600
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,765
and he took it out on Billy.

601
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,870
- Sure know how to pick them,
Wendy.

602
00:36:57,905 --> 00:36:59,009
- In case you haven't noticed,

603
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,978
there's not a whole hell
of a lot to pick from.

604
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:04,636
Anyway, Carl's definitely
off my Christmas card list.

605
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,502
- Not that. Not the
Christmas card list?

606
00:37:08,536 --> 00:37:11,367
- Yeah, I like to
make him suffer.

607
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,885
- You are cruel.

608
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,853
- And unforgiving.

609
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:18,788
[country bar music continues]

610
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,104
- What should we drink to?

611
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:27,106
- To about closing time.

[Gene chuckles]

614
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:39,809
- Something wrong?

615
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:46,471
You look like you're
lost in space.

616
00:37:47,575 --> 00:37:48,404
- Sorry.

617
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:51,683
I'm just thinking about
some things at work.

618
00:37:56,066 --> 00:38:00,312
- Well, maybe I can help
you get your mind off it.

619
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:05,628
- Oh God, you spilled the wine.

620
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:07,008
- Forgot about it.

621
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:09,701
- I have to get it right
away, or it'll stain.

622
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:13,532
[crickets continue chirping]

623
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:19,331
Gene.

624
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:20,608
What are you doing?

625
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:21,713
- I said, forget it.

626
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:23,749
- It'll ruin it.

627
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:25,475
- I like things ruined.

628
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:28,685
- Good night.

629
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:34,070
- To love, honor, and obey.

630
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,591
For richer, for poorer,
till death do us part.

631
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:40,456
As long as you both shall live,
say it.

632
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:42,285
- What?

633
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,529
- Do you, Julie, take this man

634
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:47,394
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

635
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:49,188
Say it, pumpkin.

636
00:38:49,223 --> 00:38:50,017
- I do.

637
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,951
- You may now kiss the bride.

638
00:38:52,985 --> 00:38:56,713
[crickets continue chirping]

639
00:38:58,094 --> 00:38:58,888
- [Weather Man] That's
gonna give us lows

640
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:01,131
in the 15 degree mark tonight.

641
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,443
Bundle up.

642
00:39:02,478 --> 00:39:05,791
[door opens and closes]

643
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:13,385
- You're putting in a long day.

644
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:17,355
- Guess I'll call it a night.

645
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,287
- No.

646
00:39:20,565 --> 00:39:22,946
Sit down. Have a drink
with your little brother.

647
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:42,380
To mom and dad.

648
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:48,627
May they rest in peace.

649
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:56,152
I still remember the
night you left.

650
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:58,706
I woke up

651
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,261
in the middle of the night,

652
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:04,402
heard all this
screaming going on.

653
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,268
It was you and him going
at it in the kitchen.

654
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:14,273
I thought, one of them is
gonna kill the other for sure.

655
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:21,349
I put a pillow over my head
waiting for a shot or a scream.

656
00:40:21,936 --> 00:40:24,007
But all I heard was the
back door slam,

657
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,599
and your car start, and the
gravel kick up as you tore off.

658
00:40:30,807 --> 00:40:35,260
He stayed up till dawn
waiting for you to come back.

659
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,438
But you never did.

660
00:40:40,472 --> 00:40:44,269
Mom went around crying
for a whole week.

661
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:47,962
But old Avery pretended
nothing happened.

662
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:50,586
He did his work.

663
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:55,142
He read the paper. He listened
to the stock reports at noon.

664
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:56,695
Never said a word about you.

665
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:00,354
Don't know if he was
mad at himself or you.

666
00:41:02,149 --> 00:41:04,427
But you know he was never
the same after that.

667
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:11,917
But you were smart, Kyle.

668
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:14,092
You got the hell out of here.
You're free.

669
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,856
- Maybe my life is not as
wonderful as you think.

670
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:22,963
There is a price for everything.

671
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,378
- Oh tell me about it,
big brother.

672
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:26,863
Let's hear some of your
road weary philosophy

673
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:29,452
about your rough life in
the fast lane.

674
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,593
What do you know about paying
the price? You skipped.

675
00:41:32,628 --> 00:41:34,112
I paid it for you.

676
00:41:34,146 --> 00:41:38,012
I'm the one who had to work
his butt off 16 hours a day,

677
00:41:38,047 --> 00:41:40,394
trying to keep this
godforsaken place together.

678
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,811
All you ever did was
just run around your car,

679
00:41:43,846 --> 00:41:46,124
acting like you were
some big fucking deal.

680
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:49,714
Spare me the bullshit.

- I can't do anything to
change the past, Aaron.

682
00:41:52,233 --> 00:41:54,719
But I'm here now, and
I'm willing to help you.

683
00:41:54,753 --> 00:41:56,203
- You're not here to help me.

684
00:41:58,446 --> 00:42:00,552
Christ. That is a good one.
Kyle.

685
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:02,658
You couldn't care less about me.

686
00:42:02,692 --> 00:42:04,280
You're here 'cause
you're scared.

687
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:05,799
You're scared you're not
gonna make it out there.

688
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:06,834
You want some place to hide.

689
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:08,974
Well, it's not gonna be here.

690
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,631
This is my place.

691
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,151
I built it.

692
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:16,119
I sweated over it, and nobody's
gonna take it away from me.

693
00:42:17,086 --> 00:42:18,674
- I'm not trying to
take it away.

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,338

Listen.

703
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,028
I think that we should talk.

00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,601
- Nick bought a round
of drinks for the house.

708
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:24,878
- What'd he do, win the lotto?

709
00:43:24,912 --> 00:43:27,225
- He sold all that river
land he was trying to unload.

710
00:43:27,259 --> 00:43:29,020
- What dumb sucker bought that?

711
00:43:29,054 --> 00:43:30,331
- Gene Lynch.

[upbeat music]

713
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:14,341
- Place sure brings
back the memories.

714
00:44:14,375 --> 00:44:15,204
- It does.

715
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:18,517
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about

716
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:21,175
the way I acted in the
bank yesterday.

717
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:24,903
I think seeing you just stirred
up a lot of old memories.

718
00:44:24,938 --> 00:44:25,732
- Good or bad?

719
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:27,975
- Both.

720
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,978
- Yeah. They seem to go together
a lot, I've noticed lately.

721
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,845
- Why did you come back?

722
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,161
- It was sort of impulsive.

723
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:44,302
I was driving West in Kansas,

724
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,063
stopped at 3:00 AM to
get gas and,

725
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:51,240
suddenly got the urge
to come home.

726
00:44:51,274 --> 00:44:52,862
- Did you think that
I'd be here?

727
00:44:54,346 --> 00:44:55,865
- I pictured you here.

728
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,694
- Really?

729
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,145
How did you picture me?

730
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,113
About 10 years younger,
I suppose.

731
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:04,529
- Actually you were much older,

732
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:08,982
with long gray hair.

733
00:45:11,847 --> 00:45:13,124
You were at your parents',

734
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,885
in the parlor playing
that big piano.

735
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:20,096
Almost the music I remember
more than the image.

737
00:45:41,152 --> 00:45:42,256

[suspenseful music]

739
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:27,405
- [Julie] I guess I
don't understand

740
00:46:27,439 --> 00:46:30,063
why Terry would just leave town.

741
00:46:31,927 --> 00:46:34,792
It sounds awful doesn't it?

744
00:48:14,581 --> 00:48:16,307
- You're just gonna
go back to him?

745
00:48:17,515 --> 00:48:18,343
- I don't know.

746
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:22,451
I don't know what to do anymore.

747
00:48:26,524 --> 00:48:28,043
I just need some time to think.

748
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:30,079
- Meet me later.

749
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:32,979
No pressure, I promise.

750
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:41,332
- When.

751
00:48:41,366 --> 00:48:44,128
- Six. At the theater.

752
00:48:44,162 --> 00:48:45,715
- Okay, but just for a bit.

753
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:00,868
- When did he leave?

754
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:05,770
Just tell him to call
me if you hear from him.

755
00:49:08,117 --> 00:49:09,705
It's important.

756
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,915
No, I'm not drunk. Goodbye.

- What's the matter?

759
00:49:32,935 --> 00:49:34,523
- You're not gonna believe this.

760
00:49:36,352 --> 00:49:39,217
If you don't believe me, you
can just go look for yourself.

761
00:49:40,494 --> 00:49:42,945
Gene Lynch has got a
lien on your farm.

762
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,050
He must have loaned
Aaron the money,

763
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:46,224
just like he did Terry,
everybody else.

764
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:51,954
Kyle, the guy owns all
the land along the river.

765
00:49:55,475 --> 00:50:00,204
- It's all hills, rocks,
gullies.

766
00:50:00,238 --> 00:50:03,379
It's useless for farming.
Why would he want that?

767
00:50:03,414 --> 00:50:04,242
- I don't know.

768
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,318
- Want to find out?

769
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,632
- Why not?

[contemplative music]

771
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:24,918
See anything?

772
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:27,714
- Just weeds and trees.

773
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,890
- Maybe he just likes
to live next to a river.

774
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,481
- Let's go down and get
a closer look.

776
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:54,775
- Man, we've covered six or
eight miles and got zilch.

I'm beat. Let's just
call it a day.

00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:02,369
- What?

780
00:51:02,404 --> 00:51:03,232
- Listen.

00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,202
- That sounds like a pump.

782
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,067
- Let's go.

[suspenseful music continues]

787
00:51:37,853 --> 00:51:39,889
- Oh shit, it's marijuana,
acres of it.

788
00:51:41,028 --> 00:51:43,790
- I bet this isn't his
only little spot.

789
00:51:43,824 --> 00:51:45,861
That's why the river property.

790
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:48,484
Plenty of water, and impossible
to spot from the air.

791
00:51:49,865 --> 00:51:52,039
- He's a drug dealer. Can
you beat that?

792
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:55,836
No wonder all the easy money.
He's laundering the cash.

793
00:51:59,495 --> 00:52:02,153
You think Aaron's
involved with any of this?

794
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,983
- I don't know.

795
00:52:05,018 --> 00:52:07,538
- And I'd love to see Lynch
get what's coming to him,

796
00:52:07,572 --> 00:52:09,919
but not if it means
burning Aaron too.

797
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:14,476
- Why would he do
something stupid like this?

798
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,650
- He's broke. He's scared.
He's desperate.

799

Same reason as a lot
of other guys.

Well, how the hell did
they find it?

All right look, look. This
is damage control time.

You get a crew out there,

809

and you strip every plot
that we haven't picked yet.

care of these fuckers.

- What?

815
00:54:13,077 --> 00:54:14,492
- I want to know what's
going on around here.

816
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,666
- I don't know about you,

817
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,047
but I'm trying to
harvest my damn crop.

818
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:20,360
- Does that include the pot
growing down by the river?

819
00:54:20,395 --> 00:54:21,879
- What have you done?

820
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:23,605
- Billy found out at the
courthouse that Lynch has been

821
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,090
buying up all the property
up and down the river.

822
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,194
So we checked it out.

823
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:30,336
And we found a marijuana
patch growing on our property.

824
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,408
- Stupid son of a bitch. He
has video cameras down there.

Sally and I have decided to

835
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,849
tell the sheriff everything
and take whatever comes.

836
00:56:11,195 --> 00:56:13,542
- It can't be too bad if
you weren't selling it.

837
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,410
- There's something else
you don't know about.

838
00:56:22,931 --> 00:56:27,349
I saw Terry and Michelle
killed by Lynch's men.

00:56:32,043 --> 00:56:33,907
It's been eaten at me
for a year now.

840
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,118
But I was afraid to tell anybody

841
00:56:38,153 --> 00:56:40,086
for fear of what might
happen to Sally.

842
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:48,991
I'm really sorry for the way
I've been treating everybody.

- Don't worry about it.
We're behind you all the way.

- Thanks.

- How's Sally doing?

00:57:12,946 --> 00:57:14,465
- Okay.

She's still a bit shook up.

to Aunt Addies.

He should be here real soon.

855

Should we get started with this?

01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,270
Don't move.

[rock and roll music]

887
01:04:03,046 --> 01:04:04,047
- [Carl] That idiot.

888
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:05,842
What the hell is he
doing down here?

889
01:04:11,192 --> 01:04:13,677
[guns firing]

890
01:04:21,581 --> 01:04:24,930
- [Aaron] Oh shit.
They're coming, Kyle.

893
01:04:31,488 --> 01:04:33,041
Son of a bitch.

894

[guns continue firing]

895
01:04:42,257 --> 01:04:45,812
If you get ahead of
them, I can get a shot.

896
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,299
Now. Now Kyle.

897
01:04:52,647 --> 01:04:55,892
[guns continue firing]

898
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,879
[rock and roll music continues]

899
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,916
- Now. Let's fucking go!

900
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:24,851
[rock and roll music continues]

901
01:06:05,582 --> 01:06:07,239
- [Aaron] I'm out of shells.

902
01:06:07,273 --> 01:06:11,519
[rock and roll music continues]

903
01:06:11,553 --> 01:06:13,314
- [Kyle] Hang on.

904
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:17,318
[rock and roll music continues]

[car exploding]

906
01:06:40,306 --> 01:06:41,135
- Go.

907
01:06:43,654 --> 01:06:44,483
Go.

908
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,354
- [Announcer] 17 left
in the half.

909
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,080
Byron Bennett's gonna
have to have the ball,

910
01:06:55,114 --> 01:06:57,875
held by Johanne Lewis
to kick if off,

911
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:00,602
because the wind keep
blowing if off the tee.

912
01:07:00,637 --> 01:07:03,329
But the Oscars have
overcome a 45 to 14 lead.

913
01:07:03,364 --> 01:07:05,711
And I agree entirely with
you here, Gary.

914
01:07:05,745 --> 01:07:07,402
The whole package
it's on the line

915
01:07:07,437 --> 01:07:08,576
with, I think, the most
talented team.

916
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,647
Here's the kick.
- Billy?

917
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:13,098
- [Announcer] And it is
Oliver, about seven yards.

918
01:07:13,132 --> 01:07:15,652
Then we'll come out to
the 20 yard line.

919
01:07:15,686 --> 01:07:17,067
- Yeah, I'm just finishing up.

920
01:07:17,102 --> 01:07:18,551
You need help with something?

921
01:07:18,586 --> 01:07:19,380
- No, it's personal.

922
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:21,416
- [Announcer] In the previous
portion of the broadcast.

923
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:23,694
The problem with Lassiter
was clearly not a problem

924
01:07:23,729 --> 01:07:25,351
with lack ability, as a
lack of expertise.

925
01:07:25,386 --> 01:07:26,456
- I hate to ask you.

926
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:30,322
But I don't know who else
I could go to.

927
01:07:30,356 --> 01:07:32,669
We were supposed to meet
at the theater at six.

928
01:07:32,703 --> 01:07:34,015
I just can't do it.

929
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:38,813
- [Announcer] And he's
filled with hope.

930
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:41,057
It's Missouri's first and
10 a the 20 yard line.

931
01:07:41,091 --> 01:07:42,265
A minute, 17 to go in the half.

932
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:43,093
- Thanks.

933
01:07:45,509 --> 01:07:48,064
I'm sure that you
don't understand.

934
01:07:48,098 --> 01:07:50,031
- You gotta do what
you gotta do.

935
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,206
- [Reporter] This is a
KOTD news alert.

936
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,724
Cass County Deputy Sheriff,

937
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:56,175
Gordon Myles, has
been found dead.

938
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:58,384
Authorities believe the
local deputy was slain

939
01:07:58,419 --> 01:08:00,559
during an arrest attempt,
and are seeking

940
01:08:00,593 --> 01:08:04,114
Aaron and Kyle Lockwood in
connection with the crime.

941
01:08:04,149 --> 01:08:05,736
Contact the local
sheriff's office

942
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:08,498
if you have any information
regarding these suspects.

943
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:10,914
- Oh my God.

944
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,778
- What time did you say
you were gonna meet him?

945
01:08:12,812 --> 01:08:14,538
- At six.

I'm coming with you.

950
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:26,516
- Hurry up.

[suspenseful music continues]

952
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:39,460
- Jesus, Kyle. This is crazy.

953
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:44,327
She's Lynch's wife. She probably
told him where to find us.

954
01:08:49,055 --> 01:08:49,918
Get rid of her.

955
01:08:54,371 --> 01:08:56,062
- Hi. Remember me?

956
01:08:56,097 --> 01:08:56,925
- I'm busy.

957
01:08:57,857 --> 01:08:59,687
- What's the matter. Did I
interrupt some sibling rivalry?

958
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:01,654
- I can't talk to you right now.

959
01:09:04,933 --> 01:09:07,108
- Look, if you're mad at me,
why don't you just say so?

960
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:07,971
- I'm not mad at you.

961
01:09:08,005 --> 01:09:10,180
- Wendy, get the hell
out of here now.

962
01:09:10,215 --> 01:09:12,355
- Up yours, Aaron. Who
the hell do you think you-

963
01:09:12,389 --> 01:09:13,494
- Just go.

964
01:09:13,528 --> 01:09:14,874
- Here they come.

[suspenseful music]

966
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:18,637

972
01:10:00,472 --> 01:10:01,576
- Who's gun is that?

973
01:10:01,611 --> 01:10:02,888
- Three.

974
01:10:02,922 --> 01:10:04,372
- Why the hell did you
have to follow us?

975
01:10:04,407 --> 01:10:06,478
- I don't know, 'cause
you were running.

- What's going on, Kyle?

979
01:11:07,021 --> 01:11:08,678
- It's a long story.

980
01:11:08,712 --> 01:11:09,989
- Can you give me the
"Cliff Notes"?

981
01:11:10,024 --> 01:11:12,060
- Gene Lynch had Terry killed.

982
01:11:12,095 --> 01:11:13,476
Aaron saw it.

983
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:14,615
We showed Gordon the
body, and it turns out

984
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:17,203
he's in with Gene, and
Carl, and all the rest.

985
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:22,312
Aaron grabbed the gun,
and it went off.

986
01:11:22,347 --> 01:11:23,175
- Kyle.

987
01:11:25,419 --> 01:11:26,696
- Was he hurt?

988
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,111
- Yeah, he's dead.

989
01:11:28,145 --> 01:11:30,182
- It was self defense. They
were trying to kill us.

Go.

997
01:12:40,114 --> 01:12:41,322
- Wait a minute. Where's Kyle?

998
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,566
- I don't know. He was
right behind us.

999
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,429
Let's go.

1000

Kyle, come on.

- What's going on?

1010
01:13:54,257 --> 01:13:56,017
- Aaron's been hit. We've got
to get him to the hospital.

1011
01:13:56,052 --> 01:13:57,985
- No, not here.

1012
01:13:58,019 --> 01:13:59,504
- You'll bleed to death.

1013
01:13:59,538 --> 01:14:00,988
- We've got to get
him out of town.

1014
01:14:01,022 --> 01:14:01,851
- Where are we going?

1015
01:14:01,885 --> 01:14:04,094
- I don't know, just drive.

1016
01:14:04,129 --> 01:14:06,062
- It's just gonna be cops
along the road.

1017
01:14:07,097 --> 01:14:09,548
- We can go to my
uncle's. He's out of town.

1018
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:10,722
- Okay, go.

1019
01:14:10,756 --> 01:14:13,759
[tires squealing]

1020
01:14:13,794 --> 01:14:16,417
- We've got the main highways
all covered by deputies.

1021
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,799
But I want the back road
blocked off too.

1022
01:14:18,833 --> 01:14:21,249
Those guys know that
country too well.

1023
01:14:21,284 --> 01:14:24,390
Now along the river, I've got
four possible intersections.

1024
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:27,255
- I think we can cover
those for you, Don.

1025
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,912
That's sort of our turf.

1026
01:14:28,947 --> 01:14:30,604
- Okay, Carl.

1027
01:14:30,638 --> 01:14:35,574
That's along river road north
of town, here, here, and here.

1028
01:14:36,748 --> 01:14:39,371
The rest of you will come with
me, and we'll start a sweep.

1029
01:14:39,405 --> 01:14:43,168
Stay on channel 23, and
no talking. Questions?

1030
01:14:45,688 --> 01:14:47,966
Fine. Let's get on with it.

1031
01:14:54,593 --> 01:14:56,940
- That's about all we
can do right now.

1032
01:14:56,975 --> 01:14:57,803
How's it feel?

1033
01:14:58,977 --> 01:15:00,737
- Like a vice grip.

1034
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:03,982
- I got the truck all rigged up.

1035
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:05,949
I think it'll work.

1036
01:15:05,984 --> 01:15:07,779
- All right, let's go.

1037
01:15:09,953 --> 01:15:10,782
- Kyle?

1038
01:15:11,852 --> 01:15:13,647
- Take it easy, Aaron.

[crickets chirping]
[calm music]

1040
01:15:32,493 --> 01:15:33,632
- You gonna be all right?

1041
01:15:35,254 --> 01:15:36,083
- Are you?

1042
01:15:40,087 --> 01:15:41,537
I love you, Kyle.

1043
01:15:43,953 --> 01:15:45,402
- I love you too.

1044
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:53,238
Come on, give me a hand,
all right.

1045
01:15:53,272 --> 01:15:57,035
Watch his arm, feet first.

1046
01:15:57,069 --> 01:16:00,176
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

1047
01:16:03,144 --> 01:16:04,629
Okay get the bale.

1048
01:16:07,183 --> 01:16:09,668
Cover your eyes. Hang tight,
there.

1049
01:16:12,637 --> 01:16:14,086
- Okay, I'm gonna go to Blair.

1050
01:16:14,121 --> 01:16:15,640
Take me about a half hour.

1051
01:16:15,674 --> 01:16:17,055
- [Kyle] Thanks, Billy.

1052
01:16:17,089 --> 01:16:18,297
- [Billy] Watch your ass.

1053
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:22,336
Hey, Julie?

1054
01:16:39,664 --> 01:16:41,597
- That's for me, I take it?

1055
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:42,459
- Yeah.

1056
01:16:45,014 --> 01:16:47,223
- I didn't even have the
guts to give it to you,

1057
01:16:47,257 --> 01:16:48,638
let alone tell you.

1058
01:16:50,813 --> 01:16:51,814
It seems silly now.

1059
01:16:53,263 --> 01:16:55,438
- [Kyle] Do you trust me, Julie?

1060
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:57,820
- [Julie] Yes, I do.

1061
01:16:57,854 --> 01:17:01,168
- I can't explain
everything right now but,

1062
01:17:01,202 --> 01:17:04,999
I need your records
down at the bank.

1063
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:06,104
- Which ones?

1064
01:17:07,553 --> 01:17:11,557
- Your husband's currency
transaction files.

1065
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:14,112
- My father oversaw
them personally.

1066
01:17:15,734 --> 01:17:17,391
- I still need them.

1067
01:17:19,704 --> 01:17:20,670
- All right.

1068
01:17:21,947 --> 01:17:22,776
- Thanks.

1069
01:17:25,986 --> 01:17:27,884
Wendy can give you a
ride back to town.

1070
01:17:31,129 --> 01:17:31,957
I'm sorry.

1071
01:17:34,028 --> 01:17:34,857
- So am I.

1072
01:17:36,065 --> 01:17:41,035
[somber music]
[crickets chirping]

1073
01:18:10,513 --> 01:18:12,549
- There's a coffee
machine down the hall.

1074
01:18:13,378 --> 01:18:14,517
This could take awhile.

1075
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:16,553
- Once a waitress,
always a waitress.

1076
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:27,357
- [Julie] Dear Kyle, they
say you should be careful

1077
01:18:27,392 --> 01:18:30,119
what you wish for
because it may come true.

1078
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:31,776
I think I understand that now.

1079
01:18:32,915 --> 01:18:34,848
Since you left, I've
had an emptiness in me

1080
01:18:34,882 --> 01:18:36,642
that I thought only
you could fill.

1081
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:39,922
No matter how hard I
tried to forget,

1082
01:18:39,956 --> 01:18:43,511
it was always you who
came to me in my dream.

1083
01:18:45,203 --> 01:18:46,722
And through all the years
I've clung to the thought

1084
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:49,725
that you would come back
and we'd be together.

1085
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:51,140
But that can never be.

1086
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:56,628
Time has parted us, and my
little girl dreams have to die

1087
01:18:56,662 --> 01:18:59,735
so that I can find out
who I really am.

1088
01:19:00,908 --> 01:19:03,669
Please try to understand,
love Julie.

1089
01:19:06,569 --> 01:19:08,985
[calm music]

1090
01:19:18,374 --> 01:19:21,239
- You know, one of the first
signs of marital difficulties

1091
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:24,000
is spending too much time
at the office?

1092
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:27,072
[suspenseful music]

1093
01:19:29,661 --> 01:19:31,490
Oh, what have we here?

1094
01:19:34,045 --> 01:19:36,737
Don't you want to share
your work problems with me?

1095
01:19:42,363 --> 01:19:43,192
- Dad?

1096
01:19:44,503 --> 01:19:46,264
- I had no choice.

1097
01:19:46,298 --> 01:19:49,336
It was either take his money
or let the bank go under.

1098
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:51,925
It would have destroyed
the whole community.

1099
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:54,341
- According to these files, Sam,

1100
01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:57,620
you accepted some rather
large deposits

1101
01:19:57,654 --> 01:19:59,484
from me that you didn't report.

1102
01:20:01,244 --> 01:20:03,868
That's against federal
regulations, you know?

1103
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:07,664
It almost looks like you've
been laundering money.

1104
01:20:07,699 --> 01:20:09,839
- You bastard.

1105
01:20:09,874 --> 01:20:11,496
This is the end.

1106
01:20:11,530 --> 01:20:14,085
I don't care what happens
to me or the bank.

1107
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:15,327
I'm turning you over.

1108
01:20:15,362 --> 01:20:17,329
- You really don't care, Sam?

1109
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,851
Well, I don't really
care either.

1110
01:20:24,578 --> 01:20:25,924
Hey.

1111
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:28,133
We don't care, right?

1112
01:20:28,168 --> 01:20:30,964
Live or die. What
difference does it make?

1113
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:36,107
Good. Let's go.

1114
01:20:43,528 --> 01:20:46,531
[suspenseful music]

1115
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:59,647
[phone ringing]

1116
01:21:05,757 --> 01:21:07,586
- [Wendy] Kyle. Kyle, it's me.

1117
01:21:09,174 --> 01:21:10,693
- Where are you?
What's going on?

1118
01:21:10,727 --> 01:21:13,144
- I'm at the bank. I
get locked in.

1119
01:21:13,178 --> 01:21:14,145
- [Kyle] Where's Julie?

1120
01:21:14,179 --> 01:21:16,630
- She left with Gene and
her dad. He's got a gun.

1121
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:22,843
[grunting]

1122
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:23,706
What should I do?

1123
01:21:24,949 --> 01:21:25,777
Kyle?

1124
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,678
Kyle, are you there? Kyle?

1125
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:40,757
- Come in, come in. Mi
casa es su casa.

1126
01:21:48,524 --> 01:21:51,251
Nothing ever turns out
the way you plan, does it?

1127
01:21:52,321 --> 01:21:53,736
I suppose this means
they're gonna

1128
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:56,290
take my name off the
JC's plaque.

1129
01:21:58,465 --> 01:22:01,606
God. How did I last
here so long?

1130
01:22:03,332 --> 01:22:05,817
It'll be good to get back
in the real world again.

1131
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:09,579
Why are you so glum?

1132
01:22:11,478 --> 01:22:14,377
Nobody's ever what they
seem to be, baby.

1133
01:22:14,412 --> 01:22:18,934
Not daddy-kins here,
not hubby, not even you.

1134
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,074
That's right.

1135
01:22:22,316 --> 01:22:25,285
You're not the innocent
prom queen anymore.

1136
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:26,769
- Don't touch me.

1137
01:22:26,803 --> 01:22:29,461
[phone ringing]

1138
01:22:31,705 --> 01:22:33,500
- Cass County Sheriff's,
Deputy Ross.

1139
01:22:35,019 --> 01:22:38,160
Yes, sir. Oh, no kidding. Okay,
hang on.

1140
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:39,264
Hey Don, it's for you.

1141
01:22:40,334 --> 01:22:42,129
- Get a number Phil, I'm busy.

1142
01:22:42,164 --> 01:22:43,924
- It's a Washington
County Sheriff.

1143
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:46,340
They got Aaron.

1144
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,034
Billy brought him in last night.

1145
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:50,896
- Kyle?

1146
01:22:52,105 --> 01:22:54,210
- No sign of him, and
Billy's not talking.

1147
01:22:55,211 --> 01:22:56,626
- Well, we'll see about that.

1148
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:02,529
- Yeah.

1149
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:04,324
I'll need it first
thing this morning.

1150
01:23:06,222 --> 01:23:08,776
I'll need full tanks,

1151
01:23:08,811 --> 01:23:13,333
and I will give you my
flight plan when I get it in.

1152
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:14,161
That's right.

1153
01:23:15,404 --> 01:23:16,922
Well, put it on my bill.

1154
01:23:19,028 --> 01:23:20,202
Thank you.

1155
01:23:24,344 --> 01:23:27,140
I love it when the call my Mr.
Lynch.

1156
01:23:27,174 --> 01:23:30,729
Money does weird things
to people, you know.

1157
01:23:30,764 --> 01:23:32,110
Here you go, my darling,

1158
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:37,633
a little token of my
esteem and affection.

1159
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:41,430
Open it.

1160
01:23:45,227 --> 01:23:46,228
Please.

1161
01:23:47,263 --> 01:23:50,232
I hope they fit. They
only had one size.

1162
01:23:54,098 --> 01:23:57,411
Well, I guess it's time to
depart this veil of tears.

1163
01:23:59,068 --> 01:24:01,243
God, listen to me now.

1164
01:24:03,348 --> 01:24:07,421
Down, Sam. Down, down, down.

1165
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:08,871
You don't know how much pleasure

1166
01:24:08,905 --> 01:24:11,218
I would derive from
shooting a banker.

1167
01:24:11,253 --> 01:24:12,047
Put them on.

1168
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,573
Just think of this as the
honeymoon that we never had.

1169
01:24:22,919 --> 01:24:26,199
And Sam, no stupid phone calls.

1170
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:29,167
It is virtually impossible

1171
01:24:29,202 --> 01:24:32,584
to get blood out of
genuine leather seats.

1172
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:33,861
Sayonara.

1173
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,938
- Goddamn it, where the
hell are they?

1174
01:24:41,973 --> 01:24:43,768
Lynch will be here any minute.

1175
01:24:43,802 --> 01:24:45,010
- Chip, do you copy me?

1176
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,289
Chip, goddamn it.

1177
01:24:48,738 --> 01:24:49,774

Come again?

1180
01:24:58,334 --> 01:24:59,646
Your signal's too weak.

1181
01:25:01,993 --> 01:25:03,926
- Put it away. Here they come.

[suspenseful music]

1183
01:25:36,545 --> 01:25:39,479
- What's going on? Where's Gene?

1184
01:25:39,513 --> 01:25:40,618
- [Carl] He'll be here.

1185
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:42,827
- Who's this?

1186
01:25:42,861 --> 01:25:45,692
- This is the nosy little
asshole who turned us in.

1187
01:25:45,726 --> 01:25:48,039
I bet your shitting your pants.

1188
01:25:48,073 --> 01:25:49,868
- What'd you bring him here for?

1189
01:25:49,903 --> 01:25:52,561
- To blow his
fucking brains out.

1190
01:25:52,595 --> 01:25:54,459
- No, we don't want any
part of this.

1191
01:25:54,494 --> 01:25:55,771
Murder wasn't in the deal.

1192
01:25:56,772 --> 01:25:58,049
- But, why should you care?

1193
01:25:58,083 --> 01:26:00,638
You guys don't have
casualties in Chicago?

1194
01:26:00,672 --> 01:26:03,088
- [Guest] I think we'll
wait till Gene gets here.

1195
01:26:03,123 --> 01:26:03,917
- Who are you?

1196
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:05,436
- You know damn well who we are.

1197
01:26:07,438 --> 01:26:09,647
- [Chip] This is Chip. Air
support is in the vicinity.

1198
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:10,579
Where are you guys?

1199
01:26:10,613 --> 01:26:11,476

Hey, Gene?

It's all over.

Are you dizzy?

But you're seeing double too,
huh?

01:31:03,596 --> 01:31:05,114
No hard feelings though, huh?

1236
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:07,703
Business.

[sirens blaring]

1239
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:28,966
Thank God you got here, Don.

1240
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,968
I didn't know what I was
gonna do next.

1241
01:31:31,002 --> 01:31:33,695
It looks like we caught
it just in time.

1242
01:31:33,729 --> 01:31:36,318
- Good work, Gene.
You all right?

1243
01:31:36,352 --> 01:31:38,458
- Oh yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1244
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:39,528
A bit shaky I guess.

1245
01:31:41,841 --> 01:31:43,325
- Better give me the gun now.

1246
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:45,914
- Sheriff, drop your gun
or I'll blow your head off.

1247
01:31:47,778 --> 01:31:48,606
Now.

1248
01:31:51,195 --> 01:31:52,610
That's right.

1249
01:31:52,645 --> 01:31:55,406
Right, we got no problems here.

1250
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,443
[suspenseful music]

1251
01:32:03,276 --> 01:32:05,692
I didn't want to have
to do this, Don.

1252
01:32:05,727 --> 01:32:07,245
I mean how would it look,

1253
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:09,385
you arresting the JC's
man of the year?

1254

[suspenseful music]

1255
01:32:25,263 --> 01:32:27,093
I got Julie in the cockpit.

1256
01:32:28,059 --> 01:32:30,579
If anybody moves out here,
I kill her.

[suspenseful music]

1258
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:38,104
So long, guys. It's been
fun but I gotta fly.

1259
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,453
- Gene. Look out behind you.

[laughing]

1261
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:49,287

do better than that.

- I don't know how we
did it, but we did it.

1265
01:33:27,498 --> 01:33:29,604
It almost looks too
pretty to drive now.

1266
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:32,227
Okay you guys, get in the shot.

1267
01:33:33,953 --> 01:33:36,162

01:33:38,198 --> 01:33:41,098
Okay, everybody. Say Cheerios.

- Oh, it's beautiful. You
guys should really be proud.

1272
01:33:49,969 --> 01:33:51,211
- What guys?

1273
01:33:51,246 --> 01:33:54,145
All they did was gab about
their childhood and drink beer.

1274
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:57,286
This is car is 99%
Rocket Billy Bones.

1275

1276
01:33:58,702 --> 01:34:01,014

some sandwiches,

1277
01:34:01,049 --> 01:34:03,948
in case you're not quite
ready for that diner food yet.

1278
01:34:03,983 --> 01:34:06,088
- Feels like there's
enough for a week.

1279
01:34:06,123 --> 01:34:07,607
- Gonna miss you, Kyle.

1280

I'm gonna miss all of you.

1282
01:34:12,888 --> 01:34:15,719
- Well, Christmas is
just around the corner.

1283
01:34:15,753 --> 01:34:17,824
We expect to see you then.

1284
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:18,963
- It's a date.

1285
01:34:18,998 --> 01:34:20,793
- Have you heard from Julie?

1286
01:34:20,827 --> 01:34:23,312
- She's down in Kansas
city with her aunt.

1287
01:34:23,347 --> 01:34:26,108
She seems to like it
okay. She going to school.

1288
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:28,110
- Gonna make a visit?

1289
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:32,252
- I think I'm headed in a
new direction.

1290
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:39,397
I better give this
buggy a test ride.

1291
01:34:39,432 --> 01:34:41,020
- Now, don't burn her up
the first day out there.

1292
01:34:41,054 --> 01:34:42,815
I don't want to have to
tow you in, okay?

1293
01:34:42,849 --> 01:34:44,679
- You ever needed
someone to talk to,

1294
01:34:45,576 --> 01:34:47,509
give me a call, I'm in the book.

1295
01:34:47,543 --> 01:34:48,544
- Heck yeah.

1296
01:34:49,822 --> 01:34:53,377
- If you see Wendy, tell
her goodbye and,

1297
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:55,862
give her my love.

1298
01:34:55,897 --> 01:34:57,208

Take care, Kyle.

[contemplative music]

1306

- Nice outfit. What
are you doing?

1310
01:36:37,826 --> 01:36:40,070
- What people at bus
stops usually do.

1311
01:36:40,104 --> 01:36:40,898
- Where are you going?

1312
01:36:40,933 --> 01:36:42,106
- I don't know.

1313
01:36:43,004 --> 01:36:44,868
I thought I might check
out LA for the Winter.

1314
01:36:44,902 --> 01:36:46,559
- What are you gonna
do when you get there?

1315
01:36:46,593 --> 01:36:47,491
- Whatever I want.

1316
01:36:48,354 --> 01:36:50,563
Better move your car. The
bus will be here soon.

1317
01:36:51,495 --> 01:36:52,807
- What do you want from me?

1318
01:36:55,016 --> 01:36:56,120
- I don't know.

1319
01:36:57,328 --> 01:36:59,192
A ride, maybe, if
you're going my way.

1320
01:37:01,919 --> 01:37:02,747
- Okay, get in.

1321
01:37:03,956 --> 01:37:05,060
