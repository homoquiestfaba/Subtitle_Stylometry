THEME SONG: Toxic Crusaders.

00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,653
Toxic Crusaders.

4
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,155
I had no friends.

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,658
No girls'd hug me til I
got radioactive ugly.

6
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:29,130
Toxic Crusaders.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,632
I live in a dump 'cause
the rent's real low.

8
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:34,368
Got a little pet
Blobbie who love me so.

00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:39,107
Toxic Crusaders.

10
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:43,577
Now me and the boys
fight against wrong.

11
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:45,579
Now we're hideously deformed.

12
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,995
Hey, I'm sitting on
top of the world

13
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:05,433
with my mop, tutu, and girl.

14
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,533
Wow!

15
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:10,304

MALE VOICE (ON RADIO):
Good morning, Island City!

19
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:26,254
This is radio station W-O-P-U,
reminding everyone we've got

20
00:01:26,354 --> 00:01:27,988
a stage 87 smog alert.

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,323
So wear your gas mask.

22
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,091
And remember, don't
get caught outside

23
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,460
during an acid rainstorm.

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,495
It's a horrible way to go.

25
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,398
I love this town!

26
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,967
Do you know why I love this town?

27
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,635
Because you own it?

28
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:44,772
Because it's the most polluted
city in the world.

29
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:49,277
And I, Dr. Killemoff,
made it that way.

30
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:54,081
Behold, thy evil genius!

[woof] [woof]

36
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,794
I got to get another job.

37
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,196
This guy's a loser.

38
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,165
(YELLING) I have to get this
stupid thing fixed!

Look.

43
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,675
I know you're an evil genius, Doc.

44
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,175
What I don't know is where you want

45
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:25,112
me to dump this Grossolium 90.

46
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,647
Ah, yes.

47
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:31,552
Grossolium... the deadliest toxic
waste known to man.

48
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,687
Dump it in the last unpolluted city

49
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,724
in New Jersey... Tromaville.

50
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,327
I don't know if that's such
a good idea, Doc.

51
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:41,329
What if some complete
and hopeless nerd

52
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,497
falls into the Grossolium
and transforms

53
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:46,467
into a hideously deformed creature
of superhuman size

54
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,567

55
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,102
Don't be ridiculous!

Complete and hopeless nerd.

57
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,075
Oh, I wish I wasn't a complete
and hopeless nerd.

58
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,010
Maybe then I'd have
a girlfriend who

59
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,813
loves me for who I am, or at least

60
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,782
confuses me with someone else.

61

on our date tonight.

00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,447
How many people have a
home that glows in the dark?

190
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,590
What else I little fella
why you're a cute little blob

191
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:44,690
see as I told you I
know how about well

192
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:50,037
Bobby here's where I will live my
life all alone with no one

193
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,239
to love or care for me but you.

194
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:53,140
[female singing]

195
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,941
Hey.

196
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,611
What's that beautiful sound?

197
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:58,411
[accordion playing]

198
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,512

199
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,883
[humming]

200
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,887
(SINGING) The world is a beautiful.

201
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,390
The world is love.

202
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,893
We are brothers and sisters.

203
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:18,365
Of that I'm pretty sure of.

204
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:21,969
Hey, sweet thing, you
got something we want.

205
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:24,104
Want to guess what it is?

206
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:25,472
[giggles] Gee.

207
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,973
Do I win anything if I guess right?

208
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,543
I really could use a microwave or
maybe a waffle iron.

209
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:30,778
I'd love a waffle iron.

210
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:31,579
Oh!

211
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,379
I know what I need.

212
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,614
How about a socket wrench?

213
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,283
The new accordion, dumbo.

214
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:39,587
Give it, now!

215
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,520
Hey.

216
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,855
This is weird.

217
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,692
Something bad is happening nearby.

218
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,293
I can feel it in my body.

219
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,728
BLONDE GIRL: Somebody help me!

220
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,662
Please!

221
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,298
Let go of my accordion!

222
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,566
Now I'm sure!

223
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,602
Somebody's hurting an accordion!

224
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,036
Help!

225
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,605
Hey, you plunks!

226
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,972
Leave that girl alone.

227
00:08:59,072 --> 00:08:59,773
Oh.

228
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,041
Look fellas.

229
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,376
It's Melvin, the mop boy.

230
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:06,246
Your days up picking on nerds
and accordion players

231
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,748
are over, Bonehead.

232
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,984
Let's get him!

233
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,020
[grunt]

234
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,756
This'll teach you to mess with a
hideously deformed creature

235
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:17,591
of superhuman size and strength.

236
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,427
[whir]

237
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,862
Whoa!

[splash]

239
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,533
Hey, man.

240
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,168
What's happening to me?

241
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:31,504
I can't get out of here.

242
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:32,740
Feel lucky, punk?

243
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,540
Not really.

244
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,442
No.

245
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:36,542
[clatter]

246
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,543
Oh!

247
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:41,955
Are you OK?

248
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,050
Fine, thanks to you.

249
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,317
I did lose my contact lenses.

250
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,686
So I can't see too good.

251
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:46,486
Gosh.

252
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,388
You're very handsome.

253
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:51,659
Boy, this really is my lucky day.

254
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:04,037
[yelling]

255
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,412
Yvonne.

256
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:13,981
Gee, that's a pretty name.

257
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,082
Thanks.

258
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,862
It means pretty girl
who walks in sunlight

259
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,110
or big, rusty popper scooper.

260
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:18,886
I forget which.

261
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,253
So what should I call you?

262
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,122
Well, I used to be called Melvin.

263
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,958
But now that I've had a small
accident with toxic chemicals,

264
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:26,626
I think I need a new name.

265
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:29,296
[gasp] How about if I call
you Chemicals, or Mr. Chemicals,

266
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:31,498
or Bucky Kid, or how about...
Toxie!

267
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,399
That's it.

268
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,768
You can call me Toxie.

269
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,103
Uh-oh.

270
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,071
I'm getting that
weird feeling again.

271
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,374
Something evil is happening, and
it's happening real close.

272
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,776
Help!

273
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,645
Bad guys are going to destroy our
orphanage so they can build

274
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,081
a poisonous chemical plant!

275
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:48,882
Hm.

276
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:49,983
Where could that evil be?

277
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:50,751
[squeak]

278
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,584
Huh?

279
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,720
Hey!

280
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,888
Bad guys are trying
to destroy that orphanage.

281
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,489
That's not right!

282
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,725
[squeaking]

283
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,226
And my mop is alive.

284
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,566
I bet that happened when it fell
into the toxic chemicals

285
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,329
with me.

286
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,530
OK, mop.

287
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,734
Let's you and me
clean up this mess.

Have no fear.

291
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:16,676
Toxie's here.

292
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,678
Let go of her, you creep!

00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,851
Oh, thank you Toxie!

295
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:25,352
You're welcome, sweetheart.

296
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,820
Now please step aside.

297
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,890
A battle against evil is no
place for a little girl.

298
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,324
Whoa!

299
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,726
Are you all right?

300
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,028
I'm having a ball!

Ha-ha!

306
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,272
Ah!

307
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,440
Ha-ha!

308
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,676
Hey, you shot my tutu.

309
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,478
No I'm really mad.

(CHANTING) Toxie!

316
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:26,313
Toxie!

317
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,748
Can you tell our home
viewers what just happened here?

318
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:31,785
I'm not sure, but I think my new
boyfriend talks to his mop.

319
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,585
Oh, yeah.

320
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,921
I'll tell you what happened.

321
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:37,157
My son, Melvin Junko, who is
know a hideously deformed

322
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,827
creature with superhuman
size and strength,

323
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:44,097
saved those poor orphans from being
thrown out of their home.

324
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,899
We understand you
name is Melvin Junko.

325
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,999
Not anymore.

326
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,102
From now on my name
is Toxie, and I'm

327
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,572
a crusader against pollution,
crime, and other stuff.

328
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:56,643
So I guess we could call you
the Toxic Crusader.

329
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:57,878
Hey, yeah.

330
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,046
I'd like that!

331
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,048
The Toxic Crusader!

332
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:01,849
Neat!

333
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,650
No!

334
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,385
How could this be happening?

335
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,087
I know this is.

336
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,355
What did you say?

337
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,455
Nothing.

338
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,124
He must be stopped!

339
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:14,761
This... this Toxic Crusader must be

340
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:18,866
eradicated or all my plans
to pollute the world

341
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,100
will be destroyed!

342
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,170
Let me take care of
this Toxic Crusader!

343
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,805
Why should I give you
the pleasure of killing him?

344
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,741
Because he did this to me!

345
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,077
All right, then.

346
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:33,580
Do away with him, and
you will be well rewarded.

347
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,015
No sweat!

348
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:38,718
You can say goodbye to
the Toxic Crusader!

349
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,818
Goodbye!

What's the matter, little girl?

(CRYING) Toxie, my kitty cat's
stuck in the tree.

358
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,216
Aw.

359
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,017
Don't cry.

360
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:11,218
I'll get your kitty down.

00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:14,387

What happened to the happy music?

Oh, well.

Get ready to become
the Crust Crusader.

376
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:51,158
Uh-oh I got that old feeling.

377
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,092
Oh, no!

378
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,494
Look out little girl!

379
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,929
Look out!

380
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:57,830
[rumble]

381
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,732
Are you OK, Toxie?

382
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,534
Actually, I'm feeling
a little rundown.

383
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,570
He's moving in for the kill.

384
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,040
This is the end of
the Toxic Crusader.

385
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,542
I don't know if that
would kill him off.

386
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,162
What if old Toxie
jumps out of the way

387
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:13,346
and defeats Bonehead
with his super-powered mop?

388
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,648
Don't be ridiculous!

389
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,748
Are you ready, mop?

390
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,424
Whoa!

391
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:30,696
Wa-hoo!

392
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,599
Oh, no!

393
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,567
Bonehead has been
defeated by the Toxic.

394
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,604
Crusader's cursed mop!

395
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:39,139
I told you so.

396
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,239
What did you say?

397
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:41,541
Nothing.

398
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:46,013
I will have to put an end
to this Toxic Crusader myself.

399
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,148
Psycho, prepare my
radiation rangers

400
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:53,820
for battle, while I prepare
a special weapon just in case.

401
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,088
He still might beat
us if he's helped

402
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,789
by other hideously
deformed creatures

403
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,691
with superhuman size and strength.

404
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,791
Psycho!

405
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:03,030
I grow weary of your
ridiculous ideas.

406
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:03,830
Sorry.

407
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:04,931
Bad guys are so stupid.

408
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,403
[knocking]

409
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,372
Yvonne, it's me, Toxie.

410
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,307
Oh, Toxie, I missed you so!

411
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,208
Ah!

412
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,009
Ugh.

413
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,410
Honey, where are ya?

414
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,578
I'm right here, Yvonne.

415
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:19,546
Oh, goodie.

416
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,980
I have a surprise for you.

417
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,317
I've got new glasses so I
can finally see your gorgeous face.

418
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:27,087
[gasp] Yvonne, no!

419
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,988
[scream]

420
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,558
Oh, I should have known
this would happen.

421
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:34,861
How could a beautiful, intelligent
girl like Yvonne

422
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,663
ever fall for a hideously deformed

423
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:37,897
creature such as myself?

424
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,666
But I did fall for you, Toxie.

425
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:40,867
Huh?

426
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,403
But the minute you saw
how ugly I am, you screamed.

427
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:44,503
You're not ugly.

428
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,572
You're very handsome.

429
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,707
It's your tie that made me scream.

430
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,509
Now that's ugly.

431
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:50,969
I mean, more than ugly.
It's gross.

432
00:16:50,996 --> 00:16:51,711
OK.

433
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:52,879
So she's just beautiful.

434
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,500
Uh, Toxie honey, I don't think
I can go out tonight.

435
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,633
I really have to wash my hair.

436
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,034
Can I help you?

437
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,105
Say your prayers, Toxic Crusader.

438
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:18,905
Why?

439
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,005
Am I going to bed now?

440
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,208
No.

441
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:24,811
You are going to die for standing
in the way of my plans

442
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,413
to pollute Tromaville.

443
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,615
But why do you want to
pollute Tromaville?

444
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,584
What good does it do anybody to
poison the environment?

445
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,653
I've always wondered that myself.

446
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,224
It may be poison to
humans, but not to the people

447
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:41,461
of my planet Smogula.

448
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,062
Oh, man.

449
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,532
I'm working for a cockroach?

450
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,401
For Smogulans to take
over this planet,

451
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,605
the air and water must be first
poisoned to our liking.

452
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,208
But if you poison our planet...
As if we can't do it

453
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:58,345
ourselves... then all human and
animal life will die.

454
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,113
What's your point?

455
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:01,381
Oh.

456
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,951
I'm definitely in the
presence of some big time evil.

457
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:07,287
My point is this, butthead!

458
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:10,857
This is my planet... even though
I don't look like I'm from it.

459
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,126
And this is my town,
which means it's

460
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,428
my job to keep it safe, beautiful,

461
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,297
and free from pollution.

462
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:21,534
Then prepare to die,
Toxic Crusader.

463
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:24,404
Apocalypse now!

464
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,940
[gunfire]

465
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,977
I sure could use some help.

466
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:34,381
[gunfire]

467
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,616
Excuse me, but, uh,
me and my friend

468
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:39,886
are looking for a hideously
deformed creature named Toxic.

469
00:18:39,986 --> 00:18:40,687
Have you seen him?

470
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,522
He's up there.

471
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,323
Oh, yeah.

472
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:44,224
I see him.

473
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,859
[sneeze]

474
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,094
Gesundheit.

475
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,562
Thank you.

476
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,662
[grunting]

477
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,531
[crash]

478
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,631
You fools!

479
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,500
Get him!

480
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,968
I hate this part.

481
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,970
It's cleanup time!

482
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,771
Oh, sorry.

483
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,672
[smacks]

484
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,573
[grunting]

485
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,741
Excuse me.

486
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:02,975
My name's No-Zone.

487
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,178
This is my friend,
Major Disaster.

488
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:08,815
We're both hideously deformed
creatures with superhuman size

489
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,217
and strength.

490
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,484
Really? Me too.

491
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:12,585
Yeah. We know.

492
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,488
We saw you on TV and wanted
to come join you.

493
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:18,758
Well, I have to warn
you, it's a tough job.

494
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,960
There's no dental plan,
and we don't get

495
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,562
any piece of our merchandising.

496
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:23,662
Ah, it's OK.

497
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,465
We just want to fight bad guys.

498
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,266
Great.

499
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,967
You're hired!

500
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,236
What's Major Disaster doing?

501
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,571
Uh, he has the power
to control to control plants.

502
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,106
It takes him a few seconds to
get going though.

503
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,145
- Hey.
- What's going on?

504
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:39,946
[interposing voices]

505
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,549
[yelling]
[whoosh]

506
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,552
Hey, that's a cool superpower.

507
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,520
DR. KILLEMOFF: Release Aludo.

508
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:56,229
Destroy the Toxic Crusader
and his friends.

509
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,165
[mumbles]

510
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,132
Uh, look.

511
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,502
It's some kind of living oil slick.

512
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,303
Mop!

513
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,271
Come back!

514
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,439
[squeaking]

515
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,940
Mop hates a mess.

516
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,041
Oh, no!

517
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,877
That thing ate my mop.

518
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,012
Well, what'll we do now?

519
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:13,946
I've got an idea.

520
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,046
Follow me!

521
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,750
Kitty litter?

522
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,453
What are we doing
with kitty litter?

523
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,423
Toxie, we're not fighting
Heathcliff.

524
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:24,524
Trust me.

525
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,626
Just empty the kitty
litter on the ground.

526
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,296
Now, No-Zone, aim
your schnozzle at that thing

527
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:31,163
and use your sweet power!

528
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,799
You've got it, buddy.

529
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,868
[sneeze]

530
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,573
[wind]

531
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:44,110
The kitty litter is
drying up the oil slick.

532
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,946
[ka-boom]

533
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,348
[clink]

534
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,150
Oh, mop.

535
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,018
Are you OK?

536
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,118
[squeak]

537
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,121
DR. KILLEMOFF:
This can't be happening!

538
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,590
If it weren't for those other two

539
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,027
hideously deformed creatures
helping the Toxic Crusader,

540
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,995
I would have defeated him.

541
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,797
I told you so.

542
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:05,897
Ah!

543
00:21:08,568 --> 00:21:09,902
[crash]

544
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,104
Oh, Toxie, I'm so proud of you.

545
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:13,606
You saved Tromaville.

546
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,642
Of course he saved Tromaville.

547
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,509
He's my son.

548
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,077
He's a hero.

549
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,379
I'm no hero, Mom.

550
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,315
I'm just doing my part
to keep Tromaville beautiful,

551
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,883
safe, and free from pollution.

552
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:24,684
Gee.

553
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,619
What an amazing coincidence.

554
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,788
All three of us we returned
into hideously

555
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,391
deformed creatures with
superhuman size and strength

556
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,559
by accident.

557
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,960
That's right.

558
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,729
I was a soldier in the Army,
and when I fell into a radioactive

559
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,097
swamp.

560
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,478
And I was a pilot when I
flew through a whole in the ozone

561
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:43,970
and crashed my plane into
a silo of radioactive pepper.

562
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,071
[sneeze]

563
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,238
Gesundheit.

564
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:47,640
Thank you.

565
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,544
Well, lucky for us, we were
all hideously deformed, because now

566
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,847
we're The Toxic Crusaders!

567
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:57,417
Sounds like a good
name for a TV show.

568
00:21:57,517 --> 00:22:01,220
I brought some dinner for you boys.

569
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,423
I made your favorite... burgers.

570
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,324
[giggling]
Guess what, everybody?

571
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,505
I wrote a new song about
my brave, handsome boyfriend

572
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:08,561
and his two new buddies.

573
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,796
Listen.

574
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:13,933
(SINGING) Hideously deformed,
super humanly strong,

575
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:20,006
they're the toxic crusaders, and
they fight against wrong.

576
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,642
A one, a two, a three!

577
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,545
(SINGING)
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

578
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:31,384
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

579
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,520
Of that we're pretty sure of.

580
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,320
[sneezes]

581
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,287
TOXIE: Gesundheit.

582
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:37,590
(SINGING)
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

583
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,427
We're the Toxic Crusaders.

584
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:44,697
Of that, we're pretty sure of.

585
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:47,734
