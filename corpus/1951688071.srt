1
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,505
Please, come in.

2
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,708
Your son is a very bright
little boy, Miss Davidson.

3
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,321
Thank you. Let's get to the point.
What do the tests reveal?

4
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,317
Is this on or off the record?

5
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:36,921
Sorry, force of habit.

6
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:43,093
Okay. While he may have ADD,
I wouldn't make the diagnosis quite yet.

7
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,238
I'd like to see him again
in about a year, though.

8
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,065
- However...
- Oh, boy, it's a "but."

9
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,972
There's always a but.

10
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,137
What is it?
I don't spend enough time with him?

11
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,807
Listen, I would spend all the time
in the world if I could but I have a job.

12
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:03,012
- I love my job. What's wrong with that?
- Relax, Miss Davidson.

13
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,353
The best mother is a happy mother.
I'm a mother too, a working mother.

14
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,223
I only did clinical research
when my daughters were young.

15
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,058
But you're doing a wonderful job,
that's clear.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,066
- Still, he does have unresolved anger.
- About what?

17
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:21,904
There is no strong male figure in his life.

18
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:26,444
Well, I have a boyfriend.
He's a photojournalist.

19
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,844
- Pulitzer Prize winner.
- Congratulations.

20
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,315
Look, studies show
that father-figure absence...

21
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,886
...negatively impacts children,
especially boys.

22
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,922
There's a higher rate
of substance abuse, truancy...

23
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,027
I get it. It's my fault, you're saying?
I can't do it by myself?

24
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,123
My research said plenty of successful,
well-adjusted, happy kids...

25
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,062
...come from single-parent households.

26
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,601
No one's blaming you, Miss Davidson.
Of course you can do it on your own.

27
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,102
But do you really want to?

28
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:58,700
It's my choice to be a single mother.
Otherwise, I'd just be single, alone.

29
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,646
Look, mother to mother,
the kid can only fill your void for so long.

30
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,548
And boys need a father figure.

31
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,279
Jake.

32
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,585
Jake.

33
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:19,929
Jake, come sit down and have your cereal.
What do you want for lunch today, sweetie?

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,795
Horatio's daddy took Horatio
to the Yankees.

35
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,938
You and I go to the Yankees.
Lunch, what will it be, huh?

36
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,403
He sat behind the dugout. He's so lucky.

37
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,876
Oh. Mom's gotta go to work,
you have to go to school. Lunch.

38
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,173
Ice cream.

39
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,834
Hey.

40
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,770
Have a good day.

41
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,280
Let go.

42
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,784
- Hey, Horatio, get off him.
- He started it.

43
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,620
Get back in line.

44
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,189
Get back in line.

45
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,293
Both of you.

46
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,009
Hey, Stuart, I got a phoner tomorrow
with Yusuf Islam.

47
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,517
- Some kind of terrorist?
- Former pop star.

48
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,680
- Same thing.
- He used to be Cat Stevens.

49
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,622
Turned his back on a massive career
in the music industry...

50
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,354
...for a quiet life of devotion to God.

51
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,828
How do we get Mariah Carey to do that?

52
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,762
<i>Stuart, Paul Libbin on line 2...</i>

53
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,799
<i>...about the new Rolling Stones
jukebox musical?</i>

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,803
Tell him I'll return when I get
back to my office. Blech.

55
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:17,507
- What? My mother bought me this outfit.
- I didn't say anything.

56
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,709
Couldn't believe I'd miss
the Easter parade.

57
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:24,222
- I have a luncheon in Jersey today.
- New Jersey.

58
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,224
It's a fundraiser for the library.
My mom's on the board.

59
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:33,354
Wanna come? Please?
Lovely ladies who lunch.

60
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,330
Possibly some poached salmon.

61
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,799
I think I'll pass.

62
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,244
I guess we should get started.

63
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,545
I'd like to thank you all for coming today.

64
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,281
I hope everyone's enjoying the salmon.

65
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,014
Have a nice day.

66
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,058
- You're late.
- I'm not late.

67
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,560
Must you challenge
everything I say, darling?

68
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,790
I love that outfit on you.

69
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,264
- The shoes are another story.
- Uch.

70
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,097
As president
of the Friends of the Library...

71
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:18,107
...it is my great privilege to introduce
today's guest speaker, Julie Davidson.

72
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,884
So you couldn't take a whole day off
and spend a little time with your mother?

73
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,818
- You could have brought my Jake.
- He's in school, Ma.

74
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,017
Miss Davidson is an experienced
and award-winning reporter...

75
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,721
<i>...who writes the "Choices" column
for Metropolitan Magazine...</i>

76
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:43,164
...taking a fresh look
at modern life decisions twice a week.

77
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,032
- How's my beautiful boy?
- Oh, he's fine.

78
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,866
I'm taking his training wheels off...

79
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,498
I don't understand how you could leave
that child in school all day long...

80
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:56,114
...with that very young girl to raise him.
I could never do that, never.

81
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:00,184
- Although you know I had ambition too.
- Don't start with me, Mom.

82
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:04,983
She'll be reading excerpts
from her recently published debut book...

83
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,956
...a collection of pieces from her column.

84
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:11,255
I worked in your school,
I volunteered for the hospital.

85
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,696
But you two girls were always first.

86
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,200
And I was fulfilled.
Your father wouldn't have it any other way.

87
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,670
By the way, the girls in the book group
think you're a widow.

88
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,469
What? Mom, how could you?

89
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,814
I'd like to thank, ahem,
Sally and Muffy...

90
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,507
...for the beautiful centerpieces.

91
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,983
Didn't they do a nice job, everyone?

92
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:39,215
Well, some of these women are not
as open-minded as I am about your choice.

93
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,121
People talk, you know.

94
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,591
They would not understand...

95
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,220
...why my beautiful, successful daughter
is not married.

96
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,162
I have a boyfriend. Ted.

97
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,735
Huh. Boyfriend at best, not a husband.

98
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:56,204
Well, that's exactly how I like it.
I don't need a husband, I need a wife.

99
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,707
Julie Davidson.

100
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,658
Move.

101
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,724
Move.

102
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:27,168
- Hey, Jules. Ah!
- Francis.

103
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,436
- Great to see you.
- Yeah.

104
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,100
- Thanks for coming.
- Please, I wouldn't miss it.

105
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,441
- So how's Jake?
- Oh.

106
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,877
Oh, he is adorable.

107
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,214
Ah. Wow.

108
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,617
What?

109
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,486
Well, he doesn't look anything like you.

110
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,721
- Well, he's got my chin.
- Uh-huh.

111
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,264
You're really onto something, you know.

112
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,800
Donor insemination.
Who needs them, right?

113
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,531
Well, just for the record,
I did try to find Mr. Right.

114
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,273
You spent the last 20 years
hanging out of a helicopter.

115
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,877
Well, I meant on my days off.

116
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:09,837
I even tried that online dating thing.

117
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,780
But frankly, anyone who's our age
who's still available...

118
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,352
...there's a reason.
- But doesn't it kill you?

119
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:20,584
Not knowing who the father is?
I mean, these kids ain't no blank slates.

120
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:25,154
Well, I know what I need to know.
He's my son and I love him.

121
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,667
- What's that?
- That's me and Daddy playing baseball.

122
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,898
- That's stupid.
- You're stupid.

123
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,304
Mommy says you don't got a daddy.

124
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,404
- I do got a daddy.
- Do not.

125
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,141
My daddy's taking me to the Yankees again.
He knows Matsui.

126
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,841
So?

127
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,452
My daddy plays for the Yankees.

128
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,052
- Does not.
- Does so.

129
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,124
No way, because you stink at baseball.
You're a liar.

130
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,490
No, you're a liar
and my daddy is a Yankee.

131
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,925
Prove it.

132
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,060
Ow!

133
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,533
- Linda, it's been a while.
- Hi.

134
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,436
Well, I just wanted to say
how inspired I have been by your work.

135
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,238
Some of the people you write about,
they really makes me wanna change my life.

136
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,973
- Wow. And how's that coming?
- Well, what do you think?

137
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:19,645
Of?

138
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,719
Ah.

139
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,718
- That's quite a start.
- Yes.

140
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,914
Well, they were
my 40th birthday present.

141
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,684
Now, I could've gotten the new Z3.

142
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,318
But these get better mileage,
if you know what I mean.

143
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,463
Hold on, sorry.

144
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,502
Hello.

145
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, uh...

146
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,401
Oh, no.

147
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:47,311
Oh, uh, I'll be there immediately.

148
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,008
No, it's okay. If there's
something wrong, I wanna get right on it.

149
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,049
Okay, thank you.

150
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,120
Uh, I'm sorry, ladies.
Something came up, I have to leave.

151
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,053
Just leave your books with your names.

152
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:02,694
I promise I will sign
each and every one of them.

153
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:06,392
Where are you rushing off to?
You know my friend Joan.

154
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,365
- I'm so sorry to hear about his father.
- Excuse me?

155
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:14,302
Well, your mother told me.
Tragic, on your honeymoon.

156
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,239
- I've gotta go, Ma.
- Give her Artie's number.

157
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:22,142
Mom, I'm happy the way things are,
plus I have a boyfriend.

158
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:27,377
Get your priorities in order.
A child needs a father.

159
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,558
I got here as soon as I could.
What happened?

160
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,856
Sit down, please, Miss Davidson. Relax.

161
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,740
- Well?
- Jake started a fight.

162
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,276
- With who?
- With Horatio.

163
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,541
- Is he okay?
- Jake's fine.

164
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,479
Horatio's a little bruised.

165
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:03,987
Naturally, his parents have been notified.
Luckily for you, they're very understanding.

166
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:07,421
- Especially given the situation.
- What situation?

167
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,528
- This isn't the first time.
- Well, with Horatio picking on him...

168
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,357
He started it.

169
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,228
He told Horatio that his father
was one of the New York Yankees.

170
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,731
- Oh?
- During the winter, it was the Knicks.

171
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:23,605
- Why is this the first I've heard of this?
- Do you have a neurologist?

172
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,271
What? Wh...?

173
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,173
Of course not. Why would I?

174
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,974
These types of learning disabilities
run in the family.

175
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,544
Oh, come on.

176
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,914
One in three families
has a learning-disabled child.

177
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:40,255
He's an active 6-year-old.
Come on, none of them can sit still.

178
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,986
- Boys will be boys, right?
- Wrong.

179
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,393
It's worth looking into now,
before it's too late.

180
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,362
Medication can do wonders.

181
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,698
Okay, no. My son is not doing medication.
I need to see him now.

182
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,567
Well, whatever you decide...

183
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,039
...please know that violent outbursts
won't be tolerated here.

184
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,041
Next time, we will send him home.

185
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,146
And three strikes...

186
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,855
I don't believe this. How dare she?

187
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:15,824
As if I don't have enough on my mind.
I hate this outfit.

188
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,021
This color is making me nauseous.

189
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,291
Miss Missy.
What does she know anyway, right?

190
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,801
Wait till she has kids. She'll see. Punks.

191
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,872
I'm telling you,
it's that Horatio kid.

192
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:33,402
They say it's supposedly
one of the top schools in the city. Pah.

193
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,680
- I'm writing to the director. Medication?
- Julie.

194
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,673
Calm down, sit.

195
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,147
Sit.

196
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,525
Every parent gets called in.
It's a rite of passage.

197
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:52,391
Do you think it's too early to drink?
I mean, who'd do that for a living anyway?

198
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,860
Could you imagine cold season?

199
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,562
A roomful of toddlers mewling
and puking in the nurses' arms.

200
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,501
They say it can run in the family.

201
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,872
- They? Who? What can run in the family?
- The experts.

202
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:09,481
Everybody in my family
is above average IQ.

203
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:13,778
Top of their class. Learning-disabled?

204
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,820
Stuart, could a person
with a learning disability...

205
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:21,255
...get a 1560 on their SATs,
go to a top law school?

206
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,256
Is this a trick question?

207
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:28,361
- It's him.
- Who?

208
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,195
That donor.

209
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,238
I picked good genes.
I picked Ivy League genes, or so I thought.

210
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,899
Jules, you didn't really believe
the B.S. He put in that profile, did you?

211
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,239
Well, yes, it was verified.

212
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:45,179
It was a very reputable clinic, Stuart.
I did my homework. I checked it out.

213
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,616
I'm sure you did.
You're just more trusting than I am.

214
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,414
That's why you sleep at night.

215
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:55,785
What if he's a drug addict?
Or an alcoholic?

216
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,990
Or an actor?

217
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:01,962
Stuart.

218
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,195
Or a drama critic?

219
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,834
"Williams College,
graduated with honors.

220
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:12,671
Wants to be a civil lawyer
to protect the under-served.

221
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:16,406
Dad's a corporate lawyer,
loves reading and sports.

222
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,814
Donating sperm to share the gift of life."

223
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,389
That's too good to be true.

224
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,108
Larry, it's Julie Davidson.

225
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,870
I need you
to track down someone for me.

226
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:51,039
It's, uh, personal and strictly confidential.

227
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:55,083
"'Someday,' he says to me,
'maybe you'll headline in Harlem.'

228
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,712
I squint like I can read the letters
up on the Savoy marquee.

229
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:03,988
Instead of 'Musclehead,'
they spell out 'Happy Feet.'"

230
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:08,166
What happened in school today?

231
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,859
I want you to read me
another book, Mommy.

232
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:14,403
Ohh. I can't. Mommy's really tired.

233
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,337
So? I'm not.

234
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,416
Miss Missy said
you and Horatio got in a fight.

235
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:31,078
- He started it.
- Well, what did he do?

236
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,884
He said my picture was stupid.

237
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,994
That's a mean thing for him to say,
but no reason to hit him.

238
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,096
You gotta use your words.

239
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:43,166
I did, I swear. I said he was stupid.

240
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,431
And then I counted to 10.
And then I hit him.

241
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,940
Well, next time, you walk away, okay?

242
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,313
Now, did you tell him
your dad was a Yankee?

243
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,278
Yeah. So?

244
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:01,385
- So? That's not the truth.
- Prove it.

245
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:04,148
Time to go to bed.

246
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,689
You're mean.

247
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,090
Yeah, Mom's so mean.

248
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,866
Why can't my daddy bring me
to the Yankees like Horatio's?

249
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,803
Well, you know our family
doesn't have a daddy, you know that.

250
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,377
- You and I go to the Yankee games.
- It's not fair. I want a daddy.

251
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,309
Well, I wish
I could've given you a daddy...

252
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,711
...but there were no daddies available.

253
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,150
And Mommy wanted you so badly
I told the doctors I needed you right away.

254
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,882
Because you're the most important thing
that ever happened to me.

255
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,999
<i>Julie, the guy you're looking for
is Paul Cooper.</i>

256
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:55,471
<i>Last known address: 35 Butler Road,
Scarsdale, New York, 10583.</i>

257
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,633
<i>But you didn't hear it from me.
I wanna keep my license.</i>

258
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,076
<i>Good luck, sweetheart. Larry Matthews.</i>

259
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,124
Paul?

260
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,865
Um, Dad?

261
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,567
- Can I help you?
- Um...

262
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,507
I sure hope so.
I'm trying to track down Paul.

263
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,671
- Paul Cooper?
- Are you with the police?

264
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,909
Oh, no, no. Of course not.

265
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,383
I'm Julie Davidson.

266
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,784
<i>With Metropolitan.</i>

267
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,258
The number-one news and lifestyle
magazine on the East Coast?

268
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,662
A little too liberal for my taste.

269
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,201
But, uh, come in.

270
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,036
So, um, what do you want with Paul?

271
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,373
Research for a story I'm writing
about lawyers.

272
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,947
Then I'm the one you should speak to.

273
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,913
Charles Cooper.

274
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm sure you've heard of me.

275
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,148
No, it's Paul.

276
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,553
Then you're a lousy reporter.

277
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,028
Or you're a cop. And I'm thinking cop.

278
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,463
Because you look like a detective.
Thank you.

279
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,829
I'm not a cop.

280
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,295
Then what I don't get is...

281
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,341
...why would you wanna do a story
on a lousy loser?

282
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,473
A bum.

283
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,046
A dropout.

284
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,244
I write about choices.

285
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,579
Even stupid ones?

286
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:53,918
Look, you're not to use my name in this.
I don't want any further embarrassment.

287
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,491
Do you understand me?

288
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,228
You've got nothing to worry about.

289
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:04,529
We haven't really heard from him in a while.
He sort of moves around a lot.

290
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,570
He's a freeloader. That's what he is.

291
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,735
His cell phone got disconnected.

292
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,579
I didn't pay the bill.

293
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,745
I see.

294
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,383
Excuse me.

295
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,758
Do you really wanna talk to Paul?

296
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,661
I don't even know anymore.

297
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:37,200
Listen, it's not easy being the son
of the mighty Chuck Cooper.

298
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,030
I should know.

299
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,305
He's living in Jersey City now.
Here's his address.

300
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,045
Hey. Hi.

301
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,456
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

302
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,823
Not unless you're Paul Cooper. Are you?

303
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:05,658
Who wants to know?

304
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,294
<i>I'm with Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

305
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:12,861
Look, I was gonna head across the street
to get a drink.

306
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:17,141
- Join me?
- Sure.

307
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:25,039
- What did you say your name was?
- Julie.

308
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,111
Shoot.

309
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,517
Oh.

310
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,990
Can I buy you a drink, Julie?

311
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,924
Sure.

312
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,326
I'll have a glass of white wine, please.

313
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,626
And I'll have a Scotch.

314
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,931
So how can I help you, pretty lady?

315
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,430
Um, I'm a reporter.

316
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,805
- For real?
- Yeah.

317
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:54,543
And I'd like to ask you some questions.

318
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,675
Who's your friend?

319
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,613
This is, uh, the very pretty...

320
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,284
Julie.

321
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,191
She's trying to pick me up.

322
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,261
Well, you are indeed the man,
Johnny Mac.

323
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,590
Wait, wait.
Aren't you Paul? Paul Cooper?

324
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,326
Not in this lifetime.

325
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:23,834
I can be whoever you want me to be,
sweetheart.

326
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,771
- You're looking for Paul Cooper?
- Yeah.

327
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,215
That's him right there.

328
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,195
Mind if I join you?

329
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:57,403
I'm Julie.

330
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:01,073
And you are?

331
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,541
A total loser.

332
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:06,782
Okay, but what does
your mother call you?

333
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,710
I'm quoting my mother.

334
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,486
I'm sorry.

335
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,219
Paul.

336
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,358
Paul Cooper.

337
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,866
Are you some sort of angel or something?

338
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,793
Hardly.

339
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,375
Yeah, my father's a bigtime
corporate lawyer.

340
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,842
- Really?
- Yeah.

341
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,504
For the weak and oppressed.

342
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:41,311
Plea bargains, golden parachutes,
billion-dollar bailouts.

343
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,181
Swell, huh?

344
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:47,485
So naturally, I went to law school, Yale.
Right out of college.

345
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:50,253
While my friends spent a summer
kicking around Europe...

346
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,896
...I took the LSATs.

347
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,123
Rocked them, too,
but my dad, he wrote the application.

348
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,396
I think he wrote it when I was
in eighth grade. Can you believe it?

349
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:03,530
I mean, he couldn't help himself,
and I was a freaking English Lit major.

350
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,710
- Wow.
- Yeah, it was his alma mater, you see?

351
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:09,870
So being second generation?
A huge deal to him.

352
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,515
Massive.

353
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:12,980
Right.

354
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,551
But I hated it.

355
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,188
I mean, law school, that scene?

356
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:23,020
It wasn't me, it was him.
And I didn't wanna be him, I hated him.

357
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,291
Sometimes I used to wish I was one
of those inner-city kids with no dad.

358
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,866
That's messed up.

359
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,166
I know. I was pretty angry back then.

360
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,873
Back then when?

361
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,603
When you were like, um, 6?

362
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,304
Six, no. Like high school.

363
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,642
What were you like
when you were 6?

364
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,379
- You serious? Six?
- Yeah.

365
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:53,982
Well, I think the formative years
say a lot about who we are now.

366
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,627
I mean, like me, I was a teacher's pet.

367
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,820
Okay.

368
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,466
Six.

369
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,128
- Did you like baseball?
- Yeah, I like sports.

370
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:09,072
- Were you a good eater?
- What?

371
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,133
Uh, sorry. Um...

372
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,002
Uh, did you get in trouble in school?

373
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:19,041
Okay, what is this?
An interview or something?

374
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:23,847
No, no, no. I just think you're fascinating.

375
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,554
- You do?
- Yeah, sure, why not? So 6.

376
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,930
I used to get in trouble.
I mean, nothing bad, really.

377
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,033
I just gave the teacher a hard time,
kind of a wiseass.

378
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,726
Too smart for my own good.

379
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,737
- That sounds about right.
- Huh?

380
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:46,276
Oh, no. Nothing, nothing.
I have a 6-year-old.

381
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,072
You like kids? You have any?

382
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,545
No, I ain't that kind of guy.

383
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,981
Well, actually...

384
00:25:56,154 --> 00:26:00,591
...now, I'm only telling you this
because I'm drunk and I don't know you...

385
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,556
...but I did donate sperm once.

386
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,895
- Ohh.
- Look, don't get all judgmental or anything.

387
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:11,028
I got recruited by a sperm clinic.
At Yale.

388
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:15,070
They were short on Ivy Leaguers,
so the brothers weren't stepping up.

389
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,367
Signed a few forms, took a blood test...

390
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,136
...they gave me a dirty magazine
and some fast money.

391
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,475
They wanted more,
but it weirded me out.

392
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:32,749
- So you couldn't cut it in law school?
- I could cut it, I didn't want to.

393
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,716
What about the notion
of helping people...

394
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,125
...and maybe protecting
the under-served?

395
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,260
Yeah.

396
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,927
Sure, but law school
isn't about helping people.

397
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,167
So then what?

398
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,138
I transferred to business school.
Another bad idea.

399
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,641
So I tried vet school.

400
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,871
I like animals.

401
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,244
See, I just hadn't found it yet.

402
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:01,942
- Found what?
- Flow.

403
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,146
- You ever hear of Csikszentmihalyi?
- The psychologist?

404
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:09,225
Yes, exactly.
I was a psych minor, philosophy too.

405
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:13,831
Anyway, I'm sitting in the middle
of Wildlife Epidemiology when it hits me.

406
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,229
- What?
- How to achieve it, flow.

407
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,129
Acting.

408
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,399
Are you for real, or just another way
to piss off the old man?

409
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,306
No, seriously.
I mean, that was a nice perk.

410
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,607
One year,
I did summer stock in Williamstown.

411
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,512
I loved it. It's the only time
I've ever really been happy.

412
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,947
Felt part of something.

413
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,580
It was like the only way I could feel good
about me was to be someone else.

414
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,352
I understand that. I love the theater.

415
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:45,428
My best friend's a critic.
We go all the time.

416
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:50,225
- So, what's your problem?
- The problem is it ain't happening.

417
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,235
I mean, I finally figured it out
and I'm failing, miserably.

418
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:56,397
I got cattle calls, bad auditions,
no auditions.

419
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,769
I mean, I knew it wouldn't be easy,
but I've been doing it for six months.

420
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:02,970
Six months of classes, workshops,
and nothing.

421
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:06,015
Not one acting gig.
I can't even get a student film.

422
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:09,585
- Six months? That's it?
- Yeah, but I can see the writing on the wall.

423
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,315
My girlfriend dumped me because she
doesn't wanna be with a struggling actor.

424
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,291
Not that I blame her. I no longer have
anything in common with my lawyer friends.

425
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,823
And every actor I meet, they're all...

426
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,424
Well, you know.

427
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,090
I'm getting old.

428
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,601
No, seriously, I mean, look at me.
What am I doing?

429
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:30,332
Here I am with all these advanced degrees
and I'm washing dishes to pay rent.

430
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,805
Barely.

431
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,536
Maybe I should just go back, be a lawyer.

432
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,211
Uch. Blah, blah, blah.

433
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,282
I've heard enough.

434
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:42,043
Get over it.

435
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,745
Be the hero in your own life.

436
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,585
Heroes don't seek approval.
Especially from their dads.

437
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,855
- It just gets really hard.
- Lf it wasn't hard, they wouldn't call it work.

438
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,260
- Lf it was easy...
- Everybody would be doing it.

439
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,890
And if you're so old, why don't you grow up
and take some responsibility?

440
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,331
Jeez, where do you get off?

441
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,276
You're right, I don't.

442
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:12,977
Well, wait. I'm sorry.
I just had a really bad day.

443
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,950
It's my birthday.
I had this suck audition.

444
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,122
I'm all alone.

445
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,357
- Happy birthday.
- Please, stay a little longer.

446
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,259
Sorry.

447
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,735
Hey, sport.

448
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:43,011
Hey, so glad you're back.
How was Sri Lanka?

449
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,173
Missed you, as always.

450
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,080
Hey, sport.

451
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,955
- Well, say hi to Ted.
- Hi.

452
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,688
Yeah, hey, look what I got
for the big baseball fan.

453
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,658
- The Yankees.
- That's right.

454
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,698
- Official Yankees merchandise, my friend.
- No way.

455
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,394
How about your first real ball,
bat and mitt, huh?

456
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:08,500
It's a catcher's mitt.

457
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,369
Yeah, I know.
It was the most expensive one.

458
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,272
How's the bat?

459
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,580
It's a little big for him.

460
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,784
- Cool jacket.
- Hey, great. How about a game?

461
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,511
A little, uh...

462
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,914
Yeah.

463
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,457
Uh-huh. This is a nice spot. Huh? Huh?

464
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:36,090
- I'll set up first base.
- Yeah.

465
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,799
I told you.

466
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,800
No.

467
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,338
I mean, uh...

468
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:47,969
Let's use something else. Hey.

469
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:50,171
Take my jacket.

470
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,181
Not Uncle Ted's
incredibly expensive camera bag.

471
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,818
Cute.

472
00:30:56,888 --> 00:31:01,416
Here we go.
Uncle Ted bringing the heat and...

473
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,024
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

474
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,321
Nice. Nice. Nice for me.

475
00:31:05,496 --> 00:31:09,455
Bring it on, okay? Ready?
Underhand this time? Okay, here we go.

476
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,396
Oh-ho! In your face.
In your face, brother.

477
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,706
Maybe you should move in a little.

478
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:25,775
- Jake, keep your eyes on the ball.
- Just give me a good pitch.

479
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,483
Oh.

480
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:36,888
Ooh! My camera. My God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

481
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:53,299
- Got another ball?
- Uh, no.

482
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:55,776
It was just the one.

483
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,881
It was signed.

484
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,619
- Well, here we are.
- Ohh.

485
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:06,985
Hey, you'd think six weeks in the jungle
would toughen you up for days like this.

486
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,888
- Sorry, babe.
- Well, no problem.

487
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:15,226
You were great with Jake.
I think he's really starting to...

488
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,769
You wanna come up? Spend the night?

489
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,830
Yeah? Sleep over?

490
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,099
Mm-hm.

491
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:27,401
Uh... Yeah.

492
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,987
Thanks again for today.

493
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,614
Well, I thought it would be good
to do something together.

494
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,658
The three of us.

495
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,659
It's good to feel part of a family
for a change.

496
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,197
Yeah, it was.

497
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,433
I, um, got this message
while I was away.

498
00:32:56,607 --> 00:33:01,442
Old friend of mine,
well, a colleague, died.

499
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,170
He was a war photographer.

500
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,507
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Where was he? Baghdad?

501
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,681
Phoenix. Home alone.

502
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:13,688
If he wasn't late on his alimony payments,
they never would've discovered his body.

503
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,554
He was dead two days
when he was subpoenaed.

504
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,925
- Jules.
- Yeah?

505
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,065
Let's get married.

506
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,599
Ted.

507
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,372
I don't wanna die alone.

508
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,536
Well, hey, who does?

509
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:42,184
- Wait, are you serious?
- Absolutely.

510
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,584
I know it's good for you and the kid.

511
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:48,191
Well, yeah, but you're on the road
all the time.

512
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:53,723
It's quality that matters,
not quantity, right?

513
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,493
Ted, I don't know.

514
00:33:56,667 --> 00:33:59,363
I know I'm not conventional
husband material...

515
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,129
...but that's a good thing.

516
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,330
And we have so much fun together.

517
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:08,377
And I like knowing you're here
when I come home.

518
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,309
Stability.

519
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:14,350
I don't wanna just be
your boyfriend anymore.

520
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,453
I wanna be part of your family.

521
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:20,086
I don't know, Ted. Marriage?

522
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,226
I won't even make you
change your name.

523
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,093
Yeah.

524
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:35,867
So, what happened next?

525
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:42,974
And so it occurred to me that the only
fair solution was to burn it all. Everything.

526
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:48,318
I started with the books,
but the curtains caught fire.

527
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,517
And the flames spread
through the entire house.

528
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,520
<i>I'm really sorry, Julie...</i>

529
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:56,216
<i>...but there's a Jenna's mom
on line 2 for you, really insistent.</i>

530
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,191
<i>Something about taking the kids
to the museum?</i>

531
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,957
Tell her it's fine but he has to take a nap.
Absolutely takes a nap.

532
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,864
<i>- Tell her I'll call her later.
- Your mother's on 1.</i>

533
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,670
Mom, I'm on deadline. Gotta go.

534
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:16,179
Uh, I'm sorry.

535
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:21,546
<i>There's a Miss Missy on line 2.
Also, your 11:00 is running late.</i>

536
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,986
Julie Davidson.

537
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:32,154
Oh, no. What happened now?

538
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,991
Ohh.

539
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:38,158
But this is only strike two, right?

540
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,668
Yes, I'll have the nanny
head over right now.

541
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,636
- Jake, stop.
- No.

542
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,803
- Jake, stop.
- No.

543
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,540
Give me the keys,
time to go home.

544
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,049
I don't wanna.
I wanna go back to the park.

545
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:59,485
- Your mom is gonna give you a big time-out.
- Wow, what's the problem?

546
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,119
- Jake, now.
- Whoa, man.

547
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,660
- Who are you? I don't talk to strangers.
- I'm not a stranger.

548
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,821
I'm the Southside Samurai.

549
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,734
- Here.
- Thanks.

550
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:18,709
- You're funny.
- No, man, I'm Paul.

551
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:20,605
- Hey, is this your building?
- Yeah.

552
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:24,179
Do you mind if leave something inside
for Julie Davidson?

553
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,714
- That's Mommy.
- No way.

554
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:29,352
- Uh-huh. I swear.
- How do you know Julie?

555
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,222
- She saved my life one night.
- Wow.

556
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:35,120
Now you can officially tell her
I'm an actor.

557
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,557
Really? Have you been in anything
I would know?

558
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,864
<i>Not unless you saw
the Williamstown production of Medea.</i>

559
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:45,128
I love Euripides. He's so intensely tragic.

560
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:48,204
I go to NYU. I'm a philosophy major.

561
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:52,739
Well, this is my first official,
barely-paying part in a play.

562
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,141
- On Broadway?
- No, on Kennedy.

563
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,411
In Weehawken.

564
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,749
- Do you like Yu-Gi-Oh?
- Yeah, man. I got all their CDs.

565
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,354
- Hey, do you like Nintendo DS?
- Uh-huh.

566
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,889
Ohh. Check this out.

567
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:10,555
All right?

568
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,926
Would you mind
giving this to Julie for me?

569
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:17,897
You might as well give it to her yourself.
Here she is.

570
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,704
- Oh!
- You...

571
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:24,974
- Uh, you.
- I guess that means you remember me.

572
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:26,439
I have that effect on women.

573
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:31,005
- Paul, I got you to the next level.
- Oh, cool, man, let me see.

574
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:33,650
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

575
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,686
So, uh, I got a part.

576
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:40,186
Oh.

577
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:44,124
<i>- The Importance of Being Earnest.
- Great. Congratulations.</i>

578
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,593
I told you not to give up.

579
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,699
- How'd you find me?
- This guy at that bar, he gave me your card.

580
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:54,861
And then the ladies at the office said
I'd just missed you, so I figured I'd come...

581
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,167
Anyway...

582
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,139
I don't know, I just thought
we kind of connected that night.

583
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,610
And I was hoping you'd come see it.

584
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:06,342
- The play.
- Me?

585
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,476
Or your critic friend.

586
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,815
- Ah. Yeah.
- Can I come see Paul in the play?

587
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,749
We'll try. I'll try.

588
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:18,986
Wait. Mommy, I wanna show Paul
my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

589
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:21,188
Mommy wants to spend
some time with you.

590
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:24,799
- I wanna show Paul my Yu-Gi-Oh.
- Listen to your mother, Jake.

591
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,699
- You know, I should go.
- No.

592
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,831
- Please, Mommy.
- Hey, I've got a great idea.

593
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:35,467
Paul, come over tomorrow when
I babysit and we'll get you a new pack.

594
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,307
- Really?
- Is that all right?

595
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,075
He usually goes to sleep
within the first hour. You free?

596
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,542
Sure. I mean, if that's okay with you.

597
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,314
You don't mind, Julie.
I've brought friends before.

598
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,788
An Elemental Energy Booster Pack.

599
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:53,555
Come on, Mommy, I'm starving.
I want mac and cheese.

600
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,790
Time for a coffee?

601
00:38:55,966 --> 00:38:57,524
Yeah.

602
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:03,731
Awesome.
We'll go right around the corner.

603
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,241
Montreal and Toronto?

604
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,746
Well, if you think it's worth it, it's fine.

605
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:15,147
Okay, bye.

606
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,589
I suppose I should be honored
that you didn't cancel.

607
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:24,250
Well, I should have. I leave in less
than two weeks for a 10-day book tour.

608
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,591
I'm completely overwhelmed.
What's so important?

609
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:30,632
Lunch. With your mother.

610
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,326
And you'll never catch a man
dressed like that.

611
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,029
- Four, please.
- Four?

612
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,109
- Never mind, I see them.
- Them? Who's them?

613
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,909
You remember Joan?
And this is her son Artie.

614
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,482
- You remember me telling you about Artie?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

615
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,351
Artie has just returned to New York City
to be closer to his mother.

616
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,587
Artie's a CPA for the Heart Society.

617
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,422
And this is my oldest daughter, Julie.

618
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:02,094
<i>Julie, who works
for the Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

619
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,632
I'm quite sure
you are familiar with her work.

620
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:08,033
- I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

621
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,799
Mom, I'm on deadline.
I don't have time for...

622
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,273
Food and family? Sit.

623
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:18,075
Artie just ran the Boston Marathon.

624
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,809
- You did?
- It was his 20th marathon.

625
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,612
- Eighteenth, actually.
- Tell Julie your time.

626
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,951
- He got an award, a medal.
- Everyone got a medal, Mom.

627
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,490
My Artie is very modest.

628
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,390
Please, tell her the time.

629
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,066
- 3:32.07.
- Wow. You are modest.

630
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:39,760
Julie ran one of those marathons
in Central Park.

631
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,236
The Susan G. Komen, only a 5k.
Where's the waiter?

632
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,865
You know, Julie, Artie just moved back
to New York after living in Chicago.

633
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:50,304
He was with one of those
Big Three accounting firms.

634
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,846
It's "Big Four," Mom.

635
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:55,850
And I hear you're quite the uncle.
Takes the nephews to football games.

636
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,113
Basketball, actually.

637
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,519
Knicks fan.
That's really why I left Chicago.

638
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:06,295
Can somebody flag down a waiter?
I need to lose 93 words by 3:00.

639
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,059
Did I tell you Julie has a little boy?
No father.

640
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,727
- I've gotta go.
- Julie.

641
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,567
It's nothing personal.
I usually don't do lunch, I have a deadline.

642
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:21,006
- I understand completely.
- I'm sure you're a really nice guy.

643
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,739
My mother tends to forget
I already have a boyfriend.

644
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,315
In fact, he may just be a fiance.

645
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,882
- You're gonna get married?
- Um...

646
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,151
Not exactly.

647
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:40,730
This is how you tell me? Julie.
Did you hear that?

648
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,196
My daughter's getting married.

649
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,801
Ooh!

650
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,580
- Nice look.
- Got the cards?

651
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:06,818
Bam.

652
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,653
- You again?
- Hey.

653
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,796
- You like the Yankees?
- Absolutely, man.

654
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:17,127
We're not gonna be watching
boring baseball all night, are we?

655
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:22,196
Ohh.

656
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,009
I won't be late.

657
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,547
What's up?
What do you wanna do first?

658
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,120
I've been thinking about
this nature-versus-nurture thing...

659
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,689
...and there's no consensus.

660
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,986
Whether it's environmental
or parental or genetic.

661
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,153
So there's a new study that said
that siblings might determine...

662
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,629
- Jules, Jules, Jules.
- Yeah, what?

663
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,204
- Shh. That's enough about work.
- Well, it's not really about... No.

664
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,102
I don't know. I've got a lot on my mind.

665
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,675
I loved writing the book.

666
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,075
- But the book tour, it's...
- Well...

667
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,546
It's a necessary evil.
Gotta promote the book, right?

668
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,946
Yeah.

669
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,746
But...

670
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,815
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to anymore.

671
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,653
Work, I mean.

672
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:21,161
If we got married,
you could go freelance, like me.

673
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:22,731
Or stop.

674
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:26,131
Maybe we could both stop, you know,
take a hiatus.

675
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,736
Maybe write a book together.

676
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,897
You, the words. Me, the pictures.
What a team.

677
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,370
I don't know. I need the benefits.

678
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:39,238
- Could you really do that?
- Absolutely.

679
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,681
And stop being so practical.
I've seen the world.

680
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,879
I'm ready for a new
and exciting adventure.

681
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,489
Family.

682
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,059
You two could move in here.
Or we could move to the country.

683
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,686
Or some other country. New Zealand.

684
00:43:58,402 --> 00:43:59,926
And ta-da.

685
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,270
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

686
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:10,202
Yeah, well, it's not traditional,
but then again neither are you.

687
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:20,013
- Julie.
- Oh, Ted.

688
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:23,250
- Will you marry me?
- Oh, Ted. Stop it.

689
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,089
What? I'm totally serious.

690
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,323
This isn't you. This isn't us, is it?

691
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,764
It can be. Come on, why not?

692
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,695
You mean you'd change your whole life
in a heartbeat, just like that?

693
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,678
Yeah. I'm ready.

694
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,746
I'm, uh, really ready.

695
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,185
I'm...

696
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,690
Look, take the ring out for a test-drive.

697
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,729
Wear it around, see how it handles.
Think about it.

698
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:05,858
I've got a flight, 6 a.m. Tomorrow.
I'll be back Monday night.

699
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:09,995
So you have until then.

700
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,737
Hey.

701
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,007
- What time is it?
- Where's Kiki?

702
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:57,882
She had to leave. Her roommate
was freaking out about something.

703
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,390
- How much do I owe you?
- Nothing. Just come to my show.

704
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,864
I don't mind paying, really.

705
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:19,606
- Do you mind if I crash here tonight?
- Yes.

706
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,075
Well, the PATH trains aren't running.

707
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,379
Take a cab. I'll give you the money.

708
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:34,354
It's really late and my roommate hates when
I wake him. I'll leave first thing. Promise.

709
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,221
Okay, you can stay.

710
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,544
How's that coming, anyway?

711
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:58,909
Okay. I'm kind of stuck
in a couple of places.

712
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,379
What's the problem?

713
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,076
I'm having trouble
with the balance, you know.

714
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:06,689
How sincere, insincere,
confident, nervous.

715
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:09,052
I love Wilde.

716
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,660
You wanna run some lines?

717
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,161
You don't mind?

718
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,960
I'm not tired.

719
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:22,595
Gotta warn you, though,
I haven't done a play reading in a long time.

720
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,208
Okay. I'm Jack Worthing.
You'll be Gwendolyn?

721
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,740
I'd probably make a better Lady Bracknell
at this point, but it's your show.

722
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:33,746
Okay.

723
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,949
Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.

724
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,951
Pray, don't talk to me
about the weather.

725
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:44,093
When people talk to me
about the weather...

726
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,525
...I feel certain
that they mean something else.

727
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,631
And that makes me so nervous.

728
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,630
Well, I do mean something else.

729
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:54,964
I thought so.
In fact, I am never wrong.

730
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,066
And I'd like to be allowed
to take advantage...

731
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:03,703
...of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence.

732
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:08,784
Yeah, slow down, buddy. I think
Worthing would be a little more subtle.

733
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,821
I would certainly advise you to do so.

734
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,959
Okay.

735
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:21,291
Miss Fairfax, ever since I've met you...

736
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,629
...I've admired you more than any girl
I've ever met since I met you.

737
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,628
Better.

738
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,397
Yes, I am quite aware of the fact.

739
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,907
And I often wish that in public
you had been more demonstrative.

740
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:38,411
For me, you have always had
an irresistible fascination.

741
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:42,917
Even before I met you,
I was far from indifferent to you.

742
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:47,489
We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing,
in an age of ideals.

743
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:53,290
And my ideal has always been
to love someone of the name of Ernest.

744
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,800
I'm sorry.

745
00:48:57,968 --> 00:49:01,426
There is something in that name
that inspires absolute confidence.

746
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,873
The moment Algernon first mentioned to me
that he had a friend called Ernest...

747
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,774
...I knew I was destined to love you.

748
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,807
- You really love me, Gwendolyn?
- Passionately.

749
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,452
Darling, you don't know
how happy you've made me.

750
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:23,325
Oh, shit.

751
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,553
Uh, I'm sorry. I...

752
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,862
Just acting.

753
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,799
No big deal.

754
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,343
Good night.

755
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:06,260
- Wanna watch Barney with me?
- Oh, man, Barney sucks.

756
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,234
- Mommy, Paul said a bad word!
- Shh!

757
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,940
Telling is bad. Shh.

758
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,836
<i>- Hello.
- Hi, it's Stuart.</i>

759
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,708
Come on up.

760
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,906
Where's your DS?

761
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:22,844
- What's that?
- It's a tattoo.

762
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:25,914
I know that. I mean, what is it?

763
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:28,922
- Justice, dude.
- Wow, that's cool.

764
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:30,923
It means being fair.

765
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,722
I always wanted to make sure
I had the law on my side.

766
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:37,264
Mommy, look. I want one too.

767
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,369
Mm. Great. Time to go.

768
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,204
- Ohh...
- Don't ask.

769
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,709
Puppy.

770
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,007
Wanna come to my room?

771
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,241
And you are?

772
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:57,876
- This is Paul.
- I met Julie in a bar.

773
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:00,948
- He's Kiki's friend.
- Ah.

774
00:51:01,124 --> 00:51:04,616
- Hey, you're Stuart Blakerman.
- Guilty as charged.

775
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,387
- I'm an actor.
- Naturally.

776
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,225
Man, I really enjoy your work.
I read you religiously.

777
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,698
<i>What you wrote about Henry IV
at The Public, that was so...</i>

778
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:15,565
I'm so... Exactly!

779
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,333
Bravo. A brilliant performance
of an actor kissing butt.

780
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,738
You think so? I'm still trying to perfect it.

781
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,310
<i>- Doing anything?
- The Importance of Being Earnest.</i>

782
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,312
- Oh, where are you doing that?
- Jersey.

783
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:28,417
- Jersey.
- It opens next week.

784
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,884
- Producers hope to bring it to New York.
- Of course.

785
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:35,149
- Hey, would you come see it?
- Well, Paul's gotta go now.

786
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,623
Get me the information.
Maybe I'll send someone.

787
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,422
- Anything for a friend of Julie's.
- He's not a friend.

788
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,294
Well, thanks. Guess I better be going.

789
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:50,731
Thanks again for letting me stay last night
and helping me rehearse.

790
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:51,999
No problem.

791
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,038
Oh, my mom.

792
00:51:55,212 --> 00:51:56,873
- Ooh. Can I meet her?
- No.

793
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,878
- Come on.
- No.

794
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,210
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

795
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,843
"Thanks for letting me stay"?

796
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,853
Why do I have a trainer?
I could never have a body like that.

797
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:08,354
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Mom, come on up.</i>

798
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:12,859
I mean, that body is just genetics
or chemically enhanced.

799
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:14,894
Is Paul Spider-Man, Mommy?

800
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,397
No. Paul's not Spider-Man, honey.

801
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,798
Hmm.

802
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,542
- Do not see that show.
- Why not?

803
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:37,412
- Grandma's here.
- Oh, my favorite grandson.

804
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:40,488
I'm your only grandson.

805
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,148
Can I see the big whale first,
Grandma? Please?

806
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:46,818
Yes, but go get a sweater first.
It's always cold there.

807
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,124
- Hi, Mom.
- Mm-hm.

808
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,399
"The Epidemic of Permissive Parenting."

809
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,562
I just found it interesting, that's all.

810
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,732
- Hello, Mona.
- Hello, Stuart.

811
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,401
So, what do you think of the good news?

812
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,444
What news?

813
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:07,576
Oh, you got a new ring?

814
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,616
Getting married.

815
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,253
You?

816
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:12,854
No, silly. Julie.

817
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,723
Wow.

818
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,224
To Ted?

819
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,260
- Who else?
- It's not definite.

820
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,125
I'm at a loss for words.

821
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:24,290
What do you mean?
You are getting married.

822
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,958
- I'm getting a daddy?
- Ted?

823
00:53:27,137 --> 00:53:29,765
I don't know.
Jake, go get your sweatshirt, please.

824
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,373
- But...
- Now.

825
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,307
Mom, I wasn't planning
on telling him like this.

826
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:36,377
I thought he already knew.

827
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,480
What were you waiting for?
The honeymoon?

828
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,276
So is there a ring?

829
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,955
Oh, what a beautiful emerald?

830
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,684
That is a beautiful ring.
Didn't think he had it in him.

831
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,194
I don't know why you have to always make
these potentially pleasurable...

832
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,163
...mother-daughter moments
so confrontational.

833
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,932
Are your periods regular, darling?

834
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:02,696
- Mother.
- Uch.

835
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,568
I was so irritable
when I was perimenopausal.

836
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,074
I'm going to play more baseball games
with Ted?

837
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,177
- I don't know, sweetie.
- Because that last game really sucked.

838
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:14,579
- Jake.
- Where did you get that word?

839
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:16,848
- From Paul.
- Paul?

840
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:20,713
Does his mother know he speaks
that kind of language?

841
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,916
Wait until I tell Horatio
that I'm gonna get a daddy.

842
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,030
You got any more surprises for me,
Julie Davidson?

843
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,689
I don't think there's anything else.

844
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:42,267
Here they come now.
Oh, my God, Ted, they're beautiful.

845
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:47,542
Well, I'm not used to being spoiled
like this, really. It's too much.

846
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,519
More? Oh, gee.

847
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,149
Oh, wow.

848
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,731
Uh, never mind.

849
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,432
Ted, thanks so much.

850
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,196
Me too. I'll see you soon.

851
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:11,033
Bye.

852
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,834
Who died?

853
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,912
So my assistant is making reservations,
you going?

854
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,481
- Where?
- Weehawken, the new off-Broadway.

855
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,851
Are you? You hate Jersey.

856
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,250
It's Oscar Wilde. I can't resist.
Besides, it's the opening.

857
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,084
May be our only chance to see it.

858
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:29,748
It's beneath you.

859
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,830
<i>Did you see Puppetry of the Penis? I did.</i>

860
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,296
Come on. Why not?

861
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,059
Because...

862
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,169
- Because...
- I think I know.

863
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,396
And I think you wanna go.

864
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:49,905
And I think you are a naughty girl.

865
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,182
You can't hide behind that ring.

866
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:01,419
You're totally wrong. I love Ted.

867
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,357
And I think it's you
who's the naughty boy.

868
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,930
Touche.

869
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,429
Come on. It'll be fun.

870
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:15,128
Besides, with you getting married,
it may be our last hurrah in a theater.

871
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,274
See, I don't have a problem.

872
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:26,677
Go. Go!

873
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,452
Darling, you have no idea
how happy you've made me.

874
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,490
- My God, that was perfect.
- You think so?

875
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,787
- You're great.
- I'm worried about the accent.

876
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,794
Excuse me. Excuse me!

877
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,899
Your son just pushed my boy
down the slide.

878
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,431
- Did not.
- Did so.

879
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:51,472
- Your son's a bully. He should be on a leash.
- He's not our son. I'm just the nanny.

880
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:55,941
Whatever. Just keep better track of him.
My boy could have gotten very hurt.

881
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,143
Are you kidding me? Your boy is fine.

882
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:01,215
- Watch him.
- Watch him?

883
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,649
- You want me to watch him?
- Jake, let's go someplace else.

884
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,958
- Mothers. They can be so overprotective.
- She's totally doing her son a disservice.

885
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:12,959
- Paul.
- I thought you were gonna slug her.

886
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,597
- I'm on edge. I'm nervous about the play.
- Paul!

887
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,199
- You'll be great.
- I hope I don't forget my lines.

888
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,393
You'll be great.

889
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,632
- Jake?
- Oh, my God, where is he?

890
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:27,709
Jake?

891
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,511
- Jake!
- Here I am.

892
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:37,017
You don't ever do that again.
That's not cool. Do you hear me?

893
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,314
Hey, where are you going? Stop!

894
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:42,014
Leave me alone.

895
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:49,859
- Leave me alone. Unh!
- Oh, shoot.

896
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:54,094
- It's okay.
- Are you okay? Jake, Jake, you okay?

897
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,204
You all right? Oh!

898
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,773
It's okay. It's okay. Ew.

899
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,639
It's okay.

900
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,911
Everything all right? Are you all right?

901
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,948
Oh, my poor baby.

902
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:13,248
Everything's fine, Ms. Davidson.
He needed a few stitches.

903
00:58:13,423 --> 00:58:16,415
His tooth is loose, so you probably want
to get him to a dentist.

904
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,584
I'm gonna have a cool scar.

905
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,431
What happened?

906
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,492
I fell when Paul was chasing me.

907
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:30,332
- I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
- No, it was all my fault.

908
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,668
- Paul was chasing you?
- Paul did nothing wrong.

909
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,709
It was an accident. He tripped.
Jake was running really fast.

910
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,279
Oh, well,
you need to watch him better, huh?

911
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,507
Maybe not be so distracted.

912
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,844
What were the two of you thinking?

913
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,011
What was I thinking, trusting you?

914
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:50,918
Fine. This job is so not worth it.

915
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,627
And you?

916
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,800
Does the tooth fairy come
when it's just a little loose?

917
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,065
I guess we'll have to find out.

918
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,339
So I fired her. I mean, I had to.

919
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:16,542
It could have been a lot worse.

920
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,485
Only problem is, I don't have time to...

921
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,992
Is there a chance you could pick him up
after school tomorrow...

922
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,128
...and spend some time with him?

923
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:31,199
Yeah, I'd love to, but I got lunch
with my editor tomorrow...

924
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:33,562
...and Photoshop all afternoon...

925
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,169
...and then my flight.

926
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:37,806
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

927
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:42,874
My mom will do it, I'm sure.
She lives to be my savior.

928
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,674
Why don't you let me be your savior?

929
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:51,748
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.

930
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,020
What are you...?
How did you get up here?

931
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,687
- I'm sorry. Can I see him?
- You just can't come in.

932
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,426
- No. He's asleep.
- I'll be quiet. I promise.

933
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,369
- Who the hell was that?
- It's okay. Just give me a second.

934
01:00:22,485 --> 01:00:24,453
Who is this guy?

935
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:29,348
Oh. Uh, it's... That... That's Paul.

936
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,320
Um, Paul works with Kiki.

937
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:40,333
- They... With Jake and Kiki.
- Kiki.

938
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,477
Paul, this is Ted.

939
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,443
Ted, Paul.

940
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:57,745
- Hey.
- Hey.

941
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,125
Wow. Your work sounds incredible.

942
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:10,493
Yeah. It's always an adventure.

943
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,104
Tomorrow night, I'm heading off to China
to photograph the Great Wall.

944
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,165
So you've found it.

945
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,901
Well, it's pretty hard to miss.

946
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,603
They say you can see it from...

947
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:29,650
No. I meant flow. In your work.

948
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,912
Csikszentmihalyi.

949
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:36,620
Chick sent you where? I'm sorry?

950
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:46,257
She's great, isn't she?

951
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,368
Yeah.

952
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,871
Yeah, she is.

953
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,044
Oh, it's 2:00.

954
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,111
Damn.

955
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,382
Missed the last train.

956
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,623
So where you sleeping?

957
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,098
I'll tell you what.

958
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:19,828
You can crash at my place.

959
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:22,232
She gets up too early anyhow.

960
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,999
I'll show you my book on Marco Polo.

961
01:02:36,285 --> 01:02:37,718
Whoa!

962
01:02:40,523 --> 01:02:43,924
Mommy, the tooth fairy
brought me a Nintendo DS.

963
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:47,620
- What?
- I got a dollar and a DS.

964
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:49,554
Wow.

965
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:54,465
It's just like Paul's, Mommy.
Is Paul the tooth fairy?

966
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:58,434
Paul's not the tooth fairy.

967
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,702
Let's get ready to go to school.

968
01:03:05,081 --> 01:03:06,412
Whoa, whoa.

969
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:08,482
Grandma's gonna pick you up
tonight, okay?

970
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:10,551
- Okay, I love you, Mommy.
- I love you too.

971
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,745
Okay, bye.

972
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,291
Miss Fairfax, ever since I've met you...

973
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:23,990
...I've admired you more than any girl
I've ever met since I met you.

974
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:29,798
We live, as I hope you know, Mr. Worthing,
in an age of ideals.

975
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:35,808
And my ideal has always been
to love someone of the name Ernest.

976
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,243
There's something in that name
that inspires absolute confidence.

977
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:43,818
The moment Algernon mentioned to me
that he had a friend called Ernest...

978
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:47,586
...I knew I was destined to love you.

979
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:51,092
- Do you really love me, Gwendolyn?
- Passionately.

980
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,560
Oh, darling, you don't know
how happy you've made me.

981
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,199
- I heard there's a great place to...
- Yeah, I know.

982
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,069
That was so funny.

983
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,511
Yeah, he did good.

984
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,011
Hey! You made it.

985
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,880
- Oh, wow!
- Oh!

986
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:17,781
- You look great.
- Oh, thanks. I...

987
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,923
- Oh, I'm sorry. Okay.
- You were great.

988
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,718
- Really? You know, I felt great.
- You should.

989
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,659
It means so much to me you came.
I'm so happy.

990
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,456
Really. Very nice work.

991
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,093
- Oh.
- Ha-ha-ha.

992
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,032
Hey, come with me to the cast party.
Meet everybody.

993
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:38,605
- It's at a bar across the street.
- I don't know.

994
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:42,073
- Will there be warm beer and stale nuts?
- Stalest.

995
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:45,578
Julie, come on. How can you resist?

996
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,029
- Dance with me.
- Oh, God, no.

997
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:04,598
- Come on, it'll be a goof.
- Oh, come on. I feel old enough as it is.

998
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,394
I'll dance.

999
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,538
- No. That's okay.
- Come on.

1000
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,407
Go.

1001
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:49,867
- Thank you. I really gotta be going now.
- Please. Wait.

1002
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,651
One song, okay? Promise?

1003
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,311
One.

1004
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,951
- Oh, come on.
- Hey, you come on.

1005
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,427
What are we, in junior high school?

1006
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:14,297
And by the way, where were you
when I was in junior high? Pre-K?

1007
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,799
Aww.

1008
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,045
"I know you're lonely."

1009
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:29,412
<i>I know you're feeling lonely</i>

1010
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:31,951
You know, it doesn't bother me.

1011
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,851
- What?
- The age thing.

1012
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,990
Hey, one dance.

1013
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,095
You promised.

1014
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:52,838
So, um, Jake like my DS?

1015
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,603
Yeah, but he thinks
you're the tooth fairy now.

1016
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:03,083
- Mm.
- Hey, it's all right.

1017
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,311
Just relax a little bit.

1018
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:29,469
So, what's up with Jake's dad?

1019
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,643
He must have really hurt you.

1020
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,745
What? What?
Did I say something wrong?

1021
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:39,183
No. I just gotta go home.

1022
01:07:53,802 --> 01:07:58,171
- Morning. Want some coffee?
- I can't keep this up.

1023
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,865
Maybe some coffee will help.

1024
01:08:01,042 --> 01:08:06,344
Jake, darling, will you leave Mommy
and me for a moment, please?

1025
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:12,875
I love Jake.
You know how much I love him.

1026
01:08:13,054 --> 01:08:16,319
But I can't keep this up,
staying in the city and all.

1027
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:18,288
I have my own life.

1028
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,918
- I know, Mom. It's just temporary.
- I'm not a young woman anymore.

1029
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:24,429
- I can't keep running around...
- I know. I get it.

1030
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:27,033
I'm working on it.
I'm leaving work early today.

1031
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:30,933
You need a husband.
Jake needs a father.

1032
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:34,473
That ring on your finger,
does it mean anything?

1033
01:08:36,544 --> 01:08:40,844
I'm going to take a shower,
and I'm going home.

1034
01:08:41,016 --> 01:08:42,643
Okay?

1035
01:09:00,802 --> 01:09:05,205
- What are you doing here?
- I feel terrible about last night.

1036
01:09:05,373 --> 01:09:07,603
I just wanna make sure we're okay.

1037
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,802
We're fine, okay? You need to leave.

1038
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,215
- Paul, hey.
- Hey, buddy.

1039
01:09:15,383 --> 01:09:17,180
Look, I got up to the next level.

1040
01:09:17,352 --> 01:09:18,876
Oh, cool. Let me see.

1041
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:22,148
- You gonna pick me up from school today?
- No, Mom's picking you up.

1042
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:26,157
- Can't Paul?
- You know, I can help you out. No problem.

1043
01:09:26,628 --> 01:09:29,495
Hey, Paul, you wanna be my new nanny?

1044
01:09:30,331 --> 01:09:33,892
- Paul's very busy with the play. He can't.
- You know, my days are free.

1045
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,934
No. Absolutely not.

1046
01:09:36,771 --> 01:09:39,899
- Why?
- Because it's a terrible idea.

1047
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,101
- I mean, you being Jake's nanny?
- What, are you sexist?

1048
01:09:45,246 --> 01:09:47,237
Who else you got?

1049
01:09:50,652 --> 01:09:52,483
- This is insane.
- Great.

1050
01:09:52,654 --> 01:09:53,746
Cool, man.

1051
01:09:53,922 --> 01:09:56,186
Darling, did I leave
my glasses out there?

1052
01:09:56,357 --> 01:09:58,484
No, Mom, I don't know where they are.

1053
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,322
Okay, fine, whatever.
I'll call the school this afternoon.

1054
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:04,897
Just go, come on. Go. Now.

1055
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:09,731
Okay, we gotta leave in seven minutes
for school. Let's go.

1056
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:12,930
Paul left his backpack, Mommy.

1057
01:10:13,108 --> 01:10:14,473
Paul?

1058
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:17,372
Uh, Jake's foul-mouthed friend.

1059
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:22,283
That's quite a big backpack for a little boy
like that, don't you think?

1060
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:26,115
I hope you're not sending him to school
with a pack like that.

1061
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:28,255
He'll have a back like mine.

1062
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:31,984
Paul's not a little boy, Grandma.

1063
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,128
He's not?

1064
01:10:34,295 --> 01:10:36,957
Not relative to Jake, of course.

1065
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:39,430
I'd like to meet this Paul.

1066
01:10:39,601 --> 01:10:44,402
- Sure, Mom. I gotta go.
- Julie, think about what I've said.

1067
01:10:44,572 --> 01:10:48,338
Your son needs a father, not a nanny.

1068
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,375
Okay, Mom.

1069
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:26,974
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, man. What's up?

1070
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:30,049
- Look, you gotta see my tattoo.
- Oh, that's... Love your tattoo.

1071
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:33,779
- Look at his, Horatio.
- Oh, whoa, no, no, wait.

1072
01:11:33,955 --> 01:11:35,820
Hi.

1073
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:38,652
Hey, I'll race you to the front.
Last one there is a rotten egg.

1074
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:23,234
Ah! Ohh!

1075
01:12:23,404 --> 01:12:25,838
I thought I might find you two here.

1076
01:12:26,007 --> 01:12:27,838
- Mommy.
- Hey.

1077
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:34,981
What a great surprise.
Hey, you know, you're just in time.

1078
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:38,414
- For what?
- A tickle fight.

1079
01:12:38,586 --> 01:12:40,053
What? Aah!

1080
01:12:53,568 --> 01:12:54,967
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1081
01:12:57,138 --> 01:12:59,698
Nice catch, Mommy.

1082
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:13,744
Yay! Whee!

1083
01:13:17,825 --> 01:13:20,293
I see. You look good there.

1084
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:24,725
Ahh.

1085
01:13:30,838 --> 01:13:34,968
That was the best day ever. Right, Paul?

1086
01:13:39,747 --> 01:13:43,740
- That was really fun today, Mommy.
- Yeah, it was.

1087
01:13:44,652 --> 01:13:48,554
- I love you, Mommy.
- I love you too, angel.

1088
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:05,706
- Is he already out?
- Big day.

1089
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:09,570
- He really had a great time.
- So did I.

1090
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:13,740
Did you?

1091
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:35,765
Have a good show tonight.

1092
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:39,696
So I'll pick him up tomorrow, 3:00?

1093
01:14:40,541 --> 01:14:43,510
Mm. Sure.

1094
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:07,562
<i>A View From the Bridge...</i>

1095
01:15:07,735 --> 01:15:11,227
...marking the triumphant Broadway return
of... Get ready for it.

1096
01:15:11,406 --> 01:15:13,271
Jude Law.

1097
01:15:15,309 --> 01:15:18,506
Excuse me. I just said, Jude Law.

1098
01:15:20,214 --> 01:15:22,079
I'll take that as a no.

1099
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:26,346
Stuart, I'm in way over my head.
I don't know what I'm doing.

1100
01:15:26,521 --> 01:15:28,921
I'm at my best
when I'm struggling for air.

1101
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:32,889
- I'm not talking about work.
- Neither am I.

1102
01:15:34,962 --> 01:15:41,458
Oh, my poor dear, sweet, beautiful,
terribly confused Julie.

1103
01:15:41,869 --> 01:15:47,239
Monogamy is merely anachronistic
Victorian propaganda.

1104
01:15:47,408 --> 01:15:50,866
Maybe so,
but monogamy's what's best for Jake.

1105
01:15:51,045 --> 01:15:54,208
Besides, there's no "-ogomy" going on.
It's not like that.

1106
01:15:54,382 --> 01:15:56,407
Seriously, though.

1107
01:15:57,351 --> 01:16:00,912
What's best for Jake has to include
what's best for Jake's mom.

1108
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,989
Jake. Ha-ha.

1109
01:16:07,161 --> 01:16:09,459
Ooh! Little big man.

1110
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:13,760
<i>Guess what. I just got hired
for a production of The Misanthrope.</i>

1111
01:16:13,935 --> 01:16:15,596
- You did?
- In Boston.

1112
01:16:15,770 --> 01:16:17,635
That's great. That's a very difficult play.

1113
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:20,672
I know. I leave Friday.
It's only for six weeks.

1114
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:21,931
Wow.

1115
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:26,112
Boston. That's a step up
from Weehawken, right?

1116
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:29,443
- It certainly is.
- Hey there. Jake.

1117
01:16:29,617 --> 01:16:30,914
- See you later.
- Bye, Paul.

1118
01:16:36,924 --> 01:16:38,414
"Step up from Weehawken."

1119
01:16:47,768 --> 01:16:49,395
I'm worried about the Yankees.

1120
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:51,663
You think they'll make it
to the Series again?

1121
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,670
I sure hope so, man.

1122
01:16:53,841 --> 01:16:55,331
You can watch it with me.

1123
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,070
I bet I can talk Mommy
into letting me stay up late.

1124
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:01,443
Oh, man, you can't talk her into that.
Sounds like fun, though.

1125
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:04,846
I wish you could be my daddy
instead of Ted.

1126
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,652
Your mom is marrying Ted?

1127
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,851
Jake, it's Grandma.

1128
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,297
Grandma. Jake.

1129
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:19,694
Jake, where are you?

1130
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:23,462
- Hi, Grandma.
- There you are. Mwah, mwah, mwah!

1131
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:25,996
- Who are you?
- That's Paul, Grandma.

1132
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:29,034
Paul? Do I know you?

1133
01:17:30,077 --> 01:17:33,274
Paul. Paul. Where have I heard
that name before?

1134
01:17:33,447 --> 01:17:35,642
- You have a friend...
- He's my new nanny.

1135
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,113
Nanny?

1136
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:42,017
Julie never tells me anything. I don't
know what goes on in that head of hers.

1137
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,351
I'm not even sure
if she's engaged or not.

1138
01:17:46,627 --> 01:17:50,119
Perhaps I'm not the only one
with whom she's evasive.

1139
01:17:50,298 --> 01:17:52,198
Come on, Paul.
I wanna go back to my room.

1140
01:17:52,366 --> 01:17:54,231
Yeah, I'll be right there. All right.

1141
01:17:54,402 --> 01:17:57,803
- He seems very attached to you.
- Yeah, I kind of have that effect on kids.

1142
01:17:57,972 --> 01:18:00,236
- You went to Williams?
- Yeah.

1143
01:18:00,408 --> 01:18:03,673
You know, Jake's biological father
went to Williams.

1144
01:18:03,844 --> 01:18:05,368
- His what?
- Perhaps you know him.

1145
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:07,241
He would be about your age.

1146
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:09,280
- Late 20s?
- Excuse me?

1147
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,748
The D-O-N-O-R.

1148
01:18:22,063 --> 01:18:25,658
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I had this phone a call and...

1149
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:28,161
What's the matter?

1150
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,861
- Where is Jake?
- He's inside with your mother.

1151
01:18:34,508 --> 01:18:36,305
Were you ever gonna tell me?

1152
01:18:41,582 --> 01:18:46,349
I mean, you... You weren't, were you?

1153
01:18:47,755 --> 01:18:49,450
Paul.

1154
01:19:16,617 --> 01:19:19,017
Hey, slugger, how you doing?

1155
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,515
Know what time it is?

1156
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:23,850
- What time?
- It's bath time.

1157
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,822
Go get a book
so Mommy can read to you.

1158
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,023
I don't wanna take a bath.

1159
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:30,129
Jake, you have to, please.

1160
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:33,596
No, I'm not dirty.
I took a bath yesterday.

1161
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:36,100
Jake, you didn't take a bath yesterday.

1162
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,397
- Did so.
- Jake.

1163
01:19:38,572 --> 01:19:41,405
Listen to your mother. Now.

1164
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:50,107
- Mom, what did you do?
- What did I do?

1165
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:53,651
Take a look in the mirror
and ask yourself that question.

1166
01:19:54,221 --> 01:19:58,123
So you think you can reinvent
the wheel, huh?

1167
01:19:59,827 --> 01:20:04,355
- What wheel? There's no wheel.
- Don't you get smart with me, young lady.

1168
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:06,625
I don't care how you did it or why.

1169
01:20:06,801 --> 01:20:08,894
You were incredibly selfish...

1170
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,437
...when you decided to bring
that child into the world.

1171
01:20:12,606 --> 01:20:17,407
But you gave me a beautiful grandson,
so I was selfish and forgave you.

1172
01:20:17,578 --> 01:20:19,443
But you...

1173
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:23,344
Motherhood is selfless.
It's about putting children first.

1174
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:26,645
You may not approve
of every decision I made...

1175
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:30,313
...but you didn't see me run off
having fun at your expense.

1176
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:31,924
Children come first.

1177
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:35,688
Please, Mom. Being a good mother
has nothing to do with being a martyr.

1178
01:20:35,863 --> 01:20:39,890
It's not a punishment nor a badge of honor.
It's a choice.

1179
01:20:40,067 --> 01:20:43,798
And nothing is more important to me
than Jake's happiness.

1180
01:20:44,939 --> 01:20:46,702
Nothing.

1181
01:20:53,247 --> 01:20:56,842
This is about you. What is this?

1182
01:20:57,017 --> 01:20:59,781
A column or a resignation?

1183
01:21:01,422 --> 01:21:02,946
Both.

1184
01:21:03,958 --> 01:21:08,327
Jeez, who am I to write about choices
when I make all the wrong ones myself?

1185
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:10,862
I'm a bad person, okay?
I'm a bad, bad person.

1186
01:21:11,031 --> 01:21:12,862
Aren't we being a tad dramatic?

1187
01:21:13,033 --> 01:21:15,866
A, I knowingly bring a child
into the world without a father.

1188
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:20,336
B, I cross the line, break the law
just to satisfy my own curiosity.

1189
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,966
And C, I end up falling for the guy
who I completely deceived...

1190
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:26,306
...while another man is asking me
to marry him.

1191
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:29,074
I mean, who does that?

1192
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:31,650
Have you read this rag that we write for?

1193
01:21:31,819 --> 01:21:34,219
I'm not saying you made
the smartest decisions...

1194
01:21:34,388 --> 01:21:37,983
...but its pages are filled with people
who've done a hell of a lot worse.

1195
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,824
Frankly, that's why I read it.

1196
01:21:40,995 --> 01:21:42,826
It's comforting.

1197
01:21:45,099 --> 01:21:48,227
I just need to simplify my life.

1198
01:21:49,003 --> 01:21:51,437
Learn from my mistakes.

1199
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,570
When I'm finished with the book tour,
I'm going to quit my job...

1200
01:21:57,745 --> 01:22:01,704
...and I'm going to freelance,
and I'm gonna marry Ted.

1201
01:22:30,144 --> 01:22:32,009
Hey.

1202
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,914
- Aw. I missed you so much.
- Missed you too.

1203
01:22:37,084 --> 01:22:41,748
Hey, I found this amazing little temple
in Shaanxi...

1204
01:22:41,922 --> 01:22:44,447
...where we could have
a traditional Buddhist ceremony.

1205
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:47,526
- It could be so beautiful.
- But we're not Buddhists.

1206
01:22:48,329 --> 01:22:49,956
And how would my friends get here?

1207
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:52,030
We could just throw another party here.

1208
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:55,168
We could let your mother throw one.
Throw it at her country club.

1209
01:22:55,336 --> 01:22:59,534
Let her have her glory. And I spoke to my
travel agent about honeymoon packages.

1210
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:01,698
- I'm thinking Thailand.
- Thailand?

1211
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:04,401
Yeah, it's beautiful this time of year.
You'd love it.

1212
01:23:04,578 --> 01:23:09,447
And I spoke with my friend
who sits on the board at Dalton.

1213
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:11,676
Jake's as good as in.

1214
01:23:13,287 --> 01:23:15,915
Wow, you've taken care of everything,
haven't you?

1215
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:20,720
Well, I just wanna show you
that I'm totally committed.

1216
01:23:24,431 --> 01:23:26,331
What's the matter?

1217
01:23:30,237 --> 01:23:33,331
Ted, I can't do this. I can't marry you.

1218
01:23:33,507 --> 01:23:36,374
I love you. I do. But I...

1219
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:38,401
I can't.

1220
01:23:39,213 --> 01:23:43,843
Why not? I mean, I'm talking
about changing my whole life for you.

1221
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:45,576
And you would be miserable.

1222
01:23:45,753 --> 01:23:47,653
You don't know that.

1223
01:23:48,822 --> 01:23:52,258
- I thought this was what you wanted.
- I don't know what I want anymore.

1224
01:23:52,426 --> 01:23:57,523
- Why? I mean, is there someone else?
- No, no, it's not that.

1225
01:23:57,698 --> 01:24:00,792
Well, what? Christ, Julie.

1226
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:04,027
You gotta let someone in.

1227
01:24:05,272 --> 01:24:06,534
I know.

1228
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:12,069
This isn't easy for me either,
but I really wanna try.

1229
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:19,411
You know, I think you and I, we're so good
for each other in so many ways.

1230
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,248
You're probably right.

1231
01:24:27,194 --> 01:24:30,129
Oh, come on. Come on, Julie.

1232
01:24:34,668 --> 01:24:36,727
You keep it.

1233
01:25:11,372 --> 01:25:14,637
- Jake!
- Where is Paul?

1234
01:25:14,808 --> 01:25:18,141
Mommy took the afternoon off.
We can do whatever you wanna do today.

1235
01:25:18,312 --> 01:25:20,371
He was gonna teach me to spitball.

1236
01:25:21,615 --> 01:25:24,209
Well, Paul is not gonna be
your babysitter anymore.

1237
01:25:24,818 --> 01:25:27,343
- Why, Mommy?
- Let's go get some ice cream.

1238
01:25:27,855 --> 01:25:30,415
- He said he'd be here today.
- Shh.

1239
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:35,858
I know. It's not his fault but he got a job
and it's really, really far away from here.

1240
01:25:36,030 --> 01:25:40,524
But Mommy is gonna find you
the perfect new nanny.

1241
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:43,192
- What about that?
- It's not fair!

1242
01:25:43,370 --> 01:25:44,894
Well, I'm sorry.

1243
01:25:46,073 --> 01:25:48,769
Jake! Jake.

1244
01:25:48,942 --> 01:25:50,967
Jake, you stop!

1245
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:19,570
Jake, what are you doing?

1246
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:21,830
Turn this music down.

1247
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:27,039
Oh, my God. You killed her.

1248
01:26:27,214 --> 01:26:28,738
She's just pretending.

1249
01:26:35,889 --> 01:26:37,914
Is it time to go home yet?

1250
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:41,061
Yes. It's time to go home.

1251
01:26:51,138 --> 01:26:53,732
Mom, it's me.

1252
01:26:53,907 --> 01:26:55,772
I need your help.

1253
01:27:01,281 --> 01:27:04,273
I miss Paul, Mommy.

1254
01:27:04,451 --> 01:27:06,510
Me too.

1255
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,496
Come with Grandma, darling.

1256
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:28,573
- Grandma, did you get cable yet?
- What's that? Go. Now, get out of here.

1257
01:27:29,042 --> 01:27:31,306
You've got those, dear?

1258
01:27:31,478 --> 01:27:35,209
- Thanks, Ma, for doing this.
- Julie, darling...

1259
01:27:35,382 --> 01:27:37,179
...when you finish your tour...

1260
01:27:37,351 --> 01:27:41,879
...why don't you take a leave of absence
and let me take care of you too?

1261
01:27:42,055 --> 01:27:44,819
I can't quit.
It's the only thing I know I'm good at.

1262
01:27:44,992 --> 01:27:48,257
Jake, you and Grandma
are gonna have a wonderful time...

1263
01:27:48,428 --> 01:27:50,896
...while Mommy's working.

1264
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,499
"...prepared to close the door
for the last time.

1265
01:27:55,669 --> 01:27:58,866
He looked around the room,
wondering why it had taken him so long...

1266
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,406
...to realize that it was time to leave."

1267
01:28:02,576 --> 01:28:04,476
Thank you.

1268
01:28:11,051 --> 01:28:14,179
Hey, mwah, thanks for coming.

1269
01:28:14,354 --> 01:28:17,619
I'm so glad we start with Manhattan,
kind of ease into the whole thing.

1270
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:20,282
Nonsense. You're great.
Everybody loves you.

1271
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:23,725
- That's because they don't know me. Hey.
- Wonderful.

1272
01:28:23,897 --> 01:28:27,230
But what a zoo. I almost came to blows
with a fellow patron of the arts.

1273
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:29,699
And she was a real bruiser.

1274
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:33,869
- I hope you were fighting over my book.
- What else?

1275
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:36,976
Artie, this is a very good friend of mine,
Stuart Blakerman.

1276
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:39,738
Nice to meet you.
Julie boring you with her humdrum life?

1277
01:28:39,913 --> 01:28:41,778
Not at all. Nice to meet you.

1278
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:46,352
<i>I'm sorry, I'm half asleep. I stayed up
too late watching Emma on PBS.</i>

1279
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,547
- Me too. I'm a sucker for Austen.
- So am I.

1280
01:28:50,824 --> 01:28:54,282
Very pretty eyes. Very pretty eyes.
Yeah, very beautiful.

1281
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:59,531
- Everything going all right?
- Why wouldn't it be?

1282
01:29:00,534 --> 01:29:03,833
Just checking.
May I speak to Jake, please.

1283
01:29:04,037 --> 01:29:05,299
Yes, of course.

1284
01:29:05,472 --> 01:29:08,873
Jake, come talk to your mother.

1285
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:12,671
So I hear Artie came to the reading.

1286
01:29:12,846 --> 01:29:15,144
How did you find?

1287
01:29:15,315 --> 01:29:16,839
Yeah, it was sweet of him.

1288
01:29:17,451 --> 01:29:20,943
- Good catch, eh?
- Absolutely.

1289
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:23,214
<i>So where are you off to now?</i>

1290
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:25,358
Boston. Two readings.

1291
01:29:26,293 --> 01:29:28,693
<i>- Boston.
- Yes, Boston.</i>

1292
01:29:28,862 --> 01:29:30,523
Julie.

1293
01:29:30,697 --> 01:29:34,360
- Yes, Mom.
- Do what is best for the child.

1294
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:36,996
<i>- Mom, I...
- Julie.</i>

1295
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:40,772
Listen to your mother for once.

1296
01:29:42,542 --> 01:29:44,567
Talk to your mother.

1297
01:29:45,545 --> 01:29:46,773
Mommy.

1298
01:30:51,478 --> 01:30:54,242
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

1299
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:58,180
- Is Paul Cooper around?
- Can I say who's inquiring?

1300
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:01,344
<i>Julie Davidson
from Metropolitan Magazine.</i>

1301
01:31:01,521 --> 01:31:03,352
One moment.

1302
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:06,623
Hey, wait.

1303
01:31:06,793 --> 01:31:08,454
Yeah.

1304
01:31:08,895 --> 01:31:10,419
Um...

1305
01:31:12,065 --> 01:31:14,158
Could you tell him?

1306
01:31:15,435 --> 01:31:18,529
This is much harder
than I thought it would be.

1307
01:31:18,705 --> 01:31:21,640
If you want comp tickets,
I'm sure he'd be happy to help you.

1308
01:31:23,443 --> 01:31:26,071
It's not that. Um...

1309
01:31:27,581 --> 01:31:29,606
Thanks anyway.

1310
01:31:47,934 --> 01:31:50,027
- Hi, what can I get you?
- Cappuccino, please.

1311
01:31:50,203 --> 01:31:53,104
- Sure, I'll be right back.
- Thanks.

1312
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:07,243
Hey.

1313
01:32:07,854 --> 01:32:09,287
Mind if I join?

1314
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:14,793
You an angel or something?

1315
01:32:16,029 --> 01:32:17,724
Hardly.

1316
01:32:23,603 --> 01:32:27,095
So, uh, how's Jake?

1317
01:32:29,242 --> 01:32:32,370
He misses you. Bad.

1318
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:36,606
So do I.

1319
01:32:38,518 --> 01:32:40,418
I miss him too.

1320
01:32:41,288 --> 01:32:43,119
And you.

1321
01:32:49,196 --> 01:32:52,290
Paul, I didn't mean to betray you.

1322
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,634
I... I just...

1323
01:32:55,802 --> 01:32:58,134
I wanted to know you.

1324
01:32:58,305 --> 01:33:01,741
For Jake, at first.

1325
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:04,734
And later, for me.

1326
01:33:05,946 --> 01:33:08,005
It was wrong...

1327
01:33:08,181 --> 01:33:11,708
...and I've been trying to find a way
to say I'm sorry...

1328
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:13,981
...and nothing's good enough.

1329
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:20,187
Some writer, huh?

1330
01:33:26,032 --> 01:33:27,363
So, what do we do now?
