00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:40,230
(♪♪♪)

3
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:20,604
(♪♪♪)

4
00:01:50,703 --> 00:02:00,644
(♪♪♪)

5
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:46,290
- (Piano keynote plays)
- Don't do that.

6
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,457
Oh, I'm so sorry!

7
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,592
Here, we don't.

8
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:49,559
It's broken.

9
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,795
Great light.

10
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,764
Indeed,
especially in the morning.

11
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:55,499
You know, there's a lovely
courtyard in the back.

12
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:56,633
You should take a look.

13
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,168
Can we afford this?

14
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,002
It's a good deal.

15
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:02,673
Whose stuff is this?

16
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,608
Yeah, this is all
from a previous tenant.

17
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,611
And you know, it's been
unoccupied for some time,

18
00:03:07,613 --> 00:03:09,846
as you can see,
but you know, all this stuff,

19
00:03:09,848 --> 00:03:12,482
you can take it, leave it.
You can do whatever you want.

20
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:13,750
Could we get it cleaned, though?

21
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,120
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:18,588
Could cleaners come?

23
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,058
Why?

24
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,894
It's just kind of dirty.

25
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,930
Don't you have a broom?

26
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,135
Shall we see the bedrooms?

27
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:35,038
Here, I'll follow you up,
there's more to see

28
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
just right up this way.

29
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,208
- Okay, thank you.
- After you.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,182
So this bedroom comes equipped
with a Murphy bed,

31
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,885
you can keep it up
or you can bring it down.

32
00:03:48,887 --> 00:03:51,488
Really as you wish,
which is nice.

33
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,156
But you have to walk
through this room

34
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:54,624
to get to the other one.

35
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:55,592
Hmm.

36
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:06,470
Well, you see, actually,
if you go through here,

37
00:04:06,472 --> 00:04:11,074
you'll see that each room
has a separate entrance.

38
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,809
Great.
Addie you can take this room.

39
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,878
But the rooms are connected.

40
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,347
(Chuckles) No, they look...
they have separate locks

41
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,482
right here on the doors.

42
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:20,751
Okay, but how does that work?

43
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,419
I suppose
whoever gets there first

44
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,653
gets to lock the other one out.

45
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:24,888
Or in.

46
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,590
I'm not gonna lock you in.
Relax.

47
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:28,191
And look,
you get a little doorway

48
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,559
out into the hall.

49
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,695
But I only have access
to the rest of the apartment

50
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:32,829
through this hallway.

51
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,866
No... yeah, that's good.

52
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:38,335
I can't have you going in
and out of my room all the time.

53
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:41,104
You know, it's a little
private entrance for you.

54
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,306
- That's true.
- Yeah.

55
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,575
Oh.

56
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:47,778
Also I've gotta show you...

57
00:04:50,082 --> 00:05:00,023
(♪♪♪)

58
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:10,367
(Rustling)

59
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,043
Don't!

60
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,012
- Sorry.
- It's annoying.

61
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,314
Settle.

62
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,284
(Beatboxing)

63
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,953
Oh, for each side, bro

64
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,288
Town.

65
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,956
- It's nice of you.
- Yeah.

66
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,558
Let's get drunk to celebrate.

67
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,760
I really want to,
but I have to learn my lines.

68
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:39,763
Well, we're uptown girls.
It rocks.

69
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:42,132
No! Oh, I have to focus.

70
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,066
Take it.

71
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:45,902
Okay, fine.

72
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:49,072
Ooh.

73
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,006
Chin chin!

74
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,847
Eww, it's so warm,

75
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:58,482
Uh, it's room temp.

76
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,416
It's it's an acquired taste.

77
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:00,650
Okay, but that's disgusting.

78
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,152
NOELLE:
It's not.

79
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,588
It's very sophisticated.

80
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,159
Oh, my God.

81
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:11,862
Oh, my God.

82
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,531
Oh, my God.

83
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,765
(Noelle grunts)

84
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:16,967
Eww. What the...

85
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,503
(Coughs) Oh God. Oh God.

86
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:25,308
Is there somewhere we could
donate the rest of these?

87
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,209
NOELLE:
It's expired.

88
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:27,544
Well, it's not all expired

89
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,379
and it just seems
pretty wasteful.

90
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,817
Okay, so you want to donate
mostly expired poisonous food

91
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:34,951
to poor people?

92
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:37,087
I'm just trying
to be considerate.

93
00:06:38,156 --> 00:06:39,789
Poverty mentality.

94
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:40,857
What?

95
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,492
Poverty is a mindset.

96
00:06:42,494 --> 00:06:44,661
Rich dad, poor dad.

97
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,330
Your dad is poor.
Does he have poverty mentality?

98
00:06:47,332 --> 00:06:49,199
My dad's not poor.
You're just really rich.

99
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,400
I am not rich.

100
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:52,002
My family has money, but...

101
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:53,003
Money they should give us.

102
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,671
Well, they don't, so...

103
00:06:54,673 --> 00:06:55,739
Why don't you just ask.

104
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:59,309
You know my dad.
I can't answer.

105
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,077
Yeah, you can.
It's almost Christmas.

106
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,146
Come on, I'm Jewish.

107
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:06,216
Okay, well, that doesn't matter.

108
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,651
I don't get Christmas presents.

109
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:12,222
Whatever. Your dad would have
written a cheque.

110
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,390
He's not emotionally
invested in you.

111
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,158
He doesn't care. You're right.

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,226
But he would have written
a cheque

113
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,260
and he owes it to you anyway

114
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:18,662
'cause he fucked you up
so badly.

115
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:20,263
Okay, Noelle.

116
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:21,264
What?

117
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,133
Please stop.

118
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,102
You love been a victim.

119
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:27,070
I'm a survivor.

120
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,673
You're a victim and you love it.

121
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:32,242
What are you?

122
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,545
A high functioning,
emotionally stable person?

123
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,581
Okay. Why have you never had
a boyfriend before then?

124
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:38,582
Because I'm not you.

125
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,716
I don't seek validation
from men.

126
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:40,817
Or a real job.

127
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,420
- Your job is not real.
- Yes, it is.

128
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,721
You're an aspiring actress!

129
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,056
You make videos of yourself
doing pretend shit

130
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:47,524
on your phone all day.

131
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,859
It's called a self-tape
and it takes a lot of courage.

132
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,029
(music begins)

133
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:05,208
Hey.

134
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,410
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

135
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:08,345
Smudging.

136
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,247
What's smudging.

137
00:08:11,249 --> 00:08:13,483
All kinds of space.

138
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,453
It smells really nice.

139
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,556
No gets rid of bad vibes.

140
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,892
Yeah, um, about that.

141
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:28,632
I'm really sorry, but I was
earlier just being a bitch.

142
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,799
It's okay.

143
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,701
It's not. It was so unnecessary.

144
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:33,837
Oh, it is.

145
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm excited to live here.

146
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:40,977
It's gonna be so cool,
you know, making it nice...

147
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,313
make it more us.

148
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,714
Definitely.

149
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:53,023
Hey, could I sleep in your bed
with you tonight?

150
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,024
Addie?

151
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:55,425
Come on, it'll be fun.

152
00:08:55,427 --> 00:08:59,462
Just like Salvatore
first night vibes.

153
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,697
Just tonight.

154
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,932
Greg is getting my bed
out of storage tomorrow.

155
00:09:02,934 --> 00:09:04,868
NOELLE:
There's an air mattress.

156
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,138
Okay, but I just thought
it would be nice.

157
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,940
I'm not drunk enough
to share a bed with someone.

158
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:12,509
Come on.
We did it in college.

159
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,178
I was on drugs and drunk
the entire time in college.

160
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,479
I'll give you an Ambien.

161
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:17,981
NOELLE:
That gives me nightmares.

162
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:19,282
I don't want any Ambien.

163
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:22,318
I just really don't like
sleeping alone.

164
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,221
Then go to Greg's.
Have Greg over here.

165
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:26,723
He says,
I have bad boundaries,

166
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:29,192
which is just
absolutely ridiculous

167
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,661
because he is a retard

168
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:34,230
and doesn't know
what boundaries even mean.

169
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:36,466
NOELLE:
And I agree that he's retarded.

170
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:37,367
I... stop.
I... only I can call him that.

171
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,334
I only I.

172
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:39,469
(Door bell buzzing)

173
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,208
Let me check.

174
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:52,382
Hmm, it's some girl.

175
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,017
NOELLE:
Who?

176
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:56,586
She looks kind of
Jehovah's Witnesses,

177
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:58,922
Fuck that, fuck that.
Get down. Get down.

178
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:00,890
Down, down, down,
down, down, down,.

179
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:57,280
(♪♪♪)

180
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,706
(Grunts)

181
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:32,682
(Snoring)

182
00:11:50,302 --> 00:11:51,267
(Gasps)

183
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,406
(Shreiks)

184
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:16,292
(Grunting)

185
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,405
(Screaming)

186
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
What size do you think
my bed is?

187
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,188
Like a whole...

188
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,257
Hmm, twin XL.

189
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,025
What the fuck is a twin XL?

190
00:12:49,027 --> 00:12:50,827
It's like a twin,
but for a bigger children

191
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:51,928
or single adults.

192
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,363
NOELLE:
Bigger children.

193
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:55,598
Single adults like you.

194
00:12:56,868 --> 00:13:01,304
Okay, well, what if these
single adults get horny?

195
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,907
Well, then I guess
they just do it

196
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,008
in their twin sized bed.

197
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:07,076
What kind of loser
would fuck somebody

198
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,778
in a twin bed?

199
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
- No.
- Oh, hey. Here you are.

200
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:12,782
Greg.

201
00:13:12,784 --> 00:13:13,783
(Laughs)

202
00:13:14,953 --> 00:13:16,119
Hey, what's up, Noelle?

203
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,120
Nothing.

204
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,858
(Chuckles)
Congrats on the new pad.

205
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,259
- Thank you.
- Can't wait to see that.

206
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,727
Yeah, you're gonna love it.

207
00:13:24,729 --> 00:13:26,696
Sweet.
You guys gonna get a tree?

208
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:28,765
Greg,
what is this new obsession?

209
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,234
What, it's beautiful.

210
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:34,470
Hey, Greg,
would you have sex with a girl

211
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:36,739
who slept in a twin bed?

212
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,041
Yeah, I have.

213
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,910
Just get a new mattress,

214
00:13:40,912 --> 00:13:43,579
if you're so worried
about your sexual viability.

215
00:13:43,581 --> 00:13:46,416
Hmm. Then I'd have to move it
when I leave and it just...

216
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:47,650
Wait, what do you mean?

217
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:49,452
- Like when I move out?
- Why would you move out?

218
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,453
I don't know.

219
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,221
People change.
Things change.

220
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:54,123
But we literally just moved in.

221
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,425
Yeah, but, you know.

222
00:13:55,427 --> 00:13:57,593
What am I supposed to do
when you move out?

223
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:59,062
- Live with Greg.
- What? No.

224
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,797
But I thought
we were in this together.

225
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,100
Are you kidding me?

226
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,034
No, I hate it
when you get like this.

227
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:08,304
Why... like what?

228
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,240
Hey, hand soap
honey suckle or oat blossom.

229
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:12,842
I'm not so keen on honeysuckle.

230
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:15,278
- Like what?
- Like shrill and annoying.

231
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,579
Just relax.

232
00:14:16,581 --> 00:14:19,082
Don't tell me to relax, okay?

233
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:20,783
You want to live
with a hostage,

234
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,185
is that what you want,
is that make you feel good?

235
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:23,753
Fuck you.

236
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:26,422
- Okay, I'm going to go home.
- Okay.

237
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:29,859
You okay?

238
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,127
Noelle hurt my feelings.

239
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:31,961
You okay, baby?

240
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:32,929
No.

241
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:48,878
(♪♪♪)

242
00:14:51,216 --> 00:14:52,782
(banging on door)

243
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:01,891
- Hi.
- NOELLE: Hi.

244
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:03,793
I'm a broker with Arrow Realty.

245
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:06,295
Did my associate tell you
I would be coming by?

246
00:15:06,297 --> 00:15:07,563
No.

247
00:15:07,565 --> 00:15:10,833
Oh, well I just have some
unfinished paperwork.

248
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:11,801
Is now a good time?

249
00:15:11,803 --> 00:15:12,969
No actually...

250
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:14,470
It really isn't gonna take long.

251
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:15,872
NOELLE:
Hey, excuse me.

252
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,140
It really just, it'll really
only take a minute.

253
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,007
No, whoa, whoa.

254
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:18,941
It's fine, it's...

255
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,715
Oh my god.

256
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,218
I'm gonna be sick.

257
00:15:32,023 --> 00:15:34,257
(The Girl vomitting, coughs)

258
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,659
Here.

259
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:38,928
It's water.

260
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,829
Thanks.

261
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:45,902
I have to tell you something.

262
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:47,236
NOELLE:
Okay.

263
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,775
Something extremely sinister
happened in this apartment,

264
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,646
in your room.

265
00:15:58,516 --> 00:15:59,282
NOELLE:
What?

266
00:16:00,952 --> 00:16:02,418
Do you know
who Jeffrey Epstein is?

267
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:05,088
NOELLE:
The billionaire?

268
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,322
He owned this apartment.

269
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,592
NOELLE:
He lived here?

270
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,527
No, he didn't live here.

271
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:13,596
This was probably
some kind of orgy flop house.

272
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,667
Maybe he housed his slaves
here, I don't know.

273
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:19,836
NOELLE:
You're not a realtor.

274
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:22,472
I'm sorry I lied.

275
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,942
Why did you come here?

276
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:29,078
I'm investigating
Epstein's death

277
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,114
and the high-profile rapists
in his network.

278
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:34,650
My work has led me here,

279
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,454
which I believe to be
one of his many properties.

280
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,388
NOELLE:
So you're a detective?

281
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,224
(Sniffles)

282
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,759
No, I think we know the feds

283
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:45,328
aren't to be trusted
in this case.

284
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:47,697
NOELLE:
That's true.

285
00:16:49,434 --> 00:16:52,535
But you think that somebody
was murdered in my bed?

286
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:55,805
I don't know.

287
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,809
Murdered, raped, sacrificed.

288
00:17:01,913 --> 00:17:02,879
(Sniffles)

289
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,251
Please don't tell anyone
you saw me here.

290
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,353
NOELLE:
Are you in danger?

291
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,326
You came here for a reason.

292
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:23,299
I came here to get closer
to the truth.

293
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:24,300
(music ends)

294
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:26,369
(Car horns honking)

295
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:31,841
Sorry Noelle's being
such a bitch.

296
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,210
(Grunts) Yeah.
What's that cunt's problem?

297
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:35,511
Right?

298
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,712
Sorry.

299
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,347
We've been looking
for a place for weeks,

300
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,950
and we finally find
this beautiful apartment.

301
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:43,986
and like usual,
she can't commit to anything.

302
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:49,325
Yeah well, maybe a certain tree
will cheer her up, huh?

303
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:51,627
I even let her have
the better room.

304
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,563
I slept on an air mattress
last night,

305
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,399
and I had the most insane dream.

306
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:58,634
- Was I in it?
- No.

307
00:17:58,636 --> 00:18:01,571
I was alone, but I felt like
there was somebody there.

308
00:18:04,976 --> 00:18:05,975
I couldn't speak.

309
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,211
I...

310
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:10,880
My hands
were tied in this like...

311
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,651
blue and white like twine,

312
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:17,820
covered in oil.

313
00:18:17,822 --> 00:18:18,888
(Greg grunts)

314
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,890
What kind of oil?

315
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,058
I don't know.

316
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:24,594
It was nighttime.

317
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:28,397
Everything felt so familiar.

318
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,068
There were palm trees,
someone was playing the piano.

319
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,236
GREG:
You play piano?

320
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,170
No, Greg!

321
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:37,707
Listen, it was really scary.

322
00:18:37,709 --> 00:18:40,610
No, no, no, I do get it,
but hey...

323
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,346
it's just a dream, all right?

324
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:44,080
It's not real.

325
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,948
Yeah, but it felt real.

326
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,783
The island felt so remote,

327
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:52,622
and I had no like,
identity or autonomy.

328
00:18:52,624 --> 00:18:53,889
Aha!

329
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:55,524
Well, it sounds like

330
00:18:55,526 --> 00:18:56,959
what you really need's
a wake up call.

331
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,894
ADDIE:
Stop, it's not funny.

332
00:18:58,896 --> 00:19:00,463
I couldn't move.

333
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:01,864
I was vibrating
and I don't know,

334
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,332
it just made me feel sick.

335
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:05,668
It was like sleep paralysis.

336
00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:09,972
GREG:
Yeah, no, that is weird.

337
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:15,378
Are you listening at all?

338
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,116
Look, I'm sorry your dream
sucked, all right?

339
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,250
Maybe lay off the Ambien.

340
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,252
It's not the Ambien.

341
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,687
(Breathing heavily)

342
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:34,163

THE GIRL: You know one of the
girls tried to swim off the island?

359
00:20:19,644 --> 00:20:22,144
Shark infested waters.

360
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:24,213
Ghislaine Maxwell came for her
on a jet ski.

361
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:36,125
(♪♪♪)

362
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:46,635
NOELLE: What would they
have done with the dome?

363
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:48,170
THE GIRL:
Look.

364
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:49,672
NOELLE: No I know,
there's fucking mattresses in there.

365
00:20:49,674 --> 00:20:50,940
THE GIRL: Yeah,
they're probably soaked in blood, too.

366
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:55,478
Why would you need
a private island,

367
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,946
unless you were fucking kids?

368
00:20:57,849 --> 00:20:59,382
Yep.

369
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,217
They say he played piano
in there.

370
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,220
You think?

371
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,654
ADDIE:
Hey, Noelle.

372
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:06,622
Hey.

373
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,994
I went ahead and got that tree.

374
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:14,263
Thought it could you know,

375
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:16,766
make it a little seasonal
and homey in here,

376
00:21:16,768 --> 00:21:18,401
spice things up
for the holidays.

377
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:22,338
Thanks Greg, it's cute.

378
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,739
Um, hi.

379
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:28,911
Hi, sorry, we were just,
doing some work.

380
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,313
It's okay. I'm Addie.

381
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,349
Nice to meet you.

382
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:38,587
THE GIRL: Oh, this one,
this is a good one.

383
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:42,191
Uh Noelle, can I talk to you
for a second upstairs?

384
00:21:45,296 --> 00:21:46,695
I'll be there momentarily.

385
00:21:48,232 --> 00:21:49,031
Okay.

386
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah.

387
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,474
GREG:
I'm Greg, by the way.

388
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:01,477
- Hi.
- Enchante.

389
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,448
What are you working on?

390
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:08,050
Research.

391
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:09,552
ADDIE: That's the girl who
came over here last night.

392
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:10,586
I know.

393
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:11,954
She has it on good authority

394
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,489
that this place used to belong
to Jeffrey Epstein.

395
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:16,592
Okay. (Chuckling)

396
00:22:16,594 --> 00:22:17,460
When's she leaving?

397
00:22:18,896 --> 00:22:20,729
I don't know. We're just
starting to figure things out.

398
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:22,898
Figure what out?

399
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:26,402
Again, I don't know,
just all of this.

400
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:30,306
Okay, well is it fun?

401
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,576
Do you care
about Jeffrey Epstein?

402
00:22:33,578 --> 00:22:34,510
Do you?

403
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:36,779
Very much so, yes.

404
00:22:36,781 --> 00:22:39,048
GREG: Isn't that the guy who
murdered himself in jail?

405
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,650
He was murdered.

406
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,086
You can't murder yourself,
someone else has to do it.

407
00:22:44,088 --> 00:22:45,621
Wow, really?

408
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,256
I could've sworn I heard

409
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,458
that it was like a suicide
on the news or something.

410
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,327
Well, it wasn't a suicide,
no one thinks that.

411
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,530
Huh, maybe he was sad.

412
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:58,767
Okay well can you guys
just go to a park,

413
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:01,604
or a diner, or something,
because I do have an audition?

414
00:23:01,606 --> 00:23:04,640
That's great, very excited
to hear that but no,

415
00:23:04,642 --> 00:23:08,477
because things that are
very sinister happened here.

416
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,445
So we have to be here.

417
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:10,713
You understand?

418
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:11,947
- Okay.
- This is the space.

419
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,782
- Yes, fine.
- I'm gonna go to Greg's but...

420
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:15,150
- That's good, that's great.
- ADDIE: When I get back,

421
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:18,354
I think we should talk
about house rules or...

422
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:20,289
You know people can seem
happy on the surface,

423
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:24,493
but deep down,
they're hurting inside.

424
00:23:24,495 --> 00:23:26,195
He had to cum
three times a day.

425
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:28,464
Sounds pretty sad to me.

426
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,734
ADDIE:
Greg, we're leaving.

427
00:23:31,736 --> 00:23:33,736
I'm just gonna
plug this in and...

428
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:35,604
No, we're Jewish, Greg.

429
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,807
We're Jewish, can we go?

430
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:41,343
Okay, good luck
with that project.

431
00:23:41,345 --> 00:23:42,912
Nice meeting you.

432
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:44,847
Bye, Noelle.
See you later, alligator.

433
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:45,814
NOELLE:
Sorry about that.

434
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,551
Who were those people?

435
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,886
My roommate and her boyfriend.

436
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,924
She's really hostile.

437
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:57,226
Yeah, she's got
a lot mental problems.

438
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,260
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

439
00:23:58,262 --> 00:23:59,762
She seems so normal.

440
00:23:59,764 --> 00:24:01,430
No, very sick girl.

441
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,001
Do you know about pizza gate?

442
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:09,104
MAN ON TV: <i>It was described
as four penises, oval shaped,</i>

443
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,442
<i>and claimed with a rack that
was thick towards the bottom,</i>

444
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:16,378
<i>but was thin and small
towards the head portion.</i>

445
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,247
NOELLE: Have you seen
the deposition video,

446
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,317
where they're talking about
tiny, egg-shaped cock?

447
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:23,385
Disgusting.

448
00:24:23,387 --> 00:24:25,287
THE GIRL:
Yeah.

449
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,522
NOELLE:
Have you been on the Reddit?

450
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:27,957
Reddit's for fucking
bottom feeders,

451
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,959
but there's a lot
of really good threads.

452
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:31,927
There's like this one about
if it's a-

453
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:32,761
Here.

454
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,933
This is speed.

455
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,435
No, it's not, it's Vyvanse.

456
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,103
Then why'd you take it
out of the capsule?

457
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:42,738
Manufacturer recommends it.

458
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,505
Just drink it.

459
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,649
NOELLE: I just looked at
so much occult imagery,

460
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:56,585
the ornate red glyphs
on the ground,

461
00:24:56,587 --> 00:24:58,721
fucking owl statues.

462
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:02,825
THE GIRL: Kamal, considered the
god of ritualistic child sacrifice.

463
00:25:02,827 --> 00:25:04,093
Bohemian grove type shit.

464
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:05,561
NOELLE:
Bohemia Grove?

465
00:25:05,563 --> 00:25:06,762
THE GIRL: You know the thing,
where those rich people,

466
00:25:06,764 --> 00:25:08,497
they LARP, and they like
worship that statue,

467
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:09,665
it's like a bull sometimes.

468
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:11,166
Did you know...

469
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,568
No one talks about it.

470
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,169
The harsh angularity
of these blue and white stripes.

471
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:16,171
When you contrast
with concentric dome,

472
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:17,239
it's pretty fucked up.

473
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,607
And this door is a trumploy,

474
00:25:18,609 --> 00:25:20,643
but to a trained eye
it's very poorly painted.

475
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,011
Are you an architect
or something?

476
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:22,978
NOELLE:
No.

477
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,313
THE GIRL:
God, are these yours?

478
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,616
- Ew!
- Demented!

479
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:29,785
Why does Ghislaine dress
like a fucking nutcracker?

480
00:25:29,787 --> 00:25:30,619
THE GIRL:
Boring.

481
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:33,122
(Overlapping speech)

482
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:34,523
Blah, blah, blah.

483
00:25:34,525 --> 00:25:36,458
Noelle, the collar
is the symbol parts

484
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,926
belongs to slave hood.

485
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:38,927
It's an outward symbol of your-

486
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,162
NOELLE:
Whoever did the body...

487
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,030
(Overlapping speech)

488
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:43,132
Did a fucking good job!

489
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:43,799
THE GIRL: Why do you
think I circled the nose?

490
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,035
Not. Not.

491
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:47,136
THE GIRL:
I circled the notes.

492
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,370
Not

493
00:25:54,545 --> 00:25:56,779
(Siren wailing in distance)

494
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:04,253
(Game character laughing)

495
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:16,532
(Game chimes)

496
00:26:18,736 --> 00:26:19,802
ADDIE:
Do you think she's pretty?

497
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:23,238
Who?

498
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,907
That girl, Noelle's friend.

499
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:29,211
Oh, I didn't really notice.

500
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,118
Do you think I'm pretty?

501
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:40,723
Um, I'm just like
really focused.

502
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:41,857
Yeah, but I'm just really...

503
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:44,059
Just not right now.

504
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,527
Okay?

505
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,463
I really gotta focus
on the game.

506
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,838
Are you staying over tonight?

507
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:58,440
Do you not want me to?

508
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:03,378
No, I mean, I just wake up
early for work.

509
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,114
But I thought you were gonna
help me move tomorrow?

510
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:08,917
Yeah, sorry.

511
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,521
(Upbeat game music)

512
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:36,478
NOELLE: Touch these,
they feel like sandpaper.

513
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,783
THE GIRL:
Your roommate's fucking weird.

514
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:44,920
Why do you live with her,
anyway?

515
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:46,455
NOELLE: Uh,
her dad used to pay for everything,

516
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,956
and then she decided
she was too good

517
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,892
to take money from him
because of some that he did

518
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,394
to her a long time ago,
I don't know.

519
00:27:54,165 --> 00:27:55,998
THE GIRL:
Hmm.

520
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,432
How'd you end up here?

521
00:27:57,434 --> 00:27:59,501
NOELLE:
No proof of credit, no income.

522
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,270
It's good to be off the grid.

523
00:28:01,272 --> 00:28:02,304
NOELLE:
Totally.

524
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,438
Where do you live?

525
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,206
THE GIRL:
Uptown.

526
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:08,744
Epstein had to have
known it was gonna happen

527
00:28:08,746 --> 00:28:10,045
when he landed at Teterboro.

528
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,282
There's no way he didn't.

529
00:28:13,284 --> 00:28:15,083
God dammit, Noelle!

530
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:18,187
I don't care about your
kinky roommate, okay.

531
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:19,721
I've been following this
for years.

532
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,324
When Epstein got arrested,
I knew something wasn't right.

533
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,959
I could feel it in my bones.

534
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:25,661
Right?
Who do you think killed him?

535
00:28:26,764 --> 00:28:28,463
The Clinton crime family,
obviously.

536
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:30,265
No, it was the Royals.

537
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:32,034
- What, because of Andrew?
- NOELLE: Mm-hmm.

538
00:28:32,036 --> 00:28:33,702
- They're irrelevant.
- No, they're not.

539
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:34,970
Bill Clinton flew
on the Lolita express

540
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:36,505
like 52 times.

541
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,040
No, they're not, the British
are so fucking cucked

542
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,608
by the Royal family,
you have no idea.

543
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,109
They'll do anything
to protect their image,

544
00:28:41,111 --> 00:28:43,612
even if it means hiring
their intelligence service

545
00:28:43,614 --> 00:28:46,615
to fucking kill someone,
on behalf of Andrew,

546
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,550
so that he can continue
to fuck kids.

547
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:49,451
No, you're right.

548
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:51,153
Queen Elizabeth is despicable.

549
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:53,689
She's a batty old cunt,
and I wish she would drop dead.

550
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,023
They killed Princess Di.

551
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:57,693
That's true.

552
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:02,865
Noelle?

553
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:07,836
The important thing is that
we're awake.

554
00:29:07,838 --> 00:29:17,779

555

(Man laughing)

557
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:20,042
I wanna see the cell.

558
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:20,943
ADDIE:
I wanna see the body.

559
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,644
The real body, not some decoy.

560
00:30:22,646 --> 00:30:24,079
They use our tax dollars...

561
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,113
I don't pay taxes.

562
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,214
Neither do I,
but some people do,

563
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:27,950
and their money paid
for a fake body.

564
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:35,991
Do you know no one
in the history of MCC

565
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:37,292
has ever committed suicide?

566
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,894
Technically they still haven't.

567
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:41,563
- (Door thudding)
- Because he was murdered!

568
00:30:41,565 --> 00:30:43,699
(Addie panting)

569
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:53,809
(Cloth tearing)

570
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:07,990
He knelt with force.

571
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:09,524
- No, he didn't.
- Watch.

572
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:21,303

573
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:23,405

(Chokinh)

579
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,223
Are you okay?

580
00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:51,026
(Coughing)

581
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:53,562
- Are you okay?
- See, there's no way.

582
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:55,697
The suicide angle's
the most apocryphal bullshit.

583
00:32:59,369 --> 00:33:00,335
(Groans)

584
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:11,646
They want us dead,
and they wanna fuck our kids.

585
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:14,049
Celebrities, politicians.

586
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:15,317
Of course, they're pedophiles.

587
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,885
Their exploitation knows
no bounds.

588
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,153
No bounds.

589
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:20,889
They're driving the world
into chaos, into ruin.

590
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,029
NOELLE:
What's that?

591
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:33,335
Um, it's just my research.

592
00:33:34,271 --> 00:33:35,170
NOELLE:
Like what?

593
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:42,844
Like, names, locations,

594
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,981
flight logs.

595
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,984
It's kind of like
my black book. (chuckling)

596
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:53,554
Can I see it?

597
00:33:53,556 --> 00:33:54,355
I've never shown anybody
before.

598
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:56,925
You don't trust me?

599
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:00,128
It's not, it's not that.

600
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,929
Then what?

601
00:34:02,366 --> 00:34:05,367
It's just been alone
in this for so long.

602
00:34:05,369 --> 00:34:06,601
But all your hard work,

603
00:34:06,603 --> 00:34:08,270
everything's starting
to come to fruition.

604
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,673
People are really starting
to listen.

605

(♪♪♪)

606
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:39,467
I've never done this
with a girl before.

607
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:41,636
Oh?

608
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:43,038
NOELLE:
I mean, I want to.

(Moaning)

612
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,331
They're going to get away
with it, aren't they?

613
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:18,633
THE GIRL:
They always do.

614
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,037
Don't you get scared?

615
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:24,239
Sometimes.

616
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:26,675
But it's my path.

617
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:28,843
Yeah.

618
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,347
I'm not like normal people.

619
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,517
I'm obsessed
with political struggle.

620
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,053
I admire it.

621
00:36:39,122 --> 00:36:40,522
I never really cared
about anything.

622
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:42,390
Really?

623
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:45,327
I care about you, though.

624
00:36:47,264 --> 00:36:48,063
I know.

625
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,599
I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

626
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:56,705
You know,
Epstein wanted to live forever.

627
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,441
He knew he was going to hell.

628
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:03,745
We're already in hell.

629
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:10,452

630
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,365

ADDIE:
Yeah.

632
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,602
Yeah, I'm so fucking tall.

633
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:32,741
I could've been in the NBA.

00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:57,799

You're 26.

Oh, sorry, 25.

I mean,
it's a total paradigm shift.

It's red-pilled a lot of people.

699

00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,356
that would make people feel
like they're being watched.

724
00:45:02,358 --> 00:45:04,792
- Oh my god! I can feel it!
- Oh, stop.

725
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:05,860
I can't, I felt watched

726
00:45:05,862 --> 00:45:06,961
ever since
we left the townhouse.

727
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,362
No one is watching this.

728
00:45:08,364 --> 00:45:09,363
They are!

729
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,772
Noelle, the particle isn't real.

730
00:45:17,774 --> 00:45:19,941
Epstein was a total suit,
all he knew about was pussy,

731
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:21,442
and he just kept those
horny scientists around

732
00:45:21,444 --> 00:45:23,010
to feel smart!

733
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,378
NOELLE: I don't wanna go back
to that fucking apartment.

734
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,880
We don't have to,
we'll go to 66th.

735
00:45:26,783 --> 00:45:27,815
Why?

736
00:45:27,817 --> 00:45:29,183
There's a compound
his brother owns.

737
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:33,621
61st, 66th, 71st.

738
00:45:33,623 --> 00:45:34,856
I don't wanna sound
fucking autistic,

739
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,190
but there's a pattern of five

740
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,859
separating
all of the properties.

741
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,029
A pentagram.

742
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,566
Five points
on a fucking pentagram!

743
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:46,400
Noelle!

744
00:45:49,806 --> 00:45:51,138
I found this in Addie's room.

745
00:45:58,648 --> 00:45:59,680
Holy shit.

746
00:45:59,682 --> 00:46:09,624
(♪♪♪)

747
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,442
PATHETIC CUSTOMER:
My parents are getting divorced,

748
00:46:28,444 --> 00:46:30,411
and I was looking
for a protective crystal

749
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:31,679
that could maybe prevent it?

750
00:46:33,016 --> 00:46:34,615
APOTHECARY CLERK:
Rose crystals, in the back.

751
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:37,184
This? Thank you.

752
00:46:39,022 --> 00:46:40,087
Excuse me.

753
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,589
(Beads twinkling)

754
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:42,490
Excuse us?

755
00:46:45,561 --> 00:46:47,595
Please don't run a muck
in my shop.

756
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:48,496
We're not.

757
00:46:49,799 --> 00:46:51,732
We just have a question.

758
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:53,034
What?

759
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:54,902
Do you know anything
about this card?

760
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:58,439
(Scoffs) We don't practice
that kind of magic here.

761
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:00,908
Isn't this a magic store?

762
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,077
It's a magical apothecary.

763
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:04,278
Okay, so...

764
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,782
So, we don't dabble
in the dark arts here.

765
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:09,083
Neither do we.

766
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:11,085
We just have a question
about a card.

767
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:13,554
If you're persistent
in your quest,

768
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:17,358
your path will reveal
the deepest secrets.

769
00:47:19,262 --> 00:47:22,229
Some secrets, however,
cannot be transmitted,

770
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,466
through the written
or the spoken word.

771
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,567
Right.

772
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:28,235
I have a question
about a product.

773
00:47:28,237 --> 00:47:30,638
I'm not withholding this
from you deliberately.

774
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,342
It's simply a result
of your ignorance and inability

775
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:36,978
to grasp the concepts
and reasoning

776
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,213
required of advanced science.

777
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:43,584
What exactly
are your spiritual goals?

778
00:47:43,586 --> 00:47:44,552
I want answers.

779
00:47:47,623 --> 00:47:50,191
Are you looking for higher
states of consciousness?

780
00:47:54,464 --> 00:47:56,246
Yes.

781
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,031
When the teaching appears,
the student is ready.

782
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:05,039
Okay, well, we found this card...

783
00:48:05,041 --> 00:48:06,607
- Where?
- Our house.

784
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:07,942
Move out.

785
00:48:07,944 --> 00:48:09,276
NOELLE:
Why?

786
00:48:09,278 --> 00:48:11,312
You found that card loose
in your house?

787
00:48:11,314 --> 00:48:15,383
Yeah, and we found this one
in our roommate's bedroom.

788
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:16,784
You're in grave danger.

789
00:48:16,786 --> 00:48:18,219
Can you just tell us
a little bit more about...

790
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:19,553
Absolutely not!

791
00:48:19,555 --> 00:48:22,857
You should leave your house
as soon as possible.

792
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:24,625
But more importantly,

793
00:48:24,627 --> 00:48:27,028
you should leave my shop
immediately.

794
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:31,966
I'm sorry to say,
that your roommate is doomed.

795
00:48:33,302 --> 00:48:35,202
There still might be time
for you.

796
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,637
Doomed?

797
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:39,856
Leave!

798
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:40,840
I'm going to give you
an obsidian crystal

799
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:41,976
for protection.

800
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:48,449
But you must leave, right away.

801
00:48:51,187 --> 00:48:53,054
You don't understand!

802
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,555
You can't stay here!

803
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:05,466
(♪♪♪)

804
00:49:11,074 --> 00:49:12,540
Addie?

805
00:49:12,542 --> 00:49:14,275
THE GIRL: The apartment is
cursed, we can't stay here.

806
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:16,210
We discovered, the townhouse,
the compound,

807
00:49:16,212 --> 00:49:17,411
and this property
are all separated

808
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,180
by five blocks, Addie!

809
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:20,347
Five blocks!

810
00:49:20,349 --> 00:49:23,250
Five points on a pentagram.

811
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,820
That sounds scary.

812
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:27,955
What?

813
00:49:30,626 --> 00:49:32,126
NOELLE:
Addie, are you okay?

814
00:49:32,128 --> 00:49:34,095
THE GIRL:
Why are are you wearing that?

815
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,964
(Kettle whistling)

816
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:43,437
What the fuck is wrong with you?

817
00:49:54,884 --> 00:49:56,450
Don't you get it?
This place is cursed.

818
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:59,987
Oh, it's not so bad.

819
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,957
Once you get used to it.

820
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,392
Well, I'm not getting
used to it.

821
00:50:05,394 --> 00:50:06,727
I'm getting the fuck
out of here.

822
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:10,965
Addie, what's going on?

823
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:17,138
Are you okay?

824
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:20,207
Greg and I got into a fight.

825
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,343
About what?

826
00:50:22,345 --> 00:50:23,844
I don't really know.

827
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:26,647
You don't seem well.

828
00:50:28,618 --> 00:50:29,416
Hey,

829
00:50:31,454 --> 00:50:33,087
did I have any mail?

830
00:50:33,089 --> 00:50:33,888
No.

831
00:50:51,974 --> 00:51:01,916
(♪♪♪)

832
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,967
I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

833
00:51:19,969 --> 00:51:22,503
The only conspiracy,
is the one between the elites,

834
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:24,972
who depend on a permanent
underclass for them to exploit.

835
00:51:24,974 --> 00:51:27,041
She had
the Prince Andrew spoon,

836
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,409
the one that was in my pocket.

837
00:51:28,411 --> 00:51:29,376
What is wrong with her?

838
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:30,411
I don't know!

839
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:32,146
I told you
she's a very sick girl.

840
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:34,848
And she's always been like
into the UK.

841
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,050
Into the UK?

842
00:51:37,253 --> 00:51:39,853
Anglophilia is one thing,
but pedophilia?

843
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:41,589
It's demented,
even by her standards.

844
00:51:41,591 --> 00:51:43,090
This place has bad vibes, man.

845
00:51:43,092 --> 00:51:44,625
I feel fucking cursed
just being here.

846
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:47,228
What kind of fucking
cunt bootlicker

847
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:49,163
is even into the Royals?

848
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:50,564
- The Royal family.
- Jesus Christ!

849
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,446
(Tolling)

850
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,659

00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:58,098

856

(♪♪♪)

857
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,720
NOELLE:
what happened in there?

858
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:00,921
THE GIRL:
We'll never know.

859
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,091
NOELLE:
The cameras malfunctioned.

860
00:55:04,093 --> 00:55:05,526
THE GIRL: That's what
they want you to think.

861
00:55:07,396 --> 00:55:08,595
I'm scared.

862
00:55:09,732 --> 00:55:10,531
Me too.

863
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,100
If they get to him in there?

864
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,168
They can do anything!

865
00:55:16,138 --> 00:55:18,038
I think maybe we're starting

866
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:19,440
to get too close to the truth.

867
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:27,314
Oh my god.

868
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:29,950
Is that your roommate?

869
00:55:31,654 --> 00:55:33,120
Why is she dressed like that?

870
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,827
Is she fucking following us?

871
00:55:48,737 --> 00:55:49,670
Is there someone we can call?

872
00:55:49,672 --> 00:55:51,171
Someone in her family?

873
00:55:51,173 --> 00:55:53,307
No, her mom's on some
goddamn Klonopin,

874
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:54,575
she doesn't know left
from right.

875
00:55:54,577 --> 00:55:56,310
- What about her dad?
- He's a pedophile!

876
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:57,811
Jesus Christ.

877
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:59,580
(Scoffs)
Should we call Greg?

878
00:55:59,582 --> 00:56:01,281
- Who's Greg?
- Her boyfriend.

879
00:56:01,283 --> 00:56:02,583
I thought that guy was gay.

880
00:56:02,585 --> 00:56:03,383
He is.

881
00:56:09,124 --> 00:56:10,306
Oh my God.

882
00:56:10,308 --> 00:56:11,491
It's Ghislaine,
Ghislaine Maxwell.

885
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,479
What are you guys doing here?

886
00:56:32,481 --> 00:56:33,981
What's going on with Addie?

887
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:35,048
I don't know, you're the ones
who live with her.

888
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:36,650
Don't be cheeky,
you fucking cock!

889
00:56:36,652 --> 00:56:38,886
Noelle, I told you not
to call me a cock anymore.

890
00:56:38,888 --> 00:56:40,988
- Have you seen her lately?
- No.

891
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:42,656
She said you guys
got in a fight.

892
00:56:42,658 --> 00:56:44,224
It wasn't really a fight.

893
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:45,125
Well, what happened?

894
00:56:46,462 --> 00:56:47,494
I don't know, I don't really
want to get into it.

895
00:56:47,496 --> 00:56:48,328
It was weird.

896
00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:49,563
Spill it, faggot.

897
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,999
Normal, pathetic
Addie weird, or like satanic?

898
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,534
I wouldn't know
if something was satanic.

899
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,401
Just get to the point.

900
00:56:54,403 --> 00:56:55,435
I'm not a fucking satanist.

901
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:57,371
What happened?

902
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:58,639
(Sighs) All right.

903
00:56:59,842 --> 00:57:02,009
We were having sex,

904
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,044
and she started saying
that we were on a plane.

905
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,178
THE GIRL:
What kind of plane?

906
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,080
A Boeing.

907
00:57:07,082 --> 00:57:09,416
And look,
we don't normally like talk

908
00:57:09,418 --> 00:57:11,618
when we're fucking,
we're pretty vanilla.

909
00:57:13,355 --> 00:57:15,889
And then she told me
to fuck her like she was 13.

910
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,760
And so I freaked out.

911
00:57:19,762 --> 00:57:22,095
I didn't mean to yell,
but I'm not into like,

912
00:57:22,097 --> 00:57:24,231
pedophile role play shit.

913
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:27,000
I didn't mean to scare her,

914
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:28,769
but she was pretending
like she didn't even know

915
00:57:28,771 --> 00:57:30,704
what the fuck
I was talking about.

916
00:57:30,706 --> 00:57:32,372
I don't know, maybe
she was like embarrassed or...

917
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:34,007
GREG'S BOSS:
Greg!

918
00:57:34,009 --> 00:57:36,009
I said no more girlfriend
at work.

919
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:37,578
We're customers,
we're buying a fucking box!

920
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,212
GREG'S BOSS: You're not customer,
you're not customer, bye.

921
00:57:39,214 --> 00:57:40,847
Go play, go to Peewee Herman's
Playhouse

922
00:57:40,849 --> 00:57:42,082
and play with
the other children, bye.

923
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,750
- Please, just go.
- Sorry, I'm very sorry, sir.

924
00:57:45,054 --> 00:57:46,186
I'm very sorry.

925
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:56,463
(Oil sizzling)

926
00:57:56,465 --> 00:57:59,766
So the ton of sword symbolizes
betrayal, painful ends,

927
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:01,969
crisis, loss, wounds.

928
00:58:01,971 --> 00:58:02,936
NOELLE:
Betrayal?

929
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,306
- Painful ends.
- Right.

930
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:14,982
I think your roommate
is a victim of CIA mind control.

931
00:58:15,985 --> 00:58:17,884
Have you heard of MK Ultra?

932
00:58:17,886 --> 00:58:19,453
Most of the files are destroyed
by the government,

933
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,488
obviously, but she's exhibiting
all the symptoms.

934
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,156
She's completely depersonalized.

935
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:24,625
It's obviously gotten to her.

936
00:58:24,627 --> 00:58:25,826
What are you getting at?

937
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,796
She's not like us, Noelle.

938
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:32,165
She's a liability.

939
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,533
What do you mean?

940
00:58:34,937 --> 00:58:36,136
I mean,
we have to get rid of her.

941
00:58:38,173 --> 00:58:39,740
Get rid of her?

942
00:58:39,742 --> 00:58:41,108
She's weak psychologically,
that's why they targeted her!

943
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:41,942
NOELLE (Overlapping):
You wanna kill my roommate?

944
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:43,310
Sort of how you targeted me!

945
00:58:44,747 --> 00:58:45,979
What?

946
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,180
How do I know that
you've been gotten to you?

947
00:58:47,182 --> 00:58:48,582
- You know me, Noelle.
- No, I don't!

948
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,952
You know that
I was trying to...

949
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:53,286
Trying what?

950
00:58:53,288 --> 00:58:54,521
Trying to warn me?

951
00:58:54,523 --> 00:58:55,856
- All I wanted was the truth.
- NOELLE: Uh-huh.

952
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:57,090
That's all I ever wanted.

953
00:58:57,092 --> 00:58:58,792
And you were willing
to do whatever it takes.

954
00:58:58,794 --> 00:58:59,826
THE GIRL:
Of course.

955
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,361
You don't care
if people get hurt.

956
00:59:01,363 --> 00:59:02,763
You don't care what happens
to anyone, not even yourself!

957
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:06,333
I'm selflessly focused,
but I would never hurt you.

958
00:59:06,335 --> 00:59:07,934
I don't even know your name!

959
00:59:07,936 --> 00:59:09,269
You're just some fucking
meth head

960
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:10,470
who showed up
on my doorstep,

961
00:59:10,472 --> 00:59:12,639
and decided to rip
my life apart!

962
00:59:12,641 --> 00:59:14,608
I was trying to warn you
about the apartment.

963
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:15,876
I didn't want to be involved.

964
00:59:15,878 --> 00:59:17,177
I didn't have a choice.

965
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:27,120

966
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:31,858

968
01:00:47,402 --> 01:00:48,201

It's done.

988

How you feel?

989
01:07:40,448 --> 01:07:41,447
Young.

990

1000
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,964
your roommate tried to kill me!

1001
01:09:41,436 --> 01:09:43,269
