JIMMY GUTRO: Oh, no Smiley.

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,051
Come on man it's too early.

00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,636
SMILEY: I don't
whistle while I work

00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,971
I'll be old before my time.

00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,430
That ain't whistling.

00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,892

FEMALE VOICE 2: Morning Matt.

00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,625
Morning.

00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,500
Morning everybody.

FEMALE VOICE 3: Morning sir.

00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,920
Pomerance built in blues.

00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,797
I was to sink the
foundation under 12 feet.

00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,674
CO-WORKER 1: I thought
those were already a code.

00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,636
They are, I want them deeper.

00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,512
You head him.

00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,889
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Matt, what do I

00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,683
tell Richard Friedman
about his whole six results

00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,810
from Tennessee?

00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,979
Tell him it isn't
nickel and I'll

00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,981
have a full assay next week.

00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,524
WOMAN ON INTERCOM: OK.

00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,692
What's this?

00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,111
CO-WORKER 1: It's from the
freeway on ramp construction.

00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,780
One of the engineers found it.

00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,115
Take a whiff.

00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,533
By the freeway on ramp.

00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,576
Yeah.

00:04:07,538 --> 00:05:00,842
[harmonica]

00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,552
Oh my god.

00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,525
Smiley?

00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,823
Don't mess with me man.

00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:24,699
What's going on?

00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,993
Smiley, are you all right?

00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,004
Oh god.

00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,495
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Of course.

00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,414
We've got 26 parades over
the next four days Henry.

00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,334
Which one are you talking about?

00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,796
Oh, I'm sure that
can be arranged.

00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,923
Yes, but I'm going to
want a free liposuction

00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,634
and face lift when I'm 50.

00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,635
I'll get them over to you.

00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,011
All right, bye.
Good morning.

00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,304
ASSISTANT: Morning.

00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,515
Can you make sure that two
mayor's stand passes for Mardi

00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,310
Gras get over to Dr. Henry
Dumond for Mardi Gras

00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,605
day and make sure that the
seats are close to the mayor.

00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:38,773
He's a very big contributor.

00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,066
ASSISTANT: The mayor
wants to see you.

00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,109
OK.

00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,783
Morning, Anthony.

00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,327
ANTHONY: Hi.

00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,205
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: Allison,
there has been a tunnel

00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,665
collapse at Deveaux Park.

00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,707
There's a worker missing.

00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,126
I want you out
there supervising.

00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,086
Call me as soon as
you know anything

00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,171
and get press secretary
Regan out there too.

00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,674
The news crews have
already been all over it.

00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,986
Oh good they found you.

00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,866
Good god.

00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,998
GEORGE REGAN: This is
the last the Mayor needs.

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,666
This is last
thing anybody needs.

00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,792
Did they find the worker?

00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,043
No, they're not going
to find him alive.

00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,170
I can promise you that.

00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,213
NEWS REPORTER: Mr.
Reagan, Ms. Beauchamp.

00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,089
I'll handle this.

00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,257
I'm gonna call the Mayor.

00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,550
NEWS REPORTER: Can you
give us any details?

00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,427
Yes, I can.
Let's step over here.

00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,099
Oh, Cindy.

00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,643
NEWS REPORTER: I'm here
at Deveaux Park with city

00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,562
press secretary George Regan.

00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,063
What details can you
give us at this point?

00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,274
All we know right now Donna
is that one of the city's

00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,611
large drainage tunnels collapsed
due to ground subsidence

00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,528
below it.

00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,905
There's a worker
trapped in the rubble

00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,282
and city rescue teams are
searching for him now.

00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,077
We're just hoping and
praying that he's all right.

00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,336
Let's see what we got here.

00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,383
A lot of organic
carbon for a high temp.

00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,010
Yeah, maybe from
that peep burning

00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,303
last summer out in the marshes.

00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,804
MATT ANDREWS: Maybe, what's
it doing by the freeway?

00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,725
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Matt, Allison line one.

00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,684
Yeah.

00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:42,480
Hi, I'm at an emergency
and I cannot leave.

00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,733
I'm supposed to pick Cindy up
at the airport in half an hour.

00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,443
I promised member I'd
pick her up myself.

00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,694
Can you pick her up for me?

00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,987
Nope, I can't.
I got a 12 o'clock.

00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,739
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Oh,
would you please, Matt?

00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,823
Would you please?

00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,951
All right, all right.

00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,077
What's the flight?

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,579
Trans-regional flight 1715.

00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,497
OK.

00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,249
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP:
I'll call you in a bit.

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,250
Yup.

00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,004
I got to take off for a bit.

00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,465
Jimmy, what can
I tell the Mayor?

00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,175
I've never seen
anything like it.

00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,469
It's got to be 40, 50 feet.

00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,720
Some kind of sinkhole.

00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,181
And is that his wife?

00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,975
JIMMY GUTRO: Yeah, it is.

00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,351
She's all broken up.

00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,727
I'll be around if you need me.

00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,278
Mrs. Smiley, I'm
Allison Beauchamp.

00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,487
I'm from the Mayor's office.

00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,989
I just want you to know
we're doing everything

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,408
that we can to find him.

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,951
Everything, OK?

00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,919
MALE VOICE: We found him.

00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,499
Mrs. Smiley.

00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,917
No, no, no, no.

00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,544
Please, please, no.

00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:37,553
[crying]

00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,513
SMILEY'S DAUGHTER:
My daddy's dead.

00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:55,946
GREETER: Hi, hi, hi.

00:10:55,988 --> 00:11:02,703
CINDY EVERS: Matt, hi.

00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,829
Cindy.

00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,664
Yeah.

00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,374
Oh my gosh.

00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,210
I haven't seen you
since you were a--

00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,003
I got my haircut.

00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,088
Yes, you did.

00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,964
Wow you look great.

00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,509
Thanks, so do you.

00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,426
Where's aunt Allison?

00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,511
She had an emergency.

00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,387
Let me take that.

00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,472
We're gonna go meet her.

00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,140
How was your flight?

00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,225
It was great.

00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,267
Jeez.

00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,061
She's It's so good to see you.
MATT ANDREWS: You too.

00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,856
[phone ringing]

00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,358
Hi, mom.

00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,784
Please stop with the cameras.

00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,120
Would you move back please?

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,712
GEORGE REGAN: What will
they fill this up with?

00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,629
Concrete I imagine.

00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,922
How fast can that be done?

00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,549
Engineer is gonna
need to investigate.

00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,259
A hole that size
just isn't normal.

00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,677
Be careful.

00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,469
It's Mardi Gras.

00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,846
Nothing is ever normal.

00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,014
We've got to keep
everyone away from here.

00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,224
We'll be securing the area.

00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,810
Just keep the news crews
as far back as you can.

00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,061
People are here for Mardi Gras.

00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,188
There's more than enough
spectacle without a media

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,356
circus over this.

00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,813
Can you just park here?

00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,024
You can if you
have one of these.

00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,484
Contract with the city.

00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,194
We have them at
some of their sites.

00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,322
See what kind of ground
they're building on.

00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,157
It's not as exciting
as field work,

00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,825
but it's hell of a
lot cleaner and safer.

00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,951
I can tell you that.

00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,244
CINDY EVERS: Are you
still doing any mining?

00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,121
No I sold my shares
to Angel Valley.

00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,333
Now I just tell other
people what they found.

00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,418
CINDY EVERS: Oh my good.

00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,461
Look at all this.

00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,713
I've been back here
since we moved away.

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,553
Thank you.

00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,805
There you go.

00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,306
I haven't had any
of these in forever.

00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,351
I remember all just buying,
and selling, and trading them.

00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,603
Well you know they throw
50 million of those a year?

00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,689
Mom would never let us come
down here cause all the women

00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,774
bearing themselves for beads.

00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,025
Yeah, well we
better be careful

00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,193
or Allison's going
to wonder what

00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,778
you did to get those beads.

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,862
There she is.

00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:46,033
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: That
cannot be my favorite niece.

00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,535
Oh, look at you.

00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,578
Holy cow, is this what
a year in Italy does?

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,497
Mom says I remind her of you.

00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,374
Oh, well she's flattering me.

00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,708
She must want something.

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,626
She misses you.

00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,919
She doesn't like
being so far away.

00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,379
Don't you tell her I said that.
- No, of course.

00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,463
I'll use it as ammunition.

00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,090
I hear your dads
assignment went well.

00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,258
Yeah, how's you new job?

00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,386
Well it's better
than practicing law,

00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,013
but today was not a good day.

00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,014
Doesn't matter come on.

00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,391
I finagled us a
place at Madam El's.

00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,433
What's Madam El's?

00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,185
MATT AND ALLISON:
What's Madam El's?

00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,201
This is where I met Allison.

00:14:29,243 --> 00:15:40,564
[music playing]

00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,274
Who is he?

00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,445
You don't even recognize him?

00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,323
You used to play with
him when you lived here.

00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,826
You took a bath
with him at my house

00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,286
when you were three years old.

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,663
CINDY EVERS: Dalton Tramble?

00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,207
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Yes, I ran
into his parents the other day

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,793
and he was asking about you
and I told him we'd stop by.

00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,128
He's gorgeous.

00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,424
ELDERLY WOMAN: Hey, you
have a spectacular butt.

00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,718
Come on, let's dance.

00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,269
[phone ringing]

00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,146
Are you expecting someone?

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,649
It's probably mom
checking up on me.

00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,817
Wait, wait.

00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,943
Let me.

00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,657
Madeleine, hi.

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,076
How are you?

00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,453
I'm fine.

00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,873
No, Cindy I haven't seen
her since she landed.

00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,126
No, I think she said she was
going down to Bourbon street

00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:45,879
to lift her shirt for beads.

00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,465
Madeline, she's right here.

00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,633
Cut her some slack.

00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,467
She's 18.

00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,219
She's on vacation.

00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,971
No, she's not going
to leave the phone on.

00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,348
She'll call you if
anything good happens.

00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,851
Say hi to Norm.

00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,186
You are incredible.

00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,396
You have good parents.

00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,023
I think they've just
been married too

00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,650
long to remember what fun is.

00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:10,696
So do you think you guys
are gonna get married?

00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,158
Well, that's the $64,000
question, isn't it?

00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,537
I guess the answer
is I'd like to.

00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,247
You don't think Matt wants to?

00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,665
No, I think he does.

00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,792
He just needs more time.

00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,003
CINDY EVERS: Guys have
been together for as long

00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,171
as I can remember.

00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,839
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Yup,
we're going on seven years.

00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,050
Do you talk about it?

00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,052
Probably not as
much as we should.

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,185
MATT ANDREWS: Thank you.

00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,311
Thank you.

00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,822
Oh, I needed this.

00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,532
Good day, huh?

00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:59,912
Never forget the look
on that woman's face.

00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,663
I can't imagine losing
someone like that.

00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,582
Do they know what
caused the collapse?

00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,708
Some kind of sinkhole.

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,834
Oh, is wasn't a sinkhole.

00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,336
You need limestone
for a sinkhole.

00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,047
We got heat, mud,
and clay back here.

00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,964
That's it.

00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,801
Well, whatever it
was it was awful.

00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,968
I'm glad it's over.

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,178
Here everyone's health.

00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,850
So you'll dance
with other women,

00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,019
but you won't dance with me?

00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,104
Let's go.

00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,165
MOTHER: So how was
your piano class?

00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,166
DAUGHTER: Very good.

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,417
And did you learn
any new songs.

00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:48,752
Hey, diddle diddle.

00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,462
- Oh, I love that one.
- I know.

00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,505
That's great.

00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,840
We'll have to practice
when we get home, OK?

00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:53,757
- Yup, I can't wait.
- In you get.

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,675
Buckle up.

00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,392
OK, is that thing
sticking again?

00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,393
No, I got it.

00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,435
Good.

00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,955
My seat belt.

00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:29,042
Come on, you got to push.

00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:36,049
Mommy, mommy.

00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,217
It's OK.

00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,182
Up you get.

00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:51,148
OK, go, go.

00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,907
[car alarm]

00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:07,706
[music playing]

00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,584
[phone ringing]

00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,337
Allison, your phone.

00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,303
Allison Beauchamp.

00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,429
Beauchamp.

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,197
REPORTER: Do you know if this
has any connection to today's

00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,281
tragedy in Deveaux Park

00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,449
GEORGE REGAN: Well,
it's early to say,

00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,575
but we don't believe it does.

00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,743
No, right now
we're just thankful

00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,994
that there were no
serious injuries

00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,871
and obviously that's
our primary concern.

00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,539
I will keep you posted
as things develop.

00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,791
You can be assured of that.

00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,513
Something been burning?

00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,931
WORKER: Not that I know of.

00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,266
I got a rock in my office.

00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,103
Smells exactly the same way
from down by the freeway.

00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,063
Find anything like when
the tower collapsed?

00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,983
No, why do you think
there's some relation?

00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:21,029
Well, it could be a broken
water main or drainage pipe

00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,699
cause that.

00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,075
That's two holes
are miles apart.

00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,787
That'd be a coincidence.

00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,706
Try Jesse Snow over
at the university.

00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:31,832
No, I called.

00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,543
He's at a conference in China.

00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,670
Well, how about Chako John?

00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:37,754
He's there too.

00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,881
Now Matt, you've got
a contract with us.

00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,216
No, no, no, no.

00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,052
Not for this kind of
field work, Frank.

00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:44,970
I'm a lab nerd now.

00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,556
I'll send you out that rock.

00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:01,486
REPORTER: For the second time
in 24 hours [inaudible] has been

00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,738
struck by what appears to be--

00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,449
I thought sinkholes only
occurred in limestone.

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,658
Yeah, so did I.

00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,868
What's going on?

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,996
Oh, looking for somebody
to head up an investigation.

00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,913
Why can't you?

00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,998
MATT ANDREWS: It's
not what I do.

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,250
Yeah, it is what you do.

00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,211
Not anymore.

00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,756
Well, so who are
they going to get?

00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,174
Frank will get somebody.

00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,218
I think they need
somebody right away.

00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,637
If you won't do it for
Frank, will you do it for me?

00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,058
No thanks.

00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,226
There are two million
people in town Matt.

00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,394
This is my responsibility.

00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,645
It's not your responsibility.

00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,315
Yes, public works is a
department that I oversee.

00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:41,610
If there is a connection between
that tunnel collapse downtown

00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,945
and this huge hole,
then I need to know

00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,198
it's not going to happen
again and jeopardize

00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,324
all those people.

00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,995
I like this job.

00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
I want to do it
well and keep it.

00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,583
GEORGE REGAN: Call me
at my office, Donna.

00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,502
At my office, at my office.

00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,670
Thank you.

00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,673
Matt, I've been
telling the vultures

00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,133
that we don't think
this is connected

00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,009
to that tunnel collapse.

00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,344
Please tell me that's true.

00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:10,180
Is that a political or a
geological opinion, George?

00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,849
I was hoping somebody
like you could make it both.

00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,733
MATT ANDREWS: I'll let
you know what I find.

00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,944
GEORGE REGAN: All
right, good night.

00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,865
All right, I'll talk to Frank.

00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,409
I'll see you when I get home.

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,743
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Thank you.

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,419
Tomorrow I promise
we'll be way more fun.

00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,337
CINDY EVERS: Look if you
need to work I'm fine.

00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,422
I don't, I don't.

00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,298
In fact, I have a very
special appointment

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,425
tomorrow at 11 o'clock.

00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,426
It's a surprise.

00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,094
We should go home
and get some sleep.

00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,455
JIMMY GUTRO: What exactly
is it we're looking for?

00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,832
Remember this?

00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,667
Exactly what was
in the other hole.

00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,179
CINDY EVERS: What is this?

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,054
Oh my god.

00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,306
That's Ken Gordon Jr.

00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,515
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: I know.

00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,601
You Cindy Evers are going
to be on the main float

00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,854
of the dying geese's crew
parade on Mardi Gras eve.

00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:45,066
Ken Gordon Jr. and
Dalton Tramble.

00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,984
DALTON: Hey.

00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,902
There he is.

00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,403
Wow, you look incredible.

00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,237
Really?

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,447
Yes, really.

00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,075
Am I totally ridiculous or what?

00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:54,951
Not totally.

00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,203
Yeah, great thanks.

00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,205
They're not sure if I'm supposed
to be Gabriel, or Raphael,

00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,748
or one of those other guys.

00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:00,665
MAN VOICE: Hey, Dalton.

00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,791
I'm coming just a minute.

00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,543
Hey listen, tonight's
the only night I'm

00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:04,753
playing while you're in town.

00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,713
Thought if you don't
already have plans maybe

00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,840
we could get together.

00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,550
You like jazz?

00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,384
Yeah.

00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,969
Yeah, I'll take
you to real stuff.

00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,387
Places even Allison
doesn't know.

00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,263
What?

00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,890
- I'll pick you up at eight, OK?
- Great.

00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:17,891
Bye.

00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,686
Let's get you to that fitting.

00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,616
How far?

00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,034
WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Matt.

00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,577
Hang on, yeah.

00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,663
WOMAN ON INTERCOM: Allison
and her niece are here.

00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,706
Send them down.

00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,503
Hank, give me the
address of the smoke.

00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:53,510
OK, all right, OK.

00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,594
Thanks Hanks.

00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,056
Hey, come here.

00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,811
Sorry to put the
brakes on your day.

00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:03,937
That's OK.
What's up?

00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,856
I've got something
I want you to see.

00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,733
OK, now a normal
sinkhole forms went

00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,987
underground water dissolves
limestone leaves space.

00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,530
Right, water recedes.

00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,117
Sometimes that space is so big
it can't support its own roof.

00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,452
Roof collapses,
you got a sinkhole.

00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,080
Right, it can
sometimes be a couple

00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:26,001
of yards across or a couple
of hundred yards across.

00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,544
Oh my god.

00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,587
And deep.

00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,883
OK, now New Orleans sits on
layer of silt, a layer of peat,

00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,010
and layer clay.

00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,219
Last summer it was
abnormally hot.

00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,972
We had two big peat
fires here and here

00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,515
where these red X's are.

00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,143
OK, now the fire was
contained to the naked eye,

00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,227
but peats weird.

00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,855
It can smolder
underground indefinitely.

00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,607
In the fall, where
these blue is are

00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,610
we had 16 reports of smoke
coming up from small cracks

00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,777
in the ground.

00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,071
But these look like they're
miles from the peat fires.

00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,448
MATT ANDREWS: Oh, they are.

00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,492
When public works investigated
they couldn't find anything

00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,162
because the smoldering
had moved on and frankly

00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,288
they didn't look deep.

00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,873
Because if they had they
would have found caverns

00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,207
and channels of burn out.

00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
When the torrential rains came
through in the wintertime,

00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,297
it washed through
these spaces that

00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,424
eroded the silt and the clay.

00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,886
Water disappears you
got big empty spaces

00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,137
equivalent to sink holes.

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,224
Where are the two
sinkholes on this map?

00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,727
MATT ANDREWS: Here and here.

00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,854
The ones that have opened up.

00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,898
Others they could be
anywhere under the city.

00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,067
And they can just
collapse like these ones

00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,026
without any warning?

00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,903
Terrain is exactly the same.

00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:38,114
You'd have to be a fool
to think it wouldn't.

00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,244
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE:
So what're you saying?

00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,080
One of those floats down
there could drop into one

00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,247
of these holes at any second?

00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,041
MATT ANDREWS: That's
a possibility, yes.

00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,293
You got two million
people extra in this city

00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,753
on a pound per
square foot basis.

00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,797
That's a lot of extra
stress, especially

00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,090
in the French Quarter.

00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,466
GEORGE REGAN: People have been
crowding the parades in quarter

00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,592
for over a week already.

00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,469
You got two hoes that
opened up in 24 hours.

00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,887
Surely we can
wait three more days

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,180
until the end of Mardi Gras.

00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,099
Look you don't know if
you got an hour or a century

00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,392
with whats down there.

00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,893
SPEAKER 1: I don't think that
this poses a serious threat,

00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,395
I really don't.
- How do we find this out?

00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,854
I want to sweep the city
with ground penetrating radar.

00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,106
I want to do some
resistivity tests.

00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,399
SPEAKER 1: You can't
sweep the city.

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,983
We don't have near the
equipment for that.

00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:14,984
SAM: Exactly.

00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,069
SPEAKER 1: Even if
we did, we wouldn't

00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,362
be done until Christmas.

00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:21,574
Look Matt, we are talking urban
terrain here, pavement, pipe.

00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,951
We got 90 miles of drainage too.

00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,411
Don't worry about
the equipment.

00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,453
I can get that.

00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,539
John, under the French
Quarter parade route

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,332
there's drainage tunnels.
I can go in.

00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,459
Then I can map the
rest from the street.

00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,628
In the meantime until
we know what's down there?

00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,880
Close down the areas
with the greatest stress.

00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,341
[interposing voices]

00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,385
SAM: This is Mardi Gras.

00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,220
Fat Tuesday, that
means you can't have it

00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:45,014
on a Wednesday, or a
Friday, and you certainly

00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,641
can't not have it at all.

00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,269
You know I mean Mardi
Gras is New Orleans.

00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,979
It is the French Quarter.

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,313
People come from miles around.

00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,356
You know what?

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,650
They booked their hotel
rooms a year in advance.

00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,903
You can't get a flight in
or out of the city for days.

00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,113
We have a riot on our hands.

00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,031
Well Sam, you might
have a bigger problem

00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,116
than that on your hands.

00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,200
GEORGE REGAN: OK, OK.

00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,411
I think we've heard
what Matt has to say

00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,581
and I think we
should talk it over.

00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,430
MATT ANDREWS: Excuse me.

00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:31,936
Wait, I think Matt should
get whatever equipment and men

00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,523
he needs, and get down there and
find out what's going on now.

00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,150
I think that's a good idea.

00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,276
Thank you, John.

00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,616
GEORGE REGAN: With all
due respect to Allison,

00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,327
Matt's reputation is that
he's been a bit gun shy,

00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,497
a bit overcautious since his
Angel Valley mining collapse.

00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,665
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: It
wasn't his mining collapse.

00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,709
He was absolved of all
responsibility in that.

00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,127
GEORGE REGAN: Oh,
I know, but I've

00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,756
heard it's taken a toll on
him in all areas of his life

00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,592
and I think we should consider
if that's having some effect

00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,635
here now.

00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,307
Look you asked for
his professional advice

00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,350
and he gave it to us.

00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,476
I think we should
accept it for what

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,520
it's worth, which is a lot.

00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,192
And I guess you're in the
best position to assess that.

00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,823
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: OK
gentlemen, I'm supposed

00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,074
to be judging this parade.

00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,492
Allison, I want you to
talk to the city department

00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,785
heads, and the Mardi
Gras committee,

00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,453
and come up with a
recommendation by noon

00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,081
tomorrow, and that's the
recommendation I will take.

00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,610
What'd you find?

00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,154
REMY: We're not seeing anything
out of the ordinary here, Matt.

00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,073
Any spaces we have the
roofs seem totally in tact

00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,742
and any surface
crack we found seem

00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,911
to have been there for years.

00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,704
Come on.

00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,081
There's more I want to check.

00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,299
CO-WORKER 2: We thought you said
keep going over to L5, Matt.

00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,343
MATT ANDREWS: No,
that's not what I said.

00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,552
I said, Larry and Hal go to L5.

00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:13,014
The rest you guys go straight.
What do you got?

00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,973
It's stable.

00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,350
Nothing.

00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,643
All right, let's go east.

00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,602
What's that quarter?

00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,728
That was L3.

00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,739
MATT ANDREWS: Give me a hand.

00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,462
MARCELLUS: Hey, Dr. Geology.

00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,797
Hey, Marcellus.

00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,757
I don't here no
harmonica playing coming

00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,008
up through the vents no more.

00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,469
They say Smiley got killed
over at Deveaux Park,

00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,972
but now I see men coming
out of man holes everywhere.

00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,014
What's going on man?

00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,432
Just making sure
everything's safe.

00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,977
I've been playing these
streets all my life man.

00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,729
You're gonna tell me if there's
somewhere I shouldn't be,

00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:02,689
ain't you?

00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,649
I'll let you know
when I know, Marcellus.

00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,067
You the man.

00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,529
Nothing.

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,906
Nothing, let's move east.

00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,324
GEORGE REGAN: We're
confident there's

00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,826
nothing to threaten
anyone's safety

00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,995
or disrupt any festivities.

00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,538
When we know more
we'll let you know.

00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,456
Until that time I have
no further comment.

00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,249
Thank you.

00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,500
Thank you very much.

00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,543
Thank you.

00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,220
What's up?

00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,097
JIMMY GUTRO: I'm
looking for Al or Matt.

00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,181
GEORGE REGAN: Al's down below.

00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,683
Matt's off doing
surveys all night.

00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,726
What do you need?

00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:40,893
JIMMY GUTRO: It's
the French Quarter.

00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,687
Look, this is pavement.

00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,022
This is the building foundation.

00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,940
This store owner who took it
said it happened yesterday.

00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,858
It's all in the report.

00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,026
I'll get those down to Al.

00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,152
JIMMY GUTRO: You'll
give them to him?

00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:49,986
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:50,862
All right.

00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,724
Oh, you scared me.

00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,436
Sorry I guess it's
just you and me.

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,022
I'm just looking over
these evacuation studies.

00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,482
GEORGE REGAN: I was
just on my way out.

00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,983
I thought you might want
to take a look at this.

00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,110
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: What is it?

00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,236
It's about Pete.

00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,904
It says that air pockets,
sometimes big ones,

00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,864
are pretty common and
don't usually prejudice

00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,907
the ground above them.

00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,450
It says burnings common too.

00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,452
But not for marsh
fires miles away, but

00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,913
from spontaneous combustion.

00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,707
It also says that radar
stuff Matt was talking about

00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,459
is only so reliable
on city terrain.

00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,044
Where did you get this?

00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,420
GEORGE REGAN: Public works.

00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,131
Spent the afternoon
with the engineers.

00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,883
Why wasn't I given
it immediately?

00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,426
They just got it to me.

00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,681
The kind of disaster
Matt's talking about

00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,516
would be terrible.

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,476
Engineers think that the
possibility of anything

00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,396
happening at all is
remote, much less

00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,564
before the end of Mardi Gras.

00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,399
And is that a chance
you want to take?

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,151
Absolutely not.

00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,819
I don't think we should
jump the gun the other way.

00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:57,947
I mean we're talking about a
huge social and economic impact

00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,073
here.

00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,409
Our guests spend close to a
billion dollars in two weeks.

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,037
If we interrupt Mardi Gras
without a damn good reason,

00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,206
well that can be very
bad come election time.

00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:15,006
I'd hate to see us flush
that down some abyss

00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,340
that might not even exist.

00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,349
Anyway, let me know
if you need anything.

00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,310
Good night.

00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,020
Good night.

00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,201
WOMAN ON INTERCOM:
Matt, Allison wants

00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,661
you to call as soon as you've
correlated the results.

00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,999
Did you get that, Matt?

00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,435
Get two beers.

00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:10,353
Coke.

00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,230
BARTENDER: Coming right up.

00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,942
CINDY EVERS: Thank you.

00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,068
DALTON: Thanks.

00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:29,872
Oh, I got something to show you.

00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,250
Where did you get this?

00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,125
Look at my hair.

00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,544
I took it years ago.

00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,171
And you've had
it this whole time?

00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,089
Yeah.

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,424
Really?

00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,344
I never even thought
you noticed me.

00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,971
I used to do things
so that you would.

00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,181
Like what?

00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,059
Twisting my ankle outside
of Laforge's garage.

00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,769
I knew that wasn't real.

00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,897
I for sure, oh man.

00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,691
Do you want to go
down to a table?

00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,692
Yeah.

00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,542
PSYCHIC: Hold on tight.

00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,924
Voodoo.

00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,259
Really creepy, huh?

00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,308
You OK?

00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:31,309
Yeah.

00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,399
MATT ANDREWS: OK, this is much
as I can map from the tunnels

00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,525
and the streets.

00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,861
All right, the burning comes
in this way and this way

00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,945
from the marshes.

00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,864
All right, the peats
pockmark with channels.

00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,866
They converge they
slope this way.

00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:50,745
To me that says there's
a large hole right here.

00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,789
Somewhere in the French
Quarter, under the Canal Street,

00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,416
parade route.
It's right here.

00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,251
I can't pinpoint it with
the equipment I got.

00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,085
It's too deep.

00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,295
How long till it collapses?

00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,172
MATT ANDREWS: That's
impossible to say, Ally.

00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,173
I don't know.

00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,341
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP:
More than three days?

00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,592
Three centuries.

00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,135
I've got to do some
further exploring.

00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,219
I don't know.

00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,306
Well there must be
some signs that we'd see.

00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,391
What do you want
to crack pavement?

00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,144
You want a building
slipping off its foundation?

00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,187
It's a sinkhole.

00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,063
It's catastrophic.

00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,439
When it goes it caves in.

00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,691
All right, we're
below sea level here.

00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,860
The levee ruptures, you
know what's going to happen?

00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,779
Matt, I need--

00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,697
there has to be
some way to know.

00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,658
Well, I'm gonna
certify it class four.

00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,160
What is class four?

00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,038
Unsafe till
further exploration.

00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,878
Well, the Mardi Gras
committee and the city council

00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,464
meet first thing in the morning,
and I need as much information

00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,340
as possible then.

00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,883
I'll bring it home later.

00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,157
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: Yes.

00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,117
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: We just
finished up 10 minutes ago.

00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,078
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: I heard
the meeting was lively.

00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,747
That's an understatement.

00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,791
My recommendation.

00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,836
You want to tell
me what it is?

00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,296
Based on everything
I've reviewed,

00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,382
I think we should go ahead
with Mardi Gras as planned.

00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,968
If anything changes
that I'll let you know.

00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,011
Good.

00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,203
REMY: What the hell?

00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,954
They sealed it up with concrete.

00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,331
Who authorized this?

00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,762
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: They
don't dispute your data.

00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:55,930
It's your interpretation.

00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,932
My interpretation,
well that's the safest

00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,141
thing under the circumstances.

00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,602
Wait a second, you asked
me to come on board.

00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,229
I thought it was
because you trusted me.

00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,396
I do trust you.

00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,106
Then why are those holes
filled with cement because I

00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,191
need them for my investigation.

00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,317
They're a public hazard.

00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,319
Public hazards downtown, Ally.

00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,113
Matt, the guy's
in engineering think

00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,782
you're being too cautious.

00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,242
They said that
your own data shows

00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,494
that the roofs of the caverns
are strong enough to hold--

00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,038
The roofs of the caverns
I know about are fine.

00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,456
It's the ones I
don't know about.

00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,000
You got two million people
down there jumping up and down.

00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,002
It's probably disintegrating
right now as we speak.

00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,170
But you don't know that honey.

00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,129
I don't know that.

00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,589
I don't know how big they are.

00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,966
I don't know how deep it is.

00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,884
I don't know what's down
there under the parade

00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,052
route and the quarter.

00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,971
It's a geological anomaly, Ally.

00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,180
Nobody knows anything.

00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,516
When nobody knows anything,
there's no such thing

00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,642
as being too cautious.

00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,810
Come on, Ally.

00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,898
Who's the man you're
listening too?

00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,066
George Reagan, maybe?

00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,906
He's listening to me.

00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,662
I'm the one who told him that
he should let things go ahead.

00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,871
Unbelievable.

00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,915
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: But that
was based on my best judgment

00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,584
of all the information
that I was provided

00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,752
from you, from
engineering, from the Mardi

00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,795
Gras committee, and the--

00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,879
The Mardi Gras committee?

00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,673
That's the Chamber
of Commerce, Ally.

00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,091
What are you trying
to prove to the mayor?

00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,843
This is not about
proving myself, Matt.

00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,927
Oh, what's it about?

00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,762
You put Cindy on a
float because the Mardi

00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,097
Gras committee says it's OK.

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:22,641
Do you think for a second
I would put Cindy in a parade

00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:25,644
if I thought there
was any real danger?

00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:30,024
Engineering has been on this day
and night just like you have.

00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:32,109
They have found no signs, Matt.

00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,071
Nothing, no radar readings,
no slick buildings, no cracks

00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,114
in the pavement, nothing.

00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,198
You kidding me?

00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,327
You've got two sinkholes
and a dead body out there.

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,536
They're miles away.

00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,747
I can't call off Mardi Gras
just because you refuse

00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,582
to stop living at Angel Valley.

00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,341
What?

00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,684
You didn't kill
those men, Matt.

00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,478
In that mine they
were using explosives

00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,649
they knew nothing about, and
nobody hold you responsible.

00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,818
Nobody, not the government,
not the shareholders,

00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,278
not even their own families.

00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,613
Nobody except you.

00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,657
Your baby stepping
through life because you

00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,410
think that you could have
done something to stop it.

00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,953
They were greedy.

00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:25,996
They were greedy.

00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,082
Nobody could have
stopped them and now you

00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,960
tell clients to lay foundations
30% deeper than code.

00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:36,507
You rate things class four when
other people rate it class two,

00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:38,425
and you do it with everything.

00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,094
You rate me class four.

00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,516
Unsafe until
further exploration.

00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,351
Aren't you guys
engaged yet, Ally?

00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,853
When are you guys
getting married?

00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:54,149
Well, we're waiting to make
sure everything's right.

00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,570
I've known everything
was right for seven years

00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,489
and it's getting really lonely.

00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,136
Morning.

00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:23,137
Remy.

00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,680
Just when I thought I was
going to get some sleep.

00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:28,559
OK, I can't find a
drainage tunnel maps.

00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,227
What are you looking for?

00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,730
MATT ANDREWS: I want to get
down in there with a drill crew.

00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,940
REMY: Drill crew, what for?

00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,818
I want to see
what's in that cavern

00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,944
to see what's really there.

00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,447
You've got to be kidding.

00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,948
You're not kidding.

00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,689
All right boys, cavern
86 that's the smallest one.

00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,274
It should be right
here under the tunnel.

00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,442
It's the only way in.

00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,401
Let's go.

00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,819
You know city's not
going to like this.

00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,279
I live with the city, Remy.

00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,376
ANNOUNCER: Angel float
we're ready to rumble.

00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,804
Can we have the angels please?

00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,056
CINDY EVERS: OK, Allison
I'll see you there.

00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,265
I got to go.

00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,642
I'm so excited.
Bye.

00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:52,684
DALTON: You ready?

00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:53,560
Yeah.

00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:54,978
Good.

00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,481
Wow, you look stunning.

00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,524
Thank you.

00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:00,692
Shall we?

00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,860
REMY: We're through.

00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,831
OK, feed it.

00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,970
MATT ANDREWS:
Whats it look like?

00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,429
REMY: Big black hole.

00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,024
JIMMY GUTRO: What's that?

00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,401
MATT ANDREWS:
Interdirectional C4.

00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:43,777
And what's it for?

00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:44,862
You never know.

00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,826
REMY: Just be careful.

00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,869
OK.

00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:06,091
Am I hot?

00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,301
REMY: You're hot.

00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,280
OK, I'm down.

00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,375
They didn't channel F2.

00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,548
REMY: He's heading
toward the parade route.

00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,258
His depths increasing.

00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,358
Channel F2's walls
and floor are dry.

00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,152
Ceilings in tact
like the others.

00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,784
Channel sloping down.

00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,797
I think I'm in F3, Remy.

00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,507
You want to confirm that?

00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,927
REMY: Confirmed.

00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,221
OK, I'm gonna mark it.

00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,371
I hear noise up ahead.

00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,123
Rocks are falling.

00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,005
He's almost under
the parade route.

00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,265
Oh my god.

00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,232
Remy, you getting this?

00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:11,188
Cindy, Cindy, Cindy.

00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:16,193
Hey, throw me one.

00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:17,777
You look great.

00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:19,404
Thanks.

00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,615
GEORGE REGAN: Well
so far no floats

00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,033
dropping off into sinkholes.

00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,242
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: No.

00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,703
Guess we'll get this
taken care of after tomorrow

00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,997
if there is anything
to take care of.

00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,707
You made the right
decision, Allison.

00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,667
I hope so.

00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,711
You should thank me.

00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,213
For what?

00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,006
My help.

00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,717
I based my decision on
the information you gave me.

00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,511
Yeah, but without me you might
have made the wrong decision.

00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,642
Don't discount me because you
think you have the Mayor's ear,

00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,726
Allison.

00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,436
We're both young and smart,
and you wave that fancy law

00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,687
degree around,
but that's a rat's

00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,439
ass compared to experience.

00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,191
You really think I would
have let you cancel this?

00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,193
What are you trying
to tell me, George?

00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,612
The Mayor surrounds
himself with good people,

00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,823
but don't think that
makes you indispensable.

00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,408
There's a reason he
lets someone else

00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,327
make his decisions for him.

00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,247
There's a reason I do too.

00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,707
[phone ringing]

00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,875
Excuse me.

00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,008
Allison Beauchamp.

00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,635
Come one.

00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,597
REMY: I got It.

00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,723
Did you get Allison?

00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,225
She's already on her
way to the quarter.

00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,395
REMY: There's been a balcony
collapse on Bourbon Street.

00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,938
Come on, move that stuff.

00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:35,897
Get it out of here.

00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,274
Come on, come on.

00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,532
Coming through.

00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,741
I got my credentials.

00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,034
I got them right here.

00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,577
Ally, what happened?

00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,996
What are you doing here?

00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,038
What happened?

00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,415
There were too many
people on the balcony.

00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,376
Too many people
on the balcony?

00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,502
This wasn't here two days ago.

00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,296
Ally, I've been down there.

00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,130
I've seen it.

00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,214
It's 60 feet deep.

00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,465
This is the eastern edge.

00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,592
It runs all along the
parade route like I thought.

00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,177
I got it all on video camera.

00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,679
You got to get these
people out of here.

00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,140
It's crumbling by the second.

00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,100
Hey, get them out of here now.

00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,143
OK.

00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:43,048
Get back to the fire
chief yet, and I

00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,507
want you to get all
the emergency rooms

00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,717
and paramedics standing by.

00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,052
I need a list
of every celebrity

00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,928
and major contributor
on those floats.

00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,221
Yes, this is the Mayor's office.

00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,182
I need to get a message
Ken Gordon Jr. immediately.

00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,185
JEN: Here and Susan Rosner
from FEMA on line four.

00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,103
Jen, can you find
out whose coordinating

00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:59,481
the Dionysus parade and get
them on the line for me?

00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,900
I need to get my niece
off that float right away.

00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,277
This is Allison Beauchamp.

00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,571
Hi Susan, we're working on
an evacuation plan right now.

00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,239
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: How
the hell do we stop this?

00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:14,079
MATT ANDREWS: Well if
we can it's with this.

00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,747
It's polyurethane gel.

00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,379
When it his the air it
erupts hundreds of times

00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:29,219
its natural volume,
and when it solidifies

00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,471
it's like hard Styrofoam.

00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,186
I don't know that yet.

00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,482
MATT ANDREWS: We can
fill the cavity with it.

00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,858
I have somebody looking
for enough right now,

00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,360
but you got to get
those people out first.

00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:46,820
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE: Can the
stampede trigger a collapse?

00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,238
MATT ANDREWS:
Anything's possible.

00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,615
If you can move the people
out evenly from the center.

00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,908
SPEAKER 2: They're
all gonna riot.

00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,243
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Then
let's use riot gear.

00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,494
SPEAKER 2: How close
in can you get units

00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,703
without adding to the stress?

00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,913
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: The
more units in the area,

00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,956
the more congested it'll be.

00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,040
People have trouble getting out.

00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,458
SPEAKER 2: We'll
use the choppers.

00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,006
Matt.

00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,301
Yeah, It'll be OK.

00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,478
How many foot and mounted
are in the area now?

00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,396
Over a 1,000.

00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,647
We're standing by
for evacuation.

00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:23,898
I'm gonna pull all
the units I've got.

00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,024
MAYOR JOHN LAFITTE:
George, I want

00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,693
the media under tight control.

00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:27,527
I'm on it.

00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,486
Allison, you are in charge.

00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,654
The governments on board.

00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,114
Do what you have to, but
just get us out of this.

00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,241
Sir, I feel fully
responsible for this situation.

00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,286
You made your best decision
under the circumstances.

00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:38,204
Just get the people
out of there.

00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,546
REMY: OK, the closest
people with anywhere

00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,214
near enough
polyurethane are Oregon,

00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,299
Benson, and Tallahassee.

00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,050
Now we can C80 it
here in three hours.

00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,510
No, I want it
here in two hours

00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,345
and tell them to send some guys
you know what they're doing.

00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,472
Let's get out of here now.

00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,306
Where we going?

00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,016
Gonna drill a closer hole.

00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,771
POLICE OFFICER: Stop the float.

00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,106
Stop the float.

00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,066
Stop the parade everybody.

00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,903
We are stopping the parade.

00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,215
CINDY EVERS: What's going on?

00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,591
DALTON: I don't know.

00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,718
They're stopping the parade.

00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:47,815
Come on.

00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,484
Somethings happening.

00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,318
This isn't good.

00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,070
Lets get out of here.

00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,174
MATT ANDREWS: This
is as far as we

00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,218
getting up to in
the main cavern.

00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,386
It's 100 feet.

00:59:16,427 --> 00:59:17,887
38.5 degrees that way.

00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:20,473
I want you to find out the
diameter of the poly-u tube.

00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,350
All right, make a hole
just big enough to get it

00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,476
down there as fast as you can.

00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,352
I'm gonna go down.

00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,353
I'm gonna meet the tube.

00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,521
I'm going direct it in the hole.

00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:27,897
Then I'm gonna get
the hell out of there.

00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,482
You start firing that
poly-u down in there,

00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,276
and just keep firing
it till it backs up,

00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,860
and fills up the whole system.
You've got it?

00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,862
OK, but Matt hundred feet.
That's going to take forever.

00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,780
MATT ANDREWS: I
don't have forever.

00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,656
Just go it.

00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,699
REMY: OK guys, lets set it up.

00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,783
Let's go.

00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,672
DALTON: Come on let's go.

01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:30,376
JEN: Allison,
Allison, it's for you.

01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,837
Yes.

01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,381
Is the area clear?

01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,258
No, but she was on
the Angel float.

01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:38,593
She's dressed like an Angel.

01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,845
She's got short
white blonde hair.

01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,723
I know it is.

01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,641
Can you keep looking?

01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,059
I'm going to be at this number.

01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,898
She's not on the float.

01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,324
POLICE OFFICER: Clear
the are immediately.

01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,160
Move out of the area now.

01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,123
Evacuate immediately.

01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,297
POLICE OFFICER 2: Let's move it.

01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,256
MAN AT PARADE: No way.

01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:29,727
We came 1,000 miles for this.

01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,021
REMY: OK, keep me posted.

01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,981
The poly-u will be
here 30 minutes.

01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,024
Matt, where are you?

01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,359
I'm 15 minutes
from the main cavern.

01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:37,443
How far down are you?

01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,986
We're down 60 feet.

01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,239
Keep that baby turning.

01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:20,445
REMY: Poly-u is here, Matt.

01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:22,572
We've got 18, 20 feet to drill.

01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:25,992
Let's get that
bit through, Remy.

01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,626
Oh my god.

01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:36,878
OK, what the hell
is going on here?

01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,004
This is what they
said would happen.

01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,132
We've got to get
out of here now.

01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:45,428
Cindy, Cindy, Cindy.

01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,767
Come on, Remy.

01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:51,768
Come on.

01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:23,007
[phone ringing]

01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:23,716
Hello.

01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:24,634
CINDY EVERS: Allison.

01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,469
Cindy, where are you honey?

01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,595
I'm the French Quarter.

01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,472
Get out of there right now.
You here me?

01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,389
Get out right now.

01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,265
I'm trying.

01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,725
There's too many people outside.

01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,061
The pavements cracking, Allison.

01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:39,899
WORKER 1: All right, I'm ready.

01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,818
REMY: The poly-u is
ready to got, Matt.

01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,862
We're 10 feet away.

01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,531
All right, tell
me where you are.

01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,533
I'm in a club on Bourbon Street.

01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,451
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Tell
me the name of the club.

01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,369
What's it called?

01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,411
It's not holding.

01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,663
I don't know.

01:03:53,746 --> 01:03:54,872
Nine feet.

01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,834
It's not holding.

01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:01,879
I'm going back, Remy.

01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,256
[inaudible]

01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:04,966
Cindy, get out of there.

01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:12,890
[scream]

01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:13,891
Cindy.

01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,934
Dalton.

01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,442
Cindy, Cindy.

01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,697
REMY: Matt, Matt, are you there?

01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,282
Yeah, I'm OK.
Are you guys?

01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah we're stable.

01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,659
What the hell happened?

01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:27,423
MATT ANDREWS: We
we're too late, Remy.

01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,341
We were too late.

01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:29,800
We got a major collapse here.

01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,598
OK, I'm coming out.

01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,766
Finish drilling.

01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,893
We'll get some poly-u down
here, and fill up the system,

01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:41,062
and stop any more collapses.

01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:22,895
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Cindy, Cindy.

01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:27,191
I'm with the city.

01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,359
Excuse me.

01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:37,326
Cindy.

01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,320
[crying]

01:07:54,361 --> 01:08:02,161
Dalton, Dalton.

01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:04,497
DALTON: Cindy?

01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:06,248
Where are you?

01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,374
Are you OK?

01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,799
I think my arms broken.

01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,384
Are you OK?

01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,262
Yeah.

01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,806
I'm bleeding.

01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,682
CINDY EVERS: I'm coming to help.

01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:32,817
Come on.

01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:36,362
Please answer the phone.

01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:45,704
[phone ringing]

01:08:45,746 --> 01:08:47,373
I can't get through.

01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,207
Cindy.

01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,835
Is anyone out there?

01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,836
Help.

01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:52,878
Cindy.

01:09:07,601 --> 01:09:09,061
POLICE OFFICER 3: Mam,
you can't be here.

01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,354
I'm with the Mayor's office.

01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,438
I'm look for somebody,

01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,859
[phone ringing]

01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,985
Cindy.

01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,570
JENNIFER: No, it's Jennifer.

01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,405
Have you heard anything?
- No, I haven't.

01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,573
JENNIFER: Are you OK?

01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:24,201
No, no.

01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,244
Cindy.

01:09:25,286 --> 01:09:28,289
Dalton, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,498
Cindy, get
yourself out of here

01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,500
before anything else falls down.

01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,585
No, I'm not gonna leave you.

01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:34,211
Just get out of here.

01:09:45,389 --> 01:09:47,433
CINDY EVERS: Hold on.

01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:48,392
Just hold on.

01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:49,602
Just hold on.

01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,031
Put your arm out.

01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:29,850
[screaming]

01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:37,566
DALTON: Be careful, Cindy.

01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:51,997
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Cindy.

01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,961
Somebody help me.

01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,173
Hold on tight.

01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:03,133
Somebody help me.

01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:04,301
They're coming honey.

01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:05,094
Hold on.

01:11:05,135 --> 01:11:06,178
Don't let go.

01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,014
Don't let go.

01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,391
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: Get her.

01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,320
Hang on honey.

01:11:57,896 --> 01:11:59,565
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP:
Dalton, thank you so much.

01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,942
Look It's going to be a while
before he gets to the hospital.

01:12:02,026 --> 01:12:03,444
I'm going to stay
here with him, OK?

01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,278
All right.

01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,113
I need to go and find Matt.

01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,239
Please stay together.

01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,074
Call me when you get to
the hospital, promise?

01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,451
CINDY EVERS: Yes.
- OK.

01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:18,167
GEORGE REGAN: O course
out biggest concern

01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,960
is finding and
rescuing anyone who

01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:21,337
may be trapped in the rubble.

01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:22,963
REPORTER: Mr. Regan, is there
anyone responsive for this?

01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,549
GEORGE REGAN: Off the record
ask Allison Beauchamp.

01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:27,092
She's the one that
made the call.

01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,344
One at a time.
Yes, Andrea.

01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:30,471
ANDREA: We've heard rumors
that city officials were

01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:31,764
warned that this could happen.

01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,390
Is there any way this disaster
could have been avoided?

01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:36,101
GEORGE REGAN: No, unfortunately
sinkholes are catastrophic

01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,561
and generally happen
without warning.

01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:39,730
If we had any warning you can
be certain that your city--

01:12:39,813 --> 01:12:41,065
JIMMY GUTRO: But you did
have a warning, George.

01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:42,441
REPORTER 2: What is your name?

01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,151
JIMMY GUTRO: I gave you copies
of these photos two days ago.

01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,903
REPORTER: What are
these pictures, sir?

01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:46,945
What is your name, sir?

01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,073
Jimmy Gutro, public
work supervisor.

01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,075
I put the report right
in your hand, George.

01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:52,159
You did nothing.

01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,702
REPORTER: Can you explain
these pictures, sir?

01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,704
These are copies of photos
taken earlier in the week

01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:59,249
showing stress fractures right
here in the French Quarter.

01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,210
REPORTER: Mr. Regan,
what is your response

01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,295
to these pictures?

01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,671
OFFICER MCGENTY:
Mr. Regan, Officer

01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:08,425
McGenty I'm here to escort
you to the Mayor's office

01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,510
right away.

01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,141
REMY: We've got three more feet.

01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:21,105
Two-- we're in.

01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,232
We're in.

01:13:23,273 --> 01:13:26,610
Got a lot of noise
down here, Remy.

01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:29,446
What's my position?

01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,366
REMY: You're directly
below the downtown core.

01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:25,919
What the hell?

01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,546
My god.

01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,773
MATT ANDREWS: That
French Quarter was just

01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,859
the tip of the iceberg, Remy.

01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,402
This could take down
the rest of the city.

01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,030
We've got to get this
thing filled up and now.

01:14:55,574 --> 01:14:57,117
REMY: He's heading back.

01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,535
Let's get that pipe down there.

01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,267
We're down.

01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:23,352
We're down, Matt.

01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,269
Just leave it.

01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,395
It'll build the
system by itself.

01:15:25,437 --> 01:15:26,522
You've got to get out of there.

01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:27,773
Give me all the
pipe you can, Remy.

01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:29,358
I got to get through that hole.

01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:30,359
OK, feed it.

01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,986
Feed it.

01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,696
Keep it coming.

01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:08,272
Remy, soon as I'm out of
here you stop talking.

01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:10,691
Wait for my signal, Jimmy.

01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,297
The pipes blocked.

01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:35,007
I got to unblock.

01:17:29,686 --> 01:17:38,362
No, hey I got a little
problem down here, Remy.

01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:39,321
I got a collapse.

01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:40,656
I can't get out.

01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:45,494
Starting pumping.

01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:46,787
Start pumping right now.

01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,331
Wait, wait, wait, we've
got to get you out of there.

01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,917
MATT ANDREWS: You
don't have time.

01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,168
I want you to start pumping.

01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:53,960
Come on.

01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,714
Polly, you will
bury him alive.

01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:00,801
Matt, I can't do that.

01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:04,137
OK, it'll kill you.
What about the C4?

01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,180
Can you use that?

01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:06,098
No, I can't.

01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,224
It'll bring the
whole system down.

01:18:07,307 --> 01:18:08,725
Remy, this whole
downtown is going

01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,560
to cave in if you don't
get that poly-u down

01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:11,895
here and do something about it.

01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:12,646
Come on.

01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,939
Start pumping now.

01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,989
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP:
Remy, where are you?

01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:23,740
Remy?

01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:27,369
REMY: We're over here.

01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:28,453
What's going on?

01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,621
REMY: Matt's trapped.

01:18:29,663 --> 01:18:31,873
There's been a
collapse right here.

01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:32,708
Where is that?

01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:33,834
How do we get him out?

01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,293
it's directly below
the downtown corridor.

01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:36,878
The thing is we'd have to
get all the way over there

01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:38,422
and drill another
hole into the channel.

01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,881
Well, let's go what
are you waiting for?

01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:43,343
Allison, we don't
have enough time.

01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:44,344
we have enough time.

01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,512
We have enough time.

01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,847
There has got to be
something else we can do.

01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:47,681
Where is he?

01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:48,765
I want to talk to him.

01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,934
Here.

01:18:50,976 --> 01:18:52,686
Matt?

01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:53,603
Matt, it's me.

01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:54,563
Are you there?

01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:56,273
Allison, make him
send it down now.

01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,984
I'm not starting anything
until we get you out of there

01:18:59,067 --> 01:18:59,985
first.
- No, no, no.

01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:00,902
You don't have time.

01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:01,862
Yes, we have time.

01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,029
Just tell us what we have to do.

01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,489
Listen this whole
place is falling apart.

01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,908
We're talking city blocks,
thousands of people.

01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:07,993
Now get it down here.

01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:08,869
No, Matt.

01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,370
I'm not going to do that.
- Do it.

01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,371
Send it.

01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,831
Start pumping now.
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: No, I won't.

01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,166
MATT ANDREWS: I'm not
asking you, Allison.

01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:15,375
Honey, I'm telling you.

01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:18,211
Please start pumping that
stuff down here right no.

01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,963
Matt, I'm not going
to start pumping

01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,089
while you're down there.

01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,549
There's got to be
something else we can do.

01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:23,925
You can't ask me to do that.

01:19:23,967 --> 01:19:27,262
Honey, do it now please.

01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:30,724
Oh my god.

01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,852
Allison.

01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,812
Ally, I'll find another
way out of here.

01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:39,024
Just send it down now.

01:19:39,065 --> 01:19:41,276
Are you there?

01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,694
- Yes, I'm here.
- Do it.

01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:43,904
Send it down.

01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:49,826
I love you.

01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,290
I love you too.

01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,177
Do it.

01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:21,942
Come on, Remy.

01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,153
Give it to me, buddy.

01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,279
Do it.

01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:43,004
It's coming down, Matt.

01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:44,172
Thank you, Remy.

01:21:27,674 --> 01:21:30,510
REMY: He's moving.

01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,678
Hey Matt, what's going on?

01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:33,805
MATT ANDREWS: I didn't
like the neighborhood.

01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,354
REMY: He's heading
back down the channel.

01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:30,862
He's in channel F3.

01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:31,696
Where is that?

01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:32,948
Where does that take him?

01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,407
Well, if didn't can make
it all the way through it

01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:35,825
should come out somewhere here.

01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:39,079
That's the edge of
the sinkhole, isn't it?

01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,372
Tell him it's the edge.

01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:41,957
Matt, if you can make it all
the way through that channel

01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,750
takes you right to the
eastern edge of the hole.

01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,251
We're gonna get
over there, Matt.

01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:47,712
We're gonna meet you there, OK?

01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:52,634
Come on.

01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,260
Track us and feed
me the coordinates.

01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,345
Let's go.

01:23:56,573 --> 01:23:59,909
Remy, he's about 200 yards
back from the hole still in F3.

01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,703
REMY: If there isn't
a hole there Matt,

01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:02,954
we're going to make one for you.

01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:04,539
Then you better do it quick.

01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:05,790
I only got one way out of here.

01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:06,791
We're going down.

01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,501
We need some help.

01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:25,435
I'm blocked.

01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:26,519
I'm blocked in here.

01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,729
JIMMY GUTRO: You're
at the hole, Matt.

01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:28,813
You're six, seven feet away.

01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:29,981
You're at the hole.

01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:59,135
REMY: Give me those coordinates.

01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,596
FIREFIGHTER: Guys, there's
a man under ground.

01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:04,933
Let's go.
Come on.

01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,351
Remy, he's right
in front of you.

01:25:06,392 --> 01:25:10,396
Remy, he's six feet
in front of you.

01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:11,397
Matt?

01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,659
REMY: Get in there.

01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:23,660
Come on.

01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:24,661
Come on.

01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:47,725
Come on, Jimmy.

01:25:47,767 --> 01:25:48,560
Only eight feet.

01:25:48,601 --> 01:25:50,687
Come on, dig, dig.

01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:05,118
Why isn't he moving?

01:26:11,749 --> 01:26:13,042
Come on let's get in there.

01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:14,043
Come on.

01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:23,136
Matt, can you hear me?

01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,643
He's not responding, Remy.

01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,477
He's not moving.

01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:33,479
No, no, he's in there.

01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:34,606
What's going on?

01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,610
Go faster please.

01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:45,575
Dig faster.
- Come on, guys.

01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:46,367
Dig.

01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:47,368
We can do this.

01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:48,578
We can do this.

01:26:51,372 --> 01:26:55,084
Remy, we lost him.

01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:56,294
Get him back.

01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:57,545
Just get him back.

01:26:57,587 --> 01:26:58,463
What do you mean?

01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:00,381
What do you mean?

01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,217
Matt, we're coming.

01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:04,010
JIMMY GUTRO: The foams on him.

01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,386
It's burying him.

01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:09,432
Remy, he's gone.

01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,183
Dammit.

01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,768
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: What?

01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:12,810
What?

01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:24,739
What does that mean?

01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:26,532
What does that mean?

01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:27,700
Wait, please keep digging.

01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:28,952
Just keep digging.

01:27:28,993 --> 01:27:31,788
He's right there.

01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:32,956
Keep digging.

01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:34,457
Please keep digging.

01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:37,961
Please keep digging.

01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:41,214
Oh no, what have I done?

01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,218
I'm sorry.

01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,724
I'm sorry.

01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:01,085
Matt?

01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:24,525
Way to go, Remy.

01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:11,906
ALLISON BEAUCHAMP: There she is.

01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,584
PARAMEDIC: You can't
come in here ma'am.

01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:24,419
It's full.

01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:25,378
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:33,177
Allison, you guys OK?

01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:34,595
How's he?

01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,180
He's gonna be OK.

01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:38,015
He better be.

01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:39,225
Got a big reception to play.

01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:40,143
Reception?

01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:41,060
What reception?

01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:43,855
A big one.

01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:45,898
Lots of people.

01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,735
Sorry it took so long.

01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:51,070
What do you think?

01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:54,240
Will you?

01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,700
Will I what?

01:30:55,783 --> 01:30:57,160
Will you marry me?

01:30:59,162 --> 01:31:00,163
Yes.

01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:09,172
REPORTER: Matt, Matt,
