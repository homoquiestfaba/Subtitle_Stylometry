I'll be dead.</i>

00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,884
<i>I don't know it yet.</i>

3
00:00:51,917 --> 00:00:54,920
<i>That's why I'm talking
like this.</i>

4
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,193
<i>I'm the only one
standing behind a fence,</i>

5
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:03,695
<i>watching the parade race by.</i>

6
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:13,572
<i>Then it's gone.</i>

7
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,716
<i>I don't believe in love.</i>

8
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,940
<b>STARCROSSED</b>

00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:49,331
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

10
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,932
Baby, can you
zip me up?

11
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,979
I... I talked to
the travel agent this morning.

12
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:29,848
Bora Bora, one week.

13
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,818
You and me.

14
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:50,987
I don't need that.

15
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:52,572
No. Come on.

16
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:58,511
<i>I don't want that.</i>

17
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,550
<i>You're mine.</i>

18
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:07,819
You're mine.

19
00:03:44,856 --> 00:03:48,060
I know you're trying hard
to hold it all together.

20
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:50,062
Look.

21
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,899
It takes time.

22
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,602
This is... It's a process.

23
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,772
Doesn't happen overnight.

24
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,545
Just don't do anything
irrational.

25
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,791
I gotta go.

26
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,563
<i>The company can't lend you
anything else right now.</i>

27
00:04:58,596 --> 00:04:59,864
<i>We need to keep
our current staff afloat.</i>

28
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:00,800
<i>I don't wanna lose anyone.</i>

29
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,902
I'll manage, Laz.
I always do.

00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,637
<i>Hell, you can tell Lucy,
in reality</i>

31
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,138
<i>it's her father
that's pressing this.</i>

32
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:08,641
<i>I'm sure she can
help you sort it out.</i>

33
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,944
<i>Let's talk tomorrow.</i>

34
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:39,738
<i>You know, I've never worked
in all my life.</i>

35
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:42,707
<i>In all my life,
I've never worked.</i>

36
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,577
<i>I've been thinking about that.</i>

37
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,212
<i>What did you say?</i>

38
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,813
<i>I didn't say anything.</i>

39
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,548
<i>You did too.</i>

40
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:53,052
<i>You said I was very fond
of expensive things...</i>

41
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:55,787
<i>Furs and jewels and things.</i>

42
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,923
<i>Did I say that?</i>

43
00:05:57,956 --> 00:06:01,593
<i>I guess you and I have been,
more or less, used to...</i>

44
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,629
<i>a life of pink champagne.</i>

45
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:08,995
Could you?

46
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:11,597
Anthony.

47
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:14,667
You all right?

48
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,303
Yeah.

49
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:20,939
I'm fine.

50
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,274
My father says
he's been trying

51
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,242
to
Get a hold of you.

52
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:25,176
Says you haven't
returned his calls.

53
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,745
You know, I hate talking
business with you two.

54
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:28,864
I'll call him.

55
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,949
Thank you.

56
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:34,887
Talked to Nathan today.

57
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,324
He's excited about tomorrow.

58
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:49,734
Dance with me.

59
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,855
-We have to go.
-No, no.

60
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,358
We have to go.

61
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,895
I'm gonna take my own car.

62
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:24,769
I'm gonna have drinks
with Valerie after.

63
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,793
Fucking dick!

64
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:10,081
Thanks.

65
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:49,154
Is, this seat taken?

66
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,927
Well, it's fate.

67
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,163
I don't believe in that,
but I'll take the seat.

68
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,301
Pity.

69
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:05,870
Scotch, please.

70
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,953
Miss?

71
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,325
You can't smoke in here.

72
00:10:27,926 --> 00:10:30,062
Sorry.

73
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,432
Come on.

74
00:11:05,397 --> 00:11:07,333
What's your name?

75
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,370
I'm called Kat.

76
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:13,438
Ben.

77
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,973
Rawlins.

78
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,176
You don't look
like a Ben.

79
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,211
It's a middle name.

80
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,317
I will not release this
into your custody...

81
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:30,556
until you tell me.

82
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,192
It's just gonna go out.

83
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,362
Then I'll just wait
until you light another one.

84
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,948
Letholdus.

85
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:59,384
<i>Now, that...</i>

86
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,353
That sounds
like a middle name.

87
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,521
It doesn't sound
like any kind of name.

88
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,524
Well, I smell a story.

89
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,463
Letholdus was the
first knight

90
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,165
over the wall
of Jerusalem

91
00:12:14,198 --> 00:12:16,100
in the first crusade.

92
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,202
So it's noble.

93
00:12:18,235 --> 00:12:19,404
No one calls me that.

94
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,572
Why not?

95
00:12:22,106 --> 00:12:23,975
I don't know.

96
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,379
Why are you so interested?

97
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,188
You know, it's strange.

98
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:42,126
We're out here listening
to the world go by,

99
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,395
and we know
there's people out there,

100
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:48,266
even though we can't see them.

101
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,368
I always wonder
what their story is.

102
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:59,110
I'm still curious
why no one calls you that.

103
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:08,920
Fine. I'll find out
sooner or later.

104
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:11,389
Wait.

105
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,392
You've got an eyelash.

106
00:13:13,424 --> 00:13:15,360
Make a wish.

107
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,365
Quickly!

108
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,974
Guys, you can't smoke
out here either.

109
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:32,644
I'm not...
We're not smoking.

110
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,379
Dude.

111
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:41,285
I used to dance to this
when I was little.

112
00:13:41,318 --> 00:13:44,255
It always used to
make me feel so free.

113
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:47,225
I don't feel that way anymore.

114
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,028
So, what are you then?

115
00:13:51,229 --> 00:13:53,331
What would you find
more enticing...

116
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,167
The answer
or the mystery?

117
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,472
To mystery.

118
00:14:01,172 --> 00:14:02,575
Cheers.

119
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,129
Another one?

120
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,614
Yeah, please.

121
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,116
I'm gonna start
charging you for those.

122
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,150
I don't pay for things.

123
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:15,286
Another piece
of the puzzle.

124
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,489
I wouldn't try
to solve me.

125
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,091
Come on. Everybody
wants someone

126
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,326
to solve them,
don't they?

127
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,694
Not me.

128
00:14:22,726 --> 00:14:24,429
Why not?

129
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:30,134
'Cause everything important
gets taken away.

130
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:34,172
Good evening, sir.

131
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,075
Ma'am? Could I
get something started

132
00:14:37,107 --> 00:14:39,076
for the two of you?

133
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,615
Gin with tonic
and your driest Pinot Noir.

134
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,684
Right away, sir.

135
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:52,323
Hello.

136
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:57,295
You know him?

137
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:00,765
You remember Bailey Steinfeld.
It's her cousin, Ben.

138
00:15:00,798 --> 00:15:02,701
From Kentucky.

139
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,201
She wanted me
to show him around the city,

140
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:07,339
so it's the least I could do.

141
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,707
Nice to meet you, Ben.
Nice to meet you.

142
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:13,445
I don't hear an accent.

143
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,281
We...
We moved around a lot.

144
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:20,552
Aren't you going
to introduce me?

145
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:23,187
-And you are?
-I'm Kat.

146
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:25,289
Maddox.

147
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:27,625
Kat's
Rommel Lazarus's niece.

148
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,097
Yes. My mother's
his sister... Lily.

149
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:40,339
We were just gonna go,
get a table and have a drink.

150
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:42,341
Why don't we join you?

151
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:46,312
Sure.

152
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:09,201
-Here you are, ma'am.
-Thank you.

153
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,107
Sir? Gin and tonic.

154
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,842
Enjoy.

155
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,577
Waiter.

156
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,115
You can call me Gerry,
sir.

157
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,584
Gerry, this has
too much tonic in it.

158
00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:29,553
I asked for gin with tonic.

159
00:16:29,586 --> 00:16:31,657
"With" means 10% tonic.

160
00:16:32,657 --> 00:16:34,393
-So sorry.
-A real drink.

161
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,628
-I'll fix it right now.
-A man's drink. Do you understand?

162
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,945
Yes, sir.

163
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,230
You don't need to do that.

164
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,267
Look, I know what I want.
And now he knows what I want.

165
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:43,300
Now he's gonna get it for me.

166
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,903
Alright you don't need
to talk to him like that.

167
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:49,408
Was I wrong, Ben?

168
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,410
Was I wrong?

169
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,813
No,
you were not wrong.

170
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:00,685
Here you are, sir.
Gin and tonic.

171
00:17:00,717 --> 00:17:02,721
Ten percent.

172
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:06,557
Perfect, Gerry.

173
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:10,227
So, how did the two of you
get thrown together?

174
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,565
Well,

175
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:15,901
he was gallant.

176
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:20,739
Rommel. Someone's
actually named that?

177
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:22,807
I thought I had a bad name.

178
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,610
What are you talking about?
Your name is Benjamin.

179
00:17:26,644 --> 00:17:29,615
Well, no, it's not.

180
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:34,620
Erwin Rommel.
He was a Nazi field general.

181
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:41,259
Considered to be the most humane
and ingenious of his kind.

182
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,462
Still a Nazi though.

183
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:01,947
I'm going to go
to the bathroom.

184
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,216
Excuse me.

185
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,750
Yeah.

186
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,003
I have to use
the restroom too.

187
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,673
If you guys
will excuse me.

188
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:52,596
My shift ended.

189
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:57,184
Have a good one.

190
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:58,702
Have a good night, man.

191
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:14,785
Really?

192
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,561
You okay?

193
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:31,895
You know,
I have this theory.

194
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,064
You can tell a lot
about a person

195
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,767
when you see them
standing alone.

196
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,769
That right?

197
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,806
I learned a lot.

198
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:43,442
About?

199
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,479
I don't think
I should tell you.

200
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:53,851
Go on. Tell me.

201
00:20:56,054 --> 00:21:00,091
You're hiding something.
A secret.

202
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:02,160
Maybe more than one.

203
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:04,528
The trick is, you've learned
to hide the hiding.

204
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,403
You know this based
on what exactly?

205
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:13,838
Well, it takes one
to know one.

206
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:26,852
You wanna
get out of here?

207
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:30,721
Me and you.
I mean, it's just...

208
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:32,857
It's kind of a lot
to handle right now.

209
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,995
You wanna just...
cut out maybe?

210
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:40,831
I can't.

211
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,939
Don't leave me alone
with them.

212
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:58,083
We were getting ready
to send out a search party.

213
00:21:58,115 --> 00:22:01,720
Ben and I were just saying,
it's about to get busy in here.

214
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,021
Maybe we should just
continue this at your place.

215
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:08,026
Our house?

216
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,596
-Lucy's meeting someone later.
-I can cancel.

217
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,500
Ben.

218
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,970
What do you say?

219
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:21,472
I'm sure he has
somewhere better to go.

220
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,112
Actually, I don't.

221
00:22:27,144 --> 00:22:29,513
Nothin' better at least.

222
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:33,651
Anthony, why don't you take Kat,
and Benjamin will ride with me.

223
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:35,921
I want him to see
the city at night.

224
00:22:36,921 --> 00:22:38,106
Shall we?

225
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,290
I'll get the check.

226
00:23:04,949 --> 00:23:06,250
<i>Who is she?</i>

227
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:13,124
I don't know.

228
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:15,894
If you ever...
I swear to God...

229
00:23:15,926 --> 00:23:17,028
-I...
-What?

230
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:23,033
I'm sorry.

231
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,236
I'm just happy
that you're here.

232
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,142
<i>I don't believe you.
In my house?</i>

233
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,877
<i>You better not
say anything to her.</i>

234
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,712
<i>Nothing.</i>

235
00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:36,964
You promise me.

236
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:38,182
Promise.

237
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,121
You've a beautiful home.

238
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,590
Thank you.
We're very comfortable here.

239
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,192
It's been in the family
for years.

240
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:25,797
Please... sit down.

241
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:27,999
Make yourself
comfortable.

242
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,934
Anthony, darling.

243
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,638
Why don't you make Ben
a drink?

244
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,907
We should,
just stay here.

245
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,375
Nonsense.

246
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:40,312
Just make him the...

247
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,113
Perfect drink.

248
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:51,021
Kat?
Will you join us?

249
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:52,356
I'm fine here.

250
00:24:58,695 --> 00:24:59,997
Benjamin?

251
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:16,114
Is this your son?

252
00:25:16,146 --> 00:25:17,881
That was taken
in Jackson Hole

253
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:20,085
a few summers back.

254
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:28,359
Sweet face.
That was preschool.

255
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,807
Are you a cognac man?

256
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,211
Not really.

257
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:50,147
This one.

258
00:25:57,954 --> 00:25:59,490
You have good taste.

259
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,228
This was bottled
before my father was born.

260
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,465
It cost me $77,000.

261
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:16,039
It's not polite to talk
about

262
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:19,744
the cost of things
with company.

263
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:21,379
Lucy would say that.

264
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:28,886
It's funny.

265
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:33,524
That a thing so rare
can be so insignificant.

266
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:47,938
Do you have a family?

267
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,107
No, not really.

268
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,279
You? You got kids?

269
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,413
Yeah.

270
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:59,283
We adopted a son, Nathan.

271
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:02,886
He's away at camp.

272
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:14,132
Have you been
enjoying my wife?

273
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,204
What was that?

274
00:27:21,005 --> 00:27:23,207
Lucy.

275
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,210
She's showing you
the city, right?

276
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,812
Yeah.

277
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:30,515
Yeah, she has.

278
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,384
How do you like it?
The city.

279
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,891
I tend not to stick around
anywhere too long.

280
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:43,327
See, I'm just
the opposite.

281
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:50,969
When I have something,
I can't let it go.

282
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:56,875
I stay too long.

283
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,984
Funny accident
how we all

284
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:08,452
found
each other tonight.

285
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,961
Should...
Should we head back?

286
00:28:25,435 --> 00:28:28,272
Ben has great taste.
The '29.

287
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:33,443
Lucy was just telling me
about your son.

288
00:28:33,477 --> 00:28:35,613
He's learning
how to play tennis.

289
00:28:35,645 --> 00:28:37,615
Is he?

290
00:28:37,647 --> 00:28:40,284
He's very athletic
and he's so smart.

291
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:46,291
-Ladies?
-Cheers.

292
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,194
Benjamin?

293
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:53,331
Thanks.

294
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,067
<i>Nazdarovya.</i>

295
00:28:56,099 --> 00:28:58,068
<i>Nazdarovya.</i>

296
00:28:58,102 --> 00:29:00,038
To a good night.

297
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:08,045
So is he here?
Your son.

298
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:10,114
Is he sleeping?
Should we be quiet?

299
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:13,016
-Actually...
-Lucy.

300
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:15,886
Can I talk to you?

301
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,221
Okay.

302
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,260
-Now.
-Excuse us.

303
00:29:25,028 --> 00:29:26,631
We'll be
just a minute.

304
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:33,304
Why are you doing this?
So rude.

305
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,443
What are you doing?

306
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:00,197
I want to smoke.

307
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:05,002
What if this
is my last one?

308
00:30:06,537 --> 00:30:09,207
Well, then I'd
take it from you.

309
00:30:46,242 --> 00:30:48,245
What's your fantasy?

310
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,201
There you are.

311
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,480
Well, what is it?

312
00:31:28,384 --> 00:31:29,586
To be free.

313
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:30,788
Of what?

314
00:31:35,625 --> 00:31:37,427
<i>I don't know.</i>

315
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:43,166
<i>What's yours?</i>

316
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:50,574
To die young.

317
00:32:09,192 --> 00:32:11,395
You didn't really
mean that, did you?

318
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:15,767
What are you doing?

319
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:20,570
What are you doing?

320
00:32:21,538 --> 00:32:23,207
You're not coming in?

321
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:28,546
I...

322
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:30,513
I just wonder
where they went.

323
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:32,616
You really care?

324
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:35,786
No. I just...

325
00:32:35,818 --> 00:32:38,321
They could be fucking.

326
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:40,391
No.

327
00:32:40,423 --> 00:32:43,126
They haven't in months.

328
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,762
He told me.

329
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,664
He told you that?

330
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:55,271
I just think...
I don't...

331
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:57,708
People's private lives
should stay private.

332
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,110
See, that's your problem.

333
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,246
You want everything
to be like a dream.

334
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,115
But it's not a dream.

335
00:33:05,148 --> 00:33:07,784
Sex is sex.

336
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:09,319
Fucking is fucking.

337
00:33:12,556 --> 00:33:14,558
Don't be such a prude.

338
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,595
I'm not a prude.

339
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:22,432
You afraid to jump?

340
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:43,921
I'm not a prude.

341
00:35:14,311 --> 00:35:17,548
So, where does she
keep you?

342
00:35:21,851 --> 00:35:23,353
What?

343
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,724
Where does Mrs. Bishop
keep you?

344
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,760
I know you don't work.

345
00:35:31,494 --> 00:35:33,830
I'm a writer.

346
00:35:33,864 --> 00:35:37,268
Right.

347
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,835
I am.

348
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:44,741
Have I read
any of your work?

349
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,711
'Cause I read everything.

350
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:51,782
I was published.

351
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:55,019
How long ago?

352
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:58,655
Four years.

353
00:36:01,391 --> 00:36:02,894
So you don't work.

354
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,730
I'm not judging.

355
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,836
You're imagining things,
Kat.

356
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,307
I can smell
one of my own kind.

357
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,740
Don't.
It's not like that.

358
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:19,076
Why? Why not?

359
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,012
Some writer.

360
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:27,350
You're with
a married man.

361
00:36:27,384 --> 00:36:29,853
-It's more complicated than that.
-Is it? Is it?

362
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:32,523
What is it,

363
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:33,590
like some kind of act
or something?

364
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:35,992
It's all an act, Ben.

365
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:37,794
We give people
the versions of ourselves

366
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:40,096
they need to feel safe.

367
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,967
I give him what he needs,
so he gives me what I want.

368
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,541
What does that mean?

369
00:36:50,574 --> 00:36:52,842
It means
he pays for my life.

370
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,479
For all of it.

371
00:37:00,583 --> 00:37:02,685
So you're a whore.

372
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,554
Don't do that.

373
00:37:04,588 --> 00:37:07,057
No, say it with me.
Say it with me.

374
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,793
"I'm a whore."

375
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:11,829
You're one to talk.

376
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,771
Lucy's showing me the city.

377
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:24,074
I bet.

378
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,815
So, where does he
keep you?

379
00:37:35,418 --> 00:37:37,587
Where does he keep
his whore?

380
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:40,090
A loft in the marina.

381
00:37:42,425 --> 00:37:44,862
Your turn.

382
00:37:44,894 --> 00:37:47,597
Why should I have to
tell you anything?

383
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:49,766
Because I can't stand
a liar,

384
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:53,937
and I liked standing you.

385
00:38:04,047 --> 00:38:06,650
Downtown.

386
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,525
She keeps me downtown.

387
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,673
I like we're being honest.

388
00:38:29,706 --> 00:38:31,474
Honest?

389
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:32,809
Back there...

390
00:38:42,184 --> 00:38:44,989
Things are getting
quite serious, aren't they?

391
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,727
Let's go look around
some more.

392
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,562
I don't wanna look around.

393
00:39:49,753 --> 00:39:51,055
You're beautiful.

394
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,963
Sometimes dirty things
have a kind of beauty.

395
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:18,181
This can't lead anyplace.

396
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,986
I know.

397
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:55,586
Now that I've found you,

398
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,922
I don't want to let you go.

399
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:06,329
We really should
get back downstairs.

400
00:41:08,364 --> 00:41:09,932
Anthony?

401
00:41:09,965 --> 00:41:11,701
What?

402
00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,220
Are you listening to me?

403
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,704
Yes.

404
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:22,646
Where did you get this?

405
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,214
What?

406
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:26,616
This bra.

407
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,853
I don't think I've ever
seen you wear it before.

408
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:05,256
What's this?

409
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:09,159
This...

410
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,297
is a tattoo.

411
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:15,798
Come on.

412
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:18,969
It's...

413
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:22,038
It's the name of a song that
my father would sing me

414
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:25,008
when I was a kid to
put me to sleep.

415
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,110
"Szerelem."

416
00:42:27,143 --> 00:42:29,746
It, means "love" in hungarian.

417
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:34,150
Well,
what's the song say?

418
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,420
It's in hungarian.

419
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:38,355
Tell me your favorite part.

420
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,997
Favorite part is...

421
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,270
"I would do anything
for my old lover.

422
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,407
I would dip the water
of the sea.

423
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,143
I would pick shells
from the seabed,

424
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:05,115
and I would sew a wreath
for my old lover."

425
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:12,488
Tell me about him...

426
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,759
Your father.

427
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,305
He was, you know,

428
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:32,843
the strongest man in the world
to me when I was a kid.

429
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:34,745
You know how you think
when you're a kid.

430
00:43:34,777 --> 00:43:38,748
He was...
He was a superhero to me.

431
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,452
You know, my book
was about my parents.

432
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:47,124
Tell me about your mom.

433
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:56,899
My mother... passed away
when I was seven.

434
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:05,375
It crushed my father.

435
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:07,143
It devastated him.

436
00:44:09,478 --> 00:44:10,980
He...

437
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,485
He lost it... all that...

438
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:18,922
That strength
that made him great.

439
00:44:18,954 --> 00:44:22,226
And I watched it all melt away
when I was a kid.

440
00:44:26,028 --> 00:44:27,496
He would cry to me.

441
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:31,268
He would cry to me,
a seven, eight-year-old kid.

442
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:36,306
And he'd be sobbing,

443
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:38,842
telling me how much
he missed her,

444
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:42,079
how much he needed her.

445
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:45,449
I wouldn't know what to say.

446
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,550
You know, why would...

447
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:51,054
How would I know
what to say?

448
00:44:51,086 --> 00:44:53,556
And everyone else,
they were telling him

449
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,992
that it wasn't his fault,

450
00:44:56,025 --> 00:44:59,396
that she was just
an unhappy person.

451
00:44:59,429 --> 00:45:04,300
But...
he wasn't hearing it.

452
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:10,873
He took the full weight of it.
He blamed himself.

453
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,012
You know,

454
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:20,217
I remember having
the distinct thought that...

455
00:45:22,184 --> 00:45:26,355
how is anything in the world...

456
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:28,392
worth that much pain?

457
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:40,536
And from that point on,
you know, he...

458
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,606
It was like he had
two different lives.

459
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,443
There was the life
while my mother was alive,

460
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:49,246
and there was the life after.

461
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,419
Whatever it was,

462
00:45:56,552 --> 00:45:59,088
I stayed in this life.

463
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:04,360
Letholdus.

464
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:15,405
I was supposed
to see him today.

465
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,108
But you didn't?

466
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,217
Tell me something
about your parents.

467
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:30,988
Your family.

468
00:46:38,293 --> 00:46:40,663
Don't.

469
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:42,699
Come on.

470
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:51,041
Come on.

471
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,414
All right.

472
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,068
This sounds like Stravinsky.

473
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,108
We danced to Stravinsky
on our wedding day.

474
00:47:26,342 --> 00:47:28,711
Why's that
so important?

475
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:30,713
I used to love Stravinsky.

476
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:39,623
Dance with me, Mrs. Bishop.

477
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:41,458
So that's why we're here.

478
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:46,762
I remembered us.

479
00:47:48,797 --> 00:47:50,600
I remembered the day.

480
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:55,038
Can't a man love his wife?

481
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,410
Anthony,

482
00:48:00,443 --> 00:48:02,445
you can't just change
everything back

483
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:05,215
the way it was
because you want to.

484
00:48:08,117 --> 00:48:13,189
All this... what we have...
Is nothing.

485
00:48:13,222 --> 00:48:14,591
You're nothing.

486
00:48:20,262 --> 00:48:21,797
What are you doing?

487
00:48:21,831 --> 00:48:23,533
You act like a cunt,
then I am going

488
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:24,300
to treat you like a cunt.

489
00:48:24,333 --> 00:48:25,635
Stop... Stop it!

490
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:28,704
No!

491
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:35,411
Get out!

492
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,780
What?

493
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,481
You gonna swap me out
for the boy?

494
00:48:38,514 --> 00:48:40,617
He's more of a man
than you.

495
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,355
Fuck. You get up.

496
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:46,522
Get up!

497
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:47,656
Fuck you.

498
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,224
Get up!

499
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:58,234
What, are you
gonna shoot me?

500
00:48:58,266 --> 00:48:59,568
Go ahead.

501
00:48:59,601 --> 00:49:00,853
Go ahead and shoot me.

502
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,105
Wait. Stop!

503
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,748
You didn't want
to dance with me,

504
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,516
so you're going
to dance for me.

505
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,586
Do you understand?

506
00:49:18,286 --> 00:49:20,856
Come on.

507
00:49:22,724 --> 00:49:24,226
Yeah.

508
00:49:43,846 --> 00:49:48,150
Harder. Harder!

509
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:55,858
That's right.

510
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:04,601
Yeah. Harder.
Harder.

511
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:10,373
Fucking harder.
Fuck.

512
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:11,708
Yeah.
That's right.

513
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:16,613
Now turn around.

514
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:22,452
Please. Please. Please.

515
00:50:22,485 --> 00:50:25,521
Please. Please. Please.

516
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,490
Please.

517
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,262
Baby, please.

518
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,364
I'm sor...
I'm sorry.

519
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:39,836
Anthony.

520
00:51:48,971 --> 00:51:50,639
Yeah, hi. Hi.

521
00:51:50,672 --> 00:51:54,610
I need a cab
as soon as possible.

522
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:57,947
Yeah.
54 Alighieri Drive.

523
00:51:59,347 --> 00:52:01,617
Thirty minutes?
Thank you. Thank you.

524
00:52:05,054 --> 00:52:08,657
<i>Hey, Laz.</i>

525
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:12,628
<i>It's-It's Lucy.</i>

526
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:15,464
<i>I-I really need
to talk to you.</i>

527
00:52:16,465 --> 00:52:18,468
<i>Can you come by later?</i>

528
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,342
I got a cab.

529
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:07,083
I told you...
I can't.

530
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,370
You've gotta stop running
at some point.

531
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:32,775
You pigeonholing me?

532
00:53:32,807 --> 00:53:35,043
I mean, what are you
doing here, Kat?

533
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:36,880
Why are you
with this guy?

534
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,849
You don't know what
you're talking about.

535
00:53:40,882 --> 00:53:42,985
I know you're better
than this.

536
00:53:43,018 --> 00:53:45,788
You're better than
what he makes you into.

537
00:53:50,992 --> 00:53:53,395
There you two are.

538
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:57,634
Everything okay?

539
00:54:01,936 --> 00:54:03,940
Benjamin, would you
excuse us?

540
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:55,657
<i>What's going on?</i>

541
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:57,993
Nothing.

542
00:54:58,027 --> 00:55:00,030
I know you, Kat.
You don't do nothing.

543
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,800
Where were you?

544
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:14,543
You fucked him,
didn't you?

545
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:18,914
No, say, "No, Anthony,
I didn't fuck him."

546
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,233
He can hear you.

547
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:21,518
That's not an answer.

548
00:55:22,617 --> 00:55:24,621
Anthony, don't...

549
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:27,657
Kat.

550
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:34,730
I need you.

551
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,932
What about
what I need?

552
00:55:36,965 --> 00:55:38,517
I give you everything.

553
00:55:38,518 --> 00:55:40,069
No, you don't.
You give me nothing.

554
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:44,007
Not what I want.

555
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,777
I'm your whore.
That's all.

556
00:55:53,114 --> 00:55:54,783
Please.

557
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,893
Give me what I want.

558
00:56:11,032 --> 00:56:13,036
I don't have him.

559
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,172
He's not here.

560
00:56:32,987 --> 00:56:36,759
You were gone a while.
Did you get lost?

561
00:56:56,612 --> 00:57:00,016
Not... Lucy, not right now.
Anthony might see.

562
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:02,085
Anthony doesn't
see anything.

563
00:57:04,652 --> 00:57:06,922
You remember
our story?

564
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:16,632
I would do anything
for you.

565
00:57:16,664 --> 00:57:19,701
You know that,
right? Anything.

566
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:21,971
Anything you want.

567
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,182
<i>You took care of me.</i>

568
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:36,185
<i>You took care of me.</i>

569
00:57:54,302 --> 00:57:55,771
You want her.

570
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:57,239
What? What?

571
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,643
No.

572
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:02,911
Then why... why'd you
tell her your name?

573
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:06,447
What are you talking about?

574
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:08,149
Your real name, Ben.
Your real fucking name.

575
00:58:08,182 --> 00:58:10,085
-You told her.
-What are you... Chill.

576
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:12,121
Don't you fucking...
Don't you fucking

577
00:58:12,153 --> 00:58:12,922
tell me
to shut up!

578
00:58:12,954 --> 00:58:13,956
What's gotten into you
right now?

579
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:15,824
You are mine.
I will take what is mine.

580
00:58:15,858 --> 00:58:17,793
-Will you fucking tell me the truth?
-Calm down.

581
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:18,878
Stop.
What are you doing?

582
00:58:18,879 --> 00:58:19,929
Just tell me the truth!

583
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:36,980
Anthony, Laz is here.

584
00:58:39,213 --> 00:58:41,217
What is he doing here?

585
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,152
I'm gonna
take care of it.

586
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:48,423
What did you do? I can't
believe you called Laz.

587
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:03,105
Laz, how are you?

588
00:59:03,137 --> 00:59:06,942
I am well, Tony. Thanks.
Everything okay?

589
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,979
Yeah.
Everything's great.

590
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:13,716
I got your message.
What was so urgent?

591
00:59:13,748 --> 00:59:16,351
-I'm sorry about that.
-Lucy and I just had an argument.

592
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:19,254
It's okay.

593
00:59:19,288 --> 00:59:21,791
What about the company?

594
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:23,358
What's wrong
with the company?

595
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:24,893
Nothing's wrong.

596
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:26,996
Laz, it was just
a misunderstanding.

597
00:59:27,028 --> 00:59:28,965
We're fine.

598
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:30,733
Good to hear.

599
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:33,436
Laz, what...
How's Katherine?

600
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:38,441
My poor daughter, Kat.

601
00:59:41,777 --> 00:59:43,913
She's been a mess
for some time now.

602
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:50,118
<i>My first wife raised her
in England of all places.</i>

603
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:54,289
She doesn't talk
to anyone in the family.

604
00:59:55,891 --> 00:59:59,095
They called me
when she tried...

605
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,430
Tried...

606
01:00:05,233 --> 01:00:07,068
You never met her
after all these years?

607
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:12,307
I think...

608
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:15,043
we should continue this
in the living room.

609
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:17,213
I guess I could stay a bit,
now that I'm here.

610
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,981
You know what?
Let's just stay here.

611
01:00:19,014 --> 01:00:20,115
No, actually, you know,

612
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:21,784
the living room is much
more comfortable.

613
01:00:21,817 --> 01:00:23,519
Yeah, we can listen
to that...

614
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:25,153
Stravinsky you
used to talk about.

615
01:00:25,186 --> 01:00:28,123
I just prefer
to stay here.

616
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:41,971
I lied to you before.

617
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,243
About?

618
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,449
"He thought she must
be bouncing

619
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:57,452
between the most
beautiful dreams,

620
01:00:57,485 --> 01:01:00,556
as her eyes fluttered,
threatening to wake.

621
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,494
We were stripped bare
in every sense imaginable.

622
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:11,199
Very rarely did I smile
after those days but,

623
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:13,436
who could help it?

624
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:16,239
We had made such
beautiful poetry together."

625
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:26,416
That's mine.

626
01:01:27,615 --> 01:01:29,818
I loved your book.

627
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,987
It didn't drone on.

628
01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:37,259
It had a beginning,
middle and end.

629
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,028
I told you
I read everything.

630
01:01:44,199 --> 01:01:46,034
What do you want
from me?

631
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,572
Everything.

632
01:01:52,106 --> 01:01:54,242
I can't help you.

633
01:01:56,978 --> 01:02:00,949
Look, Kat, this-this fantasy
that you want to live in...

634
01:02:02,583 --> 01:02:04,286
There's no future in it.

635
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:06,355
Don't do that.

636
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:10,525
There's no future in it.

637
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:13,295
Stop it.

638
01:02:13,327 --> 01:02:14,479
<i>There's no future in it.</i>

639
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,630
<i>Stop!</i>

640
01:02:15,664 --> 01:02:17,867
-There's no future in it!
-Stop it!

641
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,468
There's no future, Kat.

642
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:21,336
Stop it.

643
01:02:49,965 --> 01:02:51,467
No!

644
01:02:53,467 --> 01:02:55,270
Nathan!

645
01:02:56,672 --> 01:02:58,374
No.

646
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,351
<i>Nathan's your son.</i>

647
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,659
And Lucy
doesn't know?

648
01:03:17,693 --> 01:03:20,963
It's his birthday
tomorrow.

649
01:03:20,996 --> 01:03:22,999
And no one
helped you.

650
01:03:28,436 --> 01:03:30,539
Anthony and I...

651
01:03:32,306 --> 01:03:35,043
<i>I had a problem.</i>

652
01:03:37,278 --> 01:03:41,416
They took him from me.
They said I wasn't fit.

653
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:43,034
To be his mother?

654
01:03:43,035 --> 01:03:44,619
To be his anything.

655
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:54,329
I signed the paper.

656
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:58,033
I signed it
with this hand.

657
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:05,273
They'll be back soon.

658
01:04:05,306 --> 01:04:09,311
-We can tell them.
-Tell them what exactly?

659
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:14,517
Kat, I...
I know you now.

660
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:21,657
Now I don't want
to know you.

661
01:04:59,494 --> 01:05:02,298
Hey.
I'm going downtown.

662
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:22,678
<i>How are you two?</i>

663
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,418
I know Nathan's
back tomorrow.

664
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:32,153
How was it
having him away

665
01:06:32,186 --> 01:06:33,422
at camp
for the first time?

666
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:37,693
You really want to know?

667
01:06:39,427 --> 01:06:40,730
Really?

668
01:06:42,697 --> 01:06:44,200
Lucy.

669
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:48,269
I don't care anymore.

670
01:06:50,905 --> 01:06:52,440
This isn't my business.

671
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:54,176
Anthony and I have both
been having affairs.

672
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:56,310
That's why we're in here,
because our lovers,

673
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:57,278
well, they're in
the living room.

674
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,614
Right now.

675
01:06:58,646 --> 01:06:59,731
I should be going.

676
01:06:59,732 --> 01:07:00,815
No, no, no.
You asked...

677
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:03,652
Really. It's late. I gotta...
I should be getting back.

678
01:07:03,684 --> 01:07:06,654
No, Laz.
She's telling the truth.

679
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,164
You ever stop to think about

680
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:20,368
the millions of little things
in people's lives...

681
01:07:20,402 --> 01:07:22,438
that pull them apart?

682
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,816
See, in life,
we bleed for people.

683
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:37,952
I mean, that's what
love is... blood.

684
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:43,992
So we bleed until
there's nothing left.

685
01:07:54,436 --> 01:07:56,672
Lucy, she's...

686
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,717
You've taken all the blood
I have for you.

687
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:12,988
I'm dried up.

688
01:08:19,594 --> 01:08:20,930
Nothing.

689
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:33,469
This isn't you, Kat.

690
01:09:34,668 --> 01:09:36,671
This is bullshit.

691
01:09:38,573 --> 01:09:40,342
You and me, we're not.

692
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:43,377
Didn't you feel it?

693
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:44,746
No, you fucked me.

694
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:46,982
He fucked me too.

695
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:50,686
Is this shit
all you care about?

696
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,088
Your-Your allowance
and your-your penthouse?

697
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:56,658
And-And your fucking
Jimmy Choos?

698
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,393
Is that what you
want to hear?

699
01:09:58,426 --> 01:10:00,329
At least
it'd be honest.

700
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:03,599
I want my son, Ben.

701
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:06,033
I want to watch him sleep!

702
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:07,935
I want to smell him
in the morning!

703
01:10:07,969 --> 01:10:10,706
I want...
I want to wipe his tears.

704
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:12,040
I need him.

705
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:16,445
Look at me.

706
01:10:18,846 --> 01:10:20,615
I can help.

707
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,384
Why do you want
to help me?

708
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:24,019
You know who I am.

709
01:10:28,555 --> 01:10:31,726
There's no one out there
for people like us.

710
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,192
Who's this?

711
01:11:41,462 --> 01:11:43,064
Laz, let me explain.

712
01:11:43,097 --> 01:11:45,801
Laz, what are you doing?

713
01:11:45,833 --> 01:11:47,702
Shut up, Lucy.

714
01:11:47,735 --> 01:11:51,140
Come with me.
Take my hand.

715
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:53,709
Katherine.

716
01:11:55,176 --> 01:11:57,479
Don't call me that.

717
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:59,847
You can't tell me
what to do.

718
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,615
You only care now
because you're here

719
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:02,651
and you see me.

720
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:04,453
-Come on.
-Just...

721
01:12:04,485 --> 01:12:08,023
You're a fucking sperm donor.
You're not my father.

722
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:09,557
Just leave me alone.

723
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:38,520
Kat.

724
01:12:44,926 --> 01:12:47,029
I thought your book
was sad.

725
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,766
Everyone said that.

726
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:57,806
"There's no life
without you."

727
01:12:57,838 --> 01:12:59,140
You stole that
from someone.

728
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:01,176
I can't remember who.

729
01:13:06,146 --> 01:13:07,515
You know, I never
understood

730
01:13:07,548 --> 01:13:09,885
why he stayed
and she didn't.

731
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:13,654
He had a son.

732
01:13:13,688 --> 01:13:17,057
He lost his love.
He was pointless.

733
01:13:17,091 --> 01:13:20,095
Give me that gun.

734
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,595
And then we'll...

735
01:13:21,628 --> 01:13:23,798
Me and you will go
right now, okay?

736
01:13:23,832 --> 01:13:26,268
Let's get out of here.

737
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,971
I... I'll take care of us.

738
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:33,107
What's your fantasy?

739
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,246
I could love you.

740
01:13:43,851 --> 01:13:45,586
You already did.

741
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:47,756
No, no!

742
01:13:58,265 --> 01:14:02,069
<i>There was a book I had as a kid
about the monarch butterfly.</i>

743
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,884
<i>How it became itself.</i>

744
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:26,694
<i>The caterpillar
forms a chrysalis,</i>

745
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,163
<i>then dissolves into nothing.</i>

746
01:14:42,676 --> 01:14:44,278
<i>It dies.</i>

747
01:15:03,030 --> 01:15:05,132
<i>Inside isn't a prison.</i>

748
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:08,203
<i>It's an ocean of freedom...</i>

749
01:15:08,235 --> 01:15:11,172
<i>that stretches beyond
the stars in the sky.</i>

750
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:16,110
<i>It shows us the future.</i>

751
01:15:26,253 --> 01:15:29,891
<i>Then when it's ready,
it rises from nothing,</i>

752
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,470
<i>spreads its wings
and flies away.</i>

753
01:16:16,904 --> 01:16:19,408
<i>Now I can walk
the Great Wall of China.</i>

754
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:26,114
<i>And go to Spain
and run with the bulls.</i>

755
01:16:31,452 --> 01:16:33,855
<i>I could start something new.</i>

756
01:16:36,524 --> 01:16:38,860
<i>And wake up with the sun.</i>

757
01:16:53,908 --> 01:16:55,510
<i>I could love.</i>

758
01:16:56,944 --> 01:17:00,148
<i>And love and love.</i>
