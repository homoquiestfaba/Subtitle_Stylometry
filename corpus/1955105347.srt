Hell, if she was a snake,
she would've bit me.

150
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:03,620

151
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,690
somebody's gonna do the same
thing to me and I can't allow that.

152
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:08,025
So what I need you to do is send her down

153
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,827
<i>so I can tidy things up
a bit, you understand?</i>

154
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:13,063

Oh, yes, I know she will,

156
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:18,036

157
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:19,770
But you, on the other hand,

158
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:21,572
<i>you didn't see fuck all
except a masked gunman.</i>

159
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:23,941

160
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:27,378
All I want's the girl. So why
don't you send her on down here,

163
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:44,595

166
00:15:50,737 --> 00:15:53,937
The little lady's seen my face.

167
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:58,009
<i>Now she's got to pay the
price like everybody else.</i>

168
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:00,780
That's how it works.

169
00:16:02,681 --> 00:16:05,518
As far as you should be
concerned, she's already dead.

170
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:10,053
Now, the sooner you allow me

171
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,657
to prove that little point to you,

172
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:13,890
the sooner you can get back

173
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:16,661

174
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:19,900
- ( groans )
- <i>Now, I know you're bleeding up there.</i>

175
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:23,768
And that does make time a factor,

176
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,470
so here's what you're gonna do...

177
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:28,840
you're gonna send the girl down to me.

178
00:16:28,842 --> 00:16:31,642
Get yourself down to a
hospital. Get yourself fixed up.

179
00:16:31,644 --> 00:16:33,543
I'm gonna take care of my
business and that'll be that.

180
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:34,547
What do you say?

181
00:16:36,683 --> 00:16:38,383
<i>Believe me when I tell you, son,</i>

182
00:16:38,385 --> 00:16:40,851
you do not want to fight me on this thing.

183
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:44,122
This will only devolve
into a battle of wills

184
00:16:44,124 --> 00:16:46,727
and my will is stronger than
anyone you have ever met.

185
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,162
( sighs )

186
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:52,433
Yeah?

187
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:57,501
Well, you and me ain't never
been introduced, asshole.

188
00:16:57,503 --> 00:17:00,637
My name's Carter Greene. This is my house.

189
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,809
Now, so long as I'm still breathing,

190
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:08,078
you ain't gonna harm a
hair on this child's head.

191
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,448
Listen, you just send the
little lady down here right now.

192
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,682
This is not the time to play hero,

193
00:17:12,684 --> 00:17:15,853
and I am the last individual
on God's green earth

194
00:17:15,855 --> 00:17:17,888
that you wanna butt
heads with, you hear me?

195
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,990
Oh, yeah, I hear ya.

196
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:22,862
I hear ya and you sound real scary.

197
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:26,763
Fuck you, Farmer Jim!

198
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,800
You're all alone out here on the frontier.

199
00:17:29,802 --> 00:17:31,669
No friends, no family,

200
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,172
<i>no cops, no help at all.</i>

201
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,574
This is the Wild West, son.

202
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:39,042
The Wild fucking West.

203
00:17:39,044 --> 00:17:42,480
There ain't no gods coming
out here to save your ass.

204
00:17:42,482 --> 00:17:46,217
It's just you and me and a murder of crows

205
00:17:46,219 --> 00:17:48,853
waiting to pick over our dead bones.

206
00:17:48,855 --> 00:17:51,756
<i>So you take a breather.</i>

207
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,491
You let that sink in.

208
00:17:54,493 --> 00:17:58,462
But don't take too long, ya hear?

209
00:17:58,464 --> 00:17:59,696
You don't wanna get too much blood

210
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:02,168
all over your white trash fineries.

211
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,942
I need your help.

212
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:13,009
I want you to go in the
bathroom and get a first aid kit.

213
00:18:13,011 --> 00:18:14,647
It's under the sink. Go.

214
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:30,228
Come to papa.

215
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,096
Okay, set it down.

216
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,701
Open it up. Come here.

217
00:18:36,703 --> 00:18:38,672
You're gonna help me, okay?

218
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:43,774
Carter: <i>Pour this on.</i>

219
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:46,847
Okay. ( groans )

220
00:18:50,183 --> 00:18:52,149
( panting, groaning )

221
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:55,952
- ( screams )
- Get it real hot, okay?

222
00:18:55,954 --> 00:18:58,058
<i>Just hold it on there.</i>

223
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,096
All right, slowly put it down.

224
00:19:05,098 --> 00:19:06,700
Don't look.

225
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:12,772
- ( Carter screams )
- ( Sade screams )

226
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,213
Carter: More.

227
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:23,180
More, more, more. Come on.

228
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:25,486
There.

229
00:19:30,623 --> 00:19:32,826
You're supposed to swallow them.

230
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:40,631
Not when you hurt as bad as I do.

231
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:43,768
Go... go in the other room.

232
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,938
In a box there are some light bulbs, okay?

233
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,638
Bring me all of them.

234
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,609
And some water. Bring me some water.

235
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:54,848
<i>( footsteps creaking )</i>

236
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:06,760
I said all of them. Go.

237
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,968
And towels, bring me some towels.

238
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,740
The bathroom, go. Go.

239
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:26,613
Please.

240
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,028
Good.

241
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,045
<i>( glass shatters )</i>

242
00:21:13,126 --> 00:21:15,326
That ain't no farmer.

243
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:17,694
Now even if we're not here,

244
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,196
- we'll hear him if he tries going up the stairs.
- Cool.

245
00:21:20,198 --> 00:21:22,732
What's the water for?

246
00:21:22,734 --> 00:21:25,038
It's for drinking.

247
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,942
Oh.

248
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,311
Want some?

249
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,916
<i>( creaking )</i>

250
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,822
<i>( clatters )</i>

251
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:53,297
- So, what's your name?
- Isabelle.

252
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:56,200
But everyone calls me Bird.
I don't like it, though.

253
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:57,934
Bird?

254
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,971
How'd you get a colorful name like that?

255
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,007
My dad gave it to me.

256
00:22:03,009 --> 00:22:05,843
My mom said he started
calling me his little bird

257
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:08,315
when I was real small
'cause I never wanted to eat.

258
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,717
He died, though.

259
00:22:13,118 --> 00:22:14,919
They both did.

260
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:19,226
- Car crash.
- <i>( clattering )</i>

261
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:22,995
God, I'm...

262
00:22:24,196 --> 00:22:26,232
( exhales ) I'm sorry.

263
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:32,903
How'd you get in this mess, anyway?

264
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,939
He shot Roger at the cemetery.

265
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:37,807
- Roger?
- Aunt Jane's boyfriend.

266
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:39,943
( exhales )

267
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:43,213
Jesus. I'm sorry.

268
00:22:43,215 --> 00:22:45,816
You apologize a lot

269
00:22:45,818 --> 00:22:47,953
for someone who didn't do anything wrong.

270
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:52,056
I know. I... I just meant

271
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,157
you know, it's too bad your uncle's dead.

272
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,060
He wasn't my uncle.

273
00:22:57,062 --> 00:23:00,232
But I should've been nicer to him.

274
00:23:18,283 --> 00:23:20,286
- ( exhales )
- <i>( clattering )</i>

275
00:23:44,443 --> 00:23:46,879
He's a monster.

276
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,981
He's no monster. Hey.

277
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:54,884
Don't give him the satisfaction.

278
00:23:54,886 --> 00:23:56,487
He's no monster.

279
00:23:56,489 --> 00:23:59,192
Yes, he is.

280
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:04,428
You're all alone?

281
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,430
This big company just moved in

282
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,566
and this whole valley's a graveyard.

283
00:24:08,568 --> 00:24:12,138
The crops are alive,
but the houses are dead.

284
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,343
There's nobody here but scarecrows.

285
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:19,112
And you.

286
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:22,415
And me.

287
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:29,953
- <i>( ball bounces )</i>
- How many bullets do you have?

288
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:31,891
Just the one.

289
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,124
That's it?

290
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:38,162
<i>You don't have any more
packed in a box or something?</i>

291
00:24:38,164 --> 00:24:40,064
I'm afraid not.

292
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:42,465
Last shell in the house.

293
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,902
Don't worry, though.

294
00:24:44,904 --> 00:24:47,273
He doesn't know that.

295
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:50,441
Can we go out a window?

296
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:54,010
No. I mean, I'd never
make it with this leg.

297
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,645
You could climb out on your own.

298
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:58,449
But then I wouldn't be
there to protect you,

299
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:00,017
and that's just what he wants.

300
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:02,553
<i>No, we're stuck here
until help comes</i>

301
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,989
<i>or he leaves.</i>

302
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:07,892
<i>( clattering )</i>

303
00:25:07,894 --> 00:25:09,095
Thank you.

304
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,195
No, don't mention it, Isabelle.

305
00:25:12,197 --> 00:25:14,533
Just... just doing what's right.

306
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:17,604
Call me Bird if you want.

307
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:21,107
I thought you didn't like that name.

308
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:25,212
Depends on who's using it.

309
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,147
Well, pleased to meet you, Bird.

310
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:33,853
I'm Carter, in case you missed it.

311
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:45,194
( sighs )

312
00:25:45,196 --> 00:25:47,064
It's a nice camera you got there.

313
00:25:47,066 --> 00:25:49,935
What, are you taking pictures
of the cemetery or something?

314
00:25:51,971 --> 00:25:55,638
Him. I got a picture of
him without his mask on.

315
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,174
- Does he know that?
- I think so.

316
00:25:58,176 --> 00:26:00,512
Well, that's great. Give me the film.

317
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,586
Sade: <i>Hey, tough guy!</i>

318
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:11,622
<i>I was wondering.</i>

319
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:13,159
<i>Let me ask you.</i>

320
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:19,028
What's with all the boxes, huh?

321
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,533
- <i>( shatters )</i>
- ( coughing )

322
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:26,670
<i>Fixing to jump ship? Hmm?</i>

323
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,638
<i>I bet you wished you'd
scheduled the big move</i>

324
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,911
a day earlier, huh? ( chuckles )

325
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,278
So, hey, man,

326
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,082
what happened to your family, huh?

327
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:40,487
What, they up and leave your sorry ass?

328
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:45,622
<i>Is this a broken
home I'm sitting in?</i>

329
00:26:45,624 --> 00:26:48,124
Come on, badass, talk to me!

330
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,326
Don't be shy!

331
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:52,565
Shit, you can confide in me.

332
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:57,267
Whoa, whoa! Lookie here.

333
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:59,470
Soldier boy.

334
00:26:59,472 --> 00:27:02,205
You're a soldier boy.

335
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:04,674
Damn good one from the
looks of this photograph.

336
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:07,144
Look at you, all spit and polish

337
00:27:07,146 --> 00:27:09,413
with your shiny medals
and your pretty ribbons.

338
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:11,414
<i>Hey, where... where were you?</i>

339
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,083
<i>Huh?</i>

340
00:27:13,085 --> 00:27:14,785
Hey, look, I'm ex-military, too, man.

341
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:17,520
Black ops, you know, real
jackal shit. Where were you?

342
00:27:17,522 --> 00:27:20,423
Iraq? No, no, no.

343
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,593
Afghanistan.

344
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,260
Hey, Sar. Greene!

345
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:27,698
Hey, Sar. Greene, as one
ex-military man to another,

346
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,567
I salute you

347
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:33,440
and thank you for your service. ( chuckles )

348
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:37,607
Damn.

349
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:40,109
Nice-looking woman you had there, boy.

350
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:43,047
Real nice-looking.

351
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:44,347
<i>Hey, you don't mind
if I get her number</i>

352
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:45,715
<i>when this is all over, do you?</i>

353
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:47,483
- Just shut up!
- Hey!

354
00:27:47,485 --> 00:27:50,554
- <i>Shut your fucking mouth!</i>
- ( laughs )

355
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:52,756
Oh, come on, Sar. Greene!

356
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:55,328
I'm just fucking with you a little bit.

357
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,064

Hey, uh,

361
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:09,440
just wanna thank you.

362
00:28:09,442 --> 00:28:12,241
Took the liberty of dipping
into your little reserve.

363
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:14,478
I've been feeling nice and warm.

364

<i>I hope you got something up there
to keep the chill away, too.</i>

365

Oh, and, uh,

367
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,554

Uh, nothing I wouldn't
do for that little girl.

374
00:28:38,203 --> 00:28:39,670
I mean, that's why I'm
in this line of work.

375
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,538
You know, I got a family that depends on me

376
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,575

loose end with a ponytail

377
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:46,442
take 'em away from me, can I?

378

the life of a stranger or...

382
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,221

The kid stays with me, all right?

396

Hey, don't talk like that, okay?

535
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:32,321
Help will be here soon.

536
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:36,095
Don't say that, Carter. I'm not stupid.

537
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:40,229
All right.

538
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:42,867
Maybe help ain't coming.

539
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:46,236
( sighs )

540
00:39:46,238 --> 00:39:48,307
But I can promise you this...

541
00:39:50,876 --> 00:39:53,075
I won't let him get you.

542
00:39:53,077 --> 00:39:55,246
<i>You hear me?</i>

543
00:39:56,948 --> 00:39:59,785
I won't let him get you.

544
00:40:02,419 --> 00:40:04,889
You believe me?

545
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,995
Why'd your wife leave?

546
00:40:13,865 --> 00:40:15,430
Me.

547
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:17,802
This place.

548
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:23,138
Reminded, uh, her

549
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,776
of him.

550
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:28,748
I just wish...

551
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:32,582
( exhales )

552
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:34,419
<i>just...</i>

553
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,388
<i>wish...</i>

554
00:40:43,562 --> 00:40:45,297
I believe you.

555
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:51,935
- <i>( gunshot )</i>
- ( Bird gasps )

556
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:53,535
<i>( Bird's footsteps pounding )</i>

557
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:56,407
Just keeping you on your toes, buddy.

558
00:40:57,876 --> 00:40:58,975
Here, have another one.

559
00:40:58,977 --> 00:41:01,446
<i>( gunshot echoes )</i>

560
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:14,357
How y'all doing up there?

561
00:41:14,359 --> 00:41:16,392
Carter: <i>I could ask
you the same question,</i>

562
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:18,093
<i>you loose sack of shit!</i>

563
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:20,897
You know, you sound like a sick animal

564
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:23,533
who's hunting around
for a corner to die in.

565
00:41:23,535 --> 00:41:26,269
<i>You feeling kind of cold?</i>

566
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:27,937
<i>Kind of weak?</i>

567
00:41:27,939 --> 00:41:29,906
<i>Yeah.</i>

568
00:41:29,908 --> 00:41:32,140
<i>You're going into shock, pal.</i>

569
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:34,644
<i>Gonna die.</i>

570
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:37,479
<i>Soon unless you get to a hospital.</i>

571
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:40,149
Fuck you! I'm fine!

572
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:42,252
<i>I ain't going nowhere</i>

573
00:41:42,254 --> 00:41:44,453
<i>till that little bitch
is pushing up daisies!</i>

574
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:48,290
- <i>Period!</i>
- That suits me just fine, mister.

575
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,959
Nothing bleeds forever.

576
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,428
<i>Another few hours,</i>

577
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,031
<i>you'll be lying facedown</i>

578
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:57,332
<i>in a puddle of your own fluids.</i>

579
00:41:57,334 --> 00:41:59,201
Hey, don't worry, though.

580
00:41:59,203 --> 00:42:01,069
I'll let your daughter know you died

581
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:03,640
<i>defending the future of your family.</i>

582
00:42:03,642 --> 00:42:06,341
Oh, outstanding, Sergeant Greene.

583
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:08,144
Out-fucking-standing.

584
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:10,078
You beat me at my own game.

585
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,549
You're a master of psychological warfare!

586
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:14,917
Next thing you know,

587
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:16,919
you'll have me tidying up the place

588
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:19,221
and giving you a blowjob on the way out.

589
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:21,256
<i>Brilliant!</i>

590
00:42:21,258 --> 00:42:22,491
<i>( camera shutter clicks )</i>

591
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,593
- Sorry.
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

592
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:27,398
No film in that camera.

593
00:42:29,234 --> 00:42:31,301
Yeah, it just makes me feel safe.

594
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:32,538
It's stupid, I know.

595
00:42:35,073 --> 00:42:37,443
We all got our ways of dealing with stuff.

596
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:50,218
What? What is it?

597
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,520
<i>Shh.</i>

598
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:54,357
Just reminds me...

599
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:56,158
we got a problem.

600
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,227
How big?

601
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:00,330
It's big.

602
00:43:00,332 --> 00:43:02,732
There's a generator in the basement

603
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:04,334
that runs the whole power, you see?

604
00:43:04,336 --> 00:43:06,171
I haven't filled it up in days.

605
00:43:07,472 --> 00:43:09,504
It's running on fumes.

606
00:43:09,506 --> 00:43:12,008
I don't understand.

607
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:13,977
It'll be night soon, Bird.

608
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:16,345
Without any power, the whole
house will be pitch-black.

609
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:18,046
<i>There's no way I can keep him</i>

610
00:43:18,048 --> 00:43:19,582
from trying something in the dark.

611
00:43:19,584 --> 00:43:21,750
Not with one shot.

612
00:43:21,752 --> 00:43:23,521
What does that mean?

613
00:43:26,256 --> 00:43:28,390
It means I gotta get you out of here

614
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,727
while it's still light out.

615
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:33,363
But your leg.

616
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:36,332
I'm not going with you.

617
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:39,067
I'm gonna help you climb out a
window so you can run for help.

618
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:41,537
- But you said that's what he wants!
- I know what I said, Bird,

619
00:43:41,539 --> 00:43:43,006
but things are different now, okay?

620
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:44,774
You gotta trust me on this.

621
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:47,576
This is your best chance.

622
00:43:47,578 --> 00:43:49,981
<i>Okay?</i>

623
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:00,960
Oh, fuck.

624
00:44:08,265 --> 00:44:10,165
Hey, is the, uh,

625
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,734
shooting range on Red
Pepper open for the fall yet?

626
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,370
Dispatch: <i>What's that, kid?</i>

627
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:17,540
The shooting range on Red Pepper,

628
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,207
is it open now?

629
00:44:19,209 --> 00:44:21,310
<i>Nope. Why?</i>

630
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,712
I... I'm not sure, I, uh...

631
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:26,452
I'm at the cemetery and I heard...

632
00:44:28,385 --> 00:44:30,621
<i>What's that? What did you hear, kid?</i>

633
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:34,256
<i>Kid?</i>

634
00:44:34,258 --> 00:44:37,192
Nothing. Uh...

635
00:44:37,194 --> 00:44:39,529
I'm gonna look into something.
I'll get back to you.

636
00:44:39,531 --> 00:44:42,201
And stop calling me "kid."

637
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:45,670
( engine starts )

638
00:44:59,584 --> 00:45:01,183
All right, let's go.

639
00:45:01,185 --> 00:45:02,819
What if he realizes you aren't guarding

640
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:04,453
the stairs anymore?

641
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,288
We got the broken glass.
We'll hear him. Come on.

642
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,323
Now, I want you to climb
down on this roof, right?

643
00:45:08,325 --> 00:45:09,758
There's a crate. Jump down on it.

644
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,261
Run like hell, all right?

645
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:14,663
Hey, hey. Even if he hears you,

646
00:45:14,665 --> 00:45:17,366
you'll be a little speck on the
horizon by the time he gets outside.

647
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:19,569
- I don't wanna do this.
- Neither do I, Bird,

648
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:21,870
but we have to. We don't have a choice.

649
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:24,475
<i>( floorboards creaking )</i>

650
00:45:44,863 --> 00:45:47,363
- Come on. Give me the camera.
- No.

651
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:48,897
Come on, I'll take good care of it.

652
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:51,369
Don't you trust me? Come on.

653
00:45:52,736 --> 00:45:54,439
Bird, I...

654
00:45:56,207 --> 00:45:58,510
Okay, keep the camera. Come on. Go.

655
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:01,743
That's it.

656
00:46:01,745 --> 00:46:03,548
Stay low.

657
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:07,385
Okay, go. Come on.

658
00:46:10,455 --> 00:46:12,691
That's it, you got it.

659
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:38,382
<i>( knocking )</i>

660
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:44,854
- <i>( knocking )</i>
- ( gunshot )

661
00:46:44,856 --> 00:46:47,689
<i>( gasps, clattering )</i>

662
00:46:47,691 --> 00:46:49,827
<i>( thudding )</i>

663
00:46:53,263 --> 00:46:55,166
( panting )

664
00:46:56,834 --> 00:46:58,636
Afternoon, Officer.

665
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,642
- What the fuck?
- ( screams )

666
00:47:04,876 --> 00:47:06,544
Shit.

667
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:15,917
( gun clicking )

668
00:47:15,919 --> 00:47:18,756
Shit!

669
00:47:25,997 --> 00:47:27,499
( thuds )

670
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,698
- Carter!
- What?

671
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,337
He hid the police car in the hangar.

672
00:48:11,408 --> 00:48:13,477
What? Where is he now?

673
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:17,412
He's far.

674
00:48:17,414 --> 00:48:19,817
He's walking back around the front.

675
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:28,624
Freeze!

676
00:48:28,626 --> 00:48:30,558
Put your fucking hands up in the air.

677
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,997
Hands up. That's right.

678
00:48:34,298 --> 00:48:35,531
It's over.

679
00:48:35,533 --> 00:48:37,433
It's time for you to leave.

680
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:39,035
I ain't got my glasses on,

681
00:48:39,037 --> 00:48:41,504
but that looks like that
same candy-ass 20 gauge

682
00:48:41,506 --> 00:48:43,372
you've been counting on this whole time.

683
00:48:43,374 --> 00:48:46,408
Heavy on power, shit for range?

684
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,711
That's all you got, ain't it?

685
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:52,381
You got until the count of five

686
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:56,051
to turn around and get
the fuck off my property!

687
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:57,653
You got to be kidding me.

688
00:48:57,655 --> 00:48:58,953
You probably couldn't even nick me

689
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:00,756
with that potty trainer from up there,

690
00:49:00,758 --> 00:49:02,591
let alone make a kill shot.

691
00:49:02,593 --> 00:49:05,560
Hell, how many bullets
you got left, Jethro?

692
00:49:05,562 --> 00:49:07,330
I got plenty!

693
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:08,531
All right?

694
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,698
Don't you worry about it.

695
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,401
I got six reloads waiting on your ass!

696
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:14,837
Good God damn, six reloads?

697
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:16,839
<i>Whoo, you're practically swimming</i>

698
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:18,374
<i>in ammunition up there.</i>

699
00:49:18,376 --> 00:49:20,408
Well, why not go ahead and try your luck?

700
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,645
You might sink a pellet
in my eye, take me down.

701
00:49:22,647 --> 00:49:24,647
Come on, what you waiting on?

702
00:49:24,649 --> 00:49:27,783
- Fire away!
- I'm not gonna kill you if I don't have to.

703
00:49:27,785 --> 00:49:29,352
When I first got to this dump,

704
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,520
you spit fire at me just to say howdy do.

705
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:32,821
Now you wanna play trigger-shy?

706
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,656
I don't buy that for a minute.

707
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:38,660
Are you riding on just one
shell up there, partner?

708
00:49:38,662 --> 00:49:40,995
<i>You are, aren't you?</i>

709
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:43,031
<i>And if you take the shot at me</i>

710
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,968
at this range and miss, it's over.

711
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,537
<i>I don't think you can
afford to take that risk.</i>

712
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:50,508
<i>Let's ask the little lady.</i>

713
00:49:52,776 --> 00:49:54,410
Five.

714
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:56,011
I ain't going nowhere.

715
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:57,846
You might as well save your
breath, go on and shoot.

716
00:49:57,848 --> 00:50:00,383
- Four.
- Look, I'm fitting to pull my pistol out

717
00:50:00,385 --> 00:50:02,051
- and shoot you now.
- Three!

718
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:03,785
I suggest you either shoot me

719
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:05,955
- or get your ass back inside.
- Two!

720
00:50:05,957 --> 00:50:07,693
- One!
- Shit!

721
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:12,093
I ain't calling you a liar, Sar. Greene,

722
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,464
but you got to be the most
merciful man I ever met.

723
00:50:15,466 --> 00:50:18,033
Hey, little lady. ( laughs )

724
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:20,870
I just wanna shoot you.

725
00:50:20,872 --> 00:50:23,738
Hey, you made the right call, soldier boy!

726
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,875
Yes, indeed! Who are you to gamble

727
00:50:25,877 --> 00:50:27,877
with that little girl's life?

728
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:31,383
Let's see if you gamble
with somebody else's.

729
00:50:36,421 --> 00:50:37,953
Sade: <i>Roll call!</i>

730
00:50:37,955 --> 00:50:40,089
That's you, Enis.

731
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:42,424
- Come on.
- ( gasps )

732
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:45,093
- Tell us a little bit about yourself.
- You sick son of a bitch.

733
00:50:45,095 --> 00:50:47,796
Don't you disappoint me, hillbilly.

734
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,499
And speak up

735
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:52,968
so the man upstairs can hear you.

736
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,703
( panting ) My...

737
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:56,839
my name is Officer Gerald Baker.

738
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:00,575
Sade: <i>Jerry Baker! ( laughs )</i>

739
00:51:00,577 --> 00:51:03,712
Oh, tell us about, uh...
about the wife and kids,

740
00:51:03,714 --> 00:51:06,482
- two-cow garage.
- I have a wife

741
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:09,017
- <i>and a son.</i>
- <i>Names, damn it! Give the man names!</i>

742
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:11,620
<i>My wife's name is Linda</i>

743
00:51:11,622 --> 00:51:13,988
- <i>and my son's name...</i>
- All right, cut it out!

744
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,058
<i>This ain't gonna work!</i>

745
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,694
<i>Just save yourself the effort.</i>

746
00:51:18,696 --> 00:51:20,629
You need to think about it, Sar. Greene.

747
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:22,163
You need to think about it real hard,

748
00:51:22,165 --> 00:51:24,500
<i>get your mind right, see?</i>

749
00:51:24,502 --> 00:51:26,769
- ( sobbing )
- Jerry here ain't seen my face,

750
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,703
just like you, which means,

751
00:51:28,705 --> 00:51:30,738
technically, he's off the hook.

752
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:32,975
Also, he's not hurt too bad,

753
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:35,611
which means you can probably
get him to the hospital.

754
00:51:35,613 --> 00:51:36,912
<i>But you're gonna have
to do it right quick,</i>

755
00:51:36,914 --> 00:51:38,948
<i>I mean, like, pronto.</i>

756
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,950
You don't have the leverage
that you think you do, asshole.

757
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:42,517
Fuck leverage!

758
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,053
Do the math, dipshit!

759
00:51:44,055 --> 00:51:46,120
You send the little lady
down to me right now,

760
00:51:46,122 --> 00:51:49,258
you're saving two lives
in exchange for one.

761
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,026
Not to toot my own horn, but
that's a hell of a bargain.

762
00:51:52,028 --> 00:51:54,095
Fuck you!

763
00:51:54,097 --> 00:51:55,964
Okay, you heard it, Jer.

764
00:51:55,966 --> 00:51:57,602
Have it your way.

765
00:52:01,071 --> 00:52:03,238
Oh, quit your whining.

766
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,040
Hold on, hold on. I got
something here for you.

767
00:52:06,042 --> 00:52:07,977
- <i>Here we go.</i>
- No. ( sobs )

768
00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:09,912
All right.

769
00:52:09,914 --> 00:52:12,982
That's it. Oh, yeah. That's
it, that's it. All right.

770
00:52:12,984 --> 00:52:14,216
What are you doing?

771
00:52:14,218 --> 00:52:15,553
Stand back now.

772
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,656

- ( screams )

- ( bone crunches )
- Oh, God!

775
00:52:33,671 --> 00:52:35,604
What's he even doing?

776
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:37,105
- ( Baker screams )
- Go. Get out of here.

777
00:52:37,107 --> 00:52:38,908
Go. Go upstairs.

778
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:42,076
Get upstairs now! Go.

779
00:52:42,078 --> 00:52:44,249
- Don't listen!
- <i>( bone crunches )</i>

780
00:52:47,184 --> 00:52:48,950
Four down, four to go!

781
00:52:48,952 --> 00:52:51,185
- Your thumbs get a pass.
- Oh, you sick fuck!

782
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:53,988
Listen up, soldier boy!
What's it gonna be?!

783
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:57,191
Me and Jerry Baker are waiting
for you to send her ass down!

784
00:52:57,193 --> 00:52:58,993
You piece of shit!

785
00:52:58,995 --> 00:53:01,629
You're a piece of fucking
shit, you know that?

786
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:03,167
Sticks and stones, my friend.

787
00:53:04,901 --> 00:53:06,972
All right, have it your way.

788
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:11,941
Stay with me. It's just you and me.

789
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:13,611
Please stop! ( sobs )

790
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:19,149

- ( screams )

- <i>( hammer thuds )</i>
- <i>( Baker sobs )</i>

793
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:38,767
I was gonna start with the toes,

794
00:53:38,769 --> 00:53:42,104
but I guess I lost the
stomach for the hard stuff.

795
00:53:42,106 --> 00:53:44,372
( sobbing )

796
00:53:44,374 --> 00:53:47,075
Hey, listen, partner.

797
00:53:47,077 --> 00:53:49,678
<i>It's decision time.</i>

798
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,050
( sobs ) Please, no.

799
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,651
Please.

800
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,252
- Listen, man!
- ( sobs ) No.

801
00:53:58,254 --> 00:54:01,357
If you don't send that
little girl down here

802
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:04,759
with that film, and I mean right now,

803
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:08,663
I'm fixing to Jackson
Pollock Jerry Baker's brains

804

<i>all over the motherfucking floor.</i>

805
00:54:12,135 --> 00:54:13,935
Man,

806
00:54:13,937 --> 00:54:16,071
you kill that guy, it's 'cause you want to!

807
00:54:16,073 --> 00:54:17,906
<i>You're just looking for an excuse!</i>

808
00:54:17,908 --> 00:54:19,841
You wanna kill somebody?!

809
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:21,343
You go ahead!

810
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,678
<i>You got fucking brain damage!</i>

811
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,046
You're a sick fuck

812
00:54:25,048 --> 00:54:26,381
and you want to!

813
00:54:26,383 --> 00:54:28,619
- Not because...

<i>( clattering )</i>

815
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:52,644
A simple yes or no would've worked.

816
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:58,046
But, you know, you done
really pissed me off, Jethro.

817
00:54:58,048 --> 00:55:01,883
Matter of fact, you done lost
all your conversation privileges.

818
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:03,384
Yeah!

819
00:55:03,386 --> 00:55:05,854
Radio silence starts right now!

820
00:55:05,856 --> 00:55:07,355
And it ends when you're ready

821
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:08,991
to send the little girl down.

822
00:55:08,993 --> 00:55:12,326
Well, that suits me just fine, asshole.

823
00:55:12,328 --> 00:55:14,698
I'm sick of hearing your
goddamn voice anyway.

824
00:55:18,002 --> 00:55:19,767
Just do me a favor... when you drop dead,

825
00:55:19,769 --> 00:55:21,069
just do it real loud, okay,

826
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:23,107
so I can hear it from up here.

827
00:55:29,879 --> 00:55:31,682
<i>( insects chirping )</i>

828
00:55:48,131 --> 00:55:50,367
Hey, asshole.

829
00:55:59,243 --> 00:56:02,113
I don't hear him walking around anymore.

830
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:07,251
What's he doing?

831
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,330
Let's find out.

832
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,233
All right, cocksucker.

833
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:26,535
All right, you win.

834
00:56:26,537 --> 00:56:28,270
I gotta...

835
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:31,339
I gotta get to a hospital, man.

836
00:56:31,341 --> 00:56:33,441
You... you can have her.

837
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:34,945
<i>You can have the girl, okay?</i>

838
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,350
You hear me? You win.

839
00:56:41,352 --> 00:56:44,086
I'm sending her down, all right?

840
00:56:44,088 --> 00:56:45,553
Just...

841
00:56:45,555 --> 00:56:47,089
Just get the fuck out of here

842
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,993
when I do, okay?

843
00:56:58,368 --> 00:56:59,738
He ain't down there.

844
00:57:02,272 --> 00:57:04,038
He must've gone outside again.

845
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:06,241
I'm gonna sneak down there,
wait for him to come back in,

846
00:57:06,243 --> 00:57:07,810
and blow him in half.

847
00:57:07,812 --> 00:57:09,243
- It's a trick.
- No, no.

848
00:57:09,245 --> 00:57:11,013
I just offered you up like he wants.

849
00:57:11,015 --> 00:57:13,247
That trumps anything else he's got cooking.

850
00:57:13,249 --> 00:57:16,517
He ain't talking back
'cause he ain't down there.

851
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:18,486
No, he's waiting for you!

852
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:21,857
Get in the bathroom. Lock the door.

853
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,892
- Carter, don't go.
- No time to argue.

854
00:57:24,894 --> 00:57:27,296
Now get in there. Go. Now.

Ow! Yeah, this just
really ain't your day, pal.

01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:39,776
close your eyes and never open them again.

890
01:02:41,444 --> 01:02:43,113
Go fuck yourself.

891
01:02:44,314 --> 01:02:46,314
<i>What?</i>

892
01:02:46,316 --> 01:02:47,848
Trying to help you.

893
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:51,586
Bleeding to death's not
such a bad way to go.

894
01:02:51,588 --> 01:02:54,788
You just kind of drift off.

895
01:02:54,790 --> 01:02:58,428
Yeah, what dead motherfucker
did you hear that from?

896
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:04,432
You know, I'm surprised you
haven't called for backup.

897
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:07,301
Backup? Ha!

898
01:03:07,303 --> 01:03:09,303
( groans )

899
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:11,238
That little girl IDs me,

900
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,544
it's my ass, not my employer's.

901
01:03:15,946 --> 01:03:18,879
My witness, my problem.

902
01:03:18,881 --> 01:03:22,417
I'm a contractor, mister.

903
01:03:22,419 --> 01:03:24,919
A professional, huh?

904
01:03:24,921 --> 01:03:28,355
I don't lose. I don't ask for help.

905
01:03:28,357 --> 01:03:30,691
That's what keeps me employed.

906
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:32,894
Yeah, well,

907
01:03:32,896 --> 01:03:35,263
that's what's gonna put
you in the ground, too,

908
01:03:35,265 --> 01:03:37,732
if you don't throw the
towel in soon, buddy.

909
01:03:37,734 --> 01:03:40,968
I mean, what the fuck are we doing, man?

910
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:43,404
This is like a pissing contest for you.

911
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:44,872
Life ain't nothing

912
01:03:44,874 --> 01:03:46,508
but one big fucking

913
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:48,776
pissing contest, soldier boy.

914
01:03:48,778 --> 01:03:50,678
Ain't you been paying attention?

915
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,580
Shit.

916
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:55,984
I don't die unless the
motherfucker trying to kill me

917
01:03:55,986 --> 01:03:57,252
earns it.

918
01:03:57,254 --> 01:03:58,953
<i>You ain't earned it.</i>

919
01:03:58,955 --> 01:04:01,689
<i>I'll be damned if I let
some chickenshit like you</i>

920
01:04:01,691 --> 01:04:04,258
<i>take me out.</i>

921
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,830
( sighs ) This ain't about me.

922
01:04:08,631 --> 01:04:11,399
I'm not the guy you're fighting, am I?

923
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:13,734
Yeah.

924
01:04:13,736 --> 01:04:16,773
<i>I think I'm starting to understand.</i>

925
01:04:18,542 --> 01:04:22,410
You'll never understand
a man like me, chump.

926
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:25,683
Are you really the monster
you want me to think you are?

927
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,850
You don't have a daughter, do ya?

928
01:04:29,852 --> 01:04:31,819
Yeah, I got a daughter.

929
01:04:31,821 --> 01:04:33,687
What, you think monsters don't breed?

930
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:36,860
How do you get to be what you are?

931
01:04:38,794 --> 01:04:41,529
Oh, what the fuck is it with you?

932
01:04:41,531 --> 01:04:44,366
You wanna be my friend,
you wanna be my shrink?

933
01:04:44,368 --> 01:04:46,734
Huh? Or did you just fall in love

934
01:04:46,736 --> 01:04:49,571
with the velvet baritone of my voice?

935
01:04:49,573 --> 01:04:51,406
Come on, man.

936
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:54,375
( exhales ) You wanna know,

937
01:04:54,377 --> 01:04:56,948
tough guy, huh?

938
01:04:58,347 --> 01:05:00,383
<i>How you get to be like me?</i>

939
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:09,390
Oh, Jesus.

940
01:05:09,392 --> 01:05:11,459
Oh, let's see.

941
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:13,727
Oh, yeah.

942
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:16,698
The first guy I killed,

943
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,868
it broke me up a bit.

944
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,970
No, a lot.

945
01:05:21,972 --> 01:05:24,406
I couldn't eat.

946
01:05:24,408 --> 01:05:26,908
Couldn't sleep.

947
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,977
Couldn't even look myself in the mirror.

948
01:05:29,979 --> 01:05:32,846
Then something strange happened.

949
01:05:32,848 --> 01:05:35,984
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

950
01:05:35,986 --> 01:05:39,053
Killed another fellow,
I felt a little better.

951
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:41,689
Fellow after that, better.

952
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:44,926
Pretty soon, the more
jobs I got under my belt,

953
01:05:44,928 --> 01:05:47,897
the easier I slept at night.

954
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,633
How many people did that take?

955
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:54,468
I don't know. I don't count.

956
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,404
Let's just say

957
01:05:56,406 --> 01:05:59,741
these days I sleep like a baby.

958
01:05:59,743 --> 01:06:01,743
I don't know.

959
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,877
I don't know how you could
live with something like that.

960
01:06:03,879 --> 01:06:06,714
Well, something I read once, uh,

961
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:09,019
stuck with me.

962
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,323
"He who makes a beast of himself...

963
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:18,359
loses the pain of being a man.

964
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:20,430
Well,

965
01:06:21,832 --> 01:06:24,435
we all got our ways of dealing with stuff.

966
01:06:26,702 --> 01:06:28,770
Guess for you, it's killing people.

967
01:06:28,772 --> 01:06:30,839
I kill 'cause it's my job.

968
01:06:30,841 --> 01:06:32,674
I take orders.

969
01:06:32,676 --> 01:06:35,542
You were a soldier, you
know what that's like.

970
01:06:35,544 --> 01:06:36,910
<i>Don't pull that card, pal.</i>

971
01:06:36,912 --> 01:06:39,046
We don't kill kids.

972
01:06:39,048 --> 01:06:41,582
I kill for two reasons...
money and necessity.

973
01:06:41,584 --> 01:06:43,917
I don't kill for pleasure,

974
01:06:43,919 --> 01:06:46,087
I never have, I never will.

975
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:48,089
Why don't we roll out Jerry Baker

976
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:49,957
and ask him how he feels about that, huh?

977
01:06:49,959 --> 01:06:53,930
That was an intimidation
tactic, pure and simple.

978
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,732
But I'm gonna do whatever's necessary

979
01:06:57,734 --> 01:06:59,770
to get ahold of that girl, you know that.

980
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:02,872
<i>She's gotta go.</i>

981
01:07:05,975 --> 01:07:07,508
You don't look the devil in the face

982
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:09,546
without taking the ride
to the bottom floor.

983
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:12,913
The devil?

984
01:07:12,915 --> 01:07:15,883
You really are fucked in
the head, you know that?

985
01:07:15,885 --> 01:07:18,788
Oh, so now I'm crazy, huh?

986
01:07:21,957 --> 01:07:23,993
Well, one of us must be.

987
01:07:35,004 --> 01:07:37,006
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

988
01:07:50,953 --> 01:07:52,722
Bird: <i>Carter.</i>

989
01:07:53,923 --> 01:07:56,860
<i>What? You okay?</i>

990
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:10,540
What's the matter?

991
01:08:12,107 --> 01:08:15,044
I'm sorry I got you into this.

992
01:08:17,614 --> 01:08:19,750
Got me into this.

993
01:08:21,985 --> 01:08:23,487
Bird.

994
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,458
Hey. Hey.

995
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:31,796
We were put together for a reason.

996
01:08:40,035 --> 01:08:41,806
Lucky.

997
01:08:56,285 --> 01:08:58,823
- <i>( car approaching )</i>
- ( groans )

998
01:09:40,062 --> 01:09:41,828
<i>( car door shuts )</i>

999
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:44,001
<i>( footsteps thudding )</i>

1000
01:09:52,074 --> 01:09:54,144
What took you so long?

1001
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:58,548
- <i>( thudding )</i>
- <i>( faint chatter )</i>

1002
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,353
Sade: <i>Hey, partner!</i>

1003
01:10:06,355 --> 01:10:08,822
<i>Got somebody down here
who wants to talk to you.</i>

1004
01:10:08,824 --> 01:10:10,293
<i>Go on, speak up, darling.</i>

1005
01:10:13,696 --> 01:10:15,129
Woman: <i>Carter!</i>

1006
01:10:15,131 --> 01:10:16,930
Mara!

1007
01:10:16,932 --> 01:10:18,299
Sade: <i>Bingo!</i>

1008
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:20,268
Found her number in your phone.

1009
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,303
Gave her a call.

1010
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:25,206
Told her I was a friend of yours.

1011
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:28,142
That I was real worried about you.

1012
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:30,277
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1013
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:31,979
<i>( chuckles )</i>

1014
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:33,814
<i>That you needed to see her bad,</i>

1015
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:36,149
<i>but you couldn't bring
yourself to make the call.</i>

1016
01:10:36,151 --> 01:10:38,118
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

1017
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:41,221
Being the close, loyal friend that I am.

1018
01:10:41,223 --> 01:10:43,390
This poor woman drove
half the night to get here,

1019
01:10:43,392 --> 01:10:45,259
ain't that right, ma'am?

1020
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:48,161
Carter, I'm sorry.

1021
01:10:48,163 --> 01:10:50,764
He told me you were drinking.

1022
01:10:50,766 --> 01:10:52,066
I was worried about you.

1023
01:10:52,068 --> 01:10:53,401
- I'm sor...
- You hush now, hear?

1024
01:10:53,403 --> 01:10:55,303
So, what's it gonna be, Sergeant Greene?

1025
01:10:55,305 --> 01:10:57,104
<i>Looks like we got
our tiebreaker, huh?</i>

1026
01:10:57,106 --> 01:10:59,273
If you fucking hurt her, man,

1027
01:10:59,275 --> 01:11:01,408
I swear to fucking Christ

1028
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:03,111
you will never get this kid!

1029
01:11:03,113 --> 01:11:05,278
- You understand?!
- <i>( chuckles )</i>

1030
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,648
Somehow I doubt that, soldier boy.

1031
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:10,852
But besides, she ain't seen my face yet.

1032
01:11:10,854 --> 01:11:13,020
- Have you, darling?
- ( sobs )

1033
01:11:13,022 --> 01:11:15,089
Sade: <i>No.</i>

1034
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:17,425
<i>Just like our old friend
Jerry Baker. You remember him?</i>

1035
01:11:17,427 --> 01:11:19,193
<i>That's right. If you don't
send the kid down here,</i>

1036
01:11:19,195 --> 01:11:20,928
<i>she's gonna get the same thing.</i>

1037
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:22,964
This time, I'm not gonna be soft about it.

1038
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:24,765
You understand?

1039
01:11:24,767 --> 01:11:27,434
I'm gonna do some real exploring.

1040
01:11:27,436 --> 01:11:29,903
- ( sobs )
- Really open her up,

1041
01:11:29,905 --> 01:11:32,005
see what she can do.

1042
01:11:32,007 --> 01:11:33,808
<i>Now you get your mind right</i>

1043
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:35,910
<i>and you send the girl
down here with that film,</i>

1044
01:11:35,912 --> 01:11:37,944
<i>and you can have your wife back</i>

1045
01:11:37,946 --> 01:11:40,281
and y'all can get on back
to your happily ever after.

1046
01:11:40,283 --> 01:11:41,983
How do I know I can trust you?

1047
01:11:41,985 --> 01:11:43,751
You can't.

1048
01:11:43,753 --> 01:11:45,853
But if she was my wife,

1049
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:48,089
I'd take the chance just the same.

1050
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:50,390
<i>And seeing as we're
here on your property,</i>

1051
01:11:50,392 --> 01:11:52,193
<i>I'm gonna be real courteous</i>

1052
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:54,261
<i>and I'm gonna give you

He tries to come up them stairs,

1066
01:12:30,232 --> 01:12:31,432
you shoot him.

1067
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:33,367
It'll knock you on your ass,

1068
01:12:33,369 --> 01:12:36,103
but you'll hit him if you
aim down the stairs, okay?

1069
01:12:36,105 --> 01:12:38,840
- It aims real wide.
- <i>Three!</i>

1070
01:12:38,842 --> 01:12:40,444
What? No, what are you doing?

1071
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:44,748
I'm gonna go see my son.

1072
01:12:47,316 --> 01:12:50,117
- Carter...
- Shh.

1073
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:51,421
<i>Two!</i>

1074
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:55,322
<i>Come on, Sergeant Greene!</i>

1075
01:12:55,324 --> 01:12:57,060
- <i>Don't be stupid!</i>
- ( sobs )

1076
01:12:59,128 --> 01:13:01,228
- All right, that's it. One!
- No!

1077
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,898
<i>All right! Okay.</i>

1078
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:06,000
You made the right choice.

1079
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:08,301
I'm proud of you.

1080
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:10,203
Now you come on, you send her down,

1081
01:13:10,205 --> 01:13:12,406
you can have your wife.

1082
01:13:12,408 --> 01:13:15,079
<i>( glass crunches )</i>

1083
01:13:18,547 --> 01:13:20,447
Carter. ( gasps )

1084
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:22,349
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1085
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:23,886
- Are you okay? ( gasps )
- Shh!

1086
01:13:26,855 --> 01:13:29,991
Well, not that it ain't
nice to see your ugly mug,

1087
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:33,126
but what the fuck are you doing?

1088
01:13:33,128 --> 01:13:34,929
I couldn't do it, man.

1089
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:36,831
I can't send that little girl down here.

1090
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:39,233
I can see that! Where's the 20 gauge?

1091
01:13:39,235 --> 01:13:40,867
She's got it.

1092
01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:43,136
You want her?

1093
01:13:43,138 --> 01:13:44,871
Go get her.

1094
01:13:44,873 --> 01:13:47,175
Are you fucking kidding me?

1095
01:13:47,177 --> 01:13:50,377
All she's gotta do is
aim down that stairwell

1096
01:13:50,379 --> 01:13:52,212
and pull the fucking trigger, man.

1097
01:13:52,214 --> 01:13:54,081
And you're drunk and you're slow.

1098
01:13:54,083 --> 01:13:56,250
You'd be like shooting fish in a barrel.

1099
01:13:56,252 --> 01:13:57,818
That's brilliant.

1100
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,153
That's fucking brilliant, soldier boy.

1101
01:14:00,155 --> 01:14:02,490
Just go home.

1102
01:14:02,492 --> 01:14:05,827
- Go home to your daughter.
- I don't have a fucking daughter!

1103
01:14:05,829 --> 01:14:09,130
- I fucking hate kids!
- What the fuck does it matter, man?

1104
01:14:09,132 --> 01:14:11,432
- You win.
- You fucking coward!

1105
01:14:11,434 --> 01:14:13,835
You didn't have the balls
to make the call, did you?

1106
01:14:13,837 --> 01:14:17,071
<i>No! You gave up your
responsibility to the little girl.</i>

1107
01:14:17,073 --> 01:14:19,105
And you came crawling down here

1108
01:14:19,107 --> 01:14:21,242
with your dick in your fucking hand

1109
01:14:21,244 --> 01:14:23,877
to grovel like a dog for mercy?!

1110
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:25,912
Fuck you! I don't do mercy!

1111
01:14:25,914 --> 01:14:27,615
I'm gonna do you both a favor

1112
01:14:27,617 --> 01:14:30,350
- and end your miserable fucking lives...
- No, no, no, no.

1113
01:14:30,352 --> 01:14:32,286
- ...right now!
- Hold on!

1114
01:14:32,288 --> 01:14:34,087
Now come on, man!

1115
01:14:34,089 --> 01:14:35,923
What the hell is that gonna solve, huh?

1116
01:14:35,925 --> 01:14:38,059
<i>I thought you didn't
kill for pleasure.</i>

1117
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,626
Ain't you been listening?

1118
01:14:39,628 --> 01:14:42,395
Huh? Have I been talking out my ass

1119
01:14:42,397 --> 01:14:44,365
all motherfucking day?!

1120
01:14:44,367 --> 01:14:47,602
I'd have told you I had prostate cancer

1121
01:14:47,604 --> 01:14:50,237
- if I thought it would help.
- We haven't seen your face...

1122
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,974
Oh, no? Well, here! Now you have.

1123
01:14:52,976 --> 01:14:54,474
- Nice to fucking meet ya!
- ( gunshot )

1124
01:14:54,476 --> 01:14:57,577
- ( Carter screams )
- Mara: Carter!

1125
01:14:57,579 --> 01:14:59,179
- Sade: <i>Time's up, kid!</i>
- ( screaming )

1126
01:14:59,181 --> 01:15:00,548
You need to bring your ass down here

1127
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,416
before I kill your brand-new daddy.

1128
01:15:02,418 --> 01:15:03,984
No, Bird. No!

1129
01:15:03,986 --> 01:15:06,353
You stay! You stay!

1130
01:15:06,355 --> 01:15:08,288
Your choice, princess.

1131
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:10,925
How many more people gotta die

1132
01:15:10,927 --> 01:15:13,960
- because of you?
- She's just a kid, for Christ's sake.

1133
01:15:13,962 --> 01:15:16,300
- There's no way.
- <i>( stairs creaking )</i>

1134
01:15:19,468 --> 01:15:21,501
Attagirl. Come to papa.

1135
01:15:21,503 --> 01:15:24,071
Bird, no! You stay up there!

1136
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:26,910
- <i>Go back!</i>
- Oh, my God.

1137
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,483
Damn, girl. You know, you're about

1138
01:15:35,485 --> 01:15:37,318
the toughest mark I ever had!

1139
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,053
- Whoa!
- Bird, no!

1140
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:40,955

Oh, hi, pumpkin.

Scary, isn't it?

No.

What do you think I am?

1161
01:17:42,278 --> 01:17:45,982
